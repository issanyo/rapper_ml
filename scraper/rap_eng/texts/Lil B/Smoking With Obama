[Intro]
Every person can relate to this
Real people around the world, we unitin', you know what I'm sayin'?
From the gutter to the under, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
I thought shit was gon' change when I voted for Obama
Now a nigga outchea thuggin', tryna find a comma
Every time I'm on my back I'm tryna stay one hunna
I might go and ride my bitch, I might tell her somethin'
Everybody know I robbed the fuckin' plug before
Everybody know I put hands on my hoes
I'm a jealous nigga so I don't like that stuntin'
Flexin' on Instagram, I'm finna rob somethin'
Nigga like me, I never inherited nothin'
So I might catch a Jones if the price runnin'
I feel like I'm finna catch a sack
I relate to Sam Hurd cause I need it fast
I'll tax anybody if I need that weight
I rob drug dealers 'cause them bitches fake
I'll lick you in your face, then I'll fuck you raw
I'ma down a couple bitches, boy, no love

[Hook]
I'ma keep it one hunnit, I voted for Obama
But it's niggas outchea hungry and it's hot this summer
I'ma keep it one hunnit, man I'm droppin' number
Man I'm tryna get a zip and smoke it with Obama
I'ma keep it one hunnit, I voted for Obama
But it's niggas outchea hungry and it's hot this summer
I'ma keep it one hunnit, man I'm droppin' number
Man I'm tryna get a zip and smoke it with Obama

[Outro]
BasedGod, I know y'all wanted that second verse, but I'm too real. I know y'all wanted that but you feel me, you can't get that. It's just too real, you feel me? Like I said, it's Lil B though, we keepin' it in, man, Lil B, Thugged Out, Pissed Off, you know what I'm sayin'? Mixtape, man, makin' history, 2-15, we in it. Thuggin' harder than ever. I never thought it was gonna be this real. But it is though, you know what I'm sayin'? Livin' it, walkin' it, history. You know what time it is. Everybody that's been pushin' it, you hear the voice, you know what time it is. You know what time it is every time we step in, baby. That's that real, BasedGod!
