Take a trill piece, a trill hit
I’mma go get ‘em, fuck a bitch
Nigga's ass cold like froze meat
I don’t play cheap, take frost, get your brain tossed
Make a snitch nigga's shirt red like meat sauce
You take flows, I ain't never copied off no nigga
Make a bitch strip, asshole fit the whole dick
Call her "asshole", make her bounce like a cold pimp
You can plate sea-food man, take this whole shrimp
Now stop that bitch nigga tell him go fish
Streets taught me how to ride, now I got a froze whip
Polar cold clip, pop bullets, pop the whole clip
Pop him in his back, pop back like a hatchback
I ain't playing with the mixtapes
Cool, like a switchblade, cut a nigga like sensei
