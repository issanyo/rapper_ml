[Verse]
Let me tell you how these niggas tried to play me
If you ready, scream one, two, to the three
If you ready, scream five to the fucking six
My name is lil b and I'm the motherfucking shit
And with that niggas look way past my face
This shit is too real, I damn near caught a case
I got one life to live; I ain't fin' to waste this shit
Niggas dying in the hood over bitches
Over drugs and shit, that shit that's man-made
Real talk, man, talkin' to the OG
He said B you gotta incorporate like hell's angels
Show love and turn into a new angle
Unity is the only thing we missin'
Real love ain't shit but division
Same people countries hold it down
From the fucking west to the fuckin' town
Gettin' slaughtered, man, I swear that shit's fucked up
Got blessed and came to America
Go to school and created his character
From Africa, that shit is spectacular
Keep your head up; win every day
Man, the sports is the only thing
That you love, bruv, I swear to god the world loves ya
Young thug, man, don't trip young thug
They walk and sleep
But the game's so deep
Only got one heart; one blood pumpin'
Go push something. Not that something
Just something that gets you through the struggle
USA life, to the public
USA is my home and I love it
The USA got some hoes in the budget
Keep thuggin, keep spreadin' love
Real smooth dude, like a thug
