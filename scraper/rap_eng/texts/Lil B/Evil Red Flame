This is Red Flame, evil Red Flame
Let me get some things clear and off my damn brain
I ain't never been the one to say no damn names
Kanye West, you're a genius man
All my real niggas, I'm never leaving man
Quit asking me to be the old B man
I'm faster and I'm better than ever
Personal problems will be solved; I'ma get it together

It's Red Flame
It's Red Flame
Evil Red Flame

Evil Red Flame
Can see it in their eyes
They fear my potential; let me grow
Maybe I care about gettin' my mom
Insure she ain't gotta work for no one
The pain's in my heart with Satan
Do everything myself and that's the center of it
Shit, take a picture of it
You'll realize I'm still thuggin'
Conscience conscious talks with my spirit
It's a mirror of discussions
I haven't looked at myself in a while
All I'm goin is down
But I'm the highest that you've ever seen
Bruh, I'm the real nigga that's livin' his dreams
Put everything in music -- no ifs and betweens
I'ma kill a motherfucker if fuck with my team
I ain't built for jail, but I'll built a regime
Just let me live
Because every nigga wanna fight me now because of the fame that he see
Call himself a friend, but it's the game that he see
Cool nigga, devilish things
I got love for the world, but these cowards is haters
And I ain't never gonna sell out; that's on my bitch and my niggas
My bitch and my niggas, what's the word
We need to uplift the world
See the bigger picture
Evil Red Flame
What's the word is just a word
