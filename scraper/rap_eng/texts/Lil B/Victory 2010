[Intro]
It's that Victory 2010
Shouts out to the East Coast
Lil B for "Lil Boss"
BasedGod

[Verse 1]
Yeah, mighty mighty lion in this jungle
It's B-Town, Waterfront, I might triple with the double
So get everything, but you don't forget the hustle
Winning on my mind, so it's money and the struggle
Yeah, I said it's cash and the rebound
Rap game, hoop game, catch you with the freestyle
Rovers accessed, never hitchhike to you
Prove you the best, I'm on board, no chess
Rap, no rest 'til I'm deep in the chest
Smooth with finesse, pass off to the best
Shit, I'm here for a while now
Real man, real nigga, real boy, real god
Rap god, wrap me up in plastic
Shade me up in oz's, put me over knots
Bet I'll bubble up, like the dopeman rock
Bet I make crack, like the dopeman pots
Boss don't stop, boss don't quit
B too legit, roll or be legit
Don't nobody talk when the green's in the midst
Watch your own ass cause the greed do exist
Took my own path, best believe this is it
Set my own goals, and I take my own nicks
And yes, I'm homesick cause the game so sick
Take these tips, and believe, you'll rip
Ask young cuz, I was leading like a mob boss
Had a real team that was ready for the job, boss
Any dude want it, have 'em looking like Ty Law
Leave him with the corner back, never give a quarter back
I was never giving audibles
Niggas switched they plays up, over seas 'Stanbul
That's the residents in Turkey
I'm talking 'bout the country, how can niggas birth me?
I said, how can niggas work me?
This is not a job, this is preschool surgery
Real easy, and complex
Fantasize, and bet that your bitch come next
Lil Boss

[Outro]
This is victory
Victory 2009, you feel me?
Yeah man, this my takeover man
Any rap nigga want it bruh, tell him it's here, man
I'm here man, I wanna take your whole squad on deck, man
Me against your whole fucking team, you feel me?
Like I said man, rap god, BasedGod in this motherfucker, man
Come fuck with me
Rawest rapper alive
