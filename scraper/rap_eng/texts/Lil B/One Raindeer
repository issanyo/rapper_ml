[Intro]
Merry Christmas
Rare Golden Collectibles
There is only one bitch left
Merry Christmas, niggas

[Verse]
Bullshit and Parties
Reindeer, Santa Claus
Bitches pay me to fuck them
Merry Christmas, presents is lonely
When the party, I feel like OutKast
With tassels down the hourglass
Make the hour pass
Dreaming but life to real to depict the pictures
It's all planned out, my right hand man is out
Dance tonight with the streetlights alone
Candles out, everything a little hard on Christmas time
Snow of a flow, parting the sea
Under the tree nicest present of them all
Feeling all thoughts with those who had our back from Spring to Fall
Holidays are for the love and the spirit
No Santa Claus, no presents are needed
But your presence is needed
Cookies, Turkies stuff little faces bright with joy
Fuck gifts, relatives, spirits, gift wrap
Greed thoughts fill our homes
Parking lot, Christmas, Silver Bells
You ain't got one?
Just look around
The spirit of the city has turned this around
Each day may be a surprise
Appreciate the food you eat
Laugh a little bit and be discrete
Eggnog tastes sweet
Hennessy pour with Charlie Brown on VHS Tape

Home Alone Part 2 New York
Bank Robbers on TV
Dudess petty Christmas Day

[Bridge]
The time to be with family, you know, family
Peace of mind to close sanity
Close the door light the candles
Fireplaces come in handy
Homeless shelter people come together
One common ground, it's all love and human nature

[Outro]
Merry Christmas
