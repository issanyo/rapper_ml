[Intro: Lil B]
I don't know why I still stick around with you
Ay, girl, you be really trippin', you feel me?
You know, shouts out to the dudes that be sticking with their woman through all the bad and the good, all that

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you
People stay talking shit, but I'm alarmed at you
You're under oath; when it rains, no undercoat
I'm like thunder, and I see your eyes
Bitch, stop lyin', I read your body, you're so
An open book, come back, I don't overlook
Sometimes you're as sweet as nobody
I helped you out with no shoes, I was coming out pocket
Laying low in the hood while I was dumb and out rocket
You seem to forget, it was easy to get
'Till you seen that it was easy to split
Now you get emotional; don't trip
Didn't take care at first, so why you all on my dick?
Think about it, bitch: hatin' on another day
I'm getting out, and I split, bitch

[Bridge]
Yesss!
Don't act like you care about me

[Verse 2]
Now you're the type of girl that'll get a man set up
You be fucking him, loving him, lying to us
You gon' hurt that boy's feelings with that fake shit
Why you creeping out, hopping on a rich nigga's dick
When you got a man at home that holds shit down?
What now? You want to see some new shit? Bitch, you foul
Don't act like -- We all, be honest
Look me in the eye; you sucked that boy's dick with no problem
From a whore to a housewife, housewife to a ho
Nigga the time come and go
I guess you like giving out the blues; you're satisfied
With that; fuck that bitch and peep this
Get your shit together; I'm on the streets, bitch
You're loving that, I'm bringing home the bacon
I'm never taking these fake-ass hoes; I'm player-hatin'
I'm calling you up on your shit and I'm never forgivin'

[Outro]
What's the word, bitch? It ain't no limit
Fuck these hoes that claimin' that they love me but the don't
But they don't; bitch you wrong and you know you're wrong
This for the hoes that love me and they really don't
Claiming that they love me but, bitch, you really don't
You're wrong
