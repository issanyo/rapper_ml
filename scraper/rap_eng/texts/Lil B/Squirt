Ask about me, ask about me

[Hook]
Make that bitch squirt x16

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Kinda like that ho, who gon' know, I don't know
She gon' swim, catch that rope, off the top like a boat
Like a park, like a pussy, she got nerve, she gon' swerve
Off that lean, off that bean, hit that sky with your legs
Im gon' blow your back out, off the top at the mansion
Bitch I'm from the Earth, fuck what its worth
I'mma pay fifty bitch, you don't need to work
My mind right, see whats that work
Posted on the Seven with a bitch and a blunt
Stay strapped up, playing with me
They don't know me
Fuck that shit, I don't cheat

[Hook]
