[Intro: Lil B]
Aye real shit
You know this Gold House mixtape
You feel me? We really get live
All I got is one thing man
Fuck you niggas hating, and speaking shit behind my back
You feel me?
You know I ain't fucking with none of you niggas

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Got two things
That’s two things
I don’t come around bitch
And we don’t got to hang out
This shit really bang out
I be on my home turf
Don’t come around here
I -- Then I cock that
All black 36, I’m so top hat
All I got is my dick and my word
I don’t play around cause I’m damn near servin'
Damn near fell off and I damn was hurting
Until I found the master plan, now I am for certain
I fuck around and I’m finna touch a billion
You know I’m the rawest out
Ain’t nobody fuckin' with me
That money niggas made and they hate on me
Now I don’t want to rhyme about shit
I do 100 grand shows and I’m selling out that bitch
And player, I ain't a rapper, I’m a game spitter
That's word to my nigga
Based God

[Verse 2: Lil B]
All I got is my balls and my fucking word
I’m smoking zips to the head
I got some fucking nerve
It takes 1 to 2 weeks to see if your sick
Strapped up in the mansion with a 50 bin
My semi clip the same size as 50 cent
Gimme change and a dollar, i’m taxing bitch
Gimme brain and I holla cause i’m active bitch
Bitch Mob Gold House Based World bitch

[Outro: Lil B]
Like I say man
All I got is my brain and my heart
All I got is two things
I got my brain and my muthafucking conscious
Fuck my balls and my word
I got my brain my heart and my conscious
Based god
I got 10 thangs, 30 thangs
You heard me?
