[Intro]
You know, Illusions Of Grandeur I'm sitting in front of this mirror
And this Lil B and I wanna know who you really love
Do you really love me?
If so..I don't even need you to put your hands in the air, just show me
Just show me you love me

Uhh, who you love?

Aye, who you love Lil B yeah
Yeah, yeah tell me who you love
Jeah, tell me who you love
Ah ah, yeah tell me who you love
It's Lil B

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Let me know
I'm in front of the mirror
With pearls on Queen Elizabeth, no pope
Niggas is homo
Im King style
I'm thinking 30 years ahead
Niggas is dead, 50 round drum aim it at yo head
Break em off slow
I take the shit they can't afford
Who you really love?
That's the question, awkward
Baby, I'm playing off the best courts now
I'm like a painter, with a vest and a sword
But my intentions are pure
Ya know, I rock for sure
Been on the block for sure
Thug it out in public
Tiny pants hustler, deep cover
Gat..toasted
Real family got the mack loaded
It's people send subliminal shots, I'm watching
I'm on TV everyday, my whole life out on display
You can see me if you really wanna
Take deep breaths, thanks for living
Hope what you got on your mission, keep living yeah
