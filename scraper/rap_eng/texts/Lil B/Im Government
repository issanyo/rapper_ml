Yeah, one take nigga
Coming straight out the gutta, bitch
Real pain from the heart, Lil B
How are we similar? Put the dope in the cinema
In your face, live like a cinnabon, I'm out
Bitch I don’t need no stripes
Every time I fall back, Jesus writes
I don't gotta love of suckers take out small persons
Steal purses, whatever that work I want money
What your pussy worth, if your pussy work
Or you laying off, money ten ways I was laying off
Couple suckas in the clique, had to lay em off
If I wasn’t in a position I would have killed them all
Aim at cars for the bills
Infrared will show you, that my gun talk
You niggas all pussy, you just gun talk
I don’t wanna talk, It’s just white chalk
I love talking numbers, cocaine summers
Got limousines filled with paper
I was sleep on the street so the worlds my neighbor
Switched up the grind, I switched up to mansions
Switched up my game but I kept my shoes on
Tied the shoes string around my locker
Cars outside, got money dope and problems
PO watching, PO piss test
I stay in the smoke shops buying that fake piss
I’m a live everyday up till I come home
Same niggas fucked with me, they fuck my day up
So, how I move with this money
Drive with this money, got designer money
You feel me? Blow up the house
Down in Unesco about to front out water
Game time, I fell down, came back harder
Spent a lot of money, I came back smarter
Smallest people, they move the farthest
I seen fast people turn into a target
Most people making money, they so heartless
I’m a fall off and bounce back regardless
You can’t see yourself how you looking at me
You say time is money why you fucking with me?
Because I’m a billion dollars niggas hating on me
From the ground up niggas put the game on me
Lock me in, put the walls up for me
Anybody can be picked up and turn that mac out
But who got respect, who honor the trap house?
Who made money, who made the crack rock?
Check for asbestos ,1960’s
Niggas living with problems asthma coughing up drama
Hit a lot of licks that’s the one time
Can’t be faking, this game is full of one times
It only take one time to serve the one time
Have you on them books with that drum line
Put a mack out I'm sendin' punishment
I make laws I feel like the government
I check traps I feel like I’m publishing
I send you yo check bitch, I"m government
It’s Lil B, Thugged Out Pissed Off
