[Intro]
Yeah, 100 thousand man, I fly
Hey, take me out the sky real quick bruh
You feel me
I'm sly like a cat's heart
You feel me, I'm smart like a cat
Never been a cat but you can relate me to a cat
Actually I am a cat cause I'm a leo
So I'm a lion
And I think that's a cat if I'm correct

[Verse 1]
I said I been a fucking cat, man
100 thousand, bitch, I been like
Undercover like Batman, never see my face
Up in the jungle boy
You better smash him, smash them
Never followed us back then
We was getting money back then
In this jungle, motherfuckers never humble
They love to see you stumble
When you walking straight, they want your ass to fumble
Never finna fumble
Man, I handle business
100 thousand, I need a witness
100 thousand upon the scrimmage
100 thousand mobs see me
What you wanna do, be me?
Eventhough I'm not on TV
I got a million people wanting to be me
And a hundred people see me every fucking day
Yes, plus the women around the world all day
Based boys already, pro-based
Based lords, based legends, we all here, okay
It's a cat's heart

Yeah, heart of a lion
We are related
My nigga, it's a cat's heart

Yeah, it's in the jungle
My nigga, it's a cat's heart
I been a fucking Leo, yeah
So I'm a motherfucking cat
Yeah, yeah
It's Lil B

[Verse 2]
When I say I'm in the jungle
Don't think I'm outside
Up in the rubbish, in the rubble
Man, I handle bussiness thugging
Like a young nigga should
Hustling up on the corporate level
Thuggin, being a real nigga
Above fake bitches, above these fake motherfuckers
Corporate scammers, I don't give a fuck
No hands out, don't hand me nothing
At the end, it's all me and you, nothing
Nobody is down for you, except the music and the love
Me and you
Thanks for hearing me cause it's only me and you
Fuck the coroporate people, fuck the money in it
Yeah, as long as you're listening, it's all good
Come see me and respect my vision
It's a cat's heart, a lion's heart
I speak to you from the jungle
Based jungle above, boy
All the rubbish, all the hustle, the tussle
The fighting, the muscle, the love, the struggle
Everything up in the jungle, it's a cat's heart
I'm in the jungle and it's a cat's heart
I'm in the jungle everyday and it's a cat's heart, yeah
I'm in the jungle everyday and it's a cat's heart, yeah
