[Intro: 2Pac]
All that society is doing is leeching off the ghetto
They use the ghetto for their pain, for their sorrow, for their culture, for their music (Everything)
For their happiness, for their movies (All that shit)
They talk about Boyz n the Hood, you know what I'm saying?
I'm not saying I'm gonna rule the world (But you can), or I'm gonna change the world
But I guarantee (You will) I will spark the brain (Always believe) that does change the world, that's our job

[Verse: Lil B]
If I can't benefit, what's the benefit?
No benefits so I'm sick in this motherfucker, bitch lyin'
Tryna say she 'bout me or somethin'
I don't know no bitch that love me for nothin'
Toss the hoe like trash, I don't kick no cans
I only believe what I see, don't compare me to them
Can't walk with envy, niggas try to suck juice
[?], I'll peel your top like the back of a roof
Fifty thousand dollar suits, brown [?]
People say I'm the truth, no lie, no proof
Got change of heart, no Kevin Hart, I'm not funny
Got money in the briefcase, drugs in the suitcase
Fo' five on my waist, dreaming 'bout better days
Gotta change my life, or trade it for your best day
Nothing stand in my way, I got roadblocks
Stranded on this highway, no stops
Passing light no trucks, flat beds
Putting major weed in it
You gotta leave the game before it start
Shout out Kendrick Lamar, fame never got to him
Wanna be on time, take a life time
To build your name up, stones running through my body
My mind on money, not street problems
The only person that told me the truth was my mom
My dad does too, from a distance
For instance, my life was just like that sentence
Judge never told me I shouldn't, so how would I get it?
Had to get out of line to get in position
Best leaders gotta listen, ain't tryna miss it
People just talk because they mouth was spittin'
I feel like money coming, my palms is itchin'
Never too old to speak, I'm the one that's gifted
Cardboard box, you the one that's missin'
Prayers to music, shout out to Enzo
Real Based family got me, all the hizzos
I keep pushing the story, got me tapped in
Feeling like a zombie â€˜cause I'm always trapped in
You don't get it, I move North so I'm trapped in
'05, '04, I was tapped in
Never been a slave to the high fashion
But I'm high with my fashion, blue weed on my t-shirt
[?] sold 25 grams of the candy
Take it to me, I keep it handy
It's distance between stopping and going
The bitch never stop and she definitely going, Lil B
