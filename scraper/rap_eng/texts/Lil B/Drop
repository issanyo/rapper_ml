[Intro]
So famous

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
Once upon a time I was young and still mackin'
Whatchu wanna do boy, you know I'm straight jackin'
Straight west side, know we get it again
If I'm on the block hustlin', get it to spend
Man I'm reppin' based world, bitch I'm hot
Can't tell me nothin boy like I'm Kanye West
Got weed on deck, Grey Poupon
Smoking all day, oh my god!
I went to L.A. holla at T. Barker
And I'm from the Bay, boy, so the girls start bossin'
I told her one thing that I had to say:
"Mind over matter, girl I gotta get paid"

[Hook - Lil B]
I don't wanna drop but you know I'm straight droppin'
I don't wanna drop but you know I'm straight droppin'
I don't wanna drop but you know I'm straight droppin'
Kickflip bitch, on my grind straight droppin'

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
Well is it a blizzard? I'm CLR
And from the hood so you know I've got a ski mask partner
Made a lot of money like a fine ass bitch
I ain't never had the nerve to say my life ain't shit
It's Straps and Stars, girls and cars
Tags in bars, have sex with stars
Green man c-notes, gambling casinos
And a porn star girl that lived in reno
I don't wanna do it but my first name leo
Brrrangkadang and I'm rich like leo
I'm at the cornerflip don't call my Treo
Cause I ain't gon' answer
Jackass like Steve-O

[Hook - Lil B]

[Bridge - Lil B]
Based god, based god
And I'm finna get paid
Based boys, based boys
And I'm finna get laid
Based god, based god
And I'm finna get paid
Based boys, based boys
And I'm finna get laid

[Verse 3 - Lil B]
If you don't care and you're drunk in here
Say "hell yeah!" ("hell yeah!")
If you don't care that your bitch is here
Say "hell yeah!" ("hell yeah!")
If you don't care and you're drunk in here
Say "hell yeah!" ("hell yeah!")
If you don't care that your bitch is here
Say "hell yeah!" ("hell yeah!")
