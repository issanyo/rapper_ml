[Hook - Lil B]
Do you love me girl?
Love me?
You keep on saying you want me girl
But you’re gonna run away
You keep on saying you need my love
But you keep on fighting me
You keep on saying you want my heart
But do you think you’re ready babe?
If you only have one last time to love
Is this really happening?
(Yeah Lil B Bitch Mob)

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
I’m on the front porch
I’m in the back yard
Waiting for you girl
I'mma stand tall
Like your sweet kiss
From your sweet lips
Makes my soul fly
Feel like I’m god
I told you once
I done told you twice
Me and you together it feels so right

[Bridge - Lil B]
Now I never had a love like you, everybody tries to tell me…

[Hook x2]
You keep on saying you want me girl
But you’re gonna run away
You keep on saying you need my love
But you keep on fighting me
You keep on saying you need my heart
But do you think you’re ready babe?
If lonely ever last time your love
Is this really happening?
