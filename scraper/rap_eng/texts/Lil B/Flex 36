[Verse 2: Lil B]
Flex 36, I’m the pretty bitch
Nigga stole my swag, now I have to hit a lick
Young Basedgod I got bitches off the rip
Came to the club man and bitches on my dick
Look at me, I’m Little B

Strap with the mag, swag in the bag
Came from the squad, like damn Fort Bragg
Stephen Curry Basedgod, Donald Trump Basedgod
Bitches suck my dick, I’ma tell you bout the base bout
Coming out the bad, I’ma show you bout A-Rod
Bitch get a face lift, straight in the matrix
Bitch suck my dick, cause my nuts are like raisins

Mmm, I’m amazing, switching location, I’m in places (You're a nigg*r!)
Young Basegod got a bitch that was racist
Flex 20 bitches and they swear that I’m crazy
Fuck 20 bitches and I’m in to the navy
Lose my swag, you must be crazy

I got a lot of bitches so I'm never masturbating
