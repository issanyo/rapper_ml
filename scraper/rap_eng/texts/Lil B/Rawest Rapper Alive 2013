[Intro]
Yeah, this that Illusions Of Grandeur part 2
You know everybody still fucked up
I'm talking about whatever, you know
Motherfuckers gonna have to pay dues for this pain, you feel me?
I'm making motherfuckers handle the thing, man
I'mma say fuck you niggas

[Verse 1]
Why I'm so relaxed, cause I stay with the strap
Officer's hat, lay you where the officers at
All from scratch, might not all from that
Murder and silence, heat-stroke silence the violence
Staying at the place where the government hiding
Bad bitch on my dick, I be keeping it quiet
See when you lying, infra-red see where you lying
See, I'm a lion, look back see who's firing
Fan at the dugout, ya see I'm a giant
Selling fake work, bitch, I am not that nigga
Bitch say she love me, I am not yo nigga
Dude say he love, I got the choppa nigga
Shotgun make you sound like the opera with us
R.I.P. to dead brothers, I ain't forgot my niggas
All my Wolf Pack brothers keep it hot, my nigga
Keep it Based to the end and won't stop my nigga
They wanna look at me and call me the bad guy
But you spit out crack in the open, he's so focused
Call, move, but the doors don't open
Drive the new whips where the doors start folding
Knock 'em in his mouth and his jaw start folding
I just run plays like Anquan Boldin
Niggas think that I'm fake, so they say he stole it
But a smile on my face so I keep on rolling
How I'm gonna drive when my eyes not focused?
I keep on crying inside. The world on fire
But, really, I complain
I'm not mad cause most people on trial
Most niggas my age got a number and file
Most niggas sell work and gotta hustle and smile
Fucked the wrong bitch and had an accident child
Thoughts, man. Them hoes is foul
I'll kill the next bitch playing with child support
Often awkward, I'mma sit with the chopper
Eat with the chopper, nigga, I'mma sleep with the chopper
Say a prayer for my dad and a prayer for momma
Can't hate nobody, cause you keep that karma
I'm riding through the Bay, smoking on that karma
Life a football game, I'm staying with armor
Lil' B, Illusions Of Grandeur part 2. (yesss!)

[Outro]
You know I'm thuggin'
Aye, man, Shouts out to 0-5, shouts out to Hawaii
What it do?
