Yeah, uh, what you think about it
Stop the violence
What you think about it
Stop selling drugs
What you think about it
Stop pimping girls
What you think about it

[Verse]
What you think about stopping violence
Causing all the tyrants, putting guns down
Stop selling drugs and worldwide pimping
Stop jail systems and help school systems
This a really good move, pimp it
If we all had it equal, it would be broke and alive
Than to be rich and alive
Being broke is a mindset
Don't compare your funds
Just stick to your guns
No weapons
We already controlled by the money up top
Just smile everyday, work hard or watch
No problem if you need it
Just make unemployment the number one focus
Healthcare too
I care about me and you
I'm riding on the plane
Risk my life for people, like you
It's love over here, just don't forget it
Love over here

[Hook]

[Verse]
I didn't watch from the window up top
Life's window, looking like a silhouette
I see my mom and uncles
I love them all
My aunties and cousins
I want the people that's with me everyday
Y'all keep me moving, my support is real
People write me long notes to feel
Can't no one keep your head up
You made it for real
Victor McCartney, I love you to death
Keyboard kid, that's my brother from another
Certified Hits, I love you
Your man, just keep on working
A lot of people do that, just keep on twerking
Keep a love in your soul for the people that stop
I made an album called I'm Gay
Even though I'm not gay, I made a statement to the world
These chains, and Nas
I ain't cop out, that was just my plan
To spread love, the best that I can
Shouts out to Nikia

Spread love
Let's spread this love, BasedGod Velli
Shouts out to Rap Radar, big homie for posting me
YM for posting me
One love to you bro
Hot New Hiphop, what it do
