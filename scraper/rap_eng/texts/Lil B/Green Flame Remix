[Verse 1 - Lil B]
AC, Green its hot
Can't see me bitch stop
Boy stop quit playing
Bitch not.. fucking loff
First dude I switch lanes crossover switch fans
I don't play, its money over here
Niggas get popping, niggas gotta win
Wired cars that they hold don't show they face
I was holding that.. it was like 'whats that?'
Im coming back, You niggas know Im solid
Get jacked in the streets but I keep it solid
Im tryna get my shit, tryna come up off a brother with his shit together
Gotta get my mind right overview the world
Cause I don't give a fuck no more
Hittin' niggas with the Glock, leave em stuck in the cut
I was hurt before, I ain't gon let that happen
Again, these niggas get back
Fuck this rapping, Imma show these motherfuckers bout rapping
Show these motherfuckers who get laid up in the casket for rapping
You better learn to rap
