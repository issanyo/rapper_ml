[Intro:]
Everybody know I do every fucking thing
I keep my mouth closed like I'm off them things bro
My jaw locked up, I'm locked up no bail
Raising hell in the cell

[Verse: 1]
I'm still the dealer
Mm. Everybody's dealer (BasedGod!)
Everybody buy dope from me because I'm iller (Dang!)
I'mma eat a pussy, and I have no remorse
Uh! Bruh you lying, no I'm for reallaz
Keep my eyes closed cuz I know who's a killer
Shut your mouth bitch! Uh! BasedGod! BasedGod!
BasedGod it's Friday, BasedGod's you sell dope
BasedGod's a bitch because he sleeps in a mansion
30 guns, salute, I don't know what happened
All I know is this: I'mma rep the bitch
Bitch Mob, Bitch Mob, I fucks with the Bitch Mob
The music in my mansion, we all support the Bitch Mob
Everybody know that I'm down to pull licks
I'm strapped to the chair, and I'm frying out that bitch
I'm in the cell repping where I'm from because I'm crazy (BasedGod)
I got pussy fed, you know I'm dropping 80
BasedGod

[Hook:]
Bitch breathe slow (x16)
AHHHHHH LET ME OUT OF THIS MOTHERFUCKING CAGE!!!!!

[Verse: 2]
Like a pirate
Chewing on pills
Har De Har, BasedGod
Bitches love the BasedGod
I'm SpongeBob SquarePants, I'm strapped with the heater
Don't ride with me-a
I'm the pussy eater
Eat her whole ass in the car while she's driving
Bitch pull over! You know I got a license!
Bitch you look so good! Let your hair down
SpongeBob BasedGod! You're so funny!
