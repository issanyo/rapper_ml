[Intro]
It's just so deep. Nigga could remember just last year I didn't have shit. Things could change so fast when you put your faith in something else. Evil Red Flame

[Chorus]
Didn't ask for nothing
Work hard everyday now I'm fucking stuntin'
Remember I was in the hood around last summer
Now I'm eating and you suckers can't tell me nothing
Remember nigga
Remember I was on my dick, I didn't ask for nothing

[Verse 1]
Glorified it, I ain't never glorified it
Bruh I swear man the game is divided
Niggas divorce around sixteen
Married to the dream
No Christina Milian, niggas need a million
[?] huh
Flow like the city bus
Niggas slow, they self-destruct
I'm on a roll, you can't pick me up
Niggas is fake as fuck
Niggas'll wake you up to break you up
Pain enough
The average man brain be fucked
A violent game nigga jealous over the fakest things
I promise shit always ain't what it seems
Niggas believe anything I swear to Jesus
Uh and eat it
Damn near another ledger sleeping
Nigga pray for me
My art Jimi Hendrix
I'm stuck in the painting
[?] can't even see it

[Interlude]
Real shit though my nigga
You gotta understand it

[Chorus]
Remember I was on my dick, I didn't ask for nothing
Work hard everyday now I'm fucking stuntin'
Remember I was in the hood around last summer
Now I'm eating and you suckers can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2]
Easy, cause fascinating
Under the radar, niggas had to play it
Wanna write me off but all these checks is cashing
I ain't overrated in a couple years
Nigga [?] tears for fears think deeply
The process can make you sleepy, follow me
If I would never rap, what the fuck would you have?
Don't think bad, that's when the devil get mad
See I talk to myself, pizazz
Paparazzi fucking with me
I'm thinking bout two 11
Semi-autos and Mac11's
Bank safes is a jacker's heaven
I pour the liquor and pray but they be faking often
Sitting next to phonies, check 'em out
Fill 'em out, complete the test
We leave 'em hell, fuck the rest
BasedGod til the death

[Interlude 2]
Real shit my nigga
Evil Red Flame
Never leave my soul

[Chorus]
Remember I was on my dick, I didn't ask for nothing
Work hard everyday now I'm fucking stuntin'
Remember I was in the hood around last summer
Now I'm eating and you suckers can't tell me nothing

[Outro]
Evil Red Flame
Shouts out to everybody that's been holding me down
This only the beginning, this shit ain't stopping
Greatest mixtape ever to drop
Lil B
