[Intro]
Yo man we gon' bring this back to the '08 style, west Coast style
It's your boy Lil B, you feel me? Holla at me
Yeah, you know what I'm saying? shouts out to Too $hort
(Young bitch, Bout my dollaz, young bitch)
Yeah

Looking out for that payroll while I drop that Oscar Mayer
And twenty got this twenty to get a bag of this weed
Bitch you ain't know I'm cellular, with a blunt in my mouth
Checking my bitch brain in her eye, what is you lying about?

From the west, Waterfront, but I fucks with the south
Berkeley boys up in this bitch, I'm finna put my dick in her mouth
Asking bout, options go, materialistic bitch
Trick this smile world, take what you want I'mma deal with that shit

Deal with that D up on that scissor
Having them hoes calling me a wizard
Breaking that shit on down, all the way down
You must have some nizzerve

Stupid Bitch, playing with the super fly
Super fly, online all the time
With my bruh riding chocolate thangs
And I got a bad steller let her hair swang

Get her ho get up off my collar
Give a fuck if you a model
Young bitch I'm bout my dollaz

TELL A BITCH I'm BOUT MY DOLLAZ

Berkeley, Berkeley, Waterfront, Ask that bitch
She was in the back seat driving up on this stick
B-A-N-G-K-A-D-A-N-G on that double-O G style
8 Mile, looking for that green mile

Come take your face out your ass for a minute
Come check me out man cuz I'm really really spitting
This is knowledge for your pockets young bitch
I'm saving every penny cuz I gotta make sense

Paper, paper, is all I'm after
Having these hoes call me a pastor
Touched her forehead, amen
I saved that bitch like pastor

Man I need a forklift when it's time to work
Tell my bitch, man it's time to work
Tell this money that it's time to work
I done checked in, and now I'm late for work

And I ain't trippin if you holla
I'm looking at your wallet
Young bitch I'm bout my dollaz

THANKYOUBASEDGOD
