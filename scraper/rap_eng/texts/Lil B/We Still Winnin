[Intro: Lil B]
05 Fuck em mixtape, holla at me
This is real life man, where niggas get killed
Woke up last night like how I wake up
Thinking like how I wake up
A lot of niggas sleep, thank god I woke up
Lil B

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Real niggas dead or brain dead, look
In their eyes a lot of niggas ain't there
Real niggas smart but the nigga so scared
I was in the hood like people understand
How you gonna speak if your niggas wasn't there?
You make moves but I know y'all were scared
Life on the line, no mass blood in my hands
No glove no fair, thug with honor
Catch me in the wind
Can't act scare like everyday i'm drinking gin
But I do keep it real, I got a lot of fans
Everyday I mixed up, niggas getting switched up
I ain't got no problems, niggas getting mixed up
I don't act stupid, I might act weird
But nigga
I don't act stupid, Fake niggas act stupid
But you can't act smart, I got too much intelligence
You know what i'm saying? You fake niggas is irrelevant
Lil B

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Its real life man that niggas get killed
Woke up last night like how I wake up?
Thinking how I woke up
A lot of real niggas sleep, Thank god I woke up
Lil B

[Outro: Lil B]
I was selling hard drugs
I was selling soft drugs
Skinny niggas hating, so does fat ones
The fat ones gave me 25 for the 10
Niggas like me push lines
Niggas like me getting that ime
Got clothes, hot man, niggas need to dry
Pray for my niggas everyday world wide
Type of real niggas out the game with the flame
Real solid niggas walk miles in the rain
Got a couple bodies, he ain't ever said a thing
People know he smacced and is still glorious crazy
Niggas mind i'ma go hit the Navy
Fighting this war, ain't nobody trying to save it
Niggas in this hood posted like the alligators
Kill a bitch nigga if he violating my family
Real niggas understand I pitch two Glocks at your family
You feel me?, you guys better catch it, Know what i'm saying?
Home wreaker, home wreak ya
Bitch
