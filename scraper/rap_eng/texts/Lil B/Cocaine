Cocaine
I'll show you real cocaine
Sunshine no rain
Voice like the Pyrex
Pen is the projects
I can do ad-libs
16 bar verse
Make the chorus stretch out
Numb my tongue verse licks
Went to New Zealand
He-Man, I am
35,000, 12,000 get a nice verse
Damn I'm on the rise
Columbia high I vibe
Damn I see casinos that represents my power
Kilo what they call me
I bring a lot of pain to your local neighborhoods
And I play a lot of games
And the haters cop so you know they say a lot of names
And I done see the picture so I had to switch the frame
Then I had to switch my name
Lil B, Lil Boss
BasedGod, BasedLord
8uwin, Berkeley Boss
Cocaine is on my mind
And I'm not talking bout the dope
And I'm not glorying drugs I'm just saying that I'm coke
Cocaine
Real shit Lil B
Based God I'm cocaine
Waterfront West Berkley
Ya heard me
Hunnid thousand nigga
Hunnid million
Ya heard me
