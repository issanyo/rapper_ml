[Hook]
Berkeley, that's where I stay

[Verse 1]
1989 when I was born
Thanks mom and dad for making me yours
I don't care what the news say cause it's okay
So I put on my clothes and started my day
I walked outside and took a breath
Cause when you from the hood you gotta watch your step
I look to the left and look to the right
Walking Telegraph on Friday night
You could hear the bass when you're in the place
I made this song for every race
Light up your joint and sip your wine
And don't worry, it'll be just fine
We chilling high as Mount Rushmore
Yeah baby I'm the drug store
We in downtown Berkeley
I'm not rich but I'm working

[Hook]
Berkeley, that's where I stay

[Verse 2]
This is verse 2, it's better than my first
It's a Sunday so why would I curse
I said roll your joints and light your weed
I'm fresh off work so let's get keyed
I hip and I hop, I rock and I roll
It's getting late so let's go home
You could live in the woods or stay in the hood
When I throw a party, it's all good
You're invited, even on the guest list
So read your text message
I'll send you directions
My address, where's the affection
I'm looking for a girlfriend
I don't wanna be alone when the world end
When I'm in Richmond I drive Lexus
Worldwide from Cali to Texas

[Hook]
Berkeley, that's where I stay

[Verse 3]
This is verse 3 and you made it through
I love when she wears those Daisy Dukes
I'm looking for a girl with a mind and a heart
It's not about sex, that's the lamest part
Who can I trust in this world of lies
When you want the truth, I'm a stand up guy
So we slip and slide, and we rock the boat
Rule number one, just make sure it float
Turn the lights on when I'm in the room
I'm a superstar like MF DOOM
The party don't stop, it's all night long
So rock your body, rock-rock your body
Save the dance for me and you
If you accept, that'd be cool
Cause I think you're cute and you think I'm fine
So what you think? Girl be mine

[Hook]
Berkeley, that's where I stay
