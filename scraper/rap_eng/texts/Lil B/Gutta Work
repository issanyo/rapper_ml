[Intro]
Ay nigga give me that man?
What the fuck is yo problem man?
Ay man, you know what im sayin?
Ay slap that nigga in the back of the head
And give me them rocks nigga
Slap that shit out his mothafuckin mouth
Hit that nigga like that
What the fuck is you?
Give me that shit nigga, that's mine now nigga

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I took loss after loss and I still bounced back
Niggas put me on tabs like I gave you that
If you wanted me to have it
Why you giving me credit?
Niggas playing for things while I'm moving to get it
Bitch I'm making history, let's be specific
First artist in the world, one man, one mission
All in a nigga brain, I'm just gutter
Before rap I was tripping, 10 felonies
Niggas taking chances, slippin
Almost got raped by the game, had to step back
The streets no love in the game
I took a lot of losses, damn
And I still had to play
Born with the pain and I still had to stay
This is here man, I'm talking about the game
Inside my mind shit just fuck with your brain
Fuck them niggas, it's a whole lot of pain

[Hook x4]
It's fuck niggas to the core
And fuck bitches to the core
It's fuck niggas to the core
And fuck bitches to the core

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I'm conceited, can't believe me
No records, no T.V., you can't see me
The hood love me
Suburbs love, all of me, this real money
Put you niggas in a bucket
Drive ya ass up to school to get that money
When a nigga in the world don't forget that money
I was trapping all day in that all white plastic
Front seat, some suckas man I had to tax em
I love fronting zips cause I for sho have em
I front more zips than a coat
Niggas playin games
I seen a sucka before
Niggas talk shit, but most niggas don't go
I'ma stand here till the day that I'm old
You gotta be cool cause them niggas is on
I'm taking niggas out the game
Fuck niggas to the core
And treat these bitches the same
Niggas beat me up then they died, ok!
That's karma, I just stay in my lane

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin?
05 Fuck Em man
I ain't tryin to be no bully on these niggas man
Niggas just love me
I'm a short nigga man
You know what I'm sayin?
How am I a boss nigga?
How do a nigga call shots man?
I'm a short skinny nigga man
But niggas love me though man
You know what I'm sayin?
Gutter shit though
You know what I'm sayin?
That's what happens when you put in work man
When you put in work, niggas love you
05 about puttin in that work
That gutter shit though
Gutter gutter work, gutter work man
You know what I'm sayin?
Lil B man, gutter work, straight up
