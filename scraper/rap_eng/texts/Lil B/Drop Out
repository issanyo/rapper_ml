[Intro]
You think this shit funny bitch start talking shit
You down on your luck mother fuckers start hating
It’s Lil B

[Verse 1]
In a world where been poor get you knocked up
Not too much crimes but not too many outlaws
Stress of life got me feeling like worth
15 hours a day with four dollars of pay
Feel to go hit the gun range and go blow off some steam
Had to turn my check to the pin and lost leaves
Turn to drugs and I dare mere who am I
Cause the mirror want to lie to me
Feel like everyday a tragedy
One day my girl love me the next day she mad at me
I ain’t rich so she want to talk shit
So the belief is backwards dumb bitch she lucky
I will know her the fuck out and your brother bitch
I shoot them ten bullets in his face
And now I’m calling the fagot with a stick up his ass
You dumb bastards
Keep thinking thoughts that will hold you back
I got a new plan to evict the rats
You got to pick up where you left at
You got to pick up where you left at
You know am saying your mind go crazy
Up and down every situation is just how you going
What's the real

[Hook]
Drop out sometimes I just drop out
I live my own life I find my own rout
Drop out sometimes I just drop out
I live my own life I find my own rout
Live my own life find my own rout
I live my own life find my own rout
I Drop out sometimes I just drop out
Live my own life I find my own rout

[Verse 2]
You came so far but you can’t accept that
To get help the best help is to help yourself
You give yourself and then you watch yourself
I confront anybody that talk down
Most people gets left in the lost and found
You might have got lost but you have not been found
I got so many problems that I hold in
Face them first and then you turn gold in
Trying to deceive and then trying to force the growth
Stay true to my soil and now my trees are growing
From my roots everybody watch their steps
Every goal that I set was to rep the set
On my worst days I still rep the west
The east and south and the north too
Even in bad weather I’m a see it through
Kansas city what’s up I believe in you
Trees don’t grow on your birthday
Keep it real they might blossom on your worst day
Keep everything right nappy hair cause its
Combing for the sunlight Lil B

[Hook]
Drop out sometimes I just drop out
I live my own life I find my own rout
Drop out sometimes I just drop out
I live my own life I find my own rout
Live my own life find my own rout
I live my own life find my own rout
I Drop out sometimes I just drop out
Live my own life I find my own rout
