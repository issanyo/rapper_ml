[Intro]
All my life...
I done told you I'll be alright...
Yea, Angels Exodus, it's Lil B

[Hook]
My life, I done told you
I done cried all night
But don't worry gonna be based for life

[Verse 1]
Man my heart is hurt from the past of hurt
Trying to stay real
Shit we never learned, maybe I will
The truth set me free
My mom told me
If suckers hate, keep moving
Battle scars, inducted into man-hood
Niggas never learn things
Market for success and fakers
Devilish, rude and hatred
Transfer through the music
Some is amusement to listen to it
Morning time, your brain is fresh absorbing all the sounds at a clear psych
I'm not surprised niggas is still dying
The music we feeding
And teaching to the younger people the reason
For bleeding
Jail and pistols, they hug the block, the children hug their mothers
No where to defend a lost cousin
For lost thugging
Their time is coming

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Nigga I keep it real
Nigga I keep it real
Promise that, thinking about the meals
When I didn't have no meals
Niggas is scarred foreal
But I will follow the older niggas that resemble features
See they movement interact
I grew older my mind's different, taking chances
Some people died
I couldn't believe the day I cry
I'm sadder and I'm madder than ever
I Gotta get it together
I'm thinking with no honor
Bushido blade I'm way beyond it
Niggas whine in America
It's faker and dumping they problems
And watching from the outside
I took myself out the picture
Started seeing from the eyes of the people
Suckas is evil
Angels Exodus

[Hook]
