[Intro]
Yeah I'mma tell you man I seen a lot a shit man you feel me
That shit will turn ya real either sour or pure whatever
Ya feel me I’m talking about this shit will make you love the world
But it’ll make you see shit real

[Verse 1]
Niggas seen what I seen bitch I’m dramatized I looked death in his eyes
I’m a tell you what I seen niggas did jail time for greed
More bricks in the streets to supply the fiends
Don’t nobody know what my conscious needs
I’m stressed out nigga I’m stressed the fuck out
Almost 25 staying at mom house
I caught a case and then he caught a case
Thought it’s a game how I’m changing face
I was born black I can’t change my race
I’m positive real talk I’m a see what my options is
Seen hood niggas that’s flexin’ mayback
I ride Bentley Coupe with a Oakland A’s hat
Let niggas know that I rep the bay
Lil B shout out to LA and Jacka man that shits foreal
Plane talks man we never take that back
All the drugs that I did…. Never
Still in the streets like the Panthers back
Like Marcus Book Store and Ginger Bread House
Lil B man I put the lead in ya mouth
Shout out to RobLo and the Husalah
Ya feel me I didn’t know I’d survive the struggle
Keep my head up through the stormy weather
Man the world on my back all this pressure
How I’m worldwide and I ain’t sold no records
Man my name Lil B I’m the sea
100K for a verse I don’t rap for free
But I give rap bitch pay tax for me
It’s the world man they backin’ me
I’m a Japanese man imagine what’s in the back of me
I take shots bitch like a daiquiri
Nigga ain’t no limit like Master P
Fuck what I seen I seen a lot of bullshit
Things will turn ya make ya turn blue
But it really ain’t that ya feel me
I’m finna bring the Bay back
Niggas stay with the classic way above average Lil Boss

[Hook]
Bitch Mob!!!
That meant the nigga hold the strap
That made a nigga watch his back
I started yelling fuck the world
(Fuck you)
That made a nigga hold the strap
That made a nigga watch his back
I started yelling fuck the world

[Outro]
