[Verse 1]
My priorities got me hand in hand with the authorities
Trying to break the law and break their jaws
Stick to myself I can’t stick to the trap
Tape on my back got me sticking to a trap
Can’t forget my dreams ain’t no turning back
Tryin to cut me short but I’m focused on stacks
Black on black crime on black on black money
White man face on this black man money
Trying to relax and sit back on an island
Rhyme first the other shit comes second
Let me show you a tour of how I’m living in the message
Back to back tours passport got stamped
I’m the hit man your best friend got jammed
Do the same thing trying to sharpen my skills
Seeing new views got to move to the hill
So dope for thrills if I keep working
Do things I never thought
Fuck fake friends anythings can be thought
Only a few live but strict cold my cousins my brother
Life’s on the line I go for the team
Digging million dollar dream mansion unseen
Still in the hood I got to make mistakes
Never second beakers he turned great
You gotta have it in you want to see the top
Can’t be perfect I take everything I got
I can’t be stupid the smart thing to do
Every time time I feel like it's stormy sea

[Hook]
Every time every time I fail I keep getting stronger
The comeback real most days I don’t even care
But I’m so happy you still here
Every time every time I fail I keep getting stronger
The comeback real most days I don’t even care
But I’m so happy you still here

[Verse 2]
Keep fucking up and my blood run thicker
Thinking to myself we some wild ass niggas
Far from a nigga I’m only a man
Everyone’s a nigga not just a black man
Everytime I come hand in hand with the truth
Nothing comes easy not even the truth
Trying to motivate stop going
Learning everyday and even on the corner
Can’t be perfect that pride is talking
Seeing true love when your eyes start walking
Time flies like Mac Miller says
Life’s too good I can’t believe I’m not dead
Life makes you think about all the good stuff
People make you think about when you are messed up
I ain’t got money am I still rich
Nightmare telling me I won’t be shit
Trying to feed my soul without having loopholes
Life’s too good know who’s whole
Just want to go home I just want to go home
Lil B yea

[Hook]
Every time every time I fail I keep getting stronger
The comeback real most days I don’t even care
But I’m so happy you still here
Every time every time I fail I keep getting stronger
The comeback real most days I don’t even care
But I’m so happy you still here
