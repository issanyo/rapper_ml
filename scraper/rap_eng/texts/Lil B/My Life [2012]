This that new Bitch Mob mixtape
Shout out to pepperboy in Arkansas
Shouts out to Nas you feel me

Long nights niggas never gave a fuck
Dirty ass room, no new draws
Niggas mad cuz i got my way out the system
I did probation, i did ankle monitor
I did house arrest, i did 12 steps
I did drug class, i did counseling
I did every fucking thing that the courts asked me
I did youth court, i paid restitution
One man with a plan it was so polluted
Niggas fell off I had to bounce back
Shit change when a young nigga ghetto platinum
Used to be a robber but the game checked me
Juvinile life I cudda done 30 years
In the courtroom my momma cried 30 tears
My whole life in the hands of the fucking jury
Juvinile felon, didn't need a weapon
Run through hood solo, people houses
Lord please forgive me, Im already cursed
Niggas totin semis, obscene for the glist and glamour
Posted in the hood they pulled a shotgun on me
Niggas had a mask and a orange scraper
Seen it in the eyes, uh you feel me
Niggas talk that pistol talk but dont wanna die
Shotgun to the chest them boys drove off
Another day in the hood get you broke off
When you Bitch Mob you don't trip off them suckas
Nigga punched me, nigga robbed me but I still love ya
Tiny pants, new look but I'm still thuggin
B town boys you know that we still hustlin
Reppin Westside till my muthafuckin grave
I rep the world, all the trill niggas around the way
If you ain't real, then I tote that K
You can see the picture when you inside the frame
When I get it off, it ain't a fucking game
Couple dudes doin life and you paid the price
Free Young Bruh, they done took his life
You can ask I ain't neva been a playa hater
Nigga I got fucking pain in my fucking brain
Many dope fiend rentals no fucking cane
I go anywhere nigga ask my fuckin name
Nigga been solid, since nigga Im solid
Nigga front it, and Im smokin and Im still shoppin x2
