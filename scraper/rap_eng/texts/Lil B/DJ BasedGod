[Verse One]
I walk in the party and the crowd gets loud
Everybody wants to hear my new freestyle
I scratch and I rap, I rap for the scratch
It's a dog eat dog world, not the Cat in the Hat
I kicked a couple flows on the microphone
All the people scream, "We don't wanna go home!"
I look at my watch and I check the time
It's a quarter to 8, now kick that rhyme
I'm a rack and a rapper, an entrepreneur
I'm a d-boy hangin' at the corner store
This the West Coast, we go dumb
Get a couple homies and have some fun
Music get you high, we don't need no drugs
I'm a gangsta, I don't need your hugs
Now let's breakdance and spin these hits
It's a new DJ named BasedGod, bitch

[Verse Two]
Turn the music up, we want it loud
I perform outside, and rock the crowd
Shaquille O'Neal not bigger than me
I'm the worldwide artist named Lil B
I'm seasoned and that's the reason
These girls come around and start cheesin'
They know I'm great
Ay girl, stop talking, you're not Ricki Lake
I'm a rap star, under the lights
Call my homeboys if you want to fight
But I'm nice, I'm not violent
That's why I started rhymin'
I love hip-hop
And light up your joint because the party don't stop
Girls make your hips rock
My name's Lil B and I saved hip-hop

[Verse Three]
Catch me on the subway in New York
Can't miss the train 'cause my show finna start
I'm skippin' the lines, I'm not wasting my time
I go on in five minutes, I can't miss a dime
Why you look sad? You fresh off work
You should come to my party if your head don't hurt
I'm going to Harlem and then to the Bronx
Spit your best lyrics, and then you can come
I'm ridin' down Broadway, fly as hell
I'm a smooth young man, so watch yourself
I'm a lion in the jungle
And rap is my hustle
I love hip-hop
I thank God every day that I never stopped
And now I'm the man
And I'm the DJ with the mic in my hand

DJ…DJ…
