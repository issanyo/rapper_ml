[Intro]
Yes
Green Flame
Just let me vent out

[Verse 1]
Gonna have to cut the cake any way that you slice it
Man, this struggle in the ghetto keeps the world excited
While the Glock keep it lit, push the safety for violence
Man, the victims hurts more when your life is misguided
My eyes to the streets while I wear these glasses
Things hidden from the world, these battery acid
But they can't fuck with me lyrically, go ask 'em
I passion more times than the government passes
Why you walk and can't breathe? Your life is in plastic
Seen killers having dead eyes, red eyes
Bags under their eyes, they're packing for death
I watch every step because niggas be looking for reps
Imaginary reps, no jobs, but repping the set
Got fired off work, no government check
Another funeral, when you gonna learn about that turn route?
The same time niggas came in and got burned out
I light a candle for the spiritual
Niggas still sleeping on me, it's like a miracle
You only get one life, dog, I'm double daring
I hope you stay protected because the streets are not scared of you
Put a value on life before you compare me to any other rappers, them humans is uncomparable
I'm still up in the house with the dirty sink, bath rust, shit, how I stay clean?
The same way I hit the streets and stay clean
Inside out, dirty outside, I'm looking mean
You can fit 100,000 in some skinny jeans
Just a slave, that's the only thing that life means
It's that to see people go down with life dreams
I'm still walking the same streets I did in 93
Niggas right behind me, I give 'em the whole nine, please
Too many people hope, and they're relying on me
Damn, shit's real, they're relying on me
If you gotta say I kill it, man, I gotta write you, please
Write with the hollow tips that I rap with
I'm going through the pen, man, the persons involved
And they always, I let my mama do the shopping and all
Because I can see her outside when you was dropping me off
So I hit the streets, dog
Damn, there ain't no problems at all
When you grow up, you slow up, niggas get thirsty
I got love for my young niggas, but they try to jerk me
Hate me, up in they mind, they started to, shit, irk me
Putting niggas through surgery, fix your face
My face is like the wind of summer, out of place
Fuck you suckers
Fuck 'em
Green Flame, we on it
