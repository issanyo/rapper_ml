[Intro]

[Verse 1]
American heart, Nubian skin
If I known what I knew now I would probably be saved
It's the based world pain, Based world paradise
Looking through a new lens, my life is run by masculine
My life is run by adrenaline, My brain is the key piece
Nubian kings we at war, America we at war
But my opinion is coming from a place of...
I love life so much and history hates us
But where's the information? I'm learning, calculating
Scientific scriptures, people living off my vision
We got too many soldiers, Who's going to be the lieutenant?
Or the orchestrator? Who going to be player or coach?
Shit, I'm taking them both!
Player is coach, Niggas ain't mad
I'm seeing thoughts i never had
The whole race want a leader and I lead it
The proofs in the pudding, I'm real but who's Jesus?
I believe in god, I love my own spirit
I pray in the church even though I'm not Christian
I know The BasedGod, He as real as it gets
Had to pull my pants up because I never been gay
I don't need to use violence, I just use my brain
Cause when you break it down, humans all is the same
I don't got to explain, I make sure that I love educating the youth
I make sure that I would, Make sure that I could
Trip out sometimes cause I'm not right
My heart is in a pure place, That's why I'm the rawest
BASED WORLD PARADISE, BASED WORLD PARADISE
I won't hide, no more, My smiles on
I'm happy now, My frown's upside down
You can't control that, (Nah)
Money, Nah I won't control that
As long as you're educated you could work a 9 to 5
I control rap, Rapping 9 to 5 like FEDEX
What your fucking box say? A lot of things
Tell Mr. Phoenix I want a Phoenix
You know we gonna see this, I'm so based
Switch me to 10th speed, Get close to the ground
I'm far, Man I never wear a helmet
Taking chances when I ride, Feel the hearts one day at a time
Money won't buy you this, I was born for a purpose
No matter how many lives
Some say that he weak I think he is fine
Cause when you're from the hood we just getting by
KRS-1, Public Enemy, Studied the greats
Where we at today no excuses for it
Basedworld Paradise, Come here and live your life
You could walk around at night, You don't gotta look twice
It's alright, Put your headphones on
You're safe with me, We building the hearts, It all starts from Lil B
Basedworld Paradise, We all in the game
My attitude has to change, promoting unhealthy ways
It's not my fault, TV's and the movies
Before I could even read, I was out watching movies
A lot of cartoons, Until I started getting older
Seen some titties, Aliens fucked, The world's colder
If you choose to love, Protect them with your soul
And I'm still, These people ungrateful
Forgotten the person who raised them, You feel me?
This is a fucking lottery, This is what I say man
Got to do it for yourself, Fuck the law is what I say
I'm here on the contract, Social security is the loan
Renew my license, Another contract, What you think about that?
Basedworld Paradise, We don't lie we up front
I live for the future because my past is brutal
Can't compute it, Can't teach in the class to the students
Gotta be based to feel the music
