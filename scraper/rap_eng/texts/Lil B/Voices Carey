[Lil B]
I feel like Im all alone
Voices carey
In my mind, it makes me feel.. like I need to kill

[Verse 1]
You can never stop me Im a monster
Strapped with the chopper, something like ??
Use em not an option I come through with dreads like a rasta
Heart filled with anger you see it from my posture
Rap niggas fake give a fuck about an Oscar
I read 'To Die a Legend' smokin blunts with the flatscreen
Travel around the world see If you can catch me
Thank you for the blessing, can't nothing stress me
Only thing that gets me is pussy, then I hate pussy
Then I cut em off like a rookie
Come on my court jump shot with the hooky
Come on my court you're gettin' punched like Snookie
You're a pop culture, yeah I'm a vulture
I done viewed things in the basement sofa
Put a few bullets in your brains like emotions
Come around my block I'll show you things that you supposed to

[Hook]
In the back of my mind I'm hearing voices carry
Suckas hating on me but Im never scary
Voices carey make me kill bitches
Voices carey make me deal wit ya

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
Lets be real we ain't got the same problems
I was born with dark skin, automatic drama
Not complaining just saying what it is partna'
Niggas tryna split my wig over some fuckin' diamonds
Fuck em all that AK leave their seat reclining
And I got a bulletproof bitch Im Jesus rhyming
I ain't tryna disrespect just unleash the giant
Unleash the beast underground Im a fuckin tyrant
Niggas hear me but they still don't comprehend
Wanna talk down on me like I'm under them
But understand If the chosen one is other than
Me I might as well say let the fun begin
Raekwon holla at me got some jewels to give
Mos Def holla at me I respect your mind
?? Holla at me mane its work to do
Nas yeah shit I really look forward to
Lupe holla at me got some work to do
Jay Z holla at me got some beats for you
G Dep hit me up I respect your shit
DMX mane you say some of the realest shit
Birdman holla at me mane you G'd up
I rep Berkeley so you know I got my B's up
Its a lot of real niggas I ain't into neither
Glock 10 have you lookin' like cousin skeeter
BasedGod got cold had to dump the heater
All you niggas talkin' down you ain't gon make it neither
Take a minute out your day and listen to my shit
If you listen listen I'll teach you how to fuck a bitch
You hater
BasedGod nigga
