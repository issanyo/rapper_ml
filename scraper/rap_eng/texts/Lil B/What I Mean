[Ice T sample]

[Intro: Lil B]
Yesss
It's your boy Lil B

[Verse 1: Lil B]
This nigga riding clean, tinted windows on the scraper
Fuck you, pay me is what I tell the [?]
You ain't got your mind right if it's pussy over paper
Paper over pussy cause chick I'm the mayor
The man of the hour, Lil B came to blaze 'em
Like the Trailblazers I balled and I phase 'em
Vans on my feet so they know that I'm a baller
Cash for the verses and pussy just to call her
Yesss, and they know that I'm the best
Brraang thang all across the chest
It's Berkeley on mind, California til I rest
And I gotta make a mil, stash it off in the chest
Fuck you, pay me is what I tell the rest
It's the Pack til the death, young bitch I'm fresh
Lil B for Lil Boss put the game on ice
Monday night football and I don't see those lights
It's my game

[Interlude: Lil B]
You know check me out baby
You know what I mean
I can make you feel how you never felt
But I didn't mean to say that
It's just... come fuck with me
You know everything I'm about to say
You know what I mean

[Verse 2: Lil B]
You so sick, let me be your doctor
Your man just screaming and I can be the opera
Whatever I want, cash ain't a option
You see what I'm doing and you see why I'm popping
Get it real good, even friends with your partners
Your momma love me too and she said I'm like dollars
Take cash in delivery
But I don't trick off, giving shit wasn't into me
See girl I'm not your enemy
Just tryna get into you
Shit I'm long like a centipede
I'm like a dream in reality
A nigga so real but a nigga so chill
So sit back while we cruise in the backseat
Pipe game real have 'em running like a track meet
Dripping like a faucet, think her name was Ashley
[?] she always gotta tell me

[Outro: Lil B]
Yeah, you know I got you baby
You know, you know my name's B
No not B nigga, Lil B
Lil Boss you know what I mean
Yeah check me out like always
Like we all good
Alright baby
