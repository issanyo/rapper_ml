[Verse 1: Lil B]
I’ma show you Wayne Gretzky
Hundred grand show, so you never disrespect me
Now a nigga fuck around I’ma show you who the bitch be
Bitch I’m based god I don’t need you to accept me
You’re not from the streets bitch I saw you even check me
Then I came back, then them niggas started to respect me
I’m a young pretty bitch and them suckers really hate that
I’m really bout that life, in a fucking Oakland A's Hat
Fuck that, they can’t fuck with me
Product of the block, I was raised down on 6th street
Pity ass niggas hatin' on me but they love me
I don’t give a fuck, I’m thugged out, bitches keep playing
You feel me?
I’m the based god, last time I heard
I was the man around the fucking god
I don’t give a fuck, I still got the world
Fucking with the mac, I’ma take you to that world

[Outro]
Pink flame mixtape, I don’t know if the world ready
Lil B, Basedworld
It’s time to take over the world
