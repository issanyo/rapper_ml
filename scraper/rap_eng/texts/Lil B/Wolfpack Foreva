Lil B, yeah you know that based world shit
We stay locking, We to the top
On my life, we in the game, alright

[Verse 1]
Got a major pusher, but still i need to push up
When the dope kush up it look like kusha
But it dont burn that lock like Pusha
Got alot of problems im still not a puss, uh
Fuck them suckas that kill over nothing
Im a die for me, Im a live for peace
Im a hold the streets when niggas got the beef
Im educated, Im a shoot for warning
I won't have my gun the same place as the dope
Im a rap and slang dope, dope like my rap
Cocaine comrade, cocaine dope sack, fat bitch hold that
Cover my back, color me bad

[Verse 2]
I was thinking about the guns i've rented
Hoes i fucked, money i lost, man im timid
Some people think my lifes a gimmick
Some people think my life is rented, God forgive them
But i won't, cause i ll rob and strip them
Might even call my mobs to them
Cause im a gangstas, got gangsta ties
Gangsta ties, suits and hats, ties and nines
You can even see the coupe was mines
No money? You wastin' my time
Niggas be wastin' my time
Won't debate this, state is mine
Court cases in line, in my hood..
