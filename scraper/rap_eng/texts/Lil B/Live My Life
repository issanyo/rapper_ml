[Intro]
It's your boy Lil B making history
Shoutout to the Based god

[Hook]
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Put your hands up if you live your life
Some days are wrong, some days are right
Walk down the street, I'm alone that night
Don't care about the fame, don't care about the hype
Won't buy chains, I don't need your ice
Won't buy cars, I don't need those nights
I don't care about your shoes
Who are you?
Who am I? Does it matter to you?
Look kinda lost, that makes us two
So many girls, just one life
Hollywood or Beverly Hills
Fake love, don't know what's real
No doctor I don't need those pills
Talk to me, I tell you how I feel

[Hook]
No I'm not alright
I'm tryna live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life

[Interlude]
One life to live
Let's live it up

[Bridge]
Hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Stand up

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Runnin' up tryna ask for pictures
Pause I don't know you Mr
I really wanna talk to your misses
Muh-wa, and I blow her kisses
Really wanna see if she a nympho
Really tryna get her info
Sometimes I don't know who I am
A white man trapped in a black man
Black man trapped in a white man
Trapped in the middle of a Sprite can
Sometimes I think that I am, I think I'm Superman
But I'm not tryna be a hero
Tryna find out what we here for

[Hook]
We gon' find in time
I'm tryna live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life
I'm gon' live my life

[Bridge]
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Stand up, stand up, stand up
Hands up, hands up
Stand up, stand up
Hands up, hands up
Go, go
Hands up, hands up
Stand up, stand up
Stand up, hands up
Live my life, life my life
Everyday
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Stand up, stand up

[Outro]
