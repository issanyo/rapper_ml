[Intro]
Shouts out to my guitarist
Red flame devil music
You know I love y'all and I just gotta keep it real
It's how I feel sometimes
Yeah

[Verse]
Will you remember me?
A centipede a lot of legs
A lot of bread
I ran a lot of marathons
Still hot I'm still young
Livin' reckless, outta my mind
People respect it
I'm like check it
Count the blessings
Erase the suckers time on time
Makin' hustles
Had to play and struggle
Beat the bosses and take losses
Had to bounce back harder than ever
Once shit crosses
Over my dead body
This based body shotty through eight bodies
Prodigy, jeans probably
Niggas try and stop it
Gettin' Oscars
Mob boss lil boss
Tryin' to find my way through
Manuever
Way past the sharks cuttin' niggas off
Like a doctor
Surgical the way I take it off 'em
Coming with the dufflebag the same color as coffee
In my hood we gotta hear this
Like killas in Marcy
Not glorifyin' the hood
But this shit'll pause 'em
Niggas is killin' little kids in drive-bys, you salty
I don't respect your game
I got rules and I start 'em
I used to smoke my own dope
Sell a zip and charge 'em
It's that hustle, my hustle, its the customers
Cops who bust it up for celebration
For the growth the save they self
Hittin' licks solo
I'm good by my damn self
Fuck niggas I swear to god
Fake killas play life chess pieces
Fuck being the realist
Niggas is iller
And I still kill it
But I'm the illest and I'm the realest
To ever do it
This is way past music
Nigga this is some Moses on the track
Nigga watch me do it
Lil Boss

[Outro]
