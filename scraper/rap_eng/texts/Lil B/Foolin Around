You know a lot of niggas be getting Knocked off to the game
You feel me?
I know a lot of young niggas
That be dying for no reason
Making mistakes in the game
You know this hood lifestyle, this
Do you feel me?
Like they're trapped, you know the cold to the books all that shit man it's a
Just runnin around just to get you get locked up
And you feel me to take the forty to fifty
Do you feel me?
R.I.P
A lot of niggas die
I know a lot

The boy want to come up, he talking bout doubling up
He stay sipping the double cup, he even play with other stuff
People in his ear sayin' bro you don't do enough
And he worried about keeping up
Long nights no sleep from
Lying to these girls made them sour
Make em like girls, but they don't really like girls
But niggas in they life was
Scareless to the point, straight to the point
Look when he point, he got the kind of swag
You know that he cat
He thinking he need more, one night he made up a plan
That's cutthroat, he had a couple friends, they had a couple things
He made a master plan, and the rule was greed
He was gonna rob his best friend with the mask and the beenie
The day after that he got a plan to sell fake weed
To out of town town people
This shit is crazy people
Its motivated by the evil
You see a shady vibe, you look equal
He killed a few people, still acting like we equal
Bought a couple whips
But that ain't shit, if you see through
He live his whole life in competition with the next
Last time I heard he got blasted in the chest
Life gets cold if you don't love others
How I'm gonna grow if I wanna kill my
Brother
How I'm gonna love your family like my mother
This real street game, never sell out your brother
My niggas die

It's Lil B
A lot of niggas die
Yes, yeah a lot of niggas die

RIP all my niggas that make mistakes
But they ain't getting back from now
You know all my motherfuckers you're trying to lick pull the cable
And they getting back from that
You know they're doing that time
And they you know knock down the laws
This thugging shit
It's just a high up, a plan to keep you
And keep the cops paid, you say fuck the police
You hate the police, but the police Love you
When you thuggin
You know you taking the hard time chances
Be smart, you know
Make sure you legal man
Get your money
Do what you gotta do stay positive
That's the best one
You know a lot of niggas, they got murked fooling around
And they ain't getting no second chance,
It's your boy Lil B
PYT, pretty young thug man
