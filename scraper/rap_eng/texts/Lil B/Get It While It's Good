[Verse]
$20K make me bench press
I'mma do push-ups
And never fold over
Fucking with my grind
It's mine young bitch!
Respect mine all the time
Press rewind
Lil Wayne said I'm a Lil Boss
Want that Wayne bread, never gonna leave my head
2 G's, real G's make your face bleed
Real nigga, trill niggas like Pimp C
Speak my mind, because it's free speech
Niggas scared to make a difference
Bitch I'm back for a vengeance
Didn't play much with precision
Rap like I'm making new dreams
Keep up
Top of the whole atlas
Right or wrong
Just do it boy, we living life
Autopilot fell asleep driving
I can never see what they see
It's like me times two
Money on my mind like a nosebleed
You got tricks up your sleeve?
So what?
Keep my head up high
Keep em real high
Because the money in the sky
I'm telling the truth
Said I wouldn't be in my heart
I changed my whole world
If you can only understand
What your mind can do
You would be uncomfortable
And I’m rising to the top
Nigga see the haters at the top
But I’m on the bottom just watch
I brought myself off the water
Almost drowned in the streets
But I’m now on top floor
Fuck the models in streaks
I got a bad case of legend sickness
Legend status
Went platinum on the internet
Straight cashin'
