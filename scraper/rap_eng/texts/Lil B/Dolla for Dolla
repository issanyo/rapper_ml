[Intro]
You know we just chilling man
We in the [?]
Yeah, yeah
B on the beat
It's Dolla sign D
Look

[Verse]
Sick flow, spit dope, and I get dough
I remember high school, pullin' kick-doors
Fuck hoes, couple nymphos (yeah)
And I'm fresh like Bankroll (aye)
Street nigga with a bankroll (get money)
Fuck what they charge, nigga case closed
Two door, and that check blown
Behind tint, gettin' topped on my way home
Serve me? I'ma serve him
Run it up like Guapo
In Mexico, I took another trip
Got me feelin' like Pablo
Fuck that bitch, I'ma do me
I think she love me like Lucy (she love me)
On top, nigga [?]
Easy money, 1, 2, 3

[Chorus: Lil B]
Dolla for dolla (woo, woo, woo)
Dolla for dolla, my niggas dolla for dolla (aye)
Aye, dolla for dolla (damn)
Dolla for dolla, my niggas dolla for dolla (woo, count up)
Aye, dolla for dolla
Dolla for dolla, my niggas dolla for dolla (aye)
Aye, dolla for dolla
Dolla for dolla, my niggas dolla for dolla
