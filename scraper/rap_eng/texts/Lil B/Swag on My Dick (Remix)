[Chorus: Lil B]
Bitch, take a picture, real hood nigga
Swagged up to the maximum, swag on my dick
With that bitch on my dick
Ace spoon coon, man, mother fuck a bitch


[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Bitch, I'm powered up, smokin hella purp
And I'm kushed up, high as fuck, look at my shirt
I'm swag for real, the defenition of it
Niggas got a deal, I'm the reason, bruh

And these lame ass niggas, please, get m outta here
I'm swag forever, I'm swag to death
Bitch, I'm countin money, on god, ok
Swag on my dick, 5 on my wrist

Girls know my fuckin name, 3 pistols on me
Let's make it rain, all this red on me

[Verse 2: Lil B]
