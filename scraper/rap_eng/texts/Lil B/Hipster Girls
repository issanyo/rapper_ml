Ohmigod, it's Lil B! I'm in an underground party in New York. All the hipster girls... I need all the hipster girls to come to the front, lift your shirts up, and shake your ass. All the hipster girls, shake your butt!

Hipster girls, shake your ass (8x)

Hey girls, you're mighty fine
Let me make you all mine
You look like you're a hipster --
Ohmigod, do you have a sister?
Ohmigod, do you read The Fader?
Shake your ass, thank me later

Mad Decent, Fools Gold!
Ohmigod, you're such a ho!
DIPLO! You know Lil B?
I'll tell you who he is, he's Young Based God
Hipster girls think he's the coolest guy out
Hot girls always want to let them in their house
Everyone knows about Young Based God
Hipster girls shakes their butts cause they're hot
I'm in the underground show in New York City
Dem Passwords art gallery
All the hipster girls shake your butt to the beat
My name's Lil B, I'll be here for a week
Hipster girls, throw your bras on stage
Scream "Lil B," let me hear you say my name

Hipster girls make your ass shake like jamba
In the college with an ass like her mama
Hipster girls, go 'head and shake your butt
Hipster girls, it's okay to act like a slut

Hipster girls, shake your ass (16x)

Ohmigod, it's Lil B!
Ohmigod, all the hipster girls, throw your hands in the air
Throw them in the air, throw them right now!
