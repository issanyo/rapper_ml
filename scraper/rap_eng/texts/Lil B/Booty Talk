How she gonna walk, how she gon' talk
Damn near look like her booty walk
Walking down the street like a damn freak
Girl on the phone and she talking to me
Still on the street tryna get a eat
If I can't eat then I'm gon' talk

I fucked ten bitches but that's not cool
Really, I only want one
I will knock the bitch out and smoke a blunt
I'ma pull that yoppa out on my main bitch
