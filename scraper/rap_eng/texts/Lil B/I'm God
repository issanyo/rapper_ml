[Under Intro]
How did you know? It's what I've always wanted
Can we settle down please?
Will you quit kicking me under the table?
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about this
Could never have too many of these

[Intro]
You know I always wanted to be the best
You know I always wanted to be God
This is real talk
It's Lil B, yeah

[Verse 1]
My new name is Based God, ice cream paint job
Only come out in the dim lights: vampire
Shouts out to A.E. for riding in that 6-0
Move fast, stick slow, think fast, talk slow
Dude try to play me, Iâ€™m leaving with his bitch bro
Sorry for the cuss words, fuck that, curse more
Bruh did things should've been in the Hearse fo'
Now I'm spittin' rap shit, gave me somethin' to live fo'
Hit him with the P-9, bet it'll make his ribs show
Rap game is too fake, real niggas lay low
Word around town that you livin' with a halo
Bet I got killers puttin' cash on Halo
No Xbox, shouts out to Tune, baby
Free Tune, baby, free Rocky, bitch
Free Rocky, free Rocky, bitch
Free Tune baby, bitch, free
Feel me, yuh

[Verse 2]
Bruh think I'm gay cause I'm grindin' in my tiny pants
Bet I'm the only goon nigga in these tiny pants
Sending off shots, kickback make your wrist jam
Fully-loaded thing on my arm like a wristband
You don't want the Space Jam, you're better off to vacate
No, it's no template to touch this, 6 Kiss, reckless
Hands around your neck like a necklace
Leave him screwed and chopped, have him thinking he in Texas
Nigga

[Bridge]
Yeah, you know what I mean?
The mind is so complex when you're Based, 32 Levels
Welcome to my world, like I said I been ready
And it feels good to be here now
Finally realized, who's the rawest rapper?
(Yes) Lil B

[Verse 3]
Just cause you a rich rapper don't really mean shit
I'll come to your crib and clear that whole bitch out
And then blow the swish out, my mouth put the stick out
I can't be high and robbing pussies with my dick out
I guess I'm a show-off, take my raincoat off
I'm so wet that a pussy get mad at me
Switch cars, new colors, call it raspberry
Got my own website with the dotcom
Take it out the bag, over stove like Top Ramen
I don't sell coke, my niggas look out for me
They ain't wanna let me fall off the (balcony)
That's like losing Mike Vick on the Falcon team
We a faculty, but I'm the team leader
I pass you guys, I'm in the two-seater
And what's wrong with you, this is hip-hop
This that '09 shit, I call it Based World

[Bridge]
I said I call it Based World
You know what I mean
So just to tell you, it's a wrap
To anybody that thought they had it
You need to think again
Throw your hands up, it's Lil B for Lil Boss
I need all the Based energy I can

[Verse 4]
Yeah, is this what you really want, you got me in the flesh now
No, I'm not stressed out, I'm God, I'm the best out
Rap transparent, my see-through glasses
It's incoherent, and no I'm not staring
I just see through you
And from your heartbeat you are soft in the middle
I'm real on the outside, solid in the inside, bitch, it's the Westside
Chopper in the trunk, leave em soaked like a wet slide
It's apartheid, rap game is my shit
I'm so sick, I'm feeling so nauseous
Somebody tell the Earth I'm the best now
Somebody tell the ocean I'm the best out
Somebody tell the trees I'm here now
Somebody tell the world I'm Based now
See me in outer space, I'm out of reach today
Celebrate for me, I'm Based for life
This a celebration, bitch
