"Get me out of here, get me out of here
Get me out of here"

[Lil B]
I'm trapped in the hood
Realest niggas

The dark nights make me feel unnoticed
Rain against my window
Got my life camera unfocused
My niggas got heart
Put their life on the line for a false dream
? game a bunch of false prophets
Need the black man to step it up
You ain't gotta change, but the guns shit enough
Ain't nobody dodging these bullets except us
Ain't nobody hating on niggas.. except cops
And the back-brown suckers who saying shit
Trying to blackball the God? Get your neighbors killed
Tied up with the door behind em
Licks was the only thing I knew, besides grinding
Had to face 36 and see the new life
Copping green and I told lies
The corn was a boatride
Private defender gonna die
No money then I won't fly
Niggas: think before you move
Niggas: speak before you cry
Gotta live before you die
Get me out the hood, I made it go
Lil B, I need to make it out the hood
Red Flame
This is for anybody that's stuck in the hood
