[Intro]
We just clapped the revolver, we just clapped the revolver
Red Flame, bitch! Lil B, nigga! 7th Street, bitch!
You don't wanna start no drama
Yeah, you know what the fuck it is, man, I'm back
Go download that Blue Flame mothafucking mixtape, nigga
The realest in this bitch
We just clapped the revolver, we just clapped the revolver
Give a fuck what these niggas talking 'bout, bruh
I give a fuck 'bout what the rich niggas talk about
What the broke niggas talking 'bout
You don't wanna start no drama
Lil B in this motherfucker swagged to the 800, bruh
We just clapped the revolver, we just clapped the revolver

[Verse 1]
Niggas think they can use me for promo
That's a no-go, I slide through, four-door
I got a pistol on my side like the po-po
For sure, niggas mad at me, things change, bruh
Feeling changed, too, that's the game, bruh
I ain't gon' never be the same, that's on my damn grave
I done seen some real shit at my damn age
You be dancing with the devil on the damn stage
Politics like phone calls, we out of range
Niggas treat me different now that I'm super famous
Take a note from... your broke, rip off the pages
Real goon covered up, I don't do the faces, nigga

[Outro]
You don't wanna start no drama
Bitch! Lil B, nigga
You don't wanna start no drama
The Red Flame
You don't wanna start no drama
The mixtape, nigga, hardest shit out, bruh
Hardest out, cuz, Lil B in this motherfucker, you feel me?
Red Flame, bitch! Based God, nigga!
We just clapped the revolver
Straight waterfront, bruh, you know how I'm doing
Shouts out the Wolfpack
Unh!
