[Verse 1]
I wonder about my life
27 years old but I feel five
Got 150 dollars in my bank account
And the IRS want triple the amount
What it mean to be happy in this big old dream?
When I wake up, I'm still doin' the same old thing
Help my mom pay her rent just to get by
And the only time we hang is when we sick or we cry
Yeah, I got a car but I need more gas
Feelin' like a ATM because I need more cash
Wonder what it feel like to be rich
Will I ever grow up, or remain a kid?
Sometimes I think what I do in a big house
With a yard and a fence and a big old couch
Until then, I'll be all I can be
And all the best things in life are free, follow me

[Chorus]
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Don't ever give up, just let the beat drop

[Verse 2]
If you don't have a house, the world's your home
And when you don't have a friend, you can play this song
I'm tryin' to prevent suicide
Take your suit and tie and put it to the side
Let the wind hit your face and breathe the air
Because we not scared and we don't care
Tryna find love in the strangest place
You lookin' for a sign, but it's in your face
The train don't stop, it's on the roll
Just pick up your bags and hit the road
Time to have fun and stop complainin'
The weather don't stop, it just keep on changin'
I dance with the cats and I chill with the dogs
I play with the bears and I skip the frogs
What that mean? We all can hang
And then we go to sleep and we do it again

[Chorus]
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Don't ever give up, just let the beat drop

[Verse 3]
If you don't know my name, then you know it now
My name's BasedGod and say it loud
What's my name? BasedGod
And who's the king? BasedGod
Think about who you love the most
Dedicate this song and have a toast
Your family outside chillin' with the babies
Thank you to the women 'cause your stomach saved me
Helped me grow and kept me strong
Thank you to the men because we need you all
Don't count us out or leave us in
We playin' to have fun, we not playin' to win
It's no competition, we all relax
Just throw your hands up and state these facts
You don't gotta stay if you want to leave
'Cause everybody know the best things are free

[Chorus]
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Keep goin', 'cause life don't stop
Don't ever give up, just let the beat drop
