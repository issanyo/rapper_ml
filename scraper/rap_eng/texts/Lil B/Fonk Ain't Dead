[Intro]
Like I said, we riding around the Bay right now
I was telling y'all before, it's a lot of love out here
But it's a lot of fonk going on, you feel me?
It's a lot of problems, a lot of people got a lot of problems
And they solving them

[Verse 1]
Man the flows that I spit leave niggas ecstatic
I guess that's why I spit dope, niggas kick the habit
And the pump make a niggas jump farther than rabbits
And I got slapped for the trunk man harder to manage
And you see my pockets fill with something greener than cabbage
I get cheaffured around man I sleep in the carriage
The shots that I flow leave your body like Mary
Never leave my gun man you think I was married
And I'm a cold nigga, man, picture me Harry
And... cause sorcerer's stone like Harry
I'm a Pot-head, niggas ask me twice, man, I never been scary
Before I take yo life man I call you like a Jerry
Niggas calling out your life man, I'm feelin' your family
Bitch niggas wonder how you can't stand me
I guess I'm Manny, like a tool I'm all fine and dandy
See your daughter screaming "Mom, I miss my Daddy!"
You fucking bitch

[Hook]
Man, that fonk ain't dead
Bitch niggas ain't scared
I ain't never been mad, bitch, that fonk ain't dead
Putting pressure on a bitch, show him what it is
Putting pressure on a bitch, show him what it is

[Verse 2]
Thugged out like them boys down in PC
Home made hand guns, believe me
Eating fonk like, it ain't right
BasedWorld, keep it positive some might
Try to put you in the grave cause they jealous
But I will hold a MAC like a ho who is selling
Niggas try to ho me cause I'm not Too $hort
But the game in my court
Uh, bitch why you step this before
Man, quit acting bitch you will never, before and
BasedWorld, we will never steer you wrong
Uh, and motherfucking drawn
Can't respect niggas, you a motherfucking dope dealer
Flexing on this shit, you a motherfucking ho nigga
I don't respect no bitch niggas
I don't respect that nigga, or this nigga
It's Lil Boss

[Hook]
Man, that fonk ain't dead
Bitch niggas ain't scared
I ain't never been mad, bitch, that fonk ain't dead
Putting pressure on a bitch, show him what it is
Putting pressure on a bitch, show him what it is
