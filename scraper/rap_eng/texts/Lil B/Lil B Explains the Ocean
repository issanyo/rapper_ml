I'm back
Listen to the ocean as I speak
As I come back into your heart
Let me flow through your system, your soul, your spirit
Close your eyes and let the colors take over
Lil B, BasedGod
BasedLord, BasedOverlord, I'm here
The ocean is here, and I'm here to flow
Know that one day we'll all be taken
And the beautiful light and the beautiful color
Open fields, plant life
Amazing, this is amazing
I see the colors right now
Purple, green, blue, yellow, transparent colors are around us everywhere
Be ready
This is amazing and it's beautiful
I told you and I promise
