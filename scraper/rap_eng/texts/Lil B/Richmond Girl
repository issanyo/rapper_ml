[Verse 1]
Girl, you look so good
Why you out for a cruise?
You be on some thang
Tryna make her bad
And why you dressin' like that?
Cause you don't know how to act
You be in high school
You should be workin' on rules
She really wants me
She really wants to believe
That I ain't want her
But I know that ain't gon work
She started grabbin' on my hands
And then I said that I want to be a man
And I don't care what they say
And just let this all play

[Hook]
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
Aye girl, let it go
Aye girl, let it go
Aye girl, let it go
Aye girl, let it go

[Verse 2]
When I walked in the street
So many girls on me
Then she wants dick deep
And I know she a freak
Girl, I like the way you walk
And I like the way you talk
We can go to the mall
We ain't gotta go far
All I want to do is dance
Girl, we'll spend a hundred bands
Girl, I'm your biggest fan
I just want you to understand
I don't want to play games
I just want to know your name
I know who you are
You look like a superstar

[Hook]
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
Aye girl, let it go
Aye girl, let it go
Aye girl, let it go
Aye girl, let it go
