We too silent, based world, we all soldiers
I'm the reason you got your deal bitch, asap
On his dick girl, she love that basedgod
I still rock with the ak
Niggas like me, I pull up
Bitch you never spray, you never rock how I rock
That sell block, that dope block, that never give a fuck no security
That's how I rock, never break the click we stay style until the jump street
Shout outs to [?] that water run real deep
It's funny how our niggers try and sneak this
Weak bitch, I can hear it in that bullshit
You're never in the pol pit
Shouts out to HotNewHipHop and Digital Drip
I got a shotgun the same size as a small keep
Never let it get to me, boy I made history
Never gonna do what I done, it's a mystery
People live in misery, I don't respect your game bitch
I got them rear vibes from your squad, shit
That's why I hold a chopper nigga, man down
Defense, learn from the people, now I eat [?]
Never breathe, but how you gonna read my book
I'm a tell you nigga this, don't be a crook
You [?] to get your arm cut, like the thieves do
In America, boy this is a war zone
Base with an army, and a navy
Got get your chrome, we silent bitch
We don't even need the guns, no mass [?]
This is all before the deal, I still ain't got a deal
Because I don't want one, niggers going for cheap, not me
I'm moving 2 guns, got holler respect so
I want the cool one, but I'm feel to go to college
I'm feel and learn what I want, and apply it to me
It's a [?] feel, it's too real, people die in these streets
I'm happy that I made it and I'm glad I seen the day today
One life and one love, now let's pray to ourselves today
