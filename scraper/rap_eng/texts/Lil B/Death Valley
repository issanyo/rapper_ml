[Intro]
Yo, come over here Lil B. Come hit this shit
I wanna tell you a story, nigga

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Death Valley
If you're strong, better wake up
I'm standing tall, niggas brake when they wake up
Look 'em in the eyes and see a coward
Look me in my eyes and see a man with the power
Power in the do, like power
Snooze gets you locked in about an hour
Look at big bro while he's in interrogation
Police looking at me, not telling what I'm doing
Boy, I'm silent. G cold if you thugging, better watch it
Get deals like they drafted me from Compton
Home innovators, house raid like the Raiders
Full squad coming 100 deep
Hundred miles they're running
Anthony and the Johnsons
Listening to 'em while I'm rolling my weed up
Get humble by the simple fact that I'm rolling this weed up
Niggas ask if I'm based living
Like Taylor Gang, I'm on a mission
So high that we rolling five-deep with no pot to piss in
All started from a dream and forgotten wishes
I'mma be a broke rapper before I wash some dishes
Sell weed to the cops, throw me fifty years
Yeah, a nigga dying
Ain't nobody shedding tears
Lack sucker nigga died, shit I was happy still
Looking at the casket, how they gonna kill my friend?
Death Valley, we all seen [...] devils and most demons
Giving up non-believers, under-achievement, haters and false preachers
Killers in all regions
Death Valley is a place with no speaking
Nigga steal from the church and pray to the deacon
If you fake, bruh, I don't fuck with ya by myself
As I got the switcher on my lap at all times
Load the pistol
Bullets like a pimp with a bitch, cause they bound to hit you
Rappers from my own city start some sneak dissing
Huh, you ain't get a show in five years
Still missing
How much you make for a show? Couple fives is missing
Guy like me, I make all five digits
All cash, straight to the bank with it
Ex-robber so you know ain't no safe in it
And you know I don't trust nobody
Only family [...]
I'mma lay a nigga down on the spiritual mattress
He gonna fall through the clouds and the semen is grass
Wake him up, Red Flame is the last dedication
Shouts out to Lil Wayne for the dedication
Lil B, a hundred miles they're running
Blue Flame history, Red Flame is a cosine
Uh huh, Red Flame is his cousin
Welcome to Death Valley, nigga

[Outro]
You know, these little stories in my mind
Red Flame is a lot of hatred, and a lot of anger in my soul right now
For some suckers
And the haters and the bitch motherfuckers
That, you know, try to play the realest
How're you gonna try to play the rawest?
And that's why I got that Red Flame in my soul and it's burning
Shouts out to the cousin, Blue Flame
Lil B
