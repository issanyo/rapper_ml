[Intro]
Yeah
This that dope real music
This that highway music
If you on this freeway, this highway of life, riding, smoking, sellin' shit
Doing what we gotta do

[Chorus]
Finna hit the freeway, finna bang this dope
Taking trips on the bridge, don't no one know
Y'all ain't hearing me
Finna hit the freeway, finna sell this dope
Taking trips on the bridge, don't no one know

[Verse 1]
My lifetime, my lifetime
Big book of crime, no stop signs
I'm on top of the world, but I'm lacking a mind
I move too fast, I ain't waiting in line
Use my brain everyday, I ain't wasting my time
People eating off my plate and I ain't making a dime
I feel so sad, I feel so mad
Got took from my heart, ain't no one care
Got to take this long drive get my thoughts together
Nothing makes sense when you got awful weather
And I know the freeway like the back of my hand
Know what exit to get off, where the rest stops at
Get your hands clean and go sell that pack
Truck drivers holding bags like they loading cans
That's the life of me, keep the freeway
This the life of me, fuck what he say (lil boss)

[Pre-Chorus]
This that highway music
This that highway music

[Chorus]
Finna hit the freeway, finna sell this dope
Taking trips on the bridge, don't no one know

[Verse 2]
When I'm riding in my car, I wear three weak chains
Got a bible in the back that I ain't never read
But I keep my faith strong as I'm clearing my head
Money in the book, if you read it you blessed
Stock my food up for the winter, I can't go hungry
Freeway trips and I ain't have no money
You can look me in my eyes, I look fine
I practice everyday to hide the pain inside
I'm on Lanway, my feelings come next week
Bill collectors at the door, don't tell 'em I'm home
Gotta gas up a whip, get out of the zone
Gotta ship off a zone, prayin' I make it home
Years of sadness, generation of pain
I'm looking for a sunny day 'cause its always raining
Feel like I'm in Seattle 'cause the gloomy days
But I guarantee we gone be okay
On the freeway

[Chorus]
Finna hit the freeway, finna sell this dope
Taking trips on the bridge, don't no one know
Finna hit the freeway, finna bang this dope
Taking trips on the bridge, don't no one know
