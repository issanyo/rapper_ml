[Intro]
Hate
Hate is not knowing
Hate is fear

With this based world symphony
And with my mind I try to clear up
Anything that
Has to deal with hate
Has to deal with not showing your face
This is life
We all hold in one place
We are all one
Earth is one, one with the sun
Let me run
To the field that I want to be in

[Verse 1]
Hate is fear
Fear is not knowing
To hate, you're in a box
You never leave the space
Only insecurities bring you in place
To hate, you don't wish
Only negative thoughts run your mind
Do time and spread much red if you can
I say red because it's an alert color
Brings a tint into the situation
I consider myself gray
A neutral
Pushing forward, the hate moves back
Fear is in the one who won't look back
Walks on tracks with trains
Only to say 'This isn't working'

Sorry for the segue back to hate
I try not to focus too much on that word
Still leaves me disturbed
My nerves need to be calmed
Experienced hate at an early age
I didn't love school, didn't know the essence of grades
My peers would overlook and underestimate my character
Like I'm not life's movie
Any lesser than human
Some called me stupid behind my back
Some called me foolish
Growing up made me toothless
I lost my two friends in elementary
I was upset about it, the haters laughed at it
I grew an outer shell
Not mean, but something I could rely on

When I'm tested, my spirit's tested
Looking for an exit, maybe a blessing
Send a message to the hater
Tell him or her or it
That I'm done with trying to please every person
So the smile matches dental commercials
Someone misunderstand the kindness of man Take if for weakness
I cut the haters out of my life
I'm pure and still work not to judge
I'm not a judge, my job's to love
I'm only human, not above
The only drug that your brain is born with is fear
A lot of people overdose, some overcome
Some realize its all inside
The inside drive is what moves us
Down-court, life is a sport
Dunk the ball, don't hate

And when I say hate, it's fear
That's the truth

The people that hate don't understand the truth in life
The true meaning, the true essence
The haters still want to learn
Let them learn
Lead by example
The haters will always hate

I see the haters just fear what they cannot be or
Something they feel that they want to be
They see something inside of you that they want to take
Haters are leaches
Haters fear themselves

[Verse 2]
The simple problem is people use the internet to judge
And not to interact
Virtual reality--it can't be fact
I don't believe my eyes with that
Comments on YouTube reflect a principle:
80% positive and 20% critical
Wish the hate was minimal
If they could only understand like you and just listen
As I rap the closest spoken to an emotion
Realize my words are lotion, maybe potion
Something that calms your ocean
Tsunamis come and go, haters keep a high-tide
I seem to keep the weather in autumn
My feelings are awesome toward others
I hate none
To fear is to take one
I try not to break none
Quiet as [indecipherable]
Spread the word for peace
Love and happiness
Even a hate song turns into a positive
As long as we live what the options is
We stay operative, performing at a high level
Keeping life balanced out
Keeping the mind laughing
While working out, no hate on the couches
Just word of mouth, no hate

To hate is to fear
To fear is not to know
Learn and the hate will release

To hate is to judge
Come and let's talk
Ask me any questions you would like
Do not judge me, do not hate me
Talk to me and i will talk back

Hate is fear
