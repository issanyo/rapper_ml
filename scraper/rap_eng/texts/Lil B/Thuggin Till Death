I’m thuggin till the end
I’m thuggin till the end
Thuggin, thuggin, thuggin, thuggin
Old school thuggin
I’m thuggin till the end

Yeah
It’s lil b

[Verse 1]
I’m the prophet, rap gods who slap broads and rap lords
I have no remorse, so nigga take it with action
I’m not falling off, not gon' flop
Hopefully i get a mil so when this rappin' stop
I’ll have something, to fall back on
Buying, Bugatti [?] trucks, material stuff
Writing raps so, when my album drops
It will come direct, with no personal blocks
Comfortable, with most of the stuff that i rap, and i do a lot of fan mail
Hopefully in 2015 I blew up big, shutting down cd stores
Groupies side by side with an accountant to manage my money
My own bank account for niggas that try to scheme my money
Looking at my paycheck like its theirs for keeps
Thats why I stick with my niggas I was ripped from the streets

[Hook]
I’m thuggin till the end
I’m thuggin till the end
Thuggin, thuggin, thuggin, thuggin
Old school thuggin
I’m thuggin till the end

[Verse 2]
Counting my dinero, big ballers sitting by De Niro
Blowing on smoke I see girls, see some neck motion
Once they see the cash then its the next motion
I pull out, bust on her face, potent
This all my dreams, I sit back for real hoping if I
Hope, I get some where
Take it coasting putting rap in my own hands, this my devotion
Keep on praying and keep on saying I’ma make it
And if I do the gift is mine I'ma take it
Riding down the long highway me by myself
All types of dreams, what if I make it, my rapping scheme
All my dreams become reality, shit to me
I have a verbal effect, I’m a preacher
Explaining myself, here in my home
Now you in my church, the pending path to new birth

Let’s work, lil b

[Hook]
I’m thuggin till the end
I’m thuggin till the end
Thuggin, thuggin, thuggin, thuggin
Old school thuggin
I’m thuggin till the end

[Verse 3]
Water that hold you, put you together, the aggravation of not making it
The confrontation of writing is
Nobody understands when i talk and spit
I explain the whole truth never faking it
No more pain I’m seeing gains they not running
So bitch explain the pain thats me and you accounted
This not over the counter, or under the table
This not a fairy tale, it ain’t no old time fable
This is real life, steady and stable
Just live your life realer, and realize that everybody, not forgivin'
Just realize some guys, hate your children
Got hits posted on cats, ready for killin'
And they call me a villain, lord willin’
Lord willin' I protect these children
Lord willin' I protect the buildin’
Lil b here, thats a legend, chillin'
I see ya

Task force

[Hook]
Thuggin'
I’m thuggin till the end
Thuggin'
I’m thuggin till the end
Thuggin, thuggin
Old school thuggin
I’m thuggin till the end
