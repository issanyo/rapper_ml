Acting like a clown but I wear no paint
My whole life it was curved and it was not straight
Like Vincent Van Gogh I’m tryna save face
Like a computer I’m tryna save space
Guess I’m kinda weird so I guess I’m based
Ever seen a piece of art that was so in touch?
Never seen me on hard and you could not touch
That thing you wanna grasp that hurt so much
Real knowledge is the thing that’s worth so much
So I try to rap things out that I can’t touch
It seems I touch, I been touched with the things that blutz
I touch like the phones at Toys-R-Us
And I see everything that revolves around us
That the things I trust
Everything else is fake and the dreams on us
If I could live everyday that’s a gift in that
I spit facts so you know it’s a gifted rap (it’s Lil Boss)
But that’s not enough I gotta give more back
I gotta sacrifice myself like 2Pac
My bro said “B you gotta write more rap”
But he don’t know my life is the life I rap
So I’m up all night like a fiend off smack
Tryna make the next hit be the one not checked
Plus the checks that I see is like my checks off macking
Plus I’m in training camp but the coaches don’t like me
Cause I’m a leader
