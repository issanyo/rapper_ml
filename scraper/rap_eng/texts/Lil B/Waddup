(Intro: Lil B)
I ain't never bagged dope I ain't never bagged dope like this

(Verse 1: Lil B)
Bagging up dope and I'm playing my position
One foot in the house one foot in the kitchen
One foot in jail the other foot in the mention
Think a sucker, you gon get it twisted
Told 'em sit back, but them niggas don't listen
You want to come up, man I told you, you be tripping
Finna pistol whip him
Niggas tryna play me, like beanie seagel, I'm not jay z
Niggas get rich buy a house in AZ
I'm feeling kind of sick, go and rob me some niggas
I wanna spank you with the Glock I got
Bought it from the tenderloin
Bullets is fine
Semi 2 clips cigarette package
Cold winter, yeah its under the mattress
Cash rules all, right under the mattress
Just hit a lick and I'm feeling fantastic

(Hook: Lil B)
I'm still chopping dope in the back seat nigga waddup
I'm still chewing dope in the back seat nigga waddup
I'm still chewing dope in the back seat nigga waddup

(Verse 2: Lil B)
Why bag drugs I'm so racist
I only bag white, let me get a sample
If the fiend gon' die, then what the fuck you selling
We selling off hard knock, cocaine melon
We sell bath salts, that's the shit we on
Sold coke to the fiendy then he died
Well life's a bitch and cry
You wash away the tears with the old ass lies
Look inside the mirror with my red eyes
Who have I become, eye for an eye
Karma came back, I'm dealing with the same shit
Moving so fast, man I thought I needed it
But I really I don't
Thought you needed that money
But shit, you really won't get it
And I still know it
I'm the streets nigga I'm on it

(Hook: Lil B)
