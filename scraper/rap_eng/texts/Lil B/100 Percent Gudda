[Intro]
This is 100 Percent Gudda
We come from the bottom
If you really wanna make it, you gotta struggle
You know, we hustle every day, this life beautiful
Only doing you, and we getting money
100% Gutta

[Verse]
As I'm rapping, I get better and better
And I'm making it, so holes won't be blowing through my sweater
And plus I got the vest tucked tight, releasing whatever
Nigga, I like to beef, put you right to sleep
Feed you the double Glock, and then I bite your smeech
And for all you niggas, who think B is sweet
Put two Glocks in their throat, you won't need the piece
Hopefully a piece of your throat don't fall on the streets
Nigga, you feel this beat, then you bite the curb
Exercising my flows with these type of words
Bringing worlds together, forever I speak the truth
Real talk man, I'm shaking worlds
Every time I write a diss, it's advancing my slurves
And curves, you feel me? I pronounce my words
But I stay high all the time, I forgot what I said
Don't come back down, I ain't no sucker, OK?
I rock bitches from the top to the bottom
.44, red beam, make it kick when you poppin'
He ain't never walk around, but now he sleep in a coffin
Nigga looking for a plate, man, we out here starving
Nigga made it from the cut, it don't happen too often
Gotta change your whole game, niggas made it to office
Got a young nigga selling dope out of the Porsches
He wanna rob the plug, but he don't know what it cost him
The problem with the game: niggas in it for flossing
Nigga then pulled up in the front of the Slauson
Ghetto kids respect me like a law enforcement
Nigga came and I torched him, any fucking sucker
I'm ready, baby .9, with the semi cocked
I'm out hitting licks, niggas think I'm lying
Niggas pushing dope like, "thought it was science"
Out of my mind, 100% Gutta mixtape
Switchblade rap flow, cooked up, riding top
Up top, Mona Lisa shots
Niggas flashing up with [ ], like (bop bop bop bop)
(bop bop) You feel me? Yeah
Coming to your door like the pizza man
Take your money like the preacher man
Get my dope from London, you would have thought I needed a visa
Lord help me, Jesus, these niggas outrageous
Life just a game, and you gotta pick the stages
Used to piss these bitches for twenties, you feel me?
I'm up all night, like I'm working at Denny's
Hired hitman, these niggas ain't too friendly
Give up a angel, now you a danger to the city
100 Percent Gudda, that's the last thing with me
Niggas try to play games, dudes just play games
Life just a game, B make it rain
Smoking in my car, now it's looking like a plane
Bitch, kiss my ass, you never seen no bus
I'm staying in the lane, niggas want to meet me in my lane
Guns passed him, this is Lil B

[Outro]
Man, one lesson, everybody
Fuck these suckers man
I'ma tell you
Niggas out here with the blessings
You feel me, 100% Gutta mixtape, I ain't stressing
You feel me? It's that Lil B shit
