Verse 1

Lady from the hood, swear she got no answer, gotta raise 3 kids but she got breast cancer and we know rent is due and the bank won't answer, wanna move out the hood and defeat that cancer. I asked how she stays on her feet like dancers, how she keep on, no pain, to a life size canvas. She told me everyday that you must take chances, and if you living in the past and it's no enhancements, said life hard but the dreams do matter, only way to read books is if you move through chapters, she said spread love off pain and promise and she died the next day and that's what made me honest, it's real life. Shot a guy sick, had to call the doctor, said he didn't feel well and his head was nauseous, this girl 17, startin to get real cautious, cause Shotta never said what was in that office, Shotta came home lookin like he lost his soul, girl 17 went to kiss him, he said don't touch me, I'm HIV positive
