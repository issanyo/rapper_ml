[Verse 1: Lil B]
I was the shit before Deandre was
That was eight years ago, I'm beyond they buzz
A lot if these big gas is Beyonc√© thugs
I'm beyond they stairs and bitch I'm beyond they ways
Something like a dealer I'm a constant drug
And I save the earth with my "I face loves"
These niggas don't see me with them concrete gloves
You ain't even gon' see my style, the business with the fashion
Think about it, mix kindness with the passion
Thinking eternally, nigga I'm elastic a
Why these niggas wanna game, we smashing
You feel me
All these bitches know that we snatched it
You feel me
To the top nigga we going
An we on the finish line can't stop us
You can't stop it, rap the only option

[Hook: Lil B]
We stunting till the sunlight
Bitch, I said we stunting till the sunlight

[Verse 2: Lil B]
So I seem to be proving all you non-believer niggas
Just believing what you see
Get the bigger picture
Rapping like I'm in a mirror
My reflection getting clearer
As I open up my path I see more than smoke and the mirrors, just believe the truth
You feel me
Undergo the buzz, this is way beyond the roof
Fuck a Lexus coupe bitch
I'm tryna get the swoop
Call me Guap money maker, nigga that's what I do
Your rap careers is through
I'm the business don't like you niggas
Imma fight you
I said lil mama drink it like juice
Put the comb on eBay watch it sell like dope
Man what it do. I said what it does nigga
Let my nuts hang in this place
Where the fuck the bank teller
Cause bitch I got bank, Bitch I got bank
Yeah bitch I got Ben franks, Sinatra
Wit the bopper, selling clothes
Like bitch you need a box of ?
I'm Johnny Cochran, hella niggas copy off me
Ya boy is boxing, boxing these niggas
Hopped up with stockings
Bop it, man I swear to god man, yo bitch was bopping
Last time I checked yo chick was bopping
Just give her dick and fuck her
Get out of here man, my iniggasis stone cold, Steve Austin
Got a new fetish for all that fall out flossing
Flossing , nigga I'm bossing
She bossing up, got her bossing
In clicked up, man, bitch
You already know, Lil B
