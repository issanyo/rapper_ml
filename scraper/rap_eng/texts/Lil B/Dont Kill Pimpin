[Intro]
Yeah. Check me out, we in Oakland right now

[Verse]
Pause, niggas mad the boss rock
On and off top, niggas high like stove talk
Killing off mics, had to get the grim reap
Leave 'em ten feet, [?] no sleep
[?] wanna talk with no reach
Like Mugsy Bogues, niggas six feet
Niggas act like I ain't [?] through hell
Niggas quit first week
Get my mind correct
As I walk steps in history, my eyes is dead
One thing, get your mind respect
Seem to curse a lot and less fucking bitch
Real good rappers they don't have to say that
Cause real real niggas got Maybachs
Niggas give his day back
Take the whole fucking world, you hear that
Old school, [?] with a mere cat
[?] underground
Niggas I'm hood as ever
People respect the real
The world to mother
If I had one thing, that's word to brother
Actually I do fucked up nigga
Smoking hella blunts while I drink this liquor
Cadillac old school three of my bitches

[Chorus]
Don't kill pimpin'
Just don't kill pimpin'
Don't fight pimpin'
Don't shoot pimpin'
Don't kill pimpin'
Just don't kill pimpin'
Don't fight pimpin'
Don't shoot pimpin'
Don't kill pimpin'
Don't fight pimpin'
Don't kill pimpin'
Don't shoot pimpin'

[Interlude]
Evil Red Flame nigga. Lil B

[Chorus]
Don't kill pimpin'
Don't fight pimpin'
Don't shoot pimpin'
Don't hurt pimpin'
Don't fight pimpin'
Don't kill pimpin'
Don't shoot pimpin'
