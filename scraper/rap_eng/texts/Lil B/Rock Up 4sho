Niggas came for nothing
Feel like i'm winning
I just wanna breathe
It feel like im swimming
I'm ready for the top
And it feel like i'm coming
Niggas wanna hate
But i face worse days
Niggas talk shit
But they just scratch the surface
I don't eve kill niggas
They kill themselves
You was lying and you know it
How that shit felt
Niggas act hard don't wanna get help
I'ma put you on the bed
And you gone see it
I'm just seeing pain
You don't believe it
I'm just trying to see a better day
The whole world not ready
I'm trying to see a better day
We all need it
I'm so ready for the change
I'm feeling so homeless
In this brain daze
Rain days, rich as flames
Rich as fucking fire
These niggas playin
Richest forever
Homeless to the game
Put a home in my name
You suckas is lazy
Bitches wanna stay here man
You hoes gotta pay me
Give her the super bowl look
You crazy!

[Bridge]
Ay man i gotta eat man
This is for my niggas
This is for my niggas
This is for my niggas
Lil B to the top
Lil B to the top
Lil B to the top
Nigga sit and watch
Put the back in the loft
On online now
Niggas can't stop that
Can't stop me

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I keep my circle tight
Money tight, circles right
O's black, coming through
In that all black, niggas know me
Scratch the surface
2 guns in the back of the hersha
I'm just a gutter nigga
Playing for the game
Hoes and bitches, niggas know me
I rock for the top
Niggas hate that
So i gotta hit em with the Maybach
That big cater
Push his ass later
Let that nigga see something
He ain't never seen before
And i'm telling niggas fo sho
I rock up fo sho
