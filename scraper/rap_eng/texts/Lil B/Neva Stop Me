[Verse 1]
You can have me caged in praying on my downfall
The game got me fucked up, got the fuck from round y'all
Straight through, zoom like a Nascar
Visions, don't talk about decisions
I was the last one to get this, last one to get that
Kept my head up when the rain, threw my coat back
I"m a lumberjack, I'm dropping trees to the game
Not talking about the plants, talking drug fame
You gonna see jail, the criminals never safe
This came from the heart
Don't look at my past, I just left it in this dark
I could start from scratch
Multiply the truth, it's all facts
You can deny I'm great, you don't rap
If you something ain't real, then you don't trap
From waiting at the bus stop to riding all-black
If God's real, why my friend have to die?
Sometimes I've just got to ask why

[Verse 2]
Back-to-back, cars move after the fact
It's like my life action-packed
Memories just fade in, caved in
I wrote this already, it's like a double-take
But I will never stop my love
You can't infiltrate, one in a billion
Like Young Jeezy feeling like one in a million
I get the chance, I work harder than ever
Anybody talking down, bitch we in it together
You seem to forget, you not gonna live forever
Why you cop that ride and you spend that cheddar
Stack up your money, that's word to mother
Love of people talking down man, living to maintain
My life not made, I'm in the hood like ant spray
Words could kill
Why he call his album that and how the fuck he feel?
Bitch I do what I want and the tracks is ill
Remember Lil B, bitch, that's that dude that's real
Let's get it
