[Intro: Lil B]
Turn this shit up, nigga, Bitch Mob!

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Stay fuckin stunting
Bitch mob hit her put the ho on a track
Make a couple dollars I ain't nothin bout frontin
Nothin to it boss, I float like Ali and I sting like a wasp
Bitch paid me cause she know that it cost
Money on your head like butter with the bread
Handle funk or you're dead, that's what I said
In the hood every day cause the nigga ain't scared
When I walk by people know not to stare cause
Cause your ass get built like the top of the stairs
Drinkin every day, smoke every day
Lightin up a blunt niggas know I don't play
No I don't play, no I don't play
Might ball every day but no I don't play
No I don't play, no I don't play
Might ball every day but no I don't play, bitch

[Bridge]
Doodaloop-boodaloop-boop
Hey tell my niggas throw them W's up
Nigga bang that shit! BASEDGOD!

[Hook: Lil B] x2
Lil B nigga still young and fuck a ho
Lil B bitch still reppin west coast
Lil B, still got the AK
Throw your hands up, if you're from the bay

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I made my mind up
I'm only wearing based clothes, feeling like SpaceGhost
But that nigga broke with no TV show
Leave a nigga dry with no bitches though
Bitches love me cause I'm straight
I like her, and she like me
I'm the type of nigga fuck with the lights on
Bitch look at me I know the Based God
I'll tell you a little secret
Actually no I won't cause I know you can't keep it
I beat a bitch up
I beat a sucka up, I beat the fuckin world up
That's how it feel
That's so real, that's so gutta
That's so active
Bitch I'm so posh I knock a nigga off

[Hook: Lil B] x2
Lil B nigga still young and fuck a ho
Lil B bitch still reppin west coast
Lil B, still got the AK
Throw your hands up, if you're from the bay

[Verse 3: Lil B]
This so fire in '14
Real old fire, don't take no game
Don't play me, don't talk that shit
Man, if it ain't Lil B
I want Lil B, you in the streets?
Hundred thousand down low first take
I'm a special dude, with a lot of game
I can teach you how to not work
Push the weight off, get fat first
You feel me? And I serve you a plate
The chef in the kitchen cookin things not legal
Paula Deen got a lotta niggas in the Regal
Brodie riding high, I feel like you
I feel I see you
Just throw up the deuce man
To a nigga that got the juice

[Hook: Lil B] x2
Lil B nigga still young and fuck a ho
Lil B bitch still reppin west coast
Lil B, still got the AK
Throw your hands up, if you're from the bay
