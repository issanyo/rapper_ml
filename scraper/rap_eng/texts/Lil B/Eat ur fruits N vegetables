[Intro]
These kids are fat
With diabetes
Sweating sweets
Cause they hungry
We need to change this
Generation
From becoming fat patrons

[Verse 1]
I been hearin some of yall kids don’t like fruit
U are dumb and stupid
Why don’t u like fruit
It is good for you
And for ur health
And if u eat it u can get wealth (ooooo)
Fuck you if you don’t like fruit
Eat some carrots
They orange and healthy
Got vitamins for ur eyes
Eat some zuccihini
They are nice tasting
And they good for ur skin
Eat some pumpkin pies
They taste sweet
And they are healthy as a treat
Eat some onions
They are good if u make them into fonions
But watch out or else u will cry
Bitch
Eat some brochili
They are green and nice
They taste yum when u put them inside ur mouth
And they look like trees
So u can probably smoke them like weed

[Bridge]
Fruit fruit it is good for you
Eat some eat some it is healthy food
Fruit fruit it is good for you
Eat some eat some it is healthy food

[Verse 2]
U like apples Im sure u do
Cause if u eat them u become strong
They r nice and tasty green
And they look like a tennis ball
I like oranges cause they are zisty
I like to eat oranges with some pepsi
Oranges oranges are nice
I will eat them even if they were lice
Watermelon
They say
Is for black people only, no way
Watermelons are for everybody
Don’t be a racialist before u get bodied
Bananas makes the hoes go bananas
They like them because they resemble a mans dagger
Shit, these hoes love bananas
But do you know loves bananas me (no homo)
Cause they have that vitamin B
Another vegetable which is good
It is tomatoes they are everywhere
Hav u eaten a pizza without a tomato
No because they are great
Some other vegetable which is nice
Is kiwi fruit
They are from new Zealand
Becuz the kiwis invented this vegetable
They are nice tasting
But watch out cause they have spikes
Which could hurt your mouth
Some more fruit which is nice
Is rice
Rice is white but it is not racist
It gives u energy it is good for u
And it’s a cheap source of fuel
For ur car
If u melt it
Faggot
