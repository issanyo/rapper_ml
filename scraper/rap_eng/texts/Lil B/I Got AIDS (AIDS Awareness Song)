[Intro: Lil B & his girl]
(Girl's voice from phone) "Hello?"
Man, what's up?
Uhh, I can't believe this, man
So I just got some news from the doctor, man, and..

[Verse 1]
I got AIDs, goddamn, I can't believe this shit
Last time I fucked was my girl, I can't believe that bitch
Now let me think, goddamn, there was another girl
I got a lot of things in my life, but now I'm in a swirl
No protection, I should've used a condom
Instead of trustin' these women
I never got tested, I felt fine, I never got sick
Plus I look good
My mom said, "Keep your dick in your pants and you'll be good"
I was worried about gettin' them pregnant
Not knowin' she had full-blown AIDs and she sexin' everybody
Cause real talk, she ain't even tell me
Mad at her last man, she held the pain in her belly

[Verse 2]
Now I'm fucked, cause I had unprotected sex
Take it from me, go get checked, that be your best bet
On top of that I got Herpes
When she gave me AIDs my life ended early if I don't got no cash to pay
Magic Johnson only one that's still alive
Sittin' down all alone, it makes me wanna cry
If I can go back in time, I would've used a condom
Now I'm saying goodbye to my momma, damn

[Outro]
I'mma talk to you later, that's all I can say
(Alright, please call me back)
I wanna tell everybody, make sure y'all get tested, man
This is not a game
A lot of people have STDs right now and don't even know it
You look perfectly fine and you feel fine
And it takes, uh, you know, a few months
You know, for somethin' to form in your body
But you can have it and be perfectly fine
Make sure you're not transmittin' these STDs to other people
I know it hurts sometimes, you don't even wanna know
But, you know, to protect the world
And to be fair to everybody else
Make sure you get tested
And don't trust nobody because a lot of people are lyin'
A lot of people don't even really know
And don't think cause a person looks good
That they free, cause a lot of people that got HIV
