[Intro]
They say I can end these niggas careers. One by one piece by piece. Its just a jungle nigga, welcome to the jungle

[Verse]
I live life for the edge, soil the beasts
Where you play games and get your head broken to pieces
Haters don't say my name but its one of they nieces
Came a long way from tucking heat under the fleeces
Man they sleeping on the boss but I'm seeing their features
Can't look me in the eyes cuz the stares is cold
I'm so cold like the ice that was made in snow
Heart burn like a match set the game on fire
Lil B for Lil Boss when I come be fired
Man the dro burn slow off the blunt I'm higher
15 I was living every mans desire
Came straight out the hood with the peon vest
I throw shots like a beast so I'm Ron Artest
When I fire off my gun bet my arm don't rest
Sending money through the wire like I'm Kanye West
I bounce back double up that was all I get
Smooth dude real goon that was smooth as piss
Can't stop what you can't see word to my dick
Eating salad everyday thinking that I'm rich
Dress her up break it down cuz she really a bitch
Can't trust them in the game cuz they really a snitch
Where your heart at we coming from the bottom where the dark at
Crabs in the bucket so they mad when you spark that
So I gotta spark back
The pump make your head shake
The 45 bullets go dumb like the dread check
Infrared beam on your head thats the lead-weight
Cock thing back and make hell then the jailbreak
But its not TV I really make the cell break
Cell popping mobsters
Living like monsters
I'm too nice rap on cue like its the Oscars
The old school swag with the Bentleys and the Mazdas
Bitch called me masta, high like in NASA
What is costs to be me? Think big body
All my life all I wanted was to be somebody
I would write a lot of raps, then I meet somebody
That would understand my grind who would see somebody
Have dinner at a table take a seat somebody
My Boss Lil Boss lemme greet somebody
No I'm not a porn star but I eat somebody
Rap game give me 10 feet, I beat somebody
Rap with the lock jaw
Rob with the ski mask
Ski with your right hand don't make ya relapse
Feel Jadakiss because I'm coming where you be at
I'm making buzz like I'm rapping where the bees at
Yeah shit I put my city on the world at my back now
Potential is whats everything
Coming from my background
Dudes getting rich you never see em coming back round
They friends turn on em
His head lay his back down
I've been with this shit you can check it on my background
Holding on money hitting six licks
High school hood rich stolen cars and a zip
Give em dub for the 10
Could've held back prices
All my fiends come back like I planted devices
Rocked Vans now I switched up from Jordens and Nikes
Man B, you the best thats word to my psyche
A lot of dudes say hey and they really don't like me
Cuz I fuck your main bitch and I ain't even be icy
2 chains 4 rings goddamn thats pricey
Feel asleep on first class eating chicken on planes
Getting off the planes seeing limousines and the ranges
How I calculate my life shit, its life and the pain
Staying wet, staying fresh, forever its raining
Goddamn I'm god so you can't contain em
The only thing stopping me is my face
I look in the mirror I see a person that I could never disgrace
Before I'm in the streets homeless I would catch me a case
Yeah, I would catch me a case
Lemme take this shit back lemme stay in my place
Best thing you gotta do is stay in your place
Lil B for Lil Boss and I'm winning the race
