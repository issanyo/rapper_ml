[Intro]
Welcome to Hell
I'm the Devil
I've taken over Lil B's soul

[Verse 1]
I'mma bring the pain to you
This is not a game but it's...
Something different when you rising with elegance
There's fire in my eyes and death is on my breath
I cook in Hell's kitchen, so you should watch your step
I'm burning every day, my soul, there's nothing left
Everything I say is contrary to belief
And saying something deep, my speech is rap poison
I choose fake cause I can never stop the bad voices
Yes I made choices, I'd rather take the easy route
That ended up with me killing myself
I'm reincarnated with the based demigods
I took B's soul, his family was surprised
I looked them in his eyes, I can see through disguise
I took him down to Hell, he was wearing suit and tie
He begged for his life, but his life is mine now
I'm Satan, I make deals and death wishes
I hate Based God, want to put him on the guestlist
Give him first class trip to underworld, ghost town
Black stab city, you can see when no one's around
Really want to keep you blind, watch you sleep underground
No more rap songs and no based freestyles
I really can't breathe cause I'm turning to a beast now
Momma said if I want to be the best it's hard work
I chose to live reckless... And now I'm under dirt
But it's Hell on Earth with these presidents and new bombs
War every day, Wall Street scams, our jam
Everyone so they can feel my pain cause I fucked up
Have you ever messed up to the point... Now you fucked up
Lost your own life to yourself, can't believe this
Devil took my soul, I don't believe I couldn't see this
Everybody think cause you alive you couldn't be this
I'm waiting for a soul and I'll see if I can seize it
Pray to the mob boss, pray to the X-Men
I'll see you in hell if you're living with regrets, man
Best words to you, you should learn from the best men
Don't follow the next man, I'm looking for some best friends
Don't nobody care if you're doing what you love, if
You doing what you love, then
Stay away from us...
Stay away from happiness cause loneliness is here
You roaming with the Based God I'm bound to interfere
I'm the Devil

[Outro]
Welcome to Hell...
Hell on Earth
(Welcome to Hell forever)
I'm taking over
The Devil
