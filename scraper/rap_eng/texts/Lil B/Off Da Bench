Nigga, we getting millions, nigga, fuck it

One time for my niggas on the court (x4)
One time for my niggas on the bench (x4)

[Verse 1]

I'm trynna get my niggas off the block (x3)
You feel me? Pass the rock!

One time for my niggas on the court (x4)
One time for my niggas on the bench (x4)

Bitch, I got something to say! (x4)
See me on the hoop court, and let's play!

[Hook]
One time for my niggas on the court (x4)
One time for my niggas on the bench (x4)

[Outro]
Like I said, Lil B, he done came in this gym, and that boy done put his time in
So you know what?
Like a peach in a basket, Lil B is gon' run in that motherfucking court
And he gon' hoop his ass off until he make that NBA
And he gon' bring that title back home to us
And we gotta win that championship
Know what I'm saying?
I'm a old school type of cat, know what I'm saying?
So, we handles the business, OK?
