[Intro]
Man this real personal to me
This song, that's playing
All I can feel when I hear it man
I just be like
Remember me in the coffee shops
Me in Berkley just walking around in the nature
Real peaceful you feel me

Yeah, what you think about me
It's Lil B
What you think about moi

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you like this I had a hard time growing up
Didn't know right from wrong, I had to learn myself
I was cool I didn't have many problems
But the people started testing me that's when I had to shock em
Start to think, is retaliation necessary?
Think about it's all what people think
Don't conform, to social norms
Read books like girls so I stay informed
Don't be on the outside, come on in
We got to work as a people to move on my friend
Guarantee if you positive, things move smoother
Don't think, that I'm trying to preach to you
But I gotta keep it real cause I gotta be
Yeah I shop at Ross, yeah Goodwill
Who cares? I don't care what people think
I do me fuck a bitch literally
Literally (laughs), for real man you're killing me
Don't think too hard man, you're killing me
Don't be missing me, real talk man I got you

[Hook]
Baby baby, who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
Baby baby, who's my lady when this world drives me crazy

[Verse 2]
Think about it, who you got
Besides family, most relatives might turn on you
Who you got, on these cold summers
Got to fight for yourself be grateful, no hatin
People overseas can't even protest
And we claiming that we in the projects
It's little kids in Iraq
When we ran, most niggas don't got no stress
If you be humble no stress
The humble means you learning from the progress
Be humble, we grew up in the projects
Be happy that you're dark, be happy that your skin bright
Be happy that you're alive, be humble that you're here
Be humble that you hear this music cause any day you can lose it
Be humble that you hear this music, cause any day you can lose it

[Hook x2]
Baby baby, who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
Baby baby, who's my lady when this world drives me crazy

[Outro]
I love y'all, real hip-hop let's get it
Based world
Based music, based music

Baby baby, who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
Baby baby, who's my lady when this world drives me crazy
