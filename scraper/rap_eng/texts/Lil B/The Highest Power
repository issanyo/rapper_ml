[Intro]
(The Highest Power)
Welcome to Evil Red Flame
Shouts out to Jay Electronica
Shouts out to Lupe Fiasco
Lil B, yeah

[Verse 1]
Save me lord, these niggas ain't raw
Your faith in credit, faith in God
Just evolved, advance to the [?]
Smooth connoisseur, reminds you of Geronimo
Musical he goes
Save me from suckers
Leeches ain't the only ones really starting shit
Got the guns, little bit extortion
Never been a cop but fuck with enforcement
Got some cops on the side, I lay 'em in a coffin
At the doctors office with a girl but it's not an abortion
Put his hands up in the air like a boxer, James Tooely
Got you in the trunk, Mike Tyson with the chopper
Floyd Mayweather Maybach with compressor
These bitches serve me, correction jester
All my girls know it's bout first impressions
Lil B BasedGod, they treat him like [?]
Dedicated but I'm obsession
Evil Red Flame, this is more than just a mixtape
It's moving like a vinyl
Marvin Gaye record
Lenny Kravitz Mac-11 with the debit card
Give me some change
It ain't hard to be the best out
Niggas moving in straight lines be the one that
Thank my mother for supporting
Thank all my niggas that had my back when I was hurting
Without your love, [?] spitting verses
Without you there'd be no more
Give a lot of credit, that's the way it's gon' be
Niggas got love for me
Fake niggas envy, fake niggas hate me
My homeboy, MacBook Pro
Microsoft, my bitches we pay like stocks
Yeah

[Verse 2]
All these niggas hate me, I'm feeling like the cop
Niggas mad that Rick Ross was
I know CO's in jail serving [?]
Bringing McDonald's to the murderers
Extra time playing PlayStation
No justification
Red Flame not a lie
I'd rather die in my sleep than say goodbye
Cause you hurt
It would hurt to see you cry
Give 'em the evil eye
Red Flame this is not paradise
This hell within
It's jail within
It's a cell within
No keys to break me out, I'm locked forever
Just know I'm based for life and I'm here forever
Based world we're here forever
I'm the highest power
Based World, this the hour
Evil Red Flame
Let me speak
