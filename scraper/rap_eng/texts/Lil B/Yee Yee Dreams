[Verse 1: Lil B]

Mister dope man I've got a story to tell
About a guy, Lil B, hes crazy as hell
I was walking yesterday home alone from school
That's when i seen Lil B he was blowin' cool
All on the block, looking like a thug
Bitch get off your ass and go slang them drugs
Lil B you need to go watch your goddamn mouth
Cuz it's cheap down here, don't mean it is down South
Everybody talking bout robbing the plug
It's no love when you're in the game selling them drugs
I advise everybody go get you a job
Cause it's hard in the grave when you're slangin' the block
I look like I'm 40 and I'm only 22
I got money in my hand and dope in my shoes
Everybody don't know why his face turned blue
His best friend died, his girlfriend too (damn)
A lot of my friends, sell me rocks
I thought they really loved the game, they just on that hop
Risk your life, for some chump change
Serving 45 for a dope case
Don't nobody think when you're in that jail
You gotta pay to be there, you're payin to be in hell
So re-think when you risk the dope case
When they gave him life, you shoulda seen my bro face (DAMN) (fuck)

[Lil B speaking]
You know
Westside they grinding on the block heavy
Man, I know everybody got it
You feel me
That real, REAL, REAL, deal

Uh, yeah
Well let me tell you like this man
Everybody that rock with me

[Verse 2: Lil B]

Mm, uh

Bruh serving life, over that cream (damn)
Mm
Still up on the block with the Yee Yee Dreams
Bruh serving that life over goddamn' cream (damn)

[Lil B speaking]
