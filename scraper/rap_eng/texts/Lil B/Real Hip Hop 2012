[Intro]
Yo, yo, wasup man, ok wasup bro, (Lil B the Basedgod) yo wasup, yeah I appreciate that... Yeah man what you want, we got a lot of niggas that fuck with Wu Tang Clan and fuck with Lil B the Basedgod cause he can spit some shit... Yeah cause he keep it based

[Verse]
Niggas ask me who my real clique, I
Got love for Basedworld, man, this I
So I bring a nigga back with my recipe
Mix two bars two blunts
Now he checking me
Yeah
Uh- I'm breathless
I left the game
But the game can't starve
So I move shit back to a nigga postpone life
Pop the gat back till a bitch see the smoke light
You ain't even seen bullets
Can't even hold it right
I make sure that my niggas well
And we eating good
If it's not steak
Get a plate
And we taking yours
As a real nigga said:
"If you smell it he a sucka"
Bitch niggas smell like pussy undercover
Like a smooth bop
Getting hit with no rubber
Tried to give her fat dick like I'm Ed Lover
But the game is the game so I learned how to love it
Max a million till I can't use credit
Try to make c note till the point of note debit
In class everyday but still no credit
So I told my teacher
"Fuck you" and "Suck my dick bitch"
I told my a girl she better be a ride or die bitch
Like The Game... or Jadakiss
Kill the game, make moves like Jada Pinkett
My thought process, is thinking above thinking (yes)
You ain't reached my level nigga
I'm only thinking and rapping
Talk shit man behind your back
Fake niggas scared
That’s why they gotta put a mask on
I’m sleep by my bat bro
Knock a nigga top off like a soda
It's cool when a nigga keep it like a soldier
Man, Lil B I never fold over
Come from the hood man its respect from the shoulders
Rapping everyday hip hop having posters
How I'm at the top of the game with no promotion
Same way Lebron hit Wade when he was open
The same day people getting robbed out in Oakland
The .45 smoking
You gotta stop smoking
The gun homework man I gotta stay focused
Telling that girl man she gotta stay open
She up late like the Tom Green show and
I'm upstate like the Mobb Deep flow and
With that underground New Jersey sick flow and
The Kettiquete, Inettiquette, Mr. C flow and
That Funk Master Flex, Bomb shit, Mystikal and
Niggas in the hood man the streets know
Yeah
Niggas fuck with me over man
This- no need for a camera
I got the real acid man
It's no need for a hammer
I got the good lawyer it's no need for a slammer
You stay up late man you need
For Pajamas
Shouts out to Kuwait, The Middle East, Russia, Serbia
Man them niggas fuck with me
Palestine, Iran
Them niggas fuck with me (Somaila)
You feel me?
Aye them niggas fuck with me (Somaila)
Trinidad, New York
Man them niggas fuck with me (Africa)
Australia man they all love for free
OG man, I'm in LA in the OC
Everybody motherfucking know Lil B
2012 this the year of the gold teeth
Sit down bitch, you think you know me
Sitting in the game at the top so lonely
Only way a nigga go cop is for the homie
Only way a nigga gone cop is if he phony
Only way a bitch go shop is if she know me
Only for the weed man fuck you go pay me
That's what I start to feel man
Like I'm bill collecting man it's more bills
Bitch you never guess what if I told you what I did on the daily
Most people they start hating
Dude like me man I'm beyond hating
I ain't scared of hell man, bitch I'm beyond satan
Based God

[Outro]
