[Verse 1: Lil B]
I'm a bitch cause I brought that Bentley
I'm a bitch cause nigga I ain't ever been hurt
I'm a bitch cause I fucked your bitch
I'm a bitch cause I got waves in my hair
I'm a bitch cause I go dumb like I got dreads
Nigga play me, i'ma hit him with that infrared
I'm a bitch cause I don't leave shit
I'm a bitch cause all my girls are models and up
I'm a bitch cause nobody fucks my bitch
I guarantee nobody fucked the Based God's bitch
I'm a bitch cause I fucked in the Hummer
I'm a bitch cause I got 35 bad bitches
I'm a bitch when my money ain't straight
