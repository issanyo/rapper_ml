[Intro]
Now before we leave Red Flame...
I want to thank yall for being with me
The greatest mixtape of the century
A lot of niggas thought I couldn't do it
A lot of people hated on me
Joke's on you nigga

[Verse]
You ain't got my back, ask for a pass
Ha sh... bruh you is a fag
Hand down niggas I ain't ask for shit
Except freedom of a judge, I was a bastard kid
But my dad wasn't around, that's so wierd
And he tried to show me love, father I moved
Don't know what a man is
Grew a beard not knowing what the strands is
Paint from the canvas
They ain't put me on the original version
Now Lil B is here, the mythical version
Never rewriting or switching my verses
And the notepad the bible so I'm writing in cursive
Bruh fucked up and that's a lesson he learing
Double cross me and I'll retaliate like a German
Niggas hate on the boss, curse the soil I walk
AK-47 leave him deserted
Red beam on his chest started making him nervous
This a hospital gun, all my bullets is surgeons
Fuck around with Lil B that's the day he a virgin
Never seen a Glock 40, never seen it in person
Never seen this car or the goons that is lurking
Never seen Lil Boss flip out like a surfer
Leave your body all wet now you is a surfer
Haha I'm just a real Berkely nigga
20 blunts to the dome boy, no liquor
1 robber and I'm a cold ass nigga
Lil B for Lil Boss, that's a dope ass nigga
BasedWorld to the death, BasedGod nigga
I run this shit...

[Outro]
Thank y'all for listening to Red Flame the whole way through
And not skipping a song, that's the definition of a classic
Any rap niggas want it with me, I'm right here
Greatest to ever do it
Yeah I said it, greatest of all time
I am the goat nigga, Nas was saying this too early
I am the goat nigga
Check my history, check what I've done for the game
Red Flame, Lil B
I ain't going no where
Platinum Flame special edition coming soon...
