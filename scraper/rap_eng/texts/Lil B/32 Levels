[Verse 1: Lil B]
Thirty-two levels, first rule, stop complaining
Ain't nobody in this world waiting for the changes
You gotta do it yourself if you want results
Out of sight, out of mind, I remove myself
Out of mind, my whole mind state is out of line
Most of the time I had dark with nowhere to shine
Screaming for help but nobody can hear my voice
Rolls Royce outside, no one to drive
Seen bullets in the rain, guns in the sky
Every day my birthday, I got a big surprise
Never seen the kid, look with the devil's eyes
Grown woman and man, where do I begin?
Walking through a forest, Lil B the only person
Way past curses, nothing could scratch the surface
Every day I'm thinking, every day I'm dreaming
Lil B, Based World if you don't believe it

[Chorus: Joe Newman]
Oh, hit 'em with your faith, du, du, du, du, du
Oh, hit 'em with your faith, du, du, du, du, du
Only I, oh-oh-oh, only I, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Money shots, see where that money got you
Waiting in line, why are all these people pushing?
Shit, I'll knock your wig back, bitch, no cushion
People start crying for that fake shit
I'mma stick to the script, yeah, pulp fiction
It's all non-fiction, gangsters riding through your city
Drop tops, good spirits, but we misguided
Keep the rich people rich and the poor violent
Keep the rich far away, can't nobody find 'em
Turn your Bentley coupe to the rogue [?]
Bulletproof the hummer, yeah for my own safety
A hundred million cash, underwater waiting
Hundred thousand cash in the floorboards
If you hate rap, then what you do it for?
If you hate Lil B you better check yourself
'Cause you could change the world with nobody help

[Chorus: Joe Newman]
Oh, hit 'em with your faith, du, du, du, du, du
Oh, hit 'em with your faith, du, du, du, du, du
Only I, oh-oh-oh, only I, oh-oh-oh
