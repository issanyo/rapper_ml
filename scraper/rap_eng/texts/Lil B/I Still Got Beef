I'm still in the club with the heavy beef
Twerking off light with the red beam
Dancing like a ho to that bitch mob
25 shots, boy what's your problem?
Based jam, this the real based party
Downtown in East Oakland, sawed-off shotty
Down in Waterfront with the baby techs
Imma tell you like this, Imma fuck your bitch
Only I know about them hard times
South side, west side, I be on the grind
Like Berkeley High at the school dance
Pop a couple pills, then we go again
This pay-per-view like Triple H
Fuck her first and I might take her on a date
Big rims look like Martha Stewart
You fucking right, go dumb, count that money to it
I'm like a young nigga out in the hood
Bitch I'm strapped like Game like E-40
Task force from the block don't get me started
Straight game and the bass got my middle name
Never been a fake sucka in the mix
I stand down in the trap catch me on the lick
You might catch me with a purp zip
I'm your little eye, you can catch me on the rip
Tell me bout that money bruh
You ain't in based world, we don't fuck with you
Talk to me I talk back like a parrot
Catch me in the chop
4-door Bently with the doors open
Lil B fuck my bitch leave the door open
Imma date the girl with her mind right
Fuck her, push the pussy right
Niggas claim gangster but they really scary
Coming out with that dirty harry
Everybody got beef in the party
