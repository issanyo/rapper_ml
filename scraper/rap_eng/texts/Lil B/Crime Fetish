Crime fetish mixtape, I don't know if they ready
It's Lil B

It's a rap guy, got funk better get a strap
He fake, he ho fake, you better give him that
I did my dirt, I brought the rental back
Next time you're on my line I'm jumping into that
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't into rap
The four-four look kind of crooked with the center back
He eat, he gon eat, bring my dinner back
Every time I'm on that lick, I was the middle man
I hold them pills like the doctor man
I'm short of one man holla
Like motherfuck it bitch
Every party I'm rushing shit
With the Russian shit, got guns and the other shit
Don't lie, chrome nines and boat rides
Don't trip off that lick, I'm getting all mine
We won't talk unless it's your find
Every time I come out the game, I'm on the yard line
Shotgun, put him to sleep on his yard line
Glock 9, sending bullets through his jaw line
I gotta draw a line
Feel me? Yea, I can't hear you
Yea yea, you talkin gibberish
Pistol in your mouth lil bitch like liquorish
Yea then the, I'm nigga rich I gotta
Couple guns in the back, tip a bitch
Yea this crime fetish, I might lick a bitch
You feel me?
Get in, 2 door man, I flip a bitch
Ghost ridin the Maybach, probly fall asleep in the car, I'm talkin way back
Wear the San Francisco or a Oakland mays hat
Base boys to life, we gon take that
Yea, this that shit that bring the bay back, bitch
