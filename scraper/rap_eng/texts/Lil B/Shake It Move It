Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

Move it, move it, move it, move it
Move it, move it, shake your booty go

[Verse]
I got bitches making bold moves
Niggas play with me, what you tryna do?
Spending money on that CashApp
These hoes sucking dick but I don’t call 'em back
Actually I got that plan B
Bitches playing with me and I ain't tryna see
Can’t stand a thief, I can't stand a joke
Can't stand money, I can't stand to be broke
Do they really think that I'm confused?
I got 100 bitches that ain't make the news
Riding with my niggas
If you want this smoke I'm blowing blunts on niggas
See me really dunk on niggas
Fuck with Lil B, I'm really up on niggas
Better bet your mind that we got it right
Fuck with Lil B, we do it all night

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Move it, move it, move it, move it
Move it, move it, move it, move it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Move it, move it, move it, move it
Move it, move it, shake your booty go
