[Intro]
I'ma tell you bout something, bout Green Flame
I'ma tell you bout Green Flame
I'ma tell you - bout Green Flame
You know we doing this everyday bitch
I'm talking bout everyday

[Verse 1]
Around here, that Green Flame real dope
On the streets man them boys watching with the scope
Better duck them boys hanging out with the folks
My own friend try to play me I'ma let you know
I'ma let you know about the trials and tribulations
I'ma tell you bout the t-shirt penetrated
Never stop, been in this place before
I been down, I been bleeding nigga that's for sure
I'ma tell you bout the losses that I took
I'm in the bush, most wanted posters on it
I'm coming through, I got the toaster on me
You already know my situation demonstrated
If you know I fuck with you then it's solid
I got knowledge, taking life's college
Gambling on the table of life, stacking my money every night
I can't stomach it, right

[Hook](2x)
People over here with the shit
They ain't talking bout shit but they dying for the shit
Man my stomach hurt, man I'm coming hard bitch fuck your worth
People over here dying with the shit
They ain't talking 'bout shit but they dying for the shit
Man my stomach hurt, coming hard bitch fuck your worth

[Outro]
Like I said Green Flame, it's that Green Flame wodie
It's that motherfucking Green Flame wodie
Boys watching with the scope, it's that Green Flame wodie
Boys watching with the scope
Green Flame wodie now, it's that Green Flame bitch
Lil B this that Green Flame, ah alright
