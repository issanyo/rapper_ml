I'm loc'd out motherfucker
Aye, what the fuck you doin around here?
In my spot

One day I was riding down 6th street
Looking for some bitches that owed me
You know me I stay with that dojure
And always, it's motherfuck the rollers
Until I stay out of pocket
I might go back, I stay with the watches
Cause nigga it's my time
And everytime I rap, I'm still dropping down
I feel it, just because I'm real, and I'm ill
Bitch tell me how you feel?
And I might need Viagra, when I mash you
Cause I'm the fucking champion
Give me harder drops, in they ass
Cause this mad shit don't stop
And remember me as based God
I'm rolling one deep with the top dropped

I still got line of the all the Viju
What you wanna do, I can see through ya
Man you suckers bout my lettuce
Cabbage and the green I gets it
Man the game gets deep, I don't sleep
Cause bitch I wanna eat
I'm tired of these noodles
And these motherfuckers knocking at my door tryina Buddha
Man I don't sell no weed, I'm out here on the street bitch with the G's
These niggas still haters
When I'll make a billion dollars, y'all gonna turn to beggars
Fuck em, this is real
If I was a liar, then fuck this bitch feel me
Niggas hating on me, I'm riding 26 fuck em
And fuck these bitches

Don't nobody know bout the game I chose
I stay strapped up that's the way it goes
The bitch run in game, she another ho
I'm dipping down the block in my 64

Don't nobody know bout the game I chose
