[Chorus]
You see this money
You see these diamonds
You feel me we wrestle hard for this
Picture us
Gettin rich
All the based boy stop getting licked
I never used to hide about stuffing zips
Mansions full of money we gonna get rich

[Verse 1]
I still hustle even when a nigga dough ends
Been raw since [?]
Don't buy a car but I make stunts
Count every penny yeah I love ones
I still spend hundreds I don't throw away nothing
Jack a bitch in the club for frontin' that money
I'm so jealous, bitches poppin' that pussy
If you don't fuck with Imma knock her out
Bitch
I'm so rich I don't give a fuck
Lost respect for the world cause I'm rich as fuck
Now bitch still rich I'm cool with that
Young nigga's getting money everyone getting mad
I know I'm proud of it
She wanna fuck me with cause I'm down with it
Open up the shit see this engine
You feel me, I'mma keep on spitting

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There's suckers with money and there's some nigga's that's real
Money don't make you soft money make me feel
That I can go to war with anybody with paid bills
I can pay off the judge I can pay for real
I can fuck any bitch cause my game is ill
Money just made shit easy for real
When you get rich they say how they really feel
When you got money bitches will let you dog em
If you try to be nice they run up on you
Shout out to good girl I love when they real
When you on the grind you ain't really got no mind
When you rich you building all the time
Building my house with a piece of mind
Creating all the stars its a matter of time
I look at my clock I don't do but watch
Lil B BaseGod all I do is rock

[Chorus]
