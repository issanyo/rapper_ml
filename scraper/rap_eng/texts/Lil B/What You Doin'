[Verse 1]
I live the life of a celebrity
I came to reality I think when I’m showering (ring)
It's like when I’m like writin’ verses I’m stuck in life circus
Someone always clowning me (me)
Obvious I’m painting pictures
And I’m writing life scriptures
Can’t somebody hear me shouting (ting)
And everything they think is golden
Then they'll see life is stolen
Hey the house is over crowding (ding)
Yeah, so high, so high, (yeah)
So high, I'm so high, I'm so high (yeah)
Little Boss (yeah)

[Verse 2]
It’s more than glorious
6 Kiss celebrate by the lake
Candle light dimly lit
Let’s pray to based god
Fresh to death
Where’s the coffin
Bruh I’m gangster, bruh I’m active, bruh I’m crazy, bruh I lost it
I’m by the lake and in the forest and I wanna sing the chorus
But my mind is off and soarin’
Drive me in the oval office dunkin’
I’m off the run and stop me
But you never ever
I’m thinkin’ light years before you disrespect my gangster
I’m smoking heavy weed, I’m thankful
The vision came to me and not somebody wit no ankles because I’m runnin’, thank you
Different angles I’m speaking, aimin’ thoughts in different places
Help me am I forsaken with this based knowledge achin’
Back pain, long computer hours, hustle hard, then take a shower
Ain’t no sleepin’ in the race for power
Ain’t no talkin’ with the breath of cowards
I’m moving silence, Lil B, Based God, yes

[Hook]
Whatchu you doin’
Bruh I’m gangster
Aston Martin

Can’t you see me
I’m off the richter

I’m fucking bitches
Bruh I’m gangster
