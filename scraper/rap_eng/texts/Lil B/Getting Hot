[Intro]
It's a hot night tonight in the Bay Area
West Coast
We on motherfucking top, let's go

[Hook]
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop

[Verse 1]
Niggas get shot when I come in
Raise hell in the party, go dumb again
Young nigga, I might die
So I go dumb, every fucking night
I ain't no bitch, I be in the club
20 young girls, fucking with a thug
She don't need ID when she fuck with me
She just left prom, now she fuck with me
Berkeley in this bitch with my eyes red
Finna grow out my dreads and bust a head
All we do is go dumb, and shake feds
This is for international, Black Arthur
Gentrify me? I beg your pardon
I might have clip with a 30 in it
I might fuck a bitch, then smoke a sack
Tell all these hoes Lil B back

[Hook]
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop

[Verse 2]
I ain't never had a ... imma keep it real
Everyday my head up, when I'm in the field
Yeah, I gained weight, so I'm sizing up
I'm a fat nigga, I don't give a fuck
Donald Trump won, bitch twerk sum
Catch a bitch on a [?], put her on a [?]
Fuck that shit, imma spazz out
Fuck this shit bitch, cash out
You can go dumb if you wanna
Got a bitch on a speaker in the corner
Shout out Wiz Khalifa, I'mma stoner
It gets hot in California
Rep that squad in your face
Bitch, everybody down to catch a case
Real talk, this party turnt up
Lil B worldwide, man its one love

[Hook]
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop

[Verse 3]
This is for my street niggas who ain't in the club
You ain't let us in the club, now we run the club
I be chewing in my fork with a ...
Tryna keep my teeth clean in this ...
I done hit a couple licks I ain't acting
Ride with the FN I ain't fronting
Hit you with the motherfucking strap once
Have you crouched over like a monk
Every time we go out don't know how to act
Cal Berkeley locker room, tryna flip the pack
Walking down Telegraph, and B Town
So many bitches in the streets now
Still hitting licks for the rebound
ESPN that's me now
See a fine chick that's me now
Catch a bad bitch for the rebound

[Hook]
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the streets up cause it's getting hot
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
Turn the party up cause it don't stop
