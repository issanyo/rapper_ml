[Intro]
Yo, a lot of people ask me what I believe in
You know, I'm like, I believe in what you believe, man!
You know, I'm down with the world, man
Whatever we are, whatever we see to get by every day
But you know I respect the highest above
Everything, you know, I'm so grateful to be alive, man, it's great!

[Verse 1]
I just wanna say that God is real
Angels is waking up, man, the days we feel
Blunt shots, man they're speaking the word
Gave me the message
How can I understand it?
From a real person who lived up
Would he never knew that he would tell me this stuff
His partner over way still Kushing
Saying man, he an angel, I believe
What they speak is so real
Shit man, I really can't believe it!
Life got a little deeper meaning
Man, it's Heaven or Earth
You can't lose your joy, you lose your worth
Stress make it much worse
Kill reviving your soul, cause it's real!
Really, how I feel?
Either we're brain washed or coincidence
But angels is really shit!
I'm peeping like a person
When Jesus spit
Every person got a gift for receiving it!

Everybody got a gift for receiving it
I seen an angel, I seen an angel!

[Verse 2]
Angels is real, I'm living a life of bliss
I just pray for this
Who you? pray to what?
Who may look like pray in your heart?
I keep in touch with my inner light
My inner light shines bright
All my intentions up front
Coming for respect
I just thought of it
Now I popped up on the banner
My whole rap career is bananas
At 14 I predicted I would win
Predicted that I would get double-X L freshman
Predicted I would change the world
If I said I was an angel
Would you even believe it?
My knowledge oversees it
The blue print of my system Stay with them
You feel me?
The light keep vision, don't like to keep visions
I keep visions, see visions
Come from another place
See this, this is that real shit
I agree to that and I agree to this!
Let's spread love and see where we
And when we see that
What happens after that is Something like magic!

I believe in angels
I seen the angel
Yeah, I'm seeing angels in my mind!
