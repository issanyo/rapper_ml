[Chorus]
Rare art, rare art, rare art
This rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art

[Verse 1]
And I still might serve you
Everything for sale, bitch, yeah I'm going too
Still stellin' jerry like Hilltop mall
No security, bitch, I'm down for it all
What up Joe? What up folk? What up nigga?
What up man? Rockstar, take a picture
Watch me hit that Kurt Angle
Hit that K-rabbit, gettin' money all angles

[Chorus]
Rare art, rare art, rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Rare art, rare art, rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art

[Verse 2]
Roc-A-Fella, I think I'm JAY-Z
Niggas want problems, what it be?
Ice cold, shawty put them duds on the street
Witnesses pointin' me out, it wasn't me
Fuckers is so hard, I finesse the damn street
Finesse my main bitch, she started thinkin' she was me
I'm a real nigga, bitch, that's what it be
Finesse the damn plug the first time he met me

[Chorus]
Rare art, rare art, rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
(It's real rare art, man)
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art

[Verse 3]
Sellin' dime bags, I would never stop that
You can call me petty, I think I'm Wayne Gretzky
Finesse one partner, finesse my other partner
Finesse another beep and then I bought the chopper
Crackin' credit cards, sellin' stolen cars
Whatever I do, do it to the fullest
I'm not a rookie, survived through the bullshit
Made it through the madness, I'm not havin' it
Let's get it

[Chorus]
Rare art, rare art, rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Rare art, rare art, rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art

[Bridge]
Hit that 4runner, hit that 4runner
Hit that Kurt Angle, hit that Kurt Angle
Do the Rick Ross, do the Rick Ross, do the Rick Ross
Hit that BasedGod, hit that BasedGod

[Chorus]
Rare art, rare art, rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Rare art, rare art, rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
Extremely rare art, this rare art, this rare art
