[Intro]
This that pretty boy music, this that Lil B man
Wassup, yeah like I said, I got a lot of bitches
I walk up on bitches and I just do my thing

I'm down south

[Verse 1]
I won't let this game seduce me
Niggas take notes like it's a movie
Niggas get mad cause them bitches is boosie
But fuck them hoes man they all groupies
Bitch I'm still exquisite
I still got bitches, I'm still on the shiznits
I'm flexin' call me Based God Rambo
Based God Rambo, I set examples

[Hook] x4
I won't let this game seduce me
I won't let this motherfucking game seduce me

[Verse 2]
I fucked a couple hoes thats boosie
I choke a bitch out cause I hate groupies
I hate snitches and I hate groupies
Bitch she wanna fuck me and she tryna sue me
But it's all good, I put hands on groupies
You know how I rock I'll rape ya bitch, sue me
Push the bitch out the car like that nigga Gucci
Savage ass Africans, I'm bout that movie
But I'm Native American, where's my casino?
Where's my dice, I'm about to roll that 8
I got good luck bitch, that's all day
I put hands on bitches and I deal with rape

[Hook] x4
I won't let this game seduce me
I won't let this motherfucking game seduce me
