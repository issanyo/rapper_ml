[Intro]
I lived that life, yes
Yes, Beezy-B, Beezy-B
I'm a criminal nigga
That's all I ever had lil nigga
Ask yourself, ask yourself...
Am I really that bad, nigga?

[Verse 1]
You got choices, I ain't gonna express my feelings
I'm a criminal nigga, close door to healing
I guess I'm used to seeing close door to willing
Now I'm getting reps, haters all on that ill shit
Its like I'm getting cold or it's time I can't deal with
A lot of niggas hate it that I speak on that real shit
I can't be a felon putting time behind bars
Nigga I been ghost riding putting mine over yours
Plus the pen ghost writing putting time behind bars
And I'm really kind of sick and I ain't got no SARS
I'm a criminal nigga, don't shave the scar
Had a young life of crime getting money for cars
Had so many cars
Pass them out like cards
Gettin' 500, 700 a whip, a nigga still emotionally scarred
The answers of a criminal, the voice of a boss
Now the Next question where is the floss

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a dumb-ass
Got caught up, couldn't run fast
Now I'm in the back of squad cars going dumb fast
Just over money, now I feel I want to dump cash
After effects of my high, I feel like a drunk ass
Really can't sleep good, feel I wanna punch glass
How I get caught? Not me I'm a criminal
Feel like a whirlwind surrounding me, individual
Didn't learn the aftermath
Yea, fuck class
But the aftermath getting shadier than palm trees
Cutting to my weed, getting high off my bomb weed
Piss on my self, feel like a disgrace, to my mom's seed
Feel like a criminal, I guess It's what the law needs
After effects like the X, go suck it
Or listen to my music, parents had no discussion
I'm a closed off writer, no eating at supper
I'm a criminal, hate it or love it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Money is the object, flossing is my problem
Flossing get you fucked up, flossing make you rob them
I even thought to shot 'em
The Bay Area, got to sleep with your eyes open
Best nigga put you to sleep, with your eyes open
Watch the whole deed
Look sad how it revolve around money and weed
Plus the boss for the bitches just to get on they knees
It's gone cum so it come fast, pick up the speed
Cause the mayor's taking pictures of streets
Statistics got me fucked up in the presence of heat
Heat make it hotter, beat a nigga ass if he snitching on B
You can tell that nigga scared he was scratching his spot
Trying to get a friend again like he be having a rock
That's why bitches get clapped and caught you know who you is
Real niggas survive the bout
I was locked up, that's why I got out

[Outro]
Pray everynight
The Pack nigga
Big ups, L on the beats
All the people who supported me through that hard time
You know who you were and I love you for that
Am I really that bad?
I ain't a criminal nigga
