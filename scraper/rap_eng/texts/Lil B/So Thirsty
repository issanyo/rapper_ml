[Intro: Lil B]
(Sound of Lil B sipping)
Girl I'm so thirsty

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Put that pussy on my plate, let me get a taste
Only eat that shit first, like it's a race
Girl move your body, to the fucking bass
Talking to the girl, I be in her face
Young ass nigga with a lot of cake
Blue maybach nigga, no plates
I wanna fuck the bitch, like it's Christmas
Lil B wanna drink and I'm not tripping
Tell the bitch, you can get low
I got bread bitch, I ain't even tripping though
Rock 5 chains, nigga fuck gold
I'm an OG nigga with a young ho
Running them things in '04
Counting that cash in the store though
Bitch wanna fuck, you know me
The bitch wanna fuck cause I'm Lil B
I do this thing, for my nig-(interrupted by the sound of Lil B sipping)

Damn! That girl fine in the pink
Finna cool off, and go have a drink

[Hook: Lil B]
So thirsty, girl I'm so thirsty
I'm so thirsty, girl I'm so thirsty (x6)

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Had the day off on Sunday
I'm thinking bout girls on Monday
Bought a couple ho's on Tuesday

Take a couple trips on Thursday
Friday, that's my day
Well, maybe that's her day
Finna trick on a bitch cause I'm thirsty
Do it like that, cause it's like that
5'7'' nigga with a lot of swag
Drive the same car as the president
Punk rock nigga with a bad bitch
With a square ho
Trippin off bread, I don't care ho
Finna beat the pussy don't hurt me
Please give me a cold drink cause I'm thirsty

[Hook: Lil B]
So thirsty, girl I'm so thirsty
I'm so thirsty, girl I'm so thirsty (x6)

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Put a punk rock bitch on the map
I'ma pull a fuckin rabbit out a hat
See a girl, she don't know how to act
Touch her butt then a nigga get slapped
I'm a whistle at the girl like, whoop!
I'm a whistle at the girl like, whoop!
I'm a whistle at the girl like
Oo-oo girl can you take the pic?
Wanna ask the girl do she strip
I'm finna play for the bitch
I'ma be the trick of the year

And I'ma be the trickin of the year
And it ain't nothing if you got it, you hear?

[Hook: Lil B]
So thirsty, girl I'm so thirsty
I'm so thirsty, girl I'm so thirsty (x6)
