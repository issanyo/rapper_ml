Welcome to Thugged Out Pissed Off. Get money, bitch. Do your thing, bitch. Go crazy in this hoe. Front me, know what I'm saying. Real niggas in this bitch stand up, Lil B

[Verse 1]
Front me a bag of dope bitch
You the plug, I know you bitch
I'm New Orleans with my woodie
Then I sign
Beating bitches up, that's where I'm goin'
Beat the bitch up cause I know she hoeing
If the bitch ain't mine then I'm jealous
Bitch racist, I tell her to fuck
Bitch sellin' pussy, how you racist?
You don't fuck, bitch you [?]
Got cocaine line, bitch I'm crazy
Dunk in the trunk, I instigate it
Niggas snortin' dope, kidnappin'
Might hit a bitch with that .44
If the bitch racist then she gotta go
Bitch sellin' pussy then she got issues
Down on your luck bitch you need some tissue
Every day slidin' in a different rental
[?] just that simple
AK got titties, Glock 9 got nipples
Niggas got sticks and bruh got pistols
Big bruh got a lot, big bruh got issues
Big bruh told me that I'm not a faggot
Big bruh [?] I smother a faggot
I don't give a fuck man, the Bay the [?]
Stay with that, stay with that shit
You feel me, play with coke and [?]
Bitch know me and I won't stop
Smokin' bitch like it's a party
Stackin' bags bitch [?]
Never know that I got that bag
Bitch never know that I got that cash, Lil B

[Hook]
All I want is money, off top for the money
All my niggas [?] for the money
If you gettin' money throw your squad up money
If you gettin' money throw your turf up money
All I want is money, off top for the money
All my niggas [?] for the money
If you gettin' money throw your squad up money
If you gettin' money throw your turf up money

[Verse 2]
Yeah I been broke I can't take it no more
Shout out to West Oakland, shout out North Oakland
Shout out East Oakland, feel me
Shout out Richmond cause I need a ho
Shout out Danville cause I need a ho
Shout out Pittsburgh cause I need a ho
If the bitch ain't payin' then she gotta go
The bitch gotta buy food or somethin'
Cheap ass bitch wanna front for free
I'ma tell her cash out if she fuckin' with me
All I do is sell Jerry's and make belief
The bitch tellin' lies said she know Lil B
I don't know that bitch, she ain't fuck me
I don't know no bitch that love me
I gotta keep it real, I love myself
Sellin' jerry everyday is bad for your health
Fee-fi-fo-fum bitch need some money
Fee-fi-fo-fum bitch I'm not a dummy
