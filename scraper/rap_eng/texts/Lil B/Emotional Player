(Hook : Lil B)

All I wanna do...
All I wanna do... (I like you)

(Verse 1 : Lil B)
I'mma keep it real about this bitch I love
Going straight to the song break the swishers up
Every nigga know whats up, she got handcuffs
Yeah I love you girl, but Im tryna fuck
She say Im moving fast, life is fast
Moving at the slow pace on the freeway, you crash
Bitch keep asking bout the monkey on my back
Bitch I'm clean as ever, drugging hard forever
Made a bet to myself, I'mma be rich forever
Niggas misssed they time I ain't gon' miss it never
When Girls see me shes seen a God
RIP Mac Dre we gon' keep it live
I go so hard on a bitch, I cried
Call me EP, Emotional Player
We handcuff the bitch , I love her hair
Got the keys to the city cause she fucked the mayor
Im Lil Boss...
Its Lil B

(Hook : Lil B)
All I want is youuuuuu
I'mma tell you about..

(Verse 2 : Lil B)
I was thinking bout when niggas was thugged out
He ain't got no bitches, too much stressing
Strapped up mugging, was no guessing
Don't want the game I'mma teach you a lesson
Respect to the bitch if she pay yo bills
Love your house and your neighbors will
Niggas talk that shit till the game for real
Ain't gon' fall back, Nigga I came to kill
Hardhat nigga cause I came to drill
Niggas playing with me like Im Dr. Phil
Feel me? and you Fresh Prince
Maybach '62 with the dark tints
Niggas don't really know till you gotta live it
Feel me? Happy thanksgiving
You feel me? I been robbing dealers
45 cap peeler
Lil Boss

(Hook : Lil B)

(Verse 3 : Lil B)
Moving too slow, get your ass burned
It ain't no perm it ain't your turn
Its word from God, let the indo burn
Get clapped from the back like the game over
Break it down bitch cause my game overt
Dressing up with the Italian shirt, niggas like me
I be pushing dimes at work
Till I got legal, I don't live illegal
Ain't gon catch me in jail because my money low
Big money make her jealous, this dummy go
I'mma put six in where the money go
I go hard on the sucka, where my money go?
Late night in the hood letting hundreds blow
And celebrate motherfucker if you had fonk before
I come from the West where they let nothing go
I had to tell you suckas let my nuts go

Lil Boss
You feel me? And keep that motherfucking dro
