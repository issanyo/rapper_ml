I'm upside down

I'm in control of the night-time
Shout out to AE
Shaka Zulu
Niggas is hurting like Twilight
Hiding from the daylight
I can't have nobody see me
Secretive
Upside down next to my brothers
God licking holy water
The cross is something altogether I stay away from
One bite, you'll be gone forever
Look me in my eyes, I look normal
Deep inside I've got a problem
Often I won't acknowledge
People just think I'm awkward
Sleep up in the coffin
No speakers
A lot of smoke but no reefer
A lot of people take their life for granted
I'm cursed and can't stand it
Damned it
Niggas canned and played out
Your blood come in handy
I've got a taste for human flesh
Some call me up
Sandy
She thinks I'm cute
And normal
She gives me her soul because I'm abnormal
She feels that I'm better than whoever

We have a problem
She got me thinking by 12 o'clock
I be another person
She the perfect sacrifice for dessert
I stay working
Baby, just calm down
Feel weird my hands are numb
Fangs coming out my teeth
Am I done?
Am I spun?
Fuck that
I'm a vampire
Fuck that
I hide a Moses in the back of my Naga Cerebro
Looking like Professor X when he met the leader
Very converted
My heartless nights
I'm sure I had a purpose
But I forgot it
The influential person
They put me down in my brain
I followed because it was a mirror of pain
Peep this
Monkey see, monkey do
You look like me, I look like you
I was clouded by thinking
My conscience tore apart
Until I lost the greatest heart
I stopped fighting vampires
Like it? They loved it
Another soul for destruction
Upside down
Then
Nightmares is now

I'm a vampire now!
Don't let the vampires get you
No
Don't let the vampires get youuuuu
No
Don't let the vampires get you
No
Don't let the vampires get youuuu
No
Don't let the vampires get youuuuuuuu
OoOOooHHHOOoh
Don't let the vampires get you
