[Intro - Lil B]
Salute to my niggas that really love me, ya feel me
And shouts out to the niggas that hate me
It's your boy Lil B
One time for the one time, ya feel me
One of the most important people, artists, ever to touch the mic

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
Yeah, I trust no nigga
Keep my eyes wide open
Fuck around and hit 'em up
You would think that I smoked them
Niggas hatin' on me, fuck it
I'm gonna extort 'em
Man I can't just love you first, it's just August
When I was doin' bad, you was flexin' in orbit
Niggas bullshits exhausting, niggas act stupid
Everyday it's tripping (eh)
That Glock outside
My mind on positive, but niggas gotta live
Put niggas underground, I got a pass from the Pastor
My past was so shady
Anvils, animals
On top at the standstill
Why my young niggas cooking dope in the pan still
Won't niggas wake up
You die to get ya cake up
That put you in positions where you gotta wear that make up
I never was made up
Fuck niggas break up
I keep it so real and my shit sound made up
You niggas hatin' on me, I dare you, put your cake up
Educated street nigga, I'm doin' time like Jacob
Still pushin' lines, niggas still flexin' a mill
Ya feel me, I'm just tryin to get right
Little shit ain't buzzing, bitch ain't no discussion
I'm 100% Gutta
My mind on education, human rights
Niggas hatin' on me
I see it, its blatant
Bro keep on flopping
I can't respect that car
Get your head blew off for fucking not respecting the team
Bossman in this bitch, doing time to hear me
If you keep repeating shit, you get......that's disgusting
Shit we all want this, I'm addicted, this shit is nothing
I mix mine with the henny, you suckas ain't lifted
I'm at the bus stop with o's, niggas ain't feeling me

[Interlude]

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
I got what I was handed
Put that feel with advancement
Understand my situation, an average person couldn't stand it
The hood like a desert, niggas left me out stranded
Took a trip to the spot, workin' from my laptop
Can't sit back, niggas wanna see my back drop
Niggas wanna go for cheap, that make my heart stop
I can't fuck with 'em, them niggas all stop
I let you niggas jaw drop
BITCH, Lil B nigga
