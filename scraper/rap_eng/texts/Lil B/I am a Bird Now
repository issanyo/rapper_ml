I am a bird now
I feel like I was a bird for some time, my life
I fly away, I come back, I grind
I am a bird now
See what I see
Think what I think
But no one understands
When you're in the dark
By yourself
I am a bird now
Because I travel alone
My throne is multiple places
Fly over the world, the water
See things no one else sees
Comes back, takes it in
Insecurities within
I fend for my self-defend
Dive in the water
Past the sharks, come back up
Profitable food eaten
Move to the next city
Like I'm touring
Something what a bird does
Tours around the world
I am a bird now
I am a bird now, watch me wind
Watch me fly, watch me swim
Hunt the prey down
As I sit back and I think
I am a bird now
I am a bird now for being
The single thing everybody wanted me to see in
Believing undercover
Most things don't
But most things roll
Probably my heart goes as far as it could
Understand that the hood is good
Fly over things, normally I wouldn't
You should probably be a bird
Experience new things, based levels, base
Undercover while I sit back
I feel like I'm in a
Underground fortress by myself
My heart is something red
Don't no one understand
How I feel, what I do
How I think, how are you
Some things we do and some things
It's amazing to see what some things bring
I am a bird now
Some things brave, life brings
I'm just so stressed out to see that
Some of the mistakes I made yesterday
Still affect me today
I want to be a bird and fly away
I found out my wings are inside of me
I am a bird now, let me fly
I am a bird now
I waited so long for this
So many years to become a bird
I just want to fly away
No one understands why I feel the way I do
Just understand my heart
I bring something evident
I bring something amazing
I don't even know if it's American
But very American
I feel like I'm overseas
Floating like a bird
Migrating, something like touring on a plane
First class migration
Birds with food in my mouth
Understand, I hunt the prey, spit them out
This is something you can't see like a
Underground level
Something that's beyond disheveled
Deeper than the shovel
Can't take you on a shuttle to get here
Nothing like space, something in your mind
Only contained by the grind
Something that no one else can find
I am a bird now
My based level has confined
And defined me as a person
Soul searching
Find out that I'm not worthless
All I can do is continue to be me
I will burst something that is amazing to me
That will help me continue to move
I am a bird now so I groove
I am a bird now so I move
I am supposed to move
Let me float, I am a bird
