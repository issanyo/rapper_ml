(Intro)
Sound like that shit, you know, that a nigga be on daily, you feel me, 05 fuck em, yeah man, mixtape, I know a lot of my real people been waiting for me, you know I got you man, they love it

(Verse 1: Lil B)
Imma play it closer then I hit you with the strap
Imma say this shit again 2pac ain't dead
It's a lot of real niggas, that feel like me
And for real, I'm the only one
And I only been the only one, the only one with money
The only nigga with a plan
Niggas talk shit, and they sent to the grave
Imma tell em like this man motherfuck the game
And I'm thinking niggas just playing
But Imma keep it real, I'm like fuck it I'm just saying
It's no love in the industry
I lay a nigga down when he here or he in the streets
And fuck a bitch when she in the streets
If he calling Lil B, Lil B got my back
And I got his back
Stomach like a six-pack

(Chorus: Lil B)
All these suckas got me fucked up, I'm sending faggots to the grave
Guess what, nigga man up, You caught a body nigga stand up
My booties kill at will, Ain't nobody putting bandz up

(Verse 2: Lil B)
I rape niggas, cause I take shit seriously
If I fucked a girl, she love me period
You can hear in my words as I take it seriously
It take one to know one
I'm a gangsta period
Fuck with real niggas, and the small people
And the good people
Doorways, Dope fiends
Niggas know me
I'm trying to flip cars like niggas on the street
I'm out in the east, with my niggas from the D
We all respect each other cause we all from the streets
I'm a suburban nigga cause I'm hot
Rolling in the suburban, switching to the Excursion
Making pussy bleed, Take them sucka's dolla bills
Young nigga worth a billion, that's how I feel
That's on paper, that shits real
Lil B, Imma fuck ya
And then I love ya
All the girls want to tell me that I'm crazy
Dumb bitch, it's me or the navy
What it Do
