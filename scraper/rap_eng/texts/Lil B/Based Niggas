[Intro]
Red Flame
Yeah, nigga, I got some real hate in my heart
Lil B rep that 7 block, my nigga
Bitch Mob in this muhfucka, tiny pants, everything
Nigga, I'm strapped up with a thirty dick with the tiny pants, nigga
100, bitch

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I got swag
I beg your pardon
Based God, tiny shirts and Aston Martins
Thirty clip on me
Shotgun on me
I'm high and I'm lonely
Nigga play, then I'm testin' him
Fifty bitches on my dick, ho; come again
I can't hear you in the new Phantom
Hood niggas, bitch, I don't believe in Santa
Cause I'm comin' in your house myself
Merry Christmas, Lil B got a thirty round
Happy New Year, Lil B be bulletproof
Gung Hay Fat Choy, bitch, I will shoot
Niggas
Punch me on YouTube
Now I'm huntin' for a nigga like Blue's Clues
Now I'm huntin' for a nigga like a racist
Peekaboo, bitch, your car's spade of aces

[Hook]
They call me deala (DEALA!)
They say we killas (KILLAS!)
Who we be? (what?)
Based niggas
Hah, bruh, they say we dealas (DEALAS!)
They call me killa (the killa!)
Who we be?
Based niggas
[X2]

[Verse 2]
First time I robbed a bitch I was fifteen
I'm a goon so these girls be scared of me
Got the gun in my tiny pants, I'm a faggot
Buy my girlfriend a bitch, wouldn't let me have it
Probation ain't shit to me
What the fuck I did last year is history
Westside, I'm an old bitch
Bitch Mob, tiny pants with the thirty clips
This ain't a love song, no Ryan Leslie
I got AKs
Bitch, I'm Phill Collins
Got shotguns
Bitch, I'm George Clooney
Only nigga in the hood with a pink Uzi
Lied to the bitch
I won't buy the pussy
And I'm rich and I still won't buy her Gucci
I rob a bitch
Trickin' cash
Bitch Mob, pretty bitch, you can kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'll leave you in the chair like Ethan Hawke
So many bitches on my dick, I can't even talk
And I'm still reppin' Waterfront
And I still got these gold fronts
