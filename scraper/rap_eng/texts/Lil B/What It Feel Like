[Intro]
Real shit, mane
Realest muthafucka doin' it
Realest man alive

[Verse 1]
Billion dollar man, with a big plan
Won't keep my head to the sky, ain't gon' slip again
Fuck with me
Right, I'm a back burn
Leave him with a back burn
The K got 34 bullets Jamal Mashburn
Mash niggas that they think better than mua
Nigga I'm Based God
I'm working like a day job
I be sendin' thirty that gon' hit you up real quick
Get it correct I be the only one that-
Beef with me, suck his health
Hollow tips beat your ass like a fucking belt
And I got the belt, nigga

[Bridge]
Real talk, nigga
I don't give a fuck what I say, what I feel, what you feel, what you do
Nigga, this young Based God
Lil B in this muthafucka
Never gave a fuck, nigga

I'm in this muthafucka making history, nigga

[Verse 2]
I'm right, sometimes it don't feel right
Remember I was broke as a joke, know what it feels like
Grinding on blocks, the same ones that kill, right?
People surgin' pills of white, and I know what it feels like
Until niggas try to block me from my deal like
I wasn't putting in work on nights - What?
Like my eyes wasn't red from that fucking pain
I gave twenty years of my life, nigga, it's fuck the game
And I don't fuck with mark niggas, that's - What?
Been here, niggas, and I could peep your game
And I know you fucking with me because my fucking fame
Shooting them guns, nigga, you fucking played
Shotgun the barber, giving you niggas fades
You can tell I'm a real nigga, muthafuck your grades
Lil B, nigga, the realest out
My nigga just come out my mouth
Freestyle, boy

[Outro]
Lil B, mane
