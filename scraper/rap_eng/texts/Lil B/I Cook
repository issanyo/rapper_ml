Word around town that your girl likes to cook
Swagged up rich and I looks that good

Yeah she cook good, master chef chop
Thirty on my dick cause I look like Ben Baller
When I walk in all the girls get quiet

Pay a couple dollars and watch the movie in 3D
Girl off the juice and she's cussing like a sailor

Watch a master chef I put the cooking on the map
