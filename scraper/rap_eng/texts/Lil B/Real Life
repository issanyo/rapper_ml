[Intro]
Keep your head up
It's real life
Keep your head up

[Verse 1]
I know your mom died and I feel your pain
That’s why I’m sitting in the dark sparking up this flame
And you lost your dad too
And he’s still a soldier
Please don’t let the grind stop
Know that life ain’t over
Seeing you cry some nights
With your head down
Hurt my heart like a stroke
That you go  unfed now
Don’t let the pain crush your mind
And yourself man
I’mma hold you down for real
It just crossed my mind
How the days pass when you’re not looking
But a death in your family got all the pictures crooked
Plus your grandma and your grandpa
Life is too short to be living with your head hung
Keep it up
Keep your head up
Know that you could make it

[Verse 2]
Brother didn’t snitch and he took that bid
He didn’t know what time was 'til he took that bid
Just look him in his eyes
Said two plus ten
I ain’t know what math was
But that’s two plus ten
No one asked why he felt that pain
Why he got so mad
Loaded up and cocked that back
Didn’t ask why he hit those licks
His whole family dying
Plus he scared that the drugs don’t mix
And he mad that the drugs exist
Whole family apart ‘cause the buzz is it
And they rather get high than to hug their kids
Man, I look him in his eyes and he hate that shit
I did this for you, bro
And everything is good
Someone love you

[Verse 3]
Lady from the hood
Swear she got no answer
Gotta raise three kids
But she got breast cancer
And we know rent due when the bank won’t answer
Wanna move out the hood and defeat that cancer
I ask how she stay on her feet like dancers
How she keep on adding paint to a life-size canvas
She told me every day that you must take chances
If you’re living in the past then there’s no enhancements
She said life’s hard but the dreams do matter
Only way to read books is if you move through chapters
She said spread love of pain and promise
And she died the next day
That’s what made me honest
It’s real life
Take everybody like they’re a million dollars
You never know

[Verse 4]
Girl Seventeen got to fix her posture
Always getting beat down by her deadbeat father
He’d say nice things
But it’d be so awkward
When he’d drink alcohol
Then he’d slap her mama
Now Girl Seventeen
Call men imposters
What he did to her mind caused way more drama
She walked out the house
Said no more drama
Had to fend for herself
So she stayed with partners
She met a nice dude and his name was Seante
And he ran a little game and proceed to boss her
Because she want a man nothing like her father
She would do anything for a dude that bothered
Seante made her start having sex for dollars
And it really hurt my heart every time I saw her
Deep down inside all she want is a father
So I never judge a book by its cover
Girl Seventeen having sex for hours
Staying up long nights
Even missed a shower
Had to deal with the pain off pills and powder
Taking long drives home on the road for hours
Sex with many men
Even dealt with cowards
Wouldn’t put the condom on
‘Cause he felt the power
Seante got sick, had to call the doctor
Said he didn’t feel well and his head was nauseus
Girl Seventeen, started to get real cautious
‘Cause Seante never said what was in that office
Seante came home looking like he lost it
So Girl Seventeen went to kiss him
He said, “Don’t touch me, I’m HIV positive”

[Outro]
Just make sure you use condoms
And never judge a book by its cover
That’s why, when I look at people now
I don’t know what they’re going through
You don’t know what anybody’s going through
So you gotta respect it
It's Lil B
All these are real stories
And I want to dedicate every verse to y'all
I know all of us can relate to this
Just let the beat cry for you, I'm crying for you
But I gotta let this song cry
