[Intro]
I thank y'all
This is Angels Exodus
I'm gonna leave y'all with some gems
This is all from my heart, remember that

[Verse 1]
Obstacle of things, write, write and go
Niggas try to stop, but I keep going
I'm gonna keep writing, and I'm gonna keep flowing
You're in a state of mind, love your own body
Share your happiness, spread to lonely bodies
Won't spark probably, take the first steps
Hand takes the peace and its guaranteed
Real gonna salute, fake dudes bleed
Fake niggas scream, they done lost they passion
I'mma stay in overdrive, I'm gonna keep gassing
Love me for who I am, who I'm not
Who I'm gonna be, who is in my past
Making history, swear I'm writing books
It's a lifesaver
It's a true lifesaver
Amen

[Verse 2]
I demand myself, I demand for myself no kiddie stable
Had the best information, never fables
Never talks, I just keep it realer
Lost my own bid, kept it trilla
Hard work, yeah
Girls love me, I know it
Our duty as people to be collaborators
Jamba Juice, shaking
Lets keep it shaking
You feel me?

[Outro]
My rap style is like connect the dots, you feel me?
I don't gotta say some things because its like, you're filling that blank for your life
I don't say nothing for nothing
Connect the dots
Angels Exodus, this is history
