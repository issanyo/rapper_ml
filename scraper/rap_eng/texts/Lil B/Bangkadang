Bangkadang, I hit that main thang
Rappin is easy but it ain't mayne
Hittin' 'em head first like a safety
Thinkin safelay but my mind in constant chatter
Like when you lookin at a stripper and you throwin money at her
I guess I'm not a joke and not a fashion
These boys are playin but im positive so ain't no actin
And im just lookin learnin from, the situation
Life is just a message
Asks for praise instead of presents
A rapper's presence showin that the gift is in the message
Young Bull a beast, plus im movin
With direction, so you should help em
Face down, straight down
Im swimmin through the beat looking for the breakdown
Sometimes I get mad, sometimes I just breakdown
But you can never see, like you put your face down
I got the race now, I can see the snakes now
And I dont need a gun, I dont need a pistowl
Im the kind of guy to use a sword
Cuz im a savage
Put the b up in the beats, ima lettem have it
Lil b for lil savage lil b for revolution
Asks the earth is rebirth
Mighty mighty as savages, the world is too precious to second guess it
Im in it im in it movin like im married
Brrrrandkadang I'm schizo
My brain movin like missiles
I can't stop it, its like im retarded boy, with the pencil
Dont switch it, never be up on da chick back
Cuz you gonna tell a friend that you want it back
Thirsty dry, but healthy when you want a tap
Dont trip, just quarterback

Breakdown
I love when she sucks my dick
Oh I love love she sucks my dick
Shes so smooth
And shes so smooth
Shes so shes so shes soooooooooo
Shes sooooo shes sooooooooooo
Squirt in her squirt in her
I love it when shes sucks my dick
Cuz I love it when shes sucks my dick

Rejoice everyone

Everything is so peaceful
Everything is so peaceful to me to me
Ecstasy with me
Because I love when she sucks my dick
Because I love when she sucks my dick
My diiiii iii iiii iiiii iiii iiiii ckkk iick
