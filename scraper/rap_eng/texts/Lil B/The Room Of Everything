Yes
A nigga feel like I should be scateboarding to this, even though I don't skateboard, you feel me?
I fuck with the skateboarders, though man. You know what I mean?
I fuck with the rebellious. Ultimate rebel shit

Verse 1
Let me tell you how I feel
Crawl before I walk, and talk because I'm real
Everybody hate me cause my name's Lil B
Waterfront boy, represent 7th street
Can't believe that mind is focused, came from the bottom, now my book is open
Came from the hood, let me tell you what's good
Things that made me like I bust your ass, [?], shoes is nasty, walkin down the street broke but my mind happy
Have you seen a nigga smoke dope of the corner of his hands
His album from white to grey
Man, I can't believe some things, sometimes I feel like it was all a dream
Walkin back work, my fate was things, my life I live--man--
A lot of times we pass that pot of gold, a lot of fake things don't glitter
You better watch that, you better watch that
And its soft bout the cream, devil nigga selling drugs that the government bring
And he hit the block playing the grown man game
But why you playin when everybody lose the game that you playin?
Damn, I don't even know what's the sense of playing the game anymore sometimes, you know
Like I said, I'm just getting the shit off my mind, you know
Niggas don't got to fuck with me, they can, you feel me, like
Shit is really based over here, niggas is just depict the thoughts

Verse 2
Keep it real, man, I don't forget your name
Lot of these bitches lame, and suckas too
Niggas rather drive by, then come talk to you
And say hi, side with the hard to shoot cause the ones that's picked is often you
Saw them clips to get em off of you, strip you of the bloods and get them off of you
My mama wear caution, go in the shoes
Niggas don't know about the pain and soon
I want to welcome you all to the room of doom
This is the room of doom, the room of pain, the room of everything
