[Intro:]
Yo check this out, bitch ya hear me?
I just copped that new hoe ya bitch
Ya know I just got that new Bentley, ya heard me nigga
We do everything in the Gold House bitch
Tiny shirts, pink shirts
Tiny pants everything
I don't wear nothing baggy no more

[Verse:]
Bitch I do everything now I ice my wrist
This bitch ain't nothing, on this bitch
Smoking a 150 inch TV
My remote look like a DVD player
In the library, I was reading books when you was fucking hoes in they ass
I'm about that cash nigga green on greeter
Fuck that oil, that ain't nothing
Can't nobody fuck the BasedGod's bitch
I... Bitch Mob, you feel me?
I rep Bitch Mob cause that hoe ain't shit
And I ain't gone die for it cause that doe ain't shit
Nigga play your cards right cause the doe ain't shit
Nigga riding 4 door had to hold they clip
Nigga open 2 door and that, ain't flip
Hide back in drive through that bitch
Got the mask up, I'm with them
No help, I'm a one man army
But I ride on 'em man I'm a veteran
Put a 9 on your back like a letterman
Now-a-days, I don't know the fake or real
The fake ones, be the geeked up squad, ya feel me?
You wanna speak you can speak a deal
Yea, but what's the fucking issue
Need some tissue, nigga save yourself
Don't play yourself, Gold House mixtape
Lil B back Bitch Mob
So you know what's happening
Did it for the world, mother fuck the rapping
Now I know that you like me bitch
It's Friday, my day off
In the hood with a beautiful bitch
Im that pretty bitch, that gangster shit
