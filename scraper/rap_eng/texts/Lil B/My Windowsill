[Intro]
My windowsill as I sit and I think
Take me away
Take me away

[Chorus 1]
My windowsill, my windowsill
I see, I see the light
My windowsill, my windowsill
I just wanna live my life

[Verse]
Coming to senses
I look out the window of life
Opportunity, unity, form a community
Gangs aren't bad, you need to incorporate
Stop the violence and hate
My window frame is large
They say the hood is bad
A community of people often brought together from the neighborhood
I see the light in the situation
Ten dudes from the block, it's no confrontation
Just celebrating where they're from
Proud of being where they claim
What's your name? See my frame?
Alter-ego keeps me level even though the sunlight keeps the gun right
Blast off in the gun fight
Wolves are everywhere, this is not the forest
Mount Everest where you at? Explore it
In the hood so I'm looking forward
To another day humbled by the close reactions
All have a common story of pain
My nerves relax with the marijuana
But in truth I smoke myself into a coma
Dozing off at the thought that I might have lost
The single thought that meant the most
Need a pad to write the mental notes
Often I wanna choke from the image that I picture
I see people going through this, I can't explain even image how they deal
I salute the real, I salute the real
Understanding that I'm this ill and this how I feel
Killer learn to love
Choice number 2, none above the people
Ground the soil keep the balance, hell on earth
I said but we are not far from Satan
How the world turns I swear
We fight over territory
Now fight for the right to live
Fight for the right to give
Give back despite the get back
Cause what you get back might double the gift wrap
Lost a lot of love but I never forgot that
Probably lose my mind but I'll never forget rap

[Chorus 2]
My windowsill, my windowsill
I just, I see the light
My windowsill, my windowsill
I just wanna, I just wanna live my life
My windowsill, my windowsill
I see the light
My windowsill, my windowsill
I just wanna, I just wanna live my life
My windowsill

[Outro]
Rain In England
