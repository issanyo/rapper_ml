[Lil B Talking]
Real niggas
I need y'all to put y'all lighters up
Red Flame Mixtape Lil B
This is where... Just listen

[Verse 1]
Word around town, this shit a trip
Word around town, that yo girl on my dick
Yen-Yen shawty, duffle bag thrower
Bitches On My Dick, Cause I look like Ed Roper
10 on my nuts and I'm hot like Folger's
Yea, and my boys bout that action
Young Based God Come Solid No Actin
7th Street Gangster, Tiny Pants Mobster
Ridin on 30's, bra got the 30 round
Anybody hate me, my cuz gon lay him down
Every man growing up, it's street on the street
I'm the type of bitch to knock the hat off his feet

[Chorus]
Just you and me, I want to know
Is this 4real are you for sure
My Life today, I have to know
I have to know(x2)

[Verse 2]
Came with the business, high off these riches
Everybody hate me, people think I'm crazy
Now I'm strapped up wit two guns like the Navy
Now I got the 40 round, now I got the AK
Live positive, but them cowards try to bring me down
Nigga know I got that AK with that 90 round
Nigga's playing with me, people pray against me
One man army, strapped with the Tommy
Bulletproof vest, you know I'm ridin down the slab
TV in the truck, with the steering wheel glass
RIP Pimp C, Lil B a gangsta, Bitch this Red Flame and these suckas keep hatin

Are You 4real, Are you for sure
Huh, nigga this red flame I forgot the chrous and I don't give a fuck yall niggas gon have to wait till the second one bitch

[Chorus x4]

Red flame my nigga had to slow it down, Lil B, rawest rapper alive, greatest to ever do it
