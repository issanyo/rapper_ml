[Intro: Lil B]
(No, they train ‘em to put on a uniform that the police have been trained to attack. Let me just finish —)
Yeah, we gotta stop all that, uh, prejudgement, you know what I mean? You know shit’s been going on for a couple of years, but, you know, like I said, man, we just gotta keep that shit pushin’. 2013, we gotta start fresh, new mind-state. You know, have life easier for the kids after us

[Verse 1]
Keep talkin' the past, but we livin in the future
We the most advanced, thank God for computers
But that comment might not be fair
The big bang make everything clear
Got hated on with my niggas in here
But understand that shit, it's what I wear
You act like "whatever," but truth is there
Family at war and troops is dead
Feel me? "Why I'm saggin'? I want answer," man
This is just my kilt
Look at the wrong way you might get killed
The earth - no love - this is how I feel
Everybody tryna say belong to this
You belong to that, we in the group with
This
We gon' call you that
And we gon' act like this
You gon' act like this
You don't understand
Take time to find, watch everyday for the dotted lines
This shit don't seem right, then it really might be what it act like
The door started open when my cash got right
They should've open doors for my people last night
When I say people, I'm talking about you
In the game man, we got to stick like glue
Back to back subjects, niggas in Paris
Niggas in jail, niggas in Sweden, niggas is terrorist
Niggas had history with your grandparents, yeah
Man, everybody know it's the time that we cherish
Live your own life and don't worry 'bout acceptance
Please talk to me if you really hear the message
Ain't nothin' wrong with the person asking questions
If I know it, then I'm a teach a lesson
I won't go to jail, and I won't pay your profession
I learn my laws so my family stay protected
I'm a spread love when I pass in a second
You already know so you won't ask me questions
I'm the rawest out man ain't no questions
One man band with the chopper on the dresser
Move low-key make them suckers under pressure
Pressure bust pipes with the shit that I tote
Make niggas think twice about stretchers
And I'm not with the rape or the hood
Going to the hood, and shit on the hood
Oil refineries, the water no good
It's a lot of love but no money in the hood
No focus man, when it come down to it
Rather stay in your house than go walk around
How you really love me when you don't know?
How you gon' live life if we don't grow
2013 we gotta have more peace in the world
Just understand me
Everybody speak, you ain't gotta correct
Cause you don't understand just decypher the message
You will get way farther than the person who is guessin'
Really love people, that's my first suggestion
Really take a look at yourself in the mirror
Can it get any clearer? The first impression
People keep sayin' that I never make it
I say I'm alive so I already made it
Be happy what you got, cause it can be taken
By earth, or a home invasion
I don't support crime
One crime one bit when the heart's innocent
You feel me? Only self-defense
But, people use their words so loosely
I swear man, I love life, it's like a movie

[Outro]
Wear my saggy pants
I'm a keep saggin, I'm a keep saggin
Fuck that it's fashion
