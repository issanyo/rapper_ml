[Intro]
Captain Captain, Everybody's based and
They're in the little Toy Factory, come on
Let's go to the Based Toy Factory
Where everything gets made, all the Based accessories
Lil B

[Verse:1 Lil B]
Man I'm loving this place, this is a amazing place
Where they make the based accessories, based toys, based face
And I feel like I'm in space yes
And everything in here is so marvelous
And its' teddy bears and candy, it feels like Candyland The Based Candyland
So when I walk I sit in sand, and when i sit down I'm sitting in the land
I do it with my pen and I don't need a pen to see it
Or write it down and I see it and I believe it
Its in my heart, something that I gotta spark
And I cannot think about it, it's just something from the dark
See it in the dark or the light, its whatever
You got to get into a mental trance boy, getting sweaters
Getting blessed in a sweater
Getting in a- getting in a Based Toy Story

[Interlude]
Its getting deeper, its getting deeper
Uh huh
Yea
It's getting deeper, its getting deeper
Alright, alright

[verse:2 Lil B]
Man , I swear to god that this is the first time that I ever seen the props
Or the based things in the cellar, looking at the Toy story, better make sure you make it better
When the based toys is coming out they're adequate-ing
I like the action figures that you put in back of them
Everything that you stacked on, stacked writing
Put in the right order, yes right to writing
Very nice and thank you
That when we're in the Based place I feel so, Thank You

Holler at me one day, we're in the 3-D world
A hundred percent boy, little boys and the girls
Welcome to the toy store, Based Toy Story
We're in this thing for the Glory
