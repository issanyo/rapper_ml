[Intro]
This is a sad day
(Based World Orchestra, please come to the front)
This is the part of life where we stop
And we sit, and we think
And we cry, and we wonder
And we get depressed, and we get upset
This is death

[Chorus]
This is the part of life where we stop
And we sit, and we think
And we cry, and we wonder
And we get depressed, and we get upset
This is death

[Verse 1]
This is death firsthand; horrible to see this
Just a life form now lifeless
Some young, some old
Some unborn, some close
Some things are not fair
Our friend taken up the stairs without notice
You can at least tell me I’m being evicted of our friendship forever
I wish there was a teller to tell you
To humble out the situation
This is bad; this is real bad
Nobody understands the pain

[Verse 2]
I can’t sleep; my heart number
My stomach cringes at the thought
One year process to fully get over what has happened
A major loss in the family
This is what brings us together?
Death?
That’s sad
Well at least
Now
We do know once
We will sleep
This is a mission you meet
Maybe it’s not bad
It could be sweet
Should be sweet
Peaceful at ease
No longer scared to breathe
Relieved of the need
Can now fully rest without work
They truly deserve to be at peace with the earth
Live on
Your spirit is the light for the world
Life for the Earth

Chorus 2X
