[Intro]
Lil B, I'm really thugged out
You know the streets really fuck with me
And even if they don't, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm still yelling Waterfront
All my niggas dying
I'm still on the block holding red lighters
I keep hearing sirens, but it's no fires
I hold my niggas down on them cold nights
More respect, my back hurting
My life not working
A whole lot potential It's all instrumental
I'm married to the pencil
If you slippin then I'm watching, guarantee we hit you
This my last chance
My last dance
My last five dollars
My last package
Every time I hit licks I got so happy
Niggas kept on snitchin I hit em' with the ratchet (Bang)

[Bridge]
You know what I'm saying 05 fuck em
Only thug stories, you feel me?
You probably in the hood right now, you feel me?
You might be in the mansion getting money, you feel me?
This thug shit nigga connected nigga

[Verse 2]
I hit so many licks I got traumatized at a early age
Traumatized, I was making suckers feel pain with that dirty hairy
How the fuck I'm gon' eat with no damn chairs?
Eating french fries in them paper bags
I need dope bitch, and I need it fast
Fast cash slow money, I seen it before
I was posted at the store
Niggas posted, hating on me
Bitch, you supposed to hate me
Bulletproof never that
One love bitch to the all the homies


[Outro]
You know what I'm saying, I'm merking
I'm merking and I'm going shopping, after
Imma' murk and then imma' go shopping right after
I got a lot of bitches
Niggas understand this, when you a real thug
When you really Based
Shout out to Lil B man
That's all imma say
05 Fuck Em'
