[Intro]
There's a lot of shit I'm still waiting for
Still wondering
Crying on this notepad

[Verse 1]
Still waiting on healthcare, praying on welfare
Gotta take my my hand up, gotta move my mind in
Spend a lot of time there, getting on my grind there
Throwing gang signs then, got a peace of mind there
But I can't leave 'cause I know a piece of mine there
People I grew up with don't wanna see me shining
So I grew up with a lot of things?
People do bad stuff, wanna stay away from it
Got my mind right so I won't sleep in the casket
Death around the corner and life is in the basket
That's left from a woman, cause
The death of a woman means one less man
So give respect to a woman
I guess we just looking, if you could see how I see it
It's pain in your eyes, show em, bleed how I'm bleeding
Just wanna talk, just one thing, won't forget what you did
Just accept one thing: I'm still waiting
You know there's so much in my life
I feel like I'm still waiting, you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
You could pick and choose, you could win or lose
You could sink or swim, you could stay or move
Just had to amass, I match the groove
I match the plan, I match the mood
Even though I'm from the hood, I'm a classy dude
Like Nat King Cole, I'm a faster blues
I have the blues just hearing news
Can't go a while without seeing the food
Am I just a judge, am I just in love
This thing called life, can I give it a hug?
Can I trust in thugs? Don't hold no grudge
Niggas love to hate but don't show no love
And that's old man thinking
If you closed-minded thugging, that's no man's hustle
No house, no home, no car, no bucket
No old, no young, but the ladies love him
It's Lil B, I still hustle from the bottom to the top
Let the bitch niggas know that I wonâ€™t stop

[Verse 3]
The hood feel like the invisible hood
I'm the ghost in the trees, I produce this wood
I rap on the tracks that make the block
Go crazy and the suburbs love me, word to cousin
Right around the time I was hurting, struggling
This dude had my back, gave me motivation
I was asleep on the floor in the midst of the haters
Taking trips with the money, paying for some changes
Things started changing slowly
Had the floor map, even helped the homies
Got a new ride just to show the homie
Bought my main bitch a flight, kissed her, says she's lonely
I don't love her, groupie's a bitch, that's word to Stunna
Shoutout to Birdman, that's word to Stunna
I touch down in the hood, I'm off the flight and blunted
Lil Boss, I'm hundreds
