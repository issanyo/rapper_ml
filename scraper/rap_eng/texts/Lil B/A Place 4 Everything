(Intro)
Yo yo what's poppin y'all?
Hey thank y'all for comin' here with me today
I wanted to tell y'all about
A place for everything
It's called Basedworld where
You know
We all can go
Check me out I wanna tell y'all a little bit about this
My name's Lil B
(Go B!)
(Yesssssss)

(Verse 1)
Thank you!
For the kind applause, I'm grateful
'Cus alotta new rap has became distasteful
A place for everything where the greats will face you
A place for everything where the saints will thank you
Up on the cloud where the space is vacant
Only if you seen cuz the space is sacred
Only if you know that the gift is ancient
Had to gift wrap the box to make sure you'll take it
Cuz I'm not a thief but I'm sure he'll take it
A place for everything where I know he'll make it
You have a hot song
No need to break it
Just focus on the focus command and conquer
Playing minigames your (yeah) life like Contra (like Contra)
(?) the contract like the people offer
A place where the new is the best encouters
When he come clean
But never clean no counters
My mom said "B, you gotta work for hours"
So I don't think that I showered
And that's no lie
A place where your dreams is power
Where the man who don't live is pronounced a coward
A spot where if you don't laugh you're sour
Where time don't fly it's just walkin' hours
So....
I present my paper
And hope that you like my statement
A place where
Don't nobody care who changing
Where the women are walkin' naked
Like the drink
I drink from the fountain of Eden
One scratch so I moved to Sweden
And that's no lie
Got sick like E.coli
My primetime game time like Teo time
Plus I'm in the rap game no Teo time
Time out if you wanna go to sleep on top
A place for everything is a gift off top
A place where everybody love to watch
A place for the plants and the seeds off crops
Where the man's your best friend
Not the dogs on leashes
Where we don't compare our speeches
I said well we don't compare our speeches
Cus we all equal
Negative is the real time evil
But that's not in
Basedworld we a branch of people
A place for everything
It's a place for you
It takes us too
But don't checkout food
Food for thought
It's my food for soul
Had to eat 10 times just to clean your bowl
Feel..most def
Feel dreams is soul
Cuz everybody dreams is go
Just pick and roll
I said just pick and roll
(Yesssss!)
(Yes!)

(Verse 2)

Cus I wasn't done thank you for your applauses
A place where everything is the natural causes
I....had to think about it
Life is like a gun don't wanna be without it
This is for you and the peace without it
Cus without the peace, everybody piece is shoutin'
I'm talkin AK's Glock 9's and Rugers
If I was slick I would'a been the ruler
Another word for ya medulla
I said another word for ya medulla (x3)

(Outro)
It's lil boss
Brang thang thang (boss)
(Yess!)
It's Lil B for Lil Boss (I said another word for ya medulla)
Feel me?(Another word for ya medulla)
Shouts out to the Bay Area man (I said Another word for ya medulla)
Who said Hyphy is dead?
Yeah!
Hey!
It's your boy Lil B man (Ah x5)
Basedgod in this motherfucker
So based out of space you feel me? (I don't see any reason why uh, this song shouldn't be a hit)
Thank y'all for comin' with me man and I love y'all man (I said another word for ya medulla)
Thank y'all for bein' here with me
I just wanted to tell y'all (Laaaaa)
A place for everything (I said another word for ya medulla)
Everything is legal
You feel me?
A place where everything is acceptable
You feel me? (Yesss!)
Basedworld
The only world. (Ah.)
