[Verse 1: Lil B]
Where you from, scary ass nigga?
We be in the club on bitches
Niggas get rocked everyday
I be in the club with a K
I be at work with a hammer
Tryin to invest in a ladder
Niggas out here get splattered
I don't leave the house without a hammer
Don't get shot in the face
Back door your fam broad day
Back door your kids in your face (face)
Fake ass nigga, don't play
Feeling hostile in the club
Selling our dope in the club
We don't give a fuck
Nah, we don't give a fuck
