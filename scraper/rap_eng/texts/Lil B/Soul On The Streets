[Verse 1 - Lil B]
Basedworld gon' gas you
Got the dope in the attic, cut it then bag it
Like my little bruh said you gotta focus with passing
I got a whole lot of passion eating the fruits of Christ
Niggas done ran in my spot again, they leaving
Im in East Oakland with my girl riding around and tweaking
Posted in apartments her and two brothers
Got the chopper nigga to hit the dice game just to watch him drop it
Her dad drinking all the beer, he talking bout his own year
Nobody knowing that Im finna make my home there
Setting up shop on the block its my throne there

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
Uh, I'll holla at you
Im still duckin cause you know where them stakes staying at you
I pop back with the gat thats not safe to handle
I grip the handle same way that you hold the candle
I think Im bam-pshh closed , I steal the ammo
I hold the ammo battlefield, can I handle?
Shouts out to the soldiers, marines and the navy
Come save me, Im at war and going crazy
Inner cities remind of me of
Remote locations, shady places Im thinking about losing situations
But Im- fuck it Im steady through it, fuck em hating
