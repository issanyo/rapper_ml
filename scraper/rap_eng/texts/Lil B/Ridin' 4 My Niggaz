(Intro)
Code Of Honor
You know I told my niggas I'mma ride for life
I'mma Stick with 'em for life, my close ones, I got you
Shit, I'm riding till the death (Yessss)
It's your boy Lil Boss

(Verse 1)
In case I'm gone tonight, I told 'em I'mma ride for life
X me out the game, I leave they frame with the dynamite
Expertise in homicide, with my crew it's tamper with
You riding in the snow with Lugz boots and the hammers
Mr. MC with long bananas
Clips will leave you grindin'
Eat em up, no Aunt Jemima
Ridin' with the pump inside 'em
Garbage let me dump inside 'em
Fightin' when I'm ridin tenant
Ridin' for my closest niggas
Talkin' like it's motion sickness
Eat em with the quickness

(Yeah, I'm ridin' for my niggas
It's your boy Lil B
Shit I'm ridin' for my niggas
6 Kiss, you know what I mean
6 Kiss, you ridin' for your niggas cousin
I'm ridin' for my niggas
Better ride for my niggas
I love y'all niggas man)

(Verse 2)
Thinking like survivors
Before we enter hell, have to mentally prepare
Had to dig beneath myself
And make no angels in this hell
When you ridin' to the death
It's a secret code of honor
Only shared with a few close
Closer than mustache with top lip
I must stash the pump six
The clip like a drum stick
Batter of my left fist
Is Leftwich, pumped in, pump fake, pump breaks
The hospital was looking like a clear lake
A lotta preying/praying invertebrate
Nasty when you in the haze
I demonstrate, then orchestrate
My weaponry is auto-tuned, autobahn the automatic
Leave the shots off, leave em in a hot dog
I'm ridin for my niggas bruh

(Ridin for my niggas man
I'm ridin' for my niggas, 6 Kiss
Shit is so crazy man, 6 times though
You know what I mean
Shit, Lil B, 6 Kiss, I'm ridin' for my niggas
Lil Boss)
