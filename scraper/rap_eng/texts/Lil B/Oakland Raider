[Verse 1]
I keep the hammer cocked
I strip you and your pops
I keep a real bitch
I'm hungry like [?]
I'm in the hood like [?]
When my niggas died I swear to God I let the candle drop
I was thinking bout life before my mans got popped
The same old story I was broke, the same old story
Young nigga wanted stripes and I wanted glory
How you gon' tell me I was facing forty?
All my niggas catching cases but I wanted trophies
I was staying in the streets like them rollie pollies
Niggas ain't from the hood, that's what they told
Bruh I'm connected to them down downs and OG's
Front seat in my coup make your nose bleed
Bitch keep your mouth shut, I'm the OG
Skinny nigga with the weed and the nose bleed
I'ma chop down these bricks for the OG
Peep this I'm building schools with the dope money
Nigga had it like me I got the ho coming
Bruh tell you like this I'm building schools nigga
I'm building ten schools, nigga fuck with me
Young niggas my age say I'm 35
35 years old bitch I'm finna ride
Bitch I'm finna phone her like I fucking love her
Call me daytime bitch no I hate her
Bitch you know I'm on the block like the Oakland Raiders
Rich nigga in the hood like the Oakland Raiders
