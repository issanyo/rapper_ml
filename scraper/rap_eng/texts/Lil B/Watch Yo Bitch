[Intro: Lil B]
Uh, better watch these bitches
You better watch these- you better watch these females, these bitches
You better watch these bitches
Remember females and bitches are different and all that, ya know?
Bitches like the motherfuckers that'll do ya down bad bruh

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Now it started off playtime, close to nighttime
I'm with my girl and she fine
We chillin, we blowing, watching movies on the flat-screen
I'm telling all my goals and she tell me all her dreams
I felt like this was the realist shit ever man
I really met a girl that was down wit me forever agh
That's what I thought but lets get to the message man
I got up off the couch and walked to the kitchen
Right when I opened up the fucking refrigerator man
I heard a loud scream, I started to think about my neighbor
Yo, baby, you hear that? That shit was soundin crazy man
My next door neighbor with all them goddamn babies
She laughed it off, I went back to the couch
That's when I heard another bang and I couldn't figure it out
I opened up my door man and cleared the peephole out
But this shit fucked up and I couldn't see out
And my girl walked to the door because she think that I'm trippin
And I thought she had my back.. she slippin
My next door neighbor, he opened up the gate
Something was weird, "shhh, look at his face!"
I looked at him and he looked like he was on drug
I went back to my house to go get my gun
He started banging on the door, I ran upstairs
Made sure I locked the door, started loading all my bullets in the Glock
Cockin the pistol top, my wife acting weird because.. she not freaking out
And I'm thinking nothing of it, I'm just thinking wasup?
Told her go back in the corner and go watch my back
If this dude come in, I'm finna lay em flat
Ima open up the door and he still on my mat
I gripped my Glock 9 and let 14 splat
And his face blew off, my girl she seen it all
I ain't gone lie, I was scared as a muhfucka dog
I dropped the gun and sat back on the couch
My wife screamed, "I can't believe that shit happened right now!"
I told her I love her, no matter what the fuck happened
No money in my savings, I'm walking on mattresses
Public defendant, not public defending, shit!
I think ahead because I seen dudes that's been thru it
I went outside, picked up the body and called the police
I had the brains while I shot em, they came fast
Dropped me to the ground, they said I was finna go all the way down
They arrested my girl and they searched the whole damn house
Next thing I know, I'm in jail with my fucking hands out
All day thinking about a call to my girlfriend
I heard a couple things, I'm in a whirlwind
That's when the shit got sick man
The weeks go by, the DEA recodes all the rights and shit and a bunch of names
They said they had my wife down in interrogation
And I won't believe the shit I found in the situation
They took her phone back at the house and they checked thru her messages, facts came out
She was texting homeboy to come rob her boyfriend so she knew about the whole situation in the end
Watch Yo Bitch

[Outro: Lil B:]
