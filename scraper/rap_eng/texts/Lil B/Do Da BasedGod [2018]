[Verse 1]
Ooh (Woop woop!) Snap!
Fall up in the club and we do that Arab (Damn!)
Watch me lean and rock (Rock!)
Watch me snap and pop (Pop!)
Watch me do that Fabo, I'mma do that Yung Joc (Damn!)
Or I'm doin' that Shawty Lo or I'm doin' that re-rock
When we in the club, I do that BasedGod (Swag swag!)
Knuck if you buck, nigga what's happening?
Everybody know I'm at that west end trappin'
I don't catch hate, lemonade (Lemonade)
In that booty club, I'm gonna make it rain
Go tell the DJ to play my song
We spendin' so much money, I don't wanna go home
Call me Young Thug, cause nigga I'm a thug
Shout out Metro Boomin, man we goin' to the club
Cost a hundred bands for a motherfuckin' show
And we gon keep dancing until the club close

Shout out Zone 4, shout out Zone 6
Shout out Georgia, I think I'm filthy rich
First I lift my head, then I make a snap
You ain't doin' it right, just relax
Shoot! Shoot, shoot, shoot! (Woop!)
Shoot! Shoot, shoot, shoot!
Throw that money out the roof, roof, roof!
So shoot, so shoot, so shoot
So shoot, so shoot, so shoot
Throw that money out the roof, roof, roof! (BasedGod)
Bring it on up, up, up, bring it on up, up, up
