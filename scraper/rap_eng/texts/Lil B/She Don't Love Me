(Intro)
Man I know that she don't love me
Lying bitch
Yeah I know that she don't love me
It's ya boy Lil B
Man I know that she don't love me
Lyin' bitch
I know she don't love me
It's ya boy Lil B
I know she don't love me

Bitch say she love me more
I can't believe that bastard
Lookin' straight in the eyes, wanna flash like cameras
Can't believe how these ho's tell you lies, romancin'
Woulda never start to smoke if I knew bout cancer
Woulda never gave my heart, never take those chances
But she told me I was worth that risk
Repeat that answer, baby girl you was rare like [?]
5'5", right side, then you think I'm handsome
You asleep in the bed, fall asleep with NASA
Pussy way too good had to see my pastor, shit
Yes
But bitch I know you don't love me
Bitch I know you don't love me

Things really got bad when you said you loved me
And I don't think you really love me
I can see how you hug me
Just because the sex good, you was attached to that
I couldn't trust you wouldn't cheat, you would show your ass
Shoulda played mind games how you played with mine
We would meet late night and proceed to grind
Bust a nut in you now I want my seed to die
Because you not my real wife, just a sweet disguise
Had to take a long walk just to see the skies
Couldn't talk about nothin' you as fake as God, bitch
Shit, I know she don' love me
Bitch, I know you don't love me

No disrespect, I believe in God
I ain't never seen God but I seen her eyes
Every chick on Earth need to prove she real
Give a fuck about how she feel
This is how I feel
You keep it real then I kept it realer
I want to be ya king bitch, but you live in "Thriller"
And you don't understand the real cause the game is realer
You done lost a real man for a fake ass nigga
Bitch you think he give a fuck, he just want your sister
And you party too much and you drink that liquor
And you can't ever have a man like me you deserve a filler
You can't ever show love to a ho in Prada
Cuz' her head fucked up, man I blame her mama
I'm young but conscious
For your love I would just pay a few fuckin' dollars
Real love is priceless
Tag and Isus
You really love her then my best advice is
Fuck her till she treat you like a king
And I mean that shit
Man fuck her till she tell you a king bitch

Outro:
Yeah, real shit man
You know what I mean man?
Need these hoes to treat you like a motherfucking king bruh
Cuz' these hoes ain't shit bruh
I guarantee you that man, these hoes'll lie to you, all that shit man
For that dick, you know what I mean
Just for that dick
Just cuz' they want your money
Just cuz' they want what you love man
I tell you like this man, these hoes ain't shit bruh
You bitches gotta prove that shit man
Till further notice man all you bitches ain't shit
You know what I mean? Straight up, you know what I mean?
Only the girls that love me for me that's wassup
Y'all the women
Other than that, fuck you bitches
You know what I mean? Fuck em'
