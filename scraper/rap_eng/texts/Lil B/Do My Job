[Intro: Lil B]
OK, OK, oh my god, oh my god!

It's a Bitch Mob party! I got a lot of bitches!
Lil B! Look at me! (WOOP!)

[Verse One]
Bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
Got me fucked up, nigga, don't act surprised
I'm swagged up! Bitch, way above the rim
Bitch Mob; Nigga, go tell a friend
Matter of fact, mothafucka, I'mma tell the world
Tiny shirt, tiny pants, I'mma fuck your girl
And I still go dumb, ask the bitches about it
Flex 52 bitches; call me Mr. Richmond
Bitch suck my dick ‘cause I’m riding on 30’s
