Don't try to post up, you can't make a shot
Hall of fame players don't miss a lot
I'm ballin' in the game without taking shots
I assist and I pass the rock
Don't try to post up, if you can't make a shot
Hall of fame players don't miss a lot
I'm ballin' in the game, taking shots
I assist and I pass the rock

[Verse]
I pass the rock, like Cuttino Mobley
Hittin' bitches with the Glock, like Raymond Felton
I bet she did something, I bet she hurt his heart
Ballin' in the game too hard in the dark
Stay there, light make you feel like they can't talk
Confessions is the dark, I'm professing my problems
Talk to my teammates before the game, strategize a plan
Cause we gotta win, if we lose we try again
One shot, finna drive again
Believe in myself, yeah, cause we gotta win
I'ma drive again, if we gotta win
Hit the road on the bus, yeah, you could fly with them
Trynna make peace, better show peace
Before my piece, nobody care when you deceased
Live to the fullest, not behind the silver bullet
Niggas ain't gon' feed you shit, but bullshit
I ain't trynna talk, I'm just talking to my agent
And playing for a new team
I'm really 'bout gleaning, fuck niggas scared of...
Every day, news shaking up
No one prepared for it, you feel me? We comin' here buddy
This is all good, I'm getting good messages
On the jet, rubbing my hands
This is money, and niggas showin' respect
Shout out to my agent trynna pall up a check
You know we gettin' reps
I got scouts lookin' at me, bitch, I'm the best
