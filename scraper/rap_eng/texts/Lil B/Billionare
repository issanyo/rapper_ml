[Verse 1]
The bitch look mad, you're stressed out
I don't give a shit, fuck her in the mouth
Bitch Mob niggas know what we about
Thank you BasedGod, fuck my bitch now
Everybody know the BasedGod fucked my bitch
I'm out in Detroit tryna hit a lick
Everybody know BasedGod fucked my bitch
Everybody scream "BasedGod fucked my bitch!"
[?] with that...

BasedGod, I want a fat bitch
In Beverley Hills getting ratchet
Shout out to LA, them some real niggas

And tell that ho I need a hundred thou

[Chorus]
The BasedGod just fucked my bitch (Real nigga)

[Verse 2]
And I buy hoes
Hundred thousand for a show, that's just how it goes
Fuck my bitch BasedGod, I'm fat now
Pretty boys in this bitch, I'm getting racks now
I'm a OG, the whole 5'9"
What that mean bitch, tall as a glass of wine
Did you drink or did you get drunk?
Nigga do I look a fucking punk?
Do I look like I got jumped?
All these bitches look like Taylor Swift
Nigga play with me, get the whole K clip
Pulled out the ladder then I made him strip
Shout out to Richmond on that gangster shit
Shout out to Berkley on that gangster shit
Shout out San Francisco on that gangster shit
Wordwide Lil B, I'm on the map bitch

[Chorus]
The BasedGod just fucked my bitch (Real nigga)
He just fucked my bitch
