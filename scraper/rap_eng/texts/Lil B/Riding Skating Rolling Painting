[Intro]
This that sound
This that pop shit
This that new pop shit
This that mainstream

[Verse 1]
Shout out San Francisco and the tech world
I'm still getting rich up in BasedWorld
Everybody know my name is Lil B
Taking photographs when I'm on the street
You might catch me on Telegraph
Fourth Street, that's the real art scene
My music inspires architects, building planners, and niggas in the projects
924 Gilman, I'm a member
That building getting hot up in the winter
I can't forgive sinners
Why you making dinner just to say you didn't
Louis Vutton rap flow
My eyes don't see shit man, they stay closed
Live by a code that's hard to crack
Kanye to the Reddit, and all of that

[Chorus]
Riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
Riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting

[Verse 2]
I like to skate, put my [?] in rotations
This demonstration carved in the pavement
I made my mark, connected like Bart
[?] I gave it heart
I got that woo, gold in my teeth
Drum in a loop, I got the proof
[?] welcome to real
How does it feel?
You're rolling with the poetry [?]

[Chorus]
Riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting

[Verse 3]
Ayy you know I love where I'm from
Oakland, CA with my hooligans in the sun
Getting high at the lake watching bad ones run
While we talk about all the shit we just done
Yeah my [?] sliding anywhere we see fit
Cause we some culture kids and we with the shit
Ain't with the drama but if you trip on my fam
This phone call my momma leave you salty like Spam yeah
We just all wanna live and be free
So why don't you join me?
I swear success is right in your reach
Don't let your situation define you
Or let negativity run true
There's a lot of things people said I wouldn't do but I'm doing it now
And how they look like fools, I laugh when they smile

[Chorus]
Riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting

[Verse 4]
Last night I had a problem sleeping
Every time I doze off feel like I'm diving off the deep end
All this pain on me got me on defense
[?]
I give you what you want, I ride and paint you
Painting the city, somebody find me an angel
I got some moves up my sleeve, Kurt Angle
I got some bruises over me, I overcame them yeah
Pardon me if you don't understand my language
I'm verbally painting all of the sins where I came from
It's obvious I'm dedicated to life
But I'm also dedicated for an occasion at night
I'm also dedicated trying to make things right
But every time I see the light feel like it made me blind yeah
Just riding

[Chorus]
Riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
I've been riding, skating, rolling, painting
