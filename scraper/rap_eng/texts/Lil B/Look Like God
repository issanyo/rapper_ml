[Intro]
Oh my God BasedGod, you so fresh
You got a lot of bitches...

[Verse]
All the girls love Lil B fo' sho
They say I look good with the X and O's
She can drive in the coupe I can floss my wrist
The president said Based God fuck my bitch
I'm a super star known all across the globe
From Japan, Asia and back to Rome
New York, Brooklyn and Harlem
The girls say Lil B you a star
Like that I don't know but I'm just the best
You can come to the show and touch my chest
I got a lot of money I don't got to front
The bitch sucked my dick for a half of month
I made history and I don't even try
You don't love Based God? That's a goddamn lie
Fuck your bitch in her mouth cause he disrespects me
Big game to the world and I'm casper check it
Big plays in the world but down on ass bitches
I like a girl from a town bitch
I look good bitch you don't gotta lie
Bitch don't cry cause I know the Based God
Bitch I know Lil B last time he fucked my bitch on the street
Last time, bitch it ain't no last time
Where the Based God? He on my damn mind
New York City got girls like Diddy
I ain't go to prom cause I'm too pretty
All the girls call me Lil B
I don't care bitch I look like God
I look like motherfucking
Ye you know who I look like
I look like Chauncey Billups
I love the Based God you gotta feel me
Hey tell these hoes to suck my dick

[Hook]
The bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
The bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
The bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
The bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
The bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
The bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
The bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
The bitch suck my dick cause I look like God
