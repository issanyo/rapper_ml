[Intro]
Yeah, it's your boy Lil Boss
Based Freestyling
Feel like I'm in the wind, feel like I'm in the trees
Just feel me one time, I'm very spiritual
It feels good to see the world in colors
You feel me, multiple colors

[Verse 1]
I'm trying to live where everyone's your brother
Trying to live where everyone's your sister
Rebuild the family
And when you rebuild the family, that's when everything comes together like a sandwich
Mustard and mayonaise and bread and meat, that's all you need
No homo, you feel me
But the woman and the man were supposed to meet
And your personal preference is up to you
Your sexuallity is up to you
I don't hate, do your thing
Just know when my CD come out, buy the tape
Support me, support B, cause I support you
And this is real life moves
Transparent, I see in color blue
I see in color blue
Real transparent, I see in color blue
Color blue, real transparent

[Verse 2]
I see in color red sometimes when stuff gets a little heated
And when I'm relaxed I see in green, or in blue, or in yellow
Light green is a very nice color to express things
Maybe mix it with the yellow
Turn the color like Jell-O

[Hook]
I see in blue, in green, in yellow
I see in blue, green, and yellow
I see in blue, green, and yellow
I see in blue, green, and yellow

[Verse 3]
I see a million, I'm talking a million thoughts
I see, I see my motivation right in the motivation
Above the motivation
Put you in a place, you can't even say it
All you can do is play it
Replaying it in your mind forces you to play it
Don't fight the thoughts
I'm talking real, don't fight the thoughts
That's your mind telling you what you like
Might not be what you want to hear
But it's definitely in your hair

[Hook]

[Outro]
I see all the beautiful colors
One day, I'll let my body float
As I'm in the environment
One with the trees, one with the Earth
I'll be able to float spiritually
I can have my beautiful woman by my side
Where I can expose all my gifts to her
Not material gifts, but the gifts that come from your heart
The love, the caring
I feel like it's time
Find the inner gifts to look in your soul
The inner colors
And realize that life is in colors
For better or for worse
From the Earth to the dirt
We're all one
Realize that we are all one
And we all one
