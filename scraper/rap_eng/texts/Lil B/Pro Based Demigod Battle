[Intro]
Captain! Captain!
Come down stairs right now
I need to show you something
Something's not right
What's going on?
Turn on everything, captain
Turn on the based lights
Turn on everything in this place
We need to see
Captain, captain are you awake
Lil B, are you okay? Lil B?

Man I told you I'm alive
Man I told you I'm alright
I cannot see, I feel so
I feel so unreal, this is not real
Captain help me
Captain I feel like the Based demigods are trying to take me over
But they're on another level, another level I've never experienced
Captain just get the Based elixir from the top of the floor
Say "brang-dang-dang" two times and come back down stairs
Captain hurry up before I perish
These demigods are something scary
I cannot imagine, I never thought that I would be
Laying down upon a mattress
My head down I'm feeling like an ass
Based demigod, it's in the past
And they're trying to defeat me only have
100 minutes trying to defeat B


Let me out!
Oh my god what's going on in my head?
Captain hurry up! Captain!

Pro Based demigods, I took over his soul
You will never come back and
By the minute faster, by the minute
Based Demigods

Pro Based demigod
Everything in seem
Captain 66, you're next


Captain, captain. Lil B
Captain is next
You are next
Pro Based Demigods
Based freestyling
We will get the BasedGod
