[Verse 1]
30 on my hip, it's a 30 on my hip
Ridin' around Oakland, tryna cop a zip
Squeeze on your whip
Bounced out, with the ladder on the shit
28, with a ladder on the hip
Tryna keep it player, see you bitches later
Free all my niggas that's locked in the pen'
If you let 'em out, won't get locked up again
Feelin' like First Fridays
Bring the cars out on the highway
And we can profile
Switchin' four lanes, turn the music up loud
If you really on the hype
Come through, we can go out tonight
We can ride through the streets
I gotta keep a gun on the seat

[Chorus]
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my name Lil B
I gotta have tints when I'm ridin' through the east
And my girl Filipino
She dancin' at a bar in Reno
I gotta keep it lit
Up in the club with a chop' on the hip
If they don't let us in
Shoot this bitch up and won't come back again
We be feelin' so hostile
Up in the club with the 30 round
I'm feelin' like a rockstar
Do a high speed past the cop car
I do this for my young niggas
'Cause everybody know that I fuck with ya
I gotta keep it lit
Up in the club with a chop' on the hip

[Chorus]
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?

[Verse 3]
We can ride through the west
See the high rise, fuck with the best
You need to tap in
Ten stolen cars, I was maney back then
Worked at Nike 'cause I'm all about a check
Pick up my partner, all we do is flex
This what it do
Hit the sideshow, do the woopty-woo
You can save all the chit chat
And no, I don't smoke on them Zig Zags
I just smoke blunts
See me in the club with a choppa in the front
Might go and hit the ho, stroke
Hit the club and get a couple more
That's what it do
In VIP with a ladder in the room

[Chorus]
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
Hold up, hold up, what's the hold up?
