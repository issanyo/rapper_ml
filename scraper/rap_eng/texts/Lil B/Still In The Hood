You see me in the trap nigga
Yea, I'm still in the hood bitch
But why they call me general while I'm driving in my Bentley
Got this scope on the block cause jealous niggas envy
If you shot up in this car when they rise through the city
Got us heated here light as in unit like 50
Moving in this willow city gotta bounce back 50
Niggas play the NBA but they lift his ass to meet me
I respect following niggas, devoted stay with me
I can feel it in the air, tell them bitches come and get me
You know I'm based living, hold the toast in the semi
Make a toast that you hear me, always been friendly
But niggas so fake, you gotta hit em with the cake
If you survive in the baze then you will be okay
They wanna lift the block, I still heat the heat
Niggas call it the trap but it's the travels
