[Intro - Imogen Heap]
You and me between the sheets, it just doesn't get better than this
The many windswept yellow stickies of my mind
Or the molten emotional front line
I couldn't care less, I'm transfixed in this absolute bliss

[Intro - Lil B]
Illusions of Grandeur
This is my pain and this is my life
(Pray for me once again)
(Pray for my safety and pray for my health)
I have so many questions
(Based World look over me)
I'm based for life
(Please give me the strength to keep going)
I was a robber, turned positive

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
The plans started out
One guy, one gun
Another person, so add one
Two people, one gun
One car they stole it from
An unknown, ride slow
One bottle of alcohol
Two people with bad thoughts
One time to lose it all
You never learn, you never fail
Never walk, you never crawl
Back to the subject
One lesson, two knuckle-heads
One listen to the other
They both robbing for the supper
Lord forgive them
One is... The product of the environment
Good upbringing with no father
I'm sorry
He took the harder route, regardless
He was a little smaller
To get respect he had to dog 'em
For the girls
He wanted to be the hero or anti-hero
One dude was a nerd
Got picked on and went berserk
They both teamed-up
Found a common and that was robbing
Drinking liquor
At the age to feel no pain
We robbing brainless
Deep for the cheddar
A pain I can't explain
To see that window shatter
My blood's like a stain
Tainted evidence, the pain
Hard with the police
Gather the evidence
You ain't a robber, you ain't gon' feel this shit
Maybe I ain't mainstream
I cry cause I want the world
I'm scared that these niggas would celebrate my death
I guess... The world is deep, novo
Fuck you bitch
I'm thugged out, I love this shit
So educated I can go out and discuss this shit
Bringing back matters to the public
I like, I love it

[Outro - Lil B]
This is the life of a robber
Illusions of Grandeur
The most prolific mixtape to ever come out in hip-hop
Let this change your life how it changed mine
Lil B
The Based God
