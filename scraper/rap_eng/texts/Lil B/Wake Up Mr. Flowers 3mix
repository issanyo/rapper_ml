[Intro]
Basedworld, what's up?
Yeah, like I said
Clear my throat, cause I'm so sick

[Verse]
Now, a nigga mad, cause probation wanna hit me, man
They locked me up, say I'm a danger to the city, fuck that
I get paid, I'ma do what I gotta
Most niggas keep it fake, but I'm a show dropper
I ain't playing, bullets coming faster than a train at your body
Feel me? Froze like a old nigga
Man, I got played, set up, and I owed niggas
Now I'm getting fed up, saying that I own niggas, man
You seen on the block, speak up for no nigga, man
You a stripper, no respect, you a gold digger
Other than that, pussy, groupie, ho's, I told niggas
Following a buster, like your rhymes, I show niggas
Water run deep, man, hot, I fold niggas
Wake up in the morning, cook the coke to broke niggas
Never was jacked, or robbed, the dope dealer
Fiends, by your house looking for the coke wheeler, man
Used to sell, in the [ ], like [ ], feel me?
Bro told me to cook up them onions, man
Propped on the block, so, I grew bunions, man
Used to be out, late night, moving functions
Sit back up in the car, with my gun loaded
Used to see shit, man, taught me to be a soldier
Niggas took up on the football, man, always ran them over, man
Ain't never lied, man, my raps like a diary
Sometimes, I be crying
People grew up man, that shit be...
Lying, and I want to lay into lot of niggas
So right man, took my right hand, and put a knife
This for protection, man, viewer discretion
Niggas ran up on me, so I'm saving my blessings
Trying to come back, man, I gotta count my shit
Feel me? Can't be dead, man, happier than a bitch
Niggas switch up, man, I been since
Took them boys out the laws, you got no chess
Feel me? Hold that trap, man
You better roll up before I'm back
Cause niggas sending off shots, man, that'll knock you all back
Playing the game, man, I don't sell that
Fuck a [ ], feel me?
Nigga's got the game, I write it like it's cocaine

[Outro]
Yeah man, we going straight out the store
I think I'm about to go in, buy some juice real fast
What you want from the store bro?
What you need?
Yeah we gotta...
Yeah man, just like, get some Swishers and uh, some juice
Should get like a bottle of water or something, and uh...
You know, this some cool shit
I'm about to listen to this God's Father mixtape
We fuck with Lil B, heavy
