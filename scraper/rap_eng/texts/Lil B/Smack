(Intro)
These streets a cold game. 05 fuck 'em, man I ain't gon' lie, motherfuckas done got real cold out here this season man, 2014 it seem like everything all bad

(Hook)
Niggas get smacked with the Glock
And I won't fucking stop
I said
Niggas getting smacked with that Glock!
And I won't fucking stop
I said
Niggas getting smacked with that Glock
And I won't fucking stop
I said
Niggas getting smacked with that Glock
And I won't fucking stop

(Verse 1)
All I know is hard struggle, off the muscle, talking Shit
Working jobs, no family, Niggas thought I burnt the bitch
I damn near killed a nigga, Around the year 2010
Niggas be playing cause I'm skinny and I'm a short nigga
I'll murder you in court nigga, I love being a dark nigga
Goth nigga I be hitting licks, solo, by myself
No guns, no masks, all pain, red eyes
Dead stares with the snake eyes, stop fucking with them fake guys
Yeah nigga, no smile, you niggas ain't fucking thugs nigga
Taking pictures like a fucking faggot, death to all you closet rappers
Hit you with that K faster, you be hating on Lil B?
You probably are a fucking faggot, death to all you closet rappers
Niggas out here helping me? Real nigga, I gotta deal with it
Facin' 30 I did that, keep it real I ain't no jail nigga
I'm two star whippin' cocaine
All white like mescaline is
Pussy niggas get the business, none of my cars is fucking rented
Young nigga flexing Reggie Miller, young nigga flexing Ty Lawson
Niggas die and nobody care, Imma flex cause I'm so gorgeous
Knowing Lil B ain't easy, but I keep my head up
Death to all you fuckboys, Imma keep stacking my bread up

(Outro)
05 fuck 'em, mixtape, I ain't tryna go hard on niggas but, its Lil B man I do me, I love the world though, I said I love you but fuck these suckas
