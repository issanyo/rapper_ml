[Intro]
This is the bible
Been through so much in my life
Everything I say now is in red
All my scriptures
Lil B for "Lil Boss"
I've been runnin' the game for a long ass time man
Underground, top ground
You know what I mean, my grounds
Lil nigga let the sound out, bitch

[Verse 1]
I came in the game, I was young as hell
Hard headed, so you know I was dumb as well
Real nigga in this bitch, so it's like I'm fuckin'
Girl ask me if I love her, only rap that I'm lovin'
No chick get my heart, only moms that I'm huggin'
Auntie and grandma, and I love my cousin
Niggas act like they got me, but they ain't got shit
If I die, then they know they tryna fuck my bitch
Only a few legends finna see my funeral casket
If I die, burn my soul with the funeral ashes
The bible is rap, and the verses the scriptures
When I rap, I spit red, that's the virgin temple
Man, I pray everyday, that's a lie in itself
But I thank god for me, not money and wealth
Man, the real nomads ask for family and health
Last time I seen pain is when I looked at myself
Man, the shit was so deep I was flooded with water
Playing with the death trap in the form of a daughter
Want a full-court game, but I gave him a quarter
As I turn the front page as I'm reading the bible
Lil B in the form and his presence is idol
You can think I'm talking mess, but the message is vital
If you wanna save the earth, you should go and recycle
Young nigga from the block, and I handle the business
Turn it to the next page as lord is my witness
If he do this crime, then I'm smoking the witness
If you try to run from me, not helping my fitness
And I know I'm with the shit, cause my grind is relentless
No it's never been a match, so I could be tennis
And it's money over bitches, so it couldn't be women
Niggas don't understand that my mind is blasted
And my bible gon' close but my heart is active
Yeah, and my mind is blasted
And the bible gon' close, but my heart is active

[Bridge]
Real shit man, real shit in the game
Real shit I can't explain
The bible is so crazy
Scriptures with pain
Everything in my life is in red now
The scriptures I paint are in red now

[Verse 2]
The day lead to win and the vision is in
You ain't seen BasedGod, cause the vision in him
Based thoughts from the pen as I'm touching my zen
As I'm feeling like the mist, mix me in with the bliss
Cats have nine lives, so I'm living for hits
As I swim in the ocean, god gave me a kiss
So I'm writing from the journal, based flow nocturnal
But I live in daylight, solar will burn you
Hola to ese, I'm the one who's colonel
Triple six on my dick, I'm the devil eternal
Represent the sunflower, cause it means I'm growin'
Grew up in the soil, so my roots is golden
Plant life based is when you don't eat no meat
I'm plant based with the rap, you don't want no beef, nigga
Yeah, and I could talk those streets
Cause I never left the block, I could walk those streets
Most dudes like to talk that heat, but find out in the rain
They don't taste that sweet, it's the bible
I'm plant based with the rap, you don't want no beef
Yeah, it's the bible

[Outro]
Very vital to the new people
Around the world we never stop
Lil B for Lil Boss
All I can do is stay based
More based than ever
Put my hand to the sky
Ten fingers to the sky in a prayer
Watch, then read the based bible
I'm taking over
My new book is coming out, Taking Over
Make sure you cop that
The first installment to my legacies
Cop all my music
Every mixtape
I'm Thraxx
Based Blunts, Based Freestyles mixtape
Lil B for Lil Boss
Bible
