[Intro: Lil B]
Aye Soulja I see you
Remix
Based God, Soulja

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Ridin' in that 'rari tryna make it work
Bad bitch with me and I make 'em squirt
Catch me in the trap tryna make it work
Catch me on the pot tryna make it work
Whippin' up work with my other hand
Fuck niggas hatin' on me cause I got them bands
Yeah you know I'm tryna make it work
Standing on the block tryna make it work
Packs touch down and they gone
King S Beezy on his fucking throne
Ridin' in that Panamera or the coupe
Double cup of that Styrofoam I'm sipping juice
2 chains, money out the roof
In a blue Phantom and I'm might salute
Ridin' to the club in a Mase' coupe
Everybody know I got a 'rari' roof

[Hook : Soulja Boy]
Standing on the block tryna make it work
Bad bitch with me and I make 'em squirt
In the trap tryna make it work
Standing on the block tryna make it work
In the trap tryna make it work
Bad bitch ridin' with me and I make 'em squirt
On the block tryna make it work
In the trap tryna make it work

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I'm still in the trap whipping up the work
I got 10 bitches wear a mini skirt
I love young bitches and they love me back
I hate my fucking plug I robbed him for the pack
I buy a lil' pussy just to flex
Drive a Maybach and still buying pussy
I still buy pussy on tour
Lennox flex boat cool fucking ho
I love young bitches nigga that's my flaw
In my life a couple times I broke the law
Child support ? Me I broke the bitch jaw
Twelve years a slave, I'm fucking bitches raw

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
