[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
My haters gettin mad, bitch, they bout to get more mad
They see my chain, and screem the initials of World Of Warcraft
My worst man, will kill your best man on his worst day
Kill him in the worst way, and quench him if he thirsty
Chicago, that's my birth place, but I'm an ATL resident
And one day, if it'd be possible, I may be the president
They elect me out the game, cause SOD, we off the chain
Just like a Pitbul runnin on Stairoids, in the middle of the ring
Bang bang, these diamonds on me lookin like Arangatang
Soulja the flame, man, hit m with the gang, man
5 on me, main chain
Niggas tryna get it with the red thing
Red dots on his nose, havin him lookin like Rudolph
5 with the roof off, Soulja Boy Tell M, I'm the truth, dog
Fuck ya'll niggas wanna do, dog

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I get dollas, I get dollas
I get dollas, yeah
I get dollas, I get dollas
I get dollas, yeah

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I'm gettin more money now, I'm on another level now
I think a lot of niggas be sleepin a nigga, but found out that a nigga really is a beast
I'm fine, nigga, you can't really flow
They find out a nigga really never been a hoe
They found out that a nigga that they been givin about 200,000 dollars for a motherfuckin show
They find out that my pinky ring straight glowin, when I hit the club, bitches already knowin
SOD gang, chains I'm showin
Me and my niggas we hot, you sell it
Me and my niggas got it hot, pop pop
Bought guns from the shop, sold them for a thousand
Me and my niggas be gettin this money, and ain't shit funny, we ain't a dummy
You Must not know, fuck you seein
You and your niggas seein just like Stevie
Me and my niggas, we somethin like the type make that real shit, big shit
RIP to your arguments, rappers thinkin you could fuck with me
It's not going to happen, hit m with the Ratchit, make shit splatter

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I get dollas, I get dollas
I get dollas, yeah
I get dollas, I get dollas
I get dollas, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil B]
I got bitches, I got money
Hittin switches, get that money
Smoke that blunt up, fuck them bitches
It's Bassed God, bitch, ridin 6 inch
Fuckin bitches, shout to Beezy
That's Yeezy, Soulja, Lamborghini
30,000, hundred million
All my niggas dope, so crazy in this fuckin building
It's SOD, Bassed God, Lil B
Hundred mill, survin strippers, waterfront
Goddamb, bitches mad
Mad at them hoes, in the back
Got them bitches, in the room, goddamb, no lie

We came back, me and all my niggas, with them racks
Rock that shit, that's a doorag
Niggas come back, we did that
