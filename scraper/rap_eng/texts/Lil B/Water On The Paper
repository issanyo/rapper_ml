[Intro]

Fuck it, nam sayin'?
Everybody know, I'm goin' fuckin' crazy, you feel me?
Yo shout out to the hustler, mane
Bay Area, stand up, R.I.P. to Jackal

[Verse 1]

Every time I come around
You saying you gon' talk down (What you gon' do bitch?)
You say you gon' pound me out
I'm sending this message to everybody in the world
Go kick rocks and get knocked out (bitch, bitch)
I still co-cadas, on this day
You feel me?
If this money equal problems, I want a lot of problems, bitch

[Hook]

Gang bang for the team
Or you gon' ride for the green
Bitch it's water for the paper (water for the paper)
Yeah, I said it's water for the paper (Westside)
You gon' gang bang for the team
Or do you go ride for the green?
It's water for the paper (paper)
It's water for the paper

[Verse 2]

Yeah, P's and Q's, P's and Q's
You feel me? (Yeah)
On the morning news (news)
We make rounds come to the underground (underground)
Bitch, you know I'm gon' lay 'em down
Take a couple chances, we all roll the dice (dice)
End up really nice you could lose your life
Lost perspectives on the big, mystery
Changing from going in to seeing me
Peaceful soon no force when I coming in (comin' in)
I know everything about the game, don't forget
Forgive them, you gotta (yessssss) forgive
Cause we gotta live
Count all your blessings, it's how you get close to the fame
You living for a chain, might as well be a slave
You playing a game, dummy

[Hook]

You go gang bang for the green
Or you gon' ride for the team
It's money with the paper
I said it's water for the paper
Gon' gang bang for the team
Or you gon' ride for the green
It's money for the paper (paper)
Yeah

[Verse 3]

Uh, bitch I'm tryna' make a bond I'm tryna' get straight (bond)
Fuck with liquid stocks
Plague investments
Made it through the war zone
With them cocaine investments (cocaine)
Streets tax me, I'm checked in
If you got a drought, bitch, I'm wetter than (wetter than)
Bitch, what you know about it? Who the (about it) hardest now? Let me tell you about it
I got a lot of stripes but it's no need for talkin'
And I get paid for it, bitch, it's easy walkin' (walkin')
Got a down girl, hold her close
Cause not many people wanna hold that toast
On your behalf they might as well be a wheel
Because when you know how they go they just keep spinnin' (spinnin')
Ain't no appeal, they just keep livin'
They like a fuckin' wheel because they just keep spinnin' (spinnin')
You talk a lot of shit, but no care
Nigga my eyes on the money, my shoes upstairs
Tighten up you hustle, it's always better
You feel that giving up you gotta be better
Stop trying, don't stop
Loud mouth niggas, we on the top
I'm online, Lil B for the world (world)
I do this for the boys and girls
Lil B

[Hook]

Bang for the team
Or you gonna ride for the green
It's water on the paper
It's water for the paper
Gon' gang bang for the team
Or you gonna ride for the green
It's money for the paper
It's water on the paper

[Outro]

It's ya boy Lil B, you feel me?
