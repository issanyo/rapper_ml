[Hook: Messy Marv]
You niggas looking for me?
Bitch I'm over the stove
Trying to stick my dick in one of these hoes
18 for a [?] nigga I talk [?]
What you motherfuckers doing?
I done [?] already
Swag, swag, swag
You fucking with a [?]
I can eye out weight, nigga I don't need a scale
Swag, swag
[?]
Having money nigga, I can talk bad to a bitch

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Niggas posted in the hood, Marv on the stove
Bitches hit the cooking dance for the pot of gold
Bitches on my dick, I look like the dope man
Pretty boys, Messy Marv, yeah he's the coke man
I ain't a dope seller but I'm an ex-robber
Pretty face and my big nigga got the chopper
Messy Marv, he a god in the streets
Lil B, Based Lord, swag hard to the beats
And I talk smart game to these young bitches
Rich nigga and I'm on like [?]
Hit up the city, know I gotta cross the bridge
18 on my dick, you know what it is

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andy Milonakis]
Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man
Cooking crack as fast as I can
Making rock while I listen to Pac
Got three Korean hoes and they're licking my cock
Chef (swag), bowl (swag), cut, knife
Got bitches on my dick, trick fuck your life
Lil B, me, and Messy, we a cold ass trio
Slanging rock to a honky in a old ass Geo
Metro, I get [?] from the get-go
People show me love from Hollywood to the ghetto
Real ass boy, don't need no [?]
And I play with bricks, stack 'em up like Legos
