[Intro]
Yeah
Roll them dice, you feel me?
Stay rolling dice, you feel me?
Stay taking chances
Thugged out pissed off
If you with this shit, you feel me?
S'mores

[Chorus] (x2)
I'ma play the hood, bitch, I'ma play the hood (x3)
Rolling white dice, bitch tell me what's good

[Verse 1]
I'ma work the hood cause the hood worked me
I'ma sell Jerry, ain't nothing for free
I'ma count pennies and I'ma keep receipts
Flashing on and flashing on
I'ma sell college cause they sold that to me
The hood my girlfriend, bitch I'ma fuck the street
I'ma fuck the stove and sell it on the street
I'ma a jealous guy so I beat up my bitches
I'm so insecure, I don't even trust me
I'ma keep it real, I left my feelings on the street
Can't be Hollywood cause I feel too street
Fuck a rich bitch, all these broke hoes for me

[Bridge]
Know what I'm saying
Yeah man
I play the street everyday
We could play that
Know what I'm saying
Play every game that you got
Play all the cards you was dealt and get to it
Like I said
If you ain't getting to it you don't know what you're doing
Every day on my grind, hustling until we got a situation
Everything, taking chances

[Chorus]
