[Lil B]
Its your boy Lil B
If you ain't never listened

[Verse : Lil B]
Based boy soldier niggas is pushin boulders
Aiming at your head never settle for less
And my niggas we the best always settle for best
The battles been over scars blatantly showin'
I ain't never gave up no time to be a quitter
Niggas wanna add not even knowin' division
And my vision is clear now, niggas is beanie pimpin
Feel like I drunk water, from the holy water
Now Im giving my position add two
Makin shots for the team and if a nigga try to try
I reign supreme, the rain over niggas got beef like Taco meat
And they still ain't even eatin the funk
I guess they let the noise go
Better be in your trunk
My finance has been cool but its easy to stunt
And I ain't never been a chump givin need for the funk
Niggas been high tec you's a squeeze of the pump
You snitch ass niggas do dirt alone
Phone tamps so I dont traffic
Over phones
Cause when the red light stops you're gone
Been blowin purple weed so nigga Im blown
Plus a chick at the house so nigga Im blown
Plus the bloods gave me shit gave me ??? reactions
Me and jail don't mix its negative reactions
??? play the role because I know you been actin'
And Salone ain't the only nigga ready for action
GI Joe guns pump six remove they back and
Make you see losin blood let you need this napkin
Where I come from nigga we exed out distractions
Now today, no cable access
The droves been stooded, ugh
Under the mattress
Look at the peephole, look at life man
My life is too real would you blast on sight
And take another mans life fightin for his rights?
To be the next man free workin' all his life?
I pray to God I couldn't go some sleeps at night
Dead broke man I have to hit the streets some nights
Man I couldn't drive a car plus the wheels on bikes
Then I started stealin' cars pushin wheels on sight
But I'll never go back cause I love this mic
Better yet man I love this life

[Outro]
Real shit from a real nigga
