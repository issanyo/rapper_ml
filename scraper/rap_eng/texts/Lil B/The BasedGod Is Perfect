[Intro]
They call me Lil B man. I made history I'm still making history, walking history. Yeah just take a look at me real fast, you feel me? Take a look at Lil B take a look at somebody the knows the BasedGod I know the BasedGod personally, you feel me? Lets go

[Verse 1]
Most niggas hate cause they used to getting paper
Told the niggas I ain't leaving here to stay girl
Believe it I dreamed it in night for your comfort
Company when I need something I can hug on
Believe I love you and nobody knows that
All my hundreds is somewhere in Stockton
Believe me baby we more than a option
I ain't gotta hustle hard just to see when you clockin'
Because you love me I can tell how we divided
Because the light shining we make a fire
I ain't made faces slapped a face on them dollars
Presidents man they couldn't be copied
A lot of people try to cheat when you focused without it
A lot of niggas scared of money try to get dough about it
I'm tryna get it a couple rings and some houses
Paying rent when it's due, buying grapes by the ounces

[Interlude]
I want you to be my girl
I want you to pay me baby, you know what I'm saying?
Lets get money ho, lets get money ho
I want you to pay me baby, I want you to pay me
Lets get money ho, Let's get money ho

[Verse 2]
How you gonna hate me when she really want to date me
She know I won't date her so she hate me
Money got me feeling like a safety
Made rules on the field still safety
Still counting money for the days I was aching
Get my money I donate it to the world, people just take it
I don't deserve it, disconnected from all the pain
Wanna fly away with my bitch jump into a pull full of diamonds
Niggas don't understand it
I don't understand the world you supposed to be you
Lucky if you get out them.. debts too
Girls paying off my bills cause I'm tired
Niggas keep it focused roam the streets in a wire
Tryna piece up my paradise bitches sucking dick
I'm getting money Lil b know that for sure
Still baggin' up a ho
I'm baggin' up all that dough
It's Lil b

[Outro]
I need you baby, I need the money, I need bitches
