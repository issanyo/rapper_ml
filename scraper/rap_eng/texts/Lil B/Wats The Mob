[Intro]
Drip for the hood, you know what I'm saying?
Burn up for the hood, you know what I'm saying?
Motherfuckers be putting that shit in the microwave
Dipped it in the bowl, microwaved up the blunt, you know what I'm saying?
Burning that water
Also, you know what I'm saying, freeing up the soul for my brothers too, you know what I'm saying?
Get away from that bullshit, you know what I'm saying?
Waterfront, you know what I'm saying?
Real nigga, keep it wet all day
I know my position, you know what I'm saying?
I know my part

[Verse 1]
Man, it's Lil B and niggas biting off my old shit
Nigga that's my old shit, I'm fresh like the ocean
I'm still up underwater, the goggles on my left side
Bitch, it's the West side, yeah, that's the best side
Sit up in the best rides, drivers gon' drive me home
You pussy niggas like roly polys, pissed on holes
I'm froze, bitch my cake right, eat steak every night
I'm deep like Barry White
Girls wanna marry me, bitch you gotta pay the price
I'd rather fuck my jewelry than beat your pussy at night
Got fangs in my teeth, but I promise I don't bite
Yeah right, speak soft when the time right
Never been a sucker for dough, I'm finer than your nigga, bitch
Hate dealing with bitch niggas, suckers make a nigga sick
Maybe make a nigga split rounds like a fucking dick
Shh, you got a nigga pissed
But I'm scared and I ain't never piss

[Bridge]
I make you drip, drip, drip, drip, drip nigga
I make you drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
I make you, drip, drip, drip, drip, bitch
Yeah, I make you, drip, drip, drip, drip, bitch

[Verse 2]
You getting money, yeah, you fucking hoes, what?
You a boss, slap backs lil nigga, yeah
This is shit on the right note
They all love a nigga now, cleaner than embro
Slob up on the knob, bopper do your job
Like Young L said, I gotta improv
Bitch, where the scene? I'm dipped in butter
Bitch, I'm looking cream, lil nigga on his hustle
Riding with my niggas, hope you riding with the muscle
Bitches show up, I'm riding with a muzzle
Smoking on that Russell, Berkeley boys get it in
You stupid if you don't know that we wit' it
Bitch, we winning, riding on doubles
Lil nigga's getting money cause a nigga won't fumble
Bet I won't drop it, bitch I'm rocking in a puddle
You niggas like puppies with them little nut huggers
Asking no questions, and I'm thinking nothing of it
I'm a real nigga, and naw, I'm not thuggin'
I'm just busting shit, I'll shoot you fuckers and your cousins
Playing games man? Um, nigga it's nothing
Got the gun from Deezle, all my niggas love me
Bitch, I'm Lil Beezy, Team Knoc, what it do?
Technicians get dough, and believe, fan boys what it do?
Crack street, what it is?
Hey, all you street niggas, man, we out here

[Outro]
Hey man, I'm out here like a sports camp, you know what I'm saying?
We rocking man. Hey, salute all my real niggas to the top
Basedworld Paradise man
I come from a different cloth, the classic shit
A lot of you niggas reppin' shit now, and I ain't understand it
Niggas done took everybody's shit, niggas done really fucked up the game, you know what I'm saying?
I'ma keep it 100. What is the mob, nigga?
Cause I see everybody claiming that
I know everybody can't be in it...
