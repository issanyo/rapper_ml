BasedGod, Based freestyle
You know what I'm sayin' this for anybody
You broke my heart
My heart was broken before
Anybody that had their heart broken
Yeah, yeah, bitch
You fuckin' broke my heart, you bitch

You broke my heart
Based freestyle
You broke my heart
Yeah
You did, bitch
I thought that you loved me
I thought you did
Yeah

Yeah, you

I took you out, you took me out
I took you out, you took me out
It's fuckin' Lil B
And I kissed your lips
I hate it
But you didn't kiss back
I cried at night
Yes
Baby why'd you leave me?
Why did you leave?
Why'd you leave me?

Why'd you leave me?
Based freestyle
Based freestyle, yeah
Why'd you leave, leave me?
BasedLord, don't deceive me
I'm BasedGod, where's my girlfriend?
I need a based queen until the world ends
I feel like the world's endin'
Man no endin', plus it's no beginnin'
And where's the winner? Because I'm not finished
I just need some dinner, please, a little fish
My girlfriend used to cook the best fish
She was the best bitch, now she's gone now
And I don't know why the fuck she's gone now
I hate her
