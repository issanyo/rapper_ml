Yeah cousin, that Bitchmob nigga serious

Bitchmob: Respect Da Bitch Vol. 1
Nigga, let's get it....

[Verse]
Bitchmob (swag) yeah, I'm so disrespectful
Hold a AK and my pants so tiny
Rep' where I'm from cause you niggas know I'm with it
Shouts out to Soulja Boy... I gets digits
Fishscale hunter... dopeman hunter...(BASEDGOD)
Shouts out to Brick Squad, bitch, I do numbers (BASEDGOD)
Twelve cell phones and I look like Kurt Angle
Nigga, I got swag and a bitch know I'm able
I make my music.. pretty boy music
Still strapped up and I still Lex Luger
Everybody ask how the robber is the shooter (DR. PHIL)
Boys know I'm gangsta, boys know I bruise ya'/
Everybody know that I caught them ten cases
Straight bitchmob man that shit is amazing (FELONIES)
Straight west-side you know them haters going dumb (DUMB)
Fifty on my dick cause I look like James Blunt (JAMES BLUNT)
Afrika Bambaata (FELONIES) hit em' with the chopper
With my new bitch and she cuts like a lobster/
No, I'm not a rocker but I might Slayer
Just bought the new Benz, no, it's nothing major
Boy, light it up. man, the kush in the air
Chimmy chang chang. bitch, I think I'm Robert Horry
Bitch, let me talk cause bitch, I think I'm Maury
Crack a ho head an I'll see you in the morning (BASEGOD)
