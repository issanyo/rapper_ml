[Intro]
Ain’t gotta say too much on this

[Verse 1]
Momma working all day, I’mma pray to God
If I don’t make it in the world, please protect my mom
The pressure on a teenage man, I can understand
I just turned twenty myself, the world be a cold place
Yeah, life is real, but ain’t nobody see a life you feel
When I write I feel some kind of way that relates to real
So I understand how you feel
I’m a loner too, I’m online just to watch the news
And when I upload, I appreciate the views
Cause you don't gotta watch me, you don’t gotta like me
So if you ride with me, shit, I’m riding for life.”
I never had nobody that cared
Except a few close people everybody was scared
Because I didn't know myself that particular time
That's why I’m always writing rhymes and speaking my mind

[Bridge]
I work every day, it's a common goal
To keep my head right and buy my moms a home
The hustle don’t stop, the hustle don’t stop
I work every day, it's a common goal
To keep my head right and buy my moms a home!
The hustle don’t stop, the hustle don’t stop

[Verse 2]
I failed so many times, I ain't learn the lesson
Hope I’m not an example, hope you really see my message
I do this for my fam and everybody that respect it
But time fly fast and I’m feeling resentment
I don’t think I'm at my best I’m moving fifty percent
Five percent, ten, the other thirty five in the pen
My right hand made it if I’m thinking I win
But where I grew up, either you sink or you swim
So it’s crabs in the bucket, know you heard that phrase
But everybody got a chance to shower, then praise
So I’m tryin' to change the old way of thinkin, peep it
Wrote a book 19, I hope that Jesus reads it
A lot of people thought I’m dumb like an underachievement
Cause my grades wasn’t good, and I was smoking that reefer
But my mom said son, if you keep believing
You can be anything, just keep on breathing!
And I try to stay clean, but drugs is pain
This is something in my brain since a early age
And I'll never fall off, but this is word to god
Ain't nothin' promised in this life, Imma beat the odds
My momma struggle everyday just to keep her job
And don't nobody understand what I go through daily
So if I'm lookin' kinda down, just salute the god
And root for me, cuz to really tell the truth, it's hard
I'm writin' rhymes every day, it's a gift from god
And if you listen to this rap, this is from my heart
Lil B for Lil Boss, I'mma beat the odds
And I'mma do the right thing, be the based-est god
I'mma beat the odds, Lil B
