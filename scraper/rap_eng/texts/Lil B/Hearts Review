[Intro]
Hello, hello, welcome
Hey, my friends, now
I guess Lil B has to tell you something
Before we end the day!

[Verse]
I'm a keep it real about my heart review
Gimme a five star rating, up in the car waiting
Uh, feel me, I got the patience
Don't make me push that button Iike call waiting
Waiting on the streets, how I handle
How I set examples, my heart burn strong
I still can't burn no candles, flashbacks
Corner blocks, cornered on the block
Pouring out liquor and shots, cause my nigga got shot
How the fuck I'm gonna take that shot?
Can't even stomach, nigga
Can't even smoke a blunt!
Trying to hide away the pain
I was smoking for months
To say the smoke used to be a thug
I want to hurt myself because the pain that I drug
Everybody forgives, man, my life mission's
To keep this shit going man, why the fuck I'm living?
It's history, man I stay with the vision
Keeping, pimping, setting examples
Humble, humble, humble
I'm so glad that I'm gifted
Keep this shit open for real
This shit is in my description!
Lil B, this my hearts review
I'm awkward, but how are you?
I'm awkward, but are you too?
Let's think about it, my hearts review!
