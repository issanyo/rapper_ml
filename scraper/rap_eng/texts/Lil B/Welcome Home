[Intro]
Captain! Captain! Welcome! Welcome to BasedWorld! We see you have a lot of new people with you. Now, I haven't seen you in a while, but I want to tell you that everything is okay and it'll be great. I know a couple of people that have bitches! Like I said, but this is all about Lil B today and we're gonna go and take a tour of this based place. You know, some call it BasedWorld. I'll be your host, Captain 66!

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Put her on my back, I'm Lex Luger
Diamonds and mac 10's, yeah it's a party
Nobody's coming except me and the shooter
It's a guard at the gate, I'm trying to meet the ruler

[Hook: Lil B]
Call me Lex Luger (x16)

[Verse 2]
I'm a monster too, I like monsters too
Mossberg, awkward, with the large WOOF!
With the large POOF, I'ma ???
I'm off with YOU, then I'm off the WOOP!
I'm the truth, I'm not a lie
You got a sword fight, I'm a master teacher
Comin' from the corner where the bastards teach you
Drugs on the corners, please bring the coroners
My whole lifetime, I was just seeing quarters
Never had a job, I was just seeing orders
Do you want to buy? I was just serving oh yeah
Smack you with the Glock, then I need you to relax
Trust me with the mack, I got love for The Pack
Niggas still at the bar, tracks with the mini macks
Time will tell, maybe that I'm lying
Time will free my niggas man, I swear to god I'm-

[Hook]
