[Intro]
Yeah, yes
I got alot of bitches, yeah!
Everybody knows I got alot of bitches
P.Y.T mixtape Lil B, feel me? I got alot of bitches
Everybody know!

[Verse 1]
You can tell I got alot of bitches
Would you be mad if I had 52 bitches?
I don't care, niggas know I got bitches on my dick
Middle finger to a hater, cause a ho ain't shit!
That's a figure of speech, I need adrenaline beat
About 15 girls with my name at least
About 51 girls would say, I'm the best
22 girls wanna put my name on their chest
Let me tell you about me when I ride in the streets
Went deep with a bitch in the back seat
Lil B, you're the fucking man
The world on my nuts, the bitch in my hand
You feel me? I go so hard
But not like this, you feel me?
Yeah man, I'm a tell you why rip shit, man
You feel me, I got bitches!

[Hook]
I'm the Basedgod
I will never cuff the bitch, cuff the bitch, cuff
I don't love the bitch, love the bitch
I will never lie, everybody know
I got alot of bitches!
I'm the Basedgod
I will never cuff the bitch, cuff the bitch, cuff
I don't
Love the bitch, love the bitch
I will never lie, everybody know, (know)
I got alot of bitches!

[Verse 2]
You can ask me about my left one
And you can ask me about my right one
But sometimes I say she's not the right one
And sometimes I think she is the right one
But sometimes it's really not the nice ones
And sometimes it really be those right ones
They be acting like the right one
But really, are you the right one?
I don't know! They be playing those games
I don't know! I won't be saying those games
I don't know! cause I don't be saying those names
I don't know! who be playing that game
So I just be thinking about all my bitches
And I be thinking about how many bitches I got
And I be saying, God damn, I'm the man
Lil B, you got bitches in your hand!
Ha Ha
