[Intro]
Hey I wanna say one thing
And I wanna make it clear
If you Latin I love you
If you Latino I love you
Man this ya boy Lil B man
Hey check me out

[Hook]
If I get caught I got insurance
I hit a nigga with that banger
If I get caught I got endurance
I'ma show that bitch who's gangsta
If I get jacked I got insurance
I'ma hit a nigga with that banger
If I get caught I got endurance
I'ma show that bitch who's gangsta

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I'ma show that bitch who's gangsta
I'ma roll with the MAC out
No license I'm alone with the strap out
It's wild west and we living in Texas
In Alabama, that's where they stretch it
I'ma post up with them dimes and quarters
Hood restaurants, all my coke is ordered
Sending off packs all across the border

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Still got pills, call me the pill man
It's my show, I'm the deal man
Niggas hate, far away
And when they up close
Man they wanna say the most
Gun in my pocket, that's the butter (with toast)
I'm an old school gangsta like the water with dope
Take me off the world man
Jacking these bitches
Understand I'm macking these bitches
And stacking these riches

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hey man
Hey shout out to my dude Rick Rubin
Shout out Rick Rubin man
Shout out Russell Simmons
You know what I'm saying?
It's ya boy Lil B nigga
