You can see the high rise, two guns on my side
Gotta stay strapped, any bitch wanna die
He can go switch sides; game don’t lie
You can see my face man, your eyes don’t fuckin lie
Bitch don’t act surprised, I’m coming with niggas
No soccer, you can’t even practice
Travel ‘cross the atlas, niggas battle me
Bitch you really rolling some practice
Eatin soft rice while I’m sittin in the mansion
Gotta talk deals, my bitches keep askin
Niggas like me, I’m smoking weed in the Hamptons
My bitches pay cash every time I play
It’s like the NBA, a hundred thousand for a game
Fuck what you think, I’m still ripplin in the water
Still in the water, still in the bottle
Steal from the bottle like the nigga Charles
Still from the bottle like H2O
Niggas know I killed the rap game after the crack game
It’s the golden era, before the street drugs let loose
Bitch I got the juice
This the real truth, you feel me?
Glassface, put the nines in the booth
Niggas like me, I put the line in the truth

You feel me? What that really do
You feel me? I’m just keepin that shit 100 percent on this nigga
You feel me? Glassface nigga
You feel me? Who rep this shit like me?
Who rep this shit like Lil B nigga? Rawest rapper alive
You’re right, you know
Shout out Nicki Minaj man
Shout out, ya feel me, yea I know
