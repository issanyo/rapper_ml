Why every nigga think he gotta come back
I come strapped...With the same gats from the Richmond trains
Niggas be coming from the hood but dont miss a thing
I'm coming from the pain like my bruh lil wayne
Imma tell you like this, niggas be dying for the fame, riding for the fame
I got my eye up on the game
Niggas seeing pass the bullshit but the night change
When the cops them came, your niggas fired at ya
You gon' retaliate or take it like a man?
You gotta stop the cycle its the personal plan
If you kill him...then he comin' for ya man
Ya best friend...circle of life becomes a square
Its unfair...when you ain't got that silver spoon
My neighborhood ain't safe...I was chillin' in the room
Til' I got my ass out and I see the days gloom
Daytime turned to noon...imma be home soon
There's a lot of blood and drugs in the streets
Mane I'm praying in my sleep just to stay close to me
Why do I feel like niggas switchin'?
I hold that chopper out the window like that Malcolm X picture
You niggas got me twisted...if you think this shits a game
Yall got me fucked...I play a dirty game
Love everybody...and no I won't complain
But when your talking licks bitch, don't speak my name
Because I'm the type of dude that'll bluise yo...
Sit yo ass on the...boy don't miss that train
I was dreaming of the top but...fuck it with the hassle
I hustle, tussle, and scrabble on the streets...
With lint in my pocket like a Pharaoh
Feeling like the scarecrow because the ____ walking past me
The dude in the hood asked me...why I'm so happy?
I told em'...I'm moving way past retaliation
I'm on another now I'm seeing life's faces
But I still load that (Shhh) up in them hearstes
And think before you move because most times it ain't worth it
