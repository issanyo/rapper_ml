[Intro]
Sitting here chillin'
Reminiscing on these...beautiful times in the past
While i'm sitting on this beach
They call it the old days

[Verse 1]
Man the old days, I would sleep on mattress
I would smell piss on the floor, two or three
Young bloods, no gang, this is not a game
That would get on your head, this is not Rogaine
Park the bike on the corner, treat it like it's a bus
Used to steal a few things, most likely it's us
Used to fall off my bike, it would bruise me and cut
Had a few real friends, but we lost contact
It would be a real team, like we had a contract
We would ride the bus late, sipping on cognac
I didn't need a backpack, cause I was never in school
Treat rules like windows, I was breaking the rules
Fifteen and sixteen, I was making the news
Feel good in the hood when they know you the dude
O.G.'s said, "man, this is the thing you would need"
Won't buy dope from a dealer who was cussing for free
Man, I had love for brothers that was watching for me
Wouldn't let me see the white when they was chopping the ki's
Wouldn't let me see the smoke when they was shooting with fiends
Man, I pray when I found god was handing me dreams
You would see in the sky, but they really on earth
Teen center, sports center, playing off in the dirt
Real niggas, fake niggas, even when we was young
If you was solid when you young, you as real as they come
Lil Boss
You feel me?
Real niggas, fake niggas, even when we was young
If you solid man, know you as real as they come
Lil Boss

[Bridge]
These my dreams
Shit, old school dreams
This my dreams
Old school dreams
This my dreams
Yeah, shit, old school dreams

[Outro]
You know, it's your boy Lil Boss, man
Still fucking with the old school one hundred percent, man
Sitting at this beach, recording on the beach, you feel me?
Word of advice man:
If you real when you young, you gon' remain real, when you grow
Check me
Real niggas, fake niggas, even when we was young
If you solid when you young, you as real as they come
Lil Boss
