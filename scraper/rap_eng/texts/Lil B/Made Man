[Hook]
I paid my dues, now I'm a made man (Made man!)
I call my fate, now I'm a made man (Made man!)
You never seen me again
I got the juice, now I'm a made man (Made man!)

[Verse 1]
Comin' up how I get it, feel like I couldn't breathe
Nigga without a scene, I be mad about everything
They be talkin' down and still wanna come around
My childhood, all I remember is angry times
But I had a good life, until I done stepped outside actually
Nigga, you gotta watch them family vibes
I been movin' solo, they don't understand how I'm movin' right
Late nights, take a night walk and you might see me down the street
Drive off in a Honda Civic, you niggas laughin', bitch
But I'm on a mission, real talk (Real talk, real talk!)
Nigga, I'm a made man (Made man!)
I got nothing to prove (Nothing to prove!)
I done paid my dues (Dues!)
I done tied up my shoes (Shoes!)
Nigga, I done laced up these fools (Fools!)
And I gained so much game
These niggas out here, millionaires or billionaires off my shit
The sound in the air, nigga, you can listen to the stare
I'm like you, Sneak, three times crazy for Berkeley
Nigga I'm from Richmond, nigga I'm from Berkeley

[Hook]
I paid my dues, now I'm a made man (Made man!)

I call my fate, now I'm a made man (Made man!)
(Hundred dollars for ten)
You never seen me again
I got the juice, now I'm a made man (Made man!)

[Verse 2]
My stomach hurt and my dick hurt
My last altercation had me shittin' funny
Can't move, my back hurt
Now I'm a made man, we dyin' out in San Francisco ('Cisco)
Finna be 2000, don't forget the limo
Doin' deals in Chinatown, I got so many ties I'm like a pretzel
In the hood, I'm like a gecko
Front page, and East Bay Express, I'm like Batman
I never show my face again (Face again)
Doin' shows, Quasimodo, stuck in the Disney Channel
Nigga, I can't wear no sandals
Nigga, shit ain't cool
I'm a pretty boy, and they jokes on my good looks and my motherfuckin' goodfellas
I'm Destiny's Child nigga, I'm Beyonc√©
I kept it real (Real)
That's all that I say (I say)
I see, everything I do is insane (Insane)
I'm a made man (Made man)
I'mma fuckin' cry (Fuckin' cry)
I'mma save the world (Save the world)
I'mma live my life (Live my life)
I'm a made man (Made man)

You never seen me again
(Loyalty is priceless)
I got the juice, now I'm a made man (Made man!)

[Outro]
Loyalty is priceless, you know (We ain't gon stop)
And truth and being yourself is priceless, bitch (We just started)
No money can pay, can't no money can make you real (You gotta be born real)
You're some of the fakest billionaires ever, you dig? (This shit gotta be)
And some of the realest with no money
And some of the fakest with no money
And some of the realest with a lot of money
Money can't make you, I'm a made man
You gotta be that, you dig?
Put your drinks in the air, light your weed up
Shouts to all the people and ladies (We lost a few blazers)
Put your drinks in the air, light your weed up if you dig
We ridin' out (Made man!)
Let's get it made, 100, Platinum Flame, Lil B
