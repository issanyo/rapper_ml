[Intro]
Shouts out to Ellen Degeneres, feel me?
Swag! Lil B

[Chorus]
Ellen Degeneres (swag!)
Ellen Degeneres (woo!)

[Verse 1]
I feel like Ellen
Right hand Ellen
Big blank rang
But I feel like Usher Raymond
Put me on the couches
Interview my girlfriend
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Brang-dang-dang your girlfriend
Girlfriend look like Ellen
Chain like Degeneres
"Damn Lil B, you done came up!
Now you touring heavy and your show costs 30 Gs
Damn BasedGod, you doing everything"
And I still swag harder
Iced-out ring real big like a charger
Yeah, he tight, but I'm swagging harder
See me on the Internet, 10 million Youtube
950 MySpace, 10 million MySpace
Young BasedGod met a girl off of MySpace
Now I'm on TV like Ellen Degeneres
"30 thousand for his show: oh he's so generous!"

[Chorus]
Ellen Degeneres (swag!)
Ellen Degeneres (woo!)

[Verse 2]
See me on set at 10 o'clock
Practicing my lines, swag to the tenth
Backstage pass, VIP pass
Iced out ring, Iced out chain
Ellen Degeneres, you're so generous
Everybody shows up, everybody loves you
30 thousand Showtime, 20 thousand maybe
Ellen Degeneres: mamis go crazy
Name's Lil B but the girls call me Swayze
See me at the show, hair cut like a baby
Ask a hundred girls if they know what my name is
Lil B BasedGod, Ellen's so famous

[Chorus]
Ellen Degeneres (swag!)
Ellen Degeneres (woo!)
