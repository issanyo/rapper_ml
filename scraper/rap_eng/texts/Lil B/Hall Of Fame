[Intro]
I just wanna be a part of the hall of fame too
I want my jersey to hang up too

[Hook](x2)
R.I.P. all the players that died in the game
Your jersey in the hall of fame
Nobody can forget your name

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. all my homies, throw up the jersey
Going in the gym late night, man, my chest hurtin'
This shit real when you can't play with me
Born here, you died in the same city
The world waiting for you, don't slow up
Niggas hit the league, bitch, I'm trying to go nuts
Don't stop, and don't give up on your dreams
Seen a wise man say, "you die
When you stop believing", I'ma see that black hole
Giving high fives to fans, high in the stands
You feel me? Doors is playing
You feel me? Waiting to get drafted
You hear that? Shit, it's the NBA salute
There's a lot of niggas hungry, and they can't wait to shoot
It's the fucking truth, I swear I'm the rawest rapper
Never lay away, I throw it in the basket
You feel me? (You niggas ain't catch that one)
R.I.P. all my niggas in the hall of fame
Know what I'm saying?
Shout out Big Sean, nigga

[Hook](x2)
R.I.P. all the players that died in the game
Your jersey in the hall of fame
Nobody can forget your name

[Verse 2]
You see me mugging, my team don't like you
See me on the court, I'll spike you
Only time you get block: when you on the court, bitch
You gon' dunk on me? No...
My scouting report, the only thing
That them niggas is seeing
Support my team, I'm loyal to the team
We win as a team, we lose as a team
We grow as a squad, long nights in the dark
Where do I start? You feel me?
We gon' step it up, and I'ma play my part
Everybody wanna be somebody in the dark
Or the light, but look at me in the mirror
Somebody, squint your eyes, it's not a surprise
It's the color of the rim, the color of my eyes
Represents the goals on my mind
Listen to the coach all the motherfucking time
But I make plays, and I push that line
This my team, bitch, I'm doing just fine
Hoop Life, R.I.P. all the homies
