[Spoken Intro:]
I deadass love Lil B the Based God, he speaking nothing but facts all day, fam
Oh, that car cost half a million dollars and it has the most luxury of materials? Get it away from me... I want every human to be able to live in a mansion and drive... if not. I'd rather find half a million humans to help and hug. I'll take my love business somewhere else
RT, like or repost this if you no longer want to lie and do better then other humans. Who wants to drive Lil B to the Grammy's in a very old Nissan or Oldsmobile? We no longer want the most expensive
Items if every human canâ€™t have it.. You now look like a divider to us
Divider, divider

[Chorus:]
Don't make me cry, don't make me cry
Don't make me cry, help those humans
Uh-oh, uh-oh, don't turn your cheek
And act like you don't see 'em
Oh, we are the world
Lil B-ing real as fuck
Right now, oh, oh, nah, no, no, no, no...

[Verse:]
I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you, ooh, nah, no, no, no, no...
Sending so many hugs, Lil B
So many (hey!)

[Chorus:]
Don't make me cry, don't make me cry
Don't make me cry, help those humans
Uh-oh, uh-oh, don't turn your cheek
And act like you don't see 'em
Oh, we are the world
Lil B-ing real as fuck
Right now, oh, oh, nah

[Spoken Outro:]
Oh, nah, Based God, spitting the shit that is truth
No
