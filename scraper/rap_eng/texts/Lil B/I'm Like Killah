[Intro]
(BasedGod!)
It's that Gold House, it's that real shit mane
Oh my God I'm back
(Gold House, Gold House bitch!)
We do everything, it's your boy Lil B

[Verse 1]
You can't fuck with me, damn I move swiftly
Million dollar shit cause the kid tote fifty
Back in the gold house, riding with the dope out
They don't play this on the radio, I got some things on my mind
For the fucking record, I'm a fucking legend
Million off top bitch you gotta fucking respect it
Fuck fuckin rhyming I'mma spit that gangsta shit
This is how I live, fuck how you feel
I got the b on the grill
Ten up to God
Man I swear to God I send you bitches up to God
Don't fuck with me and I don't gotta fuck with you
No I'm not a fuckin lick
Extra clips like a flick
Ten toes down cause I'm twenty hands deep
Boy it's real on the field I got player of the week
And fuck you lame niggas cause your boy real clique
I don't gotta call the goons cause you know I'm down for cheap
Based God

[Hook] x2
Killah, killah, I'm the fuckin thriller
Everybody know that I'm a fuckin killah
Killah, killah, I'm the fuckin thriller
Everybody know that your boy is a killah

[Verse 2]
It's that grown man shit
The chop make his head split
And you don't want to play games
Still up on that gat shit
And when you close your eyes that 45 on your man shit
That boy think he cool the red beam make him dancing
Keep it real humble, got the nine for your fam shit
They know you plotting on me but I'm still up in that trap shit
You know I got gunners in the back, and they nasty
I don't ever make no calls I just appear like magic
Pay fifty thousand so the ho suck my dick
Bitch I finance the head I pay three hundred a week
Bitch you know what it is bitch, it's Frank Sinatra
30 on my dick and I won't endorse the chopper
The people made me, my momma raised me
The streets pay me, I'm a fucking G
I'mma tell you like this, fuck around with me
Dick up in that ass bitch, don't touch my seats

[Hook] x2
Killah, killah, I'm the fuckin thriller
Everybody know that I'm a fuckin killah
Killah, killah, I'm the fuckin thriller
Everybody know that your boy is a killah
