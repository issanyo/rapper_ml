[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Yeah see, Brandon, fool, I told you, we gotta go over some hard beats, this time

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Nate, Nate, Nate Fox
We 'bout to get fucked, fucked up
They said fuck us, for real?
We don't play that shit, for real
Been in the same place
For way too long
Been in the same state
I can't do that shit
I get used to it
Then I think it's some usual shit
Usually I'm too, too lit
Problems meet you in tune to it
I get fucked up and I intend to be
Sending me, off
Where am I meant to be?
Historical problems, I think I know that
I can not go back
Simba is stuck in a jungle tonight and I want to be
Regular as a one, two, three
And the 3/4th time sig
Don't talk about my cig
Or my sit-uation
Don't talk about, I'm lit
Don't talk about, shit that I did like last week
You suck
I don't got a problem
I tried to solve them
'Til I realized, that's me, me, me, me
Four walls, that's me, me, me, me
Everything's so theatrical
So magical
Super fantastical
Super fragital
I mean, fragile
I'm agile
I'm agile, know I keep going on, on it
It's just us, just trust
It must, get better
Than it used to be
One, two, three
Click, click, I'm back at the crib
Back on my shit, back on my shit
I saved the city with two fans and fists
No more, unjist, or unjust situations
What happened to my bros?
What happened to my bros?
You know that we grow up
A growth spurt from the toes
To the tip of the head
I got some longer legs
I been growing, my stride just get stronger
And when I walk into this shit
It's like God is my...on the side of my ear
And I watch him talk into this shit
I can't get into this shit
But understand that I'm blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
God just say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Tell me what I need to
Me too, I got people I need to feed too
You feel me, I'm on my own

[Transition: Chance The Rapper (Lil B)]
Feed too (own, own, own, own, hey, own, own)

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got people to feed too
Some people to lead through
How could I not see you?
I just gotta see it through
Like I'm the jacker
But I'm just backed up
With a lot of filled up space
I got no space on my hard drive
Sometimes my life flies
Sometimes I can't see at night
I just wanna see inside
I just wanna float away
I just wanna fly away
My name's Lil B
But what if I die today?
Would they remember me?
Would I be history?
Would I be everything?
And Everything that I wanted to see
And wanted to be
And wanted to throw out the window
The window, I live for, I see through
I see you, can't see those
I don't feel them
And no, I don't hear them
I can't smell them
And I'd rather not be around them because they're jealous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, they're jealous
Jealous, Based freestyle
Based freestyle, and the melon
My melon, my melanin is melling
I'm like a melon
I'm like a watermelon
Because I just spit out the seeds
But sometimes they can not see me
So I gotta roll, gotta go
To the top of the space, and I gotta float
I gotta row like I'm on a rowboat
Going through the mountain, top of those
And I'm going through the water
And sometimes I'm going farther
And sometimes I'm doing short strokes
But I'm still on this boat
And bitch, where's my life vest?
I'm so stressed
And where's the top thing that I can breathe through
To resusc-itate-t-t-tate me
T-t-take me, I want to be free, fr-fr-free me
But with you Lil B, I am the history
I-i-i-i s-s-s-stutter
Because I'm s-s-s-scared of me
This is all August, all this, all of that, and
Shouts out to Chance the Rapping...he really raps that, raps that
Let's wrap it up, we gonna keep rapping up
It's your boy Lil B, I don't rap enough
Beautiful music, lifetime music,  epic proportions
Epic music, sometimes you can just see it and you feel it
Understand it, living life
Doing what's right
Every day, every night
Chance The Rapper what's up man?
Let's go
Uh, uh, cause I'm looking at the window
Outside view, I can see them
But I can't see through
But I gotta see it through, like the jacker said
Keep everything positive, it be in my head
All my chance, it's not on me it's in me
So, we don't want no frenemies
Just real friends, and a table of wines
Who we can sip away, and think about the shine
And the grace, the grace, the grace, the grace
The grace, the grace, the grace, the grace

[Outro: Collision (Amen's in background)]
(Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen)
As we come today, on this beautiful day
It's great to see people come together
Collectively and create a beautiful project
All from honesty
Going back and digging up in the archives
To appreciate history
This is real knowledge
Understand,  keep living
