[Hook]
It's been a mystery and still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street, the taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

[Verse 1]
Based freestyle them thoughts run my mind
Why a nigga frozen, my heart sick
Back fail in the puddle nigga stepped on that
How you gonna perform that?
How a nigga could perform rap?
When your heart hurts more
I'm struggling, heart hurt more
My niggas eat me, 3 times a day
But not eating where they're supposed to
Bombs like boom
They dissolve in the way, how you gon' think
The ball today the balls on my court
How I'm gonna rock out same way I rock out
Like Allen Iverson rock out
And I stay with the rocks out
Open the tongue bitch this is my house
Open the tongue bitch this is Run's house
I run 'em out bitch

[Hook]
It's been a mystery and still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street, the taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

[Verse 2]
Why you think about the boys shit the motherfuckers don't play
I don't play neither lately cause I'm cool that I won't dream reap you
You think because I'm nice that I might not sleep you
Spit the thing 20 times had their body bleaching
Like an old paper, you bleeded
Like an old paper, you beeped
You can't see me , they call me busy
In the night time they call me freezy
Sometimes they call me greedy
But I don't care because the motherfucker wanted that
I want rap I want that, and nah I can't give it back
Who run rap answer , the warrest rapper
Lie the niggers on top but I watch the bastards
Lil B for Lil Boss
It's my court
I'm still frozen, I stay frozen
Yes...
Based Freestyle
