(Intro: Lil B)
This my diary before the diary, 05 fuck 'em, It's Lil B, this my diary before the diary, This my diary before the diary, you know what I'm saying

(Verse: Lil B)
I ain't wait last night
And my stomach is hurting
And the game is so funny
The same shoes
Let me talk to you
This is worst, man, I must admit
Let me say, man
I need a spoon or a plate
To fill myself, man
I realised man, this shit was in my veins
Brought mom food home, middle school stop playing
Niggas got murked in the sto'
9 to 10 making 20 dollars a day
Add more to my day
You know what I'm saying?
And this music across the street
Thank you Berkely I respect that
Ain't gotta check that, you feel me
05 fuck 'em, this my diary
I was burning inside
No lighters, no options
But a black and mild, with weed at a tip
You know what I'm saying?
Take a hit
05 fuck 'em

(Outro: Lil B)
This my diary before the diary, coming, my mind and my soul, 05 fuck 'em, London what it do, Lou Poucus what it do, man, London I see you, Shout out my dude Keyboard Kid, man what it do
