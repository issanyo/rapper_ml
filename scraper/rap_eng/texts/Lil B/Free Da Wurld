[Intro]
Hey man free all.. you know what i'm sayin
Free the whole world!

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Free all my niggas, man; I'm yelling "Fuck the judge"
Wanna lock me up because "I'm black" and "I'm a thug"
I'm flexing 36, man; tell my niggas what's up
I ain't gonna lie bruh, I'm finna merk the judge
I'm finna merk the judge, man, I'm finna merk the judge
I ain't finna lie bruh, I'm finna merk the judge
I'm finna merk the judge, man, I'm finna merk the judge

[Bridge]
Man these niggas keep doing the same thing
You know, lets just, you know what i'm sayin
Keep it positive though man
You know what i'm sayin?
Niggas be hating on niggas man
I don't know why man

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Fuck all the judges
That gave my niggas ten
Fuck the D.A. and fuck the bailiff
He love to see a nigga
In them chains and them cuffs
Them niggas keep you paid
And i'm locking niggas up
You love to see a nigga locked down
Doing 30, you throwing out the J
You throwing out the 40
That's another way to keep
A nigga enslaved
Once you in court
You playin a whole nother game
Best thing to do is
Stay your ass out of trouble
I can't tell these kids
You gotta learn your own lesson
Young niggas hustle
Young niggas flex
The judge and the DA
Wanna fuck you in the ass
They don't care about your past
Your color, and the number
They lockin niggas up
To kill off motherfuckers

[Hook]
Man i'm yelling fuck the judge
Free all my niggas
Man i'm yelling fuck the judge
Free all my niggas
Man i'm yelling fuck the judge
Free all my niggas
Man i'm yelling fuck the judge
Free all my niggas
Man i'm yelling fuck the judge
Free all my niggas
Man i'm yelling fuck the judge
Free all my niggas
Man i'm yelling fuck the judge
Free all my niggas
Man i'm yelling fuck the judge

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Niggas ain't gone get out
Til they 30, maybe 40
Niggas keep stealing flags
Finna put you in the coffin
Free all my niggas doing bad
On that case
Can a nigga get a lawyer?
Can a nigget beat the case?
If you be anything then you
Fucking gotta have money
Pushing everything
Man you know you gotta want it
Stay positive, don't even do crime
Ya feel me?

[Hook]
