I got trees on deck
Got ass on deck, nigga
It's Lil' Boss
Based freestyle

Do my thang like studder
All these bitches on me like feathers
Y'all must be a chicken
I got meat like a chicken
And it ain't little, not little
Like a animal fiddles
Got a pickle for the bitch
Bitch if you switch
You in it, lil' nigga just spitting
Based freestyle boy and it never writing
Just all about the paper
The paper or the money the paper or the scrapers
I'm just pounding that in y'all head
So y'all can really feel the bay bitch all the way
Yea, really feel that shit all the way
Audible quarterback bitch, my boss today
Alright seven hundred front boys bitch alright
Yea, alright seven hundred front boys bitch alright
