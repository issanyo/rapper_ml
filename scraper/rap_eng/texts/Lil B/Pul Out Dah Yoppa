[Hook]
Might change your life, we can't go home
Everybody know how the game go
Hit you with the stick for that motherfuckin' gold
Everybody know how the game go
Still draw the yoppa on that motherfuckin' pole
Everybody know how the game go
Hittin' licks on sucka or these motherfuckin' hoes
Everybody know how the game go

[Verse 1]
Might draw the yoppa on that motherfuckin' pole
Boy check this here, you know how it go
Out here flirting with these motherfuckin' hoes
Man, I'm robbin', man might hit your home
Ride Astin Martin to the motherfuckin' show
Take this money and I take your fuckin' clothes
I'm a stunna, bitch I'm a hustler
Trap house boom and you know we do a number

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Pull out the yoppa, pull out the yoppa
Pull out the yoppa, pull out the yoppa
Pull out the yoppa, pull out the yoppa
Pull out the yoppa, pull out the yoppa

[Verse 2]
Hit you with that stick like a god damn bitch
Pull that yoppa out and you know you gon' snitch
Yoppas in the car and there's yoppas in the house
Yoppas in the dresser and there's yoppas in the couch
Dope in the freezer, there's dope in my mouth
You don't think I sell dope bitch?
Go and check the couch
Everyday I sell dope and it's [?]
Everyday I sell dope, you know it's for the low
Fuck in checkin'mail and you know I check the ho
Selling hand bags like I'm in Mexico
Got a couple purses at the corner store
Check this here bitch, you know how it go

[Hook]
