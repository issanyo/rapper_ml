[Intro]
Hey could ya'll give me a kick real fast
I like that, I like that
Yeah
Welcome to my Baseworld cafe
Yeah
Downstairs lair the office
We're relaxing

[Verse]
My perception and image gets better and finished
Rapping
All the time expanding my global pimping
Expanding the holes inflicted
Hold for ransom, your hoes and bitches
Heat landing, reloading clips and
Can't stand (?) whips and
I ain't with it, whips and
All this weed, yolla, and Egyptian
Drug lords smuggle illegal goods from boats and bricks and
Keep the walkie-talkie handled
Fuck niggas that's away and distant
Keep a Glock so shoot niggas from a distance
Heavy armor battle, disappear like Jason X
Hitting the shadows
Niggas hit windows, looking around
Chasing the indo
I'm not trying to talk 'cause when I do I offend most
I run yo sh- its so simple
Its extra weight, case I hold
Talk to the mass, take off your blindfold
In my home no talking back, its spitting chrome
Deadly verses already, what I need bullets for?
My pen ammunition, my lead is a steady flow
Pad put your together, that's a steady show
It reminds me of a (?) when I spark
I'm the-
That's very logical
When I'm in the zone
Debating hoes instead of
(?) hoes, I should be dating hoes
Game is crossover
Like '84, stats show
Touching niggas like numbers, flipping 'em like switches
If ya'll ain't forgot about it, fuck 'em
Hit me with another kick man
Yeah

[Outro]
Like you know, just keeping it based
You know they always ask that mean
Thank you for that kick
And you know its staying positive
Doing what you do, being yourself
Man you know, not worrying about what somebody else says
Staying based is just doing what you gotta do man
Keep it positive
Yeah
This is Obama BasedGod making history
Mixtape always
Feel like Imma be in that Whitehouse soon
Mm
Give me a kick, uh
Its Lil B, braaang braaang
