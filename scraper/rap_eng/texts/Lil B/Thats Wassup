(Intro)

Yo, welcome to the 2010s
Everybody come to the front, yeah, yo, put your hands up
Sometimes I sit and think, is there another tomorrow
Sometimes I sit and I think, is there another tomorrow, check me out

(Verse)

Sometimes I sit and I think, is there another tomorrow
To think, if I blink, will I blink twice, tomorrow
If I sink, will I sink twice, tomorrow
If I go, will I go tomorrow
If you know that I got to go, tomorrow
Then please let live till tomorrow and if you wanna see me, you gotta walk over, never fall over sorrows
The hunger everything up in the blunter

(Lil B talking)

Yeah you know right, man
That's right, man, it is about the group

Yeah

(Verse x2)

If there is another tomorrow, will there be another tomorrow
If I'm seeing another tomorrow, how can I blink if I could not sleep if I wake up tomorrow
Will it be unique, tomorrow, after the day after the next, I might have a haircut
I might not have nothing, but what if I have lost everything the day after tomorrow
And tomorrow back steps two days is what I'm at today
What you doing tomorrow if I call you two days after tomorrow
Will I be sorrow
You'll never know, you'll never know about anything
You'll never know about anything whatever you wanna do, anything you wanna do

(Lil B talking)
Hey B man, hey hey, Lil B, check this out, bro
Shut the fuck up
Hey hey, Lil B man
Shut up, shut up, Lil B, bro
Hey man, I'll tell you like this, bro
Listen to this real shit and quit hating on my dick, bro
You feel me?

MF Based, bro, 500 thousand
The day after tomorrow, baby
If it's tomorrow after tomorrow, then what's today
You know what I mean, hopefully I live just to see tomorrow after tomorrow
And the next day after that
Thats wassup

Thats wassup, put your hands up (x5)
