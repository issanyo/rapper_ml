Yeah we must have a motherfuckin' problem or somethin', huh?

[VERSE 1]
Let me tell you something, bitch, I got the swagger
Every girl sucks on my dick cause I'm Jesus Christ
You niggas got me fucked up, I'm still up in the functions
I'm still Young Based God, I stay on those Twinkies
I make these hoes lick me, I pay some for bitches
They comin' with me, that money ain't comin' with me
They call me that pretty bitch, I layaway that 4-5
You dumb pussy, this Bitch Mob, shouts out to Based World
I'm a Navy SEAL until I die, straight out that water, bitch
Rep Seventh Street, no color, come on bitch, I'm that lover
Don't know me, rich bitch, this ain't no fuckin' game
My Lil B, Based God, I gotta lot of...
Still rep for that west side, shouts out to south side
Shouts out to east side, shouts out to north side
Live my life, I don't care, bitch
Rich nigga, I'm a pretty bitch
Fuckin hoes in they ass, bitch
Bitch better come with that cash, you feel me?

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
You suckas didn't know I'm a dealer
I'm the weed man, Reggie Miller
Your sucka, ho-ass asked for ten dollars
I fucked her in the face for about ten hours
And you know I got that ten pack
It's not beer, nigga, it's that weed sack
Fuck around, bitch, I'll show you 'bout something
Thirty-five clips with that dummy
Long range and it's hunting
Fuck around me, bitch, it's nothing
Still freestyle for that ten dollars
Hundred thousand, I fill up all of these straight models
