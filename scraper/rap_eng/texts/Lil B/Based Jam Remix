[Intro]
Yeah
Off top
It's Lil Boss, yeah
Take a time in my mind, yeah
Time in my mind, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I love and trust a lot, but got little faith
Can't trust and love a bitch that's fake
All it takes is one time, and now the bitch got straight (Straight)
All she wanted was a code to the safe, a part of the bank
Most bitches ain't shit, credit cards and some change
It make you think, mind go blank
A lot of girls bird watchin', bitch might as well hate
You plottin' on my life but your life is fake
Playin' shows for nobody except your family and friends
Less is more, but try to be content without eatin' in the store
I look at clouds tryna find myself, there's more
I seen poverty, can't even live to afford a decent place to eat
Every system that was made tryna keep the black man lost
Jail system, only one that was made for more
They made the jail system for the black people, for sure
School system, bank system, all the white man law
Real estate, they made it, so the black family lost
Can't buy a house what you owe 'em
You own a car? Gotta be more
Lost your accounts and trust funds
Gotta live long, be strong, you feel me? (Yeah)
Shout out to Ernest [?] and the Cataracs
This my lifestyle, a better step (Step)
You gotta look at me, and give me a sign (Sign)
Make it rain or somethin'
All this game and questions, you gotta be frontin'
I got lots of love for the money and the power
What's left in my body? Couple ideas and thoughts
Tryna get next level, my life can't be bought
I'm too real for the world, I know it for sure
How you wake up and still be sleep? My heart beat
I keep it realer than real, my life's unique
Lil B, you can't complete, I am never cheap (Cheap)
Bitch (Yeah)
