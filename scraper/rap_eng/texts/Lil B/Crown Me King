BASEDGOD

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Now I'm gettin hot these niggas mad that I'm on the grind
Heard you got all the bitches bruh, that's a fuckin lie
My niggas from the waterfront, ask me seventh street
Ask me what I'm doin bitch I'm looking for the chewing, aye
Ten thousand dollar licks I'm on like Titan Tron
Rap game is shady so I'm fuckin with a magnum on
Cell phone I'm on callin me and textin me
I got a sexy bitch that speak Spanish like a Mexican
I been famous bitch, got signed when I was fifteen
I can fuck any bitch I want because I'm Lil B
Plus I pimp Lil B and that's a pretty bitch bruh
Thirty thousand dollars make your girl suck my dick cause

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Now I'm still Thraxx like coke boy I'm automatic
Six pieces, like pizzas
I said I needed six piece I'm hungry like an Indian
The rap game put me on my dick like I'm beatin it
Look me in my eyes I'm online like I'm online
Young nigga told me if I rap, gotta work hard
Five hundred based freestyles, I need a black car
A hundred myspaces bruh, what I do that for?
Plus I'm in the fast car driving like a high speed
Tatted on my throat and my chest bitch I'm heem
Had the ice chains, now I'm rockin on some new shit
Had to dump my old bitch, now I got a new bitch
