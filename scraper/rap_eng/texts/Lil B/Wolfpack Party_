Tell your friends it's a Wolfpack party
Tell your freaks it's a Wolfpack party
Drinks on me

Bitch I'm on that pop shit
Yes I'm a baller
I move into the Hills
Take trips with the foreigners
Different color diamonds
And all the women love me
She asked about my job
And I told her that it's lovely
Yes, I'm famous, a celebrity
Drinkin' Crystal in Beverly
TMZ Magazines, paparazzi
Brrang dang dang
Fuck you if you don't like me

Anyways, I'm on that next level
All white Coupe, pearl thang, space shuttle
Too fly, so I got your bitch eyein'

Young Giant shittin' on them veterans
See the swag, Cal Ber Letterman
Tell me who is better than 2800 Stunna Man
Catch me if you can
I don't think you will
Hundred center fifties
We don't do the small bills
28's I don't ride small wheels

All drinks on me
Cause I'm ballin'
I like girls, so all girls invited
Pop a pill and let's roll like Midas
Seventy five, baby I'm the flyest
Whoever said I wasn't, baby, they are lyin'
