[Intro]
We thuggin' or what, nigga?
Obama Basedgod, they trying to assassinate me
Fuck 'em, I'm still watching shit
Yeah

[Verse]
I ain't gon' lie, I seen troublesome days
Nigga posted in the hood, slipped in the rain
Metaphor to my life, 'cause I'm going insane
People married to the block, what set do you claim?
I was going downhill but nobody came
Everybody just watched, nobody complained
Most people follow others, keep it simple and plain
If you do your own thing, you ahead of the game
If you follow someone, make sure that they solid
Bust my own moves, got my own problems
Seen the streets and I seen who's solid
The clique run popping
Look at me when the clique run popping
Might try and say I'm stranger when my life's in danger
Think fast nigga, die when you're anxious
Don't think twice, I'll be out in a second
Don't knock on the door, I'll be back at eleven
Gonna hit them nights, I'm young to be out
Don't be in the streets too early, wake up Shirley
Come back with [?]
Came back with the MAC, blow that jersey
Threw his thoughts on the wall, too early
This is a constant war, people dying is so hard
We tripping off the black cards, just live your life
It's worth more than anything you've purchased
Hide by your money, the devil is working
I promise one thing, I'll bounce back for Shirley
Treat me like a stranger, I'm a gangster
Like cowboys riding through the horse and deserts
Finna stick up the town, find some treasure
Threw the ice in the snow, I keep it cold
See me on the railroad, I'm taking strolls
Long rides downtown, can't play theâ€”
My brain don't think, my mind suppose
If I knew I was, I would go
Keep on rolling, keep on the flame
Listening to Green Flame
We all got a purpose, we all seen the pain
Just control your life and control those things
See some things and control that pain
Just use your brain
He booksmart but he don't know the game
He don't know the game

[Outro]
You know motherfuckers be booksmart
But they don't know the game, though
You feel me?
You gotta know it, dig deep man, dig deep
I'm talking about like Green Flame
Nah man, that's task force
Dig deep
You know worldwide man we still thugging 100% man, for sure
East side, what up nigga?
You already know what it do
Lil B I see ya
Yesss
