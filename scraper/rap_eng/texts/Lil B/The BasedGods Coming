[Intro]
Young Gutta shit. You feel me, Bay Area shit. Lil B. West side

[Verse]
If you real then you made it out the cage just know
Burn one for the people that we lost
All the heroes and villains never exhaust
Put my heart to the cross, people sleeping on the street
Homeless person outside live more comfortable than me
This beyond white on white, shit for education
Tryna find some balance, history in the making
Got me feeling like Egypt was a conspiracy theory
They got it on lock and our mind's a spirit
Free yourself from the evil every time that you hear it
Misleading the people with them evil spirits
You not a critic or expert on black lives
Cause black lives matter but you hate these rappers
I hate anybody that's fake, it's that fuckin' plaster
Scratchin' out a life of these ballroom ashes
Performin' my pain, the love that I'm having
Working on the [?] I ain't lying
You can't go to sleep in the field of lions
I'm surviving, close your ears, you missed the
If you love Lil B, I love you too
I appreciate the people that love me forever
Been waiting on the Boss through the stormy weather
Keep my music close to your arms
This blood, keep your body running
This beyond city, we got the BasedGod coming
This is beyond the whole world, we got the BasedGod coming
I'm like the engine cause it keep your car running
It's Lil Boss, yeah
