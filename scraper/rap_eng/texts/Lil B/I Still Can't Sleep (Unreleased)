[Verse 1:]
Night after night I was lookin like shit
Don't nobody understand I was moving like this
Duffel bag in my hand with them devilish thoughts
Not thinking about murder, but nothing at all
No foundation, base my life around a mindset
Now it's time spent violence inside of
I am too powerful to grind with a 9 to 5
Rather do overtime than face a 9
Rather push shopping carts than committing crimes
The hustle game backwards, it's actors who disguise themselves up as rappers
Niggas, hollering G-Code but killing this communities faster
With the shit that they glorifying
Like some ignorant bastards, motherfucker

[Verse 2:]
I'm thinking I'mma die alone, and I'mma cry alone
Even if a sucka killed me I would not be flown
He would not be thrown, I'll leave my mark
This BasedWorld music, something they won't break apart
Niggas scared in dark, but fate is on my mind
Walkin round half blind, man I can't decide
Got my prior fucked up now I play it even
What goes around, comes around you'll catch a fade this evening
Some people don't wake up from their pain and bleeding
I'd rather live my life real than look great this evening
Hope God lookin out for my mama
Would break my heart to see her die without me rich in the Bahamas
This is what I'm grinding for, now, fuck it, later
Fuck later, Lil B for life
