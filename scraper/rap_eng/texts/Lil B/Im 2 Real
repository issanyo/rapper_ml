Just because he claim real don't mean that he real
People lie every day for the money and thrills
Had to take a step back cause the game too fake
And I'm 2 real
Just because he claim real don't mean that he real
People lie every day for the money and thrills
Had to take a step back cause the game too fake
And I'm 2 real

People hate cause the clothes you got
The car you drive, the nicest watch
Your home boys plot, associates
They be close contacts but I know this shit
I see that you see but this ain't just free
I work too hard like the [?]
They act like they are [?] trying to stick to the role, suckers is cold
But the game is old, niggers is scared, niggers lying on they dick
And I ain't talking about hoes, in general, they lying [?] that iron
Squeezing the heat, the game fades nigga
Hmm, the shit make you cry, squeeze the heat with the same gun
You brought from your cousin
I stay away from the drama, that's the end of discussion
Motherfucking suckers

Yeah, don't mean that he real
People lie every day for the money and thrills
Had to take a step back cause the game too fake
And I'm 2 real
Just because he claim real don't mean that he real
People lie every day for the money and thrills
Had to take a step back cause the game too fake
And I'm 2 real you know
This the shit is man
Like I said nigga the game too fake
But I'm 2 real

Nah, I can't see but you can see
Inside your soul, inside your soul [?] cold
[?] for the past, hatred last
Had to move the small shit, cause the sea weed glass
That was in my eye, blinded me
Couldn't see the block, pay a sign to me
Another clone, I chose to wake up
Why you gonna lie then, that's just fucked up
Why you gonna hate like that man, it's too much shit
I'm a standup guy, with them gold [?]
Niggers hate cause the boss is here I'm already
Cop the coup the g25 already
Marble 4 look like spaghetti
Cop the new house, niggers hating already
Start to come up, yeah, you back already
Bored out of life soldier nigga [?]
Nigga, let me bring that back to you
[?] shouts out to 2pac

Just because he claim real don't mean that he real
People lie every day for the money and thrills
Had to take a step back cause the game too fake
And I'm 2 real
For real man this shit is real deep nigga
Wanna take with it, that's how real I am with it
That's how I feel about these niggers

Just because he claim real don't mean that he real
People lie every day for the money and thrills
Had to take a step back cause the game too fake
And I'm 2 real
Just because he claim real don't mean that he real
People lie every day for the money and thrills
Had to take a step back cause the game too fake
And I'm 2 real
