[Lil B]
Its Lil B
You are not what you appear to be
I can see, I can see the fake
I live based, so don't try to be based

[Verse - Lil B]
I live based so when I see that you're acting like
You're tryna be based but you're really just not
You're regular, you're a person, you don't imagine
You don't dream, basedworld is a creative thing
This is me
No this is us
Basedworld we are one
Im just a speaker from above
This is love
This is life on the right this is me
I wanna tell everybody that
This rap game is so , so crazy because it turns people out
Their faces no longer a face
Just stay in your place stay in space respect the space office space
Theres never enough space for my movie
And you're appearing to be
Something that I've never seen
That has me - so above the bought
So above the timeless the time is already
I never-
In my life - alright
But my life was alright
Told him something above nothing
Told him something up in the light
Told him something above the light
Alright
Tell him that we're here alright
Told him that we're on
Alright alright
All the things that I've said
Boy alright
Man I say my life is not a game so just don't try to play it
Alright
You can show me the way
My life is so, on one
Alright
Show me something up in the night
Im based till I die
Im based till I die
Im based till I die
I said Im based till I die
With my hands up in the sky Im alright
In the sky with my hands to the sky
Basedworld alright
Alright nyeaahh
Yeaaahh yeaah yeaahh
