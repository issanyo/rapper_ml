[Chorus]
Based God
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Go dumb!

[Verse 1]
Most of my life I've seen pain in this fucking game
I'mma keep it real sometimes it's hard being a black man
I be crying but nobody gives a fuck about it
Who do I trust in this world where my mind is cloudy
I be feeling sometimes that I'm too cool
But how the fuck can I be cool when my family need me making moves
How the fuck is this world so messed up
We all see the pain but nobody gives a fuck
Sometimes I want to explode and lose control
But I know y'all need me more than you show
That's how it goes we've got more love than people know
They think you weak, I think you cool
I think you dope
When they take your confidence they got you by the rope
That's why I keep it real for all my niggas
I swear to god y'all know
I'm taking it right to you
Cause you our only hope
So everybody clique up and let's go push this dope

[Chorus]
Based God
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Go dumb!

[Verse 2]
I've been betrayed so many times it's a normal thing
Now I'm bringing suckers pain, dropping rain
You be looking at my life like it's fun and games
But who gonna pay my rent motherfucker?
I ain't playing, I don't got time to be playing
All these mind tricks
Stop giving that ho pleasure motherfucker
You don't need that bitch
She probably gonna lie and say you assaulted her
Look at Emmitt Till, that bitch was lying bruh
How the fuck can you trust another bitch
And I ain't about no pussy motherfucker
It's about getting rich
These bitches think you black, you an easy target
You stupid bitch I got love
But you made me heartless
And it ain't about having love it's about having dollars
Because there's a rich motherfucker that I know who never stepped foot in college
But man, get your education that's to rule the nation
And lets shock the world, this our generation

[Chorus]
Based God
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck I'm from?
The west coast
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Where the fuck you from?
Go dumb!
