[Intro:]
This is what happens when you have so many bitches
You get depressed and go insane

I got bitches, this real bitch music
Fuck hating suckas I got the girls to prove it
My bitch look good, she the same as color as a buick
Fuck is you doing? Them bitches ain't choosin'
They love the Based God, the bitch is not a groupie
I met the Based God and no he's not stupid
He said he'll tie me to a tank of propane (The Game)
