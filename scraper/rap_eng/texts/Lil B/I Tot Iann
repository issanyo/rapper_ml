[Intro]
You feel me, aye now I'mma tell you this
Every time I (BasedWorld Records) get through it
Water is D.M.G., fuck these suckers you feel me

[Verse 1]
I can't be that nigga getting hit
I'mma tell you like this, I'mma bust a - shit
It ain't no love in this bitch
How I'm rolling out? Hundred deep in this bitch
I might tote that fire if I have to, and I might do some time if I have to
I'm the type of bitch that don't pay a lawyer
I know I did it and I'mma take the charges
Send me bout five of 'em, do that come back put the iron on him
BasedWorld O.D., never been that, never been sleep
Keep my eyes open in this fucking jungle
Ha, you better watch your head, cause that boy interferes
Sucker out here trying to fade my head

[Hook](4x)
I'mma tell you like this I tote iron, I'mma tell you like this I ain't lying

[Verse 2]
Bitch ass sucker, I ain't fake
I'mma tell you like this, I'mma punch him in his face
Feel how I felt, I'mma tell you like this: I'mma give yo' ass the real
I'm down like two dollar, and I'm dope like a fat bitch
And I got that yeedee in my pocket, and I motherfucking cock it
Come off like a fiend, haters make me mad and I don't sleep
And I stlll pop a pill, backseat woodgrain up on the wheel
Two couches in the whip, old school scraper counting money in that bitch
Sucker haters keep on hating, got the -s and I'm still fucking wavy fucking bitch

[Hook]
I'mma tell you like this I tote iron, I'mma tell you like this I ain't lying

(9x) This I ain't lying
