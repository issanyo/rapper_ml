[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Goddamn, look who just stepped in
The cat done drug up a wolf from the den, hey
Not long ago I was wiping his ass
Now he's a rich rapper wiping his ass with cash
It didn't take much for me to realize I was on my own
Moving through woods like Donkey Kong
I invented that classic rock soul
My momma was too inhibited with brothers and black crows
We got the dirty shit locked in the boon docks
Grain fed cattle means we gon' shroom pop
I'm in touch with my inner star, you watch
I'll stand up in Hollywood and spit moon rocks
Bitches wanna know the real Yelawolf, really?
All the whore will get to see is Catfish Billy
The world around my childhood was a crooked wall
I had to reach high to see above the weed fog
Pop a head on the crawfish and soak it dry
I pop your head if you talk shit, I bust your eye
You know I'm southern, I got a grill and a dirty frown
Y'all coming with me, I'm the future in town
It's going down, Shady

[Pre-Verse Ad-Libs: Kendrick Lamar]
What up? Lemme catch the beat
What up? Swag, swag, Based God I hear you
What up? Swag, swag, yeah, G shit
Westside, huh, look

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm beyond the most slept on, stepped on
Stepsons, father of rap songs, writing my wrongs
Writing in the book of psalms
This is the word, word to the holy Qur'an
Or whatever that's foreign to ya
I find it funny that you are embracing a storm, wait
Ring the alarm or wake up with a bomb through ya
It's Baghdad kids with bad dads, cops with bad badges
Big bullets, no "My bads" once them guns shoot ya
I said, "Yo, I might go hard as the Mike Jordan
Lace up my Jordans and yellin' out ISO"
Ike Turner your idol, whip 'em and bruise 'em
Stick poison inside his pie-hole, sad that you knew him
We influence the heart of thousands, nine-hundred-and-ninty-nine-thousand, but who's counting
Thirsty for success and we drink from the youth fountain
Big headed, tryna stay grounded like a delinquent in middle school clowin'
Drownin' MCs, they want life jackets
While we swim backwards we yellin' "Nigga, please!"
Pay your respect or recognize the alphabet
You can't survive in a room full of g's
Coached by my uncle, Lil Mane, I resemble him
They tryna tilt the game and we killing all Thebes
Make 'em all blood, make 'em all bleed
Motherfucker die, put a ribbon in the sky
Till Stevie Wonder sing, king of all kings
Jokers and new jacks can get dealt with
Royal flush when I drop shit and say these things
Mad leaning on 'em 'cause half of these niggas Maybelline
All made up, 'bout to go dummy
On a dummy, what, what, treat him like a welterweight
And stuff him in some trunks, you fucking with a giant
I'm Forest Whitaker sparring with some Forrest Gump's
What you want?

[Pre-Verse Ad-Libs: Lil B]
Look how good I look, man, it's Lil B
Yeah, ayy, check this, uh

[Verse 3: Lil B]
My nigga told me if I ever stop rapping
The game lost Jordan, trade him to the Magic
Exhibit Based not Exhibit C
Niggas couldn't see, let me part the sea
Part a part of me, nothing pardons me
You niggas arguably is worse than me
Get your whole squad, let me go hearse your team
Pop bullets in his back, make him work his knees
This is sick I'm on top now
I remember in the hood I was locked down Oakland, Yosemite
Having YA dreams appearing right ahead of me
Now I'm getting glad that you niggas ain't ahead of me
And you'll never be forgetting me
Hard drive, man, it's all about the memory
Strapped with a vest screaming "Motherfuck my enemies"
Uh, have 'em moving like a centipede
I'm the weed-man so you know I got the remedy
Plus I'm a user, dope-fiend music
Plus I'm a robber and I dare you suckas push me
Got the same pistol that they shootingâ€”I'm too nice
I'm the rawest rapper, I'm done, I'm done

[Verse 4: Cyhi Da Prynce]
Nah, I ain't done no faking but here come the H-game
We were the shit before the cake came
I hate lames, they get mad because we make change
And I ain't even had to bake caine
But I keep the weight gain on the freight train
Fuck dope, I'm on the kush and the haze game
In the streets I got a great name
I'm a pimp cause I break dames
Play with my pay, I see my great danes
Pauls let the face bang, huh
Trapping was cool till the J came
Then they found a couple tools and the ye, damn
Then niggas change colors like a fake chain
Prince of the South, hoe, you won't catch me without Dro
I'm like T.I., pimping's in my genes, and ain't talking 'bout Levi's
I keep the kush and like the couch fold
And the toy like G.I. Joe
Bet a G I. blow
You pussy niggas wanna fight I outdoors
The devil stay right, Ali eat, ya'll close
Cause I'm swinging the three plus three-five O's
We got chickens nigga E-I-O
What you seeing off a pound nigga, we see off O's
Catch me in the 'Lac with three [?]
And I ain't fucking with you niggas 'cause I see y'all hoes
Cyhi, let's get it
