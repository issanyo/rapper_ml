Niggas know me, I'm a keep you smoking
Still like I'm a kill, then I keep on rolling
Niggas wanna hate, hate this choppa, gon fold uh
I ain't been the one to complain the bitch
All these niggas snitch, and shake defense
I'm on defense cause these niggas is creep
No help from the street, niggas play for keeps

I'm a draw down, I'm a hold the Mack
RIP my niggas never coming back
Motherfuck the world, that's just how I feel
Takin shots to the brain for my niggas' killas
Died too young, and this how I feel
I wanna cry, cause my pain for real
Shot to the brain, lock and I aim
Gave up on life for this motherfuckin fame
It's Lil B
