[Intro]
I know I could be wrong about a lot of shit
And I know I could be right about a lot of things
I'm just doing what I do

[Hook]
I'm tryna sell this brick
The only thing I know is to take this trip
Real hustler music, you know what I'm sayin'
Real gutta music, you know what I'm sayin'
And if you snitch on the kid
I fuck your whole family and dunk on your wig
Real hustler music, you know what I'm sayin'
Real gutta music, you know what I'm sayin'

[Verse 1]
Still on that petty crime, tryna take my last trip
Still selling dime bags, tryna push my last zip
Paying at the broad tracks , seeing who gon' cop one
I'll sell anything moving if you tryna drop some
Won't sell my soul and I won't snitch on myself
Won't snitch on you, stay in your lane, bitch
Out in East Oakland looking at these prositutes
They don't give a fuck about me or you
Rich man wanna see you dead with no loot
Won't let me in so what I gotta do
Don't like the color of my skin so I gotta move
If you hate me, I love you too
Growing up low income make you crazy too
Four hundred year head start, I'm just sayin' dude
Don't judge a young thug
I want an education, I don't wanna sell drugs

[Hook]
I'm tryna sell this brick
The only thing I know is to take this trade
Real hustler music, you know what I'm sayin'
Real gutta music, you know what I'm sayin'
And if you snitch on the kid
I fuck your whole family and dunk on your wig
Real hustler music, you know what I'm sayin'
Real gutta music, you know what I'm sayin'

[Interlude]
Real shit from the heart man
Real pain, man
You know what I'm sayin'

[Verse 2]
Mack Maine, Lil Wayne I respect you
I'm still in the hood and I'm feeling like the drive through
Too many customers, no I can't deny you
You want this fast food, you only get it in the hood
White man wanna kill my kins like it's all good
Don't gotta say what it is, I see it though
Drive around black neighborhoods, they got us trapped
Fast food everywhere, they on my back
Yeah I been lied to, praying to this bible shit
What about Egypt, I see they forgot again
No I'm not racist, maybe just prejudice
Just because my skin's black means I got melanin
Praying to the sun my afro grow like the earth
Y'all feel me, y'all everywhere
I said y'all everywhere
Feel like I've always been here but I'm never there

[Hook]
I'm tryna sell this brick
The only thing I know is to take this trade
Real hustler music, you know what I'm sayin'
Real gutta music, you know what I'm sayin'
And if you snitch on the kid
I fuck your whole family and dunk on your wig
Real hustler music, you know what I'm sayin'
Real gutta music, you know what I'm sayin'
