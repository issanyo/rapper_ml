[Intro]
Have you ever felt that feeling where you just like man it's so real
You gotta do it
It don't even matter, you feel me
Shit be so real you just be like bruh I gotta do it

[Verse]
I can't play with these niggas
Last time I played games a bitch got slapped
Came straight out the cut like a niggas had a rash
What you wanna do bitch, I'm [?] and I'm [?]
Young nigga winning
A young nigga in a flash
Flash so fast you would think I'm the Flash
Pushing Ferarri then I switched to the Honda
Couple guns, put 'em in the Mazda
Got a bag of money you feel me
A hundred thousand in the hood
A hundred thousand in the roof
A hundred grand in the pocket
Niggas think I'm playing
Niggas ride solo, niggas think I'm playing
You feel me
Until your shit look tan
[?]
Push suckers off the edge
05 Fuck Em, now that's word til I'm dead
Fuck 'em man, everybody gotta win
If I lose, a real nigga gotta win
Come back man, you feel me
A couple bodies man, it's no fucking [?]
You know what I'm saying
But why your niggas wasn't there
Always been alone man I never been a clone man
I always had them nights of talking on them phones
Who's coming? Who's grown?
Thinking I'm the man, I gotta get paid
Fuck that man, I'm real to the grave
It's funny that you lying man, I'm just saying
You feel me
I'm the rawest rapper
Before I came in the game, I was already in the game
Filling out the court, making my wave
You feel me
Seeing them niggas, I gotta get paid
I was really out there

So what you saying man
So what you saying

I know I wanna leave but I really wanna stay
05 Fuck Em man, it's the mixtape
I'ma go platinum my first album
Go fast forward
I was in the hood, nobody cared, you feel me
Nigga I was always there, you feel me
I'm always here
My life nigga, Lil B what up, I'm there
Gotta keep stacking up
Started from the bottom, nigga my grams stacked up
I had to get my chips up
I had to get my mind up
And I had to get my drips up
And shout out to all the real people doing thangs man in the 80s
Shout out to Haiti
Ayy man I'm getting money outchea man
These niggas gotta pay me
It's Lil B
05 Fuck 'Em nigga
Keep it based nigga, keep it based

[Outro]
Oh yeah you know I be just gassing shit
You know this shit effortless [?]
