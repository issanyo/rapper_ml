You see that light up there?
Oh yeah, that shit's so beautiful
God's Father Mixtape

[Hook]
I'm still in love with you
It don't matter what your friends do
They're just jealous of me and you
And i'll always keep you happy
Cause I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love

[Lil B]
Yeah, like I said it's your boy lil b
We just riding out and vibing out, yeah
Yeah, feel B, nigga you already know Based God
Going all the way the fuck in


[Verse 1]
Nigga never let up on the concepts, nonsense
I been having cents with the shit in my pocket
Nigga hold the lockets, been speaking holding comments
Hit ya ass harder than a comet, rocket boy bitch
No comments fired I'm snuffed out by your momma nigga
I know regrets has been problems, been posted up blocking
Cash money pocket got the little boy breads all up in my pocket
Nigga just stop it, we some fucking lions
Nigga got sworn in and started forming' an alliance
Somebody fed to the lions
We all hungry, smoke weed purple
Get ya vibe in, drink a little, put you on a island
Dump ya body, put you on a island

[Hook]

[Lil B]
Feel me
I ain't never won, I just keep it one. (3x)

[Verse 2]
I've done seen a dead body up on the islands
You ain't gotta see it popping; man I love pussy popping
Pussy tip like mystical shit I'm show stopping' man
Girl weeks, yo outfit show stopping
Got the green, got the new shit, blue shit, watches
God damn everybody watching the flows couldn't stop it man
The crowd getting bigger than the opera, give ya time to live
Give ya options before I make ya material, man like Madonna
And pop ya, block ya, stop ya, drop ya, blocka, blocka
Nigga think about conscious rap it's kinda funny
How they illegit paying taxes like a ya and I still hold the turf to the chopper
Like a right, I hold the chopper with that mother fucking right hand, I'm the man

[Hook]
