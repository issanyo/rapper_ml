I feel, I feel
As I'm walkin' down the street
Down the road in BasedNam, where I slightly float, I feel like I'm alone
It's ya boy Lil B
You already know what this is
I'm walkin' down the street alone, I can't see anything
Cars above my face, I can't see anything
BasedWorld and BasedNam are so different from any other place
I feel like I'm floatin', my face in outer space, nobody can see it but still
We race, try to beat each other, but really, we're all in the same space, BasedNam, positive, one place
I swear I'm an alien, martian based
Illegal martian, don't play with me
They with me and just say everything
I need to answer the phone
Yes

Captain, captain! I want to be a part... Of what you're doing
Captain, before you ever rap, I want to tell you, you need to listen, man
Feel it in your heart, this is not just spittin'
I'm not just a rapper
I don't feel, and I don't even know if I'm a rapper anymore
