[Lil B: Intro/Hook]
This is for the seasons
This is for the seasons
This is for the seasons
This is for the seasons

[Interlude 1]
Mmm. Mm mm mmm mm mm mm mmm mm mm mm mm da da badup bum!
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I'm back in the hood, Ma; yeah I'm back tonight
You look happy today; you look happy, alright
Your son made it through, all these crabs in the bucket
She understands how this hood life can eat you up
I've seen brothers, sisters go bad, it ain't enough
I had to see the pain first hand, she looked up
At the sky
I told her that my dreams is real, she gave me a hug
"Only thing that's real is love"
So don't walk past if you ain't nodding
You gotta have money just paying with knowledge
Just because you don't care don't mean that you shouldn't
It's easy to give up, much harder to push it
Thanks, Mom; I'm about to walk back in the house
I left my old attitude outside; I threw it out
It feels good to be a new changed man
In a world where everybody's choice is in your hand
It's Lil B

[Interlude 2]
Like I said, man, it feel like the season where we, where we really just gon' make change and, and do what we gotta do. Water Is D.M.G. Real hip-hop. let's get it
Yeah!

[Outro]
I keep it in my life alright
(For the seasons)
Mine don't stop cause this is for the seasons (Tell me what time tonight!)
And you keep on hating on me cause this is for the seasons (Aah! Alright! Ooh!)
Everybody keep they head up cause this is for the season (Oh! Oh! Oh! Alright!)
This is for my life (Arrah! Ahaah!)
This is for the seasons (Alright tonight!)
