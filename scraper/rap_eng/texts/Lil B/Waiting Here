[Intro: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL]
I know, I know
Crystalline skies show Saturn’s waning
Why am I always waiting here?
No command to pull me together
Why’s the directive so unclear?

[Hook: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL]
Crystalline skies show Saturn’s waning
Why am I always waiting here?
No command to pull me together
Why’s the directive so unclear?
Tell me what to align to, baby
Something is in my house this year
History’s what we make it, baby
Maybe this time I’ll stay right here
Crystalline skies show Saturn’s waning
Why am I always waiting here?
No command to pull me together
Why’s the directive so unclear?

[Verse 1: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL]
​iPhone on mute, in the back room
Never come through, I can't
What is this for? Maybe I'm bored
Maybe I've tied my hands
Or maybe I've found myself
Underneath all the moons
Curvature lines, shattered through time
Maybe it's not my plan
First I put a light on for you
Then I draw a bath myself
Sometimes I’m aligned within you
Other times, I’m someone else
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in
Crystalline skies show Saturn’s waning
Why am I always waiting here?

[Verse 2: Lil B & WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL]
Your body's on fire
Your body's on fire (You know that)
Watching me fly away
Watching me fly above you (Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in)
What could you say to me?
What could you say? (What could you say to me? What could you say to me? You know)
Go through fire, go through the darkness
Go through the rain, go through the [?] (You know that)
This is my real life (This is my real life)
This is my real life (This is my real life, this is my...)
Go through the green lights, go through the real life
Go through the stop signs, all of it
For you, for me, for you, for me, yeah
