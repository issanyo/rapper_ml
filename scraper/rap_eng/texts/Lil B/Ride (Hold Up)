[Verse 1]
30 on my hip, it's a 30 on my hip
Riding around Oakland, tryna cop a zip
Squeezed on your whip
Bounced out, with the ladder on the ship
28, with the ladder on the hip
Tryna keep a plan, see you bitches later
Free all my niggas that's locked in the pen
If you let 'em out, won't get locked up again
Feelin' like first Fridays
Bring the cars out on the highway
And we can pour five
Switch it four lanes, turn the music up loud
If you really on the hype
Come through, we can go out tonight
We can ride through the streets
I gotta keep a gun on the seats

[Hook]
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my name Lil B
I gotta have tints when I'm ridin' through the east
And my girl Filipino
She dancin' in a bar in Reno
I gotta keep it lit
Up in the club with a chop on the hip
If they don't let us in
Shoot this bitch up and won't come back again
We be feelin' so hostile
Up in the club with the 30 round
I'm feelin' like a rock star
Do a high speed past the cop car
I do this for my young niggas
Cause everybody know that I fuck with you
I gotta keep it lit
Up in the club with a chop on the hip

[Hook]
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up

[Verse 3]
We could ride through the west
See the high rise, fuck with the best
You need to tap in
Ten stolen cars, I was ready back then
Work at Nike cause I'm all about the check
Pick up my partna, all we do is flex
This what it do
Hit the sideshow, through the woopty-woo
We could save all the chit-chat
And no, I don't smoke on them zig-zags
I just smoke blunts
See me in the club with the chop in the front
Might go and hit the whole strobe
Hit the club and get a couple mo'
That's what it do
In VIP with the ladder in the room

[Hook]
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up
Gotta keep it on me like a Motorola
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up, hold up, hold up
What's the hold up
