[Verse]
I never been the one to say the least, to say the least
Keep the lease, I got more years, this rap's my home
I rob this shit, rob the bitches, robbery monopoly
Ravioli money, I'ma eat it so sloppily
My nigga, I'm just it
I done rapped for ten years, put ten laps in
Niggas lucky I ain't never brung the ski mask in
I'm motivated by the math, so it's three times ten
Send shots to your face like, three times ten
Move suckers off the porch like, this my year
Man, my name is Lil Boss, gold mouth, daddy
Twomp sack shorty, but the bitch call me "daddy"
XM all day, satellite, so high
Cannabis all gay, this my game plan
So I run all day, ten twomp, a hundred million
Finna suplex her face and have her talking to a zillion
My mission in the game, to get my mama off the bus
If your boy got a bus, I'ma knock him off the truck
And this ain't just rapping, I'm a real Based boy
So this ain't just rapping, you feel me?
You come through your hood, cause you a new booty
I dip through the hood, cause my niggas respect me, you bitch
And I'm just letting off steam
You bag the whole zip, and you ain't seeing no things
Mary Jane been my bitch since fifteen
RIP Swag, Basedworld
Brangdang
My nigga, get the green
