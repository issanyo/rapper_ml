[Hook]
Bitches, on lockdown
Defense, on lockdown
The paint, on lockdown
And my hoes, on lockdown

[Verse 1]
Bitches in the paint, on lockdown
Hoes on my dick, cause I'm hot now
NBA TV, you see me
She on my dick in 3-D
Cheerleader fucked me, cause she freaky
Everybody see me on TV
Niggas, know they can't see me
Watch Lil B hoop in 3-D!
Fuck a bad bitch on the court
Dude, don't be a poor sport
I got drafted number one
I hoop everyday, cause it's fun
Everyday, newspaper write about me
They love me! (Lil B!)
And the game just started
Bitch, who go the hardest? (BasedGod!)

[Hook](x2)
(My) bitches, they on lockdown
Defense, on lockdown
The paint, it's on lockdown
My hoes, they on lockdown
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Call me Rondo, cause I'm hot now
Free all my niggas in Chi-Town
Scream "free all my niggas!" (x2)
When I hoop, I don't smoke or drink liquor
Offseason, I'm selling dope
Offseason, I'm buying five ki's
Offseason, I'm flying to Belize!
I sell dope when I play overseas
Come back with two-hundred G's
Bitch, that's all tax-free
The dope man don't tax me!
At the gym with the bitches in the Honda
Fuck KD, but I love the Thunder
With the bitches in the Hummer
Fuck KD, but I love the Thunder!

(My) bitches, they on lockdown
Defense, on lockdown
The paint, it's on lockdown
My hoes, they on lockdown
Hey!

[Verse 3]
Bitch in the club, cause I'm hot now
In Miami with my jaw on lockdown
Told the bitch, "I wanna fuck now"
I'm a NBA star, bitch, what now?!
Bitch, I know Ron Artest
Bitch, I know Klay Thompson
Bitch, I know Toni Kukoc
Go ahead and act like a ho!
I know a couple agents and scouts
Draft a bitch, and I fuck her in her mouth
WNBA, I love that!
Let me hit that pussy from the back
Lisa Leslie could dunk on me! (x3)
But girl, I ain't gon' play you for free

(My) bitches, they on lockdown
Defense, on lockdown
The paint, it's on lockdown
My hoes, they on lockdown
Hey!
