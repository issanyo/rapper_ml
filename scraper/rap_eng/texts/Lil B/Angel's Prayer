It's your boy Lil B
Realest nigga doing it, you feel me
I'mma tell it like this:
When I get I tracks I choose..
And it's very rare, if I get on your song you're lucky!

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
Nigga keep the lean right up under the speakers
Certified street nigga, bruh, you couldn't believe it
Quit fucking with me, you know I got the AK
Wait a second bitch, you know I got the 50
In New York I had a talk with 50
Real street nigga made a freak 360
Forever be a thug and I'll forever be 6th street
Forever be 7th, you niggas got me fucked up
Because I'm positive you niggas think that I'm a sucker
Til I pull that 9 out and have you sleeping in the river
My old G said "B you better dump the bitch!
How you got a girlfriend and you don't even love yourself?"
Now I understand: wisdom over knowledge
Bossed up nigga and I ain't even went to college
And I ain't dissin niggas mad at my opinion
Wishing I'mma fall, people hating from a distance
But they don't really know I got the forward simulation
Pull 211, make your whores stripping
Nigga look back, I never Scott Pippen
Michael Jordan king of the forest
And after this, Scottie Pippen rich
Don't compare me to them other little kids
I got more hustle than a girl selling houses
Dope up in the roof, nigga skiing over mountains
Dope up in my nose and I'm looking like a skeleton
Depressed in the hood, it's worse than it's ever been
Dear Lord, please protect me from the Devil
Itâ€™s these motherfuckas actin' like we friends but they hatin' me
Word to my mom, I won't let the game break me
Million Dollar Spot, I'll put the money where the breaks be
All up on the the block with my heart in...
Thank God I stay free: angel's prayer
