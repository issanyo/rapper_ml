[Intro]
Putcha hands in the air
Listen!
It's ya boy Lil B
Putcha hands in the AIR
It's a crazy world
Putcha hands in the AIR
We gon' make it
We gon' make it

[Verse 1]
Why my niggas hungry on the west side?
It's always been the west side
It's something like the best side
Why these young killas gettin' younger and then dyin'?
Fifteen and sixteen, runnin' with that iron
Why the hood is really like a jungle?
I'm lookin' through the Humvee like
"Where the fuck's my brothers?"
It's lookin' kinda ugly
Realize that who we are together is a unit
But once we divide it we lookin' stupid
Why we gotta buy Glock nines just to stay alive?
Bulletproof vests on, alert like a K-9
Murders in the hood go unsolved; why the fuck is that?
Why kill another man?
He got a mother and a dad
If you got a voice you gotta speak; bruh, I promise that
Can't nobody hear ya if
Don't nobody feel ya
All this worldwide crime shit gotta stop
And you gotta love the earth before yourself, one love

Putcha hands in the AIR
It's ya boy Lil B
I said
Left to right

[Verse 2]
Why I gotta get rich in silence?
Can't we all celebrate?
Why they gotta playa-hate?
Sayin' if I do it then you can do it better
I stay humble knowin' that the people are the blessin'
Without spreadin' knowledge, ain't nobody askin' questions
I looked her in the eyes; on her face there was a message
The lines on her forehead showin' she was stressin'
She said she couldn't take it - when she young she was molested
I told her, baby
(Open your heart and tell me what's wrong)
I told her that she told me this
Live your life and don't look back
Spreadin' love and understand that everyone is in the plan
Look at everybody's life like you put it in your hand
Watch 'em go and plant the seed
For the day we growin' tall
Live by the sayin' "if one fall, we all fall"
So if I die today by the weed smoke or gunshots
Just know I spread the peace for the whole world like 2Pac

(Outro)
Basedgod
It's all gon' get better
Short stories from a life story's life glory
I wanna
Let each and every one of you know
That we are the world
Hands up in the AIR
I said from RIGHT to left, LEFT to right
Freedom
I said we runnin' for the freedom
All of us, every day, we lookin' for the freedom
(And I've been waiting)
(For the angels to knock on my door)
(And I've been hoping)
Put your hands in the air if you lookin' for freedom, peace
(That everything could be like before)
All the fallen soldiers
Everybody that died for us
I do this for you
All you gotta do is speak up
And tell me something
Tell me what's wrong
And tell me something
Tell me what's wrong
