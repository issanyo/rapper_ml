[Intro]
They wonder why
I said I was the ocean, man, I told them, man
I don't know
I feel like, one of the prettiest alive, man
You know, check me out

[Verse 1]
Ask young girl, I make the pro's get wet
I be going hard in the scraper
The girls still love me, even in the scraper
No rims, slap tints, look at Darth Vader
Put that pussy down, girl, I'm finna be the mayor
Put the dick up in her, she let me run like I'm scared
Young boy, sick noise, coming through the cut
Blazing up a stick boy, fat blunts
Anybody have Swishers for the matches?
I got a bad bitch, I'm finna put her on the mattress
Big shit popping, and little shit rolling
See me in the Benz, no it ain't stolen
With big homie, what's up Lucas?
We gotta get this money, man, we gotta just do it

[Bridge]
Man, shouts out S.S., The Pack, once again
I said I was the ocean for a reason
It's because...
Something, just changes
Weather, it's amazing

[Verse 2]
Real live king, so I just spit rap
Wrap me up in plastic, and sell me in the sack
Cause I'm crack, ask them, never on the map
And I never did things that I wouldn't wanna rap
Cause the life that I live is real solid
The girls see me like, "B, you too solid"
I just seen her, and she love to give knowledge
And then I hazed her, like she went to a college
Knowledge
And I ain't tripping off your partners
She looking at me, like I'm finna win a Oscar
I'm looking like the moon, cause I'm out of your space
And you can't be my friend, this is not MySpace
Young masterful, on ice, too cold
Like ice, see me in the night, but you can't see me
The streets will leave you blind, like Stevie
And they wonder why your boy getting bread, like Wonder
Cause the sun make it rain, I'm the ocean and the thunder
I'm the volcano, and the lava sitting under
Boy, wash the dishes, boy, the rags is sitting under
And the rags turned to riches, so you really cleaning hundreds
I wouldn't wash the dishes, but my hands was cleaning something
And then I'll turn this up, because your [ ] was getting hungry
I went to the ocean, started floating on the ocean
And your boy think he smooth, but he really need lotion
And I don't gotta spit bars, I just spit facts
Yeah, I'm on another level, and I can't look back
Never look back, because the past is in your ass
So when I move forward, they just say I gassed

[Bridge]
Amazing, this is amazing
Rejoice to the ocean
God bless
S.S., Lil B
This is for the ladies to know that, I am the ocean
I'm in man
Tropical depths
Lil B, this is amazing
God bless
I'm at the, I'm at the Adeline Island
The Adeline Island, getaway
Spectacular special
For a special price
God bless him

[Outro x2]
Because I am, am the ocean
