[Intro]
There's a lot of thick bitches, I like skinny bitches
I like big fat girls
What do you mean?
Don't discriminate on anybody, I like all women
Boy what you talking 'bout?
Man I like girls that weight 250 pounds
Plus 400 pounds, even in the middle
I like a skinny ass, you feel me?
70 pounds, 120, fuck it
