[Verse 1]
Uh Merry Christmas, I almost forgot my wishlist
Enjoy wakin' up each morning, can't concentrate
Give 'em weight, that's the best thing for you
Loyal men and women it all starts from the beginnin'
Wrap my love with linen, no john in my heart
That's why I cry from sinnin'
This year passed by fast, it's a New York taxi cab
Niggas be layin' in grass to feel my deeper roots
Christmas time, ain't time for hatin'
No [?] but this year please no racist comments or judgements
Let's forget these faces
Come back to the table with graces
There's a feelin'
When you wake up each mornin' with no food on the plate
Celebrate each mornin'
Uh, life, class of the 1980s babies
Thinkin' back, I might be crazy
No stress
Pick and roll with the punches
Punch me I punch him
Fall asleep again during a battle
A lone warrior bushido blade on a Christmas day
Spend alone maybe
With a friend no family around
I do forgive
It's my fault, I used to be alone
And write rhymes and rap it to you over the mic
With no cash, in sight
I know, no money
I'm not money hungry, I love it
Merry Christmas with the snow on your windowsill
Payin' old debits and credit cards off
Layaway gifts
Still puttin', faith in God her son want new shoes
But this life is hard, Mama promise you'll get it
Work two years to pay off some jeans
So her son could have new clothes for the school year
Uh, he won't make more, he want a lil more
Mama thank you
When he older, he realized the blessin' that his mother passed on
Merry Xmas, Merry Christmas
