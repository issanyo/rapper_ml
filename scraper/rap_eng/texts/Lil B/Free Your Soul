[Intro]
Evil Red Flame. We getting towards the end, or maybe the beginning. This shit never stops

[Verse]
Niggas'll fuck around, but I can't respect it
What the fuck I want, feel like I'm falling short
Niggas look at me, easily write me off
My fake friends, true colors showing
Can't believe it, how many years these fuckers leeching
Tears coming from my eyes for no reason
Try to smoke away the pain
Reasons a man think I'm private jets
But I'm at my lowest point
Always seem to forget, I can never stop
I was meant to be famous
Spread my love around the world
It's all love in my heart
One day I'll get out of this hell
If I don't reach
If I don't get rich I'ma die trying
I love my momma, keep her wings flying
Bless the world and these fatal disasters
Going down as a world's giant
History nigga, Red Flame: Evil Version
I'm speaking in code
Just unlock it, free your soul

[Outro]
Evil Red Flame
This is Evil Red Flame
This is Evil Red Flame
This is not a game
