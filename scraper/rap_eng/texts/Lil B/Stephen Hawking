[Intro]
Oh my God, oh my God, Lil B
You got a lot of bitches, I know you do
We don't even got to ask that
But we need everybody to go crazy, everybody to go crazy
You know what we do, man
Like I said all the based boys in the building
Task Force, Bitch Mob in the building
All we do is, we keep it based, man, we keep it very based
Lil B, check this out, what you talking 'bout?

[Verse 1]
Still serve Jerry and I still serve blocks
Still calling shots like that boy Stephen Hawking
I could flex Maury, but I'd rather be Hawk
Plays from the top, might as well serve blocks
Still flexing ten, but the Jerry won't stop
How you flexing Maury, you ain't never heard of pops
I can't be your dad, but you can call me pops
I can sell Jerry, I can serve fifty
How I'm flexing hard in the Honda, no Bentley
Bitches suck my dick cause I'm still driving Honda
She never heard of Bentley
She fucked me in the Nissan
She fucking Muggsy Bogues
Call me Reggie Miller
Tim Duncan groupies, flexing Reggie Miller
I'ma flex Maury, with that tiny shirt
Poke my chest out, I'ma fuck all these bitches
Teletubby swag, no homo, I got bitches

[Verse 2]
Selling Fetty Wap or I sell 'bout Jerry
Word around town Lil B selling Fetty
Teletubby swag, no homo, I got Jerry
Poke my chest out, and I'm still fucking bitches
Thrirty fucking thousand on the whip, that's vicious
Fifty-thousand dollars, I'm swagging, bitch I'm vicious
Riding in that Nissan, riding in that Honda
No homo bitch, I'm flexing Maury, no Grindr
Feel like D Honda
Bitches love the kid
Flexing thirty Maury
Whipping shit like Noah
All I do is swag, all I got that Folger's
Wake me up in the morning
Bitch she know 'bout Folger's
Riding through the city
Bitches thinking that I'm homeless
Dope, I need fucking dope!
Bitch I'm so dope but these hoes ain't taking 'bout it
Selling Fetty Wap, bitch you know nothing 'bout it
