[Intro]
Yes...
It's your boy Lil B
The "Halloween H20" mixtape

[Verse]
I can't escape uh everything that happen
I give a tone with this rapping
But I'm a stay here like tables and napkins
2012 still dropping classics
Niggas wanna talk, fuck that
Lil B history, all set off walk
Nobody knew that the car would last
Top of the world and it's filled with ash
Pray for the same, not fall for other gods
Pay attention to their eyes
Keep earth in my heart despite it's periods
Come the people look great the world is different
If you look different, be happy what you want with
Giving people power, see what they gonna sit
If they're gonna change the mix, lost, the chains and the miss
Get pain from the bricks, building houses on mountains
Did everything and still on counting
Can't be a judge and I won't be a felon
Who am I to judge, who am I to tell them?
It's change when you see that 45 to your melon
That same 45 slide ain't no telling
Honor, here, what we deserve, stay humble for life
Yeah bitch, and keep hope for earth, keep hope for birth
A new town on earth, yeah, the solutions work
Had a feeling that I gotta be based Halloween H20
Fuck the lames, yeah, and I still see traces
I feel no places, a home for me
Based God stay positive, so many suckers, don't forget how you gotta live
Man watch your back, 2 eyes on my neck, yeah
So I watch my back, Lil B music, loud, with the sound to the max
History and the voice on wax, all I gotta do is spit the facts
Life's like a movie, we all groovy
We are stars but who is shooting?
Who got your back, who respect your movement?
Open your mind and just listen to the music
Lil b spitting real, you got the blueprint
And he a fucking game salute, he change the world
Elevating this gangsta, Lil boss
