[Intro]
I'mma tell ya like this
I'mma tell ya like that (mmm)
I'mma tell ya like this
This the motherfuckin' trapped in BasedWorld, bitch!

Ay, man!
Ay, man!
This is for the real Bitch Mob
I'm talking 'bout this for the motherfucking Bitch Mob soldiers
I'm talking 'bout those motherfuckers that's ready to catch 30, 40 for the Bitch Mob

[Verse]
Trapped in BasedWorld
I'm still smoking dope
Hit 'em with the scope
I look like Al Capone
I look like Ted Bundy
I hate all killers
But I am a thriller
But I am for real-a
Fuck what you think
And fuck what you drank
Bitch Mob here, I bought... 40 girls
Bitch Mob, pretty boy, you don't know about that world
I'm down with 10 cases, that's a damn shame
Use your damn brain
Friends got you tapped
Can't take a nap
'Cause they sleepin' on your back

[Outro]
