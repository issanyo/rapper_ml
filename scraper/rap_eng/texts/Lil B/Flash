You Know we are going all the way nigga
We want everything in this bank, bitch
Ya feel me
What we do
Na bitch im talking about what we really do that Basedworld
We legends niggers we broke and rich at the same damn time

Now I'm back its official like asap, writing all day you think I use my backpack
Sleeping in the booth, got my pen and my nap-sack
I got the dope beats, where the fiends wait
For their peacemaker, bitch nigga wanna back back
If it ain't rap acts, more like street war
Show you
About three more
Ask them, niggas say im dope but its magic
How I consistently make hits with a passion
Even mick burn burn rappers like mattress
Niggers tries to sleep, man sleep on the mattress
Niggers talking all that shit, Wonder why you got your ass kicked
Pulling the mask down can't see though black tint
Makes sure niggers feel the pain
Make em past tense
Blowin' on grapes, got me stuck
Where my keys at
Niggas got beat so I’m asking where the keys at
The dope stay right and the reason like to see base
Make sure my face monotone with a smooth pace
I ain’t no sucker, hold my nuts where my cash at
Best friend’s right, bet my heart that’s the wrap bitch
Mama on top, I spit a sixth, safety flat
Niggas give me whips, I'ma bring you two keys back
Learn to mask my feelings in the projects, ask him
Two more questions, this action
Most niggas funny, but peace ain’t laughin'
God lookin' down like “children what happened”
The streets and the turf done raised more static
Optional package, start flashin'
The Glock touch your head, back like waxin
The shotty touch your chest, you flip back like aerobics
Kickstand, kick-flip, nigga when I showed it
Most niggas got it, but they can’t even hold it
Po-po give'em two strikes, it’s magic
I ain’t gonna say but y'all bitches is bastards niggas
I rip through that plastic
Too many haters, snitches wanna become a fashion
Ask no hoes for nothin', give'em some flashes
Bitch, actin' like a bastard
I flash. Flash, bitch. Flash. I go hard
Based God
