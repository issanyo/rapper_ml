Nasty ass hoes I like them girls that go and get it
Dancing in the club tell that bitch to keep strippin
Slide down the pole bitch think that I'm trickin
Call me cousin Skeeter I'll be back in a minute
You got an ATM bitch you need to keep dancing
Out in Atlanta we straight poppin bandz
Niggas keep talking I'm looking at bitches
Thick ass hoes, fat booty bitches
Bitch keep dancing, do you speak english
I need bad bitches to get real freaky
Work it like that, twerk it like that
Thick ass bitch, your booty on the map
