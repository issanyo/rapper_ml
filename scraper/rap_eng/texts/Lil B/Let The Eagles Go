6 Kiss

[Hook]
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
So free, so high
Oh by, I am so high
I am the sky, alright
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
So free, so high
Oh by, I am so high
I am the sky, alright

[Verse 1]
I smoke weed in the strangest places
Shout out to Lil' Wayne with the 'mazing graces
[?]
Until you put your nose and you smell that mution
[?]
And every time I buy one, it's so relaxing
[?]
Wiz Khalifa know about it, but it gets me blazing
Purple trees

[Hook]
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
Shouts out, my nigga, I see you
So free, so high
Oh by, I am so high
I am the sky, alright
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
So free, so high
Oh by, I am so high
I am the sky, alright

[Verse 2]
[?]
Every morning wake n' bake like it's Hell on Earth
[?]
Fire blunts in the day [?]
Plus the weed that I smoke represents my salary
[?]
This for my nerve and I smoke to release my words
[?]
I'm in the sky, bitch

[Hook]
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
So free, so high
Oh by, I am so high
I am the sky, alright
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
So free, so high
Oh by, I am so high
I am the sky, alright

[Outro]
[?]
Still ballin, nigga
Smoke the best weed, shouts out to Keyboard Kid
Let the eagles go
So free, so high
Oh by, I am so high
I am the sky, alright
