[Intro : Lil B talking]
Water is D.M.G
Produced by Lil B
This the realest shit I...
Like I said it's produced by your boy Lil B
We in this thing
Holla at me
Worldwide

[Verse 1 : Lil B]
I'll always think about my life till the last drop
Most of my homies found dead we don't ask cops
Last time I cop, I cop the court room the only damn show I would not show
I keep my pride under the sheets
And people love my money they ain't thuggin with me
I make em look dumb, for tryna look hard
The paper that you're feelin lookin like a rookie card
Home defense
So ocean view
You don't swim like you're supposed to
Keep the gat handle like the black candle
You say you bout life but you cannot handle
I came off the streets like the military
Tryna save these kids you ain't gotta feel me
Last time I lost, I will not lose
Beefin in the streets thats what the slaves supposed to
Writin out rules like Abe-Lincoln
Id sink em, close range, grim reaper
Protect what I gotta protect
Bitches see me in the streets we where binoculars at
I never will rat
Exposed to hard times thats no fact
Evading shot guns I did not run
30 on 1 niggas problem this is not fun
What' I do for this hate
The gun like the Mike put the metal to his face
Keep the metal by my waist
Start to sound like..just the metal with the base
Gotta give a shoutout to Drake
Im riding through Oakland
Black mask days
Ah, and I told heat that heat look like Shaquille from Nine-Three
Breaking backboards
Slanging off the weed and servin em like an escort
And sayin Jail is in the near future
I got big plans so Im not to shoot it
Don't wanna run but they got the ruler
And my eyes green
The Mirror told me at night
I gotta plan I ain't no lame ass sucka
Bring hell to the suckers I ride or die and I don't fuck with these busters

[Talking : Lil B]
Damn, I let you bleed
And they gotta be different
And I don't even fuck with em
I don't even fuck with em you feel me?

[Verse 2 : Lil B]
18-19 I was never happy
Mom smoked the cigarette she was doing hair
Ghetto like the braids at.. and the beads that she wear
Put the match with the lighter
I keep on living and it seems to get higher
I got a lot of respect like a firefighter
Im worldwide wouldn't even lie
Sittin backseat in the Maybase
I don't never drive
Maybach with the strap in the back
Feel good to know Lil B run rap
