Look how good I look, man, it's Lil B
Yeah, aye check this
My nigga told me if I ever stop rappin'
The game lost Jordan, trade him to the Magic
Exhibit Based, not Exhibit C
You niggas couldn't see, let me part the sea
Part a part of me, nothing pardons me
You niggas arguably is worse than me
Get your whole squad, let me go hearse your team
Pop bullets in his back make him work his knees
This is sick I'm on top now
I remember in the hood I was locked down Oakland, Yosemite
Havin YA dreams appearing right ahead of me
Now Im getting glad that you niggas ain't ahead of me
And you'll never be forgetting me
Like a hard drive man it's all about the memory
Strapped with a vest screaming' muthafuck my enemies
Have em moving like a centipede
I'm the weed-man so you know I got the remedy
Plus I'm a user, dope-fiend music
Plus I'm a robber and I dare you suckas push me
Got the same pistol that they shootin'

I'M TOO NICE, I'M THE RAWREST RAPPER
