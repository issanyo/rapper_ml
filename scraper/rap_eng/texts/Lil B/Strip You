[Hook] x4
I'm gon' strip you, like a fuckin' mark
Like a-like a fuckin' mark

[Verse 1]
I'mma strip a sucka like that
Keep it real, I don't play it like that
I'm on the other side, nigga fuck that
I'm on that gutter shit, nigga fuck that
Burn 'em like, nigga eat that
Knock 'em out, go to sleep dad
Please, niggas can't see me
Short nigga, but my dick tall, believe me
I don't gotta rap with the punchline
Niggas get slapped on the front line
Ridin' 'round through West Berkley
Brodie got stripped on the bus line
I don't gotta rap with the punchlines
Brodie, motherfuck the one-times
This is for my street
That's slappin' and jackin' niggas

[Hook] x4

[Verse 2]
RIP my Brodie got killed
RIP my Brodie got killed
RIP my Brodie got killed
Fuck them suckas, that's how I feel
Real Bay nigga, I don't pop molly
I sell dope, distorted niggas with the Tommy
Niggas get scared of that street shit
I'm from the gutter, ain't no rules, bitch
West Oakland, play with the kid now
East Oakland, assault with a deadly weapon
Brodie got a motherfuckin' cat pill
Damn, nigga, that's how you feel?
Niggas get set up
Got mack rounds, smokin' big blunts
Bitches love the street niggas
That act crazy, ho you stupid, I'm [?]

[Break]
Aye bitch, aye bruh
Aye bitch, aye bro
Tell the bitch she need to fuckin' do Based God brodie
She needs to fuck the Based God
