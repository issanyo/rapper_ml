[Intro]
This is great, um
Looking down this hallway, uh
I need somebody to go fetch me some of my paperwork real fast
Gotta sign some new laws and uh
Talk to task force about some more protection
Lil B based world for life
You know we taking it all the way
From the left side to the right side
And the backside
Yo Washington DC what it do
Yeah
Its that Obama BasedGod mixtape

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you what goes on on my block
People lying everyday, its no love for us
People saying fuck cops but its really fuck you
Finna kill a nigga but you won't ride through
That's pussy ass shit that keep me confused
I keep my head in the news but choose my own path
Look him in the eye, they got mad I bought that
Fuck that, fuck rap, get your life together
This ain't no movie script, I ain't gotta cut nobody
I'm too blessed for that
Ya rock with the devil, I got my gun for that
Twenty years later bitch
I got my son for that
So you can't hate me, it won't hold me back
I got a promise to myself I won't fuck with rats
I only fuck with cats
(?) lion in the jungle back
I run rap
Lil B yeah

[Bridge]
Do doo doo do do doo
Man I just signed this one law over yesterday man
About the swag man, the world

[Verse 2]
Its like Jumanji, I'm playing a game
Still can't believe I did a song with Lil Wayne
And I'm still unsigned, running the game
I only love people with nothing to gain
Pull the scope back bitch like its nothing to aim
Keep it straight forward, simple and plain
People playing games, just not the game
I gotta take a propane, I won't complain
Set myself afire, I'm hot as lighters
Wanna meet Lil B? Can't get no higher
Wanna be based? Can't get no flyer
I got young money, like my nigga Tyga
Pop bullets in your dome, you ain't no rider
Bitch and this my write up
Hundred thousand dollar show, Lil B the best
Rawest rapper alive, you ain't gotta guess
Lil Boss

[Outro]
Do doo do do doo
Obama BasedGod, what it do
Mixtape, yeah killing the streets
Its Lil B
