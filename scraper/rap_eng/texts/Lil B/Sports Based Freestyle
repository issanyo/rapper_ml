[Intro]
Yessss
All you gotta do is relax, sit back
Let me tell a little story

[Verse 1]
I used to love sports, baseball and basketball
Actually I lied, I hated baseball
I loved basketball and football
Running track
Yes sir, run it back
All day sports was the best thing
Madden 09 the best game
I even loved FIFA, soccer
And a little bit of hockey
Cause it knocked you off
Yeah, and they skated on ice
They been had ice before the ice
And I love to play rugby
I never played but I love to watch it
I just lied again, I love rugby
They tackle hard
With no pads on, you gotta respect it
Gotta respect 'em
Get that message, yeah
?
Arena football, yeah that's some beastie shit

[?]
What's past is history
I'll never wish ?

[Verse 2]
I love sports, watching them
Oh my god, I'ma buy tickets for my mama
I'ma get on HD and watch that shit
Watch a boy get smacked, tackled over the bitch
Loss some yardage, you gonna make it
Pass off, like Troy Aikman
I don't know if they feel it man
I watched LeBron James, that boy just killed it
He just dunked on 'em, yeah
Yao Ming, he just dunked on him
Boy, everyday he just dunked on him
Swear to God the NBA is so crazy
Cause boys is so hungry everyday
They dunking on 'em everyday
It's like what the fuck he doing
He wanna do it and get paid
Some niggas sit up on the bench
I never sit on the bench, I'm hungry boy

Huh, yeah
So hungry in this thang
So hungry in this thang
Yeah, sports all day
So hungry in this thang
So hungry in this thang
So hungry in this thang
Man, fucking sports all day

[?]
It seems impossible
But stranger thoughts come through

[Outro]
It's your boy Lil B
Based freestyle
I know it's crazy how I do this
The strangest thoughts will be from the boss
