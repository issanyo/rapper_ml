[Intro]
Spit it to me one time
One time at the sunrise
It's okay
Time is so crazy
Time is blue, time is you, time is us
Lil B for Lil Boss
Yes
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Berkeley stand up
Time is blue
Ya feel me?
Time is you, time is me, time is new
It's time to get this cheddar
Lil B for Lil Boss
Check me out
Uh, yeah


[Verse 1]
Time passes by, but the music stays with
Who's seen God? Can't believe him stationed
So cool, like a drop of water
Fountain of Youth, where they bless my daughter
Couldn't wait for the sake just to see tomorrow
Life transparent, the beat is hollow
Rather lead than follow, proceed in honor
Yes, time blue like a freshman collar
Private school, I'm making dollars
Teach my knowledge from the streets of scholars
Yeah, and that shit's amazing
How we plan our whole life just to run through mazes
Please sit down, cause the seats amazing
No more pain, no more phases
And just ask my sis, time flow like water
Blue time exist, yo

[Hook 1]
Blue time, blue time
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
It's blue time, blue time
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, ye
It's blue time, blue time
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Yes, blue ti- blue time
Here we go

[Verse 2]
Rather spending money on the peace of mind
Life too fabricated like your [?]
One more quote, he who lies
Look yourself in the mirror with those squintin' eyes
He can't really picture life on a different tide
Daylight save on a different time
Asking God, "why me? My mission's fine"
No mistake, can't nobody kiss the God
Pass that blunt, is is just a facade?
When I look up in the sky, can I just menage?
Two clouds when the mist is hazy
But it's two up in the sky that produce a baby
That represents time, the cycle cautious
Hate home when you gotta talk them losses
No objects, but the gift is gorgeous
Time don't fly, time be soarin', ye

[Hook 2]

Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, time's blue, time's blue, yao
Time's blue, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Time's blue, time's blue
It's Lil B for Lil-
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Time's blue, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
One more time, time
Is so blue
