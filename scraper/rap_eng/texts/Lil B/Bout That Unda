[Intro]
When you a hunnid, you can't stand for that bullshit
You know what I'm sayin? I'm thugged out pissed off
It is what it is, You know what I'm sayin?
It's ya boy, lil b, everytime that you hear my voice, you know it's forreal, You know what I'm sayin? every time that you see me, you know it's real. One of a kind, check this out, real pain from the streets

[Verse]
I came out the hood with that sour taste
I relate to dope fiends and throwaways
I relate to 'em homies that pay dues
I put hands on niggas and I don't take nothin'
Them crackers tried to take my mom whoadie
Them crackers outcha fuckin' niggas with that tom whoadie
I'm outcha and bitch I eat
Grown man shit, pushin' 33
I got bitches and I got killas
No homo, I got niggas
And no homo, I'm blowin' sacks
I never paid for the smother, that's a fact

[Hook]
I bust a cracker head, whoadie
I'm bout that unda, and you scared whoadie
I've seen smother and I've seen unda
I love lovin' live and I love numbers
I bust a cracker head, whoadie
I'm bout that unda, and you scared whoadie
I've seen smother and I've seen unda
I love lovin' live and I love numbers
