(Intro: Lil B)
Is this real? Is this Life? A lot of brothers be- It's your boy Lil B, 05 fuck 'em, Is this real? Is this Life? (We all going through it) Shouts out to all my homies, everybody, all the beautiful people that's vibing with me, (We all going through the same thing) Just take a time to relax to this. Is this real, Is this life? (It's a beautiful, beautiful life), Lil B

(Verse 1: Lil B)
I want to give a shoutout to all my real niggas left
My old crowd of friends sm- all that sh-
Niggas in Richmond, Niggas in Berkeley
My Oakland niggas died and that's shit's fucking crazy
R.I.P

(Hook)
Is this real? Is this life?
Is this real? Is this life?
Is this real? Is this life?

(Verse 2: Lil B)
I used to have beef, and niggas tried to beat me with a bat
Ran for my fucking life, I didn't want to die like that
Because I didn't snitch, I took beef that wasn't mine
Used to be a follower, now I opened up my eyes

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Lil B)
My friend, thought I set him up
Bruh, I never set you up
Niggas came in your car, and they took what they want
Because I knew you both, I was dumb and I didn't snitch
Keep it real bro, I never hit that lick
You my friend

(Hook)

(Verse 4: Lil B)
Asking, why me, why so much pain
I was born into life
Shit is so crazy
Lord, Jesus, I got thing I ain't spoke about
Please give me strength so the words can come out my mouth
I'm hurting
