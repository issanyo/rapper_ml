[Verse 1: Siri]
All these apps and we [?]
[?] in person, call it acid reflex
No stress
[?] from all these boxes
Connect through a text
Find something troubling
Sweet from the fruits of your mind
For the labor of me
You say you're scared to connect
So you [?] online
But baby it’s alright
It's juts for one night

[Chorus: Siri]
Cause there's all these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
You say you wanna come over
So baby come on and slide
But if you wanna come in my house
You gotta turn your phone off outside
I’m not here for the drama
So put that shit on silent
And if somebody call it, you better deny it
Cause there's all these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Yeah I wanna make me a phone call
But there's no service when you on the wall
She be like "What you doing, doing?
Shit I'm in the wild west shooting me a movie
And we gotta do it
Ride around the Bay and we going stupid
I'm really on my phone tryna make a song
But we gotta write it out before we go home
Gotta make amends before we making M's
All my text messages blowing in the wind
Hear me out, you gotta hear me out
Got the new iPhone, I ain't going out
Ayy, why you got your phone locked?
You know I ain't tripping, I ain’t called the cops
I-I-I-I-I
Put your phones in the sky

[Chorus: Siri]
Cause there’s all these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
You say you wanna come over
So baby come on and slide
But if you wanna come in my house
You gotta turn your phone off outside
I'm not here for the drama
So put that shit on silent
And if somebody call it, you better deny it
Cause there’s all these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
All these apps and we [?]
