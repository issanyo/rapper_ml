Disco dancing with the lights down low
Beats are pumping on my stereo
Neighbor's banging on the bathroom wall
He's saying 'Crank the bass, I gotta get some more'
Water's running in the wrong direction
Got a feeling it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's going on inside my mind

Don't know what is pushing me higher
It's the static from the floor below
And then it drops
And catches like fire
And it's a sound I, it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
Into to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the 'lectric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and round
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground

Chain reaction running through my veins
Pumps the bass line up into my brains
Screws my mind until I lose control
And when the building rocks I know it's got my soul

Water's running in the wrong direction
Got a feeling it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's going on inside my mind
Don't know what, is pushing me higher
It's the static from the floor below
And then it drops
And catches like fire
And it's a sound I, and it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
Into the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Into the 'lectric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beats goes around and round
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground
And when the building rocks I know it's got my soul
