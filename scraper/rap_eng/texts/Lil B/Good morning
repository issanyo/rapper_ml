(intro)
Yes good morning
Had to wake up man
Reality
Shouts out to kanye west
Good morning
Its little bars

(Verse 1)
Good morning, the news cast is so bright
Im looking at my life
Bright days and cold nights
Please wake up like Im raising the death
I move way to smooth they couldn't trace my steps
Walking through the game like Im tracing steps
You ain't heard of Lil B
Man that dudes the best
Summertime pea coat with the 2 to stretch
Good morning this is life not cps
Went to the drug store not CVS
Been running long shows like PBS
With the world on my back you don't see me stress
No cloths on my eyes you don't see me guess
Man they said they made an vaccine for HIV
When they cure aids that will be the day I see
You can lay on your bed but the game not sleep
Im not based today that's the day I bleed
Good morning

If im not based today that's the day I bleed
So im based forever
I need ya to put your hands up
Good morning

(Verse 2)
First time I went to the jewelry
Envisioned myself and slick da ruler
I bought a few things cause my gifts is cooler
Plus I got straight ice like im in the cooler
Took long 4'5
That was if it was a ruler
With ten on the tip and the bottom is straight
My whole life like a movie
I could model the place
I could sell a few things but this my space good morning

You feel me, its like my life just changed after that
Onnce I woke up and I was like good morning
Things ain't ever been the same
You know what I mean
Its been so crazy
My name lil b
Check me out

(Verse 3)
Had to wake myself up cause still think im asleep
Couldn't write this whole book
I couldn't spit that heat
Fools talk a lot of game but he ain't that street
Im street like the concrete thats under your feet
Streets see alot of things so I talk to curves
I might say nothing back cause im at lost for words
Rap time grind time spitting nouns and verbs
Used to be on the block pitching two to six
Now im on t.v
Look at that pretty bitch
Lil B for Lil Boss make that semi spit
Call up old man say I need that flocka
Even if that nigga blind bet he see that choppa
Im the freshest nigga out cause im a season shopper
A bid like poppa supreme colossal
Only thing I haven't did is went platinum
Man im dying for this shit man
My life is platinum
I ain't talking bout the ice on my wrist that's flashing
And no I don't have a job and you a bitch for asking
Don't ask where I been like im missing in action
Dead bodies on the floor that's a big distraction
6'9 long range make you blow his back and
Say you wanna go to hell, let you hold this ratchet
Like mike im fresh with that golden jacket
Serve feens now they looking like thriller packing

(REapet 1x)
Man they eyes roll back with that drove wind coke good moring man im dope as bloat

Good morning
