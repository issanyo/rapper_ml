[Intro]
Sit back and relax
It's your boy, Lil B
Welcome to the West Coast, you feel me?
Welcome to the west side
This is that Based world music
This is that Based music everybody can talk about
Shouts out to Reno and Las Vegas

[Verse 1]
Statistics say I ain't gon live to see past 30
Things on my mind, a few seen the coffin early
Internet like trash, human race is dirty
Ask me if I give a fuck about a life sentence
Most rappers use that quote as their life sentence
Now the judge gives them time plus the five digits
Could have been the next doctor, anything proper
Most people love war and they hate scores
At the top of the game and the plate is yours
In the water in them jaws, internet claws
Plus I'm banned like tiger balm
Word is bond, nigga, fight club, base god
All I do is live life and see correct
Write my whole brain down, my thoughts are stripped
I live for bliss, find the karma, gotta shoot a flick
I love my life

[Verse 2]
Going to respect my mind
Going to respect my mind
Yeah, hello, you're going to respect my mind
Listen, you're going to respect my mind
You're going to respect my mind
You're going to respect my mind
I'm going to respect my mind
Mister, you're going to respect my mind

[Outro]
Like I said, so with this Angels Exodus, I just want y'all to sit back
This is the part where you should be lighting up, listening to these West Coast sounds right now
This is something that you can only get in the Bay Area
This is something you can only get out west, you feel me?
This that real swag right here
That real base
Lil B
I feel like I'm at a prom right now
Angels Exodus, I'm living my life, can't nobody tell me nothing
