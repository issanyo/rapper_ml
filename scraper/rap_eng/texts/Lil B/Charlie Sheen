[Intro]
(This should be played at high volume)
It's your boy Lil B, it's that new mixtape
Oh my god! Oh my god, I'm winning!
I'm winning, I'm rich now, I can't believe it!

[Hook]
Sheen, WINNING, swag!
Sheen, WINNING, swag!
Sheen, WINNING, swag!
Sheen, WINNING, swag!
Sheen, WINNING, swag!
Sheen, WINNING, swag!
Sheen, WINNING, woo!

[Verse]
5150, my bitch fuck with me
Damn I look good, nigga swag of the century
Damn I'm iced up and the girls fuck with me
Fuck a bitch face man I'm paying for some pussy
But I'm not no pussy, bitch I'm not a rookie
Nigga I'm swagged up and I'm powered up like Tookie
Don't gangbang but I fuck the bitch on deuces
Hollywood, sup bitch! Fuck you hatin hoes
Riding, do my thang, nigga, 60 for a show
Cause I'm the golden ho
The bitch knows wassup, paying just to fuck
Fucked her in the mouth and fuck her in the butt
Damn I'm swagged up! I'm playing and I'm working
I'm doing dumb shit I would've never dreamed of
Scuba diving trips, nigga, selling out arenas
Hoes call my phone I told the bitch: "Suck my penis"

[Hook]
