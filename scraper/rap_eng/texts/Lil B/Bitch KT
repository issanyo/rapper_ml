We sucking hoes pussy
Lemme know how it taste
Put the girl in the pot
And her pussy on the plate
Still OG and i still blow shape
You know what bitch?
I'll make your dreads shake
I'm not violent
But I had to catch a case
With the .454 and a out of state
Damn based god
You're a certified bitch

Clicked on a bitch
Hit it with the feather

Pussy like a gun

Money in the shoe box

Locked up doing crime
A dumb ass ?
Sipped so much lean

Got a lot of pride
Ask the girl if she want any
Btich you gotta respect it
I don't give a fuck
Cus the girl goin love it
I hold that mac
And i stay like 11
I'm in the midst
Of going to heaven
Only on defense
Pass that street shit

Until you gotta see shit
Stay with the clip
I stay with that reggie nigga
Lil B man
It's really hard to get me
