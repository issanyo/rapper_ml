[Verse 1]
I will never hurt you
I just want to love you
And why you always crying?
I think that she's lying
And you say that I'm special
And you know that I'm worth it
But you not worth the heart ache
And no you don't deserve me
No No No No

[Pre-Hook]
The heart ache
Emotional
The physical
It's so stressful

[Hook] (x4)
No you can't have me (x3)
You never gon' have me

[Pre-Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
I've been in this predicament
It's so hard to leave, when you say you love me
I hesitate, I'm all alone
You at home and you're all alone
You say you want to change
But I need the help
You all by yourself
It's like you're in jail
If you want to stay, hurt yourself
I need somebody else

[Hook] (x4)
