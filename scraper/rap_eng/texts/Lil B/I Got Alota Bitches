Shouts out to BitchMob
Let us bow our heads
I keep it up for being pretty
I stay pretty, 100% all day
I don't worry about what nobody says
I can be tiny pants thuggin', ski mask thuggin', heavy jeans thuggin', anything man
You know how we do: Fat skinny talk, big bod', everything man
We keep it real, man
BitchMob, to the day I bleed
BitchMob, I'm down for the bleed
Who down for the bleed? Who down with me?
