I represent for the people that want more
I represent for the people that hate war
Cold war every day niggas freezin silly
Desert Storm in the hood sniper rights are illy

Two shots to the body dunno why he shot me
No upbringing, no faith in God
No place in life he feel that he optionless
Opportunity positive to create this shit
Niggas treat me like God because I write the shit
Half of the real niggas would never speak on the life
That he live
Or rather die
With faith
With time
Cause a minute
Is gonna need you
And they think that war being over never stop it
Please move over
If you real then speak loud

Yeah loud cause the energym we need it now
Its all right for ammunitions, assault rifles
10 of em pounds casualites on the battle
I wear the medal of honor
Cold War
Itâ€™s Lil B Cold War Part Two
