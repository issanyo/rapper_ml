6 Kiss
6 Kiss mixtape
It's your boy Lil Boss
Real Plexxx

[Verse]
I've been spitting hard since the days of fifteen
Life been good and the nights is history
Came from the turf so you know I'm active
Put me in the trap house with the zips and mattress
And I'll double up, turn your zips to caches
Dope fiend party here, and the guests is ashes
Don't worry if I'm strapped, just know I'm stashing
Like you hard, just know I'm packing
Think about it, I'm clean as napkins
When I first got caught, it was the greed I'm having
You thought if you lied, you would win like Madden
Then run like Darren McFadden, this is not just rapping
Real Plexxx is when you pass off asses
When you catch him in the bar and you take his glasses
Thought I was a nerd 'til I showed them acid
Not talking 'bout the drug, but I left them gasping
Real Plexxx is when you not a coward
When you live your own life, and your dreams is power
Even though you're not fresh, I believe the shower
Any rap nigga want it, best believe I'll devour
Yeah, let's play the game of robbers
When your bro mask up and he hold them choppers
And you can't bitch out cause he know your mama
And mama didn't raise no bitch, we bring that drama
No goat, but I'll bring that llama
Put a nigga in the dirt like Mexican bombers
Yeah, that's puto loco
What you need, ese? Bitch, I need that coco
Been up two days and I'm off that robo
I don't wanna see the pigs, I don't fuck with popo
Dude asked me if I fuck with popo
That's like asking me if I'm a homo
Like two wrongs, that's a no-no
Can't stop, so I guess I'll go-go
And no I don't dance, but I get lap dances
I make her run court for the balls like Steve Francis
Yeah, yes, I'm the king
I got it tatted on my neck so your boss could see
Got it tatted on my throat so your bitch could see
Brangdang, just drip, so I been the sea
You're just sick, but I been diseased
Do your girl got milk? Cause I need the cheese
Plus stack away dope for the legal fees
Ho tried to sue me, that's the day they plead
Tried to fuck me, that's the day they bleed
But above that ignorant shit
I'm in the country club, with a bottle of juice
A bird in the glass, that's a bottle of Goose
Cost 35 G's just to get in the booth
Niggas praying to the god, cause they know I'm the truth
Mixing rap with reality, it's fact with the fiction
Act with precision, the MAC what I'm spitting
Take you ten years just to stack what I'm getting, young boy
Yeah, young bitch, man, 6 Kiss mixtape
Take that mask off, you can't rap what I'm living
Try to take that, send your back on a mission
Leave his head cracked with his face all missing
You don't even care, but your girl really miss him
Pay cash down for a show, just to kiss him
Get a little head, cause the game too consistent
No assisting, riding tints, I'm weeded
With mic I beat it, cause the case I beat it
And her face, I beaded, put my back against the wall
Best believe I squeeze it, like the drink
You niggas playing with Visas, I'm in Monticello
Feeling pure, eating pizza
Don't like rappers, don't like suckers
Don't like snitches, don't like busters
Spit a couple rhymes, cause my mind like a toaster
Get a little hot with the bread, I'll toast ya, nigga
