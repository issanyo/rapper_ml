[Intro]
Everything is now on the Internet
Lil B

[Verse 1]
The age of information
I grew up and never blew up
I'm knowin' one day I'll be the big dog
Colombian cocaine white
With lavish women surrounding me and in my carriage
The only time I call a chick now is Bloody Mary
It's in the mirror
I'm feelin' like I'm a champion, lookin' like I'm a mannequin
Cannabis residue is on my seat from breaking down again
I'm on computers
Profusely
Searching on the internet for answers, given to me
It's like I'm married, I'm watching the the bloggers heavily
TV is ran by money, how am I supposed to be?
The truth is near me, I can hear it and I can feel it
But are we dumbing down for technology and the cost of living?
I just forget it, continually smoking heavily
Thinkin' about the melody
Thinkin' of what's ahead of me
We comin' further than ever to live in space and
Somebody got the weapon that's controlling the human race

[Hook]
It's the age of information, the age of information
This is the age of information
Everything is on the Internet now
Data
Yes

[Verse 2]
My desktop is made to sedate me
Thinkin' illogically
On my laptop for hours like I'm in college, B
Honestly asking Google 'bout things that I should learn about
Can't even get lost in the navi
Inside, cell-phone overtaking
Got a car so never walkin'
They took away places where it's only the forest
I'm jogging in peace
I got my iPod slappin' these beats
I'm on a mission to find peace and precision
The cost of living is taxes and jail time without time to find your passion
I'm askin' the older people how you make it to your status
They laugh, because they see reflection while I'm askin' questions
And the best gift is to listen
Learn math to count your blessings
Used to catch a bus on AC transit, dark nights
Look like 20/20 lens-out of focus
Waitin' outside of stores
Askin' elders to buy Swishers and they come back with fifty cents
Now I'm buyin' liquor
MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter
Youtube often showing porno off to the average human being
I'm watchin' people in Japan naked G's from overseas
Chatroulette
I used to be on the corner where's drug connects
So pick, obviously
The information like art, it hurt the race
Because we judge before we classify
It's like a cage, human race has failed
Even though we in space we still hate ourselves
The age of information is hell

[Outro]
When I said that information has hurt the race
This age of information has hurt the race, and you know why
Because all we do is judge
All the movies, all the Internet, all we do is classify people
Now I feel the Internet has ruined the human race
Even though, you know, we can fly, and cars and technology has gotten better
I feel the the human race is not progressed as much as we should be
How come the human race isn't progressing as fast as technology has
Yeah, we gonna be staying on the moon
But there's still gonna be racists
So, in the end, are we really winning -- these nuclear bombs, nuclear war
What's going on
This is Lil B, The Age of Information 2010
