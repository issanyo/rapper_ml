Intro:

White flame, you fuck with me ima catch a case..
(im the number 1 bitch)

Verse 1:

Ask me bitch about the West Side woadie
3 got tha 40, ace got tha luger
Ask about Based God, I might bruise ya
Underground music nigga I don't wanna make it
I think I'm The Weeknd I'm posted in Toronto
New bentley coupe, don't think that I'm rich
I'm not a fuckin lick, I'll make you my bitch
Niggas in the hood think I'm flexin' & I'm gay
I'll make your bitch straight, I'll take her on a date
I interracial date and I fuck with other races (basedgod!)
(I love you, I love you, I love her!)
I set great examples, but girls love my penis
Damn based god ya got game like e-40
I texted e-40, & guess what he told me
"keep on grindin' get yo money lil homie"
Now I run the label, now my money stable
I pimp lil b cause that ho is my bitch
You touch my bitch again, then ya niggas might cry
I might tat that tear on my muthafuckin' eye
My cousin told me stop lettin' shit slide
Alotta young niggas run around gettin' high
Playin' with my safety man that's how you fuckin' die
Some people let you run, some people let you hide
I'm the type of guy that'll send you to the grave
I stay positive, but these niggas still hatin'
Don't run in my house cause I'll blow yo fuckin' brain
Out yo fuckin' ass cause you robbin' for that cash
Don't make excuses, you don't wanna do this
I stay flexin' new shit, errrythang new shit
Only o.g.'s I fuck with when I do shit
Young niggas die cause they don't understand
Don't fuck with a man that's been fucked over
Everybody know I got a chip on my shoulder
A boulder on my back and I feel like I'm in the 'Nolia
Bitches really love me, niggas really hate that
Have yo opinion, just don't fuckin' touch me
Goldhouse hustla only nigga with the house
Goldhouse building, that's how I'm feelin'
Basedworld records, that's how I'm feelin'
Girls talk about lil b, shh, I really owe em'
Errbody know I tote that mac if ya want it
My last name mac, so you know I keep tha 40
Call me Danny Glover, a plus hustla, a plus gangsta, a plus fucka
Nigga ask me if I still rep bitchmob
Imma fuck a lesbian, I'm a fuckin' exception
Nigga put that metal to ya head like an Excedrin
Everybody strugglin', you know I love strugglin'
Gold mask on I'll fuck a bitch butt-naked
With my smart hat on, I think I'm Thomas Edison
Hatin' on the basedgod, lay ya head down
Basedgod's naked, I still got the AK
I shit butt-naked with my gun in the bathroom
Uh bitch what the fuck, I'm Kris Humphries!

Nyeah, suck my dick bitch, nyeah!
You fucking bitch, nyeah
