[Intro]
I try so hard but you know we keep it gutter
How am I going to work with this shit you know what I’m saying
How I’m going to work with these problems
Because these thugs got pissed off Lil B

[Verse1]
I try so hard but these bitches be faking
Thug got pissed off you know I got the patients
Time to stay at the top floor I’m still at the bottom
Robbery sucker for the bags like it’s nothing hoe
I still get jealous fuck where my jella
I can't afford jordan’s so I stick up niggas
Bank lift rob crackers they already hate me
Last name is Dash but I don’t know stacy
These dope niggas got problem need to help them
The circle of death I see my people are selfish
I speak a lot but I got to take action on
Feeling like to hit the streets with love and passion
2pac rep thug life I’m repping that base hood
2B that’s family two many as me

[Verse2]
Thug life tanning and we way past envy
Just to make dollars without my soul been empty
Bitches elevate slowly think they fast
Trying to latch on a nigga bitch get my cash
No taxes bitches nothing you can pay me later
You don’t really love me you just love my papers
You want to fuck for these papers you a faggot bitch
I got counterfeit hundreds you can go shopping with it
I knock a bitch out I don't give a fuck about it
She trying to play me and I’m going to get something out of it
One time for my people who not conforming
Cloths dirty everyday I can’t afford no jordans
Bitches want to fuck do you got that stash
Bitches love me now my life is madness
I step my game up from a dime to a quarter
I turn a bad vibes into a cut of some water
I been had mine so I’m trying to go harder
Cocaine rocked up bitch life is fast
I don’t know about crack but I know about math
I know about burglary and I know about last
And I got it on my own and I rep myself
I always tried hard now I don’t need no help
It’s Lil Boss It’s Lil B thugs got pissed off
