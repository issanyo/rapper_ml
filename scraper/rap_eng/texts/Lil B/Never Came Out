Leave these rappers dead these niggas don't amaze me
I'm coming from the bottom the under niggas won't phase me
Niggas think my life sweet, bitch
You must be crazy
Got some muhfuckin nerve  to think you niggas made me
Nigga stuck with that shit that turned me shady
Theres murder on my mind i done see some devils lately
I won't act on it cuz i ain't a thug tho
I'm just a street brother with class i'm gettin buckso
You a street nigga, i watch em playing defense
This 30 round put em to sleep
You won't be breathing
I rap from my family, my momma, i got a reason
So if you suckas fuck wit me again, you plain even
Nigga not even , im more even than steven
Catch a young nigga im blind they call me stevie
Can't see a young nigga no more im like a racisct
The hollow tips straight to your brian its fuck faces
Never been a snitch, yes i duck cases
Playin in that life i bet you won't make it
This is for the bloggers that ain't gonna post my shit
You can suck my fuckin dick i'm rich you fuckin bitch
And i just lost my life for more than one time
I'm happy man im here sittin on the sunshine
Fake niggas soft and the real niggas is eatin
Just believe and go get it you definitely gonna achieve it
I know you thinkin i ain't gonna rob but nigga believe it
Gotta believe in yourself thats why u lookin to jesus
Why you lookin at me like dont paint a picture
You niggas dying in the hood and gettin money from strippers
Niggas be jack boys and run em even strip em
Bitch i got that Glock waiting to send to suckas to satan
6 feet off top bitch open this casket
Ima shut it in the grave and go piss up on your ashes
This is real pain only thing i can explain
Up bein in space i'm not saying no names
These young kids dont gotta follow the leader
Quit trinna be hard and go you'll be sleeping with god
And boy watch your back
Cuz your friends gonna turn on you thats a known fact
Pay attention
