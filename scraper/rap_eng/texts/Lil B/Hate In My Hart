[Intro]
Red Flame
Prove I'm the best in this rap game
Rawest rapper alive, nobody fucking with me

[Verse 1]
Ain't no real niggas hungrier than Lil Boss, guarantee
Anybody hate, I'ma knock 'em off
Stovetop, four-five, extended clip, fa'sho niggas gon die
Hate in my heart for the niggas that done wronged me
Prolonging, they hating, sucka nigga and they army
Five-six, yeah, nigga, I'm short but I'm cocky
My heart full of gold and my mind like Rocky
Ain't a person in the world who can stop me
Break 'em off quickly, the Red Flame make em all history
Growing up on Strict Street, but I came 7th street
Before I was rapping all was a numerous
Uh-huh, square niggas wouldn't mess with me
'Cause they know I'm cookin up niggas like recipes
Dont nobody background, nigga, go check for me
I ain't got nothing to hide but these bundles
Wolfpack Music Volume 1, let's rumble
I done killed niggas; never stop, ill nigga
Never compete with the best
Nigga, I am the best! Deal with it
Half you niggas is a fraction, my eyes red from the battles
I hate niggas

[Interlude]
Yeah, I hate niggas
I hate white people too nigga
I hate everybody, fuck everybody
Including every race, nigga, fuck 'em all!

[Verse 2]
Unh, nd niggas mad that I'm styling
I got gold in my soul, nigga fuck anautopilot
This ain't a reality show, but I got some content
That the presidents show
My niggas got dope to make the president stoked
Straight from Colombia, that's the president's coke
Red Flame is the anger from my heart and the pain
When I slept outside in the darkness of rain
Waking up the next day in the awkwardest pain
Bruh this ain't a game
If I could take back time, I wouldn't take back a day
Let me live forever
And make me feel like, nigga, we live together
Niggas hating on the world and they sin forever
Have the nerve to go to church and they killed your nigga
Have the nerve to claim peace but they pour the liquor
Rather cash ten grand to close the zipper
Uh-huh, I ain't finna play with you niggas
Nah
If I was alive and I played dead
Take this classic, best believe my words are magic
Red Flame, give a nigga real ultra-snapping
Rap game feeling, nigga
Felt the realest when I started rapping, nigga
I know I'm the realest ever since I started rapping

[Outro]
Red Flame, my nigga
Real gangsta
Lil B, nigga, rawest rapper alive
Give a fuck if you feel me
I give a fuck
