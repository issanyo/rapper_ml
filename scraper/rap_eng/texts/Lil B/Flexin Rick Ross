[Hook]
Word around town I fucked your bitch
Flexin Rick Ross, I'm that pretty bitch
Its the BasedGod (x4)

[Verse 1]
Flexing tiny shirts with a bag
Still selling Jerry and I'm still selling swag
Selling Fetty Wap and I sell Mike Jones
12 cellphones, the pretty bitch home
Still selling Jerry and I might got Maury
12 cellphones, fat bitches keep calling
I sell fat bitches and I sell off skinny
I fuck fat bitches and I still fuck skinny
I fuck fat bitches when I remix the work
I don't got bitches, I got a lot of perf
I fuck fat bitches, I don't get tired
I sell bitches and I flash on my bitches
BasedGod

[Verse 2]
Selling fat bitches and I remix skinny
Selling Fetty Wap you ain't never seen Fetty
Flexing Kurt Angle and I look like Nelly
10 cellphones, bitch you never met Nelly
You never met Wayne
You never met Pimp C
Never met Kanye
Never met Jay Z
Selling fat bitches and I sell off Jerry
Word around town bitch you never met Fetty
Still serving swag and I sell Jerry
10 cellphones bitch you never met Fetty
Flexing fat bitches and I sell off skinny
Beat up my bitches and I fuck fat bitches
