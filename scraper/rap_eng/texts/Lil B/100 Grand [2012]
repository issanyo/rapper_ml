[Intro]
Gonna stack that motivation
I know every real motherfucker could feel this one
You feel me?

[Hook]
Got cash on my mind but you don't understand
I come from the hood, I never seen 100 grand
Yeah!
I got cash on my mind but you don't understand
I come from the hood, I never seen 100 grand
(Never seen 100 grand)

(Thugged out, yea)

[Verse]
I get lick for this shit, push bricks for these shits
Feel weird for this shit, just to move crack quick
You getting old man, you sein all cash
Man you always work first and you get paid last
She hurt my soul cause her grandma still workin
If she get sick on her job, she gon lose her job
Right after age when you should retire
But she came cause her daughters and sons is tired
Yea, she got grandkids that she best stay over
And I ain't got a hundred mill, I am not day over
Shout out to Jay Z cause he got his family straight
My grandma better get that house from they
I get sick to my stomach, watch my mom not eat
For the last few mornings, you feel me?
And when you young, you don't even know that you broke
Don't care that you broke man, that's the gifts of life
The people say your shoes ain't cool like Mike's
They really hurt your heart when you're younger right
You gon see that light and you gon be alright
I guarantee you gon win that fight alright
You just take my lil advice
You gotta be nice and live your life

You feel me?
Dealt the hundred grands, you feel me?
Yea

[Hook]
Cash on my mind but you don't understand
I come from the hood, I never seen 100 grand
I got cash on my mind but you don't understand
I come from the hood, I never seen 100 grand

[Outro]
It's Lil B Glassface, yea
