[Intro]
They crazy. Hey listen to this story. Motherfuckers really be giving you that shit

[Verse 1]
I used to know this girl that be cheating on mad niggas she fucked with
Had no respect
Even though she looked pretty on the outside
She usually looks for the boat rides
She did...
To anybody and everybody that gave her a change
Out of 4 / 5 niggas at least one of 'em she gave him AIDS
Man this bitch is played I swear to God
And these niggas still wanna fuck her
I can't believe it, she walk around conceited
Like nothing happened
Bruh, this ain't just rapping
On everything man this really happened
Know they stressing cause nobody was getting tested
I had to tell you cause this bitch acting unfamiliar
Like they ain't knowing the whole time they didn't tell you
What the fuck you cheating sluts
But it ain't only girls, you dudes is fucked up

[Interlude]
I don't understand
And then give people that shit
Lil B

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you bout the dude that was having money
He grew with a family where he didn't worry
But for some reason he was scored as a child
His first girlfriend turned him out
And it got him sick
He caught something that he had forever
He never told nobody, not even his own mother
He started getting mad cause all the hate inside him
I don't know
And now he really getting suicidal
He in the Bentley but he sicker than the West Nile
The girls know it and they still fuck him
Take chances for the money fuck it
And now they thinking fuck it
Cause he got the [?] pretty at the end of discussion
Two years infected by the hunted women
Four years later died from em
Specific by the woman that he infected
God damn

[Outro]
Gotta be on point
Same one of the bitches that he infected end up killing his ass four years later
Lil B
