[Intro]
I'm the number one example
Of a real motha fucka
Ya feel me?
A great samaritan
Ya feel me?
Perfect American
Ya know what i'm sayin?
Raw 100% breeded killin them niggas

[Verse 1: Lil B]
In that bitch i play with
My cards on deck
I got a full house bitches
On top of bitches
Swishers and more bitches
Niggas hate for show
Bitches and bout riches
Niggas talk down, walk around
My gun that i got like black hawk down
The harder the eagle, people be saying shit
Just to say shit, feel me?
I split niggas up, when that case split
Niggas keep crying when that case split
I be acting all dangerous
I'ma show you about dangerous
I'ma show you pusises that you can't hang with
Yes this nigga is dangerous
James Bonds guns, yea i got the same shit
Same cars, same tits, different bitches
All my hoes mixed, playing bitches fuck
I stopped being a pimp
I started pimping myself
Ask the pimp of myself
My last names mack
That's a answer itself
Got an apple, ya feel me?
My nigga, it will answer itself
Got a car parked and it parks itself
Coke on the fucking top shelf
Niggas don't play
Bitch and don't ask me questions
I'm bagging up keys
Like Swizz Beats
Holla at me dog
I'm a rough ryder too
