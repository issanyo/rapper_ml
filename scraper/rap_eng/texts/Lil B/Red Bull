[Intro]
We need everybody to get to the dance floor right now. Wherever you at. Worldwide. Turn up if you on the beach. If you in the club or in the streets

[Chorus]
Make your body, make it go
Move your body, make it go
Everybody make it go, go, go, go

[Verse 1]
I don't give a fuck what you talking bout
Niggas from the Bay gon' turn it out
Soft ass niggas on autotune
Four bad bitches in one room
Thank you BasedGod I'll fuck your bitch
Brrr-anggg to the rannng I'm too sick
I don't give a fuck if I die now
Fake ass niggas don't cry now
Really I nut in a bitch mouth
[?]
Really bitch I don't give a fuck
For real bruh I don't give a fuck
(Really bitch I don't give a fuck)
(For real bruh I don't give a fuck)

[Chorus]
Make your body, make it go
Move your body, make it go
Everybody make it go, go, go, go
Go

[Verse 2]
When the day turn night I go in
Black on black with the dark skin
Really wanna go to the army
So I could pop a few pills with the homies
So I could up that [?] on any bitch
Hit a few licks and I get rich
Yeah if I got a few weapons
I'ma make a fucking bitch get naked
Pull the 30 out with the [?]
Buy my respect bitch let's win
Four black men in a Bentley Coup
Doing [?] for the woopty woop
[?] looking foofoo
You need to just blow up
Whip out this 30 with the doors up
Whip out this 30 and you go dumb

[Chorus]
Make your body, make it go
Move your body, make it go
Everybody make it go, go, go, go
