[Verse 1: Lil B]
Now baby come hold my hand
I wanna be your man
I wanna see you every night
I've been waiting all my life
I love you to the moon and the stars
Don't change who you are
You are the love of my life
We gon' be alright
I can show you all those things
Whatever money brings
Can you just be my wife?
And if I give you this ring
Can you promise me..
To love me until I die?

[Hook: Lil B]
I'm thinking bout getting married (All the pain and the sacrifice)
I'm thinking bout getting married (Of life and friendship)
I'm thinking bout getting married
I'm thinking bout getting married
I'm thinking bout getting married (The whole world ahead of us)
I'm thinking bout getting married (You and me girl)
I'm thinking bout getting married
I'm thinking bout getting married
I'm thinking bout getting married

[Verse 2: Lil B]
And everybody says what to do
Girl it's just me and you
I know your family thinks I'm wild
Last night I had a dream
It was just you and me
Girl I want you to have my child
And I'll take you to the moon and the stars
Don't change who you are
Let me know I'm worth your while
And if you take this diamond ring
That will change everything
I want you to be my wife, oh

I love you girl, and I hope you accept this
And I hope you stay mine forever
Now when I say, I wanna marry you
I hope you accept this

Just marry me (Listen to me)
Just marry me (I want you to)
Just marry me (I need you girl)
Just marry me (I love you)
Just marry me (It's dedication, all the pain and the love)
Just marry me (What do you think)
Just marry me (All our days)
Just marry me (Got a full life ahead)
Just marry me
Just marry me (I love you, girl)
