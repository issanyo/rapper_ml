[Lil B]
Yeah its your boy Lil B you namsayin kick back relax namsayin you know how I rock, pretty boy you namsayin? Got all the ladies goin' crazy I don't know why Im broke
Ha! you namsayin? Thousand air holla at me you feel me? Keep it real Imma chop it up spit game
Holla at me


[Verse 1 : Lil B]
Relaxation
He who walks his own path of greatness will never be ancient
This about survival, the jungle is humble and a field full of rivals
Who gotta make em bleed, and I ain't talkin about the cycle
Life's a motorcycle, who's fault when you fall off?
I choose to move at a pace
That keeps me on the pace, and keeps me off in space
Mamma mia, life's not always what you seein'
And it's really what you thinkin If you really want the trinket
Ask Young Bull, he was eatin' now he EATIN'
Now my waters gettin' pure from the visions that I'm seein'
Just believe

[Hook]
Blame it on the Based God, ya feel me?(x4)
Real(?) on the Based God, well ah huh (x4)

[Verse 2 : Lil B]
I can't even express what I want to in the messages
It's a life long test, no second guessin'
Ask Young Bull what he thought about the message
He told me it's a lesson and it ended in a question
A person taking care is a person with direction
I never second guess him, watchin' life as it test him
Told me it's a blessin', for emotion and reflection
Told him I ain't stressin', Ima get it when it's given
Told him Ima get it if it's credit or it's debit
I'll never sleep on it, man I rock when it's steady
Ask about Brandon, they'll tell you he a medic
He plan to save some lives in the future or the present
I'm ready

[Hook]
Blame it on the Based God, ya feel me?(x4)
Real(?) on the Based God, well ah huh (x4)

[Verse 3 : Lil B]
When you grindin hard, shit, ain't nothin like that 8 mile
Wishin' for that meal ticket, lookin for that eighty-thou
Say it then, and say it now, cause Im on that paper chase
With little buddy up in my heart, yesterday is yesterday
Why I puff that white smoke? My heart bleedin' from out my eyes
It's okay to let it out, I done see real gangstas cry
It's lyrical homicide, with no motive but doin nothin'
Make srue you love the earth, make sure you learnin' somethin'
Hit the gas, but never cruise, you can't win but never lose
Think about it, hits them, but no you
Slip them, but know you
I'll flip them and hold you
Ask Bull, Young Bull, Philadelphia what it do

[Hook]
Blame it on the Based God, ya feel me?(x4)
Real(?) on the Based God, well ah huh (x4)
