[Intro]
Based, Based, Based freestyle
You know we keeping that shit so lit man, keeping the mind free

[Verse]
We back on the dime piece
We back through the line, please
Check me out boy, I'm on the time -
This the time steez, this the two-time for the -
I got the - watch the -
The sun watching me while I'm looking at the top like who clocking with me?
Please stop me 'cause I'm coming so fast and I'm cocky
Niggas be rocky in the ring bitch
You better watch out coming with that cool clean shit
Like, drop that 44 mac round, send him back down, that boy laying back down
Like he went to sleep before, I tell you niggas go to sleep before
Come in bitch, you go to sleep at four
I come in and win, then you go to sleep some more you bitch
I tell you like this, I'mma ride on him with that-, and come with that-
I'mma tell you like this man I'm the shit
Lil B for Lil Boss man I'm ripping this shit
Like what you got to do I'm ripping this shit, bastards
So backwards, most of them actors, like why you rapping?
What you doing with the -? I'mma tell you like this man, you niggas just backwards
Shot out to my niggas I love you, you already know I love you, I fucks with you
And fuck them suckers, ride on them busters, don't fuck with them busters
Keep the chopper under covers, keep the chop in the winter, keep the chop in the summer
Keep the chop when I'm angy, keep the chop when I'm happy
I'mma have the chop when I 'm married
Niggas fuck with me, I'mma leave them buried
Underground six feet, buried
Run over 'em like Barry, fuck around with me I'll leave you scary
Lil B for Lil Boss, you can't compare me
Lil B for Lil Boss

[Outro]
I'mma tell you like this man, Based freestyle, you know we thousands tracks deep thousand
The counting to get to me, I don't think you can get to me
Do what you do, and I'm going to do what I do
51/50, I'mma tell you like 51 ugh
I'mma tell you who really sick, man we back on this Based freestyle shit
Back to getting real Based, letting the mind get in space
