[Intro: Lil B]
Ay, Romy what's next for you
You already know man, its your boy Lil B
And we all proud of you
Keep taking it to the next level
Do your thang
Don't let none of these suckers play with you
Ya dig
Its your boy Lil B man, ya
Lets get it

[Verse 1]
We are our own demons
And we make them on our own
Yeah we can only fight them
They are not our homes
Were are only hosted
Don't let ghosts around you
Demons are the same and
There the ones inside you
But only your to blame baby
Don't let them control you
I wouldn't let them do it to you
So why must you keep hurting you
I'm tired of the things you do
And I know I'm one to blame too
But I know I'm not insane, and I know its all meant to, what you know and what you learned is your brains a ticking time bomb
Which only you can diffuse, so
You are not your demons baby, you are only used
You're using yourself babe
Do you know what to do?
Well, get out of your head babe
Listen to me help you
I know its not easy baby, but once you do
You'll know
I wouldn't let them do it to you
