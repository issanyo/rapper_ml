Task force... bitchmob mixtape (yeah)
Real gangsta shit man
Fuck what ya heard you feel me?
If you a gangsta you be a gangsta, you feel me? if you a nerd then be a gangsta if you a gangsta be a nerd
Imma tell you like this man i serve every day cuz
I feel like im dope running
Dope running that real music bruh

[verse]
Im ready for the funk
Fuck what he say
Feel like NFL I had to drop the replay
Driving up pounds high siding on the freeway
Gettin so i high that ya boy couldn't see straight
Big bro cracked the pistol
So it far from the issue
The realest make you soft like the bottom of a tissue
Its utensils and beef
Taste the streets
I taste the streets
Everytime that i eat
This silence ain't right
Keep my heart in ensight
People dying every night
And that ain't never sounded tight
Im living in the jungle one move youre out of sight
Gotta meet at the steps in afterlife
In afterlife im watching over my back
Cause even though you even in the sky
You sold crack and died
I wouldn't be surpised
If you went back to hell
Imma protect Lil B because Task Force real, Bitchmob!

[interlude]

Niggas ain't fucking wit me on my worst day
You feel me ?
Yeah nigga this is what i do
If you ain't a gangsta bruh
Baby you a gangsta and you know it
You a gangsta to man and you know that shit dont play
You fucking with it
Task Force, Bitchmob!

[verse]
These niggas playin
Im on the corner blocking
These streets like soccer cause everybody watching
Alotta people see but nobody tellin
A certified felon my PO know the rest man
Last year i bought dope and I got hooked on it
My advice to you dont do drugs homie
At the bar station in east oakland watching the fireworks
People looking at my car and just shows you how god works
Keep ya prayer in the sky
Anyday could be death
I rap about it
Cause in the hood where i step
But a nigga never left because im closer than ever
I just tightened up my
And got my shit together
And im focused i got a scope on the dresser
People acting like my friends but they ain't going together
People acting like my friends but i watch yo bitch ass
And i can't fuck wit snitch ass keep it real
This life and times with Lil B I love my squad
You need an army just to deal with me
TASKFORCE BITCH!
