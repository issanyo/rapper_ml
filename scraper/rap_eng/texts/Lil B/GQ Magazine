Welcome to Red Flame
I know ya'll been waiting a long time since Blue Flame

[Verse 1; Lil B]
GQ Magazine, strapped with the magazine
Riding in the Lambo, blowing on Mary Jane
Thinking bout the next plan, keep my mind focused
Aiming for the stars shooting things in the open
US Open I'm posted watching tennis
Chick, country club, smooth coolin' with the bitches
While I stay wet cuz I'm cool with the fishes
No pussy over here, bitch it's money over here
GQ Magazine when you don't give a fuck
Claudy with ease and museums with the trees
Shouts out to S.Dot, international friends
We make it to the end, fucking bitches to the end
Why I love rap? Cuz my mom gotta eat
That's why I write verses and never go to sleep nigga

This Red Flame, something's..in my heart

[Hook]
GQ Magazine strapped with the beam
Shooting for the stars
Aiming for my dreams
Grinding all day, making moves all night
Uh, I'm strapped for my life

GQ Magazine strapped with the beam
Shooting for the stars
Aiming for my dreams
Grinding all day, making moves all night
GQ Mag cuz I'm strapped for my life

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Ok Lil B, you gotta stay focused
Uh huh, you gotta keep going
You been through worse man, your pain is your potion
Pain is to gain, calm like th ocean
People said I never could be the dude I'm hoping
They try to kill my dreams but my mind's motions
Never stop
Keep going
Your tire's on flat but you gotta keep rolling
I'm the first one to try new things
Spit all the game, solid core make a true king
By the way, go download that Blue Flame
Teach all the real niggas how to love their queens
I done heard some real things but I'm too ill
If you believe what I'm saying then you know I keep it real
Mo' money Mo' problems, that's before the deal
And I'm still in the hood, these other niggas scared

[Hook]
Uh huh strapped with the beam
Yeah
