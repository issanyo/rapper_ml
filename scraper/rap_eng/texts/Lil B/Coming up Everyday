[Intro]
We uptown, making love uptown
Soul in the music, there's love in the music

[Verse]
Yeah, I’m free again, I can see again
Now I see what I see in them
I can look past the words you breathing in
It's Lil Boss so don't breathe again
Let ’em sit back up in the office
Record label like the bets up in the chorus
Moving through life like a faucet, I'm drop dead gorgeous
How I move, cigar in my hand
When I crush the groove
I'm still looking like the lick, what you wanna do
Looking both ways
Shit I'm real comfortable
Nonchalant, I mention I'm a soldier
Every day [?] pull it up
I got the work in, you working up
I work it out, work with us
You got 100 blocks, 100 bucks
A diplomatic move
Got low self esteem but you living cool
So many fakes, what you wanna do about it
What you gon' do?
Money tied in, vision tied up
Fake friends moving in
All I fuckin' do is win
Sick as hell, sick of cells
Sick of my cellphone, sick of the cell
Slavery had me in the jail
[?]
Living a lie
Gotta live it up, surprise
I never planked
My life's on the edge, what the fuck you think?
Walking straight in the bank
Rapping from the bank
Living for the...
Young Boss, Lil Boss, Lil B for Lil Boss
Nigga fuck what it costs
