[Verse 1]
I gotta catch up and put my cards close
Ain't no telling [?] so shifty
Maybach got me feeling so Ken Griffy
Adding fuel to my burn got me so iffy
Can't see straight but really who with me?
Who against me?
Blood talking down because I'm short
My mind state leave your ass where you start
Now how the fuck you thought
I wouldn't come back with a vengeance
Maybach with the black tints
Sitting back like a...
You got real even
You see it but you can't really see 'em
I'm oh so different
I'm on a mission

[Chorus]
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission

[Verse 2]
Sonic the [?] like Charles Hamilton
Giving props to my man again
[?] again
Thundercat way back when
Real instruments, black Benz
Rolls Royce, I'm right there with the Mac 10s
Short man complex begins
And I'm in it
For real my life is complex
How you see that my life is so obvious
It's never been that
38 levels I be thinking
Shout out to Clams, Keyboard Kid
I'm really doing it
This is just my movement

[Chorus]
I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission

[Outro]
All my folks keep your head up
Keep living it up
Keep doing your thing
Building it up from the start
Top the the bottom, all in the middle
Keep it up, keep doing your thing
Keep living it up
Thank you BasedGod for the beat
Yeah
[?] today
Real talk
We living it up

Options mixtape
I'll see you on the other side
Yeah
