Changing every day, man
Changing every day

2012

[Verse 1]
Uh, Why I feel so bad
Why I'm walking down the street
Why I feel so sad
But the day is so bright, a faze
Something is in my mind
It's like a daze
I hop on the bus, AC transit
Sit back of the bus
Where the party's crackin
Smoke a little weed
Bump some tunes
Hit my n--ga's house
You know, we posted in the room
Baggin up, but I'm not dope dealer
I'm-uh-just your neighborhood Robin Hood
Give it to the poor and give to the rich
Stay patient for my life
Work too much
Keep it real
I put that on my d--ck
Life too cold
But Life is awesome
Can't see through the fog
My headlights is useless
Stay down for my life

[Chorus]
Everyday, just black and white
My dream so far
Money don't change shit
Just a new car

Everyday, just black or white
My day dream seems so far
Money don't change shit
Just a new car

[Verse 2]
Spend your money wise
My Nigerian uncle told me
If you get you wife
Stay away from the hoes
Cause they bleed you dry, drier than the desert
My nigga doing life behind bars and he get it
Refuse to be a part
Parking tickets
Got me locked up
Never arraigned a prison
But, again, we working for a bigger picture
Something outside earth, we see it
Think about it
What's life to an ant?
What's life to a cat?
We all alive
The grass, the comets, the earth taking shit
Toxic waste, earthquakes
When the earth had too much to drink--
That's a cool thought
I be drifting off
Got to go back to worth
Don't piss the boss
Black or white, it's color
Of life picture
Let the rain come down
While you listen to it
The sun come out when you wake up
This is the sign you made it
Another daze
It's beautiful

One time for the world
Shouts out to Jay Electronica
This is Lil B

[Chorus]
Everyday, just black and white
My day dream seems so far
Money don't change shit
Just a new car

Everyday, just black and white
My day dream seems so far
Money don't change shit
Just a new car

Everyday, just black and white
My day dream seems so far
Money don't change shit
Just a new car
