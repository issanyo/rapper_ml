Yea, I know that you're slangin packs
I'm gonna serve a lick and I'm thinkin bout takin that
And I ain't gon lie, the plug damn near them
Finna meet him at one, shit the game no fun
Brah came with the work man, I came with the gun
He came with the gun but he left in the trunk
Told him chill for a sec, let's roll up a blunt
Got base, I got cash so I know wutchu want
Started talkin bout life, keepin shit up front
Man, the lighter, spark this up
Man, this shit good, what the fuck man?
Pass it to the boy and he hit that boy good
Purple smoke kush and urkel, lean back
And then I hit him with the blue jack, he leaned back
Couple watched the scene at
Now I'm thinkin what the fuck, how I'm gonna leave that?
He take that, I guess I'll be cleaning that
Pick dude up stankin, people still talkin
I moving cautious, about one in the morning
Look what I started, I guess I'm so heartless
The way I'm door to door, you would think that I'm mormon
Let's get back to the performance, put his body in the car
Put the drugs in mine, drove it a couple miles
I got some shit outside
People waving at me, happy, ain't even trippin
Parked the car on the street, left it limpin
Like fuck that, catch a cab or something
Gotta walk that trail, where the nearest gas station?
I'm too thirsty, this '76 – that's straight for me
No guilt on me cause the dope was free
Got a capri-sun, asked if he can call me a cab
I left my phone in my car, took the wallet and cash
Pay him dude, now I'm waiting for the cab
Cab driver pull up, I just gave him the cash
Told him go fast and don't drag
Police pass on the other side, for a homicide
You pass by the car where the body died
Somehow somebody seen inside when I was ridin
So we still drivin, getting a little closer
Police show up, my heart folded, stomach up in my chest
I started sweatin, lights, camera, drive another stop
Guns pulled on him in the fuckin drop
One thing I ain't leave was the mac that I bought
Let them things out the window and I'm sprayin off shots
Cab driver run out, I move up to the front
I ain't like this shit and it ain't never be done
Once man spark the blunt – James Bond the Robber
Smoking that bitch with a motherfuckin choppa

Lil Boss

Here you go
Let them take the shots man
Because we pulled into the fullest extend
Fuck it, I'm going out the gang

Yes
