[Intro]

Man I tell you like this man it's your boy Lil B
Coming through this motherfucker 30 thousand 100 thousand you feel me 30 thousand 100 million
Tell you we got bad bitches in this motherfucker mane
10 thousand on one side, 20 thousand on the left side
Pretty boy's in this bitch

[Hook]

Bitch shake that ass on my dick woo woo swag (x8)

[Verse 1]

Bitch it's Red Flame and you know that I'm hustlin'
Bitches on my dick and I still fuck their cousins
Like Soulja Boy had that West Side struggle
Bitch shake that ass cause the team got money
Come in the club with about nine hundred
Left out the club with way more money
Girl is a freak I can see it in her eye
Young Based God bought the bitch like a pie

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Bitch so exquisite, rich game hit list
Young Based God fucked a bitch on Christmas
Left hand stripper, ice chain naked
Iced out ear ring, 10G bracelet
30 on my dick cuz I'm still in the Matrix
Bitch eleven thirty, Randy Moss jersey
10 carat ring bitch my carats on thursday
Feed my bitch broccoli, pinky ring cocky
Keeping ten hoes weighed down like Rocky
56 ear ring, 30 carat bracelet
56 hoes on my dick and they naked
Young Based God like Hugh Hefner
Young Based God is a young Oprah Winfrey
Young Based God got the K with the semi
Nigga fuck with me I'mma act like a boss
Infra-red beam bitch I'm paying what it costs

[Hook]
