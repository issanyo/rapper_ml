It feels good that I made Red Flame
I just inducted myself into the Hall of Fame of rap
Shouts out to Jay-Z, AZ, Nas, Cormega
Now I'm a part of the greatest rappers alive
Goddamn, it feels good to be Based God..
Feels good to be base

(Shouts out my nigga Wiz Khalifa)

I was a young money blower
Tailored suit made up
Came out the dice game
Cold craps, green and red
Nigga give me my money - I'm too old to be playing games
I'm too smart to be saying names
Lesson learned cause I played the game
Niggas come correct
Under moss, til I gained respect
Fuck around niggas
They kill, dressed up like you were me
They murk ya ass for free
Don't even pay a fee
Jealousy, I done seen it firsthand
It could turn you to a bitch
You don't even need a first glance
Keep your head down, this is real life, bitch
Let me watch myself, nigga, I am not a pimp

If I died would you give a shit?
I'm riding tinted up
Presidential style
Came a long way from city bus
Residential style
Dare you to take it from me
My faith in God, nigga, fuck the money

Lil B! Ya feel me?
Real niggas in this thing, bitch
Would you give a fuck, nigga, if I'm not rich?
It feels good to be the rawest and the realest
Best mixtape out since I don't know what

Never forget the past
Never forget yourself
Never forget the grind
Never forget your health
Never forget the wars
Never forget to help
Never forget what's yours
Never open the door
Niggas see who is real
They be fake as before
Niggas jealous of us
Suckas plotting for sure
But I'm watching for sure
Got the MAC on the floor
Got the gat on the wall
Then I aim at 'em all
Then I leave 'em dissolved
Got your place in my palm
Then I'm praying to God
The angels is taking too long
Please just lay me to rest
But no pain is involved
But I know I got to learn
I'm coming concerned
(Huh) and I'm one of the realest
Niggas mad at me, shit, you got to deal with it
I'd rather be a silent nigga than a nobody
G code, that's for life
Live by it, die by it, nigga

(Uh) real niggas, Lil B
If I had no money
In the streets looking bummy
Real niggas, Red Flame

Would you niggas still give a fuck?
What if I didn't have nothing
Would you still give a fuck?
