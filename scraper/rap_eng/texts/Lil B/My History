[Intro]
Real shit man
It's crazy, because a lot of niggas don't know where to go
'cause a lot of niggas don't know what their past is
You know, our history was burned and shit
But, it's good because niggas can write history every day, you feel me?
I'm doing something every day

[Verse 1]
A lot of niggas cry, but speak no fear
Behind closed doors, is niggas shooting dice on the floor
Brought the colored ones for luck, right before
A piss test from my P.O., behind the BART tracks
Sipping liquor, having dreams with my niggas,"If this rap shit work out
I'm buying all my family a Beamer"
I don't pay attention to that fly shit, the hunger in my stomach
Make most niggas on land seasick
Back to the story at hand, at the dice game
Right before the piss test, my P.O. came
Four niggas by my side, we chosen for this probation
Held slavery in discrete forms
But then you got to realize, a lot of violent black men in the world
Make me want to pull my nine on niggas
And I'm a peaceful dude, just trying to hustle to get my food
I ain't saying that we poor, but we want a little more
In this life, where no one's sure
Unless you're born into the money, our history was burned
So if I was a king, I wouldn't know the answer
Shit, they ask me to pull my pants up
This style war's shit, this the freedom of dress
Can't even dress to impress, I'm so depressed
Because no one's happy for you until you die
Then you cry out of happiness, "I'm alive"

[Hook x2]
Blood, I don't know my history
I'm just trying to find out where I came from
It's a struggle to survive, where I come from
We all left behind, where I come from

[Verse 2]
I'm on a telescope, niggas studying my life
The modern day sacrifice, walking down the street common
I see the pain, look through my own two eyes
Niggas ask me for advice, I just give them a life
The pimp game poisonous, we gain for free
Because I need it, O.G.'s give the game to me
No one to look up to, no dad
That's a tough move, sided core like a truck do
See working long nights on the bus, move
The passion's in my heart to see all success
Had to drive myself, just to be the best
I aim for the fame, and just show the respect
In return, real niggas start to cashing the checks
His to me, every day
History every day, shit, minds will burn
But I move, realize 'til the day was earned
Shit, I reals
Shit, I realize today was earned
My history was urned, but today was earned

Rare shit

[Bridge]
You know, you can make history every day
It don't matter if you don't know where you come from

[Hook x2]
Blood, I don't know my history
I'm just trying to find out where I came from
It's a struggle to survive, where I come from
We all left behind, where I come from - Lil B
