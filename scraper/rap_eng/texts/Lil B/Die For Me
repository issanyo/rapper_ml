(Intro)

Yeah nigga, this new money, you feel me
Hey, straight up mayne, haters nigga, this for you
Yeah I'm talking bout you bruh, this for you, you feel me
Yeah, fo' real, fo' real

(Verse 1)

Yeah, I just swagged in the game now
Jokes on you bitch, our money ain't the same now
Niggas say my name, but you don't understand I'm ready bitch
Motivate the gas, and I'mma spit like I never spit

You'll face shots, thunderbirds, knock his head off
Riding round town, hearing suckas speak on based god
Y'all don't really know I play the game like I'm A-Rod
10 Mil contract, lets start a franchise
Make em' lean and rock and I ain't talkin' bout franchise
One false move, get you touched by this land mine
Come with the Goldeneye, I'm dressed like I'm OddJob
Real beef when you get touched, and get your mind robbed
Mask off, body shots, Mask on, face shots
Been a bad boy and I ain't talkin' bout ci-roc

Left wrist, iPod, Right hand Mack 10
Left hand, Ice Cube, Hollow tips, Ice T
Riding round town with the flat screen, I told ya that
Doja in my napsack, Papoose, run with the gat loose
I don't want no truce bitch

Tiny pants mob, waterfront, that's some new shit
Only thing I ask, is where the, cash and where the coup√© is
Where the Limousine, and where the money in the suitcase
Playing Batman, get you ended like Two-Face
Leave him chopped up, yeah boy he got that screw face
Fuck with Lil B, that will be the end of your legacy
R.I.P hip hop, I just shit on everything
Yeah, and I never let you get the best of me
This is history nigga, Lil B, Holla at me

(Chorus)

Suckas gon' die, when the hollow tips fly
WHO GON' RIDE FOR ME!!!
Don't nobody care, no nobody give a fuck
No nobody's gon' die for me

If you really, wanna ride, then listen to this song
This is armed robbery!!
Can I do a hundred years, don't nobody gives a fuck
Ain't nobody gon' die for me

(Verse 2)

I'm sorta like vulgers, day time holsters
Sit his ass down on imaginary sofas
Reading body language, test when approachin'
You ain't passing this one, coffin with the chauffeur
Looking through the hood, and I ain't talkin' bout a rover
Shoot Aston Martins, driving to Angola

Drive his ass to hell, recall him like Toyota
This ain't Crayola, you ain't got many noises
A lot of legends here, but we ain't got many voices
A lot comes down to your options and your choices
Middle stay hard body, like a Rolls Royce is

Don't wanna be you, just wanna be I
Strapped like I'm T.I
The clips bout knee high
Now you niggas see why, I do it till I D- I -
E Bitch, I'm free bitch, It's Lil B bitch
Haters make me sea sick, I'm rare like a eclipse
Get on my level and I'll show you how to be this

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I said who wants a Mil?
Call me Based God Regis, I been a legend since...
In the foetus, Beat all the sperm, and I'm thuggin', and I bleed this
Nigga this new money bitch

I beat all the sperm nigga, I'm that nigga bruh
Even when I was a mother fuckin' nut, I whooped all that, nigga, millions of sperm
Till that mother fuckin' foetus nigga, you see I'm a hustler
I'm here bitch, Let me live nigga, New money

Lil B 2010, Any of you mother fuckers don't know man, you sleep'
I forgive you for not knowing what the fuck I got, Based God
Rawest Rapper alive! All these rap niggas scared bitch
