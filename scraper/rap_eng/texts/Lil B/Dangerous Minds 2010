Dangerous Minds 2010
Save us all
Thank you Based God
My name's Lil B
All I can do is speak for what you think

Dangerous minds contaminated
This year's hatred sky-rocketed
The stocks lower
Sometimes I think: is my clock slower?
Look them in they eyes
They are not sober
Glock coma
Can't see half of them
I promise
Natural
I come bashing rappers
Lyrical passion
Fasten
Passing
Past-tense asses
Content with glasses
I want masses
Court passes
Secret service
Maybach
Cell phone for the interaction
I move top flight
Hard Rock Hotel lifestyle
Include the lights in my style
I talk more, you pipe down
I talk less, you think about
Now think about what you're thinking about
I ain't the only out
Because I'm... not the only route

Night shifts and night routes
Graveyard
Lighthouse
Get the feeling that I paint
Audio canvas
Pablo Picasso
Yanni of the rap world
Lil B, the Based God
Megastar
But I'm still human
This is a dangerous mind
This is a dangerous mind

My senses told me I play correctly
Situations intercepted
I live my life on guessing
Not knowing the right way
Somehow I find the right thing to keep me lit
Candlelight in my heart
Like the dark nights
Dangerous minds when you create from the heart
No one can start
Only can watch
Obviously, you wrote enough for legacies
Prophecies
Hip-hop, we need a break
Take a second to leave
Come back
Intervene with life's things
I just want to live my dream
If I wake up, will I like what I see?
I guess I have to deal with life's things
That a normal human being
But my emotions are things that brings me peace
Also hell inside
My body's numb from over-thinking
Rapping in a coma
Like I'm forever sleeping
Life ain't easy
I have a dangerous mind
I have a dangerous mind

They put me in a cage with others
Treat me like a man
Probation scams
Wake up
We only live one time
Crime is past-tense
The youth looking to us for a way to live
I'd rather speak real than fake how I live
The younger people need you
Superheroes are real
Take advantage
No superpowers
Just super-humans
Talents we acquire from travel
Distance, Living, Seeing, Believing, Teaching, Reading
Understanding if we love single-handed
And spread it faster than God's of dangerous minds
Have them scared
Outlooks, Notebooks, Microsoft, MacBooks
All stacked up
The people hold the knowledge
No chairs, no college
I walk around life honors
Guaranteed when I raise my hand, I get picked
Nobody can...
Nobody can say sit down
I live my life as positive as I can
Earth teaches
I raise my hand, I'm picked
Let me live

Let me live
