[Hook]
(I will remember you)
Nigga, this the realest shit I could ever say
(Will you remember me)
Cause I'mma kill you niggas, for fucking with me
(Don't let your life pass you by)
Jealous ones still envy, nigga
(Weep not for the memories)

(I will remember you)
Cause I'mma kill you niggas, for fucking with me
(Will you remember me)
Jealous ones envy, quit hating on me
(Don't let your life pass you by)
You feel me? Why you niggas hating on me?
(Weep not for the memories)

[Verse 1]
Bruh think he hard till he see that .44 cock
Silencer on the tip, so it poke him like a flu shot
Seen him broad day, just wait until the new drop
Death of a sucker part one, too hot,
Backspace comma, at the beach in the Bahamas
With a .45 tucked in my pants like a condom,
Haters don't want it man, you know we sending 80 shots
40 to the torso, 30 to the membrane, 30 to the boy that's gon' sleep in the ashes
Paying for the pin, now he looking like a classic
.44 hot like matches, about 2 zips in the closet nigga, P.O. still harrassing
Young nigga so I'm livin by the code, new age gangsta learned that from the mini-mob
Nigga, no phase gangsta, lost in the city fog, when it's dark nigga it's time to get slept on
I want revenge, you fucking bitch

[Hook]
(I will remember you)
Do you remember me?
(Will you remember me)
Cause I'mma kill you niggas, for fucking with me
(Don't let your life pass you by)
Jealous ones envy, quit hating on me, nigga
(Weep not for the memories)

[Verse 2]
Turn the lights on, shotgun slip the switch on
Shotgun pump, kick back leave your wrist numb
It's war going on outside, no man is safe from
Niggas got one or two guns like kids now
Watch him with the scope, as he drift out
Seen him in the Walgreen's should have blew his head off
Revenge is a bitch, genocide is a write-off
Fuck you niggas that was hating on me, got your body bag
Married to the coffin with your body tagged
On the left side, I got mores of a champion
If I'm coming for you that means you a real bitch
Got hitters on my back, that's real sick
No work, she guarantee drill shit
Nigga I guarantee to kill this shit, cause a jail sentence ain't in my destiny
Rawest rapper, punk bitch, you ain't arresting me

[Hook]
(I will remember you) Uhuh, yeah really really
(Will you remember me) Cause I'mma kill you niggas, for fucking with me
(Don't let your life pass you by) Jealous ones still envy, quit hating on me, nigga
(Weep not for the memories)

(I will remember you) Real shit, you fucking bitch
(Will you remember me) Cause I'mma kill you niggas, for fucking with me
(Don't let your life pass you by) Red Flame, I got anger in my heart, jealous ones still envy
(Weep not for the memories) Quit hating on me
