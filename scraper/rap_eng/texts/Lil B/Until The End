[Intro]
Damn, this rain is so fucked up right now. I'm not gon' lie. For real, for real. I ain't bout to hustle no more cause this shit has got fucked up

[Verse]
Never thought I'd be caught up in this rain again
Niggas is dying, falser lying
I gotta home and wrap up a bundle
I told myself if I go broke
Always gon' man up to any struggle, I love the hustle
But cops'll bust you, they beat your ass and cuff you
And even kill you
[?] they get no justice
But I can't speak on situations that I don't know about
Niggas'll fuck around and vote you out, word to mother
I asked my brother if I died would he spread my music to every nigga that ever doubted that I would really do it
He said he could never promise a promise
To be honest it's a lot of haters that's causing these problems
He said you gotta put down and get off the block
These rainy days ain't for real niggas, the dreams never stop
Dapped him up and thanked him for all of his knowledge
Cause hood niggas ain't up in college
Respect with honor
Continue walking to the bus stop
It's like a block away
I feel like a mile away
How'd I survive today?
I follow up like [?] on television
NBA players playing in subdivisions
Niggas is dreaming one day I'll be a megastar
Own my own tour, limousines
Stop believing, I see the reality
The block is in front of me
It's the devil talking to my self-conscience
Won't you let me free, just let me be?
I'm a real nigga that's fantasizing about the bigger picture
My nigga I'm thinking secret islands
I'm talking legendary shit I can't even comprehend
Maybe the rain's over, I bounce back again
Until the end

[Outro]
Talking bout this rain man. I can't hustle no more man I promise that shit. Man I'm bout to give this shit up men. Evil Red Flame. Might hear some things in the back of my soul. Get off that block bruh. Lil B
