[Verse 1]
I forgive them, but kill them
They hating on the realest
This is way past my feelings
That I couldn't even deal with
Yet they make me who I am
Something to [?]
[?] my mind
Based World got my back
I swear to god I love this life
Niggas push me to the limit
I'm askin' niggas that I know
Do these niggas really hate me?
I'm lonely, choppers in my house
If they scar my face with them
They know love in the game
I'm gonna split a bitch, real

[Hook]
Killah (x4)

[Verse 2]
Sit 'em down, lay 'em down
My blue eyes, so nice
My half, knock 'em down
Knock the other niggas that are playing around
Y'all make me stay split
Game is getting changed now
Niggas think this is a game
Stay in your fuckin' lane
Hol' back, don't do that
Karma's shit, it's so real
I pray to god, whoever that is, and
This was before they killed my family
In the world, there are things that I care about
And you stuck in the ozone
I put a strap in your mouth, bitch

[Hook]

[Outro]
Baby, Killah
Killah, Killah (x3)
