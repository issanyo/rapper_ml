I'm tryna save as many people as I can
But you know it ain't easy
(When you're lost)
People be fucked up
(Never look down)
Ya feel me?
(When you're lost)
I had to make this for the people that don't understand when they're lost
(You know I'll be around)
But they be

When you're lost you make bad decisions
You don't even know bout the mission
You follow everybody that got a position
In the dark you're scared
Give up everything just to be cool
Fake people love to copy
Would cross your own family just to be in the game
Killing innocent people, just to gain some fame
Back home you playin the crazy game
This shit that makes it go insane

When you're lost
Never look down
When you're lost
You know I'll be around

You know, people minds be out and in
In and out

When you're lost
Never look down
When you're lost
You know I'll be around

In and out we spirallin

Rest your room that expose your brains
Taking chances, listening to pears
They jump off the bridge
So you go

They don't want nothing
Then you don't want it
You jump somebody just to prove that you are loyal
But you're lost, another shadow so spoiled
And the sick lose their life when evil strikes
The evil move at night
They wanna hide but we can see that light

When you're lost
Never look down
When you're lost
You know I'll be around

They need help
Just keep your mind right

When you're lost
Never look down
When you're lost
You know I'll be around

I gotta keep my mind right
This shit be happening every night
I gotta keep my mind right, yea

Daytime I put a mask on
Some days I don't accept it
They ask for it
All of the pain, all of this pressure
People, they be preyin on the naive
Love the world but the hangin around demons
Put all your trust in a lie that's so decievin
They say they got your back, but what does that mean?
When you fall, they takin everything
They push you from the front, just to see you scream

When you're lost
Never look down
When you're lost
You know I'll be around

It's Lil Boss
Watch the sons form the faith
They won
See your worst in them, you take your place

When you're lost
Never look down
When you're lost
You know I'll be around

Watch out
Watch out for the fakes
Yea

Girls sellin their bodies against they own will
Dudes doing drugs, you don't know how to feel
You get dumped in the pains of life
Everything I pinch myself just to see if I'm alive
I got to sleep, I'm so asleep
I'm in deep dark, it changes every week
You can stay away from the hate
They love to see you fake

When you're lost
Never look down
When you're lost
You know I'll be around

When you're lost
Never look down
When you're lost
You know I'll be around
