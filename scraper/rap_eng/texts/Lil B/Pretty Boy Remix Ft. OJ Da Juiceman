(Hook)
Bruh I got hoes like a young ass bitch
I can fuck any broad
Cause I'm that fuckin' rich
I can put her on the map
And I make her suck my dick
This is young Based God
I'm a pretty boy, bitch

(Verse 1: OJ Da Juiceman)
Boy I got hoes, boy I got gwap
Catch a nigga main bitch make that ho give me top
If I catch her making jug then I know I'm making top
Man I'm Bouldercrest shawty man you know I run the block
Man I'm Sun Valley workin, trappin' with a .40 Glock
Man it's pretty boy shit, got me sittin' on top
While I'm in the kitchen workin' with the fork in the pot
Put an X on the beak, now I'm busting down blocks
I can fuck any bitch, cuz' young Juiceman, yeah he rich
It's 80 whole Gs sittin on my right wrist
It's 2 hundred 80 thousand on my necklace
And my house is a mansion, from whips at my shit
And I got 6 Ringz on, like I play with MJ, bitch
And I'm bubba kush-y blowin' like I growed it
32 Ent, that's my gross, bitch
Young Based God, and we bunkin!

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Lil B)
Damn Based God had too many threesomes
Powerhouse shorty, knock a ho head in
I'mma fuck her like an alien
I do the Paris Hilton I'mma make a sex tape
Pretty bitch porno, every girl want me
Niggas on my dick cause every bitch on me
Pay thirty thousand your girl suck my dick cuz
XLR I'm from the hood like a Harley
Turn my swag on cause I'm so gnarly
Young Based God and I'm shutting down the party
Bitches suck my nuts cause I look like a prophet
Beggin me to fuck her, I told her bitch stop it
I'm so pretty you can't even touch me
VIP closed off you canâ€™t even hug me
Young Based God, running bitches like Rugby
Young Based God, I fuck her face like her husband

(Hook)
