[Bridge]
Real hip-hop
I never stop, never stop
I always keep going
Never stop, I never stop
I always keep going

[Verse 1]
Yah I won't stop
Yah I won't quit
Try to take me out the game
That's some cold shit
All I do is help the people
Show 'em the way
We all equal
When I speak it hits your soul like needles
Rhyme style acupuncture
Raps is cunning
Sometimes I have to sit back and wonder
Long trips down the road left my back mis-structured
Riding with the homeless, gat in focus
Can't believe my own homie
He-he smoking hop in Oakland
He don't want rocks (?)
I used to be you, I was drying soda
Niggas think that they grind is over
Praying on my downfall, my time is closer
Never made shit
Dig your own grave
You won't exist bitch
Lil Boss

[Bridge]
I never stop, never stop
I always keep going
Never stop, I never stop
I always keep going

Why you wanna fly
Why you wanna fly
Why you wanna fly

[Verse 2]
You wanna play a game
I can say the same shit
I'm on the block and I fuck with gangsters
I hold shop and I tuck the banger
Have no fear I was out with monsters
People on drugs they was gone regardless
Came in a group but you're not a mobster
I'm not either, I'm just a leader
Them bullets hit your chest like emphysema
Imma set it off like Queen Latifah
I have no money, my thoughts is bloody
You can tell by my vibe I was up to something
I need a little help, tighten my belt
Got to clear my mind up to get out of this hell
Guns Mario Cart, I'm letting off shells
I don't need bail 'cause I'm trapped in this hell
Lil B
