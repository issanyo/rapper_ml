[Intro]
Extra, extra, we got a new player in town!
It's Lil, It's Lil B

[Verse 1]
Peyton on the Broncos, like Jordan on the Wizards
Stay with your team and don't switch over, nigga
Just loyal to the money, nobody loyal
Would of put you in the coffin, and destroy you
Talking to my teammates in the locker room, trying to get locks
And connections, like The Lox stay connected
I'm like D-Block, I'm well respected
Fuck with the streets and intercept it, that's off the record
Free my soul, and free my mind
Conditioned to hate money, I spend it like it's nothing
People wanna buy me, but they don't say nothing
I'm trying to talk connections, numbers, press buttons
All of the above, the dubs higher than rap
Help my soul, cocaine got me feeling numb
I put suckers underground for acting dumb
Stopped smoking blunts, that's why I don't give a fuck

[Hook](x2)
Peyton on the Broncos, like Jordan on the Wizards
Stay with your team and don't switch over, nigga
LeBron with Miami, these niggas need a Grammy
I'm pitching underhanded

[Verse 2]
Niggas don't seem to appreciate, put you on the team:
You instigate, trying to get money:
You instantly hate, fuck getting money
I'm out here living life, puttin' bitches on they back
Taxes going up for dough, so I'm not coming back
"No" for smacking drug dealers with the Mac
Niggas get cross-eyed, seen 'em before they died
You wouldn't cry for me, so I'm not gon' cry
Handle work like business, handcuff with the business
Two men with the business, which means two snitches
Most people gon' tell, might as well roll with the Semi
Handle shit solo, you hear me?
Niggas gon' snitch out here, you hear me?
Handcuffs and deals, they wanna lock you in the city
Call me Rondo, because they caught me with the Semi
I ain't telling - Lil B

[Hook](x2)
Peyton on the Broncos, like Jordan on the Wizards
Stay with your team and don't switch over, nigga
LeBron with Miami, these niggas need a Grammy
I'm pitching underhanded
