I wanna give a big shout out to Japan, China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Korea, Nepal, Hawaii, all that, the Philippines, the whole 9 nigga. Yeah. Real gangsters you feel me

[Verse 1]
Nigga get his ass [?] playing with us
Niggas used to bully me, now I'm so street
Nigga play with me, get his ass burnt
I'm tired of getting bullied, now it's my turn
Niggas gonna die and I'm gon' kill
In the bitch mob and we on the field
Nigga just [?]
Nigga you gon' push that line
I don't give a fuck, bitch we awol
Every time I ball my fist, I'm slapping broads
Every time I ball my fist, I be mad as shit
Hundred thousand for a show, I don't get no shit
Fifty thousand for a show, I ain't lying bitch

Niggas talking down on the BasedGod

The BasedGod taking over the music recording industry. The music business. The billion dollar contracts, you dig. Big shout out to Mack Maine, what it do

[Verse 2]
I never get mad, I just swing my door
Shout out Waterfront [?] we on the boat

I'm a whore, I'm finna do the slut walk
Niggas play with me, I don't know talk
Niggas play with us, make 'em die
Lord I'm tired of these bullies in my life
The next nigga playing he gon' fly

Nigga turned on me, that's friendly fire
All my niggas rich, a hundred million or more
I remix Lil Xan and I swing my door
52 bitch I'm charging up [?]
Fuck the plug nigga and I fuck my hoe
Niggas don't know I got bitches galore
I'm flexing Klay Thompson when I swing my door
BasedGod
