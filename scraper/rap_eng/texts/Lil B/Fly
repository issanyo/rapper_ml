[Verse 1]
Can't nobody tell me shit
I'm flyer than a bitch, man, I'm flyer than my bitch
So you can say I'm cocky I'm confident
But don't let a nigga tell you you ain't the shit
See see, yous a goddamn lie
Some nigga telling me I ain't that fly
Get a lint brush, take ya clothes to the cleaners
Get a couple bucks, get the vans the cleanest
Yeah $35.99, but to tell the truth?
You don't need a dime to shine
Cause the real shine comes from what's inside
Insecurities and egos put that aside
Maybe you could realy find you a friend who ride
And you feel so fly that you might can glide
The morals of the world which you must abide
S.S. to the death, for The Pack I ride like

[Hook]
Fly, don't let nobody tell you you ain't fly
You go keep yo head up in the sky
Dreams are the things that never die
Why why am I so fly

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Cleaner than west baby, fly as my sweater
Don't let nobody tell you different, yeah whatever
I think different, ain't scared to be different
I dress different than you, I got different visions
And light the same shit, yeah it's different pimpin
Don't be scared, like whatever it's whatever
You don't like me? I don't care I ain't stressin'
Prolly need me like salad with the dressin'
Haters they mad like that's their profession
Put my work in, I can talk about my blessins
Thank god I stay fly like the Jetsons
Thank god I saty fly like the Jetsons
Retro pimpin ya boy 87
Bounced back twice with the help of a reverend
Keep these fuckin niggas guessing,  yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Uno]
Have you ever heard of fly young pimpin?
Look in Webster, I'm the definition
Fly guy, fly whip, always in a fly whip
That get a fly bitch always givin' me tips
It's a cold world so I'm a ice box
And the Wolfpack, how you like that
Sippin belvy diamonds for the ice yes
Hit the sun lite drippin like a faucet
I'm an idol, something like a trendset
Gun on the hip, get buff like a bench press
You don't want it with the kid I'm a quick draw
Draw put you on my words, call it clip art
Got a girlfriend nickname cool whip
Why? Cause she rides like a new whip
Smoove cool and it look good
I see that yeah gimme that

[Verse 4: Stunna]
Whoever would have thought I'd be stunting like this
Whoever would have thought I'd be snatching yo chick
Stunna man say the boy move sick
I ride big whips and I stack big chips
Stay away from the fakes, cause the haters ain't shit
Stay high yea I be so fly
Purp in my blunt boy I be so high
You see the stretch Hummer yea that's up all night
I remember when I used to dream, look at the sky
Now I sit in first class and look down from the sky
Dayum now that's a transition
Shout out to my homie shorty help me with my pimpin'
And don't be scared if you're different
Cause really if you think, them's the only ones gifted
2800 you ain't know I bag Krack St
Gotta rep the hood that's where dirt be the ac
