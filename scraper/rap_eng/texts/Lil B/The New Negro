[Intro: Richard Heffner & Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Interview]

[Verse 1]
I'm heem, I'm scary like a dream
I'm moving to the cup cause I'm going for the cream
All the time coffee like infrared with the beam
I done infiltrate your base  and now I'm coming for your king
You can look me in my face, you see the wisdom from a dream
Please, Martin Luther King let me start what you leave
I can breathe what you see even if I can't compare
Living life like a movie like the people under stairs
And my stares get percieved like I'm pissed off
I'm just dark skinned with a big dick
And ego to my nut sack, fuck rap and fuck me
Cut your club ? lights, don't stop in the night and just keep going
Plus the price that you pay to be a member
Is far from gang violence, check my salary and enter
Active in the summer and sports in the winter
Talking to the green and I'm not Master Splinter
Segway, God damn my mind so based
Off no grapes, feed based, bag it up
Got the weed, bag it up
Got to eat, cracking up
See my fiends in the hood, they would sleep standing up
Too many fallen soldiers lost, they were breached before they cut
Putting bleach up in the cut, won't dismiss what you touch
You don't diss what you love cause I'm loving every second
Check my visions from above, I had to put it on the record, yes

[Interlude: Dr. Martin Luther King & Barack Obama]

[Verse 2]
Mind frame fit like the fist fight
Missed and I dip right
Rather get left from an invite
Don't be getting mad that you live life
Cause if my person right
More than half mad that my gift tight
Should've been gift wrapped
Blunt from the impact
God damn, all I really want is to live right
Make art every day and squint from the sunlight
My view like Metropolis, you know what my topic is, yeah

[Outro: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]
