[Lil B]
Day after day
Night after night
Yall really wonder If I got pain huh?
Like Boosie said If you ain't from the streets you don't deserve it

[Verse 1 : Lil B]
You motherfuckers wanna know If I rep fast or slow
Laid back in the lac with a stack of dro
Well step back or get slapped with a mac or ho
You stupid motherfuckers act like yall don't know
I come through big cuts and I grasp your ho
But Im a nasty and I like to get ass and roll
And I ain't for all the talking shit just pass the dro
All this mainstream rap cats ashing flows
If yall really get enough to try and grasp and hold
The king rap mike with his step and throws
Thought you was the king I got the master rose
But I see you trailing fall back with your bags to hold
Cause you riding niggas dicks, ask the hoes
Make sure you rip my badge with chose
Its two for dub bitch Im closed
Im not barring it
Put the minks when Im cold
Put the crack white in the sink of the stove
How you get it cause you sick cause of dro
My fast flow keep the way like ???????
You don't sound right like rhymes with no

[Hook : Lil B]
Kick rocks tickle dick bitch pass the dro (x3)
(Uh, westside throw it up
Uh, hands up throw it up, yeah #1 Bitch
This that #1 shit)
I ain't really even tripping, ask the ho

[Verse 2 : Lil B]
Grandpa watching over me, bruh watching over me
I love my Dad but.. I don't understand
Im so in the matrix, I can't take it
I can't replace it you don't wanna chase it
On this road to life sometimes you waste it
Rarely see dope when the weather gets crazy
Driving through the trees on the backroads
This long stretch of life, least we gon' make it
Stay positive and it won't be shady
My life to live, it gets crazy
Never been a drug dealer cocaine ain't make me
Im just Robin Hood watch the D like a safety
And Im robbing from your blokes distribute em to packs
And to go back home.. and
I don't think Im hard cause I know the dope dealer
I rob the dope dealer no respect to drug dealers

[Hook: Lil B]
