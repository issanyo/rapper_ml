[Babygirl pio]
Talking)
You know sometimes whenever you feel something so strong you’ve just gadda call it out. So here I go
(Music starts)
Baby you’re the whole damn world to me
And when we kiss I want you to believe you’re not alone
When I close my eyes it’s you I see
Oh you’re not alone
If you ever feel lonely
Go back to all our old notebooks
Yeah I’ll be there on every page
In every love song
If you ever feel that need to hold me close at night but simply can’t
Just close your eyes
I’ll be there, waiting for you in your dreams
Oh- (Long note)
You’re not alone
You’re the whole damn world to me
And when we kiss I want you to believe
That ohhhhh oh no no no you’re not alone (long note)
I’ll be anywhere for you
When you close your eyes it’s me you’ll see
So never think that you’re alone
Look back at all our memories and it’s me you’ll find
I wanna be everywhere to you
I wanna make you believe that you’re not alone
Now tell me this
And I the whoooole damn world to you? (long note)
When you cose your eyes is it me you see?
Yes
You’re not alone

Niggas look in my eyes and wonder why I don't cry
How the fuck I survive? I would struggle with god
Niggas will slang back the fourth till the hustlers rise
Then the customers died, it was nothing to fly
Nigga taught me in the hood, you better run when you shine
I hit a nigga with the Glock that the government provide
Be prepared, never been scared of pussy
Pussy niggas eat pussy and gossip
Cry to the bitches, how you gonna live with that shit?
You was claiming gangsta, but you a little too late
I was coming off the porch when niggas was all straight
I stay away from the hate, because you niggas all fake
Lost pounds in the game, rounds to the fame
I went back and forth with the mirror, I see clearer
My soul needs rest and I never could sleep
Niggas will try to play me cheap, bitch, I'm down for the bleed
Broke the windows with my hand, no gloves on my fingers
Niggas was thugging for the hoes, and ?? was the cleanest
That was never the pussy, I always had heart
Coming straight out the dark, nigga left you in the park
I'm certified, you can't break me apart
Always had heart, I'm alone in the dark, because I'm lost
[Lil pio]
Ahhhh shit ya know how it is girl
Days go by an' youse just feel like that your lonely
Lil b is off the charts he write a song with me
Energy within me keep me charged
Bitches can't have unless its you
I got the world on my shoulders you got me distracted
Damn I am so attractred
Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer baby
Roll me up
All I want is you, baby
Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher girl
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer baby
Roll me up
All I want is you baby
You're my babygirl (Ain't ya?)
Just my lil babygirl
Im the man on the moon by myself unless you with me baby
Your right girl we not alone
