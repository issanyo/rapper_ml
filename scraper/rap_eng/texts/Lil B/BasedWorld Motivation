If you really pay attention to Lil B
That mean you see life at the rawest
Gotta step back outside yourself
Outside wutchu learned, wutchu think it's right
It's normal with straight edge
My life entertainment, my life is not a game man
People get smoked fo show, I was depressed
And I ain't even know
Didn't wanna show, girl, man
It's another set of problems
Bitches be snakes, baby momma drama
Truth man, fuck hatin
Last time I hit a lick I switched lil cases
And thank God, you feel me?
Dude walked by just for doing the job
The respect for they family that's losing they jobs
Don't even walk by, I think about em all
Stuck in the middle just beatin the odds
Everybody round me dissolved
That's why I stayed low key like Pau Gasol
Gotta talk to the world but it start with ya'll
Now I'm he only rapper unsigned to kill it
Took the get in the weed, I'm down for drillin
Niggas know when the based God in the building
D saws all the way to the ceiling
You gotta love before you marry
It's more than paper if you die for the money
It's more than paper, shitty attitude or hate your neighbor
You the type of nigga who don't get no paper
You the type of nigga that like a hater
Catch you slippin man, bite the laser
We all got some looses if you at the top
It's the food chain, I'm just tryna stay at the top
If you'd see how meat made you would lose your lunch
Don't hate, just love
I'm really the only dude that don't like to front
Fuck the stuntin
Sit back, talk life, you just smoke a blunt
Real talk man
We only live it once
Lil B, I said enough

Based God, based God...
Glassface, you know, mixtape
A lot of fellas struggling on the team gon make it
I'm like listen to the pain, listen to the triumph
It's Lil B
