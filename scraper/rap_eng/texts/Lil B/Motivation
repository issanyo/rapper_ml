[Intro]
Yeah, motivation come in so many different
So many different shapes and forms
Angels Exodus
A lot of people said I would never do it
That's what scares me, cause you fear what you can't see
That's motivation for life
Based God

[Verse 1]
Give it up one time for the player haters
Y'all motivate me, so I gotta thank you
Long time I was mad I didn't have no paper
Got fucked by the game, contract labor
Same dudes fucked me over act like my neighbors
Niggas slept on the boss now they ask for favors
Text my phone everyday like they know about me
If you don't fuck with me, don't be around me
Niggas reach on anything that they think is poppin'
Groupies same thing
Haters same thing
Suckas same thing
Niggas play it awkward
Do a lot of movin', but you ain't never talkin'
Dudes like me, I'm preaching what I'm walkin'
Keep my head up, always lookin' forward
Front cover of The Fader for you lame haters

[Refrain]
This is motivation, just motivation

[Interlude]
I remember y'all niggas who hated me
Now you niggas on my dick
I remember all you bitches hatin' on me
Now you fuck with me
I remember this one time
I remember one time motherfuckers forgot about me
Had no money in my pocket
Didn't know about when my next show was

[Verse 2]
I got five on it if you got twenty on it
Finna stop smokin' weed cause I gotta focus
Clear head to see things that you wouldn't notice
Feel like addition of the best of it
Most people don't care what be stressin' you
So no talking, plead the fifth often
Finna stay Based til I'm in the coffin
While I'm on Earth, I'mma spread the knowledge
Niggas learn from the blocks, they ain't seein' college
Niggas learn from the real and I fuck with mobsters
But I gotta stay level-headed
I know it's no love in the streets, just guns and pavement
No talk when you sleep cause suckas know we waitin'
Swear to God niggas fuck with Satan
Fake shit, that's motivation
The plan's for The Revelation

[Refrain]
