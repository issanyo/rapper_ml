[Intro]
I love niggas
I don't know why niggas hatin', man
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
Bro want blow, that's one thing I know
You keep speakin' on me, you'll be broker than before
I'm ridin' through the city, nobody ridin' with me
Thats' why I'm goin' far, cause nobody flyin' with me
A lot of niggas not built like that
Fee, fi, fo, fum, I cut the deal like crack
Niggas jealous of me, I'd be jealous of me
I was lookin' in the mirror, started to feel like a dream
If I said your name, you should be proud you accomplished something
I'mma let you speak my name, you the awkward one
Fuck these niggas, man, I'm feelin' like Cassius
You be worried 'bout a car, nigga I'm buildin' a school
Niggas tryin' to catch up, bitch stay in your place
You older, tryin' to get on my level you need to get sober
You really not Based, I could see it in your eyes
Are you leavin' or stayin', the rap game is my life

[Hook] x2
Keep speakin' on me, you won't blow no mo
You the type of nigga to hate and blow up my phone
I respect your struggle, but I'm not no ho
It's finna be a drought cause there's no more blow

[Verse 2]
I'm really in the hood, I'm hearin' stories 'bout lashin'
I was mindin' my business, niggas hit me with the business
Said my niggas got murked for a ounce of lean
I'm like activists gettin' people killed nowadays
Got me fucked up, I'm feelin' like I'm out and away
How do I not complain? I'm takin' time out
Niggas see I pushed the line out, let my mind out
Help the world, help the hood, without givin' no money
I help the whole damn world without givin' no money
Money 50 percent, the other 50 is lovin'
Most niggas really thuggin', had issues with lovin'
Parents put them in positions, nobody was huggin'
So, niggas hit the block like why should I love 'em?
Nigga take it from me, man I love you my brother
A lot of street niggas die and they ready for that
I'm ready to live and I'm bringin' it back
I make it cool to want to push way further
When it's said and done, I'll never be happy 'bout murder
I'm not barbaric, the hood is hysteric
Media got agendas with the hate, wanna fill you with the hate
Movies fill you with the hate, life fill you with the love
I'mma float like doves, I'm really from the block, what's up
My nails still long with dirt under 'em
Nigga fuck them suckas and them scandalous bitches

[Hook] x2
