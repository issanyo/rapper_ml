[Verse]
Throwin' cold water on my face
Wakin' up next day
Coal in my eye, like I'm a miner
Walkin' downstairs with the towel in my hand
Presents on my mind
I wonder what I got
Couldn't sleep on Christmas Eve to think about what's next
Anything, I wish I get
So I walked in the living room, lookin around me
Tryna find all the presents
Thought its astoundin'
But to my surprise, I ain't got not one
I started thinkin', I was bad or somethin'
So I asked Mom, what's really goin' on?
My friend got a new bike, silver with chrome
Why I'm all alone, she said
Christmas ain't about the gifts
It's about love and the spirit within'
Don't compare to your friends
We unique and the money don't break us
No presents on this day
Please, do me a favor
Call your best friend
Uh, even tap your neighbor
Help a person out, be open for labor (help out)
Listen to the guy passin' by thinkin' that he high
But really he just tryna get by
Listen to the woman on the streets or somethin'
With the head down lookin' like she readin' or somethin'
But all she readin' is the cracks in the pavement
Tryna decide if her life is really worth, what they claimin'
Be a man of honor, not a potential leader
Wisdom over knowledge
My mom gave me a kiss, I walked
Back up the stairs put my hoodie on
Christmas Day, walked outside appraised the space
I feel blessed this way
Now I know the real meanin' of Christmas
It's no Santa Claus, just personal business
Spread love (spread love, Merry Christmas)
Uh, yeah, I said, Spread love, Merry Christmas
