Base
Please let off shots
This is amazing what just happened
I cannot believe

[Verse 1]
As I sit and lay, I watch myself from the top
It's like third person, I see
My life's like a video game, just me
I seen God kiss my forehead while I asleep
Told me I was the chosen One--that must be me
Every time I think about thoughts that I might not understand
But now, things seem to come into place
Ever since I was kissed by God
He kissed my face

God kissed my face

God--he kissed my face

[Verse 2]
I seen him. He kissed me on my forehead
I believe him
That must mean that I'm far from demons but close to earth
So I must be near them
I think he's protecting me, showing me something
Directly, maybe indirectly
Once again this is from third-person, so I'm the Chosen One
If I was myself, I might not know
But since I'm looking from the top, I can see the growth
Things I know are different from things I learned
People, missions--some complete, some incomplete, all unique, all direct
Affect to help me to get the spot where I am now
I lay my head down, I'm on the bed
And God kissed my forehead

This is just amazing to me

Please call on me and help me for life

Thank you God
Your kiss has helped me to know and to go and to grow
I will try my best to lead as how I know

God has kissed my forehead
