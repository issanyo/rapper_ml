Feelin them good days when it seems to be real
And tell me I ain't never forget them days but you know what? She still gutter
You feel me? Like motherfuckers still thugging and keeping this shit real in the hood, man I ain't gon lie
There's still some real niggas ouchea
Aye man, there's still some real people alive
You know I ain't forgot about you you know
I dedicate this to you, don't forget about me
But this Illusions of Grandeur Part 2 Mixtape
You know this is just real
You know we adding on to history
Yea yea yea

I was raised in the gutter, shouts out to the big block
I was born in the good, first steps on the black top
My hoodie inside out and my pants is backwards
There was a blunt in my mouth, staying close to the ratchet
My young niggas died, he was cool for the casket
But life moves on, I'm still living through ashes
Niggas don't play me, they just gotta pay me
And the hood niggas call me the God of emcee
Don't make that, this life shit crazy
Gotta play your cards right, pushing the hard white
You lost your life like it was clothes
I stay close the close
Niggas talk, I'm lifting like their home
Real niggas from the day don't tuck their chrome
You talkin bulshit, you better leave me alone
There's no tolerance for these fake ass niggas, I don't fuck with the hood
Cause they snake ass niggas
The ones that go to jail keeps the cop with the job
They say life's hard but it's all in your mind
You just got a ticket, go pay that fine
That welfare office nigga, it's a long ass line
I done did the food stamps, have no car to drive
Walking with my mom, carrying food down the street
My arms hurt, beyond the bus now
We gon spoo under the bridge
I was waiting for the 51 right near canned foods and the saki bar
But I stay gassed up and I don't have no car
The bus was my friend, it took me places real far
Don't forget about me... Lil B

Yea, don't forget about me
You can't forget about that thug shit
You know? This the real stories, yea
From the bottom to the top
Yea, don't forget about me
Yea, ride with me one time while we stroll down the memory lane

How you gonna dream when you can't think clear?
I have never been scared, I put zips anywhere
But I keep my eyes open cause these snakes is focused
Hit him right with that burner turn his ass to a locust
Reincarnated, we gotta try it another life
You came back a butterfly, spread your wings and fly
I'm sorry that you died but I don't respect you
You was a hater on earth, wasn't no one special
Now you layin 6 feet, the greed that get you
Niggas wanna stay down with that same ass mental
You a pimp or you a dealer?
Drug addict or a killer?
I'm waiting for the day I see a doctor with gold teeth
Do it for me, the hood where I sleep
Don't forget about me
My name's Lil B
