[Intro]
What they say, what they say now
What they say, what they say now
What they say, what they say now
What they say, what they say now
Protect Lil B, at all costs, namsayin'

[Verse 1]
Last club, left the bathtub
Like a flash flood baptism
Caps sizzle packs in the van
That's thizzle as Mac Drizzle
Deal is half pickle
Jammed as bad pistols
The poorly dressed
The correlated, the laureates
No relation unless it's coronated to coronets
As well, Oswald Cobblepot, Alpo
How so
Pepperpot love a heartless man in a letter that's penned to Gwyneth Paltrow
The ends justify the outro
Black hue, Hugh Heffner to the heifers
The boy cow's a gaucho
L'Oreal, story tales
Brush blush on the rough cuts of the Maury fails
You are not the cannon fodder, relax
Catch me outside, how 'bout dat
Trust all the Einsteins, if you want the facts
Fuck Harvey Weinstein, if you want to act
White people having serious brand issues, can't kiss you
Behind the scenes, fuckin' us from the back
Got too comfortable with Barack
Now uncle Trump's making me feel so un-wonderful with the hat
Who watchin' you by the cap
Make America great again
I just don't to wait at these great American gates again
Patiently staying in place for 3 hours for a rollercoaster is Ridiculous
Well isn't it?
Protect Lil B, and all lowercase betas
To overtake the haters
To motivate the saviors
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea

[Outro: Lil B]
It's all love, I don't promote violence, I'm never with the violence. So I love them and it's all good, you feel me? I'm still here, I got jumped by like 10 mothafuckas, you know what I'm sayin? Been by myself. It's all love though, like I said, it's all love
