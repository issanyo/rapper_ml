[Verse 1]
Glock .45, it'll make your dreads shake
Buy a couple guns, let's up the murder rate
Girl, bend over, put the dick in your face
If you don't twerk, we gon' up the murder rate
Do a drive by with the guns in the car
Shoot up them suckers, yeah, they brains on the floor
Still go dumb with the gun in my pants
Critical condition, if you don't dance
If you in the club or if you at a party
Where the guns at? Let's get it started
Who gon' get shot? Who gon' get shot?
Who gon' get left with they brains on top?
We never tell, we don't call the cops
Snitches get stitches that's off top
(Yes)

[Hook] (x2)
Up the murder rate, up the murder rate
Up the murder rate, up the murder rate
Up the murder rate, up the murder rate
Up the murder rate, up the murder rate

[Verse 2]
Come here, girl, let me whisper in your ear
Bitch, I got this gun and you might get killed
Take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Yeah, I got a gun, you gon' take a loss
Bulletproof vest, riding around Oakland
With the guns in the back, doing a high-speed
Then pullover, if you get scared, don't come into the party
Still in the club with the guns and the money
Throwing out hundreds so strippers like this
If she don't dance, I'mma shoot that bitch
Shout out to the army, bustin' niggas heads
U.S Navy with the infrared
I'mma still bring my gun to the club
I'mma still party every night with the thugs
Fuck rapping, I'mma get it trapping

[Hook] (x2)
