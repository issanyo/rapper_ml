[Intro]
Let me bring you back to, you feel me, 94 on it, haha, yah

[Verse]
Let me tell you 'bout my main bitch
She loved to fuck suckas out the game bitch
1995 is when she hit her first lick
I was standing by the car, we was stealing the shit
I never had a down girl like this before
But bitches play games and you know these hoes
I didn't realize she didn't realize
We were so young my mind getting energized
If I was really on game I would've put her on game
Baby girl take a case for me any day
This is real, more than a family thing
Understand that, it was small [?] everything
Riding down the stop smoking on that mary jane
She got my back I got her back when we switching lanes
If we switching lanes we staying on the same page
Don't talk every day but still comminicate
I wanna keep it real honest when I ain't thinkin' straight
I love you girl and that's on everything
That's on everything
I love your girl, that's on everything

[Hook]
Girl what's your name I need you like mary jane
Say your name, I wanna say your name, I said
Girl what's your name I need you like mary jane, I said
What's your name, what's your name
I said, girl what's your name I need you like mary jane, I said
