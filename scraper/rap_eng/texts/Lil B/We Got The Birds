[Intro: Teebird]
Yo, yo, word is bond
Form like Voltron
Uh, uh keep it gritty, huh

[Hook: Errbody]
W-w-we got the birds, so flee out the burbs
You better quit gum flapping or it's gun clapping
You know we got the verse
We got the birds, speak out your hearse
You might lose an appendage or we might
Write your death sentence with these nouns and verbs

[Verse 1: Algernon]
Birds learned to hop, man walked up right
We never really talk, it only makes you uptight
Eyes to the sky take a rare chance to fly
I’ll leave you a stone where your ancestors lie
Engraved on it, my promise will be a target
Celestial air strike get a comet to bomb it
And my condolence, doesn’t mean I condone it
It means it’s my life and I can’t just disown it
Highlander, live and die by the blade
Everyday a new fight and a new grave
Love lost life lost surviving in my scars
A face made of war paint a God in the stars
Calling out to me, calling out to you
A manifest destiny so what you gonna do
Face up to your fate, or slowly back down
Either way I have to leave you cold on the ground

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SDBB aka BBDS :2 esreV]
I know I bottle all my rhymes up until the suppressors broke
So get up off my balls bitch, I am not professor Oak

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ottafiyah]
Tee said that he got the bird
Needed to call the expert
So I got picked up by chauffeurs
Yiff Squad, rep my furs
Young guns on the scene, like an NRA scenario
Rand Paul, liberty flow
Kill this track, leave it John Doe
Watch the soul of the track fly
Like the pegasus inside
I've been blessed by the martyr
The human face, divine
Can't let my nation be the villain
Trying to steal from our children
Gotta keep fighting for the future
Trying to lead a movement, give my country the suture
Modern revolution, fought on the computer

[Hook]

[Verse 4: OrangeJuneyahSimpson AKA Juneyah AKA Mute Spittah]
I spit this shit from my soul, from the Omnitrix
Smoked out. Dispensing knowledge to the pharmacists
See with the haze my blueprint is a haze
I Just Blaze, skip around my destiny and pave
A new information highway for the kids
Corrupting young minds, for this crime you don't live
They try to feed me hemlock; I sip the poison right untill the pen drop
Right until these Ken MCs running the game stop
Running around, screaming nothing, making up sounds
Get a million plus sales, they get a million plus rounds
Put they asses in the catacombs with rap's royal family
I'd trade all the Maybachs for Death Row happily
