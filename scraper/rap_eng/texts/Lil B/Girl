Back that bitch nigga like B.G
All that bitch snitchin', let her rest in peace
Death to a bitch nigga like a nigga would
I got problems with bitches, I got problems with niggas (Fuck them!)
Fuck you bitches or fuck you niggas (Fuck off!)
In that new Rolls Royce, hittin' the backwoods
On the top floor nigga, with a hundred bitches (Talk up)
Thank you BasedGod, I got three bitches (Great job!)
If a nigga playin', I might chin check
Christina Yamaguchi with the ice skate (Yup)
Nigga know what's up (What?)

Don't talk to me nigga (No!)

Aye, for that check, I'm runnin' out of bounds
But still countin' money, I don't let niggas down
That bitch talk too much, put her underground
That bitch talk too much, she ain't talkin' now
Nigga talk too much, man they all slaves (Mmhmm!)
These bitches talk a lot, man they get a whole fade
That bitch talk too much, she a fuckin' slave
That bitch talk too much, she gon die today (Die today)
Understand me, I'm the OG

[Verse 3]
My nigga, we gon campaign or what?
These bitches so fake man, I can't trust 'em
My body be cold, I need a heater
I know you stuntin' niggas from Oakland that will fucking sleep (Damn!)
I don't wanna drop bodies so I drop tears
I'm the real Lil Boss, the game stop here
I stop trustin' bitches, now I mix 'em up
Put your face in a wall, and beat the bitch up (Why?)
You niggas don't know the pain that I done seen
I've been disrespected, I can't forget it (No!)
I got a real brother that's real deep
My stomach still hurt, but I can't go to sleep
I got shit that... camera guy
My stomach still hurt, you niggas is fake as fuck
You bitches love to see a nigga stressed out
That's why these bitches goin' down

[Outro]
You know, we love all
But we do not fuck with the fakers at all
Believe that, we fuck with all, we love all
But we do not fuck with the haters or fakers at all
Believe that, it's your boy Lil B
Aye thank you BasedGod for the beat
Let's get it
