[Intro]
Yeah, it's your boy Lil B
Thugged Out Pissed Off Mixtape
We ain't stoppin'
We on that shirt, necks, all the way
We going all the way in
We gon' go all the way in
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Body suckers any day, never take my vest off
I'll leave you like prison work, crippled and paid off
Before you get paid off, get laid off
I fuck with Lil B, switching up like Agoff
I'm a real nigga, I don't play, bitch
I don't play with kids, extort you with the K, bitch
I'll rape you to make your bitch flashback
Whole time was hard, you not made for that
You not made for rap, uh, yeah
Being high as fuck when you approach me
I'm so raw, I don't even know me
Never, I'm like Kobe
Lights out, [?] but you don't know me
My guns like T.I. guns, Tiny ammo
Grand Hustle, all I do is serve young dro
Y'all shooters is blind, where your guns go?
Where your rap go? I'm the rawest rapper
Shout out to Kendrick Lamar, he blowed up faster
Shout out to Lil Wayne, ‘cause he the best rapper
You niggas skateboard now ‘cause y'all switch faster

[Interlude]
These niggas fake, man
Niggas be switching up, man
You know what I'm saying? Let's keep it real, man
Thugged Out Pissed Off, man, this the pain

[Verse 2]
You throwing parties, at the Gold house
I leave that motherfucker, it turn into a ho house
Don't talk shit if you niggas ain't 'bout that life
Threaten me again, bitch, I'll fly out tonight
Fake Based, getting close to me
I don't need goons, one man, I'ma go for me
I'ma, I'ma walk with my chest out
Head up, no guns, bitch, I'm feeling blessed now
You feel me? And my money low
Broke niggas going to war, I'm going up for show
Rich niggas, you better say your grace, bitch
Hating on Lil B? I'll turn you to a gay bitch
I never been gay, but I stayed straight
You ain't never copped no bags and pushed heavy weight
You ain't never pop no .40 and met E-40
Made it out the Bay, thank God for every morning
‘Cause niggas drowned in that water
Shout out to San Francisco, really, I'm like my father
I'm just like him, I'll leave a bitch too
But he love all his kids, and he work for his
Even if he wasn't there every day
He made it, we was all straight
And I'ma tell you why I'm thugged out and pissed off
Always tried to help my family, every way I could
Rob dope dealers, just for hood respect
If I can't go back in I wouldn't fuck with niggas
Instead, I set up niggas
I robbed crackers, put 'em in the mattress
I'm alive but I wonder where my partner's at
Made it, for real, we going up for that
We gon' meet one day at the top of the mountain
I'm back in the hood, where you found me

[Outro]
Lil Boss, Thugged Out Pissed Off, yeah
Going in, man, like I said
This the pain, man
Thugged Out Pissed Off, it's all about the pain, everything
You feel me?
We done came up
We done went through a lot of shit to get here, man
Thugged Out Pissed Off, support Lil Boss
