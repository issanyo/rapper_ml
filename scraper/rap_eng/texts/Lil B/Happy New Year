[Intro]
Yeah
Niggas ain't never give a fuck over here
Welcome to hell, oh my god, welcome to hell!
Evil Red Flame!

[Verse 1: Lil B]
You a fucking bitch, I'm a fucking mobster
Two bitches suck my dick, I'm the Godfather
Play around bitch, the nine awaiting faggot
My gun one four three like Bobby Brackins
Bitch, I'll resurrect you niggas
Ridin' down the slab, like a Texas nigga
Straight west side, I'm high and I'm feelin' shady
All the white girls love me cause I'm Carson Daly
And my gun's like Brad Pitt
And I fuck hella bitches like Dirt Nasty
Two guns in the vest cause I'm Mel Gibson
I fucked a 23, like I'm Scotty Pippen
Seven hundred bitch, my flow like No Limit
Young BasedGod still buy that 750
Young BasedGod still buy that MAC-11
Bitch I have the whole gun shop on layaway
Twenty bitches on my dick cause I'm Gary Payton
Thirty bitches on my nuts cause I think I'm Satan

[Bridge]
Welcome to hell bitch! Welcome to hell!
I'm Satan, welcome to hell, I'm the devil
Welcome to hell you fucker

Yeah right bitch nigga, Evil Red Flame
Fuck the devil nigga, I'm better than the devil nigga
I'm better than him bitch, swag

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I'm a killer, on a high horse
And my ego's off the Richter
Bitch I think I'm BasedGod senior
U.S.A. BasedGod, middle finger
Seven hundred BasedGod, that's a schemer
I got MAC-11's, that'll split you
I think I'm Forrest Gump, I'm a loser
So you know that I'm gonna be the shooter
Hating on BasedGod, you're a loser
So many bitches on my dick, I couldn't choose her
BasedGod the man, you're a smart student
Seven hundred Waterfront, BasedWorld
Wolf pack nigga, loud pack nigga
Lil B for Lil Boss, BasedGod
Evil Red Flame, that's what's up
Seven hundred bitch, I'mma throw it up

[Outro]
Evil Red Flame, I don't give a fuck, Evil Red Flame
It's better than Red Flame, better than Blue Flame
Better than everything, better than everything out, oh my god
