Real B town don't fuck around
Only real thugs run the motherfuckin' town
And I fuck with rich men cause they get it in
And I fuck with Sacramento cause they down to win
I got a pretty girl, from Vallejo
She's street-smart, and she got a fucking payroll
Real West Burban Jason Mask
Rocawear T-Shirt niggas know I'm 'bout that green cash
Bitch I don't got to explain myself
I done came from the dirt now suddenly all these niggas want my help
But I ain't never ask for this shit
Even when I broke I kept it low on the same shit
Now niggas wanna ride because I'm Based God
Niggas got me fucked up cause I'm Based God
I stay connected got a hundred heads on the block
One call, One shot like Chicken Pox
I wanna shout out you motherfucking busters
You fake gangsters, and You fake ass hustlers
You fake pimps, You fake ass players
You fake boss, I'm so real I should've run for mayor
Ho don't try to put me on child support
I got tested bitch I ain't the father
Bitch you a motherfuckin' liar
I hate dog hoes, Bitch I'm Reggie Miller
I got 20 on the motherfuckin' internet
I pimp myself I ain't never have to pimp a bitch
Now, a Nigga filthy rich
And I'm from the block all the way to the six
Shouts out to James Kennedy
Shouts out to Columbus, Canned food dirty with the hands
Black Flame mixtape, Welcome home bitch
I got the same plate
And I still got the dough ya
I roll the book bitch and I'm still a fuckin' soldier
If I fall I got a few rich friends
Took a trip overseas just to get ten
Shouts out to Tracy, That's my O.G
Real 100 and Mo' clean than a 100
Move like this, Move like this, Lil B one-one thousand bitch check this
Past games, I still Play-Station
Niggas mad I got played and I took a vacation
Niggas know I got beds if you wanna sleep
Just incase you sucka niggas wanna hate on me
It's deep

[Outro]
Yo, Yo, Rep BasedWorld Until I die, Lil B hate on me cause I'm from the streets
And I'm back in the mix with this shit
And I'm still with that hundred shit
BasedWorld a hundred thousand
Like I said, I REP BASEDWORLD UNTIL I DIE, LIL B, NIGGAS HATE CAUSE I'm FROM THE STREETS
And I'm back in the mix with this shit
And I still flip that new six
