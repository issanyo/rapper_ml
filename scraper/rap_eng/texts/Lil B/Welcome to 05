[Intro]
Do it for the 05, man
Real 05, Hawaii I love you

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my mixtape partna
Lip dope so good, you'd think I'm papa
My name Lil B, I don't feel these niggas
Except Lil B, Lil B, and the Based God
Put guns in your face like Love and Hip Hop
Love and hip hop is serving crack outside
I don't know you and nigga you don't owe me
Next time we speak I want more respect than Kobe
I give a fuck about your check
You can die in real life, you'd be broke and no money bitch
Go ahead and die in the Phantom, that's a rich casket
I'm a jealous nigga rappin', I'm a fuckin' bastard
You feel me, I had to get my rhyme right
I had beef last year, you hear the rumors, right?
Well I'mma tell you, that shit false
Can't slip in the hood, they knock your body off
24 nigga

[Break]
Shit get real on the other side, you feel me
And that's all I say man
Lil B, you already know what I'm doin'
They love me, you feel me?

[Verse 2]
I'm the rawest nigga to ever do it
Keep it real mo' 'den? No nigga, who den
Fuck 'em, but I love 'em, bulletproof protection
Feel like I got whipped in the game and it felt good
Fuck you if you don't understand it
In the hood every day, yeah I'm foolish, I be trippin'
But I'm so addicted, hallways that been pissed in
Billionaire livin' will never make me soft
I'm real 'til I drop nigga, 05 fuck 'em
That's how I feel and I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas
It's no Thanksgiving if Lil B don't pledge
Let me in the frat so it's off with your head
Based 'til I'm dead, nigga I'm here
Hey man, I never been fuckin' scared

[Outro]
It's Lil B, 05 Fuck Em, mixtape
Yes, let's go
