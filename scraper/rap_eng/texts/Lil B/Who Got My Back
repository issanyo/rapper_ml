I know somebody gon keep riding niggas motherfucker man
While I'm getting this paper at a time
I feel like people forgot me, I ain't gonna lie
Niggas will just forget about you

Go ahead, you could send me a kite
No lie, I'll be gone for a minute
I'm doin bad, like I'm shooting craps
Who got my back?
Go ahead, send me a kite up state
No lie, I be gone for a minute
Yea, I'm shooting craps
Who got my back?

Life get real when people could killed
Like this shit so real, this easy to deal
Like I'm gonna feel, live with pain like
Rock him on the strip man, nothing to gain like
Niggas gon bad and get back the same night
Blow a couple bags, get cass the game types
Stuck in this, fuck the paper man
How to rob a robber, I took the vacation
Looking down for the man you fight
Came with the sequel, it's coming with time
I'm just on my grind
Swimming through the past and this shit on my mind
Swimming through the path and this shit on my mind

Lockdown in my mind, treasure you find
Niggas steady dyin, I do it forever
Why the fuck man?
You feel me?
Man pump the brakes way back
Yea take a chill pill man, fuck that for real
Pay back is a bitch man, niggas could kill
Based thoughts man coming from the business gangsta man
I never been fake and I keep the paper
Go on the boulevard, see the paper man
Stick the move, now the stick
Freddy Slick man, I got the OT pick man
Tryina pick first, man your bitches 6 man
Pay attention man, you feel me catch the game
Shots on you bitches, catch them
You feel me? This is all that flame nigga
Catch the K, I'm slick dope

You feel me?
I hope niggas keep writing me again
I ain't gonna lie, niggas write me
Even though my mind be crazy
Niggas might say I'm the wild and shit, you feel me
I hope a nigga write me when I'm locked down
You feel me
Yea

Go ahead, you could send me a kite up state
No lie, I'll be gone for a minute
No lie, I'm doin bad like I'm shootin craps
Who got my back?
Go ahead, you could send me a kite up state
No lie, I'll be gone for a minute
No lie, I'm doin bad like I'm shootin craps
Who got my back?
Go ahead, you could send me a kite up state
No lie, I'll be gone for a minute
No lie, I'm doin bad like I'm shootin craps
Who got my back?
Go ahead, you could send me a kite up state
No lie, I'll be gone for a minute
No lie, I'm doin bad like I'm shootin craps
Who got my back?
