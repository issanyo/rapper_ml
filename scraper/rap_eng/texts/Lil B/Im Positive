[Chorus]
Baby please
Baby please
Baby please

[Verse1]
One time for the gutter

Too many brothers down I don't want to come up
If I come down how would I come up
The only thing I know If I’m down I’m going to come up
My niggas run up for sure my gun bust
My gun love suckers they always trying to bust nuts
No homo I bust crackers and I bust bitches
I pill a nigga cap leave his brain shitty
I leave you pissy all in the dirt when I disappear
I just let the trigger work I’m not Trey Songz
But I got bitches
Remember being real it never feel
Cross B might just go to hell
A lot of sundays acting like they can’t touch
I’m looking like the window of you in custody
Handicap rims in the spare tire
For real nigga I’m going to live my life
On the real-

[Break]
On a real
It’s Lil Boss you feeling me I’m free
Thugged out pissed off mixtape
Thugged out pissed off this is me
Lil B

[Verse2]
Everything happens I’m not scared of death
I’m just just want to be free never see a misstep
I won a lot of fights using no hands using no guns
Everything is a plan I showed a lot of love to my enemies
Fake friends trying to be friends with me you fucking fags
Got a heart of glass
Got a heart so big
I still fucking stress
Anytime I see danger I take a deep breath
I don’t plan to lose cause I got to win
But I lost before so how I got to live
Send my respect to the brothers
But I’m not positive
You living for the cash that's not how to live
I'm Lil B I'll show  you what your options is
Because of Lil B I’m positive
