[Intro]
It's all money, bitch
Come take a look at me, bitch
It's all for real, bitch
It's Lil B, it's Lil B

[Verse 1]
Everyday, thinkin' 'bout the money, thinkin' 'bout the business
Driving in my foreign car, can I get a fuckin' witness?
Every day, feeling like the man, feeling like I'm Diddy
Riding through the forest, then I ride through the city
Getting paid, everyday (sw-swag, swag)
Can I get a witness?
Every day Mardi Gras, ask God, my fuckin' witness
Riding on the Autobahn, no I can't fuckin' stop
Only day we stop turning up is when we fuckin' drop
(Drop, drop, drop)

[Hook]
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?
(Based God)
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?

[Verse 2]
Famous like a rockstar, respected like a rapper
My life's a movie but, no, I'm not an actor
Smoking big every day, can I get a witness?
Drink a little Vodka, then it's coke and Henny
Going out every day, can I get a witness?
Cooking dance when I turn up, and I fuck these bitches
Then Clams Casino, driving pass Reno
Keyboard kid with the money, gambino

[Hook]
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?
(Based God)
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?
(You know man all we need is a witness, you know what I'm saying?)

[Verse 3]
Big boss, call me big boss, call me Rick Ross
Fredo Santana, yeah I got the hammer
Yeah I'm army strong with that pink bandana
I'm a Navy SEAL so you know I get scanners
Call me a Marine cause my money come faster
She way faster, money up to NASA
Might be in Texas, I might be in London
Might be in Sweden, counting up these hundreds
Shoutout to France, shout out to Japan
Everywhere I go, man, they do the rain dance
Everywhere I go, man, they do the rain dance
Shouts out to Africa, shouts out to Japan
Lil B

[Hook]
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness? Can I get a witness?

[Outro]
You know what I'm saying?
Come check out how we do this man
Me and Clams Casino right now man
You already know it's your boy Lil B
All we gotta do is have a witness
You know what I'm saying?
Come check this out man, come see the business
Feel me?
Come see us with your own eyes man
Come see them with your own eyes man
You feel me?
Real based man
It's your boy Lil B, can I get a witness?
If somebody check me out
If somebody look at me
You feel me?
One time for the one time, man
Clams Casino we on it
Keyboard kid, what up?
It's your boy Lil B
Yeah, what's up?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get some bitches?
Turn up
