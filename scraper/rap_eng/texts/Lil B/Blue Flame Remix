[Verse 1: Lil B]
I get mad cuz the world don't understand me
That's the price I have to pay for this rap game
Everybody see the good, they don't see the pain
Like..when you struggle they don't see the rain
Analyze often niggas had to memorize
Like walking down the streets fantasizin'
Picking which thought like he looking out for houses
Playa playa hating that's just something I can't pronounce'n
When I'm at the top I will laugh at you bastards for doubting my emcee skills, I'm fantastic
This sounds like this would be a Jay-Z classic
Lil B classic
Jay-Z mash it
Phil you the best, where you going after passin'
I rap so many damn hours now I got presents
Listen to how I say it when the shit it's a message
I found that the true meaning, is in the blessing

It's a gift and a message

Seeing different things, it's a gift and a message

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Long hours, no sleep, no showers
All rappin', no grind, no slackin'
Street hustle, sell weed, pull packs in
Shoulda been a linebacker how I'm baggin' sacks in
New hustle, all voice, no ad-libs
All me, new dream, new package
Something like a new package how I'm gaining viewers
2010 key word is computers
Call me Donald Trump how I fire losers
How Donald Trump fire workers, I fire rugers

[Lil B talking]
Haha, ay man, listen I said
How Don-Donald Trump fire losers, I fire, oops
I mean how dire Donald Trump fire workers I fire losers haha

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Like Macho Man bitch but I'm Lex Luger
Glock 9 in the trunk, call it Martin Luther
AK bullets spray bitch I can't box

FUCK, listen, ay man like I said Blue Flame I don't give a fuck

[Verse 4: Lil B]
AK bullets spray, you can't dodge bazookas
Ask me why I'm cool, because I'm not a loser
But I know alotta losers and they'll bring it to ya
I represent for the people dude

Praying for you
My motto live life move faster, age faster
Didn't go to school but life keep me educated for the masters
Didn't go to school, but I passed life honors with a masters
Holla at me this a classic
Blue Flame nigga, off the dome

(Outro)
Everybody look out for Red Flame
Rain In England, coming out
Composed and produced all by Lil B The BasedGod, the BasedGod you'll never get a beat from
I guarantee that, it's way too rare
Red Flame coming very soon, download that, the second part to this to close the chapter
