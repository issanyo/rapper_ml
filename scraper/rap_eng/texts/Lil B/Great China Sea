[Sample: Lift Off - Kanye West & Jay Z ft. Beyonce]
We gonâ€™ take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?

Lil B
This the Great China Sea

[Verse 1]
Flyin over the world
I just live for
Great China Sea
The whole world need me
They was lost
I patched up houses
Put them back on the market
Get back ounces
Never had an accountant
I was to busy stackin and countin
Enough rap stacking houses
Look at me
I was broke and exhausted
Sleeping on floors, ugly as carpet
Now I'm on marble
Backyard awesome
Neighbors don't trip, we all got grip
Nigga fuck and around and pull out that sawed off clip
Have em looking like a fag
Cause we all split
I'm too much of a boss
My mind's on life
Nigas ask about the gay bitch, the rap game nice
Everybody want to throw that rice
Everybody be thuggin in the street that night
And I ain't be about that life
Bitch I cosign myself
I don't need no strikes
Ain't far from the hood
I can see that life
The difference between my raps
Shit I'm ill
And fuck what you talk about Nigga I'm weak
I just changed my new check last week
And I only make rap money
No crack money
No runnin in the house money
That sick shit
This real shit

Silent President

[Verse 2]
I take them to the top, rap is my life
Only time I stop I drop
Only move forward
Put your life on top
Always want to say when you go flop
I beg to differ, smoke right and write pictures
Reminisce, how I came from the bottom like [?]
In position, the ski mask quicker
But you don't want to be the soul that's lost
Grenades on they chest
They dying because there's no facts
Because they just dead
Now you don't want to that pussy I just fed
From Berekley CA, cowgirls getting bread
Put it on the beam and and the boof
A lot of niggas say
"Lil B, he's the truth."
I tell the truth, it's a code of honor
Forgive all the battles, forgive the hatred
One day we'll be sleepin in the same places
I'll see you again, exchange faces
Walk off with a golden piece
I got rocks in my backyard that look like people
Move crowds from the ground - Magneto -
Venice Beach chillin and saw [?]
Lil B - yeah, I seen them eagles
Let em free, let em free

Silent President

[Outro]
Like I said, the world need me
