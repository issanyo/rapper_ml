[Intro]
We not gonna stop from the top to the bottom
Lil B, mental, you know, niggas is trapped in prison
It's time to live our life, mental, physical, all that

[Verse]
Mental slavery, niggas be hanging off of trees in the woods
Like the hood, it's more than Martin Luther King
Fighting for a dream
Watch me go against everything you believe
They desrespect you tryna spark a dream
Everybody knows it's easy to fail but it's harder to think, think twice
I'm nicer than grandma with a cup of iced tea
You see me, I got ice like Ice
Serving them ice the same color small mice
Leaving my office, huh, he gon' pay a small price
My advice: get out of the game
They giving you chains, new car and they taking your chains
Never with chains, the chains fastened, I'm switching the lanes
I got away, got caught in the game
You always complain about what you ain't got
Third world countries ain't even got sidewalks to walk on
Two hundred people on the bus
And we busting moves harder than I ever thought
You never lost before you ever won
I never won, I'm still hungry, forever young
My soul hurt but I still move on, deep feelings aside
Feel like a clone, I'm trapped in the USA
Where work is your home, no work, ain't gon' talk on the phone
I've been born in the war, I grew up
I seen more ever since the twenty-eighth floor
Looked down, I never seen more poverty before
From the top you see even more, I fight for the even draw
Before you even draw I'm already gone
With the heat drawn, my gun like Miami Heat, you're gone
Focused like Steve Nash, I pick my brain apart
Thinking about breathing last
Uhh, s-see that casket
It's so close, it's like I'm a basket, go away
Step back faster, like your girlfriend just dumped him faster
Graveyard waiting, trying to stay away from the hating
S-s, whatever, fuck the locations
Trespassing, never close those pages
Never wanna cheat man, the thief's outrageous
Never been a bad farmer, if you put your
Heart in it, who gonna come up to you
I dare niggas to say that I'm weak, you uncomfortable
Waiting for everything, man, the people
Like me and you, we gotta get one thing together
And that thing I don't know
But peace is the first step, pepping your step
I ain't a drug dealer, I'm just a life liver
Like your liver fold like an open river
See between your eyes, I can see your pain
This is music for the ones that got away
If you ran away, hope that you stay, stay Based, you feel me?
Sss, for real, man
They try to take the real people
If you got a good heart treat yourself like the President
Cause the bag'll suck you right in
Want you to be in the grave right beside them
Because they got a cold, they want you to have a cold, I stick by the code
I let the story unfold, I say a lot of things, it's been told
I'm not scared, you asshole
At least I lived the dream, my daddy make the cash flow
Even if the cast goes, starts losing family
I buy back their lifespan with any type of money
You got one life: better live it
Can't be a leader if you're scared to make decisions
Living 2Pac and Biggie's visions, Lil B, I'm trapped in prison
