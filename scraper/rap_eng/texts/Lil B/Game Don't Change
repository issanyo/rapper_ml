[Verse 1]
I'm really from that other shit
I really moved pots and scales
Now a nigga doing rap and I'm hot for real
Thank God every day that he saved my life, or she
Cause I really don't see what you see
You try to be them but I just be me
I know you see me on BET or MTV
Yeah that's just B
I'ma get a Grammy yeah, that's just me
I'm a young nigga with the passion, passion
Show them niggas future with the mask on, mask on
Rawest rapper alive, I'ma speak facts
Please don't talk about those fucking rats
All my niggas is dogs and cats
Lions and bears, eagles and seagulls
Young niggas pulling guns out the regals

[Chorus]
The game don't change
The game don't change
With money on my brain
I'ma just get paid for real
The hate won't stop
But we won't drop
Cause real women won't change
And real men stay the same
We living, I got y'all

[Interlude]
Put your hands up for the world
All the real people in the building
Front to the back, you dig

[Verse 2]
I gotta tell you bout my real life
I was born in the struggle, it don't feel right
I'ma be honest, I don't wanna go to jail
If I do blow that motherfucker up for real
I don't wanna see 'em struggle
Free all the real niggas locked in the muzzle
Maybe a earthquake'll free y'all one day
Real niggas start to cry when they hear Lil B
Cause I just speak facts
Real niggas start to cry when they hear me rap
Women start to cry when they think about me
Cause I'm a young nigga and my name Lil B
You better check me out
I brought the waterfront in the drought
Shout out the East Coast and shout out the West
I'm the rawest rapper, Lil Wayne the best
It's Lil B

[Chorus]
The game don't change
The game don't change
With money on my brain
I'ma just get paid for real
The hate won't stop
But we won't drop
Cause real women won't change
And real men stay the same
We living, I got y'all
