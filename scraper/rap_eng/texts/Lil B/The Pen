Rare golden collectible mixtape before red flame mixtape drops
Where did the sun go
I am the pen
This is the pen, and this is real
As I picked up the gift from this rapper's hand
Three fingers touched my chest, my ink on the paper
Used again, married to the notepad
Stored in the backpack for hours, never have a choice in my life
I was made to serve, be preserved
Mad when they throw me away
Maybe I gotten old, my ink dries like hair turns grey
Got a bunch of brothers and sisters all in the package
Take me then you takin' the era
Black ink is looked down upon
Say I'm not good for contracts, blue ink is what they say is superior, like I'm inferior to my brotherhood pastels
I feel my callin', my cap is taken off my noggin
I think clearly now, suffocatin'
Ink is flowing through my body, infatuated with the bodies
The touch of the hand completes me, uh huh
I'm the original, computers move all fast and real writers Everlast and bloggers are my competition
Remember when there was no newspapers
My grandfather Bic told me there was a golden era
When the pen that was first created, feathers were on the top
Dipped in ink, my forefather told me that I'm lucky, we've come a long way
A lot of pens were burned in violence from outside
Not protected with a layer of plastic, and my ink is preserved solid
And I will serve
Lexi findin' the dutch bags, 30 pack in the hood, I heard his story
That the pen that was always used, never ran out of ink
Came from the East side
Passed through many hands, somehow ended up on the President's desk, he has a home forever
Passed down through the generations, I appreciate Lil B because he takes his time out, doesn't neglect me
Never forget where he came from
The iPads lookin' dumb tryin' to take my place
Was written as the Bible, which type is not reliable, pick and choose ya
Imma be a pen for life
Imma be a pen for life
Where did the sun go mixtape, golden rare collectible
This is Lil B
Shouts out to Pitchfork, shouts out to The Fader
Shouts out to everybody that hold me down
Where did the sun go
Based world to the death
Collect all my music, remember this is not based freestyle, this is rare golden collectible music, there's a difference
Lil B
