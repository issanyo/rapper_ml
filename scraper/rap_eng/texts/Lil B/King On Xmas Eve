Transcribing

[Intro]
Yo one time again
This my first sample beat
Yeah, you know
I just gotta keep it real on this Christmas Day, you feel me?
Christmas mixtape, have a merry based Christmas

[Verse 1]
Thank you for this lovely gift, your gracious heart
Work of art
Mozart, where do I start?
The Christmas tree is turned apart
The team needs the motivation
I think of you with fondness
And present forever
How do I express these deep feelings
I wanna tell you more throughout the song
But for the spirit of the holiday, let's pray today
Thank the Earth for what it's worth
More money than ever earned, ya never learn
If we don't expand
My role as a teacher
To help man
Plus the women for the offspring
Tired as hell from the forest dreams
I'm sleepin' on Earth
On Christmas Eve
[?] have a dream (Lil B)
Turn to the king on Christmas Eve

[Outro]
Yo what the hell?
Aye man, you heard that shit?
You heard that?
Why the fuck is Lil B makin' a Christmas tape?
I don't know
I don't know, hey hit this man what the hell
You hear this shit
Why the fuck is Lil B...
Yo, merry fuckin' Christmas, OK
Yeah yeah, right
Merry Christmas
Yeah, right
I don't believe that
Yeah I said it
I don't believe that, you don't like Lil B
You told me you don't like his mixtapes
You told me that
I don't believe it
