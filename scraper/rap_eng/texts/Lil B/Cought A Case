[Intro: Lil B]
I'm sayin I ain't trying to make fun of nobody, I ain't trying to promote no violence, but you know what's real?
Hey man: Dudes, and uh, females, is equal man
So I don't understand all these laws talking about, "Ohh why you beat up on the bitch, and why you beat up a girl?"
No. Bitches talk shit, and bitches get knocked out
Child support me, the bitch get knocked out

[Hook: Lil B]
Beat my bitch up, I feel bad
Domestic violence case, I'm so sad
I beat my bitch last night, I feel bad
Domestic violence case, I'm so sad

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Trying to child support me, that's a violation
Baby mama drama, no hesitation
These bitches act dumb, when you fuck em raw
I swear to god I ain't the pussy, I ain't ???
But check this: bitches act fuckin' so ill
Better stay out the pussy, make friends, and chill
But really, it's some solid girls
Shout out to the ones that's in they world
I beat it up because I'm so insecure
She say she wanna stay, but I'm not for sure
I think I might have some problems
Knock the bitch out, I'm so disgusted
She say she got some sunglasses, knock the bitch out
Oops! I'm sorry

Bitch I'm so exhausted
Badangdangdang ho I'm living off the game bitch

[Hook: Lil B]
I beat my bitch last night, I feel bad
Domestic violence case, I'm so sad
Damn, shouldn't have did that
I beat my bitch last night, I feel bad
Domestic violence case, I'm so sad
I'm sorry bitch, I'm sorry
No I'm not!

[Verse 2: Lil B]
It ain't my fault I knocked the bitch out
You should understand, don't play with kids
Don't put kids in it, you was living it
You love ___, man, bitch you will sip it
You got your head twisted, got the lead twisted
The court's on her side, let's pay attention
No money, don't worry, just paying attention
I told attention check, man, ___ the witness
You feel me?
All y'all bitches is tripping
I'ma send you a couple ho's on a mission
You feel me?
Fuck them businesses
Attention, man, I told you gotta pay attention
Stupid grades I put them bitches on it
You know what I'm saying?
Burning them bitches flaunting
You know what I'm saying?
All these ho's keep talkin, I'm gonna hit that bitch with a K8'er
You know what I'm saying?

[Hook: Lil B]
I beat my bitch last night, I feel bad
Domestic violence case, I'm so sad
Damn, shouldn't have did that
I beat my bitch last night, I feel bad
Domestic violence case, I'm so sad
I'm sorry bitch, I'm sorry
