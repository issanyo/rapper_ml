[Verse 1]
Bitch fuck me, I’m rich now
Came in the club, with the pistol
Fuckin where them bitches know to get down
Hey brah, you heard she strip now?
Gangster in the room tote the big strap
I’m beefing in the club with the long gats
Nigga I ain’t eat like I’m supposed to
Bruh hand that over, that’s pop culture
Brand new car, with the chauffeur
This thug rap, this real rap, 4X tee with the long gats
Bitches on my dick, bitch cause I run rap
Askin if I’m really down, man, the funk about erything
I’ma tell you that’s my name it’s Lil B
Put your middle fingers up if you feeling me

(Pre-Chorus)
Put your middle fingers up in the air
Task Force we don't care
The people on the rear
We gonn have a party up in here

(Chorus)
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid
Go dumb bitch, go stupid, go dumb bitch, go stupid

[Verse 2]
I’m a real thug like 40, at the Slauson Mall buying errything

Hey man whodie, shouts out to the whole LA
