[Verse 1: Keith Jenkins]
Yeah, they talkin' that shit, guess that's Martin on the wrist
Pull up with your bitch, take a sniff
Is he on that coke?, is he on that so?
Whippin' that work 25 pounds, nigga can't hide that, oh
And it stink and it stink, in the 5 chasin' cake, chasin' cake
Cake cake cake cake cake, my pockets straight
I'm talkin' 'bout that Opera bitch that like Rich and Lake
Keep no fuck with snakes, just keep it real
Don't weigh that benadryl and fo' real
Niggas talkin' 'bout that dope, whippin' that egg, no joke
Pull up in the muthafuckin' boxers and no new spoke

I just touched down in my fuckin' city, nigga
Got at least 100 thousand all in 50s niggas
Yeah, who want it?, We out here wit it
Young nigga in the kitchen, watch him whip it
Hol up, who callin' on your fuckin' phone now?
Hol up, who wanna buy another zone now?
Hol up, my girl gon' come back from that California
And she gon' pull up on ya with least 4 Coronias
Yeah hol up, Migos know my lingo
Shit, nigga shit turned this into a single
Take my talents out west, fuckin' wit the super chief
Then you cookin' with the best, yeah
