[Intro]
Why you so ice cold?
They ask me why I'm so ice cold

[Verse 1]
They ask me why I'm so ice cold
How I got it in my system, this shit in my vision
Based freestyle man, a kid spitting
Based freestyle man, this shit hard living
That's why I'm so ice cold
See people die how you feel I don't know
That's why I'm so ice cold
Because people that I grew with don't nobody know
That's why I'm so ice cold because they...
Look me in my face I can see it homie
That's why I'm so ice cold
Motherfuckers know the game goes how the game goes
That's why I'm so ice cold
Because the life that I live you gotta keep your eyes open
Cause motherfuckers wanna go in you gotta watch them

[Hook]
Based free

Based freestyle

[Verse 2]
Yeah this shit in my heart motherfucker icycle they torn me apart
How I keep thinking when they tear me apart
Motherfuckers wanna see me put me up in the dark
But I keep my eyes open I'm really smart
I can see you playing, see your heart
I can see through you I see right through you
X-ray television I see it's more view
Keep on the phone bitch I stay mobil
Keep chirping me I'mma have to show you
I'mma have to see what that ruger 'bout
I'mma have to sow your boys with that tool about
That's why I'm so ice cold
Hands to the nose, hands 'til you froze
Put gun down, hands where you go
Bitch, ice cold
