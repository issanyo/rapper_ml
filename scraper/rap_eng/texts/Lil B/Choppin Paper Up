Yeah, man, you know niggas put them choppas up, we got that shit rockin' up. Pretty Boy Music, you feel me?

So like I said, this that Pretty Boy Party

Catch me out in the hood choppin' paper up

[Verse 1:]
I had to play the game dirty you would never see it
Grip the scope and the Glock, let's talk Jesus
Let's talk how he played when a nigga see me
Niggas ain't like that I'mma ante-up
I'mma show the fast gain the slow bucks
In the hood niggas never gonna eat for nothing
I'mma make that rich nigga music
That pretty boy shit but he just where the roof is
Pretty young thug now them niggas going stupid
Copy my swag worldwide, let's do it
I'm the street baller bitch like the ruckus
And based God don't touch this
And this real line up

How I'm gon' eat when my nigga's dead
I'm paranoid every day nigga fuck the feds

[Verse 2:]
How you suppose to be a thug but you never do it
Late night with the strap but you never shoot it
Niggas come with the news like 10-4
Whoadie got bad vibes, what it hit for
Feel like he a sucker then I move in offense
Give me my respect or become a target
Niggas still going dumb and we drunken whoadie
Finna pop 3 pills and go hit a lick
Lil B on 5 and he talking shit
You can call me stupid but I'm dumb rich
Can't fuck with a lame or a dumb bitch
Fuck you suckers, I'm the one bitch
Flow like that, with the big strap
Down in East Oakland with the lumberjack
Me and Moses Music with the cd's
Tryin to get off a deal, pushing 5 for 3
