[Intro]
They can't live without me, like, I feel you bruh
I got you. Basedworld! It's Lil B. Yeah
You know I handle these bitch-ass niggas, know what I'm saying?
I push that line, you feel me? 05 Fuck Em mixtape man

[Verse 1]
I'll put a nigga right up under the mattress
The streets made me cold, I dont know what happened
Actually, yes i do, Imma murk that bastard
Not talking dudes man, I'm just in here blasting
This childhood hate, I'm gon' gas 'em
Put a nigga up in the pine box
He already drive a Lexus, but he died in that Iraq
Sell that Iraq, same color as Rick Fox
Dope so black you would think it's Chris Rock
Chris rock talk shit, then he get his shit popped
Like Cristal, watch my wrist pop
Don't ride with me, I be makin' the pit stops
Real thug nigga, my verses and my track hot
New York niggas love me cause I keep it real
New York stand up
West coast nigga what it do? I put the guns and money up
Where the roof is, these niggas so clueless
Everyday I'm in this fucking game like Snoop is

[Verse 2]
I'm still with the shit, I fuck yo bitch
I fucked the ho, ridin' up whips
Yeah, in Atlanta with the hawk
Walkin' the streets, not in the dark
Stores is closed, our store is open
Yeah, what you need it, I got it
Please stay focused, niggas stay smokin'
Put you in the casket, John B
What you singing for nigga? I'm watching suckas
Worldwide to the bitches, fuck you suckas
Ridin' up high nigga, 05 Fuck Em
Fuck you pussy niggas, you bitches love 'em
You niggas on my head, fuck 'em, you feel me?
Pop the Glock one time, I feel so special
I'm so fuckin' mad man, dude brought the pistol
Man I'm comin' up, comin' through with missiles
I gotta hit 'em with the sh-
The world goin' man, I won't play, nah
Earthquake compared to my fame
Comin' up
Takin' the game, switchin' lanes

[Outro]
05 Fuck Em mixtape nigga I don't complain
You know what I'm sayin'?
Based shit on these niggas, you know what I'm sayin'
Just, fuck it
You know, however a nigga goin'
You can go any way
