[Intro: Lil B]
Yeah, Niggas gotta crown me, You feel me?
Niggas gotta crown me, rawest rapper alive
Yeah i been doing it, know what i'm saying
Standing around these fuck niggas, still keeping my head tall
Yeah i ain't tripping off of none of these niggas
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I still push that old baby, old navy
GQ, nigga with the swag of an old lady
Fucked a couple of hoes, then beat I up my old lady
I'm really gangsta but niggas think i'm so crazy
Coming with the chop, better get back, what now
I still got bitches (ha), what now
And i don't think i heard those diss tracks
I'm riding through the Maybach, I got a song with Lil Wayne
And i'm unsigned you faggot ass niggas, so next time you speak
Ima handle that nigga, Ima short nigga with a tall bitch
And im a gangsta nigga with a square bitch
I love to fight fair bitch, but remember, i'll never be scared bitch
