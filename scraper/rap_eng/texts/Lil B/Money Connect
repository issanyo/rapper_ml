[Intro]
Aye Lil B man, you ever dream? I’m talking bout really dream
Yeah man you ever, you ever think about one day man you’ll ever be the biggest ever to do it?
Gon hustle today, man, my money gon stack

We gon hustle in the spot till the money connect, we gon hustle all day till our money can stack
It’s Lil B

[Verse 1]
Serving big papers nigga knowing I’ll cop the Dream later
I was thinking small till I seen niggas major
I’m acting like the old days when niggas was rocking pagers
Slanging dope from
Cellphone like a block with a stolen pager
I’m from the block where you getting money with your neighbour
You sit down, come back with spiritual greatness
It’s a new day and age peoples is changing

[Interlude]
We gon hustle all day till the money connect, we gon hustle all day so our money can stack
Fuck em, you know how we doing, one take
Fuck em, I hustle all day till my money can stack, hustle all day so my money connect, hustle all day so my...

[Verse 2]
Used to be scared of cops they was jocking the station
I was a young bull posted I was rocking the Station
They was looking all the while I was switching locations
I was thinking they was slipping, but no hesitation
Newspaper, channel news, wanna put me an example
Got the fuck handed by the shit in shambles
Taking gambles everyday just to make things better
Got a bulletproof vest with the .9 in the dresser
But that’s not life
To live you be playing on safety
A lot of people hate me, try to play me, that’s crazy
I’m pushing daisies, niggas be lazy up in the battle
If you worry about nothing, half the people lose their life for nothing
For things related to money, you gotta keep your head straight
They be taking your money
Laughing behind your back and they calling you a dummy
Pay attention, you gotta watch your friends, pay attention, this is money
Lil Boss

[Outro]
We gon hustle on the spot till the money connect, we gon hustle all day so our money can stack
Like I said, one take
We gon hustle all day till our money connect, we gone hustle in the spot so our money can stack
Ima tell you like this man, we dream big over here man fuck em, fuck em for real man, keep doing what you doing
We gon hustle in the spot till our money connect, we gon hustle all day so our money can stack
