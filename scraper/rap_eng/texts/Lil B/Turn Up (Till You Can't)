[Verse 1]
Summer time in the USA
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to do
But I'ma call my friends
Who is going out tonight
Yeah, me and you
Come on
Let's drive with the top down
Turn the music up real loud
And tell your boyfriend
He needs to let his girl out

Turn up till you can't no more
Turn up till you can't no more
Turn up till you can't no more
Turn up till you can't no more, ayy

Turn up till you can't no more, ayy
Turn up till you can't no more

[Verse 2]
I be coming through like a [?]
Everybody know that I'm destined
Hey girl, you need to twerk
Hey dude, you need to dance
Came through with the ladder in my pants
FM makes the gangsters dance
In here and I'm getting paid
I don't give a fuck, I'm getting laid
Tell that, what a real [?]
Keep it 100 and I fuck with you
I be like "ya ya ya ya"
Tell 'em that I got fire

[Hook]
Turn up till you can't no more
Turn up till you can't no more
Turn up till you can't no more
Turn up till you can't no more, ayy
Turn up till you can't no more, ayy
Turn up till you can't no more, ayy
Turn up till you can't no more, ayy
Turn up till you can't no more, ayy

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
