[Intro]
Lil B for Lil Boss
Pretty boys in this bitch
BasedGod
We in this motherfucker
Based, you feel me, westside nigga
Soulja Boy I see you, you feel me
Got these bitches going crazy

[Verse 1]
Pretty boys bitch shut your mouth
I'm a hunned thousand, twerking hoes like a pretty bitch
Young BasedGod, bitch suck my dick, ten four
Don't call the cops I'm cellular
Frosted flakes on my dinner plate
And I'm eating steak, iced out rings
Quit talking bitch you're not Ricki Lake
VIP estate, Cristal bitch
Got a black slut and a blonde bitch
Nigga I'm the man, yes I'm the shit
With the loud pack and the strong kush
Got a fresh line like George Bush
Nigga George ya bitch, I'll knight your ho
Nigga flight your ho, I'm first class
Pretty boy with that straight cash on a bitch
