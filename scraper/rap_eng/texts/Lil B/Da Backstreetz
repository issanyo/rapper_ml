[Intro]
It's your boy Lil B I got my gang from south Berkeley man
I got my gang from Richmond man
(Based God)

[Chorus]
I don't think you niggas know about da backstreetz
I don't give a fuck I'll pull up at the enemy
My eyes red because I smoke blunts
Niggas die every day I don't give a fuck

I don't think you niggas know about da backstreetz
I don't give a fuck I'll pull up at the enemy
My eyes red because I smoke blunts
Niggas die every day I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Niggas get locked up everyday
Crackers get shot up everyday
Free all my niggas thats in the cage
I'm feeling like I'm on stage
I'll never be a snitch if we in a raid
You should lay a person down for saying names
I never point the finger that's not a game
If you was a snitch you should be ashamed
I got paperwork for all my gangsters
I took an oath to the street I'm an 80's baby
You niggas really on here in the ground
I'm at foodville bought with a kickstand
I'm one up and you want up
Hit East (?) mall for the double up
Nigga I only state facts
Got the ladder and the drum, where the Aâ€™s at?







[Chorus]
I don't think you niggas know about da backstreetz
I don't give a fuck no more about the enemy
My eyes red because I smoke blunts
Niggas die every day I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I'mma keep it one hundred bitches no love
I'm the boss so you know that I'm turned up
Bitch you would of heard knock off your fam
Back there your kids on instagram
DJ Vlad keep your mouth shut
I don't do interviews shut the fuck up
Man I'm just trying to see a key
I cut the whole rock like Jay Z
I took losses as a kid but I bounced back
Yeah I'm still sick and I deal with that
Yeah nigga I'm a black man
Use to deal every car with a black hand
Everything that you not is what I am
I'm the son of Dez nigga like the son of sam

[Chorus]
I don't think you niggas know about da backstreetz
I don't give a fuck I'll pull up at the enemy
My eyes red because I smoke blunts
Niggas die every day I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3]
I'm about everything nigga even Jonesing
Pull up on my self nigga you ain't know it
I'mma go a couple places and take risks
I ain't got no friends nigga fuck a bitch
Keep it one hundred nigga you taking tough
But really it ain't nothing
What is it a blizzard?
I really got the game from these South Berkeley niggas
Feel me? But we rocking out the top top top like
Uh huh and we never did stop like
Shout out to rich men on the top like
Yeaaahhh worldwide we on top right?

[Chorus]
I don't think you niggas know about da backstreetz
I don't give a fuck I'll pull up at the enemy
My eyes red because I smoke blunts
Niggas die every day I don't give a fuck
