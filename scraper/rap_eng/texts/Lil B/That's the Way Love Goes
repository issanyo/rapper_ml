Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes

Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire
That's the way
Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
That's the way
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes
Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
That's the way love goes
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire (that's the way, that's the way, that's the way love goes)

Come with me don't you worry
I'm gonna make you crazy
I'll give you the time of your life
I'm gonna take you places you've never been before
And you'll be so happy that you came
Oh I'm gonna take you there, ooh
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
Don't mind if I light candles
I like to watch us play and baby I've got on what you like
Come closer baby closer reach out and feel my body
I'm gonna give you all my love
Oh sugar don't you hurry you've got me here all night
Just close your eyes and hold on tight
Oh baby don't stop don't stop go deeper baby deeper
You feel so good I'm gonna cry

Oh I'm gonna take you there, ooh
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
Don't you know
Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire
Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way
That's the way love goes
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
That's the way love, that's the way love, that's the way love, that's the way love, that's the way love, that's the way love
That's the way love goes
