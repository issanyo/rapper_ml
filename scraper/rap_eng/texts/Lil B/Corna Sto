[Intro]
What these niggas doing at the corner store man
Bout to hit that corner sto real quick feel me
See where my niggas at man
Feel me getting off these things at this store
We ride off the international at the east man at the store
Feel me we gonna get our rocks off we gonna get off everything we gotta get man

[Verse 1]
Everyday I step on bitches fuck em
Everyday I rock out zip the zips
Got five for the tip bitch I'm selling piff
Mixtape shit I rock up on you
Thugged out pissed off bitch I'm contagious
Got more shifts, underworld cocaine parties
With the president's girl
I rock in the corner all that dope up
I'm selling B's bitch this that Coca
Slow grind, and then I come up
I'm a made nigga like [?]
Still made niggas with the K or the Mack out
What's up bitch? I blow your back out
I love Hollywood but I love the crack house
Suckers see this fucking pain
Y'all bitches don't know this game, Lil B

[Chorus]
There's a lotta niggas at the corner sto
My niggas burning bridges selling dough
There's a lotta niggas at the corner sto
My niggas burning bridges selling dough
There's a lotta niggas at the corner sto
My niggas burning bridges selling dough
There's a lotta niggas at the corner sto
My niggas burning bridges selling dough
