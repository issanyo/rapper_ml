[Intro]
It's your boy Lil B, you feel me
Shouts out to all the girls, yeah

[Hook x4]
Girl when I want you, ain't nothing that I won't do

[Verse 1]
Met a fine girl on the Westside
Everybody know I'm from the Westside
She said I got a lot game, I'm from the best side
Bitch, I told you I'm from the Westside
Keep all my hoes on a thin line
Everybody know about the thin line (Figaro!)
Everybody know about the Westside
So why the fuck you ask me what's the best side?
Smash all my girls on the front seat
Domestic violence case don't want me
If you got money, put it on me
I'm stacking up cases and trophies
You already know fuck the *censored*
I said they not your homie
I said money, put it on me
Lil B

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
A girl that I love started hoeing
Now I'm thinking where my life going
Every girl wanna fuck me is hoeing
I never been a pimp, bitch you know this
So why every girl start hoeing
Wanna come around me with that ho shit
Asking me for my money and golden
Lucky that my nose ain't open
Bitches choosing up, that's ho shit
I need a real girl that's focused
Bitch thinks I'm a pimp for how I look
Stupid ass bitch, get that pussy took
Thirsty ass bitch tryna get a look
Fuck a hundred dudes then she write a book
Now you know that ain't cool
Wonder why niggas beat up these hoes
Feel me

[Interlude]
Hey man, these hoes tryna have fucking kids and never break up
You feel me, I can't respect that
It's Lil Boss

[Hook]
