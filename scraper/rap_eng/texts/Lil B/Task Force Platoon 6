[Intro]

Attention Task Force
All the Task Force we're back home
We're relieved from protecting Lil B and his music
Task Force, come on, Bitch Mob

[Hook: Lil B]

What you rep, I rep the Task Force
I'm thugged out, I rep the Task Force(Basedgod)
What you rep? I rep the Task Force(Basedgod)
(Task Force reporting in, and never checking out)
I'm thugged out, I rep the task force

[Verse 1: Lil B]

Long vibes I'm as plain as can be
Took trips down just to paint the street
When I rep Task Force I got guys by me
When I rep Bitch Mob the fire by me
I won't stop the world tour cause the mic is meat
I see the sun when I sleep because the light by me
I see dark when I walk cause the night it's in my feet
Daydreams of the earth put you right to sleep
I hit hard like him put you right to sleep
Pay hommage to base God when you're thinking sweet
Took the game ??? sweet
I got bullets all aim, all things with me
All pain, all things, all brains with me
Those chains, small things that we in the streets
But people dying hard because they end the beef
But I live my whole life to protect Lil B
Task force

[Hook: Lil B]

What you rep, I rep the Task Force
I'm thugged out, I rep the Task Force(Basedgod)
What you rep, I rep the Task Force(Basedgod)
Im thugged out, I rep the Task Force
Excuse me sir, I'm coming in to protect Lil B
Task Force representative, Bitch Mob, hello
I was called on duty to protect Lil B music
What can I do to serve?

[Verse 2: Lil B]

Boys you drive by as soon as is fuck
Is buggin chin the hood they give you beef
And they still park your car right out in the front
Take it to you down and they driving the front
That's life in the front, seen things I couldn't forget
Live a life that I couldn't give up
Well I'm in my zone
It’s like who I've been catching dimes
I'm coming down to the hole, ain't no block in mines
I keep the grind dopin, I keep my mind posted
Like ??? prime time
Did you see me in New York City, something like Diddy
Major love but you won’t get paper with me
This real graffiti talking when we paint the city
I'm driving down the wrong way would you be there with me?
Task Force don't leave, I see it in your city
Task Force who with me, Task Force who with me (Lil B)

[Hook: Lil B]

And umm I want to say it’s been one of the best things I could’ve done in my life
