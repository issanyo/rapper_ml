[Intro]
Yo, how we gonna come up today?
How am I goin' to eat tonight?
This world is a beautiful struggle
Just tryin' to find a plan to come up, you know what I'm sayin'?
Do my thing like Del the Funky Homosapien, spread this love with it
Thundercat wassup? How we rockin'?

[Verse 1]
Compared to my old self, yeah I'm winnin'
Got up to fall down, I miss Thanksgivin'
Can't take no trips, I'm stuck in the Bay
Layin' on my back, thinkin' about the next day
I want Lucky Charms, that little green elf
Tryin' hit the lotto, that'll make me smile
Give all my loved ones a money pile
Life's so good when it's upside down
Cause when it's regular, nobody around
Can't predict when ya come up, you just run up
Hard times come faster than a bitch that nut
When I smile I do that for myself and you
They can take my clothes, but not my spirit
On life's road, with these pavement lyrics
I'm still in the mix, 2015
Seen the ghetto, and I've seen some bad things
So much pain you would think it's a black dream
A long time ago came from black kings and queens
We mixed together, I'm not no slave but we lost the war
We can't give up we use swords to guns
Man up, bitches one on one
Got the walk of life, the shame is gettin' better
Seen the struggle, it is my brother
Doubt is my sister, gotta learn to love each other
Cause most times, we fightin' one another
Came up short, but my legs got taller
Failed a couple times, now my ego's smaller
Red Flame comin' the last chapter, I'm still alive, through the natural disasters
It's Lil B

[Hook]
Yo yo yo yo, one, two
I do this for you, I'm like one, two
Yo yo yo, I'm like one, two
I do this for you, I'm like one, two
Yo yo yo yo, one, two, I said it's like one, two
Yo yo yo yo it's like one, two
Yo yo, I do this for you
Lil B

[Verse 2]
If I see it, I know that my dreams is real
If I can't see it, bet I can hear the deal
Stuck between the wrong and the right
Lost myself, between the idea
Talkin' to myself, I see but not care
Askin' for help, I see it but it's not there
Devoted my time to the shit that's not real
Ideas are the things you caught me with
Wanna buy a car but it only switch gears
Material things, it got a nice glare
Fashion, you know i'm fashion
I get so many trends, I set back rappers
I'm tryin' to set up, I've been set up
This real hip-hop, I'm a backpack rapper
People talk shit, but not those actions
Can't fall off, you can't see me backin'
Had to talk to myself, a homeless rapper
Feel like I'm givin' up my body, tired
Too much, man pass me the lighter
Breeze is soft, walkin' too proud
You're outside, you're not inside, you fowl
Don't judge, from the others outside
Pain on my back, just the world's outcry
Twelves in my life, [?] for this
So much respect, you feel me?
This is Even Stevens
In my body, am I even breathing?
Young G-Eazy, I want a hook and a key
Knowledge of self, shit is greater than me
G-Eazy showed me he pushed keys to the White House
Black man in the White House, that's what I'm about
Forgot that, I miss the hood
Real hip-hop, just look
I don't wan't no chorus no more, fuck the chorus
Got too much to say this is all important
Swimming in the water, just trying [?]
Stones on my back help me believe
Today becomes yesterday I wanna be alive
We all got the time, we all got the time
It's timed slavery, just tryin' to confine
Everything's special, even in my rhymes
Feedin' your soul, every single time
Heartfelt rap, I lead the blind
So many goals just from not doing it
Try everything, don't be stupid
We all got limits, even no limit
Gotta aim for the stars, move past these gimmicks
Watch how you feel, see your pain
Tryin' to walk in the rain without gettin' wet
My Gucci raincoat knocks off the rain
But when I take it off, it's all the same
Pay 600 dollars for a tag and a name
What I really want, is to rap with the fame
Should I hate the player, or hate the game?
I hate both, I got options mane
People wanna come around when they sick
If you not sick, they just get so pissed
Keep your circles small, do I even exist?
I woman's soul deeper than an ass and some tits
People robots, you gotta flip the switch
And ask yourself, "Do I exist?"
It's Lil B
