[Intro - Lil B]
(They say old lovers can be good friends, but I never thought I'd really see you)
Niggas be hurtin everyday over this shit you namsayin feels like a nigga was just born into the pain but the days are so beautiful though

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
I push a little dope then I sell a little weed
Baggin up zips ask me whos a G
I think about mothers who had kids for revenge
Word to my dawg I never trust the bitch again
Niggas fake cry, fake tattoos fake pain real life
Niggas so crazy
Trickin off to the bitch man, you pushin daisy
I ain't met a nigga that can outrap me
Rap ziplocked, glad bags
Automat niggas push my buttons you get casket
You namsayin Im smiling in the casket
When I took them shots, niggas wasn't happy
Niggas played with that violation
Im tryna build a school, niggas tote caters
Im a educated gangster Im a gangster educated
Back and forth niggas stop playing
Its Lil B

[Hook]
(They say old lovers can be good friends, but I never thought I'd really see you) x2
What up Keke
Straight gangster shit nigga Im fuckin around nigga
You namsayin?

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
You let the court judge you
Whole court in public
You watch Im a star didn't think you know the struggle
Nigga I came from the gutta but my mindstate other
Could turned out like my brother
But I act like my mother got a spirit of my father
Hustle hard like my brothers stay real like my brothers
Met a girl like my brothers but my half brothers
I had some blood brothers that died no pain no crying
It just sits in my heart
Niggas out there, sitting in the dark
Wheres your friends? Im alone in the park
Niggas don't understand the pain of an only child
Who need a only child but you're oh so proud
Wanna stop for a second, niggas see me I was 14
Watching blood spill, forgive me
Its Lil B, holla at me

[Hook]
