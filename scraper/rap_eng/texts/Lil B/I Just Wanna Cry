[Intro]
RIP all the dead homies
You know, year after year, we lose one
But life not done, put your hands up

[Hook]
All my homies died
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry all night
If I get one more chance
I fall on my knees, I fall on my knees
Lord take me please

[Verse]
Now I miss my young brother and I can't believe he gone
They done took him off the streets and he can't go back home
I don't know about your life but know about mine
If you lost someone you love, put your hands up in the sky
Yeah, it's okay to cry, it just shows you that you care
Imagine going to heaven and you don't see nobody there
I be pickin' up my phone, they be calling me collect
Another brother up in jail, just some news I can't forget
I be walking on the beach just thinking about my life
If there really was a God, then why they take his life
My OG said "Everything happens for a reason"
They shot my podna in the head and they left him in the hood bleeding
Now, I'm just spreading peace and that's love between the world
If they take my life today just tell the boys and girls
That I loved everybody, no matter what your color
Man we only got one life to live
Just tell ya that I love ya, we did it

[Hook x3]

[Outro]
It don't feel alright
I can't believe, no I can't believe they took my brother's life
Lord, that's not right
I'ma fall on my knees, I'ma fall on my knees
Lord take me please, lord take me please
If you could see my heart, you know that I
I just wanna live, I just want to live
But if there's a God, then why
Why did they take my homie's mother life
Why did they let her die, why
And if there's a God, then why did they kill my brother on the streets
And then let that boy bleed
Can somebody answer me
If there's a God, then tell me why, just tell my why
Why do we have to cry, lord tell me why
I will not forgive and I will not give up
I will not stop the fight
No I won't because
It's alright to cry, it's alright to cry
And you pick yourself up and you dust yourself off
And you hold your high cause you're not alone
Oh no, you're not alone tonight
Cause we all know somebody that died
But I guarantee if you keep your heart going
And if you keep going, and you keep on rolling tonight
And if you don't stop
If you cry them tears and you get happy tonight
I guarantee you gonna live your life
