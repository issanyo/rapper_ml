[Verse]
For all you niggas talkin' down that fuckin' pretty bitch
Imma tell you like this, Imma show you who the bitch
Dude like me, I don't trip off shit
Bitch I'm in the rap game and you suckas on my dick
Rap niggas crying asking "Can I get a verse"
Bitch I'm young BasedGod nigga, I ain't got time
Bitch I got too many things on my mind
Shit's way fuckin' deeper than ?
Came to the club in that brand new Bens
Striaght off the fuckin' lot, bitch I dropped about 40
See Lil B and I hold that Glock 40
Nigga talkin' down on God but their bitch act naughty
Shouts out to gangsta ? homegirl ? bitch
Bitch I been on the block, bitch I been slang that sack
Now I got young girls suckin' on my dick
On that tour bus with a cheerleading bitch
No shame in my game bitch, I think I'm R. Kelly
Fuckin' with the gangstas, I don't watch Belly
Ten felon man, bitch I cosign myself
I don't fuck with real niggas cause they slaves off the shelf
Dude like me ain't a one man army
I ain't gon' beg you for shit, bitch I get it how I get it
I ain't gon' rob and I ain't gon' steal it
Bitch I hold myself boy, I show you who the bitch
Lil B the boss and that nigga is a legend
Straight Based World killer, nigga 187
Fuck around with Lil B, I show you lil heaven
Catch fade and I ain't talkin' bout the seven
I can get them other locks and a motherfuckin' blessin'
? man I teach your ass a lesson
