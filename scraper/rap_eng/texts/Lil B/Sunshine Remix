[Intro: Ant Beale]
Yah, yah, yeah, yeah
Yah, yah
G-g-g-good Work Charlie

[Chorus: Ant Beale]
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
I got some bitches in my life and they all mine
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
I got some bitches in my life and they all mine
Who made the beat, Charlie?

[Verse 1: Ant Beale]
I fell in love, with the bitches and bud (yeah, yeah)
Rest in peace to Lil Peep, I need to chill on the drugs (yeah, yeah, yeah)
She want some TLC, she creepin' cause her man is a scrub (yeah, yeah)
She always test me every time she hear my song in the club (aye, yah, yah)
Yeah, Sunshine, double plat-plat in the streets
Thank You Based God cause this a legendary remix (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Try to ride my wave I leave you salty and sea sick (yeah, yeah)
Told her bring it here and throw it back like a flip-flop

[Chorus: Ant Beale]
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
I got some bitches in my life and they all mine
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
I got some bitches in my life and they all mine
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
I got some bitches in my life and they all mine

[Bridge: Ant Beale]
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
Middle fingers up probably screaming fuck the one time

[Verse 2: Lil B & Ant Beale]
Lookin' outside and I checked out the weather
It's a perfect day to go hang out together
What you wanna do? I got them beach towels on me
Let's have a picnic 'cause all the girls want me
Why you actin' shy? I'm far from a phony
On TV, now everybody know me (everybody know me)
In P.E., 'cause I'm flexing on my homies (flexing on my)
Girls give me hugs, so you know I'm not lonely (girls give me hugs)
I'm universal, yeah I'm so special (yeah I'm so special)
Walkin' 'round town like I got a gold medal
If you wanna hate, water guns on your sweater
All the girls wear the cutest clothes in this weather
TMZ wanna catch us together (together)
You're just a hater, you're a- an MF'er (a MF'er)
Everybody jealous when they see us together
Put you in my pocket, we ready for whatever (we ready for whatever)

[Chorus: Ant Beale]
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
I got some bitches in my life and they all mine (I got some bitches in my life, yeah)
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
I got some bitches in my life and they all mine
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
I got some bitches in my life and they all mine

[Bridge: Ant Beale]
I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine
Middle fingers up probably screaming fuck the one time

[Outro: Ant Beale]
Mine, mine, and they all mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, and they all mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
All the bitches
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
