(DJ Afterthought, bitch)

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Land of the free, talking home of the brave
Yeah will you ball, will you ball with me?
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Land of the free, talking home of the brave
Yeah will you ball, will you ball with me?

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Land of the free, talking home of the brave
Versace on my chest when I hit center stage
Never been happy, been living in a rage
Smile on my face but my heart in a different place
Replaced with some ice, cold on my soul
Life unfolds, got a soul full of gold
Love in my heart so I bought Jody
Jody needed a brother so I copped Cody
Cody is my son, Jody is the one
Work everyday, got me living on the run

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Land of the free, talking home of the brave
Yeah will you ball, will you ball with me?
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Land of the free, talking home of the brave
Yeah will you ball, will you ball with me?

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Working everyday til my back start hurting
Flexing everyday like RiFF RAFF said
I don't give a fuck about no bitch hating
Say they talking down but they won't come around
Everybody know I got love for Texas
Everybody know I'm coming down in Lexus
How many days must I cry these tears?
If I work hard, I'ma conquer my fears
I'ma keep it real like BasedGod here
In a mini mansion, sleepin in the Hamptons
Bitches pay me cause I'm good at rapping
I know Lil B so I know what's gon' happen

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Land of the free, talking home of the brave
Yeah will you ball, will you ball with me?
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Working everyday, ain't nothing for free
Land of the free, talking home of the brave
Yeah will you ball, will you ball with me?
