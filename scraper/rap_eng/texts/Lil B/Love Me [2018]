[Hook]
I'ma tell you why these bitches love me
I'ma tell you why these hoes love me
Now I understand why these niggas love me
Nigga playin' wit' us, I'ma show him who we
When I swang my dope, nigga, turning a brick to three
Now I understand why these bitches love me
Who gives a fuck nigga, I'm rollin' one deep
I'ma keep it real, I love when niggas go to sleep
