[Intro]
Yeah baby
Jackson, I love you
What would I do without you, man?
I love you, baby

[Verse 1]
Boy, this to you, where my heart, really goes to
I know you're too young to understand what I'm going through
And I'm one soul, when your momma left
I know she couldn't wait for me to take my last breath
We can't be going on, nothing to survive
So every single time that I look in your eyes
I think about the street, the encouragement you gave me
I've been way too happy, yeah here lately
Days move forward, I wake up with a smile
I love you so much, I couldn't ask for a better child
I don't want you to think that your daddy's a gangster
You inspire my music, son I want to thank you
Every day I wake up to hear your beautiful voice
I know in my heart that I made the right choice
All I ever wanted was to be the best Dad
I know in my heart I'll lead you down the right path

[Chorus]
Daddy be there till the day that he dies
Every time you shed a tear, daddy wipes his eyes
No matter what you do, no matter where I am
Daddy always be there to hold your hand

Daddy be here till the day that he dies
Every time you shed a tear, daddy wipes his eyes
No matter what you do, no matter where I am
Daddy always be there to hold your hand

[Verse 2]
Daddy loves you, Imma show you that I care
Any time you need me, I'll be right there
When you get older and your problems develop
Whenever you need something, I'll be there to help
I'll give you the advice that you're probably gonna need
Whenever you need to talk, just come talk to me
How I learned the day, the day that you were born
[?] to say, that you are my world
When my days go wrong and I'm in a bad mood
I cheer right up, the second I see you
You're a spitting image of how I used to be
So I guess when I look at you, all I see is me
Is that a good thing, or is it just bad?
Yeah, it's a good thing you look like your Dad
I'm glad you're too young to understand all the pain
I apologize for your mommy, acting this way

[Chorus]
Daddy be there till the day that he dies
Every time you shed a tear, daddy wipes his eyes
No matter what you do, no matter where I am
Daddy always be there to hold your hand

Daddy be here till the day that he dies
Every time you shed a tear, daddy wipes his eyes
No matter what you do, no matter where I am
Daddy always be there to hold your hand

[Verse 3]
Every day I wake up, it's the beginning of the end
Now so much to say, but where do I begin?
Things might be different, if I was with your Mom
Have to remind myself, that I did nothing wrong
I just wanna give you the best life you can have
There are a few times when I feel I'm not the best Dad
Performing every weekend, it's taking time from us
There are a few times when I think I've had enough
But the music that I spit, is like my therapy
To help me from the pain that your Mommy gave to me
Cause I never know if she's going to be there the next day
I guess too many times that she's already ran away
As much as I hate your Mom, I just grind my teeth
I know you love your Mom as much as you love me
I feel so bad for what's she's doing, see
I know she's still your Mom, no matter what she did to me

[Chorus]
Daddy be here till the day that he dies
Every time you shed a tear, daddy wipes his eyes
No matter what you do, no matter where I am
Daddy always be there to hold your hand

Daddy be here till the day that he dies
Every time you shed a tear, daddy wipes his eyes
No matter what you do, no matter where I am
Daddy always be there to hold your hand
