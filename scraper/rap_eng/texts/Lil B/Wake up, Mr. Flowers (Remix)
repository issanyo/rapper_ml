Its the summer for the ashes
See the hot flashes on my face and my mindset
Have him take 10 feet, the street where the men meet
Even when they ten deep you knowing what they friend think
See him cross the stage, Now its cross the stage
Only time I crossed the stage was in Middle School
Now I'm walking across the stage for my interviews...yeah
Its Lil Boss better check the news bruh

[Hook: Lil B]

Wake Up Mr. Flowers! yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wake Up Mr. Flowers! yeah yeah yeah yeah
Check the news boy, Check the news bruh
Check the news cuttie, its in my brain
Check the news boy, Check the news bruh
Check the news cuttie, its in my brain

Only save my life if I'm gunning for the matches
Fighting for the cause see me coming with the Masters
Got bass like drummers, got syrup like Molasses
Only in the ring if I'm Cassius
You looking like food when I'm passing
I gotta a lose rape because you rappers so nasty
I ain't talking about sick and I ain't talking about classy
You boys is not classy
Your in a dumpster and you looking kinda trashy

[Hook: Lil B]

Wake Up Mr. Flowers! yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wake Up Mr. Flowers! yeah yeah yeah yeah
Check the news boy, Check the news bruh
Check the news cuttie, its in my brain
Check the news boy, Check the news bruh
Check the news cuttie, its in my brain

Time is the clock, but why time don't stop
Take advantage of your time because it's time to get gwap
Had a vision of myself, I was sitting at the top
Sometimes I don't dream so my vision seems to stop
I never seen it stop
Fall back like chiropractics never work where another man practice
Birds fly away, a lion sitting where he standing
Yeah I'm getting rich when I'm landing
If you seen me live, its a hell of a performance
Because I done seen diamonds being made from the torment
I can go back, but I never left the street
Just a bunch of mind games and the devil play for keeps
Thanks for sitting with me, being a visionary
Hearing about life could be kind of scary
My name is Lil B and I'm a legend like Perry
Every man in the world always been ready
