(BasedGod)

[Verse 1]
Put that cooler on the floor
Go senorita go
[?]
Move your body real closer
She be walking like a model
Shaped like a bottle
She's bad, she's sexy
What's up Monica Lewinsky
Trying to kick a field goal
We want a Super Bowl
I'm a rockstar for life
Got the hotel party at night
Might slide through Freak City
LA in the Bentley
Hey girl, what it do
Let the live band play for ya

[Hook]
Go senorita go
Go senorita go
Go senorita go
Go senorita go
Put that cooler on the floor
Put that cooler on the floor
Put that cooler on the floor
Put that cooler on the floor

[Verse 2]
Hola mami, she's a hotty
Out in the club trying to get some money
In the stripclub I be throwing hundreds
I don't throw ones, we got real money
Where you at, my car outside
Valet park, that's how I ride
Push button start, that's how I drive
Roll up a blunt, we finna get high
Where the weed at
Where the trees at
Who fronting me a zip
I'm trying to buy a bitch
We be turnt up all night
Don't go home until the sunlight
I'm Wiz Khalifa high
Shout out Mack Maine, I'm partying all night

[Hook]
Go senorita go

Put that cooler on the floor
