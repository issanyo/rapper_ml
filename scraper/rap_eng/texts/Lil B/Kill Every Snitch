[Verse 1]
Now I ain't a street nigga but I kill snitches (Bang bang)
I handle my business, that's my business (BasedGod)
I got goons that love me that be in their feelings (Feelings)
One foot outside, one on the mission (Mission)
I smack young niggas and old people (Damn)
Mini Africa, .45s and long needles (What up Africa)
We kill white people, not just black
You Asians get tacks and you wetbacks (We all equal)
Niggas get touch but I'm over that (Over that)
Bitch Mob Task Force, we on the map (On the map)
Need help in the streets, protect Lil B (Lil B)

Innocent people stay out (Stay out the way)

Ride around with me, I never snitch (BasedGod)
Bitch Mob Task Force, you can fuck my bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My OG uncle hit me from a mile away
My big cus hit you from long range
That's all I need boy in this life of greed
I do double life bitch for Lil B
Fuck with Lil B, you get that broomstick
5'4" nigga on that goon shit
145 with a .45
I make a short nigga look 6'9"
I'm a short nigga with big nuts
AK 69 with that flat butt
Guns like bitches, you gon' get fucked
Death to all snitches, you gon' get touched
In Oakland, most dangerous city
West Berkeley, still fuck with me
South Berkeley, still fuck with me
Richmond, Vallejo, in the under cities

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some people get killed before they turn 20
Bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow
I play shit, with them dirty bricks
Your family is a snitch, I could give a shit
Don't do the crime you can't do the time
Stay out the game on the sideline
Niggas start talking when they feel pressured
Tell on your own blood, you gon' draw blood
Still holding macs with them gold fully's
28 bitch on the Lex Coop
Still holding sticks with them short fuses
Yeah I'm still hyphy, bitch going stupid
Yeah I'm still mad about that foul play
Try that shit again, you gon' die today
Yeah I never snitch, blood on my hands
Lord please forgive me, I just killed a man

[Hook]
