You ever felt real pain?

I ain't sayin a nigga tried to knock my hustle
Bitch my door closed, speak in third view
From my eyes and see the world cold
But I look fine, but real courage is a bitch
I be judging covers, it's why I burned 'em
It's rain in my inner circle
Best be out, cause bitch niggas be like "take it"
Fuck that, and I'm speakin on a grown man with a young mental
I ain't in the game accidental
I made it happen, niggas [?] off the rental, still made it rappin
Only thing that I got is my pure passion
Move steps in the game, I'm old fashioned
I got the Dirty Harry, two barrel, old school shit
Shit, when you hold it man, you feel married
But I'm really just past these old thoughts of
Average ass niggas from the block, I'm past people's levels
On that mental, I still see the world outside myself
It's like looking at the game beside myself
For real dog
Niggas actin too crazy
Man

Believed in myself and no-one could understand why I had the glow in my eyes
From back then, I made mistakes
When I make mistakes, man I still back in
Heard my own soul bounce back like mac 10
Grip the mac 10 and they're back with no friends
I'm goin to war, cause I'm knowin I dont snitch
I was dealt a hard hand but I still don't bitch
I pray to God man, my life came to this
We had to close roads but the gates is open
Can't stop now til the top, I'm goin man
I love you baby girl, keep it strong
Even though you lost your mom, keep holding on
It takes a few years, we blessed with curses, so
Sorry that your last scene was with them nurses
I fell back, still love them churches
Cause the game... ... a vibe I felt worthless
I pray to the steps where good shit happens to men
Things happen man, it's way above rappin
My mind is connected with somethin, I can't explain, it's like I'm
In an organism, positive thoughts control the blame

And really don't worry about cash, cause you don't even gotta ask
We all connected... ... at last... ...
We all connected... future to the past
Look through the mirror, the glass, at the earth and the world, I see ya
(Yes)

I just be over their heads sometimes
Like I said, if you don't have no pain, if you dont know no real shit, then you ain't gon feel this
You know this is, one of the best, yes
(Ksssssssss)
It's your boy Lil B
