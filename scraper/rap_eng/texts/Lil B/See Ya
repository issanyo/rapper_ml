[Verse 1: Lil B The BasedGod]
Shout's out to Stockton
If I bust a sucka' head , bitch, I'm calling Johnnie Cochran
Nigga, I ain't got no love
Conversating on a murder through a phone, bruh, dude buzzin'
Don't tell me shit
And I have no problem with protecting my shit
Brah I still go dumb
You got me fucked up, you faggot, I will take a murder charge
With no hesitation
I'm so fucking angry, I gotta stay in my place bitch
Bitch Mob got hella bitches
Bitch Mob will tote them clips, Ya Feel Me?
I might have to kill my friend
And I keep it fucking real nigga, it's creep then a bitch
I'm the #1 Bitch of the city
200 grand show, nigga get with me
Man, you think it's a game
To the brain
I don't sniff cocaine
But I still get greasy
You don't believe me
You gon' see me when ya see me
And that's real off the top
I peel back a couple knots, I'mma serve ya off the block
Tell me what's real
Bitch tell me how you live, Bitch, tell me what's the deal
I Don't ask y'all for shit
That's why I'm on the block strugglin'
Bitch I'm Crawlin'
Popped a Viagra and I fucked her in the Mornin'
I Don't ask for shit
Bitch, you can suck my dick, and I Love Strugglin'
Bitch, It's respect from the shoulders
Bitch, It's respect from the shoulders

[Hook: Lil B The BasedGod]
Bruh, Locked up, I'mma see ya when I see ya
Bitch, Locked up, I'mma see ya when I see ya
Jaw locked up, I'mma see ya when I see ya
Stay twerked up, I'mma see ya when I see ya

[Verse 2: Lil B The BasedGod]
Bitch, Gon' respect this, I ain't bout' talking
Click on a nigga like a bitch, no cell phone
Brrrankdangdang with a strap, and I'm on one
Eat 1-4, and I'm riding, and I smoke one
Fresh out the airport, guess who's in Oakland
Stay with the kicks, and we call that shit Copeland
What you wanna do bitch, I got it for sale
East Bay magazine in my back pocket
Ho wanna play, Bitch, You know I got the rocket
Run now ho, I ain't even gotta cock it
Double barreled shotgun, always in Oakland
Sawed off shotgun, always be in Oakland
Dirty Harry, Man, always be in Oakland
Pea-shooters, Man, always be in Oakland
Automatics, got the game wide open
Stay with the thang, Man, BasedGod jokin'
I ain't jokin' bitch, ain't nothing funny
Yeh, Yeh, Yeh
Shouts out to my nigga's worldwide, we stupid
