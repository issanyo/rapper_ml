[Intro]
Yeah yeah. 9th Wonder. A lot of these motherfuckers really just be changing so heavy. You know the hood ain't ever gonna be the same my nigga. Real talk

[Verse]
Never be safe around these hating niggas
Never thought I'd see the day the whole script changed
Thought process [?] walking around here sleeping
Somebody give him a casket to sink in
Play defense the best, the best reside right above my pelvis
Sucker shit to death
Now I'm fighting for a purpose, watching my step
My gut tell me you a bitch
Word to God I never asked for money
When I work so hard
Say no nigga look at me funny
How bout two years before you was calling me dummy
And I'm moving wrong
I knew I was right all along
A lot of pain in my heart from the backlash
Close contact with the hate
No fake with me
Playing fort like [?] almighty BasedGod figure 8
I just skate

[Outro]
Yeah, you know 9th man I swear. The hood man it's changed. Shouts out to old hip-hop, new hip-hop. 9th Wonder I see you
