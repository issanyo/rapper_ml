[Intro]
Yeah, I'mma tell you one thing about Lil B
You feel me, he keep it solid to the bitch, you already know, man
Repping bitch mob everyday, man
Like I said pretty boys, ten toes down, tiny shirts and everything

[Verse 1]
Rep the bitch mob, it's motherfucking hater
I stay with them bitches, tell Doug, I'll see you later
Motherfuck them drugs, I'm staying high as my capers
I rep for my family worldwide, I'm talking paper
Still fucked up and I'm still crossed over
And I'm still rolling purp, I don't know if I told you
In your pocket, bitch, like a napkin
Shouts out to Berkeley, finna get shit cracking
Bitch fucks with me, you know she get skinny
Bro talking like that, finna leave him like Kenny
Damn, I felt the struggle, damn, I feel the hustle
Nigga hating on me? Bitch, you hating on your brother
Come from the motherfucking top, I blew it
Take that jackpot, you know my niggas come stupid
Riding around town, you know that I do it
Bowflexing Master P, four deep, no limit
Niggas mad at me? Bitch, you better be pacific
Bitch, like jokes, nigga, I don't get it
Still baseworld and it's still goldhouse
Keep it so based, leaving bitches in the house
Understand this, I'm the motherfucking man
Shows in Tokyo, shouts out to Japan
Shouts out to Osaka, top flight, big bitch
In the fucking club, and she educated, g
You know how I eat, you know when I'm coming in the room
Bitches fall asleep because they know I'm coming through

Yeah, man, they call me Dr. Doom, you know why? Because I'm shocking bitches, you feel me?
