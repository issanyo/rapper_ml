Niggas don't wanna hear that fake ass shit

They wanna hear fuck you and your bitch

Niggas like me we don't even trip

Why do fake niggas even exist?



[Verse 1]

That's a real big question that's in my life

Why do niggas wanna hear about the pains in life
Why a nigga wanna hear about the dopin' price
When he still in high school takin' notes at night

Takin' notes all life, take a lil advice

It all starts from your friends, some wrong some nice

Go the right way, some move at night

Some have to fall down to get back up twice

Everybody ain't family, some people don't got family

The world make you family, shit make you crazy

But you a stronger person

But niggas always wanna hate when the next one workin'

Why a nigga wanna hear about breakin' bitches

The earth, gonna give you forgiveness

I'm a little spiritual but a real nigga

Keep it positive is that what you wanna hear nigga?

[Verse 2]

Niggas ain't gangsta what is a gangsta

It's all from the movies being rose you ain't bruh

You wasn't born like how you living a game bruh

This is not third world, you ain't living the same bruh

People really poor in the united states bruh

And I feel your pain and I'm seeing your anger

Can't really feel cause the cards are different

But it hit close to home like the bass was shifting

Put yourself in another's position

High prices, bay area livin'

Tryna keep up and yeah, stay outta prison

Tryna stay out the game that's the only mission

Key word it's a game no words is missin'

Really wanna win just to change your positions

Gotta see life, be happy that you livin'

Stay positive and pay attention, Lil B
