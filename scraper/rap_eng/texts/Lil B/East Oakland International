Still in the cuts with the money on the frontline
My life's so real it's somethin like drumline
Your hear that bass..  thats for the streets
Argh he sell a little weed, thats enough for me to creep

Burglary; it might turn into a raid, I need that mother fucking cake
I dont celebrate, my birthday is the worst way if they still rap
It must be birthday
Cause I keep getting presents or maybe its Christmas I got trees.. in the ceiling, you know what im sayin..
Catch me on international thats my other traphouse, i buy pussy from the bottom and i'm up 50 from the crackhouse..

They stole my swag and they.. went Pop...
I might have to go Pop, Your trendy
The only time that I shop, is when i'm talking bags
Or when i'm talking blocks

Literally; I'll serve your fucking block, I meet bosses..
That ship off orders. I meet bosses that front off money
You need a mil? Yeah! Bitch fuck with me!
You're thirsty bitch, I'm talking bout a dinner plate
I'll smack you bitches and i'll smack the dealer

I came from the crack bitch, ask yourself who realer?
If we really got beef, I do no mask killin' I'm my own bodyguard and i'm my Own J Simpson. I'm my own Al Capone and bitch i'll definitely go get em'

Give up my seat, but I can't stand snitchin', won't fuck me in my ass, cause I'll kill your bitch ass
Got a lot of hate and pain, I wonder where that sprouted from?
Most dudes you know like me; You know they outcome

I got a lot of problems, so i smoke blunts, I (don't) give a fuck about a charge, nigga its waterfront. West Berkeley! Yeah
Down to South Berkeley, I push that line up, every time that i grind up

Bang! And make sure that my soldiers line up
Because everytime i open up them blocks i want them lines up
