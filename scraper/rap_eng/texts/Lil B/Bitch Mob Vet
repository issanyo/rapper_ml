[Intro]
I'm coming up bitch, I'm doing everything
I got a lot of billions, going for the millions
Billions, millions
Coming for the fucking dough
Swinging the fucking door every fucking day

[Chorus]
Bitch Mob nigga I'm a vet
(Mhm you know it)
And we won't tolerate disrespect
(Nope, no we won't)
Nigga play with us, be ready for death
Protect Lil B all I rep
(Fuck 'em)

[Verse 1]
Yeah I protect Lil B
Might come in with that extra on me
Niggas playing with us that's the shit I can't see
Understand I'ma live for Lil B
Rich nigga shit, I'ma die for Lil B
I never take the stand, allow Lil B
Ride Rolls Royce money on the seat
Nigga play with us, got the fucking beam
Niggas don't know I got private jets
These bitches sucking dick for clout and respect
You niggas don't know I got a hundred million cash
We duct tape bitches and fuck 'em in the ass
We duct tape niggas and make 'em run the bag
Bitch ass nigga we know where the stash
I love Lil B, BasedGod that's my dad
Rich nigga shit, BasedGod is my dad

[Chorus]
Bitch Mob nigga I'm a vet
(Mhm you know it)
And we won't tolerate disrespect
(Nope, no we won't)
Nigga play with us, be ready for death
Protect Lil B all I rep
(Fuck 'em)

[Verse 2]
Nigga better make way for the OG's
Every nigga around me love Lil B
I got niggas ready to be crash dummies
I got niggas that don't want no money
I got niggas that cry and they love me
When it's beef I hug niggas and I love 'em
No homo, I get mad and I fuck 'em (What?)
I'm the big boss nigga, I know Klay Thompson
I know Nick Young nigga and they love me
Playing with me nigga, you know I'm a kid
Riding new Bentley nigga and it gave me chills
Parked the Rolls Royce in the motherfucking Hills
I know E-40, I know Mack Maine
I know Lil Wayne, I'm a rich nigga
Everybody know I rep the Bitch Mob
Everybody know I love the BasedGod
It's Lil B

[Chorus]
Bitch Mob nigga I'm a vet
(Mhm you know it)
And we wonn't gon' tolerate disrespect
(Nope, no we won't)
Nigga play with us, be ready for death
Protect Lil B all I rep
(Fuck 'em)
