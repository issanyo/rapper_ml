[Verse 1: Lil B]

Damn its drama, I'mma tell you what it be (What it be)
Nigga I sucked the ho's pussy and I licked that bitch for free (mmm damn)

Fuck a ho in the ass and Im digging for the gold (mmm Damn)
And she asked about the flow, bitch you know you're too young (Damn)

Fuck what you heard bitch, and I ate the ho ass (Damn)
And I came out the water like the Loch Ness Monster
Nigga chewing on pills, bitch you know who did it
And I'm down for the black, bitch you know who did it (Basedgod)
