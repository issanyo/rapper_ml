Call me Katy Perry (x8)

[Verse 1]
Smoke a lot of weed and I blow on Mary
Play the game so fucking hard selling Jerry
I sell so many Jerrys, fuck bitches out of feddie
At the players ball, Based God need a Grammy
Bitches want to fuck the Based God
Swag to the A 5, think I kissed a girl
I kissed her in the face and I told a bitch look
I know the Based God and I deal with straight cash
I might sell a Jerry if I pull it out the bag
Get out my face, ‘cause I got a lot of swag
Ride around the town with a girl on my dick
Thank you Based God, she fucked the pretty bitch

[Hook] x2

[Bridge]
Katy, baby, what it do?
Oh yea, shout out to all the girls that kiss girls, what it do?
Yeah, man, like I said, it’s ya boy Lil' B
I’m an American superstar
Yeah shoutout to America, ya feel me?
Yeah feel me? A lot of bitches, worldwide

[Verse 2]
I know the Based God that’s a fact (You do)
I got a bad bitch and she sitting on my lap
Ho sit down like Maceo said
Juke, ya boy, juke, juke, ya boy (Based God!)
Fucked a bad bitch and she knew, ya boy
Still serving Jerry like I came out of Richmond
Still serving Jerry and I play my position
Play my position, ‘cause I still trip on bitches
Strip club love me, I buy pussy and the strippers
Pussy all free, courtesy of me
You bought 5 bitches, I bought 15
I trick on bitches, cause my name Lil’ B
