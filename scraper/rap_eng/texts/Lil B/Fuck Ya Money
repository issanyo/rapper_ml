(Intro)
Yo how much money you got? You know that shit don't matter. You know we thuggin' on the block heavily, you fee me? I'm going all the way in

(Verse 1)
I won't poach ya
Approach ya
Like a poach
Then crush ya ass
Like a sof...
I won't move
If I like your sof...
But I will move
And I might demote cha
But if I try to work hard than I might
Promote cha
Sometimes I even think when my life is over
But I try to not to think about life when i'm sober
But still my money stretch out like aerobics
I rep the...
Who are you to judge me
Some people say I'm fresh like dougie
Respect that
4'5 pistol whip make your head crack
And niggas wonder why I still don't push dope
I still push dope
My verses like good crack
Niggas fast like a speedboat
Sit in the dark
Hide your face like a reject
Shoot up the school and the park
Like a reject
You Bitch

(Chorus)
Keep it thuggin'
Yeah
Fuck ya money nigga Motherfuck ya money Ya feel me Fuck ya money man Motherfuck ya money Fuck the money man Motherfuck ya money Fuck ya money

(Verse 2)
My momma said never show you pain starts
So I try not to cry I just mug niggas
I got a brother
And niggas that I care about
And I give a fuck
And I know that I give a fuck
I give a shit
And you lames be quiet
As long as I don't hear you speaking
Shut the fuck up
I lost family from way back
I Start to think
It is safe to move slow creep
I don't know but I still move cautious
Eyes move right to left get nauseous
I say I'm the best and I feel flawless
Half of you niggas don't speak you look jawless
If you can't afford this, yeah I bought it
When I talk to them kids man they listen
When I see yo name I picture pictures of bitches
Niggas with no brains asking me for forgiveness
It's Basedgod!

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Niggas talk like I'm a rap preacher
Giving bitch niggas wisdom
Niggas have no business
Hating over the beef
Beat a nigga ass
Then I explode 23
And when I talk
OG's man they give me knowledge
Teach ya how to kill a nigga
Sweating no problems
After you drive dude off
Body go dissolve it
Make sure you squeeze his mouth
Ain't no screaming, Ain't no hollering
Yesssss, feel me
And I thought you was a gangsta man
Suppose to live forever
Played the game smart man
You wear your vest and your sweater
And watch you goes in your life
Cause they hate gonna follow
My goal was to get your shit
And choke your father
I have no conscience
Auntie crying no bother, shut up
Bleeding, Screaming
I'm wanna you mila niggas
You feel me, Y'all ain't got a father
Follow me

Fuck ya money, Fuck ya money, Fuck ya money
