Ay, bruh my homeboy doin life
(I'M DOING LIFE, I GOTTA DO A FIFTY YEAR BID AND I AINT NEVER GETTING OUT)

I learned about myself when I was facing 36
And I really not knowing I was caught up in the mix
Everybody thug life and I didn't even know it
I was out in the hood trying to survive with the homies
But my niggas act shady, I had to click up
I was bossing in the hood starting cliques up
Most niggas from the set, railroad, and got stuck
I prayed all my life, something seem right
Even through all the bad, I made it through those fights
Escaped kidnapping and bullets at night
And we wasn't trying to fight cause I seen niggas die
You gotta be more than in the jail cell fryin
Escaped 36, hate on nobody
Cause what I went for I wouldn't wish on nobody
Everything I done you would've seen me at 30
Getting out the cell mane that's way too early
Niggas doing 15 and got the time too early
Have you doing 30 years, you're not even thirty
Pray for the people that's shady and looked over
No family support, no friends to come over
Now I can see the anger that you're holding
Nobody taught us we all men
I was raised by a woman, so my emotions is all in
I got my dad stressed, I'm taking it all in
Lil B

Ima put one in the air for my loved ones

I feel it over the world, the pain I caused
We all make mistakes but the option is yours
I gotta feeling about the drugs in the floor
I gotta get out the game I don't want no more
I want no war, when you thuggin in the game you dont never win
The police waiting for you and so is them lawyers
The DA trying to say your life ain't gorgeous
Paint on my face like I'm in the circus
Hook me up with the circuit I gotta put work in
A lot of niggas feel worthless when they not working
Life, put stress on you like they do with them curtains
Uhh, one thing and I am for certain, dont shut down your heart
Just keep on learning, most people never been fucked like they a virgin
This is my life, this is my version
And I wish everything on earth was perfect
But everybody we all perfect, you gotta love yourself
Even when your plan not working
Or get cut back on your earnings
Most people won't retire, they just keep on serving
Walking down the streets like they do in Berkeley
Gotta keep my eyes open with a based prayer
A lot of things will never be fair
Deal wit it, Lil B

I don't know man, Rawest rapper alive
That's all I'm gonna say
Crime fetish mixtape
Yessssss
