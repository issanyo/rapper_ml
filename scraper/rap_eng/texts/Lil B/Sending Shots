[Chorus]
Sending shots, to your head
All day, it's the Pack
I don't care, if you're dead
Sending shots, to your face

[Verse 1]
It's that young new, cold spitter
I got hot, now I spit live-r, you niggas need to get live-r
You Jank-head-ass niggas, pussy like vagina
And still cause problems, you need to stop rhyming
Comin' on my turf, thinking that you're Ali
Twelve o' clock hit you, you'll be sleeping with a IV
I'm B, Poison like ivey, Rhyme 3
Spit 6, niggas think the pack sick, try me
I got patches, and I ain't stop smoking
I stopped smoking, sippin' on sizzurp and I'm focused
You need bifocals to see my vocals
I'm like bicoastal, or maybe tricoastal
Biracial, hoe white like Kosher
Seem like food and I'm hungry like a vulture
Now I'm rap star, people steady coming closer
But the Glock leave your head stuck to walls like a poster, nigga

[Chorus]
Sending shots, to your head
All day, it's the Pack
I don't care, if you're dead
Sending shots, to your face
Sending shots, to your head
All day, it's the Pack
I don't care, if you're dead
Sending shots, to your face

[Verse 2]
It's the drummer boy without the bass, without the snare
Give me stares, and I might just cut your face
You act hard, but you really just flaccid
I use cuss words, call you ass and a bastard
You rappers need work, well, start bagging plastics
Cause when you on the block, you get watched like dancers
Bullets spread over your body fast like cancer
Now you in the sky like Pisces and Cancer
Now I got hate mail, no need to answer
Cause when you write back, you put it up for a ransom
I know y'all think he's me, but he's pretty handsome
I been crossed over, I'm the answer, you get me?
I read a couple of minds and your whole life story
How your's is just whack and your man's is just boring
Deep in my eyes you can see beyond glory
You see my mother, the Pack, and rap is my loyalty, nigga

[Chorus]
Sending shots, to your head
All day, it's the Pack
I don't care, if you're dead
Sending shots, to your face
Sending shots, to your head
All day, Wolf Pack
I don't care, if you're dead
Sending shots, to your face

[Verse 3]
Freeze the beat man, check me out
I'm speaking heat man, niggas gotta get me out
Up out the oven in the zone where the speakers mount
The mic above me, the mic's are lovely, sometimes I want to eat it out
Like Ying Yang, skeet skeet all on the beats
Your girl a freak, that's why she wants to dig me out
But fuck a freak, I'm steady with my ass shit
Fuck a paper up, bust a skut on the ad libs
It's front boy going dumb, who is that kid?
Wolf pack bars boy, he spitting mad kid
Gotta thank my nigga L for Affirmative Action
Cause know, I'm the two, and it's no need for asking
Mix my perc, pass the time, blowing on my stashes
Got new swisses, Apple right under the mattress
Lost no matches, fight like I'm Cassius
Killing off the beats, that's why I ordered caskets, nigga

[Chorus]
All day, it's the Pack
I don't care, if you're dead
Sending shots, to your face
Sending shots, to your head
All day, it's the Pack
I don't care, if you're dead
Sending shots, to your face

[Outro]
That's a no-no, nigga (issa no-no, nigga)
Fuckin' with me that's a no-no, nigga (issa no-no, nigga)
Fuckin' with L that's a no-no, nigga (sending shots, to your face)
Uno, stuntin'
I see you niggas (Wolf Pack)
It's the best to be, baby (It's the pack nigga)
And I'm loving it (It's the pack nigga)
Welcome to the front, nigga, of B town's greatest. Signing off, man I gotta sing with y'all on the mic, you feel me?
