[Intro]
It's stories from the hood, that keep my life good
If you really thugging put your hands in the air
Yeah man it's ya boy Lil B Pink Flame mixtape, you feel me?
We gettin' to that, we’re making history every fucking day

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Pussy get left cold, niggas on cold ice
Sliding through the hood with the heat on the cold night
Staying on the mission, under handy, so nasty
Can’t stand em, little boss, stay with the handle
Niggas hate on me, but I had to dismantle
Open up like a sandle, bring the heat like a candle
Used to be the dude that really couldn't handle
How I couldn't handle when my life was a gamble
Shout out to Leron, my nigga from the west
I’ma tell you bout me, my life, the stars
I've been bruised and scarred, back to living large
Big smoke better cause, fake bitches, better broads
I thought I’d go broke, but I’m still living large
You have a foundation before you become a star
Niggas getting mad when I’m coping new cars
And dumping old bitches, and shit on hater broads Lil B

[Dialogue]
This real thugs stories, this is all from the hood
Do you feel me like I said, man Pink Flame this is bringing back memories
For the real motherfuckers that’s in it, you know this
Drive through your whip right now man
I see you sliding through China town

[Verse 2: Lil B]
This shit crazy, trying to be a soldier
Hopped on the field, but you got ran over
Lion to the guns, got lions to the guns
You feel me, that's just like gold
Choppers in the street AK's is getting sold
You be playing with the nines na bruh them kind of old
Bro cross the line, now the story unfold
Everybody in the woods, another story untold
Continue to grow and spread love, do whatever a thug does
I guess that’s me showing love
Niggas acting like they ready for action
I’ve been thuggin’ like Clifton when he was banging actin'
Wider streets, now my family started rappin’
Niggas try to play me, niggas catch the gas
I’m the rawest in the game and I won’t be last
Bitch respect my mind, I get paid straight cash Lil B
