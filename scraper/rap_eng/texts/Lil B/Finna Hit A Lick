[Intro]
6 Kiss
Nigga I'm hitting licks nigga
All you bitch ass hoes nigga

[Verse 1]
Went to his house and you know I'm taking everything
Early morning driver, stolen car, smoking Mary Jane
Bruh think I'm flexin' cause I'm talking like a big shot
Bet my young ass show him money he ain't never got
Told him like this "I don't care, do you give a fuck?"
Hit a few liquor stores, you know I ain't paying nothing
Don't pay shit cause I'm robbing like a Jay Rock
Robbing like a dope fiend, even take the wristwatch
Ching ching ching, pawn shop be my main bitch
Ching ching ching, gold mouth, with a bad bitch
Girls on my dick cause I'm flexin', hot boy shit
Caught a high bucks shit, lunch and I'm service this
What you really need? I'm a young Santa Claus
And I'm coming in the crib with the goons, and a bomb
Gold in my mouth, I'm a pretty boy gangster
With the cops on my ass, hand-cuffed to my ankles like a bitch

[Hook 1]
Yes, I'm finna hit a lick, yeah, I'm finna rob a bitch
Yes, I'm finna hit a lick, yeah, I'm finna rob a bitch
Yes, I'm finna hit a lick, yeah, I'm finna rob a bitch
Yes, I'm finna hit a lick, yeah, I'm finna rob a bitch

[Hook 2]
Yeah I'm hitting licks, yeah I'm pushing zips
Got lick money, got trap money
Everybody say that I'm a young ass bitch
'Til I caught my first case now I'm a thug ass bitch

Yeah I'm hitting licks, yeah I'm pushing zips
Got lick money, got trap money
Everybody say that I'm a young ass bitch
'Til I caught my first case now I'm a thug ass bitch

[Verse 2]
Ask me what is shaking, you know what's shakin'
Ten stolen cars and I run like Troy Aikman
Make the hood hot cause I'm bringing back profit
OG's said B you know you gotta stop it
So I went harder, it really ain't matter
I'm like a girl scout but I ain't have no cookies
I had a real goon that'll tie up your family
Cut the thing down, put 'em right in his sock
I'm up all night cause I'm finna go plat
Caught the BART train to the East Oakland spot
Hit the dirty 30's with my dope fiend partner
He buying up dope, I'm just watching
He said he sniff rocks, it don't make me different
Make me go hard when I'm on a dead mission
I'm on the back seat of a pimp caddy-caddy
We driving around with dope in the baggie
Pressure, he'll do anything off the powder
And his goal was to put the pipe like clam chowder
I'm in the lick for the money shit and the power
A young skinny nigga, so I couldn't be a coward

[Hook 3]
I get in a nigga shit, with a mask on my face and some bo on my lips, nigga
I get in a nigga shit, with a mask on my face and some bo on my lips, nigga

[Outro]
Yeah that's that real hitting lick shit
You know what I mean?
Lil B for Little Boss
I ain't never been playing with this thang
10 thangs on them thangs
Why you think I got this 40 Licks tatoo on my throat?
Not for the bitches
That's cause I hit 40 licks, you know what I mean?
Real shit nigga, 6 Kiss
You can only hear it here
Lil B for Little Boss
Welcome to my world
Yeah, pretty boy shit
