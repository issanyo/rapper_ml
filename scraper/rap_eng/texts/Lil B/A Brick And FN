I'm stuck in the hood with no money, I'm scared
Somebody front me a brick and FN
FN, ya feel me?
Yeah, fuck the kids, ya feel me? FN
I'm stuck in the hood with no money, I'm scared
Somebody front me a brick and FN
FN, namsayin'?
Keep gutter, feel me? FN

[Verse]
Who you gonna front? that kill that zip whodie
That FN with the clip whodie
Bet your bottom dollar that I come up
I'm soo down, bet my gun's up
Down with that smother, you could run up
I love seein' numbers, I love that bitch whodie
You could fuck the dope man, but not my bitch whodie
No homo, I rock in honda civics
Put my money on suckas
Put money on suckas bitches
White ally boy, my word is law
I put hands on niggas, put hands on crackers
Put money on suckas, I do numbers on hondas
You on't know me, beat ya then fuck ya
I'm a OG bitch, I'm a OG young nigga
Got shit crackin', I play dumb with ya
Some bricks and FNs, don't snitch, I'mma fuck with ya

I'm stuck in the hood with no money, I'm scared
Somebody front me a brick and FN
FN, namsayin'?
Keep gutter, yeah, feel me? FN
