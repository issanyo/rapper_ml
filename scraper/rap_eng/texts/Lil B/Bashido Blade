[Lil B]

Like J. Stalin
I’m off that tussin
I’m riding to the bitches, the bitches love me
It’s Bitch Mob, MAC 11
Soldiers, tiny pants and bitches
Always duck and rollers
My life is okay, fuck hoes all day, taking trips to Norway
I can’t complain
This shit is like a dream, but I’m never waking up
I guess I’m always asleep…where’s my bed?
Thinking deeper thoughts, where’s my head?
30 minutes before the show, where the fuck’s my bread?
I feel like I’m God, I’m in the world alone
Someone help me please
And I hate my phone, just wanna be by myself
Don’t care if no one call, I’m in the world alone
I think about my dogs, who ain’t really real
From winter, spring to fall, fuck, who ballin'?
Only the real survive when the legends die
Put my faith in earth, I give my soul to God
I look up to the sky, I’m a lone warrior
Bashido Blade, ???, a fallen soldier
People look over my knowledge
They think the car life is similar to college
But nobody believes me
I think world’s cheating
I think the devil’s cheesing for the pain this season
How you gon' survive, when the devil’s throwing knives
Please bless my soul, the people getting cold
Who could trust a world full of lust
Blood, sweat, and honor
This is my life, this is your life
I relate to the farmer, cause I’m close to the soil
Everything I go, aha
And everyone’s that's loyal, please watch me
All the street soldiers, live positive
Cause one day the fight be over
I said one day the fight be over
Evil Red Flame, the soldier
