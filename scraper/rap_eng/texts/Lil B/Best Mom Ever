Mom I love you
It's ya boy Lil B, actually it's your son, Brandon
Ya sonny. You know ma
This for all the moms around the world. Thank you
Hey mom I really love you. Thank you mom

(I said momma I love you know that I do)

[Verse 1]
This is for my mom who kept it more realer than any best friend I know
I could depend on long nights, hard days momma right there
And when if ever broke momma bought me Nike Airs
So I ain't never cry unless it was for heartbreak
Mom gave me strength even when I didn't have weight
When I needed love, when I needed food
A roof over head, clothes and a bed
She had me

Talk I feel so lucky
Cause she understands even when it's ugly
Pack and save, and eatin canned foods
Salvation army lookin for a garment
A wise man told me that life's a party
And the best time ever was to dance with mommy
Right around that time there was a gangster party
Momma let me go out live life with caution, yeah

(I said momma you know that I love you know that I do)
[x2]

Hey mom I wanna thank you
And I wanna tell you that I remember everything you always told me
Forever. Ever and ever I'ma always remember
It always stuck with me . You the best mom ever I love you

[Verse 2]
She let me be free and told me this is our house
Even when I didn't pay bills
Playin' after school man I couldn't stay still
Tried to get a late note and you had it right there
Police tried to raid but you told em didn't stay
You the best mom even words can't explain
Every other day man I look you in you face when you sleepin
Pray that everythings okay

Praying for your health and I prayin that you safe
When it's true love it's a blessing for today
Love you mom and dad, RIP grandpa
Grandma hold it down for ya (ya feel me)
And momma always accept me
And told me I was smart when the teachers F'd me
I took bus trips on the streets of Berkeley
Now I work everyday just to keep you workin

MOM I LOVE YOU

YEAH

(I said momma you know that I love you know that I do)
(I said momma you know that I love you know that I do)

I said mom I love you, thank you
For everything you've done
Everything, EVERYTHING
Everything you've done for me
Feedin me, everything, every single thing
Mom I could go on forever
Long nights, long hard nights when I was sick, all those days when I had asthma
When I was at the doctor, long nights
Thank you mom
Thank you mom

Everything that we went through together, you the most special mom ever
You the best mom ever

Thank you for really helping me be the man who I am today

You the closest thing to an angel I ever seen, or I ever had

And once my mom leaves this earth, bury me next to my mother
