[Intro]
Now I don't want no niggas to take this, um, personally, ya feel me?
'Cause there's a lot of motherfuckas I don't fuck with
So, don't think you special enough for this song to be about you personally
Real talk, it ain't nothing like that
Bruh, you already know who it is, man
BasedGod, ya feel me?
Rawest rapper in this shit, we do it everyday

[Verse 1]
Real talk, niggas know about me ('bout me)
Yeah, I got my ass punched, but I'll murder anybody
And I'm coming for your bitch
Homie, this is real, this that gangsta gangsta shit that y'all bitches feel (I feel)
Bitch, I'm the dopeman, filthy with my hands
BasedGod, nigga, put you in a trance
Bitch, I want the fonk (yessssssssssssss), I'm angry than a fuck
BasedWorld, nigga, this is what you want
And bitch, I am the realest (realest), and I'm the illest (illest)
I get respect from the killers (from the killers)
And nah, I ain't lying
Nah, bruh, I don't pay for no hitters, I'm firing (firing)
Man, I was hittin' folks around 14
Bruh, riding dunk, that's a hood dream (hood dream)
Bruh, shooting dice on probation
We got a house, we still catching cases

[Chorus]
Man, I got fonk, with a lot of niggas (fuck 'em, ya feel me?)
So real talk, I don't fuck, with a lot of niggas
To keep it 100, I lost respect, for a lot of niggas (still right)
I'm down bad, to keep it 100, I should've popped that nigga (ya feel me?)
Man, I got fonk, with a lot of niggas (lot of niggas)
So real talk, I don't fuck, with a lot of niggas
To keep it 100, I lost respect, for a lot of niggas
I'm down bad, to keep it 100, I should've popped that nigga (yesssssssssssss)

[Bridge]
You know we ain't never been scared for it
I'm always there for it

[Verse 2]
Bitch coming in around two ('round two)
New Bentley Coupe, all blue (blue)
Nah, bitch, I'm lying, this a Buick
I'm prepared for that fonk, bitch, I do's it (BasedGod)
I'm trying to get rich and petty
Open up that dope like Tom Petty (Tom Petty)

[Chorus]
Man (niggas got that funk, bitch), I got fonk, with a lot of niggas (fuck 'em, ya feel me?)
