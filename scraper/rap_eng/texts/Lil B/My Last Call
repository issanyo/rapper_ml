Young Thugger this is Boss pick up the phone
I'm not doing good the whole jack move went wrong
Used to feel good about bringing out the pain and
We selling off hops feeling like Dwayne Wade
The friends turned suckas
And suckas turned snitches
We've been in the room interrogated with the sprite cans
Handcuffed to a chair, sweating from my right hand
Still feel secure because I'm knowing you're my right man
Things really changes when change is the changing
Even hit a high speed scared to switch lane
All life lessons to I guess its all game
But why you turn your back on me that you must explain
Not much to hear but I'd rather see the frame
Cuz I trusted you but I see dude we ain't the same
Loyalty and friendship was in my first book
I never thought you'd be the one to get shook

This my last call (times 4)

This my last call and yeah shit I know it ain't right
We'd hit a couple of licks and get high the same night
If you was on the plane I be on the same flight
Sometimes I wasn't right but I always made it right
Remember when you got jacked, I would spit the game right?
And I got your shit back, and we still took flight
And I still wouldn't leave cuz I know you had my back
Man I didn't have a car so I stole a couple bikes
Point a to point b, we would get there right?
How you do me like this, I wasn't worth the sale right?
And whats the mail like? I went bad on all my partners
The only dudes left is Big Mark with the choppers
And he went crazy because they're shooting at his momma
Real beef is when you can't sleep on your problems
I rather just die then sit in this cell
And to know you put be here, it just don't sit well
Why you snitch on me? and why you lie on me?
True ass game is you never been my homie
I should've seen your eyes and your heart that you a phony
The hardest ones out be the ones to tell on em
Sad that you be the reason I rot in hell homie
Reversing on the time I would've never friend a snitch
And never put my heart into a man that was a bit-
You play a game or two and they leave you home sick
I forgive you but I never can forgive you
I said I forgive you, but I never can forgive you
This my last call, you you nigga

I can't believe I'm in jail for life
