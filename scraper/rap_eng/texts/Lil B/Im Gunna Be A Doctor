[Intro: Lil B]
Aye, real 05 pain, you know what I'm saying? You gonna make it, we struggling

[Hook: Lil B] (x2)
I'm facing fed time, brodie doing hot shit
I be in them hot whips, I be doing hot shit
But for real, I'm gonna be a doctor

I got dreams nigga

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I'm still a street nigga, but I'm killing these niggas
Niggas with the purple lean in the cup, purple weed in the swish
Nigga get his head bust, trust that I bust back, I bust back
Same time I bust back, reload that, expose that
I'm coming with them boulders, clean money and I'm controlling
The niggas talk shit, and controlling
Understand you ain't got control of that
Can't nobody hold you back
My niggas spit raps off the heart, niggas sit back
I'm off the top for real, free my niggas in the civ
You know what I'm saying? I love my niggas
Can't nobody say shit, we living it
You feel me?

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I got dreams too, I got big dreams
Was cryin' when I say this, nobody gave it to me
Life so hard, this shit that's crazy to me
Niggas come up rich, that was kind of foreign to me
With the hand-me-down shit, I look new, you feel me?
Get my thoughts together, I got that life together
About that right shit, you feel me?
Collect money, I'm 'bout both sides
So any side you see it, I see it
Coppin' that shit, going to the top ring
I finna be a doctor one day
Lil B, you know we say what we see
Grasp it, niggas see it
Nigga was hatin' on the real street nigga, but you can't crush my dreams
Comin' from the top, fuck these niggas, you feel me?
Lil Boss

[Hook] (x2)
