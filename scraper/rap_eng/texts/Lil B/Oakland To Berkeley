Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Oakland, you know I love you (You know I do)
So let's make love (The whole city)
And forget about the truth (Are you with me)
Berkeley, you know I love you (You know it's my heart)
Let's make love (I love you, baby girl)
And forget about the truth

[Verse]
Lost too many brothers, they can't take that message
One man down, I lost my niggas like a slave ship
I talk shit, you just talk shit to say shit
Move niggas underground, you free on a mission
I'm a brother with a vision
I need big guns just to change the system
Need money just to make a system
Dope game getting viscious
Better pay with your sister or your wife
It's more money, I'm traumatized like they owe me money
I'm a real waterfront rockstar posted at the Guillman
Down the street from St. Pablo chillin'
Tryna scratch a lotto ticket
I was there way before Walgreens
Way before the Mac store
Way before the prices raised on the streets
I love to play them types of games
Niggas talk shit bout Lil B, I just want a name
I lost so much weight
My name, just say it, don't be crazy
I got a one track mind when I rob people
I only want the money, fuck the people
Them red and blue lights just keep on flashing
If I shoot at them boys, stripes
I put suckers underground if that *censored* price right
I hit so many licks, sometimes I can't sleep at night
You a snitch if you sell your family if the price right
I hit so many licks, sometimes I can't sleep at night

[Hook]
