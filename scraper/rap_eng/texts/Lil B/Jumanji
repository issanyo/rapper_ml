[Intro]
It's Jumanji, yeah
Welcome to the jungle
It's Jumanji, yeah
For the world
Welcome to the jungle
It's Jumanji

[Verse 1]
Really people wanna say hi
They just think you don't wanna talk to 'em
Now people saying hi without saying hi
Bitch don't kill my vibe like Kendrick Lamar said
I just do my thing, I'm living beyond dead
Life over money, women over bread
Men at the table, children at the legs
Without them we can't stand up on a bridge, you dig?
I rap with the blinds closed
Incence burning, music smell like my home
Fresh roses, ballet dances
Donate my money to doctors to cure the cancer
Man I'm just like a [?]
Investments in the hood, I'm like Maxwell

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y'all better check my background
I said y'all better check my background

[Chorus]
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji

[Verse 2]
Came out the jungle with a minor scratch
Seen a couple monkeys, put 'em on their back
Fuck what you heard, I'm still moving packs
Since I'm a lion I know a couple cats
No pigs in my circle, we don't fuck with rats
Everybody in the woods watch this tennis match
Real based on earth, I'm in space
All the animals come gather in this place
There's no hunters, even on the plates
Where's the pigeons? the seagulls on a date
[?] on the floor
All this ice cream on the cross
[?] paint on the wall
[?] without knowing it at all
Life is a game, I'm the ring leader
Back to back nigga like a cheerleader

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y'all better check my background
I said y'all better check my background

[Chorus]
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji yeah
It's Jumanji
