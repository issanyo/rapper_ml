[Intro]
Yeah, it's your boy Lil B
Shouts out to Salem
You know I got choppers on deck
Five hundred, hundred thousand nigga, hundred million
Come see nigga, Evil Red Flame, you feel me?

[Verse]
Hatin' bitches fuck with me
Based God I'm the baller of the fuckin' century
Niggas mad I'm from Waterfront
Got the tiny pants and I'm strapped up
AK on my side, I'm that pretty bitch
You gon' fuck with me? You so petty
Bitch I make twenty thousand off rollerskatin'
Kristi Yamaguchi, iced-out necklace
Bitch I got a cellphone and it done never ring
I'm off 'til 11:30, Randy Moss jersey
Evil Red Flame I don't think you heard me
Tear bitches and they all respect my knowledge
Got 10 cars, got a 100 bitches
Stuff her in the trunk
I think I'm Homer Simpson
Got that yellow, I need that 40 grip
Same shit, sell it off
I'm teeming, and I'm high as fuck
Niggas think I'm low but I'm powered up
Niggas think I'm gay until I fuck they sluts
Niggas think I'm broke 'til I bought that Phantom
Til I buy that Bentley, bitches came from Santa
Merry Christmas hold that Glock nine two forty
Powered up, still thinkin' that I'm E-40
You feel me?
Check me this, check this

[Hook]
Hope I don't go back to slangin yayo
Slangin yayo, to get my mayo
Hope I don't go back to slangin yayo
Slangin yayo, to get my mayo
Hope I don't go back to slangin yayo
Slangin yayo
