Rocking up I come up, and I move quick
I was in the hood while you was crying out to your bitch
While you niggas was doing jail time
I be sitting on an island, nigga, boat lines
You need to quit making mistakes
I feel too perfect, and life too short
Got played a few times, niggas is liars
Watch they soul burn slow
The niggas on fire, can't be who I be
Best thing is to watch, I lay the game for you
So go get that guap, and stay out of my lane
And watch my drop
Moving two coupe drops like the governor
Backing down haters I might smother you
Watch the cheeky niggas, them the type to fuck with you
Watch, watch a nigga eyes because them the type to bust with you
Made a little money, and now she had enough of you
And I peep that bitch, I'm a reverse side pimp
I don't need that bitch, all extra talking is extra
I learned from my lessons, stepped in
Need my suggestions, from the BasedGod
Shit, he ain't even no human
Most people get confused
BasedWorld so confusing, don't loose em
Based freestyle

We up in smoke, 30,000 this is dope
Based free, on moi, on me
Sitting back in the cloud of sculptures, I'm so high in the air, it's dope
Based free, on moi
Based freestyle, you know like I said man
With this BasedGod Velli all we doing is
Is proving a point, the rap game is over
All it is is about real shit now
But what I mean the rap game is over, it's very alive
You see we selling records independently
All major labels, out the trunk, whatever you wanna do
Just be you
Lil B, I done changed the rap game and I done made history
Everybody follow me and watch me
Took steps and pages out my book
And they twist it a little bit and do them, and I respect that
Do that, but you know, pay homage
Actually you don't gotta pay homage
Cause I done change the game to the point where I know
I know I'm a faggot, I know I'm a motherfuckin faggot you bastards Top hats to me nigga, top hats to Lil B you heard me
Top hats to Lil with the five stars, cause I'm a motherfuckin general
This is BasedGod Velli, what it do
Mixtape shit
