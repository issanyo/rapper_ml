[Intro]
Pussy niggas need to get they grams up
That's the subject for school today
Pussy niggas gettin they grams up
You know what I'm saying?
Lil B man, 05 Fuck Em man

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I come from the bottom where
These niggas is rats
Then they fucking off the block
And we flooded with packs
It must be a drought how
We flooded with sacks
Shout to Mack Maine
That's a real nigga
I tuck the same guns that
The government pack
You niggas getting played
This the PS4 house
I'm spending dirty money
At the third world whore house
Strip club love me
Cus i strip off stacks
Then i rob the bitch
Give my money back
Double up bitch, quicker than you
Push 5 pounds off, I'm getting fat
I'm a chubby drug dealer
Anorexic pecs
I'm pushing weight off, throwin it up
Pills in her mouth, coke in her butt
Niggs act like I've been bad
Just relax man, I'm not Sinbad

[Hook]
I fuck bitches (count up), I murk niggas (based god)
Man, Lil B you under! (swag)
Bitch, fuck with a boss, bitch
You know what I'm sayin?
What up bitch? (what up ho?)
I fuck bitches (ok), I murk suckas (why)
God damn, Lil B you under! (you do what you do)
Bitch, fuck with a boss (Swag)
You know what I'm saying
Lil B ho, what it do?

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I flow like Cassius Clay
And your coke got half the taste
I bought, i don't have to taste
I got the money, it's half the wait
Niggas get killed just for being informants
Money on your head that's a strip club summer
Strip a couple suckas, strip club summer
Niggas be like "Lil B Under!"
Cus he get murked, I'm not no plumber
His face on his shirt, you can wear that thunder
I stay low key, my crack so under
Niggas too slow with that fucking work
Here rhymes play, i know it's couple
Doctor's with work, this is mass music
Ride to it, I don't respect them suckas
I'm coming from the under and
Them niggas not under

[Hook]
