Yeah! I gotta say too much on this
Momma working all day, I'mma pray the God
If I dont make it in the world, please protect my mom
The pressure on the teenage man, I can understand
I just turned twenty myself, the world be a cold place
See, our life is real, but ain't nobody see a life to frail
When I ride I feel so kind of way that
So I understand how you feel
Im alone with you, Im online
Just to watch the news when I upload
I appreciate the views but you dont gotta watch me
You dont gotta like me since you ride with me..
I never had nobody that can accept the
Everybody was scared because I didn't know myself
That particular time is when Im always writing rhymes
And speaking my mind I
..to keep my head right about my momma home
..dont stop, ..dont stop
I work every day is a come and go
To keep my head right and buy my moms a home!
..dont stop, ..dont stop

Im feeling so many times I didn't learn the lesson
Hope Im not an example, hope you really see my message
I do this for my family and everybody that respected
But time fly fast and Im feeling resentment!
I dont think about my best Im moving fifty percent
If I thirty five in the
If Im thinking I win
But where I grew up, either you sink or you swim
S its crabs in the bucket you heard that phrase
But everybody got a chance to shower and praise
So Im.. to change the whole way
Rode a book 19, I hope that
A lot of people thought Im dumb like an underachievement
Cause my grades wasn't good, but I was smoking that
But my mom said son, if you keep believing
You can be anything, just keep on breathing!
And I try to stay clean, but drugs is
This is something in my brain, since an early age
And I never fall off, but these words you got
Ain't no promise in this life, I'mma beat the..
Momma struggling every day just to keep a job
And dont nobody understand what I go through daily
So if Im looking kinda down
Just salute the guy
Cause to really tell the truth is hard
Im writing rhymes every day
Is a gift from God, and if you listen to this rap
This is for my heart
..Imma beat the odds, and I'mma do the right thing
Be the
I'mma beat the odds!
I'mma beat the odds, little being!
