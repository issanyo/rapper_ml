[Intro: Lil B]
Yeah
West side up
Halloween H20, west side up
Yeah, I see all around the world nigga
I see all around the world bitch
Its Lil B yeah

[Verse 1]
Ima ball for my niggas in the east
And I'm really from the west I got love for the streets
But I still hold the Glock in the heat
And I put you on the strip like them boys in the deep
Fuck what you heard bitch I'm a grown man
Ima keep counting money til' I pass math
A hundred thousand bitch, straight cash
I pop the top off the remy, might sip henny
Everytime I sip henny get the warm chest
4-5 in your arm rest
Bout a hundred dozen, in the arm rest
Gotta deal with the barber
Bitch Ima push harder
Nigga think its a game around
Til' that 4-4, lying side
And I lay em down
I'm the king with the fucking crown
If you feel otherwise then speak now
We proceed, with the "get money" tactics
Won't push over, homicide with the boulders
Walking on the street you're gonna have to bump shoulders
Niggas never solid, most niggas act kosher
My gun cocked, like the brand new testarossa
From the shoulders, Ima bring you a little closer
Niggas try to turn man you gon' have to ho up
Fuck niggas I pull triggers I let em' blow up
Never wore a mask, you gonna have to expose us
Ima show my face, no hide, no place
Never did no state (never)
Niggas know the state, put em up for ransom
Gun clink and bag em, like twitter red flag them
Sworn the magnum, put a car with a drive by in that magnum
Letting 24 rounds at the side of your magnum
Treat em like an ant why don't you smash em
Ride through off dro in the streets
Bitch play around with me you gon' be going to sleep
No bed by your side when you lay in the street
And its gangster-ville, off the stop, west side you get murked for real
Worldwide off the top Ima push the deal
Lil B allday and he rep the bay
4-5 in my coat you can see the K
Ima ball like philly where the eagles play
Ima ball like philly where the eagles play
Bitch

[Outro]
Lil B nigga
Yeah, Lil B nigga
A hundred thousand for the grammy
A hundred thousand for the whammy
