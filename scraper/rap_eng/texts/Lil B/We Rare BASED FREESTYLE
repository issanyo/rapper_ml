You should see me in that rare thing, that shit is erry' thing

I asked 'em "what's mooshoo?"
She said "you hungry?", [?] I'm ugly

[Interlude: Chance The Rapper]
That shit actually goes crazy
Cos I feel like muh'fuckers don't understand uh, the reason why we rare is cos everybody's beautiful
And that shit just makes me rare and so that's why I'mma just keep dancing in the studio
And I feel like, nigga, hear me dancing in the..

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I like my shit uncooked, I like my shit just raw
Everything that you thought I wrote, I just thought
I be coming off the top, that is my talk
Top of my head at the end of my black afro
What I do, what I do when I step in the club
Everybody give me dap, bitches give me love
And the bartender, at the end he just give a hug
He say "thank you for dropping fifty million thousand dubs"
When I'm in the club, niggas love me so much
Chano, man I swear we fuckin' just so tough
So when I say I'm, I'm, I'm rare
I just mean I'm like Jordan when I'm catchin' some air, cos
