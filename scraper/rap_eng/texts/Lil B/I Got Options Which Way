[Intro]
Still out here in this motherfuckin' field
Battlefield in the war
With the [?]
Oh my god, Keyboard, you’re so based
BasedWorld

[Verse]
People switch, everyday I got options (Options)
Confused about which way
I keep focus, and I don't run the street (Street)
I'm just tryin’ to drop my mixtape
A lot of spoken reasons, but I ain't up in the closet (Nah)
Nah, nigga, I got a lot of rooms up in my office (Office)
I keep thinking, about tomorrow
The judge might say that my time at ball
Showin' up a hunnid times, puttin' it off 'til tomorrow
Livin' my life, my nigga, it's no sorrow (Nah)
I'm back on my two-three
A lot of niggas talkin’ about what they gon’ do to me
Mind over matter, my Glock make your head splatter
If I go in, it's ’bout to go down
Leave a [?] on that bitch, we blowin' up now
How could you turn your back on this evil feelin'?
Mr. BasedGod, he made a killin'
Mind over art, it’s my echo
Paintin' in the garage, [?] falsetto ('Setto)
(This complexed) I beg to differ (Complexed)
(I'm feelin' it) Yeah
They want to bring me down, why?
Can't see 'em, I ain't around
Don't lose focus, confront the locus
It's Lil B, but I don't feel hopeless (Nah)

[Outro]
We out here, playin'
Hands in the soil, all that shit
Give it new life, you know what I'm sayin'?
Figure out how to do it, right?
There ain't no stoppin' that, you know what I'm sayin'?
That's how we livin'
For motherfuckas got a problem with that
Now they come talk
