Nobody got cash, they pockets crushed
My pockets crushed, I'm bad on my luck
I'm down on my ass, I'm thinking bout that flash
My life's in a flash, I got the world on smash

But I'm not eating like I'm supposed to
I'm finna go out this evening and show up
I'mma be the center in the hood and post up
I'mma be the engine in the hood and turn up

Summertime; everybody want to see me burn up
I'm looking like college, so y'all better learn up
I don't fuck with you to leave you bloody
I'mma tell you like this - I ain't gon funk for the money

Money tight, but it ain't go stay where it's at
You only see green, that's why your soul turned black
Whatever that means - I'mma tell you like this
Based thoughts do exist, I'mma serve y'all off to rip

I'mma tell you like this - down for the --
Down for my team, down for the world
You know I talk green, you knew the same thing
We do the same shit, you can fuck my bitch

I'mma tell you like this (shut up) I'm happy for you (I don't care)
Pat you on your back (shut up, I don't care)
I'mma pat you on your back (I got bitches)
Cause it's hard life dog (get off me)
Don't fuck my bitch, (get off me) Lil B tear it off

I'm taking more shots in the game then I'm supposed to
Doing more things in the game than I'm supposed to
I'mma tell you like this pussy - you ride around with that chopper (pass it)
I'mma tell you like this pussy (what) - I don't fuck with none of them bitches

On the feel like my people with them pockets
I'mma tell you like this whodie - I lost money before
I'mma tell you like this whodie - I had to jump way back in
I got to bounce back again; who want to see me win?
I don't think nobody do
Fuck 'em!

Got cash
Nobody got cash, my pockets crushed
They pockets crushed, I'm down on my luck
Nobody got cash, they pockets crushed
