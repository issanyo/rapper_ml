[Intro]
My name's Lil B, is there heaven for a G?

[Verse 1]
Can I make it in this world where the people don't love me
I was working two jobs but not enough
Had to go to school but college was tough
So I hit the street work, how this dope and tree work
My mom and dad would be ashamed of me
Cause I charge all these suckas, my game ain't free
Ask me what's the word when I drop my top
I'm a flat back mac with the Cadillac drop
Lost too many homies to the game
All these groupies wanna know my name
How many times will I cry these tears
Had to hide all my pain so I have no fear
I love my auntie cause she keep it real
Everybody around they know my deal
Will my mom be safe when she drive in the rain
I'm a African king tryna learn my name

[Hook]
Is there heaven for a G
Everybody tell me, is there heaven for a G
When my mom go to sleep, is there heaven for a G
Everybody tell me, is there heaven for a G
When my mom go to sleep, is there heaven for a G

[Verse 2]
I can wrap my heart out, bring the stars out
Do I always keep it real with the homies? (No doubt!)
I drive to Oakland tryna get my mind right
But I can't see clear, there's weed in the air
Saving more lives and planting more trees
Keep supporting me, it's love in the air
But I'ma keep it real, it's hate everywhere
Trapped in the ghetto with no place to go
TV on the floor with the cigarette burns
Grandma outside with the brand new perm
I'm ghetto, like burning the braids with your lighter
Roll up this fire, it's time to get higher
Every black person need knowledge itself
I'm tryna find heaven cause we livin' in hell
The American dream is the black man jail
Rest in peace to [?], you missin' for real

[Break]
I just can't wait to see the day where we all just hang out, chill out, and relax. No hate, no pain, all positivity. Searching for this peace

[Hook]
Is there heaven for a G (Just searching for peace)
Everybody tell me, is there heaven for a G (While I'm in these streets)
When my mom go to sleep, is there heaven for a G (My name Lil B)
Everybody tell me, is there heaven for a G
When my mom go to sleep, is there heaven for a G
