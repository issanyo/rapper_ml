Frankie Joseph: [knocking on door]
Godfather: "Hey, who is it?"
Frankie Joseph: "Hey let me in Godfather, it's Frankie Joseph."
Godfather: "Hey, Frankie! Let him in!" [opens door] "Frankie, my boy!"
Man #1: "How you doin', Frank?"
Man #2: "Sup, Frankie!"
Frankie Joseph: "Godfather." [kisses Godfather]
Godfather: "Hello, Frankie."
Frankie Joseph: "I know about this artist..." [puffs smoke] "His name is Lil B the BasedGod."
Man #1: "Yeah, yeah, I know about Lil B, yeah..."
Godfather: "Oh, okay, okay..."
Frankie Joseph: "He seems to be very loyal, very authentic, very true, very positive, very respectful."
Man #1: "He's the BasedGod, yeah..."
Frankie Joseph: "They're the qualities that we all see... To becoming a made man."
Man #1: "This is true, this is true."
Frankie Joseph: "Besides that he is not a snitch, he's not a hater, and he'll fuck your bitch." [puffs smoke]
Godfather: "Tell me more, tell me more."
Frankie Joseph: [puffs smoke] "Godfather..." [puffs smoke again] "I come to you today for a loan..." [puffs smoke a third time] "A hundred fifty million dollars' worth of diamonds. And a billion dollar music recording contract. What do you feel?" [door creaks]
Godfather: "Frankie, my boy... You came to me this day to ask me for this favor. And I will give you this favor, but not as a loan. I have massive amounts of money, and I wish to not make more. I wish to be a part of greatness. I wish to be a part of history. And grant me this favor... is to be as based as you guys. So Frankie my boy, let's celebrate. Because today... we make history." [pops champagne and pours] "Here we go, here we go. That's it..."
Frankie Joseph: "Thank you, Godfather. I will never let you down."
Godfather: "It's no problem, Frankie."
Frankie Joseph: "I would never shame the name."
Godfather: "You're my boy, you're my boy..." [pats Frankie on the shoulder]
Frankie Joseph: "Let's toast."
Godfather: "Tonight, we celebrate."
Everyone: "Salut!"
Frankie Joseph: "Thank you again, Godfather. I'll be back... I'mma go to the studio." [door closes, goes down stairs]
