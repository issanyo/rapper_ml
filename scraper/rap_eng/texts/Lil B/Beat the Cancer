[Intro: Lil B]
I love everybody
This for everybody that got cancer
I love you, keep fighting
This is especially for my special partner on Youtube
Man, he hit me up and asked me
Could I make this song for him
He was dying of cancer, and
He loved me, he loved my music
He said he feel like his life fading to black
I tell ya keep fighting, I love ya
Let's get it, Silent President mixtape

[Hook] x2
You can count me out, but I still keep fighting
They told me I wouldn't live because of the pain inside me
Until my last
I'mma keep fighting back
Until my day fades to black

[Verse 1]
I'mma beat the cancer, cancer
Fuck the cancer, cancer
Playing god and the devil is dancer
Don't know why I got a gift and a curse
But know I'm blessed to see today and its worth
Another fight today
Never scared of the casket
The people all love my soul
All the love when I'm laughin'
Got the vest and the armor
Got the sword with the karma
The heat in your face, let it sit in a sauna
You feel me?

[Interlude]
I love you, man, let's get it. Silent President mixtape, let's go
Yeah
You only got one life to live; have fun!
Silent President
Keep fighting!

[Verse 2]
You ain't have no patience, I am a patient
I am a fighter, my will's to make it
I'm so perfected, plus so respected
People look at me, I'm what the pros rejected
I'm smooth and wreckless, so move the exit plan
Is to pass it, pass over to me
I'll carry your baggage
The weight, I'll do what I can on gentleman's honor
Only for the karma
Make life's performance, streetlights is on
The water look so gorgeous on another level, had to live to see it
The case closed for real, and I couldn't believe it
This is new age technology
Got niggas in helicopters waiting with long choppers
To drop down on anybody
Defeating the problem
If you fuck with Lil B, I ain't giving no option
