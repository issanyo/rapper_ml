[Intro]
Sitting down at this mic by myself
You know at BasedWorld Studios feeling like this Motown but on a way different level
Real hip hop

[Verse 1]
Some niggas call me crook but I ain't did nothing
You need to read books sit down and learn something
I come from B-Town where the block is diamond
The signs is gold, platinum mouth is shining
Fuck that, my mouth is crying, I speak too much
Give me a tissue, light the fire
Got the matches, gon' match you motherfuckers
It's magic, to me it just happens
I looked up, couple fuckers that rapping
Now I surpass them, static
All for nothing, I guess it's for something
Everything happen for a reason check your budget
Check yourself before youre left in the bucket
Precise aim with the 9 your shirt blow your buttons
Push my buttons like if you come back stunting
Forreal man you got ugly facial features
Man your beard like the teachers
You feel me, I did it solo throw a ball you catch it
Don't ball the block man the blocks the balls mark the spots you catch man, Lil B is hotter
X-Men I'll raid your shots throw shots like a bartender
You turn yellow like Bart Simpson
You feel me
I revenge your shots
And I'm hawking niggas man I like to take flesh I be bossing niggas
Lil B

[Bridge]
BasedWorld, BasedWorld up, we did it

[Verse 2]
The paper got me hard when I write these rhymes make you sick
You gotta do it again two times come in again you love it yeah ya love it again
Y'all niggas can't take it no more
My raps faster than scratching your ho
But when I write it won't matter, the flow, fast or slow
When I rap man a stack you can't match the flow
I hate to brag but your lagging though
Cause your a grown man, how I passed the floor
I think I'm gifted man and I got raps, it's natural
But y'all pussies acting like you want to snatch my goals
You won't even touch the tape and diss the ho
Cause you ain't even worth shit you a bitch you ho
You can keep on trying supplying mix to stars
You ain't even gon' see my face walking up behind you bitch
I'mma be everywhere that you gotta go
And I ain't steal shit man you niggas is sold
Back on your back to write
Keep on listing homes
Niggas foreal, I'mma finish this song
Fuck you, pay me, fuck you, pay me, and fuck you pay me, feel me

[Bridge]
BasedWorld up

[Verse 3]
Niggas no more, turning more raps to rhymes
I see a lot of places but niggas I gotta sign
If you wanna be a rapper you gotta flip to shine
I can't take it no more niggas gotta get mine
They call me repo man I bring hits the streets and for a nice price bring a hit to the beat
You ain't gotta pay up nigga keep the peace
Cause the way that I rhyme you gotta be discreet
I'm not a J, I'm not X, I'm not flipping beams
I'm a different kinda rapper, I got shit to scream
If you wanna be, you can flip the screen
Barricades bout the past by me I can help out your flows just ask me
And I'll shoot you a flea I give you slap my nigga
A little far from free
Yes I bleed to the block I stay calling shots like I'm B.I.G. or Pac
One time let it drop, Lil B
