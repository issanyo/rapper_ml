(Verse 1: Lil B)
Niggas ain't getting no money 'round here
It's starting to seem like 'round here
So Imma go and put that fucking cannon to his ear
And let niggas know that I'm the man around here
05 fuck em thats my proposition
Im in a high position with no pot to piss in
So, niggas gon pay for that
I was going broke that, you gon' pay for that
Summertime nigga bring the rain and gats
Nigga almost got killed saying the Raiders whack!
Better mind your business when Lil B talking
Cause you might walk the ice cold office
With the ice cold stair like I'm back on offense
You playing defense, but I kept my yardage
I kept going further-
Go hardest
I changed the whole world look at what I started
05 fuck em I was in  my house
I was over smoking
Niggas playing games man damn
No feeling, niggas playing messy
I won't forget it
Man, all fucking lemons
Pushing lemons, broke cars, fake business
Niggas taking classes
Nigga, I'm taking chances
Nigga, I neeed the cash advancement
I'm trying to see that shit
Nigga I'm taking these chances
Who am I?
I'm a reflection of a man
I love this man
I'm putting niggas under -
You feel me
They in the ground
Waterfront, underworld, water bitch
Nigga off that full throttle
Shout out to Scarface, ghetto boys
I'm a ghetto boy
Shout out to them ghetto boys
I'm  strict to the motherfucking street bitch
Sending all that motherfucking-
