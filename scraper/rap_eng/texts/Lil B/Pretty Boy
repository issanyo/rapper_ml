[Soulja Boy]
Yea... this that pretty boy shit
This that pretty boy shit

Falling from the club with a big ass dick
Word to Lil B, but nigga no homo
Pulled up in a Lambo
And I'm riding slow-mo
Tell a bitch take a photo
Take her to the crib then I beat her
Man I'm not, I'm not gonna eat her
I will mistreat her
Where a wife-beater
Soulja
Pull up in a Rover
Nigga I told you
Taking shit over
Flow like Coca-Cola
Bitch I pulled up like Pensacola, Florida
Down South Georgia
Pull up in the motherfucking thing
Like let his shit hang
Bitch I see your g-string
Bitch money ain't a thing bitch
The fuck you talking about?
$100,000,000 in the bank and I ain't talking about the vault

[Soulja Boy Hook]
Yea, this that pretty boy shit
Pull up in the whip with a bitch on my dick
Yea, this that pretty boy shit
$100,000,000 I'll slap a fucking bitch like
Yea, this that pretty boy shit
Pull up in the whip with the bitches on my dick
Yea, this that pretty boy shit
$100,000,000 Bitch the money ain't shit

[Lil B]
Money ain't shit, bitches ain't shit

Pretty boy young niggas came with the shit

Shouts to Westside nigga coming so hard
Young bitches on my motherfucking dick niggas swear to fucking God

Stomping out problems
