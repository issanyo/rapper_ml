Based!

My mind sits, the grind consists of
Working hard, push-ups, 10-6
I spit sick, try not to think about when I spit
100 thousand, my life's in bliss, I might
Travel in the mists, I might
I write but then I don't
I think but then I won't
I know that I'mma grow one day
And I'mma go with the gold
You know I know
I roll like a 100 thousand fold
10 fold, 10 fold on my muthafuckin dick
These hoes on my muthafuckin dick
10 fold like my dick, 10 fold like some rocks
I got hoes on muthafuckin deck, bitch
BasedGod, and we handling shit like a muthafuckin beast
Got a vision for this rap shit, action, blasting
My rap is awkward, how I slap is awkward
God damn I'm a fag, I'm a lesbian the girls love
And I'm.. and I'm.. so happy
Running through the hornet's nest
All these bitches on my muthafuckin dick
I get a lot of green
I know a lot of girls and they see a lot of dicks
I have a lot of dreams and I gotta express em
I'm coming like the subway: expressing
I'm guessing I'm just like a Newport
New sport, never been a poor sport
I got my cat, I love my cat
My cat is a young cat, my cat is a dumb rabbit
I spit dumb raps; dumb facts. I'm dumbfounded that I'm
So dumb now, I'm smart now, I'm dumb now
100 thousand
And we keep this shit rolled up
In the back, smoked up
I just want the money and the Swither, money and the cash
Money and the bitches. And world-renowned respect
Surround my neck, surround my checks
I compose history, shout-out to Soulja Boy
100 thousand online, 100 thousand on my mind
