[Intro]
Ugh, shit
Start to forget my mind, I start to forget everything
Ever since I came in BasedWorld, nothing's been the same
I lost everything: my house, my car, my wife, my bitches, my money
It's like everything's just been erased from my life, you know
I feel so positive still, still I don't give a fuck

[Verse]
Erybody take shots today on my court
I play on defense, it's something like Ty Law
BasedWorld family is something I would die for
Don't get greedy 'cause you always gon' want more
Live more, ain't enough, you come to the crossroads
You living like a nigga wouldn't want those
The bullets on your head like some motherfucking cornrows
I'm talking 'bout the lick, bitch, I'm finna get on those
Feeling real out of place, feeling real out of shape
I ain't thugged in a minute, 'cause I'm in another space
I'm ridin' down the street, bitch wit' the .38, special homie
I'm ridin' wit' it 'cause I'm special, homie
And fuck what the people say
'Cause you know they hatin' on me anyway
What's the difference if you know I'm the rawest rapper?
V12 with the verses, you can call me faster
V12 with the work 'cause I move plastic
Nobody see the pain through my eyes
True lies, spitting dough with them shady guys
And I fuck with Task Force 'cause they down to ride
And you can't erase my whole memory
Watch by the feds, y'all send for me
And I know about my history, bitch
And I don't give a fuck about it
I'm living for the future, gotta stay protected
I got world class shooters, that's real based music
Total Recall, close your eyes and listen to it
It's Lil B based music

[Outro]
Things change everyday, but BasedWorld keeps it real
That's the only thing I feel
Based Jam mixtape, this the only thing that's real
