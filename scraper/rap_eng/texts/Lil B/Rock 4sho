You already know, I'm making history every fucking day
Where I'm from man, you know I'm from the world


Never forgot where I come from
B-Town up baby, whole Bay area
Westside nigga, what it is

[Verse 1]
Seven street to Oakland, you know how we ride
Shout out to Richmond, I get that cash off top
I done got played, I done served fades
I done told 'em off top, keep your shit to yourself
I done told 'em off top I been rocking everything
Young bitch spitting, young bitch living
Got a young bitch and she suck and fuck

Now niggas came in, niggas came in with the 50 cal
With a pink bandana, low key
Niggas smoke that OG

Haters told me I would never be shit
So iced out, man that watch is nice

Niggas know I'm too real for this motherfucking rap shit
That's why I'm paid and I'm ugly as hell
Yeah real talk man, but I look so good with that motherfucking money
All I heard is everything niggas shitted on me
And I be fighting for crimes
I be looking at the houses man, from the bottom
Hood from the top of the mountain
Seen so much money, started loaning niggas
Til I got fucked over
