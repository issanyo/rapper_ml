[Intro]
It's our last chance y'all
It's all our last chance, fuck it, let's go

[Verse]
Our last chance at the game, you gon' see us wyling
I got that old school swag, Harlem stylin'
Took a page from the book I wrote
Can't see double eye leave when I write
Out of sight freestyle, out of line
Might leave you with a dollar sign
My life too real, I talk I don't gotta rhyme
You rappers all fake, all you do is rhyme
Y'all look up to me like computer time
People ain't past my level
Glock 9 look sick when the scope is metal
People catch that case then they plead the devil
Insane in the brain, catch me wherever
Got love for the Earth, got love for cheddar
Got love for my bitch, she let me fuck whenever
Man, this rap game mean and you stuck forever
Like Siamese twins, man, we stuck together
Man, I always keep it real, I don't change the weather
I'm cold like weather, might tote the Beretta
Black ops straps leave your body straight like a mirror
I'm the only rapper unsigned who really unsigned
I'm talking no corporate, just a billion dollar grind
Rap your whole life about 57 times
Came back from the dead, you bitches gon' feel me
That bitch suck my dick where I tuck my steel B
Trust a person as far as I know 'em
Size 'em up how I throw 'em
Everybody not golden
It's your attitude that make you special
I tote a special same time I moved that vessel
Got dope in the back like a cocaine special
Got rich in the game but the dough ain't get you
Niggas will catch you slipping, ain't nowhere special
Crackers catch you slipping, man, then drop them pieces
Hating on me? You don't know no beef bitch
Think it's a game but it's really some street shit
Man I used to be on the block 'til they put you on defense
I was smoking weed while you was sitting on bleachers
I was out doing life while you was relying on teachers
I'm so blessed to have no regrets to have
For real, what's the definition of bad?
I'm in the world on my own, the definition of dad
If I do any time in jail that's sad
Then what's your life being a repeat offender?
Take that slap on the wrist then go teach them gangsters
Worldwide thugging now we gon' teach them wankstas
Play all the time that way your life in danger
I'm so paranoid I stay strapped with the banger
Task force coming in even blastin' at strangers
No mask on my face so you know when I'm dangerous
Plus we thug with honor, ain't no one acting or staging
Thugs kill thugs in the hood but want to learn nothing
Don't want to earn something
Can't make excuses, go out and burn something
Change your whole life from nothing to something
Fuck the real, that's the end of discussion
When I rap it's spontaneous combustion
Lil B, it's nothing
Task force
