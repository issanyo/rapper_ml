[Verse : Lil B]
Watch out for the lick 'cause these haters ain't playing
I be watching your game, seeing that game
Motherfuckers so mad you better stay on the train
Stay in your own yard I ain't playing no games
These motherfuckers get rock with the same ass game
Motherfuckers get shot with that same ass aim
Like fuck that shit I ain't gonna be fuckin bitchin'
With these motherfuckers snitching
And with these motherfucker suckers living that fast round
Walking with their ass out, punk they pass out
Fuck 'em this is real game, real beef
Real motherfuckers sleep
You can hear me I'm a robot consider my voice the whole track
Can't comprehend all noise
These motherfuckers don't know that I'm like some poison
Come through man lead the voice in
The voice motherfuckers you all think it's the voice
Fuck them motherfuckers man the lick is my choice
Fuck a lick, fuck a lick man I watch da lick
