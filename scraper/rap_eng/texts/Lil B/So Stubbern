[Sample]
(You won't change your ways)

[Verse]
All we got is hood dreams we fantasizing
Smoke blowing out window, turn the AC on
Police is near
Peacoat hoodied up
Looking like a [?] very positive
Niggas read your eyes
Mine bloodshot, the pain inside and the strength
My niggas gone, it make me wanna cry
R. Kelly in the ghetto, niggas can't fly
Well actually you can
It all starts from your thoughts
You be real and stay real
It ain't on me cause it's in me
Fuck my enemies
Cowards and seven seas
I'm on land, feel the breeze
Amazing day when you're Lil B
You could learn a couple things from the boss

[Outro]
But you want that, you feel me
I don't understand
Niggas could really learn a lot from me
I'm telling you but you know you're so stubborn
Evil Red Flame nigga
You're just being so stubborn, why don't you just admit it
Lil B's the fucking rawest rapper to do it
I know it hurts to say it cause you've been hating, but say it
Evil Red Flame
