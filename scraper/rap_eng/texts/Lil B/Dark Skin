[Intro x2]
Whats real, lemme tell you about some things that i've seen
Real life let me tell you about somethings that i did
Definition of a real nigga, its just words, like tattoos it dont mean shit

[Verse 1]
Ride the bus devilish thoughts, my peoples possessed
Resort to violence as the proper choices (yea)
Everytime i walk in the room I'm getting stared at
I evened glared back, its ending like death threats
Proud to be from my city, but loosing respect
Dont nobody give a fuck about the blacks
Real shit, even blacks even killing off blacks
Blame it on slavery, but its the presidents, fact
Your losing grip

[Hook+ Lil B commentary]

[Verse 2]
They say its not so bad, why do i complain
Can't drive a dunger or scraper without getting pulled over
Gotta tie your dreads back not to scare people
Had to soften my voice, the courts think I'm evil
I could write 10 books, i can't even wear a hoodie
Without getting funny looks. like I'm bummy
Like I'm a joke shit, but nothing funny
I love life, and i love people
But society done showed me
All this black on black violence , everyones is not my homie
And most days I'm spending lonely, living life as a artist
And dont matter where u work, work can be a target
If you love in your heart, no matter where you started
Dead broke a couple years you could be ballin
It starts from you, change starts from you
Supposed to be a leader, just breathe a , emphysema
We need more black leaders, you could be a street soldier
You could be a poet just give the world what you owe it
I believe in you
