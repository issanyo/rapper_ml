You could break me out the strait jacket
This hip-hop is just play action
I switch off and I keep smashing
I'm a legend, fuck the rap-off
They say I can't do my thing
I'm a build my own lane
You come in, you get ran over
But damn, you sober. I'm the god emcee like hova
But I'm on another level and
My grind is over. the day
You're on your back
Like you're sitting in rovers
And he always prayed to god
I'm just bringing him closer
Feel like I'm doing a bid
And my mind in angola
You be food, then I'm cool
They tried to get over
I stopped picking up my phone
I won't get any closer
They watching my every step
Because I'm living in motion
They ask for my money
Seen it in the hood
I can't, feeling is open
They ask for my money
Every other day like I'm asking
For something
But when I had nothing they was laughing
They told me that I'd never make it rapping
It brings tears to see?
But I told you that I'd make it
14, I was living like my life was the pavement
And I wanted to die, couldn't nobody save me
Now I save my own self and
I'm on and I'm famous
And I deal with the haters
Ain't nobody gonna take away what I built
Fuck the death threats, small impostors
But really got the love
But they just choosing that option
When I started to live better, they started to hate
I still got the same brain that
Caught all the cases
I've still got the same eyes and
Seen all the places
But I ain't never been faking, it's not a game
It's not the trail blazers
Throwing shots but we dying
And the rap game
It's the slave trade
No time for meditation
Turning into robots
The devil is money
It's not even human
The people die for a piece of paper
It's so stupid
Man, live however you do it
I guarantee, you see your life as a child
And make you at your all, just make
Sure that you smile
But dying every day, ma's look at me now
There was hating, but I never stop
I wanted to drop, but based god
[?]
I gotta really notice my chance
Make history, man
Three back, I was feeling like "damn! "
You don't know how I felt
When I was washing my hands
Off that filth that was around
I'd never be down
One the streets I'm gone
I never be around
Cause the hood is a lie
Man, you better wake up before you're
Dead or surprised
I'm just trying to save myself man
For real, but they trapped in the middle
Don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's too simple
I just wanna know where I come from
The truth, tell me, before I desolve
It's connected to the woods
The wilderness is my home
The world say I'm bad because of my color
But they don't get the fact
That I say that I love you
People given the option to hustle
Just take it and, I swear to god
If you're willing to struggle
Once you pass the bottom
You gonna make it to the top
It's a lot of hate up in the world
Just make sure that you watch
