[Intro]
I used to have so many Rolls Royce dreams
I hustle hard for the simple goal
6 Kiss

[Verse 1]
I used to dream about the cars I drive, fourth gear
Switch gear, steal a couple cars, and I drive to work
Make it work, then have a dream, handle things, understand
I do what I do, but the simple fact I have a goal
Puts me in another class of real niggas
Too trill to deal with it, too real too fuck with ya
I bounce back, then duct tape for Ben Frank, it's insane
Think about two times of relapse, I go back (yeah!)
I seen the hustle at the hardest shortest time
I come out with mighty profit, so stop it
Maybach dreams, overseein' success
That's a quick flash type of thing, Kodak moment
We in the lighter things, give me leeway
To break a simp off of quick cash
Rolls Royce, double up the way class, straight gas
Passin' by like Steve Nash, three flags, heat flash
More robbers in your home, pass that, old school
I'm past that, my mindset is obvious, the winning team is obvious
I'm goin' for the gold, with the simple plan of coppin' this
Candy coated tinted window thing with the heated seats
The girls never far out, they beat my meat
Expertise, materialistic, gifted
Man, I'm climbin', I am like plies, heavy grind
A real nigga, I ain't gotta say it my life speaks for itself
Tattoo with good wealth, hustle with the smooth stealth

[Hook]
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh

Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh

Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
I'm hittin' finches off the coolest missus, splittin' dough
Now where we goin' with it?
He to the bank, I'm to the safe
Savin' for the thing that makes shit worth the wait
Popular, the girls jock for name brand
The card game is insane
I recall the girls saying, you need to rock claim before you fuck these
Watch this slate ho suck things that are embedded in my brain
That's really not my main drive, but it's a small thing
That made me want the range, Rolls Royce dreams is okay
Detach yourself from the objects of hell
And you can see your dreams as well
Just a ego itself, I promise that
Figure out your motivation, should I see my motivation
In the hatin', I use hatin' as a small relation
I come impatient, guaranteed I win the racin', like I'm ragin'
My hustle game is razor sharp
I wear the bird berry when I'm drivin'
The Rolls Royce on another island

[Hook]
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, Rolls Royce, uh-huh
