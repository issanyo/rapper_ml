[Chorus]
Block report, I said nigga this my block report (yes)
I said nigga this the block report
This the block report, 05 fuck em
Come act a pope
Nigga this the block report, yeah
Let's go, nigga this the block report
Nigga this the block report

[Verse]
Beefin' on the block, I move blocks still
Niggas look mad but he is not real
Walk through niggas know, I'm so ill
UGK niggas know I'm so trill
Woods, this for sale
I need that bag report
Twenty blocks recorded
I'm playin' with a lil extortion
Niggas get they wig split (ow)
Pick up money, I'm looking, through the back door
Fake money, real problems, you get what you asked for
This way more than I asked for
I still give niggas money off the strip when they ask for it
I'm off the street and I get too bad
Five .45's raise you like a single dad
Leave me alone like a single parent
California nigga, with the dirty heroin

[Chorus]
This my recount, nigga this the block report
This the block report, nigga this my block report
Nigga this the block report, nigga this the block report
Nigga this my block report, nigga this my block report (yes)
Nigga this my block report, nigga this my block report (let's go)

[Verse 2]
My niggas, dopes in Maserati
He live in taxi's when it's so nasty
Standing outside lookin' like he on acid
I really wanna serve him, but I know it's bad
So I gotta run my lane
'Cause you know both niggas wanna say my name
And he tryna play the middleman
Faggot nigga play yo part, thing that you never did
I got money due cocaine but I'm still
A street nigga its an insane feelin'
What's real or fake? I don't know you tell me
Tell you what I know, what I know
What's my cut? Niggas spend it at Spencer's
Shoutouts the the niggas with millions
Shoutout to the niggas with billions
The whole world, feed ya children
Let's get it, let's go

[Chorus]
Nigga this my block report, nigga this my block report
Nigga this my block report, nigga this my block report
Nigga this my block report, I said nigga this my block report
05 Fuck em, know what I'm sayin'
Nigga this my block report, nigga this my block report

[Outro]
Shoutout the the real people still making it out here
Ya feel me, these hard streets man
They press you, they make you gotta get money
Like fuck it, know what I'm saying, let's do us
