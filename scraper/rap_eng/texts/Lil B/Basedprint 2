This Lil B, yeah
You already know, man
Base - Damn
You already know this is the BasedPrint Volume 2
Part two, whatever you want to call it
Yeah, your little nigga flawless

Take a deep breath in the booth, one time

Taking niggas out is releasing the trigger
Blowing out your fucking brain
Bullet holes in your liver
Going to the E.R
It ain't no saving you niggas
Just another dead body
Got to throw it in the river
Some can't take the heat
Man, I'm off of the Richter
Some are moving the charts
I'm constantly making hits
Scope one [?]
If you patient you miss
And if you pull the trigger steady, man
Option is if you hit
And put a red beam on it
For the Option is Fit
Man, I got a gun to carry off on my hips
Got M-16 man
It hangs as hell in the sticks
Leaving niggas in wells man
It's so sick
No option for help
When you're caught, that's it
Pulling guns [?] off my belt
Like Batman did
Getting information and help
Because my pac can't kiss
Like PacMan did when he slapped that bitch
Got killed five man
Damn that bitch
Imma kill this [?] or make em
What I did
I got the outbreak in cases, man
I'm head for no traces
Looking over faces
Cause I'm asking for no playlists
Please ask me no questions
20/20 ain't asking
Lights, camera, flashes
Wondering how I'm passing
Because I'm a motherfucking savage
I grab it
Paper and plastic
I stated my options
And I expressed it on tracks
Started an epidemic and I expressed it with gats
I'm angry and black
And didn't work together
Now I put my mail together
And now I'm rich forever
Fuck what niggas talking about
Hating under cover, man
I see it through my eyes
Reverse effect in the slumber
I'm dead in the --damn, damn, damn
Under--and so, I'm alive
I'm so alive
Based World Volume
Yes, I'm so based in this motherfucker
Like I said this is the Based Volume Trois
