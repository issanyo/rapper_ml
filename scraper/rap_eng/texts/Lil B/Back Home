[Intro: Lil B]
Green Flame, I'm a tell you like
Still in the hood, driving everyday through
Like "this shit is crazy man I can't believe this shit"

[Verse: Lil B]
This shit hurts your heart when your mom get evicted
But I keep my head up, my game is never restricted
Niggas said I threw salt when I took that loss
But I tell you like this, bitch, I've never been shift
Riding that new presidential is shifted
And I ride the more whips
Stacks, that's sick shit
I'm a tell you like this, niggas was rocking on sixth street
Talking to the people, man, the rest was history
My life was crazy, homeless people giving me Peet's coffee
Charile, thank you for showing me
Never forget, I see real early
Giving me some game, niggas was rocking too early
Meeting niggas in the back like
"bro, what you doing?"
"Shit I'm trying to get straight like grown ass men but we only 14 and 15 and 16
That's the crazy thing
Niggas coming out with weird dreams, wanting to be doctors
But the streets change everything
I'm a go to college and be a neurosurgeon
Fuck with me and I'm a bruise you and try to save you
I'm an Oakland Raider and a 'Fransisco 49er
Dope in the- that's why your boy got recliners
People watching on the block, man, every hour
Niggas, on the, man that shit follow
Same crackers playing games like there is no tomorrow
Riding in the chop, looking zorro
Black mask, black shit, everything awkward
Living life like a movie, not Shottas
Niggas talking about the players club, Fuck them
I ain't talking about this shit, man, hit the ball
Niggas hitting twenty stack till tomorrow
I'm a come with that metal like Dave Navarro
Whats you want to do man, shit on my back?
People getting wrapped up, chased off the map
I'm a tell you like this, I don't no money from it

[Outro: Lil B]
I'm a dumb out on these pussy ass, bitch ass niggas man
I'm a tell you like this man, these niggas can't fuck with me man, we ain't even-
I'm back on that shit, I'm back on that
I'm a tell you like-
Niggas don't got a choice but to fuck with me, so I'm a tell them
Like man, fuck these niggas man, to the court bro
I'm a tell you like this man, I'm back on my uh, other shit
Green flame other, you know, yeah
We back to the home niggas
