[Intro]
Yea time flies nigga
Feel me?
How you going to hear my lyrics
It’s your boy Lil Boss you feeling me

[Verse1]
I'm thugged out pissed off for a reason you feelin me
Yea ah ha yah if you rocking with Lil B from the
Jungle you feelin me stand up
What up you know what i'm saying
J Cole what it do
Kendrick Lamar what it is
Asap Rocky what it do
Mackmiller what it is
I struggle for so long Brian to the pro low
People want to play game betrayed by the Dorums
Who really save you when your heart got no loss
White people kill you eat richer and then roll off
I ain’t tapped in I’m just saying what goes on
Friends leave so long money leave so wet
I’m going to double up until I see a blind man
I am fit for the game because I see it before I can
Live way harder than the child who was brainwashed
In the ghetto low income just drive bys
My other friends brother got a masses one brother
Locked up once another can’t see his brother
Still got a wife and kids and an [?]
Really want to make me cry because that's really how i rap
Trying to survive until we see the bigger picture
Black people hits you hard but they got to stay with you
Never want to kill you just old people mislead you
Old people tired of it
Young people just believe it when you can afford
That's close but not really pay attention to those
Things free Willy and free anybody that’s locked
Up in the system cause when you my age
It’s a blessing when you with us
Survival of the fittest white man's business
Everyday the vision keeps spittin

[Hook]
Everyday multiple mind states
The only thing I got to fucking say
Gotta play the white man game
All kind of ways without boosting the crime rate
Everyday celebrating multiple mind states

[Verse2]
I want OJ lawyer cause I take risk hand to hand
Got manners I can’t take shit
Candy cans like whole cuffs
Everything I got duck taped
Snug fit non violent bitch I don’t try shitting
We need the revolution tapped in
Took my mistake no retaliation
How we gon' eat nigga how we going to sleep
Where they want to hold you down
You working got to start thinking
Of when your vision is really free
Disappear off this earth and no ID tax free
I rather run into tax meet I ain’t playin
With no six and park just tax free
Just ask me you probably want to ask free
Like come real like lawyers tax fees
Everything that got a book the dollar tree
Ease dollar that's my partner
Acknowledge me I fuck around with the
Killer that will knock you down
Ain’t nobody better than God himself
Except when I’m around I write what they saying
Saying what I feel It's a gift to do what I do cause
Its kills the mind to play tricks on you everyday
Got to keep up especially in the fucking bank
Number two most dangerous city in the way
If you survive the Oakland you can make it
Around the whole fucking world you can
Make it Lil Boss

[Hook]
Everyday multiple mind states
Only thing I got to fucking say
Got to play the white man game
All kind of ways
Without boosting the crime rate
Everyday celebrate multiple mind state
