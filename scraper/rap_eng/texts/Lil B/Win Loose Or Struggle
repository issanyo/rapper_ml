Yea
I want to say free all my...
You feel me? People locked down mentally
I'm not talkin bout just, I'm talkin bout they mind right now, yea feel me?

Niggas like me I gotta hustle
I give a fuck about the muscle
I'm a win, lose or struggle bitch

Y'already know it's your boy Lil B, come check me out man
While every nigga from my section gone or fuckin died
Man if you look up in my eye and I don't be surprised
I'm surprised it went deep with my motherfuckin self, man
Fuck that man, I'm a fuckin get in there
I know some niggas that go for respect man
Bitches in highschool, I'm a show you bout the tec
Why I come so direct, cause a nigga off the B man
Fill my cup of lean, I'm a show you bout the team man
My bitch ball purple, I don't fuck with the green
Last time I got jacked I was up to 5 days
Watch him with the chop nigga, leave him sideways
Man, ugh, shouts out to the bucky, shouts out to West Burgun
Shout out to Oakland
Shout out to Richmond, you feel me?
Aye man, I'm a show you pussies how to fuckin get with them
Feel me in the dope house, smoking weed in the kitchen
I'm in the dope house smoking weed in the kitchen
I fuck with my bitches and I slide on 26's

Okay, okay

Niggas like me I gotta hustle
I give a fuck about the muscle
I'm a win, lose or struggle bitch
