[Verse]
Welcome to the based house, bitches and pistols
Nigga try to break in, you gon' get your issue
I feel it in my mind, I'm close to the sky
Seein' visions when I'm high, I'm controlling them pies
I be selling off work, I'm controlling the price
You can come up stairs, I got trophies and diamonds
Plaques on the wall, don't be surprised
Why do kids cry? I won't go high
Bitch gon' see me in the hood or the sky
You gon' see raised hell, I'm gon'
Started to cry and it started to rain
People ask for a feature, you can't teach the teacher
I sure feel lonesome at the bottom of the totem
Won't nobody quote 'im, won't nobody show 'im
There's crust in my eye, but my blood turned golden
My soul on these streets, the people keep me focused
Stay clicked up had to partner up with Oakland
Richmond, Vallejo, Sacramento
San Francisco got that work right in a rental
Spots in Sacramento, look bad like New Orleans
People tough indoors, coming out start groaning
Stay brave, you at war every morning
Pick ya battle, I won't lose pickin' battles
Taking losses everyday; look, I fought my shadow
Took a look in the mirror, now I battle myself
There's black smoke in the room; I'm on fire, myself
Been around the whole world and ain't nobody else
The same as the next man, play the cards you was dealt
If you got a brain, consider yourself lucky
If you got the motivation, go and get that money
