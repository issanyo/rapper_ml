[Intro]
Yeah, man, like I said, man
I'ma tell you who in the building, man
It's that pretty boy, man, you already know that pretty bitch, man
I do what I do, I do what I say
Man, I got so many bitches, it ain't even funny
I count on my hand, I got about ten bitches
So what that mean?
It mean I get it, I get that sack, man, everyday
Man, I'm looking for a sack, I'm looking for a check
I'm looking for what I do, you know what I'm saying?
No homo, I-I-I got so many bitches, man
You niggas can't see that
Man, we coming up, man, I know Lil B, you feel me?

[Verse 1]
I been selling dope for 'bout five months (Mmph)
Baby mama drama, I beat my bitch up (Mmph)
Domestic violence case, I don't give a fuck
I keep my bitch down and keep my hoes up (Mmph)
Choke my bitch out 'cause she lied to us (Mwah, baby, mwah)
I'm so insecure the bitch lied to us
I'm including you, 'cause it's all of us
I told her, "Fuck the crew, please, all of us"
Bitch just want a check and a better view (Dumb bitch)
Fuck that bitch in the ass, for that money too
Bitch asked for some money and some new shoes
Bitch gon' fuck my podna and I'm being rude (Huh) (Mmph)
Hoes ask for shit, bitch'll make a habit
I was serving bad way before the rapping (Figaro)
I only know work, I don't know trapping (What's up, bitch?)
I never had a job, I don't know (Yeah) rapping (Mmm)

[Chorus]
I can't be a pimp 'cause I buy pussy (Brrrrrr)
My big bruh doing life over pussy (Figaro)
Bitch, stay away 'cause (Damn) I take (Woo) pussy (Woo)
I never been (Woo) a pimp (Woo) 'cause I buy pussy
I can't be a pimp 'cause I buy pussy
My big bruh doing life over pussy (Figaro)
Bitch, stay away 'cause (Woo) I take (Woo) pussy (What up, ho?)
I never (What up, bitch?) been a pimp 'cause I buy pussy

[Verse 2]
Real dope boys got no bitches (No homo)
I ain't took no fucking shower, bitch ain't sucking my dick (Trifling bitch)
Where the dope fiends? I'm 'bout to make it Christmas
Fuck a dope fiend in the ass, bitch, I'm so grimy (Figaro)
Yeah, I got them packs and fucking handbags, bitch
Yeah, I flex purses, and I got them bags
I'm off 100%, yep, bitch, you know I'm off it (Dr. Phil)
No homo, I strip niggas and I'm proud of it
I flex purses and them handbags
Knocking bitches out, and I'm serving tags (Figaro) (Mmm) (Mwah)

[Chorus]
I can't be a pimp 'cause I buy pussy (Brrrrrr)
My big bruh doing life over pussy (Figaro)
Bitch, stay away 'cause I take pussy
I never been a pimp 'cause I buy pussy
I can't be a pimp 'cause I buy pussy (BasedGod)
My big bruh doing life over pussy (Figaro)
Bitch, stay away 'cause I take pussy
I never been a pimp (Mmph) 'cause I buy pussy (Ughhhh)
