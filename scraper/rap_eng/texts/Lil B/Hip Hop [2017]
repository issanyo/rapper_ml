[Intro]
Welcome to the most marvellous show on Earth
We have Lil B
We have The BasedGod
We have Based World
If you love Hip Hop, I need you out your seats
BasedGod

[Verse 1]
Remember I was younger, I always loved music
So now it's an honor to write and produce it
I wanna give props to everyone that's before me
I'm a real MC, no, I'm not a phony
I take pride in my craft, took two years off to perfect my pen
Now I'm back again
I should have saved my friend, because I'm cooler than a polar bear
Shoutout North Oakland, it gets real cold there
In Mosswood Park, like James Kennedy
Don't live your whole life being enemies
I've got love for so many, I wanna help so many
So I stop being friendly, cause there's hate and there's envy
I'm getting money now, so the fake don't offend me
Up on the Breakfast Club, but I don't know DJ Envy
HOT97 get busy
Ebro, Funk Flex, I'm on the mic stick with me

[Chorus]
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop

[Verse 2]
You're alive and you're beautiful
Let me tell you something if it's not getting through to you
Some people lie, that's business as usual
How you take to standing on your man, you not spiritual
Feelin' like [?]
In that Maserati Fox, ridin' round Jay hood
Shout out to Brooklyn, because I know that's Jay hood
I listen to The LOX so I know about J Hood
Say Lil B, my name is good
Cyphers with Kendrick Lamar
And I ain't spittin' a bar
Unless you got fifty thousand or more
To be a rapper, is an honor
Enlighten the people and you can let they mind prosper
Because ain't nothin' cool about wastin' your time
It's pressure, Charles Hamilton with compressors
A little Kanye in the message

[Chorus]
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
