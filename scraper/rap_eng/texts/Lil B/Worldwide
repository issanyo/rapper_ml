[Sample: Yeah Yeah Yeah's "Runaway"]
Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
(I'd) like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

[Intro]
BasedPrint Volume 2
It's your boy Lil B
It's a victory, yeah, we did it
Worldwide salute!
Based music worldwide, salute
We in this, you feel me?

[Verse]
Talk a lot of shit and get dumped by the rockets, man
And if you need a nigga, got a rock in his pockets, man
And watch this shit, up chop, I block for the dope land
And after I finish, take tips with the Birdman
And, I'm saying man
Fuck that illegal, illegal
You gonna get some jacked
And niggas, young or old and feeble
Bullets have no face
I'm there, fucked up, shit
And in your chest, hollow bullets you stuck with
Unless plastic surgery will help you
But ain't got to money to replace your face
But I got a gun that will lower your heartrate
And it sucks that you got that
Heartache, ducked it in the park
Where your body parts are
Don't let me get the pistol
Whip it till my palms are red
Throw [?] tops
Gone hit you, don't squirm and switch
I got the Glock, shoot you, don't come back
When I was five, introduced to pot weed
Whatever you need, smoking my trees
Holding Glocks tagged on the blocks
Chilling with my niggas, man, fade on the new blocks
You too young to get swishas we we ask some dude
Dude, man, in front of the store, with his hands on his shoes
Bottle of 51 with his brain in a trance
Everybody think him a wild man, some weed man
Roll of the swishas, let's get keyed, smokin these trees
But you niggas say I'm young and almost--fuck
But can't amount to the fact
Because I'm little big things being counted, the rap
Because sometimes man I'm doubted in fact
Because they try to get me all--
I'm mounted and tacked
Keep steady routine, Stay on the mount when you flap
Cause I won't flap, I froze
Fuck niggas that bo hop--that means you ride dick
Ya hinchmen, I got bodyguards-fuck em
Ready to cut up your body parts and lynches
Making top views as long as i'm mentioned
Throwing up rap lines, top of the division
After I'm done making moves, I'm listed
Getting rich off of niggas that deep riding and pimpin
Fuck all the newspapers, Times Square are scared
Cause I've made it ten times with flare
And I'm never undercover, like to sip wine with the mayors
Put nothing in the drink, switch mine with theirs
Now niggas all flexed, with their spines impaired
This that gourmet shit, sniffing coke and paying up
These niggas sniffed lines, break broads from staying us
Spray us, fuck em, man, I spray them
Ya feel me? Drop back the territory, shit

[Outro]
You know man, I'm lined up, man
I fuck with the police, man
It's like, you know, we all mafia status
We all in the streets
We all thugging outchea
Ya heard me, What it is
We all gang banging
But I ain't banging no colors
I'm banging the streets, bro
I'm banging worldwide
I bang for the world
Fuck with me
