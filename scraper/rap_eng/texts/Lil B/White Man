[Intro]
White man thought me how to charge a bitch fast
White man thought me how to break a bitch, y'know I'm sayin'
You know we keep it 100 man, y'know I'm sayin'
In America we tear down these hoes
White men though me everything, y'know I'm sayin'
Don’t blame it on me
Blame white man, y'know I'm saying
Lil B - Hey!

[Hook]
Slap a bitch, slap a bitch, slap a bitch, ride
Knock a bitch, knock a bitch, knock a bitch out
Slap a bitch, slap a bitch, slap a bitch, ride
Knock a bitch, knock a bitch, knock a bitch out

White bitch in Castro Valley want to cash me out
Damn near almost knock that faggot bitch out
Dump a bitch in the trunk with the speed bumps
Bitch trying to play games you a fucking punk
Lil Wayne said these hoes ain’t loyal though
So I’mma charge every fucking bitch that I know
Put your face in a wall, boy, I swear to God

Go out and set it off I'm a shoot them all
Bitch telling on me that’s a death wish (Figaro)
Knock the bitch out like Chris Brown
