If I'll never ever get over you
I don't care if I never ever find someone new

It's your boy Lil B
I don't care if I'll never ever get over you
I don't care if I never ever find someone new

True talk, I could never leave the rap game
Cause when I was doing bad, rap came
The rap game, means more than me
Hip hop immortal, my soul forever
I will stay loyal, you feel me?
Hip hop, I swear to God I owe you
The people so based, the world I can't complain
Niggas cry about them simple things
I cry when people die, that's the only thing
I keep moving, OG, never be stupid
If you by with this shooter, you gon be shootin
Niggas fake man, and I can't be that
Hip hop told me, most people is raps
I really feel ya
Thank you

It's Lil B
I'd never, I'll love you to the end

(I don't care if I'll never get over you
I don't care if I never ever find someone new)

Hip hop told me: niggas scared to be different
Hip hop said: Lil B, you really got me
Rawest rapper alive, right here
And the gods you see niggas going down
Man, I stay surprised rappin
Your whole life, you was made for me
Hip hop that's real, hip hop Lil B

(I don't care if I'll never get over you)
I feel you

Shouts out to the music, I just keep on doing it
Amusement, sicken drop top, I'm cruising
In hip hop this is you, it's a angel, I be lonely
Hip hop â€“ you my friend and homie
Hip hop and my mom so sick off work
Hip hop and my family is motivation
Keep it playin

(I don't care if I'll never get over you
I don't care if I'll never get over you)
It's Lil B, really love it
(I don't care if I never ever find someone new)
Hip hop, this is to the end, this for life
Yea

Lil B I swear you're my motivation
Niggas keep on talkin, keep on pushin
Man you in the game, no rookie or sucker man
You wouldn't be here if you wasn't bustin
Lil B is hip hop, hip hop is based God
Based God is almighty and that's real

(I don't care if I'll never get over you)
You feel me?

Yea I'll fuck any bitch that'll hate a deal man
It's free for real and I'm serious man
I'm so sick of this bullshit, you feel me?
Hip hop for life, you bitch
And really, we getting rich
In this hip hop shit, Lil B
Far out, I love you for life
That's right

(I don't care if I'll never get over you
I don't care if I'll never get over you
I don't care if I never ever find someone new)
