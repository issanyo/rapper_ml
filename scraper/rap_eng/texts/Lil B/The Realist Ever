Can kill it
Can do it
Can kill it
I can give away, no

Base world for life

Been through the fire been through the rain
Took ten steps and still feelin all the pain
My nose still bleed because these suckers all lame
I caught ten trains still stayin in my lane
I own a whole road, nigga come ten foe
I fold you p**sy niggas like napkins fold
Fuck the rap game this is the streets and niggas enforce it
Until I hit him with the mack now look what it cost ya'
This is last resort while I'm chillin on the island
Paying off my hard work, all them sparks is flying
Feelin like a new years or the beginning of Christmas
Got a sniper on call I put your ass on my wish list
I wish death on no man, even rapists got raped before
I think deeper I ain't givin a pass
I'm just sayin peep game, look where they come from and look who they are today
I'm just BasedGod Velli shout out to 2Pac, it's solid in my belly
You feel me, and it's fucked up, killers get respect on the streets
I just do me and they love me for being real instead of fake
One time bitch

I'm the realest shit
I'm the realest shit
I'm the realest yeah
I'm the realest

Suckers won't pop off, why even play around
You got kids thinking it's cool to put they life down
Never will I say I got young niggas on deck
Who the fuck you think you are, you ain't Jesus you're just a bitch
Why you frontin kids dope and tellin em not to snitch
My brother was a fiend and kept serving them [?]
No loyalty, you niggas all hustling backwards
Killin off the same kind as most niggas is bastards
Bitch fall back, and.. fall back and call your father
This is said niggas be high, that's depressing
Niggas schizophrenic, not even know they conditions
Go into the fucking doctor and go get your ass tested
And I'm finna do that shit cuz bitch I ain't even perfect
But at least I'm real enough to show these people a purpose
Instead of doing the same thing, that's why these nigga is cursed with
Bitch I'm better than the hood I'm an African king bitch
One thousand

[3x]I'm the realest (yeah)
It's Lil Boss, Lil B the realest ever
Yeah

And nobody felt my pain
We all got pain
Everybody got problems, everybody got something to complain about
I tell you like this man
They ain't gon' stop me from the bottom to the top
Shots out everybody that been rocking with me from the stop to the drop
You know from the scraper to the drop top
It ain't gon' stop
