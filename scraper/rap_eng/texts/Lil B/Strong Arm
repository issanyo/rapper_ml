[Intro]
I wanna say shout out
To all the beautiful girls
You feel me?
That love Lil B
We do this every day
I'm eating

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I might as well sell a brick
I might as well push shit
But all you niggas
Is snitching and pussy
Who can i trust in this game full of rookies?
Who can i trust with the money and the bushes?
I can't even trust my kid
Cus people be faking
Walking two face like 2face
I hit my son with the gun
If he don't die for me
I stopped fucking with niggas
That won't ride for me
Niggas too fake and i see
With them snake eyes
Hit you with the burner
You gone learn
You gone meet god like niggas that i knew
Died too fast
Like death too close
See the bitch though
Stay in my own lane cus niggas act pussy
I fuck pussy
Then i laugh at you pussies
G5 nigga with the swag and the pussy Lil B

[Bridge]
You know what i'm saying?
05 Fuck Em
You know, just different levels
Every day we walking through it
I'm just paying homage to Lil b
That's all im doing in this one
Straight up, collector's rare art

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Met niggas on the corner
Then i hit licks
I wear the same clothes
I'm a dirty bitch
I'm a dirty ass nigga with a clean dick
Fucked a bitch in the ass then she sucked my dick
Balling like this should be illegal
I'm a real street nigga like Benny Siegel
I don't know old english just desert eagle
I'ma extort em cus i'm fucking people
This is for the money, i know niggas evil
I fuck you with the hands until i got over
Beat you, nigga i'm gonna pay a visit
Choke your bitch ass out, we go another route
I keep shit poistive
Niggas playing with me
That's a violation, you gonna pay 50
For all my respect
Bitch i'm King Griffy
Shoot 3 niggas im rascist
When you see me
Hit em with the stainless
Nigga i ain't playing
Robbing niggas off the block
You better come exchange it

[Outro]
You know what i'm sayin?
05 Fuck Em mixtape nigga
I'm stainless out here
You know what i'm sayin?
Fuck Em nigga
B town always, wolf pack always
Bay area always
Niggas can't be mad
Lil B real, you know what i'm sayin?
That's yo problem
But my problem is going to the top
We sellin 100 million records
All that shit man
I ain't playing with this shit
We doing the most nigga
Lil B, you know what i'm sayin?
Sleep on a nigga, you know what i'm sayin?
Get woke up, you know what i'm sayin?
Come to see your dream real quick
You know what i'm sayin?
I'ma fuck it too bitch
You know how we getting this money?

05 Fuck Em man, Lil B, man
Listen to that first verse nigga
