[Intro: Yung Knxw]

[Verse 1: Yung Knxw]
Jimmy Neutron, damn I gotta blast
And if a nigga testing it'll be his last
[?] put 'em in a hearse
Rapping like I'm gifting, I didn't lift the curse
Give me bands, give me bands when he at his worst
[?] through all the hurt
Been about my green like some fucking turf
This a Louis V pouch, nah it ain't no purse
You can't finesse my heart bitch I know my worth
It get ugly in the streets but keep God first
Ran up a thousand bands, now they wish the worst
No I don't do no pills like [?]
Know that fake love really get niggas murked
Keeping silent cause you know I'ma shoot first
Many men wish death but I seen it first
No you can't [?]

[Chorus: Yung Knxw]
Old hoes, new drip
Jet lag, five trips
Big boof, [?]
Good gas, don't trip
Old hoes, new drip
Jet lag, five trips
Big boof. [?]
Good gas, don't trip

[Pre-Verse: Lil B]
It's your boy Lil B

[Verse 2: Lil B]
We the real bush boys, niggas know the drill
Feeling like a Geto Boy how I'm moving still
Riding with the piece and I keep the peace
Hanging out in Texas now I'm on the beach
Shout out rap a lot, I really rap a lot
I be in the studio when the package drop
I got them pretty girls up in that new Benz
All I do is get money nigga, fuck friends
All my friends is [?]
You already know I'm saying fuck my friends
Shout out [?], he a real legend
Hate on Lil B, 187
You gotta understand, you gotta understand
Every night I had a plastic spoon up in my hand
I'm really from the grind
I got that dirty wine
But you know I don't dirty wine
Play around with me you be all fine
Mix match like a chess board
Play get your checks drawn
Niggas know the drill
Lil B bitch, yeah I'm for real
I really rap a lot
Shout out to Geto Boys man, we rap a lot

[Chorus: Yung Knxw]
Old hoes, new drip
Jet lag, five trips
Big boof, [?]
Good gas, don't trip
Old hoes, new drip
Jet lag, five trips
Big boof. [?]
Good gas, don't trip
