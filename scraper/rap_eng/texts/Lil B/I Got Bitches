[Intro]
Welcome to Based
Welcome. This is Lil B
Everybody put your hands in the air

[Verse 1]
I'm rolling through these cits
I got bitches on my dick
These niggas fuck with me
Because I have respect
And cause I Based freestyle
They gotta cut me a check
All these bitches on my dick
And I just want some sex
I say "that's alright!
Baby you're OK! My name's Lil Boss
And I'm here to stay
Man my name's Based God
Come fuck with me
All these bitches on my dick
And I just want you to see

[Hook]
I got bitches, yeah!

Everybody put your hands in the air
My name's Lil B. Lil B for Lil Boss

[Verse 2]
She let me suck her
Let me do some things
She let me see her naked
She let me fuck her face
I do what I want
She lets me do what I please
I said I got bad bitches
She said "oh that's not me"
I say "you're my bitch!"
I say "you're my bop!"
I say "I fuck you all day
And I will not stop"
I said "I'm here for life
Bitch you gotta love me
My name's Lil Boss
But they call me Lil B!"

[Verse 3]
I got all these hoes
And I don't know what to do
They ask me if I share
I'm asking "who are you?"
My dude is Hugh Hefner and he fucks with me
I said "Hugh Hefner man, I got more bitches than you"
He said "that's not right!"
He said "you are a liar!"
I said "Hugh Hefner, you see my bitches tonight?"
And I'm young BasedGod and I dare you to see
And I gotta question who got more bitches than me!
