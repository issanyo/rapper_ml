I'm a man in love with a pure heart
Someone above sent me a work of art
The happiness i feel
Is so very real
You smiled at me and i sat down and cried
And on that day all the evil in me died
I don't care what i used to do
That wasn't really me
How can i thank you

Baby doll
Baby doll
I will always love you baby doll

We walked down the aisle and made a bond
The sculptor waved his magic wand
And created a work of art
You and i will never part
And now you're willing to give me a child
On one condition i stop running wild
You taught me to stand tall
You are my baby doll

Baby doll
Baby doll
I will always love you baby doll

You are my goddess
And god has blessed the two of us

Baby doll
Baby doll
I will always love you baby doll
