Alarm clock ring
And it's time to get up
It's time to do that funky strut

I'm a funky man
I got funky bones
I'm funky man
My name is Dee Dee Ramone

Well let me tell you about myself
I play the bass in a punk rock band
Been to all the world
Even to Japan
And nothing can surprise me man
I've seen it all
Had a ball
Someone should make a Dee Dee doll

Well alright
I'm a funky guy
Well alright
I'm a funky guy
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa funky
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa funky
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa funky

I'm a lucky guy
I got the world on a string
If I could do it over
I wouldn't change a thing
Sometimes I call myself Dee Dee King
I like to hear the birds on paradise sing

I thank the good man above
That he gave me a sexy blonde to love
Now she wants a Mercedes Benz
Would make more sense
These are the problems I'm gonna have

Not a millionaire
Not doing too bad
When we sell the Camaro
I will be glad

I'm a funky
Funky guy
I'm a funky
Funky guy
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa funky
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa funky
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa

Didn't have much of an education
I live every day likes it's my vacation
Got a the dog
I'm the one that sings ya... WARTHOG!
For the last ten years I've been doing the bop
And I'm still not tired
I'm never gonna stop
I like what I'm doing and I'm having fun
Here's some advice for everyone
Try to make the most out of every day
And remember that DRUGS DON'T PAY!

I'm a funky
Funky guy
I'm a funky
Funky guy
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa funky
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa funky

I like rap
And hip hop
I like hardcore
And punk rock
I like hot-dogs, franks and beans
I grew up in Forrest Hills Queens
I like to win
Don't like to fail
I like to get
The bill's in the mail

I'm a funky guy
I got funky bones
I'm a funky guy
My name is Dee Dee Ramone

Well alright
I'm a funky guy
Well alright
I'm a funky guy

Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa funky
