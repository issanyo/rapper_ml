[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
That tan flag, that's on me
You see your bitch, that's on me
We don't window shop, we hug the block
I can't leave the streets all lonely
Machete swing like Danny
My esse's that's brown power
9-11 turbo that's horse power
That escobar, that's white power
I keep powder like Montana
Tony Tone, my drug grammer
I make it snow on St. Nick
What the fuck you thought, I am Santa
If her pussy dry like cana, the hoe gotta go right now
I keep that .40 in my hamper, too dirty for the road right now
You keep on thinking I won't clap ya, cousin Joe reload right now
For them bucks we'll Warren Sapp ya, two 9's on spine back now
Nigga roll up, stop smoking on a roach, cause you remind of Pacquiao
They yelling Papi now, my movement get around
Tan

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
Leaning all day, trapping all night
You look like a lick if I ain't liking that price
Youngin's won't fold, hit you for a strike
Everything's a go, bitch we chopping on sight
Chopping on site (x6)
Hit 'em with with the drum we ain't coming back twice
Lay his pussy ass down, boy we chopping on sight

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
Triple H with that weaponry, fuck boy
Leave your head where your legs would be
Summer Slam with that pedigree
Flawless, fuck her mouth and she jawless
Got that work off in that Taurus
Driving 'round with hard bargin's on
Ric Flair, aka Brick Flair
You looking like you a Lil Scrappy
Them 'K 'K 'K clips near
Shit's real, slip and get your wig peeled
Chopper make 'em bounce right to left hit that shoulder lean
Tip Drill, Cutthroat, all my niggas straight cut throat
We chop blocks you get cut loc, showtime you hit front row
Your front line can get drumline when that drum go
Them tips singing like Mariah Cannon
Pop that pussy then I pop a xanny
Uh, got it out the door
Got hoes that are shipping off the O's
Molly Maid got her slipping off her clothes
She pop lock it and then drop it off her nose
You mad cause I'm styling on ya
Your bitch calling me your honor, swing that gavel on her
Pussy

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
Leaning all day, trapping all night
You look like a lick if I ain't liking that price
Youngin's won't fold, hit you for a strike
Everything's a go, bitch we chopping on sight
Chopping on site (x6)
Hit 'em with with the drum we ain't coming back twice
Lay his pussy ass down, boy we chopping on sight
