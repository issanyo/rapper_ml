[Verse 1]
These the darkest nights your boy done ever seen
A hunnid days, a hunnid nights, it's like a murder scene
You know we seen but ain't heard a thing
We just keep the choppers on the dresser
Kitchen looking like the Medell√≠n
Boy, who you think you playin' with?
The ones that running with you
Them the ones you end up layin' with
Six feet under shit's creek, dead sheep
You can hear them angels crying when the dead speak
They tell you everything you wanna hear, ok
Bare face, so I know you know you saw me clear
Thought I told you love was murder so you know it's real
You always get the coldest feet before you close the deal
Ain't no need to panic, I don't feel no pressure
All my niggas pedal through the traffic, really with the extras
Catch a hole or catch a holy ghost, say a prayer
We don't do the most, bed of black roses for your funeral

[Chorus]
Dirty money, run it in the sink
This the coldest night in Hell you ever seen
Dirty money, run it in the sink
This the coldest night in Hell you ever seen
Dirty money, run it in the sink
This the coldest night in Hell you ever seen
Dirty money, run it in the sink
This the coldest night in Hell you ever seen

[Verse 2]
Been a long time coming, baby, hold your tongue
Ain't no need for no opinions when you plottin' on the millions
You been talking brazy, nigga, show me somethin'
But you more concerned with livin', you been soft from the beginnin'
I could see it in your eyes, tell me what I gotta know
Spare me all the lies, put your body on the flo'
The code of honor wasn't suited for ya
Buzzing through your Under Armour
Put six feet under, oughtta do it for ya
Snitches get the stitches, boy, you know the layout
Once you pulled up on the turf, you know the only way out
You know it's death before dishonor, bullets from Nirvana
And we never put the pussy up before the commas
Boy, you really gotta see the vision
You really almost gotta lose it all before you see what's missin'
And I'm just here to set the record straight
We sitting rats inside the barrel with snakes
Bullets through the heads and face
Hallelujah, drop my soul in that collection plate
Heaven gates, they already late
I picked the spot and you could set the date
I think I'm ready to die
I'll fuck around and you'll get buried alive, bitch

[Chorus]
Dirty money, run it in the sink
This the coldest night in Hell you ever seen
Dirty money, run it in the sink
This the coldest night in Hell you ever seen
Dirty money, run it in the sink
This the coldest night in Hell you ever seen
Dirty money, run it in the sink
This the coldest night in Hell you ever seen
