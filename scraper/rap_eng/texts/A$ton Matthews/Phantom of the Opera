[Chorus x2]
Liver of the chop, to living el chapo
Pullin up in, the Phantom of the Opera
White on white, coca cocaine
All up in su casa, the Phantom of the Opera

[1st Verse]
Boy where you been? Who you been around?
Yeah - cause all that talkin' nigga get around
Yeah - talkin' tough until I turn em down
Chin checking eyes across the floor when you see me now
What's the difference between me and you?
Well - got the killers, got the bitches too
Well - it's some niggas that's some bitches too
Well - got they bitches fuckin' bitches too
Well - Yeah - I guess I'm pimpin' on the low huh
If she bend it over better get it off the floor huh
I make her split it wit my woes huh
Stickin' to the code huh, this is how it goes down
Now my name rang through the door
Gangbang, chain hang, dope slang get it low
Kick in the door or we jumpin' through the window like a car crash Boys turnin' pussy like a Kardash-
Okay, okay, puro kilos from my oye
Cocaine for the cold face, no problem, no mercy, just a closed case
Flawless - 3rd eye seeing all this
Pistols poppin' bodies droppin' early August
Lord forgive me for my sins
You shed blood on the cross to cover all this

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge - "OKAY! You wanna play rough? Fuckin' cockroaches"]

[2nd Verse]
Face on top of faces, bitches back to back
Commas after commas, zeros after that
Money and the power, pussy and respect
Dancing wit the devil, flirting with the tech
Look me in my eyes tell me what you see
God I call upon pray he level me
Lost up in my mind someone let me free
Finger on the trigger should I let em breathe?
Should I let em breathe?
Ws wit a big ol' letter P
What I'm yellin' before I do my shit
Bag it, sell it, then I move that shit
You lookin' at a product of the G code
Caprice's and them Regal's with them kilos
Catch you slippin' man we need those
Mando end up on a white tee or candle
We let em go according to how the cash flow
Gotta make it through them corners before you pass go
All summer, all winter do it right
Seen them fiends catch the fever in the night till they had to hit the needle wit the light
Then it's off to neverland
Power with the powder, sniff it off your skin
Lost up in the lust seduced up in your sin
Taking one of mine, I gotta send em ten
The cycle never end
Comin for my soul fuck it let 'em in
The cycle never end
They comin' for my soul fuck it let 'em in
FLAIR!
