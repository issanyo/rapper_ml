Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
We got them bricks, bitch, work that strip
If your nigga gon' trip then we let 'em spray
Where do I go? Where do I go?
Where do I go? Where do I go?

Ten toes in the ground, we don't wait around
Fatts got him off the hound, get him outta town
When I take them out they don't make a sound(?)
Cause they know if we don't like the price you take 'em down
That's cold game, nah that's young killer Cold Chain
No witness, that's no names, colder than this four ranks(?)
Lookin' like Popovich, she popped the pussy before I popped the Cris
Walk on water when I'm off this shit
I got an ice pack that should've bought the wrist
Brick Flaire, Flex PAC, Trish Stratus with the chest shots
Low pops in the headlock, the pebbles make your bed rock (?)
That Five.Six.Deuce, said he where the skinny niggas ride
Semi for your pride, Thug Life (?)
Got that chicken noodle soup with the Henney on the side, pussies
