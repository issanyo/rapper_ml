[Verse 1]
These bitches sayin’ pussy is power
These cowards just as pussy as Prada
They done smack down drape a fuckin’ pussy in powder
Teach you cowards how to make that fuckin’ pussy bring power [ahh]
I got it all, you ain’t got enough
In the fingertips of lust is a loaded pump
No soul to trust this coated clutch will fold you up
It’s only us, it ain’t the first time I ever had to load the trunk
Eyes stained with the souls of fallen
Sun’s fallen, Hell’s closer than my undergarments
Persian silk, no chaser like my Henny sharper
From the land where men talk but not many conquer
Bathin’ in the waters of Minnetonka
Finnessin’, little weapon my clip’s extended
Smith and Wesson to get the stretchin’
Get second guessin’ in the seventh then and leave your section, pussy

[Hook x 2]
Eyes wide while I roam the streets
Through the valley of death dog I hold the heat
Momma said say my prayers ‘fore I go to sleep
So if I never wake I pray the lord my soul to keep

[Verse 2]
I’m on this curb searchin’ for a purpose
Turnt and worthless, where the fuck the church is
Do or die for where my fuckin’ turf is
Put in the worst of workin’
And I’mma burn in hell if all my bodys search to surface
Lucifer’s loose, seducin’ his noose
Numb the pain, dry my tears in my aim, move and I shoot
Move for my troops, hold your noodle as proof
Each stripe is a steppin’ stone to get the throne, rep in time, the Tec is drawn
Turn the page, homicide for the hunger games
Life kills but the murder pays
Drill for the bills, get sealed for the pills
Welcome to the field where your killers get killed, pussy
I ain’t my brother’s keeper I’m my brother’s reaper
Wash his blood in my hands as I dug him deeper
In this parking lot, conscious thoughts
Got my carbon cocked, will I make it through the dark or not [Aah?]

[Hook x 2]
