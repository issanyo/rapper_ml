[Verse 1]
Make yo bitch drown, break a brick down
30 pop a Juntao, turn yo whip round
Benji on the fall in, let the shit pile
Sleezy on the call in, tryin' get wild
Had lil baby in the VIP yeah, off the rip yeah
Bust it down into a split yeah, on the dick yeah
Couple thou-wow on the fit, another kicks yeah
Spent yo rent on what I sip, I know I got 'em sick yeah
But that ain’t really shit yeah
Im'a walkin lick cause young nigga talkin' brick fair
Know I had to make the shit clear
Money counter choppin' like a windmill
Please tell me what’s the issue
Commas on yo head I bet them niggas gon' forget you
Fourth and goal we gotta blitz you
Shooters goin' dummy if I ever blow the whistle
Bruce Wayne in the Hussein
Keep the beef brackin' from the color of my shoe strings
Something stocky for the mood swing
I be Prada stepping wit the loose change
Somethin' foreign where I lay
Somethin' foreign on the plate
We be scoring by the 8
We be pouring by the 8
Niggas dishin' out the weight
You can get it by the whole half, quarter, or the eighth
Ain’t afraid to do the leg work
Boy I always put the bread first
Know these diamonds make a bitch flirt
See the envy know the shit hurt
I seen Yamborghini die up in his sleep - aye
Type shit that haunt me underneath - aye
Paranoia got me clutchin' on the heat - aye
All these dead faces I can hear em when they speak - aye

[Chorus]
Finger on the trigger while I’m counting up the dead
Slippin' in the trenches put them halos on ya head
Pistol on the counter nigga pistol to yo head
Ran all out of wocky so we sippin' on the red
