[Verse 1]
Fingernails dirty, I've been grinding since 4:30
Magic on the block, won't pass a rock if you're not worthy
The bigs that used to curve me on my dick now
The niggas that wanted me dead wanna be friends now
But I don't need no fuck nigga or bitch, I'm threw with this shit
My ties that give niggas these clips, my whole dick don't give a dick
Unless that ass fat enough for her to smuggle a brick
Now I have a bitch a whole 36, I think I'm going crazy
A nigga been on some fucking rogue shit lately
These niggas got nowhere, sipping with me 380
Got if from the boys hide the work in the pampers of the baby
These niggas step back so I'm out of reach
Got in my suit and tie now, their dough is not seen
They say death is at the tongue before my name, my nigga
And you'll be down fuck nigga, I'm not the one


[Hook]
Fuck niggas, no, I don't fuck with niggas
Trust these niggas, no, I don't trust these niggas
Love these hoes, no, I don't love these hoes
Ride them foes, better get to the dough, stick to the code
Fuck niggas, no, I don't fuck with niggas
Trust these niggas, no, I don't trust these niggas
Love these hoes, no, I don't love these hoes
Ride them foes, better get to the dough, stick to the code


[Verse 2]
About to turn up, John Tuck, crane oughta come up
Before I get my wing clubbed
And before the pigs try to get my wrist cuffed
Gotta get it, never had it, brought it up and I let 'em have it
They talk, they chit chatter, drum roll please, yeah, I'm brick '
Riding around town with your bitch on me
She never wanna look for me, tattered bitch, get on knees
You know she put her lips on me
Loving these hoes, I'm gonna toss in the dough, if she drop it, I fall
And pick it up slowly, want your tips, gotta show me
Standard tits on the folly, don't you act like you know me
Spilled the Chris on my Roley, fuck a bitch, fuck her homie
There's not enough tattered and phony
Got the bricks out the U hall, I got that red nose, that Rudolph
Take a sniff, boy, you fruit ball, pussy
Word around town is they ride it right
But we the homies wanna count commas, dropping by


[Hook]
