[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
Weed by the pound, lean in my cup
All these bitches coming 'round and they leaving here with us
The homie's got the four pound if you tryna press your luck
Get it wrong, yeah you niggas know what's up
Bitch we 'bout to turn up
Uh, yeah, uh, turn up
Uh, yeah, uh, turn up

[Verse 1: DA$H]
Dropping dope just like a dread head
Tatted like a cholo, Actavis in my solo cup
Drinking like a pound of [?], yup
Looking for a hoe to fuck and suck
Hella blunt, like the shit I'm smoking
[?] motion, dead the bottle soon as that motherfucker open
Yeah so, as I parlay through the beach
If it's beef, call my niggas from the Naughtys , tires screech
Hammers busting, no discussion
Leave him red like he was blushing, damn
Son of Sam, run the game like I was Vince McMahon
Going ham, yup, high as Mars
Plan of ours, drop some bars, buy some cars
All my niggas ball, Abdul-Jabbar
Killing shit nigga, Freddy, Jason, mixed with Chucky
If the bitch fuck me she lucky, only worried 'bout my bucks be

[Verse 2: Joey Fatts]
Posted with my niggas and we chilling
Two twin Glocks, Warren Sapp in the building
Turning up the spot and we dope dealing
White bitches give me top, I supply the coke they sniffing
And she fucking with them G's, fucking with them key's
Keys open doors, after I fuck she gotta leave
Posted with the team, forty with a beam
Niggas on my tip, make them young dro show the lean
Uh, in the trap I grand hustle
Birds in the stove, bands in the duffle
Money equals power, power equals muscle
Give his ass a lead shower, turn his picture to a puzzle
Motherfucking Fatts
