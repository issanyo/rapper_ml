[Hook x2]
Riding round my city, purple with the henny
Moving with the semi, ain't no snitches moving with me
Every smile ain't a friend, keep a tool for the snakes
Set you up for 10 or they'll shoot you in the face

Hell yeah hells near hell yeah
Hell in a cell, tripping cause it's hell here
Hells near don't be looking for help here
My 45 could change the meaning of health care

[Verse 1: A$ton Matthews]
Chopper showers extended clips and slow creeping
When it rains it pours, the snub nose leaking
Hells here lord jesus souls leaving
And my 4's changin with the 4 seasons
Once 2 niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
Now I heard you dry snitching thru the grapevine
Tryna stick me up for 50 on the main line
Damn, my nigga
Bullets off in my chest, it was you pulling that trigger
Switching sides on niggas just like that
This 45's homicide, tell Satan be right back

[Hook x2]
Riding round my city, purple with the henny
Moving with the semi, ain't no snitches moving with me
Every smile ain't a friend, keep a tool for the snakes
Set you up for 10 or they'll shoot you in the face

Hell yeah hells near hell yeah
Hell in a cell, tripping cause it's hell here
Hells near don't be looking for help here
My 45 could change the meaning of health care

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
Who knew this little light of mine could turn into some violent crimes
Clocking in from 9-9, did a 9-5 and pushed the work in my idle time
Thats what happens when you lost and confused in a world full of temptation
Right or wrong your head is my next payment
The rents waiting, switching sides brings shell casings
And you was like my older brother
When the pigs came who knew you'd be folding under
Should've taken that stand
Now your life on the line, your blood on my hand
Told me if you snitch on the grind you drop where you stand
So drop where you stand
Hail mary, Hells nearing
This 45 make this pussy soul parish

Hell in a cell, tripping cause it's hell here
Hells near don't be looking for help here
