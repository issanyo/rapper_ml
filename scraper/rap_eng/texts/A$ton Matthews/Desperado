Smoke it, Hit it, Light it, Heat it, Cook it, (Hell Yeah)
Smoke it, Hit it, Light it, Heat it, Cook it, (Hell Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Chapovelli in that taco truck, Three whellin' and ashin' blunts
It's bitches poppin pussy, pass that paper to me that's a must
Cross them lines them hammers bust
Slangin, bangin, ain't too many niggas that can hang with us, we dangerous
Young Looney in the house now
Young Hootie in the drop now
Blowfish hold clips while the stove twitch
Your bitch, both lips on the whole clique
Momma I'm thuggin in London -
We came from over that border
I brought the wave to the water
It's slaughter when paper get brought up
That's just the way we was brought up
We was just young livin' savage ain't no way around it, (ugh)
My killas spot em, got em, drop em, not a problem, make a shirt up out em, (ugh)
What you niggas claim?, Where you earn your name?, Who put you on the gang, (ugh)
Pussy - who your big homie?
Before you checkin' in, check your resume, a threat you never been
You was tuckin' tails when we gettin in, I'm on that shit again, (ugh)

[Bridge]
Ay Yay Yayo (Can I Get A Hell Yeah)
Ay Yay Yayo (Can I Get A Hell Yeah)
Ay Yay Yayo (Can I Get A Hell Yeah)
CHI-CHI Get The Yayo!
