[Verse 1: Da$H]
American Psycho, two black hoes
Them bitches is dikes though
Say they like white though
Roll me a blunt and I beat it like Michael
The baddest nigga, yup
Samoan bitch, Hawaiian skunk
She suck my dick, I light my blunt
Swear this ain't the life for chumps
I worked for this, did dirt for this
Niggas caught time, and they served the shit
Couple a funeral services
Dare a nigga say I don't deserve this, bitch
Hit a acid on a tongue, nigga rachet
Put the pussy in a casket
Weed habit like a addict
Seeing money off this rap shit
Got me spitting like a 'matic
Click clack, bang, bang
H'z motherfucker, niggas know what I claim
Since a teenager twist my fingers up the same
Wake up, smoke a pound, then I'm pissing champagne
Broke niggas, get your bread up
And all you pussy ass niggas, don't get yo' fucking head bust
Enough drugs to be dead son
Screaming "free my fucking niggas" 'til the feds come

[Vers 2: RetcH]
Met a bad bitch off Instagram
She said she heard my song, became a insta fan
And she be popping Xans, and we be smoking grams
And she be snorting grams, then I remove her pants
And then I stick it in and act a hooligan
Then I bust a nut, where my loosies man
Then I tell that bitch that I need a Maserati
Gas her up like she gon' be riding shotty
In my tiny jeans I like to party party
Standing on the couch, it's getting rowdy rowdy
Three bitches for me, you know I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Another VIP, it's getting cloudy cloudy
Last year I grew up, and you wouldn't believe it
Now my bitches are real, and she screaming Jesus
So she sipping [?] eating reeses pieces
Shorty rub my back while she feed me peaches
Black nigga, fresh up out ocean
Ashy skin, man I need some lotion
I be getting high, yeah I'm smoking potent
And my bitch be popping, yeah that bitch be rolling
[?] in my system, tell that bitch I bleed cognac
And I smoke weed like I throw that
And I got the 'Lo shorts matching with the 'Lo hat
I be hitting licks in my Polo, call me Lojack

[Verse 3: A$ton Matthews]
Don't think I won't hit you cause I'm popular
Twin Glocks in this ride, put ya spots on the block for ya
Sixteen clean the bodies up
Shock tops rock [?] clip show that Cutthroat mafia
Gaining ends while I'm losing sleep
Making money moves, Fatts brought it through a jeep
Doing life ya favorite mood to see
This the life I chose, road to imported gold, Cuban Links
Versace shades in a room full of two or three
And they all in the mood for me, who is he
A$ton, Montana [?] answer to your question is a [?]
Camouflage shoot it up, shoot a duck
You lose your life before I lose a buck, fuck
