[Verse 1: A$ton Matthews]
Leaves sounding like footsteps, paranoid got me thinking bout who’s next
If it ain’t you, it’s me, my momma not old enough to read in my eulogy
Keep that hammer tucked close to me, put the pussy where it’s supposed to be
Thank the lord for I got ten toes on the ground and my back to the block
Westside boss let it rock, leave a slug up in the opp
We leaving until we see the body drop
Good heart but its all full of sins
Through the dark, where this road gonna end
Choppas fly for the liquor again, play victim or get with the shit
Know the price that I’m paying, for the red chucks on this blue pavement
Doot doot over loose statement, three fingers down index pink rounded
The enemy he drowning, if you ain't with it move around then
More choppas, move thousands
Gotcha bitch moving bricks, bring one, two, few pounds in
And if you get flicked, you don’t know where you found it
Fucking caught me cause she called for me
Me and my momma living comfortably
(What’s the word?)
It’s like life for a nigga in the streets is a forty on the hip
Blood up on my feet, back up on the heat
Keep your head up on a swivel
Or lose em to the beef, gotta watch em
Cause they moving on the sneak
Always do your dirt up on G
Cause niggas plotting and they talking for a fee
D force to the 218, they talk beef but the clip 16

[Hook:A$ton Matthews]
Where we ride, it’s homicide, choose a side
On the rise, we made it fly, we getting high
Getting live getting live, we breaking news
Or make em move, we bring it through, nigga who is you?

[Verse 2: Joey Fatts]
I’m lil fatts from the double N to the GC
I keep a thang on tuck, my lil bro thump
Nigga press ya luck if you see me
These niggas in the house trying to CC the streets
While a nigga really out here
So I never do a feature not even for a fee
Cause I ain’t got bitch nigga software
Nigga its Cuttthroat murder gang
And we the one to blame for the murder rate
Hollows cook the beef to the third degree
You eat good? nigga tell me how that burger taste
There posted in the cut like surgery
Really plotting on a motherfucking burglary
And if I catch a nigga slipping with a rim or chain
I need that my nigga, on me
Like a ?, keep a forty on me
And a nigga stay hot trying to stay low key
Dumping heat, hit your block wearing  ? face mask
If you fuck with g, and I’m a ride for my gang
Play the fifth do time for my gang
On the set an getting live with my gang
With a nine waiting for an ? on the gang
And if a fuck nigga try he getting flamed on

[Hook:A$ton Matthews]
Where we ride, it’s homicide, choose a side
On the rise, we made it fly, we getting high
Getting live getting live, we breaking news
Or make em move, we bring it through, nigga who is you?
