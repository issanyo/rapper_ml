*glass shatters*

Hahahaha (yeah)
Can I get a hell yeah? (brick)
Can I get a hell yeah? (flair)

For god so loved the world
He sent his only begotten son to guide the way
And I am the way
That’s soon to be ?
Y’all welcome

Backpack with a deuce-deuce
Duck duck a goose goose, get a zoot suit
Day or not it’s a lose-lose when my troops shoot
Shoot through, magazines brought the news crew
Era of the sidekick snitching
Work in the sock, nigga skipped those classes
Blick on the hip, if you slip, we blasting
Look both ways cuz them fingers spell action
Come from where they hit-and-run
No matter who you hit just as long as you get it done
Get backs, never one on one
They’ll hit you where it hurts if you fucking run
No lacking they clapping
No questions just action
Get hit `fore you know what happened
So tragic
Y’all some dead motherfuckers
I can tell if the squad late
Young Brick Flair, used to have the product in the hallway
Eight shots, homie, broad day
Had them white hoes, nose trapping off of Broadway
Nigga I said that before
Run up in your shit like I been there before
Gimme what you got, gimme what you got
Get it under pressure when it’s hot
Product of the block, show you what you not
Woo!
You call it beef and I call it war
One of mine, that’s ten of yours
Lost in the paranoia
Niggas take a life just to settle score
Shoot first cuz you never know
When the lord gon be sending for ya
Paranoia got me ready for it
Forgive me lord if I send em for ya
Living for the days where I ain’t have it
Mama working overtime just to manage
When the pastor was passing on a passage
I was working overtime, passing off a package
Let my chain swang to my dick
Tre 5-7 aim for the fence
Black gloves they ain’t got a finger to print
Masked up like a St. Lunatic waiting to trip

Oh lord, all my young killas go hard
Oh god, chopper left him no jaws

Let us pray, and they plotting on my name
But they ain’t eating’ off my plate
God calling’, let him wait
Let us pray, let us pray
God calling’, let him wait
If he tripping’ let it spray
Got a body on the way
Now let us pray
