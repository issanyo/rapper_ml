Hoes, I got hella hoes

I got a start in these streets, extra hard for these hoes
We move hard in these streets, young God, X'in' them O's
I'm like God in these streets, got a tech in my coat
I go hard in these streets, Johnny Depp with the blow
I flip nickels and O's, I flip powder in bass
I done shoveled the snow, I done showered the state
See them flowers gone grow and the power gon' raise
And we came through the door, here we got us a race

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
All these diamonds in my teeth
I'm gone off a gallon of Hennessy
Better let your bitch go cause she's feelin' me
And besides she a ho, she fucked him and me
And I gave her the beast like I'm Timothy
Moonwalk in that pussy like Billie Jean
And I open your chest like you Janet Jackson
And I blam-blam like you Timberlake
I put him in a lake and I penetrate
Let it sit in your face like a dinner date
Then bust open your grill, let it ventilate
And my niggas is killers, what can I say?
With a crew of gorillas like 50 Cent
And they peelin' bananas, no dinner plate
And I'm only gone ride with my syndicate
A$AP 'til I die, nigga, period

[Hook: A$AP Nast]

Uh, really with the shit, if a nigga trip, loadin' up the clip
Never slip, tight, never sleep, finna let it rip in this bitch like
Pistols poppin', pussies droppin'

Alright, I got hella hoes

[Verse 4: A$ton Matthews]
In the function you a soldier
Got that clap clap like the 'Nolia
When them 'cets fly off the corner
Lil' homie out the window, you's a goner
When I blow, the gangstas get at me
West side bussin' if they come at me
Takin' all things and givin' no presents
Fuck rappin', word up and you see how shit happens
Drop a deuce, watch you lean low
Got some cholos with the beams on
Got some crip niggas, need this thing gone
But I woo mine, but I knew that
I'm Shawn Michaels with the weapon drawn
Steady swing 'til your neck is gone
Watch your mouth and the toes that you're steppin' on
This young brick flip Chapo
Rarin', cutthroat gang, them choppers flarin', nigga

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Scary, nigga, bury Swisher
Cause I'm just like fairy sister

It's the Mr. Black, I'll hit you niggas, bury niggas
You ain't fuckin' with me like Mary, nigga
Your uncle, cousin, brother, best friend carry you, nigga
Since I'm like Uncle Phil in the pool hall
Eight ball in a tube sock, new yacht
Think I had the Glock, got me like a screw shawk
Saw me shut it down if they think we too soft

Playin' with afford that grow in my car
Ball like whippin' up work on the south
Speakin' of Os, know my nigga got hoes
