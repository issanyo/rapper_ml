[Hook x4]
It's murder when the block get hot, the block get hot

[Verse]
Forrest Gump with the rugers, I ran with the shooters
Chopping brick tags, never missed math, grams is my tutors
Cooking up with Anne Frank
Your bitch say my dick good and my tan great
Trigga finger, cash play, shooters for the jab play
Jake the Snake DDT, lugers, that's a back break
I pull your card, take a chance with the iron
That's how you get two hundred to fast way
Everything's a go, bullets rain threw your dome [?]
Old souls, show me where the cash at
I duck tape your kids and I show 'em how to bag that
Afghan, Taliban Van Dam
Fatts got the chopper with the two-can hand stand
Leave your head where your hand stand
One shot sending four niggas home
That's a home invasion grand slam
