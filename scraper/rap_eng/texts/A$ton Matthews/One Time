[Intro - Excerpt from film 'Menace II Society]
Aye, you know what, nigga? You acting like a little bitch right now. You acting real paranoid and shit. Now, these motherfuckers smoked your goddam cousin in front of you nigga! Blew his head off in front of your face, and you ain't gonna do shit? You acting like a little bitch right now, nigga. Man, fuck that. I ain't letting that shit ride

[Chorus]
One time, one time, its one time, fuck the one time
(What What)
One time, one time, its one time, fuck the one time
(What What)
Now can get a hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Now can get a hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 1]
Burnt fiens on the curb of 223rd street
Me and my cousin under thirteen
Hawaiian Gardens, yellow tape around the first scene
That I caught, fallen angels under nights watch
My eyes locked on a blood stained sidewalk
We fight for it, we die for it, the circle of life, my nerves sit on ice
The block hot and I done watched the birds circle it twice
I'm searchin for Christ, he ain't answerin
A.I. arm sleeves, where the answers is, family dinners meet candles lit
I can still hear his momma screamin
Daughter too young to know that her father leavin
And never comin back, we the product, we come from that
And they wonder why we bustin back
Black or Brown, Blues hate We
But niggas get shot everyday b

[Chorus]
One time, one time, its one time, fuck the one time
(What What)
One time, one time, its one time, fuck the one time
(What What)
Now can get a hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Now can get a hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2]
Summer '08, niggas snitchin and Ralph gone
The beef jumpin I'm knee deep in this hell zone
Well known, the fiens leap for my phone
Shootin jumpers off the 860
Camry bucket with the paint chippy
Flame dripping, say you bangin, you lames mystery
Them Looney Gangstas leave your names history
Thats how I'm giving it up, Its one in the head, with 8 in the cut
Three fingers down, middle fingers is up
To the enimigos, co-signs we ain't never need those
Fair fades it was rare to see those
Thats why we shooting first and asking last
Them blickers hit the stash when them badges pass
Cause it's do or die in the summer time
It's get back the same night if it's one of mine
Seasons change the cycle stays, its night and day
Momma hate the way I'm living, God can't make a brighter way
Cause them shots will leave you like a tidal wave
And if its gang related you don't even see the time or day
Cause it's the life we chose, rockin since a snotty nose
Mommy knows, I was catching bodies out them sliding doors
Took mine and young and brazy what it made me
But niggas get shot everyday b

[Chorus]
One time, one time, its one time, fuck the one time
(What What)
One time, one time, its one time, fuck the one time
(What What)
Now can get a hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Now can get a hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
