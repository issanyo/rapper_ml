[Verse 1]
Good heart, but my grind crooked
Killing niggas while my mom looking
Plain sight, but she never seen
She prolly praying that that good kid never leave
Or come back, baby Jordans and a sun hat
Now she worried 'bout where her son at
When the sun gone, and the night came
That's when them triggers pulled, then my life changed
Highschool, I never fit it
Always dolo in the cut, tryna catch you slipping
Quiet motherfucker, always icey though
All them pussys talked, they ain't ever try me though
Deep down, they knew better
And if you had the right price then I knew wether
Or a weatherman, killing you with separate hands
One got you praying that that Tec'd jam
The other got you twitching [?]

[Hook]
Cold blooded murders, right under my mama nose
First and only son, to her I'm just a pot of gold
To the streets I'm just another number
Lock and load, earning stripes, I'm rocking soles
Chopping work up in the [?]
Pray to God that I make it to my days end
They say you gotta live before you die
But we living to die, it's time to ride

[Verse 2]
To my lost ones, that I never seen
Just know I love you more than any word could ever mean
Wish that I could see your face again, older
Just hope you got your angel wings up on my shoulders
Know that mama loved you too
But at the time it wasn't cool, I'm a my noggin with this tool
Drowning in this Hennesy, [?] hope do you remember me
Ask God, why you have to go like that
The family broke apart, and [?] hit home like that
Never knew that darkness ever glow like that
45 with the stainless gloves, safety off, saying run
Catch a ride, homicide show me that pain is love
So love is murder
Say goodnight and french kiss the burner
I love you

[Hook]
Cold blooded murders, right under my mama nose
First and only son, to her I'm just a pot of gold
To the streets I'm just another number
Lock and load, earning stripes, I'm rocking soles
Chopping work up in the [?]
Pray to God that I make it to my days end
They say you gotta live before you die
But we living to die, it's time to ride
