[Singing]

[Verse 1]
She call me daddy...when my tongue touch her slow (whoahhh)
I touch her soul, she testify, and undress the fold
Pop the ceiling, and watch the ceiling fold
Gust the floor
Make her bust it til her knees touch the floor
Slip those pannies off sweetheart
Stayed around through the ups and downs of your seesaw
Take you higher then you ever been
Sink or swim, breast stroking through your csn
You the devil in disguise
Who would of though I'd find heaven in your thighs
Taking night shots of your body
Dancing with wolves, ass back while your tracks getting pulled (hann...)
Low jack, where the dome at?
Wet pussy and a broke back
Show me were your throat at
Show me were your nose at
Shut up bitch, blow that
Sipping, drop a four back (huhh)

[Hook]
(Brick) What's my motherfucking name (~echo~ Flair...)
What's my motherfucking name (Brick...Flair)
What's my motherfucking name (Brick.......Flair)
What's my motherfucking name



[Verse 2]
Been two days, since Tuesday
Say you from them dark nights, like Bruce Wayne
When the blues came, made you feel like new suede
Fulfill your rush, you love the lust
You hypnotize with every touch
Now shut the door
Close the blinds
Let me inside
I'll blow your mind

A nose with your name on it
You love me girl, now say it to me
When your mom turns her back
Who came running?
It's love but this love cost
So take from your friends till they fucked off
Play your role and i'll take your soul
Now take a seat
I'll take control
Play your role and i'll take your soul
Ill strap you tight, (?)

~You the only one I lean on
You the only one I lean on
You the only one I lean on
You the only one I breath on
You the only one I lean on
You the only one I lean on
You the only one I lean on
You the only one I breath on
Now you know you the only one I lean on~
