Far away for the waves bruh

Sweet chin music to your fucking mother

Give us a path my nigga, high time niggas is drowning Cowabunga

Like

[Verse 1: RetcH]
Tryna live righteous but this devil got ahold of me
Standing in the rain with a K, high off more than v
Looking for my enemies or just a pussy nigga slick
Fuck the system, rather take my fucking wrist and fucking slit 'em
Bible in my back pocket, think I got a condom too
Some chapstick and a recept for this motherfucking chinese food
Outchea tryna hit  a lick cause a nigga need one
Got thirty seven dollars cash and motherfucking weed crumbs
My bitches on some next shit, them hoes don't even love a nigga
Got the bitch tatted then she ran off with some other nigga
Fuck it though can't even trip, cause I'm such a piece of shit
Ask me what I did and I'ma tell you that I plead the fifth
Word to my nigga Dave, trapping to the fucking grave
I just met a nigga that said he could get me hand grenades
Finna cop a couple and go biking through the neighborhood
Headed to the local park, just wising that a nigga would

[Hook: RetcH]
Let's go have it and cop a G
That's 500 grams for you, that's five 500 grams for me
35 a pop, talk 'em down to three
That's 30 racks off of crack, you'd be stupid not to agree
Plastic baggies, we burn the tip
I'm in the trap with a itch, my fingers sting like a bitch
Going hard to death for the camp
Forever ride to the end, if you my mans you my mans

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
Versace frame in my Petey Pablo, just copped the swanging
You know the stainless, you know the name is Brick Flair
Brick Flair, all they talk about is Brick Flair
Bet his pussy brown if my dick there
Winter, fall, it's a cold case, snow nose means no play
Cause when your knows knows I get more pay
I'm the xannie doctor, nose for a pantie dropper
You know the price, my mafiaso got hands in lobster
Son of Sam, bitch I'm Holyfield holding grams
Moses [?], brought the wave to the holy lands
I sway, I surf, I bag, I serve, my packs bring herds
My pinky ring bring birds, my main break chauffeurs
I let the homies fuck but I'm smashing her first
Pop the pussy while I pop the deuce
And fuck a cop until he cop a few, Montana

[Hook]

[Verse 3: RetcH & A$ton Matthews]
Wake up, smell the gun smoke, Hz Global, Cutthroat
Slung dope, smoke dope, faded off that love boat
Some niggas owed dough, I been calling out your matador
We at his crib, we snatch up his moms and call it collateral

Crash the Panamera, [?], shattered jaws
They don't even scratch it off, riding out, hammers drawn Versace print tiger paws with a pocket full of Hannah Montana
That I hustled off a Hasselhoff, pass it off

That Asher Roth, I bag it raw and get it off
Niggas that be cheffing, they hit my line when they needed soft

They see the jaws, my pinky bright, my feet is course
Teriyaki paint but you don't see the source, peep the horse

With my Asian bitch, (Tatted up)
Spanish hoe, (Saddle up)
(White boys say they love my shit), Bro your rad as fuck
Dapper fan, ([?])
RetcHy Porter, (Minivan)
Banging 'til the feds knock, (Bitch I think I'm X-Pac)

[Hook]
