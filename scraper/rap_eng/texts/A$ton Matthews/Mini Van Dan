[Verse]
Riding with them Damus that's known to let them hammers pop
Hoes with the powder tops, imported straight from Camelot
Choppers on the countertop, bible in the kitchen drawer
Pray to God these fifty shots hit you 'fore you hit the floor
My brains a medicine cabinet, overdosed on ritalin tablets
Dropped acid in red cross charity baskets
SK to these hipster ass rap faggots, they vag-tastic
Mossberg Moss, fully loaded with his shirt off
Mini Van Dan, knock the pussy out his skirt off
Then I skert off, beeper with the chirp off
Stoop kid's afraid to leave the stoop
But you can bet he get them birds off
Trade the volkeswag' for the [?] drug
[?] to feet up and the re-up
Goldust, gold on top of my arm, sipping on Don
Got your moms tits tipping on the tip of my jawn
Playing volleyball when that molly call
Spiking the white, sip, sip, sipping on fours
Knitching the Sprite sitting on ice
Go-go-gadget dick, don't get stuck in the dykes
Cut off her head and [?] in her twice

[Hook x2]
Buy and selling bitches on Ebay
All my bodies underneath the 91 freeway
Catch me in the overpass, mankind mask
Title belt in the brief case
