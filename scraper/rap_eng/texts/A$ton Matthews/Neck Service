It that's trill shit.. Ho.. Family business.. Trilluminati

Call her Quagmire that neck jerking hold that breath till that head hurting
Wave gang I'm swag surfing swallow me whole that's swag slurping

Riding around to that  ?
Yo ho riding that ?
Bitch!
Give that neck service that neck service

(Verse 1)
Well what do you know I'm up in your ho
You lockin her down, I give it and go
Smokin the passion, tipping it slow
If that pro chose she gotta go...whoa
Bring that paper back
Once you hit you gotta pay for that
You gon pay for that cause the hoe stay strapped
Letta hoe take that
Woooooooo boi
I used to be a young drug dealer
Now im a young girl stealer
Got two hoes in that armadillo
Thats a hard top
Thats amber cole when she walk by
Her mouth drop, that ass sittin
Amber rose that back lifted
Half clip full,  eight shots call that a quicky
Stick yo neck with them hickys
Flatline leave no trace or no history
Pop a pill and push that oj back
With a cocaine sack bitch im cobain strapped
