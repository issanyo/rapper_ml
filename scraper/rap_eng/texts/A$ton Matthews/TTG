[Verse 1: A$ton Matthews]
Ladies and gentlemen dirty sprite with the Ritalin
Got that grape right in the late night with Lettermans
Slipe n slide let the devil in suicide settle in
Choose a side that's semi or sunny side seven him
Let him fly get to peddling
The world is mine while i'm John Nash on the pelican
Young brick flair maricon, heavy weight champion
I got yo mommy with her panties on
Send ya daddy home bare nuts in ya honey comb
Lil bitch just run along
Big bag get ya bool out with ya tools out make ya move out
Pull up pull out put the sharks to ya pool house
Catch a few hoes when pull through with the pool who's
Cut throat cut throat
All my niggas straight cut throat, i got the plug that don't cut coke
Got ya nose full with the love soap
Fuck the feds my nigga, that's what the fuck i brought guns for
I fucked ya bitch my nigga
She got hard dick at the front door
In the trenches with the ratchets
Ratchets got em' doing backwards
Young done niggas straight savage
Got them loaded gangtas staight active
T stone, p rail, Wicked 'ru, let the beef brack
That's head shots put ya seat back young mac 11 with the heat packed my nigga!

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'm so H with 3 eyes, the homie got a 30 O six
Meaning I could point my index and still won't leave no finger prints
I'm with the shit look who i'm with
Bounty hunters and hoover crips
Ironically fathered by the bastards
Politics with piru's and shit
Que paso to my vatos
No nickname just a AK
Aye man best make way know mother fuckers die everyday
Young niggas with military guns
My system filled with all these mother fucking drugs
White girl on my nose, white girl taking off her clothes
And she even bought a bra, that's a druggy's with hoes tre
She ain't really into rapping, she just really love the flow
So every time we do the nasty
We just do it on the floor
Never been to prison but i stay with bars son
And yeah I'm sippin' lean I ain't at the bar son
Welcome to Carson, lookout let me spell it out, you could see ARs son
