[Intro]
Wait Wait Hold Up (Gimme all that)
Wait Wait Hold Up (I need all that)

[Verse 1]
I put moncler up on my body, know the price on the coat
I got some niggas using benzocaine to stretch out the coke
My name ring bells from Westside Barson, Northside of the Beach
Them bullets aiming at your noggin with the sand at your feet
Boy don't be stupid, don't be foolish, drop a pin and we at you
Bend yo block through all them bandos, bet them looneys gon' crash you
Fuck how you feel, boy you ain't never where its real
Go hand to hand up in the field before my baby miss a meal, whats the deal?

[Bridge 1]
AYE AYE AYE AYE
You Know
Niggas really touch down in New York really havin' it nigga
Big gas, Big drank, you smelt it before you seen it, You Dig!

[Verse 2]
Hallelujah, that ruger bend up your medulla
Wrist on Bobby Boucher ain't no spittin' in the cooler
You know they watch how we maneuver
In that Lexo moving slimey through the sewer
Bussin' plays, corner of the brick look like filet-o
Duck my bitch before I ever duck a fade -oh
Hunger games, taking anything that come with fame
Money, Power, Pussy, Power, bitch its all the same
All that talking, it don't mean nothing if you never show me
Mask up on me, like Mick Foley
Benji's on me, Bring it to me, lil baby never leave you lonely
I'm just playing'
Just got you wrapped up in that shit I'm sayin, Super Saiyan
Turn that shit to Armageddon, far from heaven
Making due with all the cards I'm given
Really playin' mouth piece frozen like the Himalaya's
My niggas on that 55th with all that Junior Seau
Fire packs, dodging snakes, you know we slaughter rats
You paid your way to claim the gang now what they callin' that?
Now how the fuck I'm suppose to honor that?
Aye, Aye, Aye
