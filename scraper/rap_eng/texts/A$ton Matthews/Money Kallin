[Chorus x2]
I can hear the money callin'
I can hear the money callin' BRRRT!
SKRRRT! SKRRRT! WHIP IT! WHIP IT! HELL YEAH!
SKRRRT! SKRRRT! WHIP IT! WHIP IT!


[Verse 1 - A$ton Matthews]
Smokin' on that S.G.P., all my niggas T.T.G.,
Slippin' thats an R.I.P., all these lil niggas know they heard bout me
Known to get it brackin' on sight
New bitch looking off white
Nowadays hittin' all types
Lookin like its one of them nights
Headshots in the moonlight
Double back, run it back twice
Why you even talkin' out ya place
Boy I'll pull some hundreds out the safe
Put some halos all around ya face
Hundred killers murder was the case
Boy I only see wolves at the dinner plate
Seen the feins slidin' home when they hit the base
Boy I'm forreal I'm that quarterback
For less than a quarter sack, I'll split head of the God of Black
Put that shit right on my fireplace, hold up now let me get cozy
Boy in that bity I'm Tony, Presidential like a rollie
All my killas stay around me, crucify you for the glory
Crown of thorns the fitted on me, Chapovelli really on it

[Chorus x2]
I can hear the money callin'
I can hear the money callin' BRRRT!
SKRRRT! SKRRRT! WHIP IT! WHIP IT! HELL YEAH!
SKRRRT! SKRRRT! WHIP IT! WHIP IT!

[Verse 2 - Kap G]
I can hear the money callin' I ain't stoppin
Niggas actin' like bitches name droppin
Walk around with the bank in my pocket
Bought a couple chains with the diamonds
I can hear it from a mile away
I spend my own bread by the way
I just want the head and the face
Fuck it put the bed in the wraith
Can't be scared of what that money make
Like Tay-K way they run the race
Screamin' free my patnas, Can't believe they locked up
I don't fuck with copper's, Foamposite Copper
Like I worked at Footlocker, And when I work its on us
I'ma turn my team to bosses, Man I took so many losses
Had to enjoy the process, You know what that shit cost us?
Yeah, but I had to succeed, Believed in my dreams
Now I'ma go do it all just for my team, RING, RING, RING, RING

[Chorus w/ Kap G]
(Aye, Who Dis?) I can hear the money callin'
(KAP G!) I can hear the money callin' BRRRT!
SKRRRT! SKRRRT! WHIP IT! WHIP IT! HELL YEAH!
SKRRRT! SKRRRT! WHIP IT! WHIP IT!
