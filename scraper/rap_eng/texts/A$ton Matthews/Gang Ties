[Intro: Lil Mexcco & A$ton Matthews]
You know me bitch!
Haaah
What up, A$ton?
You dig?

[Hook: Lil Mexcco]
Bitch, you know I'm rocking with the gang (Crip)
If you catch a case, don't say a name
I can't fuck with him, because he lame
Who raised these pussy niggas? That's a shame

Bitch, you know I'm rocking with the gang
If you catch a case, don't say a name
I can't fuck with him, because he lame
Who raised these pussy niggas? That's a shame

[Verse 1: Lil Mexcco]
Heard about yo' 9 but this' a Uzi
I've been going crazy with that tooly
Bitch, I got some clips, let's make a movie
Heard that that's your bitch, but she just blew me
Money make her come and make her fornicate
This that [?] bitch, I just poured the 8
Flexing on these niggas, I ignore the hate
Baby I'm the truth, just let me demonstrate
I just bought a brand new 50
Only smoking killa, I be picky
Pull up on a nigga in a jiffy
I can't trust a soul cuz niggas [?]
I be smoking dope so bitch, you know I'm hot
Did this with no effort, I ain't even try
Speaking on my name, then he must wanna die
Lost so many niggas, I couldn't even cry
They don't gotta ask, I make it happen
Never thought that I'd be in rappin'
Take me to my past, bitch I'm trappin'
You can run up on me, I ain't lacking (nigga)
Call the shots, just like a boss
Sip codeine, don't even cough
He ain't tough, he really soft
Hit yo' block and tape it off
(Yeah, Yeah)
Poppin' on these meds, got me nautious
They know Mexcco ain't taking losses

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
You know I'm rocking with the gang
218 to 223 to 1, I be the same
[?] you can't pay no fee to hang
Looney gang, some MAC-11's, bitch you know the name (Hol' up)
In the 50 [?] 30 get you bread up
I be with the [?] only V is for Vendetta
Hit you with that (Pff, pff) bodies fall for that Baretta
Niggas call for peace, so when it's action we don't [?]
Ay, put your facial on a T-shirt, now he hurt
Paid about a [?] for the fee work
Know I mix the Fendi with the Gucci
Mix the [?] with the [?]
I sold [?] I'm a [?]
Brand new shmoney, shake it up, yeah, we some hot niggas
Don't do kokos, don't take photos when I wop nigga
I'm stutter steppin in my sleep
Bitch, I'm bustin. Bitch, I'm B
I don't make it hard to see
Index finger for the trigger or the P
Between me and that money, that ain't where you wanna be
See my baby need to eat
See my loved ones need to feast
See my momma need to go and treat the wagon like a G
