(A$ton)
Hit ya bitch, now hit a lick
Grinding when ya hear the clips
Click
Choppa choppa style you, gonna feel this shiit *boy*
I used to be a young drug dealer
Wait, fuck boy, still a young drug dealer
I got more money, got more killers
Downers, uppers my stock rise
As my bitches, double clip they head
Ditch the shovel, got the bricks to shuttle
Brick Flair, swiss mail
Long range with the McNair
Brick flair, fish scale
Eat the big shrimp without the fishtail
Inglorious clique bastards me and Undertaker switched caskets switchblade through the brick traffic
Get a nose full at the rose bowl from this blitz package shoot first cause this shits active
Momma know im brazy young dumb nigga with a trigger on safety i was bathing in ape when i was leaving brains on the pavement
Pussy dont play me i rose from the dark with a 40.cal hole in my heart rose gold I'm stone cold glow in the dark
Bitch i taught Moses to part bitch i brought Noah the ark you can run and get jump in
So i laced up and put the pump to ya jump man ice cream truck
Man guns in the truck man drugs in the truck man call me the front man

(Chorus)
Never run no snitch never front no bricks
Get it down never fried yo bitch
Might gun on shit but they'll never get it down like this
Imma go on like this, go on like this they never gonna see another one like this
Put your middle fingers up like this if you dont give a fuck like this
I’m the one like this go on like this I’m the one like this go on like this
Go on like this I’m the one like this II’m the one like this they never gonna see another one like this
Put ya middle fingers up like this if you don't give a fuck like this
I’m the one like this
