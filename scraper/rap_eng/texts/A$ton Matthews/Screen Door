[Intro: A$ton Matthews]
What's the word, what's the word, what's the word?
You are now about to witness the strength of narcotics

[Hook: Vince Staples]
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Bobby Johnson ain't my OG, this ain't no movie role
Pop's was off that O.E., trippin', gettin' his Tookie on
Thunderbird with Gold Ds, a felon and parolee
McDonald's for the Double Cheese, pockets fit a couple C-Notes
Up on the screen door sayin' pack it up and leave but we don’t read those
Cause the money comin' faster than your bitch, nigga
All my life I wanted to be a rich nigga
But homie let me proceed
Pop's was moving slow poke, that's way before the codeine
Just methadone and powdered H to junkies with the sour faces
Knocking on the screen door asking for their homie Nate
Ten to twenty each, 4p.m. he leave so don't be late
Mom up off of work asking me if anybody came
To kick it with my dad or was he chilling in the alleyway
He was in the alleyway, that's what he always had me say
Slangin' for them bills he had to pay somebody at the door

[Hook: Vince Staples]
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Pots on top of the furnace, Glocks on top of the kitchen
Table-tables is turning, now my father is trippin'
He shootin', sniffin', and sippin', pigs recruitin' them snitches
Cause testimonies from homies can lead to longer convictions
Police knockin' at my door, pretendin' nobody hear him
Police knockin' down my door with judicial system permission
Contraband in where we livin', hope I don't get thrown away
In the prison dogs are sniffin' backyard full of canes
Catch a case and knock it out, niggas fighting every day
Choppers circle cause a nigga chop hard on the blade
Got broads on the base, slangin' rude, we bangin' too
Where you from?
If they got that back, we clapping coming through
Going dumb, 40's selling water profit from the slums
Since we was young money been the motive
Nigga, get you some guns and dough
Bruh, I love them guns and dough, find me slangin' for the low
Come around, you getting domed, somebody at the door

[Hook: Vince Staples]
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?

[Outro: A$ton Matthews]
Hanh? Hello? (What's the word?)
Fuck is you doing, mayne? (Brrp-brrp!)
Qué pasa, Gotti? What's brackin'? Hanh?
Got five muhfuckers down with that all-dizzy
You know? 'Cause we really out here trippin', my nigga
You know what I'm sayin'? (What's the word?)
Right here wildin', my G (Brrp-brrp!)
Whatever you need, I got it
Just come with demands (ayy!)
Or get socked on! Hanh? Ayy! Ch-ch-ch!
