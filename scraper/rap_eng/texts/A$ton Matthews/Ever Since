[Pre-Chorus}
Ever since I could remember I been gettin' paid, I been up for days, lost up in my ways over petty (skrrrt)
Ever since I could remember I been gettin' paid, I been up for days, lost up in my ways over petty change

[Verse]
Raised from round the field, living, dying bout that dollar bill
Youngin's busting scripts and poppin pills just to chase the thrill
These are just the times we living in, living just to die so we runnin up them dividends.. Binannands
Shoutout my PDLs what's the dinaneal
Right hand up to God Im'a lie on any stinnanand
They know how we rockin' you know we ain't goin
If you ain't official boy it ain't no way that we ain't knowin'
Who you think you foolin who you really pressin
I got all the Crip's and Ese's turnt up in the section thats the 56 duece
Catch me WooPin through the 310
Westside Barson baby had to let em know
Heard the end is comin, steppin to it
Bricky Valens baby please don't shoot me down
Soulja rag hanging since a Juvenile
Make 'em make a move or make 'em move around
Niggas talking P's and they ain't move a ounce
Boy I'll lose a bitch before I lose the count

[Chorus]
Ever since I could remember I been gettin' paid, I been up for days, lost up in my ways over petty (skrrrt)
Ever since I could remember I been gettin' paid, I been up for days, lost up in my ways over petty change
I been up for days, I been up for days
When it's time to make a scene We gon' set the stage
I been up for days, I been up for days
When it's time to make a scene We gon' set the stage

[Outro Skit]
No peace. Because, for the simply fact is, how am I gonna be cool with you if you smoked one of my homies I gave a fuck about or I loved. Then we gonna come back and be straight? My nigga that shit ain't cool homie. Stop playing homie. This gangbangin' shit is watered down. All this punkass shit niggas thats enemies clickin' up y'all niggas some bitches. We gangbangin'!
