[Intro - Excerpt from the film 'Goodfellas']
Jimmy: There was a kid we knew, turned out to be a rat
Henry: Really?
Jimmy: Yeah. Found him hiding in Florida. How would you feel about going with Anthony, take care of that guy?

[Verse 1]
Pay me everything you owe me, Boy I need every nickel, dollar out a fiend
Started from a dollar and a dream but everything ain't always what it seems
Alot of real ones died behind the scenes
Alot of cowards taking all the fame
Knowing if we pressin' ain't nobody bout to die about yo name
Who u think you foolin?
If yo name ain't holding weight then what you think you really movin?
My dogs eatin' full plates - you niggas gettin' full clips
Loose aim for the loose lips
6 holes for your face, send them black rose for ya wake
You ever been so close to the gates
That God will look you right up in yo face
And say he never knew you
Yeah -
He look you right up in yo face and say he never knew you

[Hook]
Glory Hallelujah, Oh Glory Hallelujah, Oh Glory Hallelujah, Glory Hallelujah, Oh Glory Hallelujah

[Bridge - The Lord's Prayer]

[2nd Verse]
Living like I'm in and outta coma
Xannie's, lean and tree's my persona
She don't need a man she need a owner
Whip her, flip her, sit her on a corner
Make her go bring that back - put that money in my hand
I don't need no lip just a couple bands
Get a couple people out them jamz
Knock a couple people off them stands
While I got my feet up in the sand
Foreign bitch bouncing on my lap
She jus tryna fuck me for a visa
Her baby daddy paying for a feature
I ain't really into doing business
Sayin' where you hangin, where you slangin, pussy boy but you could've been a witness
And we don't ever ever play that-
Ain't no better way for me to say that
Young looney rida out the set-
Trippin since I came up out the womb - know I'm down to ride for my respect
Yamborghini got it on the neck
You looking at the God up in the flesh
Ever since I walked across the water
And led up all the lambs up to the slaughter
And knocked the world up out its order
