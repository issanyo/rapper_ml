[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Ain't gotta tell em we the niggas cause they already know
Coke bout to go, scales of the dro
All my niggas with the business, they living cutthroat
Give his ass the green light, nigga everythings a go
Nigga grab that clip, and load that 4, it's time to roll
You see these niggas it's all for show, everythings a go
Nigga spray that shit, sit back reload, then let it blow
? I bet he know that everythings a go

[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
All my niggas with it
And if they can't find you they settle for your younger siblings
Catch a baby momma slipping, hurt a nigga feelings, cuz you tripping
These niggas running they lips man, lets see if they with the business
Slap a clip then let it off and turn his hardtop avert
Bang the turf and let whoever rock this rest in peace shirt
You see me squirting, and ? the preacher giving lectures
On how I feel bad but soon it's gon' all be better
And he's a lie if you snitch you a die
Hell flying out that barrell watch a motherfucker fry
If it's the last thing I do, ima motherfucking ride
Live by it and ima die with this chopper by my side, Fatts

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
37 for the old team, 45 if you dont know me
Kush codine with a OE, Molly made for that ?
? This shit get hot if you owe me
Put an 81 in your spot, know your block shooting like Kobe
Ric Flair, AKA clap em down
Looking for that PhD, these bitches getting cap and gown
We was having it now cutthroat we was having it now
These dirty birds gonna squirt a curb and gonna somersault faceplant the ground
Well fuck around you fuck niggas we don't play that
It's the tan Moses, I part the sea in my wavecap
Keep that ho in order so hit a nigga for that holy water
That's Versace silk when I'm baptizing your only daughter
