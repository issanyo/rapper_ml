[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Million dollar man got the million dollar plan
With the million motherfucking dollar bill
Fortune better come with the wheel
I'ma r-o-b, bust steel
Same dude from the b-l-o-c-k
Brand new c-l-o-c-k
I'ma shoot like Kevin Durant till the clock stop
All up in your Xbox, kill a pussy put a halo on it
I made it popular to be Papi, and went ahead and put J Lo on it
Famo, fuckin' low, desert storm camo
Smooth, like Randall
Cunningham running through the tackles
I'm back like spinal c-o-r-d
For real like n-e-r-d
I'm crashing any party
Like now your bitch is with me
How I live it up r-u-l-e
Jah got a case of the Mo-e-t
Get to the spot, every drink on me
Shorty yell, "Pour your drink on me"
It's Young Don

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
One more time let me take you there
One more shot let me take you there
One two times let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you where you've never been
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you where you've never been

[Bridge: Bodega Bamz]
Gangstas, what up? Bitches, what up?
Gangstas, what up? Bitches, what up?
Gangstas, what up? Bitches, what up?
Gangstas, what up, nigga?

[Verse 2: Bodega Bamz]
What it look like? My flow mean ‘cause it cook right
Shook ones come around only mean to get shook twice
Before I get booked, I'ma book flight
Change the forecast for a price
Outta town with a pistol got a body, never found with it
Stay above water or get drowned
With the keys in the duffle and a hound with it
Coming for my head took the crown with it
Bitch got a cake bring a pound with it
Still teary eyed liked a Gemini, may kill a Juno
Any nigga tryin' to stop we
T-a-n-b-o-y, money sign
With these bars I give a life for some peace of mind
Never fear it, rap game will try to break your spirit
You can listen to lies but don't hear it
You feel me, I false profits, counterfeit money
I won't stop it till everything's for me I'm like [?]
Nobody cares, life is ugly
Show pain ‘cause I know you don't love me
I played along, knowing it's fake
Everybody got a time and date, I just wait now

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
One more time let me take you there
One more shot let me take you there
One two times let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you where you've never been
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you where you've never been
