[Verse 1]
I put that pussy on a track
Make that pussy go to work
I never put a pussy in a verse
But bet I'll put that pussy in the dirt
Chop, chop, chopping on sight
Fast chop, chopping all white
Put that money on your head
My niggas gon' be chopping all night, chopping all night
Man down, first in, last out
06' I was hand in hand with the grams
But I never took a hand out, cashed out
Pussy, now I'm riding round with that nina
Smoking on keisha, got four choppers in the two seater

[Hook x2]
Poppa pump, big poppa pump
Riding round my city dawg, I'm big poppa pump
Pop the chump, drop 'em in the trunk
Riding round my city dawg, I'm big poppa pump

[Verse 2]
Mac-11, Mexican mack
Keep the packs where I'm supposed to keep the medicine at
Ahead of the trap, I hit you when I sell the shit back
A Helen Keller with a head in my lap, I'll settle for that
All seeing now, seeing shit you ain't seen before
Skin a minc with the cap, what the fuck I need a Peter for
Skid a blow in the tippytoes, tippytop is where the bitches go
Fuck 'em all just to get the dough
I'm so West side, that 45, that 710
Getting head from two lesbians, text messaging
No time outs like Chris Webber in Michigan
Got racks like Wimbledon, from the bricks in the Michelin
Chip you off, you ain't chipping in
Light em' up, then I finish him

[Hook x2]
Poppa pump, big poppa pump
Riding round my city dawg, I'm big poppa pump
Pop the chump, drop 'em in the trunk
Riding round my city dawg, I'm big poppa pump
