[Verse]
This that Young Nino, mean Latino Heat
My Yung Migos prrr prrr when them kilos speak
Shout my nino get perico cheap
Zona one and he don't leave
My chapins know what the lingo mean
Having fantasies of the Kilo Kish
With two bad bitches geeked off E
Getting top while I lean on three
And I'm liable to eat all three's
Brick Flair, El Camino rolling kilo G, woop
Scarface with the Alvida
Hanna Montana jaw fever, the flame
Moonsault like they saw Lita
I face to eat up a whole leader
I mean, West Barson getting busy
I'm on the North Side through the 50's
Run up on me, nigga going be history
Got lil' chuco with the semi
And my nigga jackpot stash box riding with me
Loonie gangsta to the L gang, do the same thang
Kill the same lames, choppa let ya brain hang
Nigga spray spray, enemigo do the nay nay
We don't play play, hollow tips get yo face ate
Bitch I think I'm Eddie Guerrero
Right, left, and two-step with the devil
Run your mouth, I'll pull your strings like Geppetto
Knock the kings out your deck, Razor blade to ya neck
Cutthroat be the set, get wet

[Hook x2]
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Hop out get the same lit
Bad bitch ain't neva seen wit me
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Hop out get the same lit
Rolex, you never seen 10
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Green light, then it's on sight
Bodies droppin' choppin' all night
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
Everythin' lit, everythin' lit ha
