[Intro]
Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?
Aye, You Shmell?!

[Verse 1]
We been holding hammers
Since that Country Grammer
Bandana tied up like Juelz Santana
Triple couple of that dirty fanta
That muddy heavy
You gon' need the backup, that F&N gon' eat ya back up
My nerves so bad so bitch that heat'll act up
Ya squad full of them clique jumpers and dick suckers
My neck, arm, and my wrist flooded, my cliques covered
The bricks runnin up the numbers all across the board
And you don't get the picture till the clips is drawn
Crossroads? We whoop walkin' across those
Since a snot nose, from concrete my stock rose
Whole lotta shootas when we squad up
Talkin' burberry shoes, Big Tymers
Or I got the hoody with the purple ape
Cup got the purple 8, hit it then I do the race

[Hook]
BRAZY!
Runnin through the numbers watch it make 'em go, BRAZY!
Diamonds always shinin' perfect time to go, BRAZY!
Pull up and we hop out and we make 'em go, BRAZY!
Make 'em go, BRAZY!
Make it look, BRAZY!
Runnin through the numbers watch it make 'em go, BRAZY!
Diamonds always shinin' perfect time to go, BRAZY!
Pull up and we hop out and we make it look, BRAZY!
Make 'em go, BRAZY!
Make it look, BRAZY!

[Verse 2]
Looney Gangsta Mack 11 what they call me
Cause I be out my mind when I be with the homies
218 to 223 we let it loose
Never copped a plea or made a truce, salute B.G. Deuce
T-Stone and Wicked too
Rockin' till they free the truth
Talkin' Half Breed, Killa Slim, and that boy Looney Ru
Do it for the L's, YG's and the OG's
Thats leakin' like a nosebleed, from Gin√≥bili
With no knees, yoppa walkin' like dope feinds
You sold dreams, we sold lean
So both rings gonna go bling
Yellow diamonds like Yao Ming
Heard they talkin' pressure I don't feel it
.44 Drillin, boy we sealin' all them fillings
Porsha 9-11 with the trunk up in the front
Hop out with the chopper same size as Lil Pump

[Hook]
