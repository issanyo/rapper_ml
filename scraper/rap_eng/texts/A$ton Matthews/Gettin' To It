[Intro - Yo Pi'erre, You wanna come out here?]

[Chorus]
They ain't really walking how they talking don't play me
We be chasin' benji's trynna run it up daily
Sleezy on my line my lil baby wanna drain me
Miss me with the extras man it really don't phase me
No it really don't phase me
We be taking chances but it really don't phase me
Always keep it off safety
When we gettin' to it

[Verse 1]
You wanna taste envy I can see it in your face
The water turn to wine, I turned my neck into a lake
Addy 30 turn the night into a day
The world is mine you Cockaroaches really wanna play
Bitch I'm booted up, burnered down
They turn to sheep when all the wolves is 'round
Check the body on my bitch now when I move around
Woo Stupid you ain't heard the word around?
I'm racin' money makin' my heart is vacant
My trigger finger always touchin' faces they call 'em Franklin's
Lil Wocky for the facelift, step in the matrix
A couple different highs now thats the basic's

[Chorus]
They ain't really walking how they talking don't play me
We be chasin' benji's trynna run it up daily
Sleezy on my line my lil baby wanna drain me
Miss me with the extras man it really don't phase me
No it really don't phase me
We be taking chances but it really don't phase me
Always keep it off safety
When we gettin' to it

[Verse 2]
In the field, wood grain on the wheel, we be workin' deals
You know, we got what you want how you wanna feel
Ups, and down's, highs and lows make you fall in love
X and O's without a hug, she just want a thug
Ain't no future in the gassin, she know where they lastin'
Still gonna pull up when she askin' fuck her with a passion
I can still make you feel special
With the hair out bitches treat me like I'm Elvis Crespo
Suavemente, Suavemente
I been singin' bitches chente I forgot to mention
Poured down, Iced up, clip filled
Gucci goggles for the wind chill, BURR!

[Chorus]
They ain't really walking how they talking don't play me
We be chasin' benji's trynna run it up daily
Sleezy on my line my lil baby wanna drain me
Miss me with the extras man it really don't phase me
No it really don't phase me
We be taking chances but it really don't phase me
Always keep it off safety
When we gettin' to it
