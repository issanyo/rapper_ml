[Verse 1: Izaq Roland]
First of all, let me start by saying this
I been dealing with a whole lot, that's for sure
All I know is go hard or go home
I ain't going back, no no no no
If it gets hard then I just go harder, i was soft until I hit the water
I can break down, baller, fuck that, uh uh
Straight out the pond, call it pipe dream
But I am not Spike Lee, this ain't do the right thing
Fuck being local, im thinking global, what is your pride?
You ain't 'bout  nothing, you just be fronting
How you not tired from running your mouth?
They looking all in my direction, so I had to grip on my weapon
They feel my pain from watching
How long 'til you get to stepping it?
That happened where I'm from
Where would I been?
[?]
Look, I do this for my sisters and brothers
You ain't shit if you ain't have to struggle
They dont like me im like fuck em

[Hook: Izaq Roland]
When there ain't no food in the kitchen
I done seen days like this
Days like this, I done see days like this
The clientele ain't be hittin
I done see days like this
Days like this, I done see days like this
There ain't no room for the depending
I done seen days like this
Days like this, I done see days like this
I done see days like this
Days like this, I done see days like this

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
I pour up again and again, treatin' the drought like a drizzle
I split that band down the middle
I be on percocets more than a little
Hold up let me get that motion
I'm bussin' I'm bussin'
Hold up I'm bussin' I'm bussin'
Slaughter your daughter its nothin'
Passin her round to my niggas
They done been down for some years now
Some of them doing years now
Three different highs like I'm in the matrix
Shoot your grill off for them fuckin' franklins
Boy I'm bout done with my fuckin' patience
Got your main bitch sittin on my waitlist
Take that lil bitch when I'm ready
Fuck her like we going steady
She gon' leave me when I'm ready
I run that shit like its nothin'
I remember when there was nothin'
Mamas, daddys, sisters, cousins
All in the same house but this ain't no safe house
Couple primos up in the pinta and I'm on the same route
Think about if it was you
Came from over that border, no papers to prove
You tell me what you would do
There ain't no food on the table and nothing to lose
Summertime head on the roof
You either bangin' or slangin' or in the dirt
I did two out of three when flipped the work
I'm talking Michael Jordan with the Larry Bird
I connect dots for the triple-double
Triple my cut so the zeros double
Dance with devil that cupid shuffle
Stevie World until I'm in a duffle

[Hook: Izaq Roland]
When there ain't no food in the kitchen
I done seen days like this
Days like this, I done see days like this
The clientele ain't be hittin
I done see days like this
Days like this, I done see days like this
There ain't no room for the depending
I done seen days like this
Days like this, I done see days like this
I done see days like this
Days like this, I done see days like this
