[Hook: Bodega Bamz]
Been on these streets for mad years makin' coke move

The PD always come to your rescue
Been on these streets for mad years makin' coke move
Now these bitches tellin' me cash rule
Around me Forty-Five .38 Special

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Built full of body
I'mma kill 'em with success
Razorblade coke come back cut a check
I don't chase the chicken, the chicken chase me
Chicken heads on they knees since the Skate Key
It's all good Tan-Diego to the bank
My Tan Boys real, got ese's in LA
They all say my name: PAPI I'm deep in it
You Niggas beef come with broccoli (We eat bitches)
Push buttons my Papi's well fed
When I give the green light, they don't see red
Hell yeah I run my mouth cause I ain't never use my legs
Snow pure, so pure, I bought a Nazi sled
I'm god like, you niggas can't pray for me
I got wolves and they always bring prey for me
Now they wait for me, Tan Boys, Alchemist, that's very rare for android

[Verse 2: A$ton Matthews]
Choppas Import from Saudi
No Doctor gon' sort the body
Hardcore Holly with Stifflerâ€™s mommy just sniffin mollys
Serve the ice, the lobby sloppy from nostril hockey
My clip is full my wrist is rocky, now get up off me
Pussy, Mini Van Van Gogh
Picasso with the Camo, Pants low let ya man know
That I'm Clipped with the Handles, Randall Cunningham
Stone Cold stunning fans at Summer Slam
Bitch, I keep the bricks in the Tommy boxers
Mi casa blanca, I'm Dalai Lama meets Silkk the Shocker
Get it in and I get it out pronto
Keep your lives low when I drive slow
Mick Foley god flow
OJ's back, black gloves and a Bronco
Man they sneeze off O's, my heat on froze
Your ten toes retreat on those
Cause that choppa break it down, hit that Tebow pose, pussy
