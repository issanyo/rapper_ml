[Intro: Joey Fatts]
It's been four years since I dropped "Million $ Dreams" in Chipper Jones 3
Vince got XXL freshman, we lost Yams
And I'm fresh outta jail from a drive-by shootin' charge
But ain't shit changed, we still on the block
This cutthroat shit still stronger than ever
Pull up, hop out, you can get your shit parked

[Chorus: A$ton Matthews]
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked

[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
[?] gang, shooter gang, kill whoever choose to hang
Without a face, without a name, without a gun, without a case
Fresh up out the county jail for crackin' at a nigga place
Just got off a tour bitch, my name been crack in other states
Hunnid Gs in a safe, ten to get them out the way
Probably could've bought a Wraith instead I bought a hunnid K
Slap a drum on it, my lil homie get bucks for days
Opps didn't want it, we outside nigga, come and play
Okay, lay him down, zip him up, body bag, pick him up
Toe tag, his mama crushed, playing cutthroat, get killed
Know not to fuck with us, nigga, facts

[Chorus: A$ton Matthews]
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked

[Verse 2: Joey Fatts]
I put that shit on Crip street, these niggas pipsqueak
Quick to put a nigga 6 feet, I swear this shit deep
All that internet thuggin' gon' get your body Swiss cheese
If you think that I'm bluffin', come and try me my nigga, please
Drop a pin and we can meet, fuck that talkin', we gon' see
Bring whoever you gon' bring, this .40 all I need
Clip long as limousine, hit the scene and clear the scene
All this pressure, he can't breathe, on a stretcher how he leave
Walk up on him like a fiend, like the lil bro died
The squad lost they mind, every other day we slidin' and pilin' homicides
Ain't no debate they ridin' seven to Poppy side
Smoke a nigga and spray his candle light while his mama cry

[Chorus: A$ton Matthews]
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit parked
Pull up, hop out, nigga get your shit pâ€”
