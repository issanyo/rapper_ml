[Chorus x2]
Lil baby buss it down on ya ten toes
Pop it for a nigga flooded wrist to his earlobes
New faces 'round me we ain't never did those
Gemstone, Flintstone, graves will get pissed on

[Verse 1]
Let my nuts hang clip draggin to the floor
Tell me what you think baby tell me know ya know
Its killas on the scene, junkies at the door
Its a witness on the scene, witness on the floor
Wockey and the Tech got the shit in rotation
Live from the gutter now we switchin' locations
Never did the Trues, Robin jeans, or the Maisons
Snakes up in the garden put the Gucci's through the laces
Welcome to the concrete jungle
Got Lions, got Tigers, got Bears, no muzzle
And they all wanna start big trouble
Big trey-eight long nose no muzzle
Ooh the jewels like Santana
Yamborghini high I drop a 8 in a Fanta
10 toes down I ain't never been a scammer
Had the E.I. since Nelly went and made the Country Grammar

[Chorus x2]
Lil baby buss it down on ya ten toes
Pop it for a nigga flooded wrist to his earlobes
New faces 'round me we ain't never did those
Gemstone, Flintstone, graves will get pissed on

[Verse 2]
Heard they callin' for the peace, might as well just call police
I can put you in the ground or I can put you on ya feet
Ooh- bussin' plays where you wanna meet
Couple things, go through out the week
Mixin' Gucci with the Saint Laurant, foreign when I walk
Fuck ya baby off the lingo cause she like the way I talk
Set the trap, put the pussy in my lap
Thumbin' through these benjis baby please don't touch the strap
Runnin' laps, switchin' lines up like they tapped
Momma know I'm Brazy thats a Fendi, thats a fact
The enemigos keep the stats
'Cause everytime they pull up they end up on they back

[Chorus x2]
Lil baby buss it down on ya ten toes
Pop it for a nigga flooded wrist to his earlobes
New faces 'round me we ain't never did those
Gemstone, Flintstone, graves will get pissed on
