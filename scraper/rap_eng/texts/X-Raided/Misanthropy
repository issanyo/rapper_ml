First Verse:

I'm givin' it to you old school style, no album cover gimmicks
No intros, no shout outs, nothin' but straight lyrics
If you in your car buckle up
But if you don't like what I'm sayin' when you see me knuckle up
No studio gangsta stories or tall tales full of fiction
I'm spittin' the life of a nigga that's full of indecision
Don't know which way to go
At the crossroads
It's time to elevate the game
Cuz they spit the same ol' same
Cuz a nigga done grew up
Through some shit that'll make the average nigga fold up
Thought I had it sowed up
But hold up, you know what?
I realized the World wouldn't give a fuck whether I'm here or not
And that's contrary to all that other madness that you hear a lot
Ain't no bigger figures, just us niggas
Sometimes they give us action
This shit is crashin' back to Earth like Michael Jackson
It don't matter how much scrilla
You got, you still a nigga
They either assassinate your character, frame ya, or they kill you
I don't blame you, if you don't feel the, game I wrote
We've been brainwashed, unconscious prisoners ever since we left the boat
Subliminal messages from bands to reject this shit
But they can't hide the truth no matter what they try to do
My judgment day is everyday
Fuck what they say
And make 'em pay
Grab your H.K., and dragon slay
And make a day
Would you rather ride or stay a puppet?
In the ghetto makin' crumbs, why they makin' scrilla by the bucket
But fuck it
To each his own
But to me it's on
Fuck the chest, forget the vest, I'm aimin' for enemy domes
Cuz only the strong, survive, one life to live
Let off some rounds
What's that sound?  It's goin' down

Chorus:

Fuck all y'all
Fuckin' with my mind
Until you all fall
Misanthropy
Fuckin' with my mind
You can't understand yours
Now can you understand my
Misanthropy?
(2x)

Second Verse:

I did four hundred years in Hell
Now they tryin' to give me twenty-five to life in the cell
Got'cha boy on the run and if they catch me it's over
Rollin' in a Nova
Three-fifty packin' a forty-caliber Mag importer
Declarin' war, on the system
Askin' for help, but the muthafuckas didn't listen
They tried to get killed, but now they label me a killer
You lived by the scroll, but you gone die by the scrilla
Neither of you can see the pain in my eyes, fuck a disguise
I wear it on my shoulder like a bass
Causin' casualties like M*A*S*H
Been a soldier in the truest sense
Born and raised in a war zone, it's always on
And you can die in an instant
As infants grow up to be convicts
Knew how to shoot a gun since the age of six
Little lunatic
Papa didn't wanna raise a punk
Beat'cha til' you hate it, his ass grew up and beat'cha while you ride punk
I'm unapproachable, can't nobody tell me shit
I got my mind made up, fuck a psychiatrist
I don't need nobody tryin' to tell me what I'm thinkin'
The ghetto is stuck on quicksand and it's sinkin', it's goin' down

[Voice Taped From A Speech]
We are peaceful people
We are loving people
We love everybody who loves us
We're non-violent with people who are non-violent with us
We are NOT non-violent with ANYONE, who is violent with us


Chorus

Third Verse:

]From day one the odds was against me
Nate one have love for a nigga, so the Devil tried to tempt me
To loc up, revolt, rebel
Said "You might as well
You already, livin' in Hell"
I got, somethin' in my soul tellin' me "Nigga this shit ain't right"
The Lord never answered, but I prayed with all my might
So fuck waitin' patient, it's a virtue I don't have
I got money on my mind and I want my shit in cash
Fuck a forty acre and a mule
I want everything that you owe me, it's time to pay your dues
I was used, and abused, for centuries
But when they mention warfare, they never mentioned me
But can you picture me?
On top of the World?  Runnin' shit with a major attitude
Madder than that prophet bitch
With a clip full of shit
Tearin' your ass to pieces, when the trigger releases
You're deceased and you got them P.D's, D.A's, judges and polices
Peep the thesis
We gets, hot like volcanic lava
I'm down to slide a niggas drama
Speedin' shit up like some java
Fuck a comma
It don't pause, I'm steady unloadin'
Unstoppable nigga the Glock goes plop-plop on that ass
And suckers steady foldin'
I'm hatin' men like the lesbians
Always down for drama doin' shit just thesbian
Only love my Mama, traumatize your ass with the quick
Better come prepared if you try to ride or try to diss my clique
It's goin' down nigga

Chorus (2x)
