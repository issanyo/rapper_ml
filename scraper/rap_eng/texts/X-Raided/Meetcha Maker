[Intro, exerpt from a movie clip. Man is crying while saying this]

I swear, I was asleep nigga
All of the sudden I opened up my eyes and it was like...
Oh man it's just, it was just like he was right there you know, he just appeared (Menacing laugh in the background)

[Verse 1]

I'm like a full moon in the sky
When you see me and you know it's about to be another crazy night
X-Raided Loc back up in that ass bitch
If you slippin, that's what your muthafuckin ass get
My gun is like my dog and I be yellin "Stick em!"
Give me 24 feet or be another dead victim
I ain't got a heart for none of them busters, and I ain't got no reason
And ain't nobody comin to save you cause it's open season
I squeeze the trigga and feel the kick a little
I'm lookin at you in your eyes while your face is splittin down the middle
Now here's a riddle
Do you got an answer for this
What do they call it when your body's stiff?
Rigamortis
Niggas pullin out OE for their dead homies
But I ain't pullin out shit cause I didn't know him
And ain't no love for him
So while you reminiscing me and my mix is yellin "Rest in piss, bitch!"
We can take it to the next level
Pick your weapon
Make the grave digger go and get his shovel
And dig a hole deep enough for you to meet your maker
X-Raided Loc #1 Life taker, everybody die

[Hook]

Ain't no way around it
They search for the fountain of youth
But they never found it
And on the day I die ain't nobody gonna cry
Everybody wanna go to Heaven but don't nobody wanna die
But everybody die (x2)

[Verse 2]

Now they huntin for my like they did Frankenstein
Gang of niggas like that Lynch Mob pogo sign
They got torches, ropes, and riot pumps
I can either be a soldier or a quiet punk
And I ain't never been nothin but a blocc banger
Young rider
Packin me a brain hanger it don't stop
It'll be another homicide
I like your glass house, nigga
Get your ass out
About to pass out or shoot your jaw
Cause I got that fat .44 magnum caliber pointed at your jaw
Got my hair in an afro-puff cause I'm in a rage
I know you feel me baby, we on the same page
A 12 gaauge will put you on your back
We'll get along better when you're dead cause I'm a necrophiliac
I pull your caps in your brain and shorts
So I can see what the fuck you was thinkin about cause evidently you ain't knowin
Can't nobody fuck with Raided with this whole shit
So I'mma have to lobotomize you with this whole clip
To let you know that I'm the #1 Life Taker
X-Raided sendin muthafuckas to meet their maker
Everybody dies

[Hook]

I'm gettin visions late at night like Ebenezer Scrooge
Dead homies comin back to tell me what to do
Paranormal activity like a poll or dice
Or these invasions of these people that came to Sac to life
I can't explain it and I really don't see no need to
Cause you can feel me if you drunk and off that weed too
Those little voices gettin in my head sayin "It's time to murder"
So if you slippin while I'm trippin I might have to serve ya
I'm sicker than a nigga that shoots the 9
That's why my sight tryna make me take cynic time
But fuck bein calm
I'd rather tear up shit
Let everybody know X-Raided Loc is in this bitch
I'm a nigga that you can't handle
And every night I see the flame of death in the flame of a candle
Tellin me to turn the 9 on myself
But there ain't enough liquor on the store shelf
To get me drunk enough to contemplate a suicide
You or me who would I rather kill you decide
But keep in mind I'm the #1 Life Taker
X-Raided sendin y'all niggas to meetcha maker

[Hook]
