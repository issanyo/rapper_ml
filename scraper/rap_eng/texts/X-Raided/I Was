[Bridge]

At the end of the day I can say I had a nice life
And I wouldn't change much if I could live and die twice
Maybe go back, focus on getting my mind right
And clear my eyesight
You know what they say about hindsight (Hey)
With 20/20 vision I could see the drama coming
And keep my life quiet and peaceful like inside my mama's stomach
Before your favorite rapper was sayin a lot of nothing
Around the time Willy moved in with Mr. Drummond

[Verse 1]

And it was close just so close nothing was black and white
Right was in 9 rooms and it's just the facts of life
As a kid I was toured on that song til I threw up
The day my grandma died I swear I cried til I threw up
My mom's brain blew up
Her heart's full of pain
And I guess she couldn't take it cuz she never was the same
That changed my whole life started slidin down the drain
That's why I rarely drive down memory lane
But when I do it ain't all bad
Sometimes I wanna call dad
Tell him man to man that I needed him but as a fall back
What's done is done
You can't win a race that's already been won
He could've been a better father and I could've been a better son
And yet it's never 1 set of circumstances that define a life
Like would it all be different if I came out my mom's vagina white
We'll never know (???)
But you can't plan to win the lottery and never buy a ticket

[Hook]

I was 16
Having wicked and sick dreams
And witnessing Crip schemes
On missions to get creamed
Seein (??????)
And kids that will never know what legitimate intimacy means (x2)
I was 16

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]

Only the Cosby kids
And the Hosby kids
Cliff Lee and Theo
Probably doin a dying bizz
Where I live
Now I'll fix you cuz your family matters
Imagine being teen and seeing your family shattered
I went from Sac to
Mobile, Pirginity and back to
Sac to
Waco, Fort Worth and back to
Back track from
Waco to Huntsville, Alabama and right back to
Prichard, Waco, and right back to Sac-town
24 months
Ridin dirty greyhound busses
But I guess it is what it is
What can I say while disgusted
I got a sack of crack-coke and strap
Hit the streets
If I cam home at all didn't speak
Just hit the sheets
Smellin like beer pussy and weed
Woke up the next morning change clothes repeat
What you know about wearin the same (out)fit for 3 days
Sellin rocks to cats like to feed on BJs
That Eddy Murphy cartoon servin that free base
That homie's mama on her knees doin a 3-way
Hittin her doggy style
She's getting boned out
For 1 rock she put it in her mouth and zoned out
And on the block
I was 16

[Hook]

[Deconstruct]

I got a sack of crack-coke and strap
Hit the streets
If I cam home at all didn't speak
Just hit the sheets
Smellin like beer pussy and weed
I was 16
