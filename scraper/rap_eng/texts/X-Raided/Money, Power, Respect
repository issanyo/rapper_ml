* one of five new releases on the Greatest Hits album

First Verse (X-Raided, with studio enhanced voice):

I gave you money, power, respect, cars and gold
Made you a star, platinum cards, scar up your foes
Had your back, through it all, my love never expired
Down to do it all, I did it, no matter what you desired
All I required, was that you keep it real with me
And any man that crossed your path would have to deal with me
He was in it in the beginning and through the start of it all
On 24th Street, rappin' for guns and smokes
Write bars everyday, stay battlin' niggas
On the corner, in the hood, dismantlein' niggas
I was watchin' you, vowed that you could excel at somethin'
Instead of sittin' in the dank house steady inhalin' somethin'
So I snatched you up, put you at the right place at the right time
Open mic night at the club, with the right bass and the right rhymes
Got discovered, your chance of a lifetime, got a contract big
Now you pushin' cassettes and compact discs
Doin' videos and shows too fast
With your crew, thirty deep, smokin' O's and hash
But you didn't want to sign autographs, no respect for your fans
You forgot where you came from, you think you the man!
I gave you money, then when your second album dropped
Dubbed you with bad reviews, low sales, and this was the plot
You got dropped from the label's roster and lost all that you gained
Not a peep to your name cuz you disrespected the game

[Chorus: X-Raided & Studio enhanced voice of X-Raided]
(Both) I gave you money, power, respect, cars and gold
Made you a star, platinum cards, scar up your foes
I was there, through it all, my love never expired
Down to do it all, I had your back, no matter what you desired
All I required, was that you keep it real with me
(Enhanced) And any man that crossed your path would have to deal with me
(X-Raided) But is you still with me?
(Enhanced) Livin' in debt forever eternally
(X-Raided) Then turn to me
(Enhanced) Get your head together

Second Verse (X-Raided + Enhanced Voice):

(X-Raided)
You gave me money, power, respect, cars and gold
Made me a star, platinum cards, scar up my foes
You had my back, through it all, your love never expired
Down to do it all, you was there, no matter what I desired
All you required, was that I kept it real with you
And any man that crossed my path would have to deal with you
I feel it's true

(Enhanced Voice)
Then why you go against the grain?

(X-Raided)
That's what children do

(Enhanced Voice)
That's why I had to commence the pain
To convince your brain, to never circumvent the game
You'll be resented, don't be tempted by illusions of fame

(X-Raided)
For in this game, I'm choosin' to follow the rules and change
Loosenin' my steelo, bruised my ego, assumed the pain
Losin' my people

(Enhanced Voice)
They're evil, you don't need 'em to live
They have no love, and love is what you need 'em to give
It's me and you against the World

(X-Raided)
I finally figured that out
Blowin' trees and crushin' girls is all them fools about
I'm choosin' a route that'll definitely lead to bigger clout
Like the Isley Brothers what I discovered makes me want to shout
What can I do with the respect of a man whose respect is worthless?
How can a man who has no purpose in life serve me a purpose?
Just wanna hurt me, they vicious and merciless

(Enhanced Voice)
What's your mission?

(X-Raided)
Collectin' money in surpluses, my only intention
My only henchmen is the game, keep him near to my heart

(Enhanced Voice)
Mention my name and I'll appear

(X-Raided)
Yeah, til' death do us part

[Chorus]
