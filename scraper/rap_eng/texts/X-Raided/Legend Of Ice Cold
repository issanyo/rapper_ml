[Intro]
Story for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums
Ghetto's and slums
Ghetto's and slums
Story for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums
And every neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums

This is a story for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums
Ghetto's and slums
Ghetto's and slums
This is a story for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums
And every neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums

[Verse 1]
Hey, This is a story for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums
Every neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums
It's so hot, You would swear it's where the devil is from
It's rock n roll but the only heavy metal is guns
Roses often placed on coffins for the dead at receptions
Somebody filled his head with more Led than Zepplin
Kept his weapon in his holster, When he was supposed to shoot it
Guess the truth is he wasn't half Loc'd as reputed
You might refute it
Imma tell you the whole story, Compute it
Imma paint a picture in your mind
Take your time, Review it, I can't dispute it
This nigga was a dangerous thug, He was a 'Rip
But he would bang on his own gang and the Bloods
He was deranged in the brain
Sick and insane and it showed
A tickin time bomb conditioned and trained to explode
Like somebody injected nitro in his veins and they froze
So naturally, Ice Cold was the name that he chose
He was big swole nigga, His arms was 20 inches
A scar on his left cheek from 150 stitches, Razor residue
Had a feud with a dude on Meadowview Road and 29th
Who drew a knife and then he sliced
The night in question, It wasn't less than 9 o'clock on the dot
Ice Cold was ridin around with a 9 Glock and a plot, Dirt broke
But you know how we do it in Sac
We put in work, Loc
In the streets pursuin a jack
He saw a black 'Lac truck
As it stopped at the intersection on Franklin and Florin Road
He headed in it's direction
Followed it down Franklin until it made a right on Mack
And when that turned into Meadowview Road
It was time to make it crack
Driver was on the phone, So he didn't notice it comin
When Ice Cold got out the car holdin chrome, He started gunnin
Target was the driver's head
The first slug shattered the window
The second left the driver dead as the slug battered his temple
Blood splattered the window
Ice Cold didn't give a fuck
He just slowly moved closer
Took a look in the truck
Passenger was a child, About 11, Maybe, Not even
Had a hole in his chest
He was wheezin but still breathin
Not even the nigga Ice Cold was willin to kill a kid
So he said, "Good luck lil' man, You might live"
He stripped the money and jewelry from the victim and cut
True to his name, Not the slightest twinge of guilt in his gut
The kid was still in the truck, Too terrified to move
Looked to his left
And saw that his big brother lied in a pool of his own blood
In desperation, Picked the phone up
Not realizing the left side of his brother's face was blown up
He dialed 911, Said
"Send me an ambulance, My brother is hurt"
"And if you don't hurry, He won't stand a chance"
Operator pleaded, "Talk to me, Please, Just keep fightin"
Then the kid started cryin and said
"Help me, I think I'm dyin"

[Hook]
Picture this, 5 surgeons tryin to keep you alive
You done lost too much blood
You're too weak to survive
They keep fightin, Ordering pints for transfusions
Got your arteries exposed with clamps attached to 'em
Black screen, Green dots, Your pulse is fading
You're getting closer to Satan
Your mama hopin and prayin that you can make it
But the doctor started shakin his head
"Nothing more that we can do"
And then he stated, "He's dead"

[Verse 2]
5 years past, Ice Cold is still bangin
Representin Garden Blocc
Showin no signs of changin
Never got arrested for shootin the kid and his brother
Unsolved mystery, The truth was never discovered
The kid recovered from his injuries, Eventually
After years of being physically and mentally in misery
His memory was vivid
He could close his eyes and visualize
The minute he realized his brother was dead
He couldn't get it out his head, Just couldn't understand
And in homage to the killer, Took the name "Lil' Man"
Listen, The nigga Ice Cold was stickin to the thug thang
Gettin G'z, Flippin them Ki's in the drug game
A nigga from the Blood gang named Damu who had big crack
Got followed home one night
Duct taped and kidnapped
Butt raped and bitch slapped by a nigga in a mask
Who had a Mizzac and asked, "Where the muthfuckin bricks at?"
Wouldn't give up the coke, Damu was a rida
So Ice Cold started pullin out his toe nails with a pliers
It was gruesome, He grabbed his baby
And threatened to shoot him if he didn't give up the birds
So Damu produced them
Ice Cold emerged from the lick with 10 chickens
And 150 Thousand cash that he found stashed in the kitchen
He went on a mission with intent of strictly stackin his paper
Ice Cold never looked back after that caper
But life was slow for Lil' Man
His cash was gettin short
The only thing on his mind was graspin and gettin more
Havin flashes of smashin and robbin a liquor store
Blastin the clerk like O-Dog and dashin to hit the door
Standin on a bridge askin, "What am I livin for?"
Havin thoughts of jumpin off and smashin the river floor
Often askin Jesus, "What you hatin a nigga for?"
Please tell me, Why have you forsaken a nigga, Lord?
Whispers from Satan
"Fuck prayin and fuck patience"
"You want it? You take it"
"Fuck waitin and fuck playin"
At the point of breakin
Lil' Man decided that he had it up to here with being broke
Got his strap and hit traffic
He stopped at a red light on Mack Rd. and Stockton Blvd
By the Motel 6, The parkin lot was full of cars
A blue Lexus coupe, He couldn't help but spot it
As it headed toward the exit
He grabbed his Tek and cocked it
Followed at a distance, Palms all sweaty
Hands shakin on the stearin wheel, But he felt ready
No turnin back now, On Florin Rd. and Power Inn
It's the turnin point of the story
Homie, Now it begins
Lil' Man opened up his car door and rose
Gun in hand, Ran to the side of the Lexus and froze
The driver was dark skinned, Familiar scar on his cheek
They made eye contact, Hearts started to speed
Ice Cold floored the gas pedal, Lil' Man started gunnin
Ice Cold lost control, Lil' Man started runnin
Crashed into a phone pole, Air bags deflated
Lil' Man opened the door
Grabbed his throat and stated
"Yeah, Bitch-ass nigga, I know you remember me"
"Look into my eyes, Let me refreshin your memory"
"You the one who shot me in the chest and murdered my brother"
"You should of killed me, Nigga, You stupid muthafucka"
He beat him with the butt of the gun
And at the height of the pain
He put the barrel to his head and shot him right in the brain
Man murdered Ice Cold, Took his life in the rain
What goes around comes around
That's just life in the game

Black screen, Green dots, Your pulse is fading

"Nothing more that we can do"
And then he sated, "He's dead"
