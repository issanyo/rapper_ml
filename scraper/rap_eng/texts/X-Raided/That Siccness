[Intro: Brotha Lynch Hung]
From the depths of Hell
Comes the muthafuckin bitch killa
The diary of a madman
In case you didn't know you fuccin wit a psycho

[Verse 1: X-Raided]
A crazy nigga'll write some "Psycho Active" nigga shit
Killin bitches and niggas that actually think that they can get with this
Figurin they kiss a dick step but never come close
To the nigga that's known for poppin the muthafuckin mos
Voices in the head is the reason that I'm killin
I'm lovin the way my .9 split your ass up like a prism
I'm crazy as fuck you shoulda known I'm hella locco
If you fuck with me I guarantee I'm gonna smoke yo ass
Casue I blast with my 9 millimeter
If I can't beat ya
The gat will defeat ya
If my bullet reach ya
Straight to your forehead your dead in your grave
It's time to meet Grim Reaper
A nigga like the X Loc no joke though
So hold 4 yo hoe
I let the bitch killin go and turn into a nympho
But no I don't think so
I gots to kill all bitches
Is it cause I'm crazy, or living with that siccness?
That siccness - that cure, I really don't think there is one
The only way to kill yourself is a sucka pound of gizzun
And I am not the wizzun
To go out like a prison
I guess I'm gonna die from that siccness, I'm dizzun

[Verse 2 (Either S.A.C. or  Cyco Loc or Young Meek)]

My siccness, my siccness, I'm out to get paid
If you gots to rip up shit I'm slangin raiser blades
Cause I don't give a fuck who you fuck up
Just reach down deep my nigga and give that buck up
A Heights nigga own that money and power trips up
You gotta let your nuts hang cause mine is scrapin cement

[Verse 3: (Either S.A.C or Cyco Loc or Young Meek]
It's the siccness
I gotta kill a cracker with the quickness
Like walk into his house like a stranger
I grabbed a white bitch by her neck out of anger
The husband came in, I see no pecawood steppin
I didn;t say shit I let my tech do the checkin
The sight was scandalous the way I left these muthafuckas
I lynched em both and had em hangin from a rubber
(SAC is straight filled with that siccness)

[Interlude: X-Raided]
Born in the muthafuckin Gardens
Baby killin til there's blood all over the room
Kickin that deuce-four shit and smokin niggas for the funk up

[Verse 4: Brotha Lynch Hung]
That siccness kicks in that nigga that nigga that raise the shit grips
The realer the nigga the siccness clicks
My nigga the roughness rips
And I'm what you call a muthafuckin prophet
Muthafuckas want the rip style but ain't sayin shit
I got them niggas on the fiend
Give em a little to fuck with them have em fading for the substance
Niggas'll smoke spliff but won't develop a siccness
Lynch ya ignored nigga check first
I held em at gunpoint broke raw
The muthafuckin baby killas gunsmoke led
Straight to the baby's head
My nostrils flare
Veins peak
The muthafuckin .9 went boom
Brains leak
The nigga Lynch's siccness kicked in punk
From the wretched of baby brains
Leakin from the chrome you won't know what's goin on unless ya peeped a "Nigga Deep" verse
That's causin fits
So when I get the 12 gauge and start pumpin it
Infants - the desolate's fiend for death to hit lean
Grip the clip mean
Rip the shit out of a nigga's spleen
Full of full hate
Mickeys on my 08
Drinkin muthafuck dank
Smokin niggas up crank
Slangin ass nigga from the deuce-four Gardens
Give em a bit of a wicked nigga to rip a 12 heart and
It's a siccness
That nigga Chaos hit me with the greens and shit
And I gave birth
Wicked with that muthafuckin siccness

[Verse 4: (Either S.A.C. or  Cyco Loc or Young Meek)]
Siccness
Doin it on my own since I was 12 and Go'd my witness
That's what it's like fuck my child  servant but that's my business
Ask me how I'm livin but I never say
If I was to tell ya then ya wouldn't listen anyway
In '84 a gang of niggas from LA came
I put my quarter in to start to start the dope game
I got the plug and then I hooked it with my partner E
We hit the books we hit the spot location was the G
Born with that siccness so that siccness runnin through my blood
And danger not I reside and give to feed my love
You have that siccness, that siccness make ya blast with the quickness same restraint with the intentions I'mma hit this
Cause every weekend at the club niggas comin there
With they fuckin .22s bustin in the air
A little somethin from ya bank to make the bitches holla
I set the shit out to myself the Meadowview balla

[Interlude 2: X-Raided]
My nigga PeeWee Loc
Finna kick that killa shit you know what I'm sayin
Niggas crazy as fuck
And dyin of that siccness

[Verse 5: PeeWee Loc & (X-Raided)]
(That siccness, That siccness)
That siccness kicks in
Cisco on my breath now I'm headin a pint of Gin
Drunk as fuck will I last til tomorrow
Babys and fumes now I'm livin in the bottle (The bottle)
Time's up caught slippin in a fantasy
Mind gone (Brain gone)
No sense of reality
Sane or insane which one will a nigga try
(187 I'm seeing psycho in PeeWee's eyes)
Split personality now it's time for a fuckin change
Locs on in the dark and I don't know my fuckin name
Deeper and deeper into the bottle I'm thinkin about suicide
(Killin the next nigga to tell the truth I don't wanna die)
I sit cryin in the corner
Shit got me trippin
I grab my .9 for some led
(I got ya clip we can't be slippin)
Slap the extra clip in, nobody here to stop me
Psycho killin PeeWee, and PeeWee wants to pop me
.9 to the head and I'm drippin sweat
Psycho you won't do it
(PeeWee Loc you want to bet)
In the corner still trippin
Thoughts keep on cloudin me
I'm at the point of no return
Ha-ha, I'm out

[Verse 6: X-Raided]
That siccness
I killed 50 people and they hautin me
I sit in the middle of a star with some candles lit thinkin
Maybe I should do that
It's killin me softly my brain is gone and it ain't comin back
I coulda swore I saw my nigga Psycho standin over me
I know it wasn't him cause he's been buried for a week
The silence of the black sheep
Deep in the middle of the night I start to sweat
Window wide open with two holes in my neck
And can't nobody tell me shit, Loc cause every time I close my eyes I hear Psycho say:
("Yo cuz I thought we had a deal")
Mouth wrapped around the barrel and I taste steel
