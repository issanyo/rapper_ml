[Intro]

Yeah!

[Hook]

Either you blind or you out of your mind
But either way you niggas still can't see me
Type of niggas that'll kick off the war
Kick off your door
Run up in yo teepee
You thought he was brave
Until he got popped in his braids
Now they got him on the news on TV
Like I said
Either you blind or you out of your mind
Either way you muthafuckas can't see me

[Verse 1]

I been mean with the flow
All I needed was an obscene producer
And I
Stay stoned like I seen Medusa
That go
Smokin the dro and strokin your ho
If she over 18 seduce her
Let me introduce us properly
Rap name's X Raided
AKA Nefarious
Rap game's next greatest
Call me Jesus
West Coast messiah
Came to bring the West Coast up higher
And I spit fire
Just sayin real truth kill you
Think I was playin fool?
This ain't kind of you
Spontaneous never know what the fuck I'mma do
Stingy with money like I'm a Jew
That's a unnecessary stereotype
Like all niggas got big dicks and men can't jump if they white
My bad
I was tryna keep your stereo hyped
So what I write in my pad
Ain't necessarily right
And it's tight!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Bloc-Blocc Star
Keepin in movin
Deep in and groovin
I flow
You frequently booin
Your music and loosin your ho
You need some improvements
The critics abuse you refuse
Is killin your spirit dude
You need a muse
I'm amused by the news I've beem hearin see now
See you got some new dudes to hear it
They sound like me when I made 'Vengeance is Mine'
And I give it to you for tryin
But I'm big and you little niggas is shyin
Go in the black and rhyme
Tryna copy the best
It's like (????) the best
I'll be probably depressed
If not for the game
It's probably away
Have a dope MC
We'll probably be left
Snoop Dogg!
God drops detox and inspected
And shocks and inject
Direct to the top of the charts
I provide the rest
Like adrenaline shots to the heart
I arrive the hardest sincerely from the top of the heart
It's X Raided nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

X Raided got a flow like Lynch
But since the human's so wicked
Wear the cornrows cause his brain so twisted
Here we go again
Hit rewind if you missed it
He's an incredible rhyme writer so gifted
He's an incredible rhyme bider
Which leaves me to become an inedible rhyme writer
Check 1 2 is the mic on?
I don't want to say it again
That might annoy you like Mike Jones
I'm just tryna write songs
Don't mean to confuse you fools
Scramble your brain like a stupid dude's Rubix Cube (Hey!)
Colors screwed up like a retarded kid crayon
You whack rappers synthetic like Ray on
I heard it was said
Big X Raided was dead
So to get this verse
Rich had to do some say-ons
And I rolls in the grave
Like the crow
But the bird said
Deliver me a magnum and flow
Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 4]

It ain't over
No, no it ain't over muthafucker
Here we go
Hey
Hey
I'm the hardest nigga spittin
In state prison
Since Rash Cash
Was arrested and paroled
Put the best one in control
To grasp and caress this mic
Lay a verse in one roll
Granted death wish in one blow
Plan plot strategize
Mention you was safe vision bone
First
I'll wake up with your face missin
Like Trevolta and Nick Cage
Open this switch blade
Poke your rib cage
And collapse your lung
Snatch your bitch
Kidnap your kids
Snatch your young
Then a ransom note and a package come
50 G's to get back your son
Look inside the box
Can't believe your eyes cause that's his thumb
Which once upon  a time
Was attached to your son
Pay now
Play later
But that damage is done
They say life is too short
And I was born to matter
Leave your cocktails
Northern California's back
It's X Raided
