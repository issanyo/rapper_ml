[X-Raided with Kingpen in background]
And you don't stop (and you won't stop)
Nigga you don't stop (and you won't stop)
Motherfucker you dont stop (and you won't stop)
Nigga it don't stop (and it won't stop)

[Verse 1: X-Raided]
I'm fin' to get retro on y'all
Kick some of that twenty-fourth street sickness, infect the shit
And speed it up like petro on y'all
Hot enough to roast meat like a microwave
I spit it the pycho way
Dedicated to my niggas that fuck, drink and smoke their life away
And I'm stuck in zones hazardous
Known to cut you deep enough to crush your bones
And then I throw that knife away I had to bust
Viciously, cannibus got me readily amped up and animus
?? da pity when you discuss me with animosity
Enemy tones are disrespectful
But my velocity is to swift for you
Nigga you ?? step slow, like penny hardaway
Injury prone I run up in enemies' homes wit tec's
Ain't no otha set to do it any harder way
Than shootouts at high speed and thigh weed
And some nights I might bleed
But for life I'mma keep it trunk tight for my G's
You might squeeze a trigger
But ain't no vilence reported
I work with silencers when I creep so the restort is distorted

[Hook]
My nigga vengeance is MINE
Taking my name in vain and it got me sick in the MIND
Shaking a gain with pain and when I'm tempt to spit NINES
Be insane to change CUZ, fin' to get MINES
WHAT, vengeance is MINE
Nigga vengeance is MINE
You been taking my name in vain and it got me sick in the MIND
Shaking gain with pain and when I'm tempt to spit NINES
Be in-sane to change CUZ, fin' to get MINE
WHAT, vengeance is MINE

[Verse 2: X-Raided]
My degrees is too hot for thermometers
I don't need a heater
When I walk in the room water boils cause I keep a fever spitting flames
I'mma spirestarter, flitting brains
And when it comes to insane shit, don't nobody supplies harder than this madman
Cream puff killer, you seem rough nigga
But I already accomplished shit you dream of nigga
And one of my accomplices get ?? to the ??
Twisted like dreads
Put a fist to the head
'Til it puncture your brain, spit 'til you dead
Pump you with game, tryin' to pump you with pain
But you insist-ed to wake a sleeping dragon, a
Nigga that speaks with madness punk in the game, the
Smokes out my nostrils
Should've been discreet now I'm hostile
To fade me nigga's six times impossible
Nigga you responsible
For this rhyme, self-inflicted wound
?? with better I'm sittin in the room
Butt-naked tryin' to slit your wrists, was doomed to fuck with 'Raided
And that's being nice to you nigga
You know what's up with 'Raided
Don't make me do this twice to you nig-GA...

[Hook]

And you don't stop (and it won't stop)
Nigga you don't stop (and it won't stop)
Motherfucker you dont stop (and it won't stop)
Nigga it don't stop (and it won't stop)
And you don't stop (and it won't stop)
Nigga you don't stop (and it won't stop)
Motherfucker you dont stop (and it won't stop)
Nigga it don't stop (and it won't stop)

[X-Raided talking]
Yeah...Madman....Young Meek Killa nigga
Fuck you, bitch ass nigga

And nigga I had the impulse to write this rhyme and chop your bitch ass, nigga
