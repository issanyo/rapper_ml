[First Verse]
Once again it's that nigga from the deuce four
Fuck the sicc, it's time to get with this hardcore
It's Sac-Town's most Wanted, X-muthafuckin'-Raided
Nine one six most playa hated
Remember Me?  The nigga that brought you Psycho Active
Put Black Market on the map with that psycho rap shit
That was then, and this is now
Don't take it personal nigga I'm bout my business now
I thought y'all muthafuckas knew I can't be stopped
Up in the peneteniary but tapes still drop
Who woulda thought I'd be back?  Takin' this shit up to another level
And rehabilitated X-Raided the muthafuckin' rebel
Time to, settle the score like the Fugees
Bitch ass niggas in Sac-Town wanna do me
Back down true V guns, it's my duty to provide thugs
Shit that makes niggas load up their rugers and ride Cuz
Get in your hooptie if you from the four
And show these niggas how we represent Garden Blocc, when it's time to roll
We put it down, killin' bitches in the drama too
Spontaneous, never know what the fuck I'm gonna do
Simulataneously just hittin' spots
With miscellaneous weapons they often tend to be double digit Glocks
You muthafuckas shoulda known
You underestimated X-Raided so now it's on nigga

Chorus:

Tell me who them muthafuckas wanna kill the most?
X-Raided loc but they never come close!
Why do muthafuckas wanna slow me?
Cuz I put in major work on their homies
(2x)

[Second Verse]
I know you niggas thought the Loc was through
X-Raided can't be underestimated I thought you knew
Now I'm back up in your ass with some new shit
I shipped them fake ass niggas and got a new clique
Sac-Town ain't no love lost
But hey y'all, now the X is back to fade y'all
I'm on the cover of Murder Dog with a mean mugg
And I'm at the top of the twenty sack in forty eighty baby
That Northern Cali love
And muthafuck what you thought it was
Extremely wicked niggas call me Nefarious
With a reputation for lyrical decapitation
Reputed to be the hardest in town and it's so disputed
With a flow like fluid
I can do it any way I wanna do it
Hit you with a twist or slow it down and hit some G shit
X-Raided can't be faded, stay in your place
Recognize game when it's in your face

Chorus
