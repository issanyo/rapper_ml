(FIRST VERSE)
I'm like a full moon in the sky
When you see me
You know it's about to be another crazy night
X-Raided - Loc
Back up in that ass Bitch
If you slipping
That's what your motherfucking ass get
My cousin's like my dog
And I be yelling sick 'em
Give me 24 feet
Or be another victim
I ain't got no regard for none of them Busters
I don't need no reason
And ain't nobody coming to save you
Cause it's open season
I squeeze the trigger and feel it kick a little
I'm looking at you in your eyes
While your face is splitting down the middle
Now here's a riddle
Do you got a answer for this
What do they call it when your body stiff...
Rigimortis
Niggas pouring out 'Ol-E for thy dead homies
But I ain't pouring out shit
Cause I didn't know him
And ain't no love for him
So while you reminiscing me
And my Niggas is yelling rest in piss bitch
We can take it to the next level
Pick your weapon
Make the grave diggers know to include a shovel
And dig a hole deep enough for you to meet your maker
X-Raided Loc - number one Life Taker
Everybody dies

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Ain't no way around it
They search for the fountain of youth
But they never found it
And on that day I die
Ain't nobody going to cry
Everybody wants to go to heaven
But don't know why they want to die

(VERSE TWO)
Now they hunting for me like they did Frankenstein
Gang of niggas
Like that Lynch Mob; Pogo sign
They got torches, rope, and ride pumps
I could either be a soldier
Or a quiet punk
But I ain't never been nothing but a Block Banger
Young Rider
Packing me a brain hanger
So don't side
Or it'll be another homocide
I like your glass house
Nigga, get your ass out
About to pass out
And shit your drawls
Cause I got that phat .44 caliber magnum pointed at your jaws
Got my hair in a afro puff
Cause I'm in a rage
I know you feel me baby
We on the same page
The 12-gauge will put you on your back
We'll get along better when you dead
Cause I'm a necropheliak
I'll peel your cap
Until your brain is showing
So I could see what the fuck you was thinking about
Cause evidently you ain't knowing
Can't nobody fuck with Raided
With this slow shit
So I'm going to have to labotimize you with the whole clip
To let you know that I'm the number one life taker
X-Raided seding motherfuckers to meet their maker
Everybody dies

[Chorus]

(THIRD VERSE)
I'm getting vicious late at night
Like Ebeniezer Scrooge
Dead homies coming back to tell me that to do
Paranormal activity
Like on Poltergeist
Or the invasions of the people that came to snatch your life
I can't explain it
And I really don't see no need to
Cause you could feel me if you drunk and off that weed too
Them little voices getting get in my head
Thinking its time to murder
So if you slipping
When I'm tripping
Then I'm going to have to serve you
I'm sicker than a nigga that spent his youth in Nam (Vietnam)
That's why my psych trying to make me take Synnacuam
But fuck being calm
I'd rather tear up shit
Let everybody know X-Raided Loc is in this bitch
I'm a nigga that you can't handle
And every night I see the frame of death
In the flame of a candle
Telling me to turn the nine on myself
But it ain't enough liquor on the store shelf
To get me drunk enough to contemplate a suicide
You or me
Who would I rather kill
You decide
But keep in mind
I'm the number one life taker
X-Raided
Sending y'all niggas to meet your maker

[Chorus]
