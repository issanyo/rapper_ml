Hey Dott Dogg...muthafucka was out there in them streets
Nigga did whatever it took to get in nigga
From the jackin', to the rappin', to the slangin' crack and...

First Verse:

X-Raided up in this bitch, bout to disrupt some shit
Ain't from the pound, but I'm still down to Kurupt some shit
Interrupt your shit, cuz I'm always in a rush to spit
Like an axe, when I rap, I splitter up your clique
You better relax, be a witness or a participant
Eddie Gaffin' laughin' at the CO, wonder where the Sergeants went
See we flow, but it's way more bigger than that
Ransom note, deliver the gats and all them wack ass tracks
So we slit his throat, it's malicious, but the game's vicious
And niggas know, we'll do anything that gains us riches
We quick to flow, but we just as quick to bark that heat
Start that beef and Dott Dogg will pause that heartbeat
We hard to beat, like Schwarzanegger in movies bout factual
Burning niggas like third degree
Critical surgery
When I'm mad, you hoes burglary, intrudin' your home
Stole everything like clepto includin' your dome
Left your ass chewed up, gaze blast, mid-section blew up
Bet you all five homicide detectives threw up
Suit up, in coca sacks then I smoke a bag
They make me get my focus back, then I choke the gat

Chorus:

When it came to gettin' that money I did whatever it took
Fuck dividin' the power, wanted every cranny and nook
Understand me nigga, my family is full of thugs and crooks
Kings and queens protected by knights, bishops, and rooks

Second Verse:

You better look into my eyes, can't you see the pain?
I'm tired of lies, bitches and niggas playin' games
This is my ghetto prayer, Lord can you hear me?
Protect my family from player haters, don't let 'em near me
No need to fear me, I'm only human
Pursuin' dreams for greenbacks with more schemes, than J.R. Ewing
I mean that sincerely
Love my alcohol and tetrahydracanebanol dearly
Consumin' twenty pounds yearly
Clearly I'm out for the cash, nothin' else in my vision
Takin' chances, makin' decisions that could keep me in prison
But circumstances keep demandin' me to break these laws
Writin' lyrics strong enough to, penetrate these walls
Dott Dogg,don't feel I'm guilty
As charged, I'm filthy really
Down for the cause, and I'm comin' raw til' they kill me feel me
With slugs to the dome, ain't no love so it's on
And if you ain't thuggin' with me nigga, then I'm thuggin' alone
I'm a ruggish bone like Bizzy, Wish, Krayzie, Layzie and Flesh
Art of War to the last breath, nigga ride to the death
We hardcore, Dott Dogg and Nefarious
Mad man, Black Market til' they bury us

Chorus (2x)

Third Verse:

I'm constricted on y'all ass like a python
I'm ready to spit some venom, turn this mic on
Run up in em
Checkin' them niggas like a chess board
Cuz they be hatin', what'cha think I sport a vest for?
Premeditatin'
Yes Lord I got my eye on'em
When they try to get me I'ma have a fat surprise for 'em
Got some advice for 'em
You better recognize, Raided ain't down for none of that bullshit
Got a full clip, and this man eater won't hesitate to pull it
And deliver the bullets to your chest like a mailman droppin' off letters
Fat hole in your sweater
Smash out with all your cheddar
Met a nigga that had much game, deeper than the abyss
Taught me such thangs as how to get fame and keepin' cash in my fist
Now I insist to get my scrilla scratch
How real is that?
And I'm quick to peel a niggas cap
Is you feelin' that?
Move swiftly when I see the cops, cuz I ain't scrillin'
Muthafuckas wanna see me drop, but I ain't willin'
You a pawn in my book
Busta market a hook
Saw the fear in your eyes the first time that I looked
I'ma treat y'all niggas like powdered cocaine it's time to get cooked
I'm Michael Jordan, you the average guard about to get shook
