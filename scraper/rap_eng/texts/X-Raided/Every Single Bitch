[Intro: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Fuck these hoes, it's the re-do, you know how we do
Every Single Bitch y'all
From the Psycho Active album, by my nigga X (Nefarious)
Bear nigga the flex, can't come nearious (biatch) (who is this?)

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
It's the muthafucken Lynch and I'm back on a X tracc
'Bout to tell you niggas how to keep a ho stack (what you do?)
What you got to do, ta have your bitch clockin
Just put her on skirt, (then what?) sit her on stock then fish-net stockins
Tight around thick jock, make it look good, to the normal nigga eye
That bitch'll make a killin even if she ain't fine (what?!)
Cuz a big ass and some titties is a gold mine, deuce-nine dollars
A nut, two nuts is 58, an extra 4 if want the ho to masturbate
A blow job is 24 bocks a hit
But it's worth she see the ho swallow the gooey shit
And when I come through she be comin to see daddy
Like a O.G., you know me, I'm sittin in the Caddy, kick back
Look at the ho like "Wow!"
Bitch your my slave, what should I make her do know?
You can't treat a bitch good, you know (no)
What good is a nigga who ain't slappin his ho
So peep, let 'em all know that you don't play
And every bitch gotta price to pay

That's real, you bitches, fuck hoes mayn
They got all off crack, tryin to make you scratch
That's realer than real, shots to that nigga Nefarious
He put down the original game, nigga just need to bring back some doe
Slow me, uh, productions

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Who's the ho? A bitch named {silence} was the trick
She gave up the poo-poo for not one cent
She didn't pay, fuck it I kept the ho
Every morning at 6 A.M. she was leavin out my window
The close homie probably hit 'em too
I thought I gave her fuck but she probably fucked the whole crew
I can't lie, I hella liked the bitch
But like X-Raided said: "Once a bitch, always a bitch"
So why try to change her?
I rather be by myslef, fuck a ho I strangle her
The only woman I respect
Is my muthafucken moma, disrespect I break yo neck
It's hella easy pullin hoes (hella easy pullin)
Half cuz I got game and half cuz I'm in the store
Dumb bitch you, you get's no play (24 street)
You got a price to pay, fa sho

Fuck these all muthafucken
Disease carrien
Muthafucken red pussy havin
Cuz it's been dug up, stretch up, phunky stupid ass, biatches
Set up bicthes, yaknowwhuti'msayin
Fuck 'em and leave 'em

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
That's that bitch givin up the cash
I know a ho, who would straight up jack yo ass
You might go to the mo-mo and get you some
Then you wakin in hella broke and feelin dumb
She made you cum then your ass went to sleep (then what hapend?)
Took your ki and out the doo' the ho creep
You got got by a sneeky ass bitch
Now she's kickin with a notha nigga, front you shit
You said the baby had you caught, that's what you said
But you thought she was sprung so you gave her the bread
It was all of the bitches plot
Big spider web, yo ass got caught
You went in her that night loc
Yeah, she said use the rubber, a big fucken
She got head, ate and paid quick
And all you got was a fat ass cheuqe to spend
See, niggas just love the bomb shit
Them bitches cry to make a nigga go for it
But not me, nigga I do it my way
Cuz every bitch got a price to pay, fa sho

Youknow, what I say, haha, them bitches got you stretched out...
