[X-Raided]

Y'all muthafuckas wanna go to war?
Nigga we'll give you war
Nigga this Black Market
Dott Dogg, show these niggas what it's like when we go to war

First Verse [Dott Dogg & X-Raided]:

[Dott Dogg]

You say you ready for war, so I'm about to take flight nigga
Dott Dogg, fuck all y'all I never liked niggas
Break mics quicker than Billy the Kid pulled triggas
Like Canibus I eat emcees til' I'm full nigga
I'm locin' up, leavin' you niggas broken up
Slit out your tongue, cut your throat, leave ya chokin' up
You smokin' up a gang of sherm got your brain fried
Toe to toe, head up nigga we the same size
Flows flow, fed up, tired and you talkin' shit
Preachin' with your wack style, what else?  Talkin' shit
Lookin' for your wack style against this Blocc shit
Battle me, get got with, like a Glock bitch
You must be dreamin', nights be wakin' up screamin'
I'm right there, your pall bearers, me, and five demons
I dare you Devil, test it and get your bubble peeled
Get sacked like a quarterback fuckin' with Stubblefield

[X-Raided]

You ever heard revenge?
Me and my nigga Dott Dogg on a murder binge
Shot 'em all, watch'em fall like we murder men
We do illegal shit like we never heard of sin
We ruin people with them fifty caliber Desert eags
When you see us comin' all y'all baller niggas best to leave
You best believe it's goin' down and you the next to bleed
Make some sound and catch some rounds til' that's guaranteed
We sharin' weed just the flammable shit
Turn your loc into an animal quick
Dott Dogg can we handle this shit?

[Dott Dogg]

That's affirmative nigga

[X-Raided]

So now we shermin' it nigga
Where the black and bloody glove?

[Dott Dogg]

We burnin' it nigga

[X-Raided]

You better be learnin' it nigga
Money burnin' it nigga
And if you ain't on that page, you better be turnin' it nigga
X-Raided loc, I ain't givin' a fuck about y'all clout
We're like them chariots to war
And there are plenty of scouts, we shout

Chorus [X-Raided & Dott Dogg]:

Take flight like stealth bombers in a war zone
You wanted funk my nigga?  So now the war's on
Late night I'm on a creep for a full chrome
Red light boom, will drive inside your dome
Take flight like stealth bombers in a war zone
You wanted funk my nigga?  So now the war's on
Late night I'm on a creep for a full chrome
Red light boom, will drive inside your dome

Second Verse [X-Raided & Dott Dogg]:

[Dott Dogg]

Fuckin' homegrown, I'm the Northern Cali green leaf
Split your dome with one hit, now you want peace?
Pit bull, well I can shake til' I good and leave
Clip full, got hollow tips BITCH swallow this
I'm sicker than aliens on Mars Attack
Act gat hollerin' at'cha with whoever got'cha back
Fact, non-fiction, sendin' my niggas on a rhyme mission
Your whole house, kids, and your baby Moms missin'
But still all you wanna run up on a murder Man
Got a reputation for bein' quick to hurt a man
No hesitatin', premeditatin' some cold shit
My designation, assassinatin' your whole clique

[X-Raided]

Yeah, yeah, open up the casket, nigga I ain't dead yet
Ash to ash, dust to dust, ain't been said yet
Had Dott Dogg fill the bulletholes stuck on bedrest
So I left you in the car with your brains on the headrest
Got that heart, Hannibal heart is all a nigga need
You doin' 100?  You  best to pick a quicker speed
You best to heed, every warning y'all niggas receive
Cuz in the morning, we comin' for all our enemies
Picture these, beg and plead for your life
But for my clip to squeeze, I look you dead in your eyes
Tell ya "Nigga Please"
Hit your liver then your kidneys
Got your boxers, full of bloody piss and feces
Look what it got you fuckin' with these Northern Cali G's
It's a disease, incurable sickness indeed
If you sleep I'ma creep, leave that pillow bloody red
Who got y'all?  X-Raided and Dott Dogg then I said:
