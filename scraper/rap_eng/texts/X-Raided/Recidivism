CDC
What they do?
(Bring em in and kick em out
Bring em in and kick em out
Bring em in
This is what it's like in prison bitch
Bring em in and kick em out
Bring em in and kick em out
Bring em in
So for once you get your sentence trick) x2

[Verse 1]

Let me tell you niggas the truth about livin in prison
Actually it's factually worse than niggas envision
Naturally you only understand what you witness
So I give you a 1st person account of conditions
Within the walls of the cells of the California Department of Corrections
Where men suffer broken hearts from neglection
Hard to respect a person and sympathize with a crook
But come inside and I'll provide you a look
Yeah
A crime was committed
You went to court and wasn't acquitted
Or took a deal plead guilty and was sentenced
Damn
Leave the county jail and go to the reception and be classified
Hope that you don't get sent to a prison where you have to ride
Northerners Southerns Bloods Crips and white boys
Fuck fightin you better learn how to make you a knife boy
Plus writin
Your attorney ain't helpin your cause
Cause he's a court-appointed public defendant helpin your cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

You get it over then go to the whole workout and get swole
Loose your mind and try to find it and get it under control
They give you shoes that hurt your feet like broke-ass bottles
Nothin to read but magazines and romance novels
You only hope your loved ones keep sendin you letters
But your girl probably leaved you thinkin she could do better
Cause the pain in her eyes and heart is piercin her soul
Like Lea Mex it's dark and it's high but it's deep and it's cold
You gotta depend on the states just to feed your face
Look at your reflection in the toilet water to see your face
No mirrors no tears no matter how many years
It appears they don't listen when you plead your case
Life in the hole
So what do you do
No morals no values
Do you study or screw
Drop out or stay on the main line fightin for a cause that ain't real
While they try gettin high off of drug deals

[Hook]

"I made my bed
But it's too hard to be laying in it
I'm fightin the drama
But for some reason I'm stayin in it
I'm writin to mama like can your son get a visit
I'm feelin a little depressed maybe you can tell me what is it
What you suggest"
Mama told me too pray
Said if not then my heart would rot and my shoulders would cave
Exercise my mind and body t'like a soldier til I'm old and I'm grey
Keep up my strength and my shoulders okay
So much weight on my chest
You keep writin these lyrics
Either be sad and depressed
Or get mad and be furious and have to calm down
Gotta be serious period
My name is Anerae Veshaughn Brown and this is my experience
The K-17737
When the day come and the reverend said I would see Heaven
I give up all the oxygen that I breathe in my chest
To be in a free world with my girl it's freedom or death
I builded up my strength physically mentally hopin that it'd last
Til I'm with my family and this is all in the past
It's all in my grasp
The ball in my fist
My heart in the palm of my hand
Tryna hold it until you can call me a man
Too hot the holy burnin flames only extinguished by love
Til then I'll be the king of the thugs
(Blocc Star) x8

[Outro]

So much weight on my chest
Writin these lyrics
My name is Anerae Veshaughn Brown and this is my experience
K-17737
It's freedom or death
