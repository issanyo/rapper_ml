Ain't got no love to sinnin
Ain't no love recieved
Fucc explainin
Nigga believe whatcha wanna believe
You've been decived I ain't dead yet
Ash to ash, dust to dust ain't been said yet
Fucc what you read nigga can't nobody touch me
You must be a playa hater trust me
They gon be yellin fucc me
Long as the world is spinnin
But I can't let it bother me
Quickly the most wanted
That's just how it got to be
Busta's be woofin but really don't what no funk
Self incriminatin
I'm eliminatin niggas is hatin niggas
Liquidatin niggas like car lots
I'm loccin up on them bustas
Like the fool in that movie warlocc
Motha fuccas don't bow down now
The king of Sac Rap Raided is bacc in town now

(chorus)

Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally unforgivin
All the times I committed sins
Misery never ends
Havin visions on the flames my soul gonna be burnin in
Turnin in my grave cuz I can't find piece
Everybody yellin X-Raided rest in grief
Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally (eternally)
Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally unforgivin


Call me murderer
Don't nobody know if it's true
Wanna see me dead
So call friends and enemies too
What can I do
Persecuted and hated tremendously
Prosecuted they tryin to give me a quater of a century
Nigga they mention me in the news
Always negative
What y'all know about me
To be steadily speakin of what I did
Y'all be speculatin
One day my bitch was in tears
She heard I got stabbed in the shower
And threw off the third year
But you ain't pumpin no fear
With those discietful conversations
Sayin you comin for me but nigga I'm still waitin
They datin you bustas like I'm some white out
Think you can see me
I can't be seen I'll cut your site out
Knoccin the fight out you motha fuccas
Like I'm Tyson in his hey day
You hollerin may day
But ain't no help for you it's pay day
Say what you wanna
But run up and be a gonna
By the most wanted motha fucca in Northern California


Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally unforgivin (eternally unforgivin)


You don't know me from Adam
But yellin fucc X-Raided
Got your fingers crossed
Hopin I get assassinated
But you procrastinated
You had a chance to get me
20 deep but ya'll niggas was still scared to hit me
Get me hotter than lava when I hear bitch niggas speakin
Gotta roll through Sac Town strapped down
To leave them bitch niggas leakin
Got you tweekin like Plusticy
Seekin bustas like missles
Ain't got no time for no hoes
Bitches is way to ficcle
Flippin she whippin to have your car hot like pretzels
Tellin your bitches fucc you hoes let's keep it sexual
I ain't got no time for you bacc stabbin two faceted vultures
Next time I see you I'm colt you consult you to smoke


(Talkin)
Based on the fact y'allniggas is hoez
(eternally unforgivin, eternally unforgivin)
Y'all steadily be speakin on a nigga
(eternally unforgivin)
Fucc y'all niggas
Fucc biatch


Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally unforgivin
All the times I committed sins
Misery never ends
Havin visions on the flames my soul gonna be burnin in
Turnin in my grave cuz I can't find piece
Everybody yellin X-Raided rest in grief
Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally unforgiven
Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally unforgivin
All the times I committed sins
Misery never ends
Havin visions on the flames my soul gonna be burnin in
Turnin in my grave cuz I can't find piece
Everybody yellin X-Raided rest in grief
Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally, eternally unforgiven
Eternally unforgivin, eternally unforgivin, eternally unforgivin
