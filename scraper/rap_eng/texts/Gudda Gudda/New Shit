[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Uh, flow gifted like the honor roll
In crunch time, I deliver like Domino's
A different freak for every day; I got all kind of hoes
I slide them dick and get the fuck, I never mind them hoes
But never mind them hoes, I got all kind of flows
I switch them up so quick as fuck, I got a timeless flow
Young Animal, punishing the ProTools
Eating this beat up like soul food, you niggas old news

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now ain’t you tired of seeing the same shit every day?
I mean the same shit, Ashley and Mary Kate
Sometimes I wish that I was blind like Mr. Ray
How come you talking out your ass but ain’t got shit to say?
I spend my money like my time; I ain’t got it to waste
Man, I'm so fast feel like I'm racing in a different race
Too much champagne, now watch me spit it in them bitches face
Tomorrow morning I could tell you how them bitches taste

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
This rap shit is our house, you niggas just visiting
Young Money Wolverines, bitch, no Michigan
I get in them hoes and reel them in like fishermen (leggo!)
And throw they ass in the truck and we rolls like Michelins
All hail the kings, crowns glistening
I stunt hard as a fuck cause I ain’t getting a chance to live again
Focus is what you better get, boy, we on that better shit
All bosses, no executives, you just repetitive

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now ain’t you tired of seeing the same shit every day?
I mean the same shit, Ashley and Mary Kate
Sometimes I wish that I was blind like Mr. Ray
How come you talking out your ass but ain’t got shit to say?
I spend my money like my time; I ain’t got it to waste
Man, I'm so fast feel like I'm racing in a different race
Too much champagne, now watch me spit it in them bitches face
Tomorrow morning I could tell you how them bitches taste

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Bitch, we balling
Tired of the same shit, I need a different toilet
Okay let me pick my target
Pick them off, now come pick them up
Big dog, I don't bark, I buck
Tell them bitches I don't talk, I fuck
Tell them niggas I don't walk, I run this shit
I come to punish shit
And I bet they won't be flushing this Young Money shit
We on some other shit, they on the same shit
Bitch, I'm Mack Maine; I'm Mack Maine, bitch!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Now ain’t you tired of seeing the same shit every day?
I mean the same shit, Ashley and Mary Kate
Sometimes I wish that I was blind like Mr. Ray
How come you talking out your ass and ain’t got shit to say?
Young Tune, motherfucker, no anime
Dr. Carter, motha-fucka, come to amputate
Cash Money, too much money to calculate
Young Money, that new shit in your face

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I spend my money like my time; I ain’t got it to waste
Man, I'm so fast, feel like I'm racing in a different race
Too much champagne, now watch me spit it in them bitches face
Tomorrow morning I could tell you how them bitches taste
Give me the beat and I'm-a beat the beat like anime
What the fuck you thought
You know I keep the heat like Saint Tropez
Cash Money, too much money to calculate
Young Money that new shit in your face
