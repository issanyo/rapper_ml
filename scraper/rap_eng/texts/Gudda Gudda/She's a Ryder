[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yup, yeahhh
She's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, for me
Now I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what you've been told
But all I know, all I know, all I know is that you been warned
About my girl - she's a killa, she's a killa, she's bad, she's bad, oh God
She's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder
And she rydin' for me, and she rydin' for me, and she rydin' for me
She's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder
And she rydin' for me, rydin' for me

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Ugh, yeah she a ryder like a lady in a wheelchair
Louise V. purse on her arm, she keep the steel there
She gon' hold me down if the feds come and get me
And I'mma make her fuck the judge for a lighter sentence

The devil wears Prada bitch, she rydin' for me, you don't want problems bitch
She about it, bitch, and she keep it real
And she owns two twin pumps like a pair of heels
No Nicole Richie, no Paris Hil', just my gangsta
Boy she'll spin you like a Ferris wheel

Takin' money and she bring it home to me, nigga
Yeah she's a ryder and she rydin' for me nigga

[Lil Wayne - Hook] x2
She's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder
And she rydin' for me, and she rydin' for me, she rydin' for me, rydin' for me
She's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder
And she rydin for me, rydin' for me, for me
Now I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what you've been told
But I know, but I know, oh I know that you been warned
About my girl - she's a killa, she's a killa, she's bad, she's bad, oh God

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shawty hold the work for me

Shawty never argued 'bout a bitch or nothin'
Shawty know she number one
Fuck them other bitch's number
Let them other bitches wonder

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I don't know, what you been told
But I know, that you've been warned
About my girl, about my girl, about my girl, about my girl
She's a ryder, she's a ryder
And she rydin' with me, and she rydin' with me
She's a ryder, yeah, yeahhh
Rydin' for me
Oh she's a ryder
And she's rydin' with me
Young Mullah baby
