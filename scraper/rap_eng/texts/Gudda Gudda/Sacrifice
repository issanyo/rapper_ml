[Intro - Mack Maine]
Yeah
Take this body to the project for a sacrifice (x2)
(Don't be scared now..)

[Verse 1 - Mack Maine]
I have you sweatin' so hard you need 3 or 4 towels
After that all I need is 3 or 4 showers
Just to get the blood off in 3 or 4 hours
Then come to your hood to get 3 or 4 cowards
You think your Bison like you play for Howard
But you can duck like Howard, I make you fall like the towers
I cut your arm off and tell you to reach
Then I cut your tongue off and I tell you to speak (nigga)
My niggas in the circle in the middle of the bonfire
They quick to become arsonists to set you on fire
The flesh start to smell but who gives a fuck?
Heaven or hell, nigga you need to pick one
Prrattt stick um now you become a victim
Now, you become a victim
Yeah, you become a victim
I'm evil like 3 6's, nigga, minus the mafia
Ain't no brakes on my shit nigga no stoppin uh
Young cannibal, cut ya like a cantalope
I mistreat bodies for breakfast, I eat bodies uh

[Hook - Shanell & (Mack Maine)]
You could smell fear in the distance spring
Karma, fearless
Come with us home, better witness them
Sa-cri-fice
(We could take your body to the project for a sacrifice (x2)
We could take your body to the valley for a sacrifice (x2))

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Its Weezy F. Crazy
You scary ass rappers on the beat I'm Wes Craven
But I'm eastside 'til I reside in the grave
And you come in my basement and see the bodies I'm savin'
Bloodbath flow yes it's time for some bathin'
Shotty wit' the drum and I'ma play it like a cadence
Invasion, I cook ya like the Asians
Put bread on ya head like a raisin
You a danish, you need glazin'
Pardon me man,but I'm cravin'
I got you in the oven but I'm waitin'
I'm patient, for my patient
Yeah, There's a meeting in my kitchen
Shhh, there's rappers sleeping in my kitchen
Young money creatures
Kill your sweet ass then eat you muthafucka

[Hook - Shanell & (Mack Maine)]

[Verse 3 - Gudda Gudda]
We take your body for a mothafuckin' sacrifice
See you in hell bitch meet me in the afterlife
Minivan, duct tape, knife in my hand
Nigga, knife to ya head, you my sacrificial lamb
Nigga, I can smell blood like a hound, I see dead people
Paint the scene, I'ma leave a bunch of red people
Saddam, I bomb, I'm insane, Hussein
Assault rifle with the drum, nigga, with the blue flame
Blood on my glove, while im burying the witness
Cut your limbs off, I'm on my Jeffrey Dahmer sick shit
For real I'm ill, we marching like the military
Coffins everywhere, this the rap cemetery
You niggas sweet, get ate like Ben N' Jerrys
You niggas very fairy
Tell frail better go and say your Hail Mary
Rocket launcher bitch, I'm a throw a Hail Mary
Young Gudda bitch
