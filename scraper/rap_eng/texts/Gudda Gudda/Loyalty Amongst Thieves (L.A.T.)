[Hook: Drop Boy Dell]
Ain't too many real niggas outchea left
And fake niggas come a dime a dozen
In this cold world man you gotta watch yo step
Can't even trust my own cousin

[Verse 1: Taliban Bundy]
Its Taliban motherfucka
These niggas can't keep it silent
They mad they won't play they position
I catch me a body in June and July
I make it back home and be straight before Christmas
I'm staright on these hoes, straight on these niggas that's hanging around me that stay in my business
I lay something down word get around
You going straight to first 48 on a nigga
These niggas be fake, faker than a Rollie that's ticking
You crossing that road you know that you chicken
The last nigga tried it you know what we did him
You can keep hatin' you know I'm that nigga
Yo bitch she young jockin' you know Ima hit her

[Verse: Drop Boy Dell]
These niggas ain't loyal

You know its money over bitches that's just how its gone go
But on a real when shit get real you know call on yo hoe

So ima just wait 'till I know that your dressed
And follow you to the highway then I shot you before you get time to confess
Man word on the street is the homie arrest

But ion won't judge him I really won't trust him
Goin fuck wit em 'till i find out if it stamped

Got cutters for the beef you can keep the fork
Man these niggas not loyal not even the hoes
Cuz they'll fuck yo homie just even the score
Could you hold a nigga down if I had to go jouce?
Would you keep the phone on and make sure I got stoke?
I know a lot niggas thought that it was over for Flow
Yeah nail in the coffin and murder she wrote
