[Verse 1 - Jae Millz]
Young Money...Harlem
Umm...I got one thing to say before I start this verse...LEGGO..haha
Feeling so good that I might run for mayor
So good I might buy a present for a hater
I just wanna slay her
You just want to savor
Well good come and get her, let me get back to my paper
Straight from harlem with the cellars and the shavers
To a high rise balcony way in the air
Stand on my own, so I don't need no favors
And the watch on my wrist dumber than any one of Flavor's
Cyclops watch the bitch beam lasers
And all my diamonds dancing Jr., Sammy Davis
Oh that's you girl, I make her scream see you later
Take her home and make her sing like Anita Baker
They all under estimated, but I made it
So Im waving from that young money flow while we parading
Yeah we the champs so every days a celebration
Ain't nobody do like this in ages
Not only are we young money, bitch we are the greatest
Catch me in some jordans before you catch me in some gators
No I'm not icy bitch I'm definetly a glacier
Certified N.Y. wife taker
Old school game like Walt, Clyde, Frazier
Pockets of money like an open pager
I grew up in an apartment but im a don acre

[Verse 2 - Tyga]
Mass murder every Tyga hater
And I ain't from Atlanta but the beat get dacatered
Eat the 808 bitches say they love my flavor
Cause I'm a yellow nigga, so I rep the lakers
Wilt Chamberlain, hoes in too many places
Player player shit, city's next to where they names is
Famous amos shit, want the cookies with the raisins
I play stages, no games no sages
Rap raging, move out my fucking way bitch
Are you asian, yup smartest in my age group
I'm fading, and I ain't even off nathan
So blatant, and half of these bitches basic
I'm on it, you faling off, Humpty Dumpty, in the yard I'm a fucking dog
Princess shit, write my name on a star
Skinny nigga dough, hoses slurping on my straw
Big boy though

[Verse 3 - Gudda Gudda]
Real fly nigga, bitches see me and they holla
My shades block the sunrays, Dolce and Gabana
Louis breifcase Louis rag I'm stylin
Credit cards in my Louis wallet when I'm going shoppin
This is young money, so the money ain't a problem
Got my daughter with me, if she want it them I'm going to cop it
All my kids, pearl and ryan, they get everything they want and
They just call daddy and I'll have it to them by the morning
I'm a young paid nigga, got it made nigga
Not bad, I quit school in the 9th grade nigga
Left my Momma house I was still an underaged nigga
I was like, fuck this shit, I gotta get paid nigga
Now it's 20-10 and we the hottest in the game
It's young money mention money when you say my name
They call me gudda gudda, double g it's all the same
Heroine flow, cocaine, put it in your vein...
