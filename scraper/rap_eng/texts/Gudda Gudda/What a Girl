She Was There For Tha Long Haul
If I Go To Jail She Bump One For Tha Phone Call
Tha Only One That Could Deal With Tha Mood Swings
Stubborn Nigga, She Adapt To How I Do Things
I Was Stressed Out, She Would Watch Me Write
She Said I Was Talented And I Would Be Aiight
You Kno Sometimes I Wind Up With Them Otha Bitches
But Thats Jus What They Are, Buncha 'Otha' Bitches
There's No Otha Misses That Compares To You
So Tha Seven Digits, Ima Share With You
Listen Love I Place Nothin Above You
Like A Star In Tha Heavens That Place Up Above
I Wonder If He Knos I'm Thee Only One Thats Gona Be There
Cause Thats What A Girls Suppose To Do
And When They All Turn There Back I'll Still Show Him I Care
Cause Thats What A Girls Suppose To Do
Look. Look, You More Like My Dawg, Girl You My Nigga
And You'll Ride With Me Before Any One These Niggas
Hey I Remember Tha Nights You Use To Cry Yourself to Sleep
When I'd Tell Ya I'll Be Gone In November
Then Fall Turns To Winter, Cold Nights Alone
You Would Call My Phone Tellin Me To Come Back Home
All Your Friends In Your Ear Sayin I Do This And I Do That
Man, This Shit Is So Wack
I Let It Go In One Ear And Straight Out Tha Other
Then You Call My Momma Cryin Girl You Straight Buggin
And Yet You Still Hold A Nigga Down And Let Me Know
What Goes Around Must Come Back Around
I Wonder If He Knos I'm Thee Only One Thats Gona Be There
Cause Thats What A Girls Suppose To Do
And When They All Turn There Back I'll Still Show Him I Care
Cause Thats What A Girls Suppose To Do
You Ain't My Girl, You My Homie
And I Kno You Tired Of Bein Lonely
And When I Come Home, You Put It On Me
Thats Why I Give You Anything You Ever Wanted
I'm Married To These Streets, And Married To These Beats
And You Don't Even Care As Long As You Got Me And I Got You
Your Front And Your Back, Don't Trip, Don't Slip
And Worry About All Tha Other Bullshit
Its Like Us Against Tha World, And You My Lady Girl
Make Me Put That Ring On Ya And Wife Ya Babygirl
I Said, Its Like Us Against Tha World, And You My Lady Girl
Make Me Put That Ring On Ya And Wife Ya Babygirl
I Wonder If He Knos I'm Thee Only One Thats Gona Be There
Cause Thats What A Girls Suppose To Do
And When They All Turn There Back I'll Still Show Him I Care
Cause Thats What A Girls Suppose To Do
