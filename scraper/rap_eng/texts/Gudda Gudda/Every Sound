[Hook]
Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel (Ah)
Tell me that I, I was wrong (Yeah)
I was born to let you go (I was Wrong)

[Verse 1]
Ah this shit ain't been the same since
I let you go and then since yall became tense
We had a burn that could spark any flame
Now I'm like Oran jones walking in the rain
We was too peas in a pod but not the same
You was feeling a thug and despised all lames
You was more for the love and despised all games
And I was more bout the bitches and piling them in the range
(Every Sound) that I hear is telling me I'm wrong
I couldn't say it in your face I'll say it in this song
I could say it million times that I played it wrong
Now I gotta spend my days alone, and um....

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Yeah let it burn let it burn-0, love can be hell in the heart of the Inferno
Teaching me a lesson but I still never learn
So I keep back tracking, move around in a circle
Now I'm hanging out in the club with no purpose
Wall in between us and i can't scratch the surface
I'm starting to feel worthless like was it really worth it
Fucked up so bad I wonder will we ever work it out
But it seems like a long shot my head hurtin' shit, you killin' me
Dome shots, thought that I was scheming but I stumbled on the wrong plot
I admit I did you wrong, ma and on

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Ah I live in dark days and bright nights
I know I've fallen, I'm tryin to turn my wrongs into rights
Ah but this shit gettin critical, it's crazy
Cause I know that I'm the reason why your miserable
I'm just a man baby doin' what a man does
No question I know your searching for the answers
Aahhah life is so unpredictable I never would of
Predicted I would of got rid of you ah
And I question that a reason
But shit don't just happen, shit happen for a reason
I shoulda kept it loyal it was more like a treason
I shoulda called you back wen you was leaving

[Hook x2]
