[Hook: Flow, (Kevin Gates) & (Gudda Gudda)]
Hustle all day and do the same thing tomorrow
I'm riding through New Orleans, but I'm headed to BR
Standing in the kitchen cooking 4 2 and the quarters
Cell phone ringing, gotta take another order
Get straight to the paper, get straight to the paper
Get straight to the paper, gotta get straight to the paper
Legend in my section, everybody know I'm balling
Try to brag about it, but money keep calling

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Riding in my whip, throwing e's out the window
If a nigga talking stupid, then I squeeze out the window
I'm a motherfucking rider, Glock 40 serve me
I let them dubs fly cheap, I'm a bird dealer
If you got paper, why you standing on the curve nigga
Treal boss shit, youngest moving on my word nigga
Slick talking get you punched in your dimples
Or he gonna learn the day when he get that pop to his temple
Gudda is the name, la t big dog, the gun throwing bullets like passes
Get picked off
Grinding is the motto, bad bitches follow
But we hustle all day and we do the same thing tomorrow

[Hook: Flow, (Kevin Gates) & (Gudda Gudda)]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Work, free lane motorolas is prepaid
Go hard in the paint, dishing the rock out like im d-Wayde
Messages getting relayed, everyday like a replay
Dice shooter gather round the table, I don't see lames
Food stamp card on the dresser, it's for Vanessa
I just hold it for the smokers who wanna stone off a credit
Trap method of preference, crack sellings a fetish
Thanking God for my wrist, my packs stretchin for extra
Extra we talking everything, taking extra precaution
Pray for faith when I'm walking, the law on the walkies-talkies
Consequences forget me, call the card for the lawyer
Hustle all day, do the same thing tomorrow

[Hook: Flow, (Kevin Gates) & (Gudda Gudda)]

[Verse 3: Flow]
Mister dope flow, every verse a quarter key
Yeah I pop a zam, bought it, pass the blunt a Mally G
My baby mama out the 3, I will make a slice you hold
And tell your boyfriend come get a verse while the price is low
Bitch, I be on that real shit, my gun the size of a skateboard
Make you heelflip, mister underscore, brazy flow hoes violent
I rap about drugs cause I be higher than the Ollie
Gudda pop the molly, I'm sipping with luca brasi
A 8 in the toop, that nigga be wailing
Phone call, I do this for my bloods my nigga
Loyalty amongst thieves, I love them niggas, pause
