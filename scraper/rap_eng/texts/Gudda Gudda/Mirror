[Tyga]:

Ooh look in the mirror
I see a f-cken star
Got your momma screaming
Ohh look in the mirror
I see a f-cken star
Got your momma screaming
For me, like I'm ElDebarge
Lookin at my skin
All green scars
Bitch I think I'm pac
Gold hair and bow (ahhh)
Let my Ralphs sag
Poppin purple tags
Show my face for cash
I'm a need a mask
For the love of money, I'll never love again
When you start to get it, bitch you'll understand
I'm holding my balls
Lettin them know I'm the man
The realer I get (the realer I get)
The faker they shakin' my hand
Medicine man
Sick of these roll
Playas stealin' my slang
Beast mode, K Perkins
In the muthaf-cken (muthaf-cken)
Brought my shank just in case
In the party if you pop off
See you starin, baby take yo top off
Man you niggas, man you niggas
Fuck yo knockoffs
I keep my girl Louis Vuitton with some goyard
That ain't real Audermar
That's an auto-fraud
Almost bought one, they told me 60 thou
I took my cash, spend it round town like Taz
Last king, young CEO, my nigga Jazz
Bitch it's rainin, duffle bag
It's opportune, let's make it fast
You goin' let it drip a little
Then I'm a make it splash
Box it in a doggy bag
I be hungry, later man
Man, I'm a f-cken king

Look what's on my f-cken chest
Startin' to smell like money in this bitch
Guess you know it's Young Money in this bitch
Tyga Tyga Gudda Gudda we in this bitch
Tyga Tyga Gudda Gudda yea he in this bitch

[Gudda Gudda:]
Bitch I'm on fire
Young Money rida'
Let the tool off for my nigga Tyga Tyga
Give em hell with the written spittin hot sauce
Treat your head like a fake purse, get knocked off
The coupe I take the top off
Woof, bitch, top dog
Lay yo girl face on my lap, let her play with my sack
Then the bitch get lock jaw
We on top like toupes
Hat to the back, with 2 braids
Weezy out in 2 days
Young Money (Dooms day)
We about to act up
Money I'm a stack up
Crack my safe burn 100 stacks, and then I crack up
I'm hittin' like a Mack truck
Gun make a bitch nigga back up
Stacks on deck
Hit a nigga on the neck
And the bitch nigga don't get back up
Young Gudda times 2, that the name, ho
Got a pot of gold like the end of the rainbow
You ain't a ballin' nigga what the fuck you came for
Oh you here with yo main ho
I'm leaving with that same ho
Gudda

Startin' to smell like money in this bitch
Guess you know it's Young Money in this bitch

Tyga Tyga Gudda Gudda yea he in this bitch
