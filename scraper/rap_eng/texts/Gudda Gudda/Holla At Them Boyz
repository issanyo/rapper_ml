[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
You see normally I wouldn't do this - but I'm gon' keep the party goin'!
The hottest Carter next to Shawn - the hottest flow next to homie
I give my highest respects to homie - What's good Hov' Baby? Holla atcha homie!
I holds it down for my territory
I bear the glory of the fellas neva get to know this
And when I jet through the 'jects - you can bet - all the niggas and chicks - gon' take flix
Cause they never seen the machine I lean in
I mean straight sick - the boy so clean and
All the lil' children up to chase my great whip!
I'm talkin bout the great Weezy Baby - splendid!
Heart-broken in a lotta spots - never mended!
I bought coke - opened up a spot - felt relentless
I was only twelve but the money made me twenty
Now it's only right for me to ride around on twenties
It's only life to ride around with the semi
Get outta bounce, I won't blow the whistle - I'mma blow the pistol - ya hear me?
Quit all the fouled play out - or I spray out
Ya'll rookies need to be like me - I'm fundamental like Timmy
But I can get flagrant like Kenyon!
I cannot'a hear any opinions bout my image
Man I'm the same playa from the finals to a scrimmage
I put the AK up to ya spinal and just whip it
It kinda burn, don't it sissy?
You know the kid just - pimpin - thuggin
Bandanered up like a old hippie - or sumtin
Canons up - I hope you start trippin - I love it!
I see no public - it's just you and your snakes and me and some niggas that love me!
See you could just hate - but me and these niggas is grubbin!
We at supper - it's mm-mm good fucka!
You try 'n touch it - it's boom-boom-brr-blucka!
You try 'n block us - you bette be Chris Tucker!
Cause this summer we gon' blow like dick-suckas!
And if ya flitch blitch catch a blow to ya dick-suckas...nicca!
*Faggot!*
You hear that clinch-clinch I lock the (???) to this shit, cussin'!
