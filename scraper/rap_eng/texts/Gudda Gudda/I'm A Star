[Intro]
D Rock, D Rock, D Rock

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Yesterday I was standin' on the block
We went through, a couple niggas got shot
We got away, had to hit it on the cops
Now today I'm a motherfuckin' star
Yesterday I was standin' on the block
We went through, a couple niggas got shot
We got away, had to hit it on the cops
Now today I'm a motherfucking star
I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star
I'm a star, I'm a motherfuckin' star
I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star
I'm a star, I'm a motherfucking star

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Glizzy Glizzy, I'm a motherfuckin' star
Ridin 'round with that fucking AR
Praying I don't have to pull this bitch apart
And send a bastard right to his fucking pa
What you write?
Bitch it's Glizzy gang over every God damn gang
Hey flow! Say he got the flame
We gonna go blow out his brains
Perfect aim! I'm convinced, don't need no God damn range
Menace to Society, I feel just like God damn Kane!

[Verse 2: Flow]
Holy shit, ran in the mix and almost pop my chain
I get higher than a staircase, rob a nigga bare face
If I ain't got my pistol, bitch, I gotta use my shank
You can send me to Angola, I would do my time with Frank
Like Glizzy said, free the gang, yep, all my niggas crooks
Trying to beat the case myself
I'm still gonna put some on your books
And buy all ya niggas Js, some retro number ones
Swap kicks under the table in the visitation room
Real nigga though, play pussy get fucked like a gigolo
All my niggas locked up long, snitch niggas pop at home
We got that audio dope, bitch take it or leave it
Fuck taxin' on bricks, bitch, we're taxin' on features

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Yesterday I was standin' on the block
We went through, a couple niggas got shot
We got away, had to hit it on the cops
Now today I'm a motherfuckin' star
Yesterday I was standin' on the block
We went through, a couple niggas got shot
We got away, had to hit it on the cops
Now today I'm a motherfucking star
I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star
I'm a star, I'm a motherfuckin' star
I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star
I'm a star, I'm a motherfucking star

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yes, I am a star, I said I am a star
Pull up in the hood in my new car and they in awe
Standing near the stove, bout to whip me up a brick
That's why I whip it, whip it, whip it 'til I whip another whip!
Glizzy gang and L.A.T, we do this for the streets
Same clothes for five days, I've been hustling all week
Have a thing for 12-5, 25 for the whole book
Full pot sitting under fire, that's how the stove look
Hit it with the fork, can I hit it with the .44?
And I hit it with the soda, watch me come back with a porsche
Youngest on the porch and they're looking for the narcs
I get money and I'm gone, definition of a boss

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Young Jefe
Yesterday I was standin' on the block
We went through, a couple niggas got shot
We got away, had to hit it on the cops
Now today I'm a motherfuckin' star
Yesterday I was standin' on the block
We went through, a couple niggas got shot
We got away, had to hit it on the cops
Now today I'm a motherfucking star
I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star
I'm a star, I'm a motherfuckin' star
I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star
I'm a star, I'm a motherfucking star
