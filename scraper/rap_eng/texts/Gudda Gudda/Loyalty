[Intro: Gudda Gudda]
L-A-T! Gudda!

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Ok, I'm shining, beaming, glossing
Big timing, stunting and flossing
Dangerous, approach with caution
If I sneeze, you in a coffin
Chasing paper, we do that often
Two bad bitches, thick like horses
Let 'em snort cocaine at a party
Leave 'em stiff like rigor mortis
Don't try to race, this car got horses
The pint we drink, it costs a mortgage
Flow so dope, man, you can't copy
You can't bite it, you can't forge it
I got bars with more in storage
Watch me blossom, watch me flourish
If you try to touch my porridge
You will feel my chucks like Norris
All my bitches think I'm gorgeous
Get a massage while I'm recording
Single like a dollar bill
I am a free man, call me Morgan
Come and slob on my knob like corn on the cob
Check in with me and go and do your job
Now lay in the bed and then give me head
I don't have to ask, I don't have to beg
Yeah, I'm bumping Three Six Mafia
In the Phantom of the Opera
Choppers from Yugoslavia
Bake niggas like tilapia
L.A.T., Young Money mafia
Try but it ain't no stopping us
Why? We back by popular demand
Quit baller-blocking us
Lord Gudda, praise a nigga
MOB, I'm brazy, nigga
Hard at work, I'm slaving, nigga
Yeah, surf's up, I'm wavy, nigga
Percocet and Adderall, man, I could walk on water
I got a son, his name Jaylen and he want all your daughters
I'm a landmine, got this by a landslide, I'm racing, nigga
Cruise control, I'm pacing nigga, turn around, I'm waving, nigga
Gudda!

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
There's a Glock clocked by my pantsline
Young dreadhead, throwing gang signs (What else?)
I got bands like it's band time
Posted up at granny house, trappin' off the landline
What's all that hootin' and hollerin'? I'm who bring the dollars in
Drop the top, it was botherin', now go let your mother in
The cocaine from Colombia, the chopper is sovereign
Got a house full of bricks, you can call it remodelin'
Bitch, grow up, it's only head if you swallowin'
Baby, get to geekin', get to geekin' and gobblin'
Your friends think I'm bad, they must be looking for trouble then
It's a foam party, I be bustin' they bubbles then
Then I hop in the whip, make a play on some bricks
My homies say pull up, we just came up on a lick
I'm in the ends with the sticks, it's the revenge of the Crips
Hoe, you know it's OHB, I brought the gang in this bitch

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Hoe, you know it's LAT, we almost famous, lil bitch
On our toes and on our feet like Usher Raymond, lil bitch
And you know Lil Wayne is the shit and you straining to shit
Fat head, long neck she 'bout to strangle this dick
I got more bang bang in a stick than butane in a bic
I got my whole gang gang in this bitch and you came with a bitch
I got more purple rain than Prince and more cocaine than Mitch
I got more shit and piss and make more money than cents (sense)
She got more hips than tits, she got more tricks than tips
She put my name on her tongue and then she licks her lips
LW, Lil Wayne, to them, to her, that's length and width
Kill you for me, she will like Jada Pinkett Smith
It's the return of the Blood, 'bout to turn up and thug
We wan' know who got the chicken and show the colonel the gun
Man, my dirty-ass stripper take a bath in ones
Make her milk these fuckin' niggas like some Cap'n Crunch
Motherfuckers try to test me, I ain't cram for one
All these fuckin' karats on me, bitch, I'm Rabbit son
Happy birthday, I already got the gift of gab at one
Motherfuckers run they mouth until they cramp they tongue
Play pussy, get fucked; play ass, get stuck
Playtime is over, that ass is grass and now that grass get cut
Duct tape and we quackin' up then beat 'em with more bats
Than a vampires and Draculas, ashes to ashes to dust
Buried just for staring, yellow tape like canaries
We all bite and no talk, my sharks breaking your aquarium
Out of the ordinaries and went to the art of hustling
When you see them thieves coming
Know that loyalty's amongst them
L.A.T.!
