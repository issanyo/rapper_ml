[Intro: Lil Chuckee]
Boy when we catch you it's over with
Even Stunna can't save you on this one

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, I'm a show these girls how to pick 'em
Get 'em and then trick 'em
An then burr stick 'em
See im the Mistress, he the president
His name Lil Wayne, but that's irrelavent
Yo Millz I'm a grab that lil nigga by the dreadlocks
Kick in the door, break the chains, and the deadlock

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Yo I been hittin' his phone, and still can't get him
I know he ain't missin', probably just hidden
Somewhere in the multi million dollar, condo
And I'mma put his life in the GPS pronto
I got a call from The Mistress
Then I hit Gudda with the quickness

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yo whats poppin ain't nothing on my end
This nigga hard to find, like Bin Laden
I'mma put him in the trunk, since he like hidin'
Tie the nigga up make him comfy inside it
Me and Lil Chuckee still ridin', lurkin'

[Lil Chuckee]
Axe in the truck when we find him its curtains

[Gudda Gudda]
Yea thats for certain
He better run upstate, or he gon' gagged tied up and duct tape

[Verse 4: Lil Twist]
Sittin' on the block and im so insane
Tryna find Lil Wayne I even called Mack Maine
But no answer no ring and no Wayne
And now im just confused like a pimp without a cane
So I called Lil Chuckee, I said dog where you at

[Lil Chuckee]
Im tryna reach Weezy homeboy call back

[Lil Twist]
So I took 30 minutes out of my time and day
Tryna reach the president but it ain't goin' my way

[Verse 5: Lil Chuckee]
Im on the scope lookin' for this busta named Wayne
When I catch him no softness, man its chain gang
I been around too long, I know he got money
He probably on a jet, flying to another country
Or matter fact he probably chillin' in Miami
Wit Reginae and them, chillin' with the family
Get up in the six it go err, make it skate
After this commercial break

[Verse 6: Lil Twist]
When I find this guy, man I swear that its over
I'mma put his dread head under the rover
Shh homeboy im it, and I'mma take the maybach and mr g high sticks
Now back to you
I'mma do what it do fool
Paint the Buggati blue boy that'll hurt you all of sudden I started hushin' and huffin' huffiin' and puffin'
Wait a minute get em Nicki let's get it

[Verse 7: Nicki Minaj]
I'm a grab him by the waist and give him some good face
Then tie him up while I run up in the safe
Styrofoam cups, everything is getting gat
I make my niggas tattoo Nicki on his back
Yo Gudda get the chainsaw in case we see him
Let that little nigga know he gotta pay per diem
Cause Wayne think he ill since he copped that Bugatti
Runnin' round with baby he be stuntin' like his daddy

[Verse 8: Jae Millz]
Nick I overstand it in other words copy copy
In heinsight I want his DB9 and his mazarati
He slick and he cocky but he gon' get sloppy
When we come across him I'mma kimbo slice his body
Dwayne Carter Whereabouts is a must get
We all on the label we ain't turning to the suspects

[Lil Twist]
Good cuz I ain't trynna do no jail time

[Jae Millz]
Don't worry bout' it Twist yo alibi gon' be the same as mine
And Nicki's and Gudda's and Chuckee's
We might even get the black card and the pen if we lucky

[Verse 9: Gudda Gudda]
This nigga running out of time and I'm running out of patience
Time is money and his life we might pay with
Probably in the studio thats his rest haven
Horror show when we meet im west craven
I'mma drag the nigga to Houston
And straight flip strip down the maybach and sit it on his bricks
Snatch him then slap him hold him in his mansion
And call transpo
We need a million for his ransom

[Verse 10: Lil Chuckee]
Hold it up Gudda, he got me throwed
Cause I just missed him, he was in the grove
Now he downtown, in the second lounge
Posted up stuntin', all in the line
But then he spotted me, tied to break it down
Then I took him down, the advantage of being young
Run up to the grove, drag him to river
Everybody hurry up, I got this nigga
