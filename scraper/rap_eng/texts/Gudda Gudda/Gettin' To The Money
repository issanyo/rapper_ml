[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
Okay I wake up In the morning brush my teeth and count the money
Stack up all the hundreds, let my b**ch get all the twenties
FBI watching and I really think it's funny
B**ch I don't know where I'm going but I'm getting to the money
B**ch I'm getting to the money. I'm getting to the money. B**ch I'm getting to the money get getting to the money
B**ch I'm getting to the money. gettin to the money
Bitch im gettin to the money, the money getting to me

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
I bake the cookie
Shape the cookie
Cook it proper, I'm the cookie monster
My mama screaming
She said you tripping nigga, cause I use the same  she use to cook the dinner
A hundred degrees outside, my wrist is winter
Feather ram, when i whip it, i am no beginner
Fuck a bank account, the money...i gotta hide it
Cause if the feds had a clue, i woulda been indicted
Its money over bullshit nigga
And you can not bullshit a bullshitter nigga
Im countin all the money til my hands get the paper cuts
I see you hatin but....i got my paper up

[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
Okay I wake up In the morning brush my teeth and count the money
Stack up all the hundreds, let my b**ch get all the twenties
FBI watching and I really think it's funny
B**ch I don't know where I'm going but I'm getting to the money
B**ch I'm getting to the money. I'm getting to the money. B**ch I'm getting to the money get getting to the money
B**ch I'm getting to the money. gettin to the money
Bitch im gettin to the money, the money getting to me

[Verse 2: Tity Boi]

[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
Okay I wake up In the morning brush my teeth and count the money
Stack up all the hundreds, let my b**ch get all the twenties
FBI watching and I really think it's funny
B**ch I don't know where I'm going but I'm getting to the money
B**ch I'm getting to the money. I'm getting to the money. B**ch I'm getting to the money get getting to the money
B**ch I'm getting to the money. gettin to the money
Bitch im gettin to the money, the money getting to me

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
So i got a phone call from my nigga up in jail
He said he need some money and some flicks sent in the mail
So i hopped up out the bed, didn't turn my swagger on
I just hopped up in my whip then i dropped my package off
I am gettin to the money , the money getting to me
And i will die before im broke, thats just the way it gotta be
Its 5:30 in the morning and the cluckas still comin
The task force circlin, the block still jumpin
Pocket full of money, in my sock i got a onion
Them people come back round here, i ain't talkin im just runnin
Central bookin? no...see that fence, im gon be jumpin
Then lay low by a bitch and get some head then count the money

[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
Okay I wake up In the morning brush my teeth and count the money
Stack up all the hundreds, let my b**ch get all the twenties
FBI watching and I really think it's funny
B**ch I don't know where I'm going but I'm getting to the money
B**ch I'm getting to the money. I'm getting to the money. B**ch I'm getting to the money get getting to the money
B**ch I'm getting to the money. gettin to the money
Bitch im gettin to the money, the money getting to me
