[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement
And a breeze turn to blazes

[Verse 1 - Gudda Gudda]
I’mma tell these niggas: “motherfuck the world”
On the real, nigga feel this
Punch a hole in the system like I got a steel fist
I don’t trust a soul nigga, so I ride alone
And I’ve been paranoid ever since I got a phone
Yeah, better roll or get rolled over
You too cool nigga? You could get the cold shoulder
I’m from the city where the skinny niggas die
Ride, I survived and I made it out alive
And they wonder why my face look blank
Cause I don’t give a fuck about what they say or think
Uh, nigga you see me with that face wall paint
Come on, pick your poison in the spray of a shake
Militant minded, the way Gudda think
You could meet the devil, better pray for the saints
Militant minded, the way Gudda think
Nigga you could meet the devil…

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
So where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
I blow the flame out, the world is dark now
And everybody need their spark now
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement
And a breeze turn to blazes

[Verse 2 - Gudda Gudda]
Starin’ at the world through my rear view
Gotta stay high just so I can keep a clear view
Tryna do right, but I’m swervin’ in the left lane
Tryna stay out of that black hole, watch my step man
They say money is the root of all evil
And we love it, so I guess me and you are all equal
Shit ain’t been the same since Hurricane Katrina
Ike and Rita, what happened with the FEMA?
Government officials not keeping it official
Like a ref with no whistle, so I’m tackling the issues
And they wonder why we act the way we act
Murder, murder, steal, steal, and sell crack to get stacks, but…

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
And I’mma just sit back laughing
And when I tried to kick that habit
Man I was like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
This whole world is aware of my actions
But they ain’t that bad compared to taxes
Ashes, all I see is ashes
As the world burns

[Verse 4 - Mack Maine]
I’m a young arsonist on my late night Johnny Carson shit
I ain’t never gave a fuck about the world
Cause they don’t give a fuck about me, or my girl
Or my mama, in the midst of the drama, ya digg?
They try to pull you all the way back to get ahead of you
Then Internal Revenue gon’ come for your revenue
Sayin’ that you owe 33% of what you make
When the world die, I’mma be rejoicing at the wake

[Bridge - Shanell]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
So where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
I blow the flame out, the world is dark now
And everybody need their spark now
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes
