[Hook: Tyga]
All day long
Do it like Tony
Fuck her friend
Then I pass her to the big homie
Got a sign on my dick
Bad bitches only
Got a sign on my dick
Bad bitches only
Big bank roll
Do it like Tony
Fuck her friend
Then I pass her to the big homie
Got a sign on my dick
Bad bitches only
Got a sign on my dick
Bad bitches only

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Well it's that nigga you call T-raw
Runnin' that money like Madoff
Yeah she gave that blowjob
Then she gettin' laid off
I ain't got no time ho
Stop blowin' up my cell phone
Sweatin' me like headband
Call that bitch Rondo
I'm fresher than the prom ho
Teach her, we don't fly coach
She fuckin' but she act dumb
Kick her out my condo
Real G's, Last King, Young Money ballin'
I give her a couple of shots and then she turned an alcoholic
Methaphorically I'm a toilet
And I'm shittin' on your foreheads
2 girls 1 cup
Yup
We did it again Last King, YMCMB
I don't pay for bitches
Bitches pay me uhh

[Hook: Tyga]

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Knock knock
Who the fuck is there?
Sign on my dick that say
Bad bitches come in here
Make a freak whore, detour
Straight to my partner room and let him beat it like a keyboard
All I do is dick em'
I don't tip em' like a stripper
Man I gotta' ton of chicks under my belt
Like a zipper
Yeah
Walk up in the club
Pick em' out and then I pick em' off
Pick em' up and knock em' down
And then I drop em' off
I'mma dog
Keep you girl from around my type
Or she'll be milkbox material
And missin' for the night
Man this shit is just that easy
When yo' pockets sittin' right
I turn my bed into a stage
And let yo' bitch rock on my mic

[Hook: Tyga]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
First I check my Rolley
Then say "watch me do it"
Watch me do it, show you how to cook like Martha Stewart
I want some cheesecake I have you walkin' to it
Plus I stack my money tall don't you walk in to it
Just do it all I do is smoke jet fluid
Fuck her with my chain on so my charm can hit her booty
Outrageous with the Louis I'm a fashionaire
Ever since 16 I been a fuckin' thousandaire
They know me by my nickname in the dealership
And all my shows are funeral homes I keep killin' shit
You used to get money so you reminisce
And if yo' bitch get with this she'll get benefits
