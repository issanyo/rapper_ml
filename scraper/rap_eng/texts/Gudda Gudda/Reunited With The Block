[Verse 1]
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Yeah I’m back to the thugging, man, I’m keepin it hood
I don’t know no other way, anything else not real
Mano ill affiliated, man you know what it is
I go hard, so you know I strap with that still
If a nigga get wrong, bet his ass get killed
Man I did some jail time, a couple of years
Now it’s time for me to shine, I get a couple of mills
Take my niggas with me to the top, that’s how I rock, puff
I take my dope habit, no more shots cause
No more wanting ones, I’m talking brown and white
Yeah that was many nights, I went on pented flights
Now I got plenty ice, my pockets super big
I hit a lick and maxed out, now I’m super rich
They call me superman, cause I fuck with superchicks
No kryptonite, straight raw, that whole 36

[Hook]
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Be on the watch, there’s a gorilla in the hood
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Be on the watch, there’s a gorilla in the hood
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Be on the watch, there’s a gorilla in the hood
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Be on the watch, there’s a gorilla in the hood

[Verse 2]
Reunited with the block, yeah, doing my thing
My nigga Tibby just got home and he be doing the same
I got a scope on the riffle, I don’t miss when I aim
Use the thing, click-clack, one shot, let it blast
Gudda times two, that’s the name I was given
I ain’t trippin, I’m just grippin on this world I am living
All my niggers sad tripping and we rob if you ain’t given
My bitch into your bank account, I’m talking rob and give, man
Ain’t nothing changed but the date and the time
Money in my pocket and I’m still on my ground
Dope face coming, I charge him like a rhyno
Text for the action, man, I do it for survival

[Hook]
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Be on the watch, there’s a gorilla in the hood
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Be on the watch, there’s a gorilla in the hood
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Be on the watch, there’s a gorilla in the hood
Reunited with the block and it feels so good
Be on the watch, there’s a gorilla in the hood
