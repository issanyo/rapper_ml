[Hook: Kid Ink]
Everybody follow me back home
It's a after party full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
Follow me, back home
It's a after party full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Cause I'm tryna keep it on the low girl
Breezy, and I'm living in a cold world
Tryna get in, gotta know the code word
And I'll take one, but girl you gotta go first
Whole room moving like a lava lamp
Club full of bad girls, no oxygen
And you know it's going down, Nasdaq
Kobe on the blunt, you gotta pass that
We don't smoke those, you can ash that
I'm in the bathroom hiding from Kat Stacks
Drove here, but I'mma need a cab back
I got my money right, since you comparing that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I got they hands up, like a classroom
Can't see me like I got a mask on
Girls straight off the cover of Maxim
It's snow bunnies here, like we in Alaska
White girls, dyke girls
And she told you that she don't even like girls
Lying ass, I make that kitty purr
Since you can bring it back, go on hit reverse
It ain't no grenades, land mines
Gotta blend in, camouflage
You tripping girl, this ain't a Altoid
But it got me feeling like a cocaine cowboy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, money on my mind, what the fuck should I be thinking 'bout?
Purple drank and two Styrofoams is what I'm drinking out
The party's popping, as well as pills, I'm geeked bitch
The whole damn party's outta control, I'm in the bathroom with a freak bitch
Gudda ho, yeah that's my name, don't look at me, look at my chain
Walk in the party, shut down the party then pile the hoes in the black Range
All black tires, I'm the Batman
In the Batmobile, doors up, bat wings
I get a lot of money, what are you doing?
The hoes think I'm crazy, couple screws loose and
I party hard, we ain't sleeping 'til next afternoon
So follow me and swallow me it's a party in the bathroom
