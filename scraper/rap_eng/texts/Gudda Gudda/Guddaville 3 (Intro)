[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
I'm always up, man, I'm hardly ever sleeping
Because I'm living now all the things I ever dreamed about
They're sleeping on me like a mattress
So I stripe 'em like matches, let 'em burn like ashes
I define fire, verses I spit getting me all that I desire
If purple my cup, purple my dodge, getting me higher
The game changes, I still remain dog
Wear chop tees in the hip hop, same color
Wayne, nigga, why do worry about the next man?
Cause while you're writing these records I'm writing a check, man
So all you pussies jump off my dick
Before I pull that Glock40 and come off that click

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
No movies, it's all action, yeah, I talk that shit
But where I'm from, when you talk you gotta walk that shit
What you know about lighting the stove, the water boiling up
Dropping world cold with the soda cooking the boarder up
Ain't nothing changed but the date
I'm sorry for the waiting, but I had to strategize for the ways
I'm in the circles around niggas, I got the feel it was dinner time
Then part two and I was almost at the finish line
I took a break, now I'm back, Guddaville 3
I could cut your hands off, I bet you still feel me
Still hear back in the days and the Squad mixtape,
Just a light smart and shop on my mixtape
I'm way harder than y'all rappers, all actors
Gone store, popping like five crackers, that's y'all asses
Hold passes, I ain't miss you enough
Cause these principles we're living by, I'm kicking you out

Guddaville 3, I bet these motherfuckers feel me
Gotta feel good, I bet these motherfuckers feel me
