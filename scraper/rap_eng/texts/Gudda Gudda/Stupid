[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]

OK, let me talk about money, let me talk about right,
Hammer cock back cause these niggas be fronting
Like trash I be dumping, niggas talking reckless on the record when I see them
And it ain't about nothing.
East side coming, west opponent, I walk down on your girl, make her want it
Make her suck dick till she vomit
Man, I promise I'm a shoot off in her mouth like a condom
Niggas don't want it, murder my opponents
Hoe bitch shit I never with the Donnie
I'm living for my life I live it for the moment
Pop one, pop 2, now a nigga straight zoning
Walking up the block with my hand on the heater
Other hand gripping on a bad senorita
They say the flow cold, I say I got a fever
Treat the beat like a bad bitch, I'm a beat it
Pop it and leave it, left hook, right hook, jab I defeat it,
Wall my cometa, don't fuck with stank hoes, only fuck beavers
Black or the red bones, I don't fuck sneezers
Niggas talk stupid, I'm a mute and delete them
Mutilate a nigga then I move out the reason
Half black half Puertorican, long hair, don't care, fresher than a deacon

[Hook: Flow]

I go stupid, stupid, dumb, ham
I go stupid, stupid, dumb, ham

[Verse 2: Flow]

Machiaveli, illuminati, I'm high as fuck,
Who can find me, my weed strong, do Pilates
Do a drive by, up in 2 Bugatti
I ain't tripping, no roots behind me, fuck around, you can lose your mind, me
All my niggas got iPhones, if I can't find you, I'm using Siri, bow
Just got a truly from Gudda, I'm so raw, I should really use a rubber
Kill you, they find you, banana up your ass, so 40 motherfucker
Gudda, what they gonn do with a nigga, I'm a fuck around and kill 2 of these niggas.
L.A. clippers, like Blake Griffin, I'm throw a bomb, let it boom on them niggas
Light the blunt, hit the kush, dumb ass hoes get beat with books
Run up, kill your part, and your bitch ass didn't even look
I'm Young Money, come rob me, got a rear flag like YG
Run upon me, 2 letters pow, ow, I.V.
I'm a smoke this whole 7 then go skateboard at Erin
Bitch I'm harder than the devil my name should be Devin.
Loyalty amongst thieves, L.A.T
And don't blame me, I got these zam balls from Derrick.

[Hook: Flow]

I go stupid, stupid, dumb, ham
I go stupid, stupid, dumb, ham
I go stupid, stupid, dumb, ham
I go stupid, stupid, dumb, ham.
