This is the archetypal rock sound

[Lil Wayne]
Ok this really ain't no rock shit
But um, let go
Hollygrove monster, New Orleans maniac
Shoot a nigga up until his whole body ain't attached

Hi, my name is best rapper alive
And your mouth is the best crapper alive
Cause you talk shit, I get hit and walk it off
Like fuck that, then I just spit like barking dogs
Call it "bust back"
Attitude like "fuck em all"
And I'm greasy
And your boyfriend is a butterball
What's geezy?
I mean what's good? Bitch is you blind?
Check my watch, bet it be money all the time
Sunny on the side where I stay at
Where M.I.A. at
I get pussy every time I say that
In the game room, I don't play that
Bitch nigga get laid down where he lay at
AK at your front door, Young Zoe
You can ask Brisco
Shoot til my wrist sore
Coupe with a bitch low
Who put the slick pull
I'm tired of the south
So in your mouth is where the dick go

They like it when I say yeah huh?
And your boyfriend's a tampon
And I don't own land baby
I own a landmine
So step on my land and catch a bomb like Anquan
Weezy F and the 'F' is for franchise
You looking at me is like you're looking through ant eyes
Young Money can't die
Bitch, we like Hancock
Yeah, I'm a Martian; what you saying, Spock?
I turn your beef into a ham hock
Then I put it in a pan pot
Shoot 'til my hand hot
I can't hear you saying stop
I hear nina saying "pop"
I hear choppers saying "chop"
I hear niggas screaming and shit
Like I said "holla at ya boy, bitch"
But holla at ya boy bitch
I'm the boy bitch
Not ya boy bitch
Cause ya boy a bitch

Yeah
Young Moola Crazy

[Gudda Gudda]
Eastside Loco
You're sweet like cocoa
And you can get your ass beat fast like go-go
Mask on my face, low pro that a no show
Shoot a rapper when his album drop give 'em promo
You clown like bozo
They ask him bout the group shit
It's time to get the loot bitch I had to go solo
Your bitch all on me, you better watch your ho though
She wanna come kick it like a dojo, uh-oh
Slick nigga fuck 'em then I drop 'em like a low low
Bitch want money like mils no, no-no
Nigga if you hating suck a dick no homo
Boy I keep it gutter like bo-bos
Yeah I'm doing what I do so nigga just do you
And my gun nicknamed menage, she do two
Nigga welcome to the Young Money age zoo crew
We starving and you could get ate like zoo-zoos

Niggas boo-hoo cry motherfucker I'm heartless
I'll break bones and cartilage
You are just a mark muthafucker
I'm a marksman
And I'm all about the green like Boston
Pardon me, nigga, I'm talking reckless
You walk into a gun fight
Knife, no vest, bitch you crazy
Just like the ice you wearing your Fugaze
Put 'em in the dirt
Make 'em push a few daisies
80's baby, soon to be rich nigga
King Kong beating on my chest, on you bitch niggas
Paper I'm after
So I'm on your ass now
Young Money: motherfucking cash cow
