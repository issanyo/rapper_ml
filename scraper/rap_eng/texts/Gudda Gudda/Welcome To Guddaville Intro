[Verse 1]
Strive to be a winner losing not an option
Running to the finish line and no I'm not stopping
Women can be ya downfall and friends can be a problem
Watch your steps when you walking cuz believe them streets is watchin'
Evil thieves plotting on how they can take yo profit
And you can get a price on yo head behind gossip
I can spot a fake nigga off eye contact alone
These niggas frail no spine in they back at all
I hear 'em whispering, snakes still slithering
A one way ticket to hell is what I deliver them
I got a sweet deal with me connect out in Michigan
I can't say much cuz I know them people listening
Switch up my hustle, its all about the rap now
Doors getting kicked in, phones getting tapped now
I got some niggas that ain't coming home for a while so I shout they name in a verse just to make them smile
What up Big Li, you comin' home soon
Son, Rome, and Rick you comin' home too
So ima hold it down 'til that day come homie
This the shit I spit for my day one homies
It ain't an easy task, I'm starting to feel the pressure
Momma told me, "son don't let the industry stress ya"
Now I'm writing every rap like its my last one
Ventin' on the beat with a motherfuckin' passion
Yes I'm on a cash run
Gotta get paid so I'm treat everyday like its my motherfuckin' last one
Cup full of lean, they tell me I should quit it
And what I tell them back," mind they fucking business"
History in the making I'm about to kill it
I won't stop 'till I get God as my witness
Been in the game for a minute, I'm on my hustle still
I keep it Gudda still
