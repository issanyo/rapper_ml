When I'm alone in my room
I sit and stare at the wall
Brother can't find no love at all
I'm gonna find you girl someway, somehow
I need you right now!
Search the world, but couldn't find that feeling
Cause your love is a one in a million
Cause I like the way that you (Touch me)
And I like the way you (Fuck me)
And you really make it (Worth my while)
I said Woof, Woof, Woof, Woof, (Doggy style)
Cause you're on my mind, on my thoughts
Let me see your body talk
I'm makin love on a whole 'nother level
Have you ever danced with the Devil?
When I'm around you I feel like this
A kiss is just a kiss

(Chorus)
(girl) Baby, baby!
(kilo) Oh, work it on me
(girl) Baby, bab!y
(kilo) I need your L-O-V-E
(girl) Baby, baby!
(kilo) Baby, baby!
(girl) Baby, baby!
(kilo) And I want you to know that

Cause I'm a lover, niggas talk shit
I wish them punks would get up off my dick
Cause they try me, and they push me
I'm fuckin these niggas like pussy
But a nigga ain't gay
I said uh UH UH, it's your birthday
Same ho talk about I'm a busta
Yeah, I fucked her
I rocked her world
I Said she use to be, use to be my girl
For just one night, I said uh that face wa tight
She said I think I'm Stevie Wonder
Well I'd like to thank your momma
When I'm around you I feel like this
A kiss is just a kiss

(chorus)

Well, you can blame it on the lover in me
The heavy weight cut of the champion Ali
And in the hood I'm a menace
Hold on, sit down, let me talk, let me finish
I get that ass
Keep the camera rollin, I'm kinda fast
Get all the girls, and I shock the world
Why'd Humpty Dumpty have to fall?
Cause he was freakin off the wall
And it be like that
When you be trying, to break that back
I give my number to the ladies
Cause I would love to love you baby
When I'm around you I feel like this
A kiss is just a kiss

(chorus) 2x
