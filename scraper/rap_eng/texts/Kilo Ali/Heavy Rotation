Turn it up [x11]

I don't want anybody to know
How much my body craves you
Everytime I come around
I know you got people over chilling on your sofa
I love watching you watch the game when its over
I hope that you're thinking the same
So what it do?

I'm trying to have a private party in your room
I'm feeling kinda naughty, how about you? (Break it down)
Turn the bed into a dancefloor, just lock your door, put on your radio
Now turn the music up

Turn it up [x4]
I don't want them to hear what we're doing, so just
Turn it up [x4]
I be screaming so loud, don't you dare turn it down
Turn it up [x4]
Baby you can put it on me to your favorite song
Turn it up [x4]
Get that heavy rotation all night long

All night long
Heavy rotation all night long
All night long [Repeat]

I don't normally do this
But I'm breaking all the rules tonight
It feels so right
Everytime I come around you
I know people are outside our door
I wanna be loud, baby you gon' make me bring it out
So what it do?

We gon sound like a party, in your room
I'm feeling kinda naughty, how about you? (Break it down)
Turn the bed into a dancefloor, just lock your door, put on your radio
Now turn the music up

Turn it up [x4]
I don't want them to hear what we're doing, so just
Turn it up [x4]
I be screaming so loud, don't you dare turn it down
Turn it up [x4]
Baby you can put it on me to your favorite song
Turn it up [x4]
Get that heavy rotation all night long

So turn it up
Baby, baby
I know you want me
Baby, baby
I need your L.O.V.E
Baby, baby
So baby work it on me
Baby, baby
On me, yeah

Turn it up [x4]
I don't want them to hear what we're doing, so just
Turn it up [x4]
I be screaming so loud, don't you dare turn it down
Turn it up [x4]
Baby you can put it on me to your favorite song
Turn it up [x4]
Get that heavy rotation all night long

So turn it up
I like that, I like that
Uh yeah
Turn it up
