my way has had me going nuts
my way is to busy stumbling through it
my way is to stare directly into a cloud
hoping, a lightning bolt will strike me down

but its okay
i got it i got it now
its okay
zeus is busy checking twitter

its okay
i got it all figured out
i got it all figured out
guess i’ll just become a winner

i’ve learned some new things recently,
the first is :

life can be so easy if you comprehend your
simplest needs
(for instance)

where you wanna go?
riding shotgun with who?
where is my phone?
ándele! ándele!
wanna rule the world?
or lay in bed alone?
(that's fine)
what you waiting for?
and lastly,
who do you want to fuck?
(its easy enough)

[erik hassle, kilo kish]
don’t think to hard you don’t need to
no ones waiting, there’s no sequel
