Lost Y'all Mind
Some of y'all done lost y'all mind
(Oh, Lord)
Some of y'all done lost y'all mind
(Oh, God)
And it made me cry, cry, cry (4x)

Alright, once again it's me
Kilo-Ali with positivity
?? so you got to hustle
Drug dealers ain't nothin' but trouble
Do the crime, you go to pay the price
What you gon' tell Jesus Christ?
He don't smoke, he don't get high
Where a kid go after they die?
'Cause it's a sin to sell
Brother you can go to jail, or you can go to hell
What about a brother be thinking he a pimp, though?
What he calls his mother, a trick hoe?
Or his cousin, or his sister, or his auntie?
Boy, you better learn to love the ladies
I think your slippin'
But you think you pimp, pimp, pimpin'
Four nickles and a dime
Some of y'all done lost y'all mind (2x)

Chorus (4x)

Since i made White Horse
They think I hate white folks
Oh man, that's gotta be a white joke
It ain't what I done to my country
It's what my country done to me
Red, white and blue the flag again
I'll burn it, black American
I gotta stand up for myself
Brother give me freedom or give me death
When I rap for the blacks
White folks don't like to hear me talk like that
A black cop will lock me up faster
He'll be lookin for uncle Tommy and a master
And I'm looking for a brother
But he called me a black mother fucker
So I looked him in his eyes
And he made me cry, cry, cry
I know you gotta make you a livin'
But why you gotta hurt my feelings?
Four nickles and a dime
Some of y'all lost y'all mind (2x)

Chorus (4x)

See the world is a zoo
And if you live in the world I'm talking about you
You try to touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place if you can
See, all we need to do is keep the love in our hearts
We all survive without God we have nothing
But with God we have everything
Yes, that's why I always say
I say....
Money and clothes
And beamers and bowes
I'd rather go to heaven then any of those (5x)
