(Chorus)x2
I'm gonna show you (show you)
You buster (you buster)
You know you love me (love me)
Now show me love (show me)

I flow like a butterfly and sting like a bee
It's Me! Ali!
And the heat inside your brain cold strong in the game
And you know this MAN
Your so good can't refuse it
This is my shadow this is my music
It's the fire, it's the funk
Now you feel me, now you don't
Super show, side to side
Shawty sukky sukky now
Cut up cut up in the dish
How much cut up do you wish?
I dont play, I'm no toy
I'm rollin it up for my homeboys
I start on it, there will be no stop
You can't beat me boy, I'm SUPERMAN

(chorus)x2

I rap too the fans, makin' that cash
Cutti'n up like a piece of glass
Imagine if you can
If you can rap like Kilo man
Flllll-bass, flllll-low
I live inside your radio
So dont give me no hastle
For I'm the king of the castle
And a reign supreme
You who am I?......Kilo the dream
That's right ha ha
That's it ha ha
Some times a brother trip
I know you admire me
I didn't mean to dis you I'm sorry
I apologize, but you better recognize
What is crap if you dont know crap
What is rap if you really can't rap then
Who in the hell said they wanted a little more
What in the fuck do you take me for?
I'll never go out for the die
And you you'll never take me alive
Can Kilo keep the party jumpin?.....ha ha

(chorus)x2

Say I, I make that pussy hurt
To sexy for my shirt
We didn't know know why
I put my dick on the side of her drawz
She came all down my pants
She got up and danced
And then she started sayin, oh  I,  love your ding a ling
Told the rest of the girls I was little
But I can go 24 in the middle
Fuckin girls is part of my diiiiick
Bumped de bump, remember that
From the back, looked kinda fat
GOOOOOOD-Damn!
Sha-Shawty  you made me scream
Sha-Shawty was 17
Sha-Shawty was a beauty queen
Shawty is a name, budda G, budda G

(chorus)till end
