I meet this girl in Atlanta, let me play in her mizzouth
She make my dick so hizzard, it never goes Sizzouth
From the side to the side, the bitch gon' get it all
From the top of my dizzick, to the bottom of my bizzall
I feel her fingernail as she grab it and beat it
She ready to eat it whenever I skeet it
She did it in the dark but in the light she won't do it
She be unzippin my pants she be gettin straight to it
No, it was not a dream, even though that's what it seemed
I kick, I scrat, I skit, I scrat, I scream
The shit was feelin freaky, she was feelin fun
I didn't feel her teethes, I only felt her tongue
Relax, I'm gettin massaged by tha massouse
She wouldn't let me gi-zzo, she wouldn't let me loose
I don't know her she was somebody else
But I was happy that's why I said to myself
But this shit was nothin new, she do it anyway
She didn't wanna talk she ain't got nothin to say but

****Chorus****
Oh ah ah ou ow ah ah ou love ya, love in ya mouth (x 2)
We makin love sho nuff we makin love all in ya mouth (x2)
Well can I put it in yo mouth, yes ya can ((x4)

I take 3 bitches and I put 'em in a line
I take 4, 5 ,6 and blow 'dem hoes mine
It'll take 1 more before I go for mine
7 bitches get fucked at tha same time
She eats me, sun she, she can suck a dingo
All day all night all evenin long
She said she never done it, she said she never tried
Shes sittin there tellin a mother fuckin lie
Now, how many licks does it take to make my dick split
Well, not many licks if tha bitch is a good trick
Now, any niggas can talk to a bitch and get tha bitch to fuck
But how many niggas can talk to a bitch and get they dick sucked
Like me a pimp that u nevea saw
Now how do u say "ménage à trois?"
When my shit gets soft
She make my shit get long
I don't see nothin, I don't see nothin, I don't see nothin wrong

~~~Chorus~~~

Dick off to tha rima
Bring me all tha girs that be fuckin all of 'dem
With tha big pizza parler
Yes yes y'all
Me dick iz not to big 'dem pussys are to small
Wipe me dick off with a rag
Self respect doin to tha pussy I just had
As she holla'd like a chid
Dick up to her spine
For that crack head head woman there will be no tryin
Ummmmm, I can be a lover ta man
Ooooooo, no one do like I can
Hurt me hurt me for I won't cry
