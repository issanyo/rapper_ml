[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dizzee]
I remember when I used to say (I Luv U)
Never scared, always saying (I Luv U)
Cause I really felt that (I Luv U)
And I really believed that (I Luv U)
Some girls told me (I Luv U)
But I'm sure they didn't mean (I Luv U)
Cause would I really hurt you if (I Luv U)?
And would I give you pain if (I Luv U)?
And that's what I got so (I Luv U)
Don't mean much but (I Luv U, U, U)
(I Luv U) Won't be forgot cause (I Luv U)
They're serious words (I Luv U)
But I don't want no (Luv, Luv)
Cause I don't need your (Luv, Luv)
You can keep your (Luv, Luv)

[Hook: Dizzee, Sharky & Wiley]
(I Luv U) Yeah, I'm sure that you do
Cause I feel like it too but I can't be with you
You still say (I Luv U), yeah, it's playing with my mind
Cause I think that you're fine but it just ain't the time
But you say (I Luv U), could you teach me to share?
I don't know how to care, it just wouldn't be fair
You'd still say (I Luv U)
I just wish you wouldn't though
Cause now I've gotta go
Understand I'm not your man

[Verse 2: Sharky Major]
I want an intelligent girl, girl that can rock my world
A female with brains as well as looks
A buff ting that likes to read books
And cooks and hates when I mess with the crooks
Prestige, only wears Prada suits
The kind of girl want to have my youts
When the hard times come, we stay strong like roots
And she makes her own loop, my alibi for whenever I shoot
Girl I can love forever, no bredder
I'd mention Nasty Crew, she'd say whatever
Cause she ain't really down for raving
Kind of girl I can guarantee she ain't fucking my bredrin
Hates when she sees me spending
Knows about stacking, thinks about the yards that we're having
That's the kind of girl I'm expecting
Not some hoe [?] any guy could be sexing

[Hook: Dizzee, Sharky & Wiley]
(I Luv U) Yeah, I'm sure that you do
Cause I feel like it too but I can't be with you
You still say (I Luv U), yeah, it's playing with my mind
Cause I think that you're fine but it just ain't the time
But you say (I Luv U), could you teach me to share?
I don't know how to care, it just wouldn't be fair
You'd still say (I Luv U)
I just wish you wouldn't though
Cause now I've gotta go
Understand I'm not your man

[Verse 3: Wiley]
(I) She wants (Luv) but she ain't gonna get
No (Luv) from me, I'm not ready for commitment
(Luv) is a word that you shouldn't say if you don't mean it
Believe me now, blud, I've seen it
I said it (Luv) But I learnt one time
Cause the girl that I (Luv) didn't waste no time
She was saying that she (Luv) me and then she was going out
Playing about, I found out, it didn't feel nice
Now I know about (Luv), I can see if it's (Luv)
I know when it's (Luv, Luv)
Start from scratch and we can (Luv) each other
And learn each other and know each other cause
(Luv) I've gotta look ahead to the future
(Luv) I can't see you in my future
I can only say I don't hate ya
I care for you (I Luv U)

[Hook: Dizzee, Sharky & Wiley]
(I Luv U) Yeah, I'm sure that you do
Cause I feel like it too but I can't be with you
You still say (I Luv U), yeah, it's playing with my mind
Cause I think that you're fine but it just ain't the time
But you say (I Luv U), could you teach me to share?
I don't know how to care, it just wouldn't be fair
You'd still say (I Luv U)
I just wish you wouldn't though
Cause now I've gotta go
Understand I'm not your man
