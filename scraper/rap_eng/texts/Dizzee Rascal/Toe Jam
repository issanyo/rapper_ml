[Part 1]
I was asked in New York City, do you like my clothes
I'm talking to my tape recorder, walking down the road
But on Friday night, I'm, purified that my feet don't touch the floor
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

[Part 2]
Everyday is fucking perfect, its a paradise
Watch my life like its a movie, have to watch it twice
A boy looks at a girl, and a girl looks like a pony
She gallops all day long, in between my toes
And every night, she's purified, she don't do that dance no more
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

[Part 3]
I'm skankin on the dance floor, I'm drunk off that hennessey
I ain't sober, i dont mix with coca cola, or soda
But right now im on a roller, i take a look over my shoulder
When i see that sexy thing, i think its time to work my way over
So i shuffle on my heals, and bounce on my toes
I'm crazy and she knows, still its all good i suppose
She picked a good place and she paked it up
I got behind her and i lapped it up
And we danced all night til the sun came up
Then i took her to my yard then i racked it up

[Part 4]
I'm a member of the ju ju nation
Down in new Orleans
You don't need an application
If you move your feet

[Hook]
Explode if you poke it
Exposed on the floor
It grows if you soak it
It rolls out the door

Now

[Part 5]
Summer time, every night, now my feet don't touch the floor
She don't do that dance no more, in between my toes
Him and you, you and I, I don't do that dance no more
When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes

[Part 6]
The lady starts to sing, but she ain't no disco dancer
She learned to shake her thing, in between my toes

[Hook] (x2)
Explode if you poke it
Exposed on the floor
It grows if you soak it
It rolls out the door
