Hey turn the base up, turn the base up yeah yeah
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Dirty, dirty stinkin big
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Base, base, base
I don’t need no speed
I don’t need no heroin
I don’t want no coke
You can keep your ketamine
I’m a bassline junkie, what?
I’m a bassline junkie, tell them again
I’m a bassline junkie, tell them again
I don’t like it funky
I’m a fiend for a big day bassline
When I hear one I have a great time
A bit of bass’ all what I require
I let the bassline take me higher
My friends think that it’s a bad habit
But I’m just like fuck you, damn it
If you take my base away
I’ll blow your fucking face away
You might think I’m over the top
But when I hear that bassline drop
I just can’t control my actions
But I still feel satisfaction
So don’t come around that engine
I just wanna hear the bassline rinsin
Or we can just... day
If not get the fuck out my way
I don’t need no speed
I don’t need no heroin
I don’t want no coke
You can keep your ketamine
I’m a bassline junkie, what?
I’m a bassline junkie, tell them again
I’m a bassline junkie, tell them again
I don’t like it funky
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty dirty stinking base
Dirty, dirty stinkin big
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Base, base, base
You ever doubt, go ...
And I think it’s well out of order
All my neighbors throwing the fifth
So I told them suck my dick
And I told them I got the power
And I turn the music up louder
All night till 6 in the morning
Old bastards, they're just boring
You know me, I’m the bassline ...
Nobody can't tell me nada
And the police turned up and they took me
We drove out to the liquor and they bought me
When I said there give me a couchin
If I didn’t give them no distinction
But I said don’t bother, I’m guilty
I’m a bassline fucking filthy
I don’t need no speed
I don’t need no heroin
I don’t want no coke
You can keep your ketamine
I’m a bassline junkie, what?
I’m a bassline junkie, tell them again
I’m a bassline junkie, tell them again
I don’t like it funky
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base

Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Base, base, base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
