Make no mistakes
When we go, we go hard
We don't play around
We don't play around
5 AM screaming louder than rock stars
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh

I don't wanna tell you how to have a good time
I wanna show you how a good time looks like
Tell whoever's in your house don't wait up
We're gonna party and we're gonna do it all night
I got something in my pocket that'll blow your mind
I got something in a glass that'll free you up
So why you're standing there looking all stupid?
I'll bet you any money I could get you pop flop
I never wanna hear no half why excuses
All I wanna do is stand upto the music
Everybody's getting loose and this an exclusive
All the women over there they're looking intrusive
Pull your socks up a little, opposite of useless
Go and offer them a glass and a couple juices
Haters say they wanna roll y'all we can do this
If you wanna have a good time then approve it

Make no mistakes
When we go, we go hard
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh
5 AM screaming louder than rock stars
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh
We gon drink, hands high
We'll be in the club tonight
Hands up that's right
We'll be in the club tonight
Make no mistakes
When we go, we go hard
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh

Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
Now you're getting all hot, drop don't stop
Have you feeling like you're gonna pass her all up
Did you ever think that you could ever get this hot?
Everybody looking at you and they're all in shock
Cause you're getting GG with it all over the shot
But you never thought that I could make you drop on lock
But you never thought that I could make you want ambra
Skippy on the beat, shuffling your feet
I know you feel sweet
But you don't wanna hump it
You don't wanna clash, you're gonna damn rush
I'll pull up them MJ blues in a flash
And I'm fightin off a birthday rush
How you know I'm looking for the birthday lash?
Gonna get high on my birthday stash
I just wanna have a good time but guess what?

Make no mistakes
When we go, we go hard
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh
5 AM screaming louder than rock stars
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh
We gon drink, hands high
We'll be in the club tonight
Hands up that's right
We'll be in the club tonight
Make no mistakes
When we go, we go hard
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh

I don't wanna tell you how to have a good time
I wanna show you how a good time looks like
We go hard
I don't wanna tell you how to have a good time
I wanna show you how a good time looks like
We don't play around

We gon drink, hands high
We'll be in the club tonight
Hands up that's right
We'll be in the club tonight
Make no mistakes
When we go, we go hard
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh

We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh
We don't play around no oh
