[Intro]
She don't wanna play no games with me
Coz she knows what she wants

[Hook]
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She dont beg no pardon and she dont beg no response
She dont beg no pardon and she dont beg no response
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She dont beg no pardon and she dont beg no response
She dont beg no pardon and she dont beg no response

[Verse 1]
She knows what she wants
She don't want a nonce
Play her own way
She is not a ponce
Looking nonchalant
Looking confident I wanna be her confidant
With a big badonk-a-donk
The ba-donkas looking tonk
I'll give her the wonky bony
But not before I take her to a boujee restautant
Yeah a boujee restautant
With the fancy condiments
And get her what she wants
Coz she knows what she wants
She wants a fancy fella with the manners and the charm
She wants a fancy fella in the new designer garms
She wants a fancy fella that'll be boppin arm-in-arm
Be her knight in shining armour and she'll never come to harm
He'll get a private jet and take her shopping in Milan
Or fly her to Dubai and have her staying at The Palm
She wants a fancy fella who's a gentleman and calm but I'm not a fancy fella so I'll tell her wagwan

[Hook]
She said she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She don't beg no pardon and she don't beg no response
She don't beg no pardon and she don't beg no response
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She don't beg no pardon and she don't beg no response
She don't beg no pardon and she don't beg no response

[Verse 2]
She knows where its at brought the t-shirt and the hat
She don't chat a lot of crap always snapping on the app
Got me shaggin' in the flat
She ain't lackin' in the back
Keeps the kitty cat intact
Yeah the kitty cats a rap
I can rap about her baps or
I can rap about the way she tries to hit me with the facts
Trying to hit me with the stacks
Trying to hit it then relax
Take a cheeky little nap
I'm a cheeky chap but if if ever cheat I'll get a slap
She wants a fancy fella who is loyal and is true
Who takes her out for strolls and can forget about the crew
She wants a fancy fella that her parents can approve
And can make a brave suggestion when she don't know what to do
She wants a fancy fella that'll treat her like a boo and not treat her like a bird coz she's had a cock or two
She wants a fancy fella that'll properly pursue but my name is Dizzee Rascal and I'm just passing through

[Hook]
She said she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She don't beg no pardon and she don't beg no response
She don't beg no pardon and she don't beg no response
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She don't beg no pardon and she don't beg no response
She don't beg no pardon and she don't beg no response

[Outro]
Yeah
She knows what she wants
Don't wanna' playa like me
No, no, no, no
She don't wanna' rebel like me
