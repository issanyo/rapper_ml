[Intro]
Eskiboy
Tunnel Vision Volume 6 you know me
Hold tight the studio mandem but, you know what it is
I'm laughing in my head because like, one stupid yout's running around chatting rubbish about pussy'ole
And this and that, rah rah rah
And it, it, it's indirect
It sounds like someone's tryna to talk to someone but
I'm stepping up like
If you wanna talk, you should talk to me, direct, say my name
Because like, you're meant to be a big MC in the game
So why would you like, piss around
Run the riddim, let's hear the riddim though
Let's hear-let's listen to this riddim, and see what's happening with the riddim
I said cah

[Verse 1]
(Rude boy, don't watch that)
Let's hear this (Cause if it's armshouse I'll rock that)
Yeah what is that right (And if it's on top you know I got that)
He said he's got it, so listen (Come through with a big baseball bat)
(Like blud, don't make me get old school)
He thinks he can get oldschool (Blud, don't make me get old school)
Oi Dyl, you're loosing it (Blud, don't make me get old school)
It sounds like you're loosing it brother (Blud, don't make me get old school)

[Chorus]
(Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him)
(He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him)
Is that so (Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him)
Yeah, Tunnel Vision 6, listen (He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him)
(Why you rolling with that pussyhole)
(Moving with that pussyhole)
Yeah (You know that he's a pussyhole)
Yeah (I showed you he's a pussyhole)
Yeah (He's always been a pussyhole)
Yeah (So he will always be a pussyhole)
Yeah (You're still with that pussyhole)
Is that so (You must be a pussyhole)
Okay, that's what he thinks, so let's hear him

[Verse 1]
(As the bredda always chatting like he's strong)
(Sneaky fake fuck always running to his brother when it's on)
(Hardly backs the beef, last one swinging)
Okay, so he don't mean me (First one running making them stories he's a chief)
(Bringing bredas to the ends, acting up)
I know he don't mean me in this verse (Putting on a show trying to talk funny to his friends)
He's just talking to anyone (But his really not a don they know it)
Hold tight anyone, take it on if you want (And you know it, something must be seriously wrong)
(Cause your parring, his mum calls you darling)
You get me (But his brothers got you shotting)
(And we know where you're stopping)
(I heard you both have beef with an older breh)
(You took a spark and he just stood there)
Okay he's talking to anyone, I'm gonna let this verse pass though (Now that boys a pussyhole say it ain't true)
(It started because of him and ended with you)
(And it's that kind of shit that's gonna continue)
Hold tight Cage (But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into)

[Chorus]
That's the joke (Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him)
Hold tight Cage, 'cause Cage knows (He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him)
That this kid ain't got nothing for me, Cage knows that (Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him)
[?] doesn't matter (He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him)
(Why you rolling with that pussyhole)
(Moving with that pussyhole)
Yeah (You know that he's a pussyhole)
Yeah (I showed you he's a pussyhole)
Yeah, alright, let me hear that second verse (He's always been a pussyhole)
Let me see what he's saying (So he will always be a pussyhole)
(You're still with that pussyhole)
Tunnel Vision 6 (You must be a pussyhole)
Let me hear what he's saying
You'll see why I [?]


[Verse 2]
(The Sun's the biggest star in the sky)
(But naturally its gotta make room for the moon every night)
(Every friend got his time limit)
(Even relationships)
(Everything's sunny when the friendships tight)
(A friend in need is a friend indeed)
(But a friend with no money and no weed)
Well you're wrong there (Could flip the script at a ridiculous speed)
(And make a best friend and ex friend for the P)
(A couple years ago in my road youth days)
What was you a road you Dyl? (I was into pirate radio I guess it was a phase)
(There was this one particular MC man)
(He was an older in my ends and I thought he was the dan)
Still am the dan you donut (So I started rolling with him kind of like a little brother)
(My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover)
Now hold on stop the riddim. stop there, stop there  (I didn't think that it was nothing more than jealousy)
Stop there (But I wish I woulda-)
Let us stop
Because you just said
That, your cousin told you I was a pussy
Hold on
I have done more, for you, that your cousin has done for you in all the years he has known you, yeah
I have done more for you
In Ayia Napa, I was there with you
Going through dat
You pinched Lisa Maffia's bum, why?
You didn't even need to but you did
So you're the donut
And your cousin, said I'm the pussy?
Alright, hold on
Let us stop
Because you just said
That, your cousin told you I was a pussy
Hold on
I have done more, for you, that your cousin has done for you in all the years he has known you, yeah
I have done more for you
In Ayia Napa, I was there with you
Going through dat
You pinched Lisa Maffia's bum, why?
You didn't even need to but you did
So you're the donut, yeah
And your cousin, said I'm the pussy?
Alright, hold on
Run the riddim again, run the riddim
'Cause we're gonna get your cousin, at the end
Run the riddim again

[Chorus]
(rolling with that breda, you don't need him)
(He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him)
Is that so (Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him)
Tunnel Vision 6, listen (He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him)
(Why you rolling with that pussyhole)
(Moving with that pussyhole)
Yeah (You know that he's a pussyhole)
Yeah (I showed you he's a pussyhole)
Yeah (He's always been a pussyhole)
Yeah (So he will always be a pussyhole)
Yeah (You're still with that pussyhole)
Yeah (You must be a pussyhole)
Okay, that's what he thinks
Okay listen
See this boy?
This boy has never come
He's never tried to clash me (Pussyhole)
He will never come around me on a stage
You know why, 'cause he's a (Pussyhole)
Because he is a pussyhole, yeah
I step on stages (Pussyhole)
And I come around the place but he don't come 'round near me
So who is a (Pussyhole)

[Outro]
You get me (Stay away from those pussyholes, you can have it all)
(Live endlessly tremendous forever ball)
So he's going on with this third verse (Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall)
But you know what stop the riddim cah I don't even wanna hear this (But definitely know when not to lose your cool)
Stop the riddim (Cause it ain't what you show, it's what your concealing)
And we've got something to say (Put a smile on the deepest negative feeling)
We have got something to say
You see what it is
When you do riddims, or you're sending for something, or you're in a war
Come a bit more direct than that
Because since you were last here Dyl, for your information, like, we approached each other a bit more than that
Like that wasn't really enough
To take down Wiley in this day and age, that weren't enough
So you need to go back to the studio, sort out your album
And hold tight all the forum massive, everyone watching
'Cause it's not about how much money you've got
No one cares
I've got P
He's got P, Lethal's got P, Kano's got P
But whether you've got P or not yeah, it doesn't matter
You're either gonna win the clash or you ain't
It doesn't matter if you've got 50 grand in your pocket
You're either gonna win or you ain't
And I've got information for all those people, who everyone saying dudududu
Lethal, Kano, and Dizzee yeah
All three of dem, have got money
I've got money though
So what does that mean then? We've all got money
Money don't affect me, it don't change me
I just do my normal thing
You ain't none of them three niggas on the stage in the hood, with the scene, for years
So he must be a pussyhole
Dizzee must be the pussy
'Cause you ain't seen him, around man, for years
Not on the same stage, not on nothing, yeah
Okay
Tunnel Vision 6
Don't forget, Playtime's Over
June the 4th
Hold tight DVA, top boy producer
Hold tight Sama
Hold tight everyone, you get me
And oh yeah I forgot
Your cousin
So your cousin said I was a pussy yeah
Hold tight your cousin yeah
He's a pussy yeah
For him to call me a pussy and he don't know me, he must be a pussy
And, you're a even bigger pussy
'Because before when we was in Peckham, and your cousin was in beef, you didn't even back him
Yeah
So he's on the road telling you that I'm a pussy from then
So he's a pussy, and you're a pussy, because you didn't even back each other
So, hello
