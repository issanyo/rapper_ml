Life's too short to be livin' with stress
I'm too young to be all depressed
I can't complain, I'm highly blessed
And there's one thing that I want to get off my chest
I'm free as a bird, I'm high as a kite
I could do what I want, and I'm doing alright
That's why I just might celebrate tonight
And if you ain't down with it, then get on your bike
To sank elsewhere, who the hell cares
I'm in great shape, you need health care
If you can't say something nice, then keep quiet
Or come to the club, there's girls there
I'm goin' to rave 'til six in the mornin'
I can already hear the bassline callin'
Just make up your mind, stop stallin'
And don't be half assed, 'cause I'm all in

So if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it
Your car don't work, we can go without it
We don't need wheels, just the will to party
I'll take you there, don't doubt it

(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

You wanna drink? It's on me
Coca-cola, JD
I don't care about VIP
'Cause the middle of the dance floor's cool with me
I wanna shock tonight
I wanna rock tonight
Come love, let me be the robot tonight
So many damn girls lookin' hot tonight
So before I leave here, I wanna cop tonight
So I can't just stand up against the wall
Try'na play it cool, feelin' like a fool
Like I'm scared to dance, 'cause I ain't scared at all
So there's no point lookin' all miserable
So I've got a big grin on my face
And my hands on a pretty girl's waist
Beer budget and champagne taste
But I feel like I'm running this place

So if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it
Your car don't work, we can go without it
We don't need wheels, just the will to party
I'll take you there, don't doubt it

(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Come, follow me to the place
We can party all night, yeah
Leave your worries behind (let's party)
We've only got your star if only for tonight (show the world!)
Show the world you can shine (that's right!)
Everyone's happy so there'll be no drama tonight
There's always yours to define
So let down your hair and prepare for the time of your life
The time of your life, yeah

Brrrrrrr-aaaah!
Oooooooh-aaaah!

I'm feelin' myself right now
Really revealin' myself right now
I'm actin' a fool, and I think it's all good
I wouldn't be nowhere else if I could
I don't ever wanna go home, let's stay
Party all night and party all day
What do you say? Tell me you're on it
Drink 'til we can't stand up, then vomit
Quicker than a comet, I feel like a star
Everyone waves, they know who we are
So much love, so much dread
Tell me you don't feel like a tomboy
In fact don't tell me nothing, just skank
'Cause I got a shawty and shizz in the bank
No need to thank, the pleasure is mine
We should try do this again some time

And if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it
Your car don't work, we can go without it
We don't need wheels, just the will to party
I'll take you there, don't doubt it

(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go-o-o-o
