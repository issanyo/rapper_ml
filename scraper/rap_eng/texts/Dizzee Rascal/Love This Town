[Intro: Dizzee Rascal]
New York, LA, Tokyo, Berlin, Miami, Rio, Milan, Ibiza
I love all these places, but there's no place like home
I love my city

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
I go hard in the city of London
I get a lot of love, all smiles when I step in the function
I’m a local boy, I’m from the east side
Now I’m jet settin, I’m reppin, I’ll do it worldwide
When I was a kid there was a rough ride
Barely had the money for a bus ride, now I’m on the upside
Having a ball with all the breders I grew up with
A couple of women I’m in the club with
Bottle the bubbly, feeling lovely, women are hugging me
Nobody could tell me nothing and nobody can never trouble me
It’s all good, pure positive vibes
For the most part everybody’s just tryna live their lives
We’re not afraid to die, only the strong survive
You don’t know if you don’t try, the stakes are high
And it’s the city where I earned my crown
God knows that I love this town

[Hook: Teddy Sky]
The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
It’s just one big melting pot
Every creed colour and race, we got the lot
And I love to shop, there's not a brand that can't be copped
No more than a couple of stops
Where should I begin?
Might see me in the west side getting it in
Might see me on the north side getting a trim
South side of the river in a race car having a spin, I just win
And I’m never gonna lose with the city to guide me
Got the vibe of the city inside me and the streets are lively
Got a whole lot of love and I'm connect it
It’s 7 million people behind me, don’t try me
‘Cuz right now we’re gonna rave it up
Set the roof on fire and blaze it up
And we’re in it to win it
There’s no limit so we raise it up
We got the dancefloor shaking like, woo

[Hook: Teddy Sky]
The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

[Bridge: Teddy Sky]
I fuckin' love this town

[Hook: Teddy Sky]
The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
