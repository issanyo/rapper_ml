[Intro]
Rude boy, don't watch that
Cause if it's armshouse I'll rock that
And if it's on top you know I got that
Come through with a big baseball bat
Like blud, don't make me get old school
Blud, don't make me get old school
Blud, don't make me get old school
Blud, don't make me get old school

[Chorus]
Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole

[Verse 1]
As the bredda always chatting like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always running to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swinging
First one running making them stories he's a chief
Bringing bredas to the ends, acting up
Putting on a show trying to talk funny to his friends
But his really not a don they know it
And you know it, something must be seriously wrong
Cause your parring, his mum calls you darling
But his brothers got you shotting
And we know where you're stopping
I heard you both have beef with an older breh
You took a spark and he just stood there
Now that boys a pussyhole say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And it's that kind of shit that's gonna continue
But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into

[Chorus]
Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole

[Verse 2]
The Sun's the biggest star in the sky
But naturally its gotta make room for the moon every night
Every friend got his time limit
Even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendships tight
A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Could flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend and ex friend for the P
A couple years ago in my road youth days
I was into pirate radio I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
He was an older in my ends and I thought he was the dan
So I started rolling with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothing more than jealousy
But I wish I woulda listened every time he told me

[Chorus]
Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole
Pussyhole, Pussyhole
Pussyhole, Pussyhole

[Verse 3]
Stay away from those pussyholes, you can have it all
Live endlessly tremendous forever ball
Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall
But definitely know when not to lose your cool
Cause it ain't what you show, it's what your concealing
Put a smile on the deepest negative feeling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Then watch your money rise right to the ceiling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Yea watch your money rise right to the ceiling

[Chorus]
Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that breda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole
