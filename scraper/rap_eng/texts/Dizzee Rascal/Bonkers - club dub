I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everythin' in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
A heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says that I gotta get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip
Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me
Some people pay for thrills
But I get mine for free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me
Bonkers
I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everythin' in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
A heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says that I got to get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip
Bonkers
Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me
Some people pay for thrills
But I get mine for free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me
Mmm, yeah, I'm back in the floor now
I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everythin' in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
A heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says that I got to get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip
Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon
Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me
Some people pay for thrills
But I get mine for free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me
