[Verse 1]
Wot u gonna do when your money ain't long?
Wot u gonna do when your name ain't strong?
Wot u gonna do when they won't play your records?
And you don't get booked 'cause your buzz is all gone?
Sittin' there tryna' write the same old song
Tryin' to work out where it all went wrong
Wot u gonna do when your fans don't care
'cause they're all grown up and they all moved on?
Wot u gonna do when it goes downhill?
Callin' up girls, but they don't wanna' chill
Wot u gonna do when you wanna roll out?
But they don't wanna know cause they ain't no thrill
If looks could kill, how would it feel?
Ain't on the guest list, ain't on the bill
What you gonna do when you clock it was all your fault?
You were too busy keeping it real
Wot u gonna do when the walls close in?
Wot u gonna do when it all goes grim?
Wot u gonna do when it's all on top and they still wanna know if you're on this ting?
Everybody wants to take shots at the king
Wot u gonna do, sink or swim?
Wot u gonna do, theres a whole lot of love and a whole lot of hate and the line is thin?
Wot u gonna do when it ain't all sweet?
Wot u gonna do now when your kids gotta eat?
Wot u gonna do, cause you got too far
You're a star, you can't go back to the streets?
Can't disappear, kick back for a week
It's actually peak!
Wot u gonna do, keep quiet or speak?
Ain't nobody gonna shed no tears, get back on your feet

[Hook]
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it's all on you?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it ain't all about you?

[Refrain]
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it's all on you boy?
Boy wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it ain't all about you?

[Verse 2]
Wot u gonna do, you don't set no trends, drop no gems?
Wot u gonna do, you ain't got not friends, no one to fend gotta make amends?
Wot u gonna do, when there's no top tens
Wot u gonna do, when you gotta downgrade, no chauffeured Benz?
People lookin' at it like "Raah, swear down what's good? Never thought I'd see you in the ends"
Deep breath and takin' a pause
Gonna end up breakin' fools
Looks like nobody is down for the cause
Wot u gonna do, when the tax man is banging at your door and you know you've been breaking the rules?
Should have read that payment clause
Wot u gonna do, when the cheques don't come and your lawyer dips out, stops takin' your calls
Wot u gonna do, when the sun don't shine?
Can't unwind, when you're online
Everybody sayin' that "You're past your prime."
Wot u gonna do, when you know MC's keep cattin' your flow but you can't get signed?
Wot u gonna do, when you get locked up cause you ain't got money for the parking fine?
Wot u gonna do, when it all goes sideways
Gotta work weekend shifts at Mac D's, and you can't party on a Friday
Wot u wanna do is just fly away
Wanna get ghost on the highway
Wot u gonna do, when you ain't that guy and the girls don't stop and say "Hi babe?"
Better just stay on the grind mate

[Hook]
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it's all on you?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it ain't all about you?

[Refrain]
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it's all on you boy?
Boy wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do? Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do?
Wot u gonna do when it ain't all about you?

[Outro]
Everybody wanna take shots at the king
