[Intro: Wiley]
Yo, Eskiboy
Roll Deep, Creeper
Volume 2 out now
Hold tight Raskit
Listen

[Verse 1: Wiley]
I'm just sitting here
Thinking about the money that I've spent
All the money that I've lent
All the money that's been wasted
I'm sitting here
Waiting for my time to come around
And the other day, I weren't in
But the police come around
And they tried to catch me out
Another thing to think about
Plus, my life is just a mess
I'm struggling, trying to work it out
But here's the answer:
You're never gonna work out everything about life
Even if your head is screwed on
You will always question life

[Chorus: Wiley]
'Cause it's the same old story
Everybody looking out for themselves
And it's the same old story
Money rules the world, try to forget that
And it's the same old story
You can't forget it 'cause it's true
And it's the same old story
People kill for money, what?
It was only yesterday
You might've got a punch in the face
It was only yesterday
You might've got him in a headlock
It was only yesterday
You could've been winning, now you're losing
But life is moving faster
Here's a clue: move with the times

[Bridge: Wiley]
I'm just sitting here
Yo, I'm just sitting clear
Eskiboy-boy, I'm just sitting here
It's Eskiboy-boy, I'm just sitting here
I'm just sitting here
It's Eskiboy-boy, I'm just sitting here
Yo, yo, I'm just sitting here
Eskiboy, yo, I'm just sitting here, yo

[Verse 2: Brazen]
I should be sitting down right now
Chilling but I'm stressing
There's always something bugging me
Not letting me get
To where I wanna be, but I'm a cheater
I've got guts
They say that I ain't reasonable
But I don't listen much
I'm Brazen, you'll get banged up
This is badboy Brazen from the bad parts
You can't see animals, you can hear my dogs bark
When the fog settles, shots at you when it gets dark
Start beef, then finish it, not even a little bit
Of a half-heart, here, we shoot to settle it
We move cleverly, regularly, mind your business
I witness enemies bredding my dick, now
Move out my way, I'm causing a scene now
Forget sitting about
Gotta be kweng on the ends
Just because now my time begins
People wanna come and try a ting
