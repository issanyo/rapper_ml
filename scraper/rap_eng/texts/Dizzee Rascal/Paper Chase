[Hook: Dizzee]
Who's riding? Who's riding?
I'm on a paper chase, who's riding?
Who's flying? Who's flying?
I'm on a paper chase, who's flying?
Who's shining? Who's shining?
I'm on a paper chase, who's shining?
Who's lying? Who's lying?
I'm on a paper chase, who's lying?
Who's riding? Who's riding?
I'm on a paper chase, who's riding?
Who's flying? Who's flying?
I'm on a paper chase, who's flying?
Who's shining? Who's shining?
I'm on a paper chase, who's shining?
Who's lying? Who's lying?
I'm on a paper chase, who's riding?

[Verse 1: Dizzee]
Jetsetting in the place, cap over the hood
Like I already should, I'm Hollywood
Still back in the day, I never even knew I could
Now it's foot in the door, it's all good
You might say it's all gravy
Putting in work, I'm not just a lazy 80s baby living crazy
Fuck me, pay me or get out the way
I'm like a broken TDK, you can't play me
Only God can save me
Therefore only God can restrain me
Quite simply and plainly, fuck the world, I'm Dick Cheney
Arsehole, definitely maybe
I'm shady with no overheads
I just blow the wedge
I wanna get some dap, I don't go to feds
I'm like Simon says
What I say is any booth gets put to bed, 'nough said

Who's riding? Who's riding?
I'm on a paper chase, who's riding?
Who's flying? Who's flying?
I'm on a paper chase, who's flying?
Who's shining? Who's shining?
I'm on a paper chase, who's shining?
Who's lying? Who's lying?
I'm on a paper chase, who's lying?
Who's riding? Who's riding?
I'm on a paper chase, who's riding?
Who's flying? Who's flying?
I'm on a paper chase, who's flying?
Who's shining? Who's shining?
I'm on a paper chase, who's shining?
Who's lying? Who's lying?
I'm on a paper chase, who's riding?

[Verse 2: Scrufizzer]
Word on the road, girls wanna fuck me
Niggas wanna rush me
Everybody tryna go on like they're really gully
It's funny, you man are bummy
Chatting and rapping about how you're gunning with a snub
You're a fool, you ain't no donny in the ends
You're a dead man walking, don't put money on my head
I won't let them trouble me again
The next time I come around bucking up a skeng
I'm ready to ride, ready to die like Machiavelli
Sparta marching, causing a storm like Halle Berry
Lines and rhymes, striking mine
When I rap [?]
They never thought I had it in me
Peeps can't seem to stop my whole roster
Seeking [?] posture
The demon is scheming, but I'm never paid in white
I keep aiming high, woop
