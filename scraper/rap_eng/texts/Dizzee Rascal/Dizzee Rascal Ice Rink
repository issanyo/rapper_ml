[Intro]
Yo, one
What you do will come back to you
Yo, 1 2, I'm just warming up warming up
Pressure pressure
Big up the North London Crew, big up the South London crew, East London crew, West London crew
Yeah, look, real, look

[Verse 1]
I gotta rude attitude
Far from a role model (uh)
I'm so fulla trouble and (rags)
I couldn't give a rasclart not a bit
Couldn't give a rats arse if it's shit and (rags)
I still behave raw no love for the law
Feds bother me more and rags
I don’t care were you live
Or who you're with you'll get buried in the grass
I say what I say real fast
Say it with stylie
Say it with class
Goin' on dirty I said it in the past
Don’t like me I say kiss my arse
Kiss from left to the right (what)
Kiss till my fat bum cheeks turn (yo)
Kiss my arse through the night
Don’t stop till you see daylight, look

[Verse 2]
Tip-toes
Life ain't always nice
That's how shit goes
You know we're goin' on black
Cause we're blickrows
And I can't be seen with these
What did I say last night I bet your chick knows
You were not knockin' the boots how we hit toes
Your girl's the same as all
Bimbo's, freak's and nimpho's (yo, look)
I got an idea, make dough on the spot
I mean right here
Now give girls the paper for the whole year
Bring drama cause I don't know fear
And my head feels so clear
Move to the mic MC's are like oh dear
Some try catching me but they're not near
Not ever, not now, or not here way too hot here yo

[Verse 3]
Didn’t wanna care
Left that boy in a gutter somewhere (in the gutter)
Talk live o wanna talk bre (bre)
Make you wish you were born elsewhere
I gota wash that girl out ma hair
She’s old news everyone’s been there
No were not equal no were not fair
That girl’s anything she gets air

[Verse 4]
That mc is down
Tell him I said it
And I said it real loud
Goin' on roudy
Goin' on roud
That boy tried it
That boy failed
Sorry, pardon, what (what)
Coulda got boared up coulda got shot
Gun man get gun down on the spot
Who's hot who's a bad boy who's not

[Verse 5]
Stop dat
Start dat
Get dat, what
Been there done that had that what
He's got a Nokia, take that what
Big mouth, loud mouth watch that
Pretty girl, buff girl doggy dat (what)
Raskits on the format what
Bad manners get a backslap what
Call the shots like top cat (yo)

[Verse 6]
Guns in the air
Feds on the case but we don’t care (look)
Rifle uzi everything there
I got a shotgun spare
Leave them where, raskits lair
Eat MC's like a grizzly bear
Shoplift daily we don’t care
If you wanna test get hung by your hair over there

[Verse 7]
Look inside out (uh)
Dizzee flow, boy wile out (wile out)
Six foot deep you could never climb out (never)
Knock a boy inside knock a boy out
Front back outside in
Bare foot kids sippin' on ginseng
Love making a doggy styling
Dark park on a dark evening
Pump up tone up weights in the gym
Glass fulla alyza right to the brim
Roll seep sole deep they can’t swim
Doin' it for Keisha
Doin' it for Kim
Wants arms ouse
He wants to swing (swing)
Try ting get a punch in the chin (chin)
Better start worrying (worrying)
Get a hidin' beatin' turfing (turfing)

[Verse 8]
Do the butterfly
Shake your batty low
Shake your batty high
Don’t ask me how were when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky line
Do the butterfly
Shake your batty low
Shake your batty high
Don’t ask me how where when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky
