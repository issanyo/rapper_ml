Bluku bluku, ina the informer 'ead
Bluku bluku, buss' a shot ina the informer' leg
Bluku bluku, me left the informer dead

[Verse 1: D Double E]
What yo gonna do when you hear that me and my crew are looking for you?
Knocking at your door, them the boys in blue, kidnap certain man that look like you
What yo gonna do when you hear that me and my crew are looking for you?
Knocking at your door, them the boys in blue, kidnap certain man that look
(I'm behind you)
I don't wanna hear no more talk
These boys don't know more war
Shank in the leg so you can't no more walk
Now you definitely taking the leg, blud
Who's gonna come about pure war talk?
Who wants to be outlined in chalk?
You shoulda known better, it was all your fault
Real bad man don't normally talk
Look like Skibba man, deal with the matter
Just like sicker man deal with the case
You said my niggas don't watch no face
Come to the ends, bust shells in face
I don't really wanna make it a court case
'Cos I know that you got Trident on base
You can't keep up with my pace
Cause I need more friends ina my space

[Hook: D Double E]

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
It's the E3 African
Ready for action and I'm the main attraction
Everybody stopping and clocking to see
How I'm holding or what I be rocking
I got the whole world jocking, chart topping
Dirty South hip-hopping with the big bass knocking
Fully thugged out, never stopping
All blacked out so the feds can't spot him, going on so rotten
It don't cease
People telling me to increase the peace
I release decrease when I reach the East
But I release the beast, I don't care
Real bare chest, no Jesus piece
I'm John the Baptiste, wetting the road up
Hold up, I showed up flinging my gold up
Blinging and winging 'em out, I leave 'em in gold dust
Said they're running the town, but nobody told us
I never got the memo, I'm sorry fellow
You're a level below, I never even said hello
You're soft like jelo, I roll hard
I go dumb but I'm far from a retard
Blackberry at my yard on recharge
IPhone in my car, that's me, star
And I stay on the ball like FIFA
Still I stay smoking the potent reefer
See ya

[Hook: D Double E]

[Verse 3: D Double E]
I'm connected to more gangs than Ross Kemp
Manchester back down to Kent
Don't draw for the leng, a hundred percent
No pussy round here blud, I can't smell a scent
If you think that then you're not thinking sense
My mandem [?]
No muscle, no need to tense
Here's a bullet hole the size of ten pence
Nah, it's not me that you wanna come against
Car, whether you're small or hench
Got a big chest 'cos you love up the bench
When I release the cell you'll be losing strength
Understand I'm not talking friends
You know war with me, blud, it's too intense
I just hope your team's got good defense
Just know

[Hook: D Double E]
