Get your passport and your bikini
You need a holiday, come, see me
I know you're tired of the same old scenery
And I could change all that so easily
Don't worry 'bout a thing, girl, take a chance
I'll take you to the south of France like Cannes
If anybody can, I can
We can go shopping in Milan, I just hope you understand
I hope you see it clear
It really don't matter how far or near
'Cause there's no distance that can stop my persistence
Just a few days of the year
Plus I've got clout, so let's ride out
We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive out
We can have a rave or we can hide out
And won't tell nobody, let them find out
You could do what you want to, baby
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could get away, you could
You could do what you want to, baby
You could get away, you could get away, you could
Don't watch my passport photo
I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so, so
But let's try keep that on the low, low
'Cause we're going Ibiza
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of love
It's all good, darling, a Blue Marlin will please ya
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly's full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
See if I didn't it'd just be a pretty waste
So you look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place
You could do what you want to, baby
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could get away
You could get away, you could
You could do what you want to, baby
You could do what you want to, baby
