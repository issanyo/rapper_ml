Yo I dunno, Marga Man, wit tha rasket, Dizzee Rascal
Walking through the club doors, make way, make space
Make some more yo 'n' gettin' all the girls
Think der set, they don't know, they stink of sweat
It's Marga Man, Dizzee Rascal

As I get past the bouncers, walk to the dancefloor
Onto the stage, am blastin'
I've been blessed tonight on the sight
With all these beautiful beenies dancing
Am normally placed in front of a crowd
Who push up their face and stare and just stand
But thank god tonight, it's a totally different affair

I'm so excited and delighted
Almost feel to take ma hat off to these beenies
Who excite me by the way they shake their back off
It's amazing the way you lower urself and rise again,,
It's amazing, I feel the type to pick up the mike and rise again

Yo we got girls in the north, girls in the south
Girls in the east, girls in the west
Yo big batties, big breasts
So much gash no time to rest
Straight to the ting, no time to caress
Sex, we don't settle for less
Shines, we don't settle for less
No long time thing coz we don't like stress
Girls shake ya battys high, guys who can give it her
Not got no hair to shine like me
We don't have to fight, we could dance all night
Shake ya batty to the left, shake ya batty to the right
Girls shake ur batties high, guys who gonna give it her

And this old lady, it's so gravy
