[Intro]
There's some girls in this house
When you see 'em, point 'em out
There's some girls in this house
When you see 'em, point 'em out
There's some girls in this house
When you see 'em, point 'em out
There's some girls in this house
When you see 'em, point 'em out

[Verse 1]
Gotta lil' thing for play, lil' grindin'
Pretty lil' brown things, all about my timin'
London City got 'em handin'
Catch 'em branin', get the pussy though I'm panin'
So I get these star techniques outstandin'
Did it in a council flat on the landin'
I'm not rappin', neither puffin' and pantin'
On a one night stand thing
Just like Shauna, she didn't even gimme no drama
After the show, she was on my banana
After my seeds like a farmer
Let 'er maul out in a mouth like a trauma
Couldn't care less about karma or Carmen
Got 'er titties out in the bottom off my garden
I'm a bad boy, I don't beg no pardon
Pick 'em up and then I discard 'em

[Chorus]
I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me
I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me

[Verse 2]
I had this pretty lil' girl in Sweden
Yeah, she was kinda short but she was easin'
I like that kinda girl, you didn't even need to ask her name
Could you believe it?
She was suckin' my dick, you should have seen it
Got up and tried to kiss me in between it, 'low it
Could you imagine my disappointment?
Sprayed her in her mouth then watched her kiss her boyfriend
Yo, ask Angie 'cause she familiar
Got out my dick at the back of the cinema
Jamie Foxx, you know the kingdom one
She dealt with my dick 'til my kingdom cum
I'm a movie star, I'm quite unique on the camera
Wasn't quite like Green Street but I hammered her
I'm a player and a manager
Have a whole lot of game and a whole lot of stamina

[Chorus]
I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me
I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me

[Verse 3]
I'm so barmy, been a bad boy since Co. Cami
I know a couple white girls outside Yardley's
Give a couple of light skins tings like Harvey
Plus Barbie, that's my blond ting
She gimme brain in my car, no long ting
She ain't scared, she's on this ting
And she's always up for a bonkin'
Yo, my love life looks like Flava Flav's
I got girls for days, I got dark skin, pink, yellow, brown and beige
Come like a rainbow on a rainy day, non-discriminate
Long and strong and the sex is brilliant
Please make sure to contact Brazilian
Don't stop 'til I can't cum like William
So I keep drillin' on facsimilian

[Chorus]
I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me
I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me

[Verse 4]
Antoinette, Angelina, Alisha
Korina, Catherine, Keyshia
Kaykyro, Tina, Tylisha
Faye, Fiona, Felicia
Denice, Patrice, Shanice
Cherice, Dominique, Natalie and Nisha
Naomi, Nicola, Niree
I won't let any tramp ting get by me
Kelly, Jolene, and Josie
Believe I'm lookin' at Jennifer closely
Keeley, Kara's hot in here
But I'm lookin' for hour booties mostly
Eighteen to twenty-one
Anyone under the age don't fit the bill
But to all my independent ladies bring that pussy at will

[Chorus]
I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me
I get freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Do anythin' that you want me to
Just ask me, ask me, ask me
Just ask me, just ask me, just ask me
Freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, nasty
Freaky, freaky, freaky
And I get nasty, nasty, watch out

[Outro]
Yeah, that's how we're goin' on here
We take all shape, size, and colors
Sisters and mothers, but don't watch that though
Just know that I bag it before I shag it
Yeah
