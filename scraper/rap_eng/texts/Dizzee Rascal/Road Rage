[Intro]
What? Where you from? What?
Get out the fucking way you prick
Who you talking to?
What? Get out the fucking car then
Get out the car then
Fucking pussyole
Yeah, fuck you too
Your mum!

[Hook]
Beep beep, coming through
Move over, yeah, you
Don't argue, just blur
Hurry up or you're gonna get hurt

You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (move)
I'll put you in an early grave

[Verse 1]
TDA, TDA
I'll break in your car then I'll take it away
That's how I used to roll, back in the day
I only did it for a laugh, I didn't even get paid
And I couldn't give a shit about a junction
Couldn't care less about a red light's function
Drive sort of like I'm drunk, I'm swerving, swerving
Got two wheels and the car been mervin
On the tarmac, fall back
On my stereo, full blast, 2Pac
Holla if you hear me cause I'm only gonna be bouncer
Knock down all of these, let down all of these
Run down all of these chumps
Drive faster when I see speed bumps
Good enough stance?
I'm a smart guy, but if you see me drive you'll think I'm a God's like

[Hook]
Beep beep, coming through
Move over, yeah, you
Don't argue, just blur
Hurry up or you're gonna get hurt

You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (move)
I'll put you in an early grave

[Verse 2]
Neeyow, mind out
If you don't listen to me you'll find out
I don't indicate, I just swing about
Taking up two lanes, playing dare devil games
I don't give a shit cause my car is tinted
And If I get caught, I don't care, I'm minted!
Driving in the fast lane, ready for the violence
Had six points before I even had the licence
Now I'm legit and I couldn't give a rat's arse
All I see is flashlights cause I drive too fast
But I'm still a trooper, in my Mini Cooper
Went head to head, had a crash with a police car
Didn't get arrested, didn't have to kick off
I was alright but their car got writ' off
Just another day in the life of a lunatic
Rub me up the wrong way and you'll see me start losing it

[Hook]
Beep beep, coming through
Move over, yeah, you
Don't argue, just blur
Hurry up or you're gonna get hurt

You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (move)
I'll put you in an early grave

[Verse 3]
Move, when you see me coming down the road
Mind out, when you see me coming down the road
Couldn't give a shit when I'm driving down the road
This is a warning, you've been told

Like, neeyow, move over, neeyow, move over
Neeyow, move over, neeyow, move over

Travel with my lights in the day time
Everybody looking at me crazy - what?
I put my middle finger in the sky, I'm fucked
If I see flashing lights I just might not stop
Let's go for a joy ride, speed through the ghetto
I say "good bye" before I even say "hello"
I'm far from mellow, I don't want a chat
I get out my car and I give you a slap
Never mind all that cause you really ain't ready though
I'm so high I just want to hear my stereo
But I got my girl moaning in my left ear
There's a lot of stress so you better steer clear
Car just cut me up, I didn't take kindly
Plus I got this other silly bastard behind me
Had another beer, got to keep yourse'n smiley
Blimey, now I got to get grimey like...

[Hook]
Beep beep, coming through
Move over, yeah, you
Don't argue, just blur
Hurry up or you're gonna get hurt

You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (nah)
You don't wanna see road rage (move)
I'll put you in an early grave
