[Intro]
Future
The future of your nation
The future of your world
The future of your existence
Will all be decided now
Will all be decided here
There will be no second chances
Know yourself

[Verse 1]
Trying to navigate through
Positivity I'm only trying to gravitate, to
Spit fire when I salivate, true
And if I fall from grace land flat on my face will it validate, you
Black man with an attitude, whats, new
Looking out for the boys in, blue
And the green eyed monster, too
Trust few, these fools wanna push my buttons get checked on a rebound, then sue
I've got other shit I've gotta, tend, to
On my backside like the rents, due
Never really knew what a pen, could, do
Pent up and my problems, grew
Put pen to the paper, then, blew
Can't rush me like I just, blew
Got jet lag like I just, flew
In a pent house with a nuts, view
(?) said you bussed, who
I weren't buskin on the bus or tube
Just another sus and dusty dude
I ain't giving fucks so just, move
I ain't in a rush I just, cruise
You're a dumb fuck and you're not (?)
You numbnuts had enough, clues
No patience wanna just, cut, cues
I'll do anything, but, snooze
No ex-cuse, or such Ruse
I'll do anything, but, lose
Dont get it con-fused

[Hook]
I ain't stush
Thats focus on my moosh
I don't need no kush I push and one in the hand's worth two in the bush
I ain't stush
Thats focus on my moosh
I dont need no kush I push and one in the hand's worth two in the bush

[Verse 2]
Im not needy
I got everything i want in the game so easy
Why be greedy, i know you see me
I never thought i'd see the end of the CD
I never thought i'd see social media replace the TV
I want a TV looking all steely, so they can't read me
Whats the point if i can't even be me
You won't see me in the green mankini sipping a bellini
But wouldn't it be dreamy if i had money like Chuck Feeney spending it freely
In Santorini
I dont drink martini
I'm not Martin Shkreli
But I'm a scheming meanie
Step on the scene blacked out in a beanie giving out orders like Mancini, routinely
Big man and im setting the scenery
Set up the place all set in my ways won't let up the G in me
Sincerely
Got to keep it G thats the theory
No really
These breddas aing G i can see it so clearly
I swear on everything that i hold dearly
I try and keep all my nearest and dearest all cheery
You better hear me
I pay my taxes up-front yearly
Im from the L-D-N where the sky is dreary
Ive lost count of the times that i let it endear me
And all the locals cheer me
Its all love but you won't see me getting all teary
Test me it will get very eerie

[Hook]
I ain't stush
Thats focus on my moosh
I dont need no kush I push and one in the hand's worth two in the bush
I ain't stush
Thats focus on my moosh
I dont need no kush I push and one in the hand's worth two in the bush

[Outro]
What's Brexit?

Na I don't know whats that?
Sorry, you mean Brixton?
