That boy's arrogant, set for the chrome
Come barefoot like Fred Flinstone

Kidnapped, take 'em Rascal's hideout
Cold sweat, take a nap, get burnt out

[Verse 2]
Got a screwface all night, all day
Screwface keeps breddas at bay
Screwface means keep well away, stay away
Screwface means get out my way
Screwface means you don't know me
What you looking at, what's your beef?
Screwface means I'm not having it
Screwface means I'm not a chief
Screwface means I'm not happy right now
That's why no smile was used
Screwface means I'm not pleased
Screwface means I'm not amused
Screwface means I just wanna walk not talk
Screwface means I just wanna leave
When I activate my screwface, give me space
Screwface means let me breathe
I got sick flows, make an MC have to walk on his tip-toes
Life ain't always nice, that's how shit goes
You know we're going on black 'cos we're blick rows
And I can't be seen with these sick hoes
Where did I stay last night? I bet your chick knows
We were not knocking the boots, we kicked toes
Your girl's the same as all bimbos, freaks and nymphos
I've got an idea, make dough on the spot, I mean right here
Nike Air girls, I got paper for the whole year
You can bring drama 'cos I got no fear
And my head feels so clear
Move to the mic, MC's are like "oh dear"
Some try catching me up but they're not near
Not ever, not now and not here, way too hot here

[Outro]
Look, girls, ladies do the butterfly
Shake your batty low, shake your batty high
Don't ask me who, where, when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky
Girls, ladies do the butterfly
Shake your batty low, shake your batty high
Don't ask me who, where, when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky
