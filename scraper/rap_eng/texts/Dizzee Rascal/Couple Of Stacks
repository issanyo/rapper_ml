Couple of stacks'll put the boys on your back
Couple of stacks'll make the ratch go click-clack
Couple of stacks'll put the boys on your back
Couple of stacks'll make the ratch go click-clack
Couple of stacks'll put the boys on your back
Couple of stacks'll make the ratch go click-clack
Couple of stacks'll put the boys on your back

I'll kill you
I'll kill everything you stand for
Cause you're a bitch and a manwhore
I'll settle the damn score and more
About my own beef, I don't care about a gang war
Ain't hard to shoot
It ain't hard to fall
So what you waiting for?
I'll break your jaw
I'll take the law into my own hands
You wanna fuck me up? I've got my own plans
Keep running your cakehole
I'll have you buried in the ground like a potato
You better lay low
Fall back when I say so
I'll have you dressed all white wearing a halo
All I really give a damn about is the pesos
I let the devil take over
Believe I'm colder
And the chip on my shoulder
Is more bigger and bolder
And I'm out of control so don't say I never told ya

(Ma'am, are you alright?)

Think I'm some kind of cunt?
Think that I won't pull some kind of stunt?
Think that I won't leave some kind of lump?
Pull out the pump like it's that time of month?
And don't think I'm some kind of monk
Or a peacemaker, a deceased hater is the best kind
Don't wanna see me go blind
Don't cross the line
Cause it's about that time

No defence, I ain't sitting on the fence
I bust a head if I really want to vent
Or I could just kick back, be a gent
Or put a price on your head
That's money well-spent
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi

Stop chatting the place up
Don't mean I have to start smacking your face up
If I weren't doing this I'd be jacking the place up
Laced-up, on row, somebody's getting drapsed-up
Ready to take stuff
So pick up the pace
I stay on your case
Stacking my papes up
Keep a firm grip on the tool
I never break up
And I stand tall, I'm cool
I can never shake up

Feeling foolish if you raise up
A pool of blood, you got blazed-up
You got ahead of yourself
Just steady yourself
And you think you're heavy
But your really not ready
Just settle yourself
I suggest you fix up
If you skitz out it'll all be tits-up
R.I.P. you don't wanna get ripped-up and zipped-up
All cause you're running your lips up
Don't bother getting a mix up
Just stay in your lane
I'm fucked in the head
That's the way of my brain
And I'm insane
We ain't the same
So refrain from chatting my name for capital gain
Cause this ain't a game
When you're dead
They'll say it's a shame
Talking 'bout all you could have been if you weren't slain
And you've only got yourself to blame
So forget the fame
If you think I just entertain

No defence, I ain't sitting on the fence
I bust a head if I really want to vent
Or I could just kick back, be a gent
Or put a price on your head
That's money well-spent
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
