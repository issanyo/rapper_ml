[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo
I love girls (Girls)
I love sex (Sex)
I love cash (Cash)
I love cheques (Cheques)
I love mixed, blacks or whites
But I wish I had equal rights
I love rap (Rap)
I love dance (Dance)
I love soul (Soul)
I love trance (Trance)
I love music slow or fast
But I wish I woulda listened in class
I used to love acting dumb
Distracting classes, robbing fun
And I used to climb over the wall cah my friends weren't there and my paigons called
But I wish I woulda known what life was like before I left school
Believe me school don't lie
You really only get one try
Look
I love hot (Hot)
I love cold (Cold)
I love young (Young)
I love old (Old)
I love Thai, [?] or Dutch
But I wish I didn't think so much (Cah I wish)
I love old (Old)
I love new (New)
I love black (Black)
I love blue (Blue)
I love sound, sea and sun (Uh)
But I wish I had a lot more fun (Had a lot)
I used to love going to the park (Uh)
Run about, play about 'til it got dark
I used to love going to the fair (Fair)
But, me and my friends just sitting on the stairs (Trust me)
But I wish my area was still tight just like before (Uh)
Like life just seems so poor
'Cause no one ain't friends no more

[Chorus: Dizzee Rascal]
Now I deal with anger, pain, love, lust, rage, [?], hate, trust
Life's changed
So we must, stay on top
So we must, win
Pain, love, lust, rage, [?], hate, trust
Life's changed
So we must, stay on top
So we must, win

[Verse 2: Breeze]
End of the dark in the heat
Hyper and I'm always tired, around all night (All night)
Now you get bullied by the white boys (What)
What now, you don't wanna fight boys?
I'm a vandal, if you still can't handle
Randell, I run the triangle
Don't to the pissy four no more
So you can't come knocking to my door no more
Skippy, skippy in the city (What)
Better grab a coke 'cause it's 'bout to get nippy
I'm an OG man I used to rob chippy
And run home with bungle of [?] (Well)
Well next generation this and I still take the piss
And I'm still doing it from the left titty
It's a pity that I left this block but I still got tings on lock (What)

[Chorus: Dizzee Rascal]
Now I deal with anger, pain, love, lust, rage, [?], hate, trust
Life's changed
So we must, stay on top
So we must, win
Pain, love, lust, rage, [?], hate, trust
Life's changed
So we must, stay on top
So we must, win

[Verse 3: Flowdan]
When will I die (Die)
Is there a heaven or was that a lie (Lie)
Let me tell somethin' that I don't really mind (Mind)
Look 'cause I'm here I'll kill that with style (Style)
Whether it's now or the near future (Future)
Make sure you're burnin' wit' me shooter (Shooter)
Bullet proof vest and me silencer (Hah)
Go to the grace I keep it gangster
Six foot deep is where the badaman creep (Creep)
Bun [?] (See)
[?]
So watch your neckback, protect your neck please (Please)
[?]
Do your own ting but smoke a little weed
Before you start smoke, separate your seeds (Seeds)
[?]

[Chorus: Dizzee Rascal]
Now I deal with anger, pain, love, lust, rage, [?], hate, trust
Life's changed
So we must, stay on top
So we must, win
Pain, love, lust, rage, [?], hate, trust
Life's changed
So we must, stay on top
So we must, win
