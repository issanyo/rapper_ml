[Intro: Chrome]
Oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Come and dance with me

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
What's up darlin'?
I been keeping my eye on your movement
I can't see no room for improvement
Why you all over there on your Jack Jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbone
'Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it
I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it
One hundred percent, I'll make it perfect
You got a body to die for, let me merk it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I wanna take this further than the dance floor
I ain't forceful but I'm still hardcore
You're gonna give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're the boom ting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting
I'll never know if I just walk past
I really wanna dance so I guess I'll just ask

[Pre-Chorus: Chrome & Dizzee Rascal]
She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes, she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance with me, come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, come dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

[Chorus: Calvin Harris, Dizzee Rascal]
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, it goes on and on
I see you get excited like this is my song
You think I wanna get involved, you are not wrong
'Cause I been waiting for this moment all night long
So I creep, creep, creep back to your seat
I got my left eye checking out your scenery
I got my right eye right where it needs to be
Don't matter how I look at it, you look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it, that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but still
I love it when you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it
I'll feel like a wally if I don't pursue it
And I can't go through it, so let's get to it

[Pre-Chorus: Chrome & Dizzee Rascal]
She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes, she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance wiv me, come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me, come dance wiv me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

[Bridge: Dizzee Rascal]
I know you didn't come out to stand and stare
You bought new shoes and you did up your hair
You made a real effort tonight and it shows
I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone
'Cause the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it, I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just throw a couple shapes, put your skills on show, oh
Put your skills on show

[Chorus: Calvin Harris, Dizzee Rascal]
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
