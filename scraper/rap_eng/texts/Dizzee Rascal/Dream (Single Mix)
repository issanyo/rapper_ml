How am I gonna pull this off man with out soundin' dark?

This, this is too sensibly for me man

How you gonna have a dream come true?

I use to dream 'bout crazy little things like fame, in the days hangin' outside the off-license
We use to run around the streets reckless with no shame, mainly up too no good
A whole world a nonsense and when the girls walk by, we would try to catch their eye
And if they ain't a show face, we would act immature ova people
Tryed to tap me girl since I was a kid, a couple west girls on my radar, I was raw
And I was dead sure that I knew it all, whole world against me
Attitude I nearly blew it all, I find it a real big struggle, gettin' thru it all
I swear I didn't wanna listen cuz I sure didn't care
Not know if a reality I'd have to prepare, cuz money don't grow on no stick when it's rare
Me own bro was lukin' less than less the lick, plus I was growin' up, life was lukin like a scare

How you gonna have a dream come true?

I use to love music
It was like my hidden hobbie, but I couldn't get on local radio back then
So I went to north London, I travelled to Tottenham to be precise
And got some air time on Heat FM, then it escalated
I was gettin' ratings here and there and carried on until eventually I was everywhere
I started doin all the hot spots; Ministry, Ceaser's Palace, P Area
Tannin MCs, I did the grim and the glamour, I did the port and the plush
I didn't hang around, I wanted my money in a rush
Mind frame in the studio, dis stage no time to chat I didn't wanna engage
I found my self a new hussel, it was beautiful and non like the one before a bit more suitable
The more challenging it got the more I fought it
Made an album, over a 100,000 people bought it, thank you

Talk 'bout things you like, to, do

How you gonna have a dream come true?

To all the youngers cotching in the stairs in the flats
To the super star soccerlings, Beckham in the makings, you can go far
If you put your mind to it, you're a star
Don't wait to be told, just do it
Try and keep school in your plans, don't worry bout ur mans
They'll be there in the end if you're real
If they ain't, don't be makin' no effort to impress
You're fine the way you are, just do what you feel
Young baby mothers, yo I got your back as well
Young baby fathers ,hold it down for your girl
I ain't tryin' to preach but for what it's worth (what it's worth)
That kid's the next generation, planet Earth
Big shout to the world cuz I been all around (all around)
When I'm gone, I'm always thinkin' 'bout my home town
I'm from the LDN, no forgettin' that, and the big uk I stay reppin' that!
