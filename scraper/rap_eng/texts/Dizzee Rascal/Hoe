[Hook]
Yo, if she's got bare man up on that line
If she stays out in the clubs all night
If she takes dizz and the lines of the white
If she lets man take turns like a bike
Stop dat, drop dat, she's that hoe
She's on a loose ting, she can't roll
Bare man, bare guys on that phone
Mandem soak that, make that moan
If she's got bare man up on that line
If she stays out in the clubs all night
If she takes dizz and the lines of the white
If she lets man take turns like a bike
Stop dat, drop dat, she's that hoe
She's on a loose ting, she can't roll
Bare man, bare guys on that phone
Mandem soak that, make that moan

[Verse]
I'm like United five years ago
Or I'm like Fernando in a red kit
MCs wanna test this, get dead quick
Hit a man with the voltage and electric
Weigh up the food by the metric
120 on the M-way, Scalextric
If you really think you're gonna win, do a bet quick
Got flows to make your mandem press quit
Why? Cuh us man are monsters
Yeah, you niggas some plonkers
I had the strip on smash like conkers
Bait plugs free up the Zs like Bonkaz
If you try and flex and you're not on the radar
No long ting, man ah get rinsed like
Represent so it's not what you think
Front mode, man are chewed, attitude stinks
In beef, I go in like wet play
Violate and I'll dip man on a next day
I don't wanna turn shit to a movie
Like Link Up, SB or Press Play
No licence, that's a next case
[?] move, that's a next case
Buss champs, if it runs out, get a next case
My phone drops? Peak, next case
Punch man straight in the chest plate
You'll need a doctor's and an X ray
Go call your homeboy and SA
Neck inna ankle something like SA
Got fans online tryna holla man
Like "you're hard" and I'm like "ah yes mate"
Compliments calm and cool
But that's not paying for the food or the estate
I'm tired of these broke arse grime MCs
Who talk like they're one of the new school leaders
You just float in the scene like lilos
Rumble rapids and loved up beavers
If I catch man in his Air One beaters
He'll be like "help me", tryna run metres
You don't wanna get bored up and left
Outside Rinse FM, that's not fair on Geeneus
Yeah, yo, yo
I don't wanna start no war when I'm round
Spray with my mates, touring around
Shanks in the basement, bores in the ground
Tunes in the ends, recording around
Big up Capo, man had to run with his sound
Real quick, us man the talk of the town
Like Ice Kid, man'll get buss like rounds
AJ, I put the A in active
Told Ets pass me the wap and I wapped him
Man didn't really want beef, he was acting
Had a couple mates round me, never backed him
Got a couple models, it's irie
Think you can check it and wanted to come try me?
Hoes getting covered in webbing, I turn Spidey
Niggas tryna come with the jab like man's tiny
You see the twinkle, twinkle
Man better duck-duck-goose with the shank snake
AJ, you've got a lot of violent bars
Cause I'm always around violence, yeah
I'll buy mum trainers she won't wear
Too much food, yeah, and I won't share
We were broke and the times looked better
Now I've got a vendetta for my enemies here
