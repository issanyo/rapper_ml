I was in the e3vo playin pro evo
Gettin moved up and the score's four-zero
If I lose again I will surely regret it
Cuz this pussyole won't let me forget it
But it's no pressure I can take this boi
And if I don't win I'll break dis boi
I'm just rampin we've got an understandin
We could never be arms out that's ma brederin
Through thick and thin, rain sleet hail snow he's chippin in
If he's got a couple gash he'll bring me in
If he's got a bit of weed I'm smokin
I ain't jokin
From day one we was on this road ting
Now we're all grown up on the old ting
Kick back take it easy and slow ting
It's the kind of thing we're promotin
No job ting

(Chorus)

When I get lost
Feel I've been crossed
The man dem are my salvation
I take off my shoes
Fill up a zoot
And put on the playstation

So stop button bashing just pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
Stop chattin shit just pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
Hey no it's winner stays on blud pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
Don't be a prick blud pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad

High talk and ghetto conspiracies
Psychotic weed dealers smokin trees
Heated arguments all about the football
We're up all night like we're nocturnal
I can't be bothered to do anything but chill
And fuck the world outside that's how I feel
I've got a whole lot of time to kill
So fuck these bitches I'm just keepin it real

(Chorus)

(Instrumental)
