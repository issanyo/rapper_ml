[Hook]
To go minute after minute, to go hour after hour
We can't get this party started, until we have got the power

[Verse 1]
I wanna party 'till my last breath
'Till there ain't no air in my lungs left
I wanna party to death
In the club 'till I'm old like Hugh Heff
Switching other girls like "Who's next?"
I get a rise, switch it up like brunette
Look at Michelle, Kerrie-Ann and Juliette
Do I get involved? Yeah I buss a lil' 2-step, you bet
I'm just getting started, I ain't through yet
I'm looking for a girl with a body like an hour glass
She can shake her body on my body while I tap her's
She ain't gotta be a high class, just a nice arse
I just wanna see her rock her hips around the beat fast
Now I need a top up, gimme something for my beer glass
I don't give a ras', anything to make the night last
Now I'm feeling high on my rocket, ain't no stopping when I fly past
Money in my pocket, you ain't gotta ask

[Pre-Hook]
How we feeling?
Now everybody put your hands in the air
Clap those hands and sing it with me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girls on the right, fellas on the left
Party 'till the death, party 'till your last breath
Finger in the air if you couldn't care less
We're gonna party all night, we don't want no rest
Fellas on the right, girls on the left
Party 'till the death, party 'till your last breath
Finger in the air if you couldn't care less
We're gonna party all night, everything will be fresh

[Hook]
