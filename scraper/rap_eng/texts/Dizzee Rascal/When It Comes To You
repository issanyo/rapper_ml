[Verse 1: Margot]
I don't need the sun
I don't need the moon
I don't need that much
Cause all I need is darling, you

[Chorus: Margot]
And I don't think about it
And I can't live without it
And I don't think about it
Except when it comes, when it comes to you
When it comes to you
Except when it comes, when it comes to you

[Link x2: Margot]
We can't put this love down
We can't put this love down
Just roll round
Find the path to underground

[Chorus: Margot x3]

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
We can't put this love down, here what I'm saying?
I won't even bother running no game, just wanna be in the frame
And if you feel like every day is the same
I wanna be the one to give you a change, and in return
I want your heart and your brain, I know you're smart and I ain't gotta explain
Over and over again, it's pretty clear
With your heart, I just wanna be a part of the flame
And maybe one day I can give you my name
Maybe I'm jumping the gun a bit, just tell me you're loving it
And we can go AWOL, out of the public
Just for the fun of it, people say that we're rushing it, I'm rushing it
Tell a man [?] business
[?] hush a bit and have a few days off
We could just blaze away [?]
Or maybe you ain't ready to take off, it's fine
It don't matter to me long as you're mine, we'll never break down

[Chorus: Margot]
