Callin' all workers
Time to put your working on the dance floor
Stop moaning
I don't wanna hear nothing, let's go

And pro and so, it's off to work, I go
No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go
And pro and so, it's off to work, I go
No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go, okay

On top above all I flow Fabian way, beyond control
Lyrical pro, no, full time hustler out for the dough
Put my lifetime of grime in rhymes
Rudeboy, these are turbulent times

Some of you invest in Glocks or nines
I've seen no definite stop signs
On top above all and real, ain't afraid to show how I feel
Ain't afraid to kill bill, keep in touch with the stainless steel

Ain't too many doing it like bill
With all my concept hustling skill
Exceptional, respect me still
If not hold your corner and chill

And pro and so, it's off to work, I go
No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go
And pro and so, it's off to work, I go
No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go

On top above all I flex, come clear I don't fear whose next
(No)
Hot like tex mex but I gotta keep my cool to get cheques
Musics simple but its complex
Out of the blue everybody gets vex [unverified]
Tainted love without the corsets

On top above all I rain
Think of my heart I rule my own brain
Vigilant mind frame
That's the easy way to maintain

Otherwise go ahead act insane
If not do the best to obtain
Long jeopardy in this fucked up game
Extreme levels of pleasure and pain

And pro and so, it's off to work, I go
No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go
And pro and so, it's off to work, I go
No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go

Born in a quoir floss on the low
Flat broke never know
Forever grow, forever king
Trying without bling bling

Whatever long term hustler forever doe
Forever glow, superstar I've gone clear
To ever iroe solo your never near, I'm sincere
But fear, whatever name up for year I'm here [unverified]

Forever ill stick it and steer
Forever whatever the postcode or path
Let's not cross find out for a laugh
Your never gonna stop my graft [unverified]
I'm too clever don't be daft

And pro and so, it's off to work, I go
No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go
And pro and so, it's off to work, I go
No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go

Just listen to the lyrics, you don't need to ask for them
Use your ears, that's what I've just done
Maybe a couple of bits I got wrong
But fuck it, there is most of it
