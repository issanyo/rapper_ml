[Intro]
Inside, outside
Rah rah rah
Too many man talk nuff blah blah
Talk like Dizzee ain't got a temper
Hit em with the force like sky walker
Inside outside
Rah rah rah
Too many man talk nuff blah blah
Talk like Dizzee ain't got a temper
Yo! Look!

[Verse 1]
Dylan's on a hype now
I see he's doin' quite alright
I see his video the other night
How did he get a record deal
Chattin' like he's super-real
I see you on roman road market on saturday
You got battered [?]
Stabbin' in napa
What's the word on the street
Did he really slap her?
Is true that Wiley skipped the country left him?
Did he punch Mega in the face for tryin to test him?
I know he won a mercury award and brought it back to the estate
I know some breddahs in the manor hate an frequently debate
The way he makes moves
How he's steppin is he reppin
Cause they know he goes to Hackney
And they wonder what he's gettin
Plus I know he had that (well street yat)
The other day I see him leavin' Natalie's flat
He used to work dat south girl
Da mouthy one
What's his name's cousin
Still I know a couple girls are on it
I could name a dozen
But he ain't no player
Hes jus gettin' all the gash
Cause now they know he's got a little
Cash and a stash
That will keep him looking' pretty for the future in a flash
But little do they know he's only looking' for the lash
Cause Dylan's on a hype now!
Got his face on his t-shirt name on his trainers the iiidiot
He got a new era cap wit his logo
My bredrin's saw him tryin' on tracksuits in soho
I'm buyin' jackets from Benenni in LA
I heard he went to broadway
Limo driven through Queens
Is he livin' out his dreams is he ballin' - be truthful
Cause he ain't sittin' on the wall like he used to
He was on a thug tip at one point
He used to peel on bow road an take the foes (?) to Bethal Green
Next thing I hear him on the pirate radio scene
He used to do Deja, Ritz, and even Flava
Bought records off target and mixed for Adar (adar?)
Then worked his way to A list
It's funny cause the olduns used to dismiss
They never for a second anticipated this
No guts - no glory
Dylan took a risk took the piss now
Fellers wanna ask nigga if I reminisce on ..
Days when Dylan weren't all so criss
Still (crystal), they know Dylan put the game in a twist and
Dylan's on a hype now!
Worldwide interviews and business trips
Invitations to premieres and new flicks
And all the chicks got his name on their lips
A couple gunman kinda got him on the brain
And also the coppers wanna put him on frame
They're constantly watchin' so he better maintain
But he's getting' major money so he can't complain!

[Outro]
Inside, outside
Rah rah rah
Too many man talk nuff blah blah
Talk like Dizzee ain't got a temper
Hit em with the force like sky walker
Inside outside
Rah rah rah
Too many man talk nuff blah blah
Talk like Dizzee ain't got a temper
Hit em with the force like sky walker
