Rudeboy, don't watch that
'Cause if it's arms house, I'll rock that
And if it's on top, you know I got that
Come through with a big baseball bat

Like blood, don't make me get old skool
Blood, don't make me get old skool
Blood, don't make me get old skool
Blood, don't make me get old skool

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole

He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole

That's that bredder always frontin' like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always runnin' to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swingin'
First one runnin', makin' up stories, he's a chief

Bringin' bredders to the ends, actin' up
Puttin' on a show, tryin' talk funny to his friends
But he's really not a don, they know it
And you know it, so something must be seriously wrong

'Cause you're parrin', his mum calls you darlin'
But his brother has got you shottin' with no way of stoppin'
I heard you both had beef with an older brer
You took a spark and he just stood there

Now that boy's a pussy'ole, say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And that's the kind of shit that's gonna continue
But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole

He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole

The sun the biggest star in the sky
But naturally it's gotta make room for the moon every night
Everything's got its time limit, even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendship's tight

A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Can flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend an ex-friend for the P

A couple of years ago in my road youth days
I was into pirate radio, I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
Was a older in my ends and I thought he was the don

So I started rollin' with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothin' more than jealousy
But I wish I would've listened every time he told me

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole

He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole

Pussy'ole, pussy'ole
Pussy'ole, pussy'ole

Stay away from them pussy'oles, you can have it all
Live endlessly, tremendous, forever ball
Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall
But differently, know when not to lose your cool

'Cause it ain't what you show, it's what you're concealin'
Put a smile on the deepest negative feelin'

Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin'
Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin'
Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin'
Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin'

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole

He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole
