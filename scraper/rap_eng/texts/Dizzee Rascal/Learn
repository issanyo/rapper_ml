[INTRO]
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oi, the mic's very loud
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Like, who the fuck are you?
Yeah, who the fuck are you?
Is it recording yeah?
Yeah
Yo, look...

[Verse 1]
I come direct and I inject
And I'm expecting your respect
I'm a baller, you've been checked
I'm the kinda kid you can't detect on the road
You know out and about
I'll put my elbow in your mouth
You're a fassy, there's no doubt
I bet my sword will make you shout
I'm intense you best see sense
I'll have you hanging from a fence
Then laugh at your expense
And maybe chuck you fifty pence
Snitch you make me switch
You sound and look just like a bitch
Whether you're poor, or whether you're rich
I'll leave you lying in a ditch
'cos I'm from ragged raggo rags
You 'ain't raggo rags like me
I'll behave when I emcee
Ragged raggo raggedly
We easily be the worst
Bust academics first
Batty crew emcee's get academically reversed
I'm academically perverse
I'm academically perverted
Batty crew emcee's get academically diverted
Some return, we clearly get burnt get hurt
'til they realise they should have academically have blurted...

[Hook]
You don't want the beef
You don't want the grime
You 'ain't got the guts
I 'ain't got the time
But you can come to the manor get jacked
Come to the manor get killed
Come to the manor get shot
Come to the manor get killed
We call it armshouse, armshouse
Go and get your crew
If you can't back the armshouse, who the fuck are you?
We call it armshouse, armshouse
Go and get your firm
If they don't wanna listen then we better make 'em learn...

[Verse 2]
Raised in the gutter I was told I should fight
I create and cause confusion from the left to the right
I'm sweet as a nut, I'm doing alright, cosy and comfortable
'stead of trying to avoid the sergeant, PC, and the constable
Raised in the gutter I was told I should pop
I create and cause confusion from the bottom to the top
I'm doing okay, I'll honestly say this year I'm flying through
I could easily find myself in jail but I 'ain't trying to
I keep it clear and frank
Relax with the pressure
I'm dirty and I'm stank
But 'ain't nobody fresher
My haters make enquiries, make it obvious they care
When it comes to my location they would love to be aware
But I could be in the manor, could be overseas
Could well be definitely making P's
Could be live at Wembley warming up for Jay Z's
Still I'm definitely certain that you can't see me...

[Hook]
