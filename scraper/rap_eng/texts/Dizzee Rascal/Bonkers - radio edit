I wake up, everyday is a daydream
Everything in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep

And all I care about is sex and violence
And a heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says I got to get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man I'm just living my life
There's nothing crazy about me

Some people pay for thrills
But I get mine for free
Man I'm just living my life
There's nothing crazy about me

Bonkers

Mmmm yea man in(?) the floor now (floor now)
-get back in, back in!
