[Verse 1]

I got shit I wanna share with you
Couple things explaining reasons why I can't be there with you
Back in the day we parred and thought we'd never split paths
Didn't see no definite ending to the madness and the laughs
Never thought I would pack in the jackin' for something more solid
I ain't changed, I just found a better way to steer my knowledge
Running around hype and criminal antics fed me for a while
But studio gave me a lot more creative style
And took me to another world beyond the estate
Some kind of haven from the beef and some of the stress, mate
I wouldn't call it no escape, the roads are in my heart
Making it that more difficult for me to climb the chart (for real)
But it's the sacrifice I made, it's all good, star
Same reason I ain't always in the hood star
I do my thing, you know I'm grafting like I always was
It just ain't quite like it was, simply cause

[Hook]

There's world outside of the manor and I want you to see it
I can see it, I can see it
Can you see it? (x3)

[Verse 2]

Money, cars, guns and women most males desire
I gonna stay red-blooded til I expire
Not caught up in the hype, I'm caught up in the scheme of things
Seen a couple of figures but I still dream of things
Like the kind of shit money can't connect me with
Unconditional love I won't regret to give
I'm young, black, rich and ruthless, I swear, star
Still if you need a helping hand you know I'm there, star
I'm from the street, you're from the street, we all done dirt
Now it's time to flip the script, fuck the suffering and the hurt
Cause I've seen the bigger picture, it's all good
There really is a world outside of the hood

[Hook]

I know there's more than this man
There has to be more than this man
Nah there's gotta be more than this man
Standardly
There's gotta be somewhere other than this man
