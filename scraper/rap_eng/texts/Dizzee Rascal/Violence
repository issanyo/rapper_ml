[Intro: Footsie]
On the roads
It's greasy
Global warming, it's a warning

[Hook: Footsie]
Now, what do you know about violence?
Everyday on the roads, man's moving cold
And you know there's gonna be violence
After that, you're gonna hear sirens
Now, what do you know about violence?
Everyday on the roads, man's moving cold
And you know there's gonna be violence
After that, you're gonna hear-

[Verse 1: G-Man]
Look, I was born and raised in the gutter
So I can be a nice dude or I can be a nutter
Push my knife through your neck like butter
Stamp on your head till I see your face bruk up
Left, right, uppercut, now your jaw's bruk up
You can't gripse me up, I won't get had up
It's not that time, you will get stab up
It's not that time, you will get had up
I'll move to your whole team so you best back up
Samurai sword to your head, get hack up
You're not that guy, so you best shut up
You're not that guy, you'll get whack up
Mind your mout, rudeboy, then sprack up
Before it get heated and you get cap up
Left in a bodybag wrapper

[Hook: Footsie]
Now, what do you know about violence?
Everyday on the roads, man's moving cold
And you know there's gonna be violence
After that, you're gonna hear sirens
Now, what do you know about violence?
Everyday on the roads, man's moving cold
And you know there's gonna be violence
After that, you're gonna hear- (Dirtee Stanking)

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Violence ain't ever distant
But I can't say I'm resistant
When it's beef, I'm consistent
Come with it, I'm insistent
I really wanna be a good Christian
But I've got rage in my system
So fuck what you say, I ain't listening
Any boy test, I'll twist 'em
That's how I've been from day one
Couldn't take me for a gay one
Don't take shit from anyone
If you want beef, just say, son
With a 9 mil, I'm a top one
But I shoot better with a shotgun
I'll leave you with a hot one
Fear? I really ain't got none, now

[Hook: Footsie]
Now, what do you know about violence?
Everyday on the roads, man's moving cold
And you know there's gonna be violence
After that, you're gonna hear sirens
Now, what do you know about violence?
Everyday on the roads, man's moving cold
And you know there's gonna be violence
After that, you're gonna hear-

[Verse 3: Footsie]
In the hood, you know it's stirring
There's always violence occuring
Beef gets overcooked, it's burnin
Nothing's overlooked, I'm learning
'Nuff of these pussyholes ain't been earning P
Nah, they ain't got nuttin' on me
Rudeboy, I've got something on me
And if you really wanna try a ting, then you'll see it
Appear, do damage
Mandem are hungry, mandem are savage
Onto the violence, you'll get ravaged
Then carried away in an ambulance carriage
Don't get carried away, you can't manage
Cause you ain't the violent type
Stop all the violent hype
You're only violent on mic

[Hook: Footsie]
