[Verse 1: Ocean Wisdom]
Yo
Manifested this one
Man come through in all black and just nick something
Limelight robber, the limelight teefer
Dem man are busy bunnin’ on their reefer
They never got the memo
That a fellow from the south spitting ether
So either they deaf or they dumb, if neither
They’re mocking it, they’re rocking something silly for the feature
They’re gimmicky they’re relevant for now with no longevity
The remedy for that is how you body with them readily so woah
I ain’t got to study how another brother flow
Listen to a legend make a better rapper grow
Better for competitors that are living with a pro
Swinging with a donny you’re swinging with Ali G
Man’s really in a hurry to build up another lead
Brilliant and lovely looking at the esteemed
Considering every challenge resulted in their defeat
They beat the beat, I eat the beat
Then beat the beat, I treat the beat right
I beat the beat boss, betray me and die
You be the bocat, your head between thigh
Runnin’ on my (cuppa?) they be shutting down
She sucking on something and then she duckin’ out
I done a show with the baddest man about
I'll turn a gunner into a daffodil
Dem man dere holding Ls
Dem man ain’t holding Zs
And that’s fact
Dem man are already tell I’m on too much for them try rev
Like “Why you tryna rev?”
About revvin’ my face
On a Sunday
Till I hit man with a awkward leg
Awkward elbow, top of the head
Like boom baow, put him to bed
Like Joe Rogan said a man like me ain’t seen that in a thousand fights
Man got clocked with a vibrant right
And a hesitant left, is a man still alive?
Watch how I jump on the tune with Dyl
I'm the real deal, dem man all hype
Got a man feeling all Dillian Whyte
No dilly, no dally, I flick out the light

[Chorus: Ocean Wisdom]
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
About revvin’ my face on a Sunday
Till I hit man with a awkward leg
Awkward elbow
Top of the head
Like boom bow
Put him to bed
Why you try to rev?

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
How you gonna come and try rev
How you gonna act like I’m not ahead
And you’re stuck on the red
You’re easily read
Like you’re playing dead
I’m a rebel
I’m ready whenever my level is heavy
You’re light as a feather I beg
Beg you know I’m a celeb
But I’m dreading I’ll put you to bed
For some shit that you should have just thought but you said
‘Cause you’re a pleb
Only concern should be getting this bread
Are you pulling my leg
Gone in the head
Copper and lead
He drops and he bled
Go get a doctor and send for the med
You should have fled
Dearly departed
Look what you gone and you started
You bumbaclart
Should have been smart
But you were retarded instead
Use your brain
Don’t lose your lane
Maintain
Refrain from saying my name
And I’ll do the same
And everything’ll be right as rain
Don’t go against the grain
‘Cause I can get a little off the chain
Gassed up on my own no shame
Like I’m off the mains
They’re looking at me like I’m at the wrong stop
And I got no ticket
I just hop the train
What have I got to gain
I already gained the fame
I already got/copped the Range
I come through like Dr Strange
Tell the lane miss me with the games
I don’t entertain
Cocaine flow in your vein
But I bring the pain
Give me the long story short don’t make me strain
So I can see you all clear and plain
I’m not a plain Jane
I got Jane insane
Hopping on the cane
She give me top then I rock it again
She give me Brighton dome
I’m up bright and early
With a brighter bone
Even when I’m in Rome
I feel right at home
The beat got me in a tighter zone
I could have jumped at your hype
But I like my own
And I’m kind of grown
I heard Ocean Wisdom said somebody better get that boy on the phone
Let him do what he does
Don’t change one tone
Just leave him alone

[Chorus: Ocean Wisdom]
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
About revvin’ my face on a Sunday
Till I hit man with a awkward leg
Awkward elbow
Top of the head
Like boom bow
Put him to bed
Why you try to rev?

[Verse 3: Ocean Wisdom]
Eighteen I was eight deep
With a break beat
Lately manna make P
From a G
Hopefully manna wrote down a couple notes on me
Oh did he not
He don’t know about me
Okay, locally manna know of me
And then globally fandem’ll roll for me
Hours on a beat
Okay mandem on a show for me
They’re a nobody
With the way they facilitate what I do bait
And a anecdote for me
Would be high road for me
And I didn’t ride out on a wasteman wave
That’s a woah woah buddy
You should body down for me
I’ll be showing you the ropes
When you trying to just rave
Why help bodies that are not that gully
When you could be summoning the best of the greats
No sales dummy
That is not that funny
When you got to rely on the O for the cake
Still fuck it then I fornicate the day away where I get up and I made a (pip?) and then I get to press it on her puss
Luckily the way they gravitate to what I’m doing got them reaching in their pockets, dedicated to the cause
‘Cause they feel a man and follow man and run around the city
Like an animal I put them on their paws
‘Cause the mandem want to draw
As they thought they was I’m on a Wu-Tang vibe on tour
Bill a spliff and let me talk
I ain’t fiddlin with pork
Licking on her loin
Ripping something raw that’s savagery
Man’s been on it since Mark and Valerie
This bar cost man calories
Smash and attack
Eubank swag get a bang in the mouth
Junior swag hold 25 more
Wiz be a fan of just having it out
I run up a tab I told them the score

[Chorus: Ocean Wisdom]
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
Why you try to rev?
About revvin’ my face on a Sunday
Till I hit man with a awkward leg
Awkward elbow
Top of the head
Like boom bow
Put him to bed
Why you try to rev?
