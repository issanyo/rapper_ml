Summer in the city
Such a very special time
If you put aside the traffic
Air pollution and the grime
You be pleased to be reminded
That the girls are looking fine
And apart from money
That's the only thing that's on my mind
Short skirts, belly tops, fake tan
String vests with the bra underneath
So the man's getting hard off
Of half of a glimpse
I got plans to be scooping up
A couple buff tings if I can
If I can't then I'm still live
I go and check
My little yappy by the seaside
'Cause I know she's live
Plus she's a dealer
She gives me hospitality
She treats me right
That's what I need right?
And if not, then I'm on
A little mission to Los Angeles
To check my Beverly Hill honey
To see I she can handle this
Pimping ain't no easy thing
And some of these chicks are scandalous
But I'm a player and I say
I gotta be the man for this, I love you
I don't believe in fate
Life is what you make it
Make it great, I'm tryna elevate
Concentrate on getting
My papers straight
Survive the great escape
From the ends I use to congregate
Until I could no longer wait
I had to find the bruvas
Otherwise I would have been worthless
Making fast on the estate
Ignorant to what the earth is offering
When I should take
Every chance and every opportunity
To try and make
Every second and every breath
Of life something to celebrate
So I been around the world now
Close to the occasional boast
Different folks, different strokes
Black, white and asian
All these ladies look incredible
Still got me gazing
Riding jet skies, on power boats
Feel so amazing
Club popping in Ibiza
I got Pacha on lock
Pull up right outside the entrance
In the Hummer, people glare
Then they stop, stare and wonder
Who I am and who I'm not
I just take it in my stride
But I ain't never felt this hot and I love you
