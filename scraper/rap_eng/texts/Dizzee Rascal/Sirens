[Hook]
Blud when you hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming
Better run when you hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming

[ Verse 1 ]
One-to-the-two-to-the-three-to-the-four
Limehouse police knocking at my door
Twelve black boots on my bedroom floor
What they want with Rascal I'm not sure
Took me to the station 8:30
For a fight that I had recently
Say they got me on CCTV
And a pussyole boy's told on me
Can't understand why these brers keep snitching
Can't understand why these brers keep bitching
Now I'm hot tempered, feel like switching
Can't stand still, trigger finger itching
Gotta stay calm, gotta keep my cool
If I go jail, I'll be a damn fool
Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall
Can't let them see the end of Dizzee Rascal

[Hook]

[Break]
Yo man, let's take it back to that old-school storytelling shit
Get me?

[Verse 2]
One day I was with my bredren Adar roaming the street
On the main road, hungry looking for something to eat
Not no burger and no chips, shit that's easily digested
It's that shit that if you re caught you'll be easily arrested
We was on a robbing spree, I forgot to mention Clayton
Was this bredder rolling with us, he was scared and it was blatant
He was prang but back to the story, Adar spotted a man
Straight ahead of us in the distance with his wifey holding hands
So we followed them through this little alleyway into the flats
When we thought the time was perfect, we crept up and we attacked
I took the first swing, unexpected causing panic
We was ruthless causing agony in public, it was tragic
Me and Adar lost the plot, acting like we was from Hell
Beat this bredder to the floor, moved his wifey up as well
Clayton stood back shaking, wishing that he'd never came
Then from out of nowhere was Alicia screaming out my name
She went my school, she saw it all, and by this time, she's crying
And to make it worse I'm hearing sirens, I ain't even trying to hang around

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I can hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming
I break the law, I will never change
I break the law, I will never change
I break the law, I will never change
Step into my zone, get your whole face re-arranged

[Verse 3]
See me on the telly but I ain't no actor
Running through the street bait-faced, it's a jackwa
Broad daylight, no shame like a lunatic
Rain, hail, sleet or snow, I ain't new to it
Show me what you got, better give it up quickly
Lay them on their back if they chat back swiftly
Better mind out when they come through the manor, man
Keep them on their toes like Hammer, man
It's no joke, man, woman, and child I'm seeking
See, no sex, no age, I'm creeping
Anything for the dough, code of the wheelers
Duck from the feds and I roll with the dealers
Par with the hard heads and young offenders
No, my life ain't nothing like EastEnders
Step into my zone, get your whole face re-arranged
I break the law, I will never change
