Looks like I'm losin' friends
There's a lot of hostility in my ends
We used to argue, always make common new friends
Now we settle disagreements with the skenz
Looks like I'm loosin' mates
There's a lot of hostility near my gates
We used to fight wid kids from other estates
Now 8 millimeters settle debates
Looks like I'm loosin' sight
'Cause I'm lookin' at the future, it ain't right
So I look out my window, pray every night
I thank God 4 my friends but they ain't tight
Looks like I'm loosin' hope
'Cause I climbed dis mountain without rope
But I know I'm the captain of my boat
So I steadily sail and hope not to float
But it's a brand new day
With new opportunities, what can I say?
I plan to make my pay
But put sum away for an off key day
But it's a brand new day
With new opportunities, what can I say?
I plan to make my pay
But put sum away for an off key day
Demand, collect, cash upfront and direct
Pay money, pay respect, don't insult my intellect
Demand, collect, cash upfront and direct
Pay money, pay respect, don't insult my intellect
When we ain't kids no more
Will it still be about what it is rite now?
Like fightin' for anything, anytime
And actin' without a care anywhere
When we ain't kids no more
Will it still be about what it is rite now?
Like back scams, street robbery
Shottas, plottas or HMP
When we ain't kids no more
Will it still be about what it is rite now?
Pregnant girls who think they love
Useless mans with no plans
When we ain't kids no more
Will it still be about what it is rite now?
'Cause negative signs just keep showin' up
Sum of us betta just start growin' up
But it's a brand new day
With new opportunities, what can I say?
I plan to make my pay
But put sum away for an off key day

When I look at my life I can't help but think
'Cause I could have resorted to drugs and drink
Everyday was the same as the day before
We were never quite sure of what's in store
Everyday I wake up I can't help but feel
I'm certain of life, I mean dis is real
Mouthfuls skippin' 'round my head like dancers
I know it's wrong to question but I need answers
Da whos, da whats, da hows, da whens, da whys
You can look in my face, you see da pain in my eyes
I hope dat I put my feet down and rise
'Cause guys wanna test my words
So I can't just cater for 2nd and 3rd
Plus I know predators only go for the weak
And dat's long so I gotta stay strong
Get me
