[Intro]
Oh, it's real out here
Like no one understands sometimes
If people could see what's really going on
Like people are just, just going mad in front of me, you get me
Everyone's growing up too fast, I swear
Feds don't understand us, adults don't understand us
No one understands us
We just live do what we do like, it's real
It's Raskit, shout out to all the mandem
Yo, I'm repping, I'm trying (listen, yo)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep forever
I spend my whole life tryna pull myself together
Tryna reassure myself that I ain't going mad
I gotta come to a conclusion, it's now or never
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for years
I've been through anger, pain, blood, sweat and tears
You'd think that any kid in my position would be glad
Quite the opposite; more worries - more fears
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for days
It's like I've lost the love, I'm only in it 'cause it pays
I find myself back on road, things are getting bad
More and more I'm going back to my old ways
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for good
And if I had the guts to end it all, believe I would
It's getting boring always being miserable and sad
Shit, I would love to be polite, I really wish I could
But life's pressures often get me down
Sometimes I feel there's not a lot to smile about, so I frown
And I talk a big whole heap of badness
Because my life's a big whole heap of madness
I've seen a lot, maybe more than I can take
Under pressure everyday trying not to break
But I'll survive 'cause it's what I do best, get me
I'm a challenger, put me to the test

[Hook]
Sleep tight, everything will be alright
By the end of the night will be the day, just pray that you see it
Strong you gotta be it, if you wanna get through it
Stretch your mind to the limit, you could do it
Sleep tight, everything will be alright
By the end of the night will be the day, just pray that you see it
Strong you gotta be it, if you wanna get through it
Stretch your mind to the limit

[Verse 2]
It's almost like I've got the world on my shoulders sometimes
Yo, I struggle sometimes, you know I'm hating petty crimes
But we lived in hard times
No one to turn to and no one to talk to
Life's like a doorway, everybody walk through
Everybody's talking, but nobody's listening
Everyday some new shit, week out and week in
All this negativity, why they tryna get at me?
All up in my life (rrah) Where'd you get the energy?
I don't feel well, but you still bother me
You're giving me a headache man, you might as well just clobber me
Blud lately I've been lonely, but you only phone me
When you want a favour, then you wonder why I'm moany
Don't really ask much, so I don't owe much
Don't receive a lot of love, so I don't show much
But the little that I do I put it in this song for you
Handle your business 'cause I do, listen

[Hook]
Sleep tight, everything will be alright
By the end of the night will be the day, just pray that you see it
Strong you gotta be it, if you wanna get through it
Stretch your mind to the limit, you could do it
Sleep tight, everything will be alright
By the end of the night will be the day, just pray that you see it
Strong you gotta be it, if you wanna get through it
Stretch your mind to the limit, you could do it

[Outro]
Shout to all the youngas
E3, do your thing, but swear to use school
Get me, you come out of school, it's real out here
(Raskit from Bow E3, that Dizzee Rascal from Bow E3)
(Don't worry) Shout to everybody still hustling
(Think I ain't got you in mind, don't worry)
Make it, focus, I swear to you, you could do anything
(Dizzee Rascal's from Bow E3) Real
I need to talk more
