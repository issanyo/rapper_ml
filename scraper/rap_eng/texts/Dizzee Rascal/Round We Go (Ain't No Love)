Ah you got me
I love you
It's not a love ting right now
Cuz if you love me I just love you too
Or it just ain't den
I'll love you, love you, love you
Love you like oyu love me too
(Background music)
Ain't no love ting here
Its just one big cycle here
Ain't no friendship here
Its just one big cycle here
Round, Round, Round we go
Round, Round, Round we go
Round, Round, Round we go
If you love me let me know
Round, Round, Round we go
Round, Round, Round we go
Round, Round, Round we go
If you love me let me know
Dizzee Rascal yo
She use to love him
He use to love her
She use to kiss him
He use to hug her
Call it deep love
Or puppy love
Dey bunked off skool
Now there's no flame
Thing's ain't the same
Looks like she changed
Thinks it's sum game
Hes left in the rain
Tryin to pwoi blame
Took for a fool
