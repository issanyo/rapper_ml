[Hook]
If you wanna get by
You better not come shy
You can whinge and cry
Til' your eyes get dry but it still won’t fly
They throw dirt on the sly
I ain’t even gotta try
And when they wanna know why
And they need a reply
I ain’t even gonna lie

[Verse 1]
I ain’t even gonna lie
I want a piece of the pie
They told me reach for the sky
I said each to their own if you wanna get high
Gonna get high on my own supply
I can’t rely on a guy
I don’t even wanna pry
And my pride’s at an all time high
Bare priors, an’ I’ll provide
Provide the vibe inside (inside)
And the vibe is wide
Worldwide, get down where the hell can I hide?
They can’t deny or divide the cypher
I’m so live I’m a survivor
Rough rider, east sider
Spit fire, saliva on ya
You know the runnins
Can’t be summin, I’m slummin
I done rolled through the slums in somethin’ stunnin’
Stunted once and the cops keep coming
What are you bunnin?
Flew to Jamaica
Tryin’ to have fun and get a little bit of sun in
Thugs at the entrance tryna get the gun in
Man are so wicked and cunning

[Hook]
If you wanna get by
You better not come shy
You can whinge and cry
Til your eyes get dry but it still won’t fly
They throw dirt on the sly
I ain’t even gotta try
And when they wanna know why
And they need a reply
I ain’t even gonna lie

[Refrain]
I ain’t even gonna lie
I ain’t even gonna lie
I ain’t even gonna lie
Why lie? I’m the guy
One finger in the sky
I ain’t even gonna lie
I ain’t even gonna lie
Top guy, I don’t beg no bly

[Verse 2]
Bookie
Stay on duty they can’t spook me
Salue they can’t mute me
And the beg friend ting don’t suit me
They can say what they want but they can't uproot me
I’m en route in a coupe going loopy
And I’m in it for the booty
I said I’m in it for the loot, I ain’t talkin’ bout a groupie
Excuse me, cos I refuse to lose and these girls are choosy
Suzie got a little woosie had a little booze and a doobie
Movin’ unruly, had a little boogie
Suzie’s a little too boujee but she wants to move with the goonies
She don’t want a smoothie
Truthfully, she don’t wanna go to the movies
Wanna get a million views on her boobies
Oi
Don’t get lost in the sauce
Get caught off course
Of course I’ve mastered the force
Hop of the porch, I’m horseless off in a Porsche
I’m often soaring abroad
Boppin' aboarder, lord of the world explorin’ the shore
Sure I’m a baller, all in boy in da corner
I don’t gotta warn ya

[Hook]
If you wanna get by
You better not come shy
You can whinge and cry
Til your eyes get dry but it still won’t fly
They throw dirt on the sly
I ain’t even gotta try
And when they wanna know why
And they need a reply
I ain’t even gonna lie

[Refrain]
I ain’t even gonna lie
I ain’t even gonna lie
I ain’t even gonna lie
Why lie? I’m the guy
One finger in the sky
I ain’t even gonna lie
I ain’t even gonna lie
Top guy, I don’t beg no bly
