[Intro: Dizzee]
Scared men can't win (oh no, fuck it)
Scared men can't win (oh no, fuck it)

[Verse 1: Dizzee]
Cold-blooded and heartless
I spar with lost souls in the darkness
I shine bright regardless, and hit 'em with the sharpness
I don't wanna be another carcass
A lot of broken dreams and war stories
Obsessed with freedom or glory
Sick state of mind, still I stay on the grind
Can't keep the feeling up, surely
No god, no love, no loyalty, money spoilt me
And I've seen more dirt than a toilet seat
Everybody wanna live like royalty
But nobody wanna pay the price, they wanna take a free slice
It's weak to be nice, and cool to be cold as ice
So I just roll the dice, looking for snake eyes
With breddas who take lives so you better take five

[Chorus: Dizzee]
Scared men can't win
So I roll with the winners (oh no)
More money, more sin
Yeah, I roll with the sinners (fuck it)
Scared men can't win
So I roll with the winners (oh no)
More money, more sin
Yeah, I roll with the sinners (fuck it)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win (oh no)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win (oh no)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win

[Verse 2: Merky ACE]
In the Blue, man ain't no stranger
You'll get boxed in the mouth just like Bally Ranger
When I touch down, it's danger
Don't believe in babies in mangers
I put my trust and my faith in the stainless
Mother is god, devil is me
Cradle to the grave, been so FT
Ain't no man's slave, I make my own P
Yeah, I've got a good link so it does come cheap
Well that ain't for you, it's only for me cuh
You're a mess like a [?] in a black dress
Me and them ain't blessed, you can never try test
Not even with a vest cause I aim for the neck
Or aim for the head, fuck chest
Real life come like a game of chess
Man will get G checked if they don't move correct

[Chorus: Dizzee]
Scared men can't win
So I roll with the winners (oh no)
More money, more sin
Yeah, I roll with the sinners (fuck it)
Scared men can't win
So I roll with the winners (oh no)
More money, more sin
Yeah, I roll with the sinners (fuck it)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win (oh no)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win (oh no)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win

[Chorus: Dizzee]
Scared men can't win
So I roll with the winners (oh no)
More money, more sin
Yeah, I roll with the sinners (fuck it)
Scared men can't win
So I roll with the winners (oh no)
More money, more sin
Yeah, I roll with the sinners (fuck it)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win (oh no)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win (oh no)
Scared men can't win
Scared men can't win
