[Hook]

My hat is low, my trousers too
And people say that I'm too rude
But I don't care cause I'm the shit
So you can all just suck my dick
Just suck my

[Verse 1]

When I was a kid I had a chip up on my shoulder
It ain't getting better even though I'm getting older
People get offended by the way I talk so freely
Pushing up their face and acting funny when they see me
But I'm raggo, damn it, so I say fuck it
If you don't like the way I do my thing, then you can suck it
I really don't give a shit, I really don't care for your approval
I'm a fucking G, I'll carry on doing my shit as usual
Cause

[Hook]

[Bridge]

You know I mean, man?
I'm just trying to be me, man
I'm just trying to be free, man
Whagwan man, let me be, man
What's the problem?
Ya get me?
I don't apologize for nothing

[Verse 2]

I try to act right, I try to be polite
But I can't take no shite, you best believe I might
Just punch you in your moosh, I war like Georgy Bush
No need to keep it stush, it's best if you just shush
And stay out of my way cause I don't wanna play
Sorry, what did you say? Alright whatever, mate
I don't give a shit who likes it, I don't give a shit who don't
Don't tell me to change my fucking attitude because I won't

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Bingo, I got the lingo
Come through your window
Starr like Ringo
Beef, chat bout?
I'm involved
Keep near danger like Penfold
Dylan, Lincoln estate, man
Yeah I'm straight, man
Everything's great, man
Talk low it, can't shake, man
Why bother, wait, man
Come and take man, waisman
Come and get me
Killers respect me
You can't sweat me
I'm the One like Jet Li
So come check me
Who wanna wet me?
Fuck that! Suck someone
On a dumb one
I'll touch someone
Try and test Raskit, what a bumbum
Rudeboy, I don't care about no one
