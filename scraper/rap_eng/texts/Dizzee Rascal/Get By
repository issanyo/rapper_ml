[Intro: Dizzee Rascal]
To each n every kind
(London ghetto, Birmingham ghetto)
Every ghetto frame of mind
(Manchester ghetto, Newton ghetto)
To each 'n' every kind
(Leeds ghetto, Liverpool ghetto)
Every ghetto frame of mind
(UK ghetto, East London ghetto)
To each of every kind
(North London ghetto, West London ghetto,)
Wiv a ghetto frame of mind
(South London ghetto)
To each 'n' every kind
It's rasket, wiv a ghetto frame of mind
Look yo

[Verse One: Dizzee Rascal]
We grew up in da ghetto, where summertime's short
Straight action, you don't stop for a thought
Most use crime as a way to pay the bills
The unlucky ones end up gettin' caught
We grew up in da ghetto, where the goin' gets rough
Money's been around, but it's never been enough
Most ain't given no choice but to hustle
Some break down when the going gets tough
Deep in da manna, there's all kinds of different people
Minorities still struggle to be equal
So many characters, four main types
The good, the bad, the ugly, 'n' the evil
Deep in da manna, where da poverty's visible
There's not a lot sweet, so most look miserable
Most cave in to the devil, took the wrong path
Some kept their faith, 'n' still pray for a miracle
Soccer stars emerge from da curb
Up 'n' comin' MCs struggle to be heard
Boy dem, dey searchin' for da next jailbird
Fuck, talk, murder 'n' they live by their word

Shotters keep da money goin' round
Kids go astray, most never get found
I've noticed there's a ghetto in every town
'N' the skies are empty, because da stars are on da ground

[Chorus: Vanya]
Sometimes I'm lost, look up at the sky
Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by
Sometimes I'm lost, askin' myself why
Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by

[Verse Two: Dizzee Rascal]
We grew up in the ghetto, saw real life pain
Real life struggle, wiv real life strain
Real life kiddies, wiv real life guns
'N' real life mothers lose real life sons
Gang wars erupting on the dance floor in Seasons
Beef after beef, jus' to be da top geezers
Big arm slash, hit da Stratford Rex
Ghetto high brudas, gotta maintain reps
What's that all about, I ask my self before I swing
More time, I'm beefin' over any little thing
Beef in any area, region or vicinity
My ghetto frame of mind makes me prone to hostility
To many brethrens locked up, too many young baby mothers
Each 'n' every crew n colour, ghetto sisters and brothers
If you know your from da slums, keep reppin' no doubt
Stay ghetto if you must, just remember to get out

[Chorus: Vanya]
Sometimes I'm lost, look up at the sky
Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by
Sometimes I'm lost, askin' myself why
Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by
Sometimes I feel to cry, look up at the sky, get by
