[Intro]
Hello, hello and welcome
My name's Dizzee Rascal
They call me Rascola or sometimes
They call me Rasket
Formally The Boy in da Corner
If you're here for the first time
I'd like to tell you a bit about
What this is, this is, you know
Whatever you make it
Whatever you perceive it to be
Serious, aha
Dizzee Rascal, London's finest

[Verse 1]
This journey starts 6 years ago
In run-down housing estate in Bow
East London south-east UK
Was a young man lets call this young man Ray
Frustrated with being around the way
Would say "i'm bored" until one day
Gathered up sum change and in exchange
Got turntables off tony
Not only were they whack, they were wooden
But he took 'em
Cause it was a bargain and it was a good'en
And he said to himself "who wouldn't?"
Why not, then he took a little trot to DJ Targets spot
Stood outside of the door and knocked
Asked what jungle records you got
Must be something you wanna get shot, off, blot
Didn't buy beats, he ready to quit, gave him the whole lot
Then Ray had little click, they were hot
Young gun soldiers, but it all flopped
Still it didn't make ray wanna give up the fight
Ray just picked up the mic, would write
Lyrics while excluded
No glitz and glamour included
Like crime for money, dough
Crime pays, didn't you know
Even though ray come across slow
Broke shit down, brung another new flow
Made beats in the back room
Teacher gave him a little spare time
Then they got a little bit of radio airtime
1 AM til 3 be in school by 9
This was clearly a positive sign
Learning bout beats breaks and bars
Didn't chat about champagne and cars
More concerned with you know, the grime
Made it a touch difficult to shine
Among these so-called underground stars
Some resented him thus presenting
Him with pure dumbness like retards
It didn't matter, Ray would say, "OK"
I'm gonna be a real star one day
Went through dramas along the way
But he stood firm pressed on with the wordplay
Went through dramas along the way
But he stood firm pressed on with the wordplay
Went through dramas along the way
Let's take a look at Ray today
Today, today, today, today, today...
Showtime! It's Showtime
