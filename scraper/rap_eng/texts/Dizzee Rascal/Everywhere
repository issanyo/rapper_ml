[Intro]
I ain't on a hype ting
Just out here trying to do the right thing
And even though you know I don't mind fighting
When I will, it's cash money like lightning
You know I (gotta get that dough) I ain't ramping
(Gotta get that dough) damn right
(Gotta get that dough) I ain't ramping
(Gotta get that dough) straight up

[Verse 1]
Hot taste, charisma, stylie, we got plenty
Cruising in the Punto on the way to Bentley
Evidently far from gently eating up the roll
We act immaturely in a hurry to be old
In fact we'll leave you poorly, catch a beating like a cold
Go ahead profile and flex like you're big, bad and bold
Go ahead go round your next to get hit, had and showed
Stay out the paper chase, floppy fellas fold
Neglect the rules, respect the codes, follow the guide lines
Life's been ugly so far but these are fine times
I write below the belt, I bust average fine rhymes
I always had to be a star, my city saw the signs
I try not to be stupid with my fame
But constantly I sense fassies being clever with my name
Indirectly call my name like they're calling my bluff
So sadly I often sense the need to get rough

[Hook]
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
I'm all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
It's all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
I'm all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
So move over, ya nahmean?

[Verse 2]
Full of strife, that's life, deal with how bad it is
Reminisce, reflect, revise on how bad it could have been
Abuse time and find out how mad it is
Time waits for nobody, handle your biz
Extortionists would love to man-handle this
I'm ignorant, refuse to understand what extortion is
Jack me and get what? Jack me and get where?
Get zilch times zero, times nothing plus air
Yeah, I'm way beyond care
Hate me or love me, try not to stare
Your thoughts and your opinions try not to share
I show interest on an occasion that is rare
Plus I ain't in the hype, I'm above it and I cause it
Can't put a stop to the track but I can pause it
So play your role, act tough, put on your show
I'll let the ratchet be your audience, bullets will applaud it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My name is Dizzee Dizz, I handle my biz
My spreaders talking gangsta, don't know what a gangsta is
They ain't ready yet, I don't claim a set
But if you test I'll leave you with something you will regret
I'm 5'10", slim, chocolate skin
I'll punch you in your nostrils, I'll punch you in your chin
But I ain't mad, I'm a lovely lad
I'll give you the loveliest beating that you've ever had
Rude boy, home boy better chill
You know I don't watch no face cause I'm real
I don't care if you're sick, I don't care if you're ill
My foot will add a nice frill to your ice-grill
Son dun-duddy, I don't find shit funny
If you ever try and go against the flow of my money
Word is bond, what's really good, I'm really hood
Take this song as a caution, you really should

[Hook]

[Outro]
Try copy we
Hit her with the G, condo energy
Lyrical tank, lyrical pedigree
Bastard or wee on girl Emily
How bad they wanna try copy we?
Hit them with the G, condo energy
Lyrical tank, lyrical pedigree
Dizzee Rascal from the big LD
(Hey yo)
(Do you hear me?)
(Hey yo) (do you hear me?)
(Gotta get that dough)
(Gotta get that dough)
(Gotta get that dough) (Hey yo)
(Gotta get that dough)
