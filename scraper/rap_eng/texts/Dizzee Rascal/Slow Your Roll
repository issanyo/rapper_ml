[Verse 1]
Tell them boys to stop over-fussin’
Tell them boys there ain’t no discussion
Tell them boys I heard it all before
It ain’t new to me you gotta show me suttin’
Act up fore I blow or suttin’
Blow for blow
Toe to toe
I run my own show
But I am not known for duckin’
Tell my homeboys to roll me suttin’
Standin’ out in the cold is cuttin’
Reminiscing on back in the day before Isle of Dogs and E3 was shootin’ broad day and riskin’ lives over nothin’
Them boys were like older cousins
Went away I came back I heard it went mad but I could not speak cos it was too peak I had to just hold my tongue in
Shoulder shruggin’
Lookin’ over my shoulder
Told ‘em slow your roll when the roads are gunnin’
On top and the show was runnin’
These times it was over-numbin’
All's fair when it's love and war
Bredders actin’ all cold an' cunnin’
I was focussed on my dough was comin’
Deep down I knew my soul was bunnin’
Sting a bee in a sling they stung him
Couple shots came through went wrong
Held one, he survived the stunnin’
Payback gotta at least gotta get one in
No point tryna talk ‘em down
Can’t tell these negros nuttin’
Like

[Hook]
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
And let the foolishness go
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
There’s more to life than you know
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
And let the yout dem grow

[Verse 2]
Youngers takin’ up arms
Youngers out to do harm
Like it’s Afghanistan
Switchin' up garms
Kickin’ up drama
Gotta handle these qualms
Chip at the top of their arm
Someone ring the alarm
Ringin’ shots on the calm
Nothin' left in their eyes
Lost the love and the charm
Ain’t no Quran
And they’re mentally scarred
They ain’t wishin’ on stars
They ain’t readin’ no psalms
Or prayin for peeps, they’re playin’ for keeps
Futures bleak
They keep the heat in their palms
Compete and beef for postcodes and streets they don’t even own yards
Best believe they go hard
So bredders got locked up
Cos there ain’t no pot luck
The developers rocked up
Settin’ up shop got the whole place locked and it all went and it all got copped and the hood got chopped and the natives cropped and the ends got boxed up, then the price got knocked up
Foreign investment raising the stock up
So the rent got propped up
And it kept gettin’ topped up
So the heart got ripped out and rinsed out
Some got shipped out, got kicked out
Few of them stayed but the rest just dipped out
Took the quick route
Power, money and big clout is what it’s about

[Hook]
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
There’s more to life than you know
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
Slow your roll and get dough
And let the yout dem grow
