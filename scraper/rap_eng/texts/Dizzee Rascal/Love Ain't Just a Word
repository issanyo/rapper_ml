[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
You say love is just a word
But I really mean it
A four-letter verb I put in a sentence
To show my true feelings
If love's just a word
Why would it mess with my breathing?
And just like the air, you can't see it there
But we know we need it

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Love ain't just a word
And I really mean it
A four-letter verb I put in a sentence
To show my true feelings
If love's just a word
Why would it mess with my breathing?
And just like the air, you can't see it there
But we know we need it

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Cause love ain't just a word
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Cause love ain't just a word
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Love can change the world
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Cause love ain't just a word
We know we need it
Cause love ain't just a word

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
It's in my heart, you could feel it there
It's written in the stars, you could see it there
But we should make it last cause the feeling's rare
The feeling's rare, yeah
We could turn it into ours, sing it everywhere
When love ain't in the dark you can let it bare
When true love is set apart then we know we care, but then

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
You say love is just a word
And I really mean it
A four-letter verb I put in a sentence
To show my true feelings
If love's just a word
Why would it mess with my breathing?
And just like the air, you can't see it there
But we know we need it

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Cause love ain't just a word
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Cause love ain't just a word
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Love can change the world
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Cause love ain't just a word
We know we need it
Cause love ain't just a word

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Yeah, Raskit, Rudimental, yo
Love thy neighbour, love thy raver
In my deepest darkest times, love my saviour
Love is braver, love is major
One day I'd love to meet my maker
Embrace the love from my creator and be in his favour
And that'll be later
Cause right now I couldn't be greater
I'm getting this paper, I couldn't be straighter
And I do not hate or you think I'm a baker?
They're loving my flavour
And I love this music industry
Although I know it couldn't be faker
I love the haters, I love the takers
Movers and shakers, the perpetrators, instigators
The advocaters, the top debaters
The ones that roll behind your back regurgitating data
Bunch of vagrants
Gotta be patient
I love the blacks, the whites, I love the Asians
And other persuasions and denominations
I love the thought of integration, not segregation
I know that love ain't just a word
If you would bother to use your imagination

[Break]
Love ain't just a word
Love ain't just a word(no)
Love can change the world
Love ain't just a word

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
But then you say love ain't just a word
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Cause love ain't just a word
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Love can change the world
Yeah, love ain't just a word
Cause love ain't just a word
We know we need it
Cause love ain't just a word
