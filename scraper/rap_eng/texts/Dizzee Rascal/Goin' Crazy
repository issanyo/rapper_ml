[Pre-Chorus: Robbie Williams]
Every single morning
Wake up in the afternoon
Cover up the mirror
Just to get a better view
Been around the world and never even left the room
And I, I can't figure out
Why? So I just scream and shout

[Chorus: Robbie Williams]
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Everybody's looking at me, but I don't see them
Living for the weekend, caught in the deep end
Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter
Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter
Tryin'a get high off a quarter
I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker
Star, pop bottles, date top models
Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle
Where's the love though?
Nobody cares about that, where's the club? Where's the drugs though? Front row
Follow the flow, Megaupload
Feel the adrenaline rush, who's the mug though? I don't know

[Pre-Chorus 2: Robbie Williams]
I
I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout?

[Chorus: Robbie Williams]
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Living in a bubble, my life is a puzzle
I'm caught in the rubble, now pass me a shovel
Now pass me a shot, and make it a double
I'm a whole lot of trouble and I don't do subtle
It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle
No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle
I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game
Going insane, 150 in the slow lane
Getting ahead of myself
My God, already thinking how can I better myself
Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself?
My car's a rocket, and if I get too carried away, I wouldn't know when to stop it

[Pre-Chorus 2: Robbie Williams]
I
I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout?

[Chorus: Robbie Williams]
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

[Outro: Robbie Williams]
Tryin'a get a hold of
Tryin'a get a hold of you
Tryin'a get control of
Tryin'a get control of me
