[Verse 1]
Doing it for the family
It don't really matter if you say you're not a fan of me
Telling me that you're myffed they'll having trouble understanding me
Telling me that I'm this and that I'm questioning my sanity
Wondering why my attitudes so shabby its a tragedy
Wonder why I always use profanity, randomly
Telling me there ain't no need for me to be so angry
I should be a happy chap and put my feet upon a canopy
Can it be I'm just another rapper with an attitude
Telling me that I need to settle down and show some gratitude
Telling me that I ain't the only rapper on the map thats from the manor matter fact theres been a couple that its happened to
And they've made a stack or two
Now I've got to battle through
And I'm lacking manners when I'm saying a should grab a few
I ain't got no worries I ain't even in a hurry
If I thought I couldn't do it I would pick another avenue
Haven't you heard its not a sprint its a marathon
Every now and then you've got to let a bredda tag along
Used to wear it like a badge of honour now I think about tomorrow am I gonna and I gotta sing a sadder song
Looking in the mirror all I see is the dapper don
Telling me that I need to leave the leeches and the hangers on
Devil is a liar and its got me running through the fire on my 22 inch tyres so I'm cracking on

[Hook]
I'm doin' it, I'm doin' it
I ain't preein' or pursuing it
Two two man are slewing it
Don't watch me who are you in it
I'm don it I'm doing it
Won't let them pussy boys ruin it
They say I love what i do with it
But whats love got got to do with it
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
I ain't being funny I would be another dummy if it wasn't for the money

[Verse 2]
Doing it for the legacy
Been had the flavour look at everybody eating off my recipe
Coz they know my style is a necessity
Now its getting messy its unnecessary that I hang around
I think that people should see less of me
I ain't saying that I'm ready to accept a lesser fee
Im talking bout a hysterectomy
I've been birthing all these little breddas and i must admit i got to quit before I split its over-stretching me
Put the pride aside
They told me thats a better vibe when it is applied
But i can't decide
The enemy can only conquer what he can divide
You can deny it if you want they'll have you looking like a plonker if you let it slide
You take em for a ride run and hide
And I consider myself a monster (?) consequences (?) i'll survive
I'll never take a dive
So heres a high five
And you'll be on your way
And have a great day
What can i say that would be great and make my day I would appreciate if you just go astray and stay away ok
Or you can blaze a J
You'll never see the day that Dizzee Rascal fade away
I'll always have another clever play on the way clear as day never grey
I will never sway
Everybody want a piece of the fillet till they gotta pay

[Hook]
I'm doin' it I'm doin' it
I ain't preein' or pursuing it
Two two man are slewing it
Don't watch me who are you in it
I'm don it I'm doing it
Won't let them pussy boys ruin it
They say I love what i do with it
But whats love got got to do with it
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
I ain't being funny I would be another dummy if it wasn't for the money

[Outro]
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
Money money money got these breddas acting like I got these bitches being funny
I ain't being funny I would be another dummy if it wasn't for the money
