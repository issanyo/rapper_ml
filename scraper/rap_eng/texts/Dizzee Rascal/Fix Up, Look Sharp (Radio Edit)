Ooo
Ha ha ha ha
Ahaha ahahaha
Yeah
Stupid
Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up somethin'
Something get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
(Get on down)
Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up somethin'
Something get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
(Get on down)
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat
I get on down
I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're tryin' to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
Fuck the glitz and glamor, hey I'm with the Blicks and Gamma
Because they're talking 'bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothin'
Stand up in the parks, keep a firm, steady stance
Keep the beanies touchin', keep the beanies hot flushin'
Flushin MC's down the loo
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate 'cos I ain't tryin' be your mate
Be serious you wouldn't last an hour in my shoes
It's an Air-Force-One
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the tonne
Don't feel dazed when I catch you by your jays
Chump, best to act like Forrest Gump, best to run!
Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up somethin'
Something get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
(Get on down)
Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up somethin'
Something get dark

(Get on down)
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat
I get on down
I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like tropicana
When I hammer in your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this girl
You better send your best soldiers, 'cos this is Captain Rascal
More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me don't probably come together
It's probable they'll stop me, probably never
You top man, top man, hard toppa toppa
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper
And a first aid kit, and some antiseptic, this could get hectic
I'm a done accept it, you got a bright future
Don't let my shit affect it!
Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up somethin'
Something get dark

Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up somethin'
