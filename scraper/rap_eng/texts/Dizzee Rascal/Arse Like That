[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Look at that back off, stacked tough
Maybe when the jack off
I gotta take my hat off
Standing ovation, round of applause
Clap off, all up in my face
I could never lose track of
I don't wanna sound rude
But you got a lot of cheek
And your body looks peak sweet pea
Good enough to eat
I'm guessin you're a lover in the sheets
I really wanna be
And I ain't never seen a bottom like that before
I ain't never seen a bum so fat before
You got back galore
I'll be a happy chappy if you let me smack it for you
Tap it for you, slap it for you
I don't wanna waste your time
But I wanna chase what's under your waistline, I'm fine
I'm just having a bone but I'm zonin
Wishing I could own it
I just wanna promote it and bone it

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
You got em falling like rain you break it down
You're like a heart attack yeah
No wonder no man around you can act sane
When you're moving like that
But they don't understand that they don't got a chance
Cause I got other plans for us tonight
You got em falling like rain you break it down
Cause they never seen an arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Your buff is done, your arse is retarded
A lot of junk in your trunk but far from garbage
You're a keeper, come and ride in my 2 seater
Late night creeper, I'm pleased to meet ya
Hate to see you go, love to see you leave
Figure I can't perceive
Wondering how you achieved such a beautiful body, I can't believe
So sorry I'm lost for words, I could hardly breathe
God give me strength, your bumper is a blessing
Jiggling it all over the shop, you ain't messing
I wanna get closer, suppose I'd better step in
You got the kind of body I won't be forgetting
Pleasing my senses, I ain't being pretentious
There's a lot of incentive why you're being defensive
I'm a bedroom bully, let me beat it up
Stop playin, girl let me heat it up, what's up?

[Hook]

[Bridge] x2
Wind that bum bum, move that bum bum
Shake that bum bum, grind that bum bum
Let me smack it up, back it up
Let me smack it up, back it up

[Hook]
You got em falling like rain you break it down
You're like a heart attack yeah
No wonder no man around you can act sane
When you're moving like that
But they don't understand that they don't got a chance
Cause I got other plans for us tonight
You got em falling like rain you break it down
Cause they never seen an arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that
