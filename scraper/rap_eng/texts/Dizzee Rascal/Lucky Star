Round round round we go
So clued up but obliviously
Systematically and vigorously
Society behaves so hideously
Quick to move, prove nothing that helps us
We run earth so ridiculously
Guilty, portrayed so innocently
Earth natives act immigrantly

Grew up parallel to poverty
Little choice did crime for a while
I was born in the court of pocketless
I want to stand judge to put money on trial
Robbery sure did effect me
Kept me in the sight of the old bill
So I state, music's the escape
To the front gate, to the house on the hill

This better be my lucky star
I'm too far gone, I've gone to far
This better be my lucky star
I'm too far gone, I've gone to far

Look up, look out
Jump up, jump up

Look up, look out
Jump up, jump up

I've come a little way in a little long time
From doing street robberies and petty crime
I've come far in a little long way
I would just like to say I feel fine
Cause I was down for a little long gate
Street rat appearance, face all bait
I was left in a little long state
I would just like to say I feel great

So don't make me laugh
What do you know about having no money for a trim?
Take school photo's with a jim
What do you know about boiling a kettle for a bath?
Come on now, be real
What do you know about Radio 1, 2 & 3 ?
Bailiffs banging so the neighbours see
What do you know about hustling for a school meal?

This better be my lucky star
I'm too far gone, I've gone to far
This better my lucky star
I'm too far gone, I've gone to far

Look up, look out
Jump up, jump up

Look up, look out
Jump up, jump up

This better be my lucky star
This better be, better be, better be, better be

Round, round, round we go
Lucky star
Round, round, round we go

This better be my lucky star
I'm too far gone, I've gone to far
This better my lucky star
I'm too far gone, I've gone to far

This better be my lucky star
