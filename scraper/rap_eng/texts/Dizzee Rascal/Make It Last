[Verse 1]
You ain’t from the ends, boy, don’t get me vexxed
Represent the east side everytime I flex
What you know ‘bout EQ, Stratford Rex?
Murder Mile, Palace P, murder on them steps
Deja 92, murderin’ them sets
Can’t forget Mak 10 murderin’ them decks
He'd just drop the ting we didn’t even know what’s next
I was with Reggie, never even heard of Ghetts
What you know about them real south London vets?
Imperial Gardens I was way out of my depth
Brickie on the right, Pecknam on the left
All I see is shooters it’s about to be a mess
All I see is shooters I don’t know about the rest
Can’t forget them ghetto boys servin’ up that stress
Bunch of blue borough boys turnin up La'Fez
Turnin’ up with heads
Someone’s gonna turn up dead, yeah
I was on the grind north, east, south and west
I was in the dance with no vest on my chest
Bredders lickin’ shots just to vent and express
Bredders lickin’ shots just to let me know I’m blessed

[Hook]
But that’s all in the past
So just settle off your arse
Reminisce and raise your glass
Nowadays I have a blast
And I’m in a different class
I’m just tryna make it last
But that’s all in the past
So just settle off your arse
Reminisce and raise your glass
Nowadays I have a blast
And I’m in a different class
I’m just tryna make it last

[Verse 2]
No regrets
Before I got a cheque I was workin’ up a sweat
I was on that north side, you better come correct
T town, Heat FM live and direct
I was from the east they coulda been comin’ at my neck
For the ends I rep, Instead I got respect
Coulda just been wet, didn’t know what to expect
Weren’t no speculation if they had the tings on deck
Thinkin’ what the heck
Might as well take heed
Take time and breathe
I ain’t tryna bleed
Love is all we need
Seems like they agreed
But you know know about peak unless you went Rumble Stampede
Real peak indeed
And if you’re lookin’ beef then I suggest you take the lead
And roll up your sleeves
Or get jooked with speed
I’ve seen the hardest, coldest bredders beg, holler and plead
Like you won’t believe
And North West is greaze
Hotter than Belize
I went to Tudor Rose thinkin’ it would be a breeze
But all I saw was G’s
Bredders on their knees
Screaming "Why d’you take my boy away?
God help him, please!"

[Hook]
But that’s all in the past
So just settle off your arse
Reminisce and raise your glass
Nowadays I have a blast
And I’m in a different class
I’m just tryna make it last
But that’s all in the past
So just settle off your arse
Reminisce and raise your glass
Nowadays I have a blast
And I’m in a different class
I’m just tryna make it last
