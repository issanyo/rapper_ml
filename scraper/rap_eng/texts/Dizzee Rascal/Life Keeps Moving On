[Verse 1: Dizzee]
Some people sayin it's the end of days
We're on the brink of Armageddon, only thing that we can do is pray
If that's the case then fuck it anyway
If I ain't promised tomorrow I'm gonna live for today
No point in stressin or riskin a dream up over only for a rumour
Cause sooner or later everybody's gonna meet their maker
Til then you'll find me in the Cayman Islands or Jamaica
Drinking rum with a chaser, laughin because the groove is greater
I'm getting wasted on a boat but I ain't seasick
I'm busy tryna convince this girl to let me see her bits
I'm tryna convince her even more that she should see mine
You think I'm being a sexist, this is just I politic
I know some people find it hard to swallow it
But I just catch a vibe and then I follow it
Don't mean that I'm a hollow prick
I just ain't thick enough to think that I can live forever
So until my last endeavour I'd die for whatever, whatever

[Hook]
No matter what you say
No matter what you say
Life keeps moving on
No matter what you do
Just do what you're doing
Life keeps moving on
(Because) Life keeps moving on

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Some people spend their whole lives tryna please the world
Some men go crazy or go broke tryna please a girl
Some women give away their booties for diamonds or pearls
I just kick back, I take a look and I say oh well
Cause it's my skin off my nose, I just want money or clothes
I'm happy, no lucky hoes, I'm layin stacks on my toes
Ain't got no time for enemies and I don't care about foes
Everyone knows and it shows that I'm bringin them O's
That means I'm fuckin the midgets, that means I'm countin them figures
Over the night I consider myself an everyday jigga but bugger
My car's cold, it will make you shiver
I know, go crazy bitch, turn the music up, I'll make you quiver
Speeding through the city, it's a part bass bangin
Trip tonic, thinkin supersonic
Leave alright that's how you getting fly
Sayin ah fuck it cause it's only caution
If I die tomorrow you straight up having a blast

[Hook]
No matter what you say
No matter what you say
Life keeps moving on
No matter what you do
Just do what you're doing
Life keeps moving on
(Because) Life keeps moving on

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
Forget that nostalgia shit cause I ain't got time
Don't care what happened yesterday, today is damn fine
There's no blast from the past that can top what I got
Til this present day I still shine
So when they told me recline I kindly declined
Whatever's in front of me positively behind
I will never rewind, meaning I would never ever be grind
Just to say you cry, now I look forward to 2 times
I love a bit of free time with a weeb done
She might be Scottish, either way she's hottish
I know that ain't even a word, maybe I've lost the plottish
Maybe I'm crazy or maybe it's just another one
Living between the wars, revolutions and the earthquakes
The recessions, pollutions, and political fakes
All I need is my mace, my mama couple sunny breaks
And if the world ends tomorrow I'm straight

[Hook]
No matter what you say
No matter what you say
Life keeps moving on
No matter what you do
Just do what you're doing
Life keeps moving on
(Because) Life keeps moving on

Yea one time one time one time
Life keeps moving on
