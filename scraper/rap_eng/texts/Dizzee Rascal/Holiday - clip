Get your passport and your bikini
You need a holiday, come, see me
I know you're tired of the same old scenery
And I could change all that so easily
Don't worry 'bout a thing, girl, take a chance
I'll take you to the south of France
Like Cannes, if anybody can, I can
We can go shopping in Milan
I just hope you understand, I hope you see it clear
It really don't matter how far or near
'Cause there's no distance that can stop my persistence
Just a few days of the year
Plus I've got clout, so let's ride out
We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive that
We can have a rave or we can hide out
And won't tell nobody, let them find out
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
Don't watch my passport photo
I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so-so
But let's try keep that on the low-low
'Cause we're going Ibiza
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of love
It's all good, darling, a Blue Marlin will please ya
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly's full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
If I didn't it'd just be your pretty waist
So you look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
I know you're really busy and I know you've got plans
But are you really too busy for a sun tan?
I ain't talking about walking down the high street
I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach
With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather
White wine, that's fine, just get me a lager
Then after we'll take a truck to the night spot
The hot spot, the top spot, party around the clock
And when we get there its strictly VIP
No need for ID, security know me
No waiting in line, no high entry fee
Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me
I'll get you lively and loosen you up
Have a bit of champagne, it'll boost you up
I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away
So have a word, darling, what do you say?
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
Do what you want to, baby, oh yeah
Let's do what you want to, baby
