Interlude
Just close your eyes and dream with me
You’ll hear the sounds of music

Chorus
I don’t know about algebra but I know that I am no square (square)
I don’t talk for my health and I do not ramp or easily scare (no way)
Who do they think their fooling when they try act like we are not there (not me)
If your gonna do a job you better do it proper of better be prepared (yeah, yeah)

Quality, quality, quality, quality
I am not just a commodity (no)
If you want the job done holla me (hey)
Quality, quality, quality, quality
Look how they follow and honour me (listen)

Verse 1
Yeah, Gordon bennet, please don’t beg it
I’ve been doing this since face off phones with the 10 pound credit
Yeah I said it, and I couldn’t care less whose misread it
They wanna sheg it, copy and edit
Pull out the suttin and watch them leg it
Sick of this bullshit call me a medic, ah forget it
How come everything is so generic
Why I can’t pay with the stacks and I gotta use direct debit
How much p will my kids inherit (hmm)
How much p can I get for this yard if it all goes tits up and Ive gotta sell it
I ain't gotta sell it (na)
How much p will I get for this headline show when I pull up tonight and shell it (woo)
Tweet and tell it, call out my name they scream and yell it
Yelling my bars, reach for the stars
Give my regards to all of your spars
I’m dishing out cards
And in addition I’m dishing out [casts?]
Yeah I’m in charge, like I’m the searg
Look at these likkle man givin it large
Chuck out the letter and please give me less of the garb

Chorus
I don’t know about algebra but I know that I am no square (square)
I don’t talk for my health and I do not ramp or easily scare (no way)
Who do they think their fooling when they try act like we are not there (not me)
If your gonna do a job you better do it proper of better be prepared (yeah, yeah)

Quality, quality, quality, quality
I am not just a commodity (no)
If you want the job done holla me (hey)
Quality, quality, quality, quality

Verse 2
Look how they follow and honour me (listen)
Not to blow my own horn but I should inform that I’ve been on form since I was a spawn, before I was born
Brains and brawn I’m sharp like a thorn
Dusk till dawn I lay on my own lawn, yawn
Fool I like to stay warm
I stay cool when caught in the storm
Never outworn I just out-perform
You’ve been warned
Don’t get ripped apart or get torn
I’ve been touring, and I’ve been mourning all through the morning
RIP to Stormin that’s Shaun
Pagans try and play me like a pawn
I'm gonna start pawning all of this jewellery
And build a school, and there'll still be scorn
They're too normal I’m not the norm
They're too pussy I’m not the pawn
Why does your pussy smell like a prawn (oy)
I’ve been thinking bout taking a unicorn she might see me crawling in the dorm
Might get a law degree and get sworn (why)
So I could half the fee at least partially and try trademark the best part of me
They make it hard for me it ain't hard to see

Chorus
I don’t know about algebra but I know that I am no square (square)
I don’t talk for my health and I do not ramp or easily scare (no way)
Who do they think their fooling when they try act like we are not there (not me)
If your gonna do a job you better do it proper of better be prepared (yeah, yeah)

Quality, quality, quality, quality
I am not just a commodity (no)
If you want the job done holla me (hey)
Quality, quality, quality, quality
Look how they follow and honour me (listen)
