[Intro: Wiley & Dizzee Rascal]
Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Yo, Eskiboy Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Tunnel 5 Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
And this is what I have to tell them, like certain time Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
They try and talk to me they tryna tell me something I'm like
Sorry? Pardon? What?
Could've got bored up, could've got shot

[Verse 1]
Give me a game and I'll play good
They should listen to the master
Instead of running around like headless chickens that's wayward
Wouldn't do the job if the job didn't pay good
They should give me all the good jobs
Don't call anybody at home reserving who don't deserve it
Thinking your careers gonna stay good
Better stay hood, my musics much better when it never got made in Greywood
Talking, walking, merking Wiley is so awkward
Send your top soundboy forward
It's you again, the boy from unsure wood
Got a couple [?]
When I keep Fire Camp going need more wood
Sure I could do with a few more stars
I'll spin Fire Camp from Stratford to Norwood
Say my name I'll run up on your set like

[Chorus: Wiley & Dizzee Rascal]
Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Sorry? Sorry? What? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Sorry? Sorry? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
I was like, oi Dyl, I had to tell em Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
'Cus they was amazing me Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
I was like, pardon? What? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Could've got bored up, could've got shot

[Verse 2]
I'm from Rawwood
Buy a big yard in Meadway, floors wood
They're not doing what me and my top 4 could
I spin them on my own like, me and my top 4 would
Sure would, I sure would
Real guns not rebore wood
Going on [?]
She's a whore should
You tried to take me out
Get a shotgun, I rally up, bally up
Run up in your house, I'm an E3 g
We start running up in houses, turn fakers into mouses, turn over houses
No respect for people since when people shins, I take peoples grins
I'm a a fly boy, fly boy, repping for the wing
I got a bigger family than Patel and Singh
Better know that I'm never in a no long ting
Run up in your house like action and bring

[Chorus: Wiley & Dizzee Rascal]
Pardon? What? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
I was like, sorry? Pardon? What? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
It's Eskiboy Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Tunnel 5 Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Still alive Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Can't tell me nothing, listen Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Could've got bored up, could've got shot

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo
I got bored in the proudest pavilion
But I'm still a bad boy from the Caribbean
And you think that you're straight up brilliant
I will come through I will show you realliant
You can never kick ball like a Brazillian
I'm a top boy never going down hillian
William, William, William, William
5 years gone and past and I'll familian
Blud, you're the one that got smacked in the grillian
You might know my name, that's William
We know you ain't got skillian
Ain't gonna ever make a million
Fly ahead [?]
I remain calm still standing William
Against bare man I'm a dan still living in
Watch [?] I'm down 2 nillion
It's gonna be 3-2 when I'm finished

[Outro: Wiley & Dizzee Rascal]
I was like, I was like Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
I had to tell 'em because I was so amazed Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
That, they would try and go against me Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
I was like, sorry? Sorry? What? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
I was like, sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What? Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Could've got bored up, could've got shot
E3 all day, Eskiboy, Tunnel Vision
Volume 5
Boy Better Know
Roll Deep
All under one umbrella
Shut your mouth
