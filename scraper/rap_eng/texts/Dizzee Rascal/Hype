[Verse 1]
Top of the roster
Real deal, you can see it in my posture
I feel like Leo with a Oscar
The price just changed, no sour, it'll cost ya
And I'm not an imposter
My style don't borrow or foster
My enemies will not prosper
Seems like every time they take a shot they hit the crossbar
And I move like Neymar
Them boys ain't even on my radar
I do my own stunts, no saviour
That's why I gotta stunt so major
They say I go mad for the paper
I think I need a shrink and a tailor
But I do not think about failure
I'm a star, I should get my own trailer

[Pre-Chorus]
Hype
Every time I'm around there's a hype
Touchdown and the crowd get's hyped
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype
I'm a bad boy and I do what I like
Every time I'm around there's a hype
Touchdown and the crowd get's hyped
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype

[Bassline]

[Pre-Chorus]
Hype
Every time I'm around there's a hype
Touchdown and the crowd get's hyped
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype
I'm a bad boy and I do what I like
Every time I'm around there's a hype
Touchdown and the crowd get's hyped
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype

[Bassline]
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype

[Verse 2]
I'm so legit
I do not slip, I just stick to the script
Fully equipped, there is no stopping me
I do not quit, I do not kip
Ready for action, I've gotta be physically fit
Sit-ups and burpees and dips
Gettin' a grip and it's making me physically sick
Somehow I still get a kick

[Pre-Chorus]
Hype
Every time I'm around there's a hype
Touchdown and the crowd get's hyped
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype
I'm a bad boy and I do what I like
Every time I'm around there's a hype
Touchdown and the crowd get's hyped
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype

[Bassline]
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype

[Pre-Chorus]
Hype
Every time I'm around there's a hype
Touchdown and the crowd get's hyped
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype
I'm a bad boy and I do what I like
Every time I'm around there's a hype
Touchdown and the crowd get's hyped
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype

[Bassline]
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype
Straight gassed, got the whole place hype
