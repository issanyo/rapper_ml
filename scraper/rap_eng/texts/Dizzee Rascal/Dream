How am I gonna pull this off man without sounding dumb?
This is too sensible for me man
How you gonna have a dream come true?

[Verse 1]
I used to dream about crazy little things like fame
In the days hanging outside the off-licence
We used to run around the streets, reckless with no shame
Mainly up to no good, a whole world of nonsense
And when the girls would walk by we would try to catch their eye
And if they didn't show face we would act immature
Had a thing for south and Hackney girls since I was a kid
A couple of west girls on my radar I was raw
And I was dead sure that I knew it all
The whole world against me attitude, I nearly blew it all
I find it a real big struggle gettin' through it all
I swear I didn't wanna listen cause I sure didn't care
Not knowing for reality, I'd have to prepare
Cos money don't grow on no stick, well it's rare
Me and boy was still looking less and less the lick
Plus I was growing up, life was looking like a scare

[Hook]
Happy talky talky happy talk
Talk about things you like to do
You got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

[Verse 2]
I used to love music, it was like my hidden hobby
But I couldn't get on on local radio back then
So I went to North London, I trot to Tottenham to be precise
And got some air time on Heat FM
Then it escalated, I was getting ratings here and there
And carried on until eventually I was everywhere
I started doing all the hot spots, Ministry, Caesar's Palace, P area time in MV
I did the grim and the glam
I did the poor and the posh
I didn't hang around, I wanted my money in a rush
Mind frame in the studio at this stage
No time to chat, I didn't wanna N-gage
I found myself a new hustle it was beautiful
And unlike the one before, a bit more suitable
The more challenging it got, the more I fought it
Made an album, over 100,000 people bought it
Thank you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To all the youngers cotchin' on the stairs in the flats
With the superstar soccer-lings, Beckham in the makings
You can go far if you put your mind to it
You're a star, don't wait to be told, just do it
Try to keep school in your plans don't be worrying about your mans
They'll be there in the end if they're real, if they ain't
Don't be making no effort to impress
Cause you'll find out where you are, just do what you feel
Young babymothers, yo I got your back as well
Young babyfathers, hold it down for your girl
I ain't trying to preach but for what it's worth
That kid's the next generation Planet Earth
Big shout to the world cause I've been all around
And when I'm gone I'm always thinking about my hometown
I'm from the LDN there's no forgetting that
And the big UK I stay reppin' that

[Hook]

You love that
You tell me you don't love that
