[Chorus]
He's jus' a rascal, he's jus' a rascal
He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal
He's jus' a rascal, he's jus' a rascal
He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal
(Rascal) He's jus' a rascal, he's jus' a rascal
(Rascal) He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal
(Rascal) He's jus' a rascal, (Rascal) he's jus' a rascal
Yo London, stand up tall
He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal

[Verse 1]
Stress on the brain, complain to the fool
Stress on the brain, complain to the max
I'm gonna search for big money stacks
Top tens or platinum plaques
Ain't got no need for a chain on my chaps
I'm a rudeboy, dangargan, daps
I got this game in my hand like dax
Got this game in my hand, be cool
Unstoppable, make a boy relax
I'll take cheese from the Jills and Jacks
We make money off album tracks
Come on I'll face it, lets all face facts
You may be perhaps some chaps
What's that, but I'm invisible to all
Foolish fakish cats, maybe put hands on my daps
Stress on my brain complain to the max
Stress on my brain complain but I know
Gotta get money, gotta get a lot of dough
No less than a G for the show
Ain't got no love for a hag or a ho
Do tings, have flings with girls on the low
I get around all ways in a go
I get around all ways in a rush
Can't stop me, I won't ever hush
Drinking beer make my lot lush
When I come to the crotch with kush
Never chat shit, talk shit get flushed
I talk tough 'cause life's been rough
Gritty, shitty life ain't been too pretty, far from buff
So I'm off to the elegant stuff

[Chorus]
He's jus' a rascal, he's jus' a rascal
He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal
He's jus' a rascal, he's jus' a rascal
He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal
(Rascal) He's jus' a rascal, he's jus' a rascal
(Rascal) He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal
(Rascal) He's jus' a rascal, (Rascal) he's jus' a rascal
He's jus' a rascal, Dizzee Rascal

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
He's jus' a rascal, he's jus' a rascal

[Verse 3]
Bugs on your rug so lay low, I might have to stop, get Live-o
And you don't need the stress or aggro so
Just sit back and settle, I'm hot like a kettle
You might get scalded or burnt up
But I guarantee the feds won't turn up
Hating's a bad habit, you best give it up
Act like a bitch? Go fetch your makeup
I'm streetwise, hang with the phat guys so baptize
Make the whole crew capsize, slap guys that wanna talk pork pies
Look, Raskit known to attack guys so no lies
Maybe I recognize
When I pour true there is no clear skies
Jack guys, kidnap and cap guys
Rep's up, rampage, stab with glass

[Outro]
(Oi pussyhole, I'm coming for you yeah
Remember rude boy I'm coming for you yeah
Anywhere I see you I'm gonna lift off your face
With chat yeah you're a pussy hole, look, fuck your mans as well
All right, go suck your mum yeah
We're all waiting to blow you brain you think that you're all bad
You ain't bad blad, pussying out, pussying out for three weeks
Talking about you got girls from Northend One
What's all that about you shit head, fuck you on, man?)
