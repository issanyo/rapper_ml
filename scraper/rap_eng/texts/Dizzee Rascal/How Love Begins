[Intro - Clare Maguire]
What is this? How can it be?
I'm on my knees, Lord, rescue me
It ain't wrong, it's not a sin
It's just the way that love begins
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Just the way that love begins

[Chorus - Clare Maguire]
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love to keep me moving up
I need your love, need-need-need your love (yes I do)
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love to keep me moving up

[Verse 1: Dizzee and ad-libs from Clare Maguire]
Let's go, what you need from me is what I need from you
We've gotta share the love, that's what we need for true
That's what we've gotta pursue and if we split the love
Between the two, imagine everything that we could do
Not for the love of money, and would you love me
Even if I was runnin' off with the garms and the cars and the yard
And the cars, I ain't tryna be funny
But for the feeling that you get in your tummy, your love is sweeter than honey
(mmmmmmm)
Your friend's saying that I'm trouble
I can't lie, I was raised in the struggle
And when it all goes off, I'll be there in a double
Right now, all I wanna do is double
(ah oh!)
Plus, talk is thin
You ain't even gotta bother entertaining that sort of thing
You just caught a king, you're a queen, if it's all a sin
I guess it's just the way love begins

[Bridge - Clare Maguire]
Dear Lord, lord of mine
Tell me I'm not love's divine
It ain't wrong, it's not a sin
It's just the way that love begins
Gotta keep on moving up
Gotta keep on moving up
Gotta keep on moving up
Gotta keep on moving

[Chorus]
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love to keep me moving up
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love, need-need-need your love
I need your love, need-need-need your love (oh, yeah)
I need your love (yeah, yeah)

[Outro - Clare Maguire]
Say oh, no, no, say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say oh, no, no, say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say oh, no, no, say yeah, yeah, yeah
Give me your
I need love
Give me your
I need it
