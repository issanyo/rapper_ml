I am Superman, bitch I’m Superman
I am Superman, Superman Superman
I am Superman, bitch I’m Superman
I am Superman, Superman Superman
I turn a dollar to 100, to 100 million
Leap over tall buildings, niggas can’t get em
I turn a dollar to 100, to 100 million
Leap over tall buildings, niggas can’t get em
I am Superman, bitch I’m Superman

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo! I’m young, free, I’m running amok
And I just got paid so I'm really gonna live it up
I’m on that Superman flex
Tryna think about which part of the world I'm gonna holiday next
A lot of chilling and a whole lot of sex
I need a girl to keep my thingy erect
And I ain't silly cos I always keep my Jimmy protected
So I don’t ever worry bout getting infected
My only concern is that vibe stays jiggy
So you ain’t gotta worry bout spending no money if you’re ridin with me
I'll put it all on the card, the register's out of paper
And think about what it cost me later
I think that we should start in Jamaica
Or maybe Antigua, I know a couple spots in Ibiza
Everybody’s watchin me cuz I’m a over achiever
And I could really do with a breather
Girl give me one

[Bridge]
Girl you be like how, how you do it?
How you do it?
Oh how you do it?
Oh oh oh oh
Oh how you do it?
How I do it?
How, how I do it?
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
My own deal winner says count your blessings
From the car that you drive to the clothes you dress in
So I'm D&G head-to-toe
I got a little swagger and I’m letting it show
Plus I got money to blow, that’s why I’m letting you know
All you really need is just the bare necessities
So pack em and I’m ready to go
So what you’re waitin for? I’m ready to roll
And I can tell that you're excited, you ain’t telling me no
I've got a friend with a boat so you we can float in the Caribbean Sea
Or we could drive by the coast, top down, catching the breeze
And now I wanna speed, I'm takin it easy
I want you to enjoy the scenery
We ain't in a hurry, don’t need to rush and scurry
Don’t even worry yourself, you look lovely
Enjoy the sun, you think this is fun
No we ain’t never started, we ain’t never broke up, come on

[Bridge]
Girl you be like how, how you do it?
How you do it?
Oh how you do it?
Oh oh oh oh
Oh how you do it?
How I do it?
How, how I do it?
Oh oh oh oh

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
All my bitches high, all my bitches fly
All these bottles, getting drunk up in here tonight
Even my money high, talking sky high
You want some, space god
She was just walkin by her own
She thinks that she’s a model
She want it all, it’s not all
Won’t there be no more bottles?

[Bridge]
Girl you be like how, how you do it?
How you do it?
Oh how you do it?
Oh oh oh oh
Oh how you do it?
How I do it?
How, how I do it?
Oh oh oh oh
