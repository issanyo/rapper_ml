[Refrain]
Money talks, listen, mmm-hmm-hmm, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh
Money talks, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh

[Verse 1]
Let's go. everybody wants to be famous
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless
People act shameless
Tryna live like entertainers
Want a fat crib with the acres
So they spend money that they ain't made yet
Got a benz on tik that they ain't paid yet
Spend their pay cheque
In the west end on the weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend
But they don't care cause their life is a movie
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly
Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks
Can't keep up with the cover notes
So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit
In debt but they still don't get it
Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life
Lovin' the high when livin' it large
And they all say

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty
Everybody's on a paper chase
It's one big rat race
Everybodys got a screw face
So many 2 face
Checkin their high just like their ready to ride
I'm on the inside looking at the outside
So it's an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the southside
Everywhere I go there's a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs cause the citys like a sauna
And it's getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a morner
Mr polititian can you tell me the solution
What's the answer, what's the conclusion
Is it an illusion, is it I'm a thug
I see younger die because they tryna live large
And they all say

[Bridge]
I've no excuse, I just want you to use me
Take me and abuse me
I got no taboos, I'll make a trade with you
Do anything you wa-ant me to

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Yo, we're living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough, I'm trying to have a bunch
But I can't have raps for lunch
It's nothing, enough to share, it ain't fair
I never dreamed that it could be rare

Who cares who's there to make a change?
Everyone's in the club tryna to make it rain
But not for famine, just for the sake of having
Fifteen minutes of fame and everywhere's the same

Again and again, I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they're plain sailing
But I see rough seas ahead, maybe a recession
And then the depression, then whatever profession

This is my confession, I can't front, I'm in the forefront
Livin' for money ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope, but I ain't tryna see the bottom
Because that is where I came from, I ain't forgotten
