Yo I woke up this morning
I had a little stretch, had a little yawn
Looked up (lovely), I see the sun shining, I could hear the birds tweeting (tweet, tweet, tweet), and I thought yo, I’m gonna make this day count rude boy

Chorus
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Catching a vibe

Verse 1
Woke up and I felt all vibey
Woke up and I felt all lively
Woke up I was like cor blimey
Got a whole lotta vibe inside me
My nuts were a little bit grimy
My guts were a little bit slimy
Washed up and made myself tidy
Now I’m spick and I’m span and I’m shiny
Then I said Jesus lord please guide me
Don’t let these pussyholes try me
Don’t wanna see me get fiery
But I know that you won’t deny me
Let me know everything is irie
He said dun know that I’m your guy G
I said amen and thank you kindly
Then I hopped in the whip all smiley

Chorus
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Might get ghost for the weekend grab one yattie and go for a ride
Catching a vibe, I’m so happy inside
I don’t know about them man there but I’m so gassed I’m alive

I’ve been waiting for so long, to pattern a vibe its true
Now that I’ve caught this I ain't gonna let go until the whole nights through, coz I’ve been waiting for so long to catch a vibe with you yeah, so if you wanna catch my wave, maybe you will come my way, yeah yeah

Verse 2
Creeper, and I feel like a right proper geezer
Hold on let me get a little deeper
Let me tell you how my day gets sweeter
I got a ting over there I don’t cheat her
Got a ting I just poke I don’t tweet her
Roll up to the spot then I beep her
Roll up to the spot on time like the reeper
Open the door and I greet her
I say waguan my senorita
You look like a right little keeper
Wanna get you a berry then feed ya
Better buckle up tight coz I need ya
Like your birthday the way I’m gonna treat ya
Got a whole lot of bass in my speaker
And your probably with a rassclart overachiever

Chorus
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Might get ghost for the weekend grab one yattie and go for a ride
Catching a vibe, I’m so happy inside
I don’t know about them man there but I’m so gassed I’m alive

I’ve been waiting for so long, to pattern a vibe its true
Now that I’ve caught this I ain't gonna let go until the whole nights through, coz I’ve been waiting for so long, to catch a vibe with you yeah, so if you wanna catch my wave, maybe you will come my way, yeah yeah

If you wanna ride, come we can pattern a vibe
I’ve been waiting all my life
So we’ve got to get it right, yeah, yeah
If you wanna vibe, come we can pattern it right
I'm just celebrating life, I’ll be doing this all night, trust

Chorus
Catching a vibe, out here patterning vibes
Might get ghost for the weekend grab one yattie and go for a ride
Catching a vibe, I’m so happy inside
I don’t know about them man there but I’m so gassed I’m alive

I’ve been waiting for so long, to pattern a vibe its true
Now that I’ve caught this I ain't gonna let go until the whole nights through, coz I’ve been waiting for so long to catch a vibe with you yeah, so if you wanna catch my wave, maybe you will come my way, yeah yeah
