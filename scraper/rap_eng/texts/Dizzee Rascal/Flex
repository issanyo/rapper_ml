I wanna see you dip-dip-dip
And lemme see you rock-rock-rock
And wind up on your hip-hip-hip
And never ever stop-stop-stop

I wanna see you dip-dip-dip
And lemme see you rock-rock-rock
And wind up on your hip-hip-hip
And never ever stop-stop-stop

[ Hook ]
I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you move like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

I love it when you wind like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

[ Verse 1 ]
I love it when I see a pretty girl winding
I can even watch a buttaz girl grinding
Control the body with great timing
Ain't shy in the dance, they're shining
Does something to me when I see 'em vibesing
Drop it like its hot, they got my tings rising
So frequent there's no disguising
What do you expect, that ain't surprising
These girls get my blood pressure rising
Their wiggling and jiggling, I'm hyping
Shaking their back off, it's so inviting
So natural, so exciting
Yo, to be honest, I wanna get right in
It's better than with the man dem fighting
No point in wishing, I might as well try a ting
Excuse me, I really gotta say something

[ Hook ]

[ Verse 2 ]
Girlfriend, how you wind like that?
Beautiful, you look so fine like that
Ain't seen it for a long time like that
You should go to jail for a crime like that
Buss' up the floor, you don't cut no slack
Dancehall queen, you're not at all laid-back
Make up for what all the other girls lack
Look so good you got me going off tr-tr-track
I can't even chat, got my heartbeat going rat-a-tat-tat
So serious, you got me ill like that
Temperature rising yo, I feel like that
Nah for real, you could kill like that
Moving your body with pure skill like that
I can't get enough yo, it's real like that
I'd love if you'd flex with Dill like that
Cause

[ Hook ]

[ Bridge ]
Ok, alright
Let's dance all night
Alright, ok
Let's dance all day
Ok, alright
Let's dance all night
Alright, ok
Let's dance all day

[ Verse 3 ]
Gosh golly, my-oh-my
I'm hoping that you ain't looking at any other guy
Your figure is so pleasing to the eye
Especially when you do the bogle or the butterfly
See a bit of sweat dripping down your thigh
But somehow you still stay high-and-dry
Gosh, you make a rude boy so shy
Got the whole club saying my-oh-my
Please don't stop, please don't stop, give it
If not, show me how I gotta get with it
You're the best I ain't scared to admit it
I swear I care, I won't dare pet with it
What's the deal, you're looking at me like, is it?
But you won't know unless you come pay a visit
Life's too short to be cautious, innit?
Don't just stand on the edge, come live it
