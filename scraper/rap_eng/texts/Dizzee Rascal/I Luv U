[Verse 1]
Yo, If that girl knows where you stay, that's poor
Some whore banging on your door, what for?
Pregnant? What're you talking about, be sure
Fifteen, she's underage, that's raw
And against law, 5 years or more
And she wants a score and half of a draw
That's the kind of threat that you can't ignore
That whore got you pinned down to the floor
But it's your own fault, you said three magic words (I love you)
When that's the one for the birds
When you said that she forgot other boys
It's over, you better start buying the toys
There was no intention of her being wife
Now she knows this, she's ending your life
It's a real shame you got had by the whores
It's a shame that kid probably ain't yours

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal & Jeanine Jacques]
That girl' some bitch ya know
She keep calling my phone, she don't leave me alone
She just moan and groan, she keep ringin' me at home
These days I don't answer my phone
That boy some prick, you kna'
All up in my hair, thinks that I care
Keeps following me here, keeps following me there
These days I can't go nowhere
Ain't that your girl? Nah, it ain't my girl
I swear that's your girl? Course it ain't my girl
She got juiced up (oh well)
She got jacked up (oh well)
I swear that's your man? I ain't got no man
You was with that man? He was just any man?
He got hotted up (oh well)
He got whacked up (oh well)

[Verse 2]
Alright, she's a bad girl, I'm a boss though
Captain Roscoe with a crossbow
She came she got picked off yo
Nah its not a love ting, get lost ho
Dizzee Rascal come down like snow
With freezing cold flows like Moscow
Dumb ho, get me upset, guns blow
Bitch, you're not ready for skid row
Bleed know Dizzee Rascal did grow
Big feet for the force on my big toe
I got no chaps, no chains, not much dough
Get juiced but you don't get love though
No slap but you might get a co-co
Jambo coming through like Rambo
Love ting takes two like tango
But she ain't my wifey, she can go

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal & Jeanine Jacques]
That girl' some bitch ya know
She keep calling my phone, she don't leave me alone
She just moan and groan, she keep ringin' me at home
These days I don't answer my phone
That boy some prick, you kna'
All up in my hair, thinks that I care
Keeps following me here, keeps following me there
These days I can't go nowhere
Ain't that your girl? Nah, it ain't my girl
I swear that's your girl? Course it ain't my girl
She got juiced up (oh well)
She got jacked up (oh well)
I swear that's your man? I ain't got no man
You was with that man? He was just any man?
He got hotted up (oh well)
He got whacked up (oh well)

[Verse 3]
Listen, I like your girl so you better look after your girl
Or I might just take your girl and make your girl my girl
Switch your girl with Michelle
Switch Michelle with Chantelle
Play Chantelle with Shanell
Lyrical clientele but I ain't a bow cat, I don't like the smell
I'm gonna go through a shell and make a boy feel unwell
That girl's from school, that girl's from college
That girl gives brains, that girl gives knowledge
That girl gives head, that girl gives shines
That girl gives bj's at all times
She looks decent, she looks fine
But don't talk about wifey she's not mine
She got batteried, 6 in a line, believe me that's not a good sign

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal & Jeanine Jacques]
That girl' some bitch ya know
She keep calling my phone, she don't leave me alone

[Outro]
Uh, Dizzee Rascal
Roll Deep, it's all love, ha ha
2000 and slew, get me
Damn right I'm articulate, I'm not an idiot
Dem boy not ready yet, trend they could never set
This is the next step, I write the 2-step
Niggas better get set, I'll make your girl wet
I'm articulate, I'm not an idiot
Dem boy not ready yet, trend they could never set
This is the next step, I write the 2-step
Niggas better get set, I'll make your girl wet
