I'm doin' it major with the bad behavior (x8)
I'm a popular player, these girls know how I do
If they ain't comin' alone I'm happy leaving with two
I act like I ain't got a clue, but I know the cue
And if I'm totally honest, it really ain't nothin' new
I'm on the club scene looking for love
I mean looking for women that's thrillin' or willin' to get in the tub
Champagne, bubble bath, sex, and all the above
She could powder her nose, but I'll be skippin' the drugs
I might have a little smoke, plus a little joke
I hope if I ask nicely, she'll give me deep throat
If not, there's the front door, don't forget your coat (Move!)
Don't come back, I don't ever want to see you, beau
Back to the club, I'm bobbin' and weavin'
Grab a girl, it's nothin' long, we're leavin'
Goin' to my hotel room for a meetin'
Wake up the neighbors, no body sleepin'!
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Money money money and bad behavior
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Lookin' for a girl that'll do me a favor
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Money money money and bad behavior
So fresh (unclear) trainers
I shine like a star, too bad for my haters
Doin' it major with the bad behavior
Doin' it major with the bad behavior
Doin' it major with the bad behavior
Bad behavior, bad behavior
I live the super star life: young, rich, and I'm famous
Got no time for no body talkin' out of their anus (No!)
Lookin' for a lady willin' to get after some capers
It's a no-brainer, even if I was brainless
All I know is money, guns, clothes, cars, and women
And God knows that that's a recipe for sinnin'
But on the flip side it's a recipe for winnin'
I do 130 in a Porche Turbo grinnin'
I'm speedin', I'm burnin' rubber
With my super star girl I'm a super star lover
Three's not a crowd, there's room for another
There's queer sister and her lesbian lover
The girl's in luck, I'm untucked, it don't stop
Missionary, doggy, and whatnot, they all drop
Seven years on the chart and I'm still hot
Wanna know how I'm doin' it? I'll tell you what:
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Money money money and bad behavior
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Lookin' for a girl that'll do me a favor
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Money money money and bad behavior
So fresh (unclear) trainers
I shine like a star, too bad for my haters
I get a blow job drivin', slippin' and slide
In between the traffic in the bus lane gettin' high
I'm over the limit but I'm overly in it
And if I see police, I'm gonna have to wing it
I'm breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Put the pedal to the floor 'till it can't take it no more
And if you ever try a thing, then I'm breakin' your jaw
Put my hand behind your head and smack your face on the floor
I want a two-way mirror with a midget behind it
And I hid the camera so no body could find it
In my sex dungeon we could make a movie
With my favorite groupie, yeah, she's a beauty
She's a pretty young thing, yeah, she's a cutey
Double D breasts and her bottom is juicy
Got me runnin' round the place like Kriss Akabusi
With my wanger hangin' out, cause I'm ballin' loosely (Ballin'!)
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Money money money and bad behavior
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Lookin' for a girl that'll do me a favor
Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major
Money money money and bad behavior
So fresh (unclear) trainers
I shine like a star, too bad for my haters
