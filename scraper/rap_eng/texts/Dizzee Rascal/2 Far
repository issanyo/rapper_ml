[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, I don't promote no violence but
If that boy gets arrogant, I'll
Leave that boy in the basement, so
Done with the bad boy talk, just walk
I'm not a female beater, but
If that girl gets feisty, I'll
Slap that girl all hasty 'cause
She might be buff, but she's not rough
I can't believe I'm hearing that
Boy thinks I'm not near him, just
Let me draw his girlfriend, I'll
Cut no slack, she'll never go back
Marriage, love, wife; please!
All that talk is stupid, plus
I don't believe in cupid 'cause
Sometimes most times everyone two-times

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal]
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, yo, yo

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
I don't obey no policemen 'cause
They forget they're human, uh
Get excited quickly but
He ain't got a gun, I'll kick him and run
Don't tell me about royalty 'cause
Queen Elizabeth don't know me, so
How can she control me when
I live street and she lives neat
I love raves and concerts, but
There's just too much violence and
I can't stand no nonsense, uhhh
Book me, watch me, hear me, pay me
I've been far too friendly now
Everybody wants a favour, but
I'm not no ones saviour 'cause
Where was you when I was blue?!

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal]
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, yo

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, talk in the mic, I'll talk neat
Talk to your wife, I'll talk sweet
Talkin' tough, I'll talk with my feet
Rascal's raw like red meat
Talk aggy, talk rough
Talk sexy, talk buff
Certain girls talk 'nuff
Talk anything, anywhere, any stuff
Yeah we got style, we'll get gash
Yeah we got style, we'll make cash
Certain man talk trash
Act funny, act flash
Bring your bora, bring your mash
Get banged, get bashed
I don't care who they are, where they are
If they wanna bring the beef, we ain't far

[Hook: Wiley, Dizzee Rascal, both]
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No

[Verse 4: Wiley]
I was hot stepping in my Nike Air sneaker
You didn't know I was an MC beater, defeater
Giving the MC a sleeper
I'm in to win fairly, I'm not a cheater
I'm starving, hungry ready to eat her
Your drinks sweet, but my drink's sweeter though
I'm getting stronger bro, you're getting weaker bro
I came straight from the gutter, lay low
I'm a ninja turtle, you can't step into my circle
In a sound clash I will hurt you
Paper, that's what I'm living for
They don't wanna make paper, they want a place on the floor and choong
That's what I want
I want choong things, a double bed fling with a choong ting
Wiley, Rascal that's the boom-ting
Galdem-a bang on my ends
No long ting!

[Hook: Wiley, Dizzee Rascal, both]
Who do they think they are?
Push me too far
I don't care who you are
I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
Push me too far
I don't care who you are
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
