[Verse 1]
Big fat and heavy
Rolling round with that belly
Young prince like Eddie
See that big face on the telly
Big shout to my dready
Big bag of that veggie
Two zoots and the bevvy
Got me calm focused and ready
Eaay right ear to the cellie
Buff ting called shelly
Pretty, perky and leggy
And she knows the crew already
Its about to get sweaty
Neck game so tekkie
Took the nut and didn't spit it out
All them other girls are so petty trust
Everything is golden
Shout out to Hulk Hogan
You know your still my brother
And my door is always open
Reputation is broken
What you said was potent
Got me wishing and hoping
I'll be more than just your token
I was rolling round roman
Everything was stolen
My boy was shootin' that brown and white and it was highly crack in his colon
No homo strolling
Feinds asking who's holding
Fake face no joking
Smokin' bolder in the open like

Wow, wow
Everything was fowl we was hooded up on the prowl
Now I'm like, wow, wow
Posted up like a tower look at me the man of the hour
Got em like wow, wow
Everything was fowl we was hooded up on the prowl
Now I'm like, wow, wow
Posted up like a tower look at me the man of the hour

[Verse 2]
Bus pass no motor
Running down the promoter
Tried to duck and not pay me must think that I'm some joker
Put in work for the culture
Just like I'm supposed to
Even if i weren't supposed to play they still put my name on the poster
Pop tarts in the toaster
On my old dear's sofa
Trying to figure out combos on street fighter for the ultra
Had a girl from Malta
I would squeeze and grope her
Used to make my toes curl but never made it to the altar and its kosher
Love and blessed vibes, spread them blessings far and wide 'cause I'm a blessed guy
And i can testify
I confess my my testosterone levels extra high
Plus I'm extra fly
Lyrical exercise
Got them petrified
Still running my enterprise
I don't ramp and i don't play no need to emphasise
There whining about how shitty there life is in the crisis but I'm decisive
No I don't emphasise
