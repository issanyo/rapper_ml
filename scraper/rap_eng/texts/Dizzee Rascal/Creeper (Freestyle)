[Verse 1]

Yo, I, roll deep on these
Put these emcees on deep freeze
Hit these, whip these and rip these
Come like Busta, we flip these
Please, don't ramp with these
Fearless, angry, sick emcees
Don't like Kristy's or Britney's
Lala's or Tinky Winky's
This one's strictly for pickneys
Old school Afros, dry white knees
Barclays, Halifax, we stick these
Endless gunshots, we lick these
Trick these, CID's with ease
Touch mic, emcees jump like fleas
Player haters get chopped like trees
Avoid Rascal to avoid injuries

[Verse 2]

And I hit 'em like a lightning bolt
Five thousand volt, it's your own fault
Stand still, I'll put your whole crew to a halt
Cover emcees like pepper and salt
Gunman bullets go right through your coat
Nine milli, take Billy for a billy goat
Lay low, roll deep on a river boat
Cuttin' edge, Dizzee Rascal, cut throat

[Verse 3]

Rewind a wind-re, late to the sound
This soundboy's straight to the front line
Fuck her to the left, right, front or behind
Never nice, gotta be cruel to be kind
Dry lips sippin' on a dry white wine
Feel funny, take a draw of this, feel fine
Husband, I'll make your wifey be mine
Get pussy, get poom, get feline

[Verse 4]

Lyrical staff
Never could they ever take me for a chav
Scholar in the English, scholar in the Math
Dizzee ain't no riff raff
Hit 'em with the rise
Move, kick, uppercut, jab
Don't make me lose my rag
I'm a troublesome lad
Barefoot Shaolin lad
Lyrically far from swag
And I'm far from clean, I'll
Play kiss chase with your aunt Maureen
Get rhymes, get heard, get seen
Dizzee run tings like Idi Amin
Keep vigilant, keep on guard
We chuck grenades at Scotland Yard
Retard, get kicked hard, real hard
Leave death threats in your birthday card

[Verse 5]

Weights in the gym
Glass full of Alize, right to the brim
Roll deep, so deep, they can't swim
Doin' it for Keisha, doin' it for Kim
He wants arms out, he wants to swing
If you try a ting, get a punch in the chin
Rascal is here, you better start worryin'
Get a hidin', beatin', turfin'
Didn't wanna care, so
Left that boy in the gutter somewhere
When I talk live-o, when I talk rare
I'll make you wish you were born elsewhere
I've gotta wash that girl out my hair
She's old news, everyone's been there
No we're not equal, no we're not fair
That girl's anything, she gets air

[Verse 6]

Take time pussy yout
Samurai, separate legs from feet
Twenty two inch blade, nothin' ain't sweet
Leave an emcee on the floor in the street
And that boy can't compete
Dizzee don't play fair, Dizzee might cheat
Draw for your handgun, draw for your heat
Dizzee boy, make a big boy look petite
Sex, play, then work
Girls say Dizzee Rascal is a jerk
Do it for the Bentley, do it for the Merc
Wanna make cash money like Young Turk
And that boy got hurt
Never knew that his girlfriend was a flirt
Sex in the alleyway, sex in the dirt
Sent her home in a black torn up skirt
