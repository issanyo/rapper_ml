[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
It's CAS
Dead FM
We're live, inside
Yeah, yeah alright you cunt, yeah

[Verse]
Let me get started
Yeah I'm eating, and you're starving
Yeah blud all this bullshit's jarring
All these MC's talk is jargon
Box on the cheap, yeah I picked up a bargain
Got two chicks here in my car
Interior wood, exterior carbon
And the speakers are Harman Kardon
8 ball in the glove compartment
Pull up outside your apartment
Drug dealing is my department
Heat from the feds, I'm flame retardant
Some call me the devil incarnate
Pure Cocaine and Bi-Carbonate
I cut that shit regardless
The game is mine no argument
Discarded sharps on the carpet
Got my ting flooding the market
New crop ready for harvest
World domination, that's my target
Car so big that it's hard to park it
I don't do nothing half hearted
Her face is hard but look at her barnet
I can't fam, I had to dark it
We can't par
She's underpar
I had to par
We had to part
We at the park
When it's dark
Selling dark
Selling shark
Couple pills same colour as Bart
Couple fights, left man scarred
So now I can't let down my guard
We go hard, no disregard
We at the bar, put on my card
High as fuck, Tony Stark
That ain't the loud
Smell like a fart
I don't want two, don't make me laugh
He's strung out, like a guitar
Want oil money, like Qatar
Drop out the fags
Fill up with tar
Give man catarrh
Yeah I'll have one, ta
I'm weird, but revered
Sitting in that blue revere
Leave your bird here if you dare
Leave you clearly in the rear
Middle finger in her rear
My offspring in her hair
That poor mare, she's had a mare
We do gear, but we don't share
Unless she's down, and she's there
These other cats, they don't compare
In their raps, they're in the lear
When in fact, they're in arrears
We end careers, end in tears
I'm in my whip, and it tears
Not in my tier, rims are stock
Pull off the lot, don't need the fob to unlock
Stop dat, start dat, get dat, what
Been there, done dat, had dat, what
Gone one o'clock, you fucking or what?
Trying to get top in my Lyle & Scott
Gimme that shines, 100 watt
Gotta get a shot don't know what you've got
Fuck the top spot, I don't want that slot
I just want gwop
And I want a lot, but I digress
Drink and drugs is what I digest
Doc says that my brain is messed
Baloo she's given me a pain in the chest, bless
I don't know what to suggest
Gone for the re-up, I've gotta invest
Yeah I spit 96 bars in jest
Man still act like they ain't impressed
Said nothing less, best of the best
George Best, Leon Best
Sign her breast, fuck all the rest
Give it a rest, switch to sport
Give it a test, yeah I'm stressed
Under duress, no Durex
She's with her besty, she says she's a les
Got my 1DX and a lense

[Outro]
Yeah
