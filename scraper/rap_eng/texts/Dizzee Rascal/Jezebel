[Verse 1]
Yo, look, look, look...
They call her Jezebel, you might find her in your neighborhood
Always in some shit, up to no good
Constant boasting, bragging to her friends
Juiced every boy in the ends
Didn't finish school, she went truant every day
Always on the link, different boy every day
Missed mathematics, she was doing acrobatics
But not gym class, she was getting doggy fast
Yo, they call her Jezebel, friends call her sket behind her back
She never knew the plot, she was born off track
Tight top, short skirt, thinks she's too nice
Hates love, but she's been deep in twice
Pars with hoes, she can't keep her legs closed
Always on the creep, now she's in too deep
Now she faces neglect, abuse and rape
Man said that he'd kill her if she tried to escape

Whats your name? I've seen you about
I think you're choong, boom ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
Where you from, hot stuff? Buff ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
I've seen you about
I think you're tromp, boom ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
I know your face, where you from, hot stuff? Buff ting
(I really hope you're not grim
I really hope you're not a Jezebel)

[Verse 2]
You might find her at a house rave
For the fifth time, she's getting wined from behind
Had a bit to drink so she's acting kinda slow
She came with Natasha but she's leaving with Joe
Ricky loves Jezzy but Jezzy loves bling
Ricky means well but Ricky ain't got a thing
Joe's got a name and Jezzy loves fame
She wants a man to show so it's all about Joe
They call her Jezebel, on her way to get wocked out
Get batteried and get kicked out
Jezzy weren't expecting more then four
But what could she say? She just did it anyway
Messed up, caught a kind of STD
Gonorrhea, Herpes, no, VD
Left bitter, left angry, left vexed
But still loved sex, passed it on to the next

[Hook]
Whats your name? I've seen you about
I think you're choong, boom ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
Where you from, hot stuff? Buff ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
I've seen you about
I think you're tromp, boom ting
(I really hope you're not a grim
I really hope you're not a jezzy, jezzy)
I know your face, where you from, hot stuff? Buff ting
(I really hope you're not grim
I really hope you're not a Jezebel)

[Verse 3]
Pretty but ain't got a brain
Got no shame, got juiced on the train
Went from daddy's little girl to daddy's heart attack
House wreck aside, she could never go back
Raised in the church not knowing anything
Then learned about boys and ruined everything
Age sixteen, she was never full grown
She was in a family, now she's got one of her own
Two kids, even worse, two little girls
Two more of her, that's two Jezebels
Two fatherless kids, one single mom
No longer young, but the boys still come
Yo, wishin' she could take it back to the old school
And make better choices, oh, what a fool
Bottle by her side, she wonder, man
If only she was six years younger, damn
