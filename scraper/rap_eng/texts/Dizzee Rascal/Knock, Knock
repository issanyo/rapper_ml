Yo, I'm Dizzee Ras, nightmare from the big e-a-s-t
I'm exactly what your parents don't wanna see on your TV
I'm nasty, precisely, intimidate anyone that I choose
Refuse to lose, express unlimited controversial views
Your average boy or girl on the street might be familiar with my beat
And/or familiar with my sound
I'm formerly from the underground
And its clear, for a year
I've been turnin' up the heat
Made you get up an' outta your seat
Shake your fists and shuffle your feet

Let's make another thing clear
They didn't burn me up enough, I'm still here
So what was the purpose of your little charade?
Your little charade was whack
Just about hurt meh
You shoulda marked me up on a rampage now I'm back
5 stab wounds, couple scratchin', bruisin' and some (chains?)
4 half-hearted fassies, 4 borers, no brains
Did it, two weeks before my album helped me sell double
But let's not dwell on that, it's the least of your trouble

Hey y'all considerin', the part I play, the position i'm in
You wouldn't be expectin' me to say
I prefer the day to nights when I gotta turn up and play-up
Rip-off dusty sweaty cluttered raves
Where the audience all screw-face and the promoters don't wanna pay
And half o'the boys in the crowd wanna blast me
And half o'the girls wanna show how little they care 'bout standin right there
At the front tryin' a look right past me
It gets depressin', thinkin' bout it even more
Knowin' that i'm gonna face the usual hassle at the door
Because as well as lippy hacks I hate cocky bouncers
I ain't ere to rave i'm ere to get paid, look
You search me up rough like I'm any common crook
Y name's on the flyer man, forget the guest book
Abusin' your authority, you look like a fool
You faulty standard underdog, you know you're old skool
I ain't wearin' a shirt and shoes, so you don't think I look right
But its cushty mate, I'm gettin paid more than you tonight
