[Intro: Jammer]
It's the Murkle Man
Neckle, neckle
Murkle Man remix
And we're neckling
It's nothing long
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

[Hook: Jammer]
It's the Murkle Man
Never gonna flex like Urkel, man
Come to your ends and circle man
All for the green and purple, man
It's the Murkle Guy
Never gonna flex like Urkel guy
Come to your ends and circle guy
All for the green and purple

[Verse 1: Dizzee]
Check out the audacity
Bredders can't work out my strategy
Talking 'bout they can't wait till they catch me
Say they wanna body-bag and snatch me
What is the problem? Exactly
Can't work out why they're so angry
Whole lot of hostility and jealousy
Must be a whole lot of insecurity
Really act so unnecessarily
Come with a lot of negative energy
Say I can't come through their territory
But you know I still roll through merrily
Walk on point and I walk readily
Any bwoy test, get beef heavily
Eye on the lead, nobody bury me
Don't take my word for it, you'll see

[Hook: Jammer]
It's the Murkle Man
Never gonna flex like Urkel, man
Come to your ends and circle man
All for the green and purple, man
It's the Murkle Guy
Never gonna flex like Urkel guy
Come to your ends and circle guy
All for the green and purple

[Verse 2: Jammer]
You can ask D Double E, I'm an evil guy
If you see me, you might get an evil eye
Don't beg any friend, don't give a blind
Dun know me, it the Murkle Guy
When I release my tune, this gonna go high
In the charts, it's gonna fly
When I go to Carnival, spit my lyric
Bet you all the money someone's gonna die
Chemical reaction, [?]
I'll bring the energy, I'll make the night
Murkle Man came into the light
Top Producer, now upon mic
When I spin my bars, I'll make a big man bite
Got a bright future, [?]
But until then, till I get hype
Dizzee Rascal'll make your bars spin like

[Hook: Jammer]
It's the Murkle Man
Never gonna flex like Urkel, man
Come to your ends and circle man
All for the green and purple, man
It's the Murkle Guy
Never gonna flex like Urkel guy
Come to your ends and circle guy
All for the green and purple

[Verse 3: D Double E]
Pure MCs think they're heavy like metal
Said they gon' dump on you, ain't got a TEC-cle
And the CD be gassed, I looked F like effle
Them MCs got happy before I switched like Jekyll
Couldn't tek a foot
I think I [?] metal before
Draw for the metal with the bill [?]
Troub-troub-trouble the Double
Can't help lyricists, I'm that guy, son
You can spit bars if you wanna come and die, son
You can spit bars give it your best try son
Bus' to the head like M. Bison
In a war start waving goodbye son
Lyrical levels are too high son
No word of a little lie son

[Hook: Jammer]
It's the Murkle Man
Never gonna flex like Urkel, man
Come to your ends and circle man
All for the green and purple, man
It's the Murkle Guy
Never gonna flex like Urkel guy
Come to your ends and circle guy
All for the green and purple
