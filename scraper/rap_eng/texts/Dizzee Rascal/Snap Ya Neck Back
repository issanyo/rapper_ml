808 {x14}
808 {x4}
808 snare snap ya neck back
808 snare snap ya neck back clap
808 snare snap ya neck back
808 snare snap ya neck back clap
808, 808, 808, clap
808, 808, 808 snap your neck back
808, 808
Snap ya neck back

[Verse One: Dizze Rascal]
Turn up the bass
Sweating in my iris, [?] get outta my space
So I slap out the taste, don' mash up the place
Put the peddle to the metal, just pick up the pace
Black windows, can't check out my face
Just give up the chase, back off my case
Get off my sack, you don't wanna have a heart attack
I got an 808 to make your neck snap
No space, [?] no space in the trunk
Just a whole lot of chump and a lot more bump
And a little bit of old school G-Funk
When I see a red light that'll get drunk
[?] but I've never been a punk
No I don't drive drunk, a pocket full of high grade skunk
That's why I'm too blunt and I don't give a fuck
Who growl in the place now I'm pumped

[Hook]
Kick, clap
Bass, clap
Finger on that trigger pull back
Kick, clap
Bass, clap
Like a bullet in your face
Kick, clap
808, 808, 808, 808, 808
808, 808, 808, 808, 808 clap
808, 808, 808, 808, 808
808, 808 snap your neck back

[Verse Two: Bambu]
Ayo
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino, DJ Muggs and me
I rolled down my window, pack a smile and say
"Ayo it's all about that motherfucking low end bass"
Be at 6 in the morning police at my door
Fresh Chuck Taylor's across the bathroom floor
Out the back window, I made my escape
And I ain't even get a chance to grab my Cypress Hill tape
Everlasting bass, hope your amps got watts
Two twelves in the trunk with a custom made box
Out of Watts, California with a case and [?]
Fighting jail time back when I was pushing a Toyota
I roll up with a bunch of brown bald headed killers
And couple heavy eye shadow, shit talking sisters
And we all for a revolution, ready in the cut
But for now turn that motherfucking bass level up
Like...
