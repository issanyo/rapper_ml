I wanna see you dip, dip, dip

I wind upon ya hip, hip, hip
And never ever stop, stop, stop

I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you move like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you whine like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

I love it when I see a pretty girl winding
I can even watch a butters girl grindin'
Control the body with great timing
Ain't shy in the dark, there shining
Does someat to me when I see her vibes in
Drop it like it's hot, you got my tings rising
So frequent, there's no disguising
What d'you expect, that ain't surprising

These girls get my blood pressure rising
They're wiggling 'n' jiggling, I'm hidin'
Checkin' them back offers so them fightin'
So natural girls, so excitin'
Gotta bit on dis, don't wanna get right in
'Tis better now, widda mandem fightin'
Never ever shit, no matter scores risin'
'Scuse me, you really gotta say somethin'

I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

Girlfriend, how you whine like that
Beautiful. you look so fine like that
Ain't seen her for a long time like that
You should go to jail for a crime like that
Buss up the floor, you don't cut no slack
Dancehall King, you're not at all laid back
Make up for what the uvva girls lack
Look so good, you got me going off ch...ch.ch, track
I can't even chat
While ma heartbeats going rat-at-tat-tat
So serious, ya got me ill like that
Temperature rising y'know, I feel like that
Nah fo'real, ya could kill like that
Widda double D, wi' pure skill like that
I can't get enuff, so it's real like that
I'd love it if ya'd flex wiv Dil like that

Ok, alright

Alright, ok

Ok, alright

Gosh golly, my oh my
Hoping that you ain't looking at any other guy
Your figure is so pleasin' to the eye
Especially when you do the bubble or the butterfly
See a bit of sweat drippin' down your thigh
But somehow, you still stay high an' dry
Gosh, ya make a Rude Boi so shy
Got the whole club sayin' my oh my
Please don't stop, please don't stop, give it
If not, show me how I gotta get wiv it
You're da best, I ain't scared to admit it
What's the deal, you're looking at me like izzit?
But ya won't know less ya come pay a visit
Life's too short to be cautious, innit
Don't just stand on the edge, come live it

I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you move like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you whine like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
