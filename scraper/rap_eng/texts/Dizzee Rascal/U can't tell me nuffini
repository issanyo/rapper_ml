Cause I've been through madness, 'nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness, 'nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama, 'nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter 'cause I'm still here
D, the I, the Z Z, the E, the E
Straight from the LDN
I don't wanna hear no talk about streets
And all that thug from way back when
Been a bad boy, I'll destroy your joy
Gotta toy that'll put that shit to an end
That and I walk the walk 'cause I talk the talk
You got a problem, step to me then
Otherwise don't pretend, stop, breathe, count to ten
Keep on chatting or get the length
I stand up tall, I don't bend
So if you got a crew, go get your men
We can meet up, say where and when
I'll be on time like Big Ben
Couldn't ever take me for a speng
And I ain't saying it again
Cause I've been through madness, 'nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness, 'nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama, 'nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter 'cause I'm still here
I like to move it, move it
You want beef, prove it
You got a problem, don't excuse it
You got a 9mm, it's your prerogative, use it
You got a temper, lose it
If not just bounce to the music
That's a better choice anyway, choose it
'Cause you know that you can't refuse it
Watch the beat, how I bruise it
Wild out and nod your head, stupid
I ain't cupid, no love lost
I get paid in the end whatever the cost
I'm the boss, still work with me
Don't stand looking pretty like Kate Moss
Put your hands up like you couldn't give a toss
Either way, you know I'm gonna get my point across
Cause I've been through madness, 'nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness, 'nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama, 'nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter 'cause I'm still here
I'm still here
Get me? I'm still fucking here
I don't give a shit
I don't answer to none of you pussy-holes
I live my fucking life, yeah
I live my fucking life, fuck you, what
Oi rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?
These pussy-holes don't want no war
They're just acting, I've seen it before
They're just acting, I've seen it before
Rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?
These pussy-holes don't want no war
They're just acting, I've seen it before
They're just acting, I've seen it before
Finally, fuck, who's listening?
The world don't owe me shit
And the feeling's mutual
I just wanna be neutral
But I ain't no prick
So no, I don't smile when I see you, grin when I greet you
If it weren't business I'd beat you
And I'd rather be a asshole than a pussy-hole
You're a bitch and I see through
So fuck you and fuck your ego
'Cause I really was a poor little Negro
Don't need no chain or a throwback
I'm really from the streets and you know that
But I really would rather be touring
'Cause most players on the roads ain't scoring
But now it's Maths and English, I'm focused
And it's Dirtee Stank, so take notice
Cause I've been through madness, 'nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness, 'nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama, 'nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter 'cause I'm still here
You can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
