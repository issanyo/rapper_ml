[Chorus: Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The first thing that she said

[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
Temptation greets you like your naughty mate
The one that used to get you in bother
But one you could never bring yourself to hate
And she said we've got that spark
But only lights a fuse, helps you see in the dark
But it's a sight you'll lose when
The temptation greets you like your naughty friend

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
Temptation greets you like your naughty mate
The one that made you steal and set things on fire
The one you haven't seen of late
And I said that kind of talk
Only adds intrigue to the cauldron of thought
It's already exceeding
Temptation, the very thing that held her back

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead
I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it
And your hands where I can

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, it's Rasc' gettin' dirtee stankin', yeah
We used to be in tight, me and my naughty friends
Caused pure madness in the end, I mean day and night
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
Smoking, drinking, drag riding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless youngsters, no direction, no sign of correction
But then I switched it off, changed my ways
Run the area like, "Oh, my days"
But a lot of my naughty friends, they're not phased
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things that we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just one
But it's hard to fight the temptation, son

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
The panic will fall down around you
If you don't do what I say

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead
I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it
And your hands where I can
