[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
My name's Dizzee Ras an' I entertain
I got a hot head but I use my brain
A lot of wicked MC's but we ain't the same
I got flows and money that I put out to shame
Cause I'm big in the game and livin' with fame
You late in the lane, no name, what you tryna claim?
Tryna test my fame, what do you think you're tryin' to gain
Now put the mic down, don't try your game
Grime had a little time without me, still no grime without me
No life without me
No Risky Roads, no Grime Daily
I'm still shady, fuck you, pay me
If you don't like it, fuck you, replace me
Oh my God, are you fucking crazy?
I seen it all, now fuckin' face me
Sleep on me, you're just fucking lazy

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal]
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play ya, you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play ya, you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play and you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
Heavy

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Wake up and slap yourself
Best still get strapped and clack yourself
You ain't heavy yourself, you can't catch yourself
Keep running your mouth, just relax yourself
Doing over class, rest you're ass, you're too fast
Can't carry on like that, you won't last
What the Rass, who's the Rass? There's no task
Over here hits on the MC, do ask
Like sippidy doo da
I bustin' a rudeboy then take a plane to Aruba
I got next moves like Lex Luger
But there ain't no cattin' for free, I'll just do ya
No leg drop, just a head talk
I don't care if you're bald or dreadlocked
Afro, blond, ginger, red top it's all the same
All ya see is the red dot

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal]
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play ya, you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play ya, you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play ya, you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
Heavy

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
Ah forget it, you just don't get it
I got pure figures, I don't need street credit
I can pay with cash or I can pay with debit
Or I can do it the old way and leg it
Big up the Bow E3, I still rep it, I still name check it
Nothing but L.O.V, you can't dead it
But big up the KNT cause I said it
Nah, I don't leg it
I ride on it, supersonic, buy land on it
Spend a few hundred grand on it
Still ride around with a bee in my bonnet
Making her vomit cause I blew up like tiptronic
We smoke cheese round here we don't smoke chronic
It's no joke, when you talk you choke on it
Tie a rope on it but don't hold on to it
Puff, puff pass but don't loaf on it
Cause

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal]
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play ya, you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play ya, you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play ya, you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
Heavy

I-I-I'm so heavy
I'm on point all day
Better stay out my way
I don't play and you're not ready
All I can say is I'm so heavy
