[Hook]
Sick of this shit
Sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
I said I’m sick of this shit, sick of this shit
Sick of this shit, I’m sick of this shit

[Verse 1]
Sick of these fakes
Sick of these low life snakes I don’t rate
Sick of these beg friend bredders tryna eat off my plate, want a cut of my cake it’s [?]
When I was a kid I was sick of the estate
Now I vacate
Sick of detours I just wanna fly straight
Sick of these whores tryna make me wait
I don’t wanna date
Sick of comparisons I don’t relate
I don’t wanna hate but for goodness sake
Sick of these hipsters
Sick of these tricksters
All in the mix I’m sick of it mate
Sick of these boy dem
Sick of these jakes
What’s it gonna take?
Are you awake?
Sick of this government, look at the state
Same old debate
Just give me a break

[Hook]
I’m sick of this shit
Sick of this shit, I’m sick of this shit (fuckin’ bollocks)
I said I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit

[Verse 2]
Sick of your status
Sick of your selfies
Sick of your updates about how you’re so healthy
I can’t say  I’m sick of bein’ wealthy
But I’m sick of these foreginers sayin’ that they support Chelsea
God help me
I’m sick of these frauds and the bullshit they’re tryna sell me
Sick of O2 tryna bell me
If I wanted customer service I would have called what more could you tell me?
I do not need to be held G
I am not sick or elderly
But I’m sick of MCs and their useless minions talkin like they could ever shell me
You smell me?
I might well be

[Hook]
I’m sick of this shit
Sick of this shit, I’m sick of this shit (fuckin’ bollocks)
I said I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit

[Verse 3]
Sick of forced banter
Sick of bein’ nice when I think you’re a complete wanker
Sick of tryna hide my anger
Sick of sayin’ I don’t pander
Or pamper
Sick of takin’ girls that I don’t even know too tough to a restaurant, payin’ for the bil when they got no manners don’t even wanna thank ya
I am not Sampha
And this is not a goddamn mantra, Bianca
And I am not a goddamn banker
Now I sound like a rambler
Like I run Uganda
Shittin’ on Bhangra but I’m not a gambler
Sittin’ on amber
Sick of Balmain I should bring back Wrangler

[Hook]
I’m sick of this shit, sick of this shit
Sick of this shit, I’m sick of this shit
I said I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
I said I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
I’m sick of this shit
