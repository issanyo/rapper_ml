[Intro]
(some sort of movie quote?)
Take him to the darkest dungeon
Introduce him to the rack
Feed him up on bread and water
Watch his nerves begin to crack [scream & cackle]

[Hook 1: Pimp C sample]
Never snitch, never tell
Get caught up, go back to jail
Before I tell them hoes shit
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick

[Verse 1]
Litter out for these squeeze with
A mad magazine’s please beat this shit is
Burning three degree with me week
Its gotta be
A seventh step to this cyclic solar lottery
Awfully hot and be honestly
I so design this concrete lobby
That you don’t even want to walk with me
A corpse is stark and ever laid and thought
Oh what was that dichotomy
At the same time so alive
They thrive from bombing me
A file from wild economy
The styles are so designed for serving poverty
My god, they got the child convinced
Of the lie that he’ll die honorably

[Hook 2]
There's nothing they would do for you, differently
They're not even listening
They don't even glean what we're existing in
There's nothing here but love and you
Groveling, look what they're accomplishing
The systematic gods have all demolished it
But I've never felt so brave
As when I'm looking at your face
They can decimate my body
But my heart will not disgrace
They can torture and interrogate
And shackle to my boot
I will gnaw off my own leg
And hop the fuck right back to you

[Hook 1: Pimp C sample]
Never snitch, never tell
Get caught up, go back to jail
Before I tell them hoes shit
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick

You are now listening to the sound of
WeAreAllGoingToBurnInHellMegamix2…2...2...2...2...2...2


[Verse 2]
I know there's
Something good that I'd die here for
Something great that I'd live here for
Something fly that I'd write for you
Something wrong that I'd fight you for
Something sick that you'd cure me of
Something said to make sure you're loved
Some of us cannot trust no one
Some of us don't deserve no trust
Nothing wrong with not being strong
Nothing says we defeat what's wrong
Nothing manmade remains made long
That's a debt you  can't back out of
Nothing that they can take from you
Nothing that they can do to me
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
Nothing left here but you and me

[Hook 2]
There's nothing they would do for you, differently
They're not even listening
They don't even glean what we're existing in
There's nothing here but love and you
Groveling, look what they're accomplishing
The systematic gods of all demolishing
But I've never felt so brave
As when I'm looking at your face
They can rape and break my body
But my heart will not disgrace
They can torture and interrogate
And shackle to my boot
I would gnaw off my own leg
And hop the fuck right back to you

[Hook 1: Pimp C sample]
Never snitch, never tell
Get caught up, go back to jail
Before I tell them hoes shit
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick
