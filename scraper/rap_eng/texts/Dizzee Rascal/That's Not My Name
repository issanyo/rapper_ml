Four little words just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue
And I, I keep stalling, keeping me together
People around going to find something to say now
Holding back every day the same
Don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
But with nothing to consider they forgot my name

CHORUS
They call me Blood
They call me Rude Boy
They call me Oi
They call me Mate
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me Maiyou
But I'm a fly you
They use the N-word like it's a game
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

I miss the catch if you throw me the ball
I'm the last kid standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these lights they keep be balling
Getting glammed up and sitting on a fence now
So alone all time at night
I locked myself away, listen to me, oh no
Although I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered they forget my name

CHORUS

Are you calling me Rude Boy?
Are you calling me Blood?
Are you calling me Maiyou?
Are you calling me Mate?

CHORUS

Don't call me Rude Boy
Don't call me Rude Boy
Don't want to hear no no Rude Boy
I ain't no Rude Boy
Don't call me Maiyou
Who you calling Maiyou?
My name not Maiyou
Who you calling Maiyou?
I'm Dizzee Rascal
I'm Dizzee Rascal
I'm just a Rascal
Rude Dizzee Rascal
I'm Dizzee Rascal
I'm Dizzee Rascal
I'm in the Live Lounge
We got the Ting Tings
