[Verse 1]
Getting this cabbage
Rip up and ravage
Make it a habit for damage
Whole lotta baggage
You will not manage, I'm the full package
Why do they talk like I am not established?
That is so callous, they are the saddest
Why are they so full of malice?
Making up fallacies
I'm in my palace blazing up the chalice with Alice
'Cause I'm a gyalist and I'm the baddest
It's not a travesty
Call me "Your Majesty"
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my phallus
Push out my chest and I big up my status
Where's all the trappers?
Where's all the clappers?
I am not shaken, no need for maracas
Or apparatus
Put in the work and spend money on motors and slappers
Why-

[Verse 2]
Moving nippy
Taking the micky
And I get trippy
And I'm reckless letting loose in the city
Don't get lippy
Don't get witty
It'll get sticky
Have your people saying "Oh what a pity"
Call a committee
It'll get shitty
Won't be pretty
Nuttin' ain't bitty
I'm not a kitty
You don't wanna see me hit it with the nitty gritty
Don't be silly
You don't wanna see me get cold and chilly
Bold as Billy
Bold as brass
Broken glass
Pain in the ass
Legs in the cast
Left in the past
Left in the marsh
That'll be harsh
Snake in the grass
Pull off the mask
Now you're on blast
Don't be daft
Why you looking at me like you don't know what to ask?
Like you never knew I'm in a whole 'nother class
Like what the ras'
Making it last
Eat MCs

[Verse 3]
Breaking a fast
Cuttin' them carbs
Working them calves
Wearing this ting I'm fit for the task
It's not a fast
Wrist on charge
Fully on barge
Havin' it large
It's no mirage
Lit up the darker
Move like a shark
I'm quick off the mark
Pull off the heart
I pull up and park
Roll up a spark
With full disregard
Fully in charge
Keep up your guard
I guarantee-

[Verse 4]
Don't pet or pander
Leave em' hanging
I'll be damned, man to man
Hit em' with the overhand
Release the anger
WORLDSTAR, you can dealt with on camera
Understand my grammar
I don't stutter, lisp, or stammer
Watch me blaze the beat
I must admit, it hits just like a hammer
It's a banger for the mandem on the street, in the slammer
Bang your doors, bang your doors
For the cause
Breaking laws
Breaking jaws
Open paws
Pokerboards
Taking scores
And be sure
Never let a bredda get one over yours
Never put money over whores
Maybe or
It's crazy flawed
It's a myth
Life's a gift
Made me pause
Catch my drift
Smoke a spliff
And get in a draw

[Verse 5]
Paid the cost to be the boss
Ball and floss
Jesus cros-

On my way to the Ritz
On my wrist is glistenin'
Hublot whistlin'
I ain't even listenin'
Spare me the fiction
I'm not a victim
Swear I been twisting
With a lil mixting [?]
Pretty lil tips
She's a lil vixen
Pivot on the shifting
Little bit of friction
No resistance
Testin' the pistons
And I'm on a mission
Lemon in my system
Bit of an addiction
But it's upliftin'
[?]
[?]
Shoulda been around for my godson's Christenin'
But I was distant
Had a premonition
I was reminiscin'
Look at all the shit we was riskin'
Back then when we never had a pot to piss in
So full of mischief
Now it's all different
Brothas on my timeline tryna act ign'ant
And it's all instant
I'm not an infant
Now I got a [?] Vincent
And I'm insistent
'Cause I can't think
Hangin' on the brink
Better call my assistant
Handle my business
Bitches on my case 'cause I'm inconsistent

[Verse 6]
