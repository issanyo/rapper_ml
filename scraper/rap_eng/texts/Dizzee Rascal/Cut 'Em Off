[Intro]
I socialize and negotiate (review the situation)
I socialize and negotiate (review the situation)
I socialize and negotiate (review the situation)
Then cut 'em off
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over

[Verse 1]
My name is Raskit, listen to my flow
I socialize in Hackney and Bow
I wear my trousers ridiculously low
I love females, money and creps
I'm kind of streetwise, I think that you should know
You're not a bad boy, you're putting on a show
You talking bad, creeping up on Rascal
So keep creep crawling cause I'm taking bigger steps
My name is Raskit, listen to my slang
I socialize with the crew and the gang
Road youth, so the streets is where I hang
I'll make you collapse, leave gaps in your face
You're in your neighborhood thinking that you're nang (ho please)
You got your people thinking that I'm done (ho please)
But if you try it, I'll make the ratchet bang
You could never outplay me, I'm an ace
I'm not a smoker, but I blaze a lot (uh huh)
Sit around puffing, waste my days a lot
And though I shouldn't waste time 'cause I ain't got a lot
I'm just lazy (yeah)
I'm not a rachet, but I bang a lot
Got a couple beanies that I slam a lot
I'll make 'em happy with my fingers on my hand a lot (finger)
I'm just crazy

[Hook]
Socialize, negotiate
And cut 'em off, we cut 'em off, yo
Socialize, negotiate
We cut 'em off, yo
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over
(Do you know what street is?)

[Verse 2]
There you go again talking like a div (shit)
Like I can't find out where you live (why it's easy)
Kick off your latch, I don't even need a ratch (click)
My butterfly leave you looking like a sieve
I've met bad boys from every postcode
You could never talk to me about road
Stop dreaming, I'm your worst nightmare (yeah)
I'm Freddy Krueger, make the Luger explode
Now there you go again talking like a star
Like I can't find out where you par
Kick off your door, I ain't got a 4-4, bruh
I'll have to settle for a long metal bar
I've met bad boys from every rough ends
You could never talk to me about skengs (click click)
You talk tough, but you ain't saying much
I'll chop you up and share you out between your friends
Now some love me, some do the opposite
If you feel to move to me, please get on with it
Don't know why you feel the need to talk to birds
But talk is dangerous, be careful with your words (yo)
And just remember this, I am you
So if you think you're real, do what you gotta do
On the level, you're just challenging yourself
So if you're feeling brave, go ahead and hurt yourself

[Hook]
Socialize, negotiate
And cut 'em off, we cut 'em off, yo
Socialize, negotiate
We cut 'em off, yo
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over

[Outro ]
We cut 'em off, we cut 'em off
Review the situation
Take part
And take over
Nothing else
We cut 'em off, we cut 'em off
We cut 'em off, we cut 'em off
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over
Review the situation, take part, take over
