[Intro: Caramel]
Love talks to everyone
Love talks to everyone
Love talks to everyone, money talks more
Love talks to everyone, money talks more
Love talks to everyone, money talks more
I couldn't be a chief, money money money
Love talks to everyone, money talks more
I couldn't be a chief, I couldn't be a chief

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Big shout to the boy who thinks he's a dappa
You're looking at your jewelry thinking you're a dappa
Now you're round your way trying say you're a dappa
I'll stop you in your midst with a blitz von clapper
Big shout to the boy who thinks he's a don
You're looking at your Avirex thinking you're a don
Now you're in your ends with your friends, you're a don
I'll catch you by yourself, make your health full gone
Big shout to the boy who thinks he's a scones
You're looking at your half ounce thinking you're a scones
You're always walking round trying sound like a scones
But make no mistake, you're a fake, Dizzee knows
Big shout to the boy who thinks he's a G
You're looking at your fake watch thinking you're a G
I see you Stratford Rex tryna flex like a G
Looking for your yat she was sat next to me

[Hook: Caramel, Dizzee Rascal]
You could be a dappa (what?)
You could be a don (uh)
But I ain't watching face
I don't care where you're from
Look, show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your won? (uh)
Show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your won? (come again)
You could be a scones (scones)
You could be a G (G)
But pass anything (anything)
[?] to me
Show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your won?
Yes, show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your won?

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Big shout to the girl who thinks she's a diva
You're at your dressing table thinking you're a diva
But steady tryna walk, tryna talk like a diva
But now you just wonder and underachiever
Big shout to the girl who thinks she's a devil
You're looking for a way to cause harm like a devil
You're sitting in your yard talking hard like a devil
Cold bit a gold digger looking for a medal
Big shout to the girl who thinks she's a swingers
You're getting up your gums to da boys like a swingers
You're chatting to a brare, you don't care, you're a swingers
Now you're on the floor reading war for beginners
Big shout to the girl who thinks it's a game
You're always chatting air, must've been like a game
You chat the dizzy man rude like a game
Don't make me have to skitz, keep your lips from my name


[Hook: Caramel, Dizzee Rascal]
You could be a dappa (what?)

Yo, show me what you're on (what do you want, man?)
Where's your cash, where's your won?

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal, Caramel]
I heard you got a problem with me? (Rude boy, listen)
Why you tryna make enemies?(Rude boy, listen)
Go and get your street family(Rude boy, listen)
I'll be waiting patiently (Rude boy, listen)

Any little way of getting fame (Rude girl, check it)
Me and your man ain't the same (Rude girl, check it)
You ain't got no shame (Rude girl, check it)
