Intro/Pre-Chorus:
Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
D-D-Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Lord knows what I’ll find when I reach (rewind)
D-Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Dig real deep through the depths of my mind (‘cause I)
Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Lord knows what I’ll find when I reach reach

Hook:
(‘cause I got) so much to say, in so little time
In such a short space I’ve got so much to do
But if I can’t find a way around, I’ll find a way across
And if I can’t a way across, I’ll bore straight through X2

Verse 1:
I find myself in a pickle
This music game is fickle
Surrounded by big dogs that I consider lickle
As they try-‘n’ step I tickle…
… feet-of the giants and my appliance of knowledge makes waves from a ripple
On my shoulder is a chip(‘ll)
Some love it, some hate the idea
I still publicly thug it
Squeeze a dollar from a nickel
My outlook: feel free to judge it
I’ll be damned if you budge it
Got my name on my chequebook – sole trading
I ain’t even old ageing but question if my souls fading
I’m maintaining
‘cause I can’t say I’m ?????
But who’s to say I’ll make unless I fake it
And if I phonify myself, will it bonify my wealth
It’s painstaking I’ve got my head aching
Stressed out ‘cause I let my money rake in

Hook

Verse 1:
Through my trials and tribulations, I skip across the nation
High sky flier I see no limitations
Only God’s creations and devil’s temptations
I seek to reap the benefits of my publications
So show me where’s the money, spare me the congra-tu-lation
Forget the industry’s bewilderment and fascination
Everybody wanna be ghetto but nobody wanna be poor
All you follow fashion dummies ain’t eating no more
You can dirty stank to thank me, you can start with cheque
But I you choose to blank, I take it to the next step
I couldn’t be a fool I keep it gully to the n..????
Rewind and recall, I demand and collect

Hook

Verse 3:
To all my UK road youts
Stick on your hustle boots (yeah)
Steady on trudge along
Operation get the wong
In and out, come and gone
Find yourself a craft, harness it and make it strong
Perfect it
Before you know they’ll respect it
Remember, it’s your movie so direct it
Never let nobody tamper with it or correct
And by any means do what you gotta to protect it
‘cause there’s money to be made, it’s a cold world too
Nobody got your best interest at heart like you
So any obstacles you come across, find your way around
But if you feel it can’t be found
BORE STRAIGHT THROUGH

Hook

Outro:
Dig real deep through depths of my mind
Lord knows what I’ll find when I bore straight through X2
Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
D-Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
D-D-Dig real deep through the depths of my mind
Lord knows what I’ll find when I reach
Rewind to the years when a teacher couldn’t teach
Think back to the days when I couldn’t be told
Now it’s a few years and I feel lost
Tryna live the high life, but at what cost?
