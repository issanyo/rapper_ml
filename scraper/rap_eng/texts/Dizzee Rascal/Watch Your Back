[Verse 1:]
So you wanna be a bad man but you're barely a bad boy
Keep going and the way you keep going
Not before long you'll see you'll only gonna be a sad boy
Yea you're hot right now but you ain't the only my boy
Keep it up, you'll get stabbed, boy
It will be very inconvenient
You'll be coughin up blood like a idiot
And your recovery won't be immediate
And the healing pain â€“ you'll be feeling it
If you don't wanna die cold just come off the road
It's simple, it don't take a genius
I know your body on lock and you use the hardest
You're on this ting and your game's the largest
But everything you stand for is retarded
The grim reaper will disregard it
You wear your face on a t-shirt? Fine
But I ain't gonna put your face on mine
I fuck a few, no I ain't got time
So you'd better just welcome your mind
You've got a brain, start using it
You've got a chance at life, stop abusing it
It will be a damn waste just losin it
But if you wanna be a G go through with it

[Hook:]
You'd better watch your back
'Cause your so called friends ain't got yo back
And the haters will gonna try hold you back
And they're dying, waiting to stab your back
And you're only gonna wanna go get em whacked
When you go too fast no turning back
What's done is done, can't take it back
So you better wise up and face the facts

[Verse 2:]
Way you proving, think you're on top but you're really losing
Cruising for a bruising, it ain't amusing
It won't be a joke when you're on the news 'cause of the way you're movin
There's no excusing, you should be choosing life in a Jacuzzi instead you're screaming sue you
What you know about LA shootings?
If you ain't been States, you ain't even been to too here(?)
Can't do a drive-by with no car
And if you shoot you ain't gonna get far
You're bait, everybody knows who you are
So you might as well say it's a par
If you're doing it to impress the hoes
Same hoe when you're locked up will fuck yo bro
Should be walkin, start touchin toes
Suckin slow, aloud in yo face, what the fuck do you know?
Every time I look at my Hublot
It reminds me I'm a boss so you go
I'd let you get your stars strapped but you ain't got a clue tho
I know you're gonna make it, who knows?
But keep your head in your books and stay away from them crooks
And mind your mouth, it don't mean that you're shook
And the gangsta shit, it ain't quite what it looks
So quit the half and take note for the hook off(?)

[Hook: x2]
You'd better watch your back
'Cause your so called friends ain't got yo back
And the haters will gonna try hold you back
And they're dying, waiting to stab your back
And you're only gonna wanna go get em whacked
When you go too fast no turning back
What's done is done, can't take it back
So you better wise up and face the facts

[Verse 3:]
Yo cousin! I know you're not budgin
It makes no difference to me, I'm buzzin
My floss comin down, a dozen it's really laughin
It's like you in a hurry to die, why you rushin
You're only gonna suffer when it all comes crashin'
And it called your bluffin, he could a hard something
You still facin the fact, ain't nobody's laughin
Make a wrong move and you're gonna get tucked in
Gonna rushed in, A&E, feelin' disgustin'
You can't go piss cause you're ain't even plugged in
The key to life is not a fuck thing
Ain't no trust in fucks, there's no love king
Crime don't pay unless you do the big
And if you do your bid be ready to deal with
The bullshit, stress, the haters and the pigs
So don't be so fast and try being a kid, just live

[Hook: x2]
You'd better watch your back
'Cause your so called friends ain't got yo back
And the haters will gonna try hold you back
And they're dying, waiting to stab your back
And you're only gonna wanna go get em whacked
When you go too fast no turning back
What's done is done, can't take it back
So you better wise up and face the facts
