[INTRO]
So what d'you think you know 'bout London city now aye
What'cha think you know ?
Big Ben tells the time (stand up, stand up)

Above the London roads that hold the grime (the grime)
Young hustlers we graft all the time
Non stop UK wot

[BACKGROUND]
East London, ghetto, west London, ghetto, north London ghetto, south London
East London, ghetto, west London, ghetto, north London ghetto, south London

[VERSE 1]

Yo as I hustle in the city for a paper stack
Lord knows I got the devil on ma back
It's a cold world, I gotta stay on track
Dog eat dog, others gain if you lack
In the LDN, where I learn to attract
Clientele, I can show you where it's at
First things first, get a plot 'n' a flat
Next up, get a black hoodie and a hat
Living in the big brother's camera view
Keep an eye out for the boys in blue
Straight 5 years, getting caught, that's you
Sitting in a cell, still wondering who
Couldn't keep quiet, now you're on a diet
Mash potatoes, cauliflower and stew
Pissed off with not a lot to do
And the word on the street don't ever seem new
And none of it don't ever seem true
Endless hype, who do you believe?
And will it relieve the loneliness at night
(You) Remain deceived if you're convinced it might
You know full well what the streets are like
Few more Merc's, couple more ranges
Other than that, not a lot else changes

[Chorus]
Sky looks grey in London city
We stay graftin', 'cos we're gritty
Hustle hustle constantly, hustle hustle hustle constantly
Sky looks grey in London city
We stay graftin', 'cos we're gritty
Hustle hustle constantly, hustle hustle hustle constantly

[VERSE 2]
I used to roll money up against the wall
Never did wanna play hopscotch
Now I'm pinnacle parking, laughing
'Cos I'm dark in a white man's cotch
And I've been doing this since Tamagotch'
I G.I. Joe anybody in my face, invadin' my space
I'll klingon star, bring it on star, WATCH!
By the end of the hours on the clock, I'll end your days
You'll think I'm crazed when I give you the midnight rock
End of sentence...full stop
Now what you gonna say about that
I'll put all your plans on lock
Make you put all your mans on the spot
I'm totally everything that you're not
I'm totally mad, you've lost the plot
To even consider getting me got
Carried off to a hospital block in shock
On the table, ready to operate, never mate
I dictate and delegate, who's heavyweight
I'm king of the ring, make moves in any state
LDN we do our thing

[Chorus]
Sky looks grey in London city
We stay graftin', 'cos we're gritty
Hustle hustle constantly, hustle hustle hustle constantly
Sky looks grey in London city
We stay graftin', 'cos we're gritty
Hustle hustle constantly, hustle hustle hustle constantly

Damn right, yeah
Young hustlers, London city stand up
I'm a show you, its gritty out ere
Yeah man serious...
I swear to you, it ain't all teacups (nah man)
Up in Buckingham Palace (nah man)
I'm a show you how gritty it is out here (yeah man)

It's Dizzee Rascal solo

Ghetto UK stand up
