[Verse 1]

I'm a young raggo bredder from the LDN
In my Nike Air bubbles and they cost 110
Got these beanies on my line and they all want the leng
I'm a ghetto superstar, come straight from the ends
And I walk it like I talk it, blood, I ain't just hype
Making moves for the money everyday and every night
Best to believe I keep it tight
Best to believe I'm moving right
Keep my business on the low, you best to believe I'm outta sight
I like money-money-money, girls-girls, cash-cash
I let the champagne splash
Yo, I'm not a gangbanger but I'm good with a mash
Make you scratch your head and wonder, is he really that flash?
But it really doesn't matter, cause you know I keep it moving
Middle of the dance floor, lean-up, grooving
Baby cocked her bumper out, you know I gotta wind it
When we leave the club, I'm gonna really get behind it

[Hook]

Nike Air bubbles on my feet looking fresh
And my brand-new garms on, dressed to impress
Got my phone line popping, all these beanies got a crush
Keep something in my pocket in case these bredders try and rush
Nike Air bubbles on my feet looking fresh
And my brand-new garms on, dressed to impress
Got my phone line popping, all these beanies got a crush
Keep something in my pocket in case these bredders try to rush

[Verse 2]

Brown eyes, 5'10, dark skin
I'm Mr Dizzee Rascal, why you even asking?
The undercover lover, girls call me buff ting
But used to keep a balaclava resting on my chin
And it's an ends ting, hustle-hustle, bling-bling
I'm not waiting around to hear the fat lady sing
The point of what I'm saying is the answer within
But life's a jungle, everybody wants to be the the king
But it's alright though, I got my eyes on the prize
Money in my grill, bigger picture in my eyes
Hands around my testicles, middle finger risen
Every step that I take is a step with precision
I'm precise, precisely why my future's looking nice
The penthouse is lovely, it's a shame about the price
But you only live twice, that's on the real
No matter where I am, I'll always be the real deal

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Education starts with discipline, I'm listening
But conversations kinda muffled since I got rich n ting
Verbal turd indirectly spoke, I never heard a thing
Underground or overground, what's the difference, I'm the king
Not divine right, it's my hindsight, I see it all
Because I ain't afraid to spread my wings and fly, you're a fool
Talking like you're mighty and you're high, but I know you're small
There's no logic in your gossip, just the writings on the wall
Over-ignorant, you ain't gully, you just play thug
Far from the realest, O-Dog, Menace, you're a mug
If you're deep, why have you gotta roll 50 to the club?
Blood, who do you think you are fooling with that fake crew love?
These streets don't care for no long-term plan
These roads don't give a damn about any man
I try and show these bredders, they refuse to understand
So I'll just keep doing what I'm doing while I can, man

[Hook]
