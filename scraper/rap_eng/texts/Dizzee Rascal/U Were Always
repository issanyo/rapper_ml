[Verse 1: Wiley]
I can tell you wanna come around cause (you were always)
Trying to make yourself so busy and (you were always)
Playing up, is this really gonna work cause (you were always)
Trying to make him fancy you and (you were always)
Going on like you love me up and (you were always)
Making him think you loved him up and (you were always)
Making me think twice about you cause (you were always)
Trying to make my head spin and (you were always)
Saying to me you're sure about this and (you were always)
Sulking when you don't get your way and (you were always)
Trying to catch me out so much and (you were always)
Talking about your feelings were strong and (you were always)
Making me think you're gonna do wrong and (you were always)
Trying to switch me off and on (you were always)
Trying to know what I am on and (you were always)
Forgetting that what we are doing is wrong and (you were always)

[Hook: Wiley]
But now we're (smiling)
You see, now I'm (smiling)
But now we're (smiling)
You see now I'm (smiling, smiling)

[Verse 2: Tinchy Stryder]
Trying to bring me down and (you were always)
Telling me to do this telling me to do that (you were always)
Trying to pretend you're busy for me (you were always)
Telling me you love me, telling me you want me (you were always)
Change your faults and blaming me (you were always)
Spying cause you had no trust (you were always)
That's when girl's say Tinchy's a must (you were always)
Trying to present your move on (you were always)
Trying to keep your eye on me (you were always)
Telling your friends you didn't care (you were always)
Phoning telling me you care (you were always)
Seeming to forget that I moved on (you were always)
Trying to tell me I need you (you were always)
Moaning, groaning, still not knowing (you were always)
Bredding me and begging me and (you were always)
Pretending that it weren't over (you were always)

[Hook: Wiley]
But now we're (smiling)
You see, now I'm (smiling)
But now we're (smiling)
You see now I'm (smiling, smiling)

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
We was tingzing time ago (you were always)
Sweet at first but swiftly changed (you were always)
Acting odd and acting strange (you were always)
Trying to keep me in control (you were always)
Flirting like some cheap hoe (you were always)
Playing some annoying mental game (you were always)
Wrong and you try and pass the blame (you were always)
Acting like I wouldn't go (you were always)
But here's the new difference though
But now I've moved along I'm more than strong (smiling)
And on my way to major pay (smiling)
Cause I'm near the sky, I'm rising high (smiling)
Cause it feels so good (smiling)
Cause I'm moving quick, believe me chick (smiling)
Now you're out of the way I fight the day (smiling)
You're a slag and you're swag (smiling)
You wouldn't test me if you could

[Hook: Wiley]
But now we're (smiling)
You see, now I'm (smiling)
But now we're (smiling)
You see now I'm (smiling, smiling)
