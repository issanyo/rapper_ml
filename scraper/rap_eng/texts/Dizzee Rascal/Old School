Ayo, MJ
Let me tell these people why I'm old school, man
I am not a Myspace MC, I'm a pirate MC
From Flava to DeJa
From Rinse to Major

[Hook]

Rude boy, don't watch that
When it comes to the roads, I lock that
Cause when it come to the flows I got that
Got cash, you could never try rob that
So move, the guy don't know you
That means you ain't old skool
From one pound pizza to note ball
K to the A I'm old skool

[Verse 1]

Look, I'm vocal but a lot of blokes chat a lot of breeze
But with me it's emotional, nigga I'm old skool
Like Opal Fruits, gobstoppers or screw balls
You new born babies, I'm a vet yep they know the cool
Spittin' through they headphones, no vocal booth
Look I go back like Flava FM, Tel still owes me some paper
Way before DeJa, (?) tapes with AB and the
Sound labs, no turntables 12-10's
And I was housing G, like closer than close
Till I found the MIC and the vocals I wrote
I'm so cool with my old skool shit, Adidas shell toes and my Stan Smiths
In EH with a PH, 3-3-7
From cassettes now it's my CD selling

[Hook]

Rude boy, don't watch that
When it came to the scene, I locked that
Cause when it come to the green, I stop that
Got cash, you can never try rob that
So move nigga, I don't know you
That means you ain't old skool
From one pound pizza to note ball
K to the A, so old skool
Hahaha niggas ain't old skool like me

[Verse 2]

Niggas know why I'm boss on the beat
Hardcore, never go soft on the street
From Boys Love Girls to London Town
I toured the world but locked London down
But certain reputations ain't deserving
Certain MC's ain't put the work in
But I had a few tunes before YouTube
And I was a known face before Channel U
From PP, wrets and EQ
In my Prada Straps and fucked Evisu's
Me and Danger Mouse but I'm no Penfold
And my intro, do I play? N-O
Look, look, that's one of my old skool lyrics
And I was in Eskimo, reloadin' it
But some MC's there were pissed I gone clear
And yeah I could win that battle on the stairs

[Hook]

Rude boy, don't watch that
When it came to the scene, I locked that
Cause when it come to the green, I stop that
Got cash, you can never try rob that
So move nigga, I don't know you
That means you ain't old skool
From one pound pizza to note ball
K to the A, I'm old skool
