Money Money Money girls
Money Money Money girls
Money Money Money, girls girls, cash cash
Dizzee diz i keep the money coming in
Eight hundred fifty pound jeans covering my shin
'coz my legs are skinny but my wallet ain't thin
Everytime i bust a smile it's a big money grin
And i can't stop grinning 'coz i don't stop winning
Everybody wanna bring it like they knew me from beginning
Change my number every week
My phone don't stop dingin'
Gotta change my home address
My bell don't stop ringin'
And i can't stop sinnin'
So i pray on the women
Take 'em to the player pad
For some late night swimmin'
Then we do the wild thing
'coz we finished skinny dippin'
Then i pray in the mornin'
That my willy ain't stingin'
Now she says she got a man
But her heart ain't in him
If he ever tries a ting
Then i'm gonna have to chin him
Yeah my attitudes mingin'
But i don't really give a friggin' rasclar
'coz i been a rude boy thats how i'm livin'

(alright) no rims on my car no twenty-two's
But i had a mortgage way before i turned twenty-two
Any who, really ain't concerned wi' who i tell it to
I got an attitude, similar, to a smelly shoe
If i laid my trainers out
I bet they stretch to Timbuktu
I got so many fitted hats
I don't know what the fuck to do
See me on the tele with Jeremy Paxman on the news
Gotta raise my profile and my money
Don't get it confused
I will never lose
Standardly, i'll always get my dues
You ain't never catch me sleeping
I will never snooze
But you still might catch me kickin' back
On a luxury cruise
With a freaky model
Blowin' me like a didgeridoo
It's just the shit that we do
On a regular
I'm tellin' ya
Try play me for my money
And i'll put a shell in ya
Now people think im ignorant
They say i'm too flash
All i know is money money, girls girls, cash cash!
So i say
Money money money, girls girls, cash cash

(you like) money money money, girls girls, cash cash
(we like) money money money, girls girls cash cash
