[Intro: Dizzee Rascal]
Uh
It's live O
Uh
Ey yo

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
And I hit 'em like a lightning bolt (What)
Five thousand volt, it's your own fault
Stand still, I'll put your whole crew to a halt (It's live O)
Cover emcees like pepper and salt (Uh)
Gunman bullets go right through your coat (Right through)
Nine milli, take Billy for a billy goat (What)
Lay low, roll deep on a river boat (River)
Cuttin' edge, Dizzee Rascal, cut throat
Rewind wind, move dick to the side (Side)
This soundboy's straight to the front line
Fuck her to the left, right, front or behind
Never nice, gotta be cruel to be kind (Right)
Dry lips sippin' on a dry white wine
Feel funny, take a draw of this, feel fine
Husband, I'll make your wifey be mine (Right)
Get pussy, get poom, get feline

[Chorus: ?]
Beware they're watching you
And nobody do the things they do
Do you really wanna ride on festival
Watch your back since Pay As U Go

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Yo
That yout wants to get lairy (Lairy)
I wile up a yout and make 'em get weary (Weary)
'Cause you don't know me and (What), you won't know me and (Uh-huh), you can't tell me shit (Yo)
I'm an OG (What)
And your girl she knows me quite well (Quite well)
She knows that I'm Wiley Kat
I met her at the hotel
My whole crew got terrible (Oh well)
Oi blud it was a choong hotel though (Choong)
I'm not gonna say though, how it went down though
Thongs came down though (What), skirts went up though (Oi), bras came off though
I weren't involved though (Nah)
But I'm still a player though, and I'm still a sprayer though (Sprayer)
I'm a brick layer though
Hustle for the dough, yo (Wha)
Gunshot no I don't, them can't see me yo (Yah yah)
Fully [?] star for the show
And I represent my crew, Pay As U Go
Ey yo

[Chorus: ?]
Beware they're watching you
And nobody do the things they do
Do you really wanna ride on festival
Watch your back since Pay As U Go

[Verse 3: Major Ace]
Okay
It's another hot 16 (Boydem)
I'm a hot boy, in the hottest team on the scene (We're really hot)
And you know who I mean
Please start talk to make cream
Now we're pulling up in limousines (Yo)
It's not my fault (Not my fault), girls go sick when I talk my talk
It's only standard that I walk my walk (I walk it)
Enough of a [?], three girls at the same time [?]
Gold diggers want respect they get nada
They just bow down low and blow til I trump
At the same tune to William [?]
I'm killing 'em
Bad from time I'm spinning 'em, chilling 'em
[?] flow like Eskimo 'til microphone phones that I been payrolled
As you know, I represent Pay As U Go
We ride or die 'til the end of the road, wigger

[Chorus: ?]
Beware they're watching you
And nobody do the things they do
Do you really wanna ride on festival
Watch your back since Pay As U Go

[Verse 4: Maxwell D]
Yo, yo, well

When I go get married, I me nuh sign the contact (That's right)
Things that me bike, me nuh really wan' half dat
Hope you don't mind, but you really shoulda know dat (Baby)
Baby good things to tell you (Uh-huh)
That you look good, when you stepping on the venue (Yeah)
Without your dress, we're individual
You shoulda been a [?], I guess I'm a victim (No way)
I wanna wake up in the morning (Uh-huh)
Maxwell love 'bout the [?]
Half heart love, 'cause there's no time wasting (No time wasting)
[?] reach for the ceiling (For me)
Unless a [?] of a man walk a mash (That's right )
Trust me no girl like the registration (That's true)
Some years are odd, some years are boring (That's right)
But me nuh cares 'cause I'm flexing and juicing

[Chorus: ?]
Beware they're watching you
And nobody do the things they do
Do you really wanna ride on festival
Watch your back since Pay As U Go
Beware they're watching you
And nobody do the things they do
Do you really wanna ride on festival
Watch your back since Pay As U Go
