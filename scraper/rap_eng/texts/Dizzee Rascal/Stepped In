[Intro: LD]
Still gang, gang, gang, gang on them, you know?
L, shows was a mazza
Sixty
All-a dat, all-a dat

[Verse 1: LD]
I stepped in on some gang ting
All my drillers in the background (Sixty)
LD talks real facts (L)
You can go and check my background (Check it)
Old school I used to phone bro, like, yo, M, bring the Mac 'round (M)
Still up to that same crud but we're having talks about racks now
(Racks)
Everyone's from the hood
But the difference is we get money here
And you know we got big waps
Enemies ain't coming here (No way)
And you know I'm on that stain shit
See a crop, and I'll run in there
Sound it off for the sake of it (Blow!)
Sounding like we brought a drum in there
I bang bang, for my hood (Bang)
Still the same motherfucker
That will get you bang-banged out your boogs (Bang, bang)
The industry gon' respect me
I'm a badman and they shook (Shook)
Award shows with the blickies on us, they know we're here but don't look (In here)
On the way to a show now and I'm stilling smelling of the bando
On the motes with Asap
Making sweeter drinks than mango (That's bro)
My main girl wanna fly out, but I'm getting busy in the flats though
In love with this war stuff
I know, opps know, the feds know, and the fans know
That six gang's still drilling
Do it like Fufu, grab and dip him
Excellent fishing
Roll up with smoke, spark and blow
Come like we're billing (Spark 'dat)
Either way man's winning (Ay)
Eating well in this music 'ting
And this rap game's so filling (Hm)

[Break: LD]
Comfy
Come on, man
Still gang anywhere
I'll cut anywhere, man
Young boy with links to the OG's
You know, man

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Raskit
It's live-o, yeah
Shellings
I know a couple drillers and felons
They talk like I fell off the face of the earth
And they sound so hurt
I just bought a couple more dwellings
Who are these bellends, and what are they selling?
Who are they telling?
I'll kick your head in, and press on the swelling
Yeah I'll split your melon, and spread out your melanin
Why are these breddas so feminine?
Mind the direction you're heading in
I'm so ahead of the game
I'm offended you would even mention me
In the same breath as these any-men
Any attempt to throw dirt on my name, will just make me a lot
And raise up my adrenaline
How many times have these breddas tried switch up the program?
And then turn around and say, "Dylan, I'm sorry, now can we be friends again?"
I don't wanna truce
The truth is, I'm way too loose
And if it's all music, keep it all in the booth
Make no excuses, I'm too exclusive
It's long in the tooth, and it's all useless
All of these bookey Judas moves
Just proves that they're all bloody losers
I'm so abusive, forgive my rudeness
I'm so ruthless
Lord of the manor, no home improvement
Raised in the manor
Manaman like me made the biggest movements
Forget the rumours
I school the students
Take trips to Toulouse, or to Bermuda, for the amusement
Lose your illusions and bemusements
You're confused, and you ain't got a clue who's who
Keep jumping to conclusions
Fool

[Break: LD]
Woi-oi
L, Raskit
Let me charge up for them
Ya' know?
Hmm
Sixty
All-a dat, all-a dat
Aye

[Verse 3: LD]
Still P.C.D. any time of day for anyone of my brodies (Waps)
New wap got the gang charged, gotta treat this one like a trophy
(Hm)
Masked up like he's LD (L)
Pussy boy you don't know me (No)
And you ain't with the six-gang
You ain't shot shit, you a phoney (Six)
Come a long way from selling benz's (Ha)
Now we might just tour the world, you see gang pullin' up in Benz's (Skrr, skrr)
Young boy in the back coolin' with the long one like it's fencing (Long one)
'Dem Gucci Frames look nice, til' ST fires up them lenses
Don't at meâ€”come check me
Either way, they respect me (They do)
Got (shh) touched, and (shh) touched
And I just sipped on my Tetley (Ha)
You see what happens when you vex me
Overseas with some sexy girls, and all of them wanna sex me
Think we're calm cause we're overseas, til' I kick a boy off his Jetski

[Outro: LD]
And I ain't playin' either, man
This for real, you know, L
Come on
The masked one
Sixty
All-a dat!
