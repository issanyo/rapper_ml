[Intro: Blue Magic]
Step right up, hurry, hurry before the show begins, my friends

[Verse 1: [L]ife]
Standing, ever so tall
This villain will never fall,
Keeping my stance in check
I move forward enduring
disorder that is surrounding
this mellow author.

My back off the wall
But my mind in the waters
flowing through
turbulent tides
tendency to turn
all of my lows into highs
the power of life,

Planning to take flight
and as he soars through the night
The London cityscape brighter
Than any star in my sight

From,
out the door to the streets.
Iâ€™m steady in my step,
no plan for me to retreat.
Slowly movin' and groovin'
in a state so euphoric.
I got my mind in a fortress
cannot be broken by forces.

I got my mind in a fortress
cannot be broken by forces.

Stand Up Tall.


[Verse: - Dizzee Rascal]
Raskit, Boy in da Corner, I still Roll Deep
Youngsta, gimme the beat and let me through
London city forever, you know I still creep
Ain't no stopping me ever, you best move
Live O, ghetto wherever with no redemption
World wide critics acclaim my big moves
Showtime, main event you can't defeat
Dizzee Ras hotter than Nelly I can't lose
East side boy, make the paper rise
Never been anything like these faker guys
Big up my north west, south east types
Every section where my connection lies
East-side boy, made the crowd go loops
Never had a desire for chinese zoots
Big up my Midlands, up north troops
Any playas in my face come up with a bruise

[Hook: Dizzee Rascal]
Get your backs up, backs up, back off the wall
Sounds of the Youngsta and Dizzee Rascal
Don't give it half-hearted, give it all
Pull up your socks and stand up tall
Backs up, backs up, back off the wall
Sounds of the young star, Dizzee Rascal
Don't give it half-hearted, give it all
Pull up your socks and stand up tall
