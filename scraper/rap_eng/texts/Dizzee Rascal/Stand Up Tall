[Verse1]
Raskit, Boy in da Corner, I still Roll Deep
Youngsta, gimme the beat and let me through
London city forever, you know I still creep
Ain't no stopping me ever, you best move
Live O, ghetto wherever with no redemption
World wide critics acclaim my big moves
Showtime, main event you can't defeat
Dizzee Ras hotter than Nelly I can't lose
East side boy, make the paper rise
Never been anything like these faker guys
Big up my north west, south east types
Every section where my connection lies
East-side boy, made the crowd go loops
Never had a desire for shiny suits
Big up my Midlands, up north troops
Any playas in my face come up with a bruise

[Hook]
Get your backs up, backs up, back off the wall
Sounds of the Youngsta and Dizzee Rascal
Don't give it half-hearted, give it all
Pull up your socks and stand up tall
Backs up, backs up, back off the wall
Sounds of the young star, Dizzee Rascal
Don't give it half-hearted, give it all
Pull up your socks and stand up tall

[Verse 2]
Can't run the marathon without training
Or stretch the art form without straining
Too much hype not enough braining
Whole lot o' money, little maintaining
Whole lot o' complaining, no plan
Little more, no less then ten grand
Blinging, ice sitting nice in your hand
Too much platinum, not enough land
East-side boy, make the paper rise
Never been anything like these faker guys
Big up my Ireland, Scotland types
Every section where my connection lies
East-side boy, made the crowd go loops
Never had a desire for Chinese zoots
Big up my Europe, USA troops
Any playas in my face come up with a bruise

[Hook]

[Bridge]
To my east-side crew get paper
To my west-side crew get paper
To my south-side crew get paper
And tell da playa hater, "see you later"
To my north-side crew get paper
To my midlands crew get paper
To my up north crew get paper
And tell da playa hater, "see you later"

(Dizzee rascal, the livest, loudest, dirtiest, grimiest
Most hot, Dirtee Stank
London stand up tall!)

[Verse 3]
Don't be silly come with your milli, I'm like billy
Don't be dumb come with your gun, I ain't fun
When I come I come ere to stun you get bunned
Midnight, broad daylight fight, dog fight
You don't really want it with Dizzee, I get busy
You don't really want me to pop, I'll get fizzy
Real fizzy bill up a zoot, we smoke whizzy
He knows, she knows, we're tough negroes
Forever ready and I'll be ready forever
You don't wanna try a ting, I'll put holes in your leather
So please never ever try try and be clever
I'll be wetting MC's like rainy weather
Too the two faced nigga screw faced laced in
Get chased 'n' get placed in a bin
Get a slicing, battering, working
Dizzy boy don't stop 'til it's hurting

[Hook]
