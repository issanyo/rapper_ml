Let's talk about over excited boys on the road
Said he knows Slimzee, Maxwell, God's Gift
Said he knows Plake, said he knows Ace
Couldn't get a real name for themselves
Living off reflected glory, living off face
Who break all street on every area code
Claims he's tight wiv mega man
Cool with Romeo, cousin of Kaish
Said he knows Neeko, Breder, Hype
Said he had lunch at Lethal's place
As he looks for the face
I look for a way to move him clearly outta my face
Backstage with the N.A.S.T.Y crew
Where I asked him to get out of my FACE
Then I get a live late night phone call
And I leave him there
Hopes for the face receiving air
Pissed 'cause its gone past business hours on the clock this
So they could look good and tell tales
It's all jiggy and we look like pals
20 missed calls is total, plus 8 voicemails, 'bout 14 messages
People can't take hints and messages, and the message is leave me alone
Number don't look local, this is why I don't answer the phone
U look like a real top boi when the gurls look
Big bold capitals, front page
People got a problem, act like I used to make dub-plates for them
And I can be the next big star in your phone book
