[Intro]
(At the tone please record your message) (x4)

[Verse 1]
I don't want to screw, but nothing ain't new
I make to kill your whole crew when I come through
And you know it's true, so what you going to do?
You ain't got the foggiest, ain't got a clue
Got a little fame, and yeah I got game
Get my way with your dame, just from my name
All I got to say: Get out the way!
Dizzee Rascal's hot like summer day
And I hit MCs like croquet
If a boy pet, then a boy must pay
You could start answers on the lay lay
Please feel free, you could bring it any day
Anyway, get wet like Perrier
Better hope there's an ambulance on the way
Okay, if you want to fight , just say
We uppercut MCs like Sugar Ray
Hot like Cairo, hot like Mars
But I want houses and I want cars
So I spit verses, and I spit bars
I don't care what they say, and I ain't playing
Hot like lava, hot like hell
I'll move to your sister, move to your girl
Charmane, Cheryline, or Chantelle
You better hide your wife, protect her well
Killer instinct, instinctive killer
Around daylight, can't get no realer
Young ones flapping their gums with no fear
Females, money, and guns; it's all here
Top shotters, big cats, street gats
Bent coppers aim for your knee caps
Some pay a visit to jail without bail
Some stay on top of the game without fail

[Hook]
(It's all up)
It's live O (It's live O)
It's live O (It's live O)
It's live O (Uh)
Look
Skank out (Skank out)
Skank out (Skank out)
Skank out (Skank out)
And jump about
Move it

[Verse 2]
See-Saw, Margerie Daw
Guess who sneaked in through the back door?
Form of a hacksaw through a trap door
Dizzee got a cheek, and not much more
What's that violence whats that war?
Put him in a headlock: see if he's raw
I cause armshouse on the dance floor
Set trend, set standard, set score
Spin that bottle, now cash that bottle
Talk tough but you ain't got no bottle
Get strangled, get holed, get throttled
Dizzee come old school like Aristotle
Blue bottles lying about with six holes
Ice dry hockey stick, break collar bones
We check girls from broken homes
Big batties, big breasts, light skin tones
Wow

[Hook]
(It's all up)
It's live O (It's live O)
It's live O (It's live O)
It's live O (Uh)
Look
Skank out (Skank out)
Skank out (Skank out)
Skank out (Skank out)
And jump about
Move it

[Verse 3]
Didn't want to listen, didn't wanna care
Left that boy in a gutter, somewhere
Want to talk Live O want to talk rare
I make you wish you were born elsewhere
I've gotta wash that girl out my hair
She's old news, everyones been in there
No we're not equal, no we're not fair
That girls innocent, she gets air
That MC's a doubt
Tell him I said it, and I said it real loud
Going on rowdy, going on row
That boy tried me, that boy failed
Sorry, pardon, what?
Could have got brought up, could have got shot
Gun man, get gunned down on the spot
Who's hot, who's a bad boy, who's not?
Wow

[Hook]
(It's all up)
It's live O (It's live O)
It's live O (It's live O)
It's live O (Uh)
Look
Skank out (Skank out)
Skank out (Skank out)
Skank out (Skank out)
And jump about
Move it

[Outro]
I'm moving now
Dizzee Rascal, you get me?
