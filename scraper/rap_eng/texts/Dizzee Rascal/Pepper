[Intro: Footsie]
I'm so focused, check my Z out
I'm so focused, check my Z out
I'm so focused, check my Z out
I'm so focused, check my Z out
You don't want me to get my leng out

[Hook: Footsie]
Clips in the barrel of the gun, reload it
Barrel of the gun, reload it again
Enough shots of my food, it's done, I've sold it
Food is done, reload it again
When I've smoked on my zoot, it's done, I smoke it
Got bare trees, I'm rolling again
Everybody knows I'm holding the peng
I'm so focused, check my Z out

[Verse 1: Footsie]
You don't want me to get my leng out
I'll end out all of your lives
Test me? You'll need all of your might
Cause I'll start badding up guys
Having up guys, grabbing up guys
Draw for the ting and start stabbing up guys
Ask you if you're a bad enough guy
Cause nah, you're not bad enough
That's it, I've had enough
Dun know say man are true raggamuff
I do ragga stuff, I'm not talking dances
[?] walk-in dances
We don't take no chances
We use bottles, we use glasses
We pop bottle, you man [?]
So don't give me no funny guy glances

When I say let's, you say have it
Let's (have it), let's (have it)
When I say let's, you say have it
Let's (have it), let's (have it)

[Verse 2: D Double E]
It's 11PM, my niggas pull up in a black BM
Blacked out so you can't see in
Bugged out from day, that the way within
Everybody tried [?]
Everyting [?] like Bruce Lee

Get ready to duck

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
I'm so ready for war, I don't care, I
Keep in touch, I clutch on my borer
If it's [?] later
Ain't no need to question, I'll bore ya
Can't let you have the lot or hand it over
I stick with this chip on my shoulder
Cause as I get older, world gets colder
One wrong step and it's over
So I can't ever get caught slipping
Too many man wanna see me missing
Go for the zoot in raves, I'm gripping
9mm, fuck 32 clipping
Practice makes perfect, it's worth it
I share it with whoever deserves it
Cause I found death, I don't wanna deserve it
But I'll hurt you if you ever deserve it
