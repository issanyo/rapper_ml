[Intro:]
You people are gonna respect me
If it kills you (it's loud, it's loud)
You people are gonna respect me
If it kills you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, you people are gonna respect me
If it kills you
(People are gonna respect me
People are gonna respect me
Bet I make you respect me)
You people are gonna respect me
If it kills you (bet I make you respect me)
Yo, look

[Verse 1:]
Do it how they didn't wanna do it, now they really wanna try to do that, but I'm telling them no
I'm in a predicament where imitators wanna take my style and have bit of my flow
This copy-catting of my lyrics and my chatting better stop before the gunshots blow
Do you really want it? 'Cos I really wanna give it, if you do just let me know
And I show, arrogance and elegance
But no, tolerance for nonsense
I bring, violence, I'm a nuisance
Kill a MC, leave no evidence -I've got brains and intelligence
But no conscience, no innocence
We roll in the darkened silence
We're presidents in any residence, and I swing for your chin with no hesitance
I'm a captain, you'd better bring your regiments
And you're a failure, don't have no relevance
I'm a champion, winner and victor
Prick you're so not ready, so silly, so heading for the golden gates
No, really you monkeys are playin' with apes
Now guerilla warfare is the purpose I carry this stick for
Plus I've had enough of these little cheap comments from fake MC's, bad minders, and sket ladies
Talking about how it used to be? Well it's a brand new day so leave me be
I don't need you, so you don't need me, your opinion don't interest me
Don't like me? That's fine by me
'Cause from Holly Street to Hollywood, it's all good
From New York to York Hall, it's all cool
You're a fool if you think I'm gonna cease
Now honestly could there really be peace?
It don't seem that way, too tough
Stop with the games, I play too rough
You must be smoking too much puff, divert or be deceased
U.K. rapper stabbed in Napa, cause of gossip, cause of chatter
"He's still breathing, he's still a dapper"
Retaliate with gun clapper
Truthfully, I can't see very well
Dont flatter yourself, you're any girl
Them boys should've sent me to hell, now prepare for the beast

[Hook:]
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me if it kills you
(bet I make you respect me)
You people are gonna respect me if it kills you

[Verse 2:]
(Ay, verse 2)
Endless speculation I'm facin'
Constant controversial relations to gun crime at Garage events, with so many claims and no evidence
Suggesting I'm the reason for the U.K. gun-clap season
I'm legal, may I stress, for the fool, for the sake of
Trident intelligence
Go ahead, check my files all day
Bit of criminal damage and TDA, might be a little bit of violent disorder but I ain't never been locked away
Got a few mates that have been convicted
Yeah, so what? It's the hand life dealt them
We weren't blessed with the system's TLC
Government should've tried to help them
(Look, I've) been a law breaker, ain't tryna hide it
As for the sentence, ain't tryna ride it
(I) stopped that so I could do this
I'm legit, you may as well kiss my A-S-S, P-L-E-A-S-E
I'm L-E-G-I-T, you ain't got nothing on me
But to the pricks who think I'm slackin', please dont ever be fooled, I'm packin'
This is a welcome and it's a warning, please don't ever just think I'm rapping
You know the score, I'm raw from day, still Dylan the villain from round the way
Feel free to quote anything I say, please don't ever just think I'm chattin'

[Hook:]
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me
I bet I make you respect me
You people are gonna respect me if it kills you
(bet I make you respect me)
You people are gonna respect me if it kills you

[Outro:]
I know what your thinkin', he's gone too far now, innit
Fuck it, if I don't speak who's gonna speak for me?
Stand up for myself in this shit
So fuck you, unapologetic
Can't be, never have been, won't be a prick
Yeah, that's it
