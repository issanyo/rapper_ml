[Hook: Dizzee Rascal & Billy Squier]
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat (Dizzee Rascal)
I get on down (rolling deep)

[Verse 1]
I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're tryna see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
Fuck the glitz and glamour, hit 'em with the Blitz and Hammer
Because they're talking 'bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face, they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing
Flushing MCs down the loo
If you don't believe me, bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate 'cause I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe
It's an Air Force One
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the tonne
Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's
Chump, best to act like Forrest Gump, best to run

[Hook]
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat
I get on down

[Verse 2]
I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this boy
You better send your best soldiers, this is Captain Roscoe
More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me, they'll probably come together
It's probable they'll stop me, probably never
Yo, topboy, topman, or top ah topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper
And a first aid kit and some antiseptic, this could get hectic
I'm a Don, accept it, you got a bright future
Don't let my gun affect it

[Hook]
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down
(Calm down)
(Fix up)
