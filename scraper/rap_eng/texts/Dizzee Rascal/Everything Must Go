[Hook]
Everythin’ must go
Everythin’ must go
Everythin’ must go
No squares in the circle
Everything must roll
What’s the plan when the smoke clears
An’ it all takes its toll?
I don’t know

[Verse 1]
Uh
Futurist
Ludicrous
Like the news except my views are true and I cut through the mist
Scrupulous
I’ll dismiss if you persist
Deep down I’m a youthanist
Still ruthless
Bitter sweet
Neutralist
Not new to this
I can see the world dwindlin’
Got my spider sense tinglin’
I’m just out here minglin’
All I see is politicians runnin’ round tryna keep their pockets jinglin’
Sounds like I’m singlin’
Can’t forget about the back scamps and the swindlin’
No point in lingerin’
Everybody’s gotta eat
Somebody’s gonna cheat
Out here on a tightrope tryna stand on their two feet
Kids are tryna be street
It’s peak
Get swept off of their feet before them condos are complete
Yeah it’s deep

[Refrain]
Everythin’ must go
No squares in the circle
Everything must roll
Rollin’ up that crow
It’s gettin’ out of control
What’s the plan when the smoke clears
An’ it all takes its toll?
I don’t know

[Hook]
Everythin’ must go
Everythin’ must go
Everythin’ must go
No squares in the circle
Everything must roll
What’s the plan when the smoke clears
An’ it all takes its toll?
I don’t know

[Verse 2]
Uh
Bottle poppers and socialites
Gassed up and over-hyped
No oversight
Really puttin’ on a show tonight
Not me
I’m overtight
Girl told me I’m miserable
She said why you gotta overanalyse
Why can’t you just let loose and have fun like them other guys?
Jumpin' round like orangutans on the table
With their sparklers
And their champagne all publicised
Why you always gotta sumarise
Why can’t you just live life in the moment?
And act like this glamour life ain't just a bunch o lies?
But I’m wide awake I can’t fake no more
Wide awake I can’t take no more
It was fun while it lasted
But it’s the kind of shit I can’t rate no more
Kind of shit you get carried away and start movin’ lose
And get posted up on your Instagram and fans hate you for
Cos the excess just vexes
The world’s more complex than being first name on the guest list
Or sexist, being reckless with a dancer in Texas
Named Lexus I’m restless
Textin’ all my exes like

[Hook]
Everythin’ must go
Everythin’ must go
Everythin’ must go
No squares in the circle
Everything must roll
What’s the plan when the smoke clears
An’ it all takes its toll?
I don’t know

[Outro: Boris Johnson]
The last thing we want to have in our city is a situation like a-such as Paris where erm the less well off are pushed to the suburb, that is not going to happen in London
I will emphatically resist any attempt er to-to-to recreate a London in which the rich and poor can't live together
