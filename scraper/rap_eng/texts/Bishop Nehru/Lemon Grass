[Intro: Juice Sample]
Hey man if Bishop calls or if he comes tell him I ain't here
Why, you don't like Bishop no more?
Why you asking so many questions man?
Cause I like Bishop!
Why?
Cause he's cool!
He's cool huh? Well you just tell Mr. Cool Man if he calls or comes by that I ain't here

[Verse 1]
See now a lot of people ain't impressed I know
Cause I'm 15 rapping and the kid ain't got no flow
You bozo's drowning in the words I'm spitting
So get the row boat, cause the stream don't worry bout ?
Cause they loco and my mojo is so pro
Yet I'm loco and still strive for more glow
But your ho know that I'm up next, she undressed
Showing her breasts, getting ready for sex
It's like that when you closer to the cash
The broads that used to laugh are ready to give you ass
It's nothing new, it's something you get accustomed to
When people start feeling your crew
Or feeling the moves that you making
So please don't be mistaken the game is what I'm taking
I'm patient cause other dudes really ancient
And really ain't shit, they basic
Minds vacant, my rhymes sacred and I aim straight for greatness

[Hook]
I'm all about my cash and my cream and the dream
Cause it's all a nigga need on the thing
You lose in the booth, I'm the truth
Yeah, I'm young, you my motherfucking seed
I fiend fitteds, stay green in kicks
Ain't worried bout none of these greasy chicks
Cause all they want is the cash when you get close
And all they see is the cash when you get close

[Verse 2]
I spit facts
You spit shit no one reacts to
Just had to let you know your rhymes wack dude
I'm passed you, matter fact I'm on a scaffold
It's mad true don't act like I ain't catch you
There's mad clues cause you claiming you had rare jewels
And tattoos, when I seen you, you ain't have two
You have to cut the bullshit now
Your profile is wild
My pro styles is wild
People know it, they just don't show it
They try to hold it most bitches
My hold is boasting
And leave their devotion and commotions
I'm still hoping that Hova hear me flowing
And know that I'm cold from the go
And that I'm chasing the gold
And the gold with the golden globes are so so
When a nigga scope, tryna get in the scope
And get scoped by interscope

[Hook]
