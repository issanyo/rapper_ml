[Intro Sample from The Emperor's New Groove]
It is with great sadness that we mourn the sudden departure of our beloved Prince Taken from us so tragically, his legacy will live in our hearts for all eternity

[Verse]
September 25th, 2017
I'm sitting anxious on a late night thinking about my dreams
It's 2:47 and yet my emotions bring me to steam
Feeling like [?]
Shouldn't even be [?] because it currently seems
Like I've been tighter than any popping funk artist's jeans
Feeling like I've been trapped behind a mask like a dream
Outside shows smiles, inside and it seems it's unseen
But I'll come clean, I hate life
I understand the beauty but truly nothing excites
So it's like fuck the [?] glamour and the life
[?] and since I'm [?] with this mic
You wanna lead me on like it was hype
I'm born strong but I'm tired of putting up fight
And I've been feeling like God wouldn't [?]
But [?] high like [?]

[Outro Hook]
I don't know how I'm feeling inside
But I know it ain't right for me to feel this done
A stone cold feeling inside
Man I know it ain't right for me to feel this numb
I don't know how I'm feeling inside
But I know it ain't right for me to feel this done
A stone cold feeling inside
Man I know it ain't right for me to feel this numb
