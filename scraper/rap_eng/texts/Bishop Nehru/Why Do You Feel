[Intro: Bishop Nehru & Female sample]
Why do you feel?
Uh, yeah
Why do you feel?
Bishy Bish
Emperor Nehru comin' through, 'bout to do what it do
Uh
Why do you feel?

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
I was thinkin' we could kick it
And you'd be my Nehruvian empress
I promised that only dreams we would witness
But you seein' something different
I know that this your mind, not your intuition
'Cause you in the system givin' them tuition
And yes, I respect your position
But I'm just sayin' that your brain ain't missin'
So while you playin' these games, let me listen
Me and you could be slayin' all competition
We both see the vision, so let's make it happen
Dreamin' without napping, euphoric satisfaction
We've grown with the passion, in flame for each other
So I wonder why we don't have a name for each other
Enough with the games, sweet lips, stop playin'
Let me know what you sayin', 'cause my flight ain't delayin'
There's no time for waitin'
Forget about them hatin' on the other side
Nehruvian Mami, Bishy's trying to vibe

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
Girl, I'm thinkin' that you're beautiful
And I can tell by your eyes that you feel me, too
So why do you feel the way that you do?
Why do you feel the way that you do?
I catch you in my dreams, just me and you
But you seem confused, I'm tryna break the move
So why do you feel the way that you do?
So why do you feel the way that you do?

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
They usually play games, so it ain't nothin' new to me
I'm used to being the teen who wins the queens musically
I tried through unity, emotion wasn't working
'Cause they weren't seeing, but I'm finally with a being
Who believes in what I do or don't for that matter
The fact that we can chat attracts and makes you badder
I hopin' that that will flatter, not push you down the ladder
Don't mean to make you sadder and that's on the average, so
No pressure, my blessed Fran Drescher
Don't even gotta dress ya, you divine sun dresser
And we avoidin' lecture, so there's no need to diss
We know that you can't miss me without it ending in a mystery
'Cause they know that we pounding out the misery
Is literally killing me, I'm hoping that you slip and see
That you and me were meant to be
That you and me were meant to be
We were meant to be

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
Girl, I'm thinkin' that you're beautiful
And I can tell by your eyes that you feel me, too
So why do you feel the way that you do?
Why do you feel the way that you do?
I catch you in my dreams, just me and you
But you seem confused, I'm tryna break the move
So why do you feel the way that you do?
So why do you feel the way that you do?

[Bridge: Bishop Nehru]
So why do you feel?
Tryna break the hold
Let's go

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
Girl, I'm thinkin' that you're beautiful
And I can tell by your eyes that you feel me, too
So why do you feel the way that you do?
Why do you feel the way that you do?
I catch you in my dreams, just me and you
But you seem confused, I'm tryna break the move
So why do you feel the way that you do?
So why do you feel the way that you do?

[Outro: Bishop Nehru]
Why do you feel the way?
Why do you feel the way?
