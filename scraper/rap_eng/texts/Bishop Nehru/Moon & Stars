[Verse 1: Raz Fresco]
Ayo spiral be the movement of the spirits
Pyronetic spittin special edition kicks illin in the village
With Dynasty Visions, Dreams of major league pitching
Me and Bishop sufferin from ill young nigga syndrome
Killin shit and we co-defendants
Sittin back chilling rooms be marijuana scented
Egyptian gold my nigga got Cleopatra women
When you start the race, I be at the finish line illin
Who am I? Mr. Never Money Over My Niggas
Gluteus grippin She got nubian beginnings
She truthfully gifted, I caress her that's player pimpin
Ima fucking villain so fuck the system fuck if they feel this
Raptors Jacket Cash in the Denim
Time is money and I got mad money invested
In this rap shit, dwarf a giant when I rap shit
So much beyond the surface if you can pass this

[Hook: Raz Fresco: x2]
Everything written in the Moon and the stars
And everything under the Sun has been done
But this shit right here?
There'll never be another
I said this shit right here?
There'll never be another

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
A nigga tryna get it a scene that ain't hard to find
I'm hoping that lines or dimes will leave me the lines of dimes
Whether bitches or riches, I'm tryna avoid the stitches
Wanna be taking pictures with fans saying my rhymes vicious
My mind gifted, lines wicked try and switch this
Nigga up in the rough, and disrupting the sudden force of corrupt niggas must
Think they getting something from me
Since I got to the money
Even Elders been acting funny
And honeys no longer dummies
Remember when I was bummy, no clothes
With more foes coming by the boatload
A chokehold, is what I got the game in
You straining, I'm entertaining
Fans killing all the remaining
Patience, impatiently, wait and see
I murder rappers and on a daily basis we
Breaking weed, baking these tracks your ass lack
You wanna react, cut the slack and bring it back
It's a wrap

[Hook]
