I put numbers on the board, of course
I'm coming with the force, while these niggas are forced
All these rappers are lost, and people follow them
So what do that mean?
It's just the whole group is lost, all ignorant teens
Still I'm thinking, where's the kings and the queens? Doctors and lawyers? Cause we ain't seeing builders, but seeing plenty destroyers
And music only annoy us, this viper is like made of poison
It shoot like, Brandon Roy with this boy, you shouldn't toy with this
Hot for a minute, then you gone like it's boilers
This boy'll hurt any, no pity when he getting berserk
Spoiler alert: The wickedest prick, or get them urked
Then sit with a smirk, cause they thinking little like a smurf
It's my turf, wish you the worst if you step in it
Get out of my section, I'm setting up for a bunch of wins
Remember I was tumbling, just trying to get up again
Then I started buzzing, went light-years in front of them
Fuck getting a Woody, the Grammy's I gotta get em in
The rap act, catch em this cat is been wrecking em
These lines help me paint, and y'all niggas still sketching em
I'm still ill, with niggas' chicks they not threatening
I never learned my lesson, and I guess I never will
Cause I tried to change tomorrow, but the past'll run a mill
Like the last deal, that I went and did with Mass Appeal
They can't believe in a nigga, so I know nobody feel
Cause they ain't believe in Martin, and they ain't believe in Malcolm
Took two different routes, still they found the same outcome
So fuck it if they doubt, son
Imma be outstanding
I'm already ready for the climb, like mountains
No he reeking, believe I got the loud and
Mountain OC for the tree and the rounding
Now I'm OD, and it's seeking around
And still I'm never weak and my vision ain't clouding
They sneak, so they clowning, but you'll witness the Emperor
My words'll give em chills, like a Christian in a minister
Killing like, sinister
Niggas quite, miniature
Ship em like, visitors
And them light, prisoners
I just do what I do, like signatures
We not similar, Imma pop like it's finisher
Got the kind of lines to strain a mind, trivia
Letting niggas slide, now it's time to get ridaya
Ridaya, ridaya
