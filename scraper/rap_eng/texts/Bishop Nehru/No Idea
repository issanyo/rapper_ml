Wooooooo!

[Verse 1]
Sittin' still with this segment, it's called life
I'm in it for the thrill like depression and cold knives
It's somethin' you cold feel, like the homeless and cold nights
Now checks look at me, like cleaning some old Nikes
They thinkin' its still bright, still I'm hella lonely
Attractin' only the phonies, cuz music [?]
I don't know if they like me or who the media showing
Either or, I'm sure that it won't stop me from my growing
I been glowin' like a star, now that daytime's passin'
They'll truly see the shine, and I see they reaction
Touching souls like traction, and if it's wack then we threw in some traction
Can't happen if the math ain't addin'
Me energy's of heaven, you resemblin' Saturn
I can see the rituals, they continue in patterns
But they got no idea what Bishy done mastered
They thought I had my back to the wall like I'm plastered

[Hook]
You ain't got no idea
If you thinkin' that this boy about to cower in fear, nah
You ain't got no idea
Cuz I done been through a lot in these 15 years
You ain't got no idea
Said I done been through a lot, still I ain't show tears
You ain't got no idea
Said you don't know how I see it, you don't know how I see it

[Verse 2]
What am I seein'? Uh... What aren't I?
Who's constantly in war inside? Me, myself, and my pride
They all stressin', but thoughts not restin'
Cuz I can't let it all fall apart like it's sections
There's aggresion, depression, hella second guessin'
I'm feelin' like I'm mind blown, thoughts are at a dead end
Pop says correction, Mom says a revered
She know I won't listen but still she throws the suggestion
I played mental Tekken so all of this is a blessin'
I was lost on the road and finally found a direction
Fuck with anybody, think I'm lovin' the progression
Still they say I'm immature like a bored freshman
They got no idea that I was really destined
They got no idea that I was really destined
I continued on my path and my mind as my weapon
I walked through hell, now I'm inventin' the heaven, cuz...

[Hook]
You ain't got no idea
If you thinkin' that this boy about to cower in fear, nah
You ain't got no idea
Cuz I done been through a lot in these 15 years
You ain't got no idea
Said I done been through a lot, still I ain't show tears
You ain't got no idea
Said you don't know how I see it, you don't know how I see it
