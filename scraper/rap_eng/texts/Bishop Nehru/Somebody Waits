When somebody waits for me

[HOOK]
Every time I try to be
There's somebody who waits for me
[Wanting energy to thieve]?
But they don't think I'll ever see
I don't want no enemies
But I won't be portrayed as weak
That's why I see differently
And sometimes I don't even speak

[Verse 1]
It's honestly astonishing the way I've got them piling in
Autopilot rhyming, still I find I strike Allah within
Just because I'm smiling doesn't mean inside I ain't dying
And hiding but sympathizing, I've tried minimizing
Cos that's when guys switch sides, and wanna empathize and
[I take pride in write ?]
In this life
Advance the place and hands it feels right
Left the tight hold the spite
Cos they want to see me leaning like pints in a Sprite
I'm seen like Pisa but the geezers taught me Giza is key
Then I dug deep, dig dug in mummies
Manifest the jewels straight from the tummy
To beat the beast leaving us bloody
Bluffing and tussling for money
Stunting us to be dummies
I know they know I know so that's why I think
They waiting for me
So I gots to worry

[HOOK]

[Verse 2]
Have you ever felt inside a giant eye that's watching
So confined in that hiding's your only option
Like a lighthouse that's spotting
And people that seeking
This light is reason's lead you to think of leaving
So many demons you keep on feeding
That even with the least control seems to be weak and
Draining like leeches every weekend 'til the weekend ends
Even weekends are leaving me uneven
The odd seven repeating
Life lessons were peeping
In the second and dissecting it
So second miss is dissection different
I strive for magnificent
By consistently spitting significant
But often ignorance leaves them disinterested
You the hottest out I'm about to leave you extinguished then
I've been instinctively thinking of extincting them
Hoping in a blink but it seems
Like it's longer than I think
