[Chorus]
I been out my mind, feeling feeble
Why am I the guy seen as evil?
Time is flying by like an eagle
I'm tryna survive and be peaceful

[Verse 1]
It seems problems are always approaching
Been living pessimistic and it's gotten me frozen
The slow-motion life that I've been provoking
Is not for the coaching
Just coasting and I know this
But I'm thinking it's bogus
Probably cause it's I see me speeding in a green lotus
And then I wake from the dream, sleeping on the sofa
I been queasy on this life coastal
But I feel I should approach with hoes before I throw up
Cause I ain't going to these parties, they fucking suck
At every one someone's trying to get me drunk
Yo, bruh, you sure you don't wanna try a cup
Nah
Honestly, I need Marleys to puff
And a pear-shaped queen with an ass I could cup
Cause the chick that I went on Sway to discuss
Told me she sees me as friends and that ain't much

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uh, I lost my mom needed dad or a tide
And I just can't find it
It's awfully silent
Plus I have a hard time deciding
What I want to do with life
I like to meditate, make beats and write
But these parasites are repairing my sight
Tryna siphon light and that's the shit I never like
So like Pike, I continue my hike
Out of sight, on the low, though my eyes tight closed
And the Tommy got a oddly cologne
Probably cause I'll be home on the roof getting blown
Cops still patrol just to make themselves known
But I go unnoticed like a ghost in the midst
And its ghost in the midst
So I stroll to the fifth dimension
And they mentioned dementia
But I dismissed insults they send to me
And continue killing with these soliloquies
Peace

[Chorus] (x2)
