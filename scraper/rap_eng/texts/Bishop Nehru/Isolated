[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Since a kid I been a loner, it’s whatever though
Shit, I guess I made it up the pedestal
Using new sounds, refusing to move pounds
Came a dude from the ground who’s shooting for the crown
No spoofing around and no more deception
Removed it like infections, learned a lesson
It’s still lame lesson, myself I’m investing
The next gen, spreading affection, affecting
He’ll lift them up, a couple more vibes came
And changed some lives, making ancients cry
I hope they hear and I hope they tear
They ain’t never want me, now I’m always near
They always in my ear, I see they ain’t sincere
Then disappear, must stand clear of those who interfere
So yeah, I’m all alone in my basement
Still trying to make my way from the pavement

[Hook]
Isolated, yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Isolated, yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
So I’m, isolated (x8)

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
They said I would never glisten
Then they sat and actually had to listen
Now I’m smashing and I grab attention
My Tumblr’s blowing up and everybody’s in my mentions
I turn the television on and now I’m in the listings
This is all getting interesting, I’m inching in
Attentions and visions went through thick and thin
Problematic system kid, they predicted when
Listening to the teachers they would never believe us
Caring more about their checks than our respect
It made me upset and just wanted to get away from it all
Erasing this small now I’m off like a rocket in my room
With the Boondocks, the other option , I guess
Is write a track, if it ain’t that then it’s probably take a nap
No filling out the gaps, uh, the last to relax
But a natural born class act

[Hook]
Isolated, yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Isolated, yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
So I’m, isolated (x8)

[Outro]
And I hate it…(laughing)
