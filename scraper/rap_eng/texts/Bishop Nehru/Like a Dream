[Intro]
Uh, in a way, huh, most versatile
Yo, aye, aye

[Hook]
I was working at a late night
I remember every day tryna get my take right
Now the kid living good tryna take tide
Working at the bar overtime till the daytime
Yeah I was working for the dream
Now that is what it seems
Now life is like a dream now whole way
Living like a king yo life is like a dream
Now life is like a dream now whole way

[Verse 1]
Swear that life is like a dream, I’m doing what I wanna, I’ve been living like a king
A nigga taking flight I know that ya’ll can see the wings
Guess I’m ready for the lights and all the drama that it brings
Know that I’m about to spring I want the top of the game
We not the same you pu fame but you stay in your lane
It really lame I’m the type to put the hate in the shame
I’m in my bag like Sage I’m delivering flame
They hear my name, they can’t wait to shovel dirt on the top
It probably goes what they be doing, I be doing the opposite
I’m the one that they be rocking with, got a mean establishment
I’m tryna be the greatest I ain’t settling for moderate
So I gotta kill em I ain’t talking the apocalypse
Now I got a ball like I play for power Pitts
Any goal I set in mind I gotta accomplish it
They calling me a cocky god nigga it’s just confidence

[Hook]
I was working at a late night
I remember every day tryna get my take right
Now the kid living good tryna take tide
Working at the bar overtime till the daytime
Yeah I was working for the dream
Now that is what it seems
Now life is like a dream now whole way
Living like a king now life is like a dream
Now life is like a dream now whole way

[Verse 2]
Balling like a Campbell, balling like Devonte
And I got the cramps and I do it my way
And they don’t understand I be riding my way
I’m sticking to the plan eating like an entree
Feeling like a montre know that I’m the outcast
Ripping like I’m Doc Dre knowing I’m gon outlast
If you ain’t talking bout cash tell me what you talking
Incredible, I’m like Ash you been busy walking
I’m the one that they stalking guess she can barely toss it
I’m loving this life i promise I cannot get lost in it
Everything they coming from I just like [?] this
So I know that they’ll feel it till I rest in a coffin
It ain’t no exhaustion a youngin busy bossing
Dreams were born in the [?] in the [?]
It ain’t no exhaustion a youngin busy bossing
Dreams were born in the [?] in the [?] yeah

[Hook]
I was working at a late night
I remember every day tryna get my take right
Now the kid living good tryna take tide
Working at the bar overtime till the daytime
Yeah I was working for the dream
Now that is what it seems
Now life is like a dream now whole way
Living like a king now life is like a dream
Now life is like a dream now whole way

[Outro]
In a way
Great job, great job
