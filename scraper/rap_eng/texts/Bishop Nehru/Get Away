[Intro]
I said I'm just trying to get
I'm just trying to get away
I'm just trying to get up
I'm just trying to get away
I'm just trying to get up
I'm just trying to get away
I'm just try-

[Verse]
I said I just want to get away
Want to see a better day
I'm just trying to levitate
So I got to meditate
Focused all the time I don't really mind if you hate
Sun just got to shine, gotta feel it like you radiate
I been feeling like it's fate
So you know I been working it
It's going to show
It’s gonna show up certain
‘til it’s over and it’s curtains
I remember I was certain
Now they seeing like an urchin
Now I'm meeting and I'm slerping
While I'm leaving all the burdens
I can't lose I got to win (win)
I'm make it happen in the end
Making it through thick and the thin
I ain't really thinking about a friend
Why they come and go like the wind
Why they showin' when I'm near a win
I don't have any time for any games
You the one who like to play pretend

[Pre Chorus]
I'm fine in my skin
Won't stop my shin-
I ain't thinking about them
Work out there doubts
Cuz they told my chance slim
Now I'm heading out like I'm 'bout to run errands

[Chorus]
I been thinking bigger
Trying to see a better day
Thinking like a winner
Yeah I got a lot of faith
I just wanna get up
I just wanna get away
I'm be in bitter
Others trying to get away
I just wanna get up
I just wanna get away
I just wanna get up
I just wanna get away
I just wanna get up
I just wanna get away

[Verse 2]
Lately it's been crazy days
Don't too much amaze
It's amazin'
Or I'm in a daze
Trying to sell more than Billy Mays
I've been in my ways
In my destination only fate
So I'm racing straight
Gotta make it happen
I been leading like the captain
When I told them I was rapping
All the niggas started laughing
Now they comedies in action
[And they like a whore, I ask it?]
For a chance or a glance
At the things I be attracting
Gotta go, gotta go now
Can't let 'em hold me down
So I gotta blow my nose
Altough, they trying to drown
I'm going to make my rounds
I'm going to make my rounds
I'm make mom real proud
Can't flop following a crowd

[Pre Chorus]
Now I thought I leave now
I been feeling [?] stempeding ground
So I'm doing me as you can see
Gotta sell out MSG and then the [?]

[Chorus]
I been thinking bigger
Trying to see a better day
Thinking like a winner
Ya I got a lot of faith
I just wanna get up
I just wanna get away
Saw them being bitter
Others trying to get away
I just wanna get up
I just wanna get away
I just wanna get up
I just wanna get away
I just wanna get up
I just wanna get away
