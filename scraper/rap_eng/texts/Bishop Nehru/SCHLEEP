[Verse 1]
All outta ginger-ales, keepin' the scale
Bitches still usin' libra scale, shriveled snail, sluggish
Switchin' chairs, pluggish, you must be buggin'
Struttin', fast walker, young grasshopper, trash talker
Sun in my goggles with the pen strokes
Time chamber 'til it ten folds
Got a temple for the tempo with my temple
Let the shrine shine, lettin' my eyes crescendo
Comprende, flow got me greener than Dende
Soul piccolo blow like [?] sensei
Got your bitches hands up, that's tempe
And she get around like the Henday
North to south, east to west
Flossin' out, reap the set, speed the check, [?] the tec, feast the best, sleep the rest, triple Z's in parentheses
But vent the breeze, when I vent the breeze
Circumvent the seas, and save the bees, but not the bitches
Those come in twos like Chiclets, and you're chick-less
Mans boxin' for the biscuits, so
You best not risk it, I brisk it
Infinite the Cool, like the wrapper on the bottle
The wrapper on the lotto, the wrapper on the model
The fapper on the model, the dapper on the dawdle
Squabble, your flows they wobble
Mans will friendly fire for bare bones, stare clones
Rare drones in a world of bare loans, fair owns
And pharaohs, you best hold your own
Mans will friendly fire for bare bones, stare clones
Rare drones in a world of bare loans, fair owns
And pharaohs, you best hold your own
