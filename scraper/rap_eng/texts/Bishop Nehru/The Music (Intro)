[Intro: MF DOOM]
To me, from the musical aspect, hip-hop is going in the direction where it’s like almost damn near 100 percent on everything besides the music. Like what you look like, the sound of your name to, what you’re wearing, whatever intoxicants you choose to put in your body, to, you know, everything expect for what the music sounds like. The mask is really a testament to yo, it’s not about none of that. It’s straight about the wreck. You could be any color, or whatever, the mask represents just everybody. Yo, Nothing matters, the brand of clothing, none of that matters. It just matters how you spit and the beats, if the beats is raw, then that’s what it’s about

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
I say the world ain't safe for me to live in
Im only sixteen so this shit just the beginning
I should be in the world trying to find a fine tuition
Instead of running around Following intuition
While others mention
Nehru name cause the kid grew fame
Planting the seed and grew a tree so when he blew through lanes
Lames would look saying he took and threw it off the top floor
Now whores want more of my balls and bronsons
While thongs are flying at a nigga from a distance
This hipster kid is thinking about how to diss this
Master a sentence is my commission
Gets larger and the starters are ready to throw big fits
It's misfit, we get shit around Christmas
His wishlist is much more than what saint nick dished
But get this
He always showed his mom a smile
Cause she was up for awhile wrapping presents for her child
Meanwhile in his head hes thinking about the bread
And trying to get ahead
While others searching for heads
Never selling them meds
Im making tracks instead
Most shooting the leads
Not knowing they could of lead
They're community
To unity
They'd rather cut like truancy
He using me to get yourself know
But this ain't new to me
In my eulogy they'll be songs about how they used to be
Before I killed them Musically
My talents leaving gruesome scenes

[Outro]
In my eulogy they'll be songs about how they used to be
Before I killed them Musically
Leaving gruesome seams
