[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Life switching, it's getting different
But I'm just inching to success
Like yo, what's next? I'm trying to hit the chest
So far from home, I can't get your text
Did it on my own, I ain't notice threats
They nature naughty just like Treach
I'ma make it far, and it ain't a stretch
Had teachers tell me I would be less
But I never stressed, or stopped to rest
Had a lot to clean up, like a mess
Now years later, I feel greater
My show greater, kill they checks
Amble life, they gon' be vexed
They can stay hexed while I lay text like safe sex
Bishy Bish been apex, my wave next
So they can exit, I'ma wreck it 'til I perfect it
Opened up, I dissected parts of my life
Through mic sessions, now my hobby is my profession
That's the reason I'm never second
Every second's a different lesson
Ain't no way that I'm digressing 'til I'm a legend
Uh, 'til I'm a legend

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
Getting old, growing wise
Let it know, fo' inside
Rip it flow, so we shine
Skipping over all the blind
On the go, and we'll rewind
Wanna show 'em why I'm the golden mind
I know they hoping I'll slip and slide
But I been focused while on this ride
So like the sun, sun gonna rise
Like slip-ons, got no ties to these little guys
I'm with they mind 'cause I got a lot that's on the line
I watch them all sleep, but it's fine
I ain't weak when I seen decline
I'm a geek, they'll be back like spawn
They'll be on the grind 'til I flatline
Really feel like it's my time
Will he kill? Are there green limes?
Duh, god, that's the obvious
Anytime I rhyme though, I body it
Got a lot to get, forget who it meant
I'ma run the game like Emmitt Smith
This kid emit light like a pic
With the flash on so I'm off of this
Yeah, 'til I'm off of this
Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Louis M^ttrs]
When it's all gone, and there's nothing left to cry for
Where does that leave you? Where does that leave you?
When it's all gone, and there's nothing left to cry for
Where does that leave you? Where does that leave you?
