[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Forget math, I ain't riding with arithmetic
Rather ride with sentences
Writing Rhymes, facing dimes
Trying to get with the kid
Remind them who the illest is
I been killing shit
15 but my 16's be the realest
And I know you gon' feel this shit
Because my flow be so pro
When you niggas go
Hear them Oh-No's
Yo slow down, and kill these niggas soft
With a force, that'll push anybody else off course
Of course, you gon' have a couple niggas hatin', or debatin'
Niggas that shakin gon' say I worship Satan
Have to place em , way back with all their nonsense
Y'all spent, most of your time tryna get my cents
I spent, no reason to keep askin
You has beens, most of you niggas never have been
Never have been

[Outro]
