[Intro Sample from The Emperor's New Groove]
Yzma: A toast to the emperor!
Long live Bishop Nehru!

[Verse]
(ay ay ay hey)
(hey ay hey hey)
Haha!
Oh, man
Yo
Feel like these actors asinine
Chasing the cat, look, cause her ass a nine
That's a backwards mind
Bishy back like to remind or recline
I'm killing it by design everytime
Like high ends and [?]
Givin' all like island
Performed at more islands
Than Onyx's broken styluses
Style is the wildest
They hound cause I'm childish
Though my hindsight is foresight to all the elders
I be grooving more than Stella
Moving, morphing interstellar
I'm coming up from me going around, no propellar
This profile is (pro fella's) profound and only getting better
But I take a look around
And the evil is the head
Ahead of the ones delivering
Trying to get it together, huh (she's great)
Feeling guilty
I'm not acquitted
They tried to kill me
But I was behind the scenes grinding like I'm Quentin Miller
Fans thirsty so I'm giving them the bigger picture
Fuck who's getting richer
I'm inspired by the scriptures
My lyrics give hope and life
Like they elixirs
It's what you got to face like punch with no niggas
Not even trying to stunt
Or become a public figure
I'm just doing what I want
Like a rebel loving Hitler
Or a trouble loving Hipster
[?] call me quicker
[?]
I can see the relief
But settling ain't the winner
Me, I need it for grief
Or I would scream "timber" (timber)
With emotions falling, while balling
No hope in talking or calling on anyone who would listen
Cause then they stalling or missing
I understand the missions I'm getting
Are clearly driven by your energy
You clearly see when you and love [?]
And not the repetition
And I be seeking to hit it
Acting like they love the vision
But really love the attention
So fuck slipping
Y'all niggas getting revealed
Most can barely keep a mind
So, how could they teach a skill?
And nowadays they be fees on the real
I done seen the ill
Niggas would probably swallow a beats pill
