Bishop  Verse:
Fading and im blooming
Going through my phases that the moon would
Facing and reducing all the true good
That you could receive being a sun
If you a 1, you wouldn't wonder you just prep when you heard the thunder

Thats word to mother, nature, he's the true earth
Care taker, never mistake him for a wage chaser
I plan to shake up, the world and make em wake up
They can't erase us we'll be dust before dusk so

Fuck an article you won't harvest my particle
I coulda been in harvard on the honour roll
Woulda copped the chop and let the lama go
But then my mind would float from nostradamus to osama's bro

So just to show that i have signs of both, are exposed
And heaven and hell are under my control
While yall stroll and under my control its
Universally common, our guys are demising
Often taught despised and try rising higher then high rises and

You'll be alright then, my fine friend

Raz Fresco Verse:
Life changes, life stages, sorrounded by
Devils and danger, against my nature i release the anger
Through the paper, to make the hall that make the hall of famer
Play the game or you get played a player peep the sega

Genesis of this no beginning or end to this
Metamorph the intelligence, see me one with the elements
Out of waters of melanin to this body i settled in
Everlasting life through the seed i plant the essence in

What you listen to the messenger or messages
Me i peep the wisdom in and in between the sentences cuz
Phony men, pull ya energy like scorpion to suffer here
But they know who been the G on they compass square

I got the vision 360 ecliptic
Build with my son cuz i see the sun in him
But mental poison in they denims
Go with the times or your times ending
As above so below seen hell to find heaven, yes its

Same shit up there is down here man, you know?
