[Verse 1]
There was a man he was often alone
Lost in his own thoughts caught in frivolous zone
Feelin' there's no home to go where he'll fit, and he'll glow
So he stayed to himself as he said it in his stone
His heart, you couldn't clone
Goin' toe to toe with a steel boot
Showin' all the courage he could show
But there's only so much we control as we livin'
So the hand he was dealt led to erratic descions
But none of that mattered if it meant better livin'
So he went from trappin' to catchin' lil niggas slippin'
He was his own team, he was Jordan and Pippen
He never took an L, all he ever knew was winnin'
He knew that he was trippin' but couldn't get caught slippin'
But it all went wrong when he really seen it different
He started to chill, but he was too defendant
He started to learn life right when his ended

[Hook]
Guess that's the game of life
In the blink of an eye, you could say good night
No time to prepare to fight
Everything ain't fair in the game of life
No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
This game ain't fair, I seen plenty prepare and lose
It's the truth
