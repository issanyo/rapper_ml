[Intro Sample from The Emperor's New Groove]
Kuzco: The name is Nehru
Emperor Nehru
I was the world's nicest guy and they ruined my life for no reason
Oh is that hard to believe
Look, I tell you what you go back a ways
And this will all make sense

So right about now
You're probably wondering
Hey where's that emperor guy

[Verse]
Yup
Ain't no way man
Uh
2096
Look, check
I'm here so bare witness
The emperor is in this
It's sparking a different interest
I'm handling my business
Its crazy I'm building boards
With these pens like its Pinterest
Using my six senses
So I can show 'em what sense is
Wait
They think being menace being a menace
And no ones in the upper
There's a very big difference
I see it clear as intentions
When you staring near a vision
They here for tension I'm here for tents
Like I'm Ben Tennyson
I've been tense and sensing them hate
But I'll be great
Can't knock me off my road to success
I'll keep straight
They see a plate
And they thinking like can I get to the steak
They snakes and they sleep
But Imma get 'em awake
Look
Most high forgive me
For I shoulda shown pity
Irregardless through all the margins you still be rolling with me
That's 250 these dudes in trouble like its new hickies
Me, I'm something you can't explain
Should call me doo-hickey
My moods sickly
And you dudes really just too silly
Me I be rocking whatever like I was two milly
Need two millies
Labels saying that they do feel me
And now they wanna feel me
I'm giving it up filthy
That's that NY talk
And they crossing these streets like sidewalks
I leave you outlined in a fine chalk
If your mind is divine
Then you'll see this kind when they try and stalk
So I'm the alienated alien sailing in the dark
An annealment of thoughts
Praying for prey to get lost
I'm like the predators
Better yet Bishy has been a boss
Cheddars getting tossed
Like pig skins and Randy Moss
But I never floss
Like my hygiene was at a loss
My senses heightened
And like my growth spurt it hit the course
Now women getting exciting
Like Iverson when he cross
Just applaud
Cause I leave 'em in awe with every bar
They never saw
I made an ocean from a resevoir
Ourvoir

Thank you, thank you
Thank you
I appreciate it
Boom baby
Emperor Nehru
