[Intro]

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck bout these hating ass niggas
They be hating cause they stuck, I'm just tryna get bigger
But I'm all about the bucks, yeah I'm tryna get richer
They be showing fake love, they didn't think I would remember
I don't give a fuck bout these hating ass niggas
They be hating cause they stuck, I'm just tryna get bigger
But I'm all about the bucks, yeah I'm tryna get richer
They be showing fake love, they didn't think I would remember

[Verse 1]
Showing fake love, they didn't think I would remember
Niggas stay in their dubs but I knew I was a winner
Ran away from the scrubs cause the kid is thinking bigger
Got a J full of bud and my brodie got the liquor
When enter in it it be lit, I be on some other shit
I can see how niggas hating, tell them suckers get a [?]
I been thinking about the digits yeah I'm tryna make it flip
[?] still I never even slipped
I remember niggas tripping now I see 'em [?]
They be hating, I can sense it but they play like [?]
I'm like [?] hit her with that [?]
Shawty said that she can take it but she running for her life
I got S's on my mind but them S's got a line
Ain't no stressing, I'ma shine
[?]
I got S's on my mind but them S's got a line
Ain't no stressing, I'ma shine
[?]

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck bout these hating ass niggas
They be hating cause they stuck, I'm just tryna get bigger
But I'm all about the bucks, yeah I'm tryna get richer
They be showing fake love, they didn't think I would remember
I don't give a fuck bout these hating ass niggas
They be hating cause they stuck, I'm just tryna get bigger
But I'm all about the bucks, yeah I'm tryna get richer
They be showing fake love, they didn't think I would remember

[Verse 2]
I'm a king, don't step in the ring
I'ma do my thing
Heard the bing
Then I had [?] put 'em in a sling
Know that I can go and get it in a bling
[?] niggas acting funny so I never link
They want me to sink but this boat is gonna float though
No they not in sync but they moving like a [?]
[?] keep it low bro
Youngin did it dolo
Hit the scene, oh no
He shook him like a snowglobe

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck bout these hating ass niggas
They be hating cause they stuck, I'm just tryna get bigger
But I'm all about the bucks, yeah I'm tryna get richer
They be showing fake love, they didn't think I would remember
I don't give a fuck bout these hating ass niggas
They be hating cause they stuck, I'm just tryna get bigger
But I'm all about the bucks, yeah I'm tryna get richer
They be showing fake love, they didn't think I would remember
