[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
To me you mean the most baby
You already know (yeah, you already know)
To me you mean the most baby
You know like I know (know like I know)
You already know
That to me you mean the most, baby
You already know
That to me you mean the most, baby

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Listen close so you know how it's supposed to be
It's no joke to me, I care soulfully
For you and I know you feel the same too
Cause you always smirking when you say it ain't true
You're an angel in my eyes, though that's no surprise
There's loads of guys that got the same thing in mind
Just know that I'm different from the dudes that you've seen
See I'm young and a teen but I still think of bein'
With a being in your caliber, you hold your own down
My queen with gold crown, you're leaving the whole town
Astounded, getting hounded, but still you're staying grounded
Aight, who am I kidding, you get cocky every now and then

[Bridge: Bishop Nehru]
I'm just playing, I'm just being a tease
But for real girl I will satisfy your needs
You're who I'm trying to please, indeed
Just follow me
I think I should show you how much you really mean to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
Seeing you smile starts to warm my heart
I think about you constantly, I hate when we apart
I love to sit and admire like a work of art
You're beautiful, smart, and your style is off the chart
Just know you spark a flame inside, I blame them eyes
You're fine, even wine whines when you come by
I try to show compassion, I know that's all you're lackin'
You're who I'm baggin' till my back end's in the grass and
Six deep, know that I sleep and see you there
"I need you" is rare but maybe that's what you need to hear
Cause I see you near in my future, and if that's clear
You could be my cougar, I'm hoping you don't lead to Krueger
