[Intro]
Yeah, and away
Going down

[Verse 1]
I say I'm on an astral adventure and I'm living in dreams
This reality is backwards, it really ain't what it seems
I done grab it by any means
Like a savage who [?]
[?] weaker than the stream or ravine
Got the sack clean, now I'm up higher than Zach LaVine
Overseeing all their actions [?] like the king
The difference is we hit and connect like a fling
I been itching and searching for an answer like it was Bing
Though the bling doesn't satisfy my hunger inside
I still cop cause on the outside I love to be fly
A revolutionary losing my mind, still I'm reclined
I'm thinking this by design but still I never sit and whine
I'm a lion so they wanna see me flop ahead
They be trying can't be topped like I'm a plane
And a doubt they wanna see me rot, I'm like dang
Going out like Spike in Bebop with a bang

[Hook]
Sunsets til the sunrise
Gotta move like a ride
Just know I'm coastin', coastin'
Just know I'm coastin'
Rain wets but the sun dries
I won't go inside
Just know I'm coastin', coastin'
Just know I'm coastin'

[Verse 2]
Look, been noticed since [?]
I'm coasting life and riding highways to the heavens
Like a young Mike, I'm tryna be a young mic legend
Like I'm approaching them with knives, yeah I know I got 'em threatened
I'm trying to live life cool move [?] better setting
This industry's high school, the real world better set in
Could never play the fool, it won't go like a dead end
I got it locked and now the minions mad like dread and
That's the hair on the head and the emotional connection
I'm living my dreams, guess my main focus is inception
Pardon the digression but my mind's really racing
Get your bets in and place it on Bishop for the best win
The kid about 6'2" with a slick grip
He the newest sleeper but their eyes'll never close again
And now I got 'em hypnotized like [?]
[?] the hating within

[Hook]
Sunsets til the sunrise
Gotta move like a ride
Just know I'm coastin', coastin'
Just know I'm coastin'
Rain wets but the sun dries
I won't go inside
Just know I'm coastin', coastin'
Just know I'm coastin'
