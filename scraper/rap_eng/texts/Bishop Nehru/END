Me and my niggas on the block, you know the spot
Cops can watch, cause I'm not spring them mad shot
Cause it's a mission, you need to listen
In the end you just different, you see the difference
Different colors, you are brothers, we ain't equal like others
Single mother, no popa, for daily troubles
But what I do stay true to the teachings I was taught
Thank momma for the gifts that she once bought
I never went to court, cause I never got caught
On the porch light it up, roll it up, you know that of course
Cause it's a cause, so don't get pushed off it
I wanted to rap, so I said, fuck a office!
My team full of spartans, we are in this evil world
Assumptions stay blind behind closed doors
Until it hit the floor and it comes to the light
All I see is fame, in my spotlight, uh!

[Hook x4]
Keep it steady, I'm ready for what you wanna do
I always stay true to it never left my crew

[Verse 2]
I flow cross the ancient seas plus my a through z's
So basically you're misplaced if you're placed near me
Just wait and see, I scrape em with no latency
They're late to see, that Bishop's in the greatest lead
Remained fatigued, I laugh at you
No room for bad apples, I spit gas capsules
These toxic lines cause mad havoc
It's mad natural, for them cashes we gas past you
The bad rascals got the game intact to them shackles
The buddha 'crackles i inhale and reach failure
I cough the smoke up and goes the tales that I tell you
'know I'm doping, nobody feel ya
Don't get realer than the shit I kick, my lungs will heal ya!
Feel that, nigga! Try to kill that, nigga!
Believe I'm the cure for the real, my nigga!
If you don't, you get eaten like, veal my nigga!
Sneak diss, you can turn into a meal, my nigga!

[Hook x8]
