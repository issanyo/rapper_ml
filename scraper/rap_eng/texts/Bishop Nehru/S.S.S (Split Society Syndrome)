[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas on the corner, prepping niggas for coroners
Verses dispersing, hurting and cursing
All of these foreigners, trying to war with us
I keep restoring the, peace
Trying to put the east back on
The map with rap and in fact
We never even slacked, theres plenty of hidden tracks
Where niggas spitting the facts instead of living the trap
They black, nobody hear
Like infections in they ears
It's like they throwing a party but ain’t hardly any peers
In all of these years, my godliest fears have conquered
I went bonkers trying to find a way to block haunters
Heartless monsters running in packs like mobsters
They tommy clips parting lips. Believe or Doctors?
Need no roster, anyone can make it to the list
This society’ll kill you and act like you don’t exist
It's nothing, this sick crew don't walk around with fists
But if you diss sooner or later you gonna get hit like this

[Hook]
They tell us to respect all the laws , they tell us all to listen to
The boss at what cost, the worlds still hectic. Nobodies protected
Our own people fighting each other to see who’s “bestest” This worlds
Ignorant, nobody thinks. They too busy blowing L’s and pouring a drink
No time to grind but still time to grind. When your friends say
Lets dip you leave in no time Quit lying

[Verse 2]
Trying to do right in this world but right isn’t enough
We all fight in this world we living but got it rough
So I gotta take a puff a Haze, to better my daze
We live in a maze , and getting cheddars one of the ways
That I could keep an eye out for people hating
I doubt that it’ll change the way that they live
They still want two in my ribs cause im doing it big
And all this envy causing frenzies
Cause I ain’t acting too friendly
Know that knowledge is plenty
You’d never die for a penny?
Nor would you dive for a penny
Don’t say that dollars will win the world
The most you get is a girl who loves you cause of the pearls
That you put around her neck
The life You live is a wreck
Its time to check yourself, or infect yourself
And keep your wealth stealth and protect your health
Because this society’ll change entirely and it's strange
Because others gain as soon as your brains
Strained as soon as pain is obtained
