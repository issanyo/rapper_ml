One-two one-two, check it

[Verse 1]
I'm spitting heavily over heavenly melodies
This hell I see is jealousy from people who just relish me
They better be, changing they mind by the time I'm 17
I guarantee my line's fine like they met with my weed
Ah, I'm taking L's like the Bobcats
Ya'll cats can't compare to me, niggas all wack
More crack in my lyrics than in vents for store's backs
Plus I paint my own pictures like a Rorschach
Momma's lies about pops was for my own protection
Imperfection, was my only given direction
While you hoes was in class and hosting erections
I was using my mind as a lethal weapon
People taking pictures
Vivid images got me reminiscing
About the times I wasn't killing shit
But now I'm real and shit
And if you mad, you gonna be really pissed
When I'm at hotels and I'm shouting out "How real is this?"

[Hook]
It's the Golden Era, keep rhymes tight
Keep your dream on your mind, keep your dreams on your mind (Repeat x4)

[Verse 2]
I'm coming back with a vengeance
As darkness ascends, with my pen I repent it
Try and stop me, I roll you over and laugh
Cause disasters, now you acting like you William Shatner
My project is more cheques, not more sex
I adore texts, not messages but I'm on next
And if a nigga mad, I rip him with no remorse
Show my force, I'm a young Skywalker when I show reports
These fake niggas acting funny like I did it
No attention come when you're close to the money
Stop acting, you ain't catching on buddy
We wouldn't be close friends if you was new to the country

If you was new to the country, we wouldn't be friends if you was new to the country (Repeat x2)
