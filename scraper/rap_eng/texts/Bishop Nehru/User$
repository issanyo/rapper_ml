[Intro]
Emperor Bish'

[Verse 1]
Melancholy days got me held in a spotty faze
Delving in my body trying to be common anomalies
Praised honestly dazed and toppled and in amaze
But gotta be amazing, it need commas in my banking
Been slaving since 7th grade trying to get a page over wages I paid
And be majorly played with my name paved on the great LA shape
Hoping the name sticks like tape
Straight apex from an ape aerate chasing and then escape
To a great fantasia hotter than a blazer on a day in Jamaica
I spit sick flava equating to the equator so savor how I shape ya

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel that y'all wanna use me
Wish to abuse me and mentally confuse me
It's usually the truth seen
So it seems routine
Nothing new that I'm seeing
Users human beings
I swear that I can't get used to the users
Swear that I can't get used to the users
I swear that I can't get used to the users
Used to the users
Used to the users

[Verse 2]
I've been thinking too much so its hard for me to see
The direct path of light and what I'm suppose to be
There's mad people watching, in the family I'm the option
Want the Grammys and the Oscars, and I'm swearing I can conquer
But lately I've been locked up and since I'm seeing green like Blanka
Everybody wants to chill and wants to pop up, but I just want to make music and influence
I hate expectations they ruin every single thing that I think of doing
Could you please just leave me to be human
Fuck what you expect or think is correct
Don't interject, just gimme a second while rejections exit

[Chorus]
