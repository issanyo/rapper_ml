[Intro]
Yeah
Check, check
Uh, show guns on the run, take over and shit
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
My flow's amazing, dig holes in gravings
Hold shit, hold their savings, get lost I'm paving
A line of success, through my mind and chest
My rhymes impressed, now niggas tryna hide they vest
But it's fine, I don't mind, niggas rhymes are swine
They lines behind, everyday is rise and grind
No constant shine, my essence is the wildest pond
Your sound define weakness, they crowding mine
I'm bound to shine so fall back, you niggas ain't all that
Get sketchy and get messy, niggas dusting the wrong cat
I'm flowing past, any other MC alive, niggas hope to survive
I cut throats with these lines, no lie bruh, you niggas is tired
Tryna find your way, decide, yeah
Your rap lines expired
I blow by ya, rap actors tryna catch us
Bishop the master, my rhymes be hotter than magma

[Hook]
I kill ya whole team with a 16(x7)
When I'm spitting my shit, I cause big scenes

[Verse 2]
I was the type of nigga who write about lighting triggers
But then, I realized those lines were real lies
I killed time, still trying to get a little buzz
Cause I knew who I was, but in school nobody fucked with a nigga
I was lame, still lame and for fame
But in my brain I was thinking of dames
And all of the ways, that imma change the game leaving flames to my name
I'm praying, that next year I'm the one critics acclaim
While claims from fake MC's that's chasing me I sit in glee
'Cause nobody passing these 16's
Until we get seen on scenes or your TV screen
We gon be, keen and supreme while repeating routines
And chasing dreams, cause the best, what I'm planning to be
I'm damaging beats, selling seats, and leaving my feet
Above the planet, dropping lines as hard as granite
And damage the fans demanded now niggas can't even manage
I planned this, muhfucker

[Hook]
