[Intro Sample from The Emperor's New Groove]
Kuzco: Ha! Boom baby!
Bride Guy: Your highness, it is time for you to choose your bride
Kuzco: All righty, trot out the ladies

Hey Markel, just want to know how you're doing
Yeah!
Since it's been some time since we've been talking, so can you
Uh

[Chorus]
I ain't with all of the [?] or the tension
[?] or the tension, no
I'm just trying to be the one to get your attention
Get your attention
You be on my mind like I've been lost and I'm tripping
Lost and I'm tripping, oh
I just got to listen to my intuition
My intuition
Just got to listen to my intuition
To my intuition, aye
I just got to listen to my intuition
My intuition, aye

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah
Girl, I've been on the road
Got to hit a couple shows
Yeah, you know how it goes
New day, new goals
You're a [?]
Still truth be told, you really feel like gold
You be thinking it's profound
[?] slow down
You've been trying to go now
You're the type for a dope gown
Uh, I don't want to hurt you
You know I wouldn't desert you
Even taste like dessert too, aye
We both never listen
This how it's envisioned
Which time it was different, aye
Cause I'm on a mission
My grind isn't switching
I need you to get it, aye

[Chorus]
I ain't with all of the [?] or the tension
[?] or the tension, no
I'm just trying to be the one to get your attention
Get your attention
You be on my mind like I've been lost and I'm tripping
Lost and I'm tripping, oh
I just got to listen to my intuition
My intuition
Just got to listen to my intuition
To my intuition, aye
I just got to listen to my inuition
To my intuition, aye

[Outro]
Versatility in the finest form
To my intuition
To my intuition
To my intuition
