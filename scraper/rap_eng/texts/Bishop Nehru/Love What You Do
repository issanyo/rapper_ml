[Intro]
Uh
Bishop
Markel
Straight in on this one
Fuck it
Uh

[Verse 1]
I've been grinding for the love and getting nothing
Now I see it's coming and it started from the dungeon
24/7 laying lines on percussions
I never stayed inside cause the trouble erupting
I slaved writing rhymes cause the money was coming
Then they switch to the shine and the dimes that I'm pumping
I still hold my mind
You find interruption
My submission were wise
While y'all guys were clutched in
I'm clutching a whole different situation
It came from my patience and love for the greatness
Now I created
Some say I'm their favorite
Other sayin' they hate Bish'
[?(I'm on at a B; They all mad at me)]
At the end of the day, shit
Their shit, ain't shit
More like ancient
Feel like Neo in a world full of agents
Years of feeling and appearing like day ends
But it's all for the love that send
And I'm still real young
So I'm know that I'm aware
Bishy been had juice like it's gin
They love it cause I'm me and I give it my own spin
You blow like the wind
And the women who pretend
Not they kind that depend
Had to learn it hard
When pops went to the pen
The pen was my friend
That and a couple others
But they weren't really friends
I viewed all of them like brothers
I watch them all change, one after the other
And that's before fame
That's word to my mother
Now I'm on the cover
Cause they heard him like thunder
True boy wonder
Who overthrew bummers cause of
Love

[Hook] x2
Love what you do, and do what you love

[Verse 2]
It's the
Super lyrical soul clincher
Flows from the centre
Stone cold inventor
My heart gon' get me the charge
Just remember
Was colder than December
Now they're getting dismembered
Oh not I begin to ride to get bigger
Then pause for a bit
So I could get sicker
I remember when writing in class lead to bickers
Was hungry then it changed in the end like Snickers
Learn how to go with the motion like pictures
They pick ya to fail where most of the eyes miss ya
But I switched the odds quicker
Tri [?(lifter)]
Ever know a [?(elixir;mixer)]
[?(Others getting)] ever ever because they want it quicker
People thought I'll be ignored
But I beg to differ
If they stars
I must be the big dipper
Something harder to follow
When I find a picture striking like a pigeon
This is to get richer
Moving like a ninja in the game
Trying get up
I'm so lit
They loose breath
Like it's a hiccup
Why you sit stuck [?]
[?(I'm bout to get...while I'm styling)] wish you good luck

[Hook] x4
Love what you do, and do what you love
