[Verse]
Rappers are brewed alive, it's true, cuz I maneuver wise
They ain't buzz, they just bums wearing suits and ties
Truthfully lose the ties, we ain't equivalent
I'm sickenin' with sentences, peep how I'm kickin' it
Like Messi, overstep me, it can get messy
Got cats that be strapped the desi
Niggas won't forget me and the chicks call me sexy
The same reason niggas tryna snipe like Wesley
I'm in a ghillie suit and slidin' like Presley
They talk to my back, but they never come press me
Tryna compress the beauty that the beast hold
And have me expressin' vise versa waitin' 3 four
I see the evils like an emo, yo
And I know that's how I'm perceived by the people so
I just keep it low, blind eyes thinkin' that they know
Speakin' on my insides and they ain't even seen the dough

[Hook]
Speakin' like you know me
We ain't ever even talk
We ain't ever even talk
We ain't ever even talk
Sayin' yopie you my homie
I say buddy you can walk
I say buddy you can walk
I say buddy you can walk
Thinking that you knowin' but you really knowin' nothin'
Thinkin' that you knowin', but really you just bluffin'
Thinking that you knowin' but you really knowin' nothin'
Really knowin' nothin', really knowin' nothin', really you just bluffin'
