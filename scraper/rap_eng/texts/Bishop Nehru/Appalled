[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
They can hold these testicles, if they test these goals
Just know they ain't messing with our senses flow
As you know if niggers ain't learned they lesson
We ain't stressing if it's less than dough
Me and my bro we'll be killing this shit
As good as it gets we flip cards
Skipping these guest we deliver them shits
Niggers need hits it's fine you just give'em this shit
Trying to get you loose niggers losing in a grouse world
But they still lose if they still losing
They control never coming know that
That's why we start this straight lap
Why we hunt [?]we loved it
We killed them in public, we interrupt public
Hold up like they long heads
More crushing so make the assumption Bishop
Killing all these rappers and never feeling[?]

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
Gimme your 16 I leave'em all feeling
Got my feet 5 foot deep into the ceiling
Niggers vex trying to flex they ain't leaving
I spit for look you barely breathing
Gimme your 16 I leave'em all feeling
Got my feet 5 for deep into the ceiling
Niggers vex trying to flex they ain't leaving
I spit for look you barely breathing

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
Take a listen [?]
That shit that is so twisted
That precision can't miss it
Rib stitches and constantly stack riches
Now get the stiff paraplegic twisters
Get more dough that's your rehab
Niggers nap they looking crappy
All they nag about is trapping
Steady snapping popping nixing over
And napping with the past
Rapping any rapper in that soul
And I'm spitting there is no competition
I leave the others missing and
Continue with my mission
And as you people listen you see that I'm dismissing
Any nigga that listen is flip in their position cause
[?]and don't worry about prices
Cause the{?]in the game require me to have a license
Rappers is [?]riding with violence
Buying riffs then trying to roll

[Hook]
