[Intro]
No one has said what the truth should be

[Verse 1]
I'm a everlasting candle in the hell
I can't fail, sat in my cell, I gotta' excel
The waves making tsunami's when I be rhyming these jails
[?] building the bars, like I had liquor for sale
Minor inside of me, see, I ain't sitting in a cell
I'm killing it, and I'm solemnly swearing it on myself
Trying to be overbooked like they falling off the shelf
I looked into the mirror and it told me that all I need is self
No one else, I steam it well
The ain't kitchen hot, I could sit and melt
Without a welt
I'm used to the burn, it's the same that my heart felt
Like heartfelt passion, of a ball-hog's actions, you ain't passing
This ambassador, I move in distraction
This is a no-fly zone, go inform all your captains
No more relaxin', an inch more, it's war and attacking, ah!

[Outro]
So get ready for war
Get ready for war
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
So get ready for war
Get ready for war
Get ready for war
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for war
