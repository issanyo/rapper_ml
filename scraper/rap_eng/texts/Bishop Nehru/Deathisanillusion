[Intro]
Uh, ain't no way, most versatile
Uh, yeah, [?] feel it, feel it like I feel it
You know what I mean? uh

[Chorus: Hideyourenvy]
I don't glow
Cause Imma live forever baby
Time will show
For sure it ain't a [?]
And I will glow
Like I was shining crazy
No, it ain't no joke
No, Imma live forever baby

[Interlude]
All I know
Is Imma live forever baby
Ain't no joke
They laugh it up like I was crazy

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
But I'm too wavy and working hard daily
I do it until my physical form is in a grave, b
Still I live forever and they'll say that he slayed beats
And finally I'll move to a place made of great peace
Really I've been feeling death can't phase me
My energy forever lay down like it's lazy
Now I'm separating from the clowns no Laney
Cause we don't see the same like the visions getting hazy
Been seeing the illusion feeling I'm being waste deep
Someone stay weep I try to wake them up from they sleep
I can see that they all afraid that like they playing creeps
Don't think of going down think out and then leap
They sleep

[Chorus: Hideyourenvy]
I don't glow
Cause Imma live forever baby
Time will show
For sure it ain't a [?]
And I will glow
Like I was shining crazy
No, it ain't no joke
No, Imma live forever baby

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
Yeah, look
I see infinity as well as Nirvana
I been searching for it [?]
I'm thinking I gotta prosper
Not a thing can hold me back like i'm a boxer
Had to channel my beast and use at like Ahura Mazda
Death sparks fear something we can't conquer
That linger in your head until it make you go bonkers
Learn to avoid all the noise like conquerers
And seeing it got me on my right foot like Converse
Cause thoughts wander like untrained kids
Though i'm often in my mind I don't lose my lid
I'm thinking I won't be put down like a bid
Cause I'm knowing we're here to leave our mark no skid, huh
So just live no fear will ruin
It's okay to feel beat cause we're only human
Just know it'll go if you keep it moving
Don't fall for the trap
Go beat the illusion

[Chorus: Hideyourenvy]
I don't glow
Cause Imma live forever baby
Time will show
For sure it ain't a [?]
And I will glow
Like I was shining crazy
No, it ain't no joke
No, Imma live forever baby

[Outro: Bishop Nehru]
Death is the greatest mystery of life
But we must explore it's possibility to gather a greater understanding of our own
The most prominent shackle of our humanity is the illusion of death
A trick many fear, and a trick many deny
Ain't no way
