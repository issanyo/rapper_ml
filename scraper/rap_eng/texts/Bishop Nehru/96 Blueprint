Yourself this evening, night, morning!

Let a couple doobies roll
Do you, but most of all, enjoy the week?
Shout out to, to, to

Shout out to, shout out to, to, to
Show south to'

I appreciate your talent, all that, you know what I mean?
Suburban show guns coming at you
That's' entertainment

Doubting me so I could do this shit
