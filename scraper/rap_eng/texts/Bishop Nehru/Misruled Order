[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Me and my niggas on the block tryna find a wave
Cops sittin' with the Glocks tryna give us graves
I ain't afraid cause my intelligence is relevant
To my heaven-sent flows and everything embedded in it
I'm better than the next man spittin you wishin' you wasn't competition
You tryna' get with us but, there ain't no room for you lame ass niggas
Tryna rain on a nigga's parade, no time for charades
I'm tryna reach success, for now I'll take sus checks, the streets I ain't gon stress
Cause coppers want us next, the only thing to do is hope to get the best but aim and go for less
I used to circuit cities till I found the best buy, a lot of staples in my back, people weren't friends of mine
I was up late, wiping tears from my eyes, hoping that the next night I wouldn't have tears to cry
Tears from my joy wasn't likely, I'm like the Spike Lee that's under 19
I'm fighting for my rights, and all the nice things that white teens get
To do, when they get like me and buy weed but drive high in they
White tee, and if I speed my tee redder than rubies, to me it's
Routine, cops be doing cruel things, to keep us snoozing and losing
Never have I left my mind behind, I keep it close cause you never know what time will find
Someone could slide dimes in your pocket, tryna' frame you
The world ain't safe, especially when people hate you and wanna take you
Out of this crazy place we live, lying and making fibs instigating shit
Have you takin' risks that you never would've took
Now instead of leaving the house your dumb ass shook

[Hook]
I gotta stay away from the streets, cuz the cops tryna put a kid to sleep
They showing brute force, no remorse, theres a corpse in the middle of the street
My life’s at risk, I must admit a nigga scared but I gotta make a move
A nigga scared but I gotta make a move
It's nothing else to do so I gotta make a move and soon

[Verse 2: Que Hampton]
As soon as I wake up the thoughts are coming to my head
Like "Is this life really worth living or would I rather be dead?"
"Why people so misleading?" "They never do what they said"
Well I'm thinking fuck being good it should turn for the worst instead
I'm thinking get the bread I'd rather have it now than later
And since I want it fast I'll be selling a pound of haze or
Kush, don't wanna push, but sticking my head in books isn't helping me make a livin' and broke isn't a decision
My parents aren't well off, not being able to have it when i need really got me ready to bust a shell off
But fuck it, only thing I'm shooting for is my success
Whoever reeled me in is winning big, I'm such a catch
So I'm chillin' with my D and pains, hoes say fuck the stress
I'm all about making more, getting even nonetheless
Still I'm lost in this world and I ain't found a compass yet
Either way I'm doing this shit till I'm in a casket fully dressed

[Verse 3: Bishop Nehru]
I got these obstacles they coming at me
I'm trying to pass em, overlap em but my conscience is weak
My confidence speaks for any of the things that nobody can see
Like all the dollars I greet and all the bottles I sneak
In my pocket tryna' get profit is the only option, fuck the nonsense
Coppers who watch us get demolished with our common sense
My comments sent uncommon cents hiding with a common scent
The dollars spent on ganja was low but know we be holding spliffs
To the dome where they go keep my mind and soul gold
Me alone with no dro is so slow
My mind’ll race, bout time and place, but my future and past are different cuz rhymes and taste
But in the present, my presence is still a present
Cause peasants, I represent without they given consent
The cons sent are con sent messages, messages I can't better through letters
Needing cheddar is something big when you eating cheddar for dinner
