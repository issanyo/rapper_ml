Uh, yo yo yo

[Hook]
Used to have to hold it
Now I get it and I spend it
Copping vintage Tommy and Lacoste I gotta get it
Momma came and saying, "Boy you can't spend it every minute"
Told her "Don't you worry in a hurry, Imma get it"
Imma get it
Imma get it
Imma get it
Imma get it

[Verse 1]
Never used to have it
So you know I gotta get it
And I need to get it so I have it every minute
Told her I could spend it any place at any point
Everybody they can hate but Imma roll me a joint
I don't care who you are
And I don't care what you say
I do everything I do
And I do it my way
I pay no attention
But I pay my own way
Then I mention that suspension
Got these other dudes hating
I just keep rising
I just keep on elevating
Like an elevator
Tell a hater
See you later
I know I'm something greater
Imma rise to my success
I've got a lot that's on my chest
My life used to be a mess
But I'm a have fun
Trying my best to do so
Doing new things, so unusual
They're like "Dang Bish you're blue cold
You came with the new flow"

Imma get it
Imma get it
Imma get it
Imma get it

[Verse 2]
Copping vintage Tommy and Lacoste like a boss
You would think I owe me a boat or a loft
Crazy nowadays you love a chick, then you soft
Swear they got it backwards, man these dudes got it crossed
Swear it's they loss, it's whatever why they lost
Imma floss like a boss
I'm just steady on my course
Doing heavy for my cost
'Til I'm the family Santa Clause
Ain't no time to take a pause
Especially 'cos they all applause
