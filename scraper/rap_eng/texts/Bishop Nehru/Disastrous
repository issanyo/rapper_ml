[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Welcome back, here's more of the rawness
Flows gorgeous, and no this ain't no '94 shit
Still classic, no you won't surpass this
I keep the masses stacked while I spitting these tracks
It's pretty easy, not difficult believe me
I'd much rather be seeing a DP for these TV
Scenes I've got, or acting in a flick
Maybe macking with your chick, she skinny and she thick
Huh, pear shaped light eyes
If she come, she come I'm only chasing one prize
And that's the luxurious ends, still looking for friends
So this journey is going through spins
But I'll be fine though, the mind is like a vinyl
A little spinning and spinning and then, well, it's time to go
Reminding yourself it ain't worth the stress
Live life with an open chest and never hold regrets
Everything happen for a reason
Just try think positive, your mind is an achievement
You've been deceived and I'm here to stop it
The world's newest prodigy finally stepping off this
(Where its at)

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Yeah, they call him brillo pad beard
Now on with the show, his flow is mad weird
Reporting live from the here (Where?) after
The collapse of Romeâ€™s rafters, amongst tears, laughter
In the Agua of Minimata, more lethal
To all who bites style types right before refill
Disaster, can blow like challenger
On y'all space cadets with threats that's more violent-er
Than atrocities seen via TV
As we keep it heated like Fukushima Daiichi
Turn up the temperature, villain and the emperor
Y'all ain't ready like a Doomsday Prepper-er
We stay repping till it spread like the Black Death
And shred mics till no whack left, crack breath
Kept it like a shepherd yet leapt like a leopard for spare shines
Stray slugs graze your hairline
Mines is as hard to find as Malaysian airline crash wreck
Soon come black goo nanotech
It's miraculous, nothing short of disastrous
That's it, nothing come after this
