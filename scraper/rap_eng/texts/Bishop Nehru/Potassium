[Verse 1]
The man who turns masses into addicts like opium
The fishbone braid-bearer taking all hope from him
Trying to rise higher than deep friars and sodium
I'm tired like weak thighs standing at this podium
I'm winning on the road, took dice and I loaded 'em
Now the self-loathing loner is overthrowin' 'em
About to run 'em over like I poured soda to the brim
Got a high motor, I know I'm the cremè de la cremè
[?] now women want [?]
When I be writing these rhymes. they be feeling it all within
Like it's pain in an organ
I'm growing like pain in an orphan
Like the rangers got power when I'm morphing
I leave 'em all morning, from night to the morning
I be up like an awning while they're throwing shade, I be yawning
So keep talking, you're never gonna stop me
Like I got [?] Bishop too damn cocky
Of course they try to block me but it be like they're 5'3"
They physically incapable to tame a kid in my league
They tryna sleep, I'm making noise
It's the beast of the east and the voice of the voiceless
Learn to keep poise around all of the poison
And now I'm making an imprint like embroidering
They wanna build and really be destroying
I can't feel 'em so I been avoiding
My plan's sealed in, they ain't ever spoiling
I been cooking up hot like the pot boiling

[Verse 2]
My mind heavy, your mind is confetti light
You very tight, and Bishy's spotting like it's cellulite
Cellulite on these CDs, EPs, and the mic
Tell 'em hype like a senator, quarterback from the spike
I'm hella nice and it comes from me thinking like lonely nights
My only fight is with the mind and the silence is overhyped
Only like what my heart do, it's your temple
Then my art too, that's why I move as sharp as a harpoon
Like a dark moon, [?]
Been [?]
It's my shot, I'm feeling Reggie Miller
It's knock down for three, that's the game sealer
Got the touch, you out of luck
I'm seeing through your new concealer
Feel I'm the iller but uneasy as I leave the villa
Usually my confidence is obvious and I'm the killer
A whole iller package [?]
They say that he average, I'm laughing, I'm not jacking it
Doing magic, you moving savage, can't interact with Bish
[?]
These cats wack and live and miss
