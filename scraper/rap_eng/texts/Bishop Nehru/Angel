[Intro]
PROGRESSION ONLY
Mr. Franky on the beat know I never see defeat
So just bow down to my feet while I'm watching nigga eat

[Verse 1]
Dreams of living lavish life
But still trapped in the savage life
I grab the pad and mic, with all thoughts of grabbing massive light
My thoughts and past they fight, with each other
Since the brother, never stutter when I speak
You be lucky to hear me mutter
This butter flow is to go and show the rookies
Just how to do this shit bars harder than stale cookie
I got my mind for niggas and they down for getting pushy
Cause the cat don't got my tongue like I'm afraid of eating pussy
So don't overlook me, niggas I know I got potential to blow
And when I do I guarantee my bottom bitch is your ho
And niggas claiming they Christ and got the deadliest flows
But really, they like Judas and they written's is froze
I mean y'all looking to pose, and I'm looking for foes
Who got, riches and hoes, so I, can scatter they bones
I hear moans cause the gift that I behold
Feeling bold, cause my goals got me making gold
And breakin these roads after shows

[Outro]
See, I told y'all niggas nothing special know what I mean?
Just the track, show a little progression
Nothing serious, I'm sure niggas are still gonna hit me up on Twitter
On some bullshit, saying I fell off and shit
It's whatever, Emperor Nehru bout to be the hardest shit
