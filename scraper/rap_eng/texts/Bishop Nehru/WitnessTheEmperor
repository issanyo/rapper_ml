[Intro: Kanye West]
This ain't a fuckin game for me
My beats was wack at one point, dawg
I wasn't always having hot beats, I learned how to make hot beats
I'm focusing on rapping now and imma be the fucking best
And I'll be charting with these niggas, imma be chart-
Imma come out number one, hopefully if it's not the first album it'll be the second album, if it's not the second album it'll be the third album. I'm not just trying to say imma come out and sell 10 million

[Verse 1]
Uh
I see they faces and see the way they be looking at me
Most 'em wanna ask me "Yo bishop are you livin' happy?"
Is that smile plastered on or do you have it naturally
Actually I'm just knowing this the matrix in reality
So ain't no way that I'm getting misplaced by the salary
Tryna get ahead and leave 'em burnt like calories
Casually killing casualties, battles end in catastrophes
I'm catchin' fees and they tryna catch up to me
But don't you see imma continue sippin' tea
Gathering an assembly of fans who will remember me
When I'm history and vividly a figure in it
I'm in general a general and you just the lieutenant
You adjusted to get it
Got it, I stuck to my physics
I could tell if your brain controlled, gimmie some minutes
But really it ain't my business, been busy in gettin' bishes
Mid-wise I be chillin' high up on Olympus

[Hook]
I remember they ain't think that I could win this (Nah)
Now they all 'bout to witness (Yeah)
I been workin' all night like it's fitness, and they still no finish (Nah)
But the craft way higher than the business (Way higher)
And it still never switches (Nah)
I remember they ain't think that I could win this (Never this)
Now they all 'bout to witness

[Verse 2]
Fact of the matter, this places here's gettin' sadder
Sleepin' on the data and in love with the chatter
Split his daggers between the actors and naggers
This place is badder, then badder than it has to be
A happy me is what I'd rather see
So I'm gradually evolving into the beast I seen in elementary
While I rock hard it's sedimentary, I said that this was meant for me
And ain't a soul believe, till they seen me over sicily
Then she been consistently, rippin' these
Believe it or not, like Ripley's
Been on my hymnin' magician before I was a teen
So it's hard to find minds who truly get what I mean
Like the average
I focused on the passage and it helped, with my baggage
Now the kid's the illest package, other cats get packin'
We ain't in the same bracket
This is light like practice, he cacked his jack rabbit

[Hook]
I remember they ain't think that I could win this (Nah)
Now they all 'bout to witness (Yeah)
I been workin' all night like it's fitness(I been workin'), and they still no finish
But the craft way higher than the business (Way higher)
And it still never switches (Nah)
I remember they ain't think that I could win this (Nah, Never)
Now they all 'bout to witness
The emperor

[Outro]
The emperor
The emperor
The emperor
