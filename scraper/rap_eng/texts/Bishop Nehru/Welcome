[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
My styles vary in lines [?]
The competition probably missin' dissin' they got 'em scared of me
It's weird to see, all of these random people are feeling me
As soon as my tracks dropped I knew this shit was here for me
And I stand to be, the best to ever hold the pen
While throwin' emotion on pages and hoping
Now all of my dope hymns will be niggas boastin'
While I'm coastin' the ocean
And postin' the most gems (ha)
I never thought that it would happen this fast
I went from sittin in class, finishin' work last
To gettin' dolla' after dolla'
All the shorties tryna holla'
And tryna get with the Gualla but none of em gettin' nada
Flows as hot as a sauna and lyrics ain't 'bout designer
Tryna explore the finers so writin' lyrics I gotta
And not a soul can stop these cold flows I got in these bogos
I got what have me sittin' on the top just watch

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
We some killers when it comes to spittin' flows
And nigga we the illest we just hope you niggas know
They ask about the beat and why the tempo so slow
Then they ask about the bars and why I wreck it so cold
We tell 'em
Check the melodies
We tell 'em
Check the melodies
Say what?
Check the melodies
Say what?
Check the melodies
We tell 'em
Check the melodies
We tell 'em
Check the melodies
Say what?
Check the melodies
Say what?
Check the melodies

[Verse 2: Que Hampton]
Part of the rock like minerals, Primetime general
Groupie niggas wanna come up like a pair of genitals
What I failed to understand is how niggas didn't come from the same womb but still could be identical
Y'all niggas on the same shit, my niggas on insane shit
Making bread stack like blacks back on the slave ships
Over-working on some slaves on the chains shit
And make no mistake I'm the shit yo' flow anus
I'd be lying if I said life was painless
Lucky that I ain't livin' anxious with a stainless
Either way you couldn't picture this no way to frame it
Even though I give an image so vivid Van Gogh can't paint it
My team's so amazin'
Word flow smooth punches track because we chafed it
Left it naked, push it in the cold
But until that fucker froze the equivalent to my flows

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bishop Nehru]
I live disaster now laughter is what I'm after
If I don't capture my scene is switching even faster than actors
No time for people and chatter, opinions don't even matter
I'd rather gather laughter from Slashes and all of these rappers
These trappers is tryna trap us
We keepin' our backs tough
The skin is never appealin' cause the people I never trust
They feelings ain't too appealin'
Appearin' after I'm killin' the game
Nuisance will hang, your services been arranged
The shit I spit deranged, your crick is wicked insane
You boring, Niggas is snorin'
You poured it all on the page
But explorin' haze, and J's that gon' gain you praise
They say it's better with age but clearly that ain't the case
I'm, younger than others and still I'm never found under
These gunners thats runnin' these numbers and shakin' Hummers in summers
I continue chillin' and killin' shit like a villain
Mothers' fuckers doomed if they feeling like millions
And start to feel a villains feelings

[Hook]
