Make this shit sound a little raw

Not a day passes that the glass doesn't spill
Because my happiness and sadness interact before the thrill
I'm a magnet to distractions and haphazard fill
Then a hazardous feel, feeling panic but still
The manic man's mechanic's been ended and killed
Like they slipped him a pill of Ritalin [?]
But the real ordeal
That will seal the notion was [concerned to?]
Now concerting with the [?]
Cos I'm who they heard of, an alien to earth
Like I'm the Silver Surfer, plus [Yerpa?]
In a burner, made them all a little bit sterner
But I never rush the slow learner
Just plant the seeds so they see and grow further
The glass [?]
Still I'm blue, looking Grover
Cos some years went over
And my dearest still ain't steering over
So I'm hoping for a clover
To help me win it over

[Chorus]x2
Life moves fast when you're rapped or a task
And it's cries and it's laughs in this harmony glass
It spills and refills and they all seem to clash
This future is past in this harmony glass

A quarter to my cup runneth over
Still I'm sober
So I take it back to half with some jazz bossanova
The floor is my composure before the spills cross
And expose the loner who's [bold didn't those throw them into a comas?]
All about that dough, no Homer
And I'm no condoner, just don't erupt your doper
Blowing [?], so the aroma's in the [?] stuck show with
No fucks, I just stroll with the funk
Plus a bit of punk, and crunk, soul and bumping trunk
But the junk got them drunk
So my glass adds up
Had enough of the bad luck
But corresponding to a [?] didn't have a chuck
Cos I go for goals like hockey pucks
And they plotting to stop but could not conduct
I've got a glass that's filled
But I will clean it up
In the next refill, I'm gonna fill to the [top?]

[Chorus]x5
