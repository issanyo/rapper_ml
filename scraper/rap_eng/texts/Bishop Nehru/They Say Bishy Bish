[Hook]
They say Bishy Bishy, please come quickly
The game is in danger, we hear you the savior
Bishy Bishy, please come quickly
The game is in danger, we needed a favor
They say Bishy Bishy, please come quickly
The game is in danger, we need you to save us
Bishy Bishy, please come quickly
The game is in danger, we needed a favor

[Verse 1]
I spit the, realest of rhymes, at the illest of times
Mines will combine with the body and soul, we're bodying flows
MC's are froze in stances cause these stanzas, causing cancer
Can't stand us? Better man up
Demand us, what sooner happen from this rapping
Never trapping, still I'm captain, no (?)
But money stacking, it's slacking, dudes mad when
This kid grabs pen, and pad, and start smashing
Them fools acting, I know they ain't surpassing
This teens actions, straight spazzing, every track then
Attracting, new Nehruvians, cruising cool with him
I'm thinking movies, then I plan to be a young Julius
Caesar, these bars, gone have me at the top soon
I gots to, make history, they'll remember me
Whether miserably or vividly it don't mean shit to me
Just know that I presented the world how it was meant to be

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They saying the kid is too advanced, but others love him they give him grants
Ask his teachers they probably lead you to stupid rants
He's in the class laughing like, fuck passing
Don't need it for rapping, though he may switch passions
I keep it active, gotta keep my mind moving
Cause most students leave school and then go stupid
But not I, cause I left, and kept learning
While most, would adjourn it, they too busy twerking (But you love it though)
True true I do, I was the fronting typa guy but why lie it's some cooch
And no I'd never trust a ho, I tell 'em what they can use
Don't get it confused, I never cared for feelings, it's new
A whole different view, arrived so his past is behind
At last he'll shine, and diamonds rise from eyes
Finally got some some eyes watching
How he plots to the top
It's the, newest top pick, others will drop quick

[Hook]
