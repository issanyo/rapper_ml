[Intro]
Imma just go straight in, fuck it
Yeaah..Uh

[Verse 1]
The ill nigga illin' in the Hilfiger
Transforming into a real figure
Yeah they figured that I'm optimist
But my prime ain't even close
I got em' shook like oculus it's obvious who's host
Want the end like apocalypse but they a lone vote
On the road gettin' doe for bozos and slow
Chattin' foes trying to make me black like crows
I see rows of zeros, no cracking a code
Imma about to explode, backs packed with the load
Wear backpacks so they think the cats wanna fold
But the cats just wonderful
Once I unzip, concedes to bull
Because if im seeing red
All that imma do is squeeze and pull
I'm titanium, these fools full of wool
Bishy play the sheep herder and murderer of all the wolves
They true burgers?
And they creepin' like burglars
They trying to hurt us but scenes can turn into murders

[Hook]
I see that they trynna test me
I see clowns they trynna stress me
I see biddies trynna sex me
I see why I'm kinda sexy
I see fakes squeal once they envy
I see snakes in see them simply
I see why some act so empty
I see I can't leave no entries

[Verse 2]
Settling for the lowest of lows
But im higher than highest
Like graphs trying to rise
And get a piece of the pie
Will im setting the bar
Know the ending is nigh
For these sap rap guys trynna slide for the ride
They gon' slide and slip, trynna survive with the fit
When they nine is legit
The style is so sick
When I spit, even Hammer would quit
Im from the land where scammers will get ya quick
Never focused on hitting the chicks
Cause I was hitting the licks
Till I could afford a mic, to have my voice recorded right
Now its like when I write and the bitches on my stick and let me hit them more than Ike
Now Latinas got the nigga hype, now
I see em up like high heights
I'm the captain when I'm tappin she go "AIGH! AIGH!"
Papi Chulito, make it look easy like free throws
They see sequels, I see C Notes

[Hook]
I see that they trynna test me
I see clowns they trynna stress me
I see biddies trynna sex me
I see why I'm kinda sexy
I see fakes squeal once they envy
I see snakes in see them simply
I see why some act so empty
I see I can't leave no entries
