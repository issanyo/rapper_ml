'Just friends' is the zone that I'm pinned in again
I'm trying to pretend and just coast with the wind
But you know that you're pending and who I envision
Approaching you different, hoping you don't miss it
I was the misfit, you were the cheerleader
Chick in my vision, oh so distant
And close at the same damn time
In the back of the class you were on my mind

(All the time)

[Chorus]
Really there's no need for playing
We could stop the games, and we could start the dating
We could drop the lames, and we could start the paving
We could spark the hazing, and we could live amazing
But you say that we're just friends x3

It's simply a sin
Your backside looks like sin so you know that I'm in
And accents past tense
So that I'm always with a grin trying to cash in
But you just won't let it happen
Sick of napping alone, cold with no action
Coming home from shows across the globe, sad it
It's wack when you're home alone, stoned and jack it
But that was the past and I'm trying to pass it
To decide so you should be my bride
Just cool with me and vibe
Us two and blue and skies
Even nights are fine [be not be nine?] and be mine
[defined?]

[Chorus]

Your name in my phone's a green heart and smirk
And in yours I'm 'Bestie' and it kinda hurts
I go berserk trying to surface what you see is worthless
Then go in these verses and you see it as flirting
Then it's closed curtains
But the show never started, and I know that for certain
I'm just giving you my heart and expecting reimbursing
Then you say, "It seems you've been rehearsing"
I reply, "I'm revived, but the hurt just surfaced"
[We care and urgent?]
So please be my nurse Miss Perfect
We both [?] it, who wrote you
And you know I won't hurt or desert you
That's how I know you're worth every little bit of energy I've driven in the earth
Some had hid it in the dirt
But I know you'll find it
Just dig a little deeper
And open your mind a bit
It's Bish

[Chorus]
