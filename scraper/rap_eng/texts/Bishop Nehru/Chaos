[Intro]

[Chorus]
Where I go, I don't know where I'm going
Cause I've been [?]
Rain, rain go away
Let me see another day
All my demons wanna play
But I just wanna be okay

[Verse]
I'm caught up in my thoughts again
Drifting off and I'm lost again
A walking sin, I'm haunted
Wanting all this nonsense to end
Chaos been all around me
Now I'm coughing in my fucking skin
Reminding me of magic and the power darkness has within
I now that they'll never get my spin
I'm showing 'em how the kids could win
They holding me out but then again
[?]
[?] no control in me
My main hope is poetry
They hope [?] but they ain't know I always oversee
They only see a glimpse of me
They come and go then it repeats
I'm numb but never dumb
I [?] so I can
Weight up on my shoulders
[?]
But when them tables turn
The bridges burn and breaking in between
[?] misery
Miss me with negativity
Admitting different energies has been the focus
[?]
Change [?]
Changed like chaotic [?]

[Chorus]
Where I go, I don't know where I'm going
Cause I've been [?]
Rain, rain go away
Let me see another day
All my demons wanna play
But I just wanna be okay
Be okay
I just wanna be okay

[Outro]
