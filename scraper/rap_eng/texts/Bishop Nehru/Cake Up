[Hook]
I remember late every night I used to stay up
Busy making tracks until my moms had to wake up
They thought I was slack, never thought that I could rake up
Now I'm getting it back so I work on getting my cake up
Get my cake up
This gon' get my cake up
Get my cake up
This gon' get my cake up
Get my cake up
This gon' get my cake up
All this hard work I swear that this gon' get my cake up

[Verse 1]
They thinking that I made it but this king ain't even Steven
My team's still [?]
It's gold then they retrieving
I remember skipping class, hopping [?] before the weekend
The team had came up on the gas so we chiefing
But now that past is leaving and I'm scheming for a reason
Achieving what I've been dreaming, they see it like live streaming
That's probably why his mommy hot like she's steaming
Seen the kid in the spot now she wanna eat semen
A couple months now all of 'em feinding
I knew a sudden I was here for a reason, they hope
They hope I weaken but I'm up slow like peaking
They be in the deep end
I see what they seek, they sneaking just to greet ya
Me, I'm friends with Yin and Yang [?]
You slower lames rising with the solar flame
That symbolizes golden brains [?] open lane
While they stay contained through the pain
Remain sane and look what I became

Now I'm getting it back so I work on getting my cake up
Get my cake up
This gon' get my cake up
Get my cake up
This gon' get my cake up
Get my cake up
This gon' get my cake up
All this hard work I swear that this gon' get my cake up
