Plenty wanna see me fall but I can never ever break

(On my pace)
I don’t being impatient I’m just tryna win the race
And I’m ready I don’t care what nigga say

Hit this reggy don’t you put i my face

So just wait I’m a kill
On my way to the mills
It was great, life is chill
Now it’s straight for the hills
