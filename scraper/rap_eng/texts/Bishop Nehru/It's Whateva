[Intro]
Chulo Chulo Bishy, Ughhhh Ugh Check me out

[Verse 1]
These rappers phony nah not my homie
I be chillin lowkey
Fly by my lonely
In my own zone no
No one coached me
I'm a young  Kobe I be going OD
Flow is so heat but I'm so sleek
Cold homie ya whole team weak
Don't like stores it beyond e
Me I got a full tank and gon' speed
Till the cash and they last in the race
I be going like flash can't pass my place
In the past they would hate, now they gravitate
So I grab a taste and  show that they waste
Why wait? When I could annihilate
I bring fire and at a higher rate
Nine years ago I was trying to skate
And get sponsored, now sponsors gettin cray
Just to hear what I be havin to say
They be like, "Yo bishy bish, you slay."
I be like " I know it, I'm a poet, What you been listenin to anyway?"
Haters can decay
Ain't a space to stay
I do what I do and do it my way
I remember when the skies were gray
Now I'm killin these guys like child's play

[Hook]
They can keep hatin, It's whateva
I've been gettin greater, gettin better
Who you? Why you hatin? It's whateva
These dudes steady hatin, it's whateva
It's whateva, it's whateva, it's whateva, it's whateva
Who you? Why you hatin? It's whateva It's whateva It's whateva

[Verse 2]
Bish kicks it well they wish to prevail
A quick pick for real I stick and they fell
Your chick wish to chill
She thick in the bell
We click on the real cause
I don't kiss and tell
Me? I'm a cell and that's just a fact
The tracks I drop crack will break momma's backs
Nah I don't slack need backpacks of Wax
Said they do is backpack but my swags intact
While they tacky don't ask me nothing
I'm a fly NY guy who known for stuntin
It was ninth grade but I had senior's crush
And By the tenth grade I was already buzzin
Now the game I'm running and the fame is coming
But I care for change like a pac or somethin
Too apocalyptic
Got it lookin cryptic
I'm a green lotus
You a dented civic
I don't talk I live it seeing visions vivid
Know that Imma get it
No more acting timid
They know I'm sick just they gonna admit it
What you tryna do I already did it
Young nigga sex symbol I could get wit it
I'm simply wit it and you won't forget it
I'm here for no minutes I'm here to the finish
Ain't here for no minutes I'm here to the finish

[Hook]
