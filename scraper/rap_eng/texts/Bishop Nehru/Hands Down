[Intro Sample from The Emperor's New Groove]
Kuzco: Go!
You threw off my groove
Guard: I'm sorry, but you've thrown off the emperor's groove
Old Guy: Sorry!

Uh, ain't no way, most versatile, uh

[Chorus]
They can think it's chance
But I plan for it, hands down
Now we're young and lit
Cause the vibe like a campground
I been on my shit
Ain't no time, we just play around
Shawty let me hit
Cause my vibe had her hands down
They can think it's chance
But I plan for it, hands down
Now we're young and lit
Cause the vibe like a campground
I been on my shit
Ain't no time, we just play around
Shawty let me hit
Cause my vibe had her hands down

[Verse 1]
They can think it's chance
But I planned it in advance
Now with shawty getting naughty
Want me all up in her pants
I been trying to get the bands
Can't relate to all the hatin'
They the kind to talk down
I'm the one who sitting waiting
Cause I know that I'm amazing
I don't need the confirmation
No one was trying to talk
Now they love a conversation
I don't care about your thoughts
Man, I swear that you're mistaken
I was just a teen and I was killing like I was Raven
I'm the last of the titans that came to do the saving
Now they see me and they waving
Like I'm [?]
If you ain't talking cake
I don't know what you was saying
Trying to shake them like a quake
So you better get to praying
I ain't playing, fuck a game
I'm the boss in the ending
I've been past buzzing
Now I'm about to go for the [?]
And I've got to give my all
Like I'm generous and [?]
Still I'm thinking going up, like it's all about a [?]

[Chorus]
They can think it's chance
But I plan for it, hands down
Now we're young and lit
Cause the vibe like a campground
I been on my shit
Ain't no time, we just play around
Shawty let me hit
Cause my vibe had her hands down
They can think it's chance
But I plan for it, hands down
Now we're young and lit
Cause the vibe like a campground
I been on my shit
Ain't no time, we just play around
Shawty let me hit
Cause my vibe had her hands down

[Verse 2]
Hands down, I'm the man they've been trying to be, huh
Came from the ground, now I won the lottery, huh
Now I call shots, buddy, do you roger me?
I've been stepping up the spot
And they watching cause I'm [?], huh
I gotta O.D., yes indeed, I've been in the lead
Like the lean, they ain't up to speed, so I had to leave
Me, I see your angle
You could never turn the tables
And you must be off the [?]
If you thinking you a [?]
Better watch like it's cable
Cause you're about to see a breakthrough
They thought they could hold me in my place like state schools
Always on the go but still I know to keep it stable
When I was on locked ankles and Kurt Angle
Look, I've been doing all the things that you can't do
Now shawty want to give me head like it's [?]
Leave the beat dead with or without samples
And you're a sinner, I am just something you can't handle

[Chorus]
They can think it's chance
But I plan for it, hands down
Now we're young and lit
Cause the vibe like a campground
I been on my shit
Ain't no time, we just play around
Shawty let me hit
Cause my vibe had her hands down
They can think it's chance
But I plan for it, hands down
Now we're young and lit
Cause the vibe like a campground
I been on my shit
Ain't no time, we just play around
Shawty let me hit
Cause my vibe had her hands down

[Outro]
Haha!
Ain't no way

Niggas know what it is, man
We up so late that it's early, you know?
