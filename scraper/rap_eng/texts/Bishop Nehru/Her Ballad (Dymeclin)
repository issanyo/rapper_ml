[Star Trek monologue about love from the 1999 episode "The Disease"]

[Verse 1]
Your eyes they seen lies
And tears have fallen too
Your mind has been corrupted by guys who want you
But not you for who you are
But what you have and what they need
All they see is you on your knees and ready to please
But not me
See I was different
I was giving you a chance
I let you know in advance
I wasn't there for your pants
But that didn't seem to matter
Cause in the end you scattered
There's a pattern
But I let it go
Because I know what your after
It's love
Really, it's love
The one sent from above
The one that gives you kisses
And lay with you in the tub
The one you with at night and he givin your back a rub
And maybe the guy that you with
That actually give you a hug
That's love
But what do you have?
A nigga with a few tats, two hats, and a temper that's
Leaving your body parts black and blue
You need too
Leave this fool soon
Before he do something major and there's no more you to do
It's Nehru

[Hook]
No tears
I don't want to see you cry x3
Don't cry
Wipe the tears from your eyes x3
I said don't cry, please
I don't want to see you cry

[Verse 2]
Days past you with him
I don't get it what's going on
I coulda sworn your heart is with this man had torn
I'm on tour
Thinking of you is what I cannot have
Cause you with a lad who grabs you and throwing you jabs
And it's sad because you love-struck, I mean he was your first
So that gives the nigga a reason to yell at you and to curse?
Why? because he's a man bigger than you and he
Demands you to stand while he sets the stand
To follow all his plans
Fuck it
You don't need him
Leave him
He's foolish to let you go
That's what he basically did
When he threw those blows
I know it's gonna be hard
But you can find a way through
I promise to help you find it
You just gotta want to

[Hook]
