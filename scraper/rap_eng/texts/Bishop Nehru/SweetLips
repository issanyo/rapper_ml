[Verse 1]
I'm walking down the hall and I’m waiting to see your face
A real impregnable feeling I’m chilling, for-real its great
And I wish, we could take some time alone to get know each other
Once we known each other, we can stay at home and phone each other
No phony covers I'mma mention your name
I hope you thinking the same, I ain't playing a game
This shit is insane. I knew you for a month and some change
And still I’m catching all these feelings I can't even complain
Cuz when I'm around you its a whole different thing
I think of dropping to a Knee and giving you a new ring
The pain it bring, when I see you with other guys most of them I despise
I swear its the weirdest vibe, I try not
To get jeal—I mean embarrassed for you; my pride's kicked in
I'm so sick of sitting in class and listening to "this plus the third" and
"She's a bird"—you're mine, lesson adjourned, nothing learned

[Hook.]
Girl you're the cutest to me
Say you're the cutest to me
Girl I swear you're the cutest to me
Girl I swear you're the cutest to me
You're the cutest to me
Yeah I said you're the cutest to me
Yeah I swear you're the cutest to me
Yeah girl I swear you're the cutest to me
I swear you're the cutest to me

[Bridge.]
I hope you ain't here cash, sorry girl but I don't got a lot yet I
Promise I can pay you with laughs, for as long as you want, you can trust that. And I swear I'm in love cuz I ain't ever felt like this. I said I swear I'm in love, cause I ain't ever felt like this

[Verse 2]
I wish we were together more, you're the one I adore
Never snore when I’m with you my heart hits the floor
There's a distant roar fuck its one of your whores
As soon as we starting talking people people coming in fours like
Let's go, it's time to go to class. We late anyway
And girl you know I'm tryna pass
I just want us to last so I can forget the past
Those other women were trash I want you and want you fast
You're in my grasp like a cheetah to prey
I mean I’m ready to cuff but I… wait, what I say? Damn you got me tripping
Never thought I’d see the day
Where those words leave my mouth I guess it's something about you
