[Verse 1]
Uh
The hopeless and poetic
Turned dopest then prophetic
They so pathetic
I did better than I could have ever said it
But level headed
Cause the bills got to get collected
They yapping as if they know me
Homie you could get to stepping
Was chilling by my lonely ain't need a best friend
Cause when I did
He was close to my chick and he slid and
Then it was different, forget niggas and bitches too
The ones you think are the closest can change and switch they view
It sound crazy but it's true
The lesson confirmed it
I learned but I'm standing firm and never refurbished
Been through a lot of hurt but it served purpose
Show what my worth is
Thought that I was worthless
And wanted to be off of the surface
But it's crazy how life reverses because now I send them to the hearse
And the haters quickly disperse
Swear that I ain't worried about a man because I could be living worse

[Hook]
I remember that I was starting from the dirt
Maintained through the pain and the hurt
Not a boy coming up like vert'
It's just a notification I hope you get the alert
Yea, I hope you get the alert
I hope you get the alert
Maintain through the pain and the hurt
I just hope you get the alert

(Let that joint breath)

[Verse 2]
Uh yeah
Getting older so knowing there's no time to play
Gotta get it andale whether night time or day
It's time for pay
Ain't letting chances slide away
I'mma divide ways when clouds and skies are gray
If it took a million days still I'd find a way
To make sure my mother stress less and she finally straight
Got my dreams chasing me call it fate
Was up late nothing nate
Just hopes to be great
Moms cooked but I missed it working on the tape
Then I wait and have crabs or ramen to make
Rhyming all night my craft got me awake
Could never fake a laugh cause I had to get it fast
Mom up for work like "boy you better pass"
Same day I go to school and I'm sleeping in the class
Or battling with teachers
I ended up cutting and leaving to grab pizza
But dreams was all I was trying to get a piece of
Now they all alerted like they heard me through a speaker
In like reefs we about to get deeper
I'm ready to kill 'em all just call for the reaper
It's Bishy the b-eater

Yeah...

[Hook]
I remember that I was starting from the dirt

Yea, I hope you get the alert
I hope you get the alert
Maintain through the pain and the hurt
I just hope you get the alert
