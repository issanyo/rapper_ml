[Intro]
(You know what time it is when you hear this right)
Let's get it New York, let's get it
We got one, let's get it
We all the way out in London with the one time
Look
Global not local
Check this shit
Yo, look, look, I said

[Verse 1]
This is the stage that I've waited for my entire life
Swear these nigga tired, I'm bringing fire and all the light
They be like 'This youngen right, to all the others, it's goodnight'
We gon' keep 'em slept on and tuck 'em in hella tight
[?] going up like a kite
Can't give attention to bitches, they riding with the hype
We don't even care to see your face, na this isn't Skype
And niggas keep saying they fresh, then I guess that I'm right
In the hood tryna get out like it's three strikes
Shark mind so I swear it's nothing when I hear the pike
Coming from the land where they scammed since stolen bikes
[?] switch to cheques like it's old Nikes
Now it's cards, they go swipe
So the hoes want pipe
They just love the image, when the gimmick switches, you'll be dropped
That's the reason why I do me as if I was a type
Living care-free from to go like [?]
It's hard in the streets but hot when I'm by the mic
In the booth, Nehru's the truth, other dudes are aight
You can't do what I do so don't even try
How're you the man? You can't even look me in my eyes
Sick and tired of all the lies
Thinking I won't recognise
'Cause I'm what not but this young boy very wise
Knowing every chick is an actress, it's just in disguise
Halle Berry's playing [?], all for a rise
I play Clinton, still get my wood between her thighs
After that, it's another Dutchie, heading to the sky
I don't run out like an unlimited supply
I do this for me 'cause I know nobody by my side
They all want a piece or they tryna hit your ride
So I never care about a chick or a nigga, why?
'Cause I know both of them can switch right before your eyes
Been at it for a minute, how you mad? I got a price
The flow's ongoing
