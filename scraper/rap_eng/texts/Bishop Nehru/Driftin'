[Skit]
Welcome, sir. How are you this evening?
I'm cool. You?
Very well, sir, thank you. May I see your ID?
Sure, sure. Here you go
Ah, Bishop. They've spoken highly of you
Floor 77, first door on the right
Appreciate it

[Verse 1]
I'm an emperor and you'll surely witness
I'm from Kether but I been in malkuth doing business
Moving vicious cause I see the cycle getting repetitious
And plenty of motherfuckers dead sleeping with the fishes
It's really getting ridiculous, most folks are envious
Or they either scared and then fear like insidious
Times been ugly but now they just hideous
Everybody's a killer and they trying to hide theyself from us
I'm just being me, never switching for the bucks
I'm in y'all's plan so I'm something no man can touch
I been going ham like I'm playing in the clutch
Got the Kyrie step back when actors acting up
Been this way since a pup, you can't even get a suck
Fuck a sub, if you acting different then you getting snubbed
And I ain't even let 'em come back like the Cubs
That's a dub, I'ma fly like a dove so what's up

[Hook]
Lost in my mind and I'm driftin'
Lost in my mind seeing different
I've been lost in my mind and I'm driftin'
I've been lost in my mind seeing different

[Verse 2]
If you ain't showing love then you only showing hate
And I already get enough
Wanting cream, need it double stuffed
That alone with the knowledge got my conscience rising up
The frequency way higher than when I was out of luck
So fuck it, if they ain't riding I'ma leave 'em stuck
Cause most of 'em like Biden, Joe's tryna get a buck
I'm a pro so they duck and say I'm loco
Meanwhile rappers say the same thing like Coco
So I gotta snap like necks in bad choke holds
I don't see a threat, I don't stress over Bozo's
I bounce back the best and that's no pogo
I did it all solo with the mind of a mogul
They tried to throw a low blow, no
I got my guard higher like I got God higher
Starters getting  brighter
Hanging in like a fighter, I gotta be liver
Show a bob and weave and end it with good nighters

[Hook]
Lost in my mind and I'm driftin'
Lost in my mind seeing different
I've been lost in my mind and I'm driftin'
I've been lost in my mind seeing different
