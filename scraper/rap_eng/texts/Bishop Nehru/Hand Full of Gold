[Intro]
Aye, haha, yeah
In a way, um, aye, aye, aye

[Hook]
I got a hand full of gold
Came from me chasing my goals
I don’t be chasing these hoes
They love to wait for the glow
Wanna live good I suppose
I’m living good I suppose wow
I got a hand full of gold
I got a hand full of gold now
I got a hand full of gold
Came from me chasing my goals
I don’t be chasing these hoes
They love to wait for the glow
Wanna live good I suppose
I’m living good I suppose wow
I got a hand full of gold
I got a hand full of gold now

[Verse 1]
Really I been on the road
Soon I be coming to your town
I let them know when it’s go
They try to tell me to slow down
I heard them say I’m a blow
I know I’m bout to explode now
I gotta away on the low
Like it was Mike I’m in Motown
I been the one with the dopest sound
They didn’t know I would hold it down
They try to say I was underground
They didn’t know I would to crowds
Thought they would give me the run around
But I been knowing that I’m a astound
Now I’m gon go and approach them now
Showing them waves they bout to drown
Aye, I’m tryna get it all
Why they be wishing this king would fall aye
I know that this my call
Gotta be running the overgrowth aye
I ain’t the type to stall
The type that gotta be rising tall aye
Really the hand a pole
But this looking like a [?] for ya’ll, aye
Only full of the misery
I’ve been bugging like it was  a centipede
Getting ducking so shorty she into me
And that nigga she with wanna envy me
These dudes are fools they missed a T
Now our life could change within a week
So they get me to pray like she a geek
Now the gold is saying that she a [?]
