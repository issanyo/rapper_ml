[Intro]
Alright, whatever
Real shit
[?]

[Verse 1]
Patience is thin again
Getting hard to grin again
[?]
This kid has been a menacing mind, they tried mending him
I'm sending my amends [?] to put it into them
The only synonym of the goat should be the emperor
Moving sinister, he from NY no [?]
Ain’t nobody litter bruh
The youth made him blow so I ain't giving up
The truth is gon' prevail so I don’t give a fuck
Never thought miniature, my thoughts have been massive
[?]
Once these ideas are free he can never be inactive
I'm moving too savage like governmental tactics
For erasing all the black kids mind before they bloom
[?] the kid gon' shine in any room
Got 'em doomed now the emperor's back out of the tomb
[?] niggas gassed
I'm blowing off of the fumes, easy
