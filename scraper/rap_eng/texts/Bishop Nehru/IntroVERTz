[Intro]
Uh
Yeah
Check check (check check)
Uh
Take over your shit
No guns on the run
Take over your shit
Shoguns on the run

[Verse 1]
I'm used to being alone
Just me and symphonies
Now I'm never prone
And these interviewers are sent to me
Sympathy? Show none to foes
I'm shogun, don't hold guns
But know that the flows stun
So hoes run, in my direction
Still striving for perfection
Addressing shorty undressing
She testing I'm heavy stressing
The lesson is take lesser hits
When there's messes near
Cause sentences
Get sentimented into ten
With pens I'm ten
My flow gold you low bro
Plus my vocals
Leave local hoes boastful
They happier than me
Shit

[Verse 2]
I'm used to being alone
Just me and symphonies
Now I'm never home
And the bloggers eager to get to me
Vividly, living these dreams
That others wish to me
Filing beats, writing these lines
That bring them to their feet
Defeat is far, no bars
Go far as far goes
We discard hoes
And disregard harmfuls
We harm foes no arms tho just hard flows
I sparkle, you can spark more
You narks know
I can keep you stressin'
To confess about the weapon I was blessin'
They just test wit
Now lets get out of this quickly
You trying to get me
For holding a piffy
But that ain't my history
Don't diss please
I'm displeased
It's sickening what I been seeing
Rather stricling the flip kings and sing sing
Flip kings and sing sing
Yeah
