[Intro]
I can't explain why, I shine and no one else shines
I think everybody shines, in different things
And a lot of things I can't do
I can't play basketball like every other black person in america
But, I can act
I know how to go to that true spot in myself cause I'm there everyday
I can be me, I can be whoever cause I'm true to me I can go to neutral easy

[Verse 1]
I used to think about my dreams when I was alone
And that was often cause nobody ever called my phone
I can be great without a ring like Karl Malone
Take the throne and maybe I won't be left at home
Second grade I was writing by the monkey bars
Who ever thought a simple dream could take me this far
I used to tell them all my thoughts, they called me bizarre
Until they saw my video on WorldStar
I'm by far, the best rapper at 15
My wrist gleam my pockets wide not filled with cream
Just a spoken words I wrote not the hoes I choke or all the guns I tote
I don't do it

[Verse 2]
I stay back and I watch everything around
I see your presence they tryna stress us to hold us down
You won't compress it, me I will express it
Freely, and if they beat me better believe my talking won't stop
I'm higher than a motherfucker walking down the block in my tank top
I promise myself I wasn't gon stop
A new house for my mom what I'm tryna cop
Bomb drops ain't for me
And I'm just waiting for my presents like it's Christmas Eve
Man just wait and see, I don't care about diamonds and expensive things
I just want a nice girl in some bright weave

[Outro x2]
Something we all adore
It's the one thing worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game, searching for fortune and fame
