[Verse 1]
April showers made my daisies even greater
But somedays I wish I was away and with the craters
My soul is on a quest for the fruits of my own labor
I'mma take these small bites so the flavors get savoured
And now not later
Cause time won't wait for
No man, so go plan, collecting like data
Wanted the top spot since a tot like taters
Double down on myself like I'm Dion Waiters and

[Chorus: LION BABE]
All those April showers, on my flowers for me
For me, for me
I need the stars and wish that I could fly into space
To space, to space
And go up, up, up, up, up, up and away!
Away, away

[Verse 2]
I saw the negative thoughts that were caught in the bubble
It's usually trouble, but now I let them cover in rubble
I'm living royal but all of these haters be wanting to rumble
Hoping I stumble, wanting this empire to crumble
I can't fumble
Movin' it lucid through all hurdles
Exclusive at all times, I'm never the new gerbil
I'm leading like the colonel
Coping with all the hurtful
Knowing that in the end my patience'll be a virtue
They late like curfew but the waves still early
I'm knowing they don't get me, parents probably think I'm girly
Cause of instead of a drum, my favourite noise is a whirly
Easy to feel numb when you caught up in a worldie

[Chorus: LION BABE]
All those April showers, on my flowers for me
For me, for me
I need the stars and wish that I could fly into space
To space, to space
And go up, up, up, up, up, up and away!
Away, away

Up, up, up, up, up, up and away!
Away, away
