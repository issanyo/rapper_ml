[Sample from Chingy's "Pullin' Me Back" ft. Tyrese]
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right

[Chorus]
Get a little close, baby I just wanna hold you
Why you do the most? Baby you know what I go through
No this ain't a joke, I'm just tryna get to know you
We can take it slow, you just gotta let me show
Cause you know you always be on my mind
I think of you all the time

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm thinking of you often, you know what that results in
Me overthinking and leaving my mind inside a coffin
And often it's exhausting but you know just who I'm wanting
So just quit with all the taunting cause your mind's what I get lost in
I love it when we talking, meaning me and you
Them others on the side they kill the vibe when we be in the mood
And yeah I got a lot to prove, really it ain't nothing new
I'm used to having to show 'em actions that make 'em get the view
Now you see it and you want it, just believe it
If I say it then I mean it, fire burning like a phoenix
So we gotta make it work through the anger and the hurt
Cause you know I know the worth and I will never do you dirt
Why you staying on alert I've been working for your crown
And your friends think the worst so they tryna slow us down
I ain't tryna show you hurt, it's the other way around
Let me see you smile first, I don't wanna see you frown, just

[Chorus]
Get a little close, baby I just wanna hold you
Why you do the most? Baby you know what I go through
No this ain't a joke, I'm just tryna get to know you
We can take it slow, you just gotta let me show
Cause you know you always be on my mind
I think of you all the time

[Verse 2]
I go to sleep and I see you, I'm released from the evils
And these people, we lifting needles tryna see peaceful
They say I'm gifted so I'm giving mine for you to keep boo
[?] cause we need to be seen as regal
And [?] make you a believer
Please stand by [?] like Jason [?]
They hating when I see ya and waiting for a see ya
In my mind we'll be finer when we both seniors
Either it's here now, I'm clearing your tears now
Staring into your fears, exhausting ain't around
On the real ain't too many things that I need around
But what's an emperor without an empress to give a crown
Now I found what I needed, a piece like me
And we both so conceited but you would never see it
So I'ma make you take it, ain't no way that you can leave it
Cause this shit already written, you just gotta sit and read it

[Chorus]
Get a little close, baby I just wanna hold you
Why you do the most? Baby you know what I go through
No this ain't a joke, I'm just tryna get to know you
We can take it slow, you just gotta let me show
Cause you know you always be on my mind
I think of you all the time
