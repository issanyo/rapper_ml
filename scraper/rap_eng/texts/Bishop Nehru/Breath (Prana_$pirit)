[Verse 1]
Stuck in my spirit, trying to find endearment
Nowhere near it, but I know I’m here to feel it
So I never let fear get in as a clear threat
I just make my music and use it to heal breath
Breath is the spirit, you should try breathing
I do mine with (puff) and not just on the weekends
Sometimes I feel like I’m going in the deep end
Then I’m deep in, no need to depend
Cause even the pen descends for a second
Teaching me to lead and not to be second
To my own low thoughts leveling
I just want to meddle in
Not one for being the most medaling kid
I’m sick of it and thinking big
Trying to keep the game from getting rigged
Cause my eyesight of the real is thinner than a twig
Puts the scent in the wig, all aligned with energy
From a pyramid in the grid

[Hook] x2
I hear free-spirited is always best
So I invest in rest and focus on breath
Cause breath is the spirit
Cause without it there’s death
Then the spirit just exits
And moves on separate

[Verse 2]
A cherisher of breath
Ever since an asthma attack in the past
Had me a gasping mess
Felt like I was addressing death
But fortunately I wasn’t next
And they told me hold it, inhale it, depress
I did it excessive and got high off that
Just some nerds third grade just (puff) it in the back
After recess actually, in gym too if I had to breathe then I’d leave
Dizzy in the hall trippy Albuterol all in me
Still no sips can befriend me
To get their Henny, I still ain’t have it in me
Not an enemy but I’ll leave its entry, cup empty
But they think I’m drunk off of plenty
80 A’s, D placed in this tin
And a HD screen still plays me big
The tips are believing like Biebs was singing

[Hook] x4
