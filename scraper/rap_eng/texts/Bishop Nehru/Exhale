[Intro: Bishop Nehru]
Yeah, yeah. Fuck is up nigga?
Suburban Shoguns out this bitch, nigga
On some exhale shit. Fuck wrong with you niggas?
Bout to take over this Hip-Hop shit
Y'all niggas ain't Hip-Hop artists, y'all niggas is rappers
Get that shit right. We out here, nigga

[Verse 1: Que Hampton]
Check it, crack flows cracked floors when I'm stepping on
Your sound waves never heard it coming, nigga death did
Shit you gotta respect it, the Shogun on the record
Bound to chop the top off billboard slots
The autopsy read his head is departed from the necklace, the lettuce
So love Christ you get the message
Godly with this shit, so refreshing to know I got the flow to do in a dude reckless
Nigga sword to the stu'

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
I'm battering lives with the pad n' the mic, bashin' the trife
Flows make em' grab for a knife
Before hoes thought he would go postal, now I'm killing em' global with all of these cold flows
Niggas don't know
How they gon' hate? They stay saying I'm cocky, niggas is not me, they back nigga don't jock me
I kill em' no probably, got mad bills no Cosby, started mad autopsies, who the fuck is gon' stop me?

[Verse 3: Que Hampton]
Que and the ruder niggas you figure it get no iller if
Iggy was with me the semi would surely hit ya
The mind a lethal weapon, I wreck it with lethal seconds, I'm lethal with the nine so
The breath will leave you at seven
Can't stand a sixteen, goddamn I spit mean
My flow slit wrists, hit arteries, just shit
My jet stream don't let em' get steam, I mean bad business
Show you what will happen in a casket, rap business

[Verse 4: Bishop Nehru]
Crossin' the seas in different seasons, leavin' beats in defeat when I'm speakin'
People greeting a God cause I go harder, any track know I slaughter, could probably sleep with ya daughter
I'll be on a-mission to straight riches, niggas ask to get on track, they axe missin', and in fact, I act missin'
Now I'm the cat that dissin', I'm a lion, niggas lying, they ain't beating this kitten

[Verse 5: Que Hampton]
Awe shit, I'm rapping mad ign'ant, the black cat bad luck, but attacking with the writtens
Attacking all the kittens, they have to get their lickings
Eat it up, and beat it up, keys will lock dreams for cream
Drop-top beams, my themes drop top mean, she fiends for top speed
Which means hot rod fiend, never drop keys or weed in my pocket
A lighter to spark it in the heart that beats, beats, and beats the hardest

[Verse 6: Bishop Nehru]
Me n' Que Ham go Rambo, where's the ammo, niggas ran home, we dismantle your mans hole
Jock and handle, these grand flows, we hot as a candle, so know that the fans go demand more
No name drops, niggas not insane, they'll be all black like a gothic gang, got this game in a lock
It's strange cause nauseous lames spit all this nonsense that still got this fame, it's a shame..
