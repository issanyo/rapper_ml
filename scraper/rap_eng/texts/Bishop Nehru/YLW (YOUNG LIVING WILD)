[Hook:Bishop Nehru]
Stop playing around
And I made me a vow
Look at me now they in love with the style
Watching in ? I'm young living wild
I'm young living wild
I'm young living wild
Knew I could do it ever since I was a child
So I put in work and it all worked out
Look at me now, I'm young living wild
I'm young living wild
I'm young living wild

[Verse 1:Bishop Nehru]
Feeling euphoric
I hear the beat,my lyrics forking
Until it forfeit or eargasms have em stuck in orbit
They try to gas em I tell em keep it in store and
They mad and living boring
I'm soaring trying to get more lit
I was distorted, but now the mission's aborted
Used to retort, but now I just wait to record it
And to ignore it, but it really ain't important
And now I'm porting more fortunes so fam could be affording it
You [?] in the store that's the reason I don't sleep anymore
Used to be the creep peep seen as immature
Now they see he's so much more
Truly me and I'm me to the core
The flees get ignored when you leading the score
Seems that they bored seeking rewards
I'm just trying to be receiving awards
Leaving their jaw the on the floor
They in awe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If they gon' hate
Then I might as well make sense I don't even rap
I just vent and invent
Wit was pent inside
Put the pride to the side
Cause we all got problems that we all think align with
Needed a plan so I started to devise it
Took time now her son's on the rise like her eyes is
Always working like phones in Verizon
The biddies want growth so these guys is despising
Couldn't cope the sky's lit and lit the lighting then
I lightened up as I got enlightened
Others pretend basing knowledge on likings
That's the lies type that I tell go hiking
Like send us the QBs before spiking
Watch who you idolize and move like a viking
I been living my life just trying and climbing
They finally finding this diamond is flying
