[Verse 1]

You get crushed, this flow super deluxe
This hoes trying get bucks
It's slow, shorty good luck
My 4's don't give a fuck, I know they [?]
Talking tough, [?]
It's just, a little fickle
How you mention dimes and nickles
When your driving rentals, trying show you high in residential
Use your mental, the odds against you
Is it an issue that my tinsel got the worded issue
Coincidental
I suppose, niggas pose, I expose their toes
I'm a stone, in alone, I rip bones get stoned
Cause this flow gets souls and slit bones
Just know

[Outro]
Just know
Yeah
Just know
The illest flows, the realist though
I'm killing fours
Uhh, Uhhhh
Guess that's it

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Yo yo
Check
Flow one

Nigga' I been spittin'
The flow I hold tittin[?], hidden niggas listenin'
Flow golly like it’s Christian
They wishin' they was in my position
Dissin' I’m dismissin' missions[?]
But still there’s hella tension
I’m the one they mention
So people try and fight and shit I light a spliff
Hold it near the dome and take the life from it
I write these rhymes while you lightin' nines
And this one for all my brothers on Riker’s Island
No lyin', niggas is [?] and I’m a lion
Realignin' the game is getting tiren
All the timin' is off for other tyrants
They still tryin' but can’t find a supply-ren
Since nine-six my minds went through mind tricks
Others try and get with lyin' chicks I’m lyin' with
A dime sister, a mister mishits
Ya missin' hits since your incense was lit up
You get crushed, this flow super deluxe
These hoes trying get bucks
It’s slow, shorty good luck
My fours don’t give a fuck
I know they livin' stuck [?]
Talkin' tough yet they really(?) prentendin' bout they trucks
Its just a little fickle
How you mention dimes and nickles
When you drivin' rentals
Tryin' to show you higher residentials
Use your mental, the odds against you
Is it an issue that my stencil got the [?] issue
Coincidental, I suppose niggas pose
I expose their tones
I’m a stone when alone
And rip bones get sewn
Cuz this flow gets souls and slipped domes [?] just know (just know)

Yeah. Just know
The illest flow
The realest though
I’m killin' foes

Uhhhhhhh
I guess that’s it
