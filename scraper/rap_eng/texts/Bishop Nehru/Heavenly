[Intro]

[Hook]
I been trying to live heavenly
Niggas hating, I already see
They be thinking they ahead of me
It's whatever, I'll let it be
I'm just tryna live heavenly
Got a globe that I'm tryna see
I ain't messing with the jealousy
I don't need that next to me
I'm just tryna live heavenly
I'm just tryna live heavenly
I'm just tryna live heavenly
I'm just tryna live heavenly
Got a globe that I'm tryna see
I ain't messing with the jealousy
I'm just tryna live heavenly
I'm just tryna live heavenly

[Verse 1]
Say they love my energy so I dump on enemies
Niggas hate I'm getting cheese
Most wanna be friends with me
I don't boast, I'll let 'em see
I'm coast to coast, I'm living free
Music really the remedy
I promise y'all gon' remember me
Grown into a better me so I feel real heavenly
They be snakes, we'll let 'em be
Just know I know that tendency
I meant to be something way greater
Was in the dark like Darth Vader
Now it's like they all want favors
I just light it but they use my papers
Different vapors I inhale
Cause the world cold like I'm in hell
My head higher than a camel trail
So I grind like I'm on a thin rail
I gotta shine, I won't bail
These kids garbage, show 'em the pale
Y'all gotta feel me like it was braille
Been finding balance more than a scale

[Verse 2]
Got a lot that I'm tryna see so
I'm trying to live heavenly though
People hating, it really ain't [?]
I also get hella love and embrace it
Like MJ, they say he's amazing
[?] raise the bar, keep raising
Young and I'm blazing like CJ
He stay going cray, ain't no delay
They watch my moves like play-by-plays
Still I move at my pace
Dreams are all that I'm trying chase
And a peace of mind so I'm keeping faith
It get hard but you can't break
Be a master just like shake
What don't matter is up at stakes
Try to get close, tell 'em pump the brakes
Man fuck the fakes, they used to doubt me
They all following trying to surround me
Stand alone and do it proudly
All the extra stuff doesn't wow me
Rather meditate out in Maui
In search for peace like there's a bounty
They would sleep like Taz drowsy
I made noise and made it soundly
