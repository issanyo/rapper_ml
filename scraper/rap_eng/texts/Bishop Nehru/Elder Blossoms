[Verse: Bishop Nehru]
My thoughts, are like a bright symphony
I'm simply, changing everything that I begin to see
Mentally, but physically I plan to change history
With a pen, note pad and a distant dream
But distance ain't a obstacle, that's too much
I'm closer than you think to the stars, nigga look up
Seeing adolescent with impressive rhymes, chasin' dimes
Not the kind that want cash, but the ones that's inside
Of my pocket, while I pocket some of these profits
Nigga's watch it and try to stop it, but all I do is block it
Straight lock it up, my cash started risin' up
Now everybody and they best friend try to ride with us
Never had a team, just a couple friends
Too many people around will hurt you in the end
Don't pretend you niggas would never kin, you tryna step in the circle but ain't allowed to get in
I'm getting more attention than I'm wishing
Not bitching, just surprised and did I mention, when I'm sentencing, people listening
Cause my songs go harder than crack interventions
Uh, living life like a menace
Tryna get in this game and leave with some riches
No need for bitches, but I'm down for pictures
As long as they ain't girls that got no figures
Uh, Jordan 7's on my feet
Don't ask to come chill, girl I'm busy making beats
When I was in the hall you would never even speak
Now your tryna come through every day of the week
Shits crazy, you living real shady
And don't send me text messages calling me baby
I thought you were a lady, didn't give it up daily
And only enjoy boys who didn't like mainstream
Well I do, and this is nothing new
But looks like this life I ainâ€™t living for you
I know that you in love, but baby that sounds through
When the size don't fit, so why would I wear the shoe?
This ain't a love song so I'mma skip bars, rip hard, grip stars then dip off
Peace!
