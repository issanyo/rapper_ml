[Hook]
Where'd you go, left me here to pick up all this shit
Fuck you think, I got time that you don't got
And where have you been, left me here to live with all this shit
Fuck you think, that I'll forget them fucked up things you did
I need to know, where's the end

[Verse 1]
Let's talk about things we both got in common
Trying to find the place that we started
Feels okay when I'm drunk and not bothered
But when the drink dries somehow I'm still drowning
The person looking at you in the mirror
That's the only one that got between us

[Hook]
And I know, you've got some things you won't get off your chest
So, whiskey on my breath, I need some help
I need to know, where's the end

[Verse 2]
Talk of city dreams, small town in the rear view
We a team, it feels better when I'm near you
Missing home, but when I'm there I still feel gone
Even when I fix it I still feel wrong
Finally got the time to get my money right
I don't give a fuck, I'm getting back tonight

[Hook]
Where'd you go, left me here to pick up all this shit
Fuck you think, I got time that you don't got for me
I need to know, where's the end
And I know, you've got some things you won't get off your chest
So, whiskey on my breath, I need some help
I need to know, where's the end

[Outro]
Liquor in my cup, I've been drinking straight since 4 am last week
And I know I got some issues baby
I can't handle how you've made me, no
I need to know, where's the end
