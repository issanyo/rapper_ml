[Verse 1]
I look back I feel I've been out of place, cause I've probably been
I've been on a lot of shit, talking lot of shit
Most these guys are faking, ain't (?)
But I'm the one to check them, yeah I'm on my hockey stick
Sound so anonymous, they can't copy this
I write the words, I write the plan, we're out here
I get what I want, so I need a lot of shit
I'm with all my dogs, yeah
They switching sides, I'd rather die
Don't kill the vibe, yeah I just want what I want, I'm living right
If that's just wrong then I'm wrong, can't tell no lie
I swear I'm wrong 'till I go, ain't scared to die

[Hook]
In my Freshletes on my PJ
Haven't slept in like three days
Got my dogs here, but I need space
Taking cat naps going the wrong way, yeah
That's (?)
Looking at this place on the replay
And the front house on (?)
If it goes down, then we straight
That's the way to go, that's the way to go

[Verse 2]
If they counting me out, bet you they lost the count
If they try calling me out, that ain't never worked out
Gotta make them learn their lesson than make momma proud
Rather make a little less than more to live in the now
That's right, you can say I'm settled down but I ain't settle though
If I gotta settle Imma do the center fold
Last shit that happened, that's just cool I let it go
Only thing I know right now is that you'll never know
Blowing on something loud to help me think
Every word up out my mouth I meant to say
And everybody falls down, I never break
Everybody falls down, yeah

[Hook]
In my Freshletes on my PJ
Haven't slept in like three days
Got my dogs here, but I need space
Taking cat naps going the wrong way, yeah
That's
Looking at this place on the replay
And the front house on (?)
If it goes down, then we straight
That's the way to go, that's the way to go
