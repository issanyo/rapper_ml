[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Yeah, uh, middle finger to my old life all the cold nights
Makes being this hot feel so nice
Yeah I know right, I got a lot to prove
I agree, but to me homie, not to you
I'm yelling fuck the world, it's either sink or swim
'Cuz there ain't no I in team, but there's one in win, right?
They say we are what we choose
Regardless of what they tell you man it's alright to lose
'Cuz without the rain, the sunshine is not the same
You see me smiling, but it's not a game
You need the pain if you want to be special
'Cuz in order to be a diamond there's gotta be pressure
And through the music's where I find my direction
Standing in the mirror, inspired by the reflection
And life's a revolving door
'Cuz if miss your chance to go there's always more

[Hook]
A year ago, they didn't give a fuck about where I was
So who the hell are all of ya'll to judge
They don't know about us
And it's safe to say I'm doing just fine
Regardless of what they putting in your mind
They don't know about us
And now they want to get into my shows
Climbing to the top all on my own
They don't about us
And even though I never graduated
You know I'm just trying to get you educated
We gonna take 'em to school

[Verse 2: Huey Mack]
Growing up I knew that I had it in me
They told me I wouldn't make it, not many people were friendly
They used to make their disses, but they never could offend me
'Cuz I went from nobody to somebody they could envy
And I could give a damn if my shows are getting crowded
'Cuz my mom just lost her house and I couldn't do shit about it
That's why I gotta make it,'cuz it hurts to see you hurt
But soon enough you'll never find an empty purse
And I know I've been a fuck up, but I promise that'll change soon
I'll make you proud if I never step another foot in the classroom
Look I kept my head to the sky and I gave my heart to God
And I ain't Tyler but my future looking kind of odd
But it's brighter than ever
I got a Fonzworth Bentley for when I'm under the weather
They still trying to hate, just tell 'em I'm doing great
I'm just traveling the states and learning from my mistakes

[Hook]
