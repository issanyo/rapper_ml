[Verse 1]
Hell nah I ain't sleep today but I'mma be okay
Miss my family on the east, but fuck it I can't leave L.A
Every meeting that I be in, trust me I just lead the way
I fucked three times before 3 today, piece of cake
Never gave a fuck about what the teacher say, cause either way
I'mma just do me, and she said me too, I said "s'il vous pla√Æt"
Walking out the club with me and TMZ is out here
Ain't no secret safe
If that's your girl, why's she in my section?
If that's your girl, why's she doing role play
Going both ways like an intersection?
Stole her like an interception
But you can have her back she asks a million questions

[Hook]
Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one, you knew that

[Verse 2]
Everything I see up in my head just comes to life
Got my favorite girl waking up in my bed, it's only right
Bad bitch my only type, independent too, get it boo
Just promise me you won't let all the bullshit they say get to you
You a 10, I'm not perfect but for you I do pretend
I've been working 2 to 10, that AM
Ain't nobody quite like him, put in the time like him
I've been grinding for a while now it's feeling like my time is finally here
That's ideal
That's ideal

[Hook]
Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one, you knew that

[Verse 3]
I've been doing great I guess I can't complain
I don't think about yesterday
Every move is calculated, this shit ain't no guessing game
Only time I'm second place is when I'm at my second place
Made 300 then doubled that, I guess you call that 2nd base
How many come ups until it's destiny
How many come ups until it's meant to be
I hear them talking, that don't get to me
That ain't shit to me, same dude, different dream
This is me

[Bridge]
Ain't nothing pretty but her face
Money hungry, nothing skinny but her waist
She come from money, but she spent it on her titties and her face
If you really wanna know, these women, man they come and go
Cause one minute she's the one, the next you really never know
Cause she don't know a damn thing about love
She don't know a damn thing, at all
Cause one minute she's the one
The next you really never know

[Hook]
Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one

[Outro]
