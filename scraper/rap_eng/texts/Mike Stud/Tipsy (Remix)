Now everybody in the club getting tipsy
(Everybody in the club getting tipsy)

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
When I used to hit the club, I was left out standing
Now I’m in the building and I’m still outstanding
This is what it's like when they say he ‘bout to blow up
Used to wait in line, now they paying me to show up
You now fucking with the unfuckwittable
Even the hospital admit it, I’m inimitable
And sipping Pina Col at intervals is typical
With bitches on my genitals and Kilmer on the visuals
Shit is real homie, we just wanna fuck around
Hit the local bar, go and get another round
And this one’s for those who won’t doubt me
Only person that goes harder than me is Gronkowski
Man I raged at Duke, did the same as a Hoya
Nice with the bars though, should’ve been a lawyer
I guess it’s just the circle of life
So turn this shit up if you thirsty tonight

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Listen, I'm back again, I got class again
But not really but I'm about to go on tour so I'm crashing in
Fuck is happening, you know I brought my party hat
Call Jagged Edge, where the fuck the party at?
Somebody tried to stop me taking shots just like I’m Rocky
Got a hottie trying to ride me like a fucking Kawasaki
Vroom, got these girls going buck wild
I got booty calls homie you get butt dials
Wow, real talk I don't need to lie
She brought a box to my door like a pizza guy
Uh, I'm just a dude with some bad habits
Twitter now a day’s a room full of mad rappers
Trying to count up all my youtube hits
Probably mad cause your chick about youtube this, bitch
Shit I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
To all my people in the club here is a toast to you
