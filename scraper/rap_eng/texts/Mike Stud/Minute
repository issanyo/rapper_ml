[Verse 1: GASHI]
She smoking it up and she drinking this cup
But she throwing it back and I picked that ass up
And I got your bitch in the pretzel when you salty as fuck
I'm the new man in town, I'm the new man in town
Name one bitch that turn me down
Shit, I'm 'bout to fuck your girl right now
Bill Clinton of the rap game
Never corny, don't compare me to these whack lames
Too real for the rap game
I don't wanna chill, y'all faker than your whack chains
GASHI last name, that's a fact mane
I'm the reason that your girl getting back pain
If I ever dissed you, bitch, fuck you
Yeah, cause I ain't never took it back mane
Knew this shit since the beginning
You know that this shit was written
You know that I be just chilling with beautiful women, Jolly Rancher sipping
You know these games we be winning
You know I gave you the business
Never tie, homie, you tripping
Came out my momma box, I'll be so gifted
I'm pitching on my CC, wanted the cash or the CC
Drag you like he-she, she be all up on my pee-pee
You can't be Herman, you Peewee
Varsity balling, no D-league, on a yacht rolling this seaweed
Get these thirsty dumb hoes some Smart Water or Fiji
Get on your toes you can't see me

[Chorus: GASHI]
I waited for a minute, woah
I told you I'ma get it, woah
And now we finally did it, woah
And now we finally winnin', woah
I waited for a minute, woah
I told you I'ma get it, woah
And now we finally did it, woah
And now we finally winnin', woah

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Way too many people counting on us to count us out
Your money my accountant probably counting now, shit is rough
Got them like why, when we go on the road
And them come through a show
And they see all these women and money we getting
I told you we get it, they looking around at the crowd
Like, yup, bro, you really did it, I get it, I get it
I get why they don't wanna give me the credit
Fuck it is what it is, it is what it isn't
Man, this how we live it
I'm come up the fastest, I'm doing some shit that you couldn't imagine
My girl is the baddest, we do it with passion
The music is blasting, my view is fantastic
Yeah, I'm on a wave, but I do not surf
My balcony feel like it's right on the edge of the Earth, so maybe I'll learn
The water is blue, my pockets are green, the sunset is yellow
We shop on Rodeo, we shoot on the rim with the team
Trust me it is what it seems, we living a dream
Move to LA and we killing the scene
Every athlete they come through the city for bitches and liquor
They hitting up me, bitch, I'm a G
G4SHI, G4SHI tried to tell them that we 'bout to get it
If it's a lyric, I did it, froze up on my fitted

[Chorus: GASHI]
I waited for a minute, woah
I told you I'ma get it, woah
And now we finally did it, woah
And now we finally winnin', woah
I waited for a minute, woah
I told you I'ma get it, qoah
And now we finally did it, woah
And now we finally winnin', woah

[Outro]
GASHI, GASHI tried to tell them that we 'bout to get it
(Real shit)
