[Hook 1]
I don't lose much besides interest
Hothead but I'm cooler than New England
And I don't really go out too much no more (nah)
I just sit around all damn day and count benjy's (count it)
I don't lose much besides interest
Can't push my button unless you starting my engine (psh nah)
And I don't really go out too much no more (nah)
Cause the new crib so damn big I went missing

[Verse 1]
Got a lot up on my mind, so I'm gone all the time
They said I couldn't but I did
Now look at theirs, look at mine, I'm fine bitch
I just put a hundred in the pension
Need more press, less questions
Got three and some change in investments
Yeah that's right around where my bench is
Miss me with that bullshit nah this ain't Chicago
My instinct and my girl the only things I follow
Blowing California green I call it avocado
I just keep it lowkey I prefer the high road (I do)
I get lit after dark, pour my drink on the rocks
Put a bar in my spot, neighbors they call the cops
And I do not care yeah, I feel like Rob Dyrdek I got out here on my grind
I don't do this shit for fucks sake, yeah I caught a tough break then I turned nothing to a lot

[Hook 2]
I don't lose much besides interest
Can't push my button unless you starting my engine
And I don't really go out too much no more
Cause the new crib so damn big I went missing

[Verse 2]
Feels good to live a little bit, doesn't it?
I give her Mickey D and she screams "I'm lovin' it" (oh baby)
And I feel like Leo, behind the wheel, yeah bitch I'm revvin it
Got no chill, but I'm frio, get lit for the hell of it
Living the life, sleep when I die
On that, liquor tonight, my limit is high
Right now, I'm on a vibe, give me the light
Oh no, I shouldn't drive, give me a ride
You think I'm slipping hell nah, au contraire
Got the money gotta tell me that it's all there
You ain't hitting what I'm pitching Bumgarner
Other side of the line cause it's not fair, aw yeah

[Hook 1]
I don't lose much besides interest
Hothead but I'm cooler than New England
And I don't really go out too much no more
Naw, I just sit around all damn day and count benjy's (count it)
I don't lose much besides interest
Can't push my button unless you starting my engine
And I don't really go out too much no more
Cause the new crib so damn big I went missing

[Piano outro]
(Yeah I went missing)
