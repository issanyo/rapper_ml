[Hook]
Driving through the night
Looking for you
Baby let me know
I'm spinning out of control
Like a roller coaster
Making me feel some type of way
All of these thoughts I can't explain

[Bridge]
Are you saying something? I just can't change
But I've been trying to, I know I'm supposed to do
Everything I said I would
Yeah, usually I'm alone, but now I'm on the road
I ought to know which way to go

[Hook]
Driving through the night
Looking for you, I'm looking for you
And it goes up and down, and it goes round and round
Like a roller coaster
Making me feel some type of way
All of these thoughts I can't explain
I'm still doing my best, I'm on my way

[Verse]
Sipping on this Beam, trying to find a balance
I feel lost without it, I'm okay with being famous if it's for my talents
So I had to get lost to find myself
If I was wrong then I meant well
Is it too late to change our mind, do I take our time, I guess time will tell
I'll take you anywhere
Yeah, where you want to go to girl?
Remember what I told you girl
Better love me for the old dude girl
Because your love got me numb like a drug
Behind this wall I put up, too scared to open it up

[Bridge]
But I've been trying to, I know I'm supposed to do
Everything I said I would
Yeah, usually I'm alone, but now I'm on the road
I ought to know which way to go
