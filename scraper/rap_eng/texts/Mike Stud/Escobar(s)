[Chorus]
I feel like my name is Escobar, I go extra hard
Extra regular but I'm upper echelon
Especially with that credit card, I be playin' hard
It's like I'm movin' weight, way I gotta set the bar
And hell nah I ain't playin' fair, had to make it here
Anytime I think I'm watchin' what you're sayin', yeah
Only pair of J's I wear he was playin' in
Retro, let's go, I feel like Esco-bar

[Verse 1]
This weed will set you free like El Chapo
I feel like the king of the castle
Sneak in to the game through the backdoor
Paparazzi sayin': "who is that though?"
We came in straight through the backdoor
At the chateau
They was lurkin' in the shadows
Then I caught a Cadillac, whoa
Where you at Jos, that's my little Castro
They ain't understand me, they ain't really hear me
I ain't really care, I ain't in it for the Grammy's
I'm in it for the family
In it for the ones that stay near me
Through the lows and the failures

[Chorus]
I feel like my name is Escobar, I go extra hard
Extra regular but I'm upper echelon
Special with that credit card, I be playin' hard
It's like I'm movin' weight, way I gotta set the bar
And hell nah I ain't playin' fair, had to make it here
Anytime I think I'm watchin' what you're sayin', yeah
Only pair of J's I wear he was playin' in
Retro, let's go, I feel like Esco-bar
Escobar

[Verse 2]
Polite in person but still the type to be working overnight
To end the life of every guy who deserves it
I stay connected like cursive
Oh I'm the man, I concur it
I got the bars without service but you don't hear me though, hey
All the ballplayers in here going hard
Had a game so they came from the park
From the stage to the bus to the bar
Things change, but never the squad
It's a new day
Making plays, Bobby Boucher
Got a crib with a few mates
Bat man like Bruce Wayne

[Chorus]
I feel like my name is Escobar, I go extra hard
Extra regular but I'm upper echelon
Special with that credit card, I be playin' hard
It's like I'm movin' weight, way I gotta set the bar
And hell nah I ain't playin' fair, had to make it here
Anytime I think I'm watchin' what you're sayin', yeah
Only pair of J's I wear he was playin' in
Retro, let's go, I feel like Esco-bar
I feel like Escobar

[Outro]
Always find a way to get my own
Jim Boeheim, I am in my zone
All day, always, yeah yeah yeah
All day, always, yeah yeah yeah
Always find a way to get my own
Jim Boeheim, I am in my zone
All day, always, yeah yeah yeah
All day, always, yeah yeah yeah
