[Intro/Outro]
Da da da dee, don't you wanna be
Dancin' with Miley, and doin' whatever we want yeah, yeah-eah
(This is our party we can do what we wanna)
Can't stop, won't stop, got to come and get us cause we
We get down baby, we get down baby
Girls, the girls they love us
(This is our party we can do what we wanna)

[Hook]
And we can't stop
And we won't stop, no

Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life

[Verse 1]
Ashin' a cigarette in my tour bus
Four rum drinks in and that's before lunch
And you could say the way I'm livin' is wrong
But if you lived like I live then you'd be singin' along
Got bad bitches in my dressing room
I sing them something smooth just to set the mood
It's what I do
Got will and I'm killin 'em, all the women feelin' him
Me and dope the same thing, something like a synonym
Yeah, and we just turnin' up on the nightly
Fresh up off a tour, got more checks than Nike
Started from the bottom, but that isn't what I'm carin' about
Goin up's the One Direction, I ain't talkin Harry Styles

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Listen man, never judge a girl by her Instagram
Model chick came from Philly, fly on every level
Wants to settle down, but she won't ever settle, no
Uh, so I took her on a date or two
Mistakes, yeah I made a few
But being unavailable is more or less the cost, boo
Tend to misplace things, I'm sorry if I lost you
And I'm not sure what my plan is
Now I'm killin' shit yeah, Aaron Hernandez
Rockin' shows in cities I've never stepped foot in
Doin' what they said I couldn't
What's good

[Intro/Outro]
[Hook]

Uhyuuup!
