[Verse 1]
I found three pills in my kitchen
Two bitches want one I got zero problems
If we got 'em, then I'm here to solve 'em
I'm feeling honest, fuck your feelings sorry
No ceilings on it, it's inspiring how I feel this morning
Man I'm so wavy that everybody that come around feel nauseous
Sun coming up, no one give a fuck, everybody still partying
Different day, different stage, shit the same, still ballin'
Man that sound awesome, don't it?
And I hit the J then hit the stage then watch them hands go up like auctions
I'm not who they think I am
They tryna crop me out the pic but this ain't Instagram
But that makes sense, I never really ever fit the squares
And they ain't never gonna find a box they can fit me in, ah no

[Hook]
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions

[Verse 2]
I'm pretty good at things that I shouldn't be
Only reason they ain't here is cause they couldn't be
And please believe my vision clear, they just couldn't see
I've been doing me
Talking on these records like it's you and me
Yeah, I've been taking shots cause my faded thoughts are my favorite ones
And my view is high, it ain't suicide but it'll make you jump
Can't tell me shit like I'm celibate, I don't give a fuck
And the answer's yes, I am up next and there ain't no discussion
Cause I didn't change, I just grew
Can't say the same shit for you
I do not wait, I just do
Cause sometimes when you stop to think before you move you lose
That's the truth, yeah

[Hook]
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions

[Bridge]
Why is everything that's wrong feel so right?
So I'mma ride this wave I'm on for one more night

[Hook]
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions
I'm pretty good at bad decisions

[Bridge]
Why is everything that's wrong feel so right?
So I'mma ride this wave I'm on for one more night
