[Hook: Rich Young]
See I'm back again
I got class again
Man I miss my friends
We gon' do it again

It's been a hell of a summer
It's been a hell of a summer

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Unpack the car
Throw it in your room
Cause your roommate's home too
And then you're playing 'Rut
Shoo (shoo)
Man I thought I'd never say it
But, class starts soon
And I ain't even complainin'
Bar side partying, shots of Bacardi and
Got a cutie hangin' on the kid like a Cardigan
I been sick, I threw up, and I blew up(I blew up)
As time flies, I never grew up, so
(heh heh)
I try and tell 'em Ima do it
Teacher said music wasn't worth pursuin'
But believe me, I'm doing both, getting greedy
Cause life is a bitch and a slut
It's easy

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Back to school back to school Mr. Madison
Lights, camera, actionin'
Drinkin' and we're packin' lips
Sorry Mama, I'm working on my future though
Meanwhile I party hard, like I won the Superbowl
Class by the day, rowdy in the evening
Got a ground too, because I'm outtie every weekend
Havin' a good time in every place I'm landin'
Every town, every city, every campus
Real talk, if I said it then I'm doin' it
Hold up, let me get the cup like the Bruins did
Cheers with a smile, love is what you get
Cause if you're living for the now, there's nothing to regret

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Huey Mack]
Aah, I'm back for that sophomore slump
I'm back to doing what I want
This summer was kinda cool
But I've been waiting for this year to come
They taking shots at me, I'm just taking shots of some rum
I know this shit will be fun, cause all the homies are back here
Facing bottles, we raging harder than last year
I got a new fake, they won't know I'm nineteen
Katy Perry shit, baby, this is just a Teenage Dream
And I'm about to pass all my class with flying colors
Or just get some nice double D's underneath the covers
But either way, I guess you can call it passin'
I'm back smashin' these women, and partying with a passion
