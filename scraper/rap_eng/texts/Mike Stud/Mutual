[Verse 1: Huey Mack]
Too faded off of the Bombay
Drinking it straight because I love the taste
I'd pour out some liquor for all the careers that I'm stealing, but that'd be a waste
Fuck all that hate
Still getting paid, out my suitcase while I move state to state
All of these rappers like Chucky, they all make me chuckle
I swear that it's so Child's Play
Yeah, copped me a crib way out there in L.A
Two thousand miles away
Bro you so local and I'm on a plane
Can't even hear the shit you got to say
Still throwing shade
Fuck it, I'll dig you a grave
Just copped a benz, that's a rapper clich√©
Never putting my foot up on the brakes
Cause I came to this motherfucker to stay

[Hook: Huey Mack]
You don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, that's cool
That's cool, yeah that's cool
She wanna fuck with me, I wanna fuck her too, that's cool
That's cool, yeah that's cool (that's cool)
Bitch you know that it's mutual
So mutual
Bitch you, bitch you know that it's mutual
So mutual

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
You throwing shade from my shadow
But that don't make sense to me, dog
You ain't offending me, dog
You cannot get to me
That's black and white like a referee dog, like
Hold up, I got this
Let me get something off my conscience
I don't give a fuck, I promise (x2)
My women hot and my vodka chilled
Never cuff 'em but trust me, I cop a feel
Got a spot way, way up, on top the hill
Up late talking life like I'm Dr. Phil
I got a plot to kill, plus I got the skill
And I can't say the same for you
Cause nowadays other people mistake fake for cool
But just cause you want it, that don't make it true
Now ain't that the truth

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Huey Mack]
You don't like me, well that's cool
I know way too many people who do
But that's mutual, you one of the few
I think you just mad that I don't fuck with you
Look, I made a name off of rap, that's why they mad
Oh that's your girl? She got back
She want to fuck me, I know
Gave me a blowie cause I'm 'bout to blow, woah
I don't believe in monogamy, I'm 'bout my green like a cup of tea
She say she loving me
I took her back to the telly
We fuck in the shower, she sing like she Becky G
Same kid from a year ago, except
I'm the one that they talking 'bout
And Nick Cannon can't even try to imagine the level that we Wild 'N Out
Ow

[Hook]
