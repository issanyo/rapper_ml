[Verse]
Okay, I'm too faded take my keys, no I don't mind
I don't care about where we go
Just please don't drive me out my mind
Ahead of my time like my watch is broke
They used to hate me but now they know I am unstoppable
This is my message just please don't forget it man
Anything's possible, yeah, yeah
On a roll like a smart kid, oh man no Xans, I got bars bitch
No help, myself I start this
In the driver's seat let me park this, trust me this is our shit
And no man in a suit gonna tell me what to do or how to market
Wavy in a Uber like I'm carsick and I ain't even carsick
I just got an after party that I gotta take part in
Got this view that make your heart skip, yeah, girl I do this often
And trust me, baby, we wavy on the daily like Carson
Grounded like a carpet, baby this is arson
Cause every record I set ablaze
I got the juice, yeah that Minute Maid
I made this shit in one sitting, that's minute made
I treat the beat like my dinner plate
And we really did it and they just pretending
So we ain't just living, we celebrate
Fuck what they saying, just let 'em pray
Life is a trip so let's get away
Turn up's the same, just a different day
Just lit the J then I drift away
Got model bitches in my kitchen sniffing coke
And wishing, hoping, they gonna get the D
AHHH!
