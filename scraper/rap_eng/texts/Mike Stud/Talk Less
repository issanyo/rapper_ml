[Hook: Mike Stud]
I ain't saying I ain't crazy
I'm in Cali Rari racing with my dogs from the city
Thought we had this conversation
Talk a little bit less, so let's do more
Talk a little bit less I'm saying, so let's do more, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Some people need a filter but I don't (that's right I don't)
Their pictures got a filter but I don't, that's right I don't
I take care of biz and mind my own (my own)
And sometimes I know it's wrong but I still do it like I don't
That's right, yeah, I pick up the phone, call it how I see it
Turn up every evening, then I just repeat it
Got on Nike checks running to a meeting now (running, running)
That's right, yeah, I can do it all, feel like Willie Beamen
Manifest it all every time I speak it
I don't never talk unless I really mean it, though (like I mean it)
Oh no I cannot waste my time (no)
That shit I really can't afford (no)
Won't take no shortcuts in this life (nah)
That shit is already way too short (woo)
That's why I'm working, working, working, I'm up late as fuck (late as fuck)
And I ain't never been the kind of guy that say too much (that say too much)

[Verse 2: Vory]
And I don't like to do too much talking
Before I ever lie I tell you nothing
I really turned nothing into something
So they can go ahead with their assumptions
Yeah, yeah
Everyday suit and tie, still 'bout my business (checks, checks)
Getting cash so I gotta move different (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Cut some friends off it's still love on this end (running, running)
They wasn't good for my life, I couldn't pretend (they gotta go)
They act like they couldn't help me I was hurting
Now they all seem to need me cause it's working now (say)
Before I tell a lie I won't tell you nothing (shh)
They selling dreams but ain't selling nothing (no)
I realize this cash don't mean nothing (no)
If I can't spend it all without you
