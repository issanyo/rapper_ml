[Verse 1]
I told Foley hit the weed plug (brrr)
I been touring six months, I need a week off
Now I'm flying with my feet up, Costa Rica
With a couple mamacitas, hot as fevers, make 'em mona like the Lisa
Nice to meet you, what you need, I think I got it
Got a problem? That's ok, hey let's drink about it
Always down to go up, I don't gotta think about it
Fifty city tour is the goal, that whole thing is routed
I been putting in work, everyone in my circle grinding
Looking down at my watch and it's saying right now, that's perfect timing
Every time the ball drop, and it feel like I'm starting my favorite year
No one thought that we would make it here, nah

[Hook]

That's right I'm feeling brand new
I don't play unless I'm playing cool
That crib I got is brand new too
That's why I'm feeling brand new
That's right, I'm feeling brand new
I don't play unless I'm playing cool
That pretty thing I'm with is brand new too
That's why I'm feeling brand new

[Verse 2]

I'm addicted to this life, fuck that basic shit
Life's a trip, that's why I live like I'm vacationing
Yeah you might hit it too but I'm her favorite
Straight up take your bitch, as I please, to me it's easy as a layup (swish)
Music loud, the neighbors hate us
Weed too, man, I can't really blame it
We don't play the game, fuck the fame, it's overrated
Put one picture on the 'Gram, yeah, I can make you famous
I'm just saying, yeah
I wear my true colors every day
Had my struggles, but I'm on to better days
Out in L.A., they can tell I'm on the way
Better living, better women, higher ceilings
Fuck 'em all, that's why I'm feeling brand new

[Hook]

That's right I'm feeling brand new
I don't play unless I'm playing cool
That crib I got is brand new too
That's why I'm feeling brand new
That's right, I'm feeling brand new
I don't play unless I'm playing cool
That pretty thing I'm with is brand new too
That's why I'm feeling brand new
