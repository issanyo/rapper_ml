[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
You might catch me running through my side of town
Even though I run it when I'm not around
Say I'm acting shady 'cause I'm shining now
Pull up in that Escalade you know I'm gassed up
I keep it a hundred like my fucking dashboard
On another wave yeah we ain't in the same boat
Fake it til' you make it that's some shit I can't do
Don't tell no lies about me won't tell the truth about you
I know they believed that I would break down
They said I was crazy guess I ain't now, nah
And when I go home it ain't the same now
It ain't the same now

[Hook: Vory]
She hit my phone like she tryna get away from the city
Heard them niggas talking down they throwing shade in the city
Ain't no love ain't no love it's just hate in the city
For them niggas it just sauce we the wave in this city
She hit my phone like she tryna get away from the city
Heard them niggas talking down they throwing shade in the city
Ain't no love ain't no love it's just hate in the city
For them niggas it just sauce we the wave in this city

[Verse 2: Vory]
And the wave is enormous
A wave like tsunamis
Riding through the city looking for a Kehlani
I'm with OVO Ryan and they can't tell me nothing
'Cause I know that if I find her Imma keep her yeah
I be saucing on the daily I don't do too much talking
You need a feature hit up Austin yeah
Know that I will be the greatest
Tryna tell them to believe me
Sour faces when they see me now
These niggas dropping statements to the face
I've been tryna tell them Imma kill shit all year
I'm the wave in the city
I'm the hottest still the hottest
Back when Lou would engineer me
Now I gotta make him hear me
It's the reason I feel chained up
They treat me different guess it's changed now
When I'm in town it's not the same now
It ain't the same now

[Hook: Vory]
She hit my phone like she tryna get away from the city
Heard them niggas talking down they throwing shade in the city
Ain't no love ain't no love it's just hate in the city
For them niggas it just sauce we the wave in this city
She hit my phone like she tryna get away from the city
Heard them niggas talking down they throwing shade in the city
Ain't no love ain't no love it's just hate in the city
For them niggas it just sauce we the wave in this city
