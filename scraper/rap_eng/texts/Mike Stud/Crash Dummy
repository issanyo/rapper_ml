[Verse 1]
Yeah I made it here on no favors
Half man, half amazing
Always blazing
Eyes lower than the basement
So faded
Dan Bilzerian my neighbor
Man this shit is so crazy
All my homies been turned up for like week straight
Then she suck the dick, she need a knee brace
Then she wanna fuck me this and these days
And then she keep my undies, that's a keep sake

[Chorus]
But you can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me
You can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me

[Bridge]
If it’s cool I can fuck with that
Yeah, ooh, true, ah
Yes she’s cool I can fuck with that
Ooh, I can fuck with that

[Chorus]
But you can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me
You can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me

[Verse 2]
They don't get how I operate
I swear it always feel like Saturday
Blowin' smoke on a balcony
I’m out here but never out of place
Cause honestly I’m all about the team play
That’s why I put ’em on like a free base
That Dom Perignon and some cheesecake
And then I eat some pussy, it’s a cheap date

[Chorus]
But you can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me
You can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me

[Bridge]
If it’s cool I can fuck with that
Yeah, ooh, true, ah
Yes she’s cool I can fuck with that
Ooh, I can fuck with that

[Chorus]
But you can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me
You can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me

[Verse 3]
You grinding to shine, I'm grinding to disappear
Your spinnin' your tires and its grindin' my gears
Don’t fight for my time 'cause it’s already yours
So Pretty Woman, I’m Richard Gere, now listen here
You can’t take a second when you in first place
Told you not to text me during my work day
And you know what I meant, yeah you know I work late
That's how I'm here in the first place

[Chorus]
But you can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me
You can crash here girl, don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me

[Bridge]
If it’s cool I can fuck with that
Yeah, ooh, true, ah
Yes she’s cool I can fuck with that
Ooh, I can fuck with that

[Chorus]
But you can crash here girl don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me
You can crash here girl don't be a dummy
I told her show me
You ain’t gotta say you love me
