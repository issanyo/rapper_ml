[Hook] (x2)
I'm thinking of you, I'm thinking of you baby
And I can't help myself, I don't want nobody else
Cause I'm thinking of you

[Verse 1]
And she said "you don't kiss me like you used to"
"Barely ever talk, you don't miss me like you used to"
"Out there on the road, always partying and working"
"Now it feels different, you hardly the same person"
And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
I wasn't lying when I said I loved you
But on the real, I've been missing your touch
I just pretend you don't exist so I don't miss you as much
Cause what's the right girl, if the timing is wrong?
Went from my everything to a line in a song
Cause nothing lasts forever ever, though
If I ever get you back, I'mma never let you go
Cause I'm thinking of you

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
And lately, I've been trying to get my mind right
Sitting in the dark room, hiding from the limelight
And deepest thoughts when my sleep is lost
Getting higher than this balcony I'm peeking off
Cause lately I've been caught up in the cycle of focusing on my future
And forgetting about Michael and who I really am
And who was really there when I had nothing but a dream and an arm in a sling
I mean, you loved me for me: the way it should be
And all these other girls are just in love with who I could be
Left a good one for some badder bitches
Now I know I must've had it twisted, cause I'm thinking of you

[Hook] (x2)

[Bridge]
I'm living mine and you living yours
I hope you find what you're looking for
I'm living mine and you living yours
I hope you find what you're looking for
Cause since you left, I'm just trying to get my head right
I'm trying to get my head right
Since you left, I'm just trying to get my head right
Trying to get my head right

[Hook] (x2)
