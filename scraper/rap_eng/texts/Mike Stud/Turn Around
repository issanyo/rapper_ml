[Hook: Hendersin]
You try to stick to the ground but I keep on moving
Yes, I know what I'm choosing
You see everything's different now
Been through it, get through it, never hitting the ground
You try to stick to the ground but I keep on moving
Yes, I know I'm never losing
You see everything's different now
Been through it, get through it, never hitting the ground like

[Verse 1: Hendersin]
I'm never hitting the ground, there's no spiking
I'm heading straight to the top, I go hiking
What's in your wallet? So viking
Yeah I go ape for the cake, I guess I like the icing
Can you explain why they hate for?
Probably cause they half of me, like 8 ball
It's my time so don't you dare be late for the [?] I'm giving out
Motherfucker I make more
And that's word to a serving
A wrap when I come around the kid with a turban
No I never fell off, no I never dropped
Make you get your hands up like 12 o'clock
Last tape, yeah I detoured
Now I'm putting shit on the capital, keyboard
Fuck trash talk, head back to your landfill
I'm still standing, homie you just stand still

[Hook: Hendersin]
You try to stick to the ground but I keep on moving
Yes, I know what I'm choosing
You see everything's different now
Been through it, get through it, never hitting the ground
You try to stick to the ground but I keep on moving
Yes, I know I'm never losing
You see everything's different now
Been through it, get through it, never hitting the ground like

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Look man, everything different, it's definitely true
Cause I finally found out what I'm destined to do
Live life to the fullest, man the lesson is true
Now I'm buzzing like contestants on the Jeopardy do
Took a picture then I dicked her and she texted me too
Cause these hoes I bag well like Jeffrey do
So out in Houston I'm an Astro
All about my cash flow like Fidel Castro
I'm the shit, you're an asshole
My way or the highway, or at least find a back road
Man I'm that though, you should ask around
Turn a whole city out when I'm back in town, never backing down
Won't turn around, I'm the kid from a small town that you heard about
Man the word is out, I'm on the come-up
Roll the blunt up and raise up like the sun does

[Hook: Hendersin]
You try to stick to the ground but I keep on moving
Yes, I know what I'm choosing
You see everything's different now
Been through it, get through it, never hitting the ground
You try to stick to the ground but I keep on moving
Yes, I know I'm never losing
You see everything's different now
Been through it, get through it, never hitting the ground like
