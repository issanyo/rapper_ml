[Verse 1]
I got a hipster girl from the city
She cool as fuck, she don't really care when I'm busy
I hit her late night and she there in a jiffy
Gets an O then she hits the road
Hair in a tizzy, yeah I just call her when I'm back in town
Send a car, cut the lights, throw that ass around
That's right, who's laughing now?
I guess we both are, well at least so far
Cause we be going Mia Hamm in bed, word to Nomar

We just young and we dumb and we gettin' it
And she love when I grunt when I'm hittin' it
She scream loud, don't mention it
Now all of a sudden all the friends are buggin'
She said chill with all that, we're just young and fuckin'

[Chorus]
Uh, yeah
We're just young and fuckin'
Too fucking young for all that, we're just young and fuckin'
Fuckin', yeah
I thought you knew
Me and you? We're too fucking young, we're just young and fuckin', fuckin'
And ain't nobody perfect, ain't nobody perfect, I know, but you're perfect for me (x2)

[Verse 2]
Look
Sometimes we get dinner just because
I took her to a movie once but that was just for fun
And then she came over, well, that was just to cum
Get it?
She came over just to cum
Well I'm with that, she did that, okay there she goes
With my tank top shirt and them high heels on
Stone cold, her heart is unbreakable
Hardly chases her shots, she never gonna chase a dude
Long story short, I think I like her
Got drunk the other night and told her that I would wife her
She laughed, and said you must be buggin'
I thought you knew the deal, homeboy, we just young and fuckin'

[Chorus]
Uh, yeah, we're just young and fuckin'
Too fucking young for all that
We're just young and fuckin', fuckin'
Yeah
I thought you knew
Me and you? We're too fucking young
We're just young and fuckin', fuckin'
And ain't nobody perfect, ain't nobody perfect, I know, but you're perfect for me (x2)
