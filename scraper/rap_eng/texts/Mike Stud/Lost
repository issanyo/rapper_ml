[Verse 1]
Every day I thank God for lessons I'm learning
I know that shit made me a better person
I remember calling up to Him when I was hurting
Now looking at my life, I'm pretty sure He heard it
I'm scared of heights, but kept climbing
Scared of lights, but kept shining
See I got lost but found a mic and kept trying
And still I try, still I climb, I'm still alive (but just barely)
Pour my life into these lines and pray they hear me
Now listen clearly
I'm still so far from perfect, yeah
Hardly home, always working, hope it's worth it, yeah
But tell me why this shit's so hard
Why's it take so much longer to put it back than it did to fall apart?

[Hook]
And they say "when you gonna fall in love?"
Girl, I can't even fall asleep
I got so much on my mind
And they say "when you gonna fall in love?"
Girl, I can't even fall asleep
So why you tryna find me?
Girl, I'm just lost (x2)

[Verse 2]
I'm just lost and limelight gets uncomfortably crowded
Get judged by a bunch of people that know nothing about us
But I'm tryna turn mi casa to a castle
But on my own terms, I don't want to if I have to
Screaming "daydreams over day jobs"
Got plane rides, chasing these stage times
Either that or to stay fly
Cause on the low, I'm alone
Can't find anyone with the same vibes
Guess that explains all the FaceTimes
And I'm sorry for the confusion I cause
Sorry I'm so worried about winning, I choose to be lost
I'm sorry that I'd rather work or fuck than work on us
Cause I'm too busy searching for myself to search for love

[Hook]

[Refrain x2]
Every day I thank God for lessons I'm learning
I know that shit made me a better person
I remember calling up to Him when I was hurting
Now looking at my life, I'm pretty sure He heard it

[Outro]
If I want it then I get it, then I got it
Made a hundred first year out of college
Started out as an Internet secret
Now I'm playing on they radio speakers
And my crib overlooking these beaches
Bitch, I'm ballin'
Came from the beaches, Jesus
All I want's the best things
