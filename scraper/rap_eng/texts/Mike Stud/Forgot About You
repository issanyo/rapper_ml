[Verse 1]
Told my people and my mama I got it
Keep a promise and always keep my guard up
I need more sleep less problems
But I don't see no z's 'till I solve them
Yeah I stay woke, you stay talking that's why you stay broke
I am blowing smoke 'cause I'm really blowing smoke
Plus some (?) and my boy gotta grow
Now we flying out to Vegas just cause anything can happen
Drinking while we playing on the table with that action

[Hook]
That's where you found me, I don't need that energy around me, nah
Forgot about you don't need to remind me, to remind me
Forgot about us now I'm leaving you behind me, you behind me
Guess you ain't know know nothing about me
Used to have my back back then when no one knew me
Forgot about you don't need to remind me, to remind me

[Verse 2]
The more that I see, feel like the less that I know
I roll up the weed, and then I dim the lights low
I needed you gone to get me back in my zone
You said that we cool but what you lying for
You impossible, the way you talking
We going back and forth the same madness
Ain't no ending with you, I cut my losses
You should've known you were in the wrong by now
Had to let you go, but know that anything could happen
I ain't looking back I'm in the middle of that action

[Hook]
That's where you found me, I don't need that energy around me, nah
Forgot about you don't need to remind me, to remind me
Forgot about us now I'm leaving you behind me, you behind me
Guess you ain't know know nothing about me
Used to have my back back then when no one knew me
Forgot about you don't need to remind me, to remind me

Forgot about you don't need to remind me, to remind me
Forgot about us now I'm leaving you behind me, you behind me
Guess you ain't know know nothing about me
Used to have my back back then when no one knew me
Forgot about you don't need to remind me, to remind me

Forgot about you don't need to remind me, to remind me
Forgot about us now I'm leaving you behind me, you behind me
Guess you ain't know know nothing about me
Used to have my back back then when no one knew me
Forgot about you don't need to remind me, to remind me
