[Intro]
I just wanna celebrate (x3)
I just wanna celebrate (x3)

[Verse 1]
Every night of the week, girl we celebrating
Toast, this that shit you wanna wake up to
Like good breakfast, good texts, good head and good sexin' ah!
Yeah, and I'm just being who my momma made
No matter the time of day I promise to find a way up
And girl I do this often, make music, drink to it
It go on and on and
Rippin' the songs, they singing along to every single lyric
I could let the crowd do the show and everybody kill it
It's just me and all the homies
Walk up in the room watch it light up like a stogie
And you already know they been down from the jump
Cause it's tough to watch your back when you up in the front
Toast

[Hook]
Now it's feeling like a celebration
Every night of the week, girl we celebrating
Toast
Now it's feeling like a celebration
Every night of the week, girl we celebrating
Toast, toast, we could toast to that
Toast, toast, now let me toast to that
Toast, toast, we could toast to that
Every night of the week, girl we celebrating

[Verse 2]
Now let me keep it all in perspective
T-toast to Tommy, I already learned my lesson
And I'm just living life, I'm just-I'm just getting right
I'm just-I'm just going up and I ain't hopping on a flight, no
And I'm the realest, never been fake
Keep it 100 like my name is fuckin' Ben Frank
And shout my fam, shout my homies
Shout The Bean, shout to Rhody
Shout the haters, y'all can blow me
I'm on fi-fi-fire
But why settle when it could be more?
When you this hot, what the fuck I need a hoodie for?
Yeah, and people really can't believe this shit
Bout to blow and y'all don't even know about the TV shit
Toast

[Hook]

[Outro]
Toast, now let me toast to that
Toast, toast
Toast, now let me toast to that
Toast, toast
Toast, now let me toast to that
Toast toast
Toast, now let me toast to that
I just wanna celebrate (x3)
I just wanna celebrate (x3)
