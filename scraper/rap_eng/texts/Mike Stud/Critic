VERSE 1:
Hello (x4)
Hello to the world, thanks for tuning in
I'm in the building now, I think I'm moving in
And imma do it big, Double XL
I got the critics sick, I pray they get well (well)
Well it pays to be the bigger man
Damn, cause getting payed is in the bigger plan
All for the music, It's hard but it pays straight
Stayin hungry cause my pockets wanna gain weight
Wait, so you can call me what you want
But I'm out here in my own, doin everything I want, want
Just a story of an up and comer
Who turned his whole life around in the fuckin' summer

CHORUS:
Been working hard at this music (this music)
Been working hard everyday (everyday)
I told the world that imma do it (do it)
And I don't care what they say (say)
Nah, I don't care what they saying
Nah, nah, everybody is a critic (critic)
And I ain't really trying to hear it nah, nah
Cause everybody is a critic (critic)

VERSE 2:
And now I'm living on the road
And I just wanna ball, so I give in and I go
When I'm swerving in the lane, something german on the frame
Can't stop, won't stop, we burning up the game, mayne
I got a flat out in London, I ain't talking tires
I got a grip up on the game, I ain't holding pliers
They said we couldn't make it, they all liars
Like the statue of liberty Imma always have fire, fire
Just to prove the people wrong
They said we couldn't make it
They said that we'd be gone, gone
But we a-a-a-aren't, and this is the life for me
Yeah

CHORUS:
Been working hard at this music (this music)
Been working hard everyday (everyday)
I told the world that imma do it (do it)
And I don't care what they say (say)
Nah, I don't care what they saying
Nah, nah, everybody is a critic (critic)
And I ain't really trying to hear it nah, nah
Cause everybody is a critic (critic)
Been working hard at this music
Been working hard everyday
I told the world that imma do it
And I don't care what they say (say)
