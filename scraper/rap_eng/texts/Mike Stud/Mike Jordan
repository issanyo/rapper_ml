[Verse 1]
See I don't know where I'm going, well just not at this moment
But I'm hopelessly focused on ballin', Mike Jordan
They ain't wanna fuck with me, hated that I made it now they stuck with me
Got they favorite girly on her knees treating me like a role model
Always looking up to me
Cause I'mma be shining, they just don't get it
Look at me smiling, shoutout my dentist
Tryna get ahead like lettuce, get it?
So when I come around it's all love like tennis
But it ain't my fault now, ball in my court now causing this racket
Ain't in my bracket, same as my taxes bitch
Pretty little thing where my mattress is
Actresses, but I gotta let her go, no passengers
And I'mma get there hopefully, and knock it down like an open three

[Hook]
Then I'll be ballin', I'm ballin' I'm ballin
Fucking ballin', Mike Jordan Mike Jordan
See I don't know where I'm going, well just not at this moment
But I'm hopelessly focused on ballin', Mike Jordan
Swish

[Verse 2]
And they say "hey you, dude I don't like your attitude"
But now they do, cause I got my eyes on the green like a caddy do
Smoking weed on rooftops
Threesome thoughts homie, I could give two fucks
I'm just tryna win, I'm just goin' in
Only coming for the night, yeah go and bring a friend
And it's alright though, nothing was the same
I feel like Jerry Seinfeld cause I got a lane
And it's okay cause I'm driving in it
Try to make me sign on the line but I didn't
Cause rule number one I will not be two, I just do me I do not need you
And I'mma get there hopefully, and knock it down like an open three

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Okay, let's go
Yeah that's what your bitch say
It's Mike Stud homie, at least that's what her tits say
And underrated is an understatement, so fuck who's hating
Started all this in my mother's basement, look what I made it
Now I'm -
