[Hook]
Mmm, I ain't your type
Mmm, wake up on the same damn fights
Mmm, it ain’t that deep
Mmm, trust me don't jump
It ain't that deep

[Verse 1]
No small talk
All big convo
Need mine pronto
Chase that down like that all-white Bronco
I just want a bag she just wanna follow
Spend it all on some titties and a condo
Anybody try to text me I curve it
I ain’t even pitching but I curve it
I ain't whipping but I swerve
I just wish all these bitches gonna learn
I ain't here to talk
Bad bitch, straight up from the magazine
Savage, something that you never seen
And I go, anywhere I wanna be
Moonrocks, got me Moonwalking, Billie Jean
High class, real big baller shit
My friends, really on some baller shit
Courtside, that's the only time I'm on the bench
So close, that the coach tryna put me in

[Hook]
Mmm, I ain't your type
Mmm, wake up on the same damn fights
Mmm, it ain't that deep
Mmm, trust me don't jump
It ain’t that deep

[Verse 2]
I told you when I hit the switch it stays on
I ain’t ever switch I stay down
Everybody says I ain't the same
But the only thing I changed was the game
I ain’t really gotta skip leg day
Cause I been running shit since the tenth grade
I been running way from the fuck shit
I been running way

[Hook]
Mmm, I ain't your type
Mmm, wake up on the same damn fights
Mmm, it ain't that deep
Mmm, trust me don't jump
It ain’t that deep

[Verse 3]
Nah theres a walk over things I used to trip from
And they try to steal my drip but they always slip on it
And Imma steal your bitch, I cought a crip walking
Please get up off my dick, unless you plan to sit on it
You should never trade chemistry for curiosity
Each and everyday I try to make my momma proud of me
Used to never understand now they all on top of me
Fuck a plan b, you gon have to come and swallow me

[Hook]
Mmm, I ain't your type
Mmm, wake up on the same damn fights
Mmm, it ain't that deep
Mmm, trust me don't jump
It ain't that deep
