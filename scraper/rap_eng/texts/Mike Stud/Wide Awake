[Intro]
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Whats up

[Verse]
I feel wide awake, ain't no time to waste
Gotta find a way
Yeah I feel wide awake
I feel like I'm the only guy that's in the game
That don't do it just cause someone say
Got no time for games, this is my life
Who the fuck are you trying to play?
And if you feel the same
You know exactly what I'm trying to say
I'm ice ice cold, I got bitches on my arm
And I'm right in my zone
That's right
I'm ice ice cold like my drink is when I roll
I ain't pitching, but I'm throwed
Interstate cruising, we stay boozing
Always find a way, like I can't lose it
I never lose it
I never lose it
We out catching vibes
Man I should have been recruited
Money, Money, Phone
I can't stand this shit
Cause as soon as you ain't got it
No ones answering
Nothing that I do is for attention
So I prefer to keep it on my end

[Outro]
Okay, life's a bitch
But fuck it, I still hit
Fuck it, life's a trip
Just gotta know how to take a hit
Okay, life's a bitch
But fuck it, lets get rich
Fuck it, lets get lit
And do a whole lot of other cool shit
Uhyuuuu
