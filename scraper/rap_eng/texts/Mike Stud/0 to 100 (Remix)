Fuck being on some chill shit
I go 0 to 100 homie, real quick
Real quick, super quick
Well I'm swinging for the fences, call that Big Papi
Shit changed after Tommy boy, Chris Farley
And before that, well I thought I had it planned
But I made my own breaks, call that Tom Callahan
I'm just trying to get it, then I did it
If it's a lyric then I lived it, don't you get it?
I'm the realest, I just kept my fucking head on straight
You called me out but that's a stretch, like there's men on base
Cause it's all hustle, no luck
Shit hard, though
Up against the wall, you dropped the ball: Dick Clark, ho
Hold up
This ain't what you want to do
This ain't for fun, I ain't the one you want to run into
Watch what you say, boy
I don't play, boy
Your girl a 5, mine's in Playboy
And fuck H.A.M. I'm going Hamilton, I got 100 dimes
Try to egg me on and shit, but I don't flip, sunny side
Cause there's no point
You ain't got it like I got it
If you try to get out of pocket, I'll serve you like I'm Roddick
You don't want it, nah man you don't want it
Cause I don't think you understand the shit you started
Homie, I was your size back in kindergarten
The shit you're talking is a bit retarded cause it's garbage
Little guy, you a little target
But I got aim though, call me Pedro
And you just clogging up the game and I'm the Drano
I go 0 to 100 real fast, give you whiplash
You just mad you was picked last in gym class
You should've kept your day job
Cause I stay in my zone, Jim Boeheim
So was it worth it to quit?
It's ironic that you left Google
But you still searching for hits and shit
I ain't got one neither, that ain't the point at all
But you dropped two tapes before I made a song
Think about it
If I was on my seventh year with your career
Well shit man, then I'd be pissed off
So fuck being on some chill shit
I go 0 to 100 Hoodie, real quick
I go 0 to a C-Note
I'm Cooperstown, bitch you're more like Cupertino
You computer guy in your suit and tie
Coming at me was kinda sorta like suicide
So run Forrest, go Forrest
You fucking clown, I hope you got some more jokes for us
And after this, nobody gon' do a song with you
You should've known that I was gon' get you
And honestly, I really tried to get along with you
But like the artwork for your song, you had the wrong picture
