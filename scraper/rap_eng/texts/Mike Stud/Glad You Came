[Hook: Mike Stud]
You cast a spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me
And I decided you look well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see
You and me
I’m glad you came
I’m glad you came, oh yeah
I’m glad you came
I’m glad you, I’m glad you, I’m glad you

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Well fuck I’m glad you came girlfriend
Get your rocks off
My bedroom like a ballpark
Come and get your hot dog
Little small talk, long walk, oops your top's off
And when you're fucking him, your O’s are faker than some knock offs
Grab the popcorn, we gonna make a movie boo
I know I’m better then that other dude you're sending nudies too
But it’s whatever, I don’t label my relationships
I’m leaving for a couple months, we’ll see how good your patience is
But when I’m back you know you’re dead meat
In the bedroom I excel, my dick is like a spreadsheet
But for now she’s talking dirty via inbox
She told me she’s got strong head, I think she doing chin squats
I been hot, quit playing games, this isn’t Mario
When I text, she calls me definitely, I ain’t Carly, ho
Forget that maybe shit face it, cause in due time I’m taking you to fucking school
I’m giving you that full ride
Speaking of scholarships she’s a college chick
I’m laying on the couch getting brain, no psychologist
Sorry bitch, fuck your friends, they know why I’m visiting
You drunk dial me every night it’s only right I get it in
And I’m gonna see you soon, no sense in getting mad
Just hop up in that bath with your phone like you're Diggy's dad
And text me or call me, girl anything you need it’s on me
You sad, you lonely and definitely when you horny
Girl I’m on it, girl I’m on it, I’m the man you need
50 Shades of Grey, baby tell me what’s your fantasy
Back seat windows up, that’s the way we like to fuck
Alright, that’s they way we like to fuck

[Bridge: The Wanted]
The sun goes down the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I’m glad you came, I’m glad you

[End: Mike Stud]
You cast a spell on me

I’m glad you came, oh yeah
I’m glad you came
I’m glad you, I’m glad you, I’m glad you came
I’m glad you came oh yeah
I’m glad you came
