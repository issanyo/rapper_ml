Look, Catch me with a blonde chick
Ridin around in a blonde whip, that's yellow paint
She gives me stupid head
Now that's blonde wit (whoo)

No nonsense, guilt all up in my conscience
'Cuz anything I say she just do it like Lebron's kicks
I'm ballin' ho
Yeah, I'm ballin' like a hornet in New Orleans yo
Yeah that's right I'm supportin' them

Now with days I feel like we the best
Shout to Cali and shout to Freshletes too
'Cuz now I'm dressing on top just like a salad yeah

Got hits on deck
You should listen for real
I got these people feeling my lines
Like I am spitting my lyrics in brail

I'm on that
Just had restructure of the team
I got that upper echelon
Now there's nothing in between yeah

Shout to my lawyer he just cancelled out the contract
This calls for celebration homie where that palm at?
Now light it, gonna light that up
You can bring your girl to the show that's cool
But she might get fucked
And it might get rough

Ok now listen
Let me have your attention
This is everybody's second favorite
Duke boy, a musician (TRU!)

Yeah a 20 city tour
Got 4 mo'
This my last stop
I got my haters running out of patience like a bad doc (whoop)

Been going hard
Been putting in work like they've never seen
I'm really fucking hungry like my nickname is Katniss Everdeen
Yeah And I swear I got them upset
And let me ask you this question homie, have you had enough yet?

They say aw, He got lucky, he got money
Oh, is that so?
So I grew up in a 3 bedroom house
In a small town cause I got mad dough

Man fuck ya'll, with a limp dick
For real I find you funny
Oh this rich boy went to Duke
Man you spend your daddy's money

The way I got to Duke
Wasn't lucky or the money
I went for fuckin' free
'cuz I had the best slider in the country

Man so fuck ya'll Yeah that's right I said it
And I fuckin' meant it okay
We all know you're wrong
So admit that shit like Pettitte ho

I'm feeling lucky (feeling lucky)
I'm feeling lucky
Think they right I might be lucky (might be lucky)
When I'm in your town every single girl around

She wanna fuck me (wanna fuck me)
She may say different but listen she's lucky (lucky)
Yeah I might be lucky (lucky)
Yeah I'm feeling lucky (lucky)
