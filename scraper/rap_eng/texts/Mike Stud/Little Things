[Intro]
Your hand fits in mine
Like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind
It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with those freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved
Those crinkles by your eyes
When you smile
You never loved
Your stomach or your thighs
Those dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Bridge]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh, it's you that they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

[Verse 1]
But then you left me
Called you off the hook and you couldn’t even text me
Ugly on the inside, but fuck it you were sexy
Ice cold, guess it made sense you tried to check me
And there’s my sports reference for the track, check please
Silly ho now I’m up and gone in the city-o
Why you still at home watching every single video
"Hi there, how I’m looking?", pretty good
Get my dick sucked in every city cause you never would
Hear that? You fucked up, is it clear yet?
No more of your ridiculousness, Rob Dyrdek
A lot of things changed since you took off
Yeah, now I’m winning, you look lost
At the bar with your girlfriends they hear my song
And text me like you proud
Really? Naw really? Are you proud?
Well maybe I’ll put it in your mouth when I’m back in town
But for now
I’m with a couple white Russians
And I don’t drink Kahlua, I just like fucking
I always been a literal guy
You tell your friends you all miss me then you living a lie

[Outro]
Bitch I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me girl
I flew you to places that you’ve never been
'Til you put me down girl
Bring it bring it back (x3)
Bring it bring it back back
Bring it bring it back (x2)
Bring it back ho (x2)
Bring it bring it back
Bring it bring it bring it back
Bring it bring it back
Bring it bring it bring it back
Bring it bring it back
Bring it bring it bring it back ho
Bring it back ho (x2)
