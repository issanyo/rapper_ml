[Intro]
Yeah, spent it on her ass
I done spent all this cash on her ass, yeah
In the back yeah, ah damn, ok
I mean this shit, I never thought I would even be here to say this
And I mean it

[Verse 1]
If she would leave me for Drake, she should leave me for Drake
If it was me I would stay, but I still mean what I say
There ain't a chance I could take, if Imma share all this cake
You got things on your plate, fuck it I'll do the same
We do more than just date, put that ass on the wave
You'd do the same, yeah, you'd do the same
That's why I usually stay, that's why I usually stay
That's why I usually stay

[Pre-Hook]
Nowadays I got nothing to say, ah
Counting money like we're counting the days, ah
Spending money that I probably should save, but so what
Nowadays I got nothing to prove
It means nothing to me to be something to you
It seems, they don't really know us

[Hook]
We've been turning up in the middle of the week like a Saturday night
In the stars where I be, getting high of the lights
In the dark's where I found how to find all the light, ah
Spending every night with my demons in this fire, look 'em right in the eye
In the middle of the night where I (?)
When it all falls down (?)

[Verse 2]
And you can't say I don't deserve that blue Lamborghini
I mean Blue and 'em with me
And then Foley right behind us
And Versace right beside 'em
And then Kilmer in the Honda, sorry Steve
(?) cause I give it to my momma, I ain't sorry, I'm just honest
I'm not usually this modest
Only thing I ever follow is the commas
Bitch you know I got it
I can't brag I still hunt it
And I can't change up, I like the pitch when it's a slider
Yeah you know that I know how to
Cook it up in front of you like Benihana
I ain't go nowhere I promise
You've gotta trust the process, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Nowadays I got nothing to say, ah
Counting money like we're counting the days, ah
Spending money that I probably should save, but so what
Nowadays I got nothing to prove
It means nothing to me to be something to you
It seems, they don't really know us

We've been turning up in the middle of the week like a Saturday night
In the stars where I be, getting high of the lights
In the dark's where I found how to find all the light, ah
Spending every night with my demons in this fire, look 'em right in the eye
In the middle of the night where I (?)
When it all falls down (?)

[Outro]
And you can't say I didn't say this shit
Yeah, came up
I used to pray for what I pay for rent
Yeah, I came up
And you can't say I didn't learn this shit
Came up, came up
Yeah, came up, came up, came up, came up
