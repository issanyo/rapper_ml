[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Yeah, I said a lot would change before it all happened
People didn't believe till it all happened
Now I'm runnin' round these cities getting busy
With these women, best believe that it's all passion
Watch the doubters turn believers
Yeah, now turn me louder in their speakers
I hold out my hand with a smile
Cause these haters ain't haters
They just fans in denial
I swear, and she understand it's all love
Minor league but one pitch away from being called up
And she say she wanna come with me
But baby there's no room for company

[Hook: Mike Stud]
I live for this feeling baby
No need to feel worried about us
We out here tryna get paid
No need for us to worry bout love
Ballin' from the night until the sun is up
Party like a rockstar, double cups
Name another crew that could fuck with us
You know who leaving with, come with us
I'm a young king, this is how we roll
Living on the road, rockin' all these shows
I'm a young king, same old flow
I do it like the pros with the whole team on
I'm a young, young, young, young king (x2)

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Hollywood hills, we overlooking town
Bottle crisp with a model chick
With a crooked smile
Now, I'm sittin' and reminiscin' 'bout when I started to spittin'
And they wouldn't listen but look at me now
Yeah, work hard till the sun up
Being turned down is just apart of the come up
I know, taking these meetings, we universal
I spend my nights on the stage but do it like it's rehearsal
I swear, ex-girl on the speaker phone
Asking me when's the next time I'mma be at home
But baby you don't really don't wanna see me
Cause I fell in love with fucking these bitches that love my CD
