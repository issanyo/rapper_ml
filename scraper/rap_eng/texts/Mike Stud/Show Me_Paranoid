[Hook]
I seen two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I'm just paranoid

[Verse 1]
Lord have Murciélago, no bullshit I’m in Chicago
Line around the corner, that’s like every place that I go
Nah ho, next stop is Colorado
Getting ten now, but I remember when it was five though
And before that it was one, and before that it was none
Before that, I record that before class for fun
But boy look at me now
Your girl come with us ‘cause she’s bored like a rebound
Can’t blame her though
‘Cause Mike'll make her scream louder than a megaphone
And when I take her home, I’m a show her the truth
Now let me tell you all the things that I’m hoping to do

[Bridge]
Let me put your panties to the side
I'm a make you feel alright
I'm a give you what you need, yeah
‘Cause you remind me of something
I don't know what it is
You remind me of something
You gotta show me

[Verse 2]
Well fuck that I’m on a spring break visit
Hit PCB for some spring break bitches
But only for the weekend, gotta fly for an event
Going Florida to Boston, like I’m Mr. Revis
No don’t be hating baby, I don’t need that
She go to Arizona so you know she want the D-back
You should see the girls that I’m fucking with
Fuck a bucket list, I got a fuck-it list
Bitch I’m on some other shit
Making easy money like scholarships
New whip, blacked out like a college chick
So pump me that liquor a little bit quicker
And make sure that it’s strong, come on

[Bridge 2]
‘Cause I'm paranoid, I'm trippin'
Been smoking and sippin'
Tryna fuck around with two bitches
‘Bout to take ya’ll home and get this
‘Cause I'm paranoid, I'm trippin'
Been smoking and sippin'
Tryna fuck right now, turnt up right now, let’s get this
Let’s get it, yeah

[Bridge 3]
Cause you remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See your face whenever I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
That’s why you gotta show me

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, get your hands up high
Uh, Louis Bell on the track, whattup though
It’s Mike Stud homie
