[Hook]
No matter what I say or what I do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
And even when I'm gone, I'll be right by your side 'till 3005
Hold up (x6)

[Verse 1]
Dear Mama, wish you were here Mama
You the best woman in the world, that's how I feel Mama
I'm a world traveler, I know I'm always gone now
Out here on my own now, just tryna make you so proud
I hope you are, just like you hope I make it
Just know that taking care of you's my biggest motivation
You made me everything I am and gave me everything I needed
See I don't say this enough, but I hope you know how much you mean to me
I love you

[Hook]
