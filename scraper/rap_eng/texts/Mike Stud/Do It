[Intro]
(Do it for the fam)
Do it, do it, do it (Do it for the fam)
Do it, do it, do it (Do it for the fam)
Do it, do it, do it (Do it for the fam)


[Hook]
Yeah, do it for the fam
Do it for the fam (Do it, do it, do it)
Do it 'cause I can
Even when I can't
Everything I do, I do it for the fam (Do it, do it, do it)
Everything I do
Do it for the fam
Even when I can't (Do it, do it, do it)
Yeah, I am just a man but I got a plan
Now I'm on a mission
When I talk they listen
Everything I do

[Post-Hook]
Lightspeed's the speed limit
Got a new V with the keys in it
Got a lot of room, put my G's in it
It's not just me, nah we did it
Everything I do
Everything I do

[Verse]
Okay, ain't no I in team
But there's definitely in me
I only learn from what I see, yeah
Not what they speak
And if they ain't up to speed
They ain't ridin' with me
And I know they been doubtin' me
Well in time they will see
That I'm just different
Pay attention
When I talk they listen
I got a vision, I'm committed
Now to go and get it
'Cause I'ma ride or die
If I fail to fly
I'ma live where I decide
And gotta tell them why
'Cause you learn more from falling
Then watching your step
If there's more words in silence
I'm holding my breath
You can have the attention
I want due respect, yeah
I'm not holding my breath

[Hook]
Ooh, do it for the fam
Do it for the fam
Do it 'cause I can
Even when I can't
Everything I do, I do it for the fam
Everything I do, yeah
Do it for the fam
Even when I can't
Yeah, I am just a man but I got a plan, yeah
Now I'm on a mission
When I talk they listen, yeah
Everything I do

[Bridge]
I do it for you
Don't worry 'bout it
Yeah I got you, yeah
I'd do anything I got to, yeah
Anytime they got a problem
They know I got 'em
Don't worry 'bout it
Yeah I got you, yeah
I'd do anything I got to, yeah
'Cause they don't really want no problems, no

[Outro]
You learn more from falling than watching your step
