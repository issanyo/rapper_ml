[Verse 1]
I’ll do anything to have you back, since you left I'm a mess
My whole life is fucking out of whack, I’ll do anything to feel your touch
Haven't seen or talked in months but fuck I'm still in love
I'm not ashamed or scared of wanting change, I can't get you off my brain
Every time I hear your name I cry and I die a little bit inside
Go somewhere and hide cause all the blame is mine
I'm fine, not I'm not I lied I miss you everyday
I remember kissing your lips like it was yesterday
And you were here but now your gone
And I know we can't speak but I pray you hear this song
Come on...

[Hook]
Cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'm only asking for one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But please god give me one more night
Just one more night

[Verse 2]
I’ll do anything to hold you, we were supposed to grow older
Now it's all over and what was it all over
A stupid argument and a fucking cold shoulder
Too stubborn to apologize, so I told you to leave
And you listened and you went on a ride
And little did I know that be the last time
That I look into your sad eyes, God
And not a day goes by I don't think of you
And when I close my eyes all I see is you
I can't believe that you're gone
And I know we can't speak but I pray you hear this song
Come on...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I called and called to tell you to come back
Waited around but never got one back
I was upset but went to bed it was late and all
A couple hour later I got a wake up call
It was your mom, she was crying
I sat up in my bed dead silent
She said you drove off the road
And all that they know is that you were reaching for the phone

[Hook]
