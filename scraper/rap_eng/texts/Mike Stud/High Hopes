[Verse 1]
Captain of the ship
Captain in my Coke
If the ship's going down
Then I'm going with the boat
And I stay down when it's going up in smoke
That's what I call high hopes
Fuck the sheep I'm the goat
I'm the G you the Joe
On her knees on a boat
Fuck her deep in the throat
In the Jeep blowing smoke
You peak in high school I peak as I go
Look, I don't give a fuck about the who's who
If you wasn't with me from the jump I gotta lose you
Bitch, excuse you
Guess she got a couple screws loose
But I eat her in the morning like some fucking Froot Loops
Yeah, then I gotta work
Call you when I get off
Promise you gon' get off
Promise you gon' get all
Give me that brain like get out then go and get on

[Hook]
Slow down
Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast, slow down
Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast
Slow down, whoa now

[Verse 2]
I got a chick from Texas her nickname Florida
Cause she love the Marlins and she fucked like four of 'em
Yeah, and if they make that trade she been hoping for
I'm pretty sure she gon' fuck a couple more of 'em
I'm a Steve so, where's my accordion
I'm in the studio recording shit til the morning hits
And by the time the morning ends I'll be mourning then
Cause I just made a couple songs and killed every one of them
At 21 I'm pretty sure that I was born again
I bought a one way ticked to the show and now I'm boarding it
I'm Scott Disick, got bitches I'm the lord of them
And I'm pretty busy but I'll call you when I'm bored again
Yeah, cause I'm starting to have fun now
I'm relaxed, wrote this in the bath like run's house
But it's my house
Blow the whistle that's a timeout

[Hook]
Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast, slow down
Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast
Slow down, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast, slow down
Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast, slow down
Girl you moving too fast
Slow down, slow down
