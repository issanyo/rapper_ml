[Verse 1]
She got Versace on her body
She like it better on the floor
She started getting too comfy
She need directions to the door
Yeah, yeah, yeah probably
She'll be coming back for more
My momma ain't raised no boy
Bitch I'm far from it
It's no stretch boy I've been running

[Hook]
Centerfold, what's the issue
Drinking out the bottle that's a big mood
They don't wanna hear me talk like this
They don't wanna hear me talk my shit
They don't know what we've been through
Drinking out the bottle that's a big mood
They don't wanna hear me talk like this
They don't wanna hear me talk my shit

[Verse 2]
My bucket-list turned to accomplishments
I stay true to all the dudes that I started with
They been looking out like monoculus
New watch just to let 'em know what time it is
Not sorry 'bout shit I'm the opposite
She got sick of all ya'll I got that doctor dick
'Cause I got patience
I always let her come first
She ain't got a job but that tongue work

[Hook]
Centerfold, what's the issue
Drinking out the bottle that's a big mood
They don't wanna hear me talk like this
They don't wanna hear me talk my shit
They don't know what we've been through
Drinking out the bottle that's a big mood
They don't wanna hear me talk like this
They don't wanna hear me talk my shit

[Verse 3]
In and out of the trap with the speeding boats
I write my own shit I don't believe in ghosts
'Til I seen a ghost
You can't see me but you see me though
Got (?) on the car like a Beastie Boy
Believe me boy
This shit is easy though
When I say shit
The basis is need to know
Nowadays I know everyone I need to know

[Hook]
Centerfold, what's the issue
Drinking out the bottle that's a big mood
They don't wanna hear me talk like this
They don't wanna hear me talk my shit
They don't know what we've been through
Drinking out the bottle that's a big mood
They don't wanna hear me talk like this
They don't wanna hear me talk my shit

[Outro]
She got Versace on her body
She like it better on the floor
She started getting too comfy
She need directions to the door
