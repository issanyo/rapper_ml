[Intro]
Peeking out the blinds
Fuck 'em
Let em tell you something 'bout it

[Verse 1]
I got friends, she got friends too
We should all get together do what friends do
I got friends, she got friends too
Get my Jordan's from the Jordans that's a man's move
Jeffrey tatted YNK so they sent two
Then I buy a couple more 'cause that's what friends do
I came up and brought the homies, yeah they been true
They're the only fuckers that know what I've been through
Win or lose we did it right cause that's what friends do
Cause that's what friends do

[Hook]
Real friends, real friends, yeah I'm talking bout some real friends

[Verse 2]
Lost people that ain't lost, that ain't dead, that ain't gone
They right here, like right there, got the same face, but it ain't there
With a blank stare, I thank God, I take off, I take mine
I take a loss with a grain of salt, a tequila shot, never take the lime
What I need and want is some back rubs, some fat blunts for the whole squad
Cold beer, no cares, no cars, just boats dog, I'm ghost dog
That's goals dog
'Cause fuck sake, fuck this place, Hollywood update
Most of the guys ya'll praising either faking or they cupcakes
On the Gram they got it all worked out but in real life they in tough shape
That's a tough break, lot of good nights, lot of rough days
Hit the gym a lot, but her butt's fake, haha

[Bridge]
Mama called, said remember why you started
Pops taught me, when shit get hard to just go harder
All the things I used to want I went and got 'em
Starting to think that I was better off without 'em
Mama called, said remember why you started yeah
Pops taught me, when shit get hard to just go harder
Yeah, all the things I used to want I went and got 'em
Yeah, what I got is all I got, at least I got em yeah

[Hook]
Real friends, real friends, yeah I'm talking bout some real friends
Real friends, yeah I'm talking bout some real friends

[Outro]
I got friends, she got friends too
