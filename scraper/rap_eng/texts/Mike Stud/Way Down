[Verse 1]
I go to sleep when they wakin' up
I go to work while they takin' lunch
I'm in the lab when they in the club
They havin' fun I could give a fuck
I see the stories they makin' up
My guess is they didn't make enough
Most of these people mistakin' us
Bitch I could take a punch
T Swift I shake it off
She said I make all her favorite song
She love the numb but she hate the drugs
We don't just fuck girl we makin' love
That dress impressive but take it off
She work on the runway now she takin' off, oh
Just tryin' to be better than the day before, oh
I gotta keep going, yeah

[Hook]
Swear it never looked so good
Swear it never looked so good
Til you on your way down
Your way down, yeah
I swear it never felt so good
Swear it never felt so good
Til you on your way down
Your way down, ohh

[Verse 2]
I been going through some family shit
It hurts more when you can't be home
I told 'em I got 'em, no they ain't alone
I went vacant for a while
Been too busy fakin' smiles
So forgive me if I haven't been in the mood to make a song
But Marissa just listen though, I won't be there for you
I'll be right here for you
Askin' bout shit that I don't have the answers to
All I can do is love you like no man can do
Spending my nights in a daze
Maybe it's cause I'm afraid
I don't care bout the game I just make my own plays
Ain't it funny you get to the money and that's when they change up
And fuck all the fame, yeah
I just divide it up equal
With all of my people
I balled in another field this is my city, whoa

[Chorus]
Swear it never looked so good
Swear it never looked so good
Til you on your way down
Your way down, yeah
I swear it never felt so good
Swear it never felt so good
Til you on your way down
Your way down, ohh
