[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
I'm staring at my MacBook, I got them digital dreams
Cause we all want material things
And I, got a flow you don't typically see
Clever, lyrically with the syllable schemes
And it seems, this is what I'm destined to be
Cause now, I'm the dude that they're spending to see
Gee, look at me kicking it into high gear
Now I got more buzz than light year
And you heard me I said it
And if I'm wrong, I'll admit it like Pettitte
Get it? Flow sick I need a medic
And I deserve a little credit like debit
Life's a gamble, so I bet it
I gotta keep shooting for the goal like Redick
And if I were to die this second
I won't regret shit when I get to heaven

[Hook]
I want everything
(I want it all)
In this life
I want everything
(Uh huh)
In this life
I want

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Mike Stud, they're saying I'm the best out
People following me like I'm the best route
I'm running this shit, didn't even stretch out
Always go the right way so I'm never left out
Yeah, and I'm gonna be a legend
It's not where I'm at homie, it's where I'm headed
You never really know when shit's gonna change up
Traveling with the microphone ain't the same bruh
All-American to the injured reserve
Really a tough break that I didn't deserve
But fuck it, I'm in DC now, doing me now, look at me now
Bouncing back like a rebound
(Yeah) Now I'm back in the headlines
Dreaming big bitch, but it ain't bedtime
Nah homie this my reality
Close to the bigs, Triple A, no battery

[Hook]

[Between Verse Banter]
"Loggy, Aye, What's good homie?"
"Not much man I'm chillin, you good?"
"Uh huh"
In this life
East to the west, let's go
I want

[Verse 3: Loggy]
Now I keep staring at my MacBook, digital dreams
And me and Mike can we define what you think physical means? (Yeah)
Couple have given up, a few more couldn't take it
It's tough to love your life when you're too wasted to embrace it
And I learned to come to terms with all my victories and losses
Kept my story clean with all that Listerine and flosses (Come on)
I guess it's necessary to discuss
The fact I never dreamed of doing this when growing up
And never have your dreams turn from platinum to gold
I just knew that big things came from back in the shows
I worked hard, don't love it, fuck it, who does?
You can say I’m occupied because I don’t have a job
As I sit here and think, I'm feeling the heat
From the coastline, gold shine hitting my cheek
And in no time, oh my, everything's green
I'm allowed to just relax and think of simpler things
And yeah, I'm happy here and this is kind of neat
Cause it's my job to steer, I'm in the driver's seat
And every worry in the world just seems to stay away
I got a single life to live and I'm not gonna waste a day

[Hook]
