[Intro: Mike Stud]
21, 21 sadness
21, 21 sadness
21, 21
(Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Why it gotta be like this?
Why it always gotta be OD like this?
Why it gotta feel like that?
Why it always end up being on me like that?
Why you gotta push my buttons?
Why you gotta pull me down?
It feel like I'm waitin' on somethin'
That might not come around, but
She say "Don't wait up for me"
Imma stay, but i wanna leave
Lotta things that I wanna say that i just can't

[Chorus: Goody Grace]
That's 21 sadness, 21 sadness
She's stuck in 21 sadness, 21 sadness
Oh she, she got a big ego
Gotta fake a smile everywhere that she go
That's 21 sadness, 21 sadness

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Don't lose yourself just to get discovered
They can't be themselves, yeah they undercover
You don't need a substance to ever find your sustenance
You knew Lady Luck was not the one you wanna fuck wit
Now you always in the function
You can barely function
Sippin' shot of Comfort
Tryna find some comfort
Now you drunk and stumblin'
Just, lookin' for somethin' to fall in love with, quick

[Chorus: Goody Grace]
That's 21 sadness, 21 sadness
She's stuck in 21 sadness, 21 sadness
Oh she, she got a big ego
Gotta fake a smile everywhere that she go
That's 21 sadness, 21 sadness

[Bridge: Mike Stud]
(Yeah)
This place is a ghost town
Crowded room filled with lonely people
Ghost town, aww yeah (uh)
This place is a ghost town (uh)
Crowded room filled with lonely people
Crowded room filled with lonely people

[Chorus: Goody Grace]
That's 21 sadness, 21 sadness
She's stuck in 21 sadness, 21 sadness
Oh she, she got a big ego
Gotta fake a smile everywhere that she go
That's 21 sadness, 21 sadness
