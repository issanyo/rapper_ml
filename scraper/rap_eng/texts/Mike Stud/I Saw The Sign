[Verse 1: Hendersin]
I belong on the top floor, something like a high rise
Entourage with me, like four about five guys
Girl by my side and she steady sippin' Mai Tais
Homegirls linkin' up later, yeah we call 'em Wi-Fis
Uh, and that's the life that I'm hopin' for
Foot through the door but I just need it to open more
Lights, camera, I found my direction
I'm workin' on my dream cause I'm down with Inception
They play my sweet 16s, MTV
I'm shootin' for the stars like TMZ
So I'm lockin' it down, that enforcement feel
'Till I'm sellin' out shows like endorsement deals
And I will never lose, no lost and found
And I'mma make it work, I like bossin' it around
The writing's on the wall, well they never been so bright
Never blinded by the fame so my dream is still in sight 'cuz...

[Hook: Missy Modell]:
I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
I know I'm goin' to the top
And I ain't ever gonna stop, whoa
I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong...
But where do you belong?

[Verse 2: Kinetics]
Kinetics in ya headphones...
Yeah, I belong in a packed show
Or in a studio chillin' where the plaques go
I could spit an underground, pop, or electro bar
I'm always one to turn styles -- Metrocard
Ooh, this life I live is a medicine
Handin' a handle of Hennessy over to Hendersin
Homie got a nice bud givin' me that nice buzz
While I'm gettin' tipsy with Ms. Missy and Mike Stud
Makin' the tracks sell 'till the money sacs swell
I ain't stoppin' 'till the last bell
'Till every hottie that you spot me with has got a body like a model
Like Missy Modell's last name without the last L
But if honey is hesitant of performers
I just signed a pub deal, maybe I should "warn her"
Yeah, 'cuz I belong in a bigger dream
Kinetics & One Love, hash tag, winning team

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]:
I belong at the club table, sittin, takin' jack shots
Homies in the backdrop, people takin' snapshots
This is for the haters sittin' home on their laptops
Keep ringin' the bell, I'm hittin' the jackpot
And it's a given, never been so sure
I'm driven, never been chauffeured
Dammit, flow cold like Michigan
Outstandin,' no I'm not fittin in
I'm tuned in, got everybody listenin'
So I'm steady on the road like Michelin
No tires, but it's been a Goodyear
Flow fire, something that ya should hear
Yeah, no gimmick, I am something real
I just hit the stage and I balled, Uncle Phil
Ha, now I'm headed for the primetime
So I'm ridin' West, yes, like Lebron's mom

[Hook]
