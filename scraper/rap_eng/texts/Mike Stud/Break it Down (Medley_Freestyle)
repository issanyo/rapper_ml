[Intro]
Let me show you how I break it down, oh baby
Let me show you how I break it down, uhyup
Wassup, wassup, man, Sunday Stud Day freestyle edition
The Mike Stud way
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Alright, okay
Bout to shut it down on Sunday
And I'm fresh to death, I belong on a runway
So throw me that ball, I thrive on this especially
Talkin' 'bout some sex with me, damn right I got athletic D
So lights out, don't strike out, like I'm Mike Trout
I be killing it on the daily, work hard, never lazy
But I ain't really ballin' though, closest thing I got to 30 rocks is Alec Baldwin though

[Hook]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me, smoke an L in the back of the Benzie
Oh, why do I feel this way?
Cause all I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I don't give a fuck, my excuse is that I'm young
Cause I'm on one
Still got my money
Cause I'm on one
Damn right, I still got my money

[Verse 2]
Let me start this shit off with something I had to say
Remixed Nelly "Ride Wit Me", shoutout Connor Cadaret
He requested that, yes in fact
Freestyle, I'm the best with that
Made a lot of money and invested that
So throw me that ball
Let me get a little warmed up, like some foreplay
But when I go all the way, I keep it wrapped up like Chipotle
And this like four in the morning
Stay tuned, coming soon is some brand new Touring's Boring
So

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let me show you how I break it down, oh baby
Let me show you how I break it down, yup yup
