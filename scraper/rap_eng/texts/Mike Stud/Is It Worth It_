[Pre-Hook]
I been so worried about tomorrow
I forgot to think about today
And it seems I'm always going through all this trouble
Just so I can tell myself it's OK

[Hook]
Cause I ain't worried, I been broke
I ain't perfect
But no one else is
So I stay searching
For the reason I been putting all this work in
And is it working?
Is it worth it? (oh)

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Sure I made a couple dollars last week
Yeah, I got a couple hollers in the streets, sweet
But for me this whole thing's a little shaky
Cause a lot of people love me, but some others fucking hate me
Shit is crazy, feeling wavy
Kissing babies, fucking ladies
Stations play me
But will any of these labels ever take me? (Maybe)
So is it really worth it?
Cause I'd be lying if I told you everything was perfect
I'm not the best, probably not close
But I know a lot of kids that relate to my flows
So eff you to whoever say I don't deserve it
I put the work in
So is it worth it?

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
And "everything happens for a reason" is the message
The good times are blessings, the bad ones are lessons
I choose to live free at the cost of a bad impression
Cause sleeping till noon and drinking booze is adolescence, right?
So this life seems to be a piece of cake
But it's tough to be sure when living on a leap of faith
Wait, just wait, this'll only take a minute
Before you jump to hate, take a moment and just listen
I said no to Harvard to follow a dream
Went to Duke first year and was the star of the team
Big man on the quad before this scar on my arm
Went from bench to the stage, look how far that it's gone
And sometimes I kinda miss my old life
But being on stage just feels so right
Yearbook closed, I'm on to the next chapter
Don't know what's gonna happen
But I'll worry 'bout it after
