[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm tryna get high
Sometimes the view is just right
Sometimes I drink to get by
Sometimes the booze makes us fight
Sometimes I don't wanna be found
I'd rather get lost with you

[Hook]
Sometimes I get in my car
Drive nowhere fast
No rear-view mirror around here
I don't wanna look back
No it ain't safe
But nothing means much when it is
No it ain't safe
But nothing means much when it is
So let's have some fun while we're here

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get in my car
I don't know where I'm going but I'm gonna go far
Sometimes I get in my car
Put a little Kenny on and sing straight from the heart
Sometimes I get in my car
And I get right out too drunk from the bar
Too drunk from the bar
But how good is anything
If you can't share it with you're friends
It's like everything
Is better when it is
And I'm holding on to what I know best
Yeah I'm holding on to what I got left
And I'm staring down the bottle
And the message at the bottom
Saying if it ain't there
The next one will I promise
I remember the time
I love hanging with you
But it's better with wine
I remember the time
When me and you couldn't put together a dime
And really wouldn't spend shit but our time
And we were just fine
When the going was tough
I am who I am I just hope it's enough
You got the cards in your hand
But I'm calling your bluff
And when it all falls down
Know I'm gonna pick up

[Hook]
Sometimes I get in my car
Drive nowhere fast
No rear-view mirror around here
I don't wanna look back
No it ain't safe
But nothing means much when it is
No it ain't safe
But nothing means much when it is
So let's have some fun while we're here
