[Verse 1: Huey Mack]
This for all of my dreamers, all my non-believers
Finally on the court, I got my ass up off of the bleachers
Never had a coach, I watched from the stands
But I got heart boy
I'm like that motherfucking Tin Man
Started out with a dream, I knew Mike since the beginning
Now they about to see us winning, front row at the Grammys sitting
Forget your deal, forget your label
Got fans on my side
From West Virginia to fucking worldwide

[Hook: Huey Mack]
I'm saying tonight is gonna be the night where everything is coming alive
I don't need all of the lies, just you here by my side
I don't need all of the fame, this was never supposed to happen to me
Don't know where all this gonna lead
But everything will be alright

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
This go out to my momma, this go out to my dad
Always made the best of whatever we had
And he ain't even have a father, he left him alone
And he became the man he is today all on his own
And I respect that, still by me through it all, I swear I won't forget that
No, I can't forget that, no
Now I am becoming everything I wish I would be
And I'm the living proof that it can happen if you believe

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mike Stud]
So tell me what you see, and about everything I've seen
When you take a look at me, and about who I said I'd be
They don't know about us, about us, about us
Been everywhere between hell & back
They don't know about us, about us, about us
And if you hating baby, we gonna tell them that everything will be alright

["Be Alright" portion of Hook]
