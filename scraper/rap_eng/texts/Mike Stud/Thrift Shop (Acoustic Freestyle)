I'm gonna pop some tags, only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up, this is fucking awesome
From the window, to the wall, got haters all on my balls
But tell me what you're mad at me for
Talk a lot of shit when you behind that keyboard
No major label, I don't need no PR
Look at Kilmer killin' it on that old ass guitar
I grew up right where my feet are
Kill the beat, what I need no beat for
I do this shit everywhere that I go, killin' the mic, showin' the world what I know
I freestyle, I ain't lying boy
I don't cheat, homie I ain't Ryan Braun
I'm gonna pop some tags, only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up, this is fucking awesome
I said I'm gonna pop some tags, only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up, this is fucking awesome
