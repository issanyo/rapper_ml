[Intro: Dan Deacon]
Who's this guy? Mr. Balloons... Mr. Balloon Hands

[Verse 1]
I got cities to see, I got parties to throw
I'm getting closer, started over now I'm starting to blow
And I got plenty of women sitting in my condominium
You can kick it for a minute bitch but you're only visiting
I got people to meet, I got places to go
I'm just living, watch me get it, I ain't taking it slow
And now that radio started playing me so
Oh, what a feeling, made a million
Took a minute bitch but now I'm in the building goin' up
I'm goin' up, hey (x3)

[Hook]
I got all my liquor poured up way before we showed up
Bitch, I'm going up
They had all my liquor poured up way before we showed up
Bitch, we're going up

[Verse 2]
I got money to make, I got deals on the line
Clothing shit, that touring shit, bitch I'm already on
Yeah I'm up next, believe that, said that shit then I mean that
Now I'm up in the hills, fuck how you feel
She got a man but I'm fucking her still
I'm on, ho
Made a killing off of living how I wanted
Just a kid in the beginning
Sitting in front of the television wishing to be on it
Now I'm on it, shutting it down
Work through the night so they fuck with the sound
Bobbin' and weavin', I'm hardly asleep
And the bitches go out when we come to they town
Tonight was just lovely, both my pickups for 20
One's a junior who studies, the other one was the money
And I'm gone, speeding around and I'm swervin'
Fuckin' puttin' that work in, now I'm seeing the curtains goin' up
I'm goin' up (x3)

[Hook]

[Outro: Dan Deacon]
Who's this guy? Mr. Balloons... Mr. Balloon Hands. Drinking out of cups. Being a bitch
