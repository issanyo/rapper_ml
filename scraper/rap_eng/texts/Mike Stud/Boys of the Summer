[Hook]
We the boys of the summer
Roll the windows down when we in your town
You know we the boys of the summer
Everybody know us, everybody show love
You know we the boys of the summer
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Boys of the summer
Everybody know us, everybody show love

[Verse 1]
Okay, we on a roll like Michelin
Sun-Sun's out but I'm cold like Michigan
And everybody listening, music you can feel though
No-no tires, but it's been a good year though
And I'm for real though, everybody know us now
40 city tour, I'mma go out and shut down
So let's get it in though, smoking out the window
Whole family with me, got me feeling like a Winslow
Cause we ain't getting any younger
One more time for the boys of the summer
So we living like tonight is the night
Come with us and have the time of your life

[Hook]
We the boys of the summer
Roll the windows down when we in your town
You know we the boys of the summer
Everybody know us, everybody show love
You know we the boys of the summer
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boys of the summer
Everybody know us, everybody show love
You know we the boys of the summer

[Verse 2]
And we gon' party to this song
Life's short so my drink tall, yeah let's get gone
Cause we always got a place to go
Left lane where success came, never take it slow
I'm just tryna live, so they follow like we know the way
Pretty girls sliding through the crib like a stolen base
And it go on and on, until they had enough
And after that, you know the deal baby: batter up
Cause we ain't getting any younger
One more time for the boys of the summer
So we living like tonight is the night
Come with us and have the time of your life

[Hook]
We the boys of the summer
Roll the windows down when we in your town
You know we the boys of the summer
Everybody know us, everybody show love
You know we the boys of the summer
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boys of the summer
Everybody know us, everybody show love
You know, you know

[Bridge]
Take those tits out for the boys, tits out for the boys
For the boys of the summer, for the boys of the summer
I said take those tits out for the boys, tits out for the boys, for the boys of the summer
We the boys of the summer

[Hook]
We the boys of the summer
Roll the windows down when we in your town
You know we the boys of the summer
