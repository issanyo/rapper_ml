[Intro]
Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make your ass fall off
And I think I wanna smash 'em all
Speed up, gas pedal (x3)
Speed up, gas pedal (x4)
Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make your ass fall off
I wanna smash 'em all
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal (x6)
I wanna smash through all the time, it's always on my mind
It's always on my mind
Speed up, gas pedal

[Verse 1]
November 3rd, time to celebrate
Now here's a power move that I'm tryna generate
Just got a spot in Maui for a private getaway
Doing anything I can for a Kendall Jenner date
But if not then it's on to the next, don't be mad at me
She's the one that's missing out on that Athletic D
So fuck all this acting, I just keep it 100 like Aroldis Chapman
Went from baseball to Batman, I'm kinda the shit
And you just a bat boy so I'm robbing your chick
Cause I ain't got time for a joker, okay, see you later nice to know ya
And my mom think I drink too much, she's probably right
Should probably get my shit together, but not tonight
I'm on the 6th floor drinking a fifth at the Four Seasons
With two bad bitches, and this their first threesome
They just hit me up on Twitter, acting trashy and I think I'm gonna litter
And she like to call me Splinter
Cause the only place she ever wants my wood to be is in her
Alright, okay, y'all recess but I don't play, no way
And she bout to go to work for the night, bend it over now twerk it for Mike

[Bridge]
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal (x8)

[Outro]
Jump on it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
Jump on it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
Jump on it, grab the wall, my saddle's waiting
