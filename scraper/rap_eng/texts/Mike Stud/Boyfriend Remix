[Verse 1]
No girl, got yours for the weekend, though
Your girl taken, call Liam Neeson, bro
Spring season, mini-skirt sequins flow
I got her leakin' and I ain't even beatin', though
Easy ho, balcony views, some Pinot Grigio
Now take it to the floor and play the piccolo
Now we having a good time, so you can be my girl, but only for the night
Now listen

[Hook]
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
I can't be your boyfriend, I thought I'd let you know
That we can have some fun to tonight, but then I got to go
So you can find a better man out there on your own
Cause if I was your boyfriend, I know I'd do you wrong
I know I'd do you wrong

[Verse 2]
Let's make a video and put it on the internet
Good head, girl, I call it intellect
Best you ever had and I ain't even finished yet
Do you so good even the neighbors need a cigarette
Call me Deion, the way I put the D on
Take you to the bed, the bath, and beyond
Then I need to be gone, I got a flight to be on
But, I never told you different
Girl listen

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You got a prince, not a king, I'm a duvet
'Bout to move in on the queen like I'm playing chess
Yes, tell me what you want to do to me
Come in the room with me, cutting like a movie scene
Yeah, you got a man? I'm chilling
My heart's got ED, it's no hard feelings
And, let me take you where you want to go
And, this is something that you got to know

[Hook]
