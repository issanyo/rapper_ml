Yeah, what, yeah

[Hook]
I ain't mad at it, I ain't mad at it
I ain't mad at you
I ain't mad at it, I ain't mad at it
I ain't mad at you
I ain't mad at it
She got her fucking hands on me
I ain't mad at it
I ain't mad at it
But we could do it right here if you had a minute

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I ain't get the issue girl, is you in it
We on something different if you didn't get it
If you pay attention I might pay the difference
Switch to presidential fuck the incidentals
And the whip's tinted, ah, you can't see me in it, ah
Always damn authentic, I can't have no critics, ah
Got no roof, no ceiling, I can handle business
Yeah, I can handle mine, yeah

[Hook]
I ain't mad at it
She got her fucking hands on me
I ain't mad at it
I ain't mad at it, I ain't mad at it
You ain't saying nothing, oh no
I ain't mad at it, I ain't mad at it
Started playing had to cut it off
I ain't mad at it, I ain't mad

[Verse 2]
Oh you got it, bust it open, I ain't mad
Oh you got it, well I'm open for the pass
Need the rock 'cause you know I gotta ball
Never run away, unless I'm on the job
All I do is win, I am who I am
I cannot pretend
I got m's, don't know where it ends
With it wet in pen, I could spin
I just let it flow, now I'm on a wave
And I got no more to say, I just wave
Slow down, oh now

[Hook]
I ain't mad at it, I ain't mad at it
I ain't mad at you
I ain't mad at it, I ain't mad at it
I ain't mad at you
I ain't mad at it
She got her fucking hands on me
I ain't mad at it
I ain't mad at it
But we could do it right here if you had a minute
