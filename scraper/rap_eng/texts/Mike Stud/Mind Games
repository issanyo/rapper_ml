[Chorus]
Hi bitch
White chicks
Wylin' at my crib
Sun up, sun down
Night in, night out
I'ma call play like a timeout
I'ma go long like a wideout
Ay, yeah
You was playing games so I'm playing with you mind now

[Verse 1]
Watch out, timeout
Don't let me find out (find out)
Think I might need me a timeout (yeah)
Gotta think of me this time round, yeah
If life give you lemons, I just add vodka
The weather is heaven and so is this pasta (this shit fantastic)
My outlook is almost as fresh as this lobster (this shit is very fresh)
Yeah, eating in the backroom, feelin' like a motherfucking mobster (yeah)
Yeah, leaving out the back door, lookin' like a motherfucking mobster (yeah)
Yeah, I been drinking all week excuse me gotta gimme something stronger (yeah)
Yeah, lines are getting long and the deals getting shorter 'cause the money getting longer (yeah)
Got em' sick 'cause they ran outta patience and I brought 'em to the doctor, ah

[Bridge]
They still telling me to chill out
Peel out, I hop in then I peel out, ay
Wheel out, breasts out, riding round Hollywood topless
But these days we straight
But she go both ways, don't she

[Verse 2]
And we go straight to the house (yeah)
And that weed go straight to the face and it's loud
And we ain't turnin' shit down (yeah)
Be there or be square or you won't be around
That fuck shit won't be allowed (nah!)
So don't poke around; I don't wanna be found
Got paid, got lost
Got dome on the couch, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Hi bitch
White chicks
Wylin' at my crib
Sun up, sun down
Night in, night out
I'ma call play like a timeout
I'ma go long like a wideout
Ay
You was playing games so I'm playing with you mind now

[Outro]
Mind games, mind games
Mind games (mind games)
I ain't into games but I'm playin' like it's mine now, ooh
Mind games (mind games)
I ain't into games but I'm playin' like it's mine now, ooh
Mind games
