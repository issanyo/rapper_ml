[Verse 1]
I cannot do no wrong
I cannot do no wrong
Yeah I've been up in the gym, but I do not flex much
Only take a shot if it's the best one
I don't ever treat it like a test run
I swear my heart racin' like F1 I'm on the way up
Try from the view
Ridin' round, ridin' round the hill
With a model with designer on her heels
She got molly and and a water and it got her in the feels
Yeah it got her in the feels
At the party in the hills, now she gotta keep it real
Hasn't talked to her father in a while and her momma on the pills
Now she tryna find herself

[Hook]
On the balcony with my people smokin' weed right now
Overlookin' Hollywood, yeah yeah we prolly should
I told 'em look around girl you're livin' in a dream right now
Overlookin' Hollywood, yeah yeah we prolly should
I've been in the gym so long
I cannot do no wrong
I've been in the gym so long
I cannot do no wrong
On the balcony with my people smokin' weed right now
Overlookin' Hollywood, yeah yeah we prolly should

[Verse 2]
Oh you the man? Start actin' like it
If you don't believe in magic then you ain't ever gonna find it
Now I'm on the up and up yeah I feel like I'm on autopilot
Bad bitch from the centerfold
You bring her out but I bring her home
Don't play with her, like my drink I keep it straight with her
Yeah I'm on the way up
Now I'm in the hills like LC
Now there ain't shit that they could tell me
Now I'm in the vehicle feelin' healthy
Now I'm helpin' people that help me
I promise I'm not in my feels
Don't talk 'bout people no only ideas
That bullshit ain't payin' my bills
All I see are M's I ain't taking no L's

[Hook]
On the balcony with my people smokin' weed right now
Overlookin' Hollywood, yeah yeah we prolly should
I told 'em look around girl you're livin' in a dream right now
Overlookin' Hollywood, yeah yeah we prolly should
I've been in the gym so long
I cannot do no wrong
I've been in the gym so long
I cannot do no wrong
On the balcony with my people smokin' weed right now
Overlookin' Hollywood, yeah yeah we prolly should

[Outro]
I've been in the gym so long
I cannot do no wrong
I've been in the gym so long
I cannot do no wrong
On the balcony with my people smokin' weed right now
Overlookin' Hollywood, yeah yeah we prolly should
