Uh, walk up in the spot with the crew
Ooh, yeah girl you're hot who are you

Flashy ass nigga with the Range I'm a dealer
Loaded in the club

Going A-T with my Oakland side killas
Bad yellow bitch fucking with a nigga
Shawty faded then I pass it to my nigga
We keep it rolling keep it rolling like a track team

Long legs, outfit super
I'm thinking of head and I ain't talking bout the future
Uh, team Husky you lucky

I hit it hard from the back she need State Farm
