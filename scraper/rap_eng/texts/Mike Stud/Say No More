[Verse 1]
I'm on a carpet, I feel like Aladdin
My girl is a rocket, I call her my Jasmine
Okay, well I'm sorry I'm spazzin
While I'm at it, I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
But I am for real
I'm takin' the wheel, fuck all of this traffic
Watch how I pass it
I'll quarterback it, I'm Jared Goff and
I'll share the profit with all of my partners
Fuck all of the nonsense, I'm bout my business
And they burn the bridges, and wonder why nobody visits
But I am too busy just livin' to listen

[Pre-hook]
Okay
I woke up this mornin', poured some Captain Morgan
I put on my rollie, but I don't watch my portions
Scrollin' through my email, and I see nothin' important
So I roll over and do it, doggie style, tongue out like Jordan

[Hook]
I like memories, we should make some more
I like money too, guess we'll make some more
And if that ain't your vibe, homie say no more
If I'm runnin out of time, I'ma make some more

[Pre-Verse]
Hollywood'll eat ya up for breakfast
I don't give a fuck about a guest list
I don't give a fuck about a skeptic
I don't give a fuck about acceptance
How's your omelet? Bitch I'm lit at breakfast
I don't give a fuck if it is reckless
Then I catch the morning Sportscenter to check up on how all my friends been

[Verse 2]
Cause most nights I feel like I need a drink
Don't ask me how much, or I plead the fifth
Just keep it Franklin like Aretha did
My life is not peaceful, but I am at peace with it
I just assess all the damages
As they yappin in front of these cameras
All this alcoholism and cannibis
But trust me they have their advantages

We ain't got time for amateurs
Rip off all the bandages
Think they had a hand in this
But they can never handle this
And when you're in my section little bit of ratchet, whole lot of passion
Whole lot of bad bitches
I ain't interactin', I ain't into actin'

[Pre-hook]
Here's a 101, I'm on a 101, I'm doin' 101 with you baby
You the one I want, no matter what I'm on
I'll put it all off for you baby
Put it all off for you baby
I might check that Cartier
Put it all off for you baby
Wrote that all off for you baby
Let's go!

[Hook]
I like memories, we should make some more
I like money too, guess we'll make some more
And if that ain't your vibe, homie say no more
If I'm runnin out of time, I'ma make some more

Zoom!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a plane, flyin over your crib, yeah
I'm on a wave, right behind where my crib at
Cause I'm at the point in my life where nothin' is private
Just know when Iâ€™m quiet, nothin' is quiet
Cause the headboard bangin' on my neighbor's wall
But I hope the 5 0 do not get called
Cause I don't fuck with noise complaints at all
And if we get one more they gon' kick us out, out
Yeah, yeah
It's goin' down, yeah

[Hook]
I like memories, we should make some more
I like money too, guess we'll make some more
And if that ain't your vibe, homie say no more
If I'm runnin out of time, I'ma make some more
