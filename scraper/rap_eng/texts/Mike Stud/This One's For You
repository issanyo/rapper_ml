[Hook]
This one's for the homies, this one's for the girl back home
And when it's time to go, I say this one's for the road
So this one's for you, this one's for you
This one's for you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got a couple girlies on the way over
Had 'em stay waiting for me like a layover
And we gon' go hard 'till the lights on
Taking shots to the face, Mike Tyson
Going all night long
We just wanna do what we like
If that's wrong, then we don't wanna be right
Plus you know I gotta take care of the homies
Just like I'm taking blame, everything is on me
And we down for whatever, tryna make a night to remember
So tell me what you wanna do and I'll be coming through, let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Last night was a movie, we gon' make a sequel
You should come with us, let me show you how we do
Turn up for the evening, we gon' have fun tonight
Everybody on one tonight
Like lights, camera, action: splash of Coke but the jack's strong
If you want it baby, ask for it, cause I got you
It's all right by me, cause you work all week for the nights like these
And we down for whatever, tryna make a night to remember
So tell me what you wanna do and I'll be coming through, let's go

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And everybody's tryna come through
Cause they just wanna do it like we do
So put on our favorite song, cause this one's for you
Riding round the city with the top down
Keep it going, ain't no way that we gon' stop now
Cause we are all we got now
So this one's for you
And we down for whatever, tryna make a night to remember
So tell me what you wanna do and I'll be coming through, let's go

[Hook]
