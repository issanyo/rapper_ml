[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Okay, doing it my own way
You can't stop me, nah no way, Jose
Canseco, I don't play though
Either way I'm on your mind like a halo, hey yo
I shake hands and I take chances
On the girls that smoke tree, that's high standards
Got 'em like god damn it, I'm out here killin' it
You don't like me, then I don't like your opinion
But I'm focused baby
Lamar Odom, I've been on some dope shit lately
And I'm hoping maybe the world agree
On fire to the third degree

[Hook: Mike Stud]
I've been up two days straight, it's whatever
And I don't care who is saying whatever, it's whatever
Just me and my people
If you ain't with it then we don't need you man, it's whatever
Man, it's whatever

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
They say that green can cause mistakes
Same dude, stay with Blue like I'm Boise State
Yeah my boys is straight and if you hate you need to listen
I'm from RI, a family guy, like Peter Griffin (ooh)
Yeah, from soul searching to sold out
Not me, I mean these shows and these hoes down
Always a full house, I'm buzzin' heavy
Lady killer like I'm Uncle Jesse
I'm fucking ready for the Olsen Twins, or the closest thing
And I bet I get them wetter than the ocean is
But I'm focusing on just living life
They say I'm with the wrong crowd, but we getting right

[Hook: Mike Stud]

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
The bearer of bad news, screaming out "cash rules"
This shit's for life like wives and bad tattoos
And when we light L's, gotta pass you
Ask you, on some black eyes like I'm Raccoon
Meathead, charcuterie, ruin beats
Got so much ass on tour, they tried to neuter me
Getting busy like I'm Iovine
Clear up your eyes, tough guys, I'm dropping Visine here
Sammy and Stud baby, ha - what's up ladies?
I don't usually - nah, can't front lately
Y'all see us, fireworks, no 4th of July
But when you bring your girl to shows, see it in her eyes
I'm the bomb, no hundreds but a hundred
Why these dudes rap on tracks? They're so redundant
Dumb shit
Blue Devil and a Bantam linked up to serve the whole world a new anthem
