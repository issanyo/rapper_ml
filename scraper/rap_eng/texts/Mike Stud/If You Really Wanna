[Verse 1]
I can take it easy if life isn't, uh
Roll the dice with it
Especially when I'm over my limit
Yep girl yeah I'd hit it
You was talking, ragging in the bathroom
You was doing hair in the bathroom
You was getting crazy with your best friends
You girl need to learn your lesson
Need a girl with way less followers
Need a girl with way more tolerance
Need a girl with way more patience, yeah
Need a girl that's okay waiting, uh

I'm getting my money, yeah I'm getting my dollars right

And she gon' cum tonight, she gon' cum tonight

I could take her back to my spot, if I really wanna
Made it right in front of your eyes, Benihana

She don't understand, out here how I'm getting my paper
Til she look around, up down, up down in amazement
She know I'm a G and can't be replaced
This for the G's so I can't be playing

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Fuck her friend so she couldn't get more
I ain't scared to die like I did it before
All my homies are kicking down the door
That type of loyalty you couldn't ignore

[Hook]
Made it right in front of your eyes, Benihana
I could take her back to my spot, if I really wanna
Made it right in front of your eyes, Benihana
I could take her back to my spot, if I really wanna
