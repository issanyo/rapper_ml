[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Rather be the bad guy than that guy
You ain't gotta ask why
And every time I try to talk you say the same shit as last time
Told you that last time
Can't talk, gotta pack now
I hit the road, every single show is packed out
Like who's got the last laugh now?
But there ain't much to laugh about
We on the same page, yeah
We on the same page
Gave you all I can and you never gave thanks
So much on my plate how do I stay in shape?
No one knows
I said, I said

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Stud]
Don't come through my crib with bad vibes
Told you all this shit late last night
That I can't fuck with you any longer
We both know this the last thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
I just hope that it isn't over
Now you got me drinking and smoking
Liquor all up in my soda
Crib that overlookin' the water
I keep you on your toes
I keep you diligent, yeah
I drink a fifth of whiskey, now I'm feelin' it, eh
I think it's time to tell you how it really is, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Stud]
Don't come through my crib with bad vibes
Told you all this shit late last night
That I can't fuck with you any longer
We both know this the last thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
Got a crib way up where the hills at
Got a bitch walking 'round the crib, where her heels at?
And she ain't really eat
So she in the kitchen trying find where the pills at
I just keep it real
I'm in Hollywood on some movie shit, yeah I'm on the real
Call a bitch over yeah, I'm tryin' to chill
For real, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Mike Stud]
Now you calling all on my phone
But I don't answer, you're on your own
Please don't call my friends like you cool
Cause when you had the chance you ain't tell the truth
Now I don't fuck with you

[Chorus]
Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh
