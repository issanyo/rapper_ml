[Verse 1]
Yea girl, you thought I couldn't tell
Yea girl, I know you all to well
I know I'm on your mind
That's whats up, bottom line
I'm in touch, everytime
You get yours, I get mine
It's been a long week
And even longer weekend
So put it all on me
Girl fuck me like you mean it
It's been a long week
And even longer weekend
I think we both know what we need
Yea we both know what we need

[Hook]
I, I, I, I, I been down I know
I been down been up been there been scared before
I, I, I, I, I been down I know
I been down been up been there been scared before

[Chorus]
I know you think about me when you close your eyes
I know you think about me when you on your drive
I know you think about me late night
I know you think about me late night

[Verse 2]
Imma be honest
You worth more than anything in my wallet
If you want it, I got it
It's cool, it's no biggie, no Christopher Wallace
Let's fuck up some commas
If I'm gonna spend it then its on my girlie
I ain't got no worries
If it ain't about us then it doesn't concern me
I know you hate it when I'm out on the road
But you know I gotta do that
Even though shit can get out of control
You got that shit that I need
Cause I been turning down turning up for you
Now I'm out of town turning up without you

[Chorus]
I know you think about me when you close your eyes
I know you think about me when you on your drive
I know you think about me late night
I know you think about me late night

Get yo ass, get yo ass, get yo ass back to bed
Get yo ass, get yo ass, get yo ass back to bed
Get yo ass, get yo ass, get yo ass back to bed
Get yo ass, get yo ass to bed

[Verse 3]
I haven't driven in years, she still drives me crazy
If I gotta switch in a different gear, I do that for my baby
Even if I don't got the time, you know that I make it
We love that wakey-wakey eggs and bakey she cook for me naked
She like 5'10, model chick, always with her friends
Out mobbin, runnin shit, my bed's where she ends up
Riding, on a stick, love the way she drive me crazy
(Watermelon, baseball, apple pie, Disney Land)
She drive me crazy

[Chorus]
I know you think about me when you close your eyes
I know you think about me when you on your drive
I know you think about me late night
I know you think about me late night
