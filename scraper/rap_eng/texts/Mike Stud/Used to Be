[Verse 1]
Yeah, Sherman Avenue
Playing ball, we would kill it there
Yeah, I miss it there
Ain't been back since June, man it's been a year
Hit Expressions on the East just to get a pair
Yeah, and Friday nights that was Thayer Street
Bring my homies up from Duke, they would stay the week
Yeah, and all the sudden now I'm headed for these magazine covers
But never will I ever forget when I wasn't
I miss my old girl, fuck your new dude
But if you had to choose, what would you do?
Forget feelings, left those back at home
Ain't got time for that emotional petty shit on the road
Since I took a leap of faith, I've been living in another world
My only make-up sex is with the cover girls
And even though a lot of things changed, just know the real me still remain
Hand to God, for real

[Hook]
I just wanna let you know, I can't come home tomorrow
This is what I wrote
Yeah I hope that you all remember me for the dude I used to be
For the dude I used to be

[Verse 2]
My whole family out in Spain, I wish I could've made it
Had a lot to do, ain't got time for no vacation
Fan base waitin', claimin' I'mma make it
Finished up the tape, thank y'all for your patience
Late nights, day time we running to meetings
New phone, friends lost and numbers deleted
And know it's love, and I wish I could show it
Interviews about where I'm from, cause they know where I'm going
It's kind of funny how a few words turn into fucking
Nowadays it's nuttin' more cause I've already done it
And nothing hurt more than heartbreak, when the start great
Thinking it's love, and learning it wasn't
And good girls come few and far between
Some nights I do it just to do it, I'm not sure what that mean
Just a little caught up in the game
But know the real me still remain
Hand to God, for real
