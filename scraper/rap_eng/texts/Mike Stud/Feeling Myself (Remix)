[Intro: Sample from Scarface]
Hey, fuck you, man. Who put this thing together? Me, that's who! Who do I trust? Me!

[Hook: Tdot Illdude]
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Fuck no I ain't wrong, ah

[Verse 1: Tdot Illdude]
All I'm really worried about is success
You already know I've been on that
Niggas hating on me cause their bitch on me
But it ain't my fault your bitch on me
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
If you was me you'd be screaming "thank you lord"
She feeling me too, is she wrong?
We coming up cause we done held it down for so long, ahhh
Feeling myself, feeling myself
I relate to the villains cause I was a villain myself
I relate to the hustle cause I was a dealer myself
We started from nothing and that's why I'm feeling myself

[Hook: Tdot Illdude]
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Fuck no I ain't wrong, ah

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
I can forgive, I can't forget
Most of these people don't put in the work
And still want the respect
And that don't make no sense to a person like moi
No I can not stop
She said "I'm feeling myself"
So I said, can I watch?
Damn it, I, I
I'm taken for granted, I'm taken for granted
Instead of just waiting around though, I'm taking advantage
Painting my canvas, me and my campers
Up in the mansion, making up plans and handle finances
That's for the family, people that hate us just don't understand us
Dear Lord, thank you Jesus
I'm on million dollar calls daily, like I'm Regis
I'm in my car dashin' like I'm Yeezus
I'm speeding and curbing the lights
I don't got the time, I can't write that up
So I don't pay them no mind, god damn

[Hook: Tdot Illdude]
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Feeling myself, am I wrong?
Fuck no I ain't wrong, ah
