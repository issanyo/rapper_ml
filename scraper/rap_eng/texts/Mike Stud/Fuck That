[Hook]
They told me feel what you say
And say what you feel
Being fake up in these songs
That was never the deal
So fuck that
Motherfucker fuck that
And I never been afraid of something in my way
So if all you got is hate
Well all I gotta say is fuck that
Motherfucker fuck that
And all that bullshit

[Verse 1]
Gimme the mic, I hold it tight in my hands
Spittin' it right, livin' the life, it's only right that I am
I know that
And I'm glad you feel it
Old habits die hard, bitch ask Bruce Willis
Cause see, this is my life
I'm just doing what I got to
And everybody from your hometown is tryin' to knock you
Fuck that, I ain't even tryin' to hear it
All I make is party music, you should listen to the lyrics, motherfucker
What's success without the struggle
Everything change when you start to get your buzz up
Talk behind your back with everybody and they mother
But she should know not to judge a book by its cover
But none of this is news
Same people speculatin' and all about how I went to Duke
Truth hurts, bitch
You've been talkin' shit your whole fucking life
All I need is two verses

[Hook]
They told me feel what you say
And say what you feel
Being fake up in these songs
That was never the deal
So fuck that
Motherfucker fuck that
And I never been afraid of something in my way
So if all you got is hate
Well all I gotta say is fuck that
Motherfucker fuck that

[Verse 2]
Well fuck it I'mma be real
These other dudes are borin' me
Feelin' fantastic, there should be like four of me
Made a couple hundred, well that was just reportedly
Got a lot of women so I spread them out accordingly
These comparisons are made too often
Tryin' to run the game, they just Christopher Walken
Started makin' music in my friend's apartment
Now I'm gettin' bigger and bigger like Kelly Clarkson
I beg your pardon, oopsie daisy
Went to get the Range, but the coupe was crazy
So they had to hate it
Same people shake your hand are fuckin' mad you made it
But look, that's why your middle finger close to your ring
Cause it's either love or hate and there ain't no inbetween
Nah mean?
No rest on the road to success
Cause the pain of hard work hurt less than regret

[Hook x2]
