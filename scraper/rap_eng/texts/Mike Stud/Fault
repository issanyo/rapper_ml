[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
I got this drink in my hand
I know I stick to my plan, to a fault
I know you think that I haven't
Ever been where you've been
It's not your fault
I got this picture of you, it goes wherever I go in my wallet
And when I pick up the phone
I sit and stare at your number but I don't call it
You're so on girl, you so wavy
You so gone girl, you so crazy
Went and got your new Mercedes
Shell Top shoes girl you're so 80s
I'm just trying to win
They said it wouldn't work and you sided with them
I ain't sign up for this but I'd sign it again
Cause I don't wanna let it end up this way

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Sneaking out your window
And I'm smoking out mine
Even after all we've been through I'm just fine
Said you had to get away
How we let it get away
Said a lot we can't erase
But please don't wait til it's too late
Everything I say you know it all was true
And everything I did you know was all for you
I'm just trying to win
They said it wouldn't work and you sided with them
I ain't sign up for this but I'd sign it again
Cause I don't wanna let it end up this way
