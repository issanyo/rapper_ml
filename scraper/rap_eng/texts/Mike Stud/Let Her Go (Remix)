[Chorus]
You only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Woah-oh, Woah-oh
Only know you've been high when you feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
You only know you love her when you let her go
But you let her go

[Verse 1]
Look, see I remember when I met you as a sophomore
Started out as friends but I knew that we would want more
Hit your favorite restaurant, with your favorite dress on
That's one of my favorite memories that I've kept on the road with me
I know it's crazy how things change so quick
Went from rock bottom to all this fame and shit
But look, I couldn't love you but I wished I could
Cause I got hurt and closed you off, and you understood
But look, yeah, that's just blood on the leaves
The champagne tastes worse when it wasn't for free
That's why these thirsty bitches didn't come here with me
Move along girl, there's nothing to see
And what a blessing every second is, missed calls and messages
I miss the nights when you would call, just checkin' in
The girl I love, I ain't seen her in months
That's just the cost of being up in the front
And yeah, we used to say this world was ours together
Yeah, the pain fades away but the scar's forever
And fate hurts but remember the hope
Cause things change but the memories don't

[Chorus]
You only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Woah-oh, Woah-oh
Only know you've been high when you feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
You only know you love her when you let her go
But you let her go

[Bridge]
My bitches, my bitches
My bitches, my bitches
My bitches, my bitches
My bitches, my bitches
When I'm out here on the road, it's just me and my bitches
Shit is all I know, just me and my bitches
But girl trust me, this is how it's gotta be
When I close my eyes, you're the one that I see cause -

[Chorus]
You only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Woah-oh, Woah-oh
Only know you've been high when you feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
You only know you love her when you let her go
But you let her go
