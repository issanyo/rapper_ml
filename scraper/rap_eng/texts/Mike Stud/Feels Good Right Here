[Verse 1]
Windows down
You feel the cool breeze
Care free, baby girl, this a new me
I'm feelin' fly like Mike, I'm the 2 3
Quarterback the team, I'm Drew Brees, ooo wee
Lookin' cold even though the sun is out
Boy shut it down every time he come around
Look I'm young and in charge, drunk at the bar
I'm down to earth even when my head is stuck in the stars
Yeah, now we twistin' off Corona tops, drink like it's our last
Even though we both know it's not
Growing up they told me life's not fair
Old enough to understand but young enough to not care

[Hook]
Lookin' out my window
Where the hell are we goin'
But I don't think I wanna know
Long as all ya'll comin'
It feels good right here (x2)
So roll the windows down
Got all ya'll around
That always hold me down
Feels good right here

[Verse 2]
Now there's a lot that I wish you could know
Cause what you get to see in me is what I choose to show
Was down for a little, felt just like a quitter
Crying in my dorm room like a bitch, I still remember
Sometimes you gotta pick up what you got and move along
Cause it ain't giving up, that's simply moving on
Cause shit can get hard when you're trying to make the right move
Sometimes you gotta slow down to catch the nice views
On stage, crowd lookin' like team spirit
Forget dancin', everybody just scream' lyrics
And that's the illest when they come from the heart
Same dude, same team that it was from the start

[Hook]

Now we get caught up sometimes
We get caught up sometimes
That's just how life go
We get caught up sometimes (x2)
But I'm feelin' like feels good right here
Yeah, it feels good right here
So roll the windows down
Got all ya'll around
That always hold me down
Feels good right here

[Hook]
