[Verse 1]
If I want it then I get it, then I got it
Made a hundred first year out of college
Started out as an Internet secret
Now I'm playing on they radio speakers
And my crib overlooking these beaches
Bitch, I'm ballin'
Came from the beaches, Jesus
All I want's the best things
Best smoke and the best drinks
My silk sheets slippery as fuck and every night a wet dream
Cause I'm up next for the success, give a fuck less
What you talking about me though?
Singing to your bitch, call me Bobby Valentino
And I ain't never quittin', cause I ain't Tarantino

[Hook]
And a lot of people talking, but ain't nobody saying nothing
(Na, na, na, na)
Yeah, a lot of people talking, but ain't nobody saying nothing
(Na, na, na, na)
Yeah I'm out my mind, well I'm out your league
I ain't got time, unless you on my team
Cause a lot of people talking, but ain't nobody saying nothing
(Na, na, na, na)
You ain't talkin' bout nada (x5)
Put that on my mama, you ain't talkin' bout nada

[Verse 2]
Nada bro, nada bro
Don't care so I gotta go
Got a foreign in my bedroom
So rare, long hair like a Navajo
She just tryna get it, I said me too
Oh your friend came? Well, meet Blue
Just be cool cause there's camera crews in every room
Tryna film everything that we do, ooh
If they're hatin' that's cool, fuck all them
Prayin' that I fall like autumn
And now we at the bar straight ballin'
Cause the drinks taste better when ya bought em
I’m so-I’m so-I'm so awesome
Spitting like I’m still up in the dugout
Was at the bottom of the pile then I dug out
Just me and my team, I got all I need

[Hook]
