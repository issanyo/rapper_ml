[Hook]
I did it the right way all on my own
No matter what they say I follow my goals
It won’t be easy but please believe me
..lieve me please believe me
I did it the right way all on my own
No matter what they say I follow my goals
It won’t be easy but please believe me
..lieve me please believe me

[Verse 1]
It’s for the kid in the corner dribbling the ball
While they walk each morning tired yawning
First he went to class then head in to work
After that he’d hit the courts till he sweating his shirt
Had below averaged height but he didn’t give a fuck
He would work every night till they turned off the lights
Going through the drills practicing his skills
Wasn’t the most talented but had it in his will
Growing up a lot of kids made fun of him
Cause smoking weed and hitting party wasn’t fun to him
Well since then man a lot of things changed
Star of the team turned into a big name
Every big school in the country wanted him
Same girls that made fun of him were in love with him
Had a press conference at the end of the season
They asked how he did it he said I never stopped dreamin
I'mma never stop dreamin

[Verse 2]
Look it’s for the girl on the pole swinging on the pole
Getting naked and dancing around just for dough
Sound like a whore but is really a lot more
Than short skirts strange men and all these locked doors
She was smart and had a warm heart
And more than anything in the world she loved art
Had a mom who did drugs step daddy got drunk
Who come up in her room late at night and feel her up
And as soon as she had enough and ran away new city new start
Night turned into day and made money in the dark
Striped for a living a lot of time had to close her eyes
While she did it just to stick to the mission
Two years passed she had enough to start new
A dream came true she was heading to art school
Walk into class the first night and never felt so alive in her whole life
Man she never stopped dreamin
I'mma never stop dreamin

[Hook x3 ]

I'mma never stop Dreamin...
