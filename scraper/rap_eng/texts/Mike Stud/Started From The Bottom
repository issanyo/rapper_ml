[Verse 1]
Gravel road on an island, who knows where I'm headed?
Hope the driver do I've got a dinner date at seven
Landed, then I planned it, then I cancelled, cause I can
And I don't care about no deal, and no advances, I'm a cancer
I just ball ho, yeah I balled ho
Got a show up in your city and they all go
I'm on stage, front row? Yeah, it's all hoes
You in the crowd blending in like fucking Waldo, awe no
That make you mad don't it?
Got a couple bad bitches at my spot looking at my dick trying to go half on it
Get a beat, then I spazz on it
Got these hoes touching me like a motherfucking sad moment
I just want it all, but really can you blame me?
Got my lawyer on retainer cause these labels trying to play me
You can't see behind the scenes, but it's getting kind of crazy
Did a show in Cincinnati, did you see me signing babies?

[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here

[Verse 2]
Skip dinner, I'm just trying to get my buzz right
Holding hands with this money, fuck a love life
But I got hoes in every city
And really so does Blue, cause he's always fucking with me
Got a girl from back home, she just hope I don't forget her
CEO the team, but I'm working like an intern
Yeah, three racks in my jeans, that's Andre
I really do it, you just fake it like Beyonce
And I'mma spend it like I had to
If I was you, and you were me, well fuck it I'd be mad to

[Hook]

[Bridge]
No new friends, homie we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explaining
Story stays the same I never changed it
No new friends, homie we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame

[Hook]
