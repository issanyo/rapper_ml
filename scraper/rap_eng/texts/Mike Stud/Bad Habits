[Intro: Kinetics & Mike Stud]
Drop it (x8)
Bad habits
Drop it (x8)
Yeah, it's Mike Stud and Kinetics
One Love on the track, let's go
We got another one

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Uh huh, look
It's always you I call when the party's ended
Told you what you want even when I hardly meant it
Cause most the time's I'm wrong, at least I'm startin' to admit it
Life's a game and it's on, I'mma make the pieces fit in
Call it Tetris, it's all connected
Like it or not you won't forget this, now check this
See this is me, same dude, different tendencies
Drinking like a Kennedy
Rather be hated than loved for something I pretend to be
It's all relative ain't it
Cause when you think about us, it's all negative ain't it
Told you to do what you wanted to
Fuckin' with these other dudes that we both know that I'm better than, baby
But look—
Now this is my apology
Wasn't my choice
I'm just being who I gotta be
And this is over, no more calls for help
I can't lead you down the road when I'm lost myself

[Hook: Kinetics]
Cause I'm walking away, walking away
From bad habits, bad habits
And every time I try to clear my mind
There's a voice inside and it's so loud
And you look so good
But those looks could kill
And I ain't tryin' to be a man down
But I ain't come around here to stay the night
I'd just thought I'd drop in to say goodbye, say goodbye
To them bad habits, bad habits

[Verse 2: Kinetics]
Check, what, uh huh, kinetics in your headphones
Bad habits, feel like a crack addict
It's black magic – here, you can take it back, have it
Dear bottle, you're the reason I believe in myself
And that's the issue, cause without you I'm in need of some help
But it feels like a lifetime that I could rock with you with me
Back when a Old E 40 was $2.50
Tipsy, with a high guard, but some habits they die hard
Lettin' bygones be bygones, like Jay-Z when he signed Nas
So when these women want expensive vodka
I just pour the Svedka in the Kettle bottle, and see if they sense a problem
Or maybe they're over-sensitive and that sentiment sends 'em the wrong message
Fuck it, I need a tall beverage
But what's the cost of hoping when I lost my focus?
And of course I'm coughing cause I'm claustrophobic and the coffin's closing
I guess you do what you can when they're playin' hardball
Even Lance needed a drug to make his "arm strong"

[Hook: Kinetics]

[Mike Stud]
We don't need to talk no more
I'm leavin' you all alone
I won't look back, I won't do that
Cause me and you don't belong
We don't need to talk no more
I'm leavin' you all alone
I won't look back cause me and you don't belong

[Hook: Kinetics]
