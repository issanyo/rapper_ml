[Verse 1]
When we walk into the club, it's celebrity style
Takin' free shots like a technical foul, ow
Especially now, they had to hate it
Still a freshman even though I graduated
But I'm happy that it happened though
'Cause what's first class if you haven't sat in coach
So I'm livin' life in the left lane, and I'm on the road like the X Games
It feel good to be relevant though
Getting cheddar, livin' better than ever
So I'm livin' carefree, I'm a rare breed
Game on lock, and I got the spare key
And she like that, so she come through, and she grab on Mike, check 1, 2
Damn right, this a hell of a life, on tour but we both gonna remember tonight

[Hook:]
And she like good weed
And some cheap wine, just let go girl
We gon' be fine, be fine, be fine
Everything will be fine, be fine
But we ain't got no place to go, forget what you thought that you know
Just let go, go, go (x2)
Just let go (x2)

[Verse 2]
So tell me how you livin'
We on a trip, and they trippin', that shit is different
So tie your laces, I'm flyin' places for meetings
And shopping when I'm landing cause packing's an inconvenience
Now watch it all change up
Been on the come up but remember where I came from
I'm starting to make ends, I ain't worried about fake friends
'Cause I'm chillin' with the same ones
We just havin' fun, and they just talk about a bunch of shit they haven't done
And I come from a small town with city dreams
Like girls in Chuck T's and skinny jeans, and you fit the description
Forget about your friends, baby we should go missin'
So let's go, I got a car in the front
And you not a ho, you just know what you want, so come on

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Baby, take them clothes off, I don't even wanna ask twice
Go ahead and put them lights low, so we can go all night
So baby take them clothes off, and girl don't make me ask twice
So tell me what you like, we can do it all night
Everything will be fine
Just let go

[Hook]
