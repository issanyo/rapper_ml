[Intro]
Whatsup, whatsup, it’s Mike Stud
We’re at Jon Kilmer’s studio
Even though he’s a big vagina
It happen’s though, let’s go

[Verse 1]
Look, look, I say, hello nice to meet you
Blowing that loud like a speaker
So I’m really fucking high like my prices for a feature
I’m a beast, yeah I’m a creature
Ay, I just got that [?] brah
You talk shit, I’m a eat your face like the homie down in Florida
You ain’t got cheese, you on a diet
You’re not me, don’t try it
‘Cause it’s only one I like a motherfuckin’ pirate
I say kiss me bitch I’m Irish
And so is the tip of my dick, bitch
I do your girl so hard, she thought I was clicking a hit stick

[Interlude]
That’s for all my gamers right there
If you play Madden, you know what the fuck a hit stick is
Hey, let’s go, and my condolences to the dude getting his face eaten off
That was terrible

[Hook]
Now everybody go stupid, go stupid, go, go, go
Now everybody go stupid, go stupid

[Verse 2]
I’m ‘bout to go back in Jon, what do you say?
They tell me music was a long shot
I treat it like a free throw
They said I couldn’t but I bet I can sir, chemo
Gee ho, I’m a g so, I thinking it’s time that we face it
In the club living like paradise, and then I’m living by drake shit
Got girls coming O-V, then I’m a give her some X-O’s
Spitting as sick as a the flows be, like I’m living with strep throat
After that, bitch pack your bags, ‘cause now you must go
Give me dome then send you home
This industry is cut throat

[Interlude]
Hey, godamn, it’s hot as balls in here Jon
I thought there was some godamn AC
Fuck I need a drink, better

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It’s a wordplay parade, they telling me I got that ill flow
You see I never blow a line but somehow I’m still dope
I hope you caught that irony
‘Cause if rapping didn’t happen, your favorite team would’ve been signing me
Look everyday I wake up, I do the same shit
Brush my teeth, send a tweet, then go and make hits
And everyday I’m grinding, so I’m rhyming ‘till I’m on top
And sleep is for pussies, so motherfuck alarm clocks, bitch

[Outro]
Man my homies still
Hashtag SIFP
Shout out to all my followers that fuck with me
Same ten people always tweet me back
Always up late, I see ya’ll
Ok, now everybody go stupid
Mike stud, Jon Kilmer’s studios, brand new spot
I would plug the address but I have no idea where it is
Put that right there Jon
Right here, uh, bitch
