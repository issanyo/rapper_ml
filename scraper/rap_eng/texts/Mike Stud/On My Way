[Hook: Rich Young]
I got my head to the sky, I wanna know why it's my time (x2)
This ain't the life that I asked for, now I'm riding first class with my passport
And I know I'm on my way (x2)

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Tick tock, tick tock, I'm feeling like a time bomb
I am on my way and I don't need a TomTom
This is my domain, I ain't talking dot com
Mixing with this Red Bull cause I know that time flies
So give me wings, I'm tryna chase life
All I see is stage lights and these late flights
Date nights, shopping sprees out of town
Introduced to people that I'm usually not around
I'm with the dudes who fixing to hit the club with
Sleeping with these women I can never fall in love with
I still kiss 'em and tell 'em all of that love shit
Then I change the subject, zoom into the sunset

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Look, I'm on the come-up for what I dropped down
People say I got that dope flow with a pop sound
This rap shit was all a joke, but it's not now
I'm the diamond in the rough that got found
I'm meeting different girls ever night, bottle service sippin' liquor every type
I'm with the homies in the club and we cleaning house
Looking around like this is what we dreamed about
So take a hard listen while I play my cards different
Cause I am chasing the dough, word to Marge Simpson
And in night time, I'm staring at my ceiling
Cause it's kind of hard to sleep when you spend your days dreaming

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
First class trips, flying over oceans
I might not blow but I'm hot for the moment
Damn, I'm feeling like I'm in a dream
Not famous or flop, guess I'm like the in-between
Cause when I hit your town, see the lights flash
Last month, this time, I was stuck in night class
Now I rock shows, pack 'em up, lunch box
Everybody's hands up and I ain't taking jump shots
Yeah, I guess came a long way, I made my first fucking song in a hallway
It's been a long day and I ain't get no sleep
Life's a trip, at least I got the window seat

[Hook]
