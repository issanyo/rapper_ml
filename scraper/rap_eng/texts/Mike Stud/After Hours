[Verse 1]
I'm too lit to turn the lights down
If I have another drink then I might drown
Living life, that's a lifestyle
That I chose and I know it's quite wild
But all I know is I want you right now
Now I'm at the bar faded off that alcohol
Just got me a girl straight out the catalog
You ain't gotta stay forever when we turn the lights out
You ain't gotta stay forever
Just give me right now, that's why I'm calling right now

[Hook]
She said
If you're still up, then I'm still down
You know I'm yours when you're around
Are you still down to stay up with me and party?
Are you still down to stay up with me and party?

[Verse 2]
Couple drinks in me, couple texts to you
I swear to god this some type of shit I never do
And right now it's pretty obvious you want more
We could put 2 and 2 together girl but what for?
But you could ride with me like we on the Tour De France
Yeah, we could have a ball ain't gotta do it like Lance
So girl let me apologize to you in advance
Cause I'mma fuck you so good I'm about to ruin your plans
And everybody wanna act like they know all about me
I just get a kick out of it like Ronda Rousey
Holly Holm I'm hardly home but I've got time to party
I'm in the driver's seat so baby are you calling shotty?
So drop a pin girl, what's your location?
Every time I'm with you it feel like the right occasion
You can bank on it, yeah, we gon' make a statement
So give me right now, that's why I'm calling right now

[Hook]
She said
If you're still up, then I'm still down
You know I'm yours when you're around
Are you still down to stay up with me and party?
Are you still down to stay up with me and party?
