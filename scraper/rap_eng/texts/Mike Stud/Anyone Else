[Pre Chorus: Mike Stud]
She moved to the city with a couple friends
Barely in their 20's but they're fucking 10's
Getting paid for their face, went and copped the Benz
Party every night and do it all again

[Chorus: Mike Stud]
But you ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here
You ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
She grew up in Calabasas right next to the Kardashians
High school dropout but somehow you're acting classy
Been taking those acting classes
Girl you're so all natural
With us girl it's all passion
Don't need no hall passes

Cause you ain't like anyone else
Just can't get enough of you
When I'm on one, I'm calling you
Cause you're my number two
Guess who got my number boo
Make me feel so comfortable
If you're on the fence girl
Just know i'll take that jump with you

[Pre Chorus: Mike Stud]
She moved to the city with a couple friends
Barery on their 20's but they're fucking 10's
Getting paid for their face, wait and cop the benz
Party every night and do it all again

[Chorus: Mike Stud]
But you ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here
You ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
My girl like the spice girls, I swear to David
Got her on my Beckham call everytime I'm faded
I'm amazing
Yeah she is too, this weed is too (lighter flick)
The sweetest view, a suite for two it's me and you

Tell me what you like
I got all of that
Said I wouldn't fall, went and proved me wrong
You ain't fall for that
Morning, noon and night
That's just how I feel
But I just kept it real
Netflix and chill
Guess you fit the bill

[Pre Chorus: Mike Stud]
She moved to the city with a couple friends
Barery on their 20's but they're fucking 10's
Getting paid for their face, wait and cop the benz
Party every night and do it all again

[Chorus: Mike Stud]
But you ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here
You ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here

[Bridge: Mike Stud]
Whole day we lay low
Postmates can't say no
No way Jose way can say no

[Chorus: Mike Stud]
But you ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here
You ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here

But you ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here
You ain't like anyone else
You ain't like anyone else around here
