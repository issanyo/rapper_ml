[Intro: Fun]
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Yeah, let me make art with my words, welcome to my gallery
Wall full of life you are looking at reality
And if you don’t see it take a look in the mirror
My method is transparent and it couldn’t be clearer
I mean we, we just young and dumb and unsure of what’s next
Ain't worried about what’s right so what’s left
Yes, just a whole lot of summer time
Hit the town its going down we're nothing like an underline
I said this shit 100 times, listen to me
You don’t really need sleep when you're living your dreams
See, lets hit the bar no guest lists to freaking cover
Cause we just wanna be childish like Mr. Glover
Forget your issues and look for something fun to do
You’re looking in your rear view
You’re missing what’s in front of you
Uh, cause all we got is the youth
And what you wanna do with it is all up to you

[Hook: Fun]
Tonight, we are young (Cause all we got is the youth)
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter (Cause all we got is the youth)
Than the sun
(And what you wanna do with it is all up to you)

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
You gotta make your own moves and never ever question it
If you second-guess yourself for a second you'll end up second
And now we on a better level
They told us to settle down but we never settled
Cause mediocre is for the mediocre
So we partied like rock stars when we were broker
But the money and the fame wasn’t what we needed
And now we got it but I swear man we didn’t need it, believe it
But Jesus, I ain't no trick it feels kinda good
To give my family all the things I thought I never could
And since last year I’ve done did a lot of shit
Like dropping out of college with a scholarship for starters, bitch
But now I’m steady bombing it
Dropping all of the hottest shit
Grinding and shining trying to make all these rhymers anonymous
Uh, and who’s to say we not succeeding
We young and dreaming, living for something we believe in

[Hook]
