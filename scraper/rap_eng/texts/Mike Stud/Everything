Oh my God can't fucks with you
I like what I like, I like what I like
Oh my God can't fucks with you

[Verse 1]
If you tryna come, you can catch a flight
You can catch a vibe, never catch a feel
I say what I want, tell 'em how it is
We all gonna die, can I fuckin' live
Yeah, let me live, yeah, I need it all
So Imma get it in, 'til I'm in a coffin
Until I'm at the gates, so I ain't got no time to waste
I need everything but right now I don't need a thing

[Hook]
I need everything, I need everything, ah
Married to the game with a wedding ring, ah
Is it you, is it you that I like?
Is it you, is it you that I like?
I need everything, I need everything, ah
Married to the game with a wedding ring, ah
Is it you, is it you that I like?
Is it you, is it you that I like?

[Verse 2]
Rory with the golf
Guy Fieri with the sauce
Tom Brady with the play
Mark Cuban in the tank
They gon' say what they gon' say
They won't say it to my face, ah
Yeah, they talk about me
But I cannot hear 'em 'cause they from afar
They know who we are

[Hook]
I need everything, I need everything, ah
Married to the game with a wedding ring, ah
Is it you, is it you that I like?
Is it you, is it you that I like?
