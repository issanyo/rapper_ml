[Verse 1: Marcus Stroman]
Search for a ring like Dex
Jumpman cleats for the quest
Game time, bring my best
Fam tatted on my chest
Vibes up, never looking down
How many times have you seen me frown?
Standing out, never fittin' in
On top, my position is
And lately
Got baby mom with me daily
They can not test me or phase me
The deals comin' in, they are crazy
I stay on the move
I keep it true
With my team I cannot lose
Want me to play by the rules
But trust me I do what I choose
Pops sayin' he miss me
Wish things were different
But he made me this way
Yeah they talk but I don't listen
Work smarter than them
Designer on all of my friends
They fake and I never pretend
Give family all my ends

[Hook: Mike Stud]
Take it how you wanna
Got a lot of things on my mind
So take it how you wanna
I'mma do me every time
Take it how you wanna
Got a lot of things on my mind
So take it how you wanna
I'mma do me every time

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
As the clock ticks the plot thickens
Only got hits, you got misses
I don't talk shit, I talk business
All the gossip, I'm not with it
No false shit, I'm no gimmick
And the room stops when I'm in it
And the Jordan five's is authentic
But you couldn't walk a mile in 'em
Yeah I walk like a ball player still
I don't play 'cause I play the field
And I don't take shit, or the deal
Everything I say, you know it's real
And all the shit we used to dream about
Is just a normal evening now
We came up and we've be down
Trust me it evens out
It's still Mike Stud, homie
Fuck the shade they throwing
I'm no dice, can't roll me
And I just got the Rollie
So they see what time it is
Used to dream of all of this
What you see is what you get
Yeah, I stay me through all of this

[Hook: Mike Stud]
Take it how you wanna
Got a lot of things on my mind
So take it how you wanna
I'mma do me every time
Take it how you wanna
Got a lot of things on my mind
So take it how you wanna
I'mma do me every time
