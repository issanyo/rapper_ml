She try to act like she is out my league
But every night she playing on my team
She take it off and put it all on me
She what I want but she ain't what I need, what I need, yeah
Writing's on the wall but we ain't tryna read it
Talk a lot of shit but she don't really mean it
Why you so defensive, what you think your Revis?
You always call me out but let's just call it even

[Pre-Hook]
Don't try to act like you like sleeping alone
Don't play no fucking games

You know you can stay for the night

[Hook]
I go right, you go left, but you stay on my mind
I do this, you know that, keep me staying alive

Come kick it at my place we can catch a vibe
You only going through a faze I can let it ride
The only time you open up is when I get inside
