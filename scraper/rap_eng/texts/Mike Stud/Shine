[Hook: Mike Stud and Marcus Stroman]
Put them bright lights on
I shine on em
Put them bright lights on (Aye)
Put them bright lights on
This is my moment
Put them bright lights on
Let's go
Put them bright lights on
I shine on em
Put them bright lights on (Uh huh, Uh huh)
Put them bright lights on
This is my moment
Do it one time for the squad

[Verse 1: Marcus Stroman]
In them lights I hit the switch (Hit the switch)
Fifty thousand when I'm dealing in the 6ix (In the 6ix)
And you know they locked in on every pitch (Every pitch)
Life's crazy got the boy tagging me in pics (Woo!)
They think the getting me but they ain't never stressing me
Cooking in the lab and you know I got the recipe
Mama always texting me but I don't always get to see
But trust me, she already I know I got the message see (I get the message)
Love my family and my circle
Shout my Steve's word to Urkel
You know I'm working
With a purpose for certain
Tell my doubters "Turn it louder!" (Perfect)
Riding with my team, don't be sliding in my dm's
Cause you know I ain't gon' read em anyway (Anyway)
You know I got the tunnel vision
I don't see the competition
If I want it then I get it anyway (Anyway)

[Hook]
Put them bright lights on
I shine on em
Put them bright lights on (Aye)
Put them bright lights on
This is my moment
Put them bright lights on
Put them bright lights on
I shine on em
Put them bright lights on (Aye)
Put them bright lights on
This is my moment
Do it one time for the squad

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
I don't hear them things they say about us
Thank you Mama, thank you Papa
All the things you taught us made us stronger
I just try to make you prouder
They sleep on me constantly
I wake them up
You'd think I was in a monogamy
'Cause I ain't never gave a fuck
Feel like how the hell we make it here?
Everytime the ball drop
I just start my favorite year
And I don't ever fumble
Got the drive to take it there
On a couple liquors
Out in L.A like a Laker yeah
Don't bother calling
Won't bother texting, pray they get the message
Hey I made a couple dreams out of bad breaks
Talking deals with the team over crab legs
Got a cash safe
Just to keep the cash safe
Only brightside of Donald Trump is the tax breaks
And the only spot I've never been is last place
Living fast paced in the fast lane (Zoom, zoom, zoom)
Man I came from the diamond
Only right I shine (Yeah)
They be catching feelings
I just catch a vibe (Yeah)
Talk of the town even when I'm not around
'Cause I'm still making plays even when I'm out of bounds

[Hook]
Put them bright lights on
I shine on em
Put them bright lights on (Put em on now)
Put them bright lights on
This is my moment
Put them bright lights on (Uh huh, Uh huh)
Put them bright lights on
I shine on em
Put them bright lights on (Aye)
Put them bright lights on
This is my moment
Do it one time for the squad
