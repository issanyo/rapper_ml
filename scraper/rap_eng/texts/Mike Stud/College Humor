[Verse 1]
Man I love college, I never wanna leave this place
Van Wilder, I got the keys to the gate
Hold up, hold up, yeah I think it's my turn
Let me get up in your ear, like a sideburn
Like Derek Jeter I just need to be signed
And if you don't like the track than you need to rewind
I stay going hard, I'm Cal Ripken boy
Leanin' on the cup I'm sippin boy, I'm gifted boy
Making money chips ahoy!
Just keep moving up Lane Kiffin boy
Yeah, and it's a quick decision
Fresh all my work is in mint condition
Peep the precision, surgeon on the track
Fuck goin' in, I'm bout to make a quick incision
And I go about my flow quite swiftly
Go fast, then I change it up like Cliff Lee

[Hook]
And I'm telling all the girls the same thing
I'm telling all the girls I love them
But I don't really mean a damn thing
I just wanna go home and fuck them
So I, I'm just tryin' to have fun
So I, I'm just tryin' to have fun
So I, I'm just tryin' to have fun
Sorry girl, I'm just tryin' to have fun

[Verse 2]
Now I love all the girls, but it's still cash first
Cause I just wanna ball out like a bad serve
It's pretty much a fact that your girl wanna meet me
I'm all over the web like Brett Favre's peepee
And I'm so hot right now it might melt her
And she catch my balls better than Wes Welker
Haha, God dammit I'm a douche
Been around the world and I ain't shooting hoops
It's been two months and I might get famous, cocky
Talk more shit than Skip Bayless, sorry
And you really ain't living how I'm livin'
Get so much brain that my fitted ain't fittin'
Nah, I'm just kidding, I swear I'm deserving
Comin' for the top spot quicker than a virgin
And it's over, checker the flag
Big heart mo'fucker, with a pecker to match

[Hook]

And I'm telling all the girls the same thing
I'm telling all the girls I love them
But I don't really mean a damn thing
I just wanna go home and fuck them
So I, I'm just tryin to have fun
So I, I'm just tryin to have fun
So I, I'm just tryin to have fun
Sorry girl, I'm just tryin to have fun

[Outro]
I'm tryin' to have F-U-N
If you don't like it, F-U-then, bitch
