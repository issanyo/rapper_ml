[Verse 1: Mike Stud & Vory]
(Mike Stud)
I've been getting too drunk off things that I can't pronounce
On the phone making plays, getting head on the couch
Say your name for the plane, I don't care the amount
By the way, there's some things I can tell you about
(Vory)
Pull up in your city ask for 50 and they like that
Said she like my swag and all her niggas tryna bite that
I be with my dog, and if you bark then they might bite back
We ain't come here to play, you know it's on girl
I'm your homie so don't treat me like I made it
They was hating now they treat me like I'm famous
Oh man, hit her once she tryna marry me
Oh man, I'm too cocky I'm too arrogant
But I think I shoulda bought her a ring
You just court-side viewing you ain't balling with me
I'm too busy buying love when love's supposed to be free
And swag ain't cheap, fuck it put it all on me, Vory

[Pre-Hook: Vory]
New beamer when I pull in the sun
Change on me just like Polow da Don
Don't be fronting girl you know I'm the one
Number two is not an option and they know they can't stop me
Take off, take off, I can't take no breaks off, I've been working hard
Same people struggled at the bottom that'll rise with me

[Hook: Mike Stud]
You got dollars, yeah we got that shit in common
You got Prada's, yeah we got that shit in common
You got Gucci, yeah we got that shit in common
You got problems, yeah we got that shit in common
Say your prayers, yeah we got that shit in common
I made some errors, we don't got that shit in common
Come in pairs, you don't got that shit in common
Don't take it there, you don't really want the problems
Really want the problems

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Box office, hundred thou off this
You are not off this, you are not with the shits
You are not in your bag like me, you are not bouncing bags like me
Yeah, I'm talking back pain, back stab that's a damn shame
Back then, back then it was a fair game
Ah man, I switched lanes and they all changed
Ah man, they switched on me, yeah
But I swerve, the early birds always getting the first
This ain't a first for me, get some money they I burn it to the third degree
And ain't nobody say a word to me, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Vory]
New beamer when I pull in the sun
Change on me just like Polow da Don
Don't be fronting girl you know I'm the one
Number two is not an option and they know they can't stop me
Take off, take off, I can't take no breaks off, I've been working hard
Same people struggled at the bottom that'll rise with me

[Hook: Mike Stud]
You got dollars, yeah we got that shit in common
You got Prada's, yeah we got that shit in common
You got Gucci, yeah we got that shit in common
You got problems, yeah we got that shit in common
Say your prayers, yeah we got that shit in common
I made some errors, we don't got that shit in common
Come in pairs, you don't got that shit in common
Don't take it there, you don't really want the problems
Really want the problems

[Outro: Mike Stud]
