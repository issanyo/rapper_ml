[Hook: Kate Nash] x2
Why're you being a dickhead for?
Stop being a dickhead
Why're you being a dickhead for?
You're just fucking up situations

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Uh, well I guess so
But you can't say I didn't tell you from the get-go
They say nice guys finish last, well I'mma get far
Getting blowies in the morning for a head start
But I swear I'm not a douche, I'm just busy doing shit that I swear I'd never do
I'm a contradiction at its finest: was in the Virgin Islands getting blown like a sinus
Achoo! But I swear it's not you
Thirsty women in every single city I stop through
She said my lifestyle's inconvenient
When I'm drunk, yeah I tend to think with my penis
Look, I got new dough, I got new hoes, and my old goals are my new lows
I got a second chance, I'mma use it
I can't be yours, I'm here for the music

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Huey Mack]
I'm a dickhead, yeah right
Like you really thought this shit would last your whole life
Fuck it, I'mma go back to the crib tonight and beat that girl from 3 Doors Down, cause pussy's Kryptonite
Yeah, I don't need you
Talking in my ear like I give a fuck that I hear you
Uh, yeah, you're too clingy
Rather take you to the Holiday Inn like I was Chingy
Now that right there, that's the honest truth
After I show them the privates you know they all salute
So I don't really owe you my affection, like I ain't know that you've been ran through like an intersection
Me and Mike bout to chill up on a sunny beach
And when them bitches act thirsty give em Sunny D
So why the fuck you calling me a whore? Sorry baby, I ain't trying to be yours
That don't make me shit

[Hook]

[Bridge: Huey Mack & Mike Stud]
I got drunk and I told her that I loved her but I know, know, know that I don't, don't, don't
And maybe she's right, I'm just living my life and I'm learning as go, go, go
But I know, know, know, I'm a dickhead

[Hook]
