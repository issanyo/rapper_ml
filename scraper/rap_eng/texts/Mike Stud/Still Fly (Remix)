I'm still fly, I'm sky high, and I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still steady comin' at them, and these haters can't stand them
Homie I'm still doing my thing
I'm still fly, I'm sky high, and I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still shutting cities down every time I come around
Homie I'm still doing my thing

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
I walk up in the bar like I own the bitch, I know you're looking at me
But the key is not to notice it
Fuck being a player player, me I'm on my owner shit
The day to day commotion it's crazy it's hard to focus and
Fuck all of that sober shit, bitch I need a drink or two
And yes I'm sure about it, not the type of dude to think it through
Careful what you listen to, forget all the embellishment
No need to act intelligent, my wallet's full of evidence
So keep your oxfords, I wear my graphic tee
Cause there's no need to act it when you actually have degrees
Young king, I'm the boss of myself, you see me I'm dialed in
And you just calling for help, well I'm with my old friends
I got my new life, a whole lot went wrong, but I'mma do right
Lived it and I learned it, but nothing's ever perfect
Cause you got to take the chance to know if it was worth it

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Uh rocking J's from the 80's, straight up out the playoffs
Working 'til you make it player, never take a day off
Uh you see they warned about this industry
I'm making moves now everybody want a piece of me
But on the real I wish I would have listened
Cause my manager stole 10 grand and went missing
But it's whatever though, no time to waste on that
I played a sweet 16 and I made it back
Word to my mother, Momma I'm coming home
I'm sorry for the times that I rushed you off the phone
But I'mma make it right, I got to change my life
If time is fucking money, then I done paid the price
And some of it's a natural gift, word play is first rate
You can't scrabble with this, bitch!
Cause I been doing me lately, if they want to play hardball
Take a shot like G-Baby UH!

[Hook]

Mike Stud, Huey Mack August 1st
Set your fucking calenders

Whatever the fuck, I whatever it is
Put it in there bitch
Let's go
