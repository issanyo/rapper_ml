I got famous now they feel the way about me
Everybody wants to talk but never say that shit around me
I finally got put on, so them daughters get up off me
I'm just going to take my time to take out all my dirty laundry
What's up, What's up, What's up, What's up
I got your girlfriend at my show and I guarantee all she wan' do is fuck
Is fuck, is fuck, is fuck
So if you have something to say and never said that shit my way, this for you

[Verse 1: Huey Mack]
Bitch I'm ridin' around I'm gettin' it
I'm gettin' money and investin' it
I'm new to this, but I'm still the shit
I got actresses on my bucket list
They hate to see me shining, dog
They rather see me fail, I hope these fuck boys from our town
Are real content with chasing my tail
They say shit "He's too goofy, he's too chubby, man he's no star"
But I'm in a different country my view's lovely, want a postcard?
Got all these hoes on me, just go to a show, that's a fact
They say bands will make them dance
But my dick will make her do jumping jacks
Young and I'm living, I'm faded, I'm not really famous, I just like to say it
If you don't got it well shit you ain't got it, but I'm so iconic I feel like I made it
Hate on that all you like, just know we don't care what you do
My women look like Mila your bitches more Honey Boo Boo

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Huey shoulda, yes I shoulda, got a couple girls trynna lick my nut up
Got mugged once, but I never been stuck up
See me in the street guarantee you say woulda, woulda
Okay. Never give a fuck what a hater say
Covered Justin Bieber, but I made that shit way less gay
Hey, look at me now, it's going down, I'm just me though
Ripping my mouth when I'm ripping it down and I'm worried about zero
You can take that as a bad thing, well maybe if you say so
But I'll treat you like you're not there, call that Manti Te'o
I'm just living for the moment, no wonder damn I own it
No New Year's resolutions, just to home in on my focus
Most people like my style, these bitches say I'm sauna hot
The way I'm making headline, I'm something like a barber shop
