[Chorus]
I got all my friends feeling more like blood
Pour the liquor till we drown
Livin' all these nights like it's all we got
Come to far to go home now
No matter what we gon' find a way
Swing from the pendulum till it break
And the white flag up no we're never down for the count
And we'll do it till the lights black out
Do it till the lights black out


[Verse 1 Mike Stud]
I used to dream about this kinda life
Way back when I could sleep at night
I'm talking way back, way before I came back
Way before my boy was rockin' that jays hat
Yeah
Now we done made it this far we used to ride the Acela
Bought a crib for the homies and we got wine in the cellar
Call me Chelsea the way I handle it
I took a chance and I took advantage
I brought my brethren for each and every second
And we gon' give em hell until we get up to heaven
So this is for all the ones that I bring along
I'd rather be broke than be rich alone, yeah

[Chorus]
I got all my friends feeling more like blood
Pour the liquor till we drown
Livin' all these nights like it's all we got
Come to far to go home now
No matter what we gon' find a way
Swing from the pendulum till it break
And the white flag up no we're never down for the count
And we'll do it till the lights black out
Do it till the lights black out

[Verse 2 Mike Stud]
Yeah
I done came a long way
Long way from home
Long days longer nights long way to go
Broad day I drive the wrong way down the road
Cause if I don't got a lane, then I gotta make my own
Try to be careful of who you keep around
If they don't know your roots gotta weed them out
That make sense don't it?
I count on all my people like the census
That's the general consensus
Yeah shits moving fast but I like this speed
This don't feel like real life to me
And when it gets dark then I light this weed
My friends like my fam and they right with me

[Chorus]
I got all my friends feeling more like blood
Pour the liquor till we drown
Livin' all these nights like it's all we got
Come to far to go home now
No matter what we gon' find a way
Swing from the pendulum till it break
And the white flag up no we're never down for the count
And we'll do it till the lights black out
Do it till the lights black out

[Outro]
Say, what you wanna say
Run your mouth I will never change
You, what I wanna do
Nobody know what I'm going through
Say, what you wanna say
Run your mouth I will never change
You, what I wanna do
Nobody know what I'm going through
Say, what you wanna say
Run your mouth I will never change
You, what I wanna do
Nobody know what I'm going through
