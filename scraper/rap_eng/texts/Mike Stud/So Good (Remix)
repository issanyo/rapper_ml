[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Yo, see life lessons take time, thank God I have patience
Now I’m on the road, only stop for gas stations
I remember when I was in the back waiting
Now I’m smoking in the left lane, I call it drag racing
Damn ain’t it crazy how we came up
I laid the foundations, stay true to my makeup
I was just being me, not the mixture of Mac and Drake
I’m a mixture of me and me
Headed for TMZ, brought the team along
‘Cause we all got some people that we leaning on

[Hook: Missy Modell]
Oh, this is how it feels, live your fantasy out
Now we on the beach down in Mexico
Sitting with our feet up feet up, sipping margaritas
We ain't in a rush, we drinking slow
We’ll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything we want is ours
Now we living life like we should
You said we never had it so good

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
See things changed last year and all of ya’ll were part of it
Toast to success and baby I’m drinking all of it
And now I’m at a table with some babes that I think
Like each other, so the only thing straight is my drink
But I ain’t mad at ‘em, I been on some other shit
And through it all, I stay grounded, no punishment
Even out in LA, the women really into me
So many kisses on my cheek, you think I live in Italy
Mwuah, kiss the pass goodbye baby
‘Cause we’ll be gone for a while

[Hook]
