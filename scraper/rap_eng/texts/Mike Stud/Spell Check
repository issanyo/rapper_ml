[Verse]
They flexing for the pictures
But they stretching like a pitcher
Especially about the bitches
You don't see the type of wild shit that we do
But that's a separate issue
What if I don't wanna change?
What if I don't want the fame?
What if I'm afraid?
Different page, same story
Wrote you this book to say I'm sorry
And once you read it then you'll know me
But trust me baby that was all me
Cause I ain't even spell check it
Been touching down so many places I should have the NFL records
I don't need to spell check shit, ay
Never sell myself to sell records
She just wanna party, I can't really blame her
That's just how L.A. is when you young and famous
Everybody want it, and I can't really blame it
Just please don't let it change you
Cause I'm not here to save you

[Outro]
Never edit for someone else's credit
That ain't the message I'm sending
