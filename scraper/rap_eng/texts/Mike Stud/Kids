La la la la la
We ain't never growing up
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh ohh
We ain't never growing up

[Verse 1]
Well, I didn't wake up in a new Bugatti
It was on the couch of a shitty hotel lobby
Holiday Inn Express, oh yes, just come and find me
Livin' fast, ricky bobby, and got my homies beside me
And I put one in the air like
Don't care if it's wrong if it feels right
And i'm, I'm flyin' by the seat of my pants
Rather do what I want instead of meetin' demands
Do you believe in what they say?
Success is a journey but we treat it like a place
And it doesn't make sense if you don't enjoy the ride
Livin' young, wild, and free 'till the day that I die
Ridin' with my friends everywhere I go
Smilin' 'til the end that's just how I roll
And I'mma always be a kid
And when I make it, I'll be proud of how I did

[Hook]
La la la la la
We ain't never growing up
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh ohh
We ain't never growing up
Oh oh la la la la
We ain't never growing up

No no, and we're gonna stay young forever, ever

[Verse 2]
Giving up a dream is like living a lie
So I left that behind to find the good in goodbye
And I think I'm on the right path
Trying to figure out how to make the night last
And if I can't, we gonna do it again
Like we ain't got no other options
Tee it up every night, call that Bubba Watson
Cause I ain't tryin' to look back at what we shoulda had
Cause age is just a number and I was never good at math
So this is for my people just livin' for the moment
And when they get it, they gon' own it
And yeah, nothing is for certain, that's for sure
But we just livin' life, learning as we go
