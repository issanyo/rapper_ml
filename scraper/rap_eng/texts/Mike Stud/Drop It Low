[Intro]
She can drop it low like she dance for Ester Dean
Bouncin' it, bouncin' it (x3)
She can drop it low like she dance for Ester Dean
Girl just do your thing, bouncin' it
She can drop it low like she dance for Ester Dean

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Now go and drop it lower, this is how I get to know her
Got her in the palm of my hand like remote controllers
Running through that green like mowers, throw money like I owe her
She say "what's the hype about?"
I guess I'mma have to show her, yeah
Walk in the spot like we running the town
She drop it low till she's touching the ground
Shaking it for me, I'm throwing this money and making her love me
I'm shutting it down
Mike Stud, yeah that's me ho
Do the breaststroke with your bitch, but we ain't finding Nemo, no
Clinton hit me, now I got Clinton with me
Probably why I got all these pretty bitches sitting with me, getting with me
Giggity, giggity
Now I'mma make history, high as Yosemite, got an epiphany
Let's sippity till we get lit like a Christmas tree
I'm on a roll, ho, moving in slow-mo
My life is crazy, yours like J.D., it's just so-so
Now the things I used to dream about are finally getting realer
And if you ain't know about me, you should probably get familiar

[Outro]
Look at that, in them jeans
She a dancing fiend
And she can drop it low like she dance for Ester Dean
Girl just do your thing
Bouncin' it, bouncin' it (x3)
