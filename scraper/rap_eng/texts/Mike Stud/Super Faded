[Hook: Conrad]
I've been drinking way too long, super faded
Super faded, super faded
Turned up like my favorite song, super faded
Super faded, super faded
Walking around thinking I made it
Yeah I know I had too much and crossed the line
Super faded, I'm super faded
I'm super faded, baby I don't give a fuck tonight
Super faded, I'm super faded
Walking around thinking I made it

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Now it's feeling like a celebration
Eyes low, you can tell I'm faded
Standing on the couch like it's about to go down
Yelling out "we fucking made it"
I'mma keep drinking 'till my time is up
Mile high club, I could give a flying fuck
I got pretty girls next to me
Rolling around the club cause I want my ex to see
Cause I'm just trying to party though, sorry I'm not sorry though
Running to the top, I cannot stop - check out my cardio
I'm good, never been better
Too turned up, bitch get on my level (That I'm on)
And when the liquor is talking, I'mma live in the moment I'm gone
Faded

[Hook: Conrad]

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
I'm singing "oh, what an evening"
Packed bars what we in, riding in black cars, can't see in
And I'm hoping the night's as young as I'm feeling
And I'm gone, drunk off Patron
DJ keep playing my favorite song
And all of these hoes singing along
I'm batting cleanup, bringing them home
So I walk up in the building, got my head up to the ceiling
Got all my homies with me and I'm feeling like a million
I'm good, never been better
Too turned up, bitch get on my level (That I'm on)
And when the liquor is talking, I'mma live in the moment I'm gone
Faded

[Hook: Conrad]

[Bridge: Mike Stud & Conrad]
I'm just trying to party though (super faded)
Sorry I'm not sorry though (super faded)
I'm feeling like a million (super faded)
Super faded, super faded
Walking around thinking I made it
