[Hook]
All I need is just a minute
Imma tell you how I'm feeling
Yeah I swear that I can sit here with you all night
I can see you catching feelings
From the mirrors on the ceiling
And I'm liking what I'm seeing, ah

[Verse 1]
Hold the phone I'll be right back
I'll be right back
When I'm gone we can Skype sex
I know you like that
When you text me Imma write back
I'm talking right back
Weed and liquor on my nightstand
But please don't mind that no
'Cause I smoke, I drink
You too, okay
If I'm gone in the morning
No problem just stay
It goes both ways
Those games we play
We're hot then were cold
Say we're gone but we stay

[Pre-Hook]
And you ain't the type of chick that want attention
But I can give you more than you're expecting
And we ain't got the time to second guess it
Yeah I could fuck you right and be your best friend

[Hook]
All I need is just a minute
Imma tell you how I'm feeling
Yeah I swear that I can sit here with you all night
I can see you catching feelings
From the mirrors on the ceiling
And I'm liking what I'm seeing, ah
All I need is just a minute
Imma tell you how I'm feeling
Yeah I swear that I can sit here with you all night
I can see you catching feelings
From the mirrors on the ceiling
And I'm liking what I'm seeing, ah

[Verse 2]
Look, you know what the vibe is
You the one I vibe with
You the bomb dot com when I log in
I showed you all my cards yeah I'm all in
Even though from time to time
I'm petty like Tom is
Even though I know, I know I suck to fight with
Always gotta find a way to win like Tom did
So every time we arguing
You call I let it go for like five rings

[Pre-Hook]
But you know Imma always get the message
You try to hold me down and I respect it
But I'm just making plays don't get defensive
You know Imma fuck you right and be your best friend

[Hook]
All I need is just a minute
Imma tell you how I'm feeling
Yeah I swear that I can sit here with you all night
I can see you catching feelings
From the mirrors on the ceiling
And I'm liking what I'm seeing, ah
All I need is just a minute
Imma tell you how I'm feeling
Yeah I swear that I can sit here with you all night
I can see you catching feelings
From the mirrors on the ceiling
And I'm liking what I'm seeing, ah

[Verse 3]
Bottom line when I'm top of you
I don't think I've had a better view
You know I ain't like these other dudes
I'm on a wave and you can ride it to
You a real one
All the rest I had to fake
Never closed off
Even when I had you naked
You a shot in the dark
But I had to take it
And I made it, yeah

[Hook]
All I need is just a minute
Imma tell you how I'm feeling
Yeah I swear that I can sit here with you all night
I can see you catching feelings
From the mirrors on the ceiling
And I'm liking what I'm seeing, ah
All I need is just a minute
Imma tell you how I'm feeling
Yeah I swear that I can sit here with you all night
I can see you catching feelings
From the mirrors on the ceiling
And I'm liking what I'm seeing, ah
