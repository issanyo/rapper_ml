[Verse 1]
They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired, your kiss has got me wired

[Hook]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows
I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
We can leave the night on, but tell me what you're doing tonight
If it ain't me then you ain't doin' it right, right?
You lookin' sexy all in that dress, sending X's and O's in your texts
And that sex you know is the best, lemme show you how I do
Woo, time out
You so bad you need a shoutout
Let's go somewhere else and vibe out
With that tan skin and them red lips, can't imagine how the head is
I'm playing, I'm just saying
I think it's time we get involved
No need to talk, that look says it all
Yeah, but for real this feel like something I would want forever
We found each other, let's get lost together

[Hook]

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon
We can leave the night on

[Hook]
