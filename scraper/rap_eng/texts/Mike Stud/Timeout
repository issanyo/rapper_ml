[Intro]
Ok I'm hollering at the moon (everything foreign everything foreign)
Seeing how I do who the fuck are you?
The same bitches and they coming through (I'm just I'm just down to fuck one of them)

[Chorus]
Just was standing in the corner, that's a timeout (that's a time out)
Just got a Rolly, but I never check the time no (no I don't)
Got plenty on me, cause I had to pay to find out (had to pay)
That I don't want it, but I had to stay to find

[Verse 1]
I'm on point, jackpot
Called your bluff, you mad dog
Listen no bad talk, millions off the laptop
Now I'm off the blacktop
Don't know how to act, aw
Hit the switch and blast off
I ain't going back now
It's on me, homie
They know me
Don't know them
It's different
I'm different
Just listen
I go in, you go out
Just slow down, you sold out
I'm all in, I'm going, keep going
Yeah

[Chorus]
Just was standing in the corner, that's a timeout
Just got a Rolly, but I never check the time no
Got plenty on me, cause I had to pay to find out
That I don't want it, but I had to stay to find

[Refrain]
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark
That's why I'm here, that's why I'm here
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark
That's why I'm here, that's why I'm here

[Verse 2]
Vision 20/20
You see black and white
Energizer bunny
I beat the drum all night
This didn't happen overnight
You see me out here, right?
Let's catch a flight to somewhere nice, get lost in paradise
Got some beautiful women in every position I've been in my life
She got some coke on her nose with nowhere to go, she asking advice
I told her just take your time or you gonna pay the price
You gotta learn the game before you can play it right, yeah

[Chorus]
Just was standing in the corner, that's a timeout
Just got a Rolly, but I never check the time, no
Got plenty on me, cause I had to pay to find out
Then I don't want it, but I had to stay to find

[Refrain]
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark
That's why I'm here, that's why I'm here
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark
That's why I'm here, (that's why I'm here, yeah)

[Outro]
Stars belong in the dark (think fast)
Stars belong in the dark (think fast)
Stars belong in the dark
Stars belong in the dark (think fast think fast)
Stars belong in the dark (think fast, think fast)
(think fast, think fast)
(Big facts it's hard for you to think fast)
