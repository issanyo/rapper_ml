[Hook - Huey Mack]
One time if your tyrna get throwed
Wiggle it girl drop low, go touchin' them toes
And don't hold nothing back
This is the way that it should be
This is the way we should act
(x2)

[Verse 1 - Huey Mack]
I don't know where the night is heading
I hope that I don't regret it
Cuz I wake up with a grin from the memories that I'm left with
And the necklace of the bitch that I just slept with
Fuck I've been getting reckless
But you I'm just young and dumb and unsure in hopes that I'm gon find more
Lets light it up and take a flight like the concords
Go ahead and fill my glass
Baby wiggle round that ass, you only get to live it once
So live tonight like its our last
Pour some shots and raise your tabs
Give it everything you have
If your living like you mean it, then the world is up for grabs
We can do it if we want, we can live just like we dream
We don't have to be in castles for you to know that we kings
We can make it if we try
Dont listen to what they saying
And you'll see these celebrations
Don't go to the ones that hatin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Scolla]
Yeah, one time for living reckless
Two times for the girls down to get naked
Weed for breakfast, Patron for dinner
The reason my face is the only thing you remember
Rewind, think back, it was a red cup motto
And we was drinking like our futures were stuck in a bottle
Celebrate tonight and we pray we get to tomorrow
Tell me you're down for whatever and ain't afraid of what follows
Yeah, thats the ones I like
Girl you one of the reasons that I love my life (hey)
I swear I like everything (what's that)
We gon light up like Tom Edison
Hand me the zippy baby, roll up the sticky baby
Tell me your secret, don't hold back the vickies baby

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Mike Stud]
Never hold nothing back, always move ahead
Cuz regret is just the crap that you wish you woulda did
Or the shit you shoulda said
And life is what you make it
Cuz you either get the picture or be the person who takes it
Embrace it, so YOLO is the motto
Taking photos like a model
And I'm sippin on Miscotto, pulling right up out the bottle
Got my foot up on the throttle, living life like its a race
Cuz I'd rather make mistakes than let it go to waste
Cuz time is money, and how you gonna spend it?
Today's a fucking gift, thats why we call it the present
Get it? So I'm just doing what I like to do
Spend a couple grand on the room with the nicer view
So I'mma get it while I'm here
Cuz we never really know when that finish line is near, for real

[Hook]

And don't hold nothing back
Now everybody, so put your middle fingers up
If you don't give a fuck
We just tryna have some fun tonight
Now put your middle fingers up
If you don't give a fuck
We just tryna have some fun tonight
