[Intro]
She like some good weed and some cheap wine
Just like oh girl we gon' be fine
Cause we ain't got no place to go, go, go
So baby just let go, go, go

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, you're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king bed without a queen
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
You make me complete, you're all that matters babe

[Verse 1]
Okay, thinkin' 'bout you for the whole day
Sittin' in my room playing Coldplay, hand to God that body holy, oh babe
Alright, I got what you need though, you should come with me though
Only five foot something, but that body fucking mean
So I gotta be nice, and you should hop on this flight
And spend a week out in LA, have the time of your life
Alright, fuck your friends, fuck all them
Fuck all of their feelings too
Talking from the outside, but they ain't in the building, ooh
You, you, you what I want to do this year
Meet you where you where you are, and take you home just like a souvenir
And the way you work that thing, you should quit your day job
Cause you just dope all the time, I should call you A-Rod

[Hook]
Oh no, no, no, oh no, no, no
She's confident like, oh no, no, no
She's confident like
And we do this everyday, every time I come around
Now, this is what they say, they like
Oh no, no, no, oh no, no, no
He's confident like, oh no, no, no
He's confident like
And we do this everyday, every time I come around
Now, this is what they say, they like

[Outro]
And we do this everyday, every time I come around
Now, YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!
And we do this everyday, every time I come around
Now, this is what they say, they like
Oh no, no, no, oh no, oh no
