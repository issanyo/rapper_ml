[Intro: Accent]
It's Accent, Kinetics, Mike Stud
Let's get it

[Hook: Kinetics]
All these things bottled up, I needed to say to you
Tried, but I never knew how
But I've been drinking all night, and I think I'm on one
So I might as well do it now
Cause I don't wanna bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah
Bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah
Bottle it up, bottle it up, ay yeah
We gonna pour it out tonight, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Another night, another flight
This a toast to everything I'm doing right (yeah)
Taking off in the literal sense
But doing music full time is a little intense
And now, I don't know where I'm flying to
I fly, then I land and I party just because I'm signed to
Mind you that I did what I was trying to
Now all I do is get with women that I'm blind to
Saying adios to the girl I love most
And these women on the road don't even come close
At the end of the day, I guess I needed you
Wanted it all, but couldn't have my cake and eat it too
Never told you anything that you need to know
And it seemed that the best bet was for me just to go
What would I say if me and you could have a night alone?
But for now, I'm gonna tell it to this microphone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kinetics]
Uh yeah, bottle it up
We don't stop pouring the bottles until the bottoms are up
And we don't have a chaser here to follow it up
Cause we like the way the honesty burns
So we turn the lights low when we took shots
Y'all don't got that good pot
Y'all need to invest in better trees, Woodstock
Cause tonight we getting faded like it's '69
Till I tell you everything that I have bottled up inside
We build clocks, print calendars, and predict the weather
But when we stop to sit, we never think to sit together
I just want to sit next to you to confess to you
I could write a book with all the things I never said to you
Why tell it all when I make a track
Cause if you wear a hard cover, you'll never make any paper back
Look you in the eyes when I state a fact
So when I finally say it, I will never take it back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Accent]
I can't bottle this up, with my drunk ass
That's why I got this cup, to have another rum glass
There's still not enough shots for us, I'm fuckin' [?]
So I'm 'bout to bust some shots and thrust us out, my guns a-blast
Somethin' fast
Don't even ask me who the thuggest is
A-double is, and if you ain't know it then you full of piss
Full of spit, take a deep breath, that's when I pull the trig'
Connecting underground spots like a squirrel's burrowed bridge
I'm like a fuckin' bear, more like hug-a-bear
But it's like a fuckin' bear hug, when I hug a bear
Plug a deer, bright orange vest, while a chug a beer
[?] while a puff that air
I stuff that air with words that ooze from my inner
Grit my teeth and groan like someone put glue in my dinner
I poo in your dinner, remember that you's a beginner
We choose to be winners to fools who refuse to forget us

[Hook]
