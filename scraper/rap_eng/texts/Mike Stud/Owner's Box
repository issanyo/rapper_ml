[Verse 1]
If you ain't acting right, you gon' get left
I don't check my bags cause I'm jetlagged
Bout to touch down, hit the fucking shopping center
I'm so hungry it's ironic I ain't got no time for dinner
I'm in that convertible, I'm cruising down the highway
I did it my way (I did it my way)
I'm in that convertible, I'm cruising down the highway
Blowing ganja, that's a high way
You don't even know the half, I like keeping it like that (just like that)
I'm at the game but I leave before the half cause I'm a G like that
Yeah, I'mma be right back

[Hook]
Man, I'm twisting off Corona tops
Used to be on the field, now I'm in the owner's box
Ooh, owner's box

[Verse 2]
Don't compare me to your last dude, we organic
That man is fast food, nah
Don't compare me to your old dude, that man is old news
We organic, we so Whole Foods
My life feel like a business venture
I'm benefitting cause I been efficient
I finished dinner then I finished in her
You heard me right, I finished in her
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Her followers are real but her friends ain't
Prada bag is real but her tits are fake
She took a pic today, she post it on that gram
That shit is going H.A.M
Damn, right about now my girl's a centerfold
I don't know which one of us is next to blow
Thought I'd let you know my dick game professional
I call it tic-tac-toe cause I gave my exes Os

[Hook]
Man, I'm twisting off Corona tops
Used to be on the field, now I'm in the owner's box
Ooh, owner's box

[Outro]
Don't compare me to your last dude, we organic
That man is fast food, nah
Don't compare me to your old dude, that man is old news
We organic, we so Whole Foods
If you ain't acting right, you gon' get left
I don't check my bags cause I'm jetlagged
Bout to touch down, hit the fucking shopping center
I'm so hungry it's ironic I ain't got no time for dinner
