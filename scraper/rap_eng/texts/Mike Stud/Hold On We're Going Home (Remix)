[Bridge: Mike Stud]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook: Mike Stud]
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Red kisses on that wine glass
Memories of you as the time pass
Uh, I used to put it on your fine ass
Good girls are hard to find
Baby you were my last, god damn
Got pretty girls around me everywhere that I am
Even when I'm gone just know that I'm there
Know it doesn't feel like it, but I care
Yeah, and I never been the best at showing
Reading through these texts and it's best you know it
And I know I've been a mess but I'm getting through it
And ever since you left, I'm just left with music
Uh, I think it's lonely at the top but the view nice
If I get another chance, I'mma do it right
And until then, I'mma go alone
And just know that girl I'm coming home
