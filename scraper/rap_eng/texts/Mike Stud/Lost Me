[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
I been walking on a tight rope
Every time I switch time zones
Why you always calling my phone
Ask who I'm with like fuck if I know
But, I can take 'em out I can take 'em home
I could fall back I could play the zone
I can turn 'em on like their favorite song
I can make sure that I ain't alone
But, like Bernie Madoff I made the play
Played it the fairway, I'm Taylormade
It's better to burn out than fade away
Ay, I ain't coming to save the day

[Hook: Vory]
Don't I get you anything you want?
Yeah, Gucci, Prada, even Saint Laurent
Yeah, I kept it a hundred from the jump
Lost me, I think you lost me
Say, but they used to get me for the low
'Cause he need a hundred for a show
Why you always gotta do the most
Lost me, I think you lost me

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
You can find me in my office, I'm on some boss shit
Running the offense, I'm exhausted
Tell that bitch spin the bottle, but, hold the sparkles
I don't like the lights I prefer the darkness
And my bitch stand up but she ain't awkward
Need me in the morning I'm like a coffee
Bitches looking at me like I'm Ryan Gosling
'Cause me I'm bout that action, fuck the talking
'Cause she know that I got it like that (she knows)
She know that I run it out here (she knows)
Yeah, I've been making plays out here (oh yeah)
EA it's in the game like that

[Hook: Vory]
Don't I get you anything you want?
Yeah, Gucci, Prada, even Saint Laurent
Yeah, I kept it a hundred from the jump
Lost me, I think you lost me
Say, but they used to get me for the low
'Cause he need a hundred for a show
Why you always gotta do the most
Lost me, I think you lost me

[Verse 3: Vory & Mike Stud]
Say, bossing I think I'm bossing
I'm no longer fed up I think you lost me
Feeling saucy, I'm feeling saucy
Now you want my time you won't get that often
Had to get on my high-horse and hit the road
I'll come back when you want more, give and go
I'm the one that you take to but take it slow
You ain't taking my last name but I'll take you home
Cause either way I'm on the way right now, now
I ain't got a lot to say night now, now
You can have it any way right now, now
'Cause baby I know, baby I know he can't do you right

[Hook: Vory]
Don't I get you anything you want?
Yeah, Gucci, Prada, even Saint Laurent
Yeah, I kept it a hundred from the jump
Lost me, I think you lost me
Say, but they used to get me for the low
'Cause he need a hundred for a show
Why you always gotta do the most
Lost me, I think you lost me
