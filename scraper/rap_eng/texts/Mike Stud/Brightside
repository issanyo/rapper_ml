[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Fucked around and got famous on 'em
And I don't be saying nothing, that's saying something
Everyone's saying something, I can't blame 'em for it
Now everyone back at home talking about us, we their favorite subject
Yeah, I know they see me when I'm in public
Nothing like Bieber, but I'm adjustin'
All I can see is the commas coming
I swear to god, yeah I'm onto something
I swear to god, yeah I'm onto something
Been ballin' out way before the budget
Trust me, they try to push us but we ain't budging
Fuck 'em, I play for keeps but I don't play much at all
Better watch your bae like Hasselhoff
Trust me homie I ain't mad at all
Cause if they mad at me, that's how it had to be
And I just be killing shit everywhere
They don't have to like it, we don't have to care
Your team needs Rogain because all of y'all never here
I make it rain in these women like Fred Astaire
Singing in the rain, numb from all the pain
After parties on Mulholland, cabs at dawn and watch them fade away
Superficial bitches kissing in my kitchen listening to Ye

[Hook: Mike Stud]
Shades on
Cause me and all my guys just look at the bright side
If you're not in the right mind, then it ain't the right time
And please no photos like we at The Nice Guy
Got everyone asking about me like the code for the wifi

[Bridge: Mike Stud]
Let me remind you, that we ain't lying
Been to every fucking city, you can bet they're fucking with me
We ain't lying, yeah I did it all on my own
I've got it under control, yeah I've got this under control yeah

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
I'm at war but this ain't Call of Duty bitch
They don't like the image so let's focus on the music then
I really do this shit, I really do this shit
Wait until you hear all my newest shit
Should have been sooner but I've been too busy with all of these movie scripts
I'm on my movie shit right now
Yeah I'm on the real, yeah Mike on the real
Yeah bite on the ear like she's Holyfield, she likes how that feels
Ahead of my time like my watch is broke
Ahead of my time but I'm so behind on my schedule
Told 'em you never know

[Hook: Mike Stud]
Shades on
Cause me and all my guys just look at the bright side
If you're not in the right mind, then it ain't the right time
And please no photos like we at the The Nice Guy
Got everyone asking about me like the code for the wifi

[Bridge: Mike Stud]
Let me remind you, that we ain't lying
Been to every fucking city, you can bet they're fucking with me
We ain't lying, yeah I did it all on my own
I've got it under control, yeah I've got this under control yeah

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
The views getting better the higher we get up
Views keep on climbing the more that they play us
Crew stay together, the vibes are way up
At On The Rox, but my drink is straight up
We playing chess while they're playing checkers
They send the checks but nobody checks us
Know what I'm saying? You know I ain't playing
I take it, you know that I made it
I'm getting mine, and I'm like a mime it goes without saying

Goes without saying
Goes without saying
Goes without saying (you ready)
Goes without saying
I take it, you know that I made it (take it, you know that I made it)

Uhyuuuready?
