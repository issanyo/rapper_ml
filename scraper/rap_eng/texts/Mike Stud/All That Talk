[Verse 1]
We could put the top down we could ride out
Little green day time of your life now
Yea you could bring your friends we can mob out
Back to my house yea we can vibe out
And we can kick them all out girl you're mine now
We can drink a little wine just to wind down
Ooo you a freak lemme find out
Ooo you in trouble now time out
You walked up in your Giuseppe's
Have you wake up in only Freshete
We could kick it kick it like Messi
Like Messi
Girl you so cold like Gretzky
I can make you dip dip low like Wesley
You're the only one that really gets me
You get me

[Hook]
You always call me when you're drunk
Playing all your friends my songs
I know what you really want
Yea I know

[Chorus]
Ain't got shit to do right now
I think we should cruise right now
To see what all that talk is about
Talk is about right now
So come on, make your move right now
Girl it's just me and you right now
To see what all that talk is about
Talk is about right now

[Verse 2]
Ain't gotta think about shit when we're on the road
GPS girl tell me where you wanna go
Yea you can hit the J if you wanna smoke
Yea we can get high keep it on the low
She float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Louboutin heels but she quick on her feet
You can't tell shit but she listens to me
It's different with me
Barely 21 but she a savage
Takes my lyrics and makes a caption
She don't pay for shit but she pays her taxes
She likes Fall Out Boy and Weezer
Late night stops with pizza
Please no grease up on my t-shirt

[Hook]

[Chorus]
(x2)
