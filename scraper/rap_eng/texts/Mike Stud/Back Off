[Hook]
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate
Back off
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate, wait
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate
Back off
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off, okay

[Verse 1]
I'm going high and inside
I'm going high and inside
I gotta lie on this side
And I won't go quiet this time
So I'm getting high while I drive
I feel like I'm flying through life
See I can be anything except a bitch
I take the heat like a catchers mitt
Chain dipping lane switching
Doing things different
There ain't a dang difference
Some people switch up I ain't miss them
Couple hiccups I ain't tripping
I don't miss much my aim steady
When shit get heavy I stay lifting
So if you ain't ready don't play with me, okay

[Hook]
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate
Back off
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate, wait
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate
Back off
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off, okay

[Verse 2]
How many ways can you drop one pie
How many ways can you ruin my high
How many things can you do in one life
Can't do it all but I damn sure try
You in my way or you on my side
Get off my plate when I'm on my vibe
I ain't got time
But I go up like 2-3
I got vert like Uzi
She looked at me like who's he
So hold my drink like koozie
My life ain't regular nah
Neither my schedule nah
I don't sleep often
I don't sleep often nah
But all these crystals in my blunt
Got me out sleep walking
I just keep it real I don't need to wear a grill
I ain't never never cheap talking
But if I draw a line in the sand
You better keep off it
Better not cross it
Better be cautious
Better that than to ever be talking
Ah, shit

[Bridge]
Get the fuck off my plate, man
I like you, but you crazy
(We can't lose our composure!)

[Hook]
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate
Back off
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate, wait
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off
That's my plate
Back off
Get the fuck off of my plate
Back off, okay
