[Hook]
Girl drop it to the floor, I love the way that booty goes
All I wanna do is sit and watch you move while I proceed to blow this cash

[Verse 1]
OK, now stop, lemme talk for a little
I'm not Malcolm but I'm stuck in the middle
Of a couple pretty women, and a cup of chilly liquor
And they digging every minute, so they wonder why they get it
Oh Lord, have mercy, hit it hard like the home run derby
Quit playing girlfriend I know you've heard of me
Going in on every track like a surgery, ow
Got cheap champagne up on my rider
Going H.A.M.mer every night
Good thing the bus comes with the driver
Am I alive or dreaming, cause I'm living like a boss do
Who knew the boy from Duke had more soul than horseshoes
Pow, tell me how you like me know
Fresh up off the bus
Hungover as fuck at Mr. Chow's
All my decisions been driven by intuition
Said this shit from the beginning
I just wish they would have listened, for real
Said this shit from the beginning
I just wish they would have listened for real

[Bridge]
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right, fucking right, alright
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fucking right, fucking right, alright

[Verse 2]
I say "Look ma, No hands", I'm with Fader I go H.A.M
I brought Kilmer, I brought Blue, and ain't got time for no romance
All these motherfuckers getting mad at me
By the way I shut it down so casually
This right here something that you had to see
Hit the stage and I'm bald like Agassi
Okay I'm on it, take my number down and call it
Cause I'm famous from the web, I guess I'm similar to Charlotte
They Pippen I'm Jordan, they shoot and they miss I'm scorin'
Got a leg up on the competition, lookin' like Captain Morgan
But for the record, I just thought I that I should mention
I'm a silver medal in bed, I always come in second
Yeah, my night is free ain't got no plans
I'm Captain Hook, but for this instead of one we got no hands

[Bridge 2]
And we fuck all night till things get right
Then we fuck all night till things get right
Cause I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
It's mine, I spend it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round, I'm gettin' it
It's mine, I spend it
