[Bridge]
Things we wanna be
Things we wanna see
Things we wanna know
Why we always wanting more
Harder than it seems
Always in between
Places you wanna go
And the one we call home

[Hook]
Don't stop, keep going
Like you're never gonna be here again, never gonna be here again
Yeah that's right don't stop, keep going
Like you're never gonna be here again, never gonna be here again
Don't stop, keep going
'Cause you're never gonna be here again, never gonna be here again
Yeah that's right don't stop, keep going
'Cause you're never gonna be here again, never gonna be here again

[Verse]
Everything you want is on the other side
If you never jump then how you gonna fly
Take your pain to the bank
Take your pain to the bank
The mistakes are your best advice
'Cause when you change how you think
And you play 'em to your strengths
Then you gain through the sacrifice
'Cause everything a lesson if you ready to learn
Everything a lesson when you ready to learn
So don't give up
Even when it feels like too much
Everything you ever wanted now
Could be right around the corner yeah
Sometimes we're so numb
It feel good just to feel again
And even if we're standing right here
We might never be here again

[Hook]
Don't stop, keep going
Like you're never gonna be here again, never gonna be here again
Yeah that's right don't stop, keep going
Like you're never gonna be here again, never gonna be here again
Don't stop, keep going
'Cause you're never gonna be here again, never gonna be here again
Yeah that's right don't stop, keep going
'Cause you're never gonna be here again, never gonna be here again
