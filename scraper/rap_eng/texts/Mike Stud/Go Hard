Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Live your little life in a bubble
You too extra you should be subtle
Do too much it get you in trouble
So get that out of here like Mutombo, yah
Feeling like the king of the jungle
I don't feel the need to rebuttal, nah
So much on my mind that I juggle
But I don't drop the ball, I don't fumble, nah
Guess you gotta aim high, me I'm bout to take flight
I don't see no break lights
We are not the same type, all you do is waste time, I can't let you take mine, nah, nah

[Hook]
I go hard, eh, yeah, I go hard, yeah
Mike go hard, ooh, yeah
I go hard, I go hard, eh
I go hard, I go hard
Mike go hard, ooh, yeah
I go hard, eh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Need my space, upgraded the crib, oh you should see my place
Just filled the jet up I'll be on my way, I'm hungrier than ever, you should see my plate
But wait, I got my own Kate Upton
You know I'm always up to something, we coming down off the substance
Shout out to the Steve's, yeah we love it
Yeah, cop the watch for 85, lost the shit the same night, probably shouldn't stage dive
We are not the same type, can't afford to waste time
Shoot my shot like A.I

[Hook]
I go hard, eh, yeah, I go hard, yeah
Mike go hard, ooh, yeah
I go hard, I go hard, eh
I go hard, I go hard
Mike go hard, ooh, yeah
I go hard, eh, yeah

[Verse 3]
We walking in, they saying who are they
You never know, but I still knew the way
And I'm the reason, feel like Hoobastank
Coach K, I put you on game
Wait up, went and got my weight up, eh
Wake up, nah I ain't gotta say much
'Cause I go hard, just poured something strong in my cup
I give all of my fucks, you don't want it with us

[Hook]
I go hard, eh, yeah, I go hard, yeah
Mike go hard, ooh, yeah
I go hard, I go hard, eh
I go hard, I go hard
Mike go hard, ooh, yeah
I go hard, eh, yeah

[Outro]
Man, I go so hard
I don't really see no end in sight
Sometimes the only thing you can do is keep going
And that's what the fuck I'm doing!
Eh, eh, I go hard
