From day one never needed a direction
A year later I'm on top of the projections
And everybody's telling me that they think I'mma make it
And I'm just trying to get used to people thinking I'm famous
Making a statement in the game I came in
The haters tried, they're waiting, but their name's not Damon
People hitting me up I ain't heard from in a minute
Acting like we cool cause they heard that I was spittin', forget it
Keep it brief please, no boxers
Circle of trust closed and you're Greg Focker
Swag times two, poetical haiku
If you're nicer than me, why didn't they find you?
Ooh, hungry dude and you lames are on the menu
They just mad that we doing everything they pretend to
Damn, middle finger to the doubters
Sharing life with people that couldn't live it without us
Cause I'm never gonna stop and know my haters gonna flock
And as I make my way to the top, bitch you oughta know by now
That I'mma give it all I got, whether you like my shit or not
Cause you're gonna hear my name a lot, bitch you oughta know by now
I'm XXL dreaming, coming quicker than some semen
Been ballin' from first pitch, but it's a long season
Yeah, sold out but we pack 'em in, guess this rapping thing is happening
Don't dress the part but I feel like I belong
No jewelry on, bitch I'm something like LeBron
Fitted jeans, Freshletes tee, no polo
Shooting for my goals, who the f*ck is Hope Solo?
I stay with my team, no homo, now you know ho
So come over and bounce up on this stick like a Pogo, oh
And I swear that I'm here to stay, I got a dreams of a bigger stage
Are they real or fake? Guess we'll have to wait and see patiently
Until the top spot is a vacancy
They just mad that we doing everything they pretend to
Damn, middle finger to the doubters
Sharing life with people that couldn't live it without us
