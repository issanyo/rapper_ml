[Verse 1]
I woke up, I poured a drink, we threw a party
That Peach Ciroc mixed with some Sprite, maybe some molly
Call up your friends, I'm about to be with all my people
Last night was crazy, but tonight we'll make a sequel
Wanna see you so tell me what it is that you need
With me is the place you should be
A lot of these women I'm not really into, girl you're in a whole 'nother league
So tell me what you thinkin' bout
Cause tonight girl it's just you and me, so let's figure it out

[Hook]
I can lift you up
Even if the sky is falling down, just know that you'll be safe and sound
I can show you love
And whenever I come back around, just know that you'll be safe and sound
Fuck with me, you know I got it (x3)
Oh yeah, you know I do

[Verse 2]
Got crazy girlies waiting for me in my lobby
This shit popped off and I came out with Toast to Tommy
They wanna fuck me cause they saw me in Versace
No, not no shirt, the video
I know you watched me, yeah you saw me
But I got it like that right now
Know your friends talking all of that nonsense
All on your conscience, running they mouth
But don't mind them, you the one that I'm about
Yeah, I am
And I know this shit got complicated, but you were here before it all
We gotta try to make it

[Hook]
