[Intro]
It feels so good
It feels so good

[Verse 1]
We're too fucked up to drive
Can't have no DUI's
I just caught me a driver
Come with me for the ride
Do this shit all the time girl
Just so we feel alive
We gon' break all the rules girl
We gon' catch us a vibe
She gave me all I need
All that and then some
Ain't worried 'bout the scene
We made our own one
Now I'm doing what I want to
And they pay me for the walkthrough
That's for everything I've gone through
Gone through, yeah

[Hook]
Life is short but we in it for the long run
Can't turn it off, especially when we're on one
We're all the same, we all got our problems
We all our problems
And sooner or later you'll find out
That life is short but we in it for the long run
Can't turn it off, especially when we're on one
We're all the same, we all got our problems
We all our problems
And sooner or later you'll find out

[Verse 2]
Moving like a player
Do it for the paper
I ain't got no limits like my data
Wait up bring the change
I'm like the waiter
Straight up like my middle finger to a hater
Catch me if you can I just toured France
You can call me Lance
Heard you had some plans
You should cancel them
Come on take a chance
Call up all your friends
Then put on some pants
Wait, fuck am I saying
Don't put on no pants
Know you understand
I'm coming to you now
So high up there's no comedown
Tryna find my way somehow
Hope it works this time around
'Til we're gone we won't find out

[Hook]
Life is short but we in it for the long run
Can't turn it off, especially when we're on one
We're all the same, we all got our problems
We all our problems
And sooner or later you'll find out
That life is short but we in it for the long run
Can't turn it off, especially when we're on one
We're all the same, we all got our problems
We all our problems
And sooner or later you'll find out
