[Verse 1]
She think I give a fuck about it that's the sad part
I could break it down like I got a glass heart
I've been speeding around like I'm in the Nascar
Fast car, Tracy Chapman, fast car
She think I give a fuck about it that's the sad part
Imma give it to her she just gotta ask for it
Maybe add a couple stamps to a passport
And she always look good for me
So here's some cash for it
Ah damn, that shit get expensive
Just like her taste is
Just like her face is
Just like the payments on her crib and the Benz is
Just like my time is yeah that shit get expensive
But I'm here to spend it

[Hook]
She want somebody like me (But she'll never)
She likes somebody like me (Uh huh)
'Cause she knows I'm out of my league (I know)
She can't find somebody like me (No way)
And she wants somebody like me (You know)
She can't find somebody in her league (Uh huh)
And she needs somebody like me
To wait for her
'Cause I need somebody like her

[Verse 2]
Big boat
Bigger bag of weed
And some big smoke
Pick up all the tree
And no give and go
Cut it and I leave
Out the back door
Swimming in the backstroke
And she said I like your vibe
I said me too
I could put some time aside
For them things that we do
And you know I like your style
But she look better naked
If that ass is up for grabs
Imma confiscate it
And she so fucking bad
I gotta leave the lights on
Keep that ass in check
I hit it with the Nikes on
Gotta go
Gotta get that dominoes
Call it mailbox money
Bring the dough right to my door

[Hook]
She want somebody like me (But she'll never)
She likes somebody like me (Uh huh)
'Cause she knows I'm out of my league (I know)
She can't find somebody like me (No way)
And she wants somebody like me (You know)
She can't find somebody in her league (Uh huh)
And she needs somebody like me
To wait for her
'Cause I need somebody like her
