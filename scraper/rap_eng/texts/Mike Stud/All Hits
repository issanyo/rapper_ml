All hits, no misses, this is batting practice bitches
Tryna fall in love with life, I don't need nobody else
It's all hits, ah shit, I don't need nobody help
Feels like everybody else tryna be somebody else
Oh no, oh no, that's some shit I never felt
Bet you can't afford a house but you got a Gucci belt
Oh no, oh, no, that's some shit I never felt
Fuck being cool to you and you I'd rather be myself, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me how bad you really want something
Just tell me how you plan to go and get it
And once you do then don't forget why you started out
Sometimes you lose sight of where you headed
But now they only call when they want something
It ring and ring until they get the message
Brrrrr
Phone jumping like Vince
Brrrrr
They ain't talking 'bout shit
Even if they set a pick I cannot switch
Way before I had a shot I couldn't miss
Swish, ah, they ain't got it like this, nah
You say you want something different but you in the same place
Going out every weekend just to see the same faces
Got your mind so local, cause you in the same state, I can't stay

[Verse 2]
Too much on my plate, I got more to eat
I cannot relate, connect accordingly
Nothing means more to me than loyalty
Gave you all of me and needed more of me, I'm more than me, but
You got caught in all the negatives, its on me
You had inhibitions when you drinking, poured the mourn on me
No matter who I see I swore that you are all I see
What the fuck was wrong with me
Let's take a vacation for all of the days wasted
We're getting weed, we do not mean things that we say faded
But you've been to strange places, deal with them strange faces
You and your friends, getting it in, and my mistake vacant
But then I found some things that I didn't wanna
Now I gotta give it a minute, I'm sorry
Now I gotta go out and get it, I'm gonna
