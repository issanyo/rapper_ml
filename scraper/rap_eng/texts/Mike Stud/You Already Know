See I could tell you about my life, but you already know
I could tell you what it's like, but you already know
I could tell you about these women, you already know
I could tell you how I'm living, you already know
You already know (x3)

[Verse 1]
Okay, I got what you need though
Getting paid just to kick it, Ronaldinho
That's like every motherfucking city we go
Screaming out "fuck you" like I'm Cee-Lo
Oh that's just me though
And I'm just living mine, I ain't got time to be mad at you
You ain't running shit, you got less miles than Baton Rouge
And haters gonna hate, even when they know it's hot
Crowd so fucking big that it look Photoshopped
Homie, but you know it's not
This life so real that it seem fake
Spend the night, have the time of your life like Green Day
And you already know that all these girlies love me
She suck me and she fuck me and she the one that feel lucky
I'm a motherfucking killer, don't be mad at the man
Name a motherfucker realer, don't be mad when you can't
I live every line I write and never made an exception
Started getting paid, they started paying attention
That's real

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, that's just how it goes though
Hardly local, man I got a crib on both coasts
Catch me riding through the city down in SoHo
Got all these bad bitches in my phone though
But you already know so
I'm ready to blow so, I never got it on safety
Whip all black, Donald Sterling would hate me
And I ain't sign nothing, the rumors are mistaken
Labels wanna hit, well shit I got about eight of them
Lawyers on beast mode, ain't nobody playing him
Fuck a single, bitch, I'm about to hit it out the stadium
So let me show you what I've been on, crossover like Iverson
I'm getting faded on the flight, call me Denzel
And they can't believe I'm white, Johnny Manziel
I pray they get well
And is it just me, or is it just me?
And that's just how I feel, you know the deal already
