[Verse 1]
They saying Mike's about to blow though
Tell me something that I don't know
Got the crowd bouncing like Pogos
You can come on the tour bus, just please no photos
'Bout to ride like SoMo, cause we be going off on the off nights
Cause I been on, I been on, every single song I put my pen on
No, they don't know
Or maybe they starting to
Cause I work so hard that it's hard to lose
Top spot I'm taking that, face the facts
Got a bottle in my hand, I'm facing that
Cause if winning is a habit then I've been an addict
Every night is cinematic when you roll with us
And we won't live forever, but I will remember when I met you

[Hook]
When I met you in the summer and I came to your town
We fell in love, then we burned it to the ground
And we could be together, baby
But I gotta leave soon
And everybody's listening now
But we got nothing to lose
When I met you in the summer (x3)

[Verse 2]
Summertime with your fine ass
Merlot in that wine glass
She dope as hell, from Jersey baby
White girl but her curves are crazy
And she up all night like Adderall
She like sushi too, we compatible
And these others guys average so they mad
Cause they know I'm ill like a dragon roll
Got cover girls in my room, but they don't need no makeup though
They just tryna party, live too fast to take it slow
Got summer flings and these summer things
But we just making memories
Just promise you'll remember me and the time -

[Hook]
