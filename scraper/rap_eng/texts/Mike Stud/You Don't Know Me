[Intro: Tarik]
Do you feel me, yo?
You don't know me, you-you don't know me (come on)
Oh yeah (never will, never will)
You don't know me, you-you don't know me
Oh yeah (listen), oh yeah

[Verse 1: Tarik]
Now if I told you my story would you understand
Or would you just turn away like I'm a homeless man
Mommy saying what if music fails, you need another plan
I'm just trying to hold it together like a rubber band
Cause see I'm constantly hearing about how people change
But I got dreams that's bigger than women and fame
Not to mention I got these goals I got to obtain
Guess I'm hoping that getting money can heal all my pain
I'm saying I ain't trying to see my mom stressing over bills no more
So I'm going to rap til I don't know how it feel no more
Cause that's awfully hard to cope with, for now hopeless
Is about the only thing keeping me focused
Wondering when it's going to end like a slow shift
Get a check and go broke quick damn that gets old quick
That's why I got to make a dope hit before these doors close quick
Now wait look how they out here taking shots, you know free throwing
And girls dropping to their knees but they ain't Tebowing
Now how I do business when distracted by pleasure
How I know I'll be rewarded for all of my effort
What if I don't get recognition for all my records
And what if I'm the answer to all my questions
But see I never been a loser
I ain't into that so next time you quick to criticize me
You can consider that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
See when everything is right doesnâ€™t matter at all
Cause I ain't scared of heights, I'm terrified of the fall
And all those lonely night I dreamt of having it all
But once it's all gone who do we have to call?
Nah none of y'all, that's for damn sure
But I'm the reason for the party on the dance floor
This ain't a sing along or a party track
This is music from the heart, no cardiac
So listen close, what I say what I mean
Cause everything you see isn't what it seems
Cause we all have dream of a better place
But it's tough to go big when you're feather weight
So would you listen if I told you I was scared
And that I wish the injury never put me here
Yeah I guess we all got a lot to learn
Cause not a day goes by that I'm not concerned
And like LeBron I got a lot of work in front of me
I got a lot to live up to after 23
Right, cause with the gift is a curse
But before you judge you should listen up first
Cause you don't know I'm a middle class kid
And that I work my whole life to get where I've been
Nah nothing handed on a silver platter
Just a true story, in this dream I'm after

[Hook]
