[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Hell nah I ain't sleep today but I'mma be okay
Miss my family on the east, but fuck it I can't leave L.A
Every meeting that I be in, trust me I just lead the way
I fucked three times before 3 today, piece of cake
Never gave a fuck about what the teacher say, cause either way
I'mma just do me and she said me too, I said "s'il vous pla√Æt"
Walking out the club with me and TMZ is out here
Ain't no secret safe
If that's your girl, why's she in my section?
If that's your girl, why's she doing role play
Going both ways like an intersection?
Stole her like an interception
But you can have her back she asks a million questions

[Hook: Mike Stud]
Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one

Stro, Talk to me

[Verse 2: Marcus Stroman]
Everything I see up in my head just comes to life
Got my day-ones rollin' round with me on every single flight
Yeah that's right, that's my life
Spoil everyone that's with me
Made it rain in Vegas with the MVP, J.D. no whiskey
And lately I've been stressing because I just miss my family
They see the smiles but never the pain and all the success they see
Allegedly there's some stereotypes I don't like about my height
Trademark HDMH for life, yeah that's right so I copyright
Prove 'em wrong, prove myself right
Cloudy days, smile so bright, 14 lifts, 7 days, fortnight (yikes)
I can't lie, I been on a mission
To make every single doubter eat their words up in their kitchen
Yeah, my vision is to get it while I'm living
I'll keep winning
Legendary comeback, ACL incision, yeah

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
I've been doing great I guess I can't complain
I don't think about yesterday
Every move is calculated, this shit ain't no guessing game
Only time I'm second place is when I'm at my second place
Made 300 then doubled that, I guess you call that 2nd base
How many come ups until it's destiny, eh
How many come ups until it's meant to be, eh
I hear them talking, that don't get to me
That ain't shit to me, same dude, different dream
This is me
This is me

[Bridge: Mike Stud]
Ain't nothing pretty but her face
Money hungry, nothing skinny but her waist
She come from money, but she spent it on her titties and her face, all
If you really wanna know, these women, man they come and go.... eh
Cause one minute she's the one, the next you really never know.... eh, eh
Cause she don't know a damn thing about love
She don't know a damn thing, at all
Cause one minute she's the one
The next you really never know
Girls these days

[Hook: Mike Stud]
Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one

[Outro: Mike Stud & Marcus Stroman]
Girls these days, these days, these days, these days
You ready?
Girls these days
Girls these days
These days
