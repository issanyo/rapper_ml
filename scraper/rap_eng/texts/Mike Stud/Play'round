[Hook: Vory]
Say
Yeah, play round, play round
I'm not the one who gon' play round
'Til we pull up its a lay down
I treat the Wraith like a playground
Play round, play round
I'm not the guy who gon' play round
I'm not the one who gon' play round
I got hitters with me who don't play round

[Verse 1: Vory]
Popping these perc with activists
I could be gone any day now
I should be dead any day now
These niggas be tough on the gram
But they really be bitches
And my niggas don't play round
Same hoes who had fronted on me
Now it's funny they all in my face now
And they ain't got nothing to say now
Tell 'em mask off, turn her face down
She like Vory, you gonna blow any day now
I'm like girl you be all in the way now
Tell a nigga to watch what he say now

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
New brain, new Goyard bag... white
Lately I've been in my bag
I've been in my lane, I've been in my lane I'm saying
They say that they in but they only in the way
That's just what it is, I'm sorry, I'm real sorry
Got me feeling froggy
Yeah, instead of taking leaps I take a jump
Even run if I fucking want
We could kick it, and never punt
We could leave if you want
Put some leaves in a blunt
If I fall I bounce back like 2-3, then I dunk, then I dunk

[Hook: Mike Stud]
Yeah, play round, play round
I'm not the one who gon' play round
I don't have too much to say now
You knew this would come any day now
Play round, play round
I treat the Porsche like a playground
Got some people in here that don't play about me

They don't play about me now
Got Rolls Royce on email
