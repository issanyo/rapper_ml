[Intro]
Every girl got it
You just gotta get it out her

[Hook]
She got it in her so I gotta get it out her
She got it in her so I had to get it out her
She got it in her, yeah I had to get it out her
She got it in her, yeah I had to get it out her
She dirty dancing so I took her in the shower
Bust it bust it bust it for her now
Then I bust it 'til she blossom like a flower
Then I burn some when I skrrt in the baller

[Verse 1]
Eddie Bauer in the expedition we were cruising
We was up at Ratty's, went the same as if they knew me
Different breed, and I'm a different motherfucking human
So if you wanna be a freak then I'm the one to do it
Yeah, I just had to get it out of her
I been on a power trip, mmhmmh
I could pull it out of ya, who knew

She got it in her, she got it in her
She got it in her, she got it in her

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she got it in her, in a beamer
Sexy broads in a car, I'm in between them
Barely breathing, but I ain't leaving
'Cause the view, oh the view, yeah it's scenic
And that's put them on the vibe you should see it
Couple bitches arguing over my penis
A couple licks, you need some freaks, I got 'em feening
I couple licks of this and now they in agreement

[Bridge]
Yeah, I ain't mad at all, I ain't mad at all
Told them pull my pants down, you could have a ball
I ain't mad at all, I ain't mad at all
Told them pull my pants down, you can have a ball
I ain't mad at all, I ain't mad at all
Told that bitch that there's a chance, you can have it all
You can have it all, you can have it all

[Pre-Hook]
She got it in her so I gotta get it out her
She talking dirty so I took her in the shower
(?) turn around cause I'm special
I'm going in 'cause I gotta get it out her
Had to dig a little deeper, but I found it
Cut the waves, she just wanna be around it
And it ain't about the money or the power

[Hook]
She got it in her so I gotta get it out her
She got it in her so I gotta get it out her
She got it in her so I gotta get it out her

She got it in her so I gotta get it out her
She got it in her so I gotta get it out her
She got it in her, she got it in her
She got it in her, she got it in her
