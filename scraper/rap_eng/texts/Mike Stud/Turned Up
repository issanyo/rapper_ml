[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
I got bitches going wild, you'd have to see it to believe it
Forget the meet and greet I'm signing titties with my semen
So you can keep the sharpie, need it hardly
Leave the party with a bunch of girlies
Get to know 'em later on cause we fucking early
And I like to stay on schedule
Photoshoot fresh homie I deserve a centerfold
Parties at the W, sorry if that troubles you
But this is my summer, 'bout to blow up like a bubble do
Catch me where the bottles is, texting with a model chick
Bar's about to close, yeah I bet you know what time it is
Speeding down the interstate, riding 'round like Reagan did
Trucks is all black, skating 'round like Tyler Seguin bitch
And if you want it, be about it
Fucked an actress last week and didn't even tweet about it, yeah
I'm just out here on the come-up, fuck sleep
I'm making moves until the sun up

[Hook: French Montana] (x2)
Wake up in the morning, roll up out the bed
We be turned up, she don’t wanna leave
Can’t blame her, we be turned up

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
When you start to get love, a lot of people get critical
They sayin' fuck me, well the bitches took it literal
And she like the way that molly felt, blacked out like karate belts
Shit I'm just doin' me, hate to boast but I gotta
Gotta go, sayonara, on a boat, Boston bomber
Yeah I'm hotter now
New watch and the clock says my time is now
That's why I'm out in Hollywood meeting Simon Cowell
And I'm kinda sorta buzzing now, every night another city I am shutting down
I swear that's word to French man, I'm tryna be a player, fuck the bench man
We 'bout to turn up

[Hook: French Montana] (x2)
