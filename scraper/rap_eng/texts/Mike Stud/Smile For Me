[Intro]
Smile for me (x2)

[Verse 1]
She was daddy's little girl, came from a small town
The type of chick that everybody would talk about
Only 19, but her body was mean: she was a beauty queen
So she moved to Hollywood to pursue a dream
And just like she thought she would, she hit it big
Signed a deal, and every day she had a gig
It was crazy all the sudden, she had all the success now
But the pressure had her stressed out
And she was always getting drunk now, always in the club now
With all the cool new friends, who had the drugs round
So they would skip the lines, then they'd sniff the lines
And pretty soon, she was doing this shit all the time
And it was cool; at least she thought it was
Till she couldn't smile without all the drugs
She was a beautiful girl, but inside she was hurting
That's why she's hiding cuts all under her David Yurmans

It's okay not to be okay, it's okay not to be okay sometimes (x2)
Smile for me, smile for me
Everything gon' be just fine
Smile for me, smile for me
Everything gon' be just fine

[Verse 2]
See, he was born in a football town
Was the kind of kid who never put his football down
See, his mama was a teacher and his pops used to play
Back in the day, was top quarterback in the state
But hey, nowadays his son's wearing that letterman
Pops been drilling him his whole life to play like a veteran
And damn, all of these touchdowns have always been part of the plan
But that plan wasn't his
Life feeling like a lie, he was scared he couldn't live any longer
That's why them pain meds getting stronger
The same ones that he said for his shoulder
Thoughts in his head getting colder
Cause his reality was too embarrassing to let his parents in
And anybody at all, he had nobody to call
They wouldn't get it or accept it
So he filled his mouth up with pills so they'd never know

[Bridge]
Feeling like I'm falling down, falling down
And I'm calling out, calling out
Feel like I'm falling
Smile for me
Feeling like I'm falling down, falling down
And I'm calling out, calling
Smile for me

[Hook]
