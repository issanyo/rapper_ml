I got a hotel suite you can slide on through
Hard D, soft sheets you can climb onto
We was jumping out a plane
Jumping off of boats
Same night, same chicks we be jumping off the most
If you want me to stay, then tell me to stay
You know if I'm running away, I'll show you the way
You know I took one in the face, ain't nothing to say
You know we been jumping off the most

Got me on the champagne
