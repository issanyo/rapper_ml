[Intro]
Why, why you make me think twice?
Why you make me biased?
Why you make me pick sides?
I ain't like none of these guys
Oh, why?
Why, why you make me think twice?
Why you telling me lies?
Why you pick up the dice?
I ain't like none of these guys?
Oh, why?

[Verse 1]
When the tables turn
You gotta judge me wrong 'til the case adjourned
Wanna join that club gotta wait your turn
Can't write me off if the pages turned
In the catalog see a whole lot of you's I can have 'em all
But I don't want to because we had it all
We could have it all

[Hook]
But why, my question is why?
Posting pictures of your titties for some likes
My question is why?
Nice girl, nice hair, nice ass
Why you care about likes?
My question is why?
Why you tryna sell yourself ?
What you tryna tell yourself?
Why you gotta hear it from someone else?
My question is why you tryna sell yourself?
What you tryna tell yourself?
Why you gotta hear it from someone else?
My question is why?

[Verse 2]
Checks are fat they looking phony
Change the jacket couldn't phone me
Check the stats I'm feeling lonely
Get back to back practice homie
We ain't mean to leave you there babe
Find your place I'll meet you there maybe
Just one thing before I go
Let me know

[Pre-Hook]
My question is why?
Why you gotta be like this?
Why you gotta be stuck on that bullshit?
Why it gotta feel like this?
Why you gotta stunt like that?
This is no good for my health
How you gonna post a pic in my bed for someone else?

[Hook]
Why, my question is why?
Posting pictures of your titties for some likes
My question is why?
Nice girl, nice hair, nice ass
Why you care about likes?
My question is why?
Why you tryna sell yourself ?
What you tryna tell yourself?
Why you gotta hear it from someone else?
My question is why you tryna sell yourself?
What you tryna tell yourself?
Why you gotta hear it from someone else?
My question is why?

[Verse 3]
Don't talk much these days no way
I ain't with the he say she say
Party on a weekday
Every party is a motherfucking weekday
And you got work in the morning
No you don't cause you sleep in every fucking morning
And you do it cause you can
They really got you feeling that important
Got you jumping out the bed like a Jordan
But you only forth for the clout
Or you know it's gonna come even though you can't afford it
Let your body wanna take you fucking here and there
And everywhere
But I'm right here
Yeah, I'm right here

[Outro]
My question is why, why?
