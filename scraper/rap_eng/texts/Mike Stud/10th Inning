[Hook]
Mixed women, mixed drinks for them mixed feelings
Big cribs with them big ceilings
Big plays with them big names in them big buildings; that's big business
Hit town, well that's big pimpin'
My potential, that's infinite
Pen game insane, make hits like Ken Griffey in the 10th inning
Fucked around and fell in love with it

[Bridge]
Don't worry what they sayin' baby they don't really know us
Been a player then everything changed up the day you showed up
Bite the bullet I know that you like the feeling, so what?
And you know that it's going down, every time I pull up

[Hook]
Mixed women, mixed drinks for them mixed feelings
Big cribs with them big ceilings
Big plays with them big names in them big buildings; that's big business
Hit town, well that's big pimpin'
My potential, that's infinite
Pen game insane, make hits like Ken Griffey in the 10th inning

Fucked around and fell in love with it
If you didn't know x2

[Verse 1]
Looked around and see no limits
My phone's got no limits on those minutes because I go get it
Things change but I go with them
Big waves with no swimmin'
Money money, I dove in it
Now you know I'm a go-getter
My shows be so lit like glowsticks and you know this
Because I noticed that you noticed
This your last notice
Won't show my hand, I'm not folding
Like you know this

[Bridge]
Don't worry what they sayin' baby they don't really know us
Been a player then everything changed up they ain't showed up
Bite the bullet I know that you like the feeling, so what?
And you know that it's going down, every time I pull up

[Hook] x2
