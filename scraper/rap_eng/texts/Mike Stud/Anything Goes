[Hook: IamG]
I'm living life, got no regrets
Parade of bottles on my own express
We in the club got a couple blizzies rolled
My life looking like a TV show
When anything goes (goes)
In this bitch cause the bottles all gold
When anything goes (goes)
Couple bad bitches, whole crew getting throwed
When anything goes

[Verse 1: IamG]
Light, light, light, light it up
Whole crew in the club giving not a fuck
8 bottles on the way, that's a turn up
I'm doing me cause that's the only one you gotta love
That's real
Said she rolling for the night
Ain't the type to mix a vodka with her Sprite
Yeah, yeah
This is how it goes down
Shawty ain't a boxer but she tryna go rounds
Anything goes
Saw you got a man thought I didn't know, oh
So whatcha gon' do for me honey?
I be working for the money when we fucking up the country like

I'm living life, got no regrets

In this bitch cause the bottles all gold

Couple bad bitches, whole crew getting throwed
When anything goes [Mike Stud: When anything goes...]

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
...when I'm in the casa
Always on the wave, little Sprite in my vodka
In the back room breaking bread over pasta
Just closed a deal so I'm getting the lobster
So don't wait a second cause I am the one
I am what's up
Only thing I do not try is my luck
Cause if it makes sense then the commas will come
So just shut up and hop in my truck (like woo)
Smoking out the window
Phone jumping out the gym though
Liquor got me leaning like I'm fucking playing limbo
I ain't into flexing less it is what it is though

[Hook: IamG]
I'm living life, got no regrets
Parade of bottles on my own express

My life looking like a TV show
When anything goes (goes)
In this bitch cause the bottles all gold
When anything goes (goes)
Couple bad bitches, whole crew getting throwed
When anything goes

[Bridge: IamG]
Anything I do I do it big leagues
Tell a hatin' nigga let my dick breathe
Popping bottles you know you can't even get these
Got a 5 star when I pull off in my 6 speed
Yeah, that's how we murk off
Anything goes at the first call
Bitches at the crib one bird call
And they all about they business, put that work on
I'm juiced, stay leanin'
Your bitch stay fiendin'
My watch stay gleamin'
You the nigga that be gone by the weekend

Couple bad bitches, whole crew getting throwed
When anything goes
When anything goes
When anything goes
