[Intro: T-Pain]

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Look, I'm determined to blow, and you learn as you go
But now I'm ready, got my drive in the Chevy, hold it down like a levee
I'm on the come-up, practice makes perfect
So I've been living like a star on purpose
Yeah, my flow crisp like Coco
These other dudes are J.D. cause they're just so-so
Charismatic, I'm everything you can't be
The haters need a wheelchair, cause they can't stand me
Watch your girl, there's a lot of things you can't see
She swallow me in the morning, I'm her Plan B
I'm hungry, I'm eating off a big plate
I forget better lines than you put on your mixtape
Never give a fuck, I guess I'm not a slut
I'm just kicking dope lines for free
And I flipped the script in this bitch
Now all the labels in the game, they trying to get signed with me

[Outro: T-Pain]
