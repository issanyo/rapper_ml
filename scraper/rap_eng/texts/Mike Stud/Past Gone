[Verse 1]
Now let me tell you about a girl I know
Well not really, I met her on a tour stop outside of Philly
She was front row, reached her hand so I could feel it
I kept lookin' at her, she knew every single lyric
It was dope
I stuck around after the show to go and kick it with the fans
Who come to see us on the road
It was all love
Bunch of pictures and hugs
But that's when I learned just how different she was
See she was 19 and addicted to drugs
And almost died last year
Sometimes she wishes she was
And she was cryin'
Her brother was with her, he came too
He nodded and he said that everything she's saying's true
And then she said tonight was the best night of her life
And even if it didn't last, right now it feels right
I looked her in the eyes, and put it on my life
That we gon' work on this together
And she gon' be alright, I know

[Hook]
So when you feel alone in the night time
Just know that you ain't ever on your own
Cause every body goes through the low oh ohs
And I just want you to know oh
Just know that I believe in you
Like you believe in me
Just know that I believe in you
Like you believe in me
Like you believe in me
Yeah, yeah, like you believe in me

[Verse 2]
See things happen in crazy ways
I swear to god since that day I've changed my ways
Now every day when I wake up I reach over
Grab my phone, send a text to her
To let her know she's not alone
And I promise that I won't forget
Cause on the real, it's so sad, she's so depressed
And through our daily conversations
What I've learned about depression
Is that it's hard to know the answers when you don't know the questions
Cause she don't understand why she feels the way she does
No matter what she tries, man it never is enough
And a few months back for one night
I felt the pain that she felt her whole life
Cause she called and said that she was ready to go
And said thanks for everything, but she was ready to go
I said please don't, there's something you gotta know
I wrote a song about you, and this is how it goes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It was five hours later when we hung up
She was tired and the sun was startin' to come up
But yo, we spent that whole night just talkin' it through
And at that point, there wasn't much more I could do
But what I did say, is that she needed to promise me
She wouldn't do anything crazy without callin' me
And so far, man things have been better
We talk way less cause things have been better
And last time she called was my birthday night
And it was the best gift i've gotten in my life
She said remember that time when you sang me that song
Without that night, I'd be way past gone
So, thank you

[Hook]
