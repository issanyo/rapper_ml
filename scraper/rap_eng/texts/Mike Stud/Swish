[Verse 1]
My bitch got a body like Alba
What up dog? I'm the alpha
So you better watch out, bruh
And that goes for anyone around us
Planted the money tree with my only fuckin' seed
Now it's sproutin'
Never had a fuck to give, so I see (Damn)
No fuckin' point in countin'
That's for my accountant, he's good at countin'
Only thing the crib don't got is a fuckin' fountain
So I need a fountain
Tuey so high up that I feel like I live on a mountain
And I'm so high right now I feel like I'm on a mountain
I'm ridin' 'round in a brand new town
With the same old crew that I started with
Yeah the same dudes that I started with (Same ones)
I'm talkin' way back from the start of it
That's the come-up starter kit
Yeah you gotta get it who you want it with
And I'm Mike Trout cause I don't strike out
I switched up, now I'm pitchin' hits
I switched up, now I flip the script
Now my agent send me scripts (Dang right)
And everybody say I need a deal soon
I ain't really gonna make a deal soon
Cause the TV show 'bout to pop off so
I ain't really gotta make a deal soon, nah

[Hook]
I went lookin' for trouble
Found nothin' I didn't like
I went lookin' for trouble
So that's what I'm 'bout to get tonight
Got damn (Whoo!)
Who you know got it like this?
Who you know party like this?
Takin' shots at the bar like swish
Damn (Whoo!)
Who you know got it like this?
Who you know party like this?
Takin' shots at the bar like swish

[Verse 2]
Signin' deals without a label involved
The size of the checks, you would think that I was still playin' some ball
That's a lot of money (Yeah)
Baby that's a stretch
Shit, maybe I should stretch cause you know I'm 'bout to run it
And if I ever said it then you know I prolly done it
And I'm still your favorite pitcher cause I'm keepin' it a hundred like yeah
I'm not a douche, I just do shit
This is more to me than music
You can only run the game if the shoe fits
And the pen to the page is the blueprint
And when the game's on the line, I'm the stencil (Whoo!)
Left my prints on the field like I'm Cecil
Just touched down in Beantown like a lentil (Whoo!)
Smokin' out the window in the rental, yeah
And I'm wingin' it, you'd think I had a few Red Bulls, yeah (Swish!)
And my schedule's hectic so that shit's essential, yeah
And I throw back so many drinks I'm feelin' retro, yeah
But it's a new era, no Mitchell and Ness though

[Hook]
I went lookin' for trouble
Found nothin' I didn't like
I went lookin' for trouble
So that's what I'm 'bout to get tonight
Got damn (Whoo!)
Who you know got it like this?
Who you know party like this?
Takin' shots at the bar like swish
Damn (Whoo!)
Who you know got it like this?
Who you know party like this?
Takin' shots at the bar like swish

[Verse 3]
You can see it all if the view's right
I've been goin' up quite a few flights
Nah I ain't fallin' off but you might
True life and I finally got the tunes right
Better cop that shit, red and blue lights
Takin' bottles to the face like I'm Shoenice
Yeah that's that shit that I do like
Nah I ain't gonna puke but Blue might, you right, uhyuuu
[Pukes] You good? (Yeah)
Turned my life into a lifestyle
That's my life now
Got people tattin' up their skin with every word I write down
Got me like, "Wow"
I guess I'm the one to keep your eye on
In my top five, I'm Dylan
And Dylan and Dylan and Dylan
If my girl Gisele then I'm Tom
And now I'm on your TV screen like, "Hi mom"
Got Gerry up on TMZ like, "Hi mom" (Hi mom)
Swear to God I'm not high, mom
Wait, okay, sorry I lied, mom
Man I told my father I'd be goin' farther
Cause my flows are harder than a throw from Rowengarter
Broke both my arms and now they both are stronger
Then I dip like Copenhagen, oh my God and...

[Hook]
I went lookin' for trouble
Found nothin' I didn't like
I went lookin' for trouble
So that's what I'm 'bout to get tonight
Got damn
Who you know got it like this?

Takin' shots at the bar like swish
Damn

Who you know party like this?
Takin' shots at the bar like swish
