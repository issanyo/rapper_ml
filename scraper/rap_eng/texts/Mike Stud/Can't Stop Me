[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
I got 2 major hits bitch, I know you heard of them
Yes this the 3rd of them, aha, I murder them
Running on the track, matter of fact, I am hurdlin'
Cause I am Vinny chasing my dreams and they all Turtlin' hah
And I do it for my city, my tracks get spins the way I'm feeling dizzy
Damn and I grind till I get mine, so I keep it on the real like a fish line
Nah, I ain't saying I'm the greatest, but I'm blowing I think it's time that we face it
Now I'm practically famous, constant interviews and never ending arrangements
White tee fresh snapback running through these lines like a motherfucking half back
And I'm making them duck, no aflack
Mike Stud bitch, the new face of frat rap

[Hook: Missy Modell]
Knock me down and I'll get up
Turn me off and I'll go up
Never stopping down, never breaking down
Cause you can't stop me
Knock me down and I'll get up
Turn me off and I'll go up
Never stopping down, never breaking down
Cause you can't stop me

[Verse 2: Mike Stud]
Okay, you can catch me in the spot, never stop, in the studio
Never gonna flop no I'm not, Ricky Rubio
And I am on a roll, no sushi though
I be killing tracks man I got that call of duty flow
Flow right, never lefty
Don't test me, bars like Nestle
And I'm a jerk, for whatever it's worth
I wear a suit in the booth, cause I'm ready to work, boy
Flow nuts homie, like cashew
And soon I will be running the game like Nash do
Zoom right past you, swag top notch
Bounce around the map like I'm playing fucking hopscotch
But life is just a busy road, we doing city shows
And shooting videos
I don't got time for you, it only took 6 months and I signed with nue, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
Hey, hey, hey, look
Something for you ear drum
I know the haters talking but I don't really hear them
So I'm flier than a pilot
Making a lot of noise, I'll retire when it's quiet
But I mean, I really don't see that happening any time soon though
Cause I got hits on deck, biatch, haha
Oh, oh, yeah

[Outro: Mike Stud]
Jon K on the track, Missy Modell just making the track real sexy
Yeah it's Mike Stud homie
