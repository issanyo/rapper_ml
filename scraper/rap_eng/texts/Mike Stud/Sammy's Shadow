[Intro]
“Don’t know why I love you
Don’t know why I love you”

[Verse 1]
Sammy’s shadow never leaves me
These other women can’t seem to appease me
Sammy was a girl that I fell in love with, typical club chick, that had more flavor than a Sunkist
Met her in September, wifed her by November
Dated one semester, left her then forget her
Calculated moves, socialite agenda
Didn’t care for you, I was her favorite letter
Hair done, with the makeup nice
Wifed up but she was more like the breakup type
Always hit the club, didn’t worry ’bout a backlash
Life full of problems, I ain’t talking math class
Fightin’ every night, never needed that trash
Left just to come back, whole lot of packed bags
Sorority chick, didn’t like it but did it in spite
Of just to feel important and shit
Always worried ’bout how she looked
Got good grades for the status but didn’t give a fuck about the books
They say emotions run deep, she never let them show
Drown ‘em out, she drinking on a steady flow
‘Cause the cover up couldn’t cover up enough
Good skin, the cover up was just a bluff
Sexy in a dress nonetheless, she still shy
Confidence was low - had to wear her heels high
Sammy never was an easy fix, always quittin’
Chick would up and leave me quick
Always bitchin’, always on some needy shit
Selfish, never came to see me pitch
Uh, and I hated her for that
I needed her to be there
And I hated her for that
I broke up with Sammy, couldn’t wait to leave
Told her what I thought, emotions on the sleeve
Fast-forward a year, life’s a lot different
Top of the world but something still missing, yeah
Y’all know the half of that
Whatever we had, can we have it back?

[Outro]
“I’m just a lonely man, like my sanity
Wishing I could find a match, my mind ain’t what it used to be…"
“Don’t know why I love you
Don’t know why I love you”
