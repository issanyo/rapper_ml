[Verse 1: Queen Latifah, Brandy, Patti Labelle]
Oh, I've been down about a time or two
But You picked me right back up again
When I reached out for You, oh Lord
You brought me strength to my weakest parts
You showed me the way, yes oh Lord
I'm so glad I trust You
And now all I can say is...

[Chorus: All, Patti Labelle]
Oh, Lord! Thank You for loving me
Oh, Lord! Thank You for giving me
Your grace and your mercy
Through my darkest days
Thank You, oh, Lord

[Verse 2: Queen Latifah, Brandy, Patti Labelle]
With You, life I can win
No matter what, I'm going through
I just take time to breathe
And realize all you've done for me
I'm grateful for friends, I'm grateful for love
I'm grateful for music and the stars above
I'm so glad I trust You
And now all I can say is...

[Chorus: All, Patti Labelle]
Oh, Lord! Thank You for loving me
Oh, Lord! Thank You for giving me
Your grace and your mercy
Through my darkest days
Thank You, oh, Lord

[Bridge: All, Queen Latifah, Brandy, Patti Labelle]
You saved my life
From the darkness and the anger
You saved my life
From the weakness and the pain
You saved my life
Over and over and over again, Lord
You saved my life
And now all I can say...

[Chorus: All, Brandy, Patti Labelle]
Oh, Lord! (Oh, Lord) Thank You for loving me (Yeah)
Oh, Lord! (Oh, Lord) Thank You for giving me (Your grace)
Your grace (And your mercy) and your mercy
Through my darkest days
Thank You, oh, Lord (Oh Lord)

[Outro: Patti Labelle]
Oh Lord, I thank You for everything you have done for me
