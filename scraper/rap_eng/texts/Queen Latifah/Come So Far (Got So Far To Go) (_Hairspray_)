Hey old friend let's look back, on the crazy clothes we wore
Ain't it fun to look back, and to see it's all been done before?
All those nights together, are a special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow, just as long as you're dancing next to me

'Cause it's so clear, every year, we get stronger (stronger)
What's gone is gone, the past is the past
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go (ooo)
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow (ooo)
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go
(oh yeah)(hey yeah) (oh, oh)

Hey old friend together, side-by-side and year-by-year
The road was filled with twists and turns, oh, but that's the road that got us here
Let's move past the bad times, but before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget and learn from the mistakes we made

'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger (stronger)
So don't give up and don't say when
And just get back on the road again 'cause

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go (ooo)
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow (ooo)
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go
(oh, yeah)(hey yeah)(oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh)

Hey old friend come along for the ride
There's plenty of room, so jump inside (jump inside)
The highway's rocky every now and then (yeah, yeah)
But it's so much better than where I've been

Just keep movin' at your own speed
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need (so you need)
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone (yeah)
We got so far to go!
(woah oh)(yeah)

Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger (stronger)
So shine that light, (ooo)
Take my hand (ooo)
Let's dance into the promise land 'cause

I know we've come so far but we've got so far to go (ooo)
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long 'til it's time to go
So most days we'll take it fast and some nights we'll take it slow (ooo)
I know we've come so far, but baby, baby we've got so far to go
(hey yeah)

Baby, baby, ooo, (hey)
Baby, baby we've got so far to go
Baby, baby, ooo, (oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh)
Baby, baby we've got so far to go
Baby, baby, ooo, (yeah, yeah)(welcome to the 60's)
Baby, baby we've got so far to go
Baby, baby, ooo, (oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh)
Baby, baby we've got so far to go (welcome to the 60's)(come on, lets go, baby)
Baby, baby, ooo, (oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh)
Baby, baby we've got so far to go (welcome to the 60's)(come along for the ride)
Baby, baby, ooo
Baby, baby we've got so far to go (yeah)(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
