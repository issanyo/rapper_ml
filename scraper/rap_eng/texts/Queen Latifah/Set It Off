[Verse 1]
Do we look? Where is love?
Has it gone? Do we search or move on?
Hear the wind as it blows
And my heart says the next time I'll know

[Chorus]
Set it off, I suggest, y'all
Set it off, I suggest, y'all
Set it off, come on now, set it off
Set it off on the left, y'all
Set it off on the right, y'all
Set it off
Come on now, set it off

[Verse 2]
Holding on, friends around
All together searching for a way out
When it's time, will we know
Or will life grant us no second try?

[Chorus]
Set it off, I suggest, y'all
Set it off, I suggest, y'all
Set it off, come on now, set it off
Set it off on the left, y'all
Set it off on the right, y'all
Set it off
Come on now, set it off

[Bridge]
(Now it's too late to work it out)
Now it's too late to work it out
I'm in too deep to just pull out
(There ain't no way I'll walk away)
There ain't no way I'll turn away
Nothing to do but set it off

[Chorus]
Set it off, I suggest, y'all
Set it off, I suggest, y'all
Set it off, come on now, set it off
Set it off on the left, y'all
Set it off on the right, y'all
Set it off
Come on now, set it off

[Andrea Martin]
Me hear police, them a chat about me just one time
Me live the life, love money, that's two crimes
What will be my destiny? Hey, hey
Me say silly of me to think that I could
Ever get away with crime
What will I do, hey

[Queen Latifah]
When they come for you, check it
I ain't got nowhere to go, nothin' to lose, I'm lost
Who rydin' for Cleo?
Hot like ultra reels with my back to the wall
I put my gat on all y'all
Replace your player’s ball with a 911 call
Situations I’ve been in got me capable of sinnin'
You grinnin'? Watch me Speed Stick ya ass like Mennen
Lettin' it off, settin' it off in the beginning
Pinnin' these ill rhymes, representin' ill women
Set it
