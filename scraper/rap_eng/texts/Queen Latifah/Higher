[Intro]
Ah, la, la, la
Oh, yeah
Higher
Higher
Ooh, oh
Mm-mm
We gonna do this a little different
Higher, higher
We gonna switch it up a little bit, y'all
Y'all ready?

[Verse 1]
Everlasting love
Never-ending trust is all
My heart could want
Yeah
Heaven must've heard my prayers above
'Cause I needed you so much

[Bridge]
In the darkness, I
See your light
Oh, the blessing that you feel is real
Feel you in my soul
And I know
(Uh-huh)
I really need you in my life
Showing me the way

[Hook]
That love can take me
Higher
You keep on lifting me
Higher
Your love keeps taking me
Higher
It's getting deeper and deeper
Higher
You keep on lifting me
Higher
Your love keeps taking me
Higher
Keeping me up, higher

[Verse 2]
You're so beautiful
It's so powerful the way
You've changed my life
Undeniably inspired love, oh
Forever you and I


[Bridge]
In the darkness, I
See your light
Oh, the blessing that you feel is real
Feel you in my soul
And I know
(Uh-huh)
I really need you in my life
Showing me the way

[Hook]
That love can take me
Higher
You keep on lifting me
Higher
Your love keeps taking me
Higher
It's getting deeper and deeper
Higher
You keep on lifting me
Higher
Your love keeps taking me
Higher
Keeping me up, higher


[Outro x5]
Higher
You keep on lifting me
Higher
Your love keeps taking me
Higher
Keeping me up, higher
