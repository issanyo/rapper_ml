Close your eyes
And rest your tired body next to mine
Nobody knows more than you
These hard times that we're living through
But Baby we'll go on and on
Hey) Lord knows, we've got each other

So kiss me, kiss me hard and long
Hard times, we can get over (Yeah)

Now the sun, (yeah) it must rise
And she's coming with a bag of tricks
With treats and dirty lies
Nobody smiles, nobody cries
And no one seems to care if they live or die

But Baby we'll go on and on
Lord knows, Lord knows we have got each other (Yeah)

So come on and kiss me, kiss me hard and long
(Ooh) Hard times, we can get over

Ballots and boxes, bullets and guns
And the outlaw, the outlaw always runs and runs
(Yeah he does)
But Baby, just you come, come to me
Come to me, come to me, come to me, Baby
(When) Whenever you need me

So kiss me hard
Lay some kisses on me baby 'cause I need you and you know
That these hard times, we can get over
