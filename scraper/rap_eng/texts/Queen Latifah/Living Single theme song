We are living (Ooh)
Single (Hey)
Yes, we're living the single life, yeah

We are living (Hey)
Single (Ooh,
And in a nineties kind of world
I'm glad I got my girls)

Keep your head up, what?
Keep your head up, that's right
Whenever this life get tough, you gotta fight
With my homegirls standing to my left and my right
True blue, it's tight like glue

We are living (Hey)
Single
(And in a nineties kind of world
I'm glad I got my girls)
Haaaa
