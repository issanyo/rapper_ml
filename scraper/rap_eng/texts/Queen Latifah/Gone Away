I try to reason and tell myself you'll return
But you are gone and I know, I know, I know you're gone
You were mine for only a minute
And if I hurt you I didn't intend it

You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind
You're not gonna stay
But I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby
I lost you, baby, you were gone

Forgive and forget it that's not what I'll ask you to do
Cause I want you back, yeah
You know, you know I want you back
And in concluding my mental discussion
I found I lost my prized possession

You are gone away, I keeptellin' my mind
You're not gonna stay
And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby
I lost you, baby, you were gone

You were mine for only a minute
And if I hurt you I didn't intend it

You are gone away, I keeptellin' my mind
You're not gonna stay
And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby
I lost you, baby and you were gone

Lie, lies I told you baby
I never meant to say
