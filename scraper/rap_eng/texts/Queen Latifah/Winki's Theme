[Vamp:]
Search and find (search and find)
Search and find (search and find)
What's on your mind (search and find)
What's goin' down (search and find)

[Spoken Intro:]
This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki
Who's looking down on me from Heaven
Watching my every move as usual

[Chorus:]
There but for the grace of God do I go
There but for the grace of God do I go

[Verse 1:]
I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme
But it's busting from the seams
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams
Moving all around, oh yes I'm making leaps and bounds
There's so much you can say
No time to write it down
I'm skipping to this and skipping to that
I've overflowed my cup
I'm flowing kinda quick, I hope you can keep up
Everything ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand
There's things about me all of y'all just got to understand
Latifah never was a teacher, never was a preacher
Never was a saint, never was conceited, never was defeated
Sometimes I get tired, sometimes I wanna faint
But I never shut up when things pissed me off
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across
That's what I gotta do
That's how it gotta be
I got an angel watching over me

[Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
There but for the grace of God (If you lose your way)
Search and find (search and find)
(There but for the, There but for the grace of God)

[Vamp:]
Search and find (search and find)
(There but for the, There but for the grace of God)
Search and find (search and find)
What's on your mind (What's goin' down)
What's goin' down (runnin' room)

[Ad-libs:]
It's time you find
What's goin' on in your mind
Try to find peace of mind
When your blind, world's unkind
Got to fight, keep the right
At the time, never gone
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Strive on, strive on, strive on
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Break it down...

[Instrument Solo]

[Ad-libs:]
The Lord is the light, is the light, is the light

[Bridge:]
The Lord is the light of my life
And He brightens up my world
Yes He did, yes He did
Lord is the light of my life
And He brightens up my world
You don't hear me!

[Chorus]

The Lord is the light of my life
And He brightens up my world
Yes He did, yes He did
The Lord is the light of my life
And He brightens up my world
World, world, world, world...
