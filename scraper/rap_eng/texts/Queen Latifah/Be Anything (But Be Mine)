Be a beggar, be a thief
Be my sunshine or my grief
Be anything, but, darling, be mine

Be a wise man, be a fool
Treat me tender or be cruel
Be anything, but, darling, be mine

Climb to the top of the ladder
Be master of all you survey
Fail and it still doesn't matter
If you love me, everything is okay

Be the angel of my prayers
Be the devil, who cares
Be anything, but, darling, be mine

Be the angel of my prayers
Be the devil, who cares
Be anything, but, darling, be mine
