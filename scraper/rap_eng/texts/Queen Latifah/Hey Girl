[Hook: Collie Weed]
Hey girl, all-on me girl
Why you wan' trouble me girl
Hey girl, all-on me girl
Why you wan' trouble me girl

[Apache]
Hey girl it's me Apache, how soon we forget
As long as I have a face, you'll have a place to sit
What do you want or better yet what do you need ho
Links or minks, a ride, or more dough (no)
Everytime I see you your hand's out, you're bummin
Claimin to be a woman, I hate to see her comin
We could've had it all if you just chilled
Asked you what your sign was and you told me the dollar bill
Stop gamin, girl I don't hate ya
You slack in your mack game, you wicked by nature
So get sweet, slick and slide for the next man
You might catch a backhand, cause I know your gameplan
Grab a cab, be on your way, that should start ya
I like your entrance, let me see your departure
Hurry up, get away, move on the double G
Why the fuck you wanna trouble me?

[Apache]
Eeny, meenie, mynie, moe
Who be the next ho to fuck with the ho pro
When I met you I was backed up, stopped up
I said come sit on my lap, let's see what pops up
Took the bait, asked if we could go to a hotel
Took you to the crib, did you on the DL
Gave up the pussy, I took it, rocked it
Everytime I turn around you got your hands in my pocket
But I ain't checkin for ya, your game's too slow
I'm too tall for that so bitch act like you know
Also, you're on the flip tip
This friendship, could end wit'cha leavin with a broke hip
Find another brother and run the same lame game
I forgot your name, so I can't complain
Hurry up, get away, move on the double G
Why the fuck you wanna trouble me?
(Why you wan' trouble me girl?)
