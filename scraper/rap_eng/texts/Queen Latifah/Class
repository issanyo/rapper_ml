[Verse 1: Catherine Zeta-Jones]
Whatever happened to fair dealing?
And pure ethics and nice manners?
Why is it everyone now is a pain in the ass?
Whatever happened to class?
Class

[Verse 2: Queen Latifah]
Whatever happened to "please, may I?"
And "yes, thank you" and "how charming?"
Now every son of a bitch is a snake in the grass
Whatever happened to class?
Class

[Chorus 1: Catherine Zeta-Jones & Queen Latifah]
Oh, there ain't no gentleman to open up the doors
There ain't no ladies, now there's only pigs and whores
And even kids'll knock you down so take a pass
Nobody's got no class

[Verse 3: Catherine Zeta-Jones (Queen Latifah)]
Whatever happened to old values?
(And fine morals?) And good breeding?
(Now no one even says "oops" when they're passing their gas)
Whatever happened to class?
Class

[Chorus 2: Catherine Zeta-Jones & (Queen Latifah)]
Oh, there ain't no gentleman that's fit for any use
And any girl'll touch your privates for a deuce
(And even kids will kick your shins and give you sass)
And even kids will kick your shins and give you sass
Nobody's got no class

[Chorus 3: Catherine Zeta-Jones & (Queen Latifah)]
All you read about today is rape and theft
(Jesus Christ)
(Ain't there no decency left?)
Nobody's got no class

[Outro: Queen Latifah & Catherine Zeta-Jones {Both}]
Every guy is a snot
(Every girl is a twat)
Holy shit (Holy shit)
What a shame (What a shame)
{What became of class?}
