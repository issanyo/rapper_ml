[Queen Latifah]:
Uhh Faith, Big Tif
On tha remix uh Bad Boy, Flava Unit for tha nine-six yeah
Check it out no joke without a doubt hah yeah
Uh now check it out

Listen who's spreading all the rumors, who's selling all the lies
Its spreading us apart, its fucking with my heart
You be sayin' keep it real and keep it real I must
You my man, I'm your girl yo whats up with tha trust
Yo tell me why you flex do you have a guilty complex?
Could you be laying up with the next? I'm vexed
Cause I'm losing you for something that don't even exist
Your number one with my kiss it ain't no twos on my list and that's tha jist
I'm looking for that special part of you, things won't be the same
If I lose my baby boo (lose my baby boo)
And my all girl crew only want to smoke blunts sip brew
But I want you so get at me don't get mad at me
Let's talk it out cause all I really want is to be happy like Mary
I'm getting wary of these games its heavy on my mind like a weave
I can't leave so it gots to change

[Faith Evans]:
When your around I get this feeling inside
That lets me know my emotions won't hide
But I just got to get 'cha to know I got to show you baby
Everything you mean to me there ain't no

Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
Ain't no reason that I'll be untrue
Ain't no need for me to try I can't find the reason why
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do

Ever since you've been in my life
I have a new direction
And I know where I want to be
Boy you know its with you
Cause I love what you do when your makin' sweet love to me

I use to think that I was wrong for wanting to
Be with you all the time
I never knew you would play games with my mind

1 - Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
Ain't no reason that I'll be untrue
There's no need for me to try I can't find the reason why
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do

Repeat 1

2 - Can't nobody love me better
Make me happy can't nobody love me like you boy
Cause you give me your good love
Can't nobody love me like you

Repeat 2 (2x)
