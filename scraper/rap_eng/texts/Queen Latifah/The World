The world, oh, oh, oh, the world
The world, oh, oh, oh

I smoked pot of blunt again for the pain to go away
But it wouldn't go away, just subsided through the haze
Just drifted off into deeper thought
I broke my mind and searched my heart
Finally what was blindin' me was just as clear as day

I figured out what's stressin' me, depressin' me
Mummy that man molesting me, oh no
Was only 5 years old, I couldn't seem to tell a soul
I didn't know how to let you and daddy know

And I can't go on like this
That's the type of thing that'd make you slash you wrists
But now that I realize this happened to me
I've gotta fight this

The devils are probably lyin', runnin' 'round and lyin'
Tryin' to move out is he gonna take my [Incomprehensible]?
Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours
Every second of every minute and every hour I see your face

Help me with what happens in the world
Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare

The world
The world will put you right on top
Then snatch the bottom from under you
And just watch and laugh as you drop

The world
Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare

The world
Oh, the world will put you right on top
Then snatch the bottom from under you
And just watch and laugh as you drop
The world

Runnin' around the school as you tried committin' suicide
He asked what would make a 14 year old boy wanna take his life?
It'd be the fact that he got a dad who uses him as a punchin' bag
Beats him till he's blue and black and won't stop will he makes him cry

You kept it to yourself and made excuses for the bruises
Took painkillers to kill the pain from a daddy who's abusive
He was telling you, you were useless, never heard the words I love you
Made you feel like you were worthless, he's tryin' to save the trouble

And he can't go on like this
That's the type of thing that'd make you slash you wrists
Somebody shoulda told you that you're priceless
Put your faith in God and we can fight this

The devils are probably lyin', runnin' 'round and lyin'
Tryin' to move out, is he gonna take my [Incomprehensible]?
Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours
Every second of every minute and every hour I see your face

Help me with what happens in the world
Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare

The world
The world will put you right on top
Then snatch the bottom from under you
And just watch and laugh as you drop

The world
Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare

The world
Oh, the world will put you right on top
Then snatch the bottom from under you
And just watch and laugh as you drop
The world

The world that we livin' in where we leave our babies
In the back seat of cars found my pass is blind
Desperate minds and emotional teenagers
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places

Love's so precious, don't ever wanna test it
Who's your momma? Who your daddy? You can't even tell
Your'e shinin' on, chattin', see news at eleven
Were all walking through this place with vain visions of heaven

The devils are probably lyin', runnin' 'round and lyin'
Tryin' to move out, is he gonna take my [Incomprehensible]?
Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours
Every second of every minute and every hour I see your face

Help me with what happens in the world
The world, the world
The world, the world
The world, the world

The world
Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare
