Not enough, not enough, not enough love
Not enough, not enough, not enough love
Not enough, not enough, not enough love
Not enough, not enough, not enough love

There's no room for hating in a heart full of kindness
How long will it take then for that to ring true?
Our chances are fading, just stop all this blindness
A new world is waiting for us if we do
But there's not enough love in our hearts

They write songs about it
They put it in movies
How life would be better with just enough love
Still we tend to doubt it
Though sometimes it moves us
They settle for enough when we could have much
Cause there's not enough love in our hearts (no, no)

There's not enough love, there's not enough love
There's not enough love in our hearts
There's not enough love, there's not enough trust
And it tends to keep us apart
There's not enough caring, there's not enough sharin'
Too much me, me, me and too much double-darin'
There's too much delayin', ooh not enough prayin'
Just sayin', it's not enough (no, no)
Just sayin', it's not enough

Hell and its ropes paved with real good intentions
We don't tend a garden, we just plant the seeds
Promises broken, too many to mention
While people go hungry and make it in need
Cause there's not enough love in our hearts

I often wonder what God must be thinkin'
Lookin' down on us, He'd have to be sad
We better wise up now before we start sinkin'
He gave us free choice but we mess it up bad
Cause there's not enough love in our hearts

There's not enough love, there's not enough love
There's not enough love in our hearts
There's not enough love, there's not enough trust
Well it's never too late to start (too late to start)
Why can't we try harder?
Why can't we see farther?
Why can't we do better?
Love's a good starter
Too much nay-sayin', and not enough prayin'
I'm just sayin', it's not enough (no, no)
I'm just sayin', it's not enough

Not enough, not enough, not enough love
There's not enough, not enough, not enough trust
Too much cryin', too much dyin'
Too much hatin', and not enough tryin'
Not enough stayin', too much good-byin'
It's just not enough, not enough (no, no)
It's just not enough, not enough (it's not enough)
It's just not enough, not enough (it's not enough)

Not enough, not enough, not enough love, no
Not enough, not enough, between us
Let's build a foundation, painting situations
Stop the salvation, keep this revelation
Fall on your knees, ban your burnin' temptation
I'm just sayin', it's just not enough (no, no)
I'm just sayin', it's not enough

Not enough, not enough, not enough love
There's not enough, not enough, not enough trust
Not enough love, open your hopes now
Not enough love, passion in your hearts now
Not enough love, down in our hearts
Not enough love, down in our hearts
Not enough love, down in our hearts

Repeat to Fade:

Not enough love, down in our hearts
