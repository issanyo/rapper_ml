[Intro]
As I look back on my life
And see where I come from
I wonder if I'm ever gonna see the tables turn
Cause I've been way too low,  for way too long
But I know somehow, some way...
My change gon' come

[Verse 1]
I was down, far from the shore
I was weak in my soul
Facing trouble, tears on the floor
I was tired and worn
Couldn't find  no peace
Down on my knees, I was lost in a storm
But I knew the Lord heard my cry
So one day I won't worry no more

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause just when I was about to give up
I heard Jesus say, Jesus say
Change gon' come, one day

[Chorus]
Streets wasn't safe
I couldn't find my way
But I found his grace, one day
Tears down my face
Jesus said, Jesus said
"Change gon' come one day," one day
I knew it would happen for me
One day

[Verse 2]
On the ground in dispear
I'm praying lord, can you hear me?
Upside down and the world don't care
I'm hurting need me a healing
And I'll take a drink or two
Just to get me through from the darkest of days
But the wages of sin is death
I got nothing left
But one prey and one praise

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause just when I was about to give up
I heard Jesus say, Jesus say
Change gon' come, one day

[Chorus]
Streets wasn't safe
I couldn't find my way
But I found his grace, one day
Tears down my face
Jesus said, Jesus said
"Change gon' come one day," one day
I knew it would happen for me
One day

[After-Chorus]
Every thing turned around
Yeah Lord, he said it would happen one day
Hmmm, people would talk about me
See me out in the streets
I would have no food, no shoes on my feet
(C'mon Jesus!)
But I knew one day the lord was gonna step right in and change my situation
He's gonna do it, yes, he will

[Outro]
Oh, Yeah
Yes, he will
Yes, he did
Yes, he did
Yeah, yeah

I was locked up in jail, one day
I knew he would take the gun outta my hand
Take me outta that dug den
Take me off that bottle lord
Take me off that crack lord
Take me off them pills lord
He would put clothes on my back
Shoes on my feet, praise in my house

Yes, He will
Yes, He will, will
Yeah, Yeah

I knew the change was going to come
