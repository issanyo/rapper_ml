"Yeah, this is my night tonight. Boy, I got my fresh gators on, I'm gon' get me some ass, boy. I see one right now."

"Mmmmmm... I really, really, really wanna give him some."

"I can read your mind, baby, I hear you talking. Do you hear me? Hot damn, hot damn. Do you hear me baby?"


"Should I give it to him? I think I might. I don't know."

"Say yes. Say yes. Say yes."

"Mmmmmm... I don't know."

"Yes. I know just what to do for her. It's just that I ain't got no money in the bank. Damn. I know she don't want no broke nigga. I'mma act like I got a lotta money. A hundred singles."

"Ahhh, power of the pum-pum. I think I might be able to work with this one. Who knows. We'll see."
