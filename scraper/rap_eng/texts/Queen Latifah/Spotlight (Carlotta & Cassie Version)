[Verse 1: Brandy]
Oh
All my life was on a stage, but I just watch the show
Every time they try to knock me off my pedestal
But I kept my head down, grinding, I was laying low
But it's my turn now
Oh, it's my time now
To stand on the stage, the curtains are drawn
And now I can hear the round of applause
I'm taking it all, it's my time to shine
Oh I, I'm coming for the spotlight

[Chorus: Brandy]
Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
The whole world gon' know me
My time, my time, my time
Yeah that's how it's gon' be
Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
Yeah that's all that I need
My time, my time, my time
You ain't gon' take this from me

[Verse 2: Queen Latifah]
I always been on top
Always count my blessings, but I still won't stop
Cause I was born for this
I was born to be a boss and I'm gon' fight for it
And I'm still gon' top the charts
So you better believe it, yeah I'm gon' shine
Whenever the story I'm a headline
Cause winning is my mission, I don't need no permission
I'm taking my position and now I'm coming for the spotlight

[Chorus: Both]
Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
The whole world gon' know me
My time, my time, my time
Yeah that's how it's gon' be
Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
Yeah that's all that I need
My time, my time, my time
You ain't gon' take this from me

[Bridge: Brandy, Queen Latifah, Both]
Oh, it's my time now
No, no it's my time now
And I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine the way I'm shining (I swear)
I'm the best, I always win
No, I'm not gon' lose (No)
It's my time, my time, my time, my time, my time

[Chorus: Both, Brandy, Queen Latifah]
Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
The whole world gon' know me (World gon' know me)
My time, my time, my time
Yeah that's how it's gon' be (How it's gon' be)
Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight (Spotlight)
Yeah it's all that I need
My time, my time, my time
You ain't gon' take this from me (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
