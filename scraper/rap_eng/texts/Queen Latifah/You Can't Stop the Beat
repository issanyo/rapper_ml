[TRACY]
You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the hill
You can try to stop the seasons, girl, but you know you never will
And you can try to stop my dancing feet, but I just cannot stand still

Cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way

[TRACY/LINK]
Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since this whole world began
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today

Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat

You can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea

[SEAWEED]
You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just can't be

[PENNY]
And if they try to stop us, Seaweed

[PENNY/SEAWEED]
I'll call the NAACP
