It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you
I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)
This MC stands for "Microphone Commando"
When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)
A battle, put me in it, I win it
The mission is music and rhythm
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music, music I take part in
One try, one God, and one destiny
Just dance for me
