Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown

We were so close there was no room
We bled inside each others' wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace

Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown

What if I told you were stupid, destructive, soulless
Callous, murderous, malignant, belligerent, ignorant
Would you believe me would you like that
Or would you prove me wrong and fight back
I'd like to take the sunshine right from the sky
And let it shine on you through my eyes
You see we all in the same boat trying to float
So everybody grab a oar we can make it to shore

Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown

We were so close there was no room
We bled inside each others' wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace

Some came to sing
Some came to pray
Some came to keep the dark away
So raise the candles high
'Cause if you don't we could stay
Black against the night
So raise them higher again
And if you do we could stay dry against the rain

Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
