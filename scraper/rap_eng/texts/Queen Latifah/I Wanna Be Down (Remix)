[Verse: Brandy]
Oh yeah ooh yeah
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

[Verse: Mc Lyte]
Yeah I get exotic with the melodic tune
I get hypnotic with the moon
But you got to put me down soon
I flip a sideshow if you come my way
Up, down, and around, even sideways
I'm about as ready as the Lyte can get
We can go all out
I ain't afraid of the sweat, but yet
I bet you got the techniques
To freak a girl inside out
What's that all about? (oooh yeah)
Can I have some of that?
You gotta put me on
Word around town is you're nine men strong
I wanna be put on in the worst way
Since the first day
I think it was a Thursday (oh baby)
You be that brother that I wanna sink my teeth in
Make me wanna ask “Where da hell you been?”
I like the way you be with all that personality
But I got flava too
You needs to get with me

[Hook: Brandy]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter the time
Of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

[Verse: Yo-Yo]
He was born twenty years ago
Just to pimp hoes
Everyday new clothes
Look at the cut? Cool. Pose
On three, got tha heat, so bluff it
Sling' (censored) cause it's more than twenty duckets
Struck it, kinda rich
Now his pockets lookin' straight
Slam the deese on the Benzo
Pancake by the gate
Moms lookin' straight with her house she got
Great loungin' in her new home that's up out the state
I'll be your call mail, won't tell
You can get it when you want it
Even though you got chicks all up on you it
Don't matter, cause brother you're fly
I can't lie
I've been mackin' daddy from the corner of my eye
Now, baby bring it on
Don't be frontin' on your baby boo
All I wanna know is what's up with you
How can I get with you
Seems like you got a hold on me
It must voodoo cause baby I want you

[Hook: Brandy]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter the time
Of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

[Verse: Queen Latifah]
About yay short, about yay tall
About so big, about so small
About this length, about this width
About this flow, about this gift
Instinct leading me right up your alley way
Skip tha Moet, let's chill with some Alize
Nuff stress in our day
Let me massage your mind as my mental starts to play
A ghetto star's who you are
And I'll be your sexual chocolate bar
And I got to keep it strong for the cause
And you got to keep me strong for the tours
Brotherman and me, damn the family
What else could we be if no one understand us but we?
You were the first to tame me
Uh, Big Tif
I'm out

[Hook: Brandy]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter the time
Of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

[Outro: Queen Latifah]
Hey here we go here we go here go now and it's on yeah
And you don't stop Brandy is in tha house and you don't stop
Until the body rock keep it on and you don't stop you rock on
