All the ones who stand and frown

Repeat 1

[Latifah]
]Stand and frown
You need to know
So c'mon

[Meredith]

Bled inside, each other's wound
We all had caught the same disease
We all sang the songs of peace

[Latifah]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon
Lay it down now

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Latifah]
What if I told you you were stupid
Destructive, solace, callous, murderous
Malignant, belligerent, ignorant
Would you believe me, would you like that?
Or would you prove me wrong and fight back?
I'd like to take the sunshine right from the sky
And let it shine on you through my eyes
See we all in the same boat tryin' to float
So everybody grab a ore, we could make it to shore
For sure

Repeat 1

[Latifah]
C'mon, c'mon
Uh

Some came to see
Some came to pray
Some came to keep the dark away

[Meredith] (Latifah)
So raise the candles high
Cuz if ya don't, we could fade black against the night (light it up)
Oh, raise them higher again (higher again, c'mon)
And if ya do, we could be dry against the rain (uh, yeah)

Repeat 1 to fade
