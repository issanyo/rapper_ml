People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

Listen, money crimes and mood swings
Situations where certain people will do things
Like hop on bandwagon, get on the food chain
Soon as you get yo swag that's when yo crew change

But we all equal and people are just people
Leave it in God's hands 'cause the devil is lethal
You get what you earn also you live and you learn
To expect nothing in return

Do what you do from the heart then move on
'Cause in the eyes of the ungrateful, you can do wrong
That's when the negative energy gets too strong
The sunshine leaves, in comes the true storm

Sometimes make you wanna do harm
But you fall back 'cause you too calm
To get all rowdy and evil 'cause you realize
At the end of the day they just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

The bad ones discourage, the good ones motivate
The weak shall perish, the haters going show they hate
As long as you know what you dealing with, you can close the gate
Never let them in yo world till you know they straight

'Cause then again they just people
Life's just a one stop deal, there's no sequel
Fake ones are so transparent and so see through
Love ones can be so humble when they need you

Some got they hands out even after you feed 'em
But they ain't never around when you need 'em
That's when yo thoughts get evil
But then you realize they just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

Ayo, I got a lot more living to do before I leave here
'Cause I'm blessed and I'm thankful and I'm happy to be here
In good health with good wealth, you could always use help
But all you really got is yo good self

Still what I go through, it hurts when people that know you
Let you down and don't hold you
But yo mistakes will teach you
'Cause then you realize they just people

Ohh people, ohh people, ohh, ohh
Ohh people, ohh people, ohh, ohh
Don't you worry about a thing they just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people

People gonna let you down
Don't expect for them to be around
They're just people
