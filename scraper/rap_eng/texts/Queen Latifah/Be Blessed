[Verse 1]
Too many storms
Have passed your way
You're all washed out
'Cause it rained on your parade
Seems nobody cares 'bout you anyway
Now you're living your life like a castaway

Search for strength inside
Was it all in vain?
'Cause the deeper you dig
You find more and more pain
Don't let your tomorrow
Be like yesterday
'Cause I spoke to God
I called out your name
And on your behalf
I just asked
If He would be there for you

I want you to be blessed
Don't live life in distress
Just let go, let God
He'll work it out for you

I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his hands
(For you, He's at His best)
You deserve no less

You've been through so much
Be blessed
From the bottom of your feet
The crown of your head
Your life be blessed
Your family be blessed
Your finances be blessed
Everything about you
Hey
(Give in to Jesus)
(Give in to Jesus)
I want you to
(Be blessed)
Don't let life
(Don't live life in distress)
Just let go and let God
(He'll work it out for you)
He'll work it out
I believe it
I believe it
(Oh-oh-oh, I pray that your soul will be blessed)
I pray that your soul will be blessed, yeah yeah
(Forever in His hands)
For you
You deserve
