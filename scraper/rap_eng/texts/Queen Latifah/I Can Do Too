I ain't taking no shit
I'm the one you wanna be with
Can't come home from the club
Gotta be in love
And that's where I'll be see
Think about what you need
But you never think about me
So we go through the ?
Next thing you know
You're the first one to leave cos

I'm gonna be the one to win this fight (win this fight)
Say what you say cos I'm gonna be alright (alright)
Nothing in this world is gonna hold me down (hold me down)
Step to me & you will see (standing in the last round)

All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever
All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever

I ain't thinking bout you
Cos I gotta think about me
And if you wear me down
Can't get up, got the best you see, so
Can't go out like that
It's like a monkey on my back
You can't stop this stress
I'm tired of your mess
End up like the rest

I'm gonna be the one to win this fight (win this fight)
Say what you say cos I'm gonna be alright (alright)
Nothing in this world is gonna hold me down (hold me down)
Step to me & you will see (standing in the last round)

All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever
All that you do I can do too (do too)
I actually do it better (do it better)
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever
All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better (I can do it better)
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever
All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever

[Queen Latifah]
I'm a try whatever I can think of wit you
You know, I've been down for you, but you
Consistently, fuck it
You treat me like a housewife
All maid and chef
Why you sit around here like you do heck
A woman? Nah you need a blowup doll
A chick like me, I was born to ball
I'm a chick with her own doe for the mall
I'm a chick with her own cell making calls
Drop off, black Benz when I'm loving hard
Get over your selfish ass on the beach in ? ?

All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better (do it better)
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever
All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better (I can do it better)
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever
All that you do I can do too (better)
I got that something you want and
All that you do I can do too (yeah yeah)
I got that something you want and (whatever)
All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever
All that you do I can do too
I actually do it better (I can do better)
I got that something you want and
Believe me I'll try whatever
