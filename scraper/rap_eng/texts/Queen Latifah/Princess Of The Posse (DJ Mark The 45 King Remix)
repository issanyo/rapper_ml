Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me
Forgive the crowds, O Lord, they know not why they sweat me
Biting's against the law in the place that I live
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib
The call me the high priestess of this hasta
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta
There's never been a word I can't master
I've always been, a piddly pastor
I reign, the lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light
