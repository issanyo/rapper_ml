We live in a society created by an empire
That's based on terror, welcome to the One World Era
A complete interruption to your lil' paultry ass life
That you thought you was livin, and what you been given
No more Benzes to roll in, fat-ass stacks of money
Cause ain't no such thing as money
I bet y'all niggas think it's funny
Put your money where your mouth or where your mouth used to be
Cause ain't shit on this planet, or in this life for free
We gonna do it like Osirus and The Warriors in the dark
Get your niggas and my niggas and some mo' niggas
And have a meeting in the park!
