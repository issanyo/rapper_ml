I love it when we're cruisin' together
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Baby, get in, we fixin' to cruise till we can't
You got the drink, I got the denk and we done stopped at the bank
Sunbeamin' this weekend, heading down that beach way
Messin' with my girl's hair, one of them games that we play
Braids bouncin' to the beat, feel me coming down the street
She gotta be a freak if she's sittin' next to me so
Shine up your hoopty and fall in line
Bring your honey if she's fine and we gon' have a good time
To the outskirts of first buzzin' off the erky jerks
Swoopin' while I puts in work now watch me skirt
I heard 'em callin' me but then I ball and see
'Cause if you're ballin' me, you got your own set of keys
The breeze is hittin', don't think you'll catch me strippin'
40 Thevz Wino and Gat got that back when we're dippin'
To the west coast down south in your direction
Throwin up the hood cruisin' come on we jettin'
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
Come on in my lap get in an' twist the cap
Hand him the jizz back clowin' up the coast like that
Take a ray all nice in back seat, Pete
Just do a rollin' top down ready to hit the street
Shoulder to shoulder turn their heads 'cause it's a black thing
Sport in a 'vette brings me strapped won't be no jacket
Consider that chocolate, mixed with that tie
Wind be on my neck the beach caress my thighs
Now I hope he's high
Ready to get my groove on, so I'm playing teams
Know when he's feelin' me and what those feelings be
Kinda' flossy 'cause tossy we do it on seat tip
Snuggled up freaky dick give the drink a sip
Leaning on his chest, I feel security
Just my man and me against the world you understandin' me
Cruisin' till the sunsets, yep, we'll be headin' out
Dippin' through the city, me and my niggys what I'm talkin' about
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
Sunday afternoons in the tape deck
My woman's on the right lookin' bomb for this trek deck
Floatin' on the freeway at a cool 65
Malika rolls the top, so I can feel that rocky mountain high, yeah
Take the wheel while I shake off this hairbrush
Yep, I'm down the bus like no one like what
Watchin' the sunset be the flyest with the top down
Park up at the spot, I ain't gonna front, I'm tryin' to mess around
Your homies still around, yeah, they busy though
That's all I need to know roll up the windows and lock the door
It's all that poppin on that cooze got me worked up
Turn up the beat and bump in-between the seats some
Yeah, that's how we do it on the western hemisphere
All my homies be a man 'cause ain't no pretendin'
Cruisin' feel the wind blow my brain back
Trippin' off into the night bumpin' to a fat track, yeah
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
'Cause I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us

Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
