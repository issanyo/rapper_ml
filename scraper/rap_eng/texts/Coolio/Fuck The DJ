[Intro - Uzimon]

Back in the day
DJ mix record and blend them
With the mixer and time them properly
Nowadays any bloodclot man
With a bloodclot telephone can be a DJ
Me say fuck that, man, fuck the DJ


[Hook - Uzimon]

We say fuck the DJ, only Top 40 now them a play
When we say fuck DJ, we mean right away
Burn down your tables, fire burn them CDJ
We say fuck the DJ, Blacklisted and Uzi nah go play
Bumrush stage, beat down that DJ right away
We take your records and your laptop, I will say


[Verse 1 - Adil Omar]

I've got kratom in my system, hatred in my eyes, listen
Fire in my belly, Matrix in my mind, a virtual prison
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, we got these agents pushing buttons
I'm dodging EDM bullets, Neo spine while I find
Paris Hilton in Ibiza, kick her off and slap the skeezer
Having divas wilin' out to Paki Rambo on the speakers
Nice to meet ya chesty features, yeah I'll sign half of your boobies
Lookin' like I was Steve Angello and stole half of his groupies
Went from Rob Swift, Roc Raida, to Muggs and Premo
To bros fist pumpin' to Pauly D in a fuckin' speedo
Paki gangster on wax, I murder tracks in my sleep
And since I like Diplo and Skrillex, I kidnap 'em for beats; beast


[Hook - Uzimon]

We say fuck the DJ, only Top 40 now them a play
When we say fuck DJ, we mean right away
Burn down your tables, fire burn them CDJ
We say fuck the DJ, Blacklisted and Uzi nah go play
Bumrush stage, beat down that DJ right away
We take your records and your laptop, I will say


[Verse 2 - Coolio]

Fuck these DJs, their songs and their replay
Cut 'em like OJ and send 'em back to TJ
On the freeway, givin' niggas BJs
Rollin' Greyhound like pussy in a PJ
Uh, I stuck a DJ, nigga, fuck a DJ, nigga
Like I always say, fuck a DJ, nigga
I ain't no DJ bigger, I'm a DJ killer
It's time to owe an ass whoop on these DJ niggas
I ain't no DJ soldier, I'm a DJ roller
I beat a DJ ass until the DJ over
I take a DJ bling and make him kiss my ring
These niggas don't know what DJ mean


[Hook - Uzimon]

We say fuck the DJ, only Top 40 now them a play
When we say fuck DJ, we mean right away
Burn down your tables, fire burn them CDJ
We say fuck the DJ, Blacklisted and Uzi nah go play
Bumrush stage, beat down that DJ right away
We take your records and your laptop, I will say


[Verse 3 - Blacklisted MC]

I'm all about havin' a good time like gettin' mad drunk
Mixin' hip-hop with reggae and a bit of that punk
I do my own thing in my very own way
And I don't give a fuck what the radio plays
And I don't give a shit what the censors say
It's all about Blacklisted and I'm here to stay
I rampage the stage and I hit the fucking bar
Blacklisted, motherfucker, and you know who I are


[Verse 4 - Bizarre]

Mr. DJ, turn that wack shit off
That R&B shit, that shit too soft
We like that crazy shit, you know how we do it
Get crunk, yeah, straight fight music
Yeah, pop pills, take drugs, drop outta school
3 in the morning, actin' a damn fool
We want '40 Oz.', we want 'Fight Music'
Fuck a DJ, you know how Bizarre do it


[Hook - Uzimon]

We say fuck the DJ, only Top 40 now them a play
When we say fuck DJ, we mean right away
Burn down your tables, fire burn them CDJ
We say fuck the DJ, Blacklisted and Uzi nah go play
Bumrush stage, beat down that DJ right away
We take your records and your laptop, I will say


[Outro - Blacklisted MC]

Yo, it's Blacklisted MC
On the international flex, man
From Bermuda to Pakistan
From Detroit to the UK
This is real music, so fuck the DJ!


[Outro - Uzimon]

We say FUCK the DJ, everybody DJ nowaday
When we say fuck DJ, mean fuck everybody
Even your momma tried to give me the mixtape
