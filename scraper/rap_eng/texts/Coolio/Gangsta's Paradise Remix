[Verse 1 - K. Jayz]
As I listened to this song as a child, I didn’t know the meaning
Until I listened to it now
Back then it was just something to listen to
But now it’s speaking to me like there’s a mission that I have to do
Now I’m older and wiser
I’m stronger, with eyes better than the average man
Common sense that led me away from caravans from the police
Niggas addicted to the street life, but still be looking for peace
Now tell me is there a heaven for a nigga like me
Not a criminal, but I still be fucking and smoking my green
The life of a minority, but I’m doing alright
As long as I push my standards, I’m good ‘til the end of my life

[Interlude x2 - K. Jayz]
Why are we so blind to see how we hurt each other’s lives?

[Verse 2 - Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda g that little homie's wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the street light

[Hook - L.V.]
Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3 - Coolio]
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!

[Bridge - L.V.]
Why are we so blind to see that the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Hook]
