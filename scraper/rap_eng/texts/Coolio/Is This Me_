[Intro: Coolio]
Yeah, 1996
Coolio with the flow
Rated R (Superstar)
L.V., that's right

[Verse 1: Coolio]
Mossberg Smith & Wesson
Forty-five let me tell you how I learned my lesson
House party in the hood at some niggas I don't know
But I had to go they had a house full of hoes
I stepped into that party with my nigga high off that head
The hoes is looking good so we try to make a friend for night
Let's get it right let's get it straight
But now these punk ass niggas in the party want to play a hate
I'd bust a cap to save a rat so what's up with that
It's 1996 so these bustas get no kinda of doubt
Like American Express here we go again
I never leave home without it so don't even think about it
Just let me leave and I won't have to make you bleed
But if you make an offensive move then I'm gonna have to show a groove
Back up off let's keep it soft
Don't make me have to show you who these 16 bosses be

[Hook: L.V.]
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

[Verse 2: Rated R]
Way back in the days we dudes don't forget a name
Now everybody wants the fame but things change ain't the same
All these sucker set-trippin' killin' for no reason
That's why I never leave the house without my nina
I love my baby carry my baby whereever I go
For these suckers get in a twist they say I beat their pimpin
Stop wishin you was in my shoes
And learn to be yourself stop acting like somebody else
It's ninety-six and most of the homeys thinking of six feet
The six I found out if you wear partners where the friends go
Every week you don't see me I gotta put at work
I guess the shit don't stop till my gaskets drop
Stop hating my life and get your own
Be true to this game or this game will do you cold
Everywhere I go I got my back
I hate to do my all black but I must stay strapped

[Hook: L.V.]
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

No no oooo I can't escape this life

[Verse 3:  Coolio]
I been trying to live in peace but these fools won't cease
They insist with their bullshit so I got a full clip
Chitty-chitty bang-bang doin it's a new thing
One shot from a Jake .38 can make your brain ache
I'm the kinda nigga that don't believe in frontin'
But if you run up on me trippin' you best believe I'm dumpin'
I got bills to pay and kids to raise
And a whole generation of lost niggas to save
So I ain't got time for that yip yap
If you start some static I'm gonna have to blow your mind back
Believe that nigga daisy if you do it's true
Fuck with Coo you get done that's how we do it to it
Don't start no shit and it won't be none son
But if you do I'm going for my gun
Like Doc Holliday a nigga ain't scary
So if you want to trip then I'll be your huckleberry

[Hook: L.V.]
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really really really ain't me
But the streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
