It's all the way live
It's all the way live
It's all the way live
It's all the way live
If you wanna party
Come on in and party hearty
When the people get together
And don't care about the weather
We're proud to say, "Welcome to the party"
(Yeah)
It's all the way live
(Sho 'nuff)
It's all the way live
(Whoa, whoa, tell the people)
(Tell 'em)
It's all the way live
(Ooh)

(All you got to do is boogie)
Dance, clap your hands
All you wanna do is boogie
Bad woman
Havin' fun
So, so fine, those ladies
Doin' moves that drives us fellas crazy
When the music's quite together
And you know there is none better
To even get a seat, we have to be here early, come on
It's all the way live
It's all the way live
(Whoa, whoa, tell the people)
(Tell 'em)
It's all the way live
(Ooh)

(All you got to do is boogie)
Huh, it's live, it's all the way live
Huh, it's live, it's all the way live

Dance, clap your hands
All you wanna do is boogie
When the music's in the groove
And it makes you wanna move
Everybody get on up
When the sound begins to groove
And your feet begin to move
With Lakeside you're groovin' at the party
(Party)
