Hey, baby, how you doin'? What's goin' on?

I'm sittin' in my motherfuckin' cell, it's the same song

Tell my kids that I love 'em

But don't tell 'em that I'm through

Keep cryin' an' tell 'em I'll be home soon

Oh, baby, I'm goin' crazy

'Cos I keep seein' shit that amaze me

Still, I had to kill a motherfucker last week

He thought I was a punk

An' tried to creep up on me in my sleep

I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch

Or buck ya but I can't, so fuck it

I'm behind these bars an' it's burnin' like nitro

I might go psycho, the man on the tower got a rifle

Aw, shit, there the lights go

{Hello}

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

An' I know he's a killer but I love dat nigga

Hey baby, what's happenin', honey?

How you doin'? I miss you

The kids keep askin' where's their papa?

I had to tell 'em Daddy got caught by the coppers

It's time for me to raise 'em up proper, by myself

It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help

Now, everybody tellin' me that you ain't shit black

An' when you get out, you'll jack

An' probably go right the fuck back

Damn, the pressure's gettin' hot an' heavy

An' yeah, I'm gettin' sweated by your homey

In the blue an' white Chevy

But now he's got a condo an' a brand new Lexus

Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas

The ends don't justify the means

An' in another life he might've been the man of my dreams

But you know I got your back to the motherfuckin' end

But a bitch can't even trip like she doesn't need a friend

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

An' I know he's a killer but I love dat nigga

{Hello, you have a collect call from, Coolio

If you choose to accept this call, please press 5 now}

What the fuck you mean you need a friend?

I can't be havin' no niggas 'round my kids

Don't you make me break up outta this motherfucker

An' start killin' motherfuckers, shit

I know it's rough, I know it's tough

But when you fumble in the game, sometimes you get locked up

You better stay away from that punk ass bitch

He ain't shit, I don't wanna have to kill him

'Cos think about the times that we used to have

Don't make me reach out an' touch that ass

You put yourself in danger when you fuck with a buster

Like shootin' dice without a pistol, in a circle of murderers

You got more class than the average type hooker, bitch

Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich

Now I gotta check but if you've got the check

Give a nigga a look an' put somethin' on my books, peace

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

An' I know he's a killer but I love dat nigga

Aiyo, remember the homey with the Lexus

He took the trip to Texas

Now he's wearin' the fuckin' Lexus like a necklace

So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a bitch to do?

My nigga's stretched in the pen since '92

Them visits ain't doin' the trick, drop fucks make me sick

'Cos this po' puddy tat needs a cat nip

An' that motherfucker representin' you, I think he resents you

He got evidence he never presents to

The people in court, I heard witnesses abortin'

What's he doin' about gettin' you out to hold the fort?

I got some ends, I'ma send you a dime an' two doves

Mama hates you but damn, I got love for a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

An' I know he's a killer but I love dat nigga

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta

An' I know he's a killer
