Song:   Money (Dollar Bill Y'all)

Money is your home on the range
Money puts the weapon in the stock exchange
Ya make money on your 9 to 5
Uhh, to earn your livin so you survive
It takes money to pay your rent and to eat
Without money your home be on the street
So you steal some money and got to jail, uhh
And then you turn around and need sumtin for bail
When you need twenty cents to call your lawyer
To plead innocence and say they never saw ya
But before ya ya lawyer a-get you free
He asks how will you pay his fee?
But you have no money, you're in a jam
Your lawyer don't give a damn, watch the cell doors slam
It takes money money (money money)
Cash, money money (money moneyyy) to the bill
It takes money money (money money), that's right
Cash, money money, for real

Hook:

Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all
Dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all
Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all
Dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all
Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all
Dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all
Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all
Make the homies rob and steal, kid for real y'all

It takes money to buy that TV set
It takes money to place that casino bet
It takes money to buy that radio
And money for gas so your car will go
It takes money for you to buy a house
It takes money for a trap to catch a mouse
It takes money to take a vacation trip
A cruise around the world on a pleasure ship
It takes money to get interest from the bank
It takes money for a homey to buy your tape
It takes money to pay for your doctor bill
And your psychiatrist if you're actin ill
It takes money for a king to have a queen
It takes money for the king to buy her ring
It takes money for a castle when the king is crowned
Cos money what make the world go round
It takes money money (money money)
Cash, money money (money moneyyy), that's right
It takes money money a-to the bill
A-to the B-I-double L, BILL for real

Well if ya got kids a-then you know
The more you spend the more they grow
They go from two to four in a row
But don't think that the growin is thru cos you'se a fool
They go from four to six and what they bear
They have you spendin all your money like a millionaire
They go from eight to nine and then to ten
Your baby got'cha spendin money again
Wit'cha money now gone your rent is due
And now your landlord is houndin you
But you go to lay down and rest your head
But the bill collector done took your bed
And when you got twentys and fives and tens
Then sometimes you got friends
But when you only got pennys, nickels and dimes
Then you only got friends some of the time
So you make a million dollars to pay a tax
To keep the IRS off your back
Uncle Sam got his and I got mine
And now I got friends all o' the time
It takes money money, uhh (money money)
Cash, money money (money moneyyy), that's right
It takes money money (money money)
Cash, money money, a-to the bill
A-to B-I-double L, BILL for real
Uhh
