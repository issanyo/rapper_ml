[Coolio]
It has (It has), come to my understanding that (that)
There are those (those) who would question my skillz (my skillz)
And abilities (and abilities)
Since it is thus (it is thus)
I must (I must)
Release it(release it)
Myself (myself)
For with thou be repremanded (repremanded)
Hit 'Em!

[Verse 1: Coolio]
Hocus, focus on the mighty mic loco
Me and the Forty dump yo ass like a pogo
You better kick it cause I been workin' on my mojo
Make your crew disapeer like Dorothy and Toto
Your trippin on me because your girl want my photo
Nigga, you better chill before I send my homie home with your hoe
Fools get ca-reemed when they steps into my dojo
It's the ghetto witch doctor sprinklin herbs on the voco'
I deliver hits like my name was FujiMoto
Platinum and gold all the way to Acalpuco
To all rappers international, domestic, and loc-al
Step to the fore or get your ass rolled up like a Rollo
Your points need bifocals
You better try to see like Total
My name ain't Ralph Lauren but I'll play your ass like polo
I kick a solo
From here to Sojo
You ain't no man eater, nigga, so your whole style is no go

[Chorus]
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em. Hit 'em! (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em. Hit 'em! Hit 'em! (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Get that nigga, get that nigga! (Ha-ha)

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I'm stickin niggas like Mexican's in penitentaries
The niggas is flinchin, see everytime the homies mention me
Grew up off Avalon and Century
With a hundred ways of illegal en-ta-ry
Can't injure me
My momma fucked the Unibomber that's why I'm blowin shit to smithareens
I'm like (Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! Wee!)
The nigga flying guillotine (Ha-ha!)
The illest things I bring that not even DeVante could swing
Before a nigga serve me, his seventy-six is a winter green
Fuck your team (nigga)
Crowbar eatin niggas up like Edy, I mean (I mean)
It's time we started servin niggas like they was dope fiends (Right)
I smoke all label rosters when I rock like the thing
In the bucket doin ninety-five like Rodney King
Extreme antimostity, your ultimate adversary
I'm like white blood cells fightin' H.I.V. inside a capillary (Bitch)
I'll beat that ass blindfolded like a pinata, scary
My prom night I was fuckin Carrie
Had her screamin "Bloody Mary!"

[Chorus]
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em! (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em! (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ah)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em! (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em! Hit 'em! (Ha-ha, Ha-ha, Hit 'em!)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em! (Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em! (Wha?)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em! (Break that nigga off)
Rrrr, stick 'em. Hit 'em! Hit 'em! (What's that, Cool?)
Cool, break this nigga off!

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Alright, wait, wait, wait
It ain't ova
I burn like a nova
It's the all seeing all knowing
Like mother fuckin Yoda
I rock like baking soda
From Compton to Dakota
And when I drop I'm gonna crush all these busta's like a boulda
So grab your hoe (hoe), and see if you can hold hu (hold her)
I put bitches and pets on a fantastic voyage on a ship like Noah
I told ya
I'm a soldier
Wake that ass up like Folger's
Give the people what they want a little bit more-a
You don't know the score
What the hell you comin here for?
Whip that ass like grandpa used to do and leave it sore
It's the hardcore
Take your whole hood to war
It's time for all the bitch ass niggas to hit the door
Go home and get your pen and brush up on your metaphors
It's the forty muskateer, cuttin that ass up with swords
You be the prey, I'll be the predator
Bring the feather to that ass so niggas call me Thor

[Chorus]
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em. Hit 'em! (Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em (Ha-ha, Ha-ha)
Rrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em
Rrrr, stick 'em. Hit 'em! Hit 'em!
