INTRO:(COOLIO TALKING)
This record goes out to all you fake ass,gangsta baller bourjois minded ass
House niggas who forget their colour.Put on a suit and tie and escape from
The ghetto and don't never come back.Yeah motherfucker,you can run but you
Sure can't hide!

Deep down in the jungle where the crack dealers grow
Niggas kill niggas for steppin on their toe
A girl is a bitch and a lady is a ho
When anything goes for a little bit dough, see
Shit get took by thugs and crooks
With the knowledge of a scholar but they don't read books
Everyday is a chance that ya life might go
So today is a day that ya gotta get paid
Slang them ki's,make them g's
Do what'cha want what ya feel what'cha please
But don't forget where you come from
Cos when you do that you're done
Remember your niggas and bitches and your triggers
And take it to your pockets for some figures
When ya get it goin and ya got it goin good
Ya better bring back somethin for da hood

HOOK 1
Bring back somethin fo da hood motherfucker!
Bring back somethin fo da hood!
REPEAT

LA County what's goin on?
1993 modern day Babylon
Peace to the niggas from the street
And rest in peace to the others that's six feet deep
Welcome to the fool and he strikes when he's back
And the snake come around,go around and get ape
Top down,slipped on CO-run they none
Ever since crack came ain't no fun
Black cop white cop *gun shot*
Fuck the colour of skin make sure he shot *gun shot*
Escape from a jail cell,split away from hell
And all I want for Christmas is a Glock and some shells
Billy Boy takes the pictures,(?Rak watch the room?)
Five-I-seven on my switch,we got out early
Taddle-tails get dropped an' they get got good
So get this stoob nigga for the hood

HOOK 2
Get that nigga fo da hood motherfucker!
Get that nigga fo da hood!

INTERLUDE
Them niggas ain't playin!(x 3)
(What'cha gonna do when you get out of jail?)

VERSE 3
You must remember dis if you're black and you're rich
One push come to shove they'll take your shit
Martin Luther King didn't wear a diamond ring
But he had a dream to let freedom reign
My homie Red Foxx got played like blocks
Pick em up sticks,jacks and hop-scotch
Frustration ,aggravation,there's no end to the situation
Cos niggas need a place to meet,a place to sleep
A place to eat and rest they feet
But nobody really even gives a fuck
That's why so many niggas is maggot'd up,huh
You claimin the hood but you don't back it up
Fool!And when they catch ya ass,they gonna FUCK you up
So when you get it goin and ya got it goin good
You better bring back somethin fo da hood

REPEAT HOOK 1(x 2)
