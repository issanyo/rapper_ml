As I walk thru the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's much left
'Cause I've been brassin' and laughin' so long that
Even my Mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You'd better watch how you talkin', and where you're walkin'
Or you and your homies might be like a chap
I really hate to check but I gotta look
As they croak I see myself in the pistals smoke ... fool
I'm the kind of cheater little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light
Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
They got the situation, they got me facin'
I can't live with no more right, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be damned with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loped out placeto certain trippin' banker
And my homing is down so don't arouse my anger ... fool
Dead bay nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' light, do or die, what can I say
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24
The way things is goin' I don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
The Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's money, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cooking
They say I've got to learn but nobody's there to teach me
If they can't understand how can they reach me
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck for
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me ...
