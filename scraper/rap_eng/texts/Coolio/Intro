*The sound of rain falling and a devil like voice laughing*

A man is heard running and breathing fast
Scared Man: Damn!  Wha...

The running gets faster, the man is breathing faster, and he sounds
Terrified.  The devil's laughing is getting much louder

There is the sound of things being knocked over as if the man is trying
To hide and everything is in his way

Scared Man: What you want man?  What you want from me?

Devil:  Your soul!
