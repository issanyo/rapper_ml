Verse 1:
Uh, I sneak a forty like a cheetah
And give a call to the wild when I greet her (Meow!)
The coochie leader
Bend on over and touch your toes
And I can jump up on a dresser and strike a pose
Uh, if you want it then you're ready and you're able, girl
Pull up your skirt and we can do it on the pool table
Your nipples look so tender
Can I twirl 'em in my mouth like a blender, surrender
Cause ain't nothin but freakin
I can keep it all day, all weekend
And have you tweekin
I be strokin, that's what I be doin
And every position you assumin
Uh, all night, all day
If you stay
I can rub you the right way (Hey!)
If he go one time, I go three
Cause that's how it is in the CPT

Chorus:
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Cause I got the key to the city
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Can we go somewhere and get busy?
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
You're lookin kinda pretty
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Can I get close to the kitty?

Verse 2:
Are you sure that we alone, all alone? (Yeah!)
Lock the door and unplug the telephone (Telephone!)
Light some candles let me get a look at your handles (Ooh-wee!)
You got a body like a sex scandal
So, I puts the cotton ball in the Q-Tip patch
Turn around and let me see you from the back, ah shat! (Damn!)
You know you bring out the freak in me
I go deep in the peak, I hope you think of me
Whenever you need some sexual healing
We like two in a million
Don't fight the feelin
You ain't dealin with no rookie
Yes I got a lot of nuts in my Tollhouse cookie
Call up your bookie, put your money on the cement
I'm puttin in work like a tag team free man
I spark through the woods like a Recon
And we can do it all night with the lights on

Chorus:
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Cause I got the key to city
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Let's go somewhere and get busy?
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
I hope you ain't the kind that acts a ditty
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
I'm tryin to get close to the kitty

Bridge:
What's up on some lovin, babay?
We can roll in my sixty-three
And drink Hennessy
What's up on some lovin, babay?
Don't you wanna roll with me?
You and me can cream

Verse 3:
We can put it on a platter, girl, it don't matter
I make it hot and you can pop it like a firecracker
In the bedroom, bathroom, livin room
Outside in the yard, it's a full moon
In the car, in the front seat, back seat
On the trunk, on the hood, and it's all good
I'll be the piece and you can be the booty
And I'll work extra duty to please your coochie
You can lay me on the bed and cuff me up
Spread honey on my chest, but don't rough me up
Dig your nails in my back, girl, play yo game
You never come the same if we say yo name
Is it real or a dream
You make me scream
When you rub my body with shaving cream
Stick your tongue down my throat and give me a kiss (Mmm-waah!)
Cause you know it don't get no better than this (That's right!)

Chorus:
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Cause I got the key to the city
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Can we go somewhere and get busy?
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Damn, you're lookin kinda pretty
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Can I get close to the kitty
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Girl, I got the key to the city
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Can we go somewhere and get busy?
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Come and get a taste of the ribby (Ribby!)
Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Now, the kitty's kinda friendly

Bridge, Repeat 1.5X
What's up on some lovin, babay?
We can roll in my sixty-three
And drink Hennessy
What's up on some lovin, babay?
Don't you wanna roll with me?
You and me can cream
