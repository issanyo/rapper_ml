Verse One:

It's time to take you to its full potential
Peep this
And drop some game on the instrumental and
It's a symptom that you listen close and better tell your folks
Let the locest loc
First things first since your date of birth
You've been kinda confused about what your life is worth
50 million times don't wait and go
You gotta take control
Cause fools don't live to be old
You can do anything that you want to do
All you got to do is to put your brain into it
Take your time and educate your mind
In the long run I'm sure you're fine
If you walk the walk you can talk the talk
But don't wait too long coz life is short
And remember, nomatter what they tellin' you
If you try, you can be a winner too

Chorus (L.V.):

Keep on pushing
Moving on up
Everybody we're moving on up
Moving on up
You're a winner
You gotta keep pushing
Moving on up
Everybody we're moving on up
Moving on up
You're a winner

Verse Two:

Everybody rides with the women boys and girls
Each one teach one but we can't save the world
All at one day you could take it play by play
And once you're on the path
Don't you ever go astray
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
You can give a man some wisdom but you can't make him think
Coz
Stitch in time saves nine
The early bird gets the worm
But all you can think about is getting a touch-up on your perm
If knowledge is power and power is knowledge, then
How so many idiots be graduating from colleges?
Better to be silent than be thought a fool
Than to speak and remove all doubt
You know what I'm talking about
When opportunity knocks you better let him in and sit him on down
And try to be his friend
In order to be a professional first you got to be a beginner
But if you keep on pushing you can be a winner

Chorus

Verse Three:

Red yellow black white or brown
If everybody mind their business we can all get down
It all starts at home
Cause once they're grown they're gone
And once they're on their own their own
You got to leave them alone
Be a leader, but if you can't be a leader
Make sure your leader is a damn good teacher and
Imagine if you was in a car and your life was a race
Somebody was on your back and you had to give him some space
Put the pedal to the metal where it match at low
But make sure you stay in your lane
And go stroke for stroke
We don't need no penalties or eliminations
Or disqualifications
What we need is penetrations
Now what you heard before but sometimes life is what you make it
I ain't the one thats known for fakin or perpetratin
If Albert was an Einstein
And Phillis was a Diller
And Michael Jackson was a thriller
Then you could be a winner
