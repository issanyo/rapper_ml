Chorus:
When night falls over the city
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me

Verse 1:
It's ten o'clock and darkness covers my area
And every night it's gettin a little bit more scarier
The eleven o'clock Monday news is mo like a horror flick
People sure have changed, it seems that they enjoying this
Death and destruction
With no instruction
Leads to malfunction, disruption, and full consumption
How can I escape this mind state that I'm in?
I been tryin, but it seems that I can't win
I've fallen and I can't get up
And the homies that was my homies went and set me up
Somebody tried to tell me that it was all in my brain
I tried to act a hard male runnin cocaine
But it still don't ease my pain
Am I insane or a victim of my own fears?
What's goin on we supposed to be happy here
God don't make no junk that's what I been told
But it seems to me that God ain't in control

Chorus:
When night falls over the city (When the night falls)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like (Feels like somebody)
Somebody's comin to get me (When the night falls)

When night falls over the city (When the night falls, Ooh-yeah)
I gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me (Comin to get me)

Verse 2:
I need assistance, but all I get is resistance
I try to be persistent, but life can be gone in an instant
I'm scared to turn around cause I know somebody's watching
I can feel they evil stares, and I know that they plottin on me
And scheamin, I wish I was dreamin
If my mind was free I could chase away the demons
But in ain't, and they still can't understand that
All I ever wanted in life was a chance to be a man
The same old pattern has got me goin crazy, loc
Descendent of a king, but I feel like a royal joke
Is this a sequel?
Are all men created equal?
The lies you told to the people back then now they is lethal
And now we swimmin in a pool like shark bait (Like shark bait!)
Feel my pulse race, abnormal heart rate (Heart rate!)
And now I'm startin to feel like I might come up missin
I tried to tell somebody but nobody wouldn't listen

Chorus:
When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over the city)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me (Comin to get me)

When night falls (When the night falls, yeah) over the city
I gotta be ready cause it feels like (I wanna be)
Somebody's comin to get me (Comin)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooohhhh

Verse 3:
I'm feelin oppressed, this stifle
My life is trifle
No family, friends, or relations, so I sleep with my rifle
And my pistol, I'm seein stars and hearin whistles
One shot from a little junky ass twenty-two will tear a whole in your gristle
Won't stay to state side
Cause the unpure fall off the fall by the way side
So stay your ass on the plate side
There's nothin to fear but the fear itself
And if you control the fear then the fear is wealth
Do I have power or do I have no self control?
These long, lonely nights have made my heart grow cold
Hear my pleads, can somebody help a G
And, will we fight this battle for eternity
I blame you cause my mind is not my own
So, don't blame me if I trespass in yo zone
I'm your creation
The product of a twisted nation
Guess this is what you're facin (Facin!)

Chorus:
When night falls (When the sun goes down) over the city (Over the city)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me (Somebody help me!)

When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over the city)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like (Over the city, over the city, over the city!)
Somebody's comin to get me

When night falls (When the night falls) over the city
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me

When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over!)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me

When night falls over the city
I gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin to get me (Comin to get me, get me, get me, get me, get me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooohhhh
