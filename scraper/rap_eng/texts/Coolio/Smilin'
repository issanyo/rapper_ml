Chorus:

You got me smilin'
Again you
Got me smilin again
Smilin'
Again you
Got me smilin', again

Rhyme 1:

One night of pleasure nine months of pain
Three days later and that's when you came
Two arms two legs ten fingers ten toes
Brown eyes like mom, with your grandmothers nose
Even though you're momma's baby
And daddy's little baby
My love is unconditional to one of us is swayze
Day or night, roll the light
No matter what you do
Like the Jackson 5 said I'll be there for you coz
My life is your life and your life is mine
To thinkin'en I'm your friend 'til the end of time
I'll make sure you get your props
You can call me pops
And anything you need I'll pull it out of the stops
Even though we're not together like we used to be
D A D D Y, you can count on me
Coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into your eyes and then smile again

Chorus

Rhyme 2:

Forget about Batman, Superman and the Power Rangers
Coz I'mma be your hero if you ever in some danger
This ain't the huxtables and my name ain't Cliff
No matter how old you get you could get that ass whipped
Daddy don't take no mess
And I ain't gone settle for nothing less than your very best
When I do what I do coz you did what you did
It's coz I ain't the kind of father that be raising no dum-ass kids
You gosta be a leader, it's my responsiblity to teach ya
Right from wrong, and make decisions of your own
I never said that I was perfect
But I know that you're worth it so
I'ma do my damnest to make sure you get some chances
So just listen to your daddy coz he tryin to tell ya something
And don't let nobody tell ya I don't love ya coz they frontin'
Coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into your eyes and then smile again

Chorus

Rhyme 3:

Every day is a struggle when life is like a puzzle
That we gotta put together
Together so and ever
You need a shoulder to cry on and someone you can rely on
Your daddy's home
I'm tryin'a build a foundation on which you could stand
When you's a grown woman and you's a grown man
I got open ears when the world ain't tryin' hear
When I can't be there in the flesh I be there in the spir-it
I'm tryina make an impression on the things that you care for
The knowledge that I give, you could teach your kids
I know it's hard growing up coz I used to be a youngsta
So we don't work as a team, saw the liquor take us under
People let me tell ya about my best friends
Coz I'm down with the children all the way 'til the end
Coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into their eyes and then smile again
