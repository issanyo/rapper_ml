Is you, in it to win it, though, in it to spend it witchu
Knew what you were looking for, from the beginning
You wanna make it with chips, that's holding the riffs
Floating gators and psychics in my brand new timmins
A house and a job, I'll be at 5th in a pinch
No tension, just a big dick at attention
Did I mention, daddy's willing and ready
To take you shopping with no (thoughts???)
(???to the deeds to be dropping from your visit???)
(???make a dollar fool to be spending???)
(???he'd be the man, and you like the wealth he be living)
Fake cheddar
Everyday flipping and grilling
But you're nervous cause you really don't no one's attention
Is it true?
Or is it just a body you walk in, to keep laughing
Cause he always jumping and talking
Hips, lips, fingertips, diamonds and pearls
All around the world, I like the girls

CHORUS: ooh wee I like girls, I like girls, I like girls X4

But the red lights and stop signs, parlay with the stop time
(???It's already cracking???) as soon as I drop mine
Strap lines, white players and pimp
I'm permanent in the game, y'all niggas are temp
But back to the lecture at hand and no spit
Y'all fools gotta learn to be subtle with women
If baby got gift at Madison homey, yes
Honey got her own but don't act funny and
Treat her like she's special without spending a penny
She walked in and you showed her, take her to dinner
Will out a candle, and light it like a romeo low
And then look her in the eye, and tell her you broke
And if she trip on her grip, then it's time to chase
Cause you ain't got time for those, you got dollars to make
Gothia, Tammy, Sabrina, Tina, Sheena and Carol
All around the world, I like the girls

CHORUS: ooh wee I like girls, I like girls, I like girls X4

I like girls, ooh wee I like girls, I like girls (coolio.com)

Short ones, tall ones, fat ones, skinny ones
Not just any one, but gimme one
Hoes and bitches, sluts and chickens
Fuck what they talking about, I like women
Black ones, white ones, yellow ones, brown ones
It's hard on a brother when you looking for down one
Found one, then I, think you better keep her
But do your whole world before you go to see the preacher
If she got potential then, you could try to take her
If she don't, just sleep her, homeboy cause it's cheaper
That's what the 600 cell phone on your beeper
And cheese in your pocket can make you the leader
So call the rats out, with all the tats out
Here comes the pied piper falls false than the viper
Long hair, short hair, straight or curls
Bring it over here baby, I like girls

CHORUS: ooh wee I like girls, I like girls, I like girls X8
