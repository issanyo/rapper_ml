[Verse One: Coolio]

Seven in the morning, standing in the line
Three fools in front of me, drinking on some wine
Two in the back of me, sucking on a joint
And one in back of them, begging for a newport
There's 4-5 suckers way way in the back
Stooped down low in the crowd smokin' crack
They looking at me funny coz I got a record out
And a nigga with a record out I supposed to have some clout
A fourth of the people in the line need help
But the other fourth of that haven't helped they'self
A fourth of the people haven't been fed
And all of the rest are fucked up in the head
A bald headed stank bitch is about to make me laugh
And a nigga who need a bath is asking for my autograph
Ain't nothing changed but the time
I got to get mine, so I'm standing in the county line

[Hook: Coolio]

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Coz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
You got to have a car in this land of milk and honey

[Verse Two: Coolio]
I walked through the front door, fill out my app
Here comes another sap asking if I rap
I don't say a word coz he know that I do
I'm down with the MAAD ass U know Hoo!
I take a number and a seat
I'm sweating from the heat
Somebody got their shoes off
I smell they feet
My number is 80, it's still on 20
I look up at the clock and now IS 10:30
Free butter and cheese oh please, oh please
Can I get my food stamps so I can leave
I got money and a car but they don't really know it
Now they ask a gang of questions coz I told them I was homeless
I'm living in a car drive back in the alley
But I use to shack up with a hooker named Sally
Line after line
Ruff is the time
My life is in a bind
So I'm standing in the county line

Chorus

[Verse Three: Coolio]
I'm sittin' at a desk talking to a social worker
She thinks I'm a fool but I know that I can jerk her

-Punk ass ho' sittin' behind the window all toe up ass tramp
Runnin that ol' weak shit talkin bout

"You have a penetentry record"
-I said I know that BIATCH!

She wants to know what kind a work do I do
I said I haven't worked since 1982
I can't find a job though I looked and I've looked
Took one hit of the crack and was hooked
She sittin there wondering when i'll get the point
And the whole time I'mma wishing I can smoke me a joint
Job search worker project fat-necks
And in a few weeks I'd get my check
Now I got to wait for them to call me through the window
So I can get a voucher for the hotel and the bathshow
It's 5:13 by the clock on the wall
Mothafuckez move so I can make a phonecall
Shit's getting nutty and times is 29
That why so many niggas just standing in the county line

Chorus 2X to fade
