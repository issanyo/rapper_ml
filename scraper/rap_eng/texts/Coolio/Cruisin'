I love it when we're cruisin' together
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby get in we fixin' to cruise till we can't
You got the drink I got the denk and we done stopped at the bank
Sunbeamin' this weekend heading down that beach way
Messin' with my girl's hair one of them games that we play
Braids bouncin to the beat feel me coming down the street
She gotta be a freak if she's sittin' next to me so
Shine up your hoopty and fall in line
Bring your honey if she's fine and we gon have a good time
To the outskirts of first buzzin off the erky jerks
Swoopin while I puts in work now watch me skirt
I heard 'em callin' me but they not ballin' see
Cause if you're ballin' me you got your own set of keys
The breeze is hittin' don't think you'll catch me strippin'
40 Thevz Wino and gat got that back when we're dippin
To the west coast down south in your direction
Throwin up the hood cruisin' come on we jettin'

I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love

MALIKA:
Put one in my lap get in an' twist the cap
Hand him the jizz back clownin' up the coast like that
Tanqueray all nice in back seat peep
This duo rollin' top down ready to hit the streets
Shoulder to shoulder turnin' heads cause it's a black thing
Sport in a 'vette brings me strapped won't be no jackin'
Consider that chocolate, mixed with that tie
Wind be on my neck the beach caress my thighs now I hope he's high
Ready to get my groove on so I'm playing tease
Know when he's feelin' me, and what those feelin's be
Kinda' flossy cause tossy we do it on seat tip
Snuggled up freaky dick give the drink a sip
Leaning on his chest I feel security
Just my man and me against the world you understandin' me
Cruisin' to the sunsets yep we'll be headin out
Dippin' through the city me and my niggys what I'm talkin about

I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us

Sunday afternoons in the tape deck
My woman's on the right lookin bomb for this trek deck
Floatin' on the freeway at a cool 65
Malika rolls the top so's I can feel that rocky mountain high yeah
Take the wheel while I shake off this headrush
Yep I'm down the bust like no one like what
Watchin' the sunset be the flyest with the top down
Park up at the spot I ain't gonna front I'm tryin to mess around
MALIKA:
Your homies still around
Coolio:
Yeah they busy though
MALIKA:
That's all I need to know roll up the windows and lock the door
It's all that poppin on that cooze got me worked up
Turn up the beat and bump in-between the seats some
Coolio:
Yeah that's how we do it on the western hemisphere
All my homies be a man cause ain't no pretendin'
Cruisin feel the wind blow my brains back
Trippin off into the night bumpin' to a fat track yeah
