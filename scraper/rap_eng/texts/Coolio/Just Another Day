Chorus:
Just another day
Kickin it in the hood
Smoking on a blunt
Feelin' kinda good

Just another day
Kickin' it in the hood
Sippin' on some Yak
Feelin' kinda good

Verse 1:
Chillin at the bar
?? ??  ???  ???
The 64s ?? on the ground
The sounds bumpin & the 64s jumping
I'm bound to get some ass
I looked in the corner, what did i see?
Some of the ???   ???  ???
I said to my homie what they hit for?
He said i ??  ??? and i said lets go
???? you can't fade me
I went and came back with the funky 6-3
Right through the door came his friend 5-4
Looked at my homie and said don't you know
(Came in the door)
Pass me the yak
Give me the dice
And homie stepped back

Chorus:
Just another day
Kickin it in the hood
Smoking on a blunt
Feelin kinda good

Just another day
Kickin it in the hood
Sippin on some Yak
Feelin kinda good

Verse 2:
I'm chilling a the crib talking on the phone
Tryna get the homies to come play some bones
Then said Coolio, this is what I'm gonna do
I got the charcoal and the lighter fluid too
You brings the chicken Snaps get the ??
Tiger hit the store to get the drinks
Roll out the table lets play some Bones
Low man get up and take his punk ass home
Nick the Greek is a booty freak
At time to time  make it sound so sweet
???  ??? as i go
Give me my 10 when i domino

Chorus:
Just another day
Kickin it in the hood
Smoking on a blunt
Feelin kinda good

Just another day
Kickin it in the hood
Sippin on some Yak
Feelin kinda good


Verse 3:
Chillin on the porch
Sippin on some brew
Another sunny day in Compton, Californ-i-a
Picked up the phone to call up the homies
Said what we gon' do today?
We can go to the park, maybe to the beach
Crack a few 40s and talk to some freaks
Don't keep me waiting
And pick up a sack from the Jamaicans
But before i can hang up the phone
A raggedy ass cutlass hit the corner
I said to myself
Damn am I a goner?
Shots came firing but they missed, G
I go behind the counter, guess i'm lucky
But it's just another day
But i'm safe

Chorus:
Just another day
Kickin it in the hood
Smoking on a blunt
Feelin kinda good

Just another day
Kickin it in the hood
Sippin on some Yak
Feelin kinda good
