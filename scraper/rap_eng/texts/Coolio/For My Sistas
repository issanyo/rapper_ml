[Verse 1: Coolio]
Now I done use the word bitch a few times in a rhyme
But now it's '95 so let me drop a line
This goes out to the young Black queens
On the neighborhood scene who haven't lost their dream
I know sometimes it seems like it ain't no love
And to get where you go ya got to push and shove
Around the way girl with hope in your heart
Deuce-five in the purse and five in the start
She's the kinda woman ya take home to mama
The only kind you ever let get past the drama
Coolio know that you ain't no ho
And it's time to put you up on a pedestal seat
Queen of the entire universe
And you know how I know that you were put here first
To every nigga that dissed ya and every nigga that hit ya
Accept my apologies for my brothas, my sista

Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
You're all I need

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Princess of the Nile, sweet black sexy child
Ooh, I like your style, huh
First mother on the planet, I know it's gettin' scary
And all these wannabe pimps is all that ya meet
But ya gotta shake 'em off like fleas and nigga meat
And use your God-given talents and abilities
No matter where ya from ya get much respect
From the top of your neck to your county check
I see ya waitin' for the bus in the early morn
Brick house with a face like Leena Horne
I ain't no cap to save a ho but I got your front
And your side and your back if that's what ya want
So when it's time to put it down, I won't be runnin'
Ya got a dear lil' somethin' like Harriet Tubman, huh
No matter what ya do or where ya go
Ya got love from a nigga named Coolio
My sista

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Hernie Dipp got the lips, finger tips, and the hips
To make mice outta the crazy-ass Bloods and Crips
Make a nigga sing a song all night long
'Til his voice is gone with no music on
You can be a busta on a hard-ass low
And should be down with your ass when your poor and broke
And um uh, every time ya need I'll owe ya
Gotta do is make a phone call, cause
When ya say 'come' ya know she's on her way
With no hesitance and any type of delay
I talk about my granny, Batana, and Vanita
Jackie and Nicole and Grandy and Artisha
I gots to give credit where credit is due
And all credit that is credited is credit to you
I give praise to your ways and for all my day
Apologies much respect to the sons I raise
My sista
