[Verse 1]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left
'Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind has gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya' talking and where ya' walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta lob
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda g' that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, saying prayers in the streetlight

[Chorus]
We've been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We've been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2]
Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television-watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a locked out gangsta, set tripping banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothing but a heart beat away
I'm living life do or die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is going I don't know

[Bridge]
Tell me why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me?

[Chorus]
We've been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We've been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3]
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cooking
They say I gotta learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

[Chorus]
We've been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We've been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

[Bridge]
Tell me why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me?

Tell me why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me?

Tell me why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me?
