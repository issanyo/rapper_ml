Seven in the morning, standing in the line
Three fools in front of me, drinking on some wine
Two in the back of me sucking on a joint
And one in back of them ready for a new sport
There's 4-5 suckers way way in the back
Stooped down low with the crowd smokin' crack
They looking at me funny coz I got a record out
And a nigga with a record out is supposed to have some proud
A forth of the people in the line be hookers
But the other forth betta ask help themself
A forth of the people having good faith
And all of the rest all fucked up in the head
A bald headed stank bitch is about to make me laugh
And a nigga who need a bath is asking for my autograph
Ain't nothing changed but the time
I got to get mine, so I'm standing in the county line

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Coz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
You got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny

I walked through the front door to fill out my ap
Here comes another sap asking if I rap
I don't say a word coz he know that I do
I'm down with the MAAD ass U know Hoo!
I take a numer and a seat
I'm sweating from the heat
Somebody got their shoes off
I smell their feet
My number is 80, it's still on 20
I look up at the clock and now IS 10:30
Free butter and cheese oh please, oh please
Can I get my food stamps so I can leave
I got money and a car but they don't really know it
Now they asking me a gang of questions coz I told them I was homeless
I'm living in a car drive back in the alley
But I use to shack up with a hooker named Sally
Line after line
Ruff is the time
My life is in a bomb so I'm standing in the county line

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Coz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
You got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny

I'm sittin' at a desk talking to a social worker
She thinks I'm a fool but I know that I can work her

-Punk ass ho' sittin' behind the window all toe up ass tramp
Rollin' that week sheets of mine

You have a penetentry record
-I said I know that BIATCH!

She wants to know what kind a work do I do
I said I haven't worked since 1982
I can't find a job though I looked and I looked
Took one hit of the crack and mistook
She sittin there wonderin' what did coz I did
And the whole time I'ma watchin like I'm smokin me a joint
Job search work the projects whackness
And in a few weeks I'd get my check
Now I got to wait for them to call me trough the window
So I can get some cash to pay for the hotel and the bathshow
It's 5:13 by the clock on the wall
Mothafuckez move so I can make a phonecall
Shit is getting late and the time is 29
That why so many niggas standing in the county line

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Coz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
You got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Coz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
You got to have the conned, and let'n them looking funny
