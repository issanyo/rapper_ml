[Montell]
I called you on the phone
To see if you was at home alone
Somethin' just ain't right
Tell me, where were you last night?
You were supposed to be with me
And I paged your ass around 10:33
You didn't even call me back
Now tell me, baby, what up wit that?

Now you told me you need
A man like me from the streets
Remember when I was tossin'
That ass on 4th and Slawson
You said I was everything you want
And now all the condoms that I bought
I gotta box 'em up for the next one
Cuz you just wanna flex and have your fun, baby

[Coolio]
You wanna play those games
Thought you was dealin' wit a flea
But you're dealin' wit a G
You better recognize the C, double O, L
I'm down wit Montell (how you livin' homie?)
I'm livin' kinda swell
I thought you was the one, yeah
I thought you was my baby
Now I see through your games and I know you're tryin' to play me
So you can put your pumps on and get your rump on
Cuz your hump ain't that strong
Well, you can have my Land Rove
Give me 30 minutes and a fifth of yak
And I'll rip that, smack that, hit that ass
Like King-T do's it
I got to go rippin' it
Put you to the side, so I can catch up on my pimpin'
Ya better make a left wit the bullshit you stickin' me with
Brothas be hittin' up they hood on your kitten
My partner don't play that
Yeah, I had to say that
What go around, come back around
This is the payback

[Montell]
And it feels just like payback
Ay yo, who's pimpin' who?
And shit like that
All those games you're tryin' to play
You'll miss out on a good thing baby
(It feels like) Payback
Who's playin' who, girl?
Cuz that was kinda wack
All those gizames, you're tryin' to plizay
Yeah

Girl, it feels like payback
I really really hate to say that
I thought you was triflin', givin' me the shove
But you're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love
(Oh, I thought she was mad as hell, cuz I was for one thing)
Way back I was cheatin'
You wanna get even, but I ain't goin' out like that
If I apologize for all the lies
Oh, believe me girl, I'm sorry
There's a right and a wrong way to love somebody
And I know the right way
Can we start tonight babe?
You need to lose that loser in a hurry
And you're never gonna have to worry
No, no, hell no

Feels like payback
Who's pimpin' who?
And shit like that
All those games you're tryin' to play
You'll miss out on a good thing, baby
It feels like payback
Mistakes that I made (way back) baby
All those gizames you're tryin' to plizay
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love

Feels like payback
Who's pimpin' who?
And shit like that
All those games you're tryin' to play
(All those games that you were tryin' to play)
(Said it feels just like) Feels like payback
Who's playin' who, girl?
Cuz that was kinda wack
All those gizames your tryin' to plizay
Oh, girl

We'll miss that loving that we shared for oh so long
Let's put this all behind us
And love will always find us
You see, all of your men and my girlfriends
They'll all be in the past
We'll be solid as a rock
And we'll make it
We'll make it
Yeah, yeah, hey hey
Gonna miss out on a good...

It feels just like it
