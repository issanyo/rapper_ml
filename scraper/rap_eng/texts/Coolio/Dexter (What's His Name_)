[Verse 4]
Mandark, take a hike
Dee Dee, go fly a kite
While Dexter takes his bike
Makes a rocket and speeds into the night
To alleviate your confusion, I don't know what TV you're usin'
But you better tune in to see what Dexter is doin'
I'll meet you in the laboratory
If not, drinkin' juice and look out the window
And watch the morning-glories grow
That's how the story shakes up
You man, humans better wake up
Before aliens overtake us
Eatin' and steak us
Barbecue and bake us
Like dinner and breakfast
But whose got technology to save the world?
His name is Dexter
That's right, I said Dexter!
There's no young boy cartoon genius better

The most intelligent minds in the world want to know
Who's standin' two and a half feet high with stylish glasses and a lab coat
What's his name? Y'all know his name
Y'all know his game is science, we need need your complete compliance
Don't touch that dial, don't change that channel
Don't push that button, don't you do nothin'
Don't you be frontin' on Dexter and Dee Dee
Every day on the Cartoon Network

Left brain, right brain, center brain, all brain
Scientifically superior boy master of all games
Rocket science, car, TV and appliance
