Aww here it goes

Everybody out there go run and tell
Your homeboys and home girls it's time for Keenan and Kel
They keep you laughing in the afternoon
So, don't touch that dial or leave the room

'Coz they're always into something
It's fun and you don't wanna miss it
It's double K, like 2 the good radius
Keenan and Kel or should I say Kel and Keenan

But you gotta watch Keenan 'coz
Keenan be scheming
With a plan or a plot
To make it to the top

But they kinda in the middle
'Coz they're always gettin' caught
This ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery
It's just Keenan and Kel in your vicinity

Like Seigfried and Roy, Stan and Costella
Magic and Kareem or Penn and Teller
Somebody's in trouble

Aww here goes
On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Nick
