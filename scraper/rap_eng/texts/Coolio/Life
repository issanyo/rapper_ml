Intro: yo, I'm gonna talk to y'all about life for a minute (coolio)

Verse 1: I'm going to a chain cause it ain't the same
I remain no geak,  just to play the game
Trying to brake this chain off my brain so I can gangsta change
(???Tank dime pain of shame and the pimp with the weekend lane???)
The strain is too much too bear, I'm there but I ain't scared
I pray to god, hope he care, snared in the devil's lair
I hope that's not in heaven, trying to get my share, and I
Hope that my hopes and dreams don't burn and flare
But I'm aware
A life ain't promised, trying to avoid the drama
And live up the expectations for my dear old mama
Inside there's also a fool, inside the court building
Make a million and maybe then we can save for our children
Face to face with fate trying to escape that but it's too late
So I grab the world, escape, hope I don't have to wait, to get my stripes
I've seen the life and all the pain and suffer and strife
So I put my name in the book

Chorus: life x4 (what life) that's life life life (that's life)

Verse 2: ok now, here's the situation
I was raised in a racist nation and given an inferior education
My representation is in a fucked up area in the inner city
Where life is shitty, and the average self esteem is itty bitty
But we ain't looking for no pity, you can miss me
Go ahead and talk but if you diss me
They have to come and get me
They wanna pimp me from my sin
Acting like they're down but they're against me
Tempt me to touch, eat it up until it's empty
Take my chance in a penitentiary, no touchdown for a century
Get rid of me, you feeling me, that's why I'm waiting in the bushes
And for those that are responsible, you're dealing with all pushing
Put yourself in my position, would you all and would you listen
Under these conditions would be opposed if some bodies coming up missing
When the lights come home, when you run like moses and mice
Or think twice if you don't hear your name called from the book

Chorus: Life x4 (That's life) That's life life life (That's life)

Verse 3:
Can you stand the rain, this life is driving me insane
But I'm a man, so I remain, steady caught up in the game
Make a deal with dick and jane
Trying to make a little change
One from the homies, bang, and slang 'caine with they hand out
And they tripping on everybody, cousin blunt so get your thing out
We're ready to roll when they come through
Show no fear when they hunt you
If you have to use gun foo, they ask for the one-two
Everything but the kitchen sink, we act quickly, don't think
And don't sink to their level cause they in league with the devil
Be quick from the race and try to keep a straight face
And just like you, sometimes I don't feel like I belong in this place
Hip hop is my profession, so I gotta keep on guessing
Make it black and white lack another in my session
Coming from the west, and this microphone I'm blessing
So I'm testing, check it, I'm talking about life, that life

Chorus x2: Life x4 (My life) That's life life life (That's life)
Outro: I'm just trying to live my life, you try to live your life
You want me to smack your face, give me my space
It's all about style, I know you got style, life is all about me
Nothing lives without life, my life, your life, coast to coast life
