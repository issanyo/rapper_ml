Starlight
Starbright
First star I see tonight
I wish I may
I wish I might
Get this lick I try to hit tonight....

Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me

Everytime I think about it I still can't understand
What make these niggas think they don't need a plan
Cuz if you don't have a plan, then
Tell me what you got
For your get rich quick scheme
A buster-ass plot
Niggas be punkin' out, loc
Dyin' over nothin'
It's the ghetto witch doctor with another loco potion
Hickory
Dickory
Thievery
Trickery
Poverty
Misery
Pleads to insanity
Homocide
Robbery
Grand theft
Burglary
Perjury
Emergency surgery
A.P.B
They lookin' for a G
You ran through a field
Hopped a fence
And climbed a tree
9-1-1
Here they come, come
Nigga wit' a gun
Now your ass is done
Ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to run
Cuz the helicopter light's as bright as the sun....

(Chorus)
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Bright as the sun
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Bright as the sun

It seems nowadays
Just to get some respect
Ya gots to roll a Lex and collect a fat check
Or come around the corner on three, hoppin'
Blockin' up the street
Flossy Mac on your D's
An' everybody sayin' you're the man, loc
Never broke
An' high off that premo smoke
Sippin' in the sea
Rollin' in the ragtop Chevy '63
The p-i-m-p
On top of the game
But now you're gettin' lame
Cuz the yak, weed, and yayo's playin' tricks on your brain
You're lookin' for a way out
Before your game play out
Cuz once you game play out
Ya lose all ya' kriz out
Late one night you was rollin' down the block
With a half a pint of yak and the twenty dollar rock
One time got behind you and they told you to stop
But you kept rollin' cuz ya said you wasn't goin'
Out like a sucka
You dumb mothafucka
Now the chase is on
An' here go the song
How in the hell do you think you can run
When the helicopter light's as bright as the sun

-Chorus-

Lockdown since the '80s
Situation number three
A nigga is released from the penitentiary
Fools betta recognize
An' visualize
Don't be suprized
Ya betta realize
They got a plan fo' your ass
A gauge for the mass, so
If you're rollin' dirty, then you betta have a stash
Spot in your whoopty
An' know the whoompty whoofty
When the whoompty whafty is done unto you, see
He don't know the new game
'Cuz the new game ain't true game
But he betta catch up quick
Becuz the old game is rank
Nine is his waist
That's the new game loc, cuz
If you ain't heated then you might get smoked
He was walkin' down the street
Mindin' his business
Just happy to be free
And what do we see?
From the corner of his eye
Here come one time
So off he dashed
Like they set fire to his ass
Cuz if he get caught
It's strike number three
An' this might be his last day on the street
I bet ya next time you'll listen when I tell ya, son
That the helicopter light's as bright as the sun

-Chorus (extended)-
