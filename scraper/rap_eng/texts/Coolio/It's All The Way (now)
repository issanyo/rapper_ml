Coolio - It's All The Way (Now)
=================================

Chorus:
It’s all the way live, it’s all the way live
It’s all the way live, it’s all the way live
Why you take a chunk and go up for a dunk?
An?I never been a punk but your girl calls me hunk
Straight to the hoop and I know how to shoot
If you wanna know the truth then you better get the scoop
Comin?up to miss wit?my mic in my fist
An?everybod’s lookin?so you know I gotta bit
You take me, that can’t be
Shook an?took like all rookies
So if you’re a beginner an?you want wanna be a winner
Then you better have some spinach with your dinner
So just put your head to the sky, if you wanna ride
And keep you eye on the flies ‘cause it’s live
Chorus
What you see is what you get
And what you got is a whole lotta sweat
Blood and tears, so have no fear
‘Cause they ain’t seen moves like these in years
I can shake it bake it, show the fake
But never perpetrate or player hate
My name ain’t rappin?but funkdified
My name ain’t Lou but I can walk the sky
So put it over here homie low, an?go for broke
And watch the smoke but make sure you don’t choke
Put your head to the sky, if you wanna ride
And keep you eye on the flies ‘cause it’s live
Chorus
Ooo the music’s in the groove
It’s the rap that makes you move
‘Cause Lakeside show-ed up at the party
Ooo the music’s in the groove
It’s the rap that makes you move
Coolio show-ed up at the party
Chorus
This ain’t Penny Hardaway or Kareem Abdul
It’s Coolio in the house but you can call me cool
An?I gotta keep it real for my peeps on the street
You can fill it in your feet or bump it in your jeep
From sea to shinning sea the rows of century
Bend under Sicily I put it down for the G
Feel the fire, feel the funk
An?you better clear the lane when I’m goin?dunk
I ain’t looking for protocol, got sumpin?for all o?y’all
To make you get your back up off the ball
Just put your head to the sky, if you wanna ride
And keep you eye on the flies ‘cause it’s live
Chorus
