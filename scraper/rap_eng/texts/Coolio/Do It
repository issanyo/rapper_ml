Let's do it, get to it
Let's do it, get to it
Let's do it, get to it
Let's do it

Another Saturday night and I'm feelin' kinda slothy
I'm down with the forty, but I don't want no forty
Even though I'm thirsty and I'm hungry
I need some Kurathers

Peep this, but not up in my stomach
I wanna chop your cherry tree, I can't tell a lie
Somethings on the rise, what a surprise
I called up the homies and said, "Let's go the spot"

Where the drinks are cold, and the girls ain't too hot
Now we in the house, but the house is kinda empty
Rats run around the room but, wait, I spoke too soon
Ah, damn, look what done walked in

Pumps and a bump, breath smellin' like gin
Baby, you look good with that blue dress on
Maybe some day me and you can be as one
Let's get to know each other better
I can sing you a song, and you can write me a love letter

1 Baby, you can do it
Take your time, do it right
(Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby
(Let's do it, get to it)

Baby, you can do it
Take your time, do it right
(Let's do it, get to it)
You can do it, baby, baby
(Let's do it, get to it)

Damn, I'm feelin frisky
Come and sit down wit me
Conversate about hanky panky
And a little dranky wanky

Tell me bout your innermost thoughts
Wants, needs and your desires
And I'll tell you about mine
We can spend some quality time

You want a man with vision, who ain't afraid to listen
I wanna mention I can hit that ass in thirty-six positions
And, I just want a regular old fashion high hoochie mama
With love for her daddy, anytime he want it
Bring home the turkey bacon and fry it in the pan
Or, some fillet minon and still let me know I'm the
