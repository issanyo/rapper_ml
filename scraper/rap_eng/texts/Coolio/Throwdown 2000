Chorus:
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And give a loc a little dap when he walks through

Verse 1:
If there be a dope beat then all y'all see
Get up out your seat and let me see yo technique
Freak yo physique and you betta not compete
Make it hot and sweaty like twenty deep in a jeep
Never comin' cheap, forty creep
And I hope you don't mind if I borrow a few things while you go to sleep
I steal money from the rich
And give it to the poor, it's
Coolio loco and ghetto witch doctor super, you are
Bring it from the back and bring it to the front
Cause you gotta give the people what they want
Now hump, do the stomp to the butt
Big homie shake your gut
As long as you get your ass up
It's a party over here
And let me make it clear
40 Thevz is the crew
So you better come anew
Ain't a damn thing change since the first one
And if you didn't hear the album go get one (One)

Chorus:
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And give a loc a little dap when he walks through

Verse 2:
Here come the thief on the old school beat
And I never knew the meaning of the word "defeat"
The master of disguise wanna see the people's eyes
Yet, fools try to deny that the ?man? can fly
Just cook 'em all up like gumbo
And block their ass like Mutumbo
Cause your album dropped off the charts like Dumbo
We are new and improved to make you put on your boogie shoes
Like K.C. and the Sunshine Band, or the Wu-Tang Clan
I go way back like Vegas, Nixon, Noreaga
It's the tennis shoe players fat box on the quiet station
Now what if hip hop was like Humpty Dumpty sittin' on the wall
And what if hip hop had to take a great fall
And what if rhyme was a crime
And each and every time
That you spit a dope line
You might have to do some time
Most of these clowns will be tryin' to skip town
But Coolio will be ready for the showdown

Chorus:
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down' like your 'posed to
And pass a joint to the loc when he roll through

Verse 3:
If the shoe fit, put it on and stick
And if your ass uncash don't let your mouth write no check
Fools be in the bars unadvanced with a switch
Uppercuts and fight kicks with Weird Al Yankovich
From Tokyo to Sojo, rollin wit the 4-0
This hip hop that I'm holdin' I'll make it move your ho
It's the Vandino, everything but rhyme's broken
Breakin' a nigga with first position at the open
You can't understand how I do it
I'm just true to it
I let my pen flow across the paper like it was made affluent
Uh, let it ring, let it rip
Everybody holler like Marvin Gaye, but don't you let the record skip
Synchronize the watch, cause the party don't stop
Till the neighborhood watch call the cops
It's the wild ass festival, coast line veteran
Once again droppin' bombs on yo section (On yo section)

Chorus:
Are you ready to throwndown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And pass the brew to the loc when he roll through
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
And give a loc a little dap when he roll through
Fool!
