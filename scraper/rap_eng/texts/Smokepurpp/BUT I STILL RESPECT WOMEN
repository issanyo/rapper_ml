[Intro]
Bitch
Purpp
Uh!
Yeah

[Chorus]
I got a bitch in Atlanta
She love sucking dick when we ride in the Mazi
I take a trip to the bank
And I grab 20 bands and I take it to Follies
Caught a bitch checking my phone
And I don't even care I'm like "Fuck it, she caught me"
Bitch wanna argue with me
But I said it one time "Sorry, I don't say sorry"
I got a bitch in New York, we just fuck and we fight
Then she chill in the lobby
I let her dive in the pussy, I dance on that bitch
And I'm like "Fuck it, I'm Bobby"
She don't even care how cheap it is
She fuck a nigga, she taking his wallet
Bitch wanna argue with me, but I said it one time
"Sorry, I don't say sorry"

[Verse]
Sorry, bitch, I don't say sorry
I'm all VLONE like I'm Bari
She sucking my dick in the bathroom
And we in a party, she geeked off the molly
I know I'm a target, I could buy a Target
Whole garage, full of Dracos, they think I'm a Sergeant
Brand new Lambo truck, I don't even wear no seatbelt
Keep that pistol tucked, give a fuck nigga like three shells
Spent ten bands on a coat, fuck nigga, this not retail
She tryna put on some Russ, fell out the truck, I'm like "Oh well"

[Chorus]
I got a bitch in Atlanta
She love sucking dick when we ride in the Mazi
I take a trip to the bank
And I grab 20 bands and I take it to Follies
Caught a bitch checking my phone
And I don't even care I'm like "Fuck it, she caught me"
Bitch wanna argue with me
But I said it one time "Sorry, I don't say sorry"
I got a bitch in New York, we just fuck and we fight
Then she chill in the lobby
I let her dive in the pussy, I dance on that bitch
And I'm like "Fuck it, I'm Bobby"
She don't even care how cheap it is
She fuck a nigga, she taking his wallet
Bitch wanna argue with me, but I said it one time
"Sorry, I don't say sorry"
