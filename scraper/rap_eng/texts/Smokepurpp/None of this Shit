[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I don't want none of this shit
I want a check and a ring
Beyonce the chopper gon' sing
I feel like I'm James with the ring
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I want a check and a ring
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit

[Verse: Smokepurpp]
All of my niggas is animals
Eat a bitch out like a cannibal
All of my niggas is animals
Eat a bitch out like a cannibal
All of my niggas is animals
Eat a bitch out like a cannibal
All of my niggas is animals
Hit 'em with a stick
Hit her with the dick
Chain on my neck, got me feeling sick
Silly rabbit, all these balls, trix are for kids
Tell her suck my dick
Empty out the clip
After suck my dick, then she gotta dip
I'ma stack this cash like some pringles
Yeah bitch, I'm a star, like I twinkle

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I don't want none of this shit
I want a check and a ring
Beyonce the chopper gon' sing
I feel like I'm James with the ring
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I want a check and a ring
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
I don't want none of this shit
