[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Bi-
Bitch, I'm with the robbers
Young handsome nigga, I fuck on your daughter
Drippin' with all of this water
VVS diamonds cost me by the quarter, yuh
Young rich nigga, I really came piped down
Lil' bitch really wanna pipe now
Boyfriend mad so he really wanna fight now

Young nigga hang with the cut-throats

[Post-Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Lil' bitch pussy I'mma bust though
Nigga test me and I'm really finna bust though, hey
Ridin' 'round town with a thot bitch
And I just really want the top, bitch

Young nigga hang with the cut-throats
