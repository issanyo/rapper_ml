[Intro]
Yeah
Oh my god, Ronny

[Hook]
She gon' ride for me because she know I got that fishscale (ouu)
Pick a Louis V bag, Gucci, gotta peep the details
This cost 50 racks, lil baby, no this is not retail (buck)
I don't play no sports but bitch but I know that I cheat well (ouu)

[Verse]
Ayy, hop in that ghost, uh
Popping your head like some toast (skrt skrt)
Run in your house (buck), I'm in your bread like some crow (stripping)
I got 2 shots so you know I'm on fitness
She fucking that ho and I'm all in her business
Houdini, yeah, diamonds all over my genitals
Fucking on twins and them bitches identical
Bitch are a 10 but your ass be rhetorical
Knock your head off and you have a memorial
VVS diamonds all over my Rollie, yo
These niggas know I'm imperial
These are designer, yeah diamond Balenci
Fuck that ho, I don't do no kissing
All Fishscale, you would think I went fishing
Bright red, bright red, leave, went missing
Big bank, that shit little known [?]
One headshot send straight to the bottom
On my gang shit, ain't talking no Slaughter
FL, nigga we don't do no flocking

[Hook 2]
She gon' fuck with me because she know I got that fishscale
I don't been no stylist, I buy everything on resale
Baby run up on me, I'm gon' give his ass a hot shell
With, with a hot shell
Straight to your ass like hot milk
