[Intro]
Murda on tha beat so it's not nice

[Chorus]
I look like a faucet, all these diamonds on me dancin'
That bitch on my dick and then she take my kids for ransom
I just pulled up in that thang, different thangs and they random
Pulled up with a bitch, different bitch and she random
I'mma really have it my way (yeah)
I'mma really have it my way (way)
I'mma really have it my way (yeah)
I be really havin' my way

[Verse]
I be on my own (own)
Prolly smoking cookie all alone (all alone)
I don't wanna smooch I want the dome (I want the dome)
All my money long my money cloned (my money cloned)
Stripper bitch and this your favorite song (your favorite)
I'mma have it my way (woo)
I need all this drank this drank just keep my mind straight (straight, straight)
Jewelry on her hands they going on a playdate (flex, woo)
Jewelry on her hands they going on a playdate (Lil Purpp)
I'mma have it my way (my way)
Jewelry on her hands they going on a playdate (playdate)
I need all this drank this drank just keep my mind straight (Lil Purpp)
Jewelry on her hands they going on a playdate

[Chorus]
I look like a faucet, all these diamonds on me dancin'
That bitch on my dick and then she take my kids for ransom

Pulled up with a bitch, different bitch and she random
