[Chorus]
I get the racks all over my pocket, boy you already know
I do not want to fuck on your bitch because I know she a hoe
Walkin' with bankrolls all up the function havin' them play with they nose
Walkin' with bankrolls all up the function havin' them play with they nose
Play with her nose
She let her play with her nose
Play with her nose
She let her play with her nose

[Verse]
Play with her nose, molly came straight off a boat
Play with her nose, I think she likin' that coke
I just pulled up in the Wraith, close the curtains
Lil Purpp could fuck yo' bitch, yeah that's for certain
I just told her, let me smoke my dope
I just told her, no sex I wanted throat

[Chorus]
I get the racks all over my pocket, boy you already know
I do not want to fuck on your bitch because I know she a hoe
Walkin' with bankrolls all up the function havin' them play with they nose
Walkin' with bankrolls all up the function havin' them play with they nose
Play with her nose
She let her play with her nose
Play with her nose
She let her play with her nose
