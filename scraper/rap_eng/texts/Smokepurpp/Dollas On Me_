[Chorus]
Big bankroll, got dollas on me
Purpp boy shoot that flex up on all my opponents
Hold up, take a moment
Had to wipe my shoe off while I am recording
Fuck your bitch, I hit it right into the morning
Look like I got jumped on with my pockets swollen
Take a moment, look like I got jumped the way my pockets swollen

[Verse 1]
I be ballin'
