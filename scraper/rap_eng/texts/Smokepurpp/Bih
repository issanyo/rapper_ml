[Chorus]
Tell that ho to eat, bih
She say she a freak, bih
Ridin' with that heat, bih
Do that cause I'm me, bih
Tell that ho to eat, bih
She say she a freak, bih
Ridin' with that heat, bitch
Do that cause I'm me, bitch

[Verse]
Water on me like a dolphin
Put a nigga in a coffin
Smokin' OG gas, all 'em cookies got me coughin'
Gelato smellin' like I'm fartin'
All my niggas shoot
.22 hangin' out the roof
Knock the gold out his tooth, pew, pew, pew, pew, shoot
All my niggas move, get that pack and then I move it
Lil Purpp, I'm goin' stupid
Niggas say I'm dumb, I'm goin' dumb, I'm goin' stupid
I can't love no bitch, bitch, I ain't Cupid
AK-47 knock him toothless

[Chorus]
Tell that ho to eat, bih
She say she a freak, bih
Ridin' with that heat, bih
Do that cause I'm me, bih
Tell that ho to eat, bih
She say she a freak, bih
Ridin' with that heat, bitch
Do that cause I'm me, bitch

[Break]

[Chorus]
Tell that ho to eat, bih
She say she a freak, bih
Ridin' with that heat, bih
Do that cause I'm me, bih
Tell that ho to eat, bih
She say she a freak, bih
Ridin' with that heat, bitch
Do that cause I'm me, bitch
