[Intro]
Woohoo
Yeah, my nigga so fat that he thought it was voodoo
I'ma blow so fat that he thought it was voodoo
Chase him down with the choppa, make a nigga doodoo
Come near the block, all you hear is zoom zoom
A Lau on this bitch!

[Chorus]
I always come out on top like a general
Scream fuck the world with my hand on my genitals
All of my niggas got guns, like a general
How many bitches (?)
I always come out on top like a general
Scream fuck the world with my hand on my genitals
All of my niggas got guns, like a general
How many bitches (?)

[Verse 1]
All of these racks, like god damn pipe down
Like look (?)
I'ma get top from a thot, then I tell her I'ma leave and I'll be right back
Ten toes down came straight from the moon, nigga I count these racks up now
Countin' these stacks up now, got a bitch in the back countin' stacks up right now

[Chorus]
Woohoo
Yeah, my nigga so fat that he thought it was voodoo
I'ma blow so fat that he thought it was voodoo
Chase him down with the choppa, make a nigga doodoo
Come near the block, all you hear is zoom zoom
I always come out on top like a general
Scream fuck the world with my hand on my genitals
All of my niggas got guns, like a general
How many bitches (?)
I always come out on top like a general
Scream fuck the world with my hand on my genitals
All of my niggas got guns, like a general
How many bitches (?)
