Sipping mud all day
Can't get up all day

Can't get up all day (Lil Purpp)
I feel dead inside
I can't feel a thing

[Chorus]
Sippin mud all day
Can't get up all day

Fuck your bitch I give her back
Got a strap inside my Goyard bag

Hop out the suburban and its all on blast
Fucking on two model bitches
Riding with two model bitches (Lil Purpp)

40 bands, on my wrist now
Got these bitches going wild
Hop up in the coupe, I ride around, I slide it down

[Chorus]
Sippin mud all day

Sipping mud all day
Can't get up all day
