[Intro: Smokepurpp, TM88, and DJ Plugg]
8
Watch that lil baby
Ftaa!
Damn, DJ Plugg, you just killed it
Ftaa ftaa ftaa!

[Chorus]
Look at the chain, look at my neck, watch that lil baby
Look at the chain, look at my neck, watch that lil baby
Smoking on gas, I'm the Benz
I love the Mercedes
Smoking on gas, I'm the Benz
I love the Mercedes

[Verse 1]
Cooking up brand new Mercedes
Bitch, we got guns like the Navy
EA, I ball like the JVs
I'm whipping it like it was gravy
I used to fuck on that bitch
Threw that hoe out of the crib
She calling back, I'm like "Maybe"
On her FaceTime, (?)
Wrapped 25 'round my neck
(?) all on my chest
I'm pulling your card like a debt
They don't know your name in the jects
Look at this sauce, look at this shoe
Watch that, lil baby
I'm moving fast, I'm in a coupe
I love the 380s
She suck my dick like we dating

[Chorus]
Look at the chain, look at my neck, watch that lil baby
Look at the chain, look at my neck, watch that lil baby
Smoking on gas, I'm the Benz
I love the Mercedes
Smoking on gas, I'm the Benz
I love the Mercedes

Look at the chain, look at my neck, watch that lil baby
Look at the chain, look at my neck, watch that lil baby
Smoking on gas, I'm the Benz
I love the Mercedes
Smoking on gas, I'm the Benz
I love the Mercedes
