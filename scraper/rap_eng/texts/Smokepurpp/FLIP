[Intro: Lil Tracy and Smokepurpp]
Yuh, Tracy, Purpp, Tracy, Lil Purpp (Lil Tracy)
Red Drum on the beat
DJ Flippp, make the money flip
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Make him do a flip, hit him with the clip
And my blood say, "blat", on that bloody shit
Bang it out, bang it out
Bang it out, bang it out
Make him do a flip, hit him with the clip
And my blood say, "blat", on that bloody shit
Bang it out, bang it out
Bang it out, bang it out

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Bang it out, I'm at your door and I air it out
Claimin' the game, better cut it out
Cut off your finger and I'm mailin' out
Geeked up off the purp, I'm sippin' the mud and I'm feelin' like Kurt
Hundred round drum make you sleep on the floor
Sleep in the farm, cause you know I'm the goat
Bitch nigga, you a bitch, nigga, you a snitch, nigga
See you in the streets, I might tie you to a tree, nigga
Bitch nigga, you a motherfuckin' bitch, nigga
See you in the streets, I might tie you and your kids, nigga

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Make him do a flip, hit him with the clip
And my blood say, "blat", on that bloody shit
Bang it out, bang it out
Bang it out, bang it out
Make him do a flip, hit him with the clip
And my blood say, "blat", on that bloody shit
Bang it out, bang it out
Bang it out, bang it out

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Yah
Got the sauce, got the juice, she wanna sip me
Give me good neck, gave my dick a hicky
Walk in the club with my glizzy
Bang it out, bang it out
Glock inside my Gucci purse, my jacket Fendi, yah
I'm rude, you better not offend me
I'm a rock-star, I'm a pop-star, she told me I'm pretty (Thanks)
Wait, whoa, snortin' coke off her titty (Off her titty)

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Make him do a flip, hit him with the clip
And my blood say, "blat", on that bloody shit
Bang it out, bang it out
Bang it out, bang it out
Make him do a flip, hit him with the clip
And my blood say, "blat", on that bloody shit
Bang it out, bang it out
Bang it out, bang it out
