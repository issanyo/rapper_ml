[Chorus]
I'm in the trap, clutching my strap, fucking a bitch with my socks on
I hit from the back, when she ain’t looking my niggas is running her whole home
I'm smoking on cookie, that shit strong
We shoot at the face and the neck bone
Niggas acting like bitches, these niggas is cowards
Been robbing these houses since 14
I'm in the trap, clutching my strap, fucking a bitch with my socks on
I hit from the back, when she ain’t looking my niggas is running her whole home
I'm smoking on cookie, that shit strong
We shoot at the face and the neck bone
Niggas acting like bitches, these niggas is cowards
Been robbing these houses since 14

[Verse]
$50,000 the fit, bitch I stay clean
Got my Glock 23, got a red beam
Whole quarter mil, that's an allowance
That bitch is wet, and she a Pisces
We got guns, no we not fighting
Yeah, we got guns, they think I'm icy
