She say she gon ride for me, she say she gon die for me
She say she gon slide for me, ride around the side for me
Pistol on the side for me, Lean inside the bag for me
She say she gon ride for me, she say she gon slide for me

[Verse 1: Smokepurp]
I'm in that Lamb, I'm off that Perk, I'm with that thing
Lil shaudy, yeah, lil shaudy love me
I'm off a bean, I'm in the Lamb, fuckin up a couple things
I got that soap, yeah I got that soap
She like the way I'm drippin, and she like the way I walk
I got that sauce, I got that sauce
Shaudy wanna fuck me, cause she like the way I talk
Two phones, yeah we got a third phone
Shaudy only use my first phone
Second phone, that's my fucking trap phone
Don't hit my phone, if you ain't talkin no bone

[Hook: Smokepurp]
She say she gon ride for me, she say she gon die for me
She say she gon slide for me, ride around the side for me
Pistol on the side for me, Lean inside the bag for me
She say she gon ride for me, she say she gon slide for me

[Verse 2: NotoriousÂ Tae]
Baby, would you lie for me, baby, would you die for me
Baby, would you ride for me, baby, would you slide for me
Baby, come and get high with me
All these Xans, baby, you might have to fly with me
I ain't Tay-K, but I'm all about that action
Try to rob me, or my shorty, and it's gon be tragic
And my niggas, in the back, and they blast it
Test me, nigga, and your mom gon be in a caskit

[Hook: Smokepurp]
She say she gon ride for me, she say she gon die for me
She say she gon slide for me, ride around the side for me
Pistol on the side for me, Lean inside the bag for me
She say she gon ride for me, she say she gon slide for me
