[Hook: Pollàri]
I don't mind, tell that hoe come hit my line, hit my line
I don't mind, tell that hoe don't waste my time, waste my time
I don't mind, tell that hoe come hit my line, hit my line
I don't mind, tell that hoe don't waste my time, waste my time
I don't mind, tell that bitch come hit my line, hit my line
I don't mind, tell that hoe don't waste my time, waste my time
I don't mind, tell that bitch come hit my line, hit my line
I don't mind, tell that hoe don't waste my time, waste my time

[Verse 1:  Pollàri]
Still got the water like Fiji, blessing these hoes like a Genie
I know you mad you can't see me, I know you mad you can't see me
I make them wonder like Stevie,  lil llàri all on your TV
Wipe that hoe down like a squeegee, I'm sorry I make it look easy
30 for 30, I'm sick, these hoe still all on this dick
Whipping my wrist for the bricks, whipping my wrist for your bitch
Top down, I think I'm the shit, inside my teeth look like piss
I might just take all your shit, I might just fuck on your chick

[Hook: Pollàri]
I don't mind, tell that hoe come hit my line, hit my line
I don't mind, tell that hoe don't waste my time, waste my time
I don't mind, tell that hoe come hit my line, hit my line
I don't mind, tell that hoe don't waste my time, waste my time
I don't mind, tell that bitch come hit my line, hit my line
I don't mind, tell that hoe don't waste my time, waste my time
I don't mind, tell that bitch come hit my line, hit my line
I don't mind, tell that hoe don't waste my time, waste my time

[Verse 2: Warhol.ss]
I don't mind
I go 7:30 like dinner time
Lil llàri wet them all like Columbine
Lil bitch, she call me and she sort of fine
My niggas that ride on that block
You niggas is scared of that Glock
Don't worry, that bitch she won't stop
I count on the guap like a clock
Green on me got guap, I talk
Lil bad bitch gon suck my cock
Blue berry bricks and they friends gon' floss
Love to flex up, boy you know I don't stop
Bitch I got Fiji, Aquafina my wrist
Got that drop, don't stain my kids
Keep that flame, don't reach that bliss
Blue hundreds on me like a little bitty Crip

[Verse 3: SmokePurpp]
You know I chop, I wet the court up
Fuck the-fuck a molly bitch I be boofed up
Tell that hoe don't waste my time
No bitch can't sip on my lean
23,000 my gold they gon bling
Wet up the block and that AK gon sing
Bought me a chain then I bought me a ring
A stack for a show, I won't even be seen
Pour up a four and I pop me a bean
Keep a white bitch and she booted off green
Boy you with my gang
Boy you is a stain
Pistol finna hang

[Hook: Pollàri]
