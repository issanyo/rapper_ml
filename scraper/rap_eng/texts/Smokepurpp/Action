[Chorus]
You ain't bout this action
You don't want no action
You ain't bout this action
You don't want no action
You ain't bout this action
You don't want no action
You ain't bout this action
You don't want no action (x2)

[Verse]
Two bitches on me, wanna suck me dry
Bitch I mopped the porch like a drive-by
Money so long it might touch the sky
I can see that fake through that Fetty eye
Pull up 'rari coupe
Smokin boof in the booth
Pull up 'rari coupe
It's got no roof
I drank mud, out the mug
Mix with shade, diamond flood
I drank mud, out the mug
Mix with shade, diamond flood
Aquafina diamond look like river
I might fuck her auntie and her sister
Keep a choppa on me, I'ma slaughter
Yea bitch I'm a dog like I'm Goddard

[Chorus]
You ain't bout this action
You don't want no action
You ain't bout this action
You don't want no action
You ain't bout this action
You don't want no action
You ain't bout this action
You don't want no action
