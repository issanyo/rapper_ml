{Intro}

Ou, Lil Purpp bless yo' trap (esketit)
Huh? Ou
Huh? Aye, ou

{Verse}

30 bands on me, Ou
Fuck a lil' bitch wanna ride me like a pony
Young nigga trappin' in the foreign let you know me
In the G-wagon countin' bands I'm a loney, damn
I can't lie, Ou, hit avianne cause my bands on ice
I can't lie, Ou, hit avianne cause my bands on ice
Hit avienne spent a quarter on ice now
Tell it to my face yeah a nigga can't pipe down
3 chains on me and they all full of ice now, bite down
Geekin' off the molly can't bite down
