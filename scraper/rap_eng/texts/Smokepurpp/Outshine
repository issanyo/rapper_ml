[Hook]
Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped a whole show on my new shoes
Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped a whole show on my new shoes

[Verse]
Ridin' 'round the block with a freak bitch
Ridin' with the Glock and the tree, bitch
And my hundreds blue but I ain't a Crip
She say she like my sauce and the way I drip
I ain't got no squares in my entourage, push start Mazi in my car garage
Sippin' on the lean got me fallin', I feel like James Jones the way I'm ballin'
Sippin' on the lean got me fallin', I feel like James Jones the way I'm ballin'
I just want the neck from a freak ho
I don't trust a soul, so I keep a pole
.223 shawty with a telescope
Nigga talkin' down I'ma blow his nose, blow his nose

[Hook]
Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped the whole show on my new shoes
Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped the whole show on my new shoes
