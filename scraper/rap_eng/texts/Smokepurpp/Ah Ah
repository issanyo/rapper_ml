[Intro: Smokepurpp & Teddy]
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna know
Yeah
Yeah
And I'm off the dope, oh ah-ah-ah

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
And I'm off the dope
My car got some dope
Your bitch want some coke
Your bitch hitting, though
Oh Ah-ah-ah, Oh Ah-ah-ah
And I'm off the dope
My car got some dope
Your bitch want some coke
Your bitch hitting, though
Oh Ah-ah-ah, Oh Ah-ah-ah

[Verse: Teddy]
Pink molly fall from the sky for you
I've been sippin' lately, pour it all for two
Pornstar bitch with a couple tattoos
Pink bronco, whippin' I'm with you
Whippin' in the hills, and I caught the flu
Diamonds really on me, bitch what's on you
Take a dip out in Switzerland, naked with you
I been thinking 'bout you girl
Diamonds just another way to say I don't care
I love you, I swear
Pouring up with the good shit, we only sip rare
Keep calling on my phone when I said I don't care
When I said I don't care
Now I'm looking for a new one 'cause you weren't there
'cause you weren't there

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
And I'm off the dope
My car got some dope
Your bitch want some coke
Your bitch hitting, though
Oh Ah-ah-ah, Oh Ah-ah-ah
And I'm off the dope
My car got some dope
Your bitch want some coke
Your bitch hitting, though
Oh Ah-ah-ah, Oh Ah-ah-ah

[Outro: Smokepurpp]
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna know
And I'm off the dope
And I'm off the dope
