[Chorus]
Balling like Mike, like Jordan
So many racks, gotta put 'em in storage (cash)
Bust down AP, bust down my teeth
Every time you see me I'm glowing
Pop me a Xan, pop me a Perc
God damn, got a young nigga snoring
I was getting top from a thot five minutes after talking 'bout her boyfriend
Balling like Mike, like Jordan
So many racks, gotta put 'em in storage
Bust down AP, bust down my teeth
Every time you see me I'm glowing
Pop me a Xan, pop me a Perc
God damn, got a young nigga snoring
I was getting top from a thot five minutes after talking 'bout her boyfriend
