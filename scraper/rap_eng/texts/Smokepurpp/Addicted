[Verse 2: CHXPO]
I'm addicted to molly, I fell in love with the molly
Fucking with the gang, we gon' go catch a body
(?) that's a Bugatti
Lil CHXPO, Lil Purpp, this ship is not Lil Yachty
Count up, count up, count up, count up
Bitch we got them bands
Off the molly every day, just like we're doing xans
Fucking with Lil Purpp, you fuck 'round and get merked
Fuck around, leave you in the dirt, on a t-shirt
I'm addicted to this fast life
I can't fuck with a fuck nigga 'cause they don't act right
I can't deal with the fakes and all the haters either
Lil CHXPO come through, just like the Grim Reaper

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I'm addicted, yeah yeah
I'm addicted, yeah yeah
I'm addicted, yeah yeah
I'm addicted, yeah yeah
I'm addicted, yeah yeah
I'm addicted, yeah yeah
I'm addicted, yeah yeah
Yeah
