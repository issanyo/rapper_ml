[Verse 1]
Run it up, run it up
Lean in my double cup
Thousand on my, wrist
Thousand you uh, bitch
Fendi, pursuit, bitch
Chain look like, piss
Green dot on his head
Choppa, Uzi, Mac 11
Sippin' hella lean
Sippin' yellow lean
Bitch I'm off a beam
Call me Mr. Beam
I fucked a bitch she like "ooh"
I got Giuseppe my shoe
Ran up big digits while saying fuck school
Packs for a hoe boy that shit is not cool
I don't got no friends
I only got gang
Nigga you a stain
Opper to a stain
I only got squad
All my niggas ride
Watch me going run
I don't do no cars

[Verse 2]
Pull up with a red dot
PEWSH, PEWSH, PEWSH
BUH, BUH, BUH, headshot
Just dropped a bean in the lean
Dropped hella racks on my jeans
Nigga get shot in the spleen
Nigga ain't buy 'pensive shit
