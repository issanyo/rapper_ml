[Intro: Smokepurpp & Bob Marley]
Yung West, bitch
Woman hold her head and cry
I feel like Patty Mills
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Quick freestyle
Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

[Verse 1]
I'm a mess, but you know I stay fresh
I've been caught for everything, you're a guess
I respect all the rest, but I don't care about the rappers
'Cause I'm the best
I sound good with a bitch voice 'cause I'm blessed
I look like I'm 10 but I'm 14
Swaggin' out the room like fuckin' Mr. Clean
One young fresh nigga but my flow triple-x
I get money for the hell of it, fuck all the best
You know I'm 'bout... Yung West
Bitch, fuck Flight Squad, [?] all the rest
Killing this shit like you know I'm from the next

[Bridge: Smokepurpp & Bob Marley]
Clique stay swagged out, money in my pocket
Woman hold her head and cry
Yeahhh, oh my god
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Shut up, bitch

[Verse 2]
Uh, I said before I'm a young fresh nigga
Swaggin' out the room like I pulled the fuckin' trigga
Killa, but don't push me
Something like Lil Wayne mixed with Dwyane Wade, but only half paid
I got that shit from Chiddy Bang, who gives a dang
Yeah, I think I'm Shitty Bang, I don't even know, wait
It was Kid Cudi, from the show
Uh, I'm freestylin' like a mufucka'
I don't even know what I'm sayin'
Burn rubber, but pulled out a rubber
Fuck with all the murda, I don't even know
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
My money stay fat like Biggie's blubba
Uh, uh, uh, uh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow-ow

[Outro: Smokepurpp & Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and...
Haha, that shit was funny
