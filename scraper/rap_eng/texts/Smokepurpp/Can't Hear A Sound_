[Intro]
Smoking on the pound
I can't hear a sound
30 with the thing
Catch a hundred rounds
Diamonds on my wrist
Nigga, all these licks
Shawty want some love?
Nah, i can't wife a trick

[Chorus]
Smoking on the pound
I can't hear a sound
30 with the thing
Catch a hundred rounds
Diamonds on my wrist
Nigga, all these licks
Shawty want some love?
Nah, i can't wife a trick

[Verse 1]
(Takes a bar off)
I-I-I fucked up my wrist
Shawty just got tricked
Shit, I ain't wife that bitch
I'm stacking these racks to the ceiling
I'm fucking with florida they with me
I pour the lean til i feel it
We winning we winning we winning
Gold up in my mouth
Bitch i'm from the south
Bitches want my clout
Now they know what I'm about
Bitch i'm lil O
You talking to the po?
Told me he need dope
All that shit is sold

[Chorus]
Smoking on the pound
I can't hear a sound
30 with the thing
Catch a hundred rounds
Diamonds on my wrist
Nigga, all these licks
Shawty want some love?
Nah, i can't wife a trick
