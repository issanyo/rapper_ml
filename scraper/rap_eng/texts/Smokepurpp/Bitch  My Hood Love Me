[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Lil Purpp, Lil purpp
Turn it up a lil bit
Bitch, my hood love me
And your bitch love me too
I dont do no one on one
When I do the one and two
I trap in the trap
I got her mouth on my lap
Look at my ring no don't stunt
Hit bitch over her bed
Go to the trap, I got stick
Smoke up the quarter no zip
She wanted to suck on my dick
I told her girly make it quick
She split the lean on my shirt
Made that bitch clean up my shirt
Run up on me you get murk
I'll put your face on my shirt


[Verse 2: Ghostemane]
Pussy motherfucker never gonna come up under me
Im coming up with all the thunder rumbling and you'll wonder When i'm blowin like a milli
Gonna walk up in the liquor store and cop a Henny grip it
Go and a cap off with the Lucy
Maybe take a little trip and say I love you
But my father fuck I miss him but I gotta go
Perform another ritual to worship an other god
I got a dagger and I stick it through the bottom of a pentacle
I'm never coming back
Untill I've slay'd my soul
That trip on psilocybe, just to feel the vibe
Activate the DMT inside my corrupted mind
Given the way to the psychedelic eyes, I find no surprise
The Messiah in human disguise
Commit a murder and take my fuckin' life
