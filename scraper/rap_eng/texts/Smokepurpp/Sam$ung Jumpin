[Hook x16]
Samsung jumpin' on my hip

[Verse 1]
Samsung jumpin' on my hip
I just got a pack make it flip
Samsung jumpin' on my hip
Hope a pussy nigga don't slip
Bitch I never lack at the crib
Keep a whole thing on my hip
In case a fake nigga act up
Bitch I extended that clip
I don't see no fuck nigga
I don't see no fuck bitch
Bitch wanna lock my dick
Hell nah I can't wife no bitch
Put me on a picture on a frame
Smokepurpp yeah remember that name
One year ago I had nothing
Now a young nigga came a long way
Old bitches want me back
Now I gotta watch my back
Everybody say they my friend
Everybody tryna to make racks
Everybody thinkin' they rap
Everybody thinkin' they trap
Same nigga eat at your table
Be the same nigga stab your back

[Verse 2]
I come through I phone be jumpin' shit don't stop
Samsung battery, turn it hot
IPhone jugs and yeah whatnot, everything I say is too real, lean with a sprite of few pills
Packing loud to the face, get that shit shipped and sealed
She wanna fuck me now, cause Lil O got clout
She wanna see what I’m about, bitch gon' sleep on that couch
She wanna fuck me now, cause Lil O got clout
She wanna see what I’m about, bitch gon' sleep on that couch
