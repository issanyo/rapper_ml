16 Year Old
Hey Tony

[Hook]
Tell that hoe "I don't want you, bitch, we done"
I ain't fucking with these niggas, niggas crying
And I let that chopper hit like a drum
Niggas tryna steal the sauce, you want some
I'ma say what I want, when I want
I'ma do what I want, when I want
I'ma say what I want, when I want
I'ma do what I want, when I want

[Verse 1]
Keep a Glock .45 with the beam
Niggas lying on my name, on my team
I got act' poured up in my double cup
I'm smoking dope, got a cup full of lean
Hit this bitch on the low, like what's up?
I don't even wanna fuck, I want top
I don't wanna buy no car, I want guns
Got the guys in the cut, toting guns
Bitch I'm playing with them racks, with them stacks
Bitch I'm playing with the, keys make it back
In the hood, bitch, I used to carjack
Walking round with a motherfucking sack
Lil bitch spilled the lean on my pants
Got 10 choppers they gon' make a nigga dance
We gon' pull up to your hood, where you say you from
Got my niggas wildin' out in the trap

[Hook]
Tell that hoe "I don't want you, bitch, we done"
I ain't fucking with these niggas, niggas crying
And I let that choppa hit like a drum
Niggas tryna steal the sauce, you want some
I'ma say what I want, when I want
I'ma do what I want, when I want
I'ma say what I want, when I want
I'ma do what I want, when I want
