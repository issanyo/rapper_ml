[Intro: Smokepurpp & Kodak Black]
Lil Purpp
Murda bless yo trap
I ain't really finna' tell y'all how to get away with murda and shit

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
That is not my bitch, she for the gang (gang, gang)
So know when I fuck it's not the same
Me and Murda just jumped out the fuckin' Range, yeah (skrrt)
And this .30 not for looks, it hit your brain, yeah (doot doot)
That is not my bitch, she for the gang (for the gang)
So know when I fuck it's not the same (not the same)
Me and Murda just jumped out the fuckin' Range, yeah (skrrt)
And this .30 not for looks, it hit your brain, yeah (doot doot)

[Verse: Smokepurpp]
You ain't gang (gang)
Lil' boy keep lookin' at my chain (at my chain)
Tell that thottie give me brain (ayy, ooh)
That is not my bitch, she for the gang (Lil Purpp)
On gang (gang)
Everywhere I go I keep that thang on me
In the club I flex on niggas that are older than me (flash, flash)
Trap in a Volvo, real niggas don't lie and I don't fold
Don't want no smoke, burst 40-A in the cake room

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
That is not my bitch, she for the gang (gang, gang)
So know when I fuck it's not the same
Me and Murda just jumped out the fuckin' Range, yeah (skrrt)
And this .30 not for looks, it hit your brain, yeah (doot doot)
That is not my bitch, she for the gang (for the gang)
So know when I fuck it's not the same (not the same)
Me and Murda just jumped out the fuckin' Range, yeah (skrrt)
And this .30 not for looks, it hit your brain, yeah (doot doot)
