[Chorus]
I need some drop
I need some drop
I need some drop
I need some wock
I need some drop
Ayy, where the drop?
Ayy, where the drop?
Ayy, where the drop?
I need some wock
I need some drop
I need some wock
I need some drop
I need some, I need some...
I need some drop
I need some drop

[Verse]
I need a bird (brr, brr)
Color like Durk (huh? Ooh, huh?)
Feel like Lil Curry (huh?)
I need a bird (yuh, I need a... Ooh)
Look at my sauce, ooh (sauce, brr)
Look at the juice (look at it, ah)
I feel like a jew
I follow the jewellery on me like a jew (ah, ooh, ooh)
It's gettin' cold in the stu' (huh)
I brought my ice in the stu' (huh)
Sippin' on mud in the stu' (Lil Purpp)
Sippin' on mud with fruit loops (Lil Purpp, pew, pew)
Walk in the church with 10 bands
I got them bands in my pants
I get the bands in my hands
I'm off the lean and some Xans (Xans, ooh)

[Chorus]
I need some drop
I need some drop
I need some drop
I need some wock
I need some drop
Ayy, where the drop?
Ayy, where the drop?
Ayy, where the drop?
I need some wock
I need some drop
I need some wock
I need some drop
I need some, I need some...
I need some drop
I need some drop

[Outro]
I need a bird (brr, brr)
