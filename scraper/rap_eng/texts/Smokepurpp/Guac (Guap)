Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, guap guap, guap, guap I run it up
I got that guap guap guap, I run it up
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, guap guap, guap, I run it up
Run it up, run it up, gaup I run it up

[Verse]
Put lean in my cup
With two thotties in the cut
Bitch can't hit my blunt
Bitch better go to the store and buy her own whole dutch
Count up the guap, load up the chop
Cookin' the rocks, scrapin' the pot
Hop out the porshe, then got a porshe
Bitch I count up like I'm a dwarf
Yeah, aye bad bitch she a eater
And I got Fiji water diamonds they fresh, aquafina

[Hook]
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, guap guap, guap, guap I run it up
I got that guap guap guap, I run it up
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, count up the guap
Count up the guap, guap guap, guap, I run it up
Run it up, run it up, gaup I run it up
