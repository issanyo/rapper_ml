[Chorus]
Oh, they hatin' on me, got a bag now
Oh, they hatin' on me, got a sack now
In the club and it back now
I'm the youngest nigga with the bands now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now

[Verse]
Gucci flops
Flexin' in my Gucci flops
Then she give me top
Got her boyfriend wanna talk
Got a Cuban link hangin' off my wrist, oh
Got an Asian bitch dancin' on my dick, oh
Oh, she got a boyfriend
Oh, she got a boyfriend
Oh, yeah, the gold chains
Walk around the city like I own this shit
Momma said to do it and I did this shit
Walk around the city like I own this shit
Momma said to do it and I did this shit, oh
$10,000 on my neck, oh
$10,000 on my wrist, oh
How'd I end up here?
How'd I end up here?
Got like $30,000 on my ear, oh
I miss my brother Max
Damn, I miss my brother Max
I lost my brother Max
To a fuckin' junkie, man, oh
It gets deeper, it gets deeper than you really know about it

[Chorus]
Oh, they hatin' on me, got a bag now
Oh, they hatin' on me, got a sack now
In the club and it back now
I'm the youngest nigga with the bands now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now

[Outro]
Oh, they hatin' on me, got a bag now
Oh, they hatin' on me, got a sack now
In the club and it back now
I'm the youngest nigga with the bands now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now
Oh, got a bag now
