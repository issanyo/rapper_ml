[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Hmmm, in the VIP, I'm sippin' dope
Sip dope, sippin dope, dope, hmmmm
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Chorus: SmokePurpp]
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough
Throw a hunnit' racks, it hit the floor
In the VIP, I'm sippin' dope
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough
I count up, count up, count up, count up dope
Throw a hunnit' racks, it hit the floor
In the VIP, I'm sippin' dope
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough

[Verse 1: SmokePurpp]
She say I'm an asshole, girl, I know
I don't want the pussy, baby girl, I want the throat
Can you catch a Uber, girl, I gotta send you home
I got hella bitches comin' home
I count up, count up, count up, count up dope
I got pack off a boat
Chains on my neck make me choke, uh
And this is Gucci my coat, uh
Rick Owens all on my toes, uh
And I stay clean like some soap, uh
You don't know me, we not bros
You don't know me, we not bros
We don't even share the same hoes
Niggas wanna copy my flow
Copy my style, stealin' my clothes (Yeah)
Look at my watch, that's 150
When in New York, feel like 50
I think yo' bitch wanna kiss me (Huh?)
I let her top me, no kissing

[Chorus: SmokePurpp]
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough
Throw a hunnit' racks, it hit the floor
In the VIP I'm sippin' dope (Sippin' dope)
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough
I count up, count up, count up, count up dope
Throw a hunnit' racks, it hit the floor
In the VIP, I'm sippin' dope
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough

[Verse 2: DRAM]
I got Lucy in the sky with the diamonds feelin' on her
Booty, while I finish assignment, thumbin' through this loose leaf, by myself on my own island 'till it is time to
Leave, then I'm back up in here wildin', baby wipe off your
Nose, what you do with that white girl, the Lord, the only one
Knows, 'cause you claim you don't know her, man, that's how you get
Exposed, actin' like you too concerned, baby, just lose
Control, but not enough control to make the car crash
To the fence, where I'm finna take it
Once I hit it, I touch all the bases
Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey, Mark McGwire with it
Yeah, that boy is frigid
But niggas' hotter than the summer, what you wanna know, yeah yeah

[Chorus: SmokePurpp]
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough
Throw a hunnit' racks, it hit the floor
In the VIP, I'm sippin' dope
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough
I count up, count up, count up, count up dope
Throw a hunnit' racks, it hit the floor
In the VIP, I'm sippin' dope
I count up, count up, count up, count up dough
