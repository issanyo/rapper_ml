[Intro: Kodak Black]
I ain’t really finna tell y’all how to get away with murda and shit

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
She said “are you coming?”, I said “soon”
We could take a trip to the moon
Fucked up, off the drugs in my room
We could have a party, me and you
Baby, are you down, are you down?
Baby, are you down, are you down?
Baby, are you down?
Baby, are you down, are you down?
Baby, are you down, are you down?
Baby, are you down?
