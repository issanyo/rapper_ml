[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Yeah, yeah, Lil Purpp, huh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Yeah I push up (push up), roll the window down (roll the, yeah)
Put 'em in the circus, they some fuckin' clowns
He's your mans then he gets touched 'cause you fuckin' clown
Got an AR with the titties, that's a hundred rounds (Lil Purpp)
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds
Yeah I push up (push up), roll the window down (Lil Purpp)
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds

[Verse 1: SG Tip]
Yeah I'm smokin' purple, in the backseat
Shoot a hundred rounds, turn you to a track meet
Your baby daddy is a vegan, he don't want no beef
Pull down on your block, it's a street sweep
Late night drive-by, you don't get no sleep
New face on the block, nigga who is he?
The Glock got a thunderbolt like OKC
I ain't never acting gangster, nigga this just me
Pay me what you owe, I can't show no slack
I lose a ho every week, feelings all I lack
Three percs at a time just like tic-tacs
Your baby mama beggin' bitch, she need to get back

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Yeah I push up (push up), roll the window down (roll the, yeah)
Put 'em in the circus, they some fuckin' clowns
He's your mans then he gets touched 'cause you fuckin' clown
Got an AR with the titties, that's a hundred rounds (Lil Purpp)
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds
Yeah I push up (push up), roll the window down (Lil Purpp)
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
Ayy, money so long, so long, I just bought a brand new stick for a rainy day
And I promise it gon' hit, we got good aim
I'm a real road runner, catch a hundred plays
Ever since I took that ride, nothing was the same
Ayy, new Rick Owens, cost a couple racks
I just bought a dirty nina, cost a hundred flat
I was runnin' off the pack, sleepin' in the trap
Nigga try to take it back, he gon' get clapped

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Yeah I push up (push up), roll the window down (roll the, yeah)
Put 'em in the circus, they some fuckin' clowns
He's your mans then he gets touched 'cause you fuckin' clown
Got an AR with the titties, that's a hundred rounds (Lil Purpp)
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds
Yeah I push up (push up), roll the window down (Lil Purpp)
Got an AR with some titties, that's a hundred rounds
