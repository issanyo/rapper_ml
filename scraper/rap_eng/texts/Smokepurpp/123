[Intro]
Yuh, wait
Lil Purpp
Huh
Lil Purpp bless yo trap
I ain't really finna' tell y'all how to get away with murda and shit
Yeah

[Chorus]
Okay, 1-2-3, yeah, I just popped a bean
Okay, 4-5-6, yeah, eight hoes on my dick
Niggas salty and they hatin' 'cause Lil Purpp is young and rich
And my girl got a girl but her tongue got my kids
I just jumped up in that Jag, we smoke woods, not no cigs
Lil Purpp in high demand, yeah, these verses worth a brick
And she know that I got hoes, but she still gon' suck my dick
All these diamonds on my neck, got the flu, bitch I'm sick

[Verse 1]
This is a fur from Koala
My niggas scammers and robbers
Everything hit like the Dodgers
Drop all my chains in the water
Spent hunnid racks, I'm a baller
I get the bread like I'm Wawa's
He tryna' run but we got him
Dropped his head down to the bottom
Huh, wait
I want all the smoke
I smoke all the dope
Uzi with a scope
Huh, wait
I count all these racks
I been movin' crack
Lil bih' throw it back

[Chorus]
Okay, 1-2-3, yeah, I just popped a bean
Okay, 4-5-6, yeah, eight hoes on my dick
Niggas salty and they hatin' 'cause Lil Purpp is young and rich
And my girl got a girl but her tongue got my kids
I just jumped up in that Jag, we smoke woods, not no cigs
Lil Purpp in high demand, yeah, these verses worth a brick
And she know that I got hoes, but she still gon' suck my dick
All these diamonds on my neck, got the flu, bitch I'm sick

[Verse 2]
Smoking on cookie, that stank
Lil Purpp got blues in the bank
Lil Purpp on top of the ranks
I'm in the cut like a shank
Big AP, it's bust down
Fuck that lil' ho, she get bust down
Lil Purpp don't ride in no trucks now
I spent the racks, give no fucks now
Switch lanes, switch lanes
I flip the bitch like a switch blade
Water on me like it just rained
I take that bitch out to Ukraine
Woah, woah, woah, woah
She wanna sniff on this blow (woah)
My bank account full of O's
Jump out that motherfuckin' Ghost

[Chorus]
Okay, 1-2-3, yeah, I just popped a bean
Okay, 4-5-6, yeah, eight hoes on my dick
Niggas salty and they hatin' 'cause Lil Purpp is young and rich
And my girl got a girl but her tongue got my kids
I just jumped up in that Jag, we smoke woods, not no cigs
Lil Purpp in high demand, yeah, these verses worth a brick
And she know that I got hoes, but she still gon' suck my dick
All these diamonds on my neck, got the flu, bitch I'm sick
