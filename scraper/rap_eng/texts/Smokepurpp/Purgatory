[Verse]
I've been feeling dead inside
I've got two cups with the Sprite
Cash just makes me feel alive
I've got two cups with the Sprite
Feel like I'm the best
Ouu, I'm not impressed
Bitch, I know I'm next
That's why fuck the rest
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap, uh
I do what I want, Lil Purpp bless yo' crack
She just want me deep inside, yeah
I might fuck by in the night, yeah
Rockstar life, so I might die, yeah
I live life, I don't think twice, yeah

She want my, yeah
She don't know me deep inside, yeah
She want my, yeah
She don't know me deep inside, yeah
She want my, yeah
She don't know me deep inside, yeah
She want my, yeah
She don't know me deep inside, yeah
