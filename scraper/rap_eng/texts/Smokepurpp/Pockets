Aye, gang

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
I wanna fuck but she boring (huh)
Fuck a friend, money important

Lil Purpp on top I don't show it
She wanna fuck 'cause my pockets a lil' bigger
She wanna fuck 'cause my pockets a lil' bigger
She wanna fuck 'cause my pockets a lil' bigger
She wanna fuck 'cause my pockets a lil' bigger
Jump in the Rari, I'm dashin' (skrrt)
Fuck on that bitch then I pass her (ooh)
You can't see me through them glasses (what)
All of my diamonds be flashin' (flash)
Diamonds, they all on my body lil' nigga
VVS diamonds, they shinin' like glitter
All the designer, I drip like the river (drip)
She wanna fuck 'cause my pockets a lil' bigger

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
I'm at the apartments
Niggas come through, it's a one stop shop
Louis my garments
Run up the racks when I fuck at the apartment
Your baby wanna fuck (look up)
I don't wanna fuck I tell her suck my watch
You get no warning
We on the block and we made that shit hot (Lil Purpp)
Ooh, choppa got a lot of kick back
Just met the bitch, had to kick back
Send me a text, don't get shit back (ooh)
Fuck the bitch, I don't do chit-chat
We ride around with the big mags
Nigga get popped like a tic tac (Lil Purpp)
Smokin' on bubble, that piss pack (ooh)
Run up the racks, yeah I did that (Lil Purpp)
Run up on me, push yo shit back

Ooh, pour up a six and two
Walk out of Saks, spend a hundred on shoes
Fuck that lil' bitch and she wet like a pool (Lil Purpp)

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Whoa, Lil Purpp be ridin' with poles (poles)

He said he ridin' but he went and told (Lil Purpp)
Ooh, bad bitch and she red like the bean (bean)
Bitch we got money like Mayweather team (team)
Young nigga juggin' since I was thirteen (teen)
Jump in that Rari, I'm hittin' two hundred (skrrt)
Fuck on that bitch and I fuck on her cousin (skrrt)
9 in the morning and my cellphone buzzin'
Stayed in the trap and we breakin' out onions
Maison Margiela and mixed with Givenchy
Count up the racks, young nigga got plenty
How many bitches I need me about twenty
Sippin' on lean, I don't fuck with the Henny

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
