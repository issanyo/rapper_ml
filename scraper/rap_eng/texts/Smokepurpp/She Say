[Hook]
She said she gone ride for me
She said she gone die for me
She said she gone slide for me
Right around the side for me
Pistol on the side for me
Lean inside the bag for me
She said she gone ride for me
She said she gone slide for me

[Verse]
I'm in LA, I'm off a perc, can't feel a thing
Lil shawty, lil shawty, runs with me
I'm off a bean
I'm in LA fucking up a couple thing
I got the sauce, I got the sauce
Shawty love my jewelry and she love the way I walk
I got the sauce, I got the sauce
Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause she love the way I talk
Two phones for me, hit my first phone
Shawty you gone lose my first phone
Second phone, that's my fucking trap phone
Don't hit my phone, you ain't talking 'bout no boat
