[Intro]
Look, I can't fuck with boogers; nigga's weirdo's
Blowing hella 0's, fucking hella hoes
Booling  with my toolie, cooling with my foolie
My clip hold a 30, we could  shoot a movie
Shout out flex, that my blood, shout out twin that my cuz

[Verse 1]
Boy come get this pressure
Boy come get this pressure
Boy come get this pressure
Boy come get this pressure
Boy come get this pressure
Boy come get this pressure
Y'all still trappin' all the time, why you calling me
Why you stalkin' me, nigga's watching me
And my chain lit the room like Christmas Tree
I don't got family b, I got money tree
Shout out WARHOLL, feel like Master P
Feel like I'm  Ali, Feel like Rocky
Put a .7 to the head, feel like Bobby
Niggas sleep on me, niggas catchin' Z's
I might count up, might count up
I might count up, might count up
I might count up, might count up
I might count up, might count up
Told her to suck dick up on the counter
I might count up, might count up

[Hook]
Got it out the mud by myself, praying to God and my 30; need no help
Got it out the mud by myself, praying to God and my 30; need no help
Boy come get this pressure
Boy come get this pressure
Boy come get this pressure
Got it out the mud by myself, praying to God and hold a 30; need no help

[Verse 2]
Count that guap
Young nigga count that guap
Count it up, it don't stop
Glock 45, I'm on the block
Nigga's don't want smoke, niggas don't want beef
Not with me, not with me
Niggas know I'm in these streets
Smokepurpp really got the bean
