Ay, Ay, Ay, Yo
Uzeh Gang
[Chorus]
Sippin on Act
Sippin on Act
Fuck on your bitch
I give her back
Run like it’s track
Run in all black
Came with the mask
Ay, ay, ay
Lean with the ice
Wrist it all ice
Fuck your bitch twice
Fuck your bitch thrice
Fuck on your wife
Don’t care what the price
She ain’t my type
Gang shit that’s right
[Verse 1]
My house it just smell like some trees
My house it just smell like Febreze
My house it just smell like the weed
So much weed needa sneeze, gucci on my sleeves
Think you needa switch teams
Gucci all on my knees
So much think I’m gon freeze
Think I’m gonna preach fuck it imma give a speech
Imma change your belief
Imma fuck up your dreams
Imma knock out your teeth
Sell some cheese fuck it get a bitch from Greece
Xans all in your niece
Imma fuck on your niece
I’m the G.O.A.T, Major League
Got the key to the streets, imma keep the peace
The beat go off?
[Chorus]
Sippin on Act
Sippin on Act
Fuck on your bitch
I give her back
Run like it’s track
Run in all black
Came with the mask
Ay, ay, ay
Lean with the ice
Wrist it all ice
Fuck your bitch twice
Fuck your bitch thrice
Fuck on your wife
Don’t care what the price
She ain’t my type
Gang shit that’s right
[Verse 2]
Whip up some bricks in the kitchen
They say I’m trash I don’t listen
Makin’ racks that’s my religion
Making racks that’s a tradition
Flow ancient like an Egyptian

She came she get straight to bitchin’
Kick her out, I’m on my mission

Got me to where I can’t stand
Got 10 bitches they from Japan

They tell me I just go do it
Music so fire it’s humid
Thot on my lap she the cutest
Takin’ 5 xans cuz screw it, bitch
Yeah bitch that’s an o.d
Yeah lil bitch you owe me
That lil thottie she blow me
Shut the fuck up I'm an OG
Pull up young minor threat
I just swerve off in a vette
Feel like ski you will regret everything you say I’ll cut off your neck, bitch
Blood all on my hands, all in her pussy
Got a hunnid bands, trust me we all Gucci
Really Young Money, cuz I feel like Tunechi
Makin’ all the money, people askin’ how I do it?
Yo, hahaha
