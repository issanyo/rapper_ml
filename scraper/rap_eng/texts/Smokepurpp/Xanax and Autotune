[Hook]
Young nigga get money
I don't think that's funny
Who you with, what you claim
All my niggas let it bang
And she like my pinky ring
Codeine fiend, yeah that's me
Smoking kush, off these trees
I'm a rat, I need that cheese

{Verse 1]
(Brrrr)
Hunnids on hunnids on hunnids
I need some bands to the bank, bitch I'm runnin'
I can't go broke cause I ? my ?
Smokin' the port with my girls, yeah I'm stuntin'
I am not Future but I got 3 bands
Open these pills, then I'm popping these xans
Free all my young niggas out of the can
Y'all pussy, niggas on filler
Pussy niggas, I can't go near
Playin' niggas, I can't see em
Makin' no noise, I can't hear em
Thousands on thousands on thousands
Swervin' on the counter, I got your bitch countin'
She gave me face so I know that she 'bout it
I got the mac and you know ima spout it
Born in ? bitch you know what I'm smokin'
Niggas talkin' ? with the Uzi I'm ?
Then I pop a molly and you know that I'm ?
She give me throat 'til I got the bitch ?

[Verse 2]
Y'all know me, pull up with a beam
Codeine fiend, sippin' that lean
Truies in my jeans, or robbin jeans
Go in both ways, y'all know me
I be doin, doin this shits
I might just go and go hit a lick
I might go home and invade in your crib
Know how I'm rocking, you know how I ?
I give a fuck about what niggas talk
I give a fuck, what is you sayin'
What is you sayin', what is you sayin'
He talkin' reckless, I'm coming through ?
It's Lil O, it's Lil O
I be fucking and ducking and smashing these hoes

Get me some bands, I'ma get me around
Pull up on niggas I ? on my ?
Pull up on niggas ? my ?

Call me Montana got bricks for the low
Better have cash before I do some ?
