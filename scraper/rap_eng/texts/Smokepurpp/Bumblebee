[Intro]
Six, yeah
I just poured a six in a Mello Yello, yeah
I just poured a six in a Mello Yello, yeah
Murda on that beat so it's not nice

[Chorus]
I just poured a six in a Mello Yello yah (yeah, yeah)
I can't do no swishers, I can't do no 'rillo (yeah, yeah)
Two-door Lamborghinis and them doors is yellow (skrrt)
Hit it from the back because the booty jello (yeah, yeah)
Bumblebee, bumblebee, bumblebee (uh)
Diamonds peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo like hide and seek (flex)
Bumblebee, bumblebee, bumblebee (yeah, yeah)
Diamonds peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo like hide and seek (yeah)

[Verse]
Diamonds peek-a-boo like hide and seek
Hit it, then I pass it to the team (yeah, yeah)
G's up, hoes down, I swear to G (swear to G)
Can't fuck with these hoes because these hoes are for the scene
Two cups, gone
Two hoes, on (hoes, woo)
Two guns, chrome (woo)
Two Glocks, gone
I just bought a foreign filled with dope
Lil' baby come here, let's wipe your nose (sniff)
Lil' baby come here and bring your hoes (bring your hoes)
I guess so, they know I got coke
Speedballin', X, perco-cets
She want sex, I want cheques

[Chorus]
I just poured a six in a Mello Yello yah (yeah, yeah)
I can't do no swishers, I can't do no 'rillo (yeah, yeah)
Two-door Lamborghinis and them doors is yellow (skrrt)
Hit it from the back because the booty jump (yeah, yeah)
Bumblebee, bumblebee, bumblebee (uh)
Diamonds peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo like hide and seek (flex)
Bumblebee, bumblebee, bumblebee (yeah, yeah)
Diamonds peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo like hide and seek (yeah)
