[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Lil Purpp bless yo trap
Ouu, ouu

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
MVP, MVP (huh?)
Like a nigga won six rings (what?)
We might stomp a pussy out (huh, yuh)
If he talkin' like he's sweet (huh?)
Put a three-five in my Backwood (yuh)
And I like to smoke the tree (tree)
MVP, MVP
Like a nigga won some rings (huh, yuh)
MVP, MVP, MVP, uh
We might stomp a pussy out if he's sweet (huh?)
MVP, MVP, MVP (Lil Purpp)
We might stomp a pussy out if he's sweet (huh?)

[Verse: Smokepurpp]
Ice around my neck (Lil Purpp)
Bitch that's on my set (Lil Purpp)
All these niggas pussy, smell it on they breath (bitch)
Take off in a jet (huh?)
Chains around my neck (Lil Purpp, skrt)
30 thousand, spend it on a pet (Lil Purpp)
Fucking on a model bitch (huh?)
I don't need no bottle bitch (woo!)
Ice dropped on my fucking wrist (woo!)
Like, "Purpp, how you get that shit?" (huh?)
Smoking on green, that's a cabbage
Look at my pocket, that's cabbage
Your pockets go on a diet (what?)
Bitch, I'm Lil Purpp, I'm a savage

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
MVP, MVP (huh?)
Like a nigga won six rings (what?)

Put a three-five in my Backwood (yuh)
And I like to smoke the tree (tree)
MVP, MVP
Like a nigga won some rings (huh, yuh)
MVP, MVP, MVP, uh
We might stomp a pussy out if he's sweet (huh?)
MVP, MVP, MVP (Lil Purpp)
We might stomp a pussy out if he's sweet (huh?)
