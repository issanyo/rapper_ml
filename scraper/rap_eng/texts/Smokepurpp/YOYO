[Intro]
Monster's gon' tear it up
Yeah, uh
Flare, ayy, ayy, uh

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE & Smokepurpp]
Hopped out my new coupe (hopped out), roof salute (salute)
Big bankroll (bankroll, bih), my bitch look like Marilyn Monroe (Monroe)
Green stacks, short like Yoda (big racks)
This a 'Rari, boy, not a Toyota (no, no, skrrt)
Lil' bitch, I don't pull a pose (hell no)
Your girl bring it back like yo-yo (bring it back)

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
(Huh)
Your girl bring it back like yo-yo (ouu)
Got Molly, got Xan, got dope (Lil' Purpp, yeah)
Lil' bitch, yeah I want all the smoke (huh, all the smoke)
And I came in the spot with a pole (geek, tu-tu-tu, huh)
Got Maison Margiela, like "ouu"
Big wax, and I got gas too
Flex bitch, yeah, that's all I do
Rolex, big bust down too
Ouu, yeah, hold up, wait
I don't take the bitch on no dates
Lil' Purpp, I just came in first place
I just bought a car out of state

[Verse 2: Reese LAFLARE]
Lil' Skate, my ice wet like a lake
Pockets fat like I just ate
Porsche pedals under my Bapes
Glock .19, no safety
Used to trap right by grady
No stylist, I'm in the latest
And I'm your main bitch most favorite
Lil' Skate runnin' for president
Hang it up, bitch, you irrelevant
Fuck up the money, no celibate
Every bitch on the team get a letterless
Froze, 30 below, I'm on Everest

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
Hopped out my new coupe (hopped out), roof salute (salute)
Big bankroll (bankroll), my bitch look like Marilyn Monroe (Monroe)
Green stacks, short like Yoda (big racks)
This a 'Rari, boy, not a Toyota (no, no, skrrt)
Lil' bitch, I don't pull a pose (hell no)
Your girl bring it back like yo-yo (bring it back)
Hopped out my new coupe (hopped out), roof salute (salute)
Big bankroll (bankroll), my bitch look like Marilyn Monroe (Monroe)
Green stacks, short like Yoda (big racks)
This a 'Rari, boy, not a Toyota (no, no, skrrt)
Lil' bitch, I don't pull a pose (hell no)
Your girl bring it back like yo-yo (bring it back)

[Outro]
Like yo-yo, like yo-yo
Like yo-yo, like yo-yo
