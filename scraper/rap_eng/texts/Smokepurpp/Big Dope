[Intro]
Murda on tha beat so it's not nice

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
I remember niggas hated on me back when I was broke
Now they lookin' up to me so high they need a telescope
Fuck that bitch one time and kick her out 'cause she a petty ho
I might fuck his bitch, she lick it up just like a envelope (just like a envelope)
And I'm smokin' gas 'cause it keep me grounded to the floor (to the floor)
Niggas used to laugh but now they see me and they always joke (always joke)
I'ma do this for my niggas and my family on my soul (on my soul)
I can't trust nobody, when I sleep you know I keep a pole (I can't trust nobody)
And shawty wanna fuck 'cause I got bands and she know I got O's (I got O's)
Told my momma, yeah don't worry, yeah I got this, take it slow
Smokin' on gelato, see these niggas smoke oregano (oregano)
Need a penthouse by the clouds so high that I can't see the floor (huh)
And I'm on go mode
Everything I do is for my gang though (Lil Purpp)
Niggas switchin' on me but I know that it's the gang though (gang though)
So I watch 'em closely, keep 'em on my fuckin' ratio

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Aye, I smoke big dope
Shawty wanna fuck 'cause I got good blow
Aye, I smoke big dope (Lil Purpp)
Shawty wanna fuck 'cause I got good blow (yuh)
Aye, I smoke big dope
I smoke big dope
I smoke big dope (yuh)
Aye, I smoke big dope (big dope)
I smoke big dope (big dope)
I smoke big dope

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
I just pulled up on a nigga
Choppa poppin' like a Harlem Shake
Big drum, it's gonna eat a nigga like a double steak
I just called my main ho and I told that bitch I need a break (need a break)
My niggas hittin' licks, they really out here tryna' make some shake
Ooh, aye, lil' bitch makin' moves (huh)
I was bustin' pieces in LA, just tryna make a move (make a move)
Huh, aye and my Gucci shoes
Foreign bitch she with me and she only rock the Christian Loubs

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Aye, I smoke big dope
Shawty wanna fuck 'cause I got good blow
Aye, I smoke big dope (Lil Purpp)
Shawty wanna fuck 'cause I got good blow (yuh)
Aye, I smoke big dope
I smoke big dope
I smoke big dope (yuh)
Aye, I smoke big dope (big dope)
I smoke big dope (big dope)
I smoke big dope
