[Chorus: SmokePurpp]
Tats on my body 'cause I can't turn down
Bitch I'm the best, I'm the youngest around
Smoke to the face, I don't pass it around
Raf's on my feet 'cause the money keep wild
I'm in a Porsche and I'm geeked up now
White gold teeth, I can't turn down
She suckin' dick, then I can't turn her down
Tats on my neck 'cause I can't turn down

[Verse 1: SmokePurpp]
When I'm in Florida they treat me like king
Packs of the percs and the pints of the lean
Rips on my shirt, I got rips on my jeans
Bitch I'm on go cuz my light is on green
Pistol tucked, in a truck
Bitch I'm stuck, off the mud
Ridin' in a coupe
Bitch I'm in a mood
Don't you dare to make a move
Bitch I got that Ruger, I might shoot

[Chorus: SmokePurpp]
Tats on my body 'cause I can't turn down
Bitch I'm the best, I'm the youngest around
Smoke to the face, I don't pass it around
Raf's on my feet 'cause the money keep wild
I'm in a Porsche and I'm geeked up now
White gold teeth, I can't turn down
She suckin' dick, then I can't turn her down
Tats on my neck 'cause I can't turn down

[Verse 2: Richysamo]
Tats on my neck 'cause I can't turn down
Fuck on that bitch then I turn her around
Say I'm up next but I'm up right now
Nigga keep talkin', I'll empty the round
Don't need a vest 'cause I aim for the head
Fuck on that bitch 'til her pussy turn red
Ain't even sick, but I'm off of the meds
Talkin' too much, I'ma think you a fed
Ay, bitch my wrist iced like a cooler (like a cooler)
I'm fuckin' on this bitch, she a cougar (she a cougar)
Fuck your ex-boyfriend, he a loser (he a loser)
Bitch I came up out the 'jects, now I'm boomin' (now I'm boomin')

[Chorus: SmokePurpp]
Tats on my body 'cause I can't turn down
Bitch I'm the best, I'm the youngest around
Smoke to the face, I don't pass it around
Raf's on my feet 'cause the money keep wild
I'm in a Porsche and I'm geeked up now
White gold teeth, I can't turn down
She suckin' dick, then I can't turn her down
Tats on my neck 'cause I can't turn down
