[Chorus]
Bullet to your block and I spray with the Mac
You know I flip bricks, y'all call me young Shaq
Now I'm counting then stacks
Now I better get me them racks
And your bitch drop top, while I hit it from the back

[Verse]
My life is so ?, I knock it like Randy, I'm smoking on candy
I'm feeling like Randy, I'm off of this ?, And I'm popping these xannies
Your bitch gave me face, I'm driving a case, I'm also the next one
I ? all you ?, you niggas is clowns, you know how I ? (Boom, boom, boom!)
I'm clapping a ruger, and nigga I'll shoot you, I don't ride no uber
She want me to do her, I'm counting this ?, you know I manuver
I clap it like Brrrrrah!, young nigga slap, all of you niggas is wack
I am not wack, my haters are ?, and I'm holding the back
Now I'm off to the game, young nigga blowing like ?
I'm smoking on ?, I speed it, move faster, and now I am racking the table
I stopped doing ?, she fuck with the ?, and ?
?

[Chorus]
Bullet to your block and I spray with the Mac
You know I flip bricks, y'all call me young Shaq
Now I'm counting then stacks
Now I better get me them racks
And your bitch drop top, while I hit it from the back
