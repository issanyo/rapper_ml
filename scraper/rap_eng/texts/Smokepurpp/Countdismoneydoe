Bouncing on my dick like she a bunny hoe (like she a bunny)
Brand new nina on me with a telescope
Staring at my pockets, you a funny hoe
All I want to do is count this money doe (count it)
Bouncing on my dick like she a bunny hoe (like she a bunny)
Brand new nina on me with a telescope
Staring at my pockets, you a funny hoe (funny hoe)
