[Chorus]
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Face down, ass up, that bitch ugly
I just want that head, I don't get cuddly
Ahhhh, ahhhh
I'm the topic, I'm the topic now, yeah
I'm the topic, I'm the topic now, yeah
Ahhhh, ahhhh

[Verse]
I want top, told her "Give me top please"
Told her "Give me toppy"
"Give me sloppy toppy"
In that Lambo, in that Rari
Told that bitch "Sorry, bitch, I don't say sorry"
Ahhhh, ahhhh
And I'm with my gang
We don't play no games
No, when I'm with my gang
Yeah, we hittin' stains
No and I'm with my gang
Yeah, we ain't playin
No, when I'm with my gang
We don't play no games
Two times two, I just poured a four
I ride with a bitch, I call y'all two door

[Chorus]
Face down, ass up, that bitch ugly
I just want that head, I don't get cuddly
Ahhhh, ahhhh
I'm the topic, I'm the topic now, yeah
I'm the topic, I'm the topic now, yeah
Ahhhh, ahhhh
