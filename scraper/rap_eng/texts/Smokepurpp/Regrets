[Intro]
Purpp Digital, Digital Purpp
All these chains on me
All these chains on me, nigga
Got purp water on this side

[Hook]
I did some things I regret
Young nigga came from the trenches
That's why I sip on this mud
I did some things I regret
Riding around with that tec
I did some things I regret
Murder, murder, murder
I did some things I regret
I pick up the check and I stretch
Young nigga fuck on his ex
I did some things I regret
Still ride around with that tec

[Verse]
7k on chase
All my niggas baked
Kick in that door like Liu Kang
I told you, Lil Purpp got crack
I hit that bitch from the back
I hit the bitch with a sack
Sonny rollin' grams of wax
You ain't top this lil nigga
Do this for fun lil nigga
You betta run to your nigga
I keep a gun lil nigga

[Hook]
I did some things I regret
Young nigga came from trenches
That's why I sip on this mud
I did some things I regret
Riding around with that tec
I did some things I regret
Murder, murder, murder
I did some things I regret
I did some things I regret
Young nigga came from the trenches
That's why I sip on this mud
I did some things I regret
Riding around with that tec
I did some things I regret
Murder, murder, murder
I did some things I regret
