[Chorus]
Told her get that money, yeah
She love my red bottoms on my thousand dollar furniture
I be pouring fours and fours until the sun come up
I be sipping 'til the sun come up, 'til the sun come up
Ok
Told her get that money, yeah
She love my red bottoms on her thousand dollar furniture
I be pouring fours and fours until the sun come up
I be sipping 'til the sun come up, 'til the sun come up
Ok

[Verse]
Stop, yeah
I ain't got no heart, yeah
Addict, I'm at heart
I can't park my car
I think they forgot (got)
I think they forgot, yeah
I've been getting guap, yeah
Ice all on my watch, yeah
Yeah
I-I-I think that they noticed
I've been feeling lost, yeah (lost)
Drugs got me lost, yeah (yeah)
I feel like I'm floating
Floating through dimensions
I can't break the tension (tension)
I don't need attention (tension)

[Chorus]
Told her get that money, yeah
She love my red bottoms on my thousand dollar furniture
I be pouring fours and fours until the sun come up
I be sipping 'til the sun come up, 'til the sun come up
Ok
Told her get that money, yeah
She love my red bottoms on her thousand dollar furniture
I be pouring fours and fours until the sun come up
I be sipping 'til the sun come up, 'til the sun come up
Ok
