[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Ricky Racks
R.I.P, I say RIP
R.I.P
R.I.P, I say R.I.P
R.I.P, I say R.I.P

[Hook: Sash]
In my pockets there's some bills (say)
I say R.I.P, I say R.I.P
In my pockets there's some bands (say)
I say R.I.P, I say R.I.P

[Verse 1: Sash]
In my pockets I got bands
Rick Owens my jeans, they all at my feet (said)
White girl really got them bands
Her jewelry just came from France
Put Cartier on my lens
You probably wouldn't understand, but
Talkin' bout jet, no not the plane
I'm talking about crazy VVS, we not the same (they talkin' bout)
They talk about jap, they talk about slash (say say)
Talking money, I been talkin' bout that
Talkin' bout money, 'cause money talks
All this green like Boston
Aw shit, taking away the water faucet

[Hook: Sash & Smokepurpp]
In my pockets there's some bills (say)
I say R.I.P, I say R.I.P
In my pockets there's some bands (ooh, ooh, Lil Purpp)
I say R.I.P, I say R.I.P., yeah

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
In my pocket I got pills (I got pills)
And I'm off a molly
And I'm off a bean
Grab the lean I grab your sill
I just wanna burn the whip
In the club I'm throwing bills
Niggas mad, they in they feels (mad they in they feels)
I keep shooters 'round me, nigga
They gon' shoot something quick
Heard your bitch was out here eating, tell the truth lil' bih
And Lil Pump come bless the trap, I just got rich lil' bitch
And that thotty gave me plug but then I took his shit
Niggas switching for a deal
Huh, I just left the bank, I just left the bank

[Hook: Sash ]
In my pockets there's some bills (say)
I say R.I.P, I say R.I.P
In my pockets there's some bands (say)
I say R.I.P, I say R.I.P
