Name every Soundcloud rappin’ ass, that sound like Kloud God
Nigga can’t name one
When they say I sound like X and Ski
Just to diss me, funny thing
Those niggas famous

I’ll take the compliment
Take up the Activis bottle
This Sprite with the rock, it’s so common now
Funny thing y’all sippin’ Nyquil so calm it down, Damn
Joey gassin’ like fire, it’s common
The comments on this gon’ be “Joey is blowin’ now”
I’ll fuck your girl, and she blowin’ now (ay)
So and so fucking with so and so
Both them hoes gave me that throat and know

Say that’s all I got, the rapper’s getting out of line now
Sayin’ I sound like other rappers
Y’all gettin’ out of line now, I sound like me

Ain't the nigga in the park sayin' he ballin' like D Rose?
And she steady poppin’ Xans, feeling like a hero
We know it’s weird though
Don’t be a hero
Boosted my wrist and they call me Sub Zero, Nah
