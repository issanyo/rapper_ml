[Hook]
I look at my watch and it snow
I look at my ring and it snow
I look at my chain and it snow
I look at my watch and it snow
Snow, snow
I look at my chain and it snow
I look at my ring and it snow
I look at my watch and it snow

[Verse]
I look at my wrist and it snow
I pick up a check then I go
I need me a band for a show
Then I skurt off in the lamb
Blue hunnid, my hand
I might have to chill on the xans
Incase a nigga act up
Keep a 30. and it's tucked
Uzi pointin' out the truck
Then I split you like a dutch
Nigga we don't give no fucks
Missin' money, you get touched
Niggas they hatin', they talk on the internet
I don't do internet rather get into it
Rather just go on and count up my dividends
Diamonds they wet like they came from the fishin' net
Snow, water, watch me glo
Snow, water, whip the stove
Snow, snow, snow in the crack pot
Snow, for the crack rock
Snow at the trap spot

[Hook]
I look at my watch and it snow
I look at my ring and it snow
I look at my chain and it snow
I look at my watch and it snow
Snow, snow
I look at my chain and it snow
I look at my ring and it snow
I look at my watch and it snow
I look at watch and it snow
I look at my ring and it snow
I look at my chain and it snow
I look at my watch and it snow
Snow, snow
I look at my chain and it snow
I look at my ring and it snow
I look at my watch and it snow
