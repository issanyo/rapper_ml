[Chorus: Lil 8nod]
I don't want no job, all I sell is drugs
She just wanna fuck, all I want is drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
I don’t want no job, all I sell is drugs
She just wanna fuck, all I want is drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs

[Verse 1: Lil 8nod]
Pour another pint, I think I just might
Got me feeling nice, mix it in the ice
Rolling off a bean, got me feeling like a dice
Fuck your bitch (?), fuck her 'til she cries
I ain't even text her back, now that bitch she sad
Lil 8nod, Osama
Bitch I said it twice (two times)

[Chorus: Lil 8nod]
I don’t want no job, all I sell is drugs
She just wanna fuck, all I want is drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
I don't want no job, all I sell is drugs
She just wanna fuck, all I want is drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
I just popped another perc, then I slipped in a flood
I sleep with my Draco, I sleep with that AR
Walk in with my cup, bitch I got a (?)
Fuck rehab, hopped out that bitch and relapsed
Hopped in a Lamb and hit gas, popping XOs no tic tacs
Toe
That's Margiela on my toes
This platinum, this not gold
Two times two my cup, that's four

[Chorus: Lil 8nod]
I don't want no job, all I sell is drugs
She just wanna fuck, all I want is drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
I don't want no job, all I sell is drugs
She just wanna fuck, all I want is drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
Give a fuck about no love, just show me to the drugs
