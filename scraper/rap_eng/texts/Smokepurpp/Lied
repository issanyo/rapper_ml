[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Reddrum on the beat
Lil Purpp, yeah, yeah
Dj Flipp, make the money flip

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
He said he rich, he lied (huh?)
Niggas they broke, be quiet (be quiet, shh)
I got these lil niggas cryin' (shh)
They snitch when they hearin' them sirens (what?)(shh)
He said he rich, he lied (what?)
Niggas they broke be quiet (be quiet, shh)
I got these lil niggas cryin' (shh)
They snitch when they hearin' them sirens (snitch)

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
And I'm on wok (wok)
Yea nigga pouring up drop (drop)
Fuck nigga wanna get shot
Don't get too close you get dropped (brr, brr)
Fuck a op (op, op)
Fuck nigga we sendin' shot (shot)
They throw the gun in the dark
Wet this shit up like a mop

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
Twenty-two shots if you fuck with my gang
Shut the fuck up lil bitch suck on my thang
Twenty-four carats straight' cuttin' my fangs
Hop out the Uber then fuck on your main, yeah
Cheat on my bitch, boy I'm stuck in my ways
Eat on my dick, get the fuck out my face
Ice on my ring and on top of that 24K on my neck let it hang like a slave

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
He said he rich, he lied (huh?)
Niggas they broke, be quiet (be quiet, shh)
I got these lil niggas cryin' (shh)
They snitch when they hearin' them sirens (what?)(shh)
He said he rich, he lied (what?)
Niggas they broke be quiet (be quiet, shh)
I got these lil niggas cryin' (shh)
They snitch when they hearin' them sirens (snitch)

[Verse 3: Ugly God]
Aye, aye, aye
Grip that Glock (Grip that Glock)
Click clack pop (Click clack pop)
Sip that drop (Drop, drop)
Lean lean wok (Lean lean wok)
I got the wok just like Purpp (purpp)
You might get shot on my turf
My bitch keep a Glock in her purse (bitch)
She make you drop in a hearse (aye)

[Verse 4: Smokepurpp]
Put a nigga in a hearse (bitch)
Hunnit bands in a purse (bitch)
Sippin' mud out the dirt (bitch)
Put a pint in a skirt
Fifty thousand on my neck, on my wrist
I pull up, I pop out, I shoot and then dip
She wanna fuck I just put in the tip
Eat it all up and I leave her no tip

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
He said he rich, he lied (huh?)
Niggas they broke, be quiet (be quiet, shh)
I got these lil niggas cryin' (shh)
They snitch when they hearin' them sirens (what?)(shh)
He said he rich, he lied (what?)
Niggas they broke be quiet (be quiet, shh)
I got these lil niggas cryin' (shh)
They snitch when they hearin' them sirens (snitch)
