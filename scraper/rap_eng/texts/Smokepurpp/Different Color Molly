[Intro]
Make that chopper sing like Beyoncé
Make that chopper sing like Beyoncé
Yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah made that chopper sing like Beyoncé
I got different color Molly, yellow Ombré (molly)
She got that wet, wet, wet, wet, okay (okay)
I count up chips, chips, chips like some Frito Lay (chips)
I got that chopper on me, make it sing Beyoncé (sing)
I got different color Molly, yellow Ombré (molly)
She got that wet, wet, wet, wet, okay (okay)
I count up chips, chips, chips like Frito Lay

[Verse]
I'm in the mall, bitch, I ball
Shooters, they shoot out the wall (no)
They talking 'bout me and my gang
Glizzy on me and the bullets take off (take off)
Look at the ice on my wrist (yeah)
Bitch, I'm 19 and I'm rich (yeah)
I might just fuck on your bitch (yeah)
Passing her around like assist
Yeah
Hang with the goons and the greens
Look at the diamond, they dance (what)
Look at my chain, it got gems
Sipping that mud till it end (End)
All that I do is set trends (Trends)
I don't know you and your friends
I wanna fuck on your bitch, I just call up the bitch and I fuck her outside (Hey)
I only move with a pack (Skrt)
And I stay strapped like a dyke
Glock .45 with the beam and the K
Ksubi Jeans, I got 6-digit rings
I'm living life like a king
My niggas do the same thing
Hole in that nigga like Fruit Loop
Bullet connect like a Bluetooth
All of my niggas, they shoot you
Pull up and I drop the roof, roof
Diamond that all in my tooth, tooth
And I be smoking on boof, boof

[Chorus]
Yeah, made that chopper sing like Beyoncé
I got different color Molly, yellow Ombré (molly)
She got that wet, wet, wet, wet, okay (okay)
I count up chips, chips, chips like some Frito Lay (chips)
I got that chopper on me, make it sing, Beyoncé (sing)
Different color Molly, yellow Ombré (molly)
She got that wet, wet, wet, wet, okay (okay)
I count up chips, chips, chips like Frito Lay
