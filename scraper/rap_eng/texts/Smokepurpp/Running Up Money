[Intro]
I just dropped a xan in that lean
The way I'm shootin clips you think its movie scenes
Bitch I'm always winnin I feel like Charlie Sheen
But I'm Lil O and I'm still snatching' hoes

[Chorus] x8
We running we running the money
My niggas they get it (my niggas they get it)

[Verse 1]
Walk in the bando it smell like fish
Fuck up the pot then i fuck up my wrist
Diamonds they twerkin up onto my wrist
Smokin' on stank and the lean made me trip
I get designer for the low
Fuck on lil mama i know she a ho
Step on the work til I'm losing a toe
She fuck with the molly but snorting on blow
I just dropped a xan in that lean
The way I'm shootin clips you think its movie scenes
Bitch I'm always winnin I feel like Charlie Sheen
But I'm Lil O and I'm still snatching' hoes
And I'm pouring fo's
Get up off the coast
Smoking dope with my bros (aye)
Bitch i got like hella ho's
I'm shooting this shit like a target
All of these niggas a part of it
But now i'm eating on pasta
I pour red so me like a lobster

[Chorus] x8
