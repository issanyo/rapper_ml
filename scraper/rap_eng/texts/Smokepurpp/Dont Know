[Hook]
Niggas say they know me
Where your stripes at?
Lil water wet it with the 40 cal
Look at the ice on my neck (Ooh)
Bitch I gone' flex
(Yeah, hold up, hold up)
I got a dollar every motherfucker hating (Ayy)
And I'm sipping lean just like a patient (Ayy)
I got no patients
Foreign I'm racing
Lil water wet it with 80
Bitch its lil water in spaceship

[Verse]
Bitch I'm on your block, I'm with that nina
Bitch I'm sipping water, aquafina
Aye, yuh look at the ice on my wrist
Aye, look at the watch on your bitch
Aye, I just gone drop on that brick
What? In the party getting gnarly, yuh
Bitch I'm fucking flexing like matt hardy, uh
Ooh, damn, I feel like Matt Foley
Aye, yuh
None of these niggas dont know me
