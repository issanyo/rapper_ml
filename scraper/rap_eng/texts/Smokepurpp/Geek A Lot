[Intro]
Lil Purpp, aye this shit sound Smokepurpp as fuck
Lil Purpp bless yo trap
Oh my God, Ronny!

[Chorus]
Damn, I geek a lot, I geek a lot and a lot
I'm off the Xan, pour the Wok
And I got VVS diamonds my watch
Stop tryin' come in my spot
I want the brain, want the top
Tell one to come in my spot
I'm off the bean, not the Wok

[Verse]
Wait, yeah I got rich (damn)
I could just fuck any bitch (Lil Purpp)
Smokin' on thoink with yo bitch (Lil Purpp)
She say my gas really hit (yah)
Big choppas, ride with mad yoppas
She see the racks on the floor and she hop on my dick like she was a grasshopper
Gucci my kicks, I got designer from head to my kicks
Even my pants are designer, they Rick
Walk in the mall and spend a lil' brick
I'm off the Xan and I'm off the drank
Look at my Backwood it's full of that stank
Diamonds just water, they came from a tank
I pop a bean and get racks at the bank

[Chorus]
Damn, I geek a lot, I geek a lot and a lot
I'm off the Xan, pour the Wok
And I got VVS diamonds my watch
Stop tryin' come in my spot
I want the brain, want the top
Tell one to come in my spot
I'm off the bean, not the Wok
Damn, I geek a lot, I geek a lot and a lot
I'm off the Xan, pour the Wok
And I got VVS diamonds my watch
Stop tryin' come in my spot
I want the brain, want the top
Tell one to come in my spot
I'm off the bean, not the Wok

[Outro]
Bean, not the Wok
Bean, not the Wok
Bean, not the Wok
Bean, not the Wok
Bean, not the Wok
Bean, not the Wok
