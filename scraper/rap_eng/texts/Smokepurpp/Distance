[Intro]
Lil Purpp bless yo trap
Ya, ya, ya, ya
All these chains on my neck
Ice on my neck

[Chorus]
Keep that fuck shit at a distance (at a distance)
She just wanna fuck me 'cause I'm distant ('cause I)
She just wanna fuck me 'cause I'm different (ya dig)
I can feel that fuck shit from a distance (from a)
Keep that fuck shit at a distance (distance)
She just wanna fuck me 'cause I'm distant ('cause I'm distant)
She just wanna fuck me 'cause I'm different (ya dig)
I can see that fuck shit from a distance (ya dig)

[Verse]
With a Glock in the kitchen (in the kitchen, bless yo trap)
Make a nigga end up missin'
Young nigga shooting like a Piston
Put these hoes on a mission
Yeah he stole my swag I know (I know, I know)
Yeah he stole the sauce I know (ooh, sauce, ooh)
Yeah she wanna fuck I know (I know)
I just want the top then go (ooh)
I've been in the jungle
Running with that sniper and with that sack and then I fumble
Niggas wanna fight they wanna fight they wanna tussle
Glock .45 and it bigger than Mutombo (prrr)
How you know me don't know you (prrr)
Got 20 bands in the coupe
Got 30 bands in the stu (ya dig)
Fuck nigga shooting at you (ya dig)
Keep that fuck shit from a distance (prrr)
Bitch I get that bread like a pigeon

[Chorus]
Keep that fuck shit at a distance (at a distance)
She just wanna fuck me 'cause I'm distant ('cause I)
She just wanna fuck me 'cause I'm different (ya dig)
I can feel that fuck shit from a distance (from a)
Keep that fuck shit at a distance (distance)
She just wanna fuck me 'cause I'm distant
She just wanna fuck me 'cause I'm different (ya dig)
I can see that fuck shit from a distance (ya dig)
