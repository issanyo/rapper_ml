[Intro: Smokepurpp]
I be at the trap (trap)
Smokin' out the back (what)
Pump servin' crack (esketit)
Out the fuckin' [?] (gang, gang)
Xan with the shit (with the shit)
Purpp with the shit (with the shit)
Pull up on your block (skrr)...

[Verse 1: LILRUNITUP]
Pulling up all in my jag
I'm in my bag, I'm smoking gas
With a hoe, she hella bad
She always mad we poppin tags
Off a xan, we off them shits
We always let [?]

Purpp with me, we never lackin
Pistol packin, backwood draggin
Still [?], we smokin' loud
Got all them hoes up in the crowd
Spittin rounds of them guns sounds
You don't watch the bullets hit your mans
Y'all some fakes, [?]

You won't catch me lackin (won't catch me lackin)
Pistol really packin (brr)
Pour my bitch an act
While she in a fashion

Lean up in my sprite
Sippin muddy [?], pop a xan through the night
I be at the trap (trap)
Smokin' out the back (what)
Pump servin' crack (esketit)
Out the fuckin' [?] (gang, gang)
Xan with the shit (with the shit)
