Verse 1 - Smokepurpp:
Water on me like a dolphin
Put a nigga in his coffin
Smokin OG gas all these cookies got me coughin
Gelato smellin like I farted
All my niggas shoot
.22 hangin' out the roof
Knock the gold out his tooth
Pew pew pew, shoot
All my niggas move
Get that pack then I move it
Lil Purpp, I'm goin' stupid
Niggas say I'm dumb, I'm goin' dumb, I'm goin' stupid
I can't love no bitch, bitch I ain't cupid

Verse 2 - Milo Velour
And I'm cheefin'

Swing on me I guarantee you gon' get beat up
And you gaspin' on yo ass faster than a damn cheetah
Got other plans yeah I'm chasin bands I don't wanna meet up
And tell yo bitch to stop callin me I can't fuck wit eaters

Pull up in the lot
Smokin on that pot
Lookin for the guap

Wit yo bitch, she might gimme top
Fuck a clip, you can't get yo shit rocked

Im in love wit the money
If you ain't talkin business you can't get nothing from me
I want 50's and 100's
I die for the 5's but I love me some 20's

Ridin' wit that heat, bih
Do that cuz I'm me, bih
