[Intro]
Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Yuh
Ouu, ouu, ouu, ouu, yuh
Lil Purpp bless yo trap!
Aye!

[Verse]
It's a big fact (bitch!)
If I pull up, get your shit snatched (huh?)
B-Bitch, I stack them bullets like a Big Mac (blit blit blit!)
Ain't getting shit back
Pull up on a nigga and I pop 'em like a Tic-Tac
Lil Purpp pull up, nigga, no face
L-Leave 'em leaking out the top like a Colgate
Diamonds frozen (ouu, huh)
Ice up on my body got me feeling like a snowflake (Huh, huh, ouu)
Riding with the guys, selling pot (selling pot, ouu)
Hop outside the foreign, bitches cry, niggas die (ouu, ouu, ouu)
(Ouu) I got two guns
Like I'm in a band, bitch I came in with like two drums

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
F-F-Fuck up the trap, I did it, let's get it
Fuck up the trap, I did it, let's get it
Fuck up the trap, I did it, let's get it
Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Fuck it up
Fuck up the trap, I did it, let's get it
Fuck up the trap, I did it, let's get it
Fuck up the trap, I did it, ouu
Fuck up the trap, I did it, let's get it
Fuck up the trap, I did it, let's get it
Fuck up the trap, I did it, let's get it
