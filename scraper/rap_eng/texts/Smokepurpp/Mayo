[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Fuckin' that bitch and you cuffin' that hoe everyday (ooh)
I get a bag and I'm fuckin' it up every day
She wanna cuff me but I think I'm stuck in my ways (stuck in my ways)
So I just pour up the lean 'cause it's numbin' the pain (numbin' the pain)
Aye, like an astronaut
I'm out of this world like an astronaut
Niggas out here and they stealin' the sauce everyday (everyday)
So I just run up the guap and I count up the cake

And I be grindin', a young nigga gotta get paid
All of my niggas gonna shoot like a pistol it rang

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Ooh, hey
Twenty-five bands on the dental
And it's my car, fuck a rental (skrrt skrrt)
Two hoes, I'm in the middle (ayy)
Play with that bitch like a fiddle (play with that)
She wanna salt me like brittle (like brittle)
And I wanna play with her nipples (Lil Purpp)
Aye, and you spent a bag on that ho (ho)

She learnin' some shit from that pole
Hey, she suckin' me out of my soul (Lil Purpp)
Look at these diamonds and gold
Niggas jealous and they get exposed
