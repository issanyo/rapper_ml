[Intro: Lil Pump]
Faded
Hm, what you gotta say?
Ooh, damn, ooh
Ooh, what you gotta say?
Ooh, Lil Pump
Damn, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
Pull up in a Wraith, flexin' every day
Gucci everything, Louis everything
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
What you gotta say? Bitch I'm gettin' paid
Bitch you gettin' laid, spend it in a day
Spend a hunnid thousand on a ma'fuckin' maid
Swear to God, put it on my grandfather's grave
I'll go and pop two Mollys to the face
Hop out Lambo like you won a fuckin' race
Niggas gettin' mad 'cause I went and took they place
Come to the trap where you know it ain't safe
Hunnids on hunnids on hunnids, ooh
Pull up on a teacher, I'm stuntin' (damn)
Countin' up racks, it ain't nothin'
Sold you rerock and Robitussin
Ouu, Purpp pull up in a coupe, everybody know I flex like ouu
Bitch, I don't know who the fuck is you
Pour a four tec in my Mountain Dew

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
Pull up in a Wraith, flexin' every day
Gucci everything, Louis everything
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?

[Verse 2: SmokePurpp]
Spend a hunnid thousand every day
And my yoppa Macarena every day (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
Turn 'em down, I'ma stick 'em like some tape (Lil Purp)
Call my thirty, got his own fuckin' brain (Brr)
Lil Purp, I be thuggin' every day (Every day)
If I catch him, I'ma pop him like a safe (Bop, bop)
Pop a Xan, catch a body, skip a date (Bop, bah)
GTA, got a star on my face (Star on my face)
And I keep a pistol on me, lil' dawg (Huh?)
Lil Pump, he a smacker, lil' dawg (Yo what?)
And I only hit designer in the mall
All these diamonds on me, Paul Wall
Lookin' at my body, all this Louis (Let's go)
Gun 'em down in the trap, then we move 'em (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
Now they lookin' for his body in the sewer (Huh?)
Lil Pump do the work like a student (Bop, bop, bop)

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
Pull up in a Wraith, flexin' every day
Gucci everything, Louis everything
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say?
