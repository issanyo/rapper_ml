[Intro: Smokepurpp & 24hrs]
Yeah
Lil Purpp
On me
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

[Refrain: 24hrs]
She said, "20, won't you answer your phone?
Been thinking 'bout you at home alone"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To be my girl, woo, gotta be my biggest fan
A different world, ooh, everywhere I'll hold your hand
We fuck, we fight, ooh, beat the pussy up like Mike
Got a whole bunch of racks, get whatever you like
We on the run, Hit-Boy drums
Night at the Palms, OG cookie my lungs
I'm not the type to play pitty-pat
You give it up, you can't get it back
Talk 'bout the gang, get your fitted cracked
I must admit, man these bitches wack

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Gotta try harder, OG Prada
I'm your father, hot like lava
Fifty ball on me, fifty ball on me
Fifty ball on me, never lonely
Fifty ball on me, fifty ball on me
Fifty ball on me, never lonely
Gotta try harder, gotta try harder
OG Prada, hot like lava

[Refrain: 24hrs]
She said, "20, won't you answer your phone?
Been thinking 'bout you at home alone"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To be my girl, woo, gotta be my biggest fan
A different world, ooh, everywhere I'll hold your hand
We fuck, we fight, ooh, beat the pussy up like Mike
Got a whole bunch of racks, get whatever you like

Night at the Palms, OG cookie my lungs

[Chorus: 24hrs & Moneybagg Yo]
Gotta try harder, OG Prada
I'm your father (Your Da-Da), hot like lava (Woo)
Fifty ball on me (Randolph), fifty ball on me (Yeah)
Fifty ball on me (Fifty dollars), never lonely (Nope)
Fifty ball on me (Fifty), fifty ball on me (I'm a big one)
Fifty ball on me (Fifty), never lonely (Hey)
Gotta try harder, gotta try harder (Lil' harder)
OG Prada (Prada), hot like lava (Fire)

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Fifty pack on me (What strand?)
Ugh, ugh, gas bag (Exotic)
Fifty racks on his head, turn him to a hashtag
Big drip, I'ma splash racks (Drippy)
You ain't shit 'cause you half-ass (Why you trippin', bitch?)
He got the childish attitude, callin' me Da-Da (Hah)
Skydweller cost an eighty ball (Eighty)
Big crib, got it gated off (Gated)
Skeeted on her, then skated off (Skrrt)
I'm on fire like they laid me off
Jet to the water (Wa-Wa)
The yacht got chartered (On me)
Livin' larger
'Sace shades, Big Poppa (Notorious)

[Chorus: 24hrs & Moneybagg Yo]
Gotta try harder (Yeah), OG Prada
I'm your father, hot like lava
Fifty ball on me, fifty ball on me
Fifty ball on me, never lonely
Fifty ball on me, fifty ball on me
Fifty ball on me, never lonely
Gotta try harder, gotta try harder
OG Prada, hot like lava

[Verse 3: Smokepurpp]
Fifty band on me
Blew twenty bands at Follies
Pop me a perc, get lonely
Brand new 'Rari is a six speed
She with me, we downin' these Percocets
Slimy, my neck got me drippin' wet (Purpp)
Heard he copied, then we into that
Thirty-eight special, it go to his fitted cap (Yeah)
We got the sticks (Sticks)
We ain't do none of that internet (Internet)
Me and my shooters not into that
Fucked up a ball and you know that we get it back
We got pink molly, make these bitches go crazy
Used to whippin' up babies, back of the brand new 'Cedes

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Gotta try harder, OG Prada
I'm your father, hot like lava
Fifty ball on me, fifty ball on me
Fifty ball on me, never lonely
Fifty ball on me, fifty ball on me
Fifty ball on me, never lonely
Gotta try harder, gotta try harder
OG Prada, hot like lava
