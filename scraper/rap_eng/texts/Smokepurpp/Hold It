[Chorus]
Smashin' in my Rollie
Toolie', keep it on me
And these jeans hold a hunnit' bands, so I can't hold it
Let you fuck my bitch cause I be pimpin' like I'm holy
Police pull me over
Here's the Glock, bitch, hold it
Hold it, hold it
Bitch, hold it
Smashin' in my Rollie
Here's the Glock, bitch, hold it
Bitch, hold it
Hold it
Bitch, hold it
Smashin' in my Rollie
Here's the Glock, bitch, hold it

[Verse]
Hold it
If not, then you loaded
Bitch, you better blow it
Fuck niggas know I'm blowin'
I pop a Xanny with my teacher, I can't focus
You might see me in that Royce, but I'm trapped up out that Focus
Hoe, I'm on the drugs, I'm like Cobain
White girls all around me doing cocaine
Talkin' on my gang make me blow brains
.40 to his head like it's Rogaine
Bitch, I'm good at math
All I do is add
Then I smash on cat
I don't wanna fuck yo' bitch, I know the pussy trash
Lean, lean, Wok, lean, lean, Wok, cause that other shit is ass

[Chorus]
Smashin' in my Rollie
Toolie, keep it on me
And these jeans hold a hunnit' bands, so I can't hold it
Leave you for my bank cause I be pimpin' like I'm holy
Police pull me over
Here's the Glock, bitch, hold it
