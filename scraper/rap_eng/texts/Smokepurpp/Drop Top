[Intro]
S-S-S-Soundboi

[Chorus]
Ridin' 'round, drop the drop
I'm ridin' town drop the top
I'm ridin' 'round, drop the top
I want the top, I want that drop, baby
I want that drop, baby
I want the top wanna see you take that top, baby
Lil Purpp, huh, Lil Purpp, huh
Drug addict, baby call me Lil Kurt, yeah

[Verse]
She gon' pop some percy cause my cup so dirty
And I need a Lamboghini, doors open up like they a birdy
I don't want no fake smiles, swear to god that leany hate me
I don't wanna feel no more, on my mama, that shit hurt me
Thousand dollar shirt, just to rip the shirt
This that Gucci snake, always servin' on the kick
Shout out Soundboi, he ride with me everywhere I go
Lil hoe hold the pole, from my life can't go
You want fuck, baby, just let me know it's yes or no
Like a Ouija Board, we can take it slow

[Chorus]
Ridin' 'round, drop the drop
I'm ridin' town drop the top
I'm ridin' 'round, drop the top
I want the top, I want that drop, baby
I want that drop, baby
I want the top wanna see you take that top, baby
Lil Purpp, huh, Lil Purpp, huh
Drug addict, baby call me Lil Kurt, yeah
