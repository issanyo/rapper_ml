[Intro: Smokepurpp, DJ Flippp, & Red Drum]
New chains around my neck
Lil Purpp
Red Drum on the beat
Lil Purpp
Lil Purpp
Lil Purpp
DJ Flippp, make the money flip!

[Chorus]
I'm on the block
Sipping wok
Lean lean, wok
Lean lean, wok
I'm on the block
Sipping wok
Lean lean, wok
Lean lean, wok
Lean lean, wok
Lean lean, wok
I'm on the block, bitch you know I keep the Glock
I'm in the Chevy, boy I'm moving with a thot
Glock .45 came with 30 shots

[Verse]
It's Lil Purpp, Lil Purpp bless yo trap
If I ain't blessing than I'm kicking in that trap
Kick dope, kick dope
Everybody to the motherfucking floor
AK-47, let it blow, lay a nigga on the floor
Now his body looking cold
Leave a nigga with a toe tag
Toe tag, bitch I'm at the mall, popping both tags
And my teacher had a fat ass
I was skipping class, in the bathroom serving nick bags
Serving percy bar, serving xanax bar
I'm the only nigga at school with a foreign car
Niggas asking for the recipie
'Cause I've got the sauce, niggas tryna get the best of me
Niggas testing me, niggas checking me
Niggas pressing me, they won't get a cent from me

[Chorus]
I'm on the block
Sipping wok
Lean lean, wok
Lean lean, wok
I'm on the block
Sipping wok
Lean lean, wok
Lean lean, wok
Lean lean, wok
Lean lean, wok
I'm on the block, bitch you know I keep the Glock
I'm in the Chevy, boy I'm moving with a thot
Glock .45 came with 30 shots
