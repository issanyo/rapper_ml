Bitch I'm from the south
And my niggas got that clout
And shawty wanna fuck

Nigga I'm trippin', but I'm still sippin' lean

Then I roll up then I smoke that good weed
Cause I'm a G, nigga you creep
Clap that AK and you know I flee the scene
Put yo ass to sleep, true religious fiend
You can see it in my jeans, and my eyes, they red from smoking that green

Leave yo shirt red, and you know what I said all you niggas is dead

[Verse 2: Young Cito]
Bitch I'm in the south, amoking on the cloud
Nigga I'm a king, man you better bow down
Sippin on the lean, it feel like a dream
Got a white girl and she sweeter than cream
Pop me a ? then I'm geekin'
Fuck these chores, no clean, no speakin'
I'm in the south with these hoes, get reckless
Up in her ? man she ?
Caught me a ? I ain't talking ?
Got a latina and she screaming, don't know her name
These hoes talking like a ? of ?
I know we up next, and I'm getting in the lane
? a thot cause I love damn money
Ima pull up in a rari, I never say sorry
I'm ? in the ? but I ain't James ?
I'm smoking this weed, I'm selling this Dro
Run through a check, you gon' call me yo bro
Robbin these niggas all day for the O
? through his mouth, what he say? Who knows
I love robbin guns, man I'm addicted
I'm tellin the story, it ain't no fiction
My cologne sells, it ain't no prediction
If you thing I'm ? smoking my bandy
Bitch I'm from the south, you already know
Niggas talkin on the lot, they ain't really bout that life
I'm making money, y'all dead, you ain't got no wife
I like making the money, just fucking bitches
Niggas talkin shit, but these niggas they just snitches
