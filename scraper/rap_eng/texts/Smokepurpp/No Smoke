[Hook]
You don't want smoke on my gang
Twenty-three thousand my chain
And I don't speak on no mans
You snitchin', I blow out your brains
You don't want smoke wit my gang
You don't want smoke wit my gang
You don't want smoke wit my gang
You don't want smoke wit my gang

[Verse]
Her pussy wet like a water park
After dark I fuck the bitch in the car garage
Niggas that don't wanna smoke with me
I keep the wood like a forest tree
I'm in the trap like a pack of loud
All of my teachers want fuck me now
All of my teachers want fuck me now
Wow same teacher class I was serving loud
Lil purpp they know I be going wild
You can get smoked like a black and mild
Bitch it's lil water
Suck me like a hiccup
Drill you in the pick-up
Go and pick your bitch up
Remember that hoe used to talk me down
I make more money than lawyers now
I don't do hits I got bounties now
I don't want friends I want Audis now

[Hook]
You don't want smoke on my gang
Twenty-three thousand my chain
And I don't speak on no mans
You snitchin', I blow out your brains
You don't want smoke wit my gang
You don't want smoke wit my gang
You don't want smoke wit my gang
You don't want smoke wit my gang
