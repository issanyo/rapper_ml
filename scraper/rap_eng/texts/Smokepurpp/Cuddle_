Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse]
I don't wanna fuck a single bitch, I want a double (wooh)
Bitch, I keep the peace like I came here with a puzzle (grr)
If he actin’ crazy, I'ma pop him like a wobble (grr)
Bitch, I came to fuck, I did not come just to cuddle (woah, woah)
Bitch, I'm smokin’ dope up in yo mama living room
See me in a [?]
