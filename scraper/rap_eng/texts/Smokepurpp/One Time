Ronny J on that beat fuck nigga

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I need neck one time, need more checks one time
Fuck your ex one time, now she on my line
One time, one time
One time, one time
One time, one time
One time (huh?), one time (huh?)
I need neck one time, need more checks one time
Fuck your ex one time, now she on my line

[Verse: Smokepurpp]
Fucking that bitch and she gone
Smoking on boof and it's strong (what?)
I lit that bitch in the thong (thong)
Now that bitch singing my song (huh)
Young nigga sipping on Wok

Look at your lean, it don't drop (drop)
Look at my chain, filled with ice (ice)

Molly Kelly Price (Molly Kelly)
I pop on a perc, I eat it like rice
I fuck with your bitch, she holding the pipe

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I need neck one time, need more checks one time
Fuck your ex one time, now she on my line
One time, one time
One time, one time
One time, one time
One time (huh?), one time (huh?)

Fuck your ex one time, now she on my line
One time (what?), one time (huh?)
One time (huh?), one time (Lil Purpp)
One time (Lil Purpp), one time (huh?)
One time (what?), one time (huh? Lil Purpp)
