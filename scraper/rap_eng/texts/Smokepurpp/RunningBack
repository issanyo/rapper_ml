[Verse]
Once I get that pack bitch, I'm a running back
Extendos all around me, I can never lack
Once I leave the bank I don't know how to act
Pull up on your mans , I'm out in all black
I don't want your lean, it's lookin' cut
I mix the purple with the Sprite, you know what's up
I got shooters and they itchin' just to bust
I got shooters and they poppin' out the cut
.40's, .30's, points we got it all
Gas on me, always puffin' some
You ain't bout that money fuck nigga we can't speak
Smokin' on the Henny so I get relief
Shootin' blind nigga, swear my niggas in these streets
If I catch a nigga lackin', like a song he gon' leak
Posted at the trap, I'm flippin' packs
Middleman, straight profit out that pack
Redbone bitch she gon' suck a nigga dry, yeah
Pill poppin' nigga, I can't change, I'd rather die, yeah
I might just fuck up the bank, I might just go and just hit a lick
I'm in the trap and I'm whippin' a brick
I'm with this chick and she suck on my dick
Stupid lil' thot said she wanna love the boy
Hell nah, I'm playin' bitches like a toy
Pull up skrt, pour up rain in the trap, got a pond
Man, you tell me what's up

[Hook]
Once I get that pack bitch, I'm a running back
Once I get that pack bitch, I'm a running back
Running back, running back, running back, running back
Running back, running back, running back, running back
Once I get that pack bitch, I'm a motherfuckin' running back
I'm a motherfuckin' running back
Running back, running back, running back, running back
Running back, running back, running back, running back

[Outro]
I'm off a xan and I feel good, I'm cruisin' slow, all in your hood
I got a ski, you know what's up
My shooters with me and you know we finna bust
Once I get that pack bitch, I'm a running back
Once I get that pack bitch, I'm a running back
Running back, running back, running back, running back
Running back, running back, running back, running back
