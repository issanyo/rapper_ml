Niggas talking on me cause I fucked they hoes

Niggas talking on me cause I fucked they hoes

[Verse]
Give me brain like a psychic
Riding round with P90
Bitches thinkin that we ISIS
Hi-Tech bloody cup
I just spiked it
Put these diamonds on my neck
Cause a nigga priceless
Lil Purpp Bless Yo Trap

Running through a sack
My youngest caught that

Only shoot ‘Bout 3

When he on the block, I let her ride me like a pony
Back down where you from, claim yo hood
You a phony
