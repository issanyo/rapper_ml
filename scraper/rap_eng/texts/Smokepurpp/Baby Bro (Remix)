[Chorus: 88 Camino]
Now they want my bag, they want my quote
Now they want a band, they want a
Now they want my bag, they want my quote
Now they want my bag, they want my
They ain't wanted me, they want my bro
They ain't wanted me, they want my woe
They ain't wanted me, they want my hoe
They ain't wanted me when I was broke
Now they want my bag, they want my dope
Wonder what my bag is, what I smoke
Wonder what my swag is, who I rope
Now they want my bag, they want my quote
They ain't wanted me, they want my bro
They ain't wanted me, they want my woe
Never wanted me, they want my hoe
Never wanted me when I was broke

[Verse: Smokepurpp]
Hey, now I got a bag, I can't go broke (I can't go broke, never again)
Lil boy run up on me, he get poked (yeah, he get poked)
Keep that thing inside expensive coat (expensive coat)
Knew I wanted this since I was four (ooh, hey)
She get it on the pole (ooh)
Fuck that ho all seven days a week (ooh, ooh, of the week, ooh)
Fuck that ho like even in my sleep (ooh, even in my sleep, ooh)
Lil bitch wanna peep on what I smoke (dope, dope)
Fuck with NAV, I give 'em all the smoke (doo, doo, ha, ha)
Pour a 6 and I fly out to the west coast
Bitch, I'm drippin' every time they see me (drip, see me, Lil Purpp)
Diamonds on me dancin' and they gleamin' (and they gleamin')

[Chorus: 88 Camino]
Now they want my bag, they want my quote
Now they want a band, they want a
Now they want my bag, they want my quote
Now they want my bag, they want my
They ain't wanted me, they want my bro
They ain't wanted me, they want my woe
They ain't wanted me, they want my hoe
They ain't wanted me when I was broke
Now they want my bag, they want my dope
Wonder what my bag is, what I smoke
Wonder what my swag is, who I rope
Now they want my bag, they want my quote
They ain't wanted me, they want my bro
They ain't wanted me, they want my woe
Never wanted me, they want my hoe
Never wanted me when I was broke
