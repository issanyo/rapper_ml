[Intro]
Young Jefe homes

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I get this feeling (i get this feeling)
I can't describe (i can’t describe)
Go call them bad bitches up I need me a vibe (ah ah)
Young nigga on fire, I-I can't deny (fire, fire)
Don't Put your hands up ill nigga or you gone die (woah woah woah)
I get that cash, yeah yeah, get it fast (get it fast)
And if i fuck with the bitch, might get her a bag (get her a bag)
Get the bitch a new ass (get her new ass)
Get the bitch some new swag
Tell me it ain’t enough real niggas left here that was the last (I was the last)

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Stretch that money and  my little bitch will bring it back (bring it back)
So many racks on me, I might fuck around and get her back (get her back)
Love that Lambo but that Mcclaren move real fast (skrt skrt)
I just poured a four, I'm hoping I don't crash (skrt skrt, I don't crash)
Stretch that money and my little bitch will bring it back (bring it back)
So many racks on me, I might fuck around and get her back (get her back)
Love that Lambo but that Mcclaren move real fast (skrt skrt)
I just poured a four, I'm hoping I don't crash (skrt skrt)

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
God damn, god damn
I'm with Smokepurpp, lil bitch we smokin' Biscotti (smokepurp, smokepurp)
Got the cottage, bitches rolling off the molly (they rolling)
Sell them bricks, fuck your bitch, yeah thats my hobby (ah ahh)
Stupid bitch, bit my dick she said sorry (god damn, god damn)
They watch Jefe shoot the shot off the pivot (swish)
Little thot, she so hot, I got the digits (lil thot)
You got that junk in your trunk girl lets get it (ouu ouu)
This a automatic pump (boom)
Bitch lets get it

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Stretch that money and  my little bitch will bring it back (bring it back)
So many racks on me, I might fuck around and get her back (get her back)
Love that Lambo but that Mcclaren move real fast (skrt skrt)
I just poured a four, I’m hoping I don’t crash (skrt skrt, I don't crash)
Stretch that money and my little bitch will bring it back (bring it back)
So many racks on me, I might fuck around and get her back (get her back)
Love that Lambo but that Mcclaren move real fast (skrt skrt)
I just poured a four, I’m hoping I don't crash (skrt skrt)

[Outro: Shy Glizzy]
God damn, God damn
