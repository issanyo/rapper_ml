[Intro]
Woo, woo, woo
I like doing drugs all the time
Lil Purpp, skrrt
We like...

[Chorus]
In the six, brand new whip (skrrt)
Brand new Rollie, aww, that's a brick
The clock is tickin' (aww), out of time
I like pourin' fours in my Sprite (lean, huh?)
We like doin' drugs in the night (in the night)
Black out, aww, that's for the night (that's for the)
In the six (uh, huh), brand new whip (skrrt, skrrt)
Brand new Rollie, aww, that's a brick

[Verse]
Fuck! Faded all the time
Once I stay all night, I felt like I'm losin' my mind (losin' my mind)
Don't remember who I am, I grab my phone and fuck a dime (yeah)
Aww, and I do this all the time (huh)
It's jurassic, money is elastic
Bitch I stretch it all, fuck a plastic (fuck a)
Fuckin' on your thot, and then I turn that ho to past-tense
Balmain on my jeans but got Moncler up on my jacket
Aww, Xannies keep me happy
Walk inside the bank, they put my money in a packet
Aww, damn he on Xannies
Pull up on your block, he see a pack then he might jack it

[Chorus]
In the six, brand new whip (skrrt)
Brand new Rollie, aww, that's a brick
The clock is tickin' (aww), out of time
I like pourin' fours in my Sprite (lean, huh?)
We like doin' drugs in the night (in the night)
Black out, aww, that's for the night (that's for the)
In the six (uh, huh), brand new whip (skrrt, skrrt)
Brand new Rollie, aww, that's a brick
