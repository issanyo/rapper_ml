[Chorus]
I got five ho's in my phone
But I can't pick up right now
I got two ho's in my home
And I kick the bitches out
She want fuck me, she want suck me
But I think she want my clout

[Bridge]
I got perky, I got molly (molly!)
And I'm too fucked up right now
I got perky, I got molly
And I'm too fucked up right now
I got perky, I got molly
But I'm too fucked up right now

[Verse]
Swimming in the money, got me seasick
I don't want the xannies but I need 'em
Fuckin' up the racks at a Neiman's
Ice up on my wrist, I'm anemic
Looking at the racks, you can see it
Got these little niggas wanna be me
Tryna swag swipe I could see 'em
Free sauce, free sauce, if you need it

[Chorus]
I got five ho's in my phone
But I can't pick up right now
I got two ho's in my home
And I kick the bitches out
She want fuck me, she want suck me
But I think she want my clout

[Bridge]
I got perky, I got molly (molly!)
And I'm too fucked up right now
I got perky, I got molly
And I'm too fucked up right now
I got perky, I got molly
But I'm too fucked up right now

[Chorus]
I got five ho's in my phone
But I can't pick up right now
I got two ho's in my home
And I kick the bitches out
She want fuck me, she want suck me
But I think she want my clout

[Bridge]
I got perky, I got molly (molly!)
And I'm too fucked up right now
I got perky, I got molly
And I'm too fucked up right now
I got perky, I got molly
But I'm too fucked up right now
