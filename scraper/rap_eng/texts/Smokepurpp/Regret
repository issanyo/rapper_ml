[Intro]
All these chains on me
Purpp Digital, Digital Purpp
Sonny Digital
All these chains on me nigga
(Yeah, Yeah)

[Hook]
I did some things I regret, young nigga came from the trenches
That’s why I sip on this mud, I did some things I regret
Riding around with that Tec, I did some things I regret
Murder Murder Murder, I did some things I regret
I pick up the check and I stretch, young nigga flex on his ex
I did some things I regret, still riding around with that Tec
7 damn chase, all my niggas baked
Kicking that door like Liu Kang

[Verse 1]
I told you Lil Purpp got crack
I hit that bitch from the back, I hit that bitch with a sack
Sonny rollin' grams of wax
You ain't top this lil nigga, beautiful [?]
You better run to your nigga, I keep a gun there you old nigga

[Hook]
I did some things I regret, young nigga came from the trenches
That’s why I sip on this mud,  I did some things I regret
Riding around with that Tec, I did some things I regret
Murda  Murda Murda, I did some things I regret
I did some things I regret, young nigga came from the trenches
That’s why I sip on this mud,  I did some things I regret
Riding around with that Tec, I did some things I regret
Murda Murda Murda, I did some things I regret
