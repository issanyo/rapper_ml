[Intro: Smokepurpp]
When you hear that money counter, that's Killa Slade in the back
Ffff beep!
Yuh! Esketit

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
My cup is soo muddy

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
My cup is soo muddy, goddammit
It's me and Uncle, goddamnit
Got with your bitch and we smashin'
We makin' an oreo sandwich
I blow up a nigga with toolies
His bitch on the run, yeah, she foolish
Goddamn I love fuckin' these groupies
We goin' it look like a (?)
100 round drum on my hip
Pussy soo wet I might slip
Pussy soo wet it gon' drip
Pussy soo wet I might lick
Codeine and sprite what I sip
She don't get shit but this dick
I make her cum, make her flip
Samsung, it jump on hip
Smokin' on Cali, I'm gone
I just left off to Hong Kong
Bitch wanna rip on my bong
Bitch wanna sing all my songs

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy
My cup is soo muddy

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
I just be smoking and I just be lurking
I cannot focus, you niggas are roses
You fake, niggas know I can't relate
I want a .37, no 38
Everyone I know got a .40
I swear that these niggas don't know me
I swear that these niggas don't know me
I swear to God, dammit, these niggas so phony
Bitch, I'ma ball like Ginobli, I swear I be smokin' on OG
When I pull up, fuck the police
And get the picture like Sony
