[Intro: $ki Mask The Slump God]
Ayy, I got my Breaking Bad jacket on
VR
All star

[Verse 1: $ki Mask The Slump God]
Ayy, ayy, ayy ayy
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, flexin' wrist
Captain Crunchy (lickety lickety), got my Tommy
He gon' need to drive a 30 leave him wet
Like a mad dog, chains on my neck
Bitch, got a vest just like 50 (my neck)
Got a vest just like 50 (my chest)
Got a vest just like 50 (my neck)
Got a vest just like 50 (window shopper)
Got a vest just like 50 (you a fuckin' window shopper)
Got a vest just like 50 (you a fuckin' ayy ayy ayy ayyy)
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, bitch, lil' bitch!

[Hook: Dantes]
Damn I love the way she flex
She know I love the way she hangs
Every single time she know I [?]
Every single time when I have around my waistline
Run away

Call me crazy one time, call me crazy one time
Call me crazy one time, call me crazy one time
Can't give you no time, I don't waste my time
Can't give you no shine, can't give you no shine
Call me crazy one time, call me crazy one time
Call me crazy one time, call me crazy one time
Can't give you no shine, can't give you no shine
I don't waste my time, I don't waste my time

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Tweakin' off a pill (off a pill)
My drank double sealed (double sealed)
I'm smokin' Sour Diesel (what)
My drank double sip
Two bitches kissing me
My old hoe missing me
And the chains around my neck they shine like Christmas tree
Codeine drip
My shoes drip
I count [?]
I count guap
I can't stop
I count checks
Ayy, Diamonds shine like Fiji
Diamonds shine like Fiji
Diamond move like water, you can see it drippin'
Diamonds shine like Fiji, diamonds shine like Fiji
Diamonds move like water, you can see it drippin'

[Hook: Dantes]
Call me crazy one time, call me crazy one time
Call me crazy one time, call me crazy one time
Can't give you no shine, can't give you no shine
I don't waste my time, I don't waste my time

[Outro: $ki Mask The Slump God]
Got a vest just like 50 (my neck)
Got a vest just like 50 (my chest)
Got a vest just like 50 (my neck)
Got a vest just like 50 (window shopper)
Got a vest just like 50 (you a fuckin' window shopper)
Got a vest just like 50 (you a fuckin' ayy ayy ayy ayyy)
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayyy, bitch, lil' bitch!
