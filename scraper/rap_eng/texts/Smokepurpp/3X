[Intro]
Oh my god Ronny

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I just came back from Atlanta
I fell in love with a dancer
She love to eat the banana
I think her name was Samantha
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
I just came back from Atlanta
I fell in love with a dancer
She love to eat the banana
I think her name was Amanda
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Fuck on that bitch, she get kicked to the curb
She gave me brain like a nerd
Fuck on that bitch 'til she get on my nerves
I kick her out, I'm like swerve
Fucked the hoe, three times
Got the head, three times
Kick her out, peace sign
She calling my phone, I decline
Lil bitch, she love to eat up the dick
I let her swallow that shit
I put it all on her lip
Yeah, go crazy
She wanna be my lil baby
She snortin' like it's the 80's
She ride me like a Mercedes

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I just came back from Atlanta
I fell in love with a dancer
She love to eat the banana
I think her name was Samantha
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
I just came back from Atlanta
I fell in love with a dancer
She love to eat the banana
I think her name was Amanda
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign

[Verse 2: Smokepurrp]
Yeah you know we really having shit
Lil Purrp came in with a half a brick
I pour a deuce and I pop a stick
She give me neck with another bitch
Fuck on that hoe, you could have her
Walk in the spot, pull out camera
She eat the dick like banana
Came with a bop, that's a hammer
Fuck on that bitch like three times
And she doing blow, she do three lines
And I'm counting money like a banker
All these other niggas on the decline
Wait, I'm on a perc
Fuck on that bitch, then I skrt
Chopper on me, it go skrt
Chopper on me, it don't flirt
And I'm off a bean, I be geeked up
I be smoking gas, really reek up
You can catch a ball like Bautista
I just seen yo' man in a Nissan
Fuck on yo' hoe and that's facts
I hit that bitch from the back
I met a bitch in Atlanta, she love to throw that shit back

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I just came back from Atlanta
I fell in love with a dancer
She love to eat the banana
I think her name was Samantha
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
I just came back from Atlanta
I fell in love with a dancer
She love to eat the banana
I think her name was Amanda
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
Fucked the hoe, three times
Kicked her out, peace sign
