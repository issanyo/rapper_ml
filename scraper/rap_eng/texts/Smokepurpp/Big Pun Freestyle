[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Yuh
Lil Purpp
Aye, this shit sound Smokepurpp as fuck
Big gun, huh

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Big gun, look like big pun
Choppa with a drum, bitch tell me where you from
If you run up on me, see the light just like the sun
He was talking crazy now his mama lost a son
Popping out the bullshit like a creep with a strap
I don't know your name, I don't wanna give you that
And I'm popping yellow pills, it look like a cap
If you come around here, you go out back
And I got trees, like a forest
He was staring, I put bullets in his forehead
Lil Purpp don't give a fuck, yeah you know it
I got junkies coming in like they employed
Take your chain, charge it to the gang
Lil Purpp, bitch I bring the pain
I'm in the paint, skrting in the Range
I got a choppa and that bitch got long range

[Verse 2: Yoppa BAM]
You wasn't with me, shooting out that Benz
Counterfeit check, run off with that check
I should be dead, but someone said I didn't
That's why I keep hella guns like a Vet
On the block, I roll the dice with my life
I swear that shit hurt when I heard they took mine
Free my nigga (?), bitch I'm (?)
Money don't stop, the only way I stay alive
New Balenciagas match the newer Glock
I'm the only nigga with cookies on my block
Shoot across the club, they don't wanna let me in they shot
30 round clip, that's a lot of bodies dropping
