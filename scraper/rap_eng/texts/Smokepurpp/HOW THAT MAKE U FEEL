[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Lil Purpp blessed yo' trap
Ay this shit sound  Smokepurpp as fuck
What? Huh?
Oh my God, Ronny

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Fuck one time, then I fuck her sister
Bitch give me neck and I don't even kiss her
Chains wrapped up make it feel like Twister
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Fuck one time, then I fuck her sister
Bitch give me neck and I don't even kiss her
Chains wrapped up make it feel like Twister
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Drop .45 and the vehicle go splat
Walk in the party and the bitches on smack
Make a bitch sit on my lap
I got that Glock on my lap
Trappin' in the kitchen with a bitch, whippin' up crack
Whippin' it, till it turn black
Don't need a pound of the gas, needed a pack, (uhh go back)
I'm in the trap, feel like 5 xans
Woke on a xan, shot yo' man
Look at my diamonds, like lightning, they dance
Go to the jeweler, 100k in the van
Look at the diamonds, they wet
They wavy, they splash, they move like the ocean, uh
Niggas be pussy like virgin (ooh)
Boy you a stain like detergent

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Fuck one time, then I fuck her sister
Bitch give me neck and I don't even kiss her
Chains wrapped up make it feel like Twister
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Fuck one time, then I fuck her sister
Bitch give me neck and I don't even kiss her
Chains wrapped up make it feel like Twister
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Documented baller, diamonds on my collar
Caller ID says Lady Gaga
Rose gold Rottweiler when I pop bottles
Jump out the Chevy Tahoe look like Johnny Bravo
Lemon berry locket froze up my esophagus
Now it's noon, I'm moonwalking on my tour bus
Only Wock lean in my white cups
Oreo blunts, double stuffed
Moonlight reflects up off the cobblestone
I got Pirate blood in my chromosomes
Oriental blue on the sapphires
Maroon moon, cranberry vampire
Diamonds dancing like a campfire
Thunderstorm Mercedes, out in Red Rock
I drop my top, smoking Lamborghini leg lock
Green bean diamond look like avocado, sweet pea
Pour a 3 in my Strawberry Kiwi
I 3 wheeled with the Cherokees
Weave through wigwams in the tipis
My pinky ring look like a lego block
Pull up at the Grammys in a helicopter

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Fuck one time, then I fuck her sister
Bitch give me neck and I don't even kiss her
Chains wrapped up make it feel like Twister
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Fuck one time, then I fuck her sister
Bitch give me neck and I don't even kiss her
Chains wrapped up make it feel like Twister
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
How that make you feel
