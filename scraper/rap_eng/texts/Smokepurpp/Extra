[Intro: Lil Tracy, SmokePurpp & Better Off Dead]
Bitch, I feel like Fish Narc
Ooh (Better Off Dead, nigga)

[Chorus: SmokePurpp]
Cash extra, checks extra (ooh, ah, ooh)
Walk around flexin' like a wrestler (whoa, ah, ah)
Go and drop the top in the Tesla (skrrt)
She gon' give me top in the Tesla (whoa, whoa, racks)
Cash extra, checks extra (whoa, *sniffle*)
Walk around flexin' like a wrestler (ah)
She gon' drop the top in the Tesla (whoa, whoa)
She gon' give me top in the Tesla (skrrt)

[Verse: Gab3 & SmokePurpp]
Water on my wrist, she was on to this (whoa, whoa)
Tryna hold my hand like, "Girl, you not my bitch" (yuh)
She keep tellin' me that I don't make no sense (don't make no sense)
I'm in the Beamer coupe, I'm 'bout to roll a spliff (whoa, yah)
Geekin' on the Adderall (adderall)
No, I don't care about the law (about the law)
These niggas hate on me, but I don't care at all (care at all)
Used to be broke, now I'm buyin' out the mall (out the mall)
Why that bih' keep callin' me? (whoa)
I'm faded buyin' more Gucci (bih')
She was lookin' for me, I was down the street (I was down the street)
Rollin' in that Benz, all like, "What the fuck you mean?" (yah, yah)

[Chorus: SmokePurpp]
Cash extra, checks extra (ooh, ah, ooh)
Walk around flexin' like a wrestler (whoa, ah, ah)
Go and drop the top in the Tesla (skrrt)
She gon' give me top in the Tesla (whoa, whoa, racks)
Cash extra, checks extra (whoa, *sniffle*)
Walk around flexin' like a wrestler (ah)
She gon' drop the top in the Tesla (whoa, whoa)
She gon' give me top in the Tesla (skrrt)
