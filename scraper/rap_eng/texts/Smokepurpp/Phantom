[Intro]
Huh?
Lil Purpp
Ayy, this shit sound Smokepurpp as fuck
Oh my god, Ronny

[Chorus]
Smokin' on a doink, can ya smell that?
Put a hundred bands in a duffle bag
Pulled up in a Ghost, where the roof at?
Gucci from my toe to my durag
Wock in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom (Huh?)
Wock in my Fanta (drank)
Lil' Purpp really got the bands up (Bih)
Lean in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom (lean, wock, wock, wock)
Wock in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom
Lean in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom
Lean in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom (lean)
Wock in the Fanta
Came in a two door Phantom

[Verse]
I don't want friends, I want Audi's
Your bitch, she givin' me toppy
Lil Purpp just came in a Masi
Bust down, just caught me a body
Young Purpp flex like a wrestler
Get the work straight from Mexico
Got a foreign bitch, do a lot of coke
And she countin' money by the peso
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Gucci Gang fuck twin sisters
When I get a check, yeah, they call me mister
Call Mary Kate, wanna fuck her sister
They like, damn, Smokepurpp, how you do that?
You just flow on a track and you kill that
And you thought you had the sauce but you spilled that
Put a hundred in the safe like at Chase Bank
Nigga, run up on me, see my bad side
Got a bad bitch and a backside
All this water on me like I'm baptized
They be switchin' gang, stay on that side
Bitch, I'm Lil Purpp, do a lot of fraud
I be road runnin', crack a lot of cards
Go to Saks Fifth, spend like thirty bands
Walkin' out of Gucci with a Louis bag

[Chorus]
Smokin' on a doink, can ya smell that?
Put a hundred bands in a duffle bag
Pulled up in a Ghost, where the roof at?
Gucci from my toe to my durag
Wock in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom
Wock in my Fanta
Lil' Purpp really got the bands up
Lean in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom
Wock in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom
Lean in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom
Lean in my Fanta
Came in a two-door Phantom (lean)
Wock in the Fanta (wock)
Came in a two-door Phantom (skrt)
