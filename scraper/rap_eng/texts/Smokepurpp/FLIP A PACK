[Hook]
Countin' up them racks, had to make it back
Feel like Bruce Lee how I flip a pack
Bust it on the scale for the cal-de-sac
Feel like Bruce Lee how I flip a pack
Countin' up them racks, had to make it back
Feel like Bruce Lee how I flip a pack
Bust it on the scale for the cal-de-sac
Feel like Bruce Lee how I flip a pack

[Verse]
Countin' up these racks
Got these pussy nigga's hating on me
You dont want no smoke
Make you tote, whatchu sayin' homie?
I should keep the ruga
Rock the '40, keep the burner on me
2 Glock, 3 Glock, K's like my name is Kony
Bust it up, bust it down like construction
Aye, Bitch I'm serving in the fuction
I'm a young nigga came from nothing
Out the mud I turned out nothing into something
Geek geek geek, off the wok, aye
Bitch I'm serving fiends on the block
SmokePurpp bitch you know how I rock
Keep the ruga keep the crack on my sock

[Hook]
Countin' up them racks, had to make it back
Feel like Bruce Lee how I flip a pack
Bust it on the scale for the cal-de-sac
Feel like Bruce Lee how I flip a pack
Countin' up them racks, had to make it back
Feel like Bruce Lee how I flip a pack
Bust it on the scale for the cal-de-sac
Feel like Bruce Lee how I flip a pack
