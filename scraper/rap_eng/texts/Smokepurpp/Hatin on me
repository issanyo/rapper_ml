Rockin with dj youngkash

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Ya, Ya, Aye
They hatin' on me (They hatin' on me)
They hatin' on me (They hatin' on me)
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one (I can't trust no one)
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one
They hatin' on me, they hatin' on me
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one
They hatin' on me, they hatin' on me
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one

[Verse 1: lil filth]
Thotty with a body, she gone ride like Kawasaki
She can call me filthy papi, and go pull up in the rarri, aye
Pull up on the kid, where the beef at?
I be with that loud pack, boof bag, I could put the roof back
Pussy on my mustache, I get everything that I must have
Plus that, I get packs gift wrapped
Big ass, big bag, I ain't gon' kiss that
I might just icey my wrist and pull up where your bitch at
In my soda, lean done filled my soda
She gon' give me brain like its NOVA its over, ya
Aye, aye, aye, ya'll be talking hella shit, aye
I just made your bitch my friend, now we got benefits
Aye, aye, aye, And I'm popping hella sticks
Aye, aye, aye, And im busting hella licks, aye

[Chorus]
They hatin' on me (They hatin' on me)
They hatin' on me (They hatin' on me)
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one (I can't trust no one)
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one
They hatin' on me, they hatin' on me
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one
They hatin' on me, they hatin' on me
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
I just poured a four inside my drank
I just mixed the water with the stank
You ain't got no guns, quit the act (quit the act)
All you nigga’s [?] talkers, ya’ll shoot blanks
I got the true in my jeans, these racks, they don't even fit in my jeans
She just wanna fuck on my team, she just wanna suck on my lean
I can’t stop, I can’t stop, it’s a habit (it’s a habit)
You get caught, then you better toss the ratchet
All these niggas, now they hate me, boy what’s happenin’
Now they hatin’ cuz Smokepurpp really has it, ya, ya
Aye, boof pack, smoking up the backwood
I be pumpin’ [?] like a strap would (like a strap would)
All you niggas fold like a notebook
Leave a nigga laying in the backwoods (backwood)

[Chorus]
They hatin' on me (They hatin' on me)
They hatin' on me (They hatin' on me)
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one (I can't trust no one)
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one
They hatin' on me, they hatin' on me
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one
They hatin' on me, they hatin' on me
I can't trust no one, I can't trust no one
