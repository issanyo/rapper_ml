[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Lil Purp bless your trap

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
I'm sleeping through the day, bitch I'm up at night
AK-47, headshot snipe
Lil bitch wanna ride me like a bike
Look at my diamonds they bite
Bite, molly Cali price
Moving with a pipe, a pop a lil' perc and I eat it like rice
Stand in the kitchen with a ho
Lil Purp bless your blow
Lil Purp bless your ho
Poured them up and go

[Pre-hook: Smokepurpp]
Shout out Yoppa
Geeking in the trap can't sleep
Butter ho butter my feet
To the ho, shoot her in the street

[Hook: Sweetsound and Smokepurpp]
I'm coming up, yeah
Had to hit my luck, yeah, what
I hit the Black Jack, what

She got a fat ass, I spin that fast stack
She like that, she make it bounce back
Yeah, bitch I'm on some drugs

[Post-hook: Smokepurpp]
And I can't sleep, look at these diamonds my teeth
You niggas is weak, bitch I'm ten toes deep

[Verse 1: Sweetsound]
Riding in that coup, flying through the booth
Racks are water proof, yeah
Mobilize my boots
Hot like Hawa shoes, eh
On a Xan or two, yeah

I treat Bonnie like the bando
Back it up and do it pronto
Take that work back to the condo
In the Bentley, on a Wednesday
On a rampage, on the fence, aye

Shout out Yoppa
Geeking in the trap can't sleep
Butter ho butter my feet
To the ho, shoot her in the street
