[Hook]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I told them bitches to go
I told them niggas they hoes
Chevy blades on fours
Real nigga won't fold
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I told them bitches to go
I told them niggas they hoes
Chevy blades on fours
Real nigga won't fold

[Verse 1: Key Nyata]
I heard that i'm falling off
I swear to god all you pussy niggas soft
All you do is talk
But can't walk the walk
You ain't wit it though
Pull up on me bro
Nigga you's a hoe
Everybody knows
I got OG's on go, nigga
Two bandz for the show nigga
I ain't even gonna go nigga
Rather count up all my chips
Rather just fuck on your bitch
She fell in love with the dick
She wanna fuck on my click (no way)
You dirty ass little bitch
Geeking of ten mollys
She just came out of her body
She sucking my dick in the party
Counting cheese that havarti
I had to do it i'm sorry
Nah i'm really not sorry
I was finnesin' lil shawty
I had to [?] shawty
But I had to let her go
My nigga sticking to the code
Don't give no fuck bout no hoe
Unless she hand me all the dough
When you come in this spot lock the door
We got choppas on the floor!

[Hook]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I told them bitches to go
I told them niggas they hoes
Chevy blades on fours
Real nigga won't fold
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I told them bitches to go
I told them niggas they hoes
Chevy blades on fours
Real nigga won't fold

[Verse 2: SmokePurpp]
Go, go, got my, pole
Go, go, clone that, dough
I got her booted up ass
I blow a one for my scratch
They know SmokePurpp be up next
Dodging these bitches like pack
No, no, I don't fold
These bitches they getting exposed
They know that I catch up [?]
Go, go, pour a, 4
Three hoes, of the, coke
Lean, lean, mix it with the bean
Truie on my jean
Racked up on my jeans
Lean, lean, mix it with the bean
Truie on my jean
Racks up on my jeans

[Hook]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I told them bitches to go

Chevy blades on fours
Real nigga won't fold
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I told them bitches to go
I told them niggas they hoes
Chevy blades on fours
Real nigga won't fold
