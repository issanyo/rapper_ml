[Intro]
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Huh?
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
I count big bucks, Oh my god, Ronny

[Verse 1]
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
We can get up, nigga, we can get up
Chopper leave a nigga doing sit-ups
That's yo' hoe? I fucked that bitch, she brought her sister
And I hit it 'til the mornin', then I dipped her
Yeah, dripped up, yeah, bitch, I'm Ricked up
100 bands at Neiman Marcus, nigga, catch up
All that fu shit on your neck gon' get you rashed up
Swear I'm flexin' on these niggas, bitch, I sauce
Niggas fallin' off the game, and I'm the cause
I swear to God these niggas pussy, menopause
You get no money, lil nigga, hold up, pause

[Chorus]
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked

[Verse 2]
Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, we just hit a stain
And I came with two pistols like I'm Max Payne
Six Os in my bank, I can't think the same
You got your mind around these bitches, we don't think the same
Damn, and I sip on Wok, Wok, Wok, Wok, Wok
Pop a perc, then I xan, then I drop
I just pulled up to my show to drop the top
Krispy Kreme, I'm doing donuts in the lot

[Chorus]
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
I count big bucks, keep a thing tucked
Lil Purpp!
