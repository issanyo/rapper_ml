[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
How you gon' trap with no strap?
Niggas can't trap in my trap
I can teach you how to trap
Wrappin' them bricks when I rap
I take your bitch to the house
Fuck her, I don't take her out
No I can't leave out the house
Fuck it, I'm gon' trap it out
How you call yourself a drug dealer?
You ain't never had a plug nigga
You sold drugs in the club nigga
Heard you trappin' out an oak nigga
You the type to get robbed nigga
Nah you don't want smoke nigga
I get it in by the pound nigga
Everything gotta go nigga

[Verse 1: ManMan Savage]
I started off with a crumb
I turned that shit to a bum
I was trappin' in the slums
I had one hand on my gun
12 pull up then we run
Stayed down 'til I'm up like the sun
Used to shoot at these niggas for fun
Ask the lord to have mercy on my soul
They'll teach you some lessons
Now I'm counting my blessings
I was living so reckless
Now I'm stacking like Texas
Having gas bags, pressure
Nigga hachoo, I'ma bless you
I got a whole lot of extras
Tryna take out, leave you on a stretcher
Every day I look in the mirror
See my future look clearer
Call me star and shit
They callin' me pioneer
They tellin' me that I'm poppin'
They like when I fuck up the profit
I stay with the hood just like Robin
I keep trappin' this shit, I won't stop it
All this money a nigga been pilling
Went and got a medallion
And I got me a stallion
Took at rip to the island
Ballin', got these niggas fouling
I was just a young nigga, so violent
I was ridin' 'round this motherfucker wilding
So I got in the booth, started freestyling

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
How you gon' trap with no strap?
Niggas can't trap in my trap
I can teach you how to trap
Wrappin' them bricks when I rap
I take your bitch to the house
Fuck her, I don't take her out
No I can't leave out the house
Fuck it, I'm gon' trap it out
How you call yourself a drug dealer?
You ain't never had a plug nigga
You sold drugs in the club nigga
Heard you trappin' out an oak nigga
You the type to get robbed nigga
Nah you don't want smoke nigga
I get it in by the pound nigga
Everything gotta go nigga

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Bitch I hang with the dealers and killers
And I don't give a fuck 'bout no nigga
It's Lil Purpp, I just ran up six figure
I got lean and designer my liver
Come to the hood, nigga push up
Chopper make a nigga do push ups
Nigga get up like a push pop
I don't need no more nigga, two shots
And that shit came out the boat
Fuck nigga don't want no smoke
Rifle it came with a scope
And it got titties but I need some more, yeah
I'm in the trap with a scale
These fuck niggas tellin' a tale
I just left the hood, made a sale
Just sent a pack through the mail

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
How you call yourself a drug dealer?
You ain't never had a plug nigga
You sold drugs in the club nigga
Heard you trappin' out an oak nigga
You the type to get robbed nigga
Nah you don't want smoke nigga
I get it in by the pound nigga
Everything gotta go nigga
How you gon' trap with no strap?
Niggas can't trap in my trap
I can teach you how to trap
Wrappin' them bricks when I rap
I take your bitch to the house
Fuck her, I don't take her out
No I can't leave out the house
Fuck it, I'm gon' trap it out
