[Intro]
Huh?

[Chorus]
Bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap

[Verse]
We could get into it, boy, what you waitin' for?
I got fours to pour
Os to smoke
Bitch, it's Lil Purpp, I might fuck your hoe
Diamond chain
Diamonds on my teeth, diamonds on my ring
For the gang
Bitch, it's Gucci Gang
And we blowin' brains
You can't see my eyes, I got designer frames
Pulled up in a foreign skirtin' everything
Off the lean like a kickstand, can't feel anything
Got a full clip, I'm bustin' everything
And I keep a choppa, bitch, I make it sing
Pulled up to the club, I'm throwin' everything
Pulled up on your brother, then I hit a stain
I need his weed, I need his Xans, I need his everything

[Chorus]
Bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
