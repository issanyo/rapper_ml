[Chorus]
Every night I'm on them drugs
I think I can't get enough
Every night I'm on them drugs
Pop a bean and going to the moon
To the moon
Every night I'm on them drugs
I think I can't get enough
Every night I'm on them drugs
Pop a bean and going to the moon
To the moon

[Verse 1]
To the moon
In a fast coupe like a kook
Baby in a 'Rari, it go zoom
Maybe if I die tonight, then I go to the moon
Off a bean, off a bean, I can't feel shit
I got bags, I got bags, I need 6 rings
Thousand dollars, thousand dollars on these new jeans
Got that chopper, got that chopper, make that bitch sing

[Chorus]
Every night I'm on them drugs
I think I can't get enough
Every night I'm on them drugs
Pop a bean and going to the moon
To the moon
Every night I'm on them drugs
I think I can't get enough
Every night I'm on them drugs
Pop a bean and going to the moon
To the moon

[Verse 2]
Watch me vroom
In a coupe
In some thousand-dollar shoes
Swervin' in a coupe
Maybe if I die tonight, then I go to the
I got hoes, I got hoes wanna fuck me
In a Audi, in a Audi, wanna truck me
She gon' suck me
She gon' suck me
Tell her suck me up and I'ma drink on that bubbly

[Chorus]
Every night I'm on them drugs
I think I can't get enough
Every night I'm on them drugs
Pop a bean and going to the moon
To the moon
Every night I'm on them drugs
I think I can't get enough
Every night I'm on them drugs
Pop a bean and going to the moon
To the moon
