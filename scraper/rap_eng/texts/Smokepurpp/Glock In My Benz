[Intro]
You dig? You dig?
You dig? You dig?
No such thing as friends

[Chorus]
I don't want no friends, I want no friends
Rather buy a Benz, don't want no friends
In my pockets: dead presidents
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends

[Verse 1]
Hit that bitch in a Lamb'
Tax a motherfucker, Uncle Sam
And I'm off the Xan, don't give a damn
When I'm in LA they pull out cams
G-G-Glock in my closet
Showed that bitch that Bar' and now she drippin' like a faucet
Before I kick in the door, bitch you know a nigga knockin'
AutoTune status, bitch you know that my shit knockin'
If you stealin' swag, I ain't gon' stop it
Ooh, see 'em in the streets and I might drop 'em
Keep that fuck nigga, keep away
You can see it in my fit, I'm gettin' paid
See me, you can't see me
I feel like John Cena on this CD
Lil Purpp Bless Your Trap, that's what the streets need
Don't owe a nigga shit cause you don't feed me

[Bridge]
And I pour the mud 'til I'm sleepy
Lil' bitch wanna touch on my pee pee
I'm a deadstar, rockstar
I'm a deadstar

[Chorus]
I don't want no friends, I want no friends
Rather buy a Benz, don't want no friends
In my pockets dead presidents
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends

[Verse 2]
Sweat, molly made me sweatin'
Yeah bitch I'm a star but I'm still dead
And I'm with my dawg just like a vet
Pull up at your trap and get it wet
Do-do-do it for my set
And I never talk to no feds
In LA I used to sleep with no bed
Now I'm a million dollar nigga in the jet
You digg? Slatt

[Chorus]
I don't want no friends, I want no friends
Rather buy a Benz, don't want no friends
In my pockets dead presidents
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
