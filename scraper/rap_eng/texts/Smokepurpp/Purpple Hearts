[Chorus: Lil Xan]
(Yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah)
Blood on his wrist
Heartbreaks lead to bloody fists
Blood in my mouth
Spit it all up in her mouth
I'm a freak, that like us
You so weak, got no hoes
I'm a beast, I'm a ghost
She want me, I want those
Purple heart, pink rose (ayy, yeah, yeah)
Purple heart, pink rose (brr, brr, brr, brr)

[Verse: Smokepurpp]
I sip, I sip lean overnight
I sip lean overnight
Pop a, pop a bean overnight
Still got demons tryna fight
Hit 120 on the dash (hit that, hit that)
Had to buy the coupe and ass
Uh, yeah, that bitch fast though
Yeah, had to put that on my bankroll
I sip, I sip lean every night
I sip lean every night
Pop a, pop a bean overnight
Still got demons tryna fight
Hit 120 on the dash (hit that, hit that)
Had to buy the coupe and ass
Uh, yeah, that bitch fast though
Yeah, had to put that on my bankroll

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
Blood on his wrist
Heartbreaks lead to bloody fists
Blood in my mouth
Spit it all up in her mouth
I'm a freak, that like us
You so weak, got no hoes
I'm a beast, I'm a ghost
She want me, I want those
Purple heart, pink rose (ayy, yeah, yeah)
Purple heart, pink rose (brr, brr, brr, brr)
