[Intro]
Hoodrich, Hoodrich, Hoodrich
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks
Look at my rim like six
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks
Look at my rim like six
Six rings, six rings, six rings, six rings

Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks
Look at my rim like six
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks
Look at my rim like six
Six rings, six rings, six rings, six rings

[Verse]
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks
Look at my rim like six
Remember I was bagging up nicks
Bagging up bricks keep blue hundreds like crip
Lil Water, hurricane wrist, hurricane bitch, hurricane .30 with a dick
Pull up on your block with a truck
Niggas get buck, and I keep a semi tucked
Glock .44 with the beam, fuck nigga know what I mean, fuck
Bitch I be serving the fiends, I turn your lil' brother to fiend, what, huh
I turn your lil' brother to fiend
I bet I be serving the clean M.O.B  all of my team
Niggas know I'm sippin' on the wok (Wok, wok, wok, wok, yo)
Niggas know I shut down your whole block, phew, phew, phew, hey
Pull up  to your hood I drop the top, I drop the top, hey
Pull up on your bitch, she dropped the top, huh, what

Standing in the kitchen with a bitch

Look at my rim like six
Six rings, six rings, six rings, six rings
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks
Look at my rim like six
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks
Look at my rim like six
Six rings, six rings, six rings, six rings
