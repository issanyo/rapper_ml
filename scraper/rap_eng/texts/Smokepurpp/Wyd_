[Hook]
Ok Smokepurpp, aye what you doin'
Ok Smokepurpp, aye what you doin'
Aye Lil Water, aye what you doin'
Aye what you doin'
Aye what you doin'
I get them bricks then I put them in the attic
The Glock is hot and nigga hotter then an attic
Attic, Attic
Attic, Attic
Ruger on me and he shootin' like an addict

[Verse 1]
Ok Smokepurpp, aye what you doin'
I got these licks and I'm bout to go stupid
They told me stay up out the streets and make the music
And now I do this shit, And now I do this shit
And now I do this and i mix it with water
And then I serve it to a dummy with no dollars
Aye what you doin'
Aye fuck you doin'
I put that pistol in his head and it's a throwaway
I fuck a bitch she off the dough and thats a doughaway
Aye what you doin'
Aye what you doin'
I'm a chef boy you know I love the stove
I'm a chef I be whippin' up the coke

[Hook]
Ok Smokepurpp, aye what you doin'
Ok Smokepurpp, aye what you doin'
Aye Lil Water, aye what you doin'
Aye what you doin'
Aye what you doin'
I get them bricks then I put them in the attic
The Glock is hot and nigga hotter then an attic
Attic, Attic
Attic, Attic
Ruger on me and he shootin' like an addict
