[Intro]
Lil Purpp bless yo trap
Ayy, skrt, ayy
Oh my God, Ronny!

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm a trap baby, niggas hate me
We got AR's, fuck a .380
On her face I spilled my babies
Pop out with them sticks, look like the navy
Lean lean Wok, lean lean wok, sleep like a baby
Wake up every morning, Glock, no safety
Dirty cup, in that bitch yeah that's my baby
Keep that fuck shit from 'round here, I'm bussin' daily

[Chorus]
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety

[Verse 2]
I'm a 90's baby, we don't go no safety
Choppa' very hefty, shootin' out the jet ski
Sippin' on drank, smokin' gelato it stank
Xannies, I get them in tanks
Free bands all over the bank

[Chorus]
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
