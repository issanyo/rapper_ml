[Verse 1]
Pockets they on jump
Cookie got me stuffed
Fuck that bitch one time and now she say that she in love
Give me face
In New York I caught a case
Did the race
Got a war in & outta state
I don't wanna [?] got this MAC here
I don't fuck with no one in the club I'm throwin' racks here
Try to play me on some work then you gon' die here
Toy that little yellow hoe come bring that ass here

[Hook]
Pockets they on jump
Luol Deng
Pockets they on jump
Luol Deng
Pockets they on jump
Luol Deng
Pockets they on jump
Luol Deng
