[Intro]
Yuh, lil purpp, yuh
All these diamonds on me
Diamonds dancin'

[Chorus]
Came in this bihh with a pistol
Came in this bihh with a missile
Came in this bihh with a pistol
Came in this bihh with a missile

[Verse 1]
Came in this bitch with some tissue
Wipe a bitch nose i got tissue
Got these bitches booted in the party
Got these bitches booted off the molly
Got these bitches touchin' on my body
Cause a nigga tatted on his body
Pull up on a nigga, catch a homi
Nigga looking for me, come and find me
Got that coca women, got that coca women
Bad bitches they with me
And I tore that semi
Pussy nigga you can't feel me
And I steal a pole, And I snuck yo hoe
Bitch we in the club, all about my dough
I'm throwin' the door, bitch go close that door
She gone suck my soul
She gone suck me till I fold
Got the Uber outside, that bitch going home
Look at all this gold, diamonds got me froze

[Chorus]
Came in this bihh with a pistol
Came in this bihh with a missile
Came in this bihh with a pistol
Came in this bihh with a missile
Came in this bihh with a pistol
Came in this bihh with a missile
Came in this bihh with a pistol
Came in this bihh with a missile
