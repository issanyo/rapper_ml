[Verse 1: Wifisfuneral]
Man I think it's safe to say that I'm the shit
Little bitch suck dick
I got about 12 bricks on my wrist, shit
Man, I'm still spending independent money
I don't give a fuck about no bitch shit, come get this
I'm drunk off of champagne, diamonds glistening
My left wrist going to kick it right up from the bitch, damn
I poured a 4 of chronic, smoking on that green crack
My diamonds kicking like they Lui Kang, boy that shit attack
I'm skrt'ing off right in that Audi screaming fuck 12
Compress them Xans then make them bands, that recipe I tell you
And if I die before I wake I pray I see a million
Need me bag so I run it up aye
Got me a check so I fuck it up aye
223 doing an uppercut aye
223 doing an uppercut aye
Off a percy in a uber truck
Big body getting super dome aye
I don't know what these lames do aye
You can not fuck with the crew aye
Bands on me that's what I do aye

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Fucking that bitch, I'm like ooh

Eat up that molly like fruit
Glaciers all over the stoop
Diamond flooded like the roof
Glock 45 in the coupe

You can't bang with me, I got mud just like a G

You can't bang with me, I got mud just like a G
