You say that you want my soul
I say, "Where the fuck would you go with it?"
You say that you want my soul
I say, "Where the fuck would you go with it?"

I'm no fool I swear, I'm no fool I swear
I'm no fool I swear, "Where would you go with it?"
I'm no fool I swear, I'm no fool I swear
I'm no fool I swear, "Where would you go with it?"

[Verse 1: Chaz French]
Yeah
I said lately I been plottin' like a fool
Tryna' figure it out, if this life is even for me
If this musics' what I'm really 'pposed to do
How come I don't trust nobody? Feel like they got it out for me
And they tell me I got so much shit to lose
Ha, I just don't feel like it, maybe I'm just in the moment
Feel like nothing's ever too good to be true
I'm too into myself to focus on you
I think I fell a victim to the vibe, victim to the high
Said it wasn't just the drugs, it was deep inside
I say it was more than love, it was suicide
Yeah cause I'm afraid to live, but don't wanna die
Man, I know what this can be, but am I qualified?
Better open up your eyes, gotta read the signs
If everything says yes, take advantage of it nigga
Don't you miss your opportunity, don't patronize, nah
Cause young nigga wanna have it all
White man don't wanna see us ball
For a little bit of fame and some change
He'd sell his old soul for the gold and a Range
And baby mama wanna see him fall
But he screamin' out, "Fuck 'em all!"
In his brand new whip, wit' his bitch
With his top down, screamin' out, "Money ain't a thang!"
Told mama, "Be cool, don't trip."
Yeah, cause one day we goin' all be rich
Wit' a couple houses in the hills, wit'out a bunch of record deals
Cause we ain't 'bout to owe these muh'fuckas shit
Yeah, but it tell that I gotta catch a grip
Cause it take a lil' longer when it's real
So, don't you ever give in nigga
Don't you ever fall victim to expectations
Don't let 'em test your will
You gotta stay true

[Hook: Saba]
You say that you want my soul
I say, "Where the fuck would you go with it?"
You say that you want my soul
I say, "Where the fuck would you go with it?"

I'm no fool I swear, I'm no fool I swear
I'm no fool I swear, "Where would you go with it?"
I'm no fool I swear, I'm no fool I swear
I'm no fool I swear, "Where would you go with it?"

[Verse 2: Chaz French]
Yeah
Imagine being a DC nigga that's never been to a go-go
Never a Northface, Foamposites was a no-no
Mama wasn't investin' in somethin' niggas would die for
Temple Hills livin', but Bay Ridge where we are though
Cause that's where we'd spend all of our Summers
When school was out though
They don't look up to rappers, hood niggas are the heroes
Some niggas really from there, some claim it cause of they kinfolk
Some niggas really born there, won't call another place home
Young nigga on a rise and they look at us different
They say all I talk is the struggle, when I really was in it
No more dwellin', movin' forward for the kids in the city
Who won't dream big enough, cause they goin' get shot down
Gotta own it, gotta speak it, know that there's power in words
Just put actions behind your thoughts
Don't let 'em take your crown
But don't you ever give in nigga
Don't you ever fall victim to expectations
Don't let 'em test your will
You gotta stay true!

I'm no fool I swear, I'm no fool I swear
