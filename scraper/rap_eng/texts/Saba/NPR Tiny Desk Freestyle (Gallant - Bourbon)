Some guys might say what you can't do
But I say that it ain't true
There's a god and an angel
In the light of an artist I might paint you
They got thoughts but it ain't food
I know life is a painful place
And the same fools hatin' will be the ones
With a similar path than the same one you've taken

Before a little bit I can't stay but
I gotta make the most of my time
Focused and grind because the whole city dyin'
And I ain't never have the good but I'm tryin'
And I've tried
And I advise
Live to stop the liar
Like a visor block the shine and
Let the light and truth be told a Michael Tyson
And remember and ta ta

Get a bit discouraged
Or maybe that was misworded
Or let it be misquoted
But I feel like insertin'
That I walk forward like toward the Lord
And lead them all like tutorials
Like Toro y Moi the Causers of This all is life
And that shit's hard

Still fuck what the naysayer may say
I'm on stage in the Bay hit the nae nae
Serious like the radio can't say
I got change I will make it one day
But talking about my a.k.a. is the greatest
I don't give a fuck 'bout an alias
I human, I homo sapien
Makin' the best of my situation
