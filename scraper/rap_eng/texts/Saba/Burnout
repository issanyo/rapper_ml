[Verse 1: Saba]
My grandad adamant about Adam and evil
How after the show in the back it's a Katt Stacks dyin' to meet you
I wanna rap with the Beatles, I just wanna rap like the Beatles
On the road to success caught a detour, picture me tourin' in England
I got stranded in Englewood outside of this chick's house
And since then I ain't ever really been south
Bench press bird shit, chess nerd kiss ass your distanced
From the rest of the world it's hardly normal, I only party formal
I'm on mute with no remote, so I don't talk much
And the land is lawless like they theme music on cassette
Yellow tapes say caution caucus I owe a lot to it though
Seen a guy on a bus ride, he'll probably die doin' dope
Seen a group of girls and they were callin' on the Lord, like may he be witch you
In Armageddon I'mma be a nigga with a sword, like Mace Windu
Bullet, went through they window, like that was a close call so
What if it's your fault, do-do-don't let them catch you sleep and doze off

[Hook: Eryn Allen Kane]
Hey universe, don't come at me with your bullshit
Your nonsense, your issues, can't handle it
These problems keep me up at night
But in the end there just problems and everybody got some, right?
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
I'm right here, we burnup
Pull the windows down and roll out

[Verse 2: Saba]
Crashin' cars like burnout, I got burnout
So I dropped out, see I turned out okay
On the Holy Bible told a lie to teachers in the twelfth grade
On my entrance essay, I just want to live, find a college to attend
Get a pup and picket fence, stop the choosin' and just pick
In my head I keep a pic with a fist on the end
I got homies in the low, a momma on a hundred and something
I'm hella out west though, where the buses stop runnin' early
I used to run home, I was scared to walk, people bled at dark
It's funny we play with chalk, and then lay in chalk
Foreshadow the shadows, it's more cattle for tattles
It's beef or snakes with the rattle, they tryin' to dethrone your castle
I call it like a sportscaster with stats on tally and tackles
I told this lie for a white whore who thinks I'm a statistic
Bitch you hate your job, so fuck your condescendant, I got common sense
You got passed up like a close call, don't let them catch you sleep and doze off

[Hook: Eryn Allen Kane]
Hey universe, don't come at me with your bullshit
Your nonsense, your issues, can't handle it
These problems keep me up at night
But in the end there just problems and everybody got some, right?
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
I'm right here, we burnup
Pull the windows down and roll out

[Outro: Saba & Eryn Allen Kane]
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies show me love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies show me love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood
