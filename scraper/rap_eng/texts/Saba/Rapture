[Verse 1: Martin $ky]
Yo
Hotter than pots, rocking the socks
With weed leaves on top with my hat cocked to the back
Bag full of my essentials for the traveling
Headphones, laptop, I keep that notepad with me
Uh
Flake when nobody heard of me
Hope you getting in but now you're sitting where the curb would be
Keep dribbling words, my flow permanent swerve
Gawd they getting fed up with what your serving them
Uh
And as the plot thickens I be rolling up a dub and watching robot chicken
Putting out them records
Hope them record labels listening
They label me incredible, and reckless, my incision's pretty deep
But these types of songs is what they need in fact
Hope you really trying to think it when you proceed to rap
Fire from the infinite abyss of lyrics
Listen to them critics, they like crickets
I ain't trying to hear it

[Hook: Martin $ky]
It's the sinister word scribbling villain
With out of this world audio
The mass is really feeling this, shit
Top of the mountain, high as [?]
This rapper with the manifest, and I ain't did my damage yet
Rapture the youth with a flow venomous
Motives as low as ditches, with acid trips I'm indigenous
First spitter with genuine cold lyrics
I'm sitting in booths, killing with literal raps, feeling it

[Verse 2: Martin $ky]
Altered the anatomy you used to
Make a simple beat with your fruit loops, and do you
Chunk the deuce, Myspace all up in your view
Who is that cat killing these raps better than you do
This that golden era real type shit
Flyer than the high, it's from the spliff that I lit
In-inhale, soaring to the moon where I reside
Here's a molly and a blue pill which one you wanna try
My nigga
The consequences clear if you got common sense
Chewing on these ramen noodles with the crew I came with
That's no one, did it on my own fucking lonesome
Had plenty of buds, random niggas tryna hold some
Stoned then this is rapping, this the genesis chapter
Hitting a [?] and you hear what's coming after
Figure I would rap a lot and worry about the beats less
Rather play with words cause all this poetry relieving stress

[Hook: Martin $ky]
It's the sinister word scribbling villain
With out of this world audio
The mass is really feeling this, shit
Top of the mountain, high as [?]
This rapper with the manifest, and I ain't did my damage yet
Rapture the youth with a flow venomous
Motives as low as ditches, with acid trips I'm indigenous
First spitter with genuine cold lyrics
I'm sitting in booths, killing with literal raps, feeling it
