[Verse 1: Ursa]
Chicago stand up
Boutta make this history
Lookin back a year from now, just another hit for me
Boutta crash the market, while my stock is tripling
Since I gotta buzz, this life is far beyond infinity (and beyond)
Knew that I was born for this, I can tell by how you feelin it
Stuck with my people, nothin fake, I'm the realest
Anything can happen, this is the future, I'm seein it
See what you want and I'm being it
Wayne with the tapes, no ceilings, bitch (Ursa)
Boutta blow the roof off
Red hot like I'm Rudolph
5"6, but I stand tall
In this, but I'm too gone
Boutta be as great as Snoop Dogg
Dre, Slim, K-Dot
Ye, Jay, Drake, Big, 2Pac, and I'm gonna be the new one
Along with Cub, King, and Saba
We makin it happen with rappin
When I die the game'll be famished
I'm down for the ride, my seatbelt unfastened
Burnin these books into ashes
Cuz I'll be the rapper they speak of to kiddies in history classes
This shit'll be classic

[Hook: Ursa]
Now we're makin history
I made the right moves, and gave the world what was left of me
The best of me
Man, I'd die for this shit, like rest in peace
And now we're makin history
Ah, yeah
It was meant to be
The team they'll be remembering
So
Now we're makin history (woop)
And now we're makin history
The whole damn team, you know we're makin history
Yeah, you know we're makin history

[Verse 2: Cub-J]
You can find me if you wanna, you can find me if you look, find me murking all these verses, you can find me on the hook
You can find me on the Internet or find me in the club, in a couple hundred years you'll probably find me in the books
Now I'm talkin history, ballin like I'm pistol Pete, gotta be transcendent because time's a penitentiary
That's why I do this now that's why I don't fuck with eventually
This shit gon be the death of me but Ima live forever
See I'm pedaling just pedaling and I ain't talking bicycle, I'm talking Thomas Jefferson my diamonds look like icicles
And I of course am on a course to take me out this life and go, places, outer spaces that I never thought that I could go
And nothing's holding me back, I've been on a roll with these tracks, I got no time to relax, if I'm tryna put it on wax, then I gotta do it right now, I could never put the mic down, and with everything I write down, I've been puttin on for my town

[Hook: Ursa]
Now we're makin history
I made the right moves, and gave the world what was left of me
The best of me
Man, I'd die for this shit, like rest in peace
And now we're makin history
Ah, yeah
It was meant to be
The team they'll be remembering
So
Now we're makin history (woop)
And now we're makin history
The whole damn team, you know we're makin history
Yeah, you know we're makin history

[Bridge: Michael King]
Got the fire burnin, tires turnin
Rollin Cali, smokin Cali, live it up
And you know we on the road
I just hope you ain't been thinkin bout me differently
Oh, girl I hope that you been missin me
Oh
We all in our lane
We been doin our thang
So at the end of the day
That's just history, baby

[Verse 3: Saba]
Out my city like deported, I history in my story
Out the park like bases loaded, like the tortoise they were slow
I’m just honest, I can not help but to feel like imma blow
Shout my city, shout my team, I couldn’t do it on my own
I can die today, just like a legend, how I’m living on
I can’t tolerate no disrespect, you talk you gotta go
Like the rock against the ropes, I’m Ibaka in the post
Like Curry at Oracle, boy we historical
Out my city like deported, I history in my story
Out the park like bases loaded, like the tortoise they were slow
I’m just honest, I can not help but to feel like imma blow
Shout my city, shout my team, I couldn’t do it on my own
I can die today, just like a legend, how I’m living on
I can’t tolerate no disrespect, you talk you gotta go
Like the rock against the ropes, I’m Ibaka in the post
Like Curry at Oracle, boy we historical
