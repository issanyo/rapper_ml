[Verse 1]
Ah Another one of those nights
You know the ones when your eyes don’t close at all
I just got done recording
And this girl want me over
But my grade can’t afford it
So I’ll pass so I can pass
Just last week seven hours of sleep
And that was in total
They party hard and hardly nod
And they yell out YOLO
Ha, but man I hope the next day don’t stress me
But I swear to God if my teacher test me

[HOOK: Saba]
(Contains sample from Juicy J "We Trippy")
I’ll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
You know I’ll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
Cuz I don’t sleep
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
No I don’t sleep
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
So I’ll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
You Know I’ll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
Cuz I can’t sleep
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
No I can’t sleep
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so)

[Verse 2]
Ah
My to-do list is like an encyclopedia
I need something to keep me up, for real
Cuz Red Bull no longer gives me wings
And mommy sings me lullabies and they don’t put me to sleep
It’s time for bed, my eyes are red
And low, so why don’t you go?
I’m like I got a show
And all my dreams no longer real to me
So that pill just appeal to me
At any given time though, I’d rather be up than sleep
So I’ll be

[HOOK]

My phone ring (phone ring)
And I’m ignoring all my calls (all my calls)
Only hit me up you got Adderall (Adderall)
Got a 30 page paper due next week (next week)
So I’m like F sleep

[HOOK]
