[Verse 1: Saba]
Yellin' at my mother like, "I know you hear me"
Get a little closer, repeat
Bus driver pass me up, don't see me
Paramedics talk about what he need
He need his oxygen, they seem incompetent, I see the consequence
I walk when I can't hear them, they're inaudible
I got up like I gotta go, forensics search for follicle
I promise y'all I'm not a ghost, I promise y'all
Look, there's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around

[Chorus: Saba and Daoud]
No, I can't feel your pain, but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around
No, I can't feel your pain, but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven

[Verse 2: Saba]
Yellin' at my brothers like, "I know that I'm here"
Regardless of how loud, they don't hear
Walkin' through the crowd, they shed tears
I know I did not disappear
Uphill I'm battlin', I see the cameraman
I see the news station's truck parked outside
It's every channel here
Yeah, interview, interview, interview, cut
Someone just bled out because they got (Cut!)
Chalk outline look like the shape of my shadow
Hand go right through the wall if I try to touch
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven, heaven, heaven

[Chorus: Saba and Daoud]
No, I can't feel your pain, but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around
No, I can't feel your pain, but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven all around me
There's heaven all around me, there's heaven

[Outro: Daoud]
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do, do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
