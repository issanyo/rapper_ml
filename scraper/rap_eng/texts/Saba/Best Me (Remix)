[Verse 1: Saba]
Apologies in advance, Mobbing Deep with the clan
290 to Dan, riotmen in my class
Beatboxin', Basquiat dreadlockin'
The nerdy kid, he stuffed in lockers
Tell em' be cool like a lozenge
Niggas see you with the flodging
They ready to pull your card, like uno out
I could tell you, but this shit you know 'bout
I'm talking 17 I thought I was the, told the, coldest
Skipping class, get my ass a phone and office
Left my job and gave they ass a one week notice
Back at home I feel I'm Macaulay Culkin
Knew this shit was good like I am Kobe, postin'
Never left the luck, I got a four leaf clover
Paranoid as when them boys will pull me over
Stackin' up my paper like a loose leaf owner
See me on Cobra, I felt like the culprit
None of they shit come down, treat me like a toilet
Tomahawk  a hook and I 360 with the verses
Soldier like the service, bus like I got service
All they lines down, I'm around and they nervous
Reachin' on the ground like the carpet, persian
I come from a town where the topic: murder
I feel like the crown on my conscious, curvin' it
News like I'm Burgundy, hurtin' me so
Worth to be perfectly hurt me and mo'
His sound it might sell, if I ain't never grow
I didn't fold when a label approach
Lay down a lay, it's a-rest like Joes
Stay in your lane like you payin' a toll
Hate cause they ain't gonna pay what they owe
Snakes in the grass, put the apes in the zoo
Gorilla readin' corinthian callin' you realest like Christopher callin them Indian
This is not that
Presidential I should get a top-hat off experience
Quiet like librarian, how they all silent around
I'm like that guy in the town
Die for the crown
I keep my ear to the street
I keep my eye to the clouds

[Hook: Sylvan LaCue]
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me, best me possibly

[Verse 2: Sylvan LaCue]
Upset drunk on a cold night
Should stop now but I won't lie
Nigga I remember those days when I used to have no lights (no lights)
That was back when... That was back when...
Back when it was nothin' but a dream
Food drive service, black churches kept my mother cookin' daily dinner, breakfast, even lunches for the team
Pulled me to the side, told me she was savin' up a bucket full of green
Hush plans boy, nothin's for the scene
Get up off your ass and follow your passion
Motivated from moments then it's back to the mattress
Work patches back to back, me god be tragic
All these asses, rack up thoughts, wreak havoc
You, you follow the rules
Develop misunderstandin' then swallow your jewels
Dependin' on model theres never model your uniqueness, deep kiss the way you bottle your cool
I remember the school high
Ridiculous new ideas to my peers, fear you must be a musha
Martin look wrist boy better woosa!
My niggas reflectin' images [?]
Lord, I've been at task I ask my last request on earth is not to let my selfish way shine through
Don't believe in karma, only God but I know what goes round comes right back round for you
Can I get a church?
1995 and 97 was the worst
Started writin' to escape but I was livin' on a verse
Only lookin' forward to the fifteen and the first
Told my niggas I don't want to hit a forty with a forty in front of bodegas incarcerated or in a herse
Systematically envisioned to imprison me in dirt
By the age of 27 I'm just tryna dead a curse
15 I had a vivid conversation with myself
And said self you can either kill you or kill a verse
Now my verses have verses in burials
Scriptures and carols through me when I'm blessed
And I am my best me

[Hook: Sylvan LaCue]
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me, best me possibly
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me
All I wanna do is be the best me, best me possibly
