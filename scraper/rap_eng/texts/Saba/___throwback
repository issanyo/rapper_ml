[Verse 1: Pell]
I told her to drive over in her new whip
Bring some friend she cool with
I'm gone play this Yeezy like we did when life was easy
She say "I'm too high to move it”
But there's hella goose here
And plus I got that Weezy
We can 500 degrees it
This that throwback, throwback, throwback
This might be a throwback
She want ride like horses
She must think I'm bojack
Way it keeps on dropping, must want me to hold that
Started catching more than feelings but an L I can't afford that

[Pre-Chorus]
(This that)
Top down rolling with nowhere to go
Laid back, all the time in the world
Play that, when you need to feed your soul
Ahhhh

[Chorus]
This that, this that throwback, throwback, throwback
This might be a throwback
She want ride like horses
She must think I'm bojack
Way it keeps on dropping, must want me to hold that
Started catching more than feelings but an L I can't afford that

[Verse 2: Pell]
Showing that P-I-E
But you know ain't a damn thing sweet
And a cookie can't pay my lease
Give me clarity hd
And let it all fall like autumn leaves
I oughta be
Putting in work
But distractions they came with curves
Still taking that u-turn
As long as your heels swerve
9 inches outside the party you saw me and then this started
Georgia peach started moving dim all of the lights please
Not questioning where we headed this boat is already sailing
Avoiding intimidation, follow where vibes lead

[Pre-Chorus]
(This that)
Top down rolling with nowhere to go
Laid back, all the time in the world
Play that, when you need to feed your soul
Ahhhh

[Chorus]
This that throwback, throwback, throwback
This might be a throwback
She want ride like horses
She must think I'm bojack
Way it keeps on dropping, must want me to hold that
Started catching more than feelings but an L I can't afford that

[Verse 3: Saba]
Yeah yeah, ay, throwback
You left town, and drove back
To throwback, the low back, I seent you from the door like door mat
I sent you in the phone, you wrote back (I mean)
We could take it back like boom-bap
But the teachers, who in your old class
They keep asking you where your phone at
Took your motorola razr, with whole family on your Facebook
I’m in your top 3 on your Myspace, customizing how your page look
So I say pimp your page, and pimp your age
But this shit dangerous, i’m playing this
OJ in retro J’s I’m in throwback like retrograde

Chorus (x2)
This that throwback, throwback, throwback
This might be a throwback
She want ride like horses
She must think I'm bojack
Way it keeps on dropping, must want me to hold that
Started catching more than feelings but an L I can't afford that
