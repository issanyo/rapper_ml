[Verse 1: Saba]
Can you cross the street without crossfire
Skidmarks under car tires
All my neighbours they call prayers
Other side of the barbed wire
I'll watch from my porch
'Till it's dark out and the vampires
Eating alive the damn sirens
We watch the game like umpires
Stray like a stray dog from what they are
Fight in a park
Left the battlefield without a scar
Run from a cop when the vapor clears
Work hard hoping that it pay off in the end
But you ain't sure
It's the crash course, but you ain't insured, 'cause you can't talk

[Chorus: Stephen]
Heaven if you sent us down
So we can build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother and every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfire
That's caught in the crossfire

[Verse 2: Ravyn Lenae]
Smile a little more when you're awake
They won't see us shake
Heaven waits on Earth when we obey
Let us say our grace
Baby boy and baby girl (girl)
Take control, this is your world (world)
Tiny hands, they move with love
We are yet the best to come

[Outro: Stephen]
We are yet the best to come
Through the worst, we rise above
Pain is what we blossom from
Show the man we're looking up, up
Doesn't matter who you love
Doesn't matter where you're from
This is not a place for some
We're the same, so it's all or none
