[Hook]
I ain't got no job
Young nigga, I ain't got no job
I trade a 401K for an AK
Cause when my vitals stop
Grind don't stop
The grind won't stop when my vitals stop
Mind on plot, so I don't talk
Trade a lifelong girl for a thot

[Bridge]
Marathon, that's 4K
Some niggas sold they self for just 4K
I trade a 401K for an AK
And bet I'm not hungry the next day
They told my little homie "Crime pay"

[Verse 1]
And he got scolded the next day
He on parole for the next few
He older with the same case
Earned his stripes like he signed with Adidas
Trade a W9 for a .9 millimeter
All my niggas did time, and got beat up
But I was never street enough to grow up and be a thug
Because I went to school everyday
I went to school everyday
Learned shit don't matter, niggas shoot everyday
I had a 3.9 that shit didn't matter
What's a 401k?

[Hook]
Young nigga, I ain't got no job
I trade a 401k for a AK
Cause when my vitals stop
The grind don't stop
The grind won't stop 'cause when my vitals stop
Mind on plot, so I don't talk
Trade a lifelong girl for a thot, yap

[Bridge]
Marathon, that's 4k
Some niggas sold they self for just 4k
I trade a 401k for a AK
And bet I'm not hungry the next day

[Verse 2]
GPA don't estimate shit
Money you make, not your class average
Cause niggas was so broke they couldn't afford schooling
How all them niggas get rich? (rich)
It seems like everybody trying to get a hold of me
But little do they know I'm barely holding like rosary
Before I'll be the success story I'm supposed to be
I'll probably end up on the news just so I eat
If I commit a crime would you love me still?
A refill if I'm empty, drugs hella temptin'
My girl just left me, told her I'm empty
Tell her Iâ€™m pimpin', her friend look temptin'

[Hook]
'Cause I ain't go no job
Young nigga, I ain't got no job
I trade a 401k for a AK
Cause when my vitals stop
The grind don't stop
The grind won't stop 'cause when my vitals stop
Mind on plot, so I don't talk
Trade a lifelong girl for a thot, yap

[Outro]
It's niggas trading shots over blocks
I'd rather trade blocks for some stock
I knew a homeless man stayed on my block
He'll trade everything he got for a rock
Fuck it I can not starve
Fuck it I can not starve
I'll trade an A&R for an AR
Cause fuck it I cannot starve
