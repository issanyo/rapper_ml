[Hook: Mfn Melo]
Lately I've been working with this clock on me
Holdin' on the minutes till they fossil me
Lately I've been thinking 'bout the [?]
But that's crazy
I've been thinking lately (oh time)
Lately I've been working like 2Pac on me
Strictly for my niggas and my mama, them
Lately seem like trouble doesn't follow them
But that's crazy
I've been thinking lately

[Verse 1: Mfn Melo]
Lately I've been thinking 'bout my future
Pass on that A1, [?]
Off gas with the day-1s, loud thoughts-booster
Morale down the isle, I'll be married to the mula
Send message to medulla oblongata
I'm the ruler how I got them
Tryna measure up, dick and get my treasures up
Jack Sparrow, rap pharaoh
Never let the people go, sea red
Partin' all that bullshit and evil though
Keep it low
Father told me that and Imma keep it so
Dont' really fuck with him but that's a gift
A lot a' niggas won't receive it though
Embracing blessings as they tumble
I just feel so good
Slice a humble pass out glass a bitch
I knew it

[Hook: Mfn Melo]
Lately I've been working with this clock on me
Holdin' on the minutes till they fossil me

But that's crazy
I've been thinking lately (oh time)
Lately I've been working like 2Pac on me
Strictly for my niggas and my mama, them
Lately seem like trouble doesn't follow them
But that's crazy
I've been thinking lately

[Verse 2: Mfn Melo]
Lately l've been livin' in the present day, no hesitate
Iso crossover, asses levitate
No Kennedy or running mate
Presidentials hunting me
Like how the fuck I'm gonna mate
Here's some rules I'm gonna break
All about the knowledge but it's fuck school like I'm on a break
Not given law so gonna take, iniative
Fishy legs
Visions of that wave in the distances
They gonna hate, but mama love
I don't give a fornicate, she kinda does
That's the kinda law that's gon' get our ass all kinda stuff
Provide for my provider
Don't oppose to this, a role switch
Doctor Jekyll on the hide, glitter mind ferocious
Animal all inside, mama raised no bitch

[Verse 3: Saba]
Lately I'm not 'oh shit'
I'm just focused
I just grind like I got focus
Even when I'm doing good I could be coastin'
I know as of late the coast in closer
In that lay my coast in [?]
Brimming but when the grey hounded i think I'm close to toaster
Toast to all workin' underdogs
I'm sure they then don' it all
Flip or take, that's a somersault
Nigga, on my soul, I am on my soles
With a summer playlist, tonne of haters
I don' lost count, it's a bunch of y'all
But Imma still spread love
I fuck wit' y'all
I'm like fucking lost
I'm living to worry-free to let a dollar worry me
Bitch, I think I'm Hercules
The realest one they ever seen
Opportunity, it knock my door open with urgency
Melo, that's a brother, we been that way since I was a teen

[Outro: Mfn Melo]
And lately I've
Been thinking bout the future
Still ain't nothing changed, baby beat again
Always a claim to be better (always a claim)
We'll fly the fame like a feather (we'll fly the fame)
And lately I've
Been thinking bout the future
Still ain't nothing changed, baby beat again
Always a claim to be better (always a claim)
We'll fly the fame like a feather (always a claim to be better)
