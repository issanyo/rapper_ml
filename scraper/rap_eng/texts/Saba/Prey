[Verse 1: Cory Miller]
This shit that I wrote last night
Almost got me killed
I ain't really trippin' off it I'm just tryna pay my bills
I ask myself is this right
Living all in this world
He made it one night
Same night that I lost my girl
But I'm on the mission while you pop prescription
Naw' I ain't trippin' but somethings missing
And I see you standing all in the kitchen
No Yo Gotti but you do the dishes, Yeah
You making wishes, you oh so dumb
Your time is up you had your run
My time is now I'm havin' fun
No Bang Bang Ion' need a gun

[Hook: Cory Miller]
Ion' need no one, Ion' need no one
Get the fuck outta here saying ya needing one
You own your own I'm on my own I'm more than done ion need no one. x2

[Verse 2: Cory Miller]
Riding down 40 when you used to be my shorty
But it wasn't enough so I had to find a new story
And I know that I'm oh so boring tried to make you happy but I have priorities
I don't know why you so worried, see
You paranoid bout the wrong things baby
I tried to be your man but we are both crazy
And I thought that we could do it but we both crazy
You say you wanna fix this right?
But we both think that we right
And I won't back down and neither will you
So we stuck in a never ending fight, God Damn!
And I fucked up and left before but I had to go and I did it again I feel just as low
One thing I can't let go you thought I never loved you like you just a ho
But you was spiteful and I hated it no debating it homies relatin it
But in the same way I loved it and love you but we can't work and I'm so through
Sick of hearing all the things I never do for you
Sick of all the quote bullshit I do
Sick of being tired, tired of not being inspired
Inspired to just go back to new

[Hook: Cory Miller]
Ion' need no one, Ion' need no one
Get the fuck outta here saying ya needing one
You own your own I'm on my own I'm more than done ion need no one. x2

[Outro: Cory Miller]
Ion' need no one, Ion' need no one
And that ain't nothing new, and that ain't nothing new
Said I'm independent, yeh
Don't need no help from you, uh'

Ion' need no one, Ion' no one
And that ain't nothing new, and that ain't nothing new
Said I'm independent
Don't need no help from you
