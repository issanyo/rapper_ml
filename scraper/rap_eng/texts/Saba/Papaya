[Intro]
Oh, aw

[Chorus: Saba]
I wanted you while you were
With your guy but that beside the point
The fruits of the labor, papaya
One day we'll split the pie up and maybe enjoy (Aw)
Your brown skin turns blue, under the moon
You know I don’t smoke, but you'd fire the joint
I just want to chill (Chill), with you
I ain't got shit to do, I was hopin’ you'd join (Aw)

[Post-Chorus: DaedaePIVOT]
Money that don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)
Money that don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)

[Verse 1: Saba]
I said that just my baby babe
While the clock go tick, flavor flay
Back when they offered me pay to play
Like, look at this long way we came
Some of the greatest turn Jay and Dame
And they split when the seasons change
But I know it won't be that way
If ever I see the day you by my side like a edible
I see you in my peripheral
Heart beat I don't need no stethoscope
I'm tellin' you shit I ain’t never told no one
I know you know me very well
"In love" you barely feel, before most times I’m fairly sure
We'll end up in fairy tale
Tutorial, you’ll show me how
How can I not be with you?
Slide in the AM, kick it
Pinch me, I must be dreamin' still
If we gon' chill, I'm bending that corner, I’m spinnin' that wheel
You gon' come out when I text you, "I'm here"
Your boyfriend mad, now you here with the bill

[Chorus: Saba]
I wanted you while you were
With your guy but that beside the point
The fruits of the labor, papaya
One day we'll split the pie up and maybe enjoy (Aw)
Your brown skin turns blue, under the moon
You know I don't smoke, but you'd fire the joint
I just want to chill (Chill), with you
I ain't got shit to do, I was hopin' you'd join (Aw)

[Post-Chorus: DaedaePIVOT]
Money that don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)
Money that don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)

[Verse 2: Saba]
Ayy, but I hope she don't cat like Garfield when you get this invite
Love like gettin' hit with a semi
Don't judge too much with the pen, right
'Less you by my side, then it's alright
Had a few bros off of the insight
Know you dozed off after the midnight
I stayed up tryna wait for reply
You went to bed, you ain't even say goodnight (Hahaha)
But that's my baby, like I'm ballin' for, young dumb and broke
Ayy, said that's my baby, like I'ma claim her, like in that Maury show
Get that baby like on my way tonight, baby stay the night

[Chorus: Saba]
I wanted you while you were
With your guy but that beside the point
The fruits of the labor, papaya
One day we'll split the pie up and maybe enjoy
Your brown skin turns blue (Blue), under the moon (Moon)
You know I don't smoke, but you'd fire the joint
I just want to chill (Chill), with you
I ain't got shit to do, I was hopin' you'd join (Aw)

[Post-Chorus: DaedaePIVOT]
Money that don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)
Money that don't mean nothing (Mean nothing)
