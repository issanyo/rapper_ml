[Chorus: Saba]
The best song is probably on the B-side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
Disagree, Grey
The best song was probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine, grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest
In the game, grey, grey

[Verse 1: Saba]
Sometimes I think about the pressures of a artist
And what it takes to be called a
Success even with no college we barely even considered
Don't label me with them niggas, infatuation with plastic
I wanted it to be realer, first they wanted the hip-hop
And then they wanted guerilla and then they wanted drug dealer
And then they wanted a dancer now they want a drug addict
Infatuation with plastic, white girl want to be sister
Driver want to be walker and walker want to be sitter

[Chorus: Saba]
The best song is probably on the B-side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
Disagree, grey
The best song was probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine, grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest
In the game, grey, grey

[Verse 2: Saba]
Sometimes I think about the pressures of the label
And what it take to get paid for
Discoverin' art, they ain't no existed', I know it ain't yo
Intention to try and change me, multi-million, your children
Private school they attendin' an album sellin' what did it
I shuck and jive, a good nigga, split the pie and I'm silent
I'ma give you your single and you just give me the finance
"Saba, if it's so bad then, hey why the hell are they signin'?"
Cause sitter want to be walker and walker want to be drivin'

[Chorus: Saba]
The best song is probably on the B-side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
Disagree, grey
The best song was probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine, grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest
In the game, grey

[Verse 3: Saba]
Care for me carefully, back with more clarity
Back like consecutive
I told you motherfuckers like Oedipus
Heather B, Sway in the Morning
Painting that paint like a portrait
Action, I ain't for the talking
Ain't for the fame but the fortune cool
Alterin' the altitude
Offerin' the thought for food
Authoring that art that move, mm
Carefully editing every word
Everything got to be charity
Give it my all, these melodies therapy
I keep it thoroughly, PIVOT the legacy
How could you not be moved?
I don't give them an option to, mm
Don't nobody want to be great
Everybody want to be seen
And nobody want to be quiet

Everything is (Grey!)
Everything is (Grey!), everything is (Grey!)
Everything is (Grey!), mm
Care for me carefully, back with more clarity
Back like consecutive, I told you, look
Everything is grey, everything is grey
Everything is grey, everything
