[Intro: Saba]
Ah, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, hahaha
Yeah, yeah, aye, aye
Yeah...

[Verse 1: Saba]
Pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Use to dream about it when my cousin had a cutlass
We were making moves, 19 with the shwoop
Hit up Jay Caves, turned it to a video, aye
Riding with the windows up because my shit is broke, just like we were broke
Coppers tryna impound vehicle, we all see ‘em though
Aye, Squeaky had a Buick he would play our latest music, aye
I just backseat drive, catch the vibes, in a hooptie, aye
I don’t got a crib but I tell my lady move it, aye
She would take her sister car then someone crashed into her, aye
Yeah, I still wish it
And if it breakdown then I’m getting out and pushin'
Aye, me and Walt was on the E way and we blew the trans
Now I’m on the train, like ehe, damn
Yeah, tryna finesse Uber with a new email
"Aye, Saba, love your story, man, do please tell"

[Hook: Saba]
Aye, pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie 'till the next thing coming
I'ma pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie 'till the next thing coming, aye

[Verse 2: Saba]
Kobe whipped a station wagon and he hotbox that bih’
He'll pick me up from school, "Nephew, hop in."
Came home straight skunk like I know my mama mad, aye
Still don’t smoke but I smell like my friends
All my nigga day one like they just got the job
Never bought a train card, but bet they will train hop
Aye, aye, aye, major key, tell them take a seat
Yeah, I just bought a hooptie I can get from A to B
Yeah, wasn't ally swoopin, had to stop with Casa B
Yeah, wildin' with my brother Waters, can’t wait till he free
Yeah, this shit sound like CTA, my new shit coming TBA
Remember they ain’t show no love, now it’s only PDA
Yeah, that's as it stands
I just got my L’s, now I whip a minivan
Aye, high school in the ‘burb but I’m still a city man
Aye, screaming Pivot loud as fuck ‘cause that is really fam

[Hook: Saba]
Pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie till the next thing coming
I'ma pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie till the next thing coming, aye

[Outro: Phoelix & BJRKNC]
There are so many reasons to live alone
There is only one reason to die for you
When I'm away, know my heart, it shows
And through Jerusalem will I ride for you
