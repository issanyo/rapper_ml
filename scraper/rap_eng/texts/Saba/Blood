[Intro: Saba]
Uh
Yeah, yeah
Ayy
Yeah, ayy (ayy)

[Chorus: Saba]
This Pivot shit realer than blood
I'm sending the temperature up
Said 15 minutes of fame, I spent 14 at the bank
It’s Pivot Gang if it a dub, rest y'all pretty much suck
My niggas is really my blood, your 15 minutes is up

[Verse 1: Joseph Chilliams]
Pivot Gang, y'all don’t know who he is (Who?)
Dick clean like I'm Jesus
You know me, I'm cute and I'm slim thick (Yeah)
I could work in Victoria's Secret
Level up like Pokemon, got my hood like Obi-wan
24 hours not enough, y'know I ate like Kobe Bryant
Baby slow wine (Why?), cause a ripple in time
Just like Janet Jackson, got her nipples on my mind, yeah
Act a fool like Goldie Hawn, Buzz Lightyear, I go beyond
In the hood like a closing sign, cute as fuck, I'm over fine
Niggas think I got a clothing line
Like Future, I don't need no designer
And my whole life I followed in J.Lo footsteps
I’m tryna grow behind her
In my gang, we don’t know designer
Move the whites like Pocahontas
Harry Potter in that invisible cloak
Y'all don’t even know where to find us

[Chorus: Saba]
This Pivot shit realer than blood
I'm sending the temperature up
Said 15 minutes of fame, I spent 14 at the bank
It's Pivot Gang if it a dub, rest y'all pretty much suck
My niggas is really my blood, your 15 minutes is up
(Ayy, ayy ayy)

[Verse 2: MFnMelo]
Fighting on my way up just like Solange
Me and bro gettin’ 'em on
Money talks, I croon, young Victor Mone
Mob with me like a pawn
Street smart, was in the house like Jerome
Gold tooth coming soon
OG but I'm young only with way more than I brung
Fuck 'em up! (fuck 'em up)
Drinking, pinky stuck 'em up (stuck 'em up)
Big leap like double dutch (double)
Big Jeep, that's a double dutch
Greatest uncle alive since Birdie died
Please tell me who you wit
Shaking lock while I lie
It's Hammer time, nail shit, too legit

[Chorus: Saba]
Ay, this Pivot shit realer than blood
I'm sending the temperature up
Said 15 minutes of fame, I spent 14 at the bank
It's Pivot Gang if it a dub, rest y'all pretty much suck
My niggas is really my blood, your 15 minutes is up

[Verse 3: FRSH Waters]
Jumpin' out from on the page
Throwin' these bows like Streets of Rage
All my niggas startin' fires
Burning down the barricade
Rebuilding gang, lead the ship
Free'd Chapo when he needed it
Keep guapo for the visa trips
And a change of clothes when the season switch
Plead the fifth, lead the whip
Parked outside if we need to dip
Pull 'round front, you can keep the 6
If it take too long, peep the lick
We gon' pull off dem street jackets
Lane to lane in that traffic
Bang the gang like a ratchet
Clappin', round-applause for this action

[Chorus: Saba]
Ay, this Pivot shit realer than blood
I'm sending the temperature up
Said 15 minutes of fame, I spent 14 at the bank
It's Pivot Gang if it a dub, rest y'all pretty much suck
My niggas is really my blood, your 15 minutes is up
