[Verse 1]
Turn a obstacle obsolete
Turn a cheek, poverty
Heritage, cotton seed
I could be lotta things, lottery winner
This album autobiography
I feel like Socrates
Hypothesis: opposites attract
Squares around the block again
Turn a obstacle obsolete
I believe I can fly, "R Kelly", awkwardly
Ain't really popular
Prolly 'cause they all doubted
But I was up while they slept
While they said I wouldn't amount to much
I was hit
I knew that if i ainâ€™t older
I turn a obstacle obsolete
Up the street where they bang, I ain't hang
Out the jam, wosp da bam
I'll pretend all our friends still alive
Still apply for the fall
Cap and gown, for the fail
Furthermore, first of all
Curtain call, shirt and tie
I'm a pallbearer
Turn a obstacle course to a porket
Weigh out a horse in a carriage
That wasn't in your inheritance
Splitting parts as we jumpin' offa the porch again
Portuguese, we don't speaks it
But poetry hopelessly hope
The Lord'll see when our dreams get torn
Apart
On the tar, left the kid, on your mark
Joan of Arc, genocide
Second time, Noah's Ark
Now you're dead, no one saw

[Hook]
When I'm dead, and I'm gone
Would you smile, coz you know
Where I've been, and gone?
When you're dead, and you're gone
Would I smile, coz I know
Where you've been?
When I'm dead, and I'm gone
Would you smile, coz you know
Where I've been, and gone?
When you're dead, and you're gone
Would I smile?

[Outro]
"My name's Will Fountain...
Three things off my bucket list:
One, I wanna have a meal from In-N-Out, 'cause I live nowhere near one
Two, I wanna go one on one against D. Rose
And three, I wanna *fuck* Kylie Jenner"
