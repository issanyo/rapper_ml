[Chorus]
Sifting through the puddles
Time can't take the moments that I've made with you
Thought the darkness I hear heartbeats ringing in empty rooms
Could it really be?
That I'm missing you
That I'm missing you
That I'm missing you

[Verse 1: Saba]
Memory slip i need a slide show
IPhone
After life you cross over like [?]
Yeah, I'm tired so
Many people pouring out the bottle
Another puddle on the ground
Reflections of a smile, that I forgot about
Then I throw in the towel
My [?] been trying to tell me what I'm turning into
Another illusion of you i barely can remember
Its barely scratching the surface though like a fender bender
Sometimes i wait for your return like its an intermission
In a [?] never speak, I'm waiting for it
Empty room the only one thats making noise
Ain't a void if you don't accept it
Recollecting all about your ex’s

[Chorus]
Sifting through the puddles
Time can’t take the moments that Ive made with you
Thought the darkness I hear heartbeats ringing in empty rooms
Could it really be?
That I'm missing you
That I'm missing you
That I'm missing you

[Verse 2]
I hear spirits calling
These four walls can't hold vibrations
We created sweet sensations
I feel your hearts beat through the breaks
I hear it echoes in the bass
The records breath your name
Sweet melodies
We celebrate

[Outro]
Could it really be?
That I'm missing you
That I'm missing you
That I'm missing you
I hear spirits calling
