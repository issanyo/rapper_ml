I got angels runnin' 'way I got demons huntin' me
I got stuff that’s in my head
Written for Malcolm Germany

If you don’t know who that is
That’s my biggest enemy
As long as he is on the throne
I doubt I’ll ever be set free

I’m out here livin it lawless
My God I’m dirty
Perverted
I’m sticking with all the
The sickest sins
For Ma biggest fans
I ain’t keepin it real
Man I’m on a
Whole n’other level
A soul-Rebel
That’s without a cause
I'm a soul-Rebel
That’s without a cause

All my life
Never thought I’d end up like
A teen waking up in the middle of the night
Slave to his sin
Evil within
Lookin thru 1 ten ten Billions of sites

I’m a Porno drunkin’
Lord is done with
Waiting for somebody like myself a heathen
Someone stop my inner demons
I’ve been Trynna kill em
Lately all I’m breathin’


Life don’t mean Sh..
Cuz a nigga breathes oxygen X3

Life has meaning
Once a nigga gets to know him

They Tell me I'll be okay, Tell me I'll be okay X3
All they wants a testimony not to walk with me
