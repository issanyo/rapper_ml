[Hook: Saba]
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside rasied me I should get that shit tatted
Grabbing that knife you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted

[Verse 1: Saba]
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
President off a write ins they not even on the ballot
Spreading love like rotation I just pass it like in Cali
I been running rap so long damn my foot got a callus (Saba)
City cold think you need a coat but you really need a vest
Speak on if you blessed I'm coming for your heart like skeeting on your chest
Speak and need a technician upper deck
Tell em live and let listen never deaf
It's too many signs immma get it, on the road to success
Find a living limit pushing lemon pepper chicken
Linen thrift shop, keep it simple
Not expensive synonym of being broke is
I'm just getting by, but barely living
And these niggas wanna bite and burn Billy
And these labels call you how come [?]
But these niggas shady niggas shifty
You'll be gone in a year like you signed to Diddy
It is not a biggy it is natural
Niggas with me off a pack of loud
Split a bliggy down in [?]
Got me high off contact feeling dizzy
Dizzy Gillespie, Galactic the pepsi you cap in the pep
Keep [?] her has on the rapper ain't rapping
I happen to hate em' I wrap em' in plastic
And pack em' a [?] to Alaska frostbitten
Good riddance, Good riddance, I drop good writ-tens
This economy could kill em'
Pivot probably a killa
Hard work to the drug dealers
Parade daily that's Bud Billiken
Drop a tape and they lovin' it
It's in my genes my blood denim

[Hook: Saba]
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside rasied me I should get that shit tatted
Grabbing that knife you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted

[Verse 2: Benjamin Earl Turner]
Animal beats so I Dr. Doolittle them
My pseudonym is GYM
I stay working it out
Killing the fear and the doubt
People keep dying we keep buying the liquor just to pour it out
The earth is a drunk just spinning around
I'm bout to make skeletons come out the ground
Grabbing that life you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Cause a nigga with attitude a lil less scary than a man on a mission
With a real humble heart and a humble smile
And I'm painting this clear like a radiant child
Same old same old, but who could blame tho they know we don't know so educate
Just think about thinking pre-meditate then we don't have to let things escalate
Just move on up, elevate
I heard blacks got magic all in they blood
That's why they quick to shed it
Trying to fertilize they dust
And grow an empire off us
I'm bout to inspire an entire generation to combust
We are engine number 9 or number 6 what's the difference?
CoCo Loco motor movement too much into mangy music
With guitar and sunsets playing light tricks all up on our head rest
Headed out west for a remix revolution
I'm so poor that I swear peace and compassion at war
Who don't need sheep, no Basedgod but ain't it I
Buzz got the worlds eye Lil B

[Hook: Saba]
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
(Get that shit tatted)
Grabbing that life you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
