[Verse 1]

Ah
My girlfriend say she sell a bit ...of drugs
Got cologne in my blood ...a duh
I smell like a winner, I look like big business
Y’all talkin bout raps, I’m talkin bout my next venture
Too young for most venues, bet I sneak up in there
I snuck on them blogs, like PIVOT we in here
So this is kinda like a heads up
I’m right now nigga I ain’t next up
Young nappy headed nigga, never brush
She my teammate how my hand is on her butt, PALM
Kill a beat because we don’t get a - long
Running shit and never pass a ba - ton
Lapping you what a rap’ll do
Catch up because I’m passing you
In the lab like a labradoodle
Doggin I’m doodling, I’m just drawing
And looking down on you
You on the ground like her drawers was, I’m awesome
You don’t kill it, it play possum
I’m positive it’ll be posthumous
Whether trap or hip-hop shit I’m really hot boy
BG my shit is on point got them BGs
Rap dollar, tryna see G’s
Hot spot, no 3G
Leave a beat like CB left Ri Ri
Then burn the shit to a CD
I know Andre Iguodala
The real Iguodala
He owe me a hundred dollars
This my circle, a bonfire
Y’all all squares, I’m a umpire
Step on you lames
Step on your suedes
Heckle your stage
Disrespect when I’m let in the game uh

[Hook] 2x
Pretty girls don’t get my heart
Ugly girls don’t get me hard
Get me hard
Get me hard
Get me hard

[Verse 2]

Ah
Understand me, Understand me
You’ll be under the mic stand while I’m standing
On top of the world, no Brandy
No Crash landing
Y’all demanding checks while Saba demanding planets
Fuck around buy mars nigga
Y’all won’t start like a grandma’s car nigga
I’m in your kitchen
Your daughter leave me cookies like I’m Santa Claus nigga
And it’s all for the love
She just ask me to wrap around her
Like she hop in the tub
I'mma towel, I just rap around her
Then I hop in her ah

[Hook]
