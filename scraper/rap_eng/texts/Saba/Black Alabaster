[Hook]
Carved into stone
That we make it known
Keep your cameras on cause tonight it's goin' be one of those
Carved into stone
That we make it known
Keep your cameras on cause tonight it's goin' be one of those
Mother Nature, Father Time, Son of Mary
Feet so tired, Father God, can you spare me?
Meanwhile, I'm flicking ashes on the city
New memories flicking ashes on the city hope you hear me

[Verse 1: XVRHLDY]
Rollercoasting is the theme, I'm parked and smoking
Stolen doughnuts, gave 'em to the homeless
Am I bogus?
Zay the one
I ain't for none and you can quote it
Ain't for none bitch, ain't for none bitch you can quote it
Awfully often it seem
The men with the pigment will end
In a casket or prison, asking what is it
Cash in your face, you make drastic decisions
Masking the feeling, as we
Joyride to the rhythms of the moon
Leave your bitter friend at home
If she gotta attitude
Soul is sore, my soul is sore
Known to score, prone to score
What you think I'm chosen for, chosen for?
The nigga then gone overboard, I'm overboard
And picking apart social norms
To the rhythms of the moon
Leave that bitter bitch at home
If she gotta attitude
Pull the wrong card, still gotta play that
Trynna go fish but I gotta find a match
Offer 'em a deal but I couldn't sign that
Cause a nigga worth more than a few hundred stacks
Where you at?
Don't get caught in the lights
You get caught at the light
Then you're left at the light
Make a left at the light
Make a left when it's right
I'm prepared for the lights, I'm the man
Fuck with me baby

[Verse 2: Saba]
Hardships of a nigga livin' in the city
They shot Shorty up and left him like he 50
Mean muggin' never smilin' never slippin'
See the cup is half full, it's never empty
Hope you hear me
We was dreaming of a peanut butter cream colored Cutlass
Crop the lames out the pictures, see my pain
Niggas suffering
My nigga got a drum like a bucket boy
Around the street, he a track star
And he be gettin' stoned since his pop left
Black Alabaster
I was blessed to be out
But they still tried to bless me in
25 cents juice bottle in the Schwinn
We all been real since then
With the Cool Kids like 10 now
Can someone tell my side of the story 'bout this side of town
It's a sigh of relief if you make it out
You assigned to the street when your mixtape out
Raise me around with the ratio when you makin' it out
There's not so much in your favor
Things ain't been the same since my brother got raided
His evidence tainted, the picture unpainted
Picasso the way the block got
My mom got a bottle, that's why I don't sip
I learned as a toddler like Rallo done followed my calling
They had the whole colony out on the ship

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Noname Gypsy]
Black comin' back like we best in the season
Your reason to turn up
Writin' my raps on the paper
The tree so clean when I burn up back in the woods
Should've been, could've been free like Harriet
The chariot underground, raps so underground
Caught the Holy Ghost, holy smokes, 6 feet
Under the metaphor, Eleanor lookin' like a raven in night
Edgar Allen Poe on the page when I write
Or maybe that was Martin Luther King for the people
Music black, but the money not equal
Sick of disparity
All of the charity we already gave, you done sold
Sold you to jazz, and the clothes and the lights
And the Nikes
And the rights to the songs that we like
Money so green, every nigga on the scene wanna be Kermit
Like nigga let me sip my tea, smoke my weed, write my song

[Hook]
