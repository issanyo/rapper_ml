[Intro: Saba]
Write away, ay

[Chorus: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
Look at how much fun I'm havin'
Ain't no beauty in the absence of broadcastin to your fol-ol-lowers
I seen a celeb get naked
I seen obsessive behavior, I see famous people all-all o-ver
I don't want no autograph
I just want a follow back, maybe tag to ya' fol-ol-lowers

[Verse 1: Saba]
Playback, say that
That just the way that the game go
After the rain it's a rainbow
I see a product you pay for
Shit get forgotten a day old
If I cannot log on, they starting a rumor
That I had got shot like a day ago
I don’t walk without my headphones
I don't got cable in my crib
I don't even know how we got here
Bein' dependent is my fear
Government look like the mafia
Censorin' out what you watchin'
Internet turned me inanimate object
Solitaire more than a game with your card
Can't change the channel, it'll stay in our heart
Stay in the public and pray to your God
Need validation, I'm too insecure
Characters defined one hundred and forty
Two hundred and eighty, a post to your story
I'm from the 2-90, two sides to each story
Yeah, I'll be your friend, but you cannot follow me

[Chorus: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
Look at how much fun I'm havin'
Ain't no beauty in the absence of broadcastin to your fol-ol-lower
I seen a celeb get naked
I seen obsessive behaviour, I see famous people all-all o-ver
I don't want no autograph
I just want a follow back, maybe tag to ya' fol-ol-lowers

[Bridge: Saba]
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think they got ev—, ooh
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think I got every—, look

[Verse 2: Saba]
Last year I thought I had everything, got it and no
Why am I stressin bout every tweet before a show
Why do I care bout (?)
Why do I wait for a view on who watching the most
Last year I thought I had everything, got it and no
Why am I stressin bout every tweet before a show
Why do I care bout (?)
Why do I wait for a view on who watching the most
If you're lonely you're far from alone (aye, aye)
If you're lonely you're far from alone (aye, aye)

[Outro: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
