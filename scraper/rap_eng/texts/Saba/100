[Hook]
Keep in this shit if you hundred
I'm shirtless and showing my stomach
Officials, my niggas get summoned
Still Pivot we came up from nothing

I know my lady might want it
She love me then sometimes she come in
I promise there is no appointment
Swear that it's getting redundant

[Verse 1]
Young nig punk look like a college student
Feel like a drop belly in a motherfucking hoopy
I can make the road feel just like a movie
Man you want an automatic
I'm a traffic like a woozy
You are not the man if it's just in your city nigga
You are not the man if it's just in your city
I've been in the Bay where the niggas say boozy
Postcards signed yours truly (ooh)

Let's take 'em back to way before
Where you need a bus fare to get the way you wanna go
I kid you not I'm dead broke
Trying to save a little and buy an old Civic or Accord

Hit the microphone and press record
But chilling with my niggas on the porch
We're grinding like I do not have a choice
They love me, that's because I am the voice

[Hook]
Keep in this shit if you hundred
I'm shirtless and showing my stomach
Officials, my niggas get summoned
Still Pivot we came up from nothing

I know my lady might want it
She love me then sometimes she come in
I promise there is no appointment
Swear that it's getting redundant

[Hook]
Keep in this shit if you hundred
I'm shirtless and showing my stomach
Officials, my niggas get summoned
Still Pivot we came up from nothing

I know my lady might want it
She love me then sometimes she come in
I swear that it's getting redundant
Swear that it's getting redundant

[Verse 2]
Why do I feel just like I'm the portal
They knock down the buildings that you loiter
And I spit bars like a wine connoisseur
Til my head get headache Tylenol

Someone told me, "Saba, you a dog"
Demolish the demon in a brawl
Like I'm eating broccoli
I'm getting brolic now

And by the looks of it
You just discover
What is book [?]
[?]

[?] big is phobia
Quit like Kobe done
And I cannot feel
On count of your homie
I'm smooth as petroleum jelly

Niggas still know they not ready
Up in my bread like a deli
I need a podium ready
I'm from the Austin area
Out where the love is still deli

[Hook]
They tell me to keep in this shit if you hundred
I'm shirtless and showing my stomach
Officials, my niggas get summoned
Still Pivot we came up from nothing

I know my lady might want it
She love me then sometimes she come in
I promise there is no appointment
Swear that it's getting redundant


[Hook]
Keep in this shit if you hundred
I'm shirtless and showing my stomach
Officials, my niggas get summoned
So Pivot we came up from nothing

I know my lady might want it
She love me then sometimes she come in
I promise there is no appointment
