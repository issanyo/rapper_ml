[Intro/Outro]
All these niggas know
Since a shorty I've been showin' how I'm different
All these niggas know
Ni-ni-ni- Niggas know h-how I'm different

[Hook]
Who do you wanna be like?
Who do you picture me like?
What will I be when I grow up?
Cause I never wanted to be like them
These niggas never seen me shine nah
And I'm sorry for the me time ya'll
I just had to get my mind right
So now we can move on right

[Verse 1]
First things first realest niggas move in silence
I been quiet, I'm a cotton picker pioneer my mommy had a bias
To a pint of hen apologies, y'all ain't hear
Y'all ain't near and dear to me like William and Hillary
My will will read everything to y'all
And I ain't even dying still it's everything to y'all
Take my heart, take the loss of your brother
To the court system order in it, order y'all to yada yada shut the fuck up (would ya)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been on Adderall too long cause it's feelin' like the same day
Hourglass, sand will pass, that look like the same grain
What's your timezone, is your time gone without living?

[Hook]
Who do you wanna be like?
Who do you picture me like?
What will I be when I grow up?
Cause I never wanted to be like them
These niggas never seen me shine nah
And I'm sorry for the me time ya'll
I just had to get my mind right
So now we can move on right

[Verse 2]
All the kids I graduated with waiting for my major hit
Disregard my shows until I main event
Till I stadium I'mma stay working Stayin' in
Fuck Imma go out for? fuck if you ain't 'bout yours
I just popped a pill, feel invincible
Feelin' like the motherfuckin' GOAT and I'm about to milk the game
Like I'm Game in 05, till it's dry I'm alive
And I know it make it bleed, if I wrote it, I been on it nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been on Adderall too long cause it's feelin' like the same day
Hourglass, sand will pass, that look like the same grain
What's your timezone, is your time gone without living?

[Hook]
Who do you wanna be like?
Who do you picture me like?
What will I be when I grow up?
Cause I never wanted to be like them
These niggas never seen me shine nah
And I'm sorry for the me time ya'll
I just had to get my mind right
So now we can move on right
