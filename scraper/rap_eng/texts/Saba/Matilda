[Verse 1 – Joseph Chilliams]
Get caught up in a reflection like Narcissus
My heart is like waves with a part in it
You should brush up on it
Get familiar, Joseph Chilliams kill ya
Yes he can, like Bob builder
Firearm wielder, with a pen in my hand
My thoughts move you like Matilda
Perform voodoo with diction
The one that flew over the cuckoo’s nest like chickens
Am I sensing resentment? Well stop watching the lifetime channel
Cause this here is primetime ammo
Like Janet, and the tit seen around the planet
Get to know, like Bobby Brown and blow
Everybody knows, like I’m in the garden growing vegetables
Cause it shows, like I bruise easily
Losings predetermined if we need to vis-à-vis
The unflappable vanguard
You already know it, fucking with me, you better come hard (no homo)
Maybe that was out of order
Like this whole courtroom, but there is no justice it’s just us
Brother
Black exploitation like the undercover brothers

[Verse 2 – Saba]
Get caught up in a reflection like kiddy pools
My art is like the babes in the video
You ain’t touching me (bounce that ass)
Get comfortable, class in session like summer school
I’m the last one standing like royal rumbles with 100 dudes
So who’s that? You got a hunch or two?
I’m back like the hunchback after 300 lose (spartans)
King Leonidas, I’m on top of my flow like Poseidon
Pissing on everything in the water coming through
So find me, with a gun and [?]
Bombing bodies at parties for nothing, just because it’s fun to you
So turn up, turn up
Ain’t no telling where you turn up, on the furniture or furnace
Burn ya, iron and scorch and abort this mission
I’m sick of this like Aborigine must be pissed with location switching
Radio station switching, please do not play that here man
I bet they pay to see me, remake a pay for CD's
Like screw your internet and your cable, push it to the max like beta
So I Dreamcast like a forecast, nigga it don’t rain it’s Sega
Vincent Vega, your diction is fiction
I send it to you like my curtain then burp like I’m finished with him
Me and your girl bump and grind like a pendulum nigga

[Outro]
Back up in that ass
For the 9 dre
Aftermath production
Motherfucker
PIVOT!
