[Verse 1: Saba]
I got angels runnin' 'way, I got demons huntin' me
I know 'Pac was 25, I know Jesus 33
I tell Death to keep a distance, I think he obsessed with me
I say, "God, that's a woman," I know she would die for me
They want a barcode on my wrist (barcode on my wrist)
To auction off the kids
That don't fit their description of a utopia (black)
Like a problem won't exist if I just don't exist
If I grew up without a single pot to piss in
Pardon me for ventin'
Congress got the nerve to call theyself religious
Rich just gettin' richer, we just tryna live our life

[Chorus: Saba]
Momma mixed the vodka with the Sprite
They killed my cousin with a pocket knife
While my uncle on the phone
He was gone for more than half my life
He got out a year and then he died
I was honor roll, talking to my father on the phone
Left the city when I was just four
None of them will get along
Momma beggin' him for winter coats
I was chillin' with my nigga Spook now they tryna take his—

[Post-Chorus: Saba]
Life don't mean shit to a nigga that ain't never had shit, yeah
Light don't mean lit in the dark, fight don't mean fists, ooh
Eyes don't see, eyes don't see, ice don't freeze
Light don't leave, I don't mean lie to me

[Bridge: Saba]
Tell me it'll be okay, tell me happier days
Tell me that she my bae, that I won't be alone
Tell 'em I'll be okay when he ask, "How's my day?"
Tell 'em that we the same, tell em' that we not safe

[Verse 2: Saba]
I got my grandaddy soul, I'm at war, that's on my mind
I seen Walter body cold, wish I could switch it with mine
I'm not worried 'bout no rap shit, distractions or waste-of-times
I still go to social functions even though I'm so anti—
No, I'm no Rihanna, the court gonna throw it like Donovan
Down a bit, I just been modelin' my whole career
As if 'Pac was here, studio monitors shakin'
I raise the apartments, I'm Bono with profit
I made what I made in allotted
Amount of time the same amount of time you was watchin'
So stop comparing me to people, no, I am not them
A lot of people dream until they shit'll get—*gunshot*

[Chorus: Saba]
That's life, momma mixed the vodka with the Sprite
They killed my cousin with a pocket knife
While my uncle on the phone
He was gone for more than half my life
He got out a year and then he died
I was honor roll, talking to my father on the phone
Left the city when I was just four
None of them will get along
Momma beggin' him for winter coats
I was chillin' with my nigga Spook now they tryna take his life
