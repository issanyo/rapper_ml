[Pre-Chorus: Saba]
Sweet Westside Chicago, two-flat apartment
Red brick and garden, that's been forgotten
Grass all splotchy, vacant lot splotchy
Bank account splotchy
And we talk like we from the South
Our parents' parents from the South
And if I make a million dollars
I'll vacation in the South, and I'll

[Chorus: Saba, Daoud, daedaePIVOT, and Seanzy]
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile

[Verse: Saba]
Warm outside and safe out playground, grandma payroll cut, yeah
Cut up with my cousins, dream about when we grow up, yeah
Tube socks slippin' off our feet, our soles is hella black
When we die we go to Heaven, know my granny taught me that
Oh, oh-oh-oh, I done lost a friend or two, they moved
Got in trouble for they French, and I ain't mean no Moulin Rouge
My backyard that two-on-two, our whole neighborhood unite
I put my fam' in a hotel when they couldn't pay the lights
Life, I be takin' for granted, capture the moment, the Canon
My cousin be trappin', it came in the mail
I sat him down, asked his plan, he said, "This shit sell itself"
Grandma said, "What is that smell?"
We turn to Boomhauer like we on "King of the Hill"
Niggas talk that they gon' keep it a hundred but I rather keep it a mil'
Everybody eat, I treat it like Heath so that mean it's not a joke
I said I'ma keep it Amel Larrieux that mean a higher note
My grandma from Pinkhill, and my granddaddy from Houston
And if I make a million dollars, then I'ma tell them we movin'

[Chrous: Saba, Daoud, daedaePIVOT, and Seanzy]
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile

[Bridge: Saba, Daoud, daedaePIVOT, and Seanzy]
All that I am is my family, mistakes
Moment of madness I can't seem to evade
More than a canvas, you carry me these days
Practice, I'm trying to remember, remember
All that I am is my family mistakes
Moment of madness I can't seem to evade
More than a canvas, you carry me these days
Practice, I'm trying to remember, remember

[Pre-Chorus: Saba]
Sweet Westside Chicago, two-flat apartment
Red brick and garden, that's been forgotten
Grass all splotchy, vacant lot splotchy
Back account splotchy
And we talk like we from the South
Our parents' parents from the South
And if I make a million dollars
I'll vacation in the South, and I'll

[Chorus: Saba, Daoud, daedaePIVOT, and Seanzy]
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile
