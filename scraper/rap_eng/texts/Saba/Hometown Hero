[Verse 1]
We talkin like we ain't on the bus still
Tryna imagine how ill it must feel
The other day I sat by one of my fans on a train
He asked 'bout my gold chain
He got off 2 stops before me said stay blessed and parted ways
Pardon me (?) my (?) is part of the city
Pardon me hey how to do it I gotta leave it
Hope I can be remembered
Searchin' to find myself and not just for the recognition, yeah
They know my dreaded hair, my dirty shoes, my pager
16's is magic, 32's and vans not gamma blues
She say she love my songs because they helped her see that her dreams had been tangible
Crash landed pool, how I crash landed through
Tell you the truth that's the best I can do
(?) in the views and I'm still on a stoop
And we still looked up to by the kids and the youth

[Hook]
So tell me any way that you wanna go, you wanna go
And I could show you anything's possible, it's possible
Just tell me any way that you wanna go, you wanna go
And I could show you anything's possible, it's possible

[Verse 2]
We talkin' like we don't ride in hoopties
Like when we out of town we don't got motel room keys
A super-sub on a tuesday, ordered a two-piece
To be honest, two-three hundred of it U.V
I used to dream and shit but now we live it
Used to be The Rally, now we Pivot
Changed up the routine
Dropped like fifty records I feel like who-kid
And I'm not here for the who's who
I used to watch blues clues
My handy dandy, fill with his like I'm Sammy
More stepped on than a Tanny
Better my head I'm Himmy
Way up way up I'm Andy
Fanny pack how they strapped up
They coulda got pass on packs but would rather add Patty whack on
Gentleman but my hat on, used to have a crown, was a prince
I'm just my dad's son, these are just genes that he passed on
I know I'll never pass away just despite what the pastor say
Because my words is all I am and that's something you can validate

[Hook]
So tell me any way that you wanna go, you wanna go
And I could show you anything's possible, it's possible
Just tell me any way that you wanna go, you wanna go
And I could show you anything's possible, it's possible
