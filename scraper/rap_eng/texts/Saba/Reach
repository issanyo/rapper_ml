[Verse 1: Martin $ky]
Boy I swear I've been up on my own shit
Boy I swear I think that we the coldest
Made the hottest shit comin' from the city right now
If you ain't know it now you better take notice
And I'm in my own lane, I don't fuck with you niggas
My circle's so small and it's full of guerillas
I baby these niggas, hats off to your city
Keep your pussy ass beats, I ain't fuckin' with the little niggas
Blindfolded, see through the bullshit
BCC from the scene, take a sec for you to see me
Tryna put a label on me, people couldn't read me
It's a shame you don't listen way harder cause it's easy
Holler with the dollars if you need me
Niggas really livin' and I'm shit I'm yellin' "mothafuck a freebie"
Knee deep in a damn beat In the chorus so steep
Tryna eat and the grind finna feed me, uhh
They shit don't bang like my shit
Flow through them vibes on your lonesome
This beat that autopilot
Too cool for the new school, class is in session
Get left way behind when I write this
And the spliff get rolled by the minute now
That you mention it, hold up finna light this
You can find me walking down state with my head high
You already know a nigga hittin' tokes
Look up in the mirror I see red eyes
Blue flame got a nigga floatin' in a smoke
New wave got niggas floatin' in a boat
Niggas mad they hatin' all on the low
And she came with the drama, had to let her go
I've been killin' for a minute if you didn't know

[Pre-Chorus: Martin $ky]
They don't wanna see a nigga win
They don't wanna see a nigga eat
They don't wanna let a nigga in
They like, then a young nigga gotta reach
I ain't even trippin' off that
A nigga threw racks in the game, got it back
Now everywhere I go they know a nigga name before I ever said it
"God damn how he do it, how the boy get on the map?"

[Chorus: Martin $ky]
They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it
(They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it)
They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it
(They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it)
They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it
(They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it)
They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it
(They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it)

[Verse 2: Saba]
Still hit the curb when I'm parkin', I only get coal out the fossil
Grew up round laws and the silence, everybody thought they was Scarface
But me I don't bang I don't partake, but I'm still too real to be called fake
My ex's still going through heartache, cause I keep shit flippin' like Hardy
Boys, all these niggas spitting and it's hardly
Noise, pivot, prolly pull up in the party
Buzzed, that's why niggas bitin', they just copy
Up, but them niggas hardly, us
That fat lady sing in falsetto for niggas
It's all said an done, that's for nothin' my nigga
They all gassed up, but it's all petrol and pitiful
I'm hood like a gyro, so pico de gallo, that's hot
Red out the gun, it's a start
Put that on my mom and my pop
I heard they throwin' shots
Well I be on my arm like a lock
So if you 'bout it meet me at the front
Young, legend in the making
So Michael Jackson I lead to heavens way
So Jesse Jackson I'm dressed in all black
I'm a black information with bros like the Wayans
I'll go Super Saiyan

[Pre-Chorus: Martin $ky]
They don't wanna see a nigga win
They don't wanna see a nigga eat
They don't wanna let a nigga in
They like, then a young nigga gotta reach
I ain't even trippin' off that
A nigga threw racks in the game, got it back
Now everywhere I go they know a nigga name before I ever said it
"God damn how he do it, how the boy get on the map?"

[Chorus: Martin $ky]
They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it
(They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it)
They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it
(They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it)
They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it
(They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it)
They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it
(They said that I couldn't, I can and I did it)
