[Verse 1: Supa Bwe]
I grew up out west, Lockwood, Chicago Ave
They used to beat my ass 'til I started fighting back
Moved to OP, I was OC
Mowgli, grew up with gorillas and some snakes, niggas phonies
Bad ass nigga, throwin' trash yellin' Kobe
If you go Curry, I'ma go Ginobili
Tear drops float over me, hope my ex get over me
I witnessed the older me die in that death match
Why are we drones, so alive in this gridlock
Bad bitch wedlock, used to make her bed rock
Rock bottom, can't get up, like a headshot
Head strong but dead wrong like a landlocked dreadnaught
Dread not shawty, uh, why play bad cop?
It's too many bad cops, it's too many damn ops
Fufu nigga stand down, don't make JuJu stand up
Do you like some dandruff, dust you with these hands bruh
Shawty bad as fuck, what
I think she a dancer
I think she a cancer
But I'ma moon lander
Move like a caveman, down comes the spaceman
Make way, make space man
Down comes the spaceman
Make way, make space man
Down comes the spaceman
Make way, make space man
Down comes the spaceman
Make way, make space man
Down comes the spaceman
I'm so spaced agent

[Verse 2: Saba]
I grew up Austin Ave where they used to beat my ass, yeah
Started fighting back but I still got my ass whooped
Blood on the curb where I learned to use my words
And now the whole block tote Glocks like the purge
I knew I ain't belong so I started writing songs
I was looking for a home like Kanye on Cottage Grove
I was lowkey, undercover like I caught a cold
Still mopey, sad as fuck, in search of pot of gold
That pot turned to dollars, then dollars turned into adios
Before the flight talk to grandma, she know where I be goin'
To the moon and then back and I haven't packed all my bags
But I plan to land and then put my foot down and then put the flag in
Beauty around like a pageant since I found what I was passionate 'bout
Family adament 'bout my cap and a gown
I can imagine it now, how happy they sound
If I were to get a masters or at least a bachelor out, down
