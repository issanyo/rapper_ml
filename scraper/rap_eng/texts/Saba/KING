Uh, uh
Pharaohs summon the slaves
Kings were peasants kneeling down to 'em
All on my name S - A
Everybody's on the rooftop with the same amount of seats that a coupe got
Ex-rulers turned ex-convicts
Time to count down like the bomb lit
So how we'd come to power
When the talk of selling our souls or worshipin' albums
And this is not that
It's that assassin
Like I aim at top hats and cop back
No combat to get maul like where you shop at
Nigga [?] like a comrade
While they pray, I sing
And one day I'll be king
Yeah
Uh, one day (one day)
King (king)
