[Verse 1]
Goddamn, they racing for me like Project Gotham
Goddamn, like Gotham, flow is so Arkham
All in, I keep it so card deck, all that
Word to Amanda, I’m a man of my word
Demanding like the Comcast channel till I land in the dirt
The girl you 'bout to make your family is a fan of my work
You wife her, she five feet like Pfeiffer, she probably pied piper
You talking 'bout you a dog, she took lichen like I’m a liker
I just hit her with a “hi there” like an infant on my high chair
My high stool, take notes like this high school
This how you lose, or loser, your flow is ass like a puter
No computer blue, but prince and a stu
Heir to the throne, lion king two
I don’t even know what y’all on but call on me
I’m a ghostbuster when it’s all on E
Tank on full like World War Three
Reload like Neyo, niggga, Matrix 3
Hate on me like clothes on back
All these sounds around like nigga bozo back
Punchline like he told jokes back
Y’all ain’t ready for Pivot and my solo raps nigga

[Chorus]
Word, word, tell em that’s my word
Nigga this my year, check the calendar
Bro I been here, and y’all amateur
And I ain’t going nowhere
And that’s my word
Word, word, tell em that’s my word
Nigga this my year, check the calendar
Bro I been here, and y’all amateur
And I ain’t going nowhere
And that’s my word

[Verse 2]
This that chump change, chum bucket
Bucket list, building castles in the sand, bucket shit
Shoveling, these tunes in my room
Looking for a couple cent
Couple dollar dollar bill, bar's hot
You ain’t touching this with no oven mitt
Other than Mitt, who competition for a nigga?
I gladly inquire, the flow so godly I quiet choirs
My oh my like Maya, how I seat if I side her
Big globe, like The Rock, Wrestlemania
I’m against the rope
Putting my city on the map like a geographer
A lot of came and gone, these niggas trendy like Hollister
Holler at you when you up, if they caught it cause I’m just lobbing em
Lobby room, waited to long to sing my song like Solomon
So sayonara to the artist that gave his dream up
Let’s do the hardship, but just hard shit, I’m bout to flood the streets up
No FEMA, yo femur, tell em just break a leg
Good luck if you bout that grind, with your almost famous ass

[Chorus]
Word, word, tell em that’s my word
Nigga this my year, check the calendar
Bro I been here, and y’all amateur
And I ain’t going nowhere
And that’s my word
Word, word, tell em that’s my word
Nigga this my year, check the calendar
Bro I been here, and y’all amateur
And I ain’t going nowhere
And that’s my word
