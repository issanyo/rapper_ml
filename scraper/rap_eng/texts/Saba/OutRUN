[Chorus: Saba and Chandlar]
Never get caught without one
We never get caught, we outrun
Livin' dealer lives without fun
We never get caught, we outrun
Outrun, outrun (outrun)
Outrun, outrun (outrun)
Outrun, outrun (outrun)

[Verse: Saba]
Uh, some gold and some goals
A penny in the plan
A fortune in the future
A dream to be the man
Some silver in the scheme
Aspiring to dream
And keep it flowing y'all [?] do the same
Running competition we remain like division
On top like ceilings on top of a building
Dollar and the dream
Money and the motive
'Bout to take shots from these bars in my [?]
And you ain't in the same class I'm in
You write notes, I write hooks like Tyson
I write books, my outlook's to get the title off Microsoft
I don't spit I just cough y'all Tylenol
Tired of y'all
Don't fork I put knives in y'all
Crappy rappers I just stop
That's just something I just stop, pause
Wait, now fast forward ya
They tryna steal my writings like forgers

[Chorus: Saba and Chandlar]
Dollar and the dream
Never get caught without one
Cops come, we never get caught, we outrun
Shotgun, livin' dealer lives without fun (out fun)
We never get caught, we
Outrun, outrun (outrun)
Outrun, outrun (outrun)
Outrun, outrun (outrun)

[Bridge: Chandlar]
With a dollar and a dream
Penny and a plan
Money and a motive
To be the man
With a dollar and a dream
Penny and a plan
Money and a motive
To be the man, man, man, man

[Verse: Saba]
Look, I always sucked at math
And been decent at English
Then I picked up on rap
These are theses I'm speakin'
This is [?]
Decomposing speeches
This is needless to [?]
Close to ingenius thinkin'
Precious lyrics scripted, I'm stealin' 'em straight from scripture
This is villinous hoodlum, stealin' 'em straight from Riddler
Riddle me with your songs, my words are straight from Psalms
Papers like Vietnam
Independence begun
So in penance [?] I'm about to drop bombs
Guerilla warfare ambushin' your cars
All cars these dudes ain't support the cause
We leave these [?] bleedin', how we don't touch like gause
God leave feelin' like bruised [?] rappers
Lyrical muse and hold it down like
Moose
Or glue yo that kick flows while y'all kick boulders
You kick rocks
We finish lines
