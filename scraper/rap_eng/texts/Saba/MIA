I'll be, I'll be ghost, I'll be gone
I'll be MIA
I'll be, I'll be ghost, I'll be gone
I'll be MIA
Yo where you've been
And where you going
I hope you get this sooner
I'll never stop just keep it moving

I've been gone for a grip and a half
Feeling like I may never come back
Left my bags back at the crib
Travel lightly now I could live
With my feet upon the dashboard
Pat my passport in my pocket
Pose on the platform, peace to the people who show some backbone
Letting your own feel like, what do you stand for

Yo where you've been
And where you going
I hope you get this sooner
I'll never stop just keep it moving

Lately days have been bright
Just maybe we could take flight
See those stars inside your eyes
Disappear inside of the night
Right, so we say for the sake of the song
Lost inside my head I've been gone
Ghost to the shell, it's time to move on
I feel so right like I can't go wrong
And I feel it like pen it alive
Shop in my mind, I don't think about time
I've been absorbing like all of that shine
Knowing that all is gonna be mine

Yo where you've been
And where you going
I hope you get this sooner
I'll never stop just keep it moving

I'll be, I'll be ghost, I'll be gone
I'll be MIA
I'll be, I'll be ghost, I'll be gone
I'll be MIA

Yo where you've been
And where you going
I hope you get this sooner
I'll never stop just keep it moving

I been up in my head
Where the hell have you been
I been overdoing all the expectations
Best stay patient
'Cause we been waiting, and I won't pretend
To be preaching, but god is great
Upon the lake, upon behold
Throw engage, eyes upon it all
Keep your head up and you may see a star
My bet's on you, you may be a star
They like drive like someone leave the car
But the past you can't leave it all
Behind in tonight, in align with the sky
That's only limit with the mind so bright
Imagination is so live like my flow so ghostly poltergeist
I'm the outcast by prototypes I know your type be so alike
I just figured I'd let you know
I select you to the rest in yo
Pack your bags and then let's let this go
Around the world and then I'll be home
They was missing that message
Down, I be, I be, I be gone

I'll be, I'll be ghost, I'll be gone
I'll be MIA
I'll be, I'll be ghost, I'll be gone
I'll be MIA

(x2)
Yo where you've been
And where you going
I hope you get this sooner
I'll never stop just keep it moving

I'll be, I'll be ghost, I'll be gone
I'll be MIA
I'll be, I'll be ghost, I'll be gone
I'll be MIA
