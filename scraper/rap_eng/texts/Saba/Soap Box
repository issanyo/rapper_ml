[Verse 1]
White House lawn chair
West side spawn yeah
Piss poor corridor
Real life law and order
Six-piece coleslaw
Chief Keef World Star
Brought to you in part
By Max Payne sawed off
Dodge 'em in slow mo'
No homies in Oak Park
You late as Peter Parker with a pizza
I'm so far
Ahead I'm like Mozart
Conducting an orchestra
My paper the origami
Been folded since Folgers
That's like 4AM
Or since I been 4 feet
Why it's niggas still rich 400 years deep
I been in this shit y'all talking Kylie
I am quite offended giving wisdom
Like it’s my teeth
All black and mighty
They keep a tech, IT
Tag-a-long like "it"
I am on my shit
Soap box on my stage, 'bout to start a mosh pit
Tell them niggas forfeit
I am finally here
Checked in Foursquare
They all knew, foreseen
All these other niggas actors
They just do it for scenes
Been killing this shit since I was 14
Not for the fuck shit
I'll let you meet my team

[Chorus]
I set a fire to the flames in hell
Lord help, Lord help
I been too quiet, now I'm outta my shell
They ain't rocking with it—oh, well
And I've seen the days come and go
I'd swear that I've been here before
I felt the top I feel the low
Meet me on the ground ten toes

[Verse 2]
Black house beach bum
Bucket list completed
Bury me a legend when I die I might go King Tut
Soilder like atten-hut
Cut my granny pension
I might have to cut a nigga
Politicians pimped us
Heard another school closed
Districts discuss
God must be disgusted with us, with us
Imma need that back plus interest, interest
You are not a person nigga
You look like a serpent with a
Plan that's parallel to poverty I'm perpendicular
'Bout to split the dividends
Me and my degenerates
You in that party you deserve to be there lit as fuck
You ain't where I be nigga I be with them pivoters
Y'all look like zombies with y'all bodies children been in drugs
And it is so obvious that I speak truth it is a must
Like sweaty arms they carry arms I swear it is a must
I’m with a army I'm so squadely with my niggas love

[Chorus]
I set a fire to the flames in hell
Lord help, Lord help
I been too quiet, now I'm outta my shell
They ain't rocking with it—oh, well
And I've seen the days come and go
I'd swear that I've been here before
I felt the top I feel the low
Meet me on the ground ten toes
