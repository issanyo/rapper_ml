[Intro]
Sounds like it's gonna be another peaceful day
Oh no! Mojo Jojo is destroying Townsville!

[Verse 1: Joseph Chilliams]
Call me soon at the maternity ward
Written the room
Lemonade and cartoons I'm tryna live it up like Cartman did
Cheat on my girl like Tony Parker did
With a Spanish fly to wake me up by sucking on my sausages
Confidence is in my oxygen
Bleeding out through my pores like four families on hospital floors
Don't feed the animals, we breaking in doors
Have you ever got your shit pushed in homes
Home invasions everyday that block got that "don't get caught syndrome"
I'm thankful everyday I make it home
Could have been one of those newspaper articles 'bout when a gun blows
Then they try to blame it on our skin-tone
Bounce that ass like you would for Jesus
I'm 'bout to lift off using telekinesis and spill like the presidents speeches
Looking for this prostitute named Peaches
From those HBO hoe documentaries
I keep it one-seventy
That's about thirty percent from heavenly
PIVOT deadly, who would you rather hear instead of me

[Interlude: Saba]
(Um, Saba, nigga, nigga Chingy nigga, um, Shakira)

[Verse 2: Joseph Chilliams]
Well I ain't gave a fuck about nobody for so long
Powerpuff like that good weed that you choke on
So gone like Monica singing slow songs
When i penetrate quick
I bet Blossom and Buttercup feeling this
Can't have a sweet sixteen without sugar
I used to be sixteen dreaming 'bout watching Lindsey Lohan and hating [?]
Glad that phase is over
Image need some making over
Still choke 'em out with his wavy soldier skills
Granola all up in my cereal
My Cheerios got me feeling good enough to steal a doormat
Or a bat
Baking on maple donuts it's flour with that
Enough 'bout my breakfast
My grandad from Texas
That's why I'm so reckless
Can I say "I love women" without sounding sexist
Pure like I don't know what sex is
Dumb it down so you get the message
I'm nice as hell
Damn near polite
That's that Black Mormon swag, bagging multiple wives
I don't need you to feel love, an orphan's advice
I need someone to bless me like I snorted some spice

[Outro: Joseph Chilliams]
Now I'm all pretty and shit nigga you better recognize this shit the Powerpuff
