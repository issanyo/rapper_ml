[Verse 1]
If I let you paint my page
Will I get paid?
Or will I just get made fun of
For numbers of reasons of fear of defeating
If I sound like checks do I get checks?
Or will I just get paid?
Check and mate, crate and barrel
Buy a home, start a family
It's hard romancing
When love is in a new state each night
And all our exes white
Promise room and board in-flight
I run two into your mind
I run two to the entire
US of A, if I signed the page
Don't tell me no white lie
Won't settle for no lie
Be careful when it's time
To sign the dotted lines
360s 365
P. Diddys, ebonys and vibes
We busy splitting the find
We the divine
Be careful when you are so
No creativity control
You can round your shelf
You can round, be stealth mode
You can round, can't write your album
Look around, get exposed
You went to the bank to withdraw
As quick as it comes in it goes

[Chorus]
I don't want you, I don't need you
But you're in my head, you're in my head
You're in my head
They don't mean to but they feed you
Now you're in my head, you're in my head
You're in my head
They show you all the lines
You think of all the lies
You change me for the price
Is the girl, she 18
You supposed to pay it

[Verse 2]
If I let you paint my soul
Is my story told?
Or will I just have shit that I don't want?
Not to brag, or boast, or flaunt
I wish passion was enough
I wish fashion was just fun
Like, what's in my closet?
Just a desposit
I don't desire to have attire
Worn by entire consonants
To start a trend, 2Pac, a pen
Apocalypse, the coliseum
Put that on TMZ
Promoting your order reptilian
Bipolar, I told her I'm different
They only think I run an idiot
And it won't be me
Who they want, they split like Jodeci
But I won't let them make more than me
Your fortune's unfortunately in the hand of an elder man
Who is telling you you should wait
And what's the profit off you?
And them, what's the pension?
It's just pimpin' to get you and get you
It's still happening
Still, that penmanship need practice
For when that signature for talents
Exchanged for business in your palace
You moved your mother to a mansion
I got it, I got it
My money, my pocket
My lawyer, my lighter
That soul, my body

[Chorus]
I don't want you, I don't need you
But you're in my head, you're in my head
You're in my head
They don't mean to but they feed you
Now you're in my head, you're in my head
You're in my head
They show you all the lines
You think of all the lies
You change me for the price
Is the girl, she 18
You supposed to pay it
