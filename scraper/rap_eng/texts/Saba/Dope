[Verse 1]

I be the man cause I'm always working
While y'all nigga on hiatus
Once these labels
Hear me pivot
They gone sign me like a waiver
Ima have to go and get it
Strap it down to my back
Taxing everyone that step
In Chiraq and I bet
Like Poker game
You know the name
It's a pseudonym for my government
I just hit a stain
On some novacain
Can you hold me down
Like a covanent
See i run the town
Like ah underground
Rail road
Hail froze when i spit
I can take you bitch
I suppose I'm the shit
Got me posing and shit
One knee Snap shot
But it's only one me
I'm hot
You  all need a mitten
My bars at your head like a fitted
The chair ah have you sit-ton
Intervention
She blue me
Like a mention
True
Trust me now and listen
Tuxedo and mission
Got this  E.P in my bag
There's no option
You should listen

[Hook]

All I hear is
Dope Dope Dope Dope
Like yall den pissed off homer
What you got to this
Dope Dope Dope Dope
I'm tryna get high as hell are you down

What you got to this Dope?
Its mind blowing
I'm gone
I'm all off in my zone
Don't fall off or go home
I'm home

[Verse 2]

My rims black
Sike I'm kidding
I'm unforgiving
Like a felony
Yo girl think I'm cute
Well I'm good for her
Like celery
No belomy
But I'll bill ya tho
John Walt
He so pivotal
You so pitiful
But i pity
The fool
My flows sooths
Like a hot cup of tea
Already won
Got the mock of defeat
I'm so
Absolete
I shave with gillette
Thats Cool
Cause I tryna start shit
I'm just tryna say fly
Magic carpet
Slandered by the stars
But a Jedi knight
Well since y'all sleep
Go to bed I mite
& bed write
Night right
I shine n the dark
Like a night light
You boys spark huh
I slow it down
Like a Latin
Dance
Then jack her son
Like that action man
I pack a punch with these bar
Boy you prolly see stars
When I barf on the mic
Flow cold need a scarf for the night
And I might
Just switch it again
If you'd like
Bring shit from the den
Go 6 or the 10
Got Heart from with in

[Hook]
