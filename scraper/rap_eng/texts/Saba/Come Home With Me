[Verse 1: Joseph Chilliams]
Shotgun shells, ripped shirts like Hulk Hogan
I was born broken, eye balls bulgin' with my dick cut
Like I just had my barmitzvah
Come & catch these hands like a color blind man playing Twister
Mister sandman sniffin' DMT in your dreams
While you off the codein with a king and four sisters
I'm a soul-sister, niggas off the trees like koala bears
Purple strands like something that Black Mamba wears
40 grand globalist, fuck up your whole city
See me pick up your kid like the cover, come home with me
My milkshake can free all the boys in the [?]
In Europe, tanning, they confuse me with Rosario
Fuck this rap money, steady donatin' blood
Everyday until I'm agin' like Joe Nameth does
I don't kill, I write really angry letters and eat kiwis
Y'all thought I was gon' flip like Emancipation of Mimi

[Chorus: Kiara Lanier]
To hour-long conversions on the phone
Can't get you out of my mind
You should come home with me
Everything you do
Everything you say
Keeps me lost in you
Days at a time
You should come home with me
You should

[Verse 2: Kiara Lanier]
780 miles
You been blowin' up my data
Couple other guys have tried
You're the only one I'm after
Skype sleeping on the weekend got me faded
Help me write my college paper, procrastinatin'
Well even in the end, I know we're gonna make it
Wonder who'll stop by around [?]
Know we been together but it's been too long
Let's get this money and do this shit right

[Chorus: Kiara Lanier]
To hour-long conversions on the phone
Can't get you out of my mind
You should come home with me
Everything you do
Everything you say
Keeps me lost in you
Days at a time
You should come home with me
You should come

[Verse 3: Add - 2]
Yo, yo
See love to listen to love
Livin' in sin
Her sip is similar to heaven
She heaven sent from above but lo'
She was an outcast
Listenin' to Big Boi and 3 Stacks
She said "You so dope, Imma relapse"
Relax your mind
Let your conscious free
She say I'm sick, like a constant sneeze
I'm achew
And everything around me like how that cash rules
Pay respect, pay attention like bills that's past due
Mine's still silent as mom's shine just like I mine for it
My bandwagon is draggin' groupies, can't climb on it
Suited like Tom Ford
Of course I got time for it
Connect the dots, get the picture
I got the lines for her
Laying with lady 'cause lately I need her energy
Enemies seem to be friends ain't really who they pretend to be
My intensity can be felt, intensities
She never found one as real as me
She sayin'

[Chorus: Kiara Lanier]
To hour-long conversions on the phone
Can't get you out of my mind
You should come home with me
Everything you do
Everything you say
Keeps me lost in you
Days at a time
You should come home with me
You should come home

[Post-Chorus: Kiara Lanier]
Conversations 2 hours long
And I don't want to leave the phone
I'm lost in the thought of you
Every thing that you say and do
I know
You will come back to me
You should come back to me
Conversations 2 hours long
And I don't want to leave the phone
I'm lost in the thought of you
Every thing that you say and do
I know
You should come home to me
You should come home with me
You should come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
