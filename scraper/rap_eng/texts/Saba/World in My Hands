[Hook: Saba]
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands

[Verse 1: Saba]
The world in my palm like it's pomade
Cheering like they got pom poms on
And I document it, put it on page
Flipped it on em, I swanton bombed
And she say that she saw me on prime time
Stock going up draft combine
I don't wanna hear about the bullshit, I could write a full book
How you only keep it real sometimes
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I didn't try to take my whole life and put it in writing
Put it on wax to play while you drive
I was on the bus with it
Just went to Manhattan on a bus ticket
Y'all still did everything but listen
Now they tryna sign like a petition, submission
How I got the game in a choke hold
Knew my day would come, it was foretold
I've been focusing on keeping my balance
Like I had a couple drinks in the cup-holder
I ain't worried bout your boys moving backwards
Just the forward, 3 Man weave just the forwards
Justified, side by side, juxtaposed, jumping out
Just to show you

[Hook: Saba]
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands

[Verse 2: Saba]
Hey! Look, they trafficking, they don't got crossing guards
We hope to die, we just cross our hearts
Reader's digest, I got food for thought
From where they keep pack like they move a lot
I was a diamond in the rough but rough was more literal
Now I kill with the literary, just drop it on em like litterers
I just put my life in some literature...like literally!
I can't hold it, I feel all of it
The police targeted, like I'm shoppin
Want my albums posthumous, no fraudulent
Gas like flatulence, hoe I feel fabulous
I'm fathering all these styles I hit, then they copy it
You know I ain't worried bout that though (about that though)
Look how they react when I'm back home (when I'm back home)
I could turn the trap to a castle (to a castle)
Still yellin' bitch mob task force (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
In my vans, mobbin' through France
Got my name up on my jersey with the world in my hands

[Hook: Saba]
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands

[Bridge: LeGit & Saba]
Daydreamin' its real when we wake up
Gave my all but can't say I gave up
They wonder what these dreams are made of
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

[Verse 3: Smino]
My beautiful dark twisted fanta-leaf
Burn like the pain when you see me grow
Yeah yeah it's that same old negro
Crazy how now this weed shit legal
Bro mainpassion was the profit
Got to moving trees, like the breeze, only two-piece default
Judge slammed the gavel and he gone
Good man need a lil' more tryna feed his people
Screaming reparations, 'till my respiration meet the expiration, uh
No ain't no rush lil' bitch, I got patience
Doctor the blunt, goddamn me I'm waiting
With the wind in my hand, ay, grinning like damn
Fresh linen, lining flicking like Teanna Trump damn, ay
A town stomp Fuck Trump, chunk
St. Lou taught me never front, stunt
Dave Mirra bring it bike on em, they been feeling dead dripping life on em
On your...head, turn to lice on em
Come to...bread, need a high quota
On a...quest for my lil' niggas
Gotta get 'em back, turn the Phife on em

[Hook: Saba]
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands

[Bridge: LeGit & Saba]
Daydreamin' its real when we wake up
Gave my all but can't say I gave up
They wonder what these dreams are made of
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
