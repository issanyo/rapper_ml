[Verse 1: Saba]
I don't tell the truth so y'all will feel sorry for me
I don't write this shit so y'all will feel God comin'
I don't get down like that
Wrote the amount of raps just on a mission to find something
Calligraphy
Needed to feel, move to the beat of my drum
I don't mean kick and the snare
We cannot bury all of the fucked up shit that we been through
While God keeping us here
We be aware, but only timing will tell
When you will find all your letters
Calligraphy

[Chorus: Saba]
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy

[Verse 2: Saba]
I'm not mad at God, I just can't get out of bed
My best friend obituary really hang on my wall, by the dresser
I'm tryna see it, a life lesson
No more time for mournin' on my schedule, I see the right letters
Calligraphy, yeah
Readin' the signs like I'm a highway driver, I just hit blas√© blase
Hieroglyphic I see the wall that they writing
I build a wall up in my head
Autopilot, what it felt like I was on, I sent the word out flyin'
Calligraphy

[Chorus: Saba]
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of runnin' away, runnin' away
Everyone leavin', I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy

[Bridge: Saba, daedaePIVOT, and Daoud]
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

[Outro: Saba]
I can't get out of bed
I'm not mad at God
But I can't get out of bed
Calligraphy
Running away
Running away
Running away
Running away
