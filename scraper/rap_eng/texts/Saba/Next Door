[Hook: Saba]
Here 911 don't come though
Next door from a bando
Chillin on my front porch
And I'm Listening to Cam'ron
I was Dreaming of condo
Shorty at the gun store
Chillin on my front porch
And I'm listening to my uncle yeah
He Told me stop the bitching
Granny gave me whipping
Daddy in big city
Nigga He was on a mission
And I cried I was so sensitive
For everyday I missed him
I was mad as shit and then
I got back to my senses

[Verse 1: Saba]
Yeah I'm Back inside my fucking mind
I swear this like my biggest fear
I fucked around and almost died
The last time that I took this trip
I never said I was a saint
Just said that I didn't smoke
Never said shit about my family who overdosed
Momma drinking comatose
It's in my genes like a chromosome
Daddy left he said he won't be long
But He was also wrong
I go to school from my grandma home
Seen my mom in that ambulance
She was laid out on the floor
And didn't recognize her boy
Bet Demons never seemed so friendly
Family taking P's like some candy
Every week another auntie yeah
Ante up cousin anted up
Got his grammies up
Go to private school got the ID
And the Lanier
Saggy pants and glasses
I am such a contradiction
And my uncle get locked up
And I just know to stop my bitching
And then shorty get locked up
He got a case and they dismiss it
Then my brother get locked up
And that arrest raised my ambition yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lucki Eck$]
Right right
And I was stealing from this dope spot
And I was just a shorty too
Couple grams later found out they all at shorty school
Finessed up out that jam they like damn look at shorty move
Hunnid none less you lose your hand you try to short me too
Lying cheating and stealing got me riding low now
15 off some X's might as well take some O's now
Took from the wrong niggas then we was all ghost now
Like only way you pass is if you tighten up that O line
Like Lucki you can rap but where them sick of being broke lines
Yeah they pushed the rock so you know that "know your role" line
Like Lucki you can rap but where them sick of being broke lines
Yeah they pushed the rock so right
It's like I'm off my pivot drive and that's why Saba with me anyway
Lemon juice on cuts I'm wasting time making minute maids
Who woulda fucking guessed it
Under ACT pressure
But you know you score me
I'm coming back Devin Hester like
