Look what happened they told me that we could get more
Keep my feet to the floor
Rap trappin Beethoven yes holding dem keys to the door
Chivalry wasn't endorsed
Snuck in with my boys, Sandusky
At my pens state, you can trust me
To get it did like a doo in a salon
On a chick tryna hit a lick pursuing the crew that is on
My niggas
Can't go, so go, chi nigga
The same ole oh no i differ
Want two chains,a whip where the tires sit up
In my city they be drilling and drumming tho i Phillip
Gotta different stroke
Paint a bigger picture bigger boat
All my niggas with me we afloat
Amistad tho i must not give you the imagine that i don't run shit
Burner forest with some gumption
Muhfuckers tryna function
Smooth operator
Tool obligated when yo moves dominating
People you thought cool blood brewed
Now its oooooo how they hating
Ain't that some fuck shit could give a fuck less
Thats success
Even though they took they shot don't mean I'm gone buck less

Im still riden with the same guys
Been there since the start
And yall know and the funny part is its just the start
If you down to ride for the team you can party with the stars
Show you life ain't the same and its sad its just the start

I tell em say ya ya
A fein like aqua and ya girl saying I heart
By far the best
I don't dress to impress
And dont press to get dress
Oh you didn't know
I'm on a roll
I finess
I'm bringing it back
I'm at ya head like the hesh
Oh you wanna text shawty
Tell me whos the best
I'm the best bet
Im Taking off like a jet pack
Been evolved winter falls
False
Dental floss
Been a bawse
In the cut
Bout to send it up
Too cool
To bad in black
Black man return
Like damn he back
Brief recap
Briefly snap
.Kinda like a beast
With bat
Bout time y'all catching on
I shine won't stop
I forever last
But it all falls down
Like an Avalanche
Then you gotta move like
An ambunlance
Make her call my name
Like piano man
She tell I'm the best
And she never had
Cause I'm good for get like
Celery
Good for like celery
Damn right I get to meet the moma
I'm good for her like celery
