[Part I: BUSY]

[Verse 1: Saba]
I'm so alone, but all of my friends
But all of my friends got some shit to do
Yeah, all 'em got plans
I call 'em, I'm bad at texting
They never cross me like bad pedestrians
I've been this awkward since adolescence
I don't know how long I had depression
Never no peer-pressure
I'm tryna' get my little pecker off in some girl
I call my BFF, that ain't no secret kept
I fucked then told my cousin
I'm broke, I wasn't buzzin'
I tried to hit a few years, she wasn't budgin'
I'm bogus, left my girl for some shawty
Surely deservin' of all this lonely
"You sad? Tell me, how are you sad?
You got all of these friends, you got all of these fans"
I ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in
Jesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat
I'm tryna cope, but it's a part of me gone
In this packed room I'm alone

[Chorus: Saba and Daoud]
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh

[Verse 2: Saba]
I'm so alone, just me and my girl
She leave me for work, then leave me for school
She finally home, I leave her for tour
FaceTime me nudity, yeah, all of this new to me, yeah
All of the infidelity when I was 17 been catchin' up
It still feel like she'll catch me cheatin'
Niggas askin' me how tour was
Knowin' I been home like two months
And I seen your ass like two times
Save the small-talk like two dimes
No time, social interaction
Had female friends I found attractive
I tried to fuck but I am no savage
Now we don't speak, we just walk past
If my past could talk
It'd probably reply to the missed calls after all
Cause the friendships that I can't recall
Done turned my heart into camouflage
While the guys I used to play basketball with
Doin' shit that I can't endorse now
With the Lord now, when it pours down
Was alone then, still alone now

[Chorus: Saba and Daoud]
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh

[Part II: SIRENS]

[Verse 1: theMIND]
I'm barely here, how I ain't present?
Yeah, I drift for a second, forgot to reply to your message
But all these years
I been the same in your presence (I'm still here)
Countin' the seconds before I reply to your message
My biggest fear (is that I have to say goodbye another time)
Is that I have to say goodbye another time
(Not like this, not like this, not like this)
So I skip town on our moment, hopefully prolonging this
I don't need nobody new to miss (not like this)
I want you to know
Ooooh, ooh ooh, ohh

[Chorus: Saba]
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels, yeah

[Verse 2: Saba]
Ridin' through the city
I'm young, I'm black, I'm guilty
I know one time wanna kill me
They don't know me but they fear me
15 years old with the sticky
They gon' blame it on the marijuana
Hands behind your head
And they won't let up out they lead
But if I move thats disrespect
But if they shoot then that's just that?
And if I run then that look bad?
Drawing they gun right off their hip
I'm probably deservin'
'Cause I know they serve and protect
But they think I'm servin'
Or they think my cellphone's a weapon
Heard that the robber wore a black mask
I fit the description, a.k.a. "nigga"
What is the difference? It's an enigma
We so divided, I'm from Division
Clutch that purse cause of my dreadlocks
Cross that street cause I'm with my friends
Curse every song in hip-hop
Keep telling yourself it's all fair

[Chorus: Saba]
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where theâ€”
