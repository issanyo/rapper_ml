[Background: "It was great, apparently I've never been on live television before..."]

[Bridge: Noname]
Noname off the drugs, Noname quit the weed
Telefone delight, love is all I need
My honeybee red black and green
Majestic queen
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say

[Verse 1: Noname]
Like maybe I'ma miss you after autumn
And all of the fallen callers and ringers
When singers hittin my tele, and tele paging my beeper
The reefer got me like, "Whoa, slow down."
I need a minute for minute's sake, a dinner plate
A casanova with catalogs of his dinner dates
Make me feel special, Jay Electro-Soul
I need a nigga to follow me to the rabbit hole
And fall in where I fall in
I'm ballin', I'm out control
I'm ballin', I'm out control

[Pre-Hook: Xavier Om채r]
You say you see a way that
I can not see, then say that
I never knew it all
I'm just trying not to fall
And now I'm chasing patience
I need it for greatness
Look at this time I'm wasting
Mad at how it ended
Really, If I tell the truth about it

[Hook: Xavier Om채r]
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it

[Verse 2: Noname]
Everything is everything, a cigarette for wedding ring
And tell me that you love me and love me tomorrow
The matrimony catalyst for secondary
Get to know me in Chicago, how I go where you stay
Unorthodox paradox in a pair of Docs
With an overbite, oversight to a merry clock
Happy go lucky was a time, you and I
Happy go lucky was a time, do or die
You remind me to love myself for the principle
For the kid inside, til the end of time
Happy go lucky was a time, umm okay

[Bridge: Noname]
Noname off the drugs, Noname quit the weed
Telefone delight, love is all I need
My honeybee red black and green
Majestic queen
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say

[Pre-Hook: Xavier Om채r]
You say you see a way that
I can not see, then say that
I never knew it all
I'm just trying not to fall
And now I'm chasing patience
I need it for greatness
Look at this time I'm wasting
Mad at how it ended
Really, If I tell the truth about it

[Hook: Xavier Om채r]
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
