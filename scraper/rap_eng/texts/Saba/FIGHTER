[Verse 1: Saba]
Me and E-Guy just fought 'cause his family wouldn't stop talkin'
We neighbors who argued often, I run, I jog to him
Toss a jab and I caught him, he threw a left, ain't connect
'Cause I ducked when I came back up, I seen his sister talkin' trash
Like, "Touch my brother, I'm beatin' yo' ass"
So I fucked her brother up to see what she about, yeah
Walked away and then we noticed that his teeth was out, yeah
She ain't do shit, she just mad we got to see her pout
So me and Cell, we just fought, I was walkin' and then he jawed me
I dropped to the floor while calling for help in front of my grandmother's house
The next hit, he punched me my mouth, I can't believe I'm on the ground
'Cause I tried to hit him, I gambled, I'm ugly cryin' in public
I'm like, "When I get you back, you gon' wish that you never touched me"
Somehow I never could touch him, our brothers broke the shit up
And I walked the rest of the day with my head down
Funny how gettin' your ass beat'll spread 'round, yeah

[Chorus: Kaina & Saba]
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more

[Verse 2: Saba]
So me and E-Guy, we scrap again, Jacob jumped in, I'm handicapped
Manny watched from across the street then he ran up and hopped on me
Three on one, they teamin' up but me, I never think to run
They circling around, got me surrounded like police or somethin'
So it's bad enough they already jumpin' me
Then I see Cell comin', I'm prayin', "Please don't fuck with me"
(Please leave me the fuck alone) It's not fair and I think he agrees
So instead of fighting with them, he came and teamed up with me
Me and Grandpa ain't talked since I stopped attendin' the college
He called me, said I'm a scholar, I should be gettin' my doctorate
Or, shit, at least in the army, instead you chose to hip-hopper
I know how this is gon' end 'cause I went through this with yo' father
Me and my girl just fought 'cause I talked before she could talk
She was tellin' a story, I cut her off with some shit not 'bout
The same topic so she just stopped in the middle before the plot hit
The rest of the car ride silent like "You always do this"
Like "You don't value my thoughts, either that or you too damn stupid
To realize that if you don't hear me out then I'ma feel muted
You say that you care, well show it, I'm not askin' a lot
I know you think you listenin' but you just waitin' to talk"
My fault

[Chorus: Kaina & Saba]
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more

[Verse 3: Saba]
It's harder to love myself when all these people compliment me
Somehow it just remind me what I don't got
But these folks don't care to know
They think you rollin' in the dough
Not realizin' your next meal is a 4 for $4
Still feeling the guilt that Walt never thought to call
Fightin' myself to get out of bed
I'm fightin' myself to get out of bed
Fightin' myself

[Chorus: Kaina & Saba]
I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter

[Outro: Saba]
Yeah, me and all my niggas dropped out
Then we drove to Texas, slept at Waffle House
Kicked out of the hotel, we all broke
We don't got no mattress, sleep on yo' floor
Me and grandpa ain't spoke since I dropped out
Made sure on my first tour, stop at his house
I sleep on the hotel, not your floor
He tell me that he proud of his boy
I'm not a janitor no more at Homan Square
Saved up for a round trip, LAX
I just learned it's no risk, no reward
I slept on the floor at Port Authority
Me and all my niggas dropped tears
Heart been on the floor for a whole year
We all broke (we all broke)
We all broke
