[Intro (5X)]
(I Slept All Day)

[Verse 1: Supa Bwe]
I just wanna be numb
That's why I drink and fight and smoke so much
Stay gone, Bitch leave me alone
I don't wanna be loved
Just obeyed, paid, and respected
Been walked the path of rejection
These mushrooms help with reflection
I used to have a lot of friends
I used to be so fucking cool
But cool ain't what the fuck I want
What else am I supposed to do?
Doing what the fuck I want
What else am I supposed to do?
Apex- that's the chosen crew
Pray we have't chosen you

[Bridge: Supa Bwe] x2
I'll share my demons, if you
Share your demons, we might
Share these feelings, my wounds
Still need healing
Know OG's who still be peeling
They lack control
In her mouth like plaque and gold
My skin is made from black and gold

[Verse 2: Carl]
And we awoke to the sound of machines
Cell phone rings, clouds full of steam
Erupt from the building tops, we all feel small
She left skid-marks when her heart peeled off
Told her "Remember these waves"
Slow motion replays
So many layers we laid on the tracks for the train
That hit like a dab to the brain
Of a lonely decayer
I'm cold as the mayor
Rhyme with the manual, read as she kneels
Eyes closed for the prayer
It felt so real, it ain't no one to save her
It's all for the game and the player
I mean it's all for the love
Have a Carl for the road
Have a Carl for the road
I done wandered around
I ain't lost but I'm found
As I'm causing these sounds
That I sing when I dream when I sleep all day
(sleep all day, sleep all day)

Thank God she brought an early Winter
Thank God I'm gone sleep well tonight
Blue blood full of shit she ain't heard about
Wait homie better make sure you scale it right
Cause I gotta dip right after this
Goin on hiatus
Just had to cop catalyst
Going thru these phases
No fear in my balancing
And boats still floating, I'm still paddling
Trying to make a crown, need golden and talisman
Hurt Everybody can't worry about challengers
Niggas hate, that's just my analysis
I'ma need land for my fam and my palaces
I'ma drop bands on a cam just to film it
So everyone can live the trials, battling
External bullshit and internal real shit
These niggas still snakin- they hissin and rattling
I'm sleeping..

[Verse 3: Saba]
Kinda feeling like a nigga who ain't made it
I never did drugs but I needed a feel-
Tried these mushrooms they made me crazy
I tripped with Damage and that nigga had to save me
I went slept all day, I can't sleep no more
I gave a demon the world, she told me she want more
Please O Lord, give me adderall
Keep me out my thoughts
Keep me out my body
Give me avatars
You can tag along
We went hella far
I am out of arms-reach
Don't ever call me
No Dragon Ball Z
But we defeat Cells
My brother locked up, fuck it
We defeat cells
See the detail, wonder who told
I'm from out West
Just like Dee-Low
See the D-boy in streets like detours
My momma wouldn't approve
Of my friends, what they do
Find a girl, break her heart, I'll tear it in two
Bitch you can't find my ex like a variable
And can't find my house on google search neither
It do not hurt either
The truth that will free you
When she says she miss me
I do not believe her
