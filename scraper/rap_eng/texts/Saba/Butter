[Hook: Saba (2X)]
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood

[Verse 1: Saba]
I got up out of bed this morning feelin' like some butter
Toast up in my toaster or some waffles, boy whatever
Pick my nappy fro but boy I used to have 'em butters
Fuck the niggas that hate, tell 'em everything's great hey
Pardon my parkay, patient yeah I wait
Mature for our age, Daily's a parlay
We got here upon fate, Got in the door late
Cause I've been the best for two years now
Tell them dudes sit down I'mma do it how ever the
Fuck I want, fuck you thought?
Because you won, that we lost
Up and coming, that we are
Where I'm from bitch, that be Austin
You worried 'bout the wrong things, cause money can't buy you love
Or make your dreams come true, so I'm just Butter (butter)

Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
They love you
You're here
They hate you
Who cares?

[Verse 2: Saba]
My father told me that the world was mine when I was five
Figured I could never fail in life so why not try?
To think of the impossible and bring that shit to life
Like why I need a job if all this shit already mine?
Steady vibes, and they are the good
Westside nigga, we all the hood
Still managed that honor roll
Still don't live by the books
And I get love from where you come from
I just come for all this comfort
Had this dream that I just conquered
It just dawned that I am Butter butter
