[Terminal Knowledge]
Keep walking on your own two
Ain't nothing that's gon' hold you down
Now you know that we gotta get it
They told me the skys' the limit
The trick is just not to let it hold you down
(x2)

Don't let it hold you down
Fuck that

[Verse 1: Terminal Knowledge]
You know we got to get it
Beach Squad and Pivot they the stars of the show
Equipped with splintered bones to straight up carve it in stone
If they startin' to doze off get 'em focused and centered
Heart made of gold? Nonsense, the soul of a sinner
Hardly spoken from scripture
I bark like a Doberman Pinscher
Dissecting the roach and smoking its innards
I get with the go and flow like a twig in the shoulders of a mighty stream
Life is a frightening dream, over with lightning speed
Homie hold me down

[Saba]
Like resuscitation
I'm back in the spot like a Dalmatian
And hot like eternal damnation
From my block to every block in the damn nation
Fans patient-ly waiting like 50 cent
Bums patient-ly waiting for 50 cents
I'm the fan favorite
They like new smokers, how they can't face it
I don't do raps, these more like facts, bro I'm like fucking Google
Fuck introductions, you don't know me, go to fucking Google

[Acumental]
I'm from Chicago
Death quadruple stats
My city pop, and I'm flexing, I'm shooting gats
But I got a Coolmax vest let the ruger flash
Ac taking shots to the chest, call me Tuukka Rask
I'm the best, present, future, past, ever
Everything I do I do it to the last letter
You should google Ac's name for elusive raps
Came here to do the damn thing for my groupie cats

(Hook)
Keep walking on your own two
Ain't nothing that's gon' hold you down

(Verse 2)
[Acumental]
I check into room 237
Say word to hell, I never heard of heaven
Let's twirl a L, I got herb to sell
I got personnel
We tryna earn a living out here
Gotta flip that weight
First things first, better get that straight
Big bad wolf and the pigs get played
Like a three course meal then I lick that plate
Nothing but straight trash in my weight class
So muscle up with your fake ass
And just slow your roll, no brake pads
I don't breakdance, I can't bust a move
But I'll drop a needle in a dusty groove
(The sky's the limit)
Yeah well if that's the case then fuck the roof, like

[Terminal Knowledge]
Google me three, if the shoe fit, greet you with a boot tip
Them new Timbs and a Jesus piece
Preaching to these two-bits, but
You know that, a priest to me is Judas
Uh, and you know Sab, he beat the beat with two fists
It seems to me you clueless
The movement is makeshift
Stankface raise the roof and the basement
Go on split the philly
Fill it up with piff, puff, puff, give
What it is, what it don't do
My clique finna show you

[Saba]
On my own two like kangaroos
You came to lose
I'm winning like Winfreys
2000 B.C. (?) with some bare heat
That is unnecessary
I am so secretary
Frightened, cayenne, I am so high you would think a cop was chasing
Jason Vorhees, clutch like Horry
Story, origami, uh
Folding like loose leaf, or cooling, I am grinding
Like a smoothie Kujichagulia, that determination
Old ladies catch the holy ghost
I got your servant waiting

(Hook)

(Verse 3)

[Acumental]
Yo I get up in the morning early
Before the birdie
Immaturely hoarding furbies in the attic
Yeah I'm sorta quirky
Score 30 plus, I got you by the short and curlies
We court gorgeous girls and sport Jordan jerseys
I was born to slur important words and foreign verbage
Or verbiage
Find me torching herb in Mormon churches
Recording verses yo, I'll slaughter you for sacrifice
Man I swear to god, I'm holy water to the Antichrist

[Terminal Knowledge]
Class in session
I'm not a mathematician
Failed the exam but I passed the written
Tail through my legs in the back of detention
And as soon as class dismissed, my crew finna wrap the swisher
Call it a habit, I call it packing the tools of a black magician
There's a diplomat between heaven and hell
But you never can tell what's fact or fiction
I is what I am and I am what I is, but I can't seem to kick this crack addiction
Smacking bitches on they asses, making rash decisions
Cause lately ain't nobody ask if they can grant my wishes
I lack efficiency, don't have concern for the listener
Fuck bad for business, that shit's one word
Cataclysmic, get to work
Pump up the jams cause uncle Sam and his merry old band of henchmen
Been roaming the homeland asking questions, about past aggressions
Don't run just grab your weapons and
Load 'em up

(Hook)
