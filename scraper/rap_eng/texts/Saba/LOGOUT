[Intro: Saba]
Write away, ay

[Chorus: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
Look at how much fun I'm havin'
Ain't no beauty in the absence of broadcastin' to your fol-ol-lowers
I seen a celeb get naked
I seen obsessive behavior, I see famous people all-all o-ver
I don't want no autograph
I just want a follow back, maybe tag to ya fol-ol-lowers

[Verse 1: Saba]
Playback, say that
That just the way that the game go
After the rain it's a rainbow
I see a product you pay for
Shit get forgotten a day old
If I cannot log on, they starting a rumor
That I had got shot like a day ago
I don’t walk without my headphones
I don't got cable in my crib
I don't even know how we got here
Bein' dependent is my fear
Government look like the mafia
Censorin' out what you watchin'
Internet turned me inanimate object
Solitaire more than a game with your card
Can't change the channel, it'll stay in our heart
Stay in the public and pray to your God
Need validation, I'm too insecure
Characters defined one hundred and forty
Two hundred and eighty, a post to your story
I'm from the 2-90, two sides to each story
Yeah, I'll be your friend, but you cannot follow me

[Chorus: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
Look at how much fun I'm havin'
Ain't no beauty in the absence of broadcastin' to your fol-ol-lower
I seen a celeb get naked
I seen obsessive behaviour, I see famous people all-all o-ver
I don't want no autograph
I just want a follow back, maybe tag to ya fol-ol-lowers

[Bridge: Saba]
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think they got ev—, ooh
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think I got every—, look

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Everything's on camera, everything's on camera
Everybody want handouts, everybody got pamphlets
Everybody want Santa, everything is on camera
Everybody want pics now, everybody got antlers
Everybody my kid now, everybody got pampers
Everything is on me now, everybody got cameras
Ain't nobody got Chancellor, ain't nobody got answers
All them scratchin' they head now, ain't nobody got dandruff
Don't nobody like selfies on they own page
I know people with they friend requests as they homepage
Ain't put a picture on they wall since the Stone Age
Feel locked up in they own cage when they on stage

[Outro: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
