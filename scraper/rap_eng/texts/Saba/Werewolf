[Verse 1: Kevo B]
Legendary with the hustle and flow, bro
Meet the lord of the rings, no Frodo
Sab you should kill beats, this Jo' tho
Fuckin'up the town, Mojo Jojo
Warning, the shit that I'm fixin' to spit so sick
You won't know whether to vomit or shit
More bars than a county and packin' punchlines break a lil nigga' torso
PIVOT get it, got it good
Free my nigga Jimmy Hood, rappin' our way out the hood (Jimmy!)
Real rap, real talk, shit real so I do what a real nigga would
That's make a way, make a plan, make a habit
Make believers out motherfuckers that don't believe shit
Get where you goin', tell them haters eat a dick
No forks, no spoons, no chop-sticks
Bring ya day one niggas who was there from the get go
Fake fucks come around when you get dough
My tolerance for phony is zero
Can't forget to flex on your ex
And one night the hoes that [?]
But never reply to your message or text
Success is revenge and it's better than sex

[Verse 2: Saba]
Fuck who gon' like me, I'm better than next
Off with their head, boy I'm severing necks
From now until I'm outta the game like a flagrant that's like I got several tecs
Jenga player how I kept a stack
Name not django, but I'm selling hoes back
Divide and conquer, the plan of attack, ayy
Saba sold out and now he sellin his rap
If ever you ask
[?] you ask
I'm on my wave like I'm wearing du rags
I'm 'bout ot get bigger like erica ass
Never switched up, you dudes Kevin Durant
Last of a dying breed, evolution
Study my rhyme scheme, here's the blueprint
Niggas think they can see me one-on-one
Until I got kentucky then me want it done
I did, look what I did
I'm young and I get it like a spy-kid
Plus I know, every word, they'll bite it
I don't really gotta rap, fuck it I quit
Last of a dying breed, ain't byson
See y'all boys all frightened
Nigga, rap to me is just body, body, body
Mufucka, no surviving

[Verse 3: Joseph Chilliams]
Mufucka, no survival
Right hand on the bible
Sex with me is always short n' quick n' great just like [?]
My goal is to be cute, and down to earth too
Smillin' all the time like I'm in a tampon commercial
[?], throw that ass in a paralellogram
The truth about to come out like when cops sees Never-never land
Me n' the squad scheeming like sucking dick for wedding bands
People unaware of the video game character, call me Megaman
The plan is to get so big one day I can't see my d like Melo fans
I hope all this pressure make me pretty
Because you here one day and then you gone the next like Angelina Jolie' titties
Bet Imma come back like Goku
'09, I used to go by Joku
Me n' Frsh were like Fox & Falco
Been had the target, acquired the vision
I'm comin' for Chris Martin like Gwyneth Paltrow
