[Verse 1]

Roll up out my slumber
Roll up Doja
Breathe another
Breath
Shower, shit and shave
Pick up my phone and hear another
Death
Terrence died
Half the family cried
Who I'm gon protect?
Half the time I'm
Pseudo suicidal
Sulk cause I'm depressed
[It yo party how you sad?]
I'm on the brink of my success
Half the time I grin and bear
I wear my soul around my neck
Scarfed and harnessed
By this awful garment
That I've grown to hate
But love is love
And love is me
I love it when it's more at stake
Its on the line
Time don't wait for mines or yours
Im tired of poor
I'm tired of broke
I got a taste of private jets
And giant tours
On my accord
I'm focused
Ain't been driven in a minute
I'm chauffeuring
But I'm working
Ain't been timid in a minute
Who I'm kidding...


[Hook]

Shit I'm nervous
Below the surface
(Below it, low lit)
Below the surface
(Below it, Low it)
Shit I'm hurting
Below the surface
(Below The)
Below the surface
Below you serpents
Uh...

*Day before....*

[Verse 2]

Grandma made your plate
We played 2K
That's just the day before
Numb just at the thought of Walt
I got that call, yo cousin gone
Smile from cheek to cheek
I'm acting normal like ain't nothing wrong
Woke up out my slumber
To a phone number I ain't ignore
It's yo cousin, he ain't last
No ambulance, police report
Know I got these spirits now surround me
Like a ouigi board
Shit hit like a meteor
Still sad cause he can't see me soar
Still mourning bout Kobe death
He only want see me tour
Broken while I'm broke
A double negative, like neither nor
I never signed, or placed initial on that line
Like leader boards, what we've endured
Can shut another nigga down like demonoid
My demons dead
A lot of my friends dreams is dead
We keeping on
But..

[Hook]

Shit I'm nervous
Below the surface
(Below it, low lit)
Below the surface
(Below it, Low it)
Shit I'm hurting
Below the surface
(Below The)
Below the surface
Below you serpents
Uh...
