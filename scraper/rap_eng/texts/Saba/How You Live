[Verse 1: Saba]
Guess who is back in effect
I push this rap to the next
Level the lap I get check
Catch a body on tracks like a cannibal neck
I'm from where Hannibal at
They try to silence me
You cannot can the vocab
That's their plan of attack
But I speak and then leave em with panic attacks
And I don't mean the disco
Get 'em at the barber, Brisco
I sip the tea like the brisk cold
I turn your stage to a shit-show
Mosh pit, pop shit, missile
Mosh pit, pop shit, missile
Get em out the bread like Swindle
Niggas steady talk and I ignore

{Hook: Mfn Melo}
Shawty told me I was young, what that is?
That's to
Get down how you live
Get down how you live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
I, I can’t go along with this shit
I'ma get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how you live
Get down how you live

[Verse 2: Saba]
Independent like a politician
Who not democrat or republican
Still I'm droppin' wisdom like a dentist
Finger-fuck the game, I'm never with it
Ritalin, you should really pay attention
Gimme this shit I don't need a gimmick
Put me in a guiness, afterall
They tried to put me in a box
And I don't mean to ship it
This shit way too easy
Listen to my last year CD
I don't hear a difference
Between what these niggas spittin' now
Just now hip to what I been about
I done hide and check my whereabouts
Dumb it down, he did it for the clout
Hundred round, I go and air it out
Same Chicago that yall hear about
Champion my name up in the banner
Till I'm going gray like David Banner
All this shit organic on my grandma
Let me talk my shit like on the panel
Panama these niggas wanna trade
My life lookin' different everyday
Oh I'm up next like I got a bouqet?
I can't pay attention what they say
I can't let it get to me (No)
This shit don't mean shit to me
They waitin' on me to blow up as if I ain't fail chemistry
But I see it differently
'Cause me and my niggas we got it out the mud
And I mean that literally
And I'm major, even without a major
This is not the little league
Fuck

{Hook: Mfn Melo}
Shawty told me I was young, what that is?
That's to
Get down how you live
Get down how you live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
I, can’t go along with this shit
I'ma get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how you live
Get down how you live

[Verse 3: MFn Melo]
Better know that life you livin' change
You can bet I got it different ways
Been a day
Churnin' lemonade
Blessin' pour it never Minute Maid
Uncle, Daddy know he for the kids
Uncle Drew he OG pivotin'
Showin' love make a hater quit
Ware him out like your latest fit
Niggas get finessed they call it 'biz
I cut back off finesse and karma rig
Thought I learned my lesson 'till was quized
Filled it up, graded on the bitch
Rhyme to well, made it my niche
I remember workin' early shifts
No more retail, shop my business
Time will tell how they witness
Boxes was stackin'
As soon as I'm freed
Then it's back to the booth with no slackin', man
Pack, I was packaging, now I charge you
Knock on wood that I'll never go back again (Uh)
Came dropped the ball with this hit
'Cause you know pivot what it is
I'ma get down how I live (Aye)

{Hook: Mfn Melo}
Shawty told me I was young, what that is?
That's to
Get down how you live
Get down how you live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
I can’t go along with this shit
I'ma get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how I live
Get down how you live
Get down how you live
