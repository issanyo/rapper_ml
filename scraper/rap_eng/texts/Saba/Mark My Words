[Verse 1: Jordan]

Maybe that's true
It's worst if it happens to you
Where they rapping with a lot speed
Speaking out of turn
Like a lot will be
Too many opinions man
Did I hit the lottery

I didn't ask neither
Sitting here, chill
Hear a few talking pills
Who am I to say

You know that I popped a pill
Aye
You know that I popping pills
Aye aye

But I think I found the truth
Found in a girl so outstanding too
Doesn't matter
All of this is surface
Mine has mind
And a head that deserves it
Yeah
And I think I deserve it
Thank God for Syl
Thank God for Syl


Finally found my way home still
Mandem finally know what's real
What's real
