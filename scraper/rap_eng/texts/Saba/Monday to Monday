[Verse 1]
Honestly I think that 24/7 a understatement to my day to day
If ain't no way then imma make way
Naysayers say it ain't no way
I ain't never listen
Kept em at a distance
This is for the ones who ain't afraid
And this is more than some paper chase
I wonder who else can say the same
Never worried bout what they attain
If I'm living then I really can't complain
Can't contain who you really are
I know my true colors like this ain't a stain
Hustle hard like a MMA hit
Innovative
Didn't do it all in a day spent
But if they did we ain't hating
Look, I go double or nothing I'm just here to gamble
On my grind like my name was Kareem Campbell
Built it from the ground up like I just went camping
My name should be hand in hand with Thor's hammer
Remember when I couldn't afford dinner
Losing weight I'm getting more thinner
Saw it coming like a lesson planner
All the glitz and glamor critically acclimated I grew it on my own my organic
Now my agent say we tour planning
World renown like Michael or Janet
Got it out the ground like growing granite
Gracious I can't take a day for granted
Never looking down and never panicked
Only kept my thought on being great
And that's what I attracted like a magnet

[Pre-Chorus]
I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
Got me feeling like Lebron James
Wasting time bet that's what some say
Remember when they didn't want me
I knew I was on to something
10 to 10 what my alarm say
A.K.A. Monday to Monday

[Chorus]
I'ma put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Micro, macro
I'ma put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Macro, macro

[Verse 2]
Like a vision board I see with clarity
I hustle like my name was Gary V
For more than the wealth and prosperity
Accountants was talking bout equity
I'm Triple H giving a pedigree
That mean that I'm special my specialty
I put in the work till I'm dirt in the earth
Or moving furniture to Beverly
I cannot stress it I just let it be
I want it all I am not settling
I'm on the move like I was settling
Failed a few but I ain't sweating it
They say success is like the best revenge
I can't kick it with no pessimist
Know it's my time that ain't tentative
Monday - Monday talking 10 to 10

[Pre-Chorus]
I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
Got me feeling like Lebron James
Wasting time bet that's what some say
Remember when they didn't want me
I knew I was on to something
10 to 10 what my alarm say
A.K.A. Monday to Monday

[Chorus]
I'ma put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Micro, macro
I'ma put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Macro, macro
