[Verse 1: Joseph Chilliams]
I be damned if this shit never take off
This is more than just some positive vibes because I watched The Secret
I ain't puttin' out ass tapes then watching my homies making and cashin' on that like Memphis Bleek did
Self-sustained like suckin' my own penis
What you think I practice yoga fo'?
If yo girl wanna blow, Imma tell her nah
It's '04 and I'm covered in pink like Roc-A-Fella, Y'all
Communal showers like Beanie Sigel
Hoopin' for the squad just like William Regal
Blueprint layout
Then I drop the ball like Memphis Bleek when Is That Your Chick came out
I'm starving like he is
For that one hit, you know that one hit that'll change things
I'm from west side and I throw it up like Naomi Campbell
I muhfuckin' gangbang
I got squad, I got fam
But 'round here you never depend on nothin' but death
No freedom, no food, nothin' but death
So when I drop my first tape, it's gonna be nothin' but
Young chomp at the cutting board
Stabbing a Power Ranger with a silly puddy sword
Losin' John Walt
I swear February 8th feel like the other night
And none of this a-be possible without brother mike
I ain't goin'- goin'
Goin' out like Memphis Bleek
Climbin' and never reach a peak
You never even got over a hill
Keep all yo' business discreet
'Cause you never got over a mil
It's every gold digger's dream, to be in a millionaire's will

[Pre-Chorus: Joseph Chilliams]
Now I ain't saying he a gold digger
But he ain't messing with no broke, broke
All them years of moving coke, coke
You made it out, you give us hope, hope, hey
I'm proud of you dawg
Not really
Don't send your new shit my way
I can't listen to that, you might rub off on me or something

[Chorus: Raych]
Now I'm not saying he a gold digger, per se
But matching his & her safes
Decked out guest rooms with closet space
Something's not adding up here
Where's your income?
What does your life consist of?
Can you riddle me that?

[Verse 2: Joseph Chilliams]
Name one song he did that was just him
I know Imma make it like the first time I touch rim
Been at least a year since I seen my older brother
Wish he had to power to disappear when they bust in
I can't help a feeling that it's just us now
I only trust AKAI buses and bust downs
We out here strugglin' week to week
But I'll be god damned if I turn into Memphis Bleek
Sucking up for seconds on god emcees, I'm secular
Holy scriptures don't determine how Imma eat
Did you win yet?
Or is [?] still ask you: "Is it in yet ?"
Nestled up to the powers that be
Don't be an easy target, start shit like MLK in Alabama
Gamma rays & David Banner
Plan is of my Grandma
Can relax one day, lift up her feet
Reading a book entitled "How To Not Be Memphis Bleek"


[Chorus: Raych]
Now I'm not saying he a gold digger, per se
But matching his & her safes
Decked out guest rooms with closet space
Something's not adding up here
Where's your income?
What does your life consist of?
Can you riddle me that?

[Post-Chorus: Joseph Chilliams]
Now I ain't saying he a gold digger
But he ain't messing with no broke, broke
All them years of moving coke, coke
You made it out, you give us hope, hope, hey
Now I ain't saying he a gold digger
But he ain't messing with no broke, broke
But he ain't messing with no broke, broke
But he ain't messing with no broke, broke

[Chorus: Raych] [Reversed]
Now I'm not saying he a gold digger, per se
But matching his & her safes
Decked out guest rooms with closet space
Something's not adding up here
Where's your income?
What does your life consist of?
Can you riddle me that?
