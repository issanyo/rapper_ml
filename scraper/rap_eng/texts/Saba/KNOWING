[Verse 1: Saba]
Spray-painted BB guns in the Pentagon
Infiltrate, I'm making fart noises on the intercom
Since I got a little shine for making riddles rhyme
White girls sniffin' lines probably chillin' in the line
I'm in alignment with the universe, I'm feelin' fine
Niggas talkin' "get it, son," they ain't readin' what's in the fine
Print, but y'all ain't did to me like Diddy, Shyne
Cause I go in like indented lines, and it's dinner time
With my dogs like Adventure Time
Me and that nigga $ky control Medulla, feel it in you Fibula
They been saying they're going hard? Bull, still alive
Beat the track black and blue like "How the hell it still alive?"
Stealin' my style like "Sab, we rock similar."
Use Similac, sent it back like "I'm too grown." Simmer down
Taggin' they songs so it can come related
This for my dislikes, I hope you hate this

[Hook]
Keep it cool, come and knock, come along
This that calm before the storm
They on us 'til we at the top where we belong
They can sleep up or they be dawn
Keep it cool, come and knock, come along
This that calm before the storm
They on us 'til we at the top where we belong

[Verse 2: Martin $ky]
A-plus, apex, predator to break necks
Haven't gone insane yet, rappin' on the same set
Backpack full of mild citrus for the session
Grabbed a couple blunts and proceeded to burn the essence
Far from being average, I'm an addict for this rap shit
Sat up in the back of the cab rollin' a fat spliff
Really be about it, you don't really be about shit
Closed circle, better watch the cash that you arrived with
Zoned out, vibing to this beat homie created
I ain't worried, we the greatest; it's getting easy to make hits
Sweet sixteens, punchlines: these are them basics
Them wack raps fill in the gaps, they close bases
No offense to those that don't notice
How my flow be the coldest, overdosing on dope shit
It would help you to notice things while I am present
Present rap killing, future rap legend

[Hook]
