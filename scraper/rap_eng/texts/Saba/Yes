And they just dropped the charge on some hella fu shit middle fingers to cops
Hope that shit finna stop, I been wishing for knots
And my mission is hot, Scottie Pippen the gwap

[Verse 2: Aaron Deux]
Can I come kill this shit
Cause 12 still be killing my niggas no matter if innocence
They living the dividend
Yeah, just divide my hate beside I'm great
Multiply the times I taken the love
Plus the times I'd taken the drugs
Minus all the time I wasted on ya
But shit don't worry bout it, I said don't worry bout it/
My nigga got with caught with possession but he ain't even worry bout it
Yeah he ain't even worry bout it I said U.O.E.N.O we some Niggas from the south side
Of the shore drive
Where niggas get got with a gat in the back or a 45
Jordan past prime
Going for the high score but shit just vibe with a nigga oh no, Try with a nigga don't lie to a nigga cause a nigga like me won't go
Without a fight I never flight unless i wanna get away
With you to a better place, but shit that's a better case
If you really wanna stay, then I hope everything's ok
Cause for me there a game
Out for me to play
But if I'm a playa, I need Lisa Ray, No clubbing tryna slay till my diamonds Cartier
No tryna delay, need to go all out today

[Verse 3: Saba]
First the city, then continent
Q-tip that thing vivrant
I'm all at yo head, sick like the plague, spit that Bubonic
Mixed with ebonic, we move in silence
No we are not talkers
But know I chase all of the guap
Like Monique and the Professor on the Parkers
Know that we coulda got arrested, locked up
Place that we rest, it's work hard as the hardest
I said this year I'ma broaden the audience
Saba da Vinci, Saba departed, ugh
I coulda chalked it up, I can't take losses bruh, hot like faucet, ugh
Dj Unk walk it out westside my momma house fuck is you talking bout
Ay Ay, young nigga from the go with some goals I can't hang out
All my friends say I'm going ghost and I changed now
I can't trust a muhfucking soul what's a bank account?
Mean to a nigga with some morals
The city be vibin', my nigga be bout it
Just like the no limit soldiers if this was the 90's
I come the from the westside you know the 290 yea
Kinda like, a big deal, did it all, without a deal
Not to flex but just to keep it real
Paint the picture hope you see the mural
