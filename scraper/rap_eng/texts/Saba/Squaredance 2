[Verse 1]
(UG Vavy)

Say I want my money long like Halsted
Benjamin is my accomplice
First I was a square
Now for this square she throw that ass inside a rhombus
Swear she had at all then lost it
Lost it all when she lost me
Feeling bored so she ollied
To the next nigga balling
Stayed focused now I’m bossy
Same phone newer wallet
Got it
My time she no longer has it
Pull my card it’s holographic
Girl my shine is automatic
Her momma always absent
But my dick was alway present
Now Polish shorty accent
Sent me nudes in the past tense
Send me nudes thats hella graphic
Trust the world and never have it
Stored outta sight like addict
Dehydrated let me ask ya...

(LEGIT)
Could I offer you something to drink?
You know they get thirsty
As soon as they see you on top of your game
Better pack an umbrella you never know
You might get caught in the reign
I guess that my time on this earth
Might have taught me somethings
Taught me somethings..

[Hook]
(LEGIT)
Fork in the road baby, I left
Oh no they can’t see me like this
Oh no they can’t see me like this

[Verse 2]
(Average Bo)
Her thinking so irrational
And her attitude sucks
But she bad and that ass kinda fat
So I adapt like wall pieces
Pleading my case like a plaintiff
I been anxious for results
But I ain't pee on no stick
Puck on the ice
How we been back and forth with this shit
Straight shots of the henny made me empty the clip
Broken remote behind closed doors we don’t even click
Slick with the words
I approached her with my hand on her hip
Like whats your name and your zodiac
That cognac up in yo cup look similar to mine
The congregation of this club is all lit
I’m autistic with this pencil
Spit a verse like I’m retarded
So defensive like we fencing
I can’t poke her face i’m haunted
By the last love I had
And my girl at the pad like a period
But she ain’t hearing shit
Gave her the dick then I dipped
Like a nugget in that sweet & sour
Made a wrong decision, grabbed the towel
Let me hit the shower
