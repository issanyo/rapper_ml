Frank:
Evening, Madame. Yeah how you doing?
I'm finna spit it out, get a dow, deal it out
Hit about a milli other lovelier in the dome before I skidder out
Feeling good about that I say mmm, too cold, le roi de froiduer
King Kong, and the beat Pompeii with a bat to the back of the rap concierge
With that concerned, then I'd wreck and burn
Never let’em insure that’ll never get learned
Yearn Everest, cold like Severus, it’s a manevolant evident turn
Check yo mans finna get shit handed bandit bitches stitchin bandages
On my management, he my mans and shit, hit a zan let a gram hit the fan and swift
Hands off, gotta get a better grip on shit, this
Girl finna get a bit lit in my office
Aw this chick heard a bit around town, downtown found how to ground pound that shit get off
Pound on my wrist, girl no no don't front me
Flirt in the dirt no shirt, no skirt, mo purp gonna make that berry pop
Me and that girl we fairly rock
Pair with a flare and a cherry top
Finna bury pop where the sun don't shine and the young don't climb on the rocks
Oh girl you a fox, let's go down down to the cover down low where I made her go (ah)
Finna cock, reload, and rock n roll, continue to get hot, bitch

Chorus:
OOO x 8
