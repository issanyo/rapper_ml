[Intro: Saba]
Hey, hey, haha
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I chill like a villain would
Whether downtown or I'm in the hood
In a hooptie or with the foot
The supporters I made em listen
Our dreams came true premonition
Outside looking in like fencing
I see my city in a light that glistens
We on the move like auto tires, auto pilot
No bull this Chicago fire
Inspired minds out of all this
Artist came together and then work the hardest
Long days I am living proof I cleaned the hallways
Now I'm on the stage, not a middle school play
But remember school days
I was bumping Food & Liquor
Listening to Lupe
I was grinding, touch√®
That was at the open mic
Them was every Tuesday
Now we on the road
Cuz we work profusely
Art scene like a renaissance
Man it been our time
Shout to everyone who brought it to the lime
Light
I remember when it started yeah the stars aligned
I remember sitting watching now I'm on the line
I remember wicker parking on the blue line
I remember window shopping by the green line
We let the ideas sing these new times
All love two fingers up peace sign

[Pre-Chorus: Daoud]
Where ever you go know
When your stars align there's no limit but the sky
Where ever you go know
Seen it with my eyes
You won't know unless you try

[Chorus]
Take your time can't speed
Where ideas sing
Just vibe with me
Where I

[Verse 2: Saba]
I found inspiration in the pavement
Basement studio
They stay true to your
Heart like cardio
All that coolio
And then some
I been here before
Entered the door
When temperature, drop
And it's cold
This is the go
Ya know that
I bojack
Came through on a horse man
That horseback
Boy that
Bean beam when the sun out
City never sleep sun up sun down
But somehow we still here getting dreams out
True to our roots yeah we seen a seed sprout
I know urban creatives
Who weren't in the paper
But currently earning
And they were touring the nation
I used to be looking at everybody and waiting
For my time until I realized that I gotta make it
Community spaceship
We all are the stars
The next generation
Keep pushing it forward
Young pioneers and my peers and the poets
We bringing it back home right where it started
I'm feeling bombarded
By all of the love
I just bought a car
I was just riding the bus
Spoke out for the dream
Instead biting my tongue
That's how I let my ideas sing, but now it's your turn your turn

[Pre-Chorus: Daoud]
Where ever you go know
When your stars align there's no limit but the sky
Where ever you go know
Seen it with my eyes
You won't know unless you try

[Chorus]
Take your time can't speed
Where ideas sing
Just vibe with me
Where I
