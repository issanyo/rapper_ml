[Intro]
They call us scum, from the city slums and
They all think we idiot, like we

[Hook]
They call us scum, from the city slums and
They all think we idiot, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, cheap drinks
Bible, we pray

[Verse 1]
Kill in Jesus name, kill people for a Jesus chain
For a fortune we'll change, can't afford to eat with change, real pain
Our tummy growlin', they money pilin', my mommy poutin'
Some of them doubtin', I don't
But it's funny how if it's money 'round then I loan
They closed the school that you went to
And told you that it's rent due, left potholes where you carpool
And caca on that carpet, Chi kids love startin' shit
I don't, there's no politics in my home

[Hook]
Cause they call us scum, from the city slums
And they all think we idiot, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, Chief Keef
Bible, we pray

[Verse 2]
But kill in GD name, and get judge by our GPA
Shit if we don't like the same food, how they expect us to eat the same?
How learning different?
Burnin' bridges to earn a livin'
Raise your blood pressure, no tourniquet
But expect you can turn the cheek
Major turn of events when you turn eighteen
They kicked you out of your middle school, said your work was pitiful
Mama's loan didn't get approved
So you got a gun, lookin' just like them
Cause whether cap and gown or cappin' down ya called scum

[Hook]
Why they call us scum, from the city slums why
They all think we idiots, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, cheap drinks
Bible, we pray

[Outro]
Feelin' regal in my old school regal
Listenin' to Segal with a couple of my amigos
They been speakin' about the evils of the Windy Coast
That's too many for me to mention, so hear a dose
Know a dab will do ya too much
Sab' will school ya not even gasin' him up
Each track hit harder than a Mack or a truck
You don't hear me though, my music too up, aquatic with the flow
Change seats, change cuts, this upholstery  too much for a degenerate
Too much mixin' with the likes of [?]
Purple rain yo' broad
Take the game cause the player ain't do it
Schools closin', got the lady into it
King pin, light skin ain't men
Every time I hit the scene they say dark be the trend
Oblivious to the fact black have skin
You see people where I be seein' my twin
Too many losses got me focused on wins
Chuuch!
