[Verse 1]
Think I found my way out, way out
Gliding under radar's radar
I hope that you stay long, stay long
I will never play out... too strong
If you wanna play all, play on
I don't never say much, say less
If I cannot say all, say once
I know that it's takin' patience

[Chorus]
Finding you on my timeline
Way out, way out
Holding onto your lifeline
Way out, way out
We all wanna need somebody, way out, way out
Holding on with just anybody, way out, way out

[Verse 2]
I had to pick up the weight at home
Body building in the poorer zones
Grab onto spirit, my body gone
Mama she grew up in Audy home
Daddy sold crack on Ohio, his Audi chrome
They called him lord
World is all he known
Saint in a sinners prison
Water whippin in kitchens
Two kids tryna hit his phone
Sayain the super intended to get him
A sig, and he sent in the final form
Raidin' and bullets the tribal norm
Kill or be killed and you die alone
They caught Geech on the porch, why he never went north
Can't remember his fav' cologne
Trauma deleting my mental's own
Even my thoughts of you aren't my own

[Chorus]
Finding you on my timeline
Way out, way out
Holding onto your lifeline
Way out, way out
We all wanna need somebody, way out, way out
Holding on with just anybody, way out, way out
