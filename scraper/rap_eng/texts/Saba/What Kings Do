[Intro: Saba]
Yeah, Uh
Look

[Verse #1: Saba]
How I'm the man on campus, Ion't even go hard
My mom's thinking that I made it already
I'm working hard, nigga you should know that
T Mac Jersey, yeah I had to throwback
Ion't game 'em, I just send emojies
I park Raekwon, She pay pretty toe
Real nigga like my city's own
Drop a hunnit you might hear them stumping
'Cuz I be with an army of niggas
Feeling like I'm Chauncey Billups
Leave the tent and the V on a red
I just speak on a beat and they play it
They don't think, just running their lips
Tell 'em catch up, that's your first rhyme
Call your back up, send for back up
Don't you back talk 'cuz I don't back down
And that's what kings do
Yeah that's what kings do
I spit that seafood and that's a prelude
But the show sold out, go over my soul out
Go before my whole soul out
From the block were they go about
Fuck the game and don't pull out
Pull up in that [?]

[Verse #2: Carl]
I fornicate with my foreign friend
I love this bitch, she never loved again
Some nigga ripped her soul, she can't fuck with men
So I brought a friend, we fucked again
I'm crazy baby, I love the scent
I love when you say "head number skin"
And you always make life fun again
And it sucks to lose but you suck to win
And that's love
It sucks to lose but you suck to win
And that's love
It sucks to lose but you suck to win
And that's
That's all I need
(King)
That's all I need

[Pre-Hook: Carl]
And all your flaws don't mean a thing
And all your flaws make me a king
And I'm appalled that you would think
I'm not one, I don't know how
You've been lately, I've been feeling awesome
I know one day
Everything we talked about would blossom

[Hook: Carl]
I know I'm a king
I know I'm a king baby
I know I'm a king
And you know I'm a king too
I know I'm a king
I know I'm a king baby
I know I'm a king
Just tryna do what kings do
I know I'm a king
You know I'm a king too
I know I'm a king
Tryna do what kings do
I know I'm a king
You know I'm a king too
I know I'm a king
Tryna do what kings do
I know I'm a

[Verse #3: Taylor Bennett]
Shoutout to my niggas that's ballin'
I know that y'all presence has softened
Presidents rap in this effort to rap
But his ass could've been in college
Would've been a scholar
Could've been a white collar, big wallet
And ballin', you callin', he got it, you want it
He bought it, he's just stupid, retarded
He on it, better get on target
Thats a muphuckin' gift shop
Some of y'all shit hot
Gotta get it or you get got
Niggas at show tops tryna get boxed
For a shoe box, [?] school trucks with no rooftops
Steal your dreams and aspirations
All they see is guap but fuck that shit, I'm on top
Whipping that shit like "Mom, look what I made"
I'm a motherfucking chef like Creme brûlée
Niggas tryna call shots, I'm the referee
You don't wanna fuck with me 'cuz I'm the best emcee
Let's do it

[Refrain]
That's all I need
That's all I need
