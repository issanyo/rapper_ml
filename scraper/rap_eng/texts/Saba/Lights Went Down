[Verse 1: Saba]
Been a loner my whole life, so I'm awkward I'm sorry
Anti-social in the parties, ain't talk to nobody
Bodies moving I'm stiff as a statue but not godly
Home alone, Macaulay Culkin
Even though it's on a friday
Finally I got a text like she meant to invite me
Out I'm going out with my friends but I still want to be sobby
Silently I'm thinking 'damn man this can't be a sign
We might end up together
By the lights and [?}

[Chorus: Saba]
First the lights went down
Then the kiss went down
Shoot your shot and pray it don't miss
Used to get turned down
Still gettin' turned down
But tonight I think it might end a lil different
First the lights went down
Then the kiss went down
Shoot your shot and pray it don't miss
Used to get turned down
Still gettin' turned down
But tonight I think it might end a lil different

[Verse 2: Saba]
Been alone for too long I forgot how to approach you
Introverted, my words is worthless it's muted vocals
Fantasize that one day I'll be the guy who you go to
When you reply what I wrote you
I see your eyes though bifocals
Nervous my tummy in cirlces
But we are up like nocturnal
Animals to the AM I know you gotta go son
'Til you tell me you like me I know that theres a sound
We might end up together
By the lights and [?]

[Chorus: Saba]
First the lights went down
Then the kiss went down
Shoot your shot and pray it don't miss
Used to get turned down
Still gettin' turned down
But tonight I think it might end a lil different
First the lights went down
Then the kiss went down
Shoot your shot and pray it don't miss
Used to get turned down
Still gettin' turned down
But tonight I think it might end a lil different

[Bridge]
You know I need it
I really mean it
Cuz all I want is
You know I need it
I really mean it
Cuz all I want is
