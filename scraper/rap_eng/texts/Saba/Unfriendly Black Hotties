[Intro: Joseph Chilliams]
Like anybody, I like to have a long life
Longevity has its purpose
Fuck Bow Wow (fuck)

[Verse: Joseph Chilliams & (Saba)]
Sit that ass on my - like Rosa Parks (Rosa)
At the bus stop, tryna fuck, what it do? (ay, what it do?)
Dreamin' 'bout that pussy just like Dr. King (dreaming)
I hit once, it drove me crazy like angel dust (smokey, ya)
You not wearin' pink, you can't hang with us (no)
You fuck with R. Kelly, you can't hang with us (no)
Run this shit back after Valentines (pew pew pew pew)
Free all my niggas, free Palestine (free 'em, free 'em, ya)
Pull up with the stick like Nintendo Switch (pew pew pew pew)
Rest in peace to Walter, had to reminisce
Susan B. Anthony wasn't no feminist (no)
Quincy Jones' whole gang with the shits (with the shits, ya, ya)
Everybody black, just like East Atlanta (black)
Four girlfriends, just like Kelsey Grammer (ay)
Drinkin' whites' only water straight from Alabama (white)
Switch the color of my nina like Zoe Saldana (Zoey, zoey)

[Chorus 1: Joseph Chilliams]
Ay, happy Black History Month
Now we back, now we back
Happy Black History Month
Now we back, now we back
Happy Black History Month
Now we back, now we back
Happy Black History Month
Now we back, now we back, ay
We don't celebrate Kwanzaa here (no)
White folk hate me like ObamaCare (white)
Hope I don't offend my peers
When I say that that's a mouthful
Like kujichagulia (ya, ya)

[Chorus 2: Joseph Chilliams]
Happy black, happy black
Now we back, now we back
Happy black, happy black
Now we back, now we back
Happy black, happy black
Now we back, now we back
Happy black, happy black
Now we back, now we, hm

[Outro: Saba]
Ay, ay, yah
