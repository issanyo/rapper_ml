[Intro]
(Ayee, aye, aye, aye,)
Comin' down off it
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)

[Hook]
Comin' down off a high (Aye), feel you with my third eye (Ayee)
I swear I don't even know y'all
I'm with Billy like I'm Road Dogg
Comin' down off a high (Aye), feel you with my third eye
I swear I don't even know y'all
I'm with Billy like I'm Road Dogg
Comin' down off it

[Verse 1]
Legend hoe, I got the hammer, corner store'll prolly ban me
Wicker Park or picket fence, nigga attitude like Ray-Ray
(Comin' down off it)
It's intense, feelin' like a nigga rich
Walked into the corner store today, lookin' like a mag-net, aye
(Comin' down off it)
The Kodak is more like balone to me
Walk in the store and I feel like the owner, B
Known to split bands up like KC and Jodeci
Wanted poster, you should take a photo of me
(Comin' down off it)
My nigga I'm the life of the party, I never spend a night with a thottie
And when it's time, my own niggas callin', callin', callin', callin'
(Comin' down off it)

[Pre-Hook]
Legend in the making (like I'm Billy Williams)
Want it, I'ma take it (like I'm Billy Williams)
Feel it in my spirit (that the end is nearing)
I can never fold
Legend in the making (like I'm Billy Williams)
Want it, I'ma take it (like I'm Billy Williams)
Feel it in my spirit (that the end is nearing)
I can never fold

[Hook]
Comin' down off a high (high), feel you with my third eye (eye)
I swear I don't even know y'all
I'm with Billy like I'm Road Dogg
Comin' down off a high, feel you with my third eye
I swear I don't even know y'all
I'm with Billy like I'm Road Dogg
Comin' down off it
(Aye, aye, ayee, aye, aye, ayee, aye, aye)
Comin' down off it
(Ayee, aye, ayee, aye, aye, aye, aye)

[Verse 2]
Drive through like it's GTA, thinkin' how I'm getting paid today
I'll walk in and take it, before I put this shit on layaway
(Comin' down off it)
That's ferocious, whole hood'll prolly know me
Never fucking with the police, I don't give a fuck I'll take a nigga groceries
(Comin' down off it)
Comin' down on it, with a pound on me
Oh, people probably looking down on me
Coz it's loud on me, all my niggas know that they can count on me
(Comin' down off it)
My nigga I'ma take what I wanna
You looking like a stain, that's a cum up
And I'll go get it by any means, rain, winter, summer

[Pre-Hook]
Legend in the making (like I'm Billy Williams)
Want it, I'ma take it (like I'm Billy Williams)
Feel it in my spirit (that the end is nearing)
I can never fold
Legend in the making (like I'm Billy Williams)
Want it, I'ma take it (like I'm Billy Williams)
Feel it in my spirit (that the end is nearing)
I can never fold

[Hook]
Comin' down off a high (high), feel you with my third eye (ehh)
I swear I don't even know y'all
I'm with Billy like I'm Road Dogg
Comin' down off a high (high), feel you with my third eye (eye)
I swear I don't even know y'all
I'm with Billy like I'm Road Dogg
Comin' down off it
(Aye, aye, ayee, aye, ayee, ayee, aye, aye)
Comin' down off it
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)

All I ever wanted to do in my life was, make music. So...I guess, on my bucket list, what I really wanna do is-s, drop...a project. Like, nobody has to even listen to it. I just, wanna know that, I did it. Be able to say, I went out there and, did that and I chased my dreams. And that's really it
