[Verse 1]
Symmetric soul I know you are out there
My better half apart, we like a pair
The rest the world cannot come and compare
When you and me align, a line will form of those who came before us but they're mad they're unimportant
When I was 15 I would sit and fantasize
Bout the one day I could take my mom advice
This month a couple record deals gon' get declined
Cause you were hard to find, to find and fall in love and spend my life and die with by my side, side...

[Bridge]
That's the symmetry, her and me, currently, oh
Simile, really need, you with me, oh
Enjoy, energy, with me, oh
And we'll just, be complete, 'till we, old
That's the symmetry, her and me, currently, oh
Simile, really need, you with me, oh
Enjoy, energy, with me, oh
And we'll just, be complete, 'till we, old

[Hook]
Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)
Cause we got plenty (cause we got plenty)
Time before we old (time before we old)
Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)
Cause we got plenty time

[Verse 2]
Symmetric soul, my soul is longing for you
And I just want you, I don't want no other
My exes, I know you may know a couple of
But you were never concerned with past lovers
I promise I'ma be here for a while
Only if you let me and I'm lucky
From up here we can see over the clouds
Baby what's your preference? Do you love me?
I know what happens is fate, I know God don't make mistakes
I see my future with you, I'll do whatever it takes, hey

[Bridge]
That's the symmetry, her and me, currently, oh
Simile, really need, you with me, oh
Enjoy, energy, with me, oh
And we'll just, be complete, 'till we, old
That's the symmetry, her and me, currently, oh
Simile, really need, you with me, oh
Enjoy, energy, with me, oh
And we'll just, be complete, 'till we, old

[Hook]
Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)
Cause we got plenty (cause we got plenty)
Time before we old (time before we old)
Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)
Cause we got plenty time
Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)
Cause we got plenty (cause we got plenty)
Time before we old (time before we old)
Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)
Cause we got plenty time

[Outro]
If I tell you my story, would you then tell yours to me?
And live to see the day...
If I tell you my story, would you then tell yours to me?
And live to see that day...

[Skit: Jean Deaux]
My bucket list...my last minute bucket list, ok
I wanna write television shows, films, have movie premieres
Well hella just hood glamour ass sh-[Beep]. I wanna...degentrify our neighborhoods, like buy property and rent it back to the people who grew up there. And last but no least...I want to smoke a blunt with Beyonc√©, that's the most important for sure
