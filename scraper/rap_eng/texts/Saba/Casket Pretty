[Hook]
All of my niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
Niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring

[Verse]
I've been searching for God in the bottle he gave me
Ashes to Ashes, dearly departed, regarded as Holy
Don't hold me, don't hold me when niggas is dying and dying
And I'm afraid of the dark, blue and the white
Badges and pistols rejoice in the night
And we watch the news, and we see him die tonight
Tonight the night his baby said goodbye
Roses in the road, teddy bear outside, bullet there on the right
Where's love when you need it?
Too many babies in suits
Too many babies in suits
Back before the dawn, ricochet the pawn
Bullet in the chest, you ain't mean no harm
Collecting your checkmate, I know you in love with the power
It's flowers at every occasion
I need me a medicine man
Somebody heal me, somebody take my hand

[Hook]
All of my niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
Niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
