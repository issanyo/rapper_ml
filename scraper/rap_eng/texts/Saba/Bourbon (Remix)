[Verse 1: Gallant]
I'm a headless horseman on quilted sand dunes
With my neck wide open, I pray for refuge

[Pre-Chorus: Gallant]
'Cause since I've been found I've been living a life in cages
Withering down to the champagne quicksand
Wrestling doubt I've been dragging around for ages
I tried to let it drain but my veins are hopeless

[Chorus: Gallant]
'Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking, I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup

[Verse 2: Gallant]
I'm a tri-tone bible with misprint logic, oh yeah
I count lunar cycles with faithless prophets

[Pre-Chorus: Gallant]
'Cause since I've been found I've been living a life in cages (life in cages)
Withering down to the champagne quicksand (champagne quicksand)
Wrestling doubt I've been dragging around for ages (dragging around for ages)
I tried to let it drain but my veins are hopeless

[Chorus: Gallant]
'Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking, I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup

[Verse 3: Saba]
Ay, some guy might say what you can't do
But I say that it ain't true
'Cause a guy and an angel when I light 'em
An artist I might paint you
They got thoughts but it ain't food
I know life is a painful place and the same fools hatin' will be the ones
With a similar path to the same one you've taken
And for a little bit, I can't stay but
I gotta make the most of my time
Focus and grind 'cause the whole city dyin'
And I've never had the glory but I'm tryin'
And I've tried, and I advise
Live to stop the liar
Like a visor block the shine and
Let the light and truth be told a Michael Tyson
And remember and ta-ta
Get a bit discouraged, or maybe that was misworded
Or let it be misquoted
But I feel like it's certain that I walk for it like toward the Lord and lead them all like tutorials
Like Toro y Moi the cause of this all is life and that shit's hard
Still fuck what a naysayer may say
On stage in the bay, hit the nae nae
Serious like the radio can't say
I got dreams I'mma make it
But until my AKA is the greatest, I don't give a fuck about an alias
I am human, I'm homosapien, makin' the best of my situation

[Chorus: Gallant]
'Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking, I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup (bourbon in my coffee cup)
