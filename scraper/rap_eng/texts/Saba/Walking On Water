[Intro: Peter, Herschel & Saba]
Walking
Walking on water
Hey x10
See I’m just tryna catch my blessings
Walking on water
(Water, Water)
Ye-yuh x2

[ Verse 1: Saba]
Aye, Aye, Aye
On top of my flow
Like I'm walking on water
Got caught up with college
Held up like a hostage of häagen-dazs
I'm about the cream
Wish a nigga would like mahogany
They robbing you for pocket change
Or soccer game
The only time I saw the world summit
The world plummet
Why we just reflect on the days we get a girls number
I think ima earl vomit
I think that this world tarnished
I toast to rapping
Now I’m at at yo head like a girl bonnet
Nocturnal, honestly, I don't sleep
Ima keep one hundred
In the midst of it all that’s like a garden
From the land where you dark
Then you a target, we unapologetic
My head dreaded
I tried to tell em like Soulja boy or something
Go on tour or something
Instead of running away from the lord
We running towards ‘em
I did a lot more then they thought
And I'm [?] in the water
That Osmosis
I ain't dying

[ Hook: Peter]
No I ain't dying (no)
Keep on smiling (yes)
From beyond
The heavens
Loved ones
Sending down blessings
Blessings to
Whoever need them
Just like you (You, you, you)
Walking On Water
Walking on water
I want
To see you
Be happy

[ Verse 2: Peter Labeaud]
Look at what's been going on
Don't know if I can keep holding on
Little children victim to looking
The devil in the eyes
And stare him down
Can they crack a smile
Come on son
You gotta hold it down
You know you better than that
You know you have potential
I know you scarded
But never let them take your shine
It’s in your hands
No, no they cannot dim you now
Look, look what's in you now
But why is this inside of me, Tell me
How do you know that I have the power
What if I turn coward
And why they wanna kill us now
What's wrong with my skin pigments
We all the same
White black, black white
I'm back right where I started
End up a martyr, Will I or could I
Be the change that we need
I see that you could change the world
But you won't your afraid
You should be walking on water
I need you to follow your dreams
What they say shouldn't matter
So why are you drowning yourself
Tryna be what they want of you
To worried about the wrongs right
If my wrongs were right
Then I'm right back ehere I started
Worried if my life wrong (wrong)
Now tell me if my life wrong (wrong)
Now tell me that I can't
You can never tell me that a life wrong
Tell me that I can't dream
Tell me that I don't have the right to breath
You can't tell me that I can't be
Nobody’s nothing
I gotta prove something
I gotta prove something
Let me prove something
I ain't dying
I ain't dying
I refuse too


[ Peter’s Outro]
There’s something in the waters
There’s something in the waters
There’s something in the waters
When will I be (I don’t know)
When will I be (I don’t don’t know)
I don’t know
I don’t know
When will I ever know I
