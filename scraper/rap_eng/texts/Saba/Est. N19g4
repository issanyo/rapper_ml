[Produced by Such N Such]

[Verse 1: Saba]
Ah
Boy I’m riding with my niggas though
Come through like we royalty in purple, that’s that indigo
Hitting blocks till in the store
Such N Such, Save Mula
Saba saying PIVOT though, Pivotal
That’s enough hang it up, Mistletoe
They say you judged by the company you keep
Oh well word? Well I’m with real niggas, what do that make me?
Exactly, to a tee. That description is vivid
A product of my environment
Surrounded by the illest, PIVOT
Get ya muscle up, bodybuilder, Arnold
Louie how my Arms strong
Go in like a hard on
My flow hard core
Arkham asylum psychotic cottonmouth rhyming
With no prescription so I’m in
A straight jacket, beat jacking
And dreams valid
Boy I’m fleetwood mack
Yeah, the man with the plan like the blueprints
Beat the beat with two fist
Don’t play with em
Or ya fam in all black, no racism
Classical raps, I’m holding beethoven staff sheet
With an orchestra, yeah Saba leading the band geeks
Like Jimmy Jones fill your cups up with juices
The leader of the new school and y’all dudes too truant boy

[Hook: Jean Deaux]
Okay now
We got something all of y’all want
I’d like this time to propose a toast
For my niggas
This for my niggas

Showcasing talents for the streets like a charity
And all of the proceeds
To my niggas
This for my niggas

[Verse 2: Saba]
Uhhhhhh....
I’m looking to buzz
Your girl looking for love
And she looking at us
You looking around
As if it ain’t such
Such N Such saving it up
You spending it all
Get played like you dumb
But nigga you say she the one
My niggas above
More than just a rim
Like 2Pac Shakur
That 1994 hit
My bars at your forehead
Foreshadowing the scene
Just know there’ll be more dead
I’m counting casualties casually
Kill a bad emcee
I’m the sun to an asterisk
So y’all shine in the back of me
Like shadow clones
You never coming out like battered homes
My flow the cleanest, get my lather on
Yeah I scrub-a-dub
With Such N Such
And Jean Deaux, nigga that’s the cuz
And it’s for the love
Like a bone thug
And I ain’t on time
But I showed up with my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Saba]
Ah
Strictly for my niggas, Pac in ‘93 Find me
Cotton picking, no pot to piss in, that’s what the alley for
Locked behind padded walls and a padded door
That’s a small circle so I had to add some more
Cuz y’all my niggas (niggas)
Yeah this for all my niggas (nigga)
Change the vocab in one night (one night)
Y’all might all be right
Hey!

[With Jean Deaux]
But we’ll never go away (way)
Never go away (way)
Never go away (way)
Never go
