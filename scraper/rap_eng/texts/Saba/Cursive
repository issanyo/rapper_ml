[Verse 1]
And I put a few pounds on
Since I had my cap and gown on
Uh Aye tested out, no scantron
Bout to put my camp on
A&R checkin on my damn song
Mr. Chandler get them out yo head, dandruff
Little brother, city won't hand me down handcuffs
Grandson, your scholarship had been cancelled
Got that call but never answered, We out here like

[Verse 2]
My raps were never written neat
Scratch em out, and get a different sheet
Hear the beat, See I'm the epitome
Of a loser never had shit
But that's past tense, Ad-libs
How we rolling
Grind never stopped for a moment
From the ground up like a snow man
I'm your man to gamble on
Play my cards, I get my gambit on
From the bottom to the top, tag along

[Hook x2]
We after the globe
Y'all worried bout glow
We out chea on the low
(low, low)

Ain't worried bout y'all (At all)
Grind hard cuz this is all we know
(know, know)

[Verse 3]
Westside train bound
An all-star, hey now
An ongoing growing adolescence
With a way out
Penny for my thoughts, pitching coins on the playground
Pigeons shitting bricks, like this trap, not safe house
You've been targeted
And taught not to talk against
Those opposed, toblerone
No tolerance, chocolate
It's dark in the city
I arson the city
A spark from the pen and the pad and bet they all will come with me

[Verse 4]
My raps were never written neat
Scratch em out, and get a different sheet
Hear the beat, See I'm the epitome
Of a loser never had shit
But that's past tense, Ad-libs
How we rolling
Grind never stopped for a moment
From the ground up like a snow man
I'm your man to gamble on
Play my cards, I get my gambit on
From the bottom to the top, tag along

[Hook x2]
