[Mick Jenkins]
It's Free Nation
We just a couple of pimps, no ho's

Fuck you want? It's Mick Jenkins ho
Ion need yo opinions
My loafers laced with them Lincolns ho

[Hook]
Free my niggas, thatâ€™s Lincoln heaux!
From the first all the way to the 15th
Free my niggas, that's Lincoln heaux!
Free my niggas, that's Lincoln heaux!
Free my niggas

[Hook]
Screamin' free my niggas heaux
Free my niggas heaux
Free my niggas
Free my niggas heaux
Free my niggas heaux
Free my niggas
From the 1st all the way to the 15th
Free my niggas heaux, free my niggas heaux

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Move through the city like parkour
Cause the South side lookin like Darfur
I just keep my pace, young Paul George
They set traps and they call em traps and we fall for it
Free the guys
They just want dough, then pizza pies
Move through the city gotta keep it tough
If niggas want beef, then pizza puffs
But i oughta go dumb and you never will know
These niggas stay ready to blow
They more true to that then they are to they denim
These niggas is strapped like gibeau's
My niggas is trapped in a box
Protect yo soul like thick socks
My wrist watch go tick-tock
I tell them hoes to kick rocks
Fuck thirst traps, i pick locks & purse snatch
The midnight marauder
And pray to the Rock of Gibraltar
& prolly end up as a martyr
We parlay with all of these people
My niggas will prolly end up in yo daughter

Look at my city and tell me that shit look pretty
The southside is like a blemish, like country breakfast is gritty, ah
But everything is ivory
I feel like Indi-ah

[Verse 2: Saba]
Free my niggas, that Harriet
I'm the Tubman how i clean the streets
We work hard, we play hard
From the kindergarten to the third grade
To the graveyard shift to the graveyard
But you don't wanna be like they are
When you in they heart, cause you on they hearts
Cus yo face on it, spray paint on it
You talking about a break no graffiti
We talkin about a war peace treaty
We gettin paid in full  so we eatin
And we bump on GZC
And yell: FREE MY NIGGAS THAT'S LOCKED UP!
FREE MY NIGGAS THAT'S TRAPPED TOO!
Ay life's been a hassle since we turned our tassel
But I'm free man, free man
My own boss, I'm freelance
Ain't worried bout finance, cause we mobbin like vinance
Micheal Scofield, prison break on a break
Like im car stoppin im bar hopin'
Obviously im Paul Bunyan with lumber
Jack in a jacket, like cindy
Heat up like a hemi, heat up like I'm Penny
Hardaway to stay warm
The block is hot, the Wayne song
The block is hot, the napalm
The block will block ya one shot
Mutombo, you ball on blocks
You get dropped like a fumble nigga
You ain't heard the news better run lil nigga
Explicit, uncensored
So I don't need your opinion

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins & Saba]
Fuck you want? It's Mick Jenkins ho
That's Free Nation and Pivot
We savin up them lincolns ho
Free my niggas, that's Lincoln ho
From the first all the way to the 15th
Free my niggas, that's lincon heaux
Free my niggas, that's lincon heaux
Free my niggas

[Hook]

[Outro: Frsh Waters]
Frsh Waters man, a whole lotta splashing on yo daughters
Church
Elevation is the key, most of y'all dudes drowning out there, don't get ya feet wet B
As a matter fact, moving fast through the Sonic, y'all send behind like Tails; catch up
Still can't pinpoint the next checkpoint
Free
