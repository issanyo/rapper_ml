[Produced by Saba]

[Verse 1]
Yo Saba it's been a minute, you better, you benefited, is that what you thinkin' now?
The rapper you been committed, your woman she throwin' a fit like nigga you cheatin' now?
Just tell her keep it down, they try to take your dream and keep it down
I've been turnin' up like I beat the sound
I've been burnin' up if you do pounds
And my time is up I just mute the crowd
My nigga comin' home soon, he found
If you think you gettin' known soon, don't
I'm better than before
So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
Welcome home a doormat, they all facts, tell 'em niggas

[Bridge: Saba]
So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
Welcome

[Verse 2]
Yo, I walked in Def Jam on my 19th birthday, I can't recall my 18th
Came a long way since the days where we strolled like we homeless and loitered on State Street
I just pray that you get home safely, ironically the green line trained me
Cause I was softer than cotton startin' college something that here you can't be
Can't see them niggas gettin' on no time soon, we worried 'bout survival out here
Like where the hell I'm gonna get my food, nigga fuck your song I don't care
So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
Welcome home a doormat, they all facts, tell 'em niggas

[Bridge: Saba]
So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
Welcome

[Hook: Saba(3X)]
Pain make the best song, and the game made a stepson
But my heart can't be teflon, I feel everything and some
I got some issues and some, granny worried 'bout her grandson
I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing...nah

Welcome home (6X)
