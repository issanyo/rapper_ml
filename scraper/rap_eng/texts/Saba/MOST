[Verse 1]
Dance with the lights on
Snakes and a python, wrong with your haircut?
Hand on the bible
Stage with the light show, bed with the bedbugs
Check if the mic on
For the check that I sign on, tell me what I'm worth
Sleep when it's bedtime
Gave up the airtime, whole city graveyard

[Hook 1]
Most of these dudes played varsity ball
Now, most of these dogs in jail or they gone
Yeah, and most of me dogs call most women hoes
While most of the youth play most of the songs

[Verse 2]
Album got a deadline
Blog with a headline, always ahead line
Dapped in the Alpine
Whole city bedtime, most of us flatline
Most of us die young
Niggas been starvin', all of us diet
Ball with a ballpoint
Lie to the All-Knowing like he not all-knowing

[Hook 2]
Most of these dude don't wanna be thugs
But most of these news call most of us thugs
And most of these shooters be the boys in the blue
And most of these doors don't open and close

[Post-Hook]
Ay, most these niggas starve for so long, get a plate and
Forget to thank God, they forgot to say grace, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey (uh, uh, you can)
Mark my word, where I'm from isn't safe
(Mark my word, where I'm from isn't safe)
I'ma stay up out the Lawn
'Cause I don't want some snakes, hey
(I'ma stay up out the Lawn
'Cause I don't want some snakes, hey)
Most people, they were taught by the fake, hey
(Most who think they real, they were taught by the fake, hey)
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey
(Most these niggas hard, only want to be seen, 'een)

[Verse 3]
Ridin' with a new scent, chain like a new noose
Cop in the rear-view, save all your two cents
Try and catch me like Mewtwo, they'll be happy to shoot you
Life not some sitcom
Streamin' on Hulu, there's no one to the rescue
No one to defend you
They know that I've been through
What most of 'em been through

[Hook 3]
Most of the youth in love with a gun
'Cause most of the young don't wanna be young
And most of these dogs don't love anymore
We know where they go, like we readin' a palm

[Post-Hook]
Ay, most these niggas starve for so long, get a plate and
Forget to thank God, they forgot to say grace, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey (uh, uh, you can)
Mark my word, where I'm from isn't safe
(Mark my word, where I'm from isn't safe)
I'ma stay up out the Lawn
'Cause I don't want some snakes, hey
(I'ma stay up out the Lawn
'Cause I don't want some snakes, hey)
Most people, they were taught by the fake, hey
(Most who think they real, they were taught by the fake, hey)
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey
(Most these, niggas hard, only want to be seen, 'een)

[Skit: Chance The Rapper]
Yo, Chance The Rapper here
Uh, playin' drums
Learnin' how to play the drums
Has always been on my bucket list
Um, drummers just...they get the girl
