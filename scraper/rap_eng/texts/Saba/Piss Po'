[Verse 1: Frsh Waters]

Without a pot to piss in, I'm piss po'
Around my kitchen with the Crisco
Been on the flo, I need floricide
To watch the game you need more sides
Commentatin' with the commentators
Got comma chases and common haters
Which one is you?
Stop coming through like you showing love
Mothafucka' never fucked with us
Gotta watch who you trust
Room full of real niggas, where the fake niggas at?
Real recognize real
Still can't feel where they make niggas at
Finna take niggas back
To the Dream Team, Mike Jordan
Talkin' Scottie Pippen, three rings
That's before Houston or the Trailblazers
Gotta martyr them, before you honor him
Ain't gonna burden me I spit sermons
Certainly, surgically in certainties
Perfectly with no urgency
Cool as a fan on high, from the Chi, Westside
Where you do or you die in the conflict crucial
Smoking on hay now
Hanging now getting scummy where we used to
Hennessey straight on the rocks, gotta hold it in
Before I'm on the flow again
Motherfucker I'm supposed to win
When you close us in
Cat drown, you supposed to swim
Not a dollar late
Or a day short
Never take shorts, getting paid in full
Can't afford to lose, can't afford to snooze
Better wake up, get up, stand up
Band your mans up, before you enemies
Circle tight no fr-enemies
Mothafucka' ain't a kin to me

[Chorus: Frsh Waters]

No cats can't stand to see
Jean Deaux 'bout to canopy
I'm chillin' with the gang
We tight like a band of thieves

Gotta pay in advance
I don't know you from the land

How you drunk as hell and don't drink?
Acting dumb as hell
You don't think?
They gon' run and tell, throw yo' ass in jail
For a 6 to 30 and won't blink

[Verse 2: Jean Deaux]

I'm on the internet but I hopped in the thread
That's on my bank account, that's on my grandma house
I'm on my gingerbread
It's on my lady head, I be the wave that'll put you to river bed
Fucked up a figurehead, I got the smoke, that you can't stop with nicorette
My shit go infrared
Aiming with something that they ain't invented yet
He don't do balet
I make him do pirouettes, you get the lyrics
Yeah bitch, write the lyrics down
Even if you had to cite to bite the sound
I'ma body every mic' you think about
Only G's allowed, think aloud
It's an easy crowd
You see me now, but none'you wanna speak about
She had a dog, but I made her bring the freaky out
Roots in the dirty South, overrun the game
So I think I got a dirty mouth
Real niggas heard it right
When you get that word of mouth
Don Jon, I know you want some
Is [?] Juan, you know I like rum
Diamonds is so white, they live in my gums
And a rhyming it do fright, it's scaring my sons
[?] is so tight I stare at his lungs
I don't make bills if your money too young
Leave a nigga strung out, do you hear me?
Delete his number before we ever get busy
Shots on the relay, real niggas relay
Need a plus-one, 'cause I always keep it with me

[Chorus: Frsh Waters]

No cats can't stand to see
Jean Deaux 'bout to canopy
I'm chillin' with the gang
We tight like a band of thieves

Gotta pay in advance
I don't know you from the land

How you drunk as hell and don't drink?
Acting dumb as hell
You don't think?
They gon' run and tell, throw yo' ass in jail
For a 6 to 30 and won't blink

[Outro]
(Chorus)
