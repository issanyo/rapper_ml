[Verse 1]
Listening to [?]
Asking it who am I
Only time will tell like a cuckoo clock
Write letters to the mob enforcer
And I just want to be moved to god but still I
Ambitiously move like Diddy
Suburb through the city, I hustle like Nipsey
Keep it 100, I’m 100 and 50
So in every case Imma chase like Vinny
My head I’m bout to let em in
David, cosign this like letter head, paper
Vocab sharp and the pen is that razor
Still RA

[Hook]
And to you the main topic
Or you shine like the Arctic
I need you to be cautious
Cause they rhymes is toxic
Toxic, toxic
And when you the main attraction around the world like an atlas
Run rap till the capless
It’s up to you to kill the whackness, whackness
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Say this is gon get em pissed, flow is epitome
Truant so fill him in, with a pen
Like outlining, y’all was in the crib I was out rhyming
I’m ahead of my time, it’s
Cause I am hip hop’s heir
This halo, call it whack rap slayer
Got em running away like Roy Ayers
This real time like I’m Bill Meyers

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I say I’m going on a trip with no destination
I just need something that’ll get me farther than where space end
The sky is the limit, I’m a few steps past it
And impossible is nothing I believe like a catholic
Put your hands through the holes in my wrists
I want you to feel what I see
Look through my vision and you’ll
And understand the tongues that I speak in

[Hook]
