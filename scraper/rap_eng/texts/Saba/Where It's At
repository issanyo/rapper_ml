[Verse 2]
Turnin' location on (Yeah)
Turnin' location on, in this bitch cussin' 'cause it's not for radio
Pay me on the day you agree to pay me on
Golden like the team that KD on
They gotta hand out like achy bones
Heard that you burn those, and I don't mean cigs
Don't rattle on me, you receive what you bakin', home
Like tell her, it ain't shit you can tell us
My life gon' spoof just like Pusha-T, that mean No Malice
But we right back at it if they say New Balance or, Canada
This is the anthem, or janitor, now I'm a rapper
I didn't love college, no I was no extra
So I just dropped out, in the projects like catapult
Oh boy, like that's that boy
Where is he, where is he, you better tell the boy
'Cause when they tell the boy
My niggas'll take your legs, turn you to Brandon Roy
No I'm not the man that do it
But you best have it when you say you have it or
It's gon' be problems
Problems I'm not sure that you can endure

[Chorus]
Rise or shine, I come around (Ayy, yeah)
Peace of mind I finally found (Ayy, uh)
Where it's at, ho where it's at
Where it's at, ho where it's at (Ayy, uh)
Rise or shine, I come around (Ayy, yeah)
Peace of mind I finally found (Ayy, uh)
Where it's at, ho where it's at
Where it's at, ho where it's at (Ayy, yah)
