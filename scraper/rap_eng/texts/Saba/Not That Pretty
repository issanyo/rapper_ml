[Chorus: Saba]
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine

[Verse 1: Saba]
Pretty girls don't get my heart
Ugly girls don't get me hard
So I'm stuck with you
I guess you'll do
And I'll do you, I guess
Hey, maybe even one day soon
I mean you ain't bad but you ain't good
But it's all good, we got each other
Ain't worried 'bout you leaving 'cause I make you look better
And when I look at you I think I could do better
Like I know that I can not show you to friends
They'll probably laugh and get you depressed
I'm out your league, girl
Damn sure ain't my league, girl
You average but you sad and rich
On God, I need to raise my stance

[Chorus: Saba]
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine

[Verse 2: John Walt]
Stayed by my side 'til my deathbed
Nah, I can't lie, she was in the bad
[?] with some [?]
Try to grab a bite from the wrong hand
I did a shapeshift to a grown man
Matter fact you should check on the prophecy
[?] we should get you a proper seat
A proper beat is all I need, you feel me?
And I would go hard
I can just do what I said I would do
You was probably looking away when I said that I do
But thought it was okay 'cause that rating here
Minding you was only 'bout a eight
I'm 'bout a ten first, shawty girl you knew I had today
I'm going in 'cause my break is over
I spit hot venom like a snake or a cobra
Shawty is a ten, but not when I'm sober
I'm sober

[Chorus: Saba]
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine

[Verse 3: John Walt]
Super [?] 70's
Serenading in the seven seas
John Walt to the fifth power
You drifting sour and the past devours
All heart, y'all [?] like percentage
You know what the sin is worn by the Senate
[?], like this one for my homie, right?
Life is a bitch but you here to get your money, right?
Nice as a kid but he had to get that money right
Sharp like a hunted knife, scarred like a [?]
Shining like armor you under
[?] like thunder, my willy make her wonder, I [?]
Know I did that ass then I pumped her
Ask how I called you and phrased you, pause my piphet
Then leave you in the back
Showed her my Adidas then I tell her take that
Take that

[Chorus: Saba]
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
Long as she fuckable
I-I don't care if she that fine
