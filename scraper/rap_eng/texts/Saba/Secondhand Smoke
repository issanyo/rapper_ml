[Hook: Noname Gypsy & Saba]
How about me you and them
Steal the lungs to the top of our endings?
C'est la vie, say you love me
Smoke for me, smoke for me

[Verse 1: Saba]
Uh
Saba got them secondhand smoke raps
I feel like a second citizen in my own land
Uh, my neighbor got shot in the ass
And I was probably seconds away from that
Uh, I'm six feet with a second inch
Sorry I'm rambling, I needed a second to vent
Uh, cause I don't really think I know how
And I don't really think "she" is the proper pronoun
To describe the town that turned into a window
Hopes and dreams, beliefs and things, that all thrown out the window
Scrambling and people screaming, we look out the window
Cause me and Walter just thought it was fireworks
I mean it is like July second, it feels like July second
It's hot like July fourth
And off contact, my eyes sore
But my contacts still wanted see everything but the lord
The only view I knew needed a vice
And I needed advice, fuck that I needed a christ
Cause, I only pray I can do numbers on the internet
And that they don't think I'm too intricate
But that they can accept my ignorance
I wasted my time on her, she probably owe me a year
I don't owe ya'll shit but I feel ya'll owe me an ear
Uh, yo I be up and I can't lounge
Secondhand smoke, hear the blunts in the background

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The second guess is as good as the first one right?
I figure I would give it life
Waiting on the second coming he a second late
So why not drop my second tape?
