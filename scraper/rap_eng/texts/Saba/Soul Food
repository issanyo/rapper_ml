[Chorus, Elujay + female]
Hands up don’t shoot
I know you want to
Rolling up that Keyshia Cole
I got that soul food
I got that soul food
I got that soul food
You know you want to
Come try the soul food
Hands up don’t shoot (don’t shoot me baby)
I know you want to
Rolling up that Keyshia Cole (ahhh)
I got that soul food
Come try that soul food
You know you want to (soul food)
You know you want to (know you want to)
Soul food

[Bridge, Elujay]
You know you want to
You know you want to
Want to

[Verse 1, Elujay]
Yeah, I don’t know what I’ve been sipping
Everything just feel so great
Nowadays feeling so dismissive
Find it hard to concentrate
My homie just got outta Rita
Fuck the judge oh fraudulent case
Why the system gotta be that way
Why they cut your years better days
Cus I just wanna celebrate
Freedom on vacation (turn up)
One nation and they got a system that’s fugazi
Everybody tryna get it how they live
Nowadays niggas can’t count to they kids
That EDT with no food in the fridge
And they tryna get it back to the 1st to the 5th

[Verse 2, Elujay]
I smoke that Rosa Parks
That shit don’t make you move
That molly make you groove
We in a different mood
Can you pass the yams
Can you pass the peas
Man I’m bout to slam
Play that soulful jam
Soulful jams
Slam food that’s the only plan


[Chorus, Elujay + female]
Hands up don’t shoot
I know you want to
Rolling up that Keyshia Cole
I got that soul food
I got that soul food
I got that soul food
You know you want to
Come try the soul food
Hands up don’t shoot (don’t shoot me baby)
I know you want to
Rolling up that Keyshia Cole (ahhh)
I got that soul food
Come try that soul food
You know you want to (soul food)
You know you want to (know you want to)
Soul food


[Verse 3, Saba]
Ah, fuck the system I’m still screaming
Free my pivot members, ‘member
When we couldn’t get a sip from
The fountain it feel like that again
Guinness book of records
They shoot niggas knock on wood
It’s not my future, fuck a pig
They dug a grave another kid again
Turn the cheek attention hus
They locked my nigga and his son
The penitentiary is just a thing they say is meant for us
Black on black is faithless fucking fact
The facts we’ll fuck you up and
Rap is just a product of what they made me with the handcuffs
Yo, why we gotta protest and say our lives matter
They claim they serve and protect but somehow we all dying faster
I watched a video and they look just like some line backers
They lie about it, a child got hit
The news look like the old bits for the bystanders
