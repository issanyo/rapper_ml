[Intro]
Boodah
On the Westside I'm screamin' fuck KD, fuck 'em
Pivot, Pivot

[Verse 1]
We don't really give no fuck bout employment
We just wanna chill like Kelso and Forman
Find acid boring we capitalize on capital lets get more of it
Sure as shit young nigga shirly temp
Curly coil, dreadlock early lint
Natural, earthly shit
Dropping classics, and to think about it this my early shit
And tell them niggas get from round me
I'm from the hood you fucking townie
Your girl she want me I got bounties
And free my nigga up in county
Oh no we on it it won't be long
We moving in silence but gonna make the story known
Support it you want me gone take over Napoleon
I heard that it was levels I move like a Corleone

[Hook]
Nigga west side (bound)
Riding (around)
Grinding so hard I bet my momma (proud)
All the fraudulent artist I'm all you can (count)
On like I'm wanted that's all I can (count)
Awkward (encounters)
Turns on the bars on the rise like a lounge
I'm out of (town)
Give her dap give her (pound)
Like a dog in a (pound)
Stomp imma stomp like Kirk in a church (gown)

[Verse 2]
This is the one that they missed in from a young mystic
Gettin' busy cause I'm about business
Rap fictitious, classmates dissing
Change the next day and now it's classmates wishing
For kisses like PDA
Stand on thin line like YouMedia
Came a long way since them hard ways
Now prolly sell out the venue if it's all age
And prolly like everyday holiday no off days
I forget I sleep when I'm dead and I don't plan on dying
City behind me like a predecessor better catch up know who next up
Better them them bitch it's our time
With them X's on your hand at the entrance ay?
Superhero shit the black (Finn & Jake)
Adventure Time hella in a rhyme
It's '03 I feel like Killa Cam

[Hook]

[Bridge (2X)]
Ridin' like I fell in love
Separate, come back and then regroup
Looking out the window
I swear everything's a blur we just be cool

[Outro]
Westside (bound)
Riding (around)
Griding so hard I bet my father (smile)
Looking at his son like my nigga you are (bound)
To be the next one to make it (out)
Chi is defined by the violence
Lifeless lives loss I've seem to lost (count)
But nevermind they never (found)
I'm on the grind, I never (hound)
