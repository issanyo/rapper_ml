[Chorus]
See she's telepathic
Call it black girl magic
Yeah she scares the government
Deja Vu of Tubman

[Verse 1]
We go missing by the hundreds
Ain't nobody checkin' for us
Ain't nobody checkin' for us
The camera loves us, Oscar doesn't
Ain't nobody checkin for us
Ain't nobody checkin for us
They want us in the kitchen
Kill our sons with lynchings
We get loud about it
Oh now we're the bitches

[Verse 2]
Look at what they did to my sisters
Last century last week
They put her body in a jar and forget her
They love how it repeats
Look at what they did to my sisters
Last century last week
They make her hate her own skin
Treat her like a sin

[Pre-Chorus]
But what they don't understand
But what they don't understand
But what they don't understand is
But what they don't understand
See what they don't understand

[Chorus]
See she's telepathic
Call it black girl magic
Yeah she scares the gov'ment
Deja Vu of Tubman

[Refrain]
And she she she she she
Don't give up
Yea yea yea yea yea
She don't give up
She don't don't don't don't don't give up
No no no no no
She don't give up

[Verse 3]
Rosa was a freedom fighter
And she taught us how to fight
Ella was a freedom fighter
And she taught us how to fight
Audre was a freedom fighter
And she taught us how to fight
Angela was a freedom fighter
And she taught us how to fight
Sojourner was a freedom fighter
And she taught us how to fight
Assata was a freedom fighter
And she taught us how to fight
Rosa was a freedom fighter
And she taught us how to fight
Ella was a freedom fighter
And she taught us how to fight

[Chorus]
See she's telepathic
Call it black girl magic
Yeah she scares the gov'ment
Deja Vu of Tubman

[Post-Chorus]
But what they don't understand
But what they don't understand
But what they don't understand
See what they don't understand
