[Verse 1]
Yeah, ayy, uh
Fingers in her mouth like Mr. Socko
Just a slim thick nigga sellin' fifty (ayy)
All my niggas posted like we Grove Street
Even though my street cred Selena Gomez
Shoot my shot like Bart
At the Kwik-E-Mart
Every time I eat a ass
I leave a hickey mark
No, I don't do porn
You've been misinformed, yeah
I'm a unicorn
I don't fit the the norm, ayy
[?]
Spent the whole day up in FYE, ayy
Next person step to me
Gon' get they mufuckin' pedigree
Joseph and Sab got the recipe
That's 'cause we always put that shit on LMN
Fuck every movie they make about Egypt
They never let them have no melanin

[Hook]
Ayy, ayy, always put that shit on LMN
Ayy, ayy, always put that shit on LMN
Ayy, ayy, always put that shit on LMN
Ayy, ayy, always put that shit on LMN

[Verse 2]
Fingers in her mouth like I'm Cactus Jack
I just did a bath bomb singing back to black, ayy
When I'm splashin', nigga
You hear passion, nigga
Want to keep me to yourself just like a ration, nigga, ayy
I don't trust the media, just Wikipedia, ayy
Just got back from Trinidad, I flew Expedia, yeah
I been yelling "Austin" like I'm [?] man
I come from a crazy place you'll never visit, man, ayy
Westside get the money
Like CJ from San Andreas
My momma shoot you like Sara Palin
My blood is holy like
I brought guacamole from Guatemala
Do you have a dolla I could borrow for the brothel
We donatin' water bottles out the squad
[?]
We can never be role models

[Hook]
Ayy, ayy, always put that shit on LMN
