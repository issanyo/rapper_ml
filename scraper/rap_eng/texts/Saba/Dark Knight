[Verse 1: Saba]
Some days I don’t wanna blow up
It’s getting kinda harder to ignore like I caught it in the 4th
Down 2 and if I miss this shot we goin home
Gotta watch out for the folks
Round u now these niggas hopping of porch and they getting booked no other way to put
First day in the jam spilled the water on the plug
Call a nigga cuz call a nigga bro
Ain’t no fam in the land of the free once you caught
I grew up repeat what I was taught
I know kids who packaging the..
I can’t put that rap into a quote
I’m just tryna kick out with bro nem
I know god exist but I don’t know him
Look my..
My mama said don’t do drugs
The Bible said don’t you judge
I was on the 91 Austin bus out hustling sell that salt to slugs while I was on my way to school
Innocent inner city youth now coming to a city near you
Nigga peel back if you wanna meet me where the truth is
Still trapped but they wanna give you the illusion..

[Verse 2: Amir]
On god.. ain’t seen his ass in a minute
Just some lil niggas running round with some tools acting like gods
Acting like us getting even with them is really us beating the odds
I see life in the blood of my stains
Don’t see shit when I stare at the stars
Just some niggas that’s flexing on gram
Got my girl even waking early on Sunday she pray I’m not losing my balance
Mind like a jail just niggas in cells I let this shit out when its overcrowded
If I tell you it’s there you ain’t gotta count it
Paid in full like Ace
Run the city with no brakes
Running shit with no ASICS
Guess it’s back to the basics
I was the outcast bumping on OutKast
Trapped in the trap in the basement
Hoping these tracks in my head was gon save me
Now I trade verses with Saba damn near rewriting the Bible
Charlie’s angel with me when I’m full throttle
When my city signal know that I Gotham

[Refrain: Amir]
Dark Knight (x9)
Move in all black like the Dark Knight
Trapping out packs in the Dark night
The city know I Gotham like the Dark Knight
Driving down Wacker like the Dark Knight

[Outro: Amir]
Dark Knight (x10)
Yea
Dark Knight (x2)
Yea, ugh
