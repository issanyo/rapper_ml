[Verse 1]
We should restart
If you’re catching my drift
I don’t know who you are
How’d we end up like this?
You don’t hear me at all
My Charmeleon evolved

[Hook]
And now you got the
Heart of a bank robber
No, please, don’t shoot
Always in the ear shot of
Eaves droppers (repeat)

[Verse 2]
Need a response
Will you hear my request
To play a different song?
I like your old shit the best
You don’t hear me at all
My Charmeleon evolved

[Hook]

[Verse 3] (Saba)

While they were pokemon going and hoeing
I hoped that I'd land in your heart unlike Owen
I’m all in, this poker. My pokedex knew ya
The older ya got well the lesser I know ya
You owe it to yourself to know yourself
At least you didn’t let go yourself
When we apart thats like growing pains
I knew it all could change, I ain't expect to
Can’t say I ever knew who you were
Who woulda thought what I had to lose
Got me like a camera crew
How I watched you evolve
While I’m watching your feelings for me dissolve
Like I’m watching a pilot I seen before
But I’m knowing that this used to be our show
When the seasons over, is our season over?
Are you keeping it A1 like hemoglobin
Or you being bogus?
Love is not temporary from the Ben and Jerry
To the Cemetery thats the first date to the last one
Everything in between like preliminary
When you enter every room that I’m in
But you acting like I don’t exist
Is it cause you think we should split?
Or probably cause I shoulda pressed…
