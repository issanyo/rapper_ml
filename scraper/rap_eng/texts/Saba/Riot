[Intro: Trapo]
We take pay for a living
Yell "Gang" and lust for fame
Across criminalized changing
Don't feel the same, it's all different
I cock aim to give me a name with my niggas, no shame
Been working for days in my swisher, need propane
Believing that haze, I'm off liquor
I drive fast, I'm hoping I crash, I feel tempted

[Verse 1: Trapo]
You better breathe nigga
No time to panic, just open the safe
I got the cannon and blowing away
It's been a real long time since I got these figures
I treat you like this and put one to the face
'Cause sharing the profits won't get me away
And I won the race, damn
Murderer, Trapo's a murderer
You backload to reload the burner cuz
I don't know what you wrote to learn from us
It's good dope for my folk to burn with us
I swear I'm so lost in this cloud
Can't lie, I be searching the net on the daily
And I own like most of the sounds
If I never rapped in my fashion, this shit would not matter
You wouldn't be around
Turn up in the function, made love to the crowd
I started with nothing, abusing my clout

[Hook: Trapo]
Let's make this quick, I don't like talking on the phone
I don't ever dream of death, well just sometimes when I'm alone
If they rob me for my breath
Please seek revenge, I was too young
I don't ever count my steps, just live my life till it's no more (right)
I was thinking about this girl I used to know
Named Ashi, she did me great now she don't get another song
Oh my God, I feel so great, so straight, this tree's so fucking strong
I get drunk, I make a song, now I can't trust another hoe

[Bridge: Trapo]
They like damn Trap, how do you do it?
So young and so focused, my crew we smoke dope to your music
You rap about drinking and driving, and stealing and robbing
It's stunning, you're such an influence
From the label, we love what you doing
You should sign and get paid while you do it
From the-

[Verse 2: Saba]
Yuh
You better breathe nigga
So many enemies, I feel like Kennedy
Rolling with Connelly, going Sean Connery, come and kill me nigga
You doing comedy, I can't accommodate, it's been a real long day
I've been a real chill nigga
Empty the clip, empty the bank
Dark like a pit and sharp as shank
Swim with the fish and walk the plank
All of the kids is off the dank
All of my niggas hard to take
A life for two, and I pursue
Starving artists riot too
Look at you, this guy's a goof
Fuck the function up then poof
I don't like parties, I'm anti-social
They told me speak more, to be more vocal
If we gon' global then we don't know them no more
Than we know popo
I don't know popo so, we don't know your whereabouts
Just like Marco Polo
AutoZone hoes, I whip it 'til the wheel fall off
And the car get totaled
I'm Grand Theft Auto, me Chicago, me Trapo
Me spaz on any given
Run you all off, but you can't call no one
We be hardest in 3D mention
Label want my single, pick another one, ayy
Ain't no I in team, and ain't no ho up in my blood, yeah
