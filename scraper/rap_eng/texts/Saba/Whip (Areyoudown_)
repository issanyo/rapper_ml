[Verse 1]

Seventeen livin' out a dream while these niggas want to sleep, sleep
Seventeen I'mma steal the keys while my mama go and sleep, sleep
Seventeen with a new love for the streets, streets
Seventeen hitin' seventy on the highway, highway
Cause you just want to see outside
But the bus don't run this late at night
Oh how lovely it'd be to take you for a ride
In the streetlight your face glows
Backin' out the driveway (driveway)
One hundred on a highway (highway)
A youngin' on a joy ride (joy ride)
And I hope that they don't find me (find me)
I know my mom will never find out (find out)
If she isn't awake by now (by now)
I'mma whip it 'til it's light out (light out)
Shit I just grabbed the keys like I'm out

[Hook]

And about in the whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip
Out in the whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip

[Verse 2]

Seventeen livin' out a dream while these niggas still sleep, sleep
Seventeen I'mma steal the keys while my mama go and sleep, sleep
Seventeen with a new love for the streets, streets
Seventeen hittin' seventy on the e-way, e-way
Backin' out the driveway (driveway)
One hundred on a highway (highway)
I whip it on a Wednesday (Wednesday)
Watch how I treat it like it's Friday (Friday)
A youngin' on a joy ride (joy ride)
Called my lady, I'mma slide, just enjoy the ride
I cannot complain with life since it's goin' right
But if we caught then we goin' down for the night
Her memory resemble the mileage
Don't let mama find out, she would trip about it
I went for a trip paid for by my allowance
I'm loud as a mouse then out the house
And I'm out on the town and I swear
I whip like I'm Kunta
That whip like too crucial
Cause you just want to see outside
But the bus don't run this late at night

[Hook]
Out in the whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip
Are you down to trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip

[Outro]
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
