[Verse 1]
Luminous breaths in the dark time
And I laugh as we go down, down
As we go down, down, down
It's settled we are each other's
Meadow of lust, meadow of lust
In a Meadow of trust
You've become my secret
I like it when we get lost
The way you go deeper
Nothing else matters more
The way you go deeper
The way you go deeper
The way you keep going deeper now
Nothing else matters more

[Hook]
Big bright lights
But the room so dark
How it feels when we lay
Will you take me all the way?
Will you take me all the way?
