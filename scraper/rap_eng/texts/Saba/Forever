[Verse 1: Noname]
Miss Nina Simone, Jimmy Jones, Missy Elliott
Musically, they're my relatives, never forget my André
Papí, mi casa es su casa, baby I made an entrée
Maybe I make your mom's plate, maybe we not gon' sleep tonight
In the night you and I laugh about how you Gemini
Already fried the chicken but leftovers was my inner thigh
Nah I'm lying, I'm just playing, you can read this book with me
I'm trying to re-imagine abracadabra from poverty
Like "poof," I made it disappear, proof I'm made of happiness
Everything is everything, but I still haven't paid my rent
Ugly is ugly, so molly makes them joyful now
When I get down, I'm already up
Molly the water, I keep the drink in the cup
My druggy is druggy, we just some kids out of luck
Ooooh they ain't tryna' see me shine my shine
A bullet on my time, my time, fuck it, I'll live forever now

[Chorus: Noname & Ravyn Lenae]
They ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time, but fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't trying to see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time, but fuck it, we'll live forever
Forever in a day, follow in the rain
You know that we live foreverHow long will it take?To marry the sunset
If it ain't us yet forever

[Verse 2: Noname]
I sold my name for seven bags of Skittles on Sunnyset Boulevard
Please tell me God is rainbow pretty
Mystery and fully charged
Nobody understands my songs
Aloe vera sentences to heals the scars
Of rental cars to Malibu to Shangri-La
Ooh, my cigarette burning, my momma be calling
She worry about me, her girl alcoholic
And I can take a trip to L.A
And I can lose myself inside myself
I hope the Lord forgive me now
Why I still be thrifting, accustomed to wearing hand-me-downs
Why my Cinderella a cinder block for my family now
I can't build no mansion on top of these shaggy bones
I left my home I'm on, the road forgive me
There she go again, her dark consumerism
Assimilated in him, cash the new gospel
Occupational sin, just walked out of the church house
With happy all in my pocket, a little something to spend

[Chorus: Noname & Ravyn Lenae]
They ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time, but fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't trying to see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time, but fuck it, we'll live forever
Forever in a day
Follow in the rain, you know that we live forever
How long will it take? To marry the sunset
If it ain't us yet forever

[Verse 3: Joseph Chilliams]
We gon' live forever like Aaliyah; look how they did Rekia
Honestly I'm just happy I can be here
Hoping I don't offend all my peers
When I say that ass is a mouthful like kujichagulia
Following bright ideas, 'cause I'm a victim to colorism
They flood the prison, no difference hanging from trees
When they gon' leave the system I notice we still ain't free
In this club trying to ban me 'cause my white tee
I mean like high key, I was chosen to fight in a pair of Mikes
Over polite holding a knife
They hold my life in low regards hoping I'm hopeless
But I've been in love for so long like Janet Jackson
Poems, I know I'm terrible but I'm focused like a variable
Emitting pheromones so I don't got to bear it alone
Nina Simone biopic made me swear at my home
Gotta call someone so I can tell them on my telefone

[Chorus: Noname & Ravyn Lenae]
They ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time, but fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't trying to see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time, but fuck it, we'll live forever
Forever in a day
Follow in the rain, you know that we live forever
How long will it take? To marry the sunset
If it ain't us yet forever
