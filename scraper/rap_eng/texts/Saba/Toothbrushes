[Verse 1]
Eatin' black people food, gettin' sleepy
I just wanna have mouth sex like toothbrushes
At a church pew this old white lady think I'm cute as two buttons
So I move closer
If I knew Hova'
I'd try to fuck Beyonce
Or at least get her to sign my new poster
In high school, my nickname was laid back
I'm chill as fuck
Because Ion give no fuck
I used to be a virgin
I'm not not mo'
Now I'm real
I feel like the man of steel
If I get cut
I don't bleed, my veins' chill

[Chorus]
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your lil handgun 'til you run out
Or you can run for your back-up
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up, back up
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your lil handgun 'til you run out
Or you can run for your backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up, back up

[Verse 2]
Eatin' black people food, gettin' sleepy
I just wanna have mouth sex like toothbrushes
At a church pew this old white lady think I'm cute as two buttons
So I move closer
If I knew Hova'
I'd try to fuck Beyonce
While he babysat Blue Sky
Please keep that between you and I
While I'm twerking in the parking lot of U of I
If you ain't fuckin' with this pimpin' shit then you a lie
I know you is, I could show your kids some shit
Rap good enough to receive corporate benefits
I still need healthcare
Not trynna get forgotten like Sebastian Telfair

[Chorus]
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your lil handgun 'til you run out
Or you can run for your back-up
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up, back up
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your lil handgun 'til you run out
Or you can run for your backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up, back up

[Verse 3]
I'm not a gangsta'
Not even trying to be
I just always felt like Ja Rule was lyin' to me
Get rich or die tryin'
I'm a zombie, I need as many chances I can get to be what Imma be
Tossin' salt shakers over my right shoulder
I need as much luck I can get
Hopefully I get lucky
Like I'm fuckin'
I don' sacrificed too much shit to end up with nothin'

[Chorus]
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your lil handgun 'til you run out
Or you can run for your back-up
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up, back up
When that window roll down and that AK come out
Or you can run for your backup
