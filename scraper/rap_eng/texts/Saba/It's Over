[Refrain]
Beware of the people searching
Strangers in the afternoon seeking your true intentions
Despair I know that you’ll see me soon
I know I’ll be there by the morning
I know that I’ll be there soon
I know I’ll be there by the morning
Legend of the night who are you now
What’s the reason for this uncertainty

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I can take my time, we can take it slow
I can take you high, you can take it low
We can make it right, I’ll be your space to grow
Whatever’s on your mind let it take control
Let it set you free but hold on to your soul
Evaluate yourself rely on what you know
Yeah, don’t be scare to take a chance, who gon tell you no
Get on your own, you that you got it you seen it all before
You seen it all before, failure is just apart of facing every problem
Don’t let go of options try it until you prosper
Hope until you conquer, don’t believe in falling
Leap before you fall and don’t neglect the calling, yeah

[Hook]
And now that I’m sober
I know that everything gon be okay
And whenever it’s over
I know that everything in life do change
And now that I’m sober
I know that everything will be okay
And whenever it’s over
I know that everything in life do change (3x)
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 2]
What if love ain’t have no rules?
What if pain ain’t last so long?
What if heaven ain’t seem so far?
What if sin ain’t seem so wrong?
What if your mind never produced fear?
What if faith couldn’t feel so strong?
What if every time things got rough I couldn’t grab you by da heart and hold on?
I'm tired of bullshit, I can't stomach the fraud and the lies no more
We live in a world where it's sin over prayer
And niggas barely look to da sky no more
We losing our minds and swallow our pride
Like faith don't exist and hope ain't alive
If Stevie could see a ribbon in da sky
Than I know you can wake up before your demise, yeah

[Hook]
And now that I’m sober
I know that everything gon be okay
And whenever it’s over
I know that everything in life do change

[Bridge] Do you ever wonder why you bite your tongue
You’re drowning under unspoken words
And yesterday is gone
Follow me babe
Don’t be so uncertain
Lilacs bloom in your doom
Show me why the long face (2x)

[Refrain]
Beware of the people searching
Strangers in the afternoon seeking your true intentions
Despair I know that you’ll see me soon
I know I’ll be there by the morning
I know that I’ll be there soon
I know I’ll be there by the morning
Legend of the night who are you now
