[Intro]
Ah
Ayy, yeah

[Chorus]
All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science, yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous, yeah, I get so excited
All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science, yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous, yeah, I get so excited
I be on the road, 'nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go, then all I could do is wait
I said, I be on the road, 'nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go, then all I could do is wait (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse]
Look, heard your shit, it is not fire
New shit coming like a tidal wave
Been in that booth like five whole days
Chicago survival rate
I'ma keep it jazz like Johnny 'Trane
Y'all niggas countin' her bodies lame
Saba like SÃ¡bado Gigante, ayy
But I drop hits like Johnny Cage
Stage dive nigga, no shirt, red alert
And I'm from the same city, like Dirk, can't revert
To the same shit that make a baby burp
All gas, no brakes if a boy wanna skrrt
Her favorite rapper Cardi so she told me "Okurr"
And if I'm at a party then I bet I'm dippin' first
I don't wanna judge, no this is not church
But if she wanna touch, the decision hers
I mean, dancing another planet, Richard Branson

[Chorus]
All the baes on me, they biased
Put a few pounds, no diet
Got this shit down to a science, yeah, I get so excited
I do not need no diamonds
She do not need no vices
We do not wait, not righteous, yeah, I get so excited
I be on the road, 'nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go, then all I could do is wait
I said, I be on the road, 'nother dollar, 'nother day
If she tell me not to go, then all I could do is wait
