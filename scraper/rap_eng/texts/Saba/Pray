[Verse 1]

Please be careful when you roll that
Its kinda hard not to smell that shit
And I gotta a whole O we can blow that
Fuck that
I'mma sell that shit
But y'all niggas can function on this 3.5
I'm beaming
Like every shot from the 3 point line
Its aim
While you can fore I reach my demise
Its grab a couple of thighs while I teach with my guys
Cuz we only ever pray
Cuz we know bread comin'
Only feel like prey
Cuz we know lead comin'
In a city full of hoes
And you know head comin'
Why we always jumping through hoops
These assumptions and coupes
The only things these gold diggers appeal to
My fake side mo' real than the real you
Ass so enchanting
Ass so distracting
She asked where to catch me
I said out in traffic

[Hook]

Lord bare with me
I'm just tryna make a way
Young G prosper
I know you see my faith
Life of a predator I pray everyday
When I'm yellin' upstairs man
This is what I say
Thank you for the guys
Thank you for the vision
Thank you for the fam
Thank you for the mission
And thank you for the shorty
That I just met in mass
With the word
And you can't forget the ass
Amen

[Verse 2]

Henny on Henny
Be my Elixir
Lord be my Shepard
I think with my zipper
Granddaddy gone
So I look at this pictures
Game that he gave me
Prevent any hiccups
Its me and the gods
Dealing with Satan
Interior clean
No ceiling and daytons
Head while I smoke
Feel like I made it
Also a giant
My sibling a Payton
Every play a hail mary
I'm living within hysterics
Stop bumping Niggas in Paris
Cuz' Niggas wasn't in Paris
And arguing with my parents
Tryna thug through the summer
Engine died in my carriage
R.I.P. to Impala
A real nigga had cherished
These birds repeat what they hear
Stuff wifin' these parrots
Lately its been apparent
My money make me breath easy
But why it make me feel queasy
When I see mo' niggas
Making money on the tv
Tell my niggas to get em
And give it to the needy
Needy being my clique
The heavens can't feed me
I'm blessed my nigga
Yes my nigga
Tryna build a brand
An Architect my nigga
Cottage Grove Hov
And Coresh my nigga
I'll throw a million hands
You disrespect my nigga
If I had the racks
I'll probably build a tower
So my nigga can go to heaven
And see his Mom for a hour

[Hook]

Lord bare with me
I'm just tryna make a way
Young G prosper
I know you see my faith
Life of a predator I pray everyday
When I'm yellin' upstairs man
This is what I say
Thank you for the guys
Thank you for the vision
Thank you for the fam
Thank you for the mission
And thank you for the shorty
That I just met in mass
With the word
And you can't forget the ass
Amen
