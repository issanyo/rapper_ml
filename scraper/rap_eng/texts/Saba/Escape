[Verse 1: Jean Deaux]
Gravel on the floor
I love it when you come in dirty
Put your shackles on the floor
I know you're always more than worthy
Lean in close your eyes
Have you ever felt paradise
Well its always been in your mind
Did you ever wanna get away?
You're scott-free baby you ain't gotta stay
Rain pours on our stained floors, in our rain forest
And the sky leaks
And the angels fall
Did you ever seen it?
Have you ever mean it?
For the better genius
Inhale the fireflies and let your stomach rage
Your hands are all you need just let me be your page
I'll never be your cage
Dont believe in mistakes
Just let me be your escape

[Hook]
I can get you high
High off love, off life, off death, off crack and meth
If that's all you wanted
I can get you high
High off sky, off land, off sea, off shrooms and weed
If thats all you wanted

[Verse 2: Saba]
Ah
Kept you a secret
I whisper when I pray
My demonic desires
For this angelic phase
Can drive me out the head
That my hair on
Come save you're my heroine
Hold me when you ascend
You a sin, you heroine
Runaway
My underground railroad's in a vessel to your heart
You're my drug and I'm in vein
Help me recreate
My first love
My first time
My first drug
My first high
My first nod
My first flight of them 12 steps that we walked up
We're one story apart
I slave to you like Aesop
My fable written
You erased it
Life get real and we escape it
With numb tongues we french kiss
We sleep together on my death bed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jean Deaux]
You got the demons that keep running round
Love it when I come around
Hate it when you coming down
Never wanna turn around
Sometimes when you burn an ounce
It put your sorrows on the ground
You got the demons that keep running round
Love it when I come around
Hate it when you coming down
Never wanna turn around
I see her in your eyes
I know you feeling stuck
Take some more its not enough

I can get you high
(I can get you high)
High off love, off life, off death, off crack and meth
( I can get you high)
If that's all you wanted
( I can get you high ooh)
I can get you high
( I can get you )
High off sky, off land, off sea, off shrooms and weed
(I can get you, I can get you oh)
If thats all you wanted
(oooh, whoa.)

If thats what you want from me
I can get you high
I can get you
I can get you
