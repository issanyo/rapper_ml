[Intro: Jamila Woods]
Day, dai do dai do, dai do day
Day, dai do dai do, dai do day

[Verse 1: Jamila Woods]
I be in my nightgown, chicken wings ready
If you bring the mild sauce, we can go steady
You can have the coleslaw, we can share the one straw
Sit outside on my block

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
Day, dai do dai do, dai do day
O-on Emerald Street where we used to meet, yeah
Day, dai do dai do, dai do day
On my ma's porch seat hoping she won't see, yeah
Day, dai do dai do, dai do day
It's a wonderful day in the hood
Would you be mine, could you be mine
Won't you be my neighbour, won't you be, won't you be (Would you be mine, could you be mine)
Won't you be my neighbour, won't you be, won't you be (Would you be mine, could you be mine)
Won't you be my...

[Verse 2: Jamila Woods]
Not a lot of places we can go to be together
'Coz you know the city, how'd it get so cold
Write a message in a bottle tell your neighbour tell your God and somebody should remember them

[Verse 3: Saba]
You got my house phone jumping
Play ball in the alley it's jumping
Treat the corner store likes it's a luncheon
I heard your best friend like-like my cousin
Old lady say to stay out her grass
Talk back then I got put on punishment
Couldn't go outside for a meal
Even try to run away like I'm Tubman
I know you like my bike it's a Huffy
With the pen we be stuntin'
Someone stole it I call shorty
He say he seen someone on it
Got it back the same night
I hope this day never end
Then I tell you how I like you, you say that we were just friends
Damn

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
Day, dai do dai do, dai do day
O-on Emerald Street where we used to meet, yeah
Day, dai do dai do, dai do day
On my ma's porch seat hoping she won't see, yeah
Day, dai do dai do, dai do day
It's a wonderful day in the hood
Would you be mine, could you be mine
Won't you be my neighbour, won't you be, won't you be (Would you be mine, could you be mine)
Won't you be my neighbour, won't you be, won't you be (Would you be mine, could you be mine)
Won't you be my...
