(Chorus-Samaria)
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
How can I replay, all the joy you gave
Memories of us, will never fade away
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day

(Verse 1-Moe)
A part of me died, you'd be lyin if you told me that I'd be your right
My soul cried but my eyes had to stay dry
Bein strong for your moms when she ask me why, why
I wondered too but I can't question God's actions
They say it happens for a reason and I should be happy
This wishful thinkin got me feelin like a soul at ease
I hope you got your soul right before you had to leave
If not God forgive him for his sins please
He know not what he did walkin as a deed
But if my prayer's in vain, I sacrifice me
He had a rough life, he need a smooth eternity
You chased for currency it worried me I never said it
The wrong direction was your fate you knew where you was headed
Your presence was a message to me and I can't forget it
We only have one life so you better live it

(Chorus-Samaria)
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
How can I replay, all the joy you gave
Memories of us, will never fade away
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day

(Verse 2)
(Jelani)
What's supposed to do now
You live for me I live for you because we true pals
Oh what to do now, tried to make it through, how
They took you away and everyday I say who now, or who now
'Cause I know, I'm the last one left
When they took you homie, it's like they took my breath
And I can't stand, villains of my left hand man
Together we had plans now it's never again
Man, I hate that, what is this payback
For everybody that I hurt please don't say that
I pray that, I know where ya at 'cause I can't bring ya back, I can't bring
Ya back
It's a fact and we all done, and we all grunt
And when that day come, we all gon' save up
But why, did they have to take you and not my enemy, I'm holdin on 'till
Ya..

(Java)
Roll with me, full of grief homie disbelief
Can't sleep 'cause my nigga keep on callin me
Memories of ya been straight suited up
Hush puppies, shirt tucked, with ya diamond studs
Was it my love for the music, or was it just me
That kept my nigga from kickin it, spittin at fiends
Males, bad as hell causin drama at school
Broke the rules 'cause we niggas had nothin to lose
Shocked as hell 'cause I was just gon' call
Before my nigga Ken told me you was chillin with God
I feel like I did ya wrong, pullin up ya phone number in my cell phone
How long, will it be before I see you again
You took the highway to heaven like Michael and did
Starin at ya nigga from heaven above
Reunited with your mother so I know it's all good

(Chorus-Samaria)
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
How can I replay, all the joy you gave
Memories of us, will never fade away
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day

(Verse 3-JU)
I wish I could reach down in the ground and put my arms around you
My tears would started showers and form storms and drown you
I could never forget the day, that I lost ya
Good thing I let you know I love ya, the last time that I talked to ya
I wish that I could wake you up, but I'm glad you restin eternally
Just the fire in my heart from losin you is still burnin me
Turnin me to a man for our journey into a land
Where I be lost if I didn't have you holdin my hand
By my side when I needed you
Wish you would of just picked a time to say, JU I'm leavin you
So I could better be along, you always told me friends surprise ya, just
Take it head on
I guess that's why I could lie so much
And I guess that's why at ya funeral, I broke down and cried so much
My grandma always said you too much like yo granddaddy
I'm tryin hard to be strong, but I miss ya badly

(Chorus-Samaria)
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
How can I replay, all the joy you gave
Memories of us, will never fade away
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
