[Intro: 2Pac]
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Now what's next
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Caught up in the middle
My life's a riddle
Don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal, but it's this hustling that gets me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money
I could see your bubblin' avoid all trouble, beware of devils
Continue strugglin' cause nothing's impossible
If there's a will there's a way
To get your mind on official business you could be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave to get paid
My niggas do this every fuckin' day, we parlay
Through politics and conversations
It's information to my thug niggas in the congregation
Watch and bear witness To the pleasures of our participation
Separation is self-destruction what's needed is unification
Cause the world ain't hardly scared
If not prepared we sure to be buried and be no longer there
But no one cares or stand to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear, we'll evaporate say your prayers
And what's next

[Chorus: 2Pac & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
What's next

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
I plant one on his block chicken after chicken
There was a time that if you switch, you caught a stitchin'
And the main position statistician and ghetto politician
My competition's nail 'em all top of the hill
My niggas kill for a thrill
But my soul brings the real I'm all balled out
Tryin' to sell the devil the deal
I'm facin' forty case 'bout to spin a grip
And all my fuckin' homies for me for the same shit
The world is a snake pit your homies turn counterfeit
How much worser can it get, I'm not even feeling shit
I wish I could be legit
And turn this whole thing around
But there's no turnin' back
I'm steadily sinkin' down which way do I go

[Chorus: Mopreme & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do
What's next

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
I often wonder will the ways of today ever change
Now it's like the summer days in the rain we gain
So much it held on through stormy weather
Just your touch and understandin' kept us together
No need to swear to stay down
At any costs gave me hugs and pounds
When I took that loss you the boss
Is what you told me and you didn't lie
Promise to never part until we die
Don't cry , baby girl, I know the world is crashin' on us
Plus I thought our relationship was built on trust
Don't fuss I made mistakes you made mistakes too
What can we do but just think this through
Stay true with me don't mess with my enemies
Breakin' up is drivin' me crazy
So I'm highly occupied with women and my homies
To keep me from bein' lonely, so what's next

[Chorus: Big Syke & Prince Ital Joe]
(The struggles continue, I'm strivin' with my crew )
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
What's next

[Outro: Prince Ital Joe]
What's next
Some of them livin' in a booty complex
Tryin' to make the Thug Life crew vex
Some hate God and some worship checks
So tell me what the fuck's comin' in
If you spit in the sky it gonna drop in your fuckin' eye
You'll never miss the water 'till the well runs dry
Real deep punkster then love a lot
When I clock me Glock some heads gonna fly
Yeah, in case you never know my name is Prince Idol Joe
Kickin' it with the Outlaw Immortal
Them you there is no true
Sing, remember
If you spit in the sky it gonna drop in your fuckin' eye
So don't disrespect at any aspect
Cause you gonna be a fuckin' suspect
Ribits, Yes need some chill
Know what I mean love the youth and then them relove
Catch this
