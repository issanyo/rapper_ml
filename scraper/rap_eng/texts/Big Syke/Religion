[Intro: Big Syke]

[Verse 1: Big Syke]
No suprise, the preacher got you paying tithes?
Do you believe who you believe what he saying enlightens?
Did Jesus rise? Days after his demise?
You’re the paralyzed, the term closed, the open eyes
They’ll may lie
So I ain't paying tithes no more
Eternal life is the prize, don’t cost dough
So the plate being passed around helping who?
The bills paid and the money made helping you?
Mr reverend, Mr preacher, Mr bible-teacher
Is heaven a job the only way for god to reach you?
Say preacher, say pastor, what you really after?
Is it your goal to safe souls for the master?
Dizaster strikes like a thief in the night
The devil got us doing wrong what we think is right
But the light is in the scriptures that the prophets wrote
The false prophets will appear selling false hope

[Hook: Big Syke & (?)]
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion

[Verse 2: Big Syke]
Jehovah witness, Polytheism and Buddhism
The Islamic, the Catholic and the Judhism
Hinduism, but wheres the wisdom in the scroll?
They translated so many times no one knows
Souls lost, cuz Satan wanna challenge God
That’s crazy Satan got a name why don’t God?
Is it Jahweh, Jehovah or Allah?
Did they take it out the bible like Voila
Scholar’s writ that religion is all (?)
But it’s a mystery like the history of mankind
And they giving out religion everywhere you look..
Joseph Smith and his vision wrote the Mormon book
Is your religion carrying to your lifestyle?
You asked for it or was it passed down as a child?
How in the world could you believe with no research
So the only place I’m going is a free church

[Hook: Big Syke & (?)]
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
You think it wasn’t Adam? You think it wasn’t Eve?
Did you read that yourself or do you just believe?
The devil deceived, many say he don’t exist
But same inside of you if you prejedice
Can you resist temptation, here’s the nation of the God
The devil trapped on the earth with a murder squad
A fallen angel that choose to oppose the Lord
Say you wasn’t believing nothing that they never saw
So some worship idols, for their soul’s survival
Some of the priests only use pieces of the bible
Some from the old text, some from the new text
And there is even some that marry the same sex
We in the last days looking the evil men do
They say if the messiah was coming, he would’ve came through
But he giving the devil time to finish the crime
So I ain’t worried about your religon or were the Lord mind
