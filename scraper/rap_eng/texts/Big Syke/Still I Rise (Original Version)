[Intro: 2Pac & Big Syke]
'96 big body sittin' on chrome
Fuckin' with this Aliz√©
'96 big body sittin' on chrome
My nigga, Johnny J, studio full of mothafuckers
'96 big body sittin' on chrome
That's right
'96 big body sittin' on chrome
'96 big body sittin' on chrome
'96 big body sittin' on chrome

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Somebody wake me I'm dreamin', I started as a seed, the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
On the top, was my pops, my momma screamin' "stop"
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, the product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive?
Got me askin' white Jesus "will a nigga live or die?"
'Cause the Lord can't see us
In the deep, dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin'
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, out tryin' to hustle on my own
On this block where everybody and they pops tryin' to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong 'cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks, Glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man, he's a mind reader
Keep my nine heater all the time, this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed, nigga
That Hennessy'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, "Keep it real, G"
And my reply: "'til they kill me," act up if you feel me
I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

[Chorus: 2Pac & Big Syke]
'96 big body sittin' on chrome
And still I rise
'96 big body sittin' on chrome

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
I stay sharp as always
Runnin' ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin' crews like two's, nigga, all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems though
Be placin' triple beams and things, bro
Diamond pinky ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans slow

[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]
Dynamically this dude will twist your shit ceramically
Able to write a Fatal verse with no profanity
It's on for Al G., Nikko Storm and Nasty New
I put a hole in your crew, tryin' to pass me
With no remorse
You get blasted full force
A Nike endorsement doin' shootings on a horse
World wide supremacy
All y'all remember me
Hung over from Hennessy
With a menace intendency
Police be clockin' me
So I be dippin', slippin' sloppily
Sippin' Vodka, B
And ditchin' clips on private property
When five-O be comin'
Niggas be runnin' for they life and freedom
The type to beat 'em
Hittin' gates and break and try to lead 'em
To pit terriers, Monclair gettin' scarier
They nine's, they shoot 'em in secluded areas
The barrier, not me
I'm burned 'em off the dick, stayin' scot-free
'Til Task harass my ass and try to have the ave locked D
My nigga fell
Givin' a whole essence county trigger hell
Runnin' the fuckin' block and duckin' cops tryin' to get a bail

[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]
In '96 my Glock's my plastic passion for blastin' bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin' ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin', more greens the topic
And loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
Leavin' ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
And still I rise, and still I rise
And still I rise, and still I rise
