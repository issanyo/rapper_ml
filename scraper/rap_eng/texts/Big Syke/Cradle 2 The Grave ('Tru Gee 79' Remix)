[Intro]
Damn. True G. Don't fall asleep nigga, Everybody dies Nigga everybody dies, We all gotta go nigga we all gotta go, Go to sleep nigga, Go to sleep, Close your motherfucking eyes, We all gotta die, Fuck Em All X2, Westside M.O.B

[Verse 1 : 2Pac]
First to bomb, Quick to unload
Expose my foes for being bitches
Keeping niggas suspicious
2 Glocks is filled with ammo
My army fatigues is ready for battle
Lyrical commando, (Let get it on)
Tell me nigga how much can you handle?
Banging on wax
I turn the track into a roman candle
Booom!
My intention specifically
Thugged out no sympathy
Pictures of closed caskets
Soon as Daz get with me (I am first to bomb)
First is the calm then the panic
Soon as my niggas break
We earthquake the whole planet
Adversaries can't understand it
The way my niggas strategize
Don't anybody die unless we planted it
Live long committed, I write songs and then spit it
No matter how hard motherfuckers try
They can't get it
It's west coast
Westide, Outlawz till we die, Thug life motherfuckers on the first ride and we are the first to bomb

[Hook: Big Syke]
I got nothing to lose, paying dues
Nigga you wanna die?
I get high, Then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when i hit your set
Cause i am coming, Start running
Yelling Evil-Mind as i am gunning
One in the chamber
For the anger that i build inside
For the mothers that cried
The beginning is an ending
Am i just a slave
So i got be brave
From the cradle to the grave

[Verse 3 : Eminem]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many mothafuckin' people, who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair
With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems
And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government, I'm loving it
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : 2Pac]
Tell me baby what's your frequency
You see I'm making proposals
Full of verbal indecency when ya meeting me
Flash light i am buzzed
What's right like drugs, got 3 strikes
You got cause last night for thugs
Holding my position
My competition is never ready
Ripped by a machete
My alias is Makaveli
So what they tell me through the grapevine
Niggas ain't ready to see me paid
They rather take mine
Retaliation takes time
Creating rhymes that so ferocious that the bass line
Went for my vocals
Every time a nigga says it rhyme
Spending and busting you thought it up
But you wasn't prepared
Niggas is scared, I am eternally thugging
Like Kamikazes on a suicide mission
I am spitting multiple gunshots
Burning turning rappers to victims
I kick em all day

[Hook : Big Syke]

(Gunshot sound)
