[Intro: 2Pac]
Nigga, fuck that gin and juice, I'm fuckin' with Hennessy
Just pour me a glass of that dark shit
That's right

[Chorus: 2Pac & Sleepy Brown]
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Ooooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy) hahaha, yeah
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Ooooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy)

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now I was born in the gutter facin' life or death
I was a thug ever since my mama gave me breath
These motherfuckers wanna see me die
So who am I to try to warn 'em?
I fuckin' bomb 'em, them niggas fry
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessy
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me proceed
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me
Now that it's poppin', ain't no love, bitch
I maintain in the game, in the gutter's where I still kick it
I'm tryna hustle up a meal ticket
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dyin days
Ain't nuttin' wrong with gettin' paid, so nigga blaze
'Cause we some motherfuckin' fools
Walkin' through the streets wearin' jewels, breakin' niggas fakin' moves
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy

[Chorus: 2Pac & Sleepy Brown]
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Ooooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy), haha, that's right
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Ooooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy)

[Verse Two: Edi Amin]
Yeah
Up late nights, under the city lights
The Henn' got me feelin' right, I'm tryin' to keep from swervin'
She's so fine and she love Henny too
After a couple of shots, she said, "I could do what I wanna do"
(That's right) We ain't sippin' champagne (nah) we off the Henn-Rock
Alcoholics back at the liquor sto' cause we can't stop (Can't stop)
And won't stop (we won't stop) all night long
'Til the break of dawn, gettin' it on, Hennessy

[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]
Ooooh, lady watchin' (Lady watchin) as I'm glidin' by (glidin' by)
And the place is jumpin', that I can't deny (No, no, no)
Ooh, I can't wait to go in, throw my glass in the sky (Glass in the sky)
For the people partyin', 'til the mornin' light

[Chorus: 2Pac & Sleepy Brown]
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Ooooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy)
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Ooooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy)
(Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this ol' thug shit)

They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Ooooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy), hahaha
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Ooooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy)

[Outro: Sleepy Brown]
Keep on sippin', and sippin', and sippin'
Ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh, Hennessy
