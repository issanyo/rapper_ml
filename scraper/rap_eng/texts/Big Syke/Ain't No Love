[Syke talking]
Ain't been no love around here for a long time
When the love gon' come back
Huh, I don't know, I don't know
But till then, keep doing it like I do it

[Verse 1: Big Syke]
From the first day of birth it was like we was cursed
For our destiny to ride away in a hearse
Unseen tomorrows so many hearts are hollow
Can't help 'em they'll put me down if I let 'em
I'm givin' fifty feet to the average friend or foe
And I'll kill you fo' you kill me if you don't know
Cause sometimes God put you in the path to kill
But not if your intentions are to hurt or steal
Constantly surrounded by despisers that's intoxicated
Cause all of us are gang related
Later years fully gettin' there
What do we have here?
One day every family shall shed a tear
I'm lost I can't find myself, I listen but don't learn
What's the call for help will God let me burn
So I'm takin' everyday like I'm livin' my last
What's the aftermath all I know, is ain't no love

[Chorus: G-Money]
Love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
I said love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
It ain't no love, it ain't no lvoe

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
It ain't no love fuck the love
See I'ma thug wid mad slugs
And trippin' off these hoes up under my rug
Blind and I can't see sometimes
This Remy Martin got me high
Givin' my shit a try
My people doubt me why
Hey, I'm way too fly
Thinkin' everybody down wid me until I die
Just like in a nightmare
Straight to fuck from nowhere
Nine's in yo back like you ain't seen jack
Now sticky situations make a motherfucka feel
Like going straight to hell cause at least hell is real
I'm holdin' shit down like a motherfuckin' vet
I'm a real nigga doin' real things, and that you can bet.....

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
They say reach in your heart and you will find yo mind
Everyday in the streets got my foresight blind
My aftertime is narrow peepin' down the barrel of a four
Just a nigga or a killa I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest
Slug in the chest one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka duckin' season, gimme the reason
Why I should change into a softy
After livin' so lofty
It cost me my soul outta control in a devil's world
Me my niggas and my girl
It ain't no love

[Chorus (til fade)]
