[Intro: 2Pac]
How long will they mourn me?
Yeah, this for my nigga Kato
It's still on, nigga, believe that!
We live a Thug Life, thugs for life, ha ha
(How long will they mourn me?)
We handle this shit for you, bwoy
Yeah, nigga, 2Pac in this motherfucker

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
All my homies drinkin' liquor, tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homie's homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier?
I load my clip and though my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckers back before you're buried
Retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
Do real niggas get to go to Heaven?
How long will they mourn me? Bury me a motherfuckin' G
Bitch, don't wanna die, then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me though, I'm tryin' hard to make amends
But I'm losin' all my motherfuckin' friends
Damn! They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the motherfuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?

[Hook: Nate Dogg & 2Pac]
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Half them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
(Dedicated this to Kato, nigga, and e'ry thug)
How long will they mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Yo, nigga, we gotta keep this shit goin' on; yo, Syke!)

[Verse 2: Big Syke]
How long will they mourn me? Every motherfuckin' day, homie
You stayed down when the other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigger you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without you, nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'Lac
And goin' half on a motherfuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me, Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowin' which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
'Til we meet again, homie – how long will they mourn me?

[Hook: Nate Dogg & Big Syke]
I wish it would have been another (Big Kato)
How long will they mourn me? (It's still on, nigga)
How long will they mourn my brother?
How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?
Rated R (Double Jeopardy), Mac 10

[Verse 3: The Rated R (Double Jeopardy)]
Damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad, I'm tired of puttin' in work
I'm tired of cryin', watchin' my homies leave the Earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is, "That's fucked up."
And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now, let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of you, homie
Rest in peace – how long will they mourn me?

[Verse 4: Macadoshis (Mac 10)]
We know life's a fuckin' trip, and everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato?
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin' with my dome
You only live once on this Earth
A nigga had it bad since the day of my motherfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone, how long will you mourn me?

[Hook: Nate Dogg & 2Pac]
I wish it would have been another
(Mac 10 in this motherfucker, yeah!)
How long will you mourn me?!
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Thug Life, boy, Nate, blowin' that shit)
I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg, do that shit, nigga, yeah)
How long will you mourn me?!
How long will they mourn my brother?
(This for my nigga Kato, and all his kids)
How long will you mourn me?!
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn my brother?
