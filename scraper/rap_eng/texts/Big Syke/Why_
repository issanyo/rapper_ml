[Syke talking]
Damn, the world's so crazy out here
Never know what's going on
Never know why things happen
But they do
Well just take it

Verse 1:

As my inner thoughts of reality set in, another day begins
Cause you never know you were alseep until ya wake up
Will me and my ex-girl make up?
I don't know but life's a question
After death is there a resurrection?
Cause the chaos and the mayhem got me crazy
When will I have my first baby?
But is there love there?, do I really care?
I swear, life ain't fair
So much pain and sorrow
Will I see tomorrow
Make a path for my kids to follow
So it's me against the world
Can't nobody talke to me
I need psychotherapy
Forever I cry inside
I can't hide
Just tell me why

Chorus:

Why do we do the things that we do? (Just tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do? (Tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do? (Tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do?

Verse 2:

A little kid's refelection is a shadow of death
Just behind him are his first steps
But nobody cares it's just everybody for theyself
So pray to Yahweh if you need help
Cause love don't love nobody alone
Can I stay strong? can I move on?
But I gotta get used to my past being my future road
Seldom travelled but never told
The world is crazy my mind is paralyzed
And hypnotized by these walk-bys
Families cry from dead souls lost
I guess our future pays the cost, I wanna floss
But we drownin' in poverty
My homie said he was gonna get wid me but ain't got wid me
It's so hard on a G tryna elevate in the game
And there's no way to escape the pain
Tell me why

Chorus

Verse 3:

So many trials and tribulations
We livin' in desperation
Everyone's givin' up there's no motivation
Organization or self determination
The youth is fallin' and callin' the OGs
Hand up some kis or get degrees, Lord please
I can't take it the world is comin' to an end
So God forgive me for my sin
Cause I ain't never had a thang, will it change?
So I can rearrange
The game ah life is the hardest game yet
Cause nobody knows what's coming up next
No respect, for our elders cause they fightin' us scared
Whta happened to the love we once shared, noone cares
So I soak my pains in Remy Martin and gettin' high
I know that's not the answer
So I ask why?

Chorus

[Kid #1]: Syke why everybody die?
[Kid #2]: Why the world so crazy?
[Kid #3]: Why everybody go to jail?
[Kid #4]: Why little kids get kidnapped?

Chorus ('til fade)
