[Verse 1: CUZ Lightyear]
All my niggas professionals
All my bitches special
Tap in, I'll connect you
Chicken sandwich from Zesto's
Track pants with the retros
At the Citco on Gresham Road
I don't fuck around with the Texaco
Huh, I got the, I got the sauce for sale
Free all my niggas in jail, I'll rot in a cell 'fore I tell
Now you know my dawg illegal, so my dawg can't show his face
If I don't provide no reasonable doubt, the judge won't throw my case (Trap)
Trap shit check (Check), cashiers check (Check)
Fuck you pussy niggas, need a pap-smear check (Pussy)
Cuffin' on your bitch, she is not under arrest
Better take this shit to trial, I am not gonna confess
Look at my ex, look at my next, both of 'em bad, whole lotta ass
Lil' bitty breast, I'm finna wreck, no disrespect
Gettin' caught in the act is my only regret
Raised in the 'jects, I don't fold under stress
Good in the Bluff, I'm at home on the 'Crest
Get popped like a quiz, I am not one to test
Live on the road like my name Johnny Quest
C safe as a boobie trap
The feds tracked me usin' Google Maps
And the phone company let 'em do the tap
Damn T-Mobile, that make you a rat
Speed racer, I'ma do the max
Keep it movin' like the Uber app
I'm on Elm Street like Freddie Kruger back
Blowin' good gas, this that super pack

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
Chicken talk like Popeye's, heatin' up the stove
Wrist counter-clockwise, beatin' up the bowl
You ain't said shit, slick, slime wipe your nose
Screen door still swangin', trap don't close
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Call my connect, pick up the load
Water, Pyrex, heat up the stove
Cook up them yams, eat 'em up whole
Play with my check, get hit with that pole

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
My name is Kill, I'm from the 'Ville
I'm whippin' muscle, fuck a Seville
I got your bitch, she on the pill
She suckin' dick, oh, what a thrill
Really for her, not really for me
I had to teach her stop using her teeth
Watch, when you fuck again, bet you gon' see
All of them compliments come back to me
I'm in the Flame least three days a week
Maybe all seven if I'm runnin' with Sleep
Shh, bitch I ain't runnin' my mouth, yeah
Bitch I am runnin' the South, yeah
Bitch I ain't talkin' 'bout records, yeah
Bitch I get mayors elected, yeah
What nigga you know move elections?
And still got a brick on his necklace, ho

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
Chicken talk like Popeye's, heatin' up the stove
Wrist counter-clockwise, beatin' up the bowl
You ain't said shit, slick, slime wipe your nose
Screen door still swangin', trap don't close
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Call my connect, pick up the load
Water, Pyrex, heat up the stove
Cook up them yams, eat 'em up whole
Play with my check, get hit with that pole
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl, beat up the bowl
Ice on my neck, mouth full of gold
Drip when I jugg, trap out VLONE
Stunt 'til I'm dead, sleep when I'm gone
Chasing this chicken, nothin' for these hoes
Chicken talk like Popeye's, heatin' up the stove
Wrist counter-clockwise, beatin' up the bowl
You ain't said shit, slick, slime wipe your nose
Screen door still swangin', trap don't close
