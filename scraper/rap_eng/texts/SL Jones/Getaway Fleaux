Controversy sells but my talent brings the balance
I’m true to what I do that’s why I conquer every challenge
Kill em with the flow and soothe em with a ballad
All I do is win, we the best after Khaled
All I do is spin, fresh dressing at the salad
I’m the man in wonderland, Damn right I smashed Alice

Whole squad balling, my team getting cash rolls
NBA niggas: natural born assholes
Flyest niggas alive as far as swag goes
Jumping froggy out the pond, all you tadpoles
The left Levi pocket, that’s where the flag goes
I know you used to them Chevys and Cadillac doors
You’re only human you don’t recognize a spaceship
Hoes say I’m lookin different, Jonesy got a facelift

Nip/tuck flow
Shut up and suck ho
After I bust she leaves call it come and go
Get it, come and go
Man, forget it, you dumb and slow
Shorty live in my lap she giving me love alone
If you recognize real I’m familiar to y’all
Outcast of my class, I'mma chill in the hall
Kept my pistol in the bathroom under the stall
Chopped the school janitor something to leave it alone

I’m in a league of my own but never played myself
Slightly brighter than my teachers, I grade myself
Other niggas flip the script, I stayed myself
When it wasn’t my fault, I blamed myself
I take pleasure in the pain I felt
I get tougher when I suffer
That’s the way I’m built
Let my enemies live
That’s how Caine got killed
But I’m straight though cause gangsters don’t behave like them

Jonesy supposed to be a role model
Look at him standing on the couch with that rose bottle
Look at him posing for them pictures like a vogue model
Grind before you shine
What happened to that old motto?
That’s the code I know
I must be doing something right
When haters can’t believe the hype
They say you sold your soul
Couldn’t play your part
Cause you ain’t know your role
I tried to give you advice
I told you slow your roll

If we stay on this road
Then we won’t go wrong
But you got outta control
So now you on your own
Taking over the world
I wanna own the globe
They say the flow is a gift
It should have came with a bow
They say this verse is a curse
It should have came on a scroll
They left Jonesy for dead
Engraved my name on a stone
Check my background
I never back down
I’m bout my postmark
I put my stamp down

I got a special delivery especially when I reflect
No one can mirror me lyrically
You rappers will never be taken seriously
The streets been waiting
On somebody to come up out these weak imitations
Been putting in work since my first initiation
The turf really baking, the soil is boiling
Connected, no wire, I’m cordless
There’s beauty behind I write
So what I’m recording is gorgeous

It’s M.A.D.E. entertainment
The money always
Determines everything
And you know what they call me
SL Jonesy

This for the Locs with the blue flags
For the Bloods and the Black Stones
For all the Folk Nation GDs
And the People Nations Vicelords

For the jackers and the trap boys
If you gotta rob and sell dope
The judge wanna lock us up forever
Get away while you still can
