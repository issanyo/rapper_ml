[Verse 1]
Just caught a jugg
Got off FaceTime with the plug
'Bout to go sell me some drugs
You know what it was
You the respect, what I love
Wet up your set like a flood
Bricks in the bag
I take them bricks out the bag
Wipe of the bricks with my flag
Bitch at the pad
Lil' mama thick in the ass
I stick my dick in her vag
Back to the money
Hot boy, I'm hot like a oven
Pull up and leave the car runnin'
Strap out in public
Bunkin', my trap house is bunkin'
Fuck 12, I don't fuck with dozens
Try me, I'm dumpin'
Throw away, I'll buy me another one
Bust down the elbow, the onions
Some of 'em was A1 and some of 'em wasn't
If I finessed you, I'm sorry for nothin'

[Chorus]
Yeah I might sell you a dream, ayy
Remix and tell you it's clean, ayy
Always keep one in my sleeve, ayy
Blue Alexander McQueen, ayy
I'm 'bout to bust down the bale, ayy
Watch how I play with the scale, ayy
Draco singing like Adele, ayy
You getting money, I can tell, ayy

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait
You need some more? You just told me you straight
Shawty just clean off the plate with her face
I would be lying if I told you it was safe
Pay for that pussy, I don't wanna date
How can I save her? I don't wear a cape
Just hit a lick, now I'm saying my grace
I'm with all the fuck shit if that's what it takes, yeah
Young, rich, rollin', always put the money first
Never did nobody dirty who didn't deserve it, for what it's worth
Accidentally shot the yopper but at least I know it work
In my little trap of horrors, if you scared, go to church
Swear to God, swear to God
If you scared, go to church
Squad masked up like it's October 31st
Keep your head on a swivel, watch yaour back and stay alert
No shorts, no losses, it's gon' cost you
Ain't not handouts, no free work
Put in work, puttin' in work
MAC-11 on the dresser, that's my Lil Uzi Vert
Payback is a bitch, I can get you reimbursed
Flag on my neck the same color as Papa Smurf
You know I'm telling the truth
I'ma put that on the blue
X'd all the squares in my circle
You took yourself out the loop
12 know I did it, they ain't got no proof
Probation was nothing I'm back on the loose
Can't leave my dog hanging, his neck in a noose
Closed mouth don't get fed, I can't make no excuse (Whoa, whoa)
My mama asked me is I'm still crippin' (Yes, ma'am)
My freedom priceless but I still risk it
Out here for a meal ticket, don't you get it twisted
Got so comfortable cookin' dope
I put a couch up in my kitchen, yeah
