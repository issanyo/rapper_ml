[Intro]
Welcome to my closet, you will see
Givenchy and Louis Vuitton trash

[Verse 1]
Murdered out with the blue laces
Wishy washy, actin' two-faced
All I wanted was a new spaceship
Closet full of Bape, goin' ape shit
Lately I been juggin' on the day shift
Duckin' 12, gotta stay evasive
Switch it up, I know how to shapeshift
Lifestyles of the lit and dangerous
Mama told me not to talk to strangers, no
Now I'm outside with the neighbors, Cuz
Set trippin', twistin' up my fingers, on hood
I been going through a lot of things
Somethin' gotta give, somethin' gotta change
Lost my phone, bought another one
Lost my bitch, caught another one
Slowed up, now I'm on another run
Stayed down, one hundred from the jump
Passed up everyone in front of us
Tapped in, each and every one of us
Whole squad lit 'fore the summer come
Cold outside, better bundle up
Down bad, good we finally comin' up
Fake friends callin' just to say, "What's up?"
Poor connection, miss me with the fake love
I'm already hangin' up, it's a dub
Lost my mind, blame it on the drugs
Suicide mission, how you want it done?
Russian roulette, fully loaded gun
Got up out my feelings, back to being numb

[Chorus]
He don't wanna see you lit baby, no
He just keep you around for decoration, yeah, oh
What you see is what you get baby, yeah
I offer you loyalty and dedication, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Came up, came down, stayed down, ride low
New cars, new crib, same friends, same hood
Ain't shit changed but the address
Always at it, I ain't in my bag yet
I remember back when I had less
Still the same real one 'til my last breath
Used to downplay me, now you act pressed
When you hit my line and I don't answer
I'm at Follies with the naked dancers
Savin' up for what? I blow it fast now
If I want that pussy, I'ma cash out
Seven grams of pressure in the Glad-Lock
Open up and show the world what you got
All he wanna do is keep you in a box

[Chorus]
He don't wanna see you lit baby, no
He just keep you around for decoration, yeah, oh
What you see is what you get baby, yeah
I offer you loyalty and dedication, yeah, oh
