[Intro]
Tape 1, Side A
Keep my money stashed, I call that shit the bread box, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I can't say too much on camera 'cause the feds watch
I wish a motherfucker would, you better not
Disrespect my hood, you askin' for a headshot

[Verse 1]
Mama love me but she had me out of wedlock
Drop that dope and watch it lock up like a dreadlock
Red October, so my feet are dripped in deadstock
For them hunchos, turned the condo to a sweatshop
Only good cop I believe in is a dead cop
I wasn't raised by my real pops, I love my step-pops
Couldn't afford no new school clothes, used to feel left out
Granny helped us pay them bills, my mom was stressed out

[Chorus]
Everybody know my mind
Guess that's what I get for thinkin' out loud, yeah
Everybody know my mind
Just wanna make my mama proud (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Add up all these blessings, make 'em count (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I was trappin' out my auntie house (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I was livin' on my partner couch (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
They say the kind like me don't make it out
Mama said my mouth gon' get me in trouble, it did
Homeless shelter, it's just me in a room full of kids
Certain shit you can't forget, gotta learn to forgive
You gotta look below the surface, it's deeper, you dig

[Chorus]
Everybody know my mind
Guess that's what I get for thinkin' out loud, yeah
Everybody know my mind
Just wanna make my mama proud
