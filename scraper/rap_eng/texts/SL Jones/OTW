[Intro: CUZ Lightyear]
Slow money is better than no money, yeah

[Verse 1: CUZ Lightyear]
Moment of silence, mama said kill them with kindness
Code of silence, this sex, money, and violence
Never gon' find us, 12 comin', gotta run from the sirens, yeah

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
On the way, on the way, on the way
On the way, on the way, on the way
On the way, on the way, on the way
On the way, on the way, on the way

[Verse 2: CUZ Lightyear]
Multiplyin', the fuck shit spread like virus
Drug dealers inspire us, I wanna be covered in diamonds, ooh
Projects deprived us, big drip, death over designer, ooh
Decipher my dialect, choke on it, you gon' need the Heimlich, yeah
On the way, on the way, on the way
On the way, on the way, on the way
All I wanna do is ball
I take risks, I could lose it all, uh
I stood tall, I refused to crawl
Shit gettin' fixed when it's tools involved, uh

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
On the way, on the way, on the way (On the way to the bag)
On the way, on the way, on the way (On the way to the bag)
On the way, on the way, on the way (On the way to the bag)
On the way, on the way, on the way

[Verse 3: Yung Bans]
On the way to the cash right now
On the way to the bag right now
Beat the pussy up then I beat that shit down
Made a bitch throw in the towel, yeah
Smoking on dope, shit's so loud
He don't want beef, hmm, yeah, he don't want no cow
Hmm, yeah, young nigga been on my own cloud, yeah
Heaven sky, nigga try me, he died
Nigga try me, he fried, huh, make his mama cry, huh
Sometimes I wonder why these niggas wanna try it
Fuck a ho, uh, yeah, huh
Beat a lil' bitch from the side
Make your main bitch my side piece
Fuckin' twin sisters, they Siamese
On the way to the cash right now (On the way to the bag)
On the way to the bag right now
On the way to the cash right now (On the way to the bag)
On the way to the bag right now

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
On the way, on the way, on the way
On the way, on the way, on the way
On the way, on the way, on the way
On the way, on the way, on the way

[Outro: CUZ Lightyear]
GPS fucked up, I'm so lost
So many missed calls, had to turn my phone off
'Til the wheels fall off, y'all my road dawgs
Had to work hard to become my own boss
We never the ones switch sides
We don't deal with shaky vibes
Rollin' with slime, gon' slide, blue slime
On the way, on the way, on the way
On the way, on the way, on the way
