[Intro]
This is the beginning of the song

[Verse 1]
No, don't confide in me, you need to find some help
There ain’t no "I" in "we", gon' end up by yourself
Might pull ten Lastics out my pocket, let it melt
Ain't take no handouts, played the hand that I was dealt
Put them grams on the scale
Took my fair share of L’s
Almost got me expelled
This bandana Chanel
Tuck it in on the left
I don't see nothin' else
Can't express what I feel

[Refrain]
If you fool me once, I'll just move on
If I let you fool me twice, that's shame on me
I know a lot of y'all say a lot of shit that y'all don’t mean
So I’ma cut shit short and end this shit for good

[Chorus]
For good, for good, for good
Let's nip this in the bud, the bud, nip it in the bud

[Verse 2]
I don’t know who I can trust
I'ma get mine, that's a must
Always came through in the clutch
Thank God for wakin' up
Sitting around, waitin’ on love
Could fuck around and have you stuck
Everything I did out of love
That's why I never hold no grudge
Enough is enough
I done told you 'bout watching face
You gon' let your food get cold
Watching somebody else's plate
Fuck around, you gon' lose control
Gotta move at your own pace
Trapped by your own mistakes
And you won't let yourself escape
Can't you see it's already too late?

[Refrain]
I used to say I'd never change, but knock on wood
Those who need favors turn to strangers, wish I would
I let 'em live, I should have probably pulled the plug
So I'ma cut this short and end this shit for good

[Chorus]
For good, for good, for good
And nip this in the bud, the bud, nip it in the bud

[Interlude]
End this shit for good, for good
End this shit for good
Nip it in the bud, the bud
Nip it in the bud

[Refrain]
If you fool me once, I'll just move on
If I let you fool me twice, that's shame on me
I know a lot of y'all say a lot of shit that y'all don't mean
But I know how you was from the jump, so the blame on me

[Outro]
This is the end of the song
When a nigga won't accept your love, open the fuck up, hahaha
