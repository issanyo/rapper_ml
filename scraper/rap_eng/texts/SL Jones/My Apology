Intro:
I'm saying that I'm sorry
For all your pain
You know who I'm talking to
I ain't gotta say no names
This is my apology
The one that you deserved and never got from me
I still ride you
You did a lot for me
I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me

Reminiscing bout those days on Dick Jeter Road
Mama used to heat the whole house with the kitchen stove
Me and my youngest brother
Peas from the same pod
Dealt the same hand
So we had to play the same cards

What set you claiming?
Wasn't easy to accept you banging
I still remember Uncle Raymond saying "Nephews changing"
Niggas fear him in the hood cause his rep is dangerous
Why bother rapping when trapping can make you just as famous?

Respected young with a reckless tongue
I would give you the last breath in this set of lungs
Papa taught us street smarts
We were never dumb
You were raised to be a rider
Trained to never run

How could you be a better son to your mother
When your older brother wasn't really there
To show you how much he loved you?
Charge it to my mind and not my heart
I regret it
I hope that my apology's accepted
Forgive me

Chorus
I wish that I could tell you it's gon be alright
I wish that I could say that it's gon be ok
I hope you can forgive me as the days go by
I'll regret it for the rest of my life
I'll regret it, for the rest of my life

Reminiscing bout them days when we got along
A small pause while I recall how we got involved
Oh I remember
I just wanted to get in them drawers
I'm far from perfect
But you never seem to see my flaws

Never did you wrong
I always had the best intentions
You just needed attention
But I was out here grinding like a blender
Two completely different agendas
We tried to make it work
Hoping time would heal where it hurt
It kinda made it worse

You want a loving husband and a couple of kids
I just want a bunch of money and a couple of cribs
You pictured having a beautiful wedding, family and friends
I pictured having a candy blue chevy, ridin on rims
You the type to settle down and be a man's wife
I'm the type to stray away from commitment
Addicted to the fast life
Charge it to my mind and not my heart
I regret it
I hope that my apology's accepted
Forgive me

Chorus

Live with regrets
Forgive and forget
I ask for guidance in my prayers
I sin and repent
Still reminisce
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
If I knew then what I know now
I'd still be half as wise

I laugh sometimes to keep from crying
When there's no denying
What you're implying
I remain silent to keep from lying
I'm not being biased when I cater to the flyest
Some people too broke to get it
But you just too cheap to buy it

You know you're making noise when your haters can't be quiet
And every public relation seems to lead to something private
My sister's blowing up my phone to see whats up with Brian
It happened as if I planned it
I'm just really improvising
Expected not to win
That's why I tell it like it is
All my little cousins big and my mama want some grandkids
I know this sounds kinda selfish
But if I don't help myself
Im gon be helpless
My sincere apologies
I hope you accept it
