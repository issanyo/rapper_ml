[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I’m caged in with these animals, all these killers and cannibals
With a mind of a hannibal, I just conquered my enemy
[?] crews give up their turf just to say that they friends with we
The savages savages bad as the baddest get
You got it we want it and we take, it you ain’t having it
You paying retribution, we shooting sticks and establish it
We are the savages born from no marriages
America’s bastard kids leaning on activists
Walking through tragedy smoke for my dead ones
Grip on my handgun I’m never scared uh
I’m just prepared uh, you was a warrior
Me? I’m a warrior and boy that should worry ya
Coming through gunning, busting 'bout a hundred
I don’t give a damn if your mommy on the line
Running on your daughter and son
I’m a keep busting keep gunning while your fam keep running
I’ma keep pumping, pumping till your heart ain’t pumping
Popping until your legs ain’t chopping
And seen you to hell with a story to tell
The devil when you get down there the savages coming, coming

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
You bet not cross that line I ain't gon' let it slide
Me and mine against the world, fuck the other side
You a rider if you rolling when it’s time to ride
Stacking hunnids, doing damage for your peace of mind
We see what we want and we take it
We see what we want and we take it (that's right)
We see what we want and we take it
We don't like the rule then we break it
We see what we want and we take it
We see what we want and we take it (that's right)
We see what we want and we take it
We take it, ta-ta-take it

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Man I was born into this hood carrying my Daddy likeness
Don’t know how it was before but for what I know it’s been like this
They told me early that my color wasn't equal to whiteness
So I had to fight my way up with my left and right fist
Tried to make it on these wages started nining to fiving
But I wasn't making progress, I was barely surviving
Wanted more than what I had, tired of struggling and striving
So I put a team together and we started conniving
Bunch of cutthroat and killers with no heart or compassion
Couple monsters with no conscience so we started [?]
We run up to your trap, man you take us to your stash and
We gon' get up and out that bitch right here in orderly fashion
You can bitch and you can moan see but ain't nobody listening
These the rules of engagement partner, so play your position
We some manage mother fuckers and we out on a mission
So if it’s getting too hot then get the fuck out the kitchen bitch

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
You bet not cross that line I ain't gon' let it slide
Me and mine against the world, fuck the other side
You a rider if you rolling when it’s time to ride
Stacking hunnids, doing damage for your peace of mind
We see what we want and we take it
We see what we want and we take it (that's right)
We see what we want and we take it
[?] we break it
We see what we want and we take it
We see what we want and we take it (that's right)
We see what we want and we take it
We take it, ta-ta-take it
(That’s right)
(That’s right)
(That’s right)
(That’s right)

[Outro]
There was 101 gangs in the Bronx so take your pick
Black assassins, peacemakers, seven immortals turbans
Turbans ex-veterans from Vietnam the job hence reapers
Roman kings young kids deadly Teria Scales is one of the
Most respected gangs that walked the streets
Black Spades, when they came they blocking like the whole street
