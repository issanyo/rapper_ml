[Intro]
That pussy don't belong to me, it's just my turn
Don't act like something's wrong with me, somethin' that I learned
You really don't know me so don't get too cozy, no
Stand far from these phonies, they Cuban Zirconis broke
You see what I'm rolling, always six oh-in', Locs
Was high when I wrote this, you shouldn't promote this dope

[Verse 1]
Being young is my excuse for everything
Switchin' moods every time the weather change
Summer time just a couple months away
Dodging rain drops 'til middle of May
Time to slide, girl, I know you wanna stay
Girl, you fine, but this money callin' me
Lock it down, you might be the ball and chain
Number one, only second to my gang, yeah
I made some promises
I'ma keep 'em, been plottin' on all kind of shit
Ain't no secret, my plug name anonymous
Got a whole lot of common, that's common sense
I was born like this, blame my environment
Play yourself out these streets, no retirement
Keep it solid the only requirement
Took a whole lot of pain to inspire this, uh-huh
More than you'll ever know
Long nights on Gresham Road
Pick up another load
Different day, different phones
Can't let 'em do me wrong
I'ma speak on the truth 'til they prove me wrong
I don't make no excuses, I hold my own
Yeah, this shit pay the rent but I'm never home, nope

[Chorus]
I'm tripping off these substances
I don't even know how much this is
You might not want to fuck with this
Fuck around and fall in love with this

[Verse 2]
Being young is my excuse for everything
Mama told me get the money, fuck the fame
Firk' used to say, "What if tomorrow never came?"
Tomorrow here, but now you gone like yesterday
Busting juggs in my Alexander Wang
Showin' signs, so you know what set I claim
You know my kind always go against the grain, ayy
Yeah,I'll be right here when you ready
Why you call that broke boy "daddy"? He a deadbeat
Lil Pakistani, I'm a nightmare on Elm Street
Do my dirty all by my lonely, only rollin' one deep
Put that on my mama
Stack the dough, let it pile up
Can't look forward to karma
When you robbin' the robbers
How I know if it's real?
Let me taste, how it feel?
Ooh, this feel just like a pill
Ooh, this give me the chills

[Chorus]
I'm tripping off these substances
I don't even know how much this is
You might not want to fuck with this
Fuck around and fall in love with this
