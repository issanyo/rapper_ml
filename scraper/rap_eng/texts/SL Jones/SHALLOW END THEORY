[Intro]
Embarrassing
Oh, bye, hahaha
Any last words before this ends?
You guys are amazing
Aw, no one's ever said that to us before
That was so nice actually, I wasn't expecting a compliment
You're amazing

[Verse]
You got options, I got options
I just want to fuck you good and take you shoppin'
I know they watchin', let them watch us
I just want to fuck you good and take you shoppin'
I told myself I'd never get this drunk again, yeah
I told myself I'd never fuck this bitch again, yeah
I'm actin' different but this shit ain't no pretend
Let's just get this over with, yeah
I grind like a nigga work a nine to five
Hot boy, you should see me in the summer time
Show a whole 'nother side when I come alive
I'ma stay lit and out the way
Tryna not to end up locked away
Pull up to Elleven45, it's only 11:45
Pre-gaming like it's game time
Ros√© bottles lit up like a Darth Vader lightsaber
Welcome to the dark side
This one for the archives
I be in the Bluff now, but I'll never lose my Eastside ways
Always love when you see my face
Southside rollin', tell 'em free my gang
C-U-Z, I know you see
Yeah, that Saint Laurent on me
Girl, your love taste just like drugs
Pray to God I don't OD
Pray to God I don't OD
I'm already drunk, low-key
Keep my feelings to myself
By myself I'll always be

[Chorus]
Shit ain't that deep, no
Can't watch me, you ain't on the right channel, nah
Shit ain't that deep, nah
Can't try me, I ain't no free sample, no
Shit ain't that deep, nah
Sun gone shine, I don't need no candle, nah
Shit ain't that deep, nah
I'ma keep a top level, I guess I'm shallow
I just want this money, oh, I'm so shallow
