[Intro]
I love you forever

[Verse 1: CUZ Lightyear]
Draco in the AMG in case you pussies play with me
That's your opinion, I don't agree
You salty, that's okay with me
If that's your bitch, you want your bitch
Then keep your bitch away from me
All work no sleep, SSDD
It's same shit, different day for me

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
Trap just like the Waffle House, I fix it right in front of you
Trap just like hibachi, yeah, I fix it right in front of you
Trap suit like designer, yeah, I'm dead fresh when I'm serving you
Extendo got a .223 for each and every one of you

[Verse 2: CUZ Lightyear]
Yellow gold all on my teeth, I smile, it look like Pikachu
I hit the trap and disappear, won't see me for a week or two
My bitch got on some bloody shoes, I'm crippin', all my sneakers blue
These snitches out here fishing, so C careful who you speakin' to
Drugs in my soda, got my body moving slower
'Cause I fuck with you don't mean I fuck with you, bitch, I'm bipolar
I was different, born a misfit, flipped the script when I got older
Money motives, six-oh soldier, can't stop, won't stop, always rolling

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
Trap just like the Waffle House, I fix it right in front of you
Trap just like hibachi, yeah, I fix it right in front of you
Call me Trapperachi, bando speak for me, my numbers proof
Caught me but can't keep me, take my fingerprints and turn me loose

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Ain't even playing no games so I went three hundred on all them doors
Big old four by four, huh, sit up like a dumpster truck
I know you ain't no blunt but if you roll up we gon' light you up
I wouldn't give a fuck, I got my pistol off in every club
I got these drugs for real, for real
I got like five karats in my ear
I let this money fly, I'm for real
I know she thinking I took a pill
Look how I get in her, baby, got stamina
I'm tryna fuck up your mind
We can go diamond shopping off in Neiman's
Yeah, make sure they one of a kind
I got on two six-figure watches
I can't be wasting no time
They took my kindness for a weakness
Fuck it, I'm drawing the line
I just put a four off in my soda
Police pull me over, what's the odor?
I don't know, gave 'em the gas (Skrrt)

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
Trap just like the Waffle House, I fix it right in front of you
Trap just like hibachi, yeah, I fix it right in front of you
Trap suit like designer, yeah, I'm dead fresh when I'm serving you
Extendo got a .223 for each and every one of you
Trap just like the Waffle House, I fix it right in front of you
Trap just like hibachi, yeah, I fix it right in front of you
Call me Trapperachi, bando speak for me, my numbers proof
Caught me but can't keep me, take my fingerprints and turn me loose

[Outro: CUZ Lightyear]
Trap
