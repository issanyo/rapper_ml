[Verse 1: Scotty ATL]
Too cool, I'm too cool, wit my collar part and my hat tipped
I'm the new dude wit the hot line and I'm not lyin'
Nigga wit the club but she not mine, she in love wit the Chevy wit the woodgrain
Said her daddy used to drive one and I said, Chevy got shot make ya feel like you ridin in a boat you can ride you can get good head, would you like that?
And I laugh, I'm the most coolest cat in my class, Sum Cum Laude if I did finish college, I'd be in the Cool Club with them asians and that class
Hood nigga swag but he got good credit, keep shit clean he don't need no edit
Ridin' red candy paint wit them pasta guts and I feel like we ridin' in spaghetti
EA Sports I be on my game, these pussy nigga out here so lame
Can't get mad cause he ain't that cool, I ain't gotta flex I'm just doin' my thang
Doin' my bih, doin' my grind, doin' yo girl, payin' my dues
Boy you got a cheat code in this thang, I done start nigga I can't lose

[Chorus]
Push, Cool, Hustle, Grind
Count, Dough, Ride, Fly

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Check this, okay
I'm blowin' bubble kush while yo broad still chewin' here
Football pockets same size Stewey head
I got that 107.9 rockin' [?]
Understand what E.T. rock, astronaut Gucci specs
We ain't goin' home cause we ain't got no moon coochie yet
Snap a nigga toothless, ya'll are the bootiest
Rottweiler bankroll, ya'll small poochie pet
Two Chainz, Ludacris, state weed, sewage shit (ugh)
Ain't bustin' bitches till they pull up in my pulpit (dear lord)
Old school FILA joggin' suit blue velour that (what you know about that?)
I fuck wit cash cows so you know I'm on that bullshit
Everything cool bitch, Dro be on that hood shit, Dro

[Chorus]
Push, Cool, Hustle, Grind
Count, Dough, Ride, Fly

[Verse 3: Playboy Tre]
Back for the Dec, back for the east, speak that heat nigga back for the streets
Ain't no rest, ain't no sleep, fuck niggas beg while the real niggas eat
Nigga so we eat, and we eat, fuck all night been in it all week
Been in it all month, in it all year, do it for the city nigga and we all here
Way too fresh, way too cool, I'm on that drank nigga way too throwed
Way too lit for the shit that she talmbout, shut yo drunk ass mouth
And yeah they love that, love that, niggas talk but I does that
Gucci clothes keep groupie hoes tryna get between my coupe doors
We the shit fuck who you felt, who you like or who you rep
High class nigga wit a attitude, I smack yo ass wit a Louie belt
Louie belt, Louie shades, ridin' round bumpin' that Juicy J
You say no but I can't though, so gon pour some of that drank hoe

[Chorus]
Push, Cool, Hustle, Grind
Count, Dough, Ride, Fly

[Verse 4: CUZ Lightyear f.k.a. S.L. Jones]
Jonesy
I'm so wavy I'm so wavy, a sniper couldn't graze me
Wifey seem to like me, so they hubbies tend to hate me
Police chase me and I get away, ABN like my nigga Trae
Loco wit my vatos I'm in the trap wit my big cuz Roscoe, say
Sleepin' on a bean bag here full of knots, graduated from a beeper to a phone full of apps
Always on alert trill niggas don't relax, we grindin'
Extra credit when I finish my assignment, too cool you can check my climate
I might be anemic they throwin' it up, yeah I might be bulimic, I'm kind of a genius, I'm sort of a smart guy
Cause this cheese that I'm makin' a smart buy, from the bottom but I'm on the charts high
I'ma G but they love when I talk fly
Cause my lingo, got wings yo
I beef it up and I swing low
Ion even gotta tell em my whole name
They love that nigga named Jonesy

[Chorus]
Push, Cool, Hustle, Grind
Count, Dough, Ride, Fly
Be, You, Not, Me
Too Cool, To Try Ta, Be
Hell yeah they love that
Hell yeah they love that
Face time wit my lights on
Cool shit and they love that
Hell yeah they love that
Hell yeah they love that
Outfit wit no ice one
Cool shit and they love that
