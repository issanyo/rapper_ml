[Intro]
Ooh, heard you got a boyfriend, oh
Go 'head and divorce him, yeah
Oh you say he's just a sponsor, yeah
Well cancel your endorsement
I'm back in the city, act like you miss me
I know you been sinnin', babe, just ask for forgiveness
Wish I could put your pretty ass in a frame
Risk it all to get this money, just to give it all away

[Verse]
Uptown (Goin' up), yeah
You can have your way right now, yeah
Claim the A but you from H-Town
In the A so you claim A-Town, H-Town
Keep it cool if you with me, we just mixin' in the city right now
Bring your squad, whole squad from out of town, Chi-Town
Sleep walkin', nigga head up in the clouds (A-Town)
Take a chance, risk it all, hold it down
Girl, I'm back in the city, yeah (Ooh)
Just getting back to the city (Yeah)
Waking up the city that don't never sleep
In the mix, ain't nothing that hard to reach
We just like each other pics, we don't never speak
Undercover, sweat each other like some leather sheets
You ain't mixin' then it's somewhere that you'd rather be
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, don't lie to me
You ain't got it on lock, you ain't got a key
I don't even know what day it is of the week (Lightyear, Lightyear)

[Interlude]
Gosh golly, shawty popped a molly
Started at the club now we on our way to Follies
Way of life, no hobby
Now she at the hotel, told her meet me in the lobby
Meet, meet me in the lobby, yeah
ATL, ATL, big city of dreams
But everything in the A ain't always what it seem, yeah

[Outro]
She say she from Atlanta but she really from Miami
She say she from Atlanta but she really from Los Angeles
Just moved to Atlanta, yeah, she fresh up out of Dallas
She say she from Atlanta but she really from Chicago
She say she from Atlanta but she really from Toronto
She say she from Atlanta but she really from the NOLA

She say she from Atlanta but she really from B-More
Detroit, Milwaukee, Little Rock, Tennessee
