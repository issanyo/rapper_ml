[Intro: CUZ Lightyear]
Showing out, yeah we doin' what we want to
What we want
Showing out, yeah we doin' what we want to

[Verse 1: CUZ Lightyear]
Taught you how to fold my flag
Get a load and my hoes gon' clash
Trained to go, you know I'm long, not last
Slow it down, don't go so fast
You rollin' with a real one
Run it up, you only live once
From the cradle to the grave, from the bottom to the top, yeah
You don't want no problems, get your partner, time to stop that
Tryna keep it cool, calm, and cozy at the kickback
'Bout to get gone off the Henny, where the cups at?
Posted on the wall, why you lookin' like a suspect?
Who gon' have my back when I need it?
Throwin' up the hood, I know you see it
L lit in the air, where the weed at?
Lucci over coochie, where the cheese at?
My lil white bae from the Bay
She put me up on that Mac Dre
She beg me to stay but I can't
Back to LA, caught that flight like a fade, yeah

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
Recognize when a crip nigga want you
Never mind, you're just doing what you're s'posed to
Ducking like a drive-by when I roll through
Showing out, yeah we doing what we want to
Showing out, yeah we doing what we want to
Showing out, yeah we doing what we want to

[Verse 2: G Perico]
I can show you how to fold this rag up right
Other niggas entertain but this my life
I gotta be the realest, out of South Central
Check my credentials, ain't a loophole in it
I can bring you through the hood, I can take you through the hills
If you give me all your money I can handle all your bills
I'm just being one mil, I'm out here doin' what I want to
Pay attention when a crip nigga want you
If you come through your city and your home girl give me
Just don't get mad and have your attitude shifting
I'm a real one, people made attempts to put a kill on me
Mission failed 'cause I'm out here still thuggin'
Palm trees, and marijuana leaves
Once you get a taste of this life you ain't gon' wanna leave
I'ma tell my whole story, me and CUZ Lightyear
Say you want authentic, bitch it's right here, yeah

[Chorus: CUZ Lightyear]
Recognize when a crip nigga want you
Never mind, you're just doing what you're s'posed to
Ducking like a drive-by when I roll through
Showing out, yeah we doing what we want to
Showing out, yeah we doing what we want to
Showing out, yeah we doing what we want to

[Outro: CUZ Lightyear & G Perico]
Recognize when a crip nigga want you
Ducking like a drive-by when I roll through
Recognize when a crip nigga want you
Showing out, yeah we doing what we want to
Thuggin', palm trees, and marijuana leaves
Once you get a taste of this life you ain't gon' wanna leave
I'ma tell my whole story, me and CUZ Lightyear
Say you want authentic, bitch it's right here, yeah
