[Intro]
Don't waste my money, don’t waste my time
Respect my mind
You don't know me, don't hit my line
You not my kind, it’s just a vibe, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
I don't even know who I'm textin' right now
Got some new ones but I'm scrollin' through my exes right now
If she throw that pussy at me, I'ma catch it right now
I'm feelin’ extra right now, ooh, I’m so extra right now
If you want me pull up on you, come and get you right now
You ain't living for the moment, I’ll forget you right now
I just treat you like you normal but you special right now
I'm feelin' extra right now, ooh, I'm so extra right now

[Verse 1]
It’s just me and all these bottles in this section right now
If 12 knew what I was doin', they'd arrest me right now
Usually think before I speak, I'm talking reckless right now
Pockets full, that scale gon' say I weigh an extra five pounds, yeah
Back on my bullshit
Your pussy so fire, your pussy so fire, you got that Hadouken
You say you feel used, that had me confused, maybe you're useless
I show you the truth, you see what you want, that's called an illusion
You can't get the facts from assuming

[Chorus]
I don't even know who I'm textin' right now
I'm on way too many drugs to use discretion right now
I was curving you at first, you my obsession right now
Yeah, I'm so extra right now, ooh, I'm so extra right now
If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong, I need correction right now
If there's pressure, let me know, I'ma address it right now
On my way back to the future in this Tesla right now
I'm feelin' extra right now, ooh, I'm so extra right now

[Interlude]
Wait, wait, wait
On me, me, me
I'm on the way
Wait, wait, wait
On me, me, me
I'm on the way

[Verse 2]
I'm in your neck of the woods, yeah
I'm on your side of your hood, yeah
Pull up and tell me what's good, yeah
I brought a scale for the jugg, yeah
Free Bird out of jail if I could, yeah
I got it straight out the mud, yeah
You can't take away what I love, yeah
I go beyond and above

[Chorus]
I'm just focusing on me, can't get distracted right now
I'm not use to letting go, well here's some practice right now
Didn't admit when I was wrong, here's my confession right now
I'm feelin' extra right now, ooh, I'm so extra right now
You look like you need a favor, here's a blessing right now
Please take out a sheet of paper, I suggest you write down
All them feelings that you felt, you should express them right now
I'm feelin' extra right now, ooh, I'm so extra right now
