Yikes, wow, yeah
See how this feels, Jonesy

[Verse 1]
Bangin' out a little rocks so these bitches know my name
Feds on my dick, they think I'm selling cocaine
True to the game, I'm so turnt up in this ho
Sippin' icy clean sprite, ain't no syrup off in this ho yeah
Can I get a whole check for these fuck niggas, boppin' off of my fame
Ain't gon be shit when I'm gone, wudn't shit poppin' off when I came
I'm a dope fiends dream, I got everything you crave
That's why you love me like a junkie, poking wholes in they veins I'm the man

[Hook]
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man dope man

[Verse 2]
Dope man dope man, straight glass no coke pan
Frosted Flakes no Oat Bran, self made no spokesman
From the ground up no floor plans, snap-back jordans
High tops flip flops, wrap it up get shot
Great shape I'm in tip top, I ain't said shit my lips locked
Draped up dripped out, Nina with me that bitch cocked
Fifth locked in that fall spyder, no love I got hard problems
Night rider that car talk, transform and that car walk
Look at what I'm doing, looking for the chewing
These hoes on my dick like its made out of Louis yikes
Crowd surfin' in an ocean full of wavy bitches
I got my locs on, I don't see them shady bitches
I got the cut sewn up, no stitches
Call me mug shot shawty, cuz the feds taking pictures
Cup full of mud but ain't no dirt off in my swisha
Yeah my last name Jonesy, don't forget to add the mister I'm the man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fifty eleven hundreds in a dope boy knot
Pink Pyrex, that's a coke boy pot
Your money lookin' funny, you a joke boy stop
Don't be playing with my time, like no broke toy clock
Coolin', bad bitches choosin'
You want to download my wave, swag not included
Break it down sack it up, trap it out and move it
Making plays and hittin' licks to making cash off of music call it evolution
Back to the old me, throw away strap and an Oz
I'm 'bout that I'm 'bout that, in the kitchen bringing that ounce back
Whole thang half price, correct change my swag right
Fresh to death in my past life, with a beige babe she half white
Fast life slow grind, my hustle mean but I'm so kind
You hella suck blow job, my temper short it's like 4'9"
Pica-boo in that dope ride, its ghost white poltergeist
Creep up on you like yikes, broad day light flashin' my brights I'm the man

[Hook]
