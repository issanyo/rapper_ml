[Verse 1: Cuz Lightyear]
True story, no fable
I was watchin' TV through my neighbor
Window 'cause I couldn't afford cable nigga
Nowadays, my neighbor watchin' me
Clockin' me like TMZ, party right next door, I think I'm PND
Jet skiin', water splashin', bitches laughin'
High as fuck up, I'm crackin' up
And I don't even know what happened nigga
Who the fuck? It don't even really matter nigga
All we do is kick it, I don't want her, you can have her nigga, huh
Eatin' good, silver spoon, gold-plated nigga
Plus size pockets, yeah my pockets gettin' fatter nigga
Speakin' broken English, talk some money, fix your grammar nigga
Always rollin', rollin' rich, Rich Jagger nigga
This one for the scammers and the bitches nigga
Them ATMs on camera, takin' pictures nigga
Cabin fever, doin' donuts on a four wheeler
Ice cream man bitch, I think I'm Percy Miller

[Chorus: Cuz Lightyear]
I was scrapin' pots and pans nigga
Scrapin' pots and pans nigga, ha
Don't forget to wash your hands nigga
Keep your 28 Grammys, I want 28 grams nigga

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Me in 90's, livin' grimy, cookin' crack in momma's kitchen
I got halves, I got quarters, 100 dollar slabs and 50s
Swear to God on momma nigga and you know that I ain't religious
My own momma taught me how to whip a chicken in her kitchen
Cut it, bag it, flip it, started buyin' powder
Slingin' hour after hour, they ain't purchase power
Perfect and we purchased ours
And we only workin' workin' hours
Tractor trailor got 'em here in under 30 hours
Although 5 am, them early birdy hours
Fuck the law, 'cause we birdy flippin'
New sheriff in town, this is now a juggin' jurisdiction
Man I pray you dirty snitches, never put me in position
Where I'm forced to murder witness, member of the jury missin'
I'm the trappin' politician, baby kissin', problem fixin'
Started from the bottom, not a pot to piss in
Now I got a lot of collards in my kitchen
Michael motivated on the money makin' mission
Before I made a fuckin' million, I was

[Chorus: Cuz Lightyear & Killer Mike]
I was scrapin' pots and pans nigga (amen)
Scrapin' pots and pans nigga (again)
Don't forget to wash your hands nigga
Keep your 28 Grammys, I want 28 grams nigga
Scrapin' pots and pans nigga
Scrapin' pots and pans nigga
Don't forget to wash your hands nigga
(Don't forget to wash your hands nigga)
Keep your 28 Grammys, I want 28 grams nigga
Scrapin' pots and pans nigga
Scrapin' pots and pans nigga
Scrapin' pots and pans nigga
