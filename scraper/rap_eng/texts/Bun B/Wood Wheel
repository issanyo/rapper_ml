[Intro]
Smoke somethin', bitch...smoke somethin'...

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I'm up early cause my nigga
Don't sell dope after night time
Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch...holla at yo' bitch
Now yo' bitch on my team;
Got her buyin' us sticky green
Lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch
You lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk;
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boys
That's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Pro smoke, pro choke
Anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin'
In criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality
Unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats
And gettin' my dogs some bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble
Write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synch and splits ronicity
Fuck it, take a drink
I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dojer
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya

[Hook: Pimp C]
Rollin' Seville
Grippin' my steel
Might pop a pill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

Sedan DeVille
House on the hill
Countin' up my scrill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

Nigga, how you feel
I feel so trill
Might pop me a pill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

House on the hill
Marijuana fields
Grippin' my steel
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

[Verse 3: Bun B]
They tellin' me, "Bun don't go there"
But, man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas
But scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that barre 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout
Or smokin' that jar 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em
Or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain
And leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em
From P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em
Wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em
To hell to heaven

[Verse 4: Pimp C]
I just spent 60 G's
On a brand new Eldo-reeze:
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac;
Northstar fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke
When my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch
Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant
'84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed-down Screw tapes that knock
Blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhock
Try 20-ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas
'N got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth

[Hook v2: Pimp C]
Fifth wheel and grill
Candy Seville
Might pop a pill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

House on the hill
Still flexin' mils
Countin' up my scrills
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

Comin' down so trill
Nigga, how you feel?
Might pop a pill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

Grippin' the steal
Nigga, I'm so real
Bitch, how you feel?
Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel

[Verse 5: Bun B]
Smokin' on bionic, bubonic, chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic: supersonic like Johnny Mneumonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palacades to the Prominade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play
It don't change, ain't a thang to say

[Verse 6 Pimp C]
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throat and some good skull'
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'mma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go

[Verse 7: Bun B]
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers
Body rockers, late-night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones: guerilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us

[Verse 8: Pimp C]
Touched like Midas, these bitch-ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch-ass niggas ain't got no cheese?

[Hook v3: Pimp C]
Blowin' big kill
Million-dollar deals
Nigga, I'm so trill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

Uh...puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J
Smoke somethin', bitch
