Well, it's big Bun B now, baby, Mr.Woodgrain
With diamonds up against them ballin' through your hood, mayne
And I'm smokin' on some good, mayne, the color purple
Not the movie but the kind that'll have you goin' in a circle
Chrome lookin' more classy than the Transco Tower
Car drippin' candy paint like it just came out the shower
Like 'Face I got the money, the power and the finesse
To roll around one deep with hundred thousand round my neck
I'm lookin' real shiny, you can see me from a mile away
Thought you was doin' it, 'til I came and took your smile away
Pull up on your side in the turnin' lane, pop my trunk
Break you off, chunk a deuce and I'm Cadillac turnin', mayne
Little swang to the left, big swang to the right
My plates scrapin' and I'm slidin' the pipe, it's super tight
So don't try to knock us, baby, don't try to hate
That's how we do it in that Lone star state, get it straight, we be

Now, if you never been to Texas, there's a picture to paint
'Cause we doin' it real big, in case you thinkin' we ain't
It's lots of money on these streets, bein' spent and bein' made
All it take is one look to see these boys gettin' paid
They livin' laid in big houses with pools in the backyard
Certified gangsters so you never see us act fraud
With iced out watches, bracelets, chains
Pieces, teeth, mayne, we throwed in the game
We got screens in that headrest, visors in the ceilin'
On chrome 83's and fours and Vogue peelin'
With bumpers and belts across the back of my trunk
Push a button and my car is waivin' bye to you punk
We from the land of sippin' on syrup and bangin' the Screw
We slab swangin' comin' down and through, I thought you knew
Back in the days, all they ever did was doubt us
Now the South is in the house and they can't do nothin' about us, we be

One time for my trill trill reppin' the block
The real soldiers on the frontline is keepin' it cocked
They hold it down for they hood, throw it up, let 'em see it
So they can know how you G it, if they hatin', so be it
We ain't playin' where I'm stayin' 'cause it's way too real
No matter the situation, gotta keep it trill
Got the steel on my side when I ride 'cause I'm ready
I got 20/10 vision and my trigger finger steady
I'm an Underground King homeboy and not a simp
And I gots to represent 'til they decide to free the Pimp
I'm down for my click, just like I'm down for my block
And I'ma stand up for my partner 'til they let him off of lock
So go on, â€~Body Rock', Southside or â€~Lean Back'
Two-step with your boy if you about your greenbacks
This here is a Texas toast so raise your glass
Because the whole Dirty South is finna show their naked a**, we be
