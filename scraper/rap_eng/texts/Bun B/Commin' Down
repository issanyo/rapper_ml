[Verse 1]
Big D’s blues homie
That ride all on twenty two's homie
Bass hitting so hard that every times
This week I gotta replace the fuse homie
It’s a jungle inside my ride
Alligator skin is like everywhere
Mere allergic to regular
So if it ain’t kush homie don’t put it in the air
And I'm riding round and I'm getting it
Baby ain’t got no time to be hitting it
And you know the limousine tint mean
Mind yo mother fucking business
The candy paint so black look like a licorice stick
He outside of a Bentley in his house shoes
What kind of a nigga is this
The type that left the swingers on it
Caravan yes I am that man
With my name on the grill
And ma name on all the swing
Too straight like batman
My arms stroke as a mother fucker
From lifting lambo doors
Homie you know you baling when you start buying cars to match yo clothes
Got a stash box for that good gram
Got a stash box for that work too
Got ma styrofoam filled to the brim my nigga
If you make me spill it ima hurt you
Screwed up click until I can’t say it no more
And I know the DJ gon play this until he can’t play it no more


[Hook]
Coming down making noise
Candy paint on all ma toys
Dripping water sipping good
What you know about it boy
What you know about it boy
Uh!
What you know about it boy
Coming down making noise
Candy paint on all ma toys
Dripping water sipping good
What you know about it boy
What you know about it boy
Uh!
What you know about it boy


[Verse 2]
Ay let me ride !
Still riding down the block can’t speed through
Going two miles an hour making sure they see you
Trued up and I'm louied up that screwed stuff in my new cup
My top down and my music loud
And I only listening [?] Pimp C and Bun B
Cause them all of my OG
Ball so hard this shit crazy
You can call me Coby
Pimp so hard your bitch pay me
She must have thought that I was Gold D
I'm skating on ice like a goalie
And I when I'm coming down I'm touching the whole street
I'm coming down like a sales price on the volks
Lights on trunk opem selves all over
Searching for that dope eyes open for the paper
Candy apple over silver holding like a state strip
Vogue ties only anything else is blasphemy
Breaking boys off add em to my list of casualty
Vaping wagons slabs in the slabs with that Mistah F.A.B
Bow wow baby paint dripping like a dab

[Hook]
Coming down making noise
Candy paint on all ma toys
Dripping water sipping good
What you know about it boy
What you know about it boy
Uh!
What you know about it boy
Coming down making noise
Candy paint on all ma toys
Dripping water sipping good
What you know about it boy
What you know about it boy
Uh!
What you know about it boy

[Verse 3]
What you know bout chicks
And how them boys be flexing
Right next to them Mexican
State big bank wrote checks in
Repping for ma city so all ma cars pretty
And all ma bras pretty I got some up in yo city
They go dumb up on my dick everytime I touch down
By the way I got a baggage, it just touched down
We smoking bay here where I stay
Y’all don’t know bout that home grown
I stay smoking like [?]
Trample stick got a nigga blown
Bad bitch rolling with me must ain’t got no panties on
All her ass so fat I can’t see her thong
Bay chick got me sprung send me hella drink
I fell in love when she gave me the plug on [?]
I I can’t leave her I need her I treat her
Like she a queen gotta keep baby on team
Gotta keep making this green
Killing boys with them loads
Fucking all ma ghost writers slab then walk next to my foes

[Hook]
Coming down making noise
Candy paint on all ma toys
Dripping water sipping good
What you know about it boy

[Verse 4]
Trilogy, Bun B straight up out that [?]
On that southern swag
So you know  you gots to see me next
Candy painting all that smoking on that ball back
Riding in the saddle boy but I don’t wear no tall hat
New Era’s the snapback
[?] ten gallons
And I don’t ride on the horse
But I might come through with a stallion
That dinner with no jabs
[?] wraps
With my nephew Mistab FABBY
You know all we make is slabs
Gimme that making good man when I'm in yo hood man
Riding in that Cadillac gripping on that wood grip
Make it on the [?] plain and simple if you slow
And if you come from the ghetto player you already know
Keep it G from head to toe
If I'm lying may he strike me
And if you didn’t hate me maybe you could do it like me
Its UGK for life I'm riding for that chance
And when you see a player shining
Show him love he acting bad hold up

Hold up
