[Bun B:]
Man, goddamn I hate a buster!
Talkin' about he shinin but his shit is lackluster. (lackluster!)
No karats in his chain, no cluster!
Nigga you a burger, try to catch up to the mustard! (mustard!)
Lame ass! Who responsible for makin' you?
Phonier than a motherfucker, I can see the fake in you
I can see the Jake in you; you look like a teller (like a teller!)
I ought to shoot ya dog ass, like Old Yeller. (like Old Yeller!)
Fly fella? Hell nah! More like half man;
Half nothin else, it's so sad, I can't laugh man. (man!)
Or even smirk! (smirk!) - Nigga you's a jerk! (jerk!)
You gonna make me have to put in work and go berserk! ('serk!)
Wanna-be-me ass, nigga get off the testes! ('tes!)
The greatest like Gretzky, don't test me (me!)
With flyin' colors, I'll pass your pop quiz
I'm sick, plop-plop, fizz-fizz, you know the biz! (biz!)

[Chorus: Bun B]
We been fuckin' bitches! (bitches!) - We been stackin' riches! (riches!)
We been duckin' snitches! (snitches!) - Get in pussy, niggaaaa!
We been gettin' dough! (dough!) - we been bunch of hoes (hoes!)
With G's and they know (know!) - get in pussy niggaaaaa!
We been sittin' clean! (clean!) - We been gettin green! (green!)
We been on the scene! (scene!) - Get in pussy niggaaaa!
We been gettin' paper! (paper!) - We been shakin' haters! (haters!)
We gon' see ya later! (later!) - Get in pussy nig-gaaaa!

[Bun B:]
Man, goddamn I hate a lame! (lame!)
Green as a garden, talkin' 'bout he in the game. (game!)
Say he got them grams (grams!) - barely got them grains (grains!)
Lyin on your work and it's a motherfuckin' shame. (shame!)
Worst than a dame, always peekin' in your doors (doors!)
Short stop and stains. (stains) - Tryna fuck your hoes! (hoes!)
Trickin' on the cool, nigga payin' for the freaky (freaky!)
It ain't like I care but why your ass bein sneaky? (sneaky!)
To each his own partner; move along, partner!

I don't need a nigga like you in my zone, partner
Give me fifty feet (feet!) - or maybe fifty yards (yards!)
Fuck your fifty town! -? is fraud. (fraud!)
Say you got them yams and you sittin on some yay! (yay!)
Asked him for a ten piece, he hit me with a trey! (trey!)
Got me fucked up, partner; who you tryna play? (play!)
Keep your dirty dope, your shit ain't butter anyway. - O-kay?

[Chorus]
[Young Money Moe:]
You better get in where you fit in
All these pussy-ass niggas jumpin back on my dick again!
Been ridin' clean! - Pull up in the newest Benz! (ch'eah!)
And I never lose. - Bitch I was born to win! (I was born to win!)
Man, all these niggas Powderpuffs
Talkin' tough - all them drugs got 'em gassed up (gassed up!)
And it's "D.O.A." - if Big Capp come! (CAPP COME!)
We'll put your body Underground, you could ask Bun. (ASK BUN!)
I'm the last of a dyin' breed
Thirty karats in the piece got your girl eyein' me. (mommy!)
It's II Trill West, we a dynasty
'Cause I am - what you're tryina be!
Fuck where you're comin' from! - Save your apologies! (save 'em!)
WestSide, a rider got a Makaveli prophecy! (WestSiiiide!)
I'm one of the best that they ever seen
Young Money Moe! - I'm a motherfuckin' prodigy! (prodigy!)

[Chorus]
