[Intro: DJ Michael Watts]
DJ Michael Watts, shoutout to U of H man
What it is, man?

[Hook]
Red, white, Cougars, fight
Red, white, Cougars, let's go

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Touchdown H-town, yeah it's time to celebrate
Thugga never losing, something like the U of H
Touchdown H-town, yeah it's time to celebrate
Thugga never losing, something like the U of H
My city cheer for me and the pretty girls adore me, used to overlook me now it's hard to ignore me
My team stay winning from beginning to the ending
Me and Paul Wall the perfect match like Pat and Keenum
Levis is my denim, all black and white tees
And we gon' fight fight until we seeing victory
All my Cougars ride for me and I'mma rap for y'all
Then we gon' win some trophies, cause we know how to ball
Break whoever, we won't fall, we'll wreck 'em all
And when it's over guess who's still gon' be standing tall?
The H is up, represent

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Bun B]
It's big Bun B, I'm the OG, you know me
Most times I'm staying low key, but today I'm about to OD
This one for the Cougars, so you already know we gon' spell it out
G-O C-O-O-G-S, yes the University of Houston up in your face
Get that bitch, get it up to young Case
You gon' see the Cougars in first place
If that BCS don't know by now, we gon' show them something
Cougars came to play okay, you can put that on Coach Sumlin
It's nothing, got ground game, got air game
Got defense, not fair mayne
And I swear mayne, don't try to disrespect us
Cause when you diss the Cougars man, you dissing Houston, Texas
Hold up

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Ah hell, the red and white
Got a 44 in my Sprite
Them haters up in my sight, but I never run, not quite
Just ask around, that's right
We really not that type
We rarely back down from a fight, been working hard all my life
You evade just where I'm at
So you're slow and you lack
Posted up in front of them Moody Towers, in the downstairs and the back
Big faced paper is what I stack, now somebody gon' hate on that
I've been calling plays like Coach Sumlin, you can go review my stats
Stomping them haters like we was at Rats, competition looking at our backs
I'm out running routes like Patrick Edwards, so a whole lot of yards is what I rack
I'm with Slim Thug and I like this black, white and red, stacking that bread
Putting up wins for the city, just look at that work we did and the blood we shed
