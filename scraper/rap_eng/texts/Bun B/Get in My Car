[Intro: Usher]
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Y'all niggas will never learn
Yeah, Usher, baby
You can't really fuck with me
This club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gone finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Verse 1: Usher]
I know you wanna leave with me
You wanna be seen with me
I can't lie, girl, you fine as hell
And I might let you be with me
I know you wanna come with me
Come take a ride with me
Can't be shy, girl
'Least not tonight, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gone finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
What you gonna do, girl?
Just know that I can have anyone and you if I choose
And I choose you, I choose you

[Break: Ludacris]
I say hey, you, get in my car
Get in my car, you know you wanna roll

[Verse 2: Usher]
Is that your girl looking at me?
Be clear where y'all wanna be
Me on you, her on me
If you feeling free, we can do it three (just playing)
Put all the clothes up
Girl, go make your mind up
Get you back to the crib with your feet up
Make love till it's kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gone finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
What you gonna do, girl?
Just know that I can have anyone and you if I choose
And I choose you, I choose you

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Well, it's big Bun B, the man back in my Bia
Never been an everyday Joe like G.I
Sitting on a stack of greenbacks, about knee high
From the underground, I'm a king like T.I
Son, Bun low-pro like a B.I
Brought back and tell that like I see ya
Bread on the regular, swag, you see mine
Pretty boy Usher, you know that we fly
Fresher than a mall, richer than than a bank
Big body Benz sitting bigger than a tank
Fall up in the club, we gonna buy up all the drinks
And holler at your girl, give a damn what you think
Fuck how you feel, I'ma keep it real
I'ma let your baby girl know what's the deal
Pretty don't pimp, little mama, keep it trill
Drink get low, think you need a refill
Know you with your man and you still go down
Might be a fool, but he ain't gonna clown
He know a real G when he see one
He better get like me and try to be one
You know what it do, let it be done
Get it now before you see it on the re-run
Take it to the spot, get your ass hot
And you can run back and tell your girls what we done
Tell you what? I'ma give you one shot
Give you one chance, girl, show me what you got
Drop it down low, to the floor, let it pop
Twerk that thing, work it, don't stop
Tell your man that his ass out of luck
I'm finna put your bad ass in the trunk
Take you back to the crib and cut
That's what's up (that's what's up)

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gone finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
What you gonna do, girl?
Just know that I can have anyone and you if I choose
And I choose you, I choose you

[Outro: Usher]
I say hey, you, get in my car
Get in my car, you know you wanna roll
Hey, you, get in my car
Get in my car, you know you wanna roll
