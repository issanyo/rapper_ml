[Hook: Black Milk]
In the belly of the beast
I be in these streets
Just a sinner with a Jesus piece

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
More or lesser
Young reckless where adolescence lay out on stretchers
That was the message we were shown
At an early age yeah we was toned
You want in and I want in, you got three then we got fours
Yeah that homework never made it home
But street smarts was evident
Down in them wet alleys instead of pep rallies and lettermans
Jackets that was packed with that black
Metal strap up in that sack
Never know who's friend or foe
Who got your back? Black
Yeah they up out of that slump man where niggas get jumped for jumpmans
Yeah, broken home no father slums and the slaughters
From here to holy water, on my forehead at the altar
Cause you know what they livin' like
So why even bother? Cause you know they ain't livin' right
They out here feeling hopeless they might never leave the bottom
Just some little niggas out here facing grown man problems
Two big homie pull pull up, pull pull up up in that whip
Say "I'll throw y'all a few bucks just ride around with me real quick"
I know what that mean, pull up to the scene with a wild crew
Surround dude screaming "this is what it comes down to", true

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
So, this is what it comes down to?
You and a semi with gladiators around you?
Can't identify the body how they found you
It's gonna take more than a stone pipe and the hounds too
And a Dr. Watson
When I hit your ass with hot ones courtesy of the shotgun
Real nigga, you not one
Trill niggas, you got none
Leave your insides on the floor now you outdone
Son, Imma tell you like your daddy would
Don't play around with this boy gripping Caddy wood
Don't try your luck if I roll through duck!
Cause it's shells on sale, more bang for the buck
Fuck!
No talk I want war with you
Niggas say he want beef, let's have a barbeque
And Imma give him a two piece and a biscuit
Then we put the ox to his tail and cut his ass to the brisket, bitch

[Hook]
