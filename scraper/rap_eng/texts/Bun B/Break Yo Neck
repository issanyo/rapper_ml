[Hook]
See you watching know you watching
Even if I had my fucking eyes closed
See these jackets they be scheming
They be plotting so i keep the .44 close
I Be sliding round the town
When the sun goes down
I pull that thang out no
So I went and got the SLAB
For all the times I never had
When I pull it out Im breaking necks

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
A nigga pull up gotta ice to grill
We don't give a fuck about how you feel
Got big ass diamonds up against the wheel
A nigga hating on a nigga but I keep it close
Coming for my bread I eat your toast
His ice too cold better keep your coat
Got your girl in my room 'bout to hit them notes
50 niggas wanna be me when I hit that coast
I be doing too much living
Man this shit don't post
Not some immature bitches that my dick gone coach
Shoutout my nigga Riff Raff but I don't tip toe
Through your hood come through like fee fi fo
Pop truck on a nigga like he got jokes
Presidential Rolex like he got votes
I don't fuck with these niggas
Man im a popular nigga
I get it popping my nigga
Man you don't got it
I get it
Niggas they wanna get everything
That I got just admit it
Bitch I pull up in something expensive
My bitch explicit
I got a X on the fitted
If you don't grind you don't get it
Nigga don't show em [?]
Nigga im coming to get it
She got my face her tittie
She got my name on her own arm
She got my dick in her mouth
Nigga im running the city

[Hook]
See you watching know you watching
Even if I had my fucking eyes closed
See these jackets they be scheming
They be plotting so i keep the .44 close
I Be sliding round the town
When the sun goes down
I pull that thang out no
So I went and got the SLAB
For all the times I never had
When I pull it out
Im breaking necks

Breaking necks baby (x3)
And turning heads until I start
Breaking necks baby (x3)
And turning heads until I start
Breaking necks baby (x3)
Turning heads until I start
Breaking necks baby (x3)
Break your muthafuckin neck

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Started way back when the game was young
The price was low and the work was plenty
When any time of day
You could get a brick
For 10 nigga but only if your buying 20
If you wanted the green then we could get you pounds
400 dollars but the shit was dirt
And if a nigga talked down when I was around
Then guarantee you ima hit his ass
Right where it hurt
When the paint was glassy
The chrome was shining
You popped the trunk
And then showed them lights
Next thing you know
Ima drop the top
And chunk boys a duece
Cause im holding tight
Fo's and Vo's
That was how it goes
We was coming down
And we was showing up
Now I got the wax and ima blow it up
Kirko got punch so gone pour it up
Represent your hood my nigga
Throw it up gone hold it high
So them boys can see
They know im the man
Yall boys to me
And you know the [?] boys is deep
They got toys with them
And they ready to play
We gone ride for Pimp
Ride for PA
Get ya issue any kind of way
Now watch me and young Kirko ride away

[Hook]
See you watching know you watching
Even if I had my fucking eyes closed
See these jackets they be scheming
They be plotting so i keep the .44 close
I Be sliding round the town
When the sun goes down
I pull that thang out no
So I went and got the SLAB
For all the times I never had
When I pull it out
Im breaking necks

Breaking necks baby (x3)
And turning heads until I start
Breaking necks baby (x3)
And turning heads until I start
Breaking necks baby (x3)
Turning heads until I start
Breaking necks baby (x3)
Break your muthafuckin neck
