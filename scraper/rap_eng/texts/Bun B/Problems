[Intro: Marcus Manchild]
You know what I'm saying?
Niggas don't understand why
What you mean, nigga, why the fuck I pop pills?
Because I want to get away from this motherfucking world
Why I smoke is cause I want to space out
Why the fuck I drink?
Nigga, I drink cause I don't want to feel shit, nigga
Nigga, do you know what I go through on a everyday basis, nigga?
You see the bright lights, you see the fame, you see me at night shining
In the daytime, I'm still a regular nigga
Still walk in the same shoes as y'all, you know what I'm saying?
What you know about dropping out of school and not having no future?
Nigga, my future is this rap shit
So I gotta do it

[Verse 1: Marcus Manchild]
I got a ten month old I gotta look out for
And gotta be here to take care of
It ain't fair cause it ain't her father
She on earth but she don't really know
That her daddy don't make that much
What you think that does to a nigga confidence
Especially when knowing that I gotta be that rock
Just to provide in the night, then I'm committing suicide
Motherfucker, finna grab that gun
Blow my brains out, boom!
And I hope I don't wake up
Hope a nigga meet the maker
Just got a call from my girl saying that she want to break up
I hope it's no child support papers
No, I won't pay cause
Pushing it to the limit and trying to be the father that a nigga never had
I promised myself whenever that I grow up and I have my own kid
That I would be a better dad
I'm stranded
So I turn to bars cause
I got some problems and they feel like problem solvers
Though I shouldn't do that, I'm fucking up my body at the same time
But please don't worry
Talk about the bright lights and the night life
But today I'm finna give y'all true stories
For real

[Hook: Marcus Manchild]
Problems after problems
Wonder why I'm on it
Popping pills, sipping liquor, every day smoking
My baby momma tripping, she say we need some bread
Lord, tell me why my uncle died, I need to clear my head

[Verse 2: Marcus Manchild]
Uncle Ryan gone, I'm thinking that I'm finna overdose
It's truth be told, my nigga, this is real life
It's like somebody straight killed my spirit
Even though it's part of living, man, it still don't feel right
It's like the day I got the call from Austin
I called up Boston, told him that I was lost, he said
"I know it's real bro, but, man, keep your head up"
But it's till I bring my nigga back from the dead
Feeling like I'm tripping but I'm not
My family envying when I call 'em, they act distant
Even though it's partially cause they thinking I'm Hollywood
When they had the funeral and I missed it
Not cause I wanted to
I couldn't see my uncle laying up there, suited up in a casket
Too drastic, made up in plastic
That's something that a nigga can't have, shit

[Pre-Hook: Marcus Manchild]
I got some problems
And that Ciroc is smelling like the problem solver
Even though I shouldn't drink every day
I'm fucking up my body but I can't feel the pain
It can't be sane
Cause when that happen, it don't feel the same because

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
They say life is hard and life is fair
And life is real cause it's long and rough
You gotta be built for it or you get broke down
So don't even fuck around if you ain't strong enough
Catch you looking for light at the end of the tunnel
Can't see behind you, can't see in front of you
No bars on your phone and no pictures on your monitor
Now that's what that bullshit done done to you
Back against the wall, pressure bout to close in
Being real when these other niggas posing
I'm about to be disposing these hoes
When I put 'em on blast and I start exposing
Know that I'm chosen, one of the few
Staying on top -- at least, one up on you
And what you gon' do when that real shit run up on you
And you got no crew? For you gon' have problems

[Pre-Hook]
