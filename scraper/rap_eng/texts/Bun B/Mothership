[Hook: Le$]
Hustling, balling, pimping in my futuristic ride
Got them diamonds on my wrist and got them 'saces on my eyes
I'm floating up to outer space
I'm in that mothership, reclined
I'm on the dark side of the moon
I hope I make it out alive
You damn right

[Verse 1: Le$]
Bright lights, big city
Staying clean like Rawsteen[??]
But I never simp over a bitch, my pimp hand is so mean
This your dream, this my life
Them short days and them long nights
I hit a broad with that long pipe
And hit a hater with a strong right
You trill? I'm triller
Say you ill but mine's iller
Buick crawl like a caterpillar
Better ask your ho, I'm that nigga
Young don, come strong
Rockefeller like a young Sean
Pop the trunk and I pop the pump
Forgive me lord, I done done wrong
I'm keeping it player, these niggas don't live by the code
I stand as a man and I promise I'm never gon' fold
It's hot in the streets and it's making a nigga so cold
Was raised by the g's and I'm practicing what I was told
Look at the grind, look at the shine
There ain't another [??] that you gonna find
Think about yours, don't worry about mine
I'm giving the game, this just ain't a rhyme
See them recline, puffing a black
Roll with the strap, prepare for the jack
Told you them verses [?] is something like crack
Shellshocked, don't make me react, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Le$]
Staying blazed, getting paid
Eyes low behind 'sace shades
L-E-Dollar y'all know the name
But I want the money, fuck the fame
Fuck your dame and I send her home
Bitch smell like my cologne
That [?] nigga, young pretty nigga
I hear you talking but miss me, nigga
84's on poke out, sipping, blowing that smoke out
Potent flow that get you high
I stay spitting that dope out
Ask your ho, she know about it
The way a young nigga put it down
I'm coming up and you talking down
You see them diamonds they make you blind
That digital dash, I'm in that mothership
You see me tipping, never tripping off that other shit
That trunk up, swanging turning that funk up
Yella rolling that blunt up, and now we lighting that skunk up
We blown, on chrome, can't leave the game alone
My hat tippin, my wrist lit you see i'm in my zone
That wood gripping, she on dick, your bitch just wanna bone
I been a king and I do my thing in my alligator throne
Nigga!

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Big Bun B, that trill OG
That gangster nigga, etcetera
I'm sitting back in my Cadillac
Up the boulevard I'm headed bruh
I'm g'd up to the letter bruh
And that letter go by the letter P
Now add 3 more then add your ho
Don't get my dough, she better be
My style, my swag my pedigree
My strap my [?] I'm fitted up
Candy car, my cup of barre
My chrome lady I set her up
On 84's, my pretty fo's, my leather seats, all touch and stitch [??]
My dick is wet, her pussy's stretched
So I guess you know I fucked your bitch
Nothing left for me to do
But send her back from where she came
Don't know her number, or her name
Yeah in the south, we call it game
I run my mouth, like it's the hundred
If it's out here to do, big Bun'd done it
And my thang is tight, all through the night
Tell the trick go home man, the sun is coming
You might be too young to understand it
Too green to comprehend it
No matter how I explain it or send it
So stop it with the pretending
And slow up with that other shit
I'm Captain Kirk, let's put in work
Girl climb up in this mothership, let's go
