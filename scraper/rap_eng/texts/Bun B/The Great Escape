[Intro: News Report]
Yesterday at 11 PM at O'Shea penitentiary two prisoners broke out of their cells, eventually going on a shooting spree against guards. One is confirmed dead by police and the other one is still missing, thought to have escaped in the sewer area below the prison. When the police searched the area, the last thing they found were prison clothes and a discarded pistol

[Verse 1]
They said it's lights out, pretending to sleep in the bunk bed
Snuck out, distract the guard; punched him  in the nose, he's struck dead
Grab the keys, unlock the cells
Stole the guard's Glock like we have no shot in hell
Brush my teeth, sharpen the end
Scrubbed another motherfucker out, it's all a part of the plan
Unlock the next cell over, now we sneaking through corridors
Hearing ominous sounds like I'm listening to horrorcore
Hide the body in the broom closet, who's watchin'?
Murdering people in our path, I guess that's just loose plottin'
Who's droppin'? Everyone was just one in the same
Either we invisible, or we puttin' one in your brain
I can't believe it, we actually escaped Block Eight
We gotta stay on our toes though, cause our luck is not fate
Look out the windows, see patrols and the cop gate
We made it to the armory, cause police ain't harmin' me
Top shelf, giant machine gun; friends in high places so pardon me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We bust out, watch as the cops notice
See the snipers around us moving in and out of focus
They be swarming us like locusts
We need to get the fuck out before this shit become hopeless
We runnin', we gunnin', we disputin' and shootin'
We be usin' our deuces, we think we be losin'
But nah we made it across with no injuries
They closing in tho, ain't no way they be hitting me
I shouldn't have said shit, I got hit in the shoulder
The blood is flowing slowly, the night's getting colder
We break through Block Two and it's all on high alert
You getting in our way and everyone is getting murked
Shit I run out of pistol and assault rifle ammo
I get into the dark, combined with the outfit, it's camo
Near a sign that says exit, yo pass me the vest
Let my accomplice tell your ass what's happening next

[Interlude: Bun B & Guards]
I told ya'll I don't know shit
Oh, you don't know anything huh? You were cellmates with the guy!! You had to know something
I don't know shit, and If I did know shit, I sure as hell wouldn't tell you ya stupid fuck. Especially considering that I'm in here for the rest of my motherfucking life
Take this fucker back to his cell, beat the shit out of him. And someone tell me about the accomplice

[Verse 3: Liiight]
My nigga wet and I’m out of breathe
I should’ve utilized that weight set
Out of shape from chow and skipping reps
Now we running from niggas with bulletproof plated vest
I told him keep running no matter what
Towels for the razor wire so a nigga won’t get stuck
Bullets smashing the dirt and ricocheting back up
Back up Back up
The call over the radio
High risk on the loose
They don’t want us to fly the coup
Shoot shoot shoot
On sight they let it rip
Burning sensation quick
I got pierced by hollow tips
Losing my grip
Slip slip slip
I’m falling I feel the trip
I’m calling like “RUN THAT SHIT”
I’m tossing him all the towels
My nigga done scaled the tower
With the last ounce of my power
In my very final hour
I say “You can’t keep us caged”

[Outro: Kane, Noises]
Gunshots
Come on dude what the....oh shit!!!
Gunshots
Fuck it I'm out!!
Gunshots, sounds of sewer grate opening
