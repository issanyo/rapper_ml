[Verse 1: Bun B]
Now, from the city that I live in
To the city where I'm from
For all the hoes that we done did
And the hoes that we ain't done
From the ones that fuck for shrimp
To the ones that fuck for cum
If you ain't fittin' ta fuck Pimp
Then you ain't fittin' ta fuck Bun
Got some hoes from the 'hood ('hood)
That live to keep it live (live)
And some office buildin' boppers (boppers)
Workin' 9 to 5 (five)
Even ball player baby mama bitches;
But to me it ain't no thang
Let that monkey hang, baby
Let me see it

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Go'on and let a nigga peak
And let a nigga poke
Go'on get naked for me, streak
And let a nigga stroke
See, I know that you a freak
So pass it to my folk
We'll be bustin' in yo' cheek
'Til you muthafuckin' choke
It's nothin' but a G thang, baby, when you suck it
Steady frontin' in yo' G-strang
Go'on lemme fuck it
See, we know that you a pro (pro)
So take it and tuck it
We some grown muthafuckas
Like ta get naked bucked
From the back, to the front
And to the side
In the 'Lac, wit' a blunt
Now, where the light?
It's a fact, I've seen it
Lemme get in between it
Now, over bend once again
Bitch and show it like ya mean it

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Uh...take it off, bitch
Bend over, lemme see it
I'm Sweet James Jones
And a trick: I couldn't be it
Got a young brown stallion
And she 20 years old
When she pop it from the back
You see that hairy asshole
From the A-T-L hoes, to the H-town strippers
To the boppers in DeVille
Suckin' nuts and pullin' zippers
Now, it how it make ya feel when you see a pimp shine?
Bitch, you wastin' too much time
Get back up on yo' grind

[Verse 4: Pimp C]
I'm a country-ass nigga
I fuck wit' yo' wife
If yo' bitch come around me
Put some dick in her life
Them niggas ain't real
Must'a started smokin' rocks
It all fell down
Cause they was bitin' too much Pac
But what goes up, must come down
While these bitches suckin' dick
And droppin' to the ground
Every city, every town
I'm ballin' in the mix
I'm servin' niggas bricks
Keep a bad yellow bitch
On my team, sippin' lean
Ain't a thang of the past
The '84 Beritz with the slant-back ass
Keepin' me a pro, next to my folk
Instead of stackin' cheese
He steady screamin' to that ho
Let me see it

[Outro: Pimp C]
Fuck-ass nigga
Ol' fuck-ass nigga, get yo' mind on yo' money
UGK, bitch
Representin' that South
And this ain't no muthafuckin' hip hop records, fuck ass nigga;
These country rap tunes
So, you could separate us from the rest..
Like I tol' you the last time
Niggas talking that shit on ya records
Forget' the dick in yo mouth
