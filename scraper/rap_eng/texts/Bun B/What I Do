Uh, I see 'em try but they can’t do what I do (what I do)
What I do (what I do)
Yeah, and I’m gon’ die before the day that I lose (that I lose)
That I lose (that I lose)
Bitch I am the man muhfucka, the man muhfucka
Bring the horns in like I am the band muhfucka
Talking bands muhfucka, bands muhfucka
'Cause this kid is worth a couple hundred grand muhfucka
And I stand muhfucka, never ran muhfucka
I ain’t backing down I put that on my fam muhfucka
Damn, I’m so hot you’ll catch a tan muhfucka
No cam, this is really who I am, wassup?

[Verse 1: Bun B]
They say everybody been waiting to see the OG skatin'
On fo’s and Vogue’s, no Dayton
Their license plate just draping
I’m the topic of conversation
When it comes to the one they hating
But I don’t start over-compensating
I just brush it off, it ain’t nothin'
I’m the Trill OG of that dirty
I put in work so I’m worthy
And I’m hotter, than a hat on a giraffe sittin'
In the slizzab sittin' on 30’s
So don’t act like you ain’t heard me
Cause I’ll have to slap some sense in you
And you know what I've done, you know what I'm doing
Let me tell you what I'm fin to do (wassup)
Finna put my city on the map (ok)
Then I'm going to keep it there (that’s tight)
Post up in a tight spot (alright)
Then bring my people there (that’s wassup)
Teach them how to grind, how to climb on that fucking ladder
How to keep that money on their mind and make their pockets fatter
Cuz the only thing that matters loyalty, honor, and the G-Code
That’s how you motivate and shift yourself into Bun B mode
MGK man they already know that we throwed
So we gon’ hit’em with a full clip if it don’t work
Then we reload them up

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Star status, big dip
Levi weed, big zips
Fuck the lies from them big lips
That’s small time for my big dick
"Damn that boy done got big quick"
Probably cause I kept Faith like BIG’s chick”
Probably be a good time for my name switch
To Puff cause’ I'm back on my big shit
This shit’s too real for ya’ll
Cause almost everybody rapping isn’t real at all
Sometimes I forget I got a deal cause’ I’m busy thinking about
When I couldn’t get a meal at all
So everybody going through it, I can feel for y'all
And everybody in my team, I would kill for y'all
Represented for my city from the beginning
So I’ma be in it until the muthafuckin ceiling falls
I’ma Cleveland dog, damn right
In the crib blowing loud like bag pipes
I am from a place where you never see the sun in the summer
Its like you under a cave with stalagmites
“Oh is that right?” Better know your way around here 'fore you come
Cause’ you may never get back right
I am from a town where every one of the bats bite
So you need a shit-load more then a flashlight, yeah
What they gonna do to me? I live this shit
Doc said I had a loose screw fix the shit
Everything you trying to do, I did this shit
Here’s y'all grave, dig the shit
I’m done with the games, I ain't playin'
I’m Machine Gun Kells, bitch I’m sprayin'
Body full of chemicals so roll up the medical
Muthafucka let me catch this plane, gone
