[Hook - Bun B]

Let's make it pop just like a wedding shell
Let's make it pop just like a wedding shell
Let's make it pop just like a wedding shell
Let's make it pop just like a wedding shell


[Verse 1 - Adil Omar]

I've got my phasers on stun
And if I live just like my daddy I'll be dead at 41
And there's no cure for these genetics
I take no measures
In a land of cricket bats
And gods and generals and guns
Black label, Hitchens' portions
Little green bag like I'm Mr. Orange
Robin Hood with a fist of fortune
Mother Teresa; kiss the orphans
Heal the sick like a feudal Jesus
My skull is a pool of secrets
Fuck a thulla, corrupt policemen
Gave me beatings cause of who I eat with
Make bonds with the arms of henchmen
Charlton Heston gun collection
Laid out in the bedroom, I shit you not playa
Tons of weapons
And a hun's aggression
Gangsta rap be my son's obsession
And stay addicted to seduction
But that's just one confession
Here's my one concession
Can't stay sane in this one direction
Can't face pain, man, fuck depression
Sip this poison; love and blessings
They say the mavericks get sent to hell
So make that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell

[Hook - Bun B and Adil Omar]

Let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell
Let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell
Let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell
Let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell

[Verse 2 - Bun B]

Hold up
OK the trill OG is coming through
Live my life just like my daddy, still alive at 42
Will I live to 43, guess you'll have to wait and see
Until then I'll keep it G, be the same ol' big Bun B
Raised among the wolves
Ran the planes and ate the livestock
If I saw my natural prey, I had that 45 cocked
I was born a carnivore, learned how to live off leaves
Now it's only 40 ounces when I run with 40 thieves
It's nothing up my sleeves
I wore my tank top
Sound off, hitting rounds go off
See that tank pop
Nothing to alarm you, cause it's not meant to harm you
That's just how we celebrate
Making bullets levitate
Better not be featherweight
Cause this ain't for the weak (why?)
Cause where these brothers come from
You could die for what you speak
So let your voice be heard
If they hate it, fuck it, give 'em hell
And let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell


[Hook - Bun B and Adil Omar]

Let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell
Let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell
Let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell
Let that motherfucker pop just like a wedding shell
