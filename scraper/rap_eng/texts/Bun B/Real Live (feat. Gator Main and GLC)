INTRO:
Bitch dont play
For real
It P.I
No bullshit
Back up off me
Im so serious bout this
Im So serious bout this
Move around bitch if you ain't dyin move around bitch
Church on the move

Say bitch you fuckin with a boss
Trill O.G. that didn't come to take a loss
I paid the cost to be who I are
And they know it when they see me ridin my car
Candy, with the dro inside a big jar
Im bout to roll that mother fucka in a cigar
And when the swisha sweet is hit Id be careful
That smoke will have you coughin all your shit up

Im in my everyday get up
Black tee, levis, jordans, and them diamonds that stay lit up
You wanna be like Bun Beeta step yo shit up
Nigga this is playa school pay attention sit up
Cause big daddys on the block
Smokin private stock and his bitch is sellin cock
Hit the block grab the cash, get the g's and get the doe
And if you never did this shit befo, you can hit the door

2X CHORUS:
I need a real live hoe, (live hoe)
That'll pick it up and drop it to the floor, (to the floor)
Fo sho, now bust it open let me see it
If youre lookin for a man hoe you know I can't be it, (can't be it)

I needa real live bitch
To get out on that block until her daddy get rich
Now come and let a nigga put you on my gift list
This rep a lot bitch, grab a shovel dig this

Broke bitch get a hustla flip this
If you don't like it you can raise like a lift kit
Lil bitty boy I was lifted
Off of kush smoke 7 grain I must of missed it
I started blowin up like some bisquick
Fish stick ass nigga plex it was dismissed
My name be on top of nigga's hit list
Betta yet my name be on top of a nigga's wish list
Canary diamonds lookin like a piss test
Shawtty wanna be with me she betta be a rich bitch
Or she betta be a dime done diva when I'm down in H Town fuckin around with Bun Beeta now

2X CHORUS

Everywhere I go hold up pimpin is respected
Hoes keep a playa chose, honor and except it
Astonishin collective, my ism is effected
Wake up to some pressed clothes, pussy, and some breakfast
Pimpin is a threshold, physically neglected
Women call my phone and plee for GLC to smash this
Tryin to check on me and see what they can come and help with
Beezies is some L.I.G.'s they wasn't on the shelf bitch
Just because your man be there wearin that wear thats got some velvet
He is least intreguin so I call him Robert Redford
Get an A for effort
That when situations lead to somethin desperate
I'm at another airport
Church is on the move, ew
Let me be your shephard
The mackin Moses I was on it
I was caught up in the moment
Mackin moment of a tone
Askin me to be your man
When you know the answers no, bitch

4X CHORUS
