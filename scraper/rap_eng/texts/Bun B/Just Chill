[Hook: Kobe]
I'mma just chill, lay low and stay breezy
Out here these streets is so greasy
That's why I get high
I'm in the coupe, finger to the sky
Doing about 100 in the fast lane windows wide open
Doing about 100 in the fast lane windows wide open
Screaming out fuck the world

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
My baby mama tripping, my son need Pampers
I'm itching for a cigarette, my lungs need the cancer
My liver's asking where the liquor's at
And more money more problems is the anthem
Sing along if you know this song
An ex con turned good, forced to turn back hood
Turn loose to a world no good, every application rejected because of his record
A lot has seen this movie to the credits
Living in this ghetto with no question
High blood pressure, stressing, high gas prices searching for a high to suppress it
Some people turn to the church and search all hope
Looking for that ribbon in the sky
But there's a chair and a rope for most who can't hope
And a note when their last tear cry, goodbye

[Hook: Kobe]
I'mma just chill, lay low and stay breezy
Out here these streets is so greasy
That's why I get high
I'm in the coupe, finger to the sky
Doing about 100 in the fast lane windows wide open
Doing about 100 in the fast lane windows wide open
Screaming out fuck the world

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I mean I'm sick of lies they keep telling me
The bullshit propaganda that they're selling me
I just caught another felony and mama saying this time is all on me
She ain't bailing me out, no money for a lawyer so I'm stuck with a P.D
Repping on the side with a CD
I keep asking him how does my case look
All he do is tweet and update his facebook
I had a fight last night on the tier, gave me 6 more months, I'm looking at a year
Say he want revenge I'mma show no fear, don't make me have to earn another tattoo tear
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Because these 4 walls got me going crazy
My shawty 'bout to have my baby, so me I gotta get it, no if, ands, or maybes so fuck the world

[Hook: Kobe]
I'mma just chill, lay low and stay breezy
Out here these streets is so greasy
That's why I get high
I'm in the coupe, finger to the sky
Doing about 100 in the fast lane windows wide open
Doing about 100 in the fast lane windows wide open
Screaming out fuck the world

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
The game different, these young bucks got it twisted
All this snitching I can't get with it
I just seen dudes sell with a lizard that hug they kids and kiss their wife on a visit
These young chickens out here bumpin' kittens, male teens and skinny jeans they're out here switching
Mike check listen, the glove glisten, the moon walk, the Thriller theme the jacket, a hundred zippers
The earth shifting, the earth speaking, earthquakes in China tsunami and Cali drifting
I'm trying to circle the Ka'baa but try and kiss it
If you believe all you can be then why enlist in?
All you Oil thieves in foreign lands without permission, open your eyes and ears, people listen
The last days is here dawg, the time is ticking
Until judgment day clear

[Hook: Kobe]
I'mma just chill, lay low and stay breezy
Out here these streets is so greasy
That's why I get high
I'm in the coupe, finger to the sky
Doing about 100 in the fast lane windows wide open
Doing about 100 in the fast lane windows wide open
Screaming out fuck the world
