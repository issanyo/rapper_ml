[Intro: Jared Evan]
(?) I'll always love you
That's (?) what always goes around you
(Statik Selektah)
(?) without you

[Verse 1: Bun B]
I had good days and bad ones
Man I had happy days and sad ones
Days when I didn't want to come outside
And days when I just shrugged it off and just let shit slide
Looking back at my life, the ups and the downs
I got no regrets cause your boy's still around
Found a little spot in the shade and I post it
Rolled up a blunt, sat back, and got roasted
They said I ain't supposed to be here
But man 20 years later I'm still the trillest OG here
Still flower the clothes and I still flip flows
Slip out with your hoes and I still rip shows
I suppose it was just the way I was raised
To always keep it trill until the last of my days
I do it for my hometown of PAT
And to the memory of the great late PIMP C
But that's just me

[Hook: Jared Evan]
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 2: Posdnuos]
Without me in the game I don't think the game would ever be the same
Not because I'm not ill it's just the will of designer physics
If I'm erased away from time the lines you quote from me would have not been written
Few (?) would have remained hidden
The '89 makeover when it came to takeover the lane would have not happened the same that year
Without me here the woman in my life wouldn't have had to shed one tear
At least not due to me (?) pursue the plea of guilty your honor
Honorable  comma wouldn't chase
Me doing the tour life leave me absent from abstinence
But in my defense
If (?) 4%ers that know me it wouldn't be 4 kids on this earth that I helped birth so

[Hook: Jared Evan]

[Hex Murda]
It ain't over yet, motherfuckers, this is Hex Murda, and you're to the beat stylings of that bastard, the one and only Statik Selektah. Feel privileged, you fucks. And now introducing, the honorable, Dr. Octogon, himself, Kool Motherfucking Keith

[Kool Keith]
That's what I say, oh yeah, Statik Selektah, Kool Keith, That's What I say, that's what I say
