[Chorus: Gary Clark Jr. & Bun B]
I think there's blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh
I think there's blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Late night in the Caddy, just rollin' through the hood
Known to act bad, but tonight it's all good
Just picked up a Michael Vick of that dro
Can't wait to get to the crib so I can blow
Half a mile away from the house, I hit Valero
Grab a couple packs of some 'rillos and a Modelo
Roll one up and throw the 'bacco out the window
Pull out of the parkin' lot and fire up the indo
Inhale, goddamn, big puffs of smoke
Exhale, now it's time to take another toke
But in the rearview, man, I can see me some headlights
Next thing you know, the fuckin' blue and the red lights
These streets never have police patrollin' em
When they supposed to, now I'm lookin' for the Ozium
Tryna stash the weed somewhere he can't see
That's when I realized that I got my pistol on me
Goddamn

[Chorus: Gary Clark Jr. & Bun B]
There might be blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh
There might be blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Yeah, yeah
Officer man, I'm a part of the police force
But I don't walk or beat or ride on a police horse
In my patrol car late night ridin'
Workin' in the same community that I reside in
I saw the pain in the city and couldn't stand it
Crimes committed and no one was reprimanded
The conditions in my city was gettin' bad
So I hit the academy and walked away with a badge
I need to piss so I stop at the Valero
I see a guy buyin' some Swishers and a Modelo
Please don't light it up 'til you're home, that's what I'm hopin'
That's when I see him dump his tobacco and start smokin'
I pull up right behind him and hit the light
If he admit he got some weed I'ma let him make it tonight
As long as there's no warrants and he's legal in the streets
That's when I see him reach under his mothafuckin' seat, goddamn

[Chorus: Gary Clark Jr. & Bun B]
I see the blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh
I see the blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I pull over to the side tryna stay calm
Whole car smellin' like fire, straight napalm
I know my gun ain't got no bodies
Got haters up off me but ain't shot nobody
Should I tell him I'm packin' but ain't got no 'plex?
Or just let him find that ho and wait and see what's next
What if he's a killer cop like I've seen on the news?
Should I shoot his ass first? Goddamn, I'm confused

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Okay I checked his plates and they came back clean
But I still better call some backup to the scene
I don't know what he was reachin' for so I'm feelin' nauseous
I just wanna make it home so I'm tryna be cautious
Got a couple of arrests, but ain't no convictions
Get out the squad car and my adrenaline kicks in
So not knowin' if he's committed any prior harm
I walk up to his car with my hand on my firearm
