[Intro]
Chi town what up?
It's DJ Moondawg gettin' too stupid
Now check this out, man
I got a new banger for my brother Naledge
We gonna take this on, we at the Ace Baller
And it's going down right now, total cezar
It's a new joint, a'it?

[Hook]
We be in it, they tripping
One way gripping
On the corners where they blacked out
From what they were sipping

[Verse 1]
Hey, Spot, I'm the man
Chevy trunk sound like a marching band
And I didn't came out, it's all good
Joy feeling me? Women all would
Driving down the block
Like what else would a brother do?
Driving down the block
Getting stains like it's something new
She said she want me
What else is new?
You say you got a man
Well, bitch, what you expect to do?
Cause summertime [?]
Ain't no romance, we fucking on the late
We ain't got to hold hands
Round up in my club
Pussy in my lap
Girl I'm trying to cut
[?]
I ain't gonna save you
But I might come to your rescue

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Just getting head right now
When the G
Bip, bip, bend it over
Till' I fuck you to the beat
Bip, bip

[Verse 2]
Psycho drama all blasting a ride
Women big and a bag full of eyes
Now we sitting in the back of the ride
And I really want to take a ho back for the night
It's sundown, it's sundown
My knees don't come down
It's once in a lifetime
Girl, come have some fun now
Bar Louie, table shots
Pyramid full of glasses on the table top
My niggas zone told me I ain't have to pay
Feel like ew, cause' the day was a good day
One night stands ain't really that bad
One night stand was the best I ever had
Lighting up Cohibas, they don't let me drive
Feeling like I'm Jack Butler
Never let a nigga ride with me

[Hook]
