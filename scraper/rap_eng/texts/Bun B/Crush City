[Intro]
Yo wassup, this is Trill OG out the 409. Bun B, you know I rep UGK for life. But it's October and the Houston Astros is in the playoffs, baby. We in the postseason and it's about to go down. So if you got love for the Houston Astros like the Trill OG got love for the Houston Astros, and you rocking your orange and your blue, you know what it's time to do. Put your Hs up in the air baby, let's go!

[Hook]
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Now put your Hs in the air if you with it man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Now put your Hs in the air if you with it man

[Verse 1]
It's the Houston Astros and we back in
Won the Wild Card, sent the Yankees packing
Yeah, now the Astros are in the playoffs
If you thought we wouldn't make it you was way off
This the payoff, playing in October
If you up against us then it's over
Talking down we don't listen to what you say
We keep it 200 like the hits from Altuve
H-Town you don't want it down here
We got Carlos Correa, he's the Rookie of the Year
With Keuchel on the mound, backed up by Tony Sipp
Not to mention Evan Gattis and Conger, don't trip
With Rasmus, Gomez, and Springer on deck
Chris Carter and Luis Valbuena, it's gon' wreck
So show us some respect, we came to lay the muscle down
Turning up in Club Astros for Hustletown

[Hook]
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Now put your Hs in the air if you with it man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Now put your Hs in the air if you with it man

[Verse 2]
Postseason, we done made it to the first round
Headed to Kansas City to put the hurt down
And ain't nobody down here scared of KC
So if you think we won't win then you crazy
The Astros are in the zone
Plus you know Dallas Keuchel ain't losing at home
So I think it's fair to warn you
That I'mma have my beard and my red tee on in Keuchel's Korner
We [?] and we almost there bro
So hey Colby, don't dry your hair bro
And believe me, it's really no love lost
When Gattis knock it out the park with his gloves off
Now that's old school just like me
Headed to the World Series, we just might be
But we gon' take it one game at a time
Never fold under pressure when game's on the line
Hold it down
