[Verse 1: Bun B]
They say the meek shall inherit the earth
Well I'mma fuck Meek daughter
Marry her than kill Meek's father
Once his ass die and she inherit the shit
Man I'mma cock back the heat and straight bury this bitch
Bun B, carnivore, a predator
Wanna war get your metal up
I'm the victor, niggas settle up
Next up, bring me another competitor
Set him up and I'mma shut it down, bet it up
Straight fact, cock the eight back and wet him up
Shit feels so good I just might get a nut
No homo
Kill his ass for free and call it promo
Yo ass I'mma do you for the low low
Pull out the fo-fo
The bullet flies so fast
But when it hits yo' ass, you gon' die so slow
It'll seem like an eternity, but it was a flash
And then it was over and that was your ass

[Hook: Bun B]
We them, bad things that go bump in the night
And we them, boogiemen that have you jumping with fright
So when we come out of the shadows and black your eye
You better, cross your heart and hope to die
Cause you can
Talk the talk, but tell no lie
And you can walk the walk, just walk on by
Cause we are killers by nature and that's no lie
You better, cross your heart and hope to die

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
This is the crown jewel of my symphony of an animal
I jump out the shadows and ravel when God is mad at you
I promise you, my imbalance is chemical
You know how many prescriptions get ran through like Karen Steffans genitals
Anticipating your death
The left side of my brain ain't thinking right
And in the right side there is nothing left
Last breath struggle
I think outside the box to put you inside of a box like a crossword puzzle
.380 with the muzzle
Be afraid like I'm Haiti trouble
Never half hustle, shoot Russell in the calf muscle
I'm the reason for your homies disappearances
But keep that off the record like songs with no sample clearances
All that fearless shit perishes when I'm striking
These niggas is so over the hill it's like they hiking
Hide your baby's mama
You don't want no drama
Chino got more Llamas than a middle eastern farmer
Damage yukata, leaving your body eviscerated
Committed acts ungodly, worser than you anticipated
No take no prisoners, nigga we just don't want 'em
We murder every soldier that they send until they stop coming

[Hook]
