[Intro: Pimp C]
Take it off..
Baby take it alll.. off..

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uhh, take it off chick, bend over, let me see it
If you lookin for a trill-type figure, let me be it
Got the V-12 Benz, parked outside
It ain't enough room to fit dem guls in my ride
It's onna, work somethin, twerk somethin basis
Makin big change, dancin in them tricks faces
She sleep in the day, but bounce her booty at night
You kiss that thang in her mouth but she been playin with my pipe
Now get your mind right, hater, you a simp (a simp)
And I'm a red hot undercover pimmmmmp (pimmmmp)
That make them guls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Like a real live money makin pro, uhh

[Chorus: Pimp C]
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

[Verse 2" Bun B]
Unh..
It was a Secret that Victoria tried to hide
A little sly delight, I done pushed my pride aside
Just to slide inside, man I done died tonight
Now what I'm 'sposed to do? Been got close to you
Lookin like a poster to, don't wanna boast but you Missus
Do a Dr. Feelgood, lay a playa real good
Limpin came back, and it was still good, she will
Put a few tips in her mouth, that's that definition
Of them true chicks in the South, let me do my thang
On the cool quick to the cock, get the beds but guess what?
We kickin them out, shakin it soft, shoulda been here
She did eight in the loft, but you was late and you lost
Man she was takin it off

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
I'm steady touchin' with my diamonds on, and man I
Miss that boy Pac, sippin' liquor tryin' to grip the chrome
I keep a chip off in my cell phone, they used to call me Pimp C
But now the chicks they call me James Jones
And if I skip I'm back to D-slangin, keep them boys nod-headed
Keep the boppers with they butts swangin
I used to be the young playa holdin
Now I leave them guls with they jellyroll swollen, I'm rollin

[Chorus: Pimp C]
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Comin direct from the Gentlemen's, full of the Phenergan
Live on stage fellas, this is Cinnamon
Fine, Black and feminine, I'm fin to win, look at the sin I'm in
Full of hallucinogens, me her and her friends
Now the venom in my snake, wanna poison
Come in with a brother and the boys and
Make sure you don't forget to bring the toys and
We stuck it check it, we gots to keep em gettin bucked naked
Makin it soft, we keep these boppers takin it off

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

[Outro: Pimp C]
