(Hook, Akon)
That girl, she got me
Way she movin in place
Bendin over, spreadin eagle
All that ass in my face
She got me hard as hell
Got me pokin like a nail
She got me hard as hell
I can't control it
Can't you tell, baby

(Verse 1, Pimp C)
Show me what'cha workin with (With)
Ever got knocked off on a bumper kit? (Kit)
I keep a gold magnum rubber with some KY (Y)
Try to see where I'm comin from, get it in ya eye
I like when ya get doooown, like a girl suppose ('Pose)
Roll on it, don't forget that shit up out'cha nose (Nose)
Is that where all ya money goes? (Goes)
I spend mine on Benz and Roll's-
Royces choices, get on the pole
Slide down, move around and bring the money back home (Back home)
Heeee ain't Pimp, he's a clone
Girl wanna eat my dick when they smell my cologne ('logne)
I'm so throwed in the game like Pat (Pat)
The girl can't ball, but the motherfucka fat (Fat)
Giiirl, what'cha gon' do with all that?
Pimp C, ya need some cheese, I'll hit'cha from the back (From the back)

(Hook)
That girl, she got me
Way she movin in place
Bendin over, spreadin eagle
All that ass in my face
She got me hard as hell
Got me pokin like a nail
She got me hard as hell
I can't control it
Can't you tell, baby

(Verse 2, Bun B) [Akon]
She was 36-24-40
Centerfold stallion, the life of the party
All eyes on her (her), and that goes for me too
Five inch heels and a dress that's see-through [Dress that's see-through]
As soon I saw her, I knew that it was time (It was time)
As soon as she saw me, she knew that she was mine (She was mine) [She was mine]
If this is a dream, then I don't wanna wake
And if this is good as it seems, come on you gotta shake [Gotta shake it]
I might as I will, it look like crump drew her
If she'll step to me, I'm finna run to her
And off-top man
My mouth, it dropped man
For a minute, it felt like the world just stopped man [The world just stopped man]
Started again, now I'm startin to feel [Stopped man]
Like I could really give baby girl the heart of the trill
And once you got the heart, you got the dough [Heart man]
But right now, we gots to go [Got to]
Cause baby girl gots to know

(Hook)
That girl, she got me
Way she movin in place
Bendin over, spreadin eagle
All that ass in my face
She got me hard as hell
Got me pokin like a nail
She got me hard as hell
I can't control it
Can't you tell, baby

(verse 3, Pimp C)
They boys, we men
They on bended knee
Make it dissappear, you want the Texas-T
Girls in France like Texas-D
They say "Ohh-la-la, ah-wi-wi"

(Bun B)
Murcielargo, coupe
Baby girl you know you
Got the hot bun and that, my knife gotta go through
Sometimes it cut slow, sometimes it cut quick
It don't matter because it's still good dick, c'mon

(Akon)
Shorty got me swollen now
She can see what a nigga holdin now
Grippin the tire, she ready to blow me now
Diggin up in that belly, got her moanin now
And round and round I go
When I cum, up and down she go
When she cum, everybody know
When we come, money's on the floor baby

(Hook)
That girl, she got me
Way she movin in place
Bendin over, spreadin eagle
All that ass in my face
She got me hard as hell
Got me pokin like a nail
She got me hard as hell
I can't control it
Can't you tell, baby

That girl, she got me
Way she movin in place
Bendin over, spreadin eagle
All that ass in my face
She got me hard as hell
Got me pokin like a nail
She got me hard as hell
I can't control it
Can't you tell, baby (Baby, baby, baby)
