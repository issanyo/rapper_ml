Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors

[Chorus: Young Dro]
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)

Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, I'm clean in this bitch

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I could give a fuck about you niggas and you hating hoes
Super black Escalade, got some suicide doors
Inside: peanut butter, Peter Pan brown
I'm a country ass nigga with some doobs on the ground
Shoot a motherfucker hollow when he skating, beating down the street
Sipping on some purple while your baby momma sucking me
Got 'em jumping out my seat and ladies skeet if ya fuck with me
I don't have to throw a pitchfork to show you I'm a fucking G
A to the N to the G-S, T-AR
Some country ass niggas from the cities who are
The men that got some dro, man, you can bring the cigar
You can hit the bird then buy off the bazaar

[Chorus: Young Dro]
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, I'm clean in this bitch
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, I'm clean in this bitch

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Suicide doors and a blonde-haired genie
It's not a damn chop, it's a real Lamborghini
Twenty-five shows on the circuit in the south (south)
Ain't got no bodyguards (guards), I just need mighty God (God)
These niggas mighty fraud (fraud), I see it in they stance
He a ho and he know it, got that pussy in his pants
Nigga, I got your advance on my pinky ring, bitch! (bitch)
Pimp C, bitch! (bitch), get angry, bitch! (bitch)
With a whole ki, bitch! (bitch), with me, 1-3, bitch! (bitch)
My uzi weigh a ton, I bought a necklace for my dick (for my dick)
And my nuts got a MySpace page (page)
Hoes hit my balls twenty-five fives in a day
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, (hold up), hold up, bitch

[Chorus: Young Dro]
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, I'm clean in this bitch
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, I'm clean in this bitch

[Bridge: Kandi]
Gotta love them niggas who know how to roll
In them old school cars with the suicide doors
Every bitch want him cause he's riding so cold
But I'm chilling on his side and we stuntin' on them hoes

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Well, I'm known to be a baller (baller), but not on the court
And I'm a rapper (rapper), a working seran for the export
Yeah, I'm a player (player), but I don't play the game, so keep 'em
Off of the bully after four and they can miss the street sweeper
Bun Beeda (Beeda), Big Bun Beeda, show me respect, mane
Perpin' with the pistol (pistol), then test it with the Tek, mane
When you see the pledge, it ain't the diamonds that reflect, mane
So have it on your mind (before) I blow it off your neck, mane

[Chorus: Young Dro]
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, I'm clean in this bitch
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown)
Suicide doors, I'm clean in this bitch

[Outro: David Banner, Young Dro, & Pimp C]
And, uh, tell your bitch I'm the shit
Dave Banner, motherfucker I'm clean in this bitch
You could keep the white, nigga, I just want the yolk
Long as it's the south, I ain't gon' never go broke, I said
You could keep the white, nigga, I just want the yolk
Long as it's the south, I ain't gon' never go broke
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, (hold up), hold up, bitch
