[Intro: LA The Darkman]
Yeah, homie, do you know what a pimp is?
A pimp has the power of manipulating people
This me, L-A-D

[Chorus: Jovan Dais]
Hoes wanna date us, niggas can't fade us
We stylin' on them haters, in the my crib [?] Gators
These streets are greasy, slimy and sleazy
We gotta do it but pimpin' ain't easy
Hoes wanna date us, niggas can't fade us
We stylin' on them haters, in the my crib [?] Gators
These streets are greasy, slimy and sleazy
We gotta do it but pimpin' ain't easy

[Verse 1: LA The Darkman]
I rock my Gucci bucket like fuck it with a musket
Got an R&B broad wit' me like LeToya Luckett
Suck it, she know the routine
In the back of the Phantom, in tandem, ridin' clean
Four carat pinky ring, better recognize a don
I quarterback the bricks wit' a Tom Brady arm
Coach like Belichick even though I write the check
From niggas worldwide, got undivided respect
Different flavors of Marvin Gators, hoes congratulate us
Have 'em dancin' in a mansion, keep a pistol for you haters
Takin' a escalator up the road to success
When it come to traffickin' coke, nigga, I'm the best
Way down in Texas they now the name LA
I always got work, nigga, even when it's dry
Take a eye for a eye, bitch that's no lie
You ever cross me wrong, somebody gon' die

[Chorus: Jovan Dais]
Hoes wanna date us, niggas can't fade us
We stylin' on them haters, in the my crib [?] Gators
These streets are greasy, slimy and sleazy
We gotta do it but pimpin' ain't easy
Hoes wanna date us, niggas can't fade us
We stylin' on them haters, in the my crib [?] Gators
These streets are greasy, slimy and sleazy
We gotta do it but pimpin' ain't easy

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Bubba kush in it with the windows tinted
And that's how we represent it
No lease, no borrowing
You see me in it today, you see it tomorrow
I got no sorrow for haters, no sympathy for the fraud
Buck niggas want redemption, they get it from the Lord
If Jesus loves and God forgives
But a trill ass nigga's comin' back for his
I can't say it no plainer or write it more clear
You might be on another level. bitch, but you ain't here
It take more than the chains, more than cars and clothes
How you a millionaire with five dollar hoes?
Keep it trill, pimpin, you know how it goes

[Chorus: Jovan Dais]
Hoes wanna date us, niggas can't fade us
We stylin' on them haters, in the my crib [?] Gators
These streets are greasy, slimy and sleazy
We gotta do it but pimpin' ain't easy
Hoes wanna date us, niggas can't fade us
We stylin' on them haters, in the my crib [?] Gators
These streets are greasy, slimy and sleazy
We gotta do it but pimpin' ain't easy

[Verse 3: Styles P]
The snakeskin down to the floor but they Air Ones
Diamonds in the handle of the hammer, that's a rare gun
Hunnid worth a weed, that's a blunt in each ear, son
I don't floss much
I be in the cut, bossed up, hittin' the dutch, whippin' the sauce up
And when I ate bird, I bought duck, fifteen hunnid a plate
I been straight, little nigga, you caught up?
Snakeskin fitted too, I ain't got to rap
I could bag up a brick off the shake on the digital
Styles P, Bun B leave you in critical
Don Juan talked with his preacher but it ain't Biblical
Yeah and the Drama is all visual
You ain't affiliated with the affiliates
You just cut out the silly shit, nigga, you just miserable
Bitch ass trick get a million, it be a miracle
Bitch ass trick get a million, it be a miracle

[Chorus: Jovan Dais]
Hoes wanna date us, niggas can't fade us
We stylin' on them haters, in the my crib [?] Gators
These streets are greasy, slimy and sleazy
We gotta do it but pimpin' ain't easy
Hoes wanna date us, niggas can't fade us
We stylin' on them haters, in the my crib [?] Gators
These streets are greasy, slimy and sleazy
We gotta do it but pimpin' ain't easy
