Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OG's
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street’s lottery
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OG's
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street’s lottery

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I’m the street’s dictionary
January to January
I’m after money, cocaine runner
I got odd numbers, 340 for a pound, Black Migo numbers
I know the route out in the street if he want some money
I always keep it real, never snitch or fronted you
When I was nine years old I didn’t have a lot of money
That inspired me to get money
Now I’m riding in the Porsche thinking
I'm thinking Ben Franklins
When I was young, my momma had a package
I was born in Saran Wrap

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Back in the days when I started the game
It was all about the loyalty, the cast that feel the same
It was all about getting down together for the change
It was all about the fame and fuck whoever came
We was young, but down for each other in the trap
Fighting in the streets way before we had the straps
Fucking on these hoes way before we had the money
So when niggas gotta paid, we ain't start acting funny
We understood the rules and the cause of the G's
Never beefing over pussy, just money or the cheese
To go from BGs to OGs, that’s how it’s gotta be
And thats how young trill niggas hit the street’s lottery
For real, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
Growing up as a young nigga, everybody wanna be a boss
I done built my own lane, I could show an OG how to ball
I know everything about the streets, never did time behind the wall
I know some young niggas gone, boy they ain't never coming home behind the walls
Who had the money for a lawyer, public defenders they destroy ya
Cases beat with a lawyer, you a young nigga, so they try to spoil ya
