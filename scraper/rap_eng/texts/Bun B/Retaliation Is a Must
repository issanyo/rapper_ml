[Intro: Mddl Fngz]
Hold up, middle fingers up
Pussy-ass niggas down nigga (muh'fuckers)
H-Town, Texas stand up, Southwest (uh-huh)
Sunny side, P.A. we up in here
Bun, holla at these motherfuckers (you know'm talkin 'bout?)

[Bun B]
Say, nigga you can't run, nigga you can't hide
Know that we got guns, know that we gon' ride
Blow out your insides, and leave ya to rot
Cause when we give it to ya bitch we give you all that we got
Now all it take is one shot to put yo' ass in a ditch
But you gon' get the other forty-nine for bein a bitch
Go to war with the big man when it makes no sense to
Repercussions get extreme when we ride against you
Ain't no movin ya baby mama {?} or your kids
Everybody finna get it for the shit that you did
So when I get to ya crib, better come out swingin
Cause the devil ain't even ready for this hell I'm bringin
We don't want no dope, we don't want no cash
We don't want no excuses, we just want yo' ass
So when that front do' crash, and you see them soldiers
When that gun go flash, don't say that Bun ain't told ya, nigga

[Hook 2X: Bun B]
If I pull it I'mma pop and be the first one to bust
We ain't playin wit'chu hoes (retaliation is a must)
First nigga make a move, first nigga hit the dust
We ain't playin wit'chu hoes (retaliation is a must)

[Mddl Fngz - #1]
Yeah, now I stand on my two feet, one clip, two heats
20-shot hollow heads, bitch give me the loose leaf
Fuck beef, I got a K for niggas
In spots the laws won't find ya for days, my nigga
Southside, young playa full of plots and scams
Show ya how to get ya ovals up and lock the grams
Boys know me in the hood, but not from rappin
Back street trappin, front line, ya boy is a captain
First nigga to shoot, I ain't tryin to talk
Bring the heat to the hospital and finish you off
No life is a tunnel, while I'm rollin with my gun up
Don't get ya bitch gun butt, nigga what'chu want what
It ain't shit to get yo' family touched
Catch a T on the bus and pop a ass like a clutch, nigga
I'm in the game cause I love the rush
Love the bucks, this fans money never enough, nigga

[Hook]

[Mddl Fngz - #2]
Uh, hol' up, uhh
Forty-five in the Rover, the K is on my shoulder
Pop yo' bitch-ass, then I go and smoke it over
Niggas gettin older, but thugs is comin younger
So just in case you wonder I keep a F in the thunder
Nigga you's a blunder, got rocked by the thunder
Cryin to that Bun, but he the reason that we done ya
Gave us the word, said we keep the birds
Beefin is for nerds, I put ya brains on the curb

[Mddl Fngz - #3]
Fucka! Pull ya piece nigga, and watch you rest in it
Come to this clip game, bitch I'm the best in it
Your white flag ya wavin, now it's on, bitch please
All your loved ones houses lookin like swiss cheese
Tried to let ya ass make it, but ya ass act a fool
Now the H.K., the A.K., and the A-R is the tools
All ya homeboys gone and them hoes want less
So tell ya mom and ya sister break out the black dress

[Hook]
