(Intro)
Dippin' and swervin' in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin'

(Hook)
Dippin' and swervin' in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin'
Dippin' and swervin' in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin'

(Verse)
I’m dippin through the city, fresh Jordans on my toe
Candy coupe DeVille, ridin Cadillac bro
I’m all up in yo hood, nigga checkin on my dough
Catch me with yo baby momma, checkin on yo ho
A pocket full of bread and I don’t mean pita
Leanin on this ditch bitch, hand on the heater
Your gal on my meter, she begging me to beat er
But I really don’t want it, damn sure don’t need er
She a fly mamasita with a big round bottom
They come a dime a dozen and I damn sure got em
Somebody should’ve told er that I’m all about the pay so
Get up off yo knees, I need the cheese, get the ya sold

(Hook x2)
Dippin' and swervin' in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin'
Dippin' and swervin' in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin'

(Verse)
I’m dippin through the city, fresh fitted on my dome
Comin' down candy and I’m sittin on chrome
Eighty-Fo's crunkin' and they sqeaky like chrome
Make you bitch mouthwater and a nigga straight moan
Port Aurthur is the home, mane and Texas is the grill
The south is what I rep so you can get it how you live
A glass house dropper so they know just who it is
With diamonds on the wood cuz I’m handling my biz
I’m jumpin up the hood so they know just how I feel
It’s UGK for life but if I’m ridin for the trill
Real just blindin, we do it big time
And I’m grippin on the grip and I slap that shinin

(Hook x2)
Dippin and swerving in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin
Dippin and swerving in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin

(Verse)
I’m dippin through the city, fresh chain upon my neck
The hood niggas see me and I’m getting my respect
They understand that I ain’t playin with a fork yet
If you get up out of line then I’mma put yo ass in check
I’m certified partner, better know it when you see
They gonna recognize it when you're fuckin with a G
They put me in the cross, I’m sending flowers to your team
I’m finna cut some branches down up off your family tree
I’m underground king, that’s forever and a day
And I’mma lay a hater down that up in my way
If you can ask him then you can explain
Don’t fuck with that trill ass nigga from PA

(Hook x2)
Dippin and swerving in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin
Dippin and swerving in my suburban
Pockets stay swollen, money I be holdin
