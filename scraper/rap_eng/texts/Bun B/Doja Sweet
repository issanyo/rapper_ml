[Chorus: Pimp C Samples]
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
Chokin' on that doja sweet, chokin' on that doja sweet
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
Sippin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
The 84, the 84, the 84 Brougham on them, sippin' on that sizzurp

[Verse 1: Killa Kyleon]
Syrup City, my swang is pokin', two cups of that Big Moe
H-Town, Robert Davis, that's the reason I like to smoke
Pimp C, Big Hawk, mellow steep my fallen soldiers
Butterscotch my spinal cord, pop the trunk, still fallin' over
3rd Ward, 5th Ward, (?), South Park
Acres on (?) Mo City, (?)
Astro like Nolan Ryan, candy cars when I roll around
Rap-A-Lot, Swisher House, SUC, they hold me down
Greenspoint, Pleasantville, Sugar Land, (?)
UGK, Ghetto Boyz, I keep it trill and I stay street
20 ounce so I dunk a deuce and I chuck the deuce when I'm slidin' by
Smokin' kush, and ridin' 4s, so you can just say that I'm ridin' high
Ridin' fly on my pilot shit, first class, continental
Double cup full of sleepin' potion, sweet full of LA confidential
You call 'em hoes, but we call 'em bops, she shotgun when I crawl the lot
In that candy 'vert we call it drop, let me hit my cup then let it hit the spot, cause I'm...

[Chorus: Pimp C Samples]
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
Chokin' on that doja sweet, chokin' on that doja sweet
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
The 84, the 84, the 84 Brougham on them, sippin' on that sizzurp

[Bridge: Sample & Pimp C Samples]
There's nothing like the joy you bring (Chokin' on that doja)
I wonder what would happen (Chokin' on that doja)
If you would trust in me (Chokin' on that doja)
I'd make you believe
I'd make you belie-

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Sippin' that, sippin' that sizzup, that sizzup, yeah, purple is the color
Gettin' higher than 'em clouds, I be that pretty motherfucka
Killa, Killa that's my brother, wait, hol' up, did I stutter?
I'm young, I'm gettin' money, yeah I'm on my gutta gutta
Roll a blunt up with another, put it in rotation
Tell her I been gettin' high, I'm feelin' stingy, finna face it
You lower than a basement, I'm higher than the clouds
Pour it up, pour it up, A$AP, H-Town
Roll up another one, smokin' up another one, this is how I chill
Candy paint drippin', chrome wings up on that grill
I swear I do it for real, I swear my niggas trill
And we, we, we, we poppin', we poppin' pills
I be on that molly and bitches on that xanny
I told her I give her purple drank to get in her panties
I be fuckin' these girls and I could fuck her mom and granny
I'm a nasty motherfucka, fuck the whole family

[Chorus: Pimp C Samples]
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
Chokin' on that doja sweet, chokin' on that doja sweet
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
Sippin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
The 84, the 84, the 84 Brougham on them, sippin' on that sizzurp

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Man I'm in the Cadillac, posted, sweets lit and I'm roasted
Sippin' brown and I'm toasted, UGK for life and I boast it
We ain't tolerate no hoe shit, you hoes need to get ghost, shit
Got Killa K and young flacko mase, you know we 'bout to get throwed
Bitch, my car top is that rag (rag), Levi's on, no sag (sag)
Hooded up for young Trayvon Martin, yeah man that's just my swag (swag)
I'm blowin' dro, no hag (hag), racks and racks in my bag (bag)
The biggest dog in this yard so these bitches tail's gonna wag
Man, I'm draped up, you know my pockets pap'd up
[?]
You know all night we stay up, sleep all day and wake up, count cake up
Shake that Harlem shake up, this trill [?]
I represent for PA, the original land of that trill (trill), you ain't down with that
Then come where I'ma at and I'ma put these hands on your grill
Don't give a fuck how you feel (feel), we just grippin' that wheel (wheel)
Wood grain on my hood mane, it's all good mane, just chill

[Chorus: Pimp C Samples]
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
Chokin' on that doja sweet, chokin' on that doja sweet
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
Chokin' on that doja sweet, sippin' on that sizzurp
The 84, the 84, the 84 Brougham on them, sippin' on that sizzurp

[Outro: Sample]
There's nothing like the joy you bring
I wounder what would happen
If you would trust in me
I'd make you believe
I'd make you belie-
