[Chorus:  Bun B]
I used to live up in the projects, in a duplex
Even a shotgun shack and man I'm never goin' back
I used to be out on the block late night
Dark alleys with a pocket full of crack and man I'm never goin' back
I had friends turned to foes, hid behind closed doors
Plottin' on me for my stacks and man I'm never goin' back
'Cause I've never been as blessed as I am right now
And that's a mothafuckin' fact, so I'm never goin' back

[Verse 1:  Bun B]
I lived more in one life than your whole family tree (tree)
Now I'm ready to be the man that life demands me to be (be)
I'm down to take the wheel and drive so go on and hand me the key
And when it's done everyone gon' really understand he's a G (G)
I'm never bitin' off more than I can chew
And I tolerate you suckas even if I can't stand you
Not only am I a man but I'm the band and a brand too
So I understand the kind of shit these haters can hand you
I seen a lot of pain and struggle (struggle), hardships in my days (days)
And the devil comin' at me all kind of fuckin' ways (ways)
There was plays when the lick went bad, we had to draw down
No honor amongst thieves, they hate and bring the law down
Cutthroat savages, kill you and make sandwiches
Promise this world got more drama than you can manage
Shit, somehow I fought my way up out of the zoo
Then turned around and said "mother fuck you"
'Cause man I'm never goin' back

[Chorus:  Bun B]
I used to live up in the projects, in a duplex
Even a shotgun shack and man I'm never goin' back
I used to be out on the block late night
Dark alleys with a pocket full of crack and man I'm never goin' back
I had friends  turned to foes, hid behind closed doors
Plottin' on me for my stacks and man I'm never goin' back
'Cause I've never been as blessed as I am right now
And that's a mothafuckin' fact, so I'm never goin' back

[Verse 2:  Giggs]
Stack proper, stat popper
I just landed, in the black choppa
And the chat stopper, pop-pop, strapped proper
In that black cabinet is the fat copper
Give a little, take and then what you got
Pockets gettin' raped, niggas gettin' shot
Think 'cause we got cake, niggas gettin' soft (soft)
Any disrespect, niggas gettin' boxed
If they bring that [?] niggas gettin' scoffed
Pull up like police, niggas gettin' stopped
Drag him out the car, niggas gettin' chopped (chopped)
Punch him in the mouth, niggas gettin' socked
Even when you're tryin' niggas never listen
Always kinda dissin', but you're never decent
And we just moving different, so you're gettin' distant (distant)
I'm just too persistent, but just got resisted
Grab my little daughter and my son and kissed 'em (yeah)
Not a day goes by when I ain't tryin' to lift 'em
Think a nigga stupid, man I clocked the system
Bun just hit me up and then he got assistance

[Chorus:  Bun B]
I used to live up in the projects, in a duplex
Even a shotgun shack and man I'm never goin' back
I used to be out on the block late night
Dark alleys with a pocket full of crack and man I'm never goin' back
I had friends turned to foes, hid behind closed doors
Plottin' on me for my stacks and man I'm never goin' back
'Cause I've never been as blessed as I am right now
And that's a mothafuckin' fact, so I'm never goin' back
