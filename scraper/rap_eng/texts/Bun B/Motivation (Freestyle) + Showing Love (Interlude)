[Intro: DJ Ideal]
The bottom bitch!

[Hook 1: Pitbull]
Running your mouth
Til they run into your house
Home Invasion!
Haters keep running your mouth
Til they run into your house
Home Invasion!
Haters keep running your mouth
Til they run into your house
Home Invasion!
Haters keep running your mouth
Til they run into your house
Watch out!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm a Dade county representer, low key, no gold teeth
No spinners, go getta, gorilla, turn killa
Fo scrilla, fo real-a, and I see no nigga
Bet that, get it back, I'm going hard for these stacks
I'm running through these blocks like a runningback
Run it back, while collar, blue collar
Crime dawg I'm done with that
I wish Uncle Al, B.I.G, and Pac bring us back
Cook coke chopped crack ain't longer stop that
Rep your shit, lemme see exactly where you blocks at
Where the mat, where them choppers
Dawg where them Glocks at?
You name it, you need it, you want it, we got that
If the money's right, then that white, you can pop that
Witnessing the birth, go ahead draw the tie back
It's official Miami the bottom has been brought back
By yours truly, I spit it for these spics and hoodlums
The game is mine, now give it to me, home invasion

[Hook 2: Pitbull]
Haters keeping running your mouth
Til they run into your house
Home Invasion!
Black gloves, black mats, black gats
Duct tape, fuckboy, pass weight
Home Invasion!
Haters keeping running your mouth
Til they run into your house
Home Invasion!
Black gloves, black mats, black gats
Duct tape, fuckboy, pass weight
Home Invasion!

[Interlude: Bun B]
