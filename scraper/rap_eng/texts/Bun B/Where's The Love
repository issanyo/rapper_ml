[Hook: Masspike Miles]
Sweet dreams of a young girl, looking for a way to crack the code
Young hopes of a hustler, trying to heat the game so cold
In these streets, either they love you or they don’t
These mean streets, either they love you or they don’t

[Verse 1: Termanology]
My dreams are a million plus and that’s the minimum
Both my seeds chillin’ living in the condominium
Brought it from overseas, putting right back in the ghetto
Where people act sentimental if you ain’t tryna do shit for them
I remember when I got my first deal
They hated on me, they tried to kill me forreal
They shot up my crib with steel
My partners some of them squealed when I see them I get the chills
I can never forgive them still
I’m still hustling skills instead of pills, beats instead of p’s
CD’s instead of keys
It’s no love in these streets and that’s a fact
I don’t trust a fucking soul man I got my own back

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Now tryna make a dolla ain’t as easy as it used to be
Grinding it out while making sure nobodies using me
Now usually I get straight to the bread
But nowadays you gotta make sure you using your head
The OG said, “You gotta keep your eyes open”
Always watch ya back cuz these boys be scoping
Hoping that they could get you with your pants down
That’s no homo put your hands up slow-mo homie and stand down
Now that’s an everyday scene in the nation
Cats is thirsty and they need their hydration
You don’t work then you don’t eat
You don’t pay attention and you get merked in the street, shit ain’t sweet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bodega Bamz]
In the jungle where them murders happen
Ski mask, backpack & the magnum, take a pic no caption
I'ma cruise no captain
I’ma take no askin’
I’ma make this happen bottle up and get this crackin’, facts of life pa
They tried to take and charge me double just to get it back
Stupid, pay attention, once you leave they no make it back
They just hate the fact, I’ma amazin’ and I play with rap
Deadbeat dad, maybe so but I could raise a stack
Raise the gat, bullets flying everywhere, graze ya cap
Bodies hit the floor, either dodge it or it or you take a nap
Player’s club, turkey dinner table everybody bosses, label meeting
Throwing out numbers like a fucking auction
