Goddamn
A lot of people said this shit wasn't gonna happen
They ain't had the nuts to say it to our face but
I could see it in niggas eyes, I could hear it in niggas voices
A lot of niggas counting UGK out of the game
They got me fucked up
And they got my brother Pimp fucked up
This UGK shit is for life
We represent it to the fullest
We the Underground Kingz
We represent for the hood mayne, for the corner, for the street, for the block
All parts of that shit, the good and the bad
You know what I'm saying?
It's a lot of niggas that helped us get here
It ain't enough time on the album to name all them niggas
But you niggas know who you are, and uh
I appreciate all my East Coast homies
My Mid-West homies
My West Coast homies
My Dirty South homies
That held me and Pimp down, and prayed for us to come back
And shit, if it weren't for our family and friends
Nigga wouldn't be talking on this record right now
That shit go without saying
You know a lot of cats be out there, scared to give it up
We gotta keep it one hundred, God first
Couldn't have done none of these songs
Wrote none of these rhymes
Put none of these track toghether
Without the man above
All respect is due
And last but not least
I wanna thank you
For taking the time and listening to this album
It was a whole lot of songs
You spent your money
You've been waiting
And I hope you're satisfied
It's a lot more of this trill shit to come
So keep your eyes and ears open
And after that being said
On behalf of myself, Pimp C, and all the trill niggas worldwide
We are the Underground Kignz, in case you ain't know
I see you on the slab baby
Chunk a deuce
Holla at ya boy
We out
