[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Clear the runway baby
I get money from Sunday to Sunday lady
Ohh behave I'm young, rich famous
Grinding, keep my pockets on Schwarzenegger
O.G in my Swisher so my blunt taste flavored, don't it?
Ya'll niggas can get if you want it
Tryna catch a flight?
I'm in the back seat playing X Box, car service just chillin'

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Now this could be one of those days
I chop on my blades, leave my worries behind
Just pretend that I’m paid
Do it big, do it large, on the boulevard
Get a sense of success, pushin' candy cars
I did some thangs for that Chevy mayne
Restored the frame, blew the brains, out on everything
I ain’t ashamed, scooped my dame cause she down to roll
Since way before, don’t touch my screens or my radio
She know the score

[Hook:]
I'm rollin up another one
Starring out this window, window, window, windowwww
They tellin me to change how I'm livin', but its all I know
I'm seen in every city on my way out to another one, another one, another one, another ooonne
You find me anywhere that paper go, go, oh, oh, ohhhhh

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Now this could be one of those days
Parlay and I ball, turning necks til they break, outside of the mall
Going in going hard like a superstar
Break the bank full tank take me super far
I swang and bang, sittin' heavy mayne
Hoggin' lanes candy paint never leave a stain
Let it rain, hydroplane, but I'm ridin' slow
Eyes closed, Etta James keep me on my toes
Can’t let her go

[Hook:]

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Well it's big Bun B now, baby, Mr. Woodgrain
With diamonds up against them balling through your hood mayn
And I'm smoking on some good mayn, the color purple
Not the movie, but the kind that have you going in a circle
Chrome, looking more classy than the Transco Tower
Car drippin' candy paint like it just came out the shower
Like 'Face I got the money, the power and the finesse
To roll around one deep with hundred-thousand round my neck
I'm looking real shiny; you can see me from a mile away
Thought you was doing it, until I came and took your smile away
Pull up on your side in the turning lane
Pop my trunk, break you off, chunk a deuce
And I'm Cadillac turning mayn (i'm gone)
Little swang to the left, big swang to the right
My plates scraping and I'm sliding the pipe, it's super tight
So don't try to knock us baby, don't try to hate
That's how we do it in that Lone star state; get it straight
We be

[Hook:]
