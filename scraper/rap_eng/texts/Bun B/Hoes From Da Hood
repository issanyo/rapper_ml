[Intro]
Man Beatking

[Chorus: Bun B]
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Got some hoes from the hood And they straight up out the ghetto
They don't listen to no punk, rock, pop, or heavy metal
All they listen to is Boosie, smokin' on a loosie
Their attitude is bad but their coochie real juicy
Got some hoes from the hood And they straight up out the trap
If you comin' at 'em wrong guaranteed they finna snap
They make their ass clap when they drop it to the floor
And they gon' bust it open (when?), soon as they hit the door
Got some hoes from the hood Man and they don't plan on leavin'
Long as they can get their nails done and their hair weavin'
Shit, they gon' keep it G, rep the city like they should
Don't get out of line, they wish a mothafucka would

[Chorus: Bun B]
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Got some hoes from the hood And they all about the money
'Cause they gotta pay them bills, ain't a damn thing funny
Their kids need some school clothes and brand new shoes
So they gon' bounce that ass and try to make a nigga choose
Got some hoes from the hood And they all about the bread
So you gon' have to pay to get some pussy or some head
'Cause they don't fuck for free, unless it's their baby daddy
So you better drop them coins before she hops off in your Caddy
Got some hoes from the hood And they all about finnessin'
Take your money and your jewelry before you done undressin'
So you gon' learn a lesson and it's for your own good
They gon' catch you slippin' nigga, just like they should

[Chorus: Bun B]
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side

[Verse 3: Zed Zilla & Bun B]
Yo, hol' up
Got some hoes from the hood Who be twerkin' at that Onyx
For those twenties, fifties, hundreds, tattoos on her stomach
She don't want the conversation, she's just tryin' to get paid
If you lame she gonna tell you to hit up [?]
Got some hoes from the hood Who gone off them pills
Gettin' skinny than a bitch, ratchet ho, you need to chill
Dude livin' in your house, he ain't even payin' bills
But that ain't none of my business, I want some top, what's the deal?
Got some hoes from the hood Who be all about their cheese (hold up)
Just started strippin', got those bruises on her knees (ha)
Throw that, hrow that ass back, make a nigga run
If you ain't finna fuck Zilla then you ain't finna fuck Bun

[Chorus: Bun B]
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
Got some hoes from the hood, that live to keep it live
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
From the back (back), to the front (front) and to the side
Got some hoes from the hood, from the hood, from the hood
