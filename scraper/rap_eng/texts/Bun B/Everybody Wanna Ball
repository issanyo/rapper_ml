[Chorus: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I'm still smokin' out, pourin' up
Puttin' dick up in yo' slut
Niggas look, I'm sayin' "what?"
Hustlin' not in a rut
Gettin' down, on the grind
Puttin' meat up in they spine
Young girl lookin' fine
Comin' back with the whole nine
Grip the 'lac
Do the track
Young Goldie off the "Mack"
Hit the sack
Drop 7 grams
Watch it bubble back
All heart, never fraud
Only trust in the lord
Never in no (?)
Represent the whole South
Everybody wanna be the boy gettin' rich
Everybody wanna have a bad-ass bitch
Everybody want a 'Lac
Wanna blow the doja sack
Everybody wanna come through with their foot packed

[Pre-Chorus: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I'm the king
Pulling the strings
The man behind the man
The Trillest, swag too it
With Bible in my hand
Representin' for the G's
And the real Trill fellas
In the hoods, the barrios
Even the favelas
Try to tell us we couldn't do it
Don't even try
They almost had me believin' that shit
I won't even lie
I had to look them in the eye
To see the hate in their hearts
See everybody can't love you
They're just playing their part
I was taught to play my position
And wait for my shot
And win the game, blow the spot
Fuck who like it or not
You can't please everybody
You might as well please you
And keep it 100 with yourself
Just like the G's do

[Pre-Chorus: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna have a platinum ass dick
All gold aged pussy
Don't you want to break a trick
Don Magic Juan told me to stay true
It's all about the green
Not the red or the blue
The lean, flat screen
And the disc say "Screw"
Leanin' on the switch
Pressin' on your bitch
You don't but no gun on your brother head
Nigga don't put your rubber on
Like you squeezin' the trigger
On yo' swight
Time right
In the dark or the light
BBS prime cuts
92 karats I'm right
In the prone said meet change (?)
Grippin' on the wood grain
Young hoes suckin' on my dick like it's a chicken wing

[Pre-Chorus: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all
