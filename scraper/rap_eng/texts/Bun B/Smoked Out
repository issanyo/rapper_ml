[Hook: David Banner & woman]
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
She-she-she only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
She say, she say, she say, she say, she say, she say, she say
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
She-she-she only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)

[Verse 1: David Banner]
She don’t like me on the radio, ride up on me in the hood
Only call once or twice, I fall through and fuck her good
Only like a foot high, Cali cush, I bring it by
Got the best pussy in the world, nigga I can’t lie
Love it when I fuck her friends, never ask me for no ends
Bring ‘er on, money for the weed like I pay in tens
Twenty’s on a good J, smoke her whole life away
If you pop 'shnell, sip some limo-never ever fuck with ya
But never ever fuck with they

[Hook]

Smoke, uh
Roll it, bite it, smokin’..

[Verse 2: David Banner]
Fuckin’ on the floor, on the couch, on the porch, in your mouth
I’m in your body so deep that you scream to pull it out
Let me take you to a crazy that you never ever been
Put your legs on my shoulder and some kush in the wind
I ain’t tryna be a friend, I’m just juggin’ down here
We can visit now and then but for now I’m ‘bout the bin
But for now I’m ‘bout the bin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Raheem DeVaughn]
She so ghetto girl just be fine
She rolls her J and then she roll mine
Place call up, never bump and grind
She go her way and I go mine
She call me when she feelin’ real freaky
To be a midnight house call lover
Like in the back woods, real good kush
And it’s all about the Magnum rubbers
She like them shotgun kisses that taste like marijuana
Fuck her you gon' blow her back out
The room’s smokin’ like a sauna
Already go but I ain’t cumin’ yet
We Wiz Khalifa high, Mississippi soakin’ wet

[Hook: David Banner, Raheem DeVaughn & woman]
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
She say, she say, she say, she say, she say, she say, she say
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
She-she-she only wanna fuck when she’s
She say, she say, she say, she say, she say, she say, she say
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
She only wanna fuck when she’s smoked out
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Man I’ll be rollin’ through my city in a drop top something
Here to suck her that, mouth back and cigarillos to puffin’ boys
Sayin’ that they blowin’ on their kilo but they bluffin’
I stay treat up like a pop quart, they a dope player is nothin’
Why you stressin’ with them C’s? I got extends all in your weed
I got that hard drop Bonnie Connie, they here, that’s all you need
And this is strictly for the G's so I keep fightin’ with the durk
Get your pop on like the sweets, why she liftin’ up her skirt?

(I only wanna fuck, I only wanna smoke)
