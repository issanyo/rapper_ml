[Hook: Big KRIT]
Old school car parked outside
Too many hoes to fit in my ride
Old school car parked outside
Too many hoes to fit in my ride
And they be
Old school car parked outside
Too many hoes to fit in my ride
And they be
Old school car parked outside
Too many hoes to fit in my ride

[Verse 1: Jackie Chain]
I'm an Alabama pimp, ain't no secret in that
Certified slab body custom sits in the back
Got a 73 Impala, yeah we call it a donk
… push the phantom to the pedal, put that … in the winds
Hit the … I’ma go to the benz
Had to move out my city cause my city was hot
The police all upon my block undercover’s watching my spot
Now I’m back in the 8 with the money and the power
Blowing car pipping … trump tower
… I put the roof I take my trunk and blow some smoke in the sky
I got that

[Verse2: Bun B]
Ok, I got a big body slab in the parking lot
Blessing you
Riding shotgun
A yellow big body passenger
I’m colder than Alaska bro
And she fresher than Massengill
We shutting down the avenue
Player, partner, that’s for real, sitting on a hill
Waiting to score a mountain
Can’t keep up with the total cause we weighing what we counting
Turn a couple pounds into a couple pounds of bread
But keep that to yourself, cause we ain’t fucking around with feds
… poppers is jocking and sending them right to the room
Here we … them we give them Mexican soon
I pop my trunk and go boom
Drop my top and go blaw
I’m ripping grain with Jackie Chain
So ain’t no stopping me now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jackie Chain]
I got 2 … ho and not enough room
Me and 7 bitches in the Cadillac roam
Swerving like a motherfucker smoking on blunt
Five hoes up in the back and 2 more in the front
On my way to the after party meet the block
Knocking pictures of your wall every time we drop
Got a … master pass it around
Bless the … at the … ground
… I’m pouring out a Coors Light for my dogs every night
Got the… that’s how we do it in Bama
I got that

[Hook]
