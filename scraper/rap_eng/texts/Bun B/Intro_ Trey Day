[Intro]
Trey Day, Trey Day, Trey Day, Trey Day
Trey Day, Trey Day, Trey Day Trey Day, Trey Day

[Verse: Bun B]
Yeah, Bun B baby, UGK, baby, hold up
See you done had your moment, you done had your turn
Now move around clown for the sound that got the streets on burn
The trillest player out the V.A. since the authors of Lord Willin'
Givin' R&B music a newly restored feelin'
While haters is bored chillin', he's focused and mashin'
He bringin' big faces and then them checks he be cashin'
He got some places to go and some people to see
But he gon' rep for Virginia, baby keepin' it G
In the streets and TV, don't matter, he gon' keep it 100
'Cause can't nobody do it like young Trey done done it
So don't tell me that it's dos or claimin' it's uno
Why hate 'em, congratulate him, 'cause nigga, you know

[Outro]
