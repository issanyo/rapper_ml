[Hook: Idreese]
You know I stay fresh
You can me on my movie set
You know I stay fresh
You can me on my movie set
I got that OUD, got that drop-top ride
Stay posted up like minarets outside
Girl I'm so fly
You can catch me in my ride
Catch me in my ride on the movie set
Girl I'm so fly
You can catch me in my ride
(Yeah.)

[Verse One: Idreese]
On a space shuttle, made a crash land: eject
She pulling down my faded glory
Texas made with an OC story
This the Lone Star constellation, and I got my sights on
Looking for candy hips, with a star burst fit
Take her back to Californ', I'm on
I'm with UGK, I live on a bay, Grape: U of H
Titties, ass, hands in the air;
It's a party over here, and she looking great in the sand
I'm burning Kashmiri hashish
While I watch my paper fold, and burned it like Rihanna
But she hotter then petroleum. (Okay)
Waking up on a private beach
With a sun-tan model that's still asleep
Top down my destination: on a permanent vacation
My car look like a street shark, call me Tony Stark, (why?)
Neon under-kit look like Skittles in the dark

[Hook: Idreese]
You know I stay fresh
You can me on my movie set
You know I stay fresh
You can me on my movie set
I got that OUD, got that drop-top ride
Stay posted up like minarets outside
Girl I'm so fly
You can catch me in my ride
Catch me in my ride on the movie set
Girl I'm so fly
You can catch me in my ride
(Yeah)

[Verse Two: Bun B]
I got's my mind on my money, and my money on my mind
I'm focused on my fetti', so I'm staying on my grind
I'm down for whatever, any place, and anytime
Anywhere, with anybody, draw the mother fucker line
If you got the nuts to cross it
Gone let 'em hang
If you down to let 'em off, shit
Gone head and bang
We ain't scared of the pistol play
Go 'head and blast one
Cause that heater that you holding ain't the last one
Them mother fuckers made
Them mother fuckers make 'it
So have it on your head, and go 'head with the faking
We high up on the hog in the bid for the bacon
And if ain't no body giving I'm finna' to start taking cause I'm

[Hook: Idreese]
Fresh
You know I stay fresh
You can me on my movie set
You know I stay fresh
You can me on my movie set
I got that OUD, got that drop-top ride
Stay posted up like minarets outside
Girl I'm so fly
You can catch me in my ride
Catch me in my ride on the movie set
Girl I'm so fly
You can catch me in my ride
