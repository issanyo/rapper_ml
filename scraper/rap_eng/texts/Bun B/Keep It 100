[Intro: Bun B]
K-Salaam, Beatnick, let's do this shit man

[Verse: Bun B]
Yeah, trill OG and I came in here to tell the truth
Reality rap while these other cats sell the booth
They never been nowhere and they ain't ever seen shit
Grew up in the suburbs, homogenized, clean shit
So with no meaning shit when they try to speak on it
No matter how they try to twist it, they look weak homie
So you can fake fake, but you can't fake fact
Yo stick out like a sore thumb with your fake acts
It's not [?] your numbers is funny
No wonder you ain't [?] to the money
Homie I ain't no dummy, homeboy I been around for a little bit
And know the difference from that big and that little shit
You back on the right track fore you get left behind
When I come through in the clutch homie, just in time
Damn, I thought you knew this shit
But it's cool, just sit back, I'm 'bout to do this shit

[Hook: Adi Armour]
All I ask that you keep it 100 with me
We don't need to play these games
I just want you to be straightforward with me
You don't need to act this way
I know the difference and tryna get it
Ain't getting it, no niggas tell me, can I get a witness
Relax, I'm 'bout to show you how to get it
Let me introduce you niggas to some real shit
