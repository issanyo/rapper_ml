[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I'm on some Superfreak shit like Rick James
I could get it when I'm moving lane-to-lane
Bentley car, superstar, candy sweet, gripping grain
I stick like an icicle, sweet like a candy cane
Get down on it at the drop of a dime
I'mma candy nigga, keep it coming all the time
Pimp C, Sweet Jones, JR, Percy Mack
Do you like it from the front or do you like it from the back?
I'mma do some Pop Rocks, girl, and some ice packs
I'm the real, so trill, keep you cumming, I'm a mack
I'm home like Boosie, drop it down like a pro
Give it to 'em like Webbie, make 'em get down on the flo'

[Hook]
Gripping on the wood
Gripping on the wood
Every fucking day a young nigga live good
Got a pocket full of cheese
Yellow on my dick
Every fucking day I'm on some pimped-out shit

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Man, I'm sitting tall, down to ball, on 24s I skate around
See me in these streets, dripping paint, my plate is scraping now
We picking paper up and I'm shutting haters down
Tell em what's the skinny, but I'm still throwing my weight around
Trill: I don't play around, leave that to the children
I'm about to bleed 'em dry and leave em RED like Helen Mirren
I be wood wheel steering, and Vogue tire turnin'
Big money earnin' like I came from Mount Vernon
Got the Swisher Sweet burnin', the Delaron is chillin'
Got my money on my mind and I'm about to make a killin'
When them Vogue tires peeling and the fifth wheel drop
And the trunk door's raising, I recline the ragtop
Everybody just stop like their time's been frozen
'Bout to damn near go blind from the shine of the chosen
It ain't no more supposin'
Already understood, I'm repping PAT, my hood
When I'm gripping on the wood, baby

[Hook]
Gripping on the wood
Gripping on the wood
Every fucking day a young nigga live good
Got a pocket full of cheese
Yellow on my dick
Every fucking day I'm on some pimped-out shit

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T]
It's the Young K, R-I-T, bitch, I don't know you
Never seen a pimp, well lost ho, let me show you
Wood grain when I roll through, candy painted my SLAB
Put some screens in the front, Ike Turner
In my trunk, and a diamond tuck off in the back
It's a fuckmobile, cause they fuck for free
You lame as fuck, so she fuck with me
Don't be surprised when she leaves your side
I'm everything that you oughta be
Y'all niggas lame, y'all niggas flawed
Word to Pimp C, I'mma break em off
Super-tight since '86, Iceberg Slim could've been my pa
Return of 4Eva all day nigga, listen to UGK nigga
You don't know what I'm bout, I respect the South
Fuck up out my face, nigga
Gotta hold my nuts, keep it oh-so trill
Pop my trunk while I work my wheel
While I drop my top and crack my seal
Ask your bitch cause your bitch be on my diiiiick, ho
Got me a song with Bun, I got me one with Piiiiiimp, ho
Country rap tunes til the day I die
Lobster and shrimp, blowing up like a blimp
When I rotate tires, cause I'm

[Hook]
Gripping on the wood
Gripping on the wood
Every fucking day a young nigga live good
Got a pocket full of cheese
Yellow on my dick
Every fucking day I'm on some pimped-out shit
