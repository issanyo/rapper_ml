[Intro: Smoke D]
Dog its real up in here
Niggas will kill you if you fuck up
You know what im saying

Im just thankful the lord blessed me that I can see it a hundred miles away
You know

Hi Life
We living that hi life
Hi Life (Hi Life... mmmmmmmmmm)
We living that hi life... mmmmmmmmmmm

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I'm tired of living fucked up, tired of living bad
Tired of hearing grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm trying to live up to the image
That she would want to see
But I got one foot in the street
And every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G
But niggas depend on me
It ain't safe to hit I-10
So niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine, niggas' whole existence
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20,000, trying to turn it to a hundred
And ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas tend to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch think that she can ease my mind
By sucking my dick
Bitch maybe for a minute but that shit never lasts
It's 1996 niggas is dying from laying on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Eazy-E died
And you be wonderin' why young niggas out there smokin' fry
I wish that I could tell y'all I wore a rubber everytime
But if I told you that, nigga, you know that I be lying
And I've been fucking pussy since the tender age of nine
It's getting to be a full-time job just trying to stay alive
And Crackers tend to smirk, offended by the weed smoke coming off my shirt
But still I put in work and front for my folks
Cause where I come from, nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married, and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe, some say that nigga's selling dope
And you know I ain't lying, that's just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the Devil poke you with his fork
And everybody sitting in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers are false prophets
Fucking hoes and getting paid
I'm looking for the

Hi Life

[Verse 2: Bun B]
You only got one life to live
That's all they give us to do it
You can bullshit your way through it
Or stay true, it can be complicated cause niggas
Be getting shot in the cross
People and names get lost
The feeble and lame get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive
Take your possessions with pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dusk to see dawn
It's treacherous how we was left here to just die
On the streets that we be on
Motherfuckers sleeping on them corners that you pee on
Probably cause society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the fuck made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas selling that yay
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of American pie just ain't obtainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man, I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now c'mon, who gives a damn when you can't afford the turkey or ham
Living off of Raemon Noodles, beef jerky, and Spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab
Cause poverty will push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your ledge
And so instead of being without, I'm hustling
Trying to get through these ungodly days
Thinking of ways to get the fuck outta this maze
A man'll commit a crime cause a fucking crime pays
I'm going through a phase you don't grow out
Until you a reason a mother fucker gots to po' out
His 40 on the curb, disturbed and left with no doubt in his mind
But still sometimes he don't know why
He walking around just hoping
He get one more try to make it
It's bullshit he going through, but yo, he gots to take it
You can't fake it, to get the hi life

[Hook]
Hi Life
We living that hi life
Hi Life (Hi Life... mmmmmmmmmm)
We living that hi life... mmmmmmmmmmm
