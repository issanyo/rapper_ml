[Verse 1]
My misophonia brought the faders up
Now she's a military grade
In Dolby Surround, around 5.1
Cue the barking from the baritone
Conductor in the pit for the car honk duet
Half-tone harmony from the sewer
Rebel youth choir belt phrases even newer
Dump truck man drops the beat with trash cans
Call 911! We got therapy demands
Philharmonic got a first chair car crash
Pan the falsetto to smash the glass
It's a drive-by lullaby that couldn't get worse
A melody abandoned in the key of New York

[Chorus]
Where nothing comes after
I'm a passtime streamer
Hanging from the rafters
I don't get out
I don't have fun
Living like a captive of the sun

[Bridge: Bun B]
So I gotta put my shades on
Riding through the city as I gets my escalade on
Flipping down the streets that my reputation was made on
King of the city, the mayor finna put a parade on
Drop the confetti from off the rooftop
While I come down candy and let my roof drop
I got a baddie shotgun in a tube top
With some daisy dukes on and some tube socks
Listening to 2Pac
You ain't know I do rock records
I do it all
I got my hands in some cookie jars
You ain't knew at all
I took a chance and threw caution up in the wind
Cuz I got nothing to lose but got something to win
We throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks
It's gon' end up being a bomb or being the shit
They said the fix was in, guess we'll know when it's done
Until then we'll just be captives of the sun

[Verse 2]
Sight read the chart
Clap the rocks into sand
A 12-pass van on a pot-hole band stand
Got an oil can hangover by default
And trucks pave the roads with amphetamine salt
Skull shaking cadence of the J train rolls
The rhythm of defeat, repeating like a pulse
Marching on and static, lyrics shout a retort
To the melody abandoned in the key of New York

[Chorus]
Where nothing comes after
I'm a passtime streamer
Hanging from the rafters
I don't get out
I don't have fun
Living like a captive of the sun
