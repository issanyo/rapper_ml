You need to stop playing 'round with all them clowns and the wankstas
Good girls gotta get down with the gangsta's
Go 'head girl, put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'm-a let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
If you got it, flaunt it, boy, I know you want it
While I turn around, you watch me check up on it
Ooh, you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin', you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it

Standin' on the top of the South like the King of the Hill
You're tuned into a winner that's never takin' a loss
