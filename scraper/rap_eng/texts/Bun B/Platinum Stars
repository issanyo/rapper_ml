[Verse 1: Lil' Flip]
Uh, Lil' Flip
I'm hopping out in a Fendi suit
I got DVDs in my Bentley coupe
I got hoes that's 22
They buy me clothes and tennis shoes
I'm so throwed when it come to hoes
Before I get they phone number they come outta they clothes
I might take 'em to Papadeaux's
But only if she a proper hoe
I got a Lac (what kind?), a Cadillac Escalade
I'm wearing Jordans (which ones?), very first ones made
I got a watch (what kind?), iced out Cartier
I gotta Rolley but that's something that I hardly wear
I'm Lil' Flip, the coldest freestyle ever
Since day one I was programmed to get this cheddar

[Hook]
Do you drive platinum cars?
Do you pull platinum stars?
Do you write platinum bars?
Platinum teeth inside your  jaws
Diamond gone rock my platinum wrist
Platinum toilet to take a ish
Gold is old and platinum is happenin'
So whodi watch this

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Yeah, look
You can often spot
Me walking out
Something on chrome in the parking lot
Surrounded by women who often jock
With Gucci across their halter tops
Super King Koopa is scorching hot
About to pull a yacht off the dock
Watch out I'm 'bout to knock off a drop
And the same day I'ma knock off the top
What you talking 'bout?
What they talking 'bout
Is the drop in my valet parking spot
The reason your woman wanna offer cot
Cause I'm 20 inches up off the lot
When I'm on the block
They often flock
Shirt Iceberg by drawers is not
Top is dropped
The block is hot
The rocks in my Rolex cost a lot
Swung so hard my rims fell off I broke my bumper and lost the shot
Pause and stop
Floss and pop
My trunk in the middle of a busy street
I let Lil' O install my alarm now my car be saying "Give me 50 feet"
The House we deep when you quick to beef
When you come around better make a quick retreat
We can throw 50 punches each
And I bet not one of them'll miss your cheek
Hit your cheek
Lift your feet
Fly in the air and hit the street
Throwed in the game
Holdin' the grain
Ice in the white gold of my chain
Raising my trunk and showing my bang
Glow in the rang
You know I'ma swang
Chamillion covered in princess cuts
When I come through I'm gripping my you know what
My nuts, speaking of nuts
Get off mine while I get my bucks (oooh)

[Verse 3: Bun B]
U (Under), G (Ground), K (Kings)
Bitch I'm the king of the underground
And the Pope of Port Arthur
Keep that fire heat on your street
And a meat in your daughter
Got no love for a hater, got no hate for a lover
Just distribute my pollution
Keepin' weight undercover, my brother
Now we back up on the block again
I got them rocks again, and the blocks again
Until' the cops come in
But see the better bring the SWAT my friend
Because I promise that we not runnin'
Nigga we gon' be here all day
Posted in this hallway
Keep them cluckers comin' in cause we serve 'em all yay
Them nickles and dimes and quarters
That pop of the rock you a boughta
But dough than we oughta, nigga we turnin' ya projects into the Carter
Got automatic starters for they automatics choppers
And the Texas boy a automatic to break you off somethin' proper
I knock off a bopper, break down a bird and bust me a flow
I'm down with the Pimp and the Prince
From now forever you don't like it you must be a ho so
