[Verse 1]
I'm taking out this time
To tell you that I'm
Done with all the fear that leaves the tears
From all the pain
With clarity of mind
My heart and soul falls in line
And I know all is fine, cause for every loss
There's a way to gain
Child, the natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes
Bills stacked high in masses
But I won't lose a wink of sleep
Cause better days are made within
If you can quickly count to ten
Like a pebble in a coastal sand
This here don't mean shit to me

[Chorus]
Everybody hands up (High)
Yeah, it's going down (That's right)
Even when you're feeling low
Just remember you can rock with me
Because the world didn't give it
So the world can't take it
When the winds of a storm blows
Just let it go
Put in in the wind
(Hey, just let it go)
Put it in the wind
(Front, back, side to side)

[Verse 2]
I'm talking to the dreamers
The true to self believers
Whether taking chances on the block
Or grinding out ya 9 to 5
Trying to get that money (Get, get that money)
You just want the life, the milk and honey
(You just want the life)
But you just gotta hold ya head
Because in time, you're gonna win

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Rap]
Put it in the dutchie
Pass it all around
Why you being stingy for?
People bought to drown
They be praying for the answers
But they can't hear the sounds
When the signs' dead in front of them
Like "Get free now!"
In the words of a cool ass nigga I once knew:
"Life's too short, lil' mama, do you!"
Everything going up
It was once low as tombs
Just remember hold ya head
Be slick 'bout how you move
It's a cold ass world
But ya girl on fire
Stay sucka free, get money, live fly
All these worries in the world ain't gone wear me out
Sip something out my cup, blow the smoke in the sky
And I'm banging out a stream
Music getting me high
Bob Marley said everything gone be alright
And I'm gone be alright
And you gone be alright
And we gone be alright
For real

Put it in the wind (Front, back, side to side)
[Repeat 4x]

I'm taking out this time
To tell you that I'm
Done with all the fear that leaves the tears
From all the pain
Child, the natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes
Bills stacked high in masses
But it don't mean shit to me
