Trickin on the cool, nigga payin for the freaky (freaky)
It ain't like I care but why your ass bein sneaky? (sneaky)
To each his own partner, move along partner

Give me fifty feet (feet) or maybe fifty yards (yards)
Fuck your fifty town, ? is fraud (fraud)
Say you got them yams and you sittin on some yay (yay)
Asked him for a ten piece, he hit me with a trey (trey)
Got me fucked up partner, who you tryin to play? (play)
Keep your dirty dope, your shit ain't butter anyway, okay?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Young Money Moe]
You better get in where you fit in
All these pussy ass niggas jumpin back on my dick again
Been ridin clean, pull up in the newest Benz
And I never lose, bitch I was born to win (I was born to win)
Man, all these niggas Powderpuffs
Talkin tough, all them drugs got 'em gassed up (gassed up)
And it's DOA, if Big Capp come
We'll put your body Underground, you could ask Bun (ask Bun)
I'm the last of a dyin breed
Thirty karats in the piece got your girl eyein me (mommy)
It's II Trill West, we a dynasty
'Cause I am, what you're tryin to be
Fuck where you're comin from, save your apologies
