[Intro]
Back one more again
Multi till the sun die
UGK for life
Good lord, good lord
It feels good to shine
Shine
Let's go

[Verse 1: K.R.I.T.]
By the time you probably heard this
I was on another verse bitch
Diamonds in the back with curtains
Breaking hoes off, I never dose off at my post
Never disrespect your host, or bite the hand that feed ya
Cufflinks cold as Ebenezer, my momma probably should of named me Caesar
Cleaner than a baptist preacher
That use to pimp
Gator shoes don't make the man
So primp primp
So keep on with that, like I won't whip back
Around in that lac, that you done seen
Don't worry about this, I'm serious about this
If you know what I mean
Shine on

[Hook]
Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine On
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining On
Ain't nobody tripping cause the money already made

[Verse 2: K.R.I.T.]
So lately I've been observing
A lot of these niggas look nervous
Come on in, don't be ashamed
Go and steal some game from my sermon
Cuz elevation to celebration, I preach that there
And that bullshit that they serving y'all, I don't eat that there
Keep that plate, I got my own
Don't test my patience, bitch I'm grown
It ain't much you can tell me, granny ain't already told me
And she wasn't wrong, yeah we that strong
So fuck your umbrella, rainy weather, and all that shade
If God ain't want me 2 shine, he never would of let me chop on blades
So shine on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
They say man make money, money don't make the man
But it's a little bit of both
Cuz it will take some change, for you to make some change
That ain't just some shit I wrote
Man thats natural fact, and not evolution
My mind game still evolving
And I'm gonna keep on rolling like 24s
And this world just keep revolving
Good at problem solving, cuz im good at starting shit in first place
And it feels so good to be where I'm at man, cuz where I was, was the worst place
But time change, so I keep hustling, boys trying to make my time cease
But I'm laid back with my dime piece, shining hard like my time piece and its on

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Shine baby (3x)
I need you to come on one more time and just shine babe
Shine baby (3x)
I need you to do it like you do and just shine baby
Shine baby (3x)
One more time for all my folk 'm gone shine babe
Shine baby (3x)
They Can't stop me from shining on my own
(Ain't no shining like we shining (7x))
(Ain't no shining like we shining babe)

[Hook]
