Uhhh! Bitch gon' get down on the flo'
You ain't gettin paper what you twerkin it fo'?

Need to leave with a pimp, time to have some fun
All these niggas is really lame

Bitch you know you like that
Choose a pimp, I'm the shit
Check the record, I'm legit
That nigga you with he counterfeit
He crawlin, I'm ballin bitch~!
Don't get offended when I call you by that pet name
Gon' be up in it when I stand up in that wet thang
Piece and chain, full of diamonds
Gettin paper the American way
Sable coat with silk lining
Upgrade, throw the mink away
I'm like Beyonce to the left
Any bitch can be replaced
But I stand to the right, shinin bright
Ready to put dick in your face
You don't want me to talk like that
You ever got fucked in a Maybach?
You ever got buck in the back of the 'llac?
Roof gone, top back

Monkey niggas playin dumb
Nigga knife, he ain't layin no pipe

Well this Big Dick Cheney and Tony Snow
We go Mighty Joe Young upside a ho head
And fuck how she feel like she bought the whole grid
I ain't payin attention to what the ho said
That ho can go 'head, if she ain't feelin it
She ain't goin nowhere, she love how I'm drillin it
Throw it up on her she throw it right, back
Bitch you know you like, that
In your mouth but don't bite, that
I'm a dog that's gon' bite, back
Do it doggystyle I'm gon' hit that
For an hour or two, is you with, that?
Toot it up and I'ma tap that
Fully pack that, then I'ma smack that
Bring it back back, yeah right back
Bitch you know you like that~!

Bitch don't use no hands, ho!
All jaws, pull it back

[Bun B]
Let me do what I wanna do let me do what I feel
C'mon ride sidesaddle with the king of the trill
All this damn conversatin ain't worth the breath

Cause bitch you know I like that
