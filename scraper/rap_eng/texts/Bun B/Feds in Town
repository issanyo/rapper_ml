[Verse 1: Bun B]
A bad day for the niggas in my clique
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It seems the drug situation is so to' up
In Po' town the fuckin DEA had to show up
I got shit sewed up so the 99 can’t hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret indictments now who’s next
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
Word on the streets is that they rollin
In Dynasties..I-ROCs…and Caravans and muthafuckas is FOLDIN
Like paper stacks in a rubberband
For an all out attack on your local crack slangin brothaman
And fiend servin is slow as fuck
Cause my niggas are nervous
And if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggas is Cappin with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town

[Hook: Pimp C]
And now they got me runnin from the feds (6x)

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my thangs off my buick and y'all know I ain't love that
Rollin' on some white walls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, you got to do your own nails
I told my niggas to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back crunk!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my clique
Got two birds and opened my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at rofom, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Slugs to the dome man God Damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
Cause in my yard is a big ass I got Yayo sign
It's time for Tony Montana stacks
I got niggas on the corner holdin big ass coffee cans and crack
Filling up Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fool come running with your Glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last slug
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight white
When the feds in town
