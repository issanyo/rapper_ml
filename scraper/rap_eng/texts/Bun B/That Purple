(Purple, purple, purple)
This is for the boys who sip purple and sip yellow
(Purple, purple, purple)
Actavis, double cup, double cup pour me up
Pour me up, pour me up

[Verse 1: Smug Mang & Bun B]
Too much shit's up in my system
Smug Mang been in the system
Voices in my head keep insisting
They persistent; "Keep it sipping"
So what'd I do?
Grab a double cup and pour me up Sprite and 7up
This is for the boys who sip purple and sip yellow
Pink, yellow, purple syrup I don't give a fuck
This is for the boys who sip purple and sip yellow
Tussionex, hydrocodine or promethazine

(Purple, purple, purple...)

[Verse 2: Chris Travis & Bun B]
I like the color purple, but I like my drank pink
And my reefa is the meanest cause it is the lightest green
And bitch I am the meanest but I show like greedy
But if you niggas trying to zip then I feel a little needed
Of that money, paper, green
This is for the boys who sip purple and sip yellow
Money, paper, green, that's all a nigga need
Money bathing, money all a nigga need
This is for the boys who sip purple and sip yellow
Money, money, money, money, all a nigga need
That money bathing

(Purple, purple, purple...)
