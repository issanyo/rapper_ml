[Verse 1 - B.o.B]
You may not know my name but by the time I leave
You'll remember the B to the O to the B
And every single dot that's in between
And every time I hop up in the scene
I'm feelin' like I'm better than before
I'm ready for whatever if you feel me let me know
Cause I just wanna flow
I got up in this game tryna prove than I'm better than before
But I don't even sweat it anymore
I get up in the zone as I coast
As I take flight gravity better hold me tight
Your relativity don't mold me right
I'm every single kick, every snare, every line
Please don't compare niggas to me cause I'm HAM on the mic
I'm down for the gamble like a red pair of dice
You scared of the fight
When you lay down and prepare for the night
I be in the air on a flight
I don't even care what the time, high in the days of my mind
Every single face that'll say "Hey Bobby Ray" I say "Hi"
You livin' the craziest life
In a pair of shades I'mma bathe and the spotlight rays
Makin' every night club jump like raves
Braves, braves, home of the braves
Eastside Atlanta, that's where I stay

[Hook]
Yeah, I'll take you higher
Higher than you've ever been
See things you never thought
You thought would never exist, higher
Higher than you've ever been
Where we go we won't fall, we'll stay there
Cuz there's a place with no walls
It's been ages since we've gone
Get away, so long, levitate
Higher than you've ever been

[Verse 2 - Playboy Tre]
Yeah, what am I to tell you?
Streets never gave a drunk nothing but double shot of Hen
Couple friends in the pen, do a couple years come home
Year later, nigga locked up again
Man, calls on the phone, nigga what the biz?
God damn ya'll doin' ya'll thang
If life is a game, Tre, play that shit for your folk
Come home with the ring, champs
Do it for the hood, do it for the camp
Passport livin' nigga do it for the stamps
Do it for the deck 'til there ain't nothin' left
Beat a bitch back like a trunk full of amps
Trunk full of amps? Trunk full of amps
Posted up drunk on the street like lamps
Everybody high, but a word to the wise
Don't try my clique cuz they might get amped
So this for my niggas locked up who call
Said they want beats and the show's on the wall
Know every time that I hit that stage
I don't do it for myself man, I do it for us all
This for my niggas locked up who write
Take it through you, try and live my life
Fuck what they say, nigga get your pay
They wanna go high, so watch me fly

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Higher (Higher than you've ever been)
Higher (Higher)
Higher (Higher than you've ever been)
Higher (Higher)

[Verse 3 - CyHi Da Prynce]
Okay, higher than you've ever been
Just when you won't find a better medicine
Now I highly recommend that you smoke it in a sweet
As me where I got it and I'll say I met a friend
Police at the door, I would never let them in
Everyday I wake up and try to set a trend
Thomas Edison with whatever I invent
Now I'm in a country that you ain't never been
Netherlands, doin' more interviews than David Letterman
I don't know too many niggas better than
Prynce CyHi, so who want a better Benz?
Vanilla, or yellow skin
Big booty bitch, call her Evelyn
Vegetarian when it comes to the green
Get your dog shot like a veterinarian
Tool in the seat
Fly young nigga keep it cool in the heat
Calmer than the farmer cuz I'm used to the beef
Got more soul than the shoes on your feet
Still a nigga free, then I move it to the east
She probably your girl, then she cute and petite
She said she got a man, what you doin' with a geek?
Fuck him baby, come and chill with the king

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Bun B]
Feels so dandy, comin' out candy
Grippin' on grain in a clean 'Lac
Go jump in the slab, put your seatbelt on
Then adjust your position and lean back
It's Bun B and B.o.B and we be all about them greenbacks
And we ain't farmin' no mean mugs
Or no lean thugs cuz we mean that
Represent, Lone Star State and Crush City, home of the Astros
Where them boys on the porch
Smokin' on kush, in a cigar, straight from Castro
We in the kitchen makin' all them fires
Gettin' that dough with havin' to pass go
And if you in the way of me and B.o.B gettin' this pay
We gon' let your ass know
That we the chosen, while you in time frozen
We go straight ahead
They sayin' he ain't this and he ain't that and he can't rap
Well man, fuck what a hater says
I keep on rollin' like a bald tire
With a bad broad out of Vogue, fire
Underground King, go to my empire
Cuz they might be high, but I'mma take them higher

[Hook + Bridge]
