[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy paint
Everybody just comparing
Everybody tryna sell drugs
Everybody think they the plug
Everybody wanna ride Forgis now
Ain't nobody tryna ride dubs
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy paint
Everybody just comparing
Everybody tryna sell drugs
Everybody think they the plug
Everybody wanna ride Forgis now
Ain't nobody tryna ride dubs

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Candy, candy, candy
Spent 20 grand on my engine
Put Louis V on my women
I'm sippin' on lean, I'm dizzy
Got digital dash in my Cutlass
Got this shit from Duffy
Ain't get this with no rap money
I got this shit from Doubling
Everybody outchea hustlin'
Nigga, you broke, you buggin'
Fuck you, lil' hoe, you ugly
I got that bag, I got that luggage
I got dirty money, Houston, Texas
I'm sippin' dirty muddy
I told that bitch, I just want some sucky-sucky
I don't want no lovey-dovey
Everybody wanna have everythin'
Everybody wanna ride candy paint
Every bitch want her weddin' ring
When these bitches been fuckin' on everythin'
Everybody wish they had a connect
Everybody want an Audemar Piguet
I ain't Paul Wall coming to you permanent
Got a Glock 17 with a 30 clip

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy paint
Everybody just comparing
Everybody tryna sell drugs
Everybody think they the plug
Everybody wanna ride Forgis now
Ain't nobody tryna ride dubs
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy paint
Everybody just comparing
Everybody tryna sell drugs
Everybody think they the plug
Everybody wanna ride Forgis now
Ain't nobody tryna ride dubs

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Everybody wanna ride candy paint (paint)
Everybody wanna come down (down)
Everybody wanna drop top
Let the trunk go pop and bang that surround (round)
Everybody wanna have a Styrofoam cup
Matter of fact, they want two (why?)
So, they can sip on that motherfuckin' sizzurp
Like they heard from DJ Screw (ooh)
Everybody wanna claim blue (blue)
Everybody wanna claim red (red)
Everybody wanna bang out
'Til they got a .45 to they motherfuckin' head (head)
Everybody say they got bread (bread)
Racks stuffed inside the mattress (mattress)
But, you'd be the dumbest motherfucker ever born
If you sittin' around believin' that shit (that shit)
Everybody wanna be a rapper (rapper)
Shinin' like a boss on stage (stage)
But, it's gonna take mo' than some YouTube likes
And a gaddamn IG page (page)
Everybody wanna be who they can't (can't)
Instead of tryna be who they are (are)
Man, this shit won't get you to far
You'll never be a star regardless of the paint on your car

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy paint
Everybody just comparing
Everybody tryna sell drugs
Everybody think they the plug
Everybody wanna ride Forgis now
Ain't nobody tryna ride dubs
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy
Everybody wanna ride candy paint
Everybody just comparing
Everybody tryna sell drugs
Everybody think they the plug
Everybody wanna ride Forgis now
Ain't nobody tryna ride dubs
