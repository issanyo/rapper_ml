[Verse One] [Mike Posner]:
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hours, nine AM
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
But nobody home gon' remember my name

[Hook]:
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no
I'm a rocket man

[Verse Two]:
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
You don't wanna be high
High like me

[Hook]:
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man

Eh, eh I'm a rocket man
Yeah I'm a rocket man
I'm a rocket man

[Verse Two] [Bun B]:
Houston we got some problems
I don't know how your boy gonna solve them
The command center just won't link
And the comm. set's down I don't know what to think
Happen in a blink, sorta like the Big Bang
How can something so small turn into a big thang
One small move turn in to a big chain
No bass, no treble, all mid range
And it seems so strange, but it all makes sense
My back against the wall, end-up behind the fence
Situations always get so tense
And I just want us to still be friends
But we just argue, fuss and fight
And we scream and yell and we cuss all night
And it seems that we're always so uptight
Think that it's time that I book this flight
Took all my might but I feel so weak
So much to say but I just can't speak
Gotta be done but it kill me to do it
Came as a surprise, but we always knew it
So I'm taking this trip, no plane no car
Might be close and it might be far
But later than soon, when you look up at the moon
I'll be next to it shining like a star

[Hook]:
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man
