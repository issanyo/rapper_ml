[Hook: Gunplay]
They wonder how I stay on top
I'll tell you how I break it down
They wonder how, how hard I grind
Look at my shine and I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
If you don't know, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
If you ain't heard, I break it down

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Heckler & Koch - there go the cops
Dig in your socks, get rid of your rocks
Don't go to jail, you got no bail
Won't get no meal, that's living hell
Keep your face clean, always need a front
Get back on your feet then attack the street
Show them you're raw, they think you're [?]
They just don't know [?] in your car
Do not get capped, keep your brains in your hat
It is not worth it, a life is so worthless
Keep your dough close, lock up your game room
Keep your team tight, strategically make moves
I play for keeps, keep the streets hostage
Watch for imposters, they pose amongst us
Then when you spot them infrared dot them
Gunpowder in copper, I break it down proper

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Clips in, gloves on, lights off, mask on
Steel toe the back door, then get your blast on
Take what you're supposed to, leave what you not
Then you pick up the cases then bone out the spot
These tales of a gangster I tell with such clarity
This is the real deal, G, not a parody
Ain't no ki-ki'ing, [?] hilarity
Bullets bust evenly with no disparity
Watch for the bullshit, there's traps in the game
All dreads ain't a gangster, all four-eyes ain't lame
You can't trust the book by its cover, believe that
Take it from me, player, it's best to read that
Trill shit, we need more - fake, we don't need that
That's the type of shit that make a red blood bleed black
These niggas are greener than my motherfucking weedsack
But that's just my comments, I'll wait for your feedback

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
[?] Champagne I crave
[?] with drugs, drugs that I blaze
Speaking of drugs, plugs that I've made
Can't see my house, cars in the way
I am Osama, ask that boy 50
I brings the drama, [?]
Chickens we fry, snitches gon' die
I see the papers, I damn near cry
I loaded mine, I keeps it full
One in the chamber, I am a fool
When I explode, I pull you close
Hoes in your clothes, time to get ghost

[Hook]
