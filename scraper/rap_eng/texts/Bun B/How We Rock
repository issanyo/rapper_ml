[Intro: Termanology] (DJ Premier scratching)
Uh! Premo, Pre-mo, Bun B, Bun-B (Now-Now-Now this is how we rock!)
This is how we (ROCK) This is how we (ROCK)
This is how we (R-R-R-ROCK-ROCK)
This is how we (You ready?) Let's go, yeah!
(Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now this is how we rock!)

[Verse 1: Termanology]
Yo! Hopped off this phone with Bun, rolled this blunt
Told him son your album so cold I'm numb
Fittin to go plat, but If I go gold just once
I copped enough coke and guns to open Trump
Towers of my own, then I control the slums
Where the birds and the rats and the roaches from
Far as rap goes, I'm the coldest one
Just gimme the mic, I'll show you the soul of Pun
Like, I'll grip the mini matic irratically fat as family
Snatchin vanity Violator couldn't manage me
Uh! They don't really want it what Tony Montana be sniffin
Danity Kane so insane is reality
My pain is reality, grippin this mic
After me other rappers don't sound that TIIIIGHHHHHHHHHTTTTTT!!!!
Ology in the place with Bun B
And we got what it takes to rock the mic RIIIGHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!

Chorus: Termanology] (DJ Premier scratching)

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I be jumpin out the bushes like a jag, boy
Better watch yo' back boy, the king of the trill is in the buildin
Killin the track boy, act boy, like you want do it
Get smacked, boy, head cracked boy, I thought you knew it
Matter fact, boy, you in the wrong place with the wrong one
On the shark pier and you 'bout to walk the long one
Sing a sad song son, play a violin
To your preacher to the choir, G I'm about to end you
Bun B, the best that did it and still doin it
Cut on the track and I'm black and blue in it, ruin it
Like a, wet dream better keep it movin like a jet stream
With me and Termanology out to get cream
We on the next scheme while you still plannin the first
Dyin of thirst, I po' out a bottle for Pimp C!
UGK fo' life, nothing above it
With Premier on the beat and Termanology you gotta love it!

[Verse 3: Termanology]
Put the mind and the body with the rhyme and the shotty
Gonna find me a mami sippin lime and Bacardi
Get down like John Gotti with the mafia behind me
Gettin profit like the sign me army closin when ya find me then
Uh, I keep bombin that Osama ship predominately coffins
At the novelist involed in this more tonic shit
You gotta follow it the cat you pop a bottle with
Still, go on and rock this shit Bun what's the politics?

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Term, you already know it's Obama '08
Cats in the streets is like, mo' skama, mo' weight
The rap industry is mo' drama, mo' hate
Mo' Money means you got Mo' Problems on yo' plate
It's all good though cause we still in the hood though
Gettin love where these fake rappers wish they could go
I wish they would show they face in the ghetto
We put 'em in a nice, deep, dark place in the ghetto, for real!
