[Verse 1: Bun B]
Open a book, let’s take walk through the mind of a trill one
Who will come from the left real fast, tryna kill one
Or two of you hoes, by just beatin’ ya black and blue
And if I miss while I’m shooting, I’m giving my gat to you, nigga
‘Cause I ain’t scared to rest in peace
So if you wanna buy death, then invest in me
‘Cause I don’t run from a gun, I’ll take the shot and the pain
My soul might go, but my trillness remains
And even if I got bloodstains on my clothes
Hangin’ on to life, I’ll still say, “Fuck you hoes”
So if thinking ‘bout tryin’ to jack me up
I got 50,000 trill niggas to back me up, nigga
So smack me up if you think you got it like that
Shoot me all you want, I’ll be damned if I don’t fight back
Try to take mine, nigga, but I don’t forget
Gotta bring nuts to take nuts, and I got a six-pack
You want what’s mine, take me out or do what I did
Bullshit’s caught up in a muthafuckin’ hybrid
Fuck this, fuck that, fuck white, fuck black, and fuck hollow
I’m true to my shit, nigga, too hard to swallow

[Chorus]
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Bitch, I’m too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Nigga, I’m too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Fool, too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Now, one by one, I see muthafuckas comin’, muthfuckas go
Half went out like soldiers, they other half went out like a hoe
But by act of due process, I’ve risen to fame
By kicking ass and taking muthafuckin’ names
Again and again, I’m given fame from my actions
But with the gat in my hand, I’m the muthafuckin’ man
And any nigga out that oppose this
Just step to the stage and get your ass taken out in a blind rage
I ain’t gave a fuck since birth, but for what the shit’s worth
Ain’t no need for me to finish if I ain’t comin’ out first
And if I curse or scream out loud and banned ‘em
Muthafuckas might never see the bullet I’ma hand ‘em
See, for every nigga out there that don’t like me or spite me
You can get your ass tore with a left and a right, G
‘Cause I’m down for my shit note for note, verse for verse
Line for line, rhyme for muthafuckin’ rhyme
With my nine, my niggas, my blunts and my nuts
I put the real in your face straight from the muthafuckin’ place
That I got it from, fool, ‘cause I know that I’m bored
By you hoe ass niggas, pull your triggers
I’m too hard to swallow

[Chorus]
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Bitch, I’m too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Nigga, I’m too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Fool, I’m too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Niggas always comin’ with that hoe shit
Knowin’ damn well they get they muthafuckin’ wig split
Pimp C, bitch, so what the fuck is up, hoe?
Somebody better tell him better act like he know
‘Cause I don’t owe a nann nigga not a nann muthafuckin’ dime
So he better get that shit in his muthafuckin’ mind
So don’t try to play me so close, kid
‘Cause you just might catch a .38 slug in your muthafuckin’ head
So fuck all the actin’ like the hoes, and fuck the snitches
‘Cause most of them niggas is just some jealous punk bitches
Yeah, I pulled your whole rope, step up to this hoe
And get your hoe ass neck broke
I need to check a few niggas in my town
That been broke and keein’ in my face and be claimin’ that they down
A lot of niggas don’t understand but I know a few follow
Hold up, bitch, because I’m too hard swallow

[Chorus]
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Bitch, I’m too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Nigga, I’m too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
(Fool, too hard to swallow)
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
Watch your back, nigga
