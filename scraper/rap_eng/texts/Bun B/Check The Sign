[Hook: Big KRIT]
You can’t, you can’t walk a mile, you can’t walk a mile in mine
You can’t walk a mile, you can’t walk a mile in mine
You can’t walk a mile, you can’t walk a mile in mine
I do rap super fly all the time, check the sign
Check the sign, check the sign, check the sign, check the sign
Check the sign, check the sign, check the sign, check the sign
You can’t, you can’t walk a mile, you can’t walk a mile in mine

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Back when me and young Pimp C was out there on the grind
When all that we was focused on was money on our minds
We was all up in the studio, putting it down for days
At the time, with them beats and rhymes, and we had on them Js
Pimp said if you wanna be great affiliate with greatness
Best clothes, best shoes, best music on your playlist
So we bought a bunch of Polo and we jammed a bunch of ‘Pac
And we put on fresh Jordan’s when we stepped out on the block
I was lovin’ them 11's ‘cause they came with patent leather
And if you had a candy car that shit just went together
You thinking that I’m playing ‘bout being an 11 lover?
Check the back of Ridin’ Dirty, I wore ‘em on the cover

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Out the wrap, freshly packaged, Jordan 12s, copped a taxi
My shoe game be the truth, mane - if it’s dead stock, I’ve got to have it
At Sneaker Pimps and Ice Kicks, I hit the stage with that Jordan braille
A few months before they came out
That’s just how it be, know you understand
And this flight club that we be in – black and varsity red
Couldn’t wait to ball on ‘em, stand tall on ‘em
‘Cause them flu games go Fed
So when I hit the stage life
Yeah, them stage lights put the shine on my kicks
Tuck those laces up when I stage dive, these strains got to stay crispy
I’ve got 12 for all of my fits, and gold all on my wrist
And rings all on my fist, like I was in championships
In this game with E and this game with Play, I stay fly like every day
Be it in the club, on the streets or on the stage, I still got my J's
