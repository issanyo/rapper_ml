Yo, what up? This is Trill OG Bun B reppin' UGK for life. I wanna talk to you about my homie Rich O'Toole and that Texas country music he makes. You heard of Texas country music, right? It's that country/rock genre down here in H-Town that we represent. Kinda like how we represent that H-Town rap music scene, you know what I'm sayin'? But it's a little different, see Texas music in general is an art form that showcases all the great talent that we got right here from the Lone Star State. Rock music, rap music, country music, EDM, all of that stuff man, we got it right here, and all of it represents the heart and soul of Texas music baby. Matter a fact, why don't you stay tuned, 'cause we gonna play you some of that Texas country music, courtesy of Rich O'Toole, baby. keep it trill, and long live Texas music. It's goin' down, you got it from here Rich
