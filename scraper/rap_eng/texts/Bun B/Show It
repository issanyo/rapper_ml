[Hook: BeatKing]
If you getting money, young nigga show it
Young nigga show it
If you getting money, young nigga blow it
Young nigga blow up
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, hold up, hold up

[Verse 1: BeatKing]
Club god got the juice
Pull up in that coupe, all the strippers call me Zeus
Praise this name, I got to the paper with no excuse
Tip it, slap it, tease in the back, my trunk sit obtuse, swoosh
I just ran game on the yellow
Tip it, swang, hit the propeller
I be down the block, I get gwuap, I'm sippin' drank, rich forever
Nigga I be banging these hoes, never saving these hoes
From the North to the South, my paper or else I'm a boss, I swang any 4's
Paper full of bottles, table full of models
If a nigga mean muggin' then it's a table full of problems
Texas Hammer gang
We got Tec's and hammers aimed at your motherfucking brain
And they ain't coming from the pawn shop so they ain't gone jam
I'm bending corners in the lamb'
Bitch I'm Club God, broke [?]
H Town we been stuck cause we ain't got no more Act
Young nigga show them racks, hold up

[Hook: BeatKing]
If you getting money, young nigga show it
Young nigga show it
If you getting money, young nigga blow it
Young nigga blow up
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, hold up, hold up

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Say man I'm rollin through the city
Late night up in the whip
My chrome shoe shining with the wood grain to grip
No punch for me to sip but it's a swisher on my lip
And it's pistol on my lap foo, so don't you even trip
With BeatKingKong in the concrete jungle
In a baby blue big body Benz, no struggle
The muzzle's on the Magnum but I used to use potatoes
Leave your shirt red bitch and not with no tomatoes
Pussy lay low like it's that time of the month
Use that heater like a tampon, put it in your cunt
I talk blunt and I smoke blunts, they with kush too
Haters try and everything they can but I push through
I'm from the home of [?]
I can get the music done and also get it poppin'
Hit you with the shot bitch from way behind the arch
I'm the boogie man bitch don't let me me catch you after dark
Mothafucka

If you getting money, young nigga show it
Young nigga show it
If you getting money, young nigga blow it
Young nigga blow up
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, throw it on that bitch
Throw it on that bitch, hold up, hold up
