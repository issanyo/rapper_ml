I do ride bently's and coupes. But I don't give away all my looks trip over a silly tramp I don't ride less than twenty inches I won't

But I do know this may be a single when I walk my chains on so it my jingle if she give me brainzz on
The haters know were my crew so famous that I can't go no wherin tha lou You name it the mall the gas station dem people
Be waiting to see me hop in sumin hating all the dudes to skating
Runnin it like walter paton until you fuked it its so blatent fuck the paper I'm savin my bank acount is amazin
I'm ratin my self a 20 I'm takin my self on 20's I'm doin this show for 20 then holla at me this 20 about money
I gots ta make stack up a couple hundred mill then take my ass a break

Chorusx2

I gotta 75 caprice in my yard! a loui drop top raff kicks man its hard! custom made interior dirrty its the
Shit ratin spins n spokes 24s on it. yep gotta tv and steerin wheels like luda n if you run up on me look dirrty

G.i.b 1 on my customized plates slide a lot bottles don't never come fake.. I'm about to hit lillian just past
Clackston wippin with a piece that's better than tony brackston haters or right I'm with my few and team bumps
I got the 3 amps and the woofers in my trunk yeyah I no you money hungry hoes wanna roll with trick you no I ride
Nothin less than them dubs
