[Chorus]
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
A pimp that's rolling this clean, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
You ain't never met a nigga like Pimp C ho
'Fore you come into my room take off your shit at the do'
If you comin to my hotel then you game to fuck
And if you fuckin with a Pimp then bitch your game is up
If your bitch get mad when you play this talk
Put her ass out on the highway, make that bitch walk
I ain't make this shit up, this shit old
You need to stop treatin these bitches like ladies
And these nice ladies like hoes
Standin on the front row, man this ho a trip
She done opened up her legs and let me scope the pussy lips
Later on tonight, I'mma get behind her
I hope this bitch don't act like Pimp C payin' for no vagina

[Chorus]
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
A pimp that's rolling this clean, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well you can catch me shoppin', checkin out the hoes boppin'
Choppin' up game to keep 'em lap hoppin'
Poppin' to a Carrington show stoppin'
Proppin' up a wheel and maybe ass droppin'
Breakin' haters off can't be mistaken for fakin'
Fools are the ones left shakin', flakin'
Marijuana deals with Jamaicans
Bakin up the powder to a fat cake an'
Mashin from the scene almost crashin', flashin'
Cop lights keep a player dashin'
Cash-in, on the crack course, paper stashin'
With a passion for high-priced fashion
My danky clothes and my eighty-fo's clanky
God thank ye, motherfucker's acting cranky
Stanky, attitudes be janky
I think he, gon' hafta feel the sting from the rang on my panky

[Chorus]
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
A pimp that's rolling this clean, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Think I ain't heavy strokin', you must be jokin'
Tokin', on some shit I don't even be smokin'
That coke and, marijuana got yo' ass loc'n
Croakin', sleepin motherfuckers 'til they woken
I'm still crunk at five in the mornin'
Why yo' ass yawnin? I'm flowin 'til the crack of dawn an'
Laughin as ya pawn ya posessions
Yes it's been worldwide tested
Showin off my diamond investments

[Verse 4: Pimp C]
A bitch, ain't shit to a pimp
A twenty ounce steak and some fried side of shrimp
A 600 S's, now the 6 drop
Everything I ride original no kits on them chops
18 inch Lorenzos, Yokohama tires
When I ride by all them bitches get they pussy all on fire
Bitches say I highside, ho it ain't no thang
Y'all just blinded by the diamonds the Pimp the pinky rang

[Chorus]
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
A pimp that's rolling this clean, oh yeah
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women, fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
A pimp that's rolling this clean, oh yeah

[Outro: Pimp C]
