Wherever I'm going they know I'm putting it down
I'm up in the town they know I'm coming around
For the town, for the city, for the country
We just hunting for the money, tell 'em all that
I'm coming around
(Hometown I get around)
Around
(Double crown I put it down)
Around
(Hometown I get around)
Around
(Double crown I put it down)
I'm coming around
(Hometown I get around)
Around
(Double crown I put it down)
Around
(Hometown I get around)
Around
(Double crown I put it down)
I'm coming around

[Verse 1: D-Pryde]
Had to push it with empty wallets
Too big, now mr. Wallet
Small kid with big attentions
With a small amount of cash up in my pocket
We grew up in the 'burbs
Quick pages we just turned
Yeah mistakes is what we make
But you live and then you learn
Chicks can hunt you, yeah they'll scare you
Yeah they'll take over your job
Better focus fast before them girls
Go eat your ass alive
We be climbing crazy high
Cause there isn't nothing more to do
But I'mma grind it 'till
I make that Go yard team affordable
Mama cries on my shoulder
She told me she got cancer
She told me Russell get famous
I felt down, down like Atlanta
I swear to God I'm gonna do it
I'm hoppin' killing tracks
And what they say just don't hurt me
I know God don't make no trash
From a town in depression
Where we hate to be or we need to go
Living a vision that we be in it to get it
We not in a position we were years ago
In my town, throw it up
I puts it down and they know it's up
In the city I'm super cold
My town, my fans is what I do it for
Like uhh

[Hook]
Wherever I'm going they know I'm putting it down
I'm up in the town they know I'm coming around
For the town, for the city, for the country
We just hunting for the money, tell 'em all that
I'm coming around
(Hometown I get around)
Around
(Double crown I put it down)
Around
(Hometown I get around)
Around
(Double crown I put it down)
I'm coming around
(Hometown I get around)
Around
(Double crown I put it down)
Around
(Hometown I get around)
Around
(Double crown I put it down)
I'm coming around

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Sunny day in PA so I'm pulling out my slab
I'mma shine it up real good
Then head out on the af
Got my rims all shining
My paint is all drippy
That purp' up in my cigar
Got me feelin' all trippy
Man I'm stoned like a hippy
But living like a don
And I'm the king in my city
Cause I'm always putting on
Now some people like it
And some people don't
But they ain't done a damn thing
About it yet ,and they won't
I'm just trying to take this bread
Stack this paper for my family
And if you ain't down with that
Then I really don't give a damn
When they hear you might be coming
From a way they hear you going
And it's UGK for life if you ain't already know it
I'm G'd up from the feet up
Jordans 'til my cap
And I don't break bread with no lames
So don't ask me for no gap
It's deeper than this rap
Everything ain't what it seems
If you tryin' to keep it true
You better get down with this team
Come on, where we going?
