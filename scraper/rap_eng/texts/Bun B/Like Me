[Hook:]
You can look at my life
And see what I see
But you can never
You can never do it like me
You can never
You can never do it like me
Like me

[Verse 1: Llyod]
Baby we go hard
Since my mama burnt me
Said I was a shawty
Fighting around in the nursery
Never knew my father
So I grew up early
I never had no business
Like a nigga in his thirty's
Now that money ain't a problem
Livin' like we moppin'
Care about the boulevard
That's why we go hard
Cause once upon a time we were at the bottom
And I really hated being on the bottom
Up, up in that third wall
I would write songs
Bout the day I could turn the lights on
That I could see the day
That I could perform
In front of these crowds
Look at me now
That's why I say

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Llyod]
I saw this hard work
Hadn't been rewarded
Dedicated my life tryin' to get it
Oh stay true to yourself don't fraught it
Never talked about it
Everybody live it
Calling the shots now
I'm the boss man
Got the whole wideworld in my hand
I'm at the top now
But I did it my way
Told them haters hit the highway
Said I remember those days
I would write songs
About the day I could turn the lights on
That I could see the day
That I could perform
In front of these crowds
Look at me now
That's why I say

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Say man, Look up in the sky it's a plane, it's a bird (bird)
Now it's just the thrillest playaz that you ever heard, we recognize it's real
Comin' out the dirty third, A-K-A third coast you comin close,say word
I doubt you've been were I been (been), seen what I saw (saw)
The struggles that come with that hustle that's why I'm raw (raw), and build tougher (tougher), rougher (rougher), realer, I came up against
The muggers(muggers), jackers (jackers), killers(killers), day to day dealers(dealers)
They talk you out your last dime(dime), I came from all leverage chose a different past time
I grab the penny pad (pad), and put my life in it (in it)
Eyes on the prize hoping that I might win it (win it)
Me and pimp put the pain to the music and people understood it wasn't fake it was true shit (true shit), and now look what we became, OG and the thrillest in the game you can't do it like me
