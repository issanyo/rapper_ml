[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
Everythang I touch turn to gold
Rose ghettos everywhere that I stroll, crown got the glow
Gin creep up super slow like
Pop off the trunk, drop the top on the slab
Had the AK, had the, had the AK
The gin creep up super slow like
Pop off the trunk, drop the top on the slab
Had the, had the AK, h-had the AK
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence

[Verse 1: Bun B]
When my go mode is instant
Flow mode is infinite, whole mode is some pimping shit
Yeah, my wordplay is intricate
Influence significant, motherfucking magnificent
And my influence is integral
Charismatic essential, fucking up your centrifugal
With trill pumpin' up through my ventricles
Gladiators and sentinels, peep you through the peripherals
I see you pussy niggas out the optical
Catch your ass when it’s optimal, light you up like an Optimo
Got a little legal with a colossal flow
Fading me is impossible, fuck boys so you gots to go

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
Everythang I touch turn to gold
Rose ghettos everywhere that I stroll, crown got the glow
Gin creep up super slow like
Pop off the trunk, drop the top on the slab
Had the AK, had the, had the AK
The gin creep up super slow like
Pop off the trunk, drop the top on the slab
Had the, had the AK, h-had the AK
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Bitch, I'm old school like an Acura
Flip flows like a spatula, verses full of vernacular
Creep up on ya like a tarantula
Darker than Blacula, no speculation I'm spectacular
And my insight is immaculate
Name on me is so accurate, hoe, you don’t know the half of it
We gon' sing your homies some factful shit
Then relay on my tactics, deeper on some didactic shit
I'm just out here tryna educate
Build you up mayne and elevate, lift you up 'til you levitate
Expedite the shit up to a better rate
Ignorance tend to hesitate, fuck it then we gon' let 'em wait

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
Everythang I touch turn to gold
Rose ghettos everywhere that I stroll, crown got the glow
Gin creep up super slow like
Pop off the trunk, drop the top on the slab
Had the AK, had the, had the AK
The gin creep up super slow like
Pop off the trunk, drop the top on the slab
Had the, had the AK, h-had the AK
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hustle meticulous, so concerned with particulars
Hard as hell makin' millions, it still remain inconspicuous
Bitches be so adventurous, they get wet when you mention us
Even the white ones, daddy hear 'bout it, they think of lynchin' us
Government plans, fencin' us in, life in the pen'
For sellin' shit you put in our hood, knowin' I'll do it
We desperate, starvin' and dyin' to eat, die in the street
For a fraction of what I get now for a soundin' fly on the beat
Hmm, I'm the anomaly, honestly, you should honor me
But how can I act like I'm the shit like wasn't no one in front of me?
I cannot acknowledge all the pimpin' Bun had done for me
Okay, listen fella, never ever disrespect the predecessor

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
