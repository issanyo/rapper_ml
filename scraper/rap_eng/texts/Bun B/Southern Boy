If Flip was here he would go "What is y'all saying?"

I'm push a truck, nigga I'm drive a Benz
Mutha fuck the 8's nigga I'm get the 10's
I'm drink everything, I'm get drunk
Watch the shoes, I'm show you dudes, I'm bout to pop the trunk
I'm be captivator, I'm be calm
Hat to the shirt, to the pants playa WOAH
I'm play Polo, I'm stay rich
I'm bout to bust the southside in this bitch
I'm stay with Sprint mutha fuck Nextel
(Can you hear me now, I don't love no gal)
I'm eat chicken playa I'm sip lak
And push the old school Caddy with the Diamond in the Back
I'm get the candy paint just because I know you can't
Pussy, pussy, pussy your life is blank
I'm get the new J's smoke all the purple haze
I'm stick with game spittin', game spittin' in your face

[Hook: Lil Wayne] 2x
Cause Im a mutha fuckin' southern boy
Coming down so clean, and with rhymes so mean
Heavy starch in my jeans
I want Criss, want hard, fuck a nigga, fuck a broad
You can't stop my southern flow
Cause I'm a mutha fuckin' southern boy

Look I ride the biggest truck
20 inches don't give a fuck
When I roll nigga know I'm plush
Coming round and I'm high as fuck
Green truck, lift up, spinnin' blades is a must
Wood grain, suede and leather, feelin' good with this Cali weather
I can go in any hood get a nigga they know I could
Coming round and I'm iced up too
Nigga know bout me and my crew
Laying low, being cool
Smoking weed is what we do
Moving ki's bought that coupe
Stacking G's is what we do
Nigga know that I'm slanging that iron
Fuck around trying to take my shine
Nigga know that I'm bout gettin' mine
Hustlin, flippin' when I'm on that grind
Nigga know we got work uptown
Fuck around and we shut you down
Pussy, pussy, pussy, you pussy pussy bitch

I'm pimping through the south holding my nuts
I'm in my candy apple red cadillac car rolling them dutch
White cuts with that stitch and tuck, lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Find a slut lil fifty buck, look like you need this dick to suck
I'm truck turner pimping, with Issac Hayes roll on
Just another pimp gettin' his stroll on bitch hold on
You staring at a pimp, tryin' to look him in his eyes
When you prctice southballin', if you get broke don't be surprised
Tell no lies about this mackin', some win and some be losin'
If you fuckin' with my paper, you cruisin' for a bruisin'
So let there be no confusion, pimping ain't no illusion
Don't believe me ask (?), she shorted my lil brother
She mutha fuckin' paged chose a pimp like no other
We all about that dollar bitch so when you see a pimp don't try to holla
Wipe me down and pop my collar

[Hook] 2x
