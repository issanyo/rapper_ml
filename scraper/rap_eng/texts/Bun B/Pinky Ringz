[Verse 1 – Scotty ATL]
My Cadillac fucking ready, pinky rings up in the sky
Let em know I fucking live for em or I fucking die
Please pardon my excellence know it’s kinda petty but
The king is coming, I’m just tryna get him ready
Bout 1980 something back, don’t forget it
Tryna take over the streets like the crack epidemic
Get [?], tweakers and music junkies alike
Let’s try to work inside like an exercise bike
I’m pimping, not literally
Got no hoes on the track, but a nigga do feel like that
He was fly in grade school, nigga still like jack
Picture man took his still right quick, we taking over [?]

[Hook – Mookie Jones]
Who that boy, in that car
With that watch, on his arm
Counting cake right in your face
Like please don’t hate, all they say
Put your pinky rings up
Put your pinky rings up high
Put your pinky rings up
Put your pinky rings up high
Put your pinky rings up

[Verse 2 – Scotty ATL]
Put your pinky rings up
Keep them motherfuckers up high, then wave them hoes in the sky
Fire up a blunt, let a nigga get high
I defy gravity, nigga getting so fly
Whatchu talking bout, whatchu talking bout (whatchu talking bout)
Man I can’t fall [?]
I ain’t even got an Audemar, but I still feel flashy
Ashy to fucking classy, that’s the truth
Cool club, leave this shit [?] in the booth
Saving up, tryna put a hole in the roof
This is my reality, this is not a spoof
Don’t talk about nigga, give proof
I hear em saying

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Bun B]
Man I was born in the 70s, deep down in the dirty
Raised on them red beans and them neck bones, ya heard me?
Last of a dying breed, trying not to be extinct
Posted in the Dew Drop Inn, baby bring me a drink
Silent like a John Deere tractor
Rapper not an actor, and yes I am a motherfucking factor
Tall like the trees in the summer time
You already know if it ain’t trill pimping, it ain’t none of mine
You know I keep these streets hotter than a fish fry
You might be greater later player, not on this try
This round is sewed up, tucked and hemmed
Ask my haters, they say they done had enough of him
Swim through the swamp waters, came home with gator bites
Something like mosquitos, but not as bad as a hater bite
And look at you fuck nigga, you the hater type
Get out my circumference, fore I get in some dumb shit
