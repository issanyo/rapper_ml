[Hook: Various Samples]
They don't know what that star about, they don't know what that barre about
They don't know what that candy car about or smokin that jar about
Texas is the home of the players and pimps
Showing naked ass​ in the great state of Texas
Third coast born, that mean we're Texas raised
Texas motherfucker​ that's where I stay (already)
