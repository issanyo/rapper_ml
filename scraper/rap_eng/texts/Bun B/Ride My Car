[Bun B]
Ready To jock traffic shoppers
Lookin good spendin somebody cheese
_______________
Look like they worth G's / dress above they knee's
????? and g-strings up they back side
Takin' up all that slack right
So tell me where can I find him
With they playas ???? and that candy cadillac right behind em

[Pimp C]
Hooker's tellin' me 'C' you so grand
All she wanna do is ride suburb vans
Put her ass on the leather and rub my wood
See we got boppers in Texas so her body look good
I let the thugs ride and I show her my grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
So when she told me I look good I didn't feel no pride
All she really want to do is just whip my ride

Chorus [Pimp C & Bun B]
Now I stare a playa down when he step to the boy
But they ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
Come on, who the hell you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
They look your partna up and down like he a superstar
But they ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
Come, on who the hell you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin on me they wanna ride in my car

[Bun B]
Oh yeah, they really think they cute
In skin tight cat suits
Assumin' that they body's too boomin' to dispute
But you know it's the root of all drama
And attributes put up in they head by they momma
Oh yeah, Ima tell it like it is
I seen where ya been in
These fools talkin' about how they be passin' around women
But all you do with them is kick it, you ain't wicked cricket
You just doin' a whole lotta trickin'
Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
Man you bought her a drink, all the homegirls up
Ya homeboy's is lookin for ya
But look what you did you left your partnas at the club
And took the bitches to the crib and didn't even hit it
Man you need to quit it, they don't want to hit it
They need to get up out my Shhhhh you know what I mean
I ain't showin' nobody off so they can be seen
You know what I mean

Chorus [Pimp C & Bun B]
Now I stare a playa down when he step to the boy
But they ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
Come on, who the hell you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
They look your partna up and down like he a superstar
But they ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
Come, on who the hell you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin on me they wanna ride in my car


[Pimp C]
When I saw ya at the club
???????????
???????????
Im wearin' dickies, on the average pockets stay fulla change
So I brought her to Deon Sanders club, I guess she chasin the fame
Must be the money cuz it's funny now she lookin' to holla
Well I got twenty thousand worth of link layin on my collar
But I don't bother I'm livin' by the pimp lao
Don't let 'em live in my house, let 'em whip in my car
I couldn't ball what tricks say
I'm sippin ???? you drinkin' cheap ass Alize
You sportin' bapes I'm sportin bali's and wallabees
I'm everything out there that your man tryna be
I'm flippin thangs, everythang, so they ride my thang
They don't love me, they love my name and my big game
So you can kick it
