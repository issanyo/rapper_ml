I'm the piano man niggas know I work the keys
They hit me up I hit their city with some work with ease
They call me Bun but I am nothin like a burger, please
My life is dangerous but nigga it is worth the cheese
We hit the club any given night with 30 g's
In v.i.p tryna give these boppas dirty knees
They dancin sexy than mother fucker twerk and freeze
Bendin over in front of me I just lift they skirt then squeeze
Cause we's the biggest ballers out here you know when it come to poppin bands baby im numero uno
See I pull out a not nigga thats bigger then a sumo
Now these hoes tryna get pregnant from me like they was juno
But who hoe?
See you must got me twisted like a twizzler
I wouldn't let you blow me in the parking lot of sizzler
See I dont even know you hoe but I used to know your sister
But I ain't fuck her either the buck tooth beaver i dissed her
See it's a Mr Swisha full of dro smoker
Im settin up shop like im a real estate broker
And everybody know that B got to keep them racks
Cause he gettin to the money like he work at ?
Shit its a recession im lookin for a bail out
And a jazzy lil boppa in a mini with her tail out
We lettin all the real niggas in and kick the frail out
So call me mr post man im finna take the mail route
Stackin up the bread like im workin down at sun beam
Lookin for a new bitch who need to get on Bun team
You dont need an application just remember one thing
There one life on love so there can only be one King
