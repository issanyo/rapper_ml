[Bun B:]
Remorse
Vengeance
Lost of a loved one
Relative in commander in the game of life, in which one chose to adapt to as a gangsta
Enter my mind
Fill my heart
My emotional pain
Can you feel it?
Naw
Can you feel it?
If you haven't experienced that nature of life, it's gutter

[Chorus: Cobe]
I got this drama
Don't worry mama
'Cause I got the armor
On my back when I
Drive through the streets
Everybody on me
Tryin' to take my life
But I don't give a
What about that
Grip that thing
Cock that back
You don't wanna be, gone
Another goner, gone
In the game, gone
Another Soldier, gone
In a grave, gone
Bendin' corners, gone
Finna bang, gone
Another Soldier, long gone
In the grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave

[Bun B:]
We are the mighty Mddl Fngz
We do not accept hate
Love us or die

[Mddl Fngz:]
Yeah fat boy slow, but a nigga ain't quick
Hoe limped through the door, lay a nigga on his dick
Open up the door, nigga standin' like shit
15 full bricks, same price for a hit
Nigga I done done it, it ain't gotta be a lick
And if I'm plexin' with you partner then the chopper gon' piss
Shootin' up your corner make a sound like "Swish"
But I low so ghat cause the chopper don't miss

[Bun B:]
No the chopper gon' hit
Bound to leave your dome split
Lose your bodily functions
Have me think you gon' shit
Mddl Fngz, strong click
Bun B, the strong spit
Put you 6 feet under
Why not have a long sit
Long walk, short pier
Mane have a long flip
Got the streets on lock
And got the yola on whip
Tell mama we comin' home so don't trip

[Mddl Fngz:]
If I Tee, don't worry 'about me
Mama I'm a G
I know how to handle niggas tryin' to come up on me
Tryin' to run up on me
Thinkin' you gon' try me
Shit in a bag
Drinkin' through a IV
So appreciate your breath
While you got some left
Your life's a bitch
They got permanent PMS
And my only fear of death is reincarnation
So it ain't shit for me to make you niggas ER patients
Another Soldier in the grave

[Chorus: Cobe]
I got this drama
Don't worry mama
'Cause I got the armor
On my back when I
Drive through the streets
Everybody on me
Tryin' to take my life
But I don't give a
What about that
Grip that thing
Cock that back
You don't wanna be, gone
Another goner, gone
In the game, gone
Another Soldier, gone
In a grave, gone
Bendin' corners, gone
Finna bang, gone
Another Soldier, long gone
In the grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave

[B.A.N.D.I.T:]
2 9's 4 clips
Prayin' that you niggas trip
Lookin' for some trouble
Finna bust you niggas bubble
And I don't give a fuck about your happy meal mug
We can go toe to toe or trade these slugs
So catch a square nigga
And I won't budge
Don't plea bargain now, nigga save it for the judge
I might have you niggas lookin' like a strawberry Fanta
Did so much, done burned myself, retire my bandanna
Southwest got them soldiers
Some movin' doja
Some movin' X
But they mostly movin' yola
With guns in the holster
We never leave the toaster
Face could wind up on a rest in peace poster
Rest in peace? No sir
Pissin' on your graveside
Then get real nigga with it & go fuck your wife
So think twice
One for you & your mama life
Band I-T, shoot the soldiers like I shoot the dice

[Bun B:]
For my nigga Bad Ass Bam, I'll open ya head
For Young Lo, I'll let that 44 fill ya with led
For Big Monster, I'll pull out the Thompson & straight squeeze it
Behind Sean Wee I'll cut you off at the knees
For the Band I T, I'll close range ya with the mac
And for K.S.O lot, I'll put the Glock to ya back
Mddl Fnga, this ain't a act
This uncut coke
Don't ever play us for a joke
You'll get yo' bitch ass smoked
We go for broke

[Chorus: Cobe]
I got this drama
Don't worry mama
'Cause I got the armor
On my back when I
Drive through the streets
Everybody on me
Tryin' to take my life
But I don't give a
What about that
Grip that thing
Cock that back
You don't wanna be, gone
Another goner, gone
In the game, gone
Another Soldier, gone
In a grave... [fades out]
