[Introduction: R Kelly and Young Jeezy]
Young Jeezy, yeah, I can believe that, CTE
Who else, nigga, and your boy, Kelly
Okay, yeah, eighty seven to thirty two, what it do
That's right, keep clapping y'all
Kinky, I've got you, homie, let's get it

[Hook: R Kelly and Young Jeezy]
You know we trap all day, play all night
This is the life of a, the life of a go getter
Go getter, go getter, yeah
And in the club you see a bad bitch, point her out
Yeah, you're damn right I'm a, you're damn right I'm a
Go getter, go get getter, go get getter

[Verse One: Young Jeezy]
First I bust a right, then I bust a left
Music's so loud, I almost went deaf
Hit the sweet once and then I hold my breath
Smoke every cigarillo until it ain't none left
Got fifty in the clip, twenty grand in my pocket
Money so big, I don't even need a wallet
Seventy two Impala's same colour as the pills (Woo!)
Red, white and blue; the same colour as the bills (Let's go!)
Here we go again, it's the mothafucking remix
Whole car smoked up, now I can't see shit
Heater on my waste, got the sack in the back
Got the whole Escalade smelling like the pack

[Hook: R Kelly and Young Jeezy]
You know we trap all day, play all night
This is the life of a, the life of a go getter
Go getter, go getter, yeah
And in the club you see a bad bitch, point her out
Yeah, you're damn right I'm a, you're damn right I'm a
Go getter, go get getter, go get getter

[Verse Two: Bun B]
I'm in the triple black convertible GT Bentley
Trill underground king, got the queen right with me
And things right with me and that thing right on me
I'm a one stop shop and a one man army with the F3000 and the F350
Seven send you to heaver for being so shifty
We work up on the triple beam and wait on the four way
I hit the highway, your way's pimping with my yay, there's no way
That anybody that scope you and me holler at the -
These streets have me coding zones these more -
My seven Jizzy James and Pimp C is my friend
So, you can take that to the grave or the bank

[Hook: R Kelly and Young Jeezy]
You know we trap all day, play all night
This is the life of a, the life of a go getter
Go getter, go getter, yeah
And in the club you see a bad bitch, point her out
Yeah, you're damn right I'm a, you're damn right I'm a
Go getter, go get getter, go get getter

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Niggas' is too frail, you either a snake or a new snail
My heart as cold as the new jail, everywhere I go
They're begging me but one wrong decision can destroy your legacy
Lemme see I can break them down and take longer to slow sail
I'm a chill for a minute, sit on them and ho sail them
Business is just fine, none of you folks telling
Shouldn't have it any other way when you're coke selling
I don't know what it is, I guess we were raised different
Blowing haze, standing on the couch, Ros√©'s dripping
Air Forces, hard -, my loaf sweater
D Block, your boy 'Kiss is a go getter

[Hook: R Kelly and Young Jeezy]
You know we trap all day, play all night
This is the life of a, the life of a go getter
Go getter, go getter, yeah
And in the club you see a bad bitch, point her out
Yeah, you're damn right I'm a, you're damn right I'm a
Go getter, go get getter, go get getter
