When I hit the club all the girls show me love
While I'm at the bar, got drank by the jug
In the v.i.p with the chicks and the drugs
Its the T.I.P, Bun-be and Slim Thug

I got drank by the pint
Dro by the pound
Headed to the club in the boss top down
Slim Thug bout to clown represent H-town
If you love me you gon smile
If you hate me you gon frown
Cause me and my bosshoggs bout to ball till we fall
This year,I won't stall, Slim Thugga want it all
Goin solo, first cd out that nots slow-mo
Here's another hit thanks to the drank and they do-do
Fa sho though we got the club shut down
Tryna pick which chick Ima cut now
Got a fetish for thick girls that's caramel brown
On a hunt and uggh guess what I just found
