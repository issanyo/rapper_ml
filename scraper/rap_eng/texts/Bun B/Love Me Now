[Verse 1 - DeLorean]
This one for the rollers
One time for the riders
One time had a nigga parked on them shoulders
Couldn't get nothing shit out us
Sitting on em choppers
20 inch new Brabbus
My bitch look the baddest
My paint look wettest
When I raise my trunk u can read my letters
Ho I'm back like a LoJack
Nigga thought he ran off shit. I knew I was pan out with this shit
Never had a hand out just put my band out
Stay lowkey i didn't wanna stand out
But they Recognize my face. Know my flow
Hear my case everytime I open up all that bass
Htown nigha from around that way. Love me now or leave me lone
Did no wrong. knocked no names. Block no fame
Stole no song
Jack no style salute that crown. He that king I'm just down
If Y'all gone throw stones yall better throw them now

[Hook 2x - DeLorean]
Love me now or leave me lone
Love me now love me now
Love me now or leave me lone
Each's own tell them niggas get they money hell we grown
Just forget it i ain't begging I'mma get it on my own - till im gone

[Verse 2 - Bun B]
Woke up with money on my mind that atm mentality cash up on my cranium my psychic bout that salary
Im burning dro like calories and burning bread like a broken toaster
Burning down that boulevard slab clean as a tesler roadster
Test the best i guess you supposed to
But no I'mma bring that heat like spolestra
While these pussy niggas cheating like sammy sosa
I got doja in the swisher sweet, swisher sweet on the dash
You hear the beat when i pass
And my trunk is knocking beat that ass
From the class of 92 still making it do it what it do
And i did what i did and thats what it does and thats what it is cuase thats what it was
Pass me biz pass me the bud get off my dick and shut da fuck up
This is that texas shit so i gots to wrecks this shit hold up nigga what

[Hook 2x - DeLorean]
Love me now or leave me lone
Love me now love me now
Love me now or leave me lone
Each's own tell them niggas get they money hell we grown
Just forget it i ain't begging I'mma get it on my own - till im gone

[Verse 3 - DeLorean]
This hear for the trophies
Ogs didn't know me
Going live like 4 times
Pay a nigga no mind
Im sitting on a gold mind
Get a whiff of this dope line
Leave a brinks truck broke down
White cup full of cold crime
2 bags of the 09
Big drank nice dank white girls shit da whole nine
Shit bout to go down
Is you going to ride is you gonna fold
Nigga don't lie this shit cold
Ac blowing i don't need no harm im the next nigga going
Let me eat my shit say my grace
Hear my prayers nigga learn my ways
Ain't shit change since the ancient days
I'mma make this pay yall go play
Im so far like san tropez
Dont' leave that cargo where i stay
Yea we started in that basement now we barcode everyday
Aye! undergrond until they burn it down
2 k's on a hundred round
One shot from the south
2 things in the couch
Yall better shut mouth -
Know what im talking about
