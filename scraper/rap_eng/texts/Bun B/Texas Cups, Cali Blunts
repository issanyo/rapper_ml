[Hook]
Out In Texas
Man I Swear To God
I Met This Bad Bitch
Texas Cups & Cali Blunts
I Roll It & Then I Pass It
Let's Do It
Let's Do It, Let's Do It
Let's Do It, Let's Do It, Let's Do It
Let's Do It
Let's Do It, Let's Do It
Let's Do It, Let's Do It

[Verse 1]
It Was 2 A.M. Bumping U.G.K
I Fucks With SPM
I Know There's People Sippin'
On That Purple
Like Its Juice & Gin
I'm Proud To be From Cali
But I Like Your Style
And The Type Of Rims
Windows Tint, Money Spin
I Listen To Screw
And I'm Smokin' To It
Cadillac's And Candy Paint
Swerving Thru 28th & Main
Johnny The Jeweler Got Them Chains
And Put 2 Cups On Every Drank
I Said What Hood He's From?
When She Told Me, Yeah, Kirko Bangz
That's What I Thought
When I Heard That Name
Then I Turnt It Up
When I Heard That Bang

[Bridge]
Houston I Fuck With Houston
She Made Me Love It
She Seduced Me
She's On That New Shit
I'm On That True Shit
I'm Used To Ridin' Low Lows
Gangsta Is My Code
She Was Tippin' On Fo Fo's
We Started Smokin' That Dro

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Posted Up In That H-Town
I Just Got Back From That P-A-T
Where They Grippin' Grain
Grippin' Stains
It Ain't Like You Ain't Bout D-A-T
One Hand Is On That Wood Grain
The Other Hand Is Holdin' That G-A-T
So Pass The Swisher Sweet B-A-T
We Breaking Bread Let's C-A-T
Like E.S.G. We Swang & Bang
Them Cali Boys They Bang & Swang
Bitches Hang Off My Dang A Lang
I Give A Hoe Nightmares Like Dana Dane
And This Ain't A Thang
It's Nothin' G
I Don't Front For You
So Don't Front For Me
I Flex It Hard And You Stuntin' G
Your Wrist Haven For Hoes
Get A Cut To Me
Cuz I'll Take Her
Then I'll Break Her
You Ain't A Mack
You A Muthafucken Faker
She'll Gon' Shake Her, Money Maker
To Give Me Purple & Gold
Like I'm a Laker
Earthquaker
When I Touch Ground
Been Around The World
To Cover Much Ground
Blew Thru Them Euros & Much Pounds
I Gotta Throw My Hands Up
Mayne Touchdown
Now Let's Go
