[Baby]
Now since I live in these motherfucking projects
Polices don't want to see us in cadillacs
I bought a white 1 on gold to match my goals
And I done drive one of my ol' hoes
I got a Lexus and a Benz
Expedition on chrome partner
With 20 inch rims
A hummer and a rose royce
I got a candy helicopter in the lake front nigga
I'm a ball till I fall
Talk shit till I fuck
Ride fly till I die
Imma shake till I break
I'ma bake these cakes and drink alizate
And fuck a different bitch everyday partner
I'ma shop till pop and keep a high price partner
Range and rove, got a mouth full a gold
And I love these hoes
Niggas wearing Rolexes
Spendin 50 or better till coming back from Texas
Bustin' keys in the leather
Got a hummer full of bricks
Cuz I know I'm the shit, you can believe that nigga
Got diamonds and golds so I can blind these hoes
I'ma ball till fall, spend 10 g's at the mall
& have a big ballin party, inviting all y'all
10 G's around my neck, 50 g's on my rolex
100 G's on my Benz, 10 G's on my rims
500 G's laying on the floor
My partner hit the doe give 'em 20 G's off the floe
The old man never seen that much cash before
700 G's stashed away for my son
I done hit a  hard girl and gave her gold cum
Now i'm sittin' on 2 mil-lion just in case I die
Baby name ain't gonna die
Little BCW gonna ball till he die
Now Playboy, tell me how you luv that?

[Mannie Fresh]
I got so many cars I don't know what to do
I got so many hoes I'll give one to you
Lexus laying wit the TV playin, that my CO
Projects swallow me, cuz I'm negro
The cornrolls don't got a hummer man
The broads too I keep the hurricane
Nigga raw street, thats the bubblied Benz
Nigga raw folks, wit the Batman Benz, come on
Put your eyes on this nigga Baby
Papa, I got a diamond ring for you maybe
I slam cadillac bowls me and Baby gram
Out of state hoes wit diamond rings
7 nigga teens
Look at the fuckin karats on your triple beam
How you luv that?
Lexus wit the blue stripe
Can you take that Apollo with the white ass pipes
100's, 1000's, millions, damn
Like from 6 till noon, I buy a whole building man

Bitch we top of the line
Never fuck wit niggas that drop a dime
Thinking we ballin I'll fuck if you mine
Your talks is too high. there's some diamonds bout to be blind
Stop some time, then you can possibly climb
I got Cash Money to prove it
Walking and talking like I'm all cute and
Refreshen and reuse it
With cars you can't purchase
While you strugglin for 2 g's at churches
Nobody searchin, they just find and drop the bitch
Probably looking for the boy, so we can get out this bitch
Now the drink is on us, for the fights no fuck
I'm visiting a whore, hoes only got butts, get naked
And show cunts
I need fucking sucking ass blowing
Now just back up and show us your butt
Blow up when you see us
Go down the beach and get some Reeses
If don't believe it, ask Jesus
Bitch we ballin
