[Hook 1: Eric Rosenthal]
I got a country woman, body like a Chevrolet
She never moving from the same spot in the driveway
My girl gets extra filthy, 'specially when she give me mouth
I ride clean, but love them girls with the dirty souths

[Verse 1: Eric Rosenthal]
I call my lady Mercedes, she's living European
Got an overgrown garden I'd like to plant my tree in
Bushy-tailed, bright-eyed in her double-wide
When it comes to cleaning, she's a brat -- funkdafied
I think I might wife her, though she's not so into grooming
And she stays away from trimming the pitch -- she calls it AutoTuning
Static electricity, when will I ever learn?
Shagging on her shaggy, my Scooby end up with rug burn
Au natural, French model and make
Long hair, don't care; carpet match the drapes
She stays away from razors and she swears she's not a cutter
But I cut her little lady, dirty motherfucker

[Hook 2: Jeff Rosenthal]
I got a country woman, deep-fried and double-wide
No apologies when there's hair in my apple pie
My girl gets extra filthy, 'specially when she give me mouth
I ride clean, but love them girls with the dirty souths

[Verse 2: Jeff Rosenthal]
I didn't know you're Jewish, your curls are real Hasidic
My balls are in the rough, I'm trying to make a divot
She's a freak between her jeans, her pleasure is my pain
It's scrubbing on my dick, as if it had a grease stain
Amber Rose on top, Rick Ross in your bikini bottom
Fabric of my life, the touch, the feel of cotton
Crimp that trim, never trim that hedge
F-f-feed that Ch-Ch-Chiapet between your legs
Some people dread locks, I say put a weave in
Get rid of that bush? That's change I can't believe in
Every time I'm strapping up, I'm heading into combat
Call ASPCA, don't shave that cat

[Hook 3: Bun B]
Got a girl named Camaro; man, she flyer than a sparrow
But she gotta tote her bush around in a wheelbarrow
My girl gets extra filthy, especially when she give me mouth
I ride clean, but love them girls with the dirty souths

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Big Bun B the man, I'm looking for a bopper
With a booty and a bush that need a ch-ch-ch-ch-chopper
A real showstopper when she step out in the place
It's more hair between her legs than I got all on my face
She slim around the waist, and her booty like bam
But if she bust it open, you gon be like, "Goddamn!"
Round of applause? Nah, it's more like the wave
Her pubes make it look like she been living in a cave
But I'm like Dough Beezy, I don't want to cut the skeezy
Just a little jerking and slurping is all it take to please me
Baby, take it easy; your pussy, you can keep it
I just found out Victoria's Secret -- she got a dirty south
