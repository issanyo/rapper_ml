[Verse One: Bun B]
Yeah, it’s that street nigga, always thorough, home on furlough
Respected in the hood, certified in the borough
Walk the block like I own it, if you got it, I want it
And if you want it, I got it, don’t make your boy red dot it
Dropped two hundred on a watch with a hundred begets
Shot the white from half court and hit nothing but net
Drop so hard in Houston, Tex, they felt it up in Tibet
And I put my foot up in your ass if you try to fuck with the set
I rep PA to the fullest and I don’t mean Pennsylvania
It’s pulled all in Texas where motherfuckers’ll stain ya
Like True Blood homie, they gonna fuck it and drain ya
When they find your monkey ass, they won’t be able to name ya, nope
They gonna fuck around and have to call your ass John Doe
Looking like somebody ran you over with a lawn mower
Dirty South don bro, call me Datcher Lando
This rude boy business, pussy clap, boy you don’t know

[Hook]
Aye, we up in the motherfucker man
Came a long way from waiting for the government
Yeah, no more ducking undercover vans
Let me break it down so you people understand
I’m a champion, I’m a, I’m a champion
I’m a champion, I’m a, I’m a champion
I’m a champion, I’m a, I’m a champion
I’m a champion, I’m a, I’m a champion

[Verse Two: XV]
How could it not be uber awesome
When them stores you couldn’t walk in start to look just like your closet
I got models on my furnishings
I probably still got jeans on layaway at Burlington’s
Prefer to swim in my riches like Scrooge McDuck
Girls we couldn’t touch, now we take ‘em to the telly
Ain’t no tellin' what they’ll do to us, in Vegas for a day
Tell your friends come, they ask you what room you want
I just say the big one, penthouse
Big fun, girls out of Penthouse, pin-ups
Kinda like a pawn shop, they know what they gon’ give up
And you be thinking this is just a great look
She be thinkin' I can’t wait to post this up on Facebook
They look high up just to eye us, fly up just to high five us
And buyers makin' me richer like Pryor and all my niggas got priors
So I just keep droppin' fire that all my people require
And I’mma put us all on till we look like a choir

[Verse Three: Donny Goines]
I’mma C-H-A-M-P, skip to the next line, I O N
Blow ‘em all out when I go in, now y’all wanna cue the violins
Be me nigga, try your best, snatch a gold medal since I know best
No type of rest, yeah my flow dead, this right here is quite grotesque
In a micro sec, I’mma write your check
Hopefully your ass can cover it, no Eminem recovering
When I rap on Southern shit bitch, tell your label they can suck a dick
I had to slow it down, down, down just a bit, okay, had enough of that
Ok had enough of that, this is just a jab
Don’t make turn your record to punching bag...
Scream on a HOOOOOOOO like Thundercats, nigga, no bullshit, just the facts
Nigga, my sixteens full of mustard gas
Man, ain’t nobody gon’ fuck with that, Maki cue the music
Donny drew the blueprint, now it’s Albert Hitchcock
Donny flew the coop shit, paint the stadium red, body bruising movement
All my bars sick, Harlem’s new recruitment

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Pill]
It’s a cold world and my old girl say she fucking my partner
I’m just ready to grab this chopper, spray his face like some copper
I been watching for two days, feeling like a set of cheetahs
While I’m counting all this cash, camo shorts and a wife beater
Let me chill, enough of that musher shit, I’m just on my pusher shit
Let them know that I’m for real whenever I got my insta-clip
My nigga, please don’t question if I got the heart to shoot ya
If you look up in my eyes, then I’m stoned, no Medusa
With no fairy tales, very well, I stay around like Ferris wheels
Got your ho skipping on her day, around like Ferris wheels
Buhler, check my mula, guarantee it look so icy
I pop heat and got more pussy than them bitch hoes who be dyking
Please don’t push me, I am Viking, tiger blood, that’s how you see me
And you niggas claim you hard but you softer than linguini
I don’t have to do no flexing, I don’t have a Lamborghini
But I got a bitch named Amber coming out of her bikini

[Hook]
