[Intro: Bun B]
Now when it come to makin' money, I'm a printing press
And when it come to bein' trill, I'm the litmus test
Run it like a fitness test
And when it come to making history, I'm like Joe's son
A million ways to die, you already chose one
A million dollars stacked, it sounds like a new beginning
We on the top now, go back and tell the hood we winning
And while you're there, let 'em know I did it just for them
I made 'em cough the cash up and left 'em just a phlegm
Is that the King of the Trill?
Go tell them "Yes it's him"
And his testosterone is up, who's got the estrogen?
I like your girl and I think she like me even more
I hit her with that heave and ho and then I'm leavin' bro
The Dirty South's finest, and Dirty South's behind us
Now that's a plus on the report card, not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your Linus
You gotta problem with us
You know just the spot to find us

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, since you're tellin' on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around

[Verse 2: Bun B]
They know I'm in a Port Arthur state of mind
Of the superstar status, I elevate the grind
My time is money, so I put some money on my time
Lightning on the Breitling, so exciting when you see the shine
Weâ€™re on the level those before us never even thought of
I broke my bread and fed my team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see it, kept it G, just like I ought to
The only thing that's left for us to do is walk on water
We playin' all four quarters till the clock expire
So till I see the ref wavin', I will not retire
My flow is still official, and I still got the fire
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch The Wire
And in oh-ten, we finna go in
So let the opposition know that there is no win
And I am no friend, so put your hand down
And tell 'em, stand down, before it's man down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Round, I gotta hundred girls in each phone
Drizzy Drake mane, Young Sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losin' track of time, everyday we switchin' zones
Drizzy Hendrix, I'm just backstage gettin' stoned
Thank Me Later man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard nigga, I'm quoted more nigga
Results are in, I guess you shoulda voted more nigga
Swimmin' in the money, y'all just float ashore nigga
Never drownin', what the fuck you think this boat is for nigga
Yeah I'm quick to take a R&B diva out
I bring some friends, she brings some friends that know what we about
And when it's done, I put my slippers on and see 'em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women livin' like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, seek just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, everyday I'm ridin' clean, damn

[Refrain]
Uh, since you're tellin on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Uh, since you're tellin on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
