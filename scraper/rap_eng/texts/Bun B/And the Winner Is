[Verse 1-Saigon:]
[Fades in]... claim many lives with semi.9's - from guys, [crowd ovation]
Innocent ladies, babies of any size. [crowd ovation]
Nah, I knew it wasn't the truth. - Cause they ain't have nothin' for proof!
They even blame you for dozens of youths in substance abuse!
What kinda crap is that?
Everybody know that crackers brought crack to a habitat - to attack the Latins and Blacks
Never mind that fact, son; and I know it's wrong! [crowd ovation]
You was there when my hopeless mom put me out in the coldest storm
Even though you did introduce me to Smoke and Tron
And totin' one, [crowd ovation] - you welcomed Saigon - with open arms!
That's all I could focus on
The reason I wrote this explosive song, - to show [scratches] even the closest born! (look!)
Get torn! (get torn!) [crowd ovation] - You tricked me all alooong
You had me thinkin' you was my friend; you NEVER loved Saigon! (Saigon!)

[Chorus: Saigon]
With friends like you, who needs enemiiees? (enemies...)
Brought a nigga bad luck like the Kennedy's! (Kennedy's...) [crowd ovation]
You had a nigga ASS UP in the penitentiary, [crowd ovation]
With friends like YOU, who needs enemiiees? (WHO?!) [x2]

[Verse 2-Bun B:]
You was my homie! - My ace boon coon, my real roadie. (roadie!)
Called you my right hand, the Poot to my Bodie;
For sho'! - My true whodie! - We was closer than my own kin, (kin!) [crowd ovation]
We saw this thang come and both of us would zone in. (in!)
They knew when they saw you, - they saw your boy, too. [crowd ovation]
Tighter than jail dap, - would always see your boy through. [crowd ovation]
Sunup to sundown, (down!) - winnin' them fistfights
I'm lettin' my gun sound, you was the main one round! (round!)
We held the corner down. (down!) - We held the wall up; (fo' sho'!)
I knew you'd be there so I never had to call up! [crowd ovation]
Step out on the cut, shit! - There you would be
At late night or broad day and didn't care who would see
We was day for day in the trap, (trap!) - and out on the grind, [crowd ovation]
Up to the point where them haters (what?) - ran up from behind! [crowd ovation]
Turn out the whole time, (time!) - that you was straight frontin', (frontin')
Cause when they shot your boy up, - you just laid there and ain't say nothin' (nothin'!)

[Chorus]

[1: 22 minutes instrumental, then beat stops]
