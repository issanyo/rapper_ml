Bridge: Bun B]
Man, hold up, she say she want me back
Headbang this heartbeat and goosebump this track

[Verse 1]
I gave my soul to you
Told everybody, so did you
Truth is
Your loving is so ruthless
Mascara-stains and truces
More lipstick on my bruises
My heart is saying I love you
My brain is saying you dumb as hell
You bet it all, you wanna fail
I testifyed and got thrown in jail, aah
My guard is down, my gates are open
The sun is up, and my shades are broken
You cut me out and your blades are stroking, aahh
I’m faded, girl, you got me faded
Since you left the pain has faded and I miss it and I hate it
And now
She says she want me back
Headbang the heartbeat, goosebump the track, tell me why I

[Hook]
Cut my lips while kissing you
Skin is turning black and blue
It's resisting touching you
Flinch whenever you are near
Legs are locked, I go nowhere
I should leave but do not dare
Feel my heart, it's hardening
And as you strike it yet again
I’m colder
But it’s like I’ve learned nothing
I'm breaking down my own defence
I’m colder

[Verse 2]
You dropped another bomb on me
Asked me how it feel
Said you would go to war for me
But you don’t keep it trill
(Chain gang, homie, staying sane over everything)
There’s nothing no one can tell us
You joke that you jealous, float my boat and revoke the propellers
Coping and hoping is choking as well as
Stroking repell us
I hope they won’t fail us
As I open up broken umbrellas
Now let it rain, let it rain
Pray the water maybe wash away the pain
Howcome there's only good memories in my brain?
Top back screaming money ain't a thing, yeah I need that
Her tender touch keep rippin off my bandages
We’re loving it like savages
But my body can’t take half of this, aah
You love this here, don’t you?
I should be proly gone after what we gone through
But the matter of the fact is that I want you
And now I get a text on my phone where
She says she want me back
Headbang the heartbeat, goosebump the track

[Hook]
