Oh, let me hit that, let me get that party song
Let me turn this place into another motherfuckin' danger zone
Oh, where the good ones? Where the good ones at right now yo?
We gonna talk this shit till we got this bitch rockin' on the rockship, no shit
No hell, no way, I'm gonna chop this rock like blocks of clay
I'm gonna sink your ship so fast, one blast, don't ask, your ass is grass
No red no green, Imma paint this black and crack your spleen
Commin' stright from the dark Imma shark, Imma rip your shit like a slasher scene

[Hook]
Gimmie the record for the brain
Gimmie the fuckin' shit to make the people go insane
Gimmie the fuckin' drug we call the music on this track
Gimmie the fuckin' riff we gonna use to break your back
BRING IT BACK!

Gimmie the record for the brain

Gimmie the fuckin' drug we call the music on this track
Gimmie the fuckin' riff we gonna use to break your back
BRING IT BACK!

Remember all them 90's things, them 90's hits we laced like this
Comin' to you live 2012 and hell there's still not shit like this
We still rain the blood in the club like Slayer flip it up like Limp Bizkit
Tie you up to electric chairs and roast yours guts like nuts on Christmas
Never worry if anybody gonna like me
Don't give a damn if anybody give a fuck
I'm gonna say what I want you can look it up
Wikipedia probably gonna fuck it up
I don't give a damn, cuz its on
Most people never last this long
Most people never find a way but we gonna rock this motherfucker all night long

[Hook]
