Give it up, give it up, give it up (haha)
Give it up, give it up, give it up (woo)
Give it up, give it up, give it up (yo Lethal)
Give it up (give it up!)

Nobody knows what they don't know
So never think you might know me
And that's something to take home tonight
Nobody knows the way the candle burns
And I've learned to play both ends
And that's something to take home tonight

If I tried enough and get high enough
Most grown men don't cry enough
So I'mma, cry myself to sleep gon' cry myself to sleep
If I tried enough and get high enough
Most grown men don't cry enough
So I'mma, cry myself to sleep gon' cry myself to sleep
