Give me some guitars punk...
That's better
Sweet Leth
Limp Bizkit in the house!
What fuckin' house?
Seattle baby
Terry Date, Limp Bizkit, Staind

Bring the noise
Bass! how low can you go?
Death row what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The incredible D. Public Enemy number one
Five-o said freeze! and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X-1
Now they got me in a show 'cuz my records they sell
Cuz a brother like me said well?
Farrakhan's a racist and I think you should listen to
What he can say to you what you oughta do
Follow for now power to the people say
Make the miracle, D. pump the lyrical
United we stand, all in all, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

Turn it up, bring the noise
I said turn it up! bring the noise

Never badder than bad 'cuz the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cuz the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying
Inside music that the critics are all blasting me for
They'll never care for the brother and sisters
Across the country has us up for the war
We got to demostrate, (come on)
They're gonna have to wait ('till we get it right)
Radio stations I question their playlists
They call themselves black
But we'll see if they'll play this

Lets turn it up, bring the noise
I said turn it up! bring the noise

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My DJ is Lethal dose, we call him Leth you know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father or our rock' n' roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin' you call a band man
Makin' a music abuse it but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run DMC first said a DJ could be a band
Stand on it's feet get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LB as well, hell
Records from Fred D still we can rock bells
Ever for ever, Universal it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Turn it up, bring the noise
I said turn it up! bring the noise

Bring that fuckin' noise, and get the fuck up
Get the fuck up
Bring the noise
Get the fuck up
Bring the noise
Fuck this
Limp Bizkit
Fuck this
Man, fuck this
Fuck Staind
In the studio
Fucken Suck ass
Bring that noise
Man fuck this
Terry Date is a fucken pain
Everybody shut up and turn the fucken' tape off
