[Refrain: Rihanna]
I got a house, but I need new furniture
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?
The truth is I will love you the same
But why complain? You buying Gucci, babe

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
You might see me in the spot
Ya boy think I'm hot
So I came up in here to get what you got
I'm hot like the block
Uh-huh, you like that
Know you wanna bite that
Uh-huh, yeah, right there
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick
And I ain't talking movies
If ya young, if ya hot, girl
Shake what ya got, girl
I keep 'em singing

[Chorus: Rihanna & The-Dream]
Lemme get that (huh?)
What you got up in them jeans?
Put it on me, or get lonely
Lemme get that (huh?)
You know, five car garages
Name on your bank account, all day massages
Lemme get that (huh?)
I wanna put it on blast
Lemme get that (huh?)
Better slow down, for I make you crash, boy
Got what you want
Baby got what you need
But we can't proceed
Unless you got that for me

[Refrain: Rihanna]
I got a house, but I need new furniture
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?
The truth is I will love you the same
But why complain? You buying Gucci, babe

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I'ma put you on the spot
Keep the sheet in knots
I bought me a Benz
You buy me the yacht
A girl need a lot
The girl need some stocks
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got (ya get it?)
They love the young girl
They wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick
And I ain't talking movies
If ya young, if ya hot, girl
Shake what ya got, girl
I keep 'em singing...

[Chorus: Rihanna & The-Dream]
Lemme get that (huh?)
What you got up in them jeans?
Put it on me, or get lonely
Lemme get that (huh?)
You know, five car garages
Name on your bank account, all day massages
Lemme get that (huh?)
I wanna put it on blast
Lemme get that (huh?)
Better slow down, for I make you crash, boy
Got what you want
Baby got what you need
But we can't proceed
Unless you got that for me

[Refrain: Rihanna]
I got a house, but I need new furniture
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?
The truth is I will love you the same
But why complain? You buying Gucci, babe

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Ooohh
Boy, I know you want my love, love
Ooohh
Nothing is free in this world, world
Ooohh
Unless my love is your love, your love
Ooohh
I'm not a gold digger

[Chorus: Rihanna & The-Dream]
Lemme get that (huh?)
What you got up in them jeans?
Put it on me, or get lonely
Lemme get that (huh?)
You know, five car garages
Name on your bank account, all day massages
Lemme get that (huh?)
I wanna put it on blast
Lemme get that (huh?)
Better slow down, for I make you crash, boy
Got what you want
Baby got what you need
But we can't proceed
Unless you got that for me

[Refrain: Rihanna]
I got a house, but I need new furniture
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?
The truth is I will love you the same
But why complain? You buying Gucci, babe
