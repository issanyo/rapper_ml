[Verse]
This pain in my stomach won't go away
I assume, this is punishment from all mistakes I've made
In a world where my actions speak louder than words
In a world where my actions speak louder than words

[Chorus]
I know more people than ever before
One lesson I've learned from it all
Fortune and fame are disguised as your friend
'Cause I'm lonelier now than I've ever been

[Verse]
'Cause this pain in my stomach won't go away
I assume this is punishment for all mistakes I've made
In a world where my actions speak louder than words
In a world where my actions speak louder than words

[Chorus]
I know more people than ever before
One lesson I've learned from it all
Fortune and fame are disguised as your friend
'Cause I'm lonelier now than I've ever been
