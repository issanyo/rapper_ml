Looking back in my childhood
Wasn't too bad but it wasn't that great
I carry the luggage like a bag of bricks
Feels like it's holding me down again

Staring down a pitch black road
Painted lines show me the direction
Sun is burning on my face
Sun is setting me on fire

Nobody told me where to go
Nobody told me where to run

I can't find my way back home
Lost my head down there somewhere
Could we just be gone alone
Lived in doubt and fear I've shown

Gazing down a long gray road
I see the stop sign way up ahead
The sun is burning on my face
The sun is setting me on fire

Nobody told me where to go
Nobody told me where to run
Nobody told me where to go
Nobody told me, nobody told me

Same old shit, different day
Gotta get up, gotta get up
Same old shit, different day
Gotta get up, gotta get up
Gotta get up, gotta get up
Gotta get up, gotta get up

I can't find my way back home
Lost my head down there somewhere
Could we just be gone alone
Lived in doubt and fear I've shown

Gazing down a long gray road
I see the stop sign way up ahead
Sun is burning on my face
Sun is setting me on fire

Nobody told me where to go
Nobody told me where to run
Nobody told me where to go
Nobody told me, nobody told me
