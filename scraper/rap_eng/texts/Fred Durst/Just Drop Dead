He apparently just recorded. He had the following to say:
"it's a crazy world we live in, and too many people can't be
Honest. everything happens for a reason. this is raw
Unmixed and straight from the studio. i couldn't help it."

Okay, where the hell you been
Said that you been hangin' with your cute girlfriends
Then I get a call, kinda woke me up
Said they saw you chillin' with this young little fuck
I was kinda dazed, and maybe confused
Never would expected this terrible news
Not only were you kissin' this fool you've been dissin'
You was playin' me out, now you better listen

What the fuck is goin' on
Who the fuck do you think you are (bitch), cause for alarm
Put up with your shit, beggin' me to stay
Even though you ran your fuckin' mouth every day
I ain't some punk ass, dealin' with your drunk ass
Yeah, you might be fine, but you crossed the fuckin' line
Now there's no returnin', this lesson that you're learnin'
Pullin' down them panties will leave your ass burnin'

Cause I deserve more, I deserve more
You act like a whore
So just drop dead
Just drop dead

Rewind, back to the start
When we got together, I gave you my heart
You made a few mistakes, but that's how it goes
And every time I broke up, you gave my ass a rose
Saying that you're sorry and I'm the only one
Believe you like a chump, while you were having fun
I was feeling lonely, while you were with your homey
Ain't that a bitch, now your boy can blow me

What the fuck is goin' on
Who the fuck do you think you are (bitch), cause for alarm
Put up with your shit, beggin' me to stay
Even though you ran your fuckin' mouth every day
I ain't some punk ass, dealin' with your drunk ass
Yeah, you might be fine, but you crossed the fuckin' line
Now there's no returnin', this lesson that you're learnin'
Pullin' down them panties will leave your ass burnin'

Cause I deserve more, I deserve more
You act like a whore
So just drop dead

Cause I deserve more, I deserve more
You act like a whore
So just drop dead

There's love, there's lust
Then blood, and guts
Your touch, my crutch
I trust you way too much

There's love, there's lust
Then blood, and guts
Your touch, my crutch
I trust you way too much!

You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
You think this is a fuckin' tennis match (bitch!), time for me to serv
Im John McEnroe, ready for me hoe
It's fifteen love, where the fuck you gonna go (huh)
Where the fuck you gonna go (huh)
Where the fuck you gonna go

What the fuck is goin' on
Who the fuck do you think you are (bitch!), cause for alarm
Put up with your shit, beggin' me to stay
Even though you ran your fuckin' mouth every day
I ain't some punk ass, dealin' with your drunk ass
Yeah, you might be fine, but you crossed the fuckin' line
Now there's no returnin', this lesson that you're learnin'
Pullin' down them panties will leave your ass burnin'

Cause I deserve more, I deserve more
You act like a whore
So just drop dead

Cause I deserve more, I deserve more
You act like a whore
So just drop dead
Just drop dead
