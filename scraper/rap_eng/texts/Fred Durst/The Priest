[Intro]
It could be the absinthe talking
I don't think so, I don't either
I've got to find a new place, a new place to feed
Gotta be

[Post-Chorus]
Stop everything, something is not feeling right
The planets are not all aligned
I know it, I've felt this before
My evil is thirsting for more
I need a new outlet to feed

[Verse 2]
What can I do?
I've got an idea, I think I'll just become a priest
Deceiving them with my belief
I'll preach about what life is worth
And cover my sins with the church
My demons can run around free
No one will suspect a thing
I'll show them it's okay to lust
A priest is who children can trust
I've found a new outlet to feed

[Chorus]
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections

[Post-Chorus]
Something's not right
The planets are not all aligned
I know it, I've felt this before
My evil is thirsting for more
I need a new outlet to feed

[Verse 3]
What can I do?
I've got an idea; I think I'll just become a priest
Deceiving them with my belief
I'll preach about what life is worth
And cover my sins with the church
My demons can run around free
No one will suspect a thing
I'll show them it's okay to lust
A priest is who children can trust
I've found a new outlet to feed

[Chorus]
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections

[Bridge]
Oh my God
I'm watching TV, but I can't
Oh, what's this world coming to?
I see a priest molesting children
I see terrorists blowing up buildings
I see someone in rage, killing Dimebag on stage
What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this?
I got a kid
Should I send him to Sunday School?
I got a kid
Should I send him to Sunday School
So you can fuck him?
Oh no, no, you ain't gonna fuck him
How 'bout this?
I don't fucking know who I can trust
In this world, and I'm gonna blow
One time, I'm not that scared

[Pre-Chorus]
Something is not feeling right
The planets are not all aligned
I know it, I've felt this before
My evil is thirsting for more
I need a new outlet to feed

[Chorus]
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections
Baptized by the unexpected
Terrorized by the imperfections
