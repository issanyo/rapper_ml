[Verse 1]
Build a bridge to your mind
Takes me there every time
Lay it all on the line
There's a way
Build a bridge, make a path
Overlook the aftermath
Make my tears be your bath
There's a way

[Pre-Chorus]
Only if you take a ride
Go with me to the other side

[Chorus]
Even though it's gonna crumble down (gonna crumble down)
I'll keep buildin' 'til you come around ('til you come around)
Even though it's gonna fall apart and break my heart (break my heart)
I'll keep buildin' 'til I die

[Verse 3]
Build a bridge of memories
Stretch it out over seas
To the end of the world
If there's a way
Build a bridge made of pain
Send my longin' down the drain
Have no reasons to complain
There's a way

[Pre-Chorus]
Only if you take a ride
Go with me to the other side

[Chorus]
Even though it's gonna crumble down (gonna crumble down)
I'll keep buildin' 'til you come around ('til you come around)
Even though it's gonna fall apart and break my heart (break my heart)
I'll keep buildin' 'til I die

[Bridge]
Wait, wait for me
Wait, please wait for me
Wait, wait for me
Wait, please wait for me, yeah

[Chorus]
Even though it's gonna crumble down (gonna crumble down)
I'll keep buildin' 'til you come around ('til you come around)
Even though it's gonna fall apart and break my heart
I'll keep buildin' 'til I die
Even though it's gonna crumble down (gonna crumble down)
I'll keep buildin' 'til you come around ('til you come around)
Even though it's gonna fall apart and break my heart
I'll keep buildin' 'til I die
