Go!

I stare into space and hope we are not alone
I am searching for something that is better than home
I've been working so hard
Stress is tremendous and pressure is endless
No one on this planet like me to be friend's with
I've been working so hard x2

I'm underneath the sun
I'm underneath the gun

I'm losing my mind and I know there's no remedy
Think I'm a failure who's livin' on memories
I've been working so hard
Loneliness can't be cured from no medicine
Look to the stars so they'll straighten my head again
I've been working so hard x2

I'm underneath the sun
I'm underneath the gun
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame and run away
X2

Sometimes I beat up myself
I block my own way
I cloud all my thoughts, please go away
Oh nevermind please, I'm checking out now
Won't ever come back, now that my life doesn't exist

Yeah, you're right - how does it feel to be right?
Knowing that I was wrong - nothing is right when you're wrong
X2

I'm underneath the sun
I'm underneath the gun
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame and run away
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame...
