I guess I'm a dreamer
My heart is gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Didn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel left all alone
Take me to your... heart
Feel me in your.... bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road...

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

I guess that I seem
To make romantic dreams
Up in lights
Fallin' off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing... keeps me
Together at the seams
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home...

It's a bittersweet
Symphony
This life
Just tryin' to make ends meet
You're a slave to the money
Then you die
There's no change...
I can't change
I can't change
I can't change
But I'm here in my mind
I'm here in my mind
I'm a million different people from one
Day to the next
I can't change
My mind
No, no, no

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home...
