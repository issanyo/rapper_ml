[Verse 1]
I ain't no joke, so you should get a pen
And write yourself a little note so you don't forget again
That when it comes to cash, I've been gettin' smoked
Lendin' out my money, now I'm broke
Somebody's gettin' choked, 'cause now it's time to pay the piper
Bums are the type of shit that's in a diaper
Don't make me have to call a sniper
And wipe your brains off my windshield wiper
You dirty bug, as soon as I get paid they come in masses
There's someone givin' classes on kissin' people's asses
Unless you're livin' where the trash is
Don't even come around here askin' where my cash is

[Chorus 1]
Me? I'm broke!
Me? I'm broke!

[Verse 2]
I ain't no joke, I'll say it once again
And if I get provoked, there'll be knuckles on your chin
Some people never learn â€“ borrowin' from me? You might regret it
For one, I ain't no bank and you got shitty credit
As soon as I get paid, they're comin' out the woodwork
Take your ass and get a job, like you should, jerk!
Unless you're livin' where the trash is
But you're not, so find another spot where the cash is

[Chorus 1]
Me?I'm broke!
Me? I'm broke!

[Bridge 1]
Give me back my money, you bum
You said you'd pay me back
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smackin' for slackin'
Now people say that I'm a slacker
If I'm a slacker, it's through the eyes of the ones that are blind

[Chorus 2]
You said you'd pay me back
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smackin' for slackin'
Now people say that I'm a slacker
If I'm a slacker, it's through the eyes of the ones that are blind
You said you'd pay me back
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smackin' for slackin'
Now people say that I'm a slacker
If I'm a slacker, it's through the eyes of the ones that are blind

[Bridge 2]
Give me back my money, my money, my money
(It's always been like that)

[Chorus 2]
You said you'd pay me back
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smackin' for slackin'
Now people say that I'm a slacker
If I'm a slacker, it's through the eyes of the ones that are blind
You said you'd pay me back
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smackin' for slackin'
Now people say that I'm a slacker
If I'm a slacker, it's through the eyes of the ones that are blind
