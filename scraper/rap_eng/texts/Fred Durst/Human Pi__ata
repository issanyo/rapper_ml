Directions say assembly required
Nothing's admired the majority's been
Hired, wired, the truth the roof is on fire
A life all I desire
Paychecks, respect disappears quickly
Situation tense trickly
Hand jobs, yes they have plenty
Backs cracked for copper pennies
Migraines, wrist sprains
Free samples of rogaine, fill me with anything
Regaining ground while the well endowed
Sit proud with their head in the clouds
Prophets predicted it
Inscribed on the minds of the ancient tribes
Mother nature striking back

Come suffer with me
(man can only rape his mother for so long)

What will you do the chosen few?
With your reebok shoes and your missing clues
Pretend it will all go away?
Oxygen levels growing thin
The opposite of birth unfolds within
Must prepare and be aware existence of man will disappear
No tunnel harps, angels to follow
Every man, women, child swallowed
No eight o' clock alarm tomorrow
Man returns the earth he borrowed
And while the meek obey to repeat defeat
(mother nature releases)

Come suffer with me
(man can only rape his mother for so long)

One nine nine nine (what yeah)
Gotta get a grip on come on
What's this fuckin' world coming to?
Run for shelter, helter skelter
It's too bad, before too long there'll be no songs
No break of dawn, it'll all be gone cuz mrs. mother nature
She grow to hate ya
It's the apocalypse kid
A little karma for all that you did
You want to know where we're headin'
Armageddon

Come suffer with me
(man can only rape his mother for so long)
(will time erase the human race)
