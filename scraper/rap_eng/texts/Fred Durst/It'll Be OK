[Verse 1]
I just read your letter, it says that you'll be gone for a while
Everything was getting better, I guess I'm just a fool strung out
What to do, my life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you
I wonder just how sympathetic you'll be
You've come to take me under and I've forgotten all about me

[Hook]
What to do, my life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you
So tell me why you say goodbye
And tell me why you're fucking up my whole life
Yeah, fucking up my whole life?
So I'm on my way, I leave today
If I get away, it'll be okay
It'll be okay

[Verse 2]
I'm looking out a window into a world that's taken you from me
And I'm feeling so disgusted, how pathetic can I possibly be?
What to do?

[Hook]
What to do, my life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you
So tell me why you say goodbye
And tell me why you're fucking up my whole life
Yeah, fucking up my whole life?
So I'm on my way, I leave today
If I get away, it'll be okay
It'll be okay

[Bridge]
If there's a better place you can take me
A better life you give me
Whatever place I can start all over
Then I would never need what you gave me
And never need you to save me
And never feel like this life is over
If there's a better place you can take me
A better life you give me
Whatever place I can start all over
Then I would never need what you gave me
And never need you to save me
And never feel like this life is over

[Hook]
So I'm on my way, I leave today
If I get away, it'll be okay
It'll be okay
