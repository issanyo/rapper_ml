What goes around comes around
What goes around comes around

What goes around comes around
You better realize
You kill life, you kill life
Why? Why?

I see your eyes, I see your lies
I see you hide, inside...

What goes around comes around
Now it's your time

How long can you lie?
How long can you hide?
How long can you live with your soulbleed?
How long can you live with your soul...

Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed

What goes around comes around
No more lies
You kill life, you kill life
Why? Why?

I see a mother cry
I see a brother cry

What goes around comes around
Now it's your time

How long can you lie?
How long can you hide?
How long can you live with your soulbleed?
How long can you live with your soul...

Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed

Bring it on
Bring it

Bleed

I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now
I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now!
Bleed!
I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now!
Bleed!
I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now!
Bleed!

Motherfucker

I got my pride and that's all I need
I'll make you bleed with another blow without the radio
Don't take advantage of this process
You might have to digest a blade made for your ass to fade
I'm living on instinct
Never think when I'm rushin', bones crushin'
When I put your sorry ass in a package
You piece of shit, sealed and delivered from a savage
And now you sweat because you're goi'n down
You envious clown, fuckin' bleed

Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed

Oh, shit!
