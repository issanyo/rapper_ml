The end is near
My summer days
All great things go away
Feel the cold comin' round the bend
Everything's gonna change again

Down another day
Down another day

Oh the winter i adore
Summers gone forever more
Someday she'll come back to me
Season's change to set me free

Down another day
Down another day

(chorus)
Don't have to bore you with details
(i'll never let you down)
And in the morning the sunrise
(will never let you down)
If i could hold you tomorrow
(i'll never let you down)
And when she's golden, the ocean
(will never let you down)

The end is near, my winter fling
Change is melting everything
Now it's time to sink below
Season come , season go

Down another day
Down another day

(chorus)

I keep saying goodbye
Saying goodbye
Keep saying goodbye

She's always coming back
She keeps coming back
She keeps coming back

I keep saying goodbye
Saying goodbye
Keep saying goodbye

She's always coming back
She keeps coming back
You keep coming back

(chorus)

Down another day
Down another day
(will never let you down)
Down another day
Down another day....
