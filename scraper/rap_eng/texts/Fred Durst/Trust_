[Intro]
Backstabbers
Two-faced
Low lifes
It's time to step up to the plate
A one, two
A one, two
A one, two
What the fuck you gonna do?

[Verse 1]
You know I see right through you
You act like you don't know me
You lie, you cheat, you steal, you lose
Wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
Always looking over your shoulder
For the ones you stick, you sick little prick
It looks like your time's running out
Creeping up your back, so what you all about?

[Chorus]
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!

[Verse 2]
You're the kind of guy with two faces
Just another life that's wasted
Here's a little fact, you do me like that
End up in the back of my trunk in a sack
You'd better keep your hands off
What's mine or anybody else's
When you're selfish, your wealth is
All you crave from the cradle to the grave

[Chorus]
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!

[Verse 3]
I got a little bitty question
Just what the fuck are you thinking?
You think you're all that and then some?
Well you're not
I think you're dum ditty dum, I take it back
Those thoughts are kinda whack
Don't really need that kind of karma on the track
Maybe Freddy Krueger will step into your dream and
Burn you like a demon and leave your ass screaming
To be exact I wanted to react, mission of attack
Your head was getting cracked
But you're a human being that's lucky to be breathing
And that's that, that's that

[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody
And nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way its gonna be
I don't trust nobody
'Cause nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way its gonna be
I don't trust nobody
'Cause nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way its gonna be
I don't trust nobody
'Cause nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way its gonna be

[Chorus]
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!
