[Intro]
Alright partner, keep on rollin' baby
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (chocolate Starfish)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (what)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (keep on rollin' baby)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Hook]
Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (what)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (come on)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (yeah)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Verse 1]
Now I know y'all be lovin' this shit right here
L.i.m.p, Bizkit is right here
People in the house put them hands in the air
Cause if you don't care, then we don't care
1, 2, 3 times two to the six
Chosen for your fix of that Limp Bizkit mix
So where the fuck you at punk
Shut the fuck up and back the fuck up
While we fuck this track up

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2]
You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit?
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit
Because we get it on everyday and every night
And this platinum thing right here, yo we're doin' it all the time
So you better get some beats and a get some better rhymes
We got the gang set so don't complain yet
Twenty four seven never beggin' for a rain check
Old school soldiers blastin' out the hot shit
That rock shit, puttin' bounce in the mosh pit

[Bridge + Hook]

[Bridge]
Hey ladies, hey fellas and the people that don't give a fuck
All the lovers, all the haters
And all the people that call themselves players
Hot mamas, pimp daddies
And the people rollin' up in caddies
Hey rockers, hip hoppers and everybody all around the world

[Hook] x2
