[Verse]
Special (check my melody, my melody)
You think you're special, you do
I can see it in your eyes, I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me and walk around on me

[Chorus]
Just one more fight about your leadership
And I will straight up leave your shit
'Cause I've had enough of this
And now I'm pissed, yeah!

[Hook]
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

[Bridge]
Check out, check, check out, check, check, check

Check, check out, check, check out, check, check out, check, check
Check out out my melody

[Chorus]
Just one more fight about a lot of things
And I will give up everything
To be on my own again
Free again, yeah!

[Hook]
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

[Post-Hook]
Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go
Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go

[Chorus]
Just one more fight and I'll be history
Yes, I will straight up leave your shit
And you'll be the one who's left
Missing me, yeah!

[Hook]
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

[Post-Hook]
Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go
Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
