[Verse]
I came into the world as a reject
Look into these eyes
Then you'll see the size of these flames
Dwellin' on the past (past)
Burnin up my brain (hot)
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day
My girlie ran away with my pay
When fellas come to play
Now she's stuck with my homies that she fucked
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat

Like a chump, hey
Like a chump, hey
Like a chump, hey

I did it all for the nookie, c'mon
The nookie, c'mon
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your.. yeah!
Stick it up your.. yeah!
Stick it up your.. yeah!

(Gimme something to break)

It's just one of those days
When ya don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why
But you wanna justify
And if you're stuck up you just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin shit slip
Or you'll be leavin the station with a fat lip
I think you better quit talkin' that shit
So come and get it

[Spoken]
I feel like shit, huh
My suggestion is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous, we've all felt like shit, and been treated like shit
Right, ladies and gentlemen?
All those motherfuckers, they wanna step up
I hope ya know I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw, and if my day keeps going this way
I just might break your fucking face tonight

Limp Bizkit choo choo
Won't you take me home?
