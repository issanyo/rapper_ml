[Verse 1]
Why is everybody always picking on me?
Does anybody really know a thing about me?
One of these days we'll be in the same place
In the same place punk, at the very same time
And when it takes place and you wanna talk shit
Then step your ass up and say it right to my face

[Hook]
You'll get knocked the fuck out
Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash
Knocked straight the fuck out
Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash

[Verse 2]
I ain't believing all the shit you been talking 'bout me
Don't even know me and still you're talking shit about me
One of these days I'm gonna catch you in the act
In the act, red handed, caught up in the act, punk
And that'll be the day, the one and only day
Then step your ass up and say it right to my face

[Hook]

[Bridge] x2
So where you at, where you been?
I'm sure I'll be seeing you again, cause this world is really small
Can we all get along, can we all get along?

[Bridge]
I'm upset at the people who verbally rape us
We're talking, we try to ignore them
Ignore them until they keep talking
They think that they're building an empire
Without us we've got the torch now
We've got the fire to burn this motherfucker down, town, town
We've got the fire to burn this motherfucker down, town, town
Burn this motherfucker now, down, down
Burn this motherfucker now, down, down
Burn this motherfucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
Motherfucker
Just shut your fuckin' mouth!
Bring it on Lethal
Come on
