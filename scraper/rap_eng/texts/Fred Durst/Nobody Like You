[Verse 1: Fred Durst & Jonathan Davis]
I'm convinced that you hate (that you hate), you hate me
You like (you like), you like to see my cry
It's already a proven fact
That you hate and you wait on me to die
It's so scary, I find it hard to confine
I will make you see it my way
You give, I take
You say, you want to be away from me

[Chorus: Fred Durst & Scott Weiland]
You bring me!
I've got the reason and I don't wanna let go
Take me down!
I've got the reason and I want to know

[Verse 2: Fred Durst & Jonathan Davis]
I'm convinced that you (fucked me) real good
You did (you did), but I won't let it go
I got my reasons and I'm not leavin'
So I'll wait on you to die
Please take this time for me to be unforgiven
I give my life to you
I lay my life on a line for you
For you, for you, for you

[Chorus: Fred Durst & Scott Weiland]
You bring me!
I've got the reason and I don't wanna let go
Take me down!
I've got the reason and I want to know

[Bridge: Jonathan Davis & Fred Durst]
I got (got no)
No reason
I got (got no)
No reason!

[Breakdown: Everyone]
Got no reason, no!
Got no reason
I've got the reason (no reason) and I don't wanna let go
No reason
I got no reason
No fuckin' reason
No reason
I won't let go

[Chorus: Fred Durst & Scott Weiland]
You bring me!
I've got the reason and I don't wanna let go
Take me down!
I've got the reason and I want to know

[Outro: Jonathan Davis & Scott Weiland]
Go!
Got no reason
No fuckin' reason
Go!
Got no reason (fuck you)
No reason!
Go!
I got no reason
No reason!
Go!
I got no reason!
