Just go away

All the sounds around you used to
Play along with your torn up head
As the music seeps into you
Everyone was trampled dead

Everyone could feel your madness
Slip in till it takes control
Everyone could see right through you
I wish you would just

Go away (go)
Go away

Go away from all the pain that made you
Half as good as God
Taken all over in my brain
I recall the future
Take another star
Make him feel the pain

All the sounds around you used to
Play along with your torn up head
As the music seeps into you
Everyone was trampled dead

Everyone could feel your madness
Slip in till it takes control
Everyone could see right through you
I wish you would just

Go away (go)
Go away

Go away from all the pain that made you
Half as good as god
Taken all over in my brain
I recall the future
Take another star
Make him feel the pain

For every song you ever wrote take another fucking drink
For every melody that haunts take a pill that makes you faint
For every part of you that hurts take a needle, make it sting
The irony is I'm just like you, a pseudo-fucking freak

Go away (go)
Go away
