You're the cure
You're my animosity
You're the cure
You're my date with jealousy
I could be wrong
I could be right
I play along
Avoid a fight

SHOT
SHOT
You're the sun
You're the light that burns my eyes
You're the sun
You're the darkness I despise
I could be wrong
I could be rite
I play along
Avoid a fight
You've fucked me up in the head
But its alright
Now your hero is dead
And I'm alright

SHOT
You're the angel in everybody's dreams
You're the angel that doesn't honor wings
I could be wrong
I could be right
I play along
Avoid a fight
You've fucked me up in the head
But its alright
Now your hero is dead
And I'm alright
Give it up
Run away
Make it last
Make it stay
Never hide
Never know
You don't want me to go
Everyday
I don't know
I don't care
Take it slow
From the mist
From a lie
You don't want me to go

I could be wrong
I could be right
I play along
Avoid a fight

You've fucked me up in the head
But its alright
Now your hero is dead
And I'm alright (x2)
