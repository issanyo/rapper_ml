[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Tell 'em how to sell it
It's propaganda

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me how to keep my composure
It ain't over till I get me some closure
Wanted dead or alive is my profile
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace
Severely a mental disorder
Where reality is highly distorted
Psychosis - weaken the mind
Incline to small doses as we approach this
Ever endless quest for a vengeance
While those who expose and pretend this
Life is just a big bowl of cherries
A bunch of fairies screaming to be scary

[Chorus]
It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again

[Verse 2]
I'm a maniac, a hard one to handle
You better come packing more than a scandal
Fucked over for the times I've been grateful
Fucked over led to times I've been hateful
Main attraction, fuck you in your pussy mouth
Cum again, friend, now we got some action
On and on is the name that they gave me
And your misery came here to save me

[Chorus]
It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again
It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Fuck yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again

[Post-Chorus]
Mommy
Fuck it

[Bridge]
Who is phony and fading slowly?
You don't owe me, but I made you
Who is phony and fading slowly?
You don't owe me, but I made you
Who is phony and fading slowly?
You don't owe me, but I made you
Who is phony and fading slowly?
You don't owe me, but I made you
Who is phony and fading slowly?
You don't owe me, but I made you
Who is phony and fading slowly?
You don't owe me, but I made you
I made you
I made you

[Outro]
Who is phony and fading slowly?
You don't owe me, but I made you
Who is phony and fading slowly?
You don't owe me, but I made you
I made you
I made you
I made you
Yeah, I made you
