[Intro]
Flobber Fairy, you know we've figured you out
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a fake

[Verse 1]
Hey man, wake up and smell the concrete
Strange to see you've changed, like the LB
Could be identity crisis, but I can't buy this
Reality bites but that's what life is
Pitiful you, your hideous behavior
Hate what God gave ya, fakin' all the flavor
Artificial minds seekin' out the new trends
Get in where you fit in
Quit thinkin' like a has-been diggin' in my culture
I'ma let me let your punks know I'm an old school soldier
With the funk flow, a damn shame wanna change yourself
Because you're sick of yourself

[Chorus]
Well I'm sick of you too, fake!
You're a counterfeit, fake!
You know we figured you out
Well I'm sick of you too, fake!
You're a counterfeit, fake!

[Verse 2]
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what it's like to be a clone
Doin' nothin', nothin' on my own
Alone in your misery, you're bitin' on my new style
Filed as a counterfeit goin' down in history as nothin' but a copy cat
So if you're fakin' that, you're phat and need a ballbat
Right where your head is at
All your desperation causes separation
Now I grab the mic to intimidate
Your weakness screams from the limp on your siren
Phonies get the hint quick smacked with the funk-flick
Pain for the fakers fame can't maintain
Because you're sick of yourself

[Chorus]
Well I'm sick of you too, fake!
You're a counterfeit, fake!
You know we figured you out
Well I'm sick of you too, fake!
You're a counterfeit, fake!
All these phonies...

[Verse 3]
You disregarded your life
You disrespected your friends
You've even stolen your appearance
From hangin' around with my family
But I should have never dropped my guard
So you could stab me in the back
But you were freakin' me out
Just freakin' me out, you wear a mask

[Interlude]
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit

[Bridge]
Now you're steadily startin' to change
You wanna re-arrange your lifestyle, live like the wild child
With the vibe alive you could lie to try and be so fly
A lie but you deny you're a fake!

[Outro]
You're a phony, you know we figured you out, fake!
You know we figured you out, figured you out, figured you out!
Fake! Fake! Fake!
Fake! Fake! Fake!
Fake!
