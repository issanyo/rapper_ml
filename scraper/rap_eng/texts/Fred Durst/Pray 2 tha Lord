Pray 2 Tha Lordd (aka Pray 2 tha Lawd)

[end of Christian girl’s rap from previous track...]

[Intro: Twirli]
....yeah yo I feel you on that tho, girl
So we basically just gotta do the opposite of everything that you just said
So we’s about to be doing that
So now you up in the studio with Twirli, J-Rizz, Mcticky, and Yo we got Trinnnn!

[Trin]
HIT ME UP ON TRINSPAYCE!!!!

[Hook: Dewey & Twirli]
I pray 2 tha Lord I can touch yo body
Make no mistake, Girl
You is Eve and I’m tha Snake
Have a taste—
Now put my apple in your faace!

[Verse 1: Dewey Logz]
Close your eyes
Visualize
This skinny guy between your thighs
Does it sounds appealing, Girl?
Tell me how you feeling
You can call me Jesús because I give your life meaning
Put the Holy Ghost all up in your nether-regions

[Verse 2: Twirli]
Fuck you
That’s what I wanna do
Hung like a inner-tube
From a monster truck
That’s why I wanna Fuck you
‘Cuz it’s good for us both!
Mitigate overpopulation by concluding in your throat

[Verse 3: Dew]
The girlies all call me Hepatitis-B-eeean
Lick your dirty plate til that shit gets cle-eean
I’m only in this Rap Shit for the phat slit
Booty-lickin’ and deep-dickin’
Keep hittin’ bat-shit crazy broads
They go Ape when they take Dewey Large’s Lincoln Logg
Tinker with your toy like a little schoolboy
Get you razzed like the berry when I pop ya cherry
Turn you from the Virgin Mary into something kinda scary

[Verse 4: Twirli]
BOO!
You know I got you!
What you gonn’ do, when the reaper cummin’ you?
You gonna be reborn
That’s how it works
If you believe in fairy tales about time-traveling snails
Or whatever the Bible is actually about..
Add TRIN on TRINBOOK!!

[Dewey]
(now defunct rapsponsor-tisement)

[Fred Durst]
“CHECK MY FRENZ TONITE!!!”

[Hook: LB4D]
I pray 2 tha Lord I can touch yo body
Make no mistake, Girl
You is Eve and I’m tha Snake
Have a taste—
Now put my apple in your faace! (face, face, face.....)
