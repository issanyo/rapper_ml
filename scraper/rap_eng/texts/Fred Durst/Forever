You don't know what you got until it's gone
And you don't know what you lost until it's gone
Until someone you know goes away and dies
They're gone forever...

Every second you're alive is a countdown
Every second you're alive is a countdown
My life, your life, his life, their life, it's so temporary

You don't know what you got until it's gone
And you don't know what you lost until it's gone
Until someone you know goes away and dies
They're gone forever...
