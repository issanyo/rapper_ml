[Verse 1]
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like to be hated
To be fated to telling only lies

[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

[Verse 2]
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through

[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

[Bridge]
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover

[Verse 3]
No one knows what it's like to be mistreated
To be defeated behind blue eyes
No one know how to say that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not tellin' lies

[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

[Outro]
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
