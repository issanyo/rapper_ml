[Intro: Fred Durst]
Shit, one, one, two

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
I came into this world as a reject
Look into these eyes, then you'll see the size of the flames (size of 'em!)
Dwellin' on the past, (past!) it's burnin' on my brain (hot!)
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day (days!)
My girlie ran away with my pay when fellas came to (play!) play
Now she's stuck with my homies that she fucked (ooh!)
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat, hey

[Bridge: Fred Durst]
Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) like a chump
(Hey!) like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) like a chump
(Hey!) like a chump
(Hey!)

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Should I be feelin' bad? (no!) Should I be feelin' good? (no!)
It's kinda sad, I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on (move it!)
But I'm a sucker, like I said – fucked up in the head, not!
And maybe she just made a mistake and I should give her a break
My heart'll ache either way
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?
I won't lie, that I can't deny

[Chrous]
I did it all for the nookie (come on!)
The nookie (come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your…
I did it all for the nookie (come on!)
The nookie (come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your…

[Verse 3: Fred Durst & Wes Borland]
Why did it take so long?
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived (but you were!)
By my so-called girl, but in reality
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender, heart in a blender
And still I surrendered, hey

[Bridge: Fred Durst]
Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) like a chump
(Hey!) like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) like a chump
(Hey!) like a chump

[Chorus: Fred Durst]
I did it all for the nookie (come on!)
The nookie (come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your
I did it all for the nookie (come on!)
The nookie (come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your

[Interlude: Fred Durst]
I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice
They'll tell you, "Just let it go!"
It's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
And nothing gonna change
You can go away
I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same
And nothing gonna change
'Cause you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same
And nothing gonna change
'Cause you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same

[Chorus: Fred Durst]
I did it all for the nookie (come on!)
The nookie (come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your
I did it all for the nookie (come on!)
The nookie (come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your (yeah!)
Stick it up your…
