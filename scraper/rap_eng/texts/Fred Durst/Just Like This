[Intro]
Get up
Get up
Like this
Just like this
Do you feel it?
Then get up
Just like this

[Verse 1]
Do you wanna catch the vibe that's keeping me alive?
Following these fat ass beats until I die
Fill 'em with tension, the sick dimension
Rumble the earth with my lowered suspension
Just watch the ground move, let the sound prove
That it ain't fake when the girls get naked
Don't call it a comeback, we bring that beat back
And we made sure that John kept them beats fat
A lyrical rampage, burning your headset
Open your mind, my rhymes ain't dead yet
I want you to stand up, put them hands up
I'll break it on down 'cause you're pumping my band up
Like this
Just like this
Come on
Get up
Get up

[Chorus]
Music is key, it's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwing at me!

[Verse 2]
The rhythm's so insane, it's flowing through your vein
Triggering the neck popping nerve up in your brain
I don't even know you, but came to show you
The Bizkit's limp when the night is over
We shake the whole place, make this earthquake
And it ain't fake when we start the riots
Rock the bells, psycho females
Doing time, blowing up the phoneline
Call it a stampede, coming to your town
We ain't gonna hold back, we're coming to get down
I want you to stand up, put them hands up
And break it on down 'cause you're pumping my band up
Like this
Just like this
Get higher
Come on
Get up
Get up

[Chorus]
Music is key, it's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwing at me
And I'll do what it takes if I make some mistakes
It's okay 'cause it's all just the way it should be

[Bridge]
Limp Bizkit's in the house y'all
Limp Bizkit's in the house y'all
Limp Bizkit's in the house y'all
Yo John, bring that beat back
Just like this
Do you feel it?
Just like this
Yo bring that beat back

[Chorus]
Music is key, it's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwing at me
And I'll do what it takes if I make some mistakes
It's okay 'cause it's all just the way it should be
