[Intro: Xzibit]
Yes, millenium shit
Limp Bizkit, ha, X to the Z, yeah, ha
Bringin' it live to you and yours
Ladies and gentlemen, ha, ha, ha
My homeboy, yo, get at 'em, dawg

[Hook: Fred Durst & (Xzibit)]
You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little somethin'-somethin' didn't go your way (yeah)
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way (come on!)
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck, if you're evadin' the space
So getcha-getcha groove on (gotta getcha groove on)
Don't keep us waitin' too long (don't keep us waitin' too long)

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Don't you treat me like a toy kid, do you enjoy this?
Every single second I'm alive, I'm a mess (yeah)
Got these laser-beam mic checks
Communicatin' through the Genelec
High-tech, keep you on the run now
Don't wanna be that guy, every single second I'm alive
I'm alive, I don't understand why
I got control, full of candy in your soul while
Pumpin' up the sweetness, this is what you need
Another little piece of me inside of you
'Cause you know that I always keep it true (keep it true)
And that's exactly what I do, it's what I do
Yeah, it's what I do

[Hook: Fred Durst & (Xzibit)]
You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little somethin'-somethin' didn't go your way
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way (come on!)
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place (yeah)
We're only givin' a fuck, if you're evadin' the space
So getcha-getcha groove on (gotta getcha groove on)
Don't keep us waitin' too long (don't keep us waitin' too long)

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
I got breakneck delivery, no time for chivalry
Extraordinary ability, shit longevity
Dig deep in your soul and find yourself
'Cause mind control can turn y'all to someone else
So fast, your head had probably spinned the fuck right off
Me and Fred about to go half on Microsoft
Me and Limp prolly twenty percent (damn)
Your little half-ass, direct hits ain't even makin' a dent
What an event! All hail Xzibit and Limp
As we attempt to bring home the championship
It's all in the wrists, I still lead the league in assists
Gimme the fifth, I'm drinkin' while I'm takin' a piss, bitch

[Hook: Fred Durst & (Xzibit)]
You don't wanna fuck with me today (yeah)
'Cause a little somethin'-somethin' didn't go your way
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way (come on!)
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck, if you're evadin' the space
So getcha-getcha groove on (gotta getcha groove on)
Don't keep us waitin' too long (don't keep us waitin' too long)

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I got untapped material, I serial-kill shit
Give me the real shit, X, finish 'em all quick
Makin' your jaw split when I'm touchin' the mosh pit
Constant conflict, knockin' faggots unconscious
Hypnosious, raisin' the stakes, increasin' the weight
Got homies I can lay down that lift they plates
So quit tryin' to evade my space
Before I call for a face to face, and gotta rest my case, like

[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
This is how we do it, just recognize (aha), we keep gettin' right to it
Look into these eyes (yeah), look into these eyes
And you'll see the size of the flame (whoa)
Then you might despise the size of my game
Step the fuck back, Xzibit's on the track (what up?)
You should've buckled up before your head hit the dash (yeah)
You gotta hate that, a demo from an eight track (yeah)
Brought me to a place, where platinum comes in eight stacks, bitch

[Hook: Fred Durst & (Xzibit)]
You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little somethin'-somethin' didn't go your way (what up?)
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way (come on!)
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place (aha)
We're only givin' a fuck, if you're evadin' the space
So getcha-getcha groove on (gotta getcha groove on)
Don't keep us waitin' too long (don't keep us waitin' too long)

[Bridge: Xzibit & (Fred Durst)]

'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way
(Limp Bizkit, Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit)
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
