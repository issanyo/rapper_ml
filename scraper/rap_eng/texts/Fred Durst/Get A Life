[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Check it out, it's the outlaw, white dog
Often called by my alias, "Polar Bear"
Brain tied like the S&M freak shit
Cold like the ice you're servin' up my drinks with
Stick shift, fuck the automatic
Rollin' up in third gear, guess it's just a habit
And all you freaky bitches reachin' out to grab it
Don't hesitate, 'cause you can have it, I'ma stab it
Demolition came to crush the mission
Just in time for you maniacs to listen
And it 'ain't nothin', 'cause don't think it's serious
My flow is cold like the weather in Siberia
I keep your head bobbin', like a novelty
And all them turkey emcees wanna gobble me
But I'm a shark in my underground fish tank
And I don't give a shit what those motherfuckers think
B-Boy with a taste for the metal
A taste for a fine rhyme and I 'ain't gonna settle
If you don't like it, you can scratch up on these nuts, bitch
Polar Bear ain't a cracker you should fuck with
Buggalo, shinin' like a diamond
Momma went and bought a kid a mic, now he's rhymin'
And now he's hated, 'cause everybody played it
But they're just hatin' 'cause I motherfuckin' made it

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Get a life, get a motherfuckin' life!
You don't wanna see what I can do with a knife
You don't wanna be my enemy, I promise you
If you do, motherfucker, bring it on!
Get a life, get a motherfuckin' life!
You don't wanna see what I can do with a knife
You don't wanna be my enemy, I promise you
If you do, motherfucker, bring it on!

[Verse 2]
Ah, hell, let me tone it down
Pour me up another double shot of the crown
Get this party hoppin' when I step into your town
I came to boogy down, 'cause I don't give a fuck
I don't ride in limos, 'cause limos make me carsick
I ain't goin' out like the dancin' with the stars shit
I don't wait in line 'cause I'm always on the guest list
Anywhere I go, always leavin' with the best bitch
And all my boys get the pick of the litter
That girl you came with, I suggest you forget her
North Carolina is my homeland
I'm homegrown, just a cackalacky mofo
A redneck who never had a dollar
Now I'm makin' people all around the world holla
Hit and now I'm hated, 'cause everybody played it (yeah)
But they just hatin' 'cause this motherfucker made it

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Get a life, get a motherfuckin' life!
You don't wanna see what I can do with a knife
You don't wanna be my enemy, I promise you
If you do, motherfucker, bring it on!
Get a life, get a motherfuckin' life!
You don't wanna see what I can do with a knife
You don't wanna be my enemy, I promise you
If you do, motherfucker, bring it on!

[Bridge: Fred Durst]
Don't let the world bring you down, down
Don't let the world bring you down, down
Polar Bear, bustin' up the Endone
Make a sucker-jump straight out the window
Keep it, get low, kid, that's for shit flow
Like an asshole, bitch, it's official
Polar Bear, bustin' up the Endone
Make a sucker-jump straight out the window
Keep it, get low, kid, that's for shit flow
Like an asshole, bitch, it's official
Bring it on!

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Get a life, get a motherfuckin' life!
You don't wanna see what I can do with a knife
You don't wanna be my enemy, I promise you
If you do, motherfucker, bring it on!
Get a life, get a motherfuckin' life!
You don't wanna see what I can do with a knife
You don't wanna be my enemy, I promise you
If you do, motherfucker, bring it on!

Правда?
[?]
Это звучит слишком хорошо, чтоб быть правдой
[?]
М-м-м, я даже не знала, что ты такой сексуальный
[?]
Я никогда об этом не слышала
[?]
Подожди, я точно об этом слышала
[?]
Но это такая редкость, всего одна во всем мире!
[?]
Я хочу золотую

Ха-ха!
