[Intro]
Yeah, ah, check this!
Kid (come on!)
Check this! (Fuck you!)

[Verse 1]
Wakin' up, aggravated
Stupid shit, man, I hate it
Bitches lyin', bitches cryin'
Suicidal, get in line
Gettin' mine, bouncin' freaks
Losin' sleep, countin' sheep
Absolute, cash and loot
Man in black, packin' heat
Born and blazin', rotten raisin'
Fingers up, time to wave 'em
Show these players playin'
That they better get their ass to prayin'
They won't be nothin' but dice
After the cuttin', I'm guttin' 'em
Like a fish, they're gonna wish
They never pushed my button

[Pre-Chorus]
The door is shuttin' and a knock will do you no good
You're gettin' nothin' while I rock here in Hollywood
I'll tell you somethin' else, you can take it to the bank
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all people think

[Chorus]
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra

[Ad-libs]
Oh, that's right!
Yeah, that's right! (shut the fuck up!)

[Verse 2]
Feelin' Korn, goin' blind
Free as hell, doin' time
I'm insane, can't complain
Flush you turds down the drain
Down the hatch, throwin' craps
Throwin' matches on the gas
Check the math, check the wheels
Check the ride, pay the bills
Burnin' miles, harder smile
If you're feelin' versatile
Verses wild, flippin' bitches
Grindin' trucks, skatin' ditches
Hatin' hard, but hardly hatin'
Knife and slice your shit like bacon
Sick and tired, you is fired
I'm the truth, and you's the liar

[Pre-Chorus]
The door is shuttin' and a knock will do you no good
You're gettin' nothin' while I rock here in Hollywood
I'll tell you somethin' else, you can take it to the bank
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all people think

[Chorus]
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, listen what I'm tellin' you (I'm telling you)
There's only one king on this hill, it sure as hell ain't you
Oh yeah, listen what I'm tellin' you (I'm telling you)
There's only one king on this hill, it sure as hell ain't you (yeah!)

[Chorus]
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
