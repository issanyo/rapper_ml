[Verse 1]
Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like me
But I got to think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play 'cause I play them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you the door

[Chorus]
Well, I gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!

[Verse 2]
Baby I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please, don't go away
'Cause you're giving me the blues
Baby, your mind made all the word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy blues
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you that door

[Chorus]
Well, I gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Get the fuck up!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!
Faith!
Faith!
