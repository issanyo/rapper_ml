Step right up
Step right up, everyone

Whether you're good or bad
Happy or sad

Whether you're an emotional wreck
Or a blissfull speck in this black hole of an existence
We call life

Step right up
And witness something
You'll be soon to never forget
Feast your ears on the most ferociously
Soothing ways of sonic communication
To ever be created

Built for you by the MASTER
*HEYYYYYYYY*
Built for you by the MA
*Hey shut up already, what is it ?!*
What is it?
*Uh, yeah dog, what is it*
What is IT ?!?
*Dude, chill man*
IT... Is Limp... Bizkit...

All around the world you know me
All around the world we know you

All around the world you know me
All around the world we know you
