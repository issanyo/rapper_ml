It's getting closer to the end, every part of me
Then disaster takes its toll and now I'm left with only me
Maybe sorrow plays a role when you feel unkind
Your abuses matter, standing up forever lost in time

Save me, save me before I drown
Save me, save me before I drown

It's getting closer to the end, I look back and smile
We conquered every single bump in my road, made it all worthwhile
Just remember how I cared when it came crashing down
I'd like to toast to all those angels that were always hanging 'round

Save me, save me before I drown
Save me, save me before I drown, drown
Oh, oh

Maybe life ain't what it seems, 'cause it's all a dream
Forgive me
Sometimes I feel like a fool 'cause I'm so uncool
Forgive me
