[Intro]
Livin' in the fast lane
This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller
You are my favorite motherfucker
I told you, didn't I?

[Verse 1]
Drama makes the world go around, does anybody got a problem with that?
My business is my business, who's guilty?
Can I get a witness, first things first
The Chocolate Starfish is my man Fred Durst
Access Hollywood lisence to kill
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bangin' on the dumpster funk
My microphone machete's in the back of my trunk
Rocker's who's steady with the he says, she says
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien
With thirty seven tons of new millenium
Dum diddie dum, where's it coming from?
Mrs. Aguilera, come and get some
Oh no, which way to go to the dance floor
It's on my stereo, pay me no mind
I seen The Fight Club about twenty eight times
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin', keep a skateboard
A spray can, for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

[Hook]
I'm just a crazy motherfucker
Livin' it up, not giving a fuck
Livin' life in the fast lane
Another crazy motherfucker
Livin' it up, not giving a fuck
In the fast lane

[Verse 2]
Take two, hoo haa
Now who's the star sucker? I'm the Starfish
You silly motherfucker
Puff puff, give the marijuana cig, opps
I don't even smoke, but I love the way it smells
Here's a toast to the females
Sippin' lung champagne from a seashell
I think I gotta feel and pop his ass like a zit
With the starfish navigation system
I'm no cheap thrills baby
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill fella
Spittin' out hella' mic skills
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin', keep a skateboard
A spray can, for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Cause it's so easy to tell a lie
And it's so easy to run and hide
But it's not easy to be alive
So don't be wasting none on my time

[Verse 3]
This world is like a cage and I don't think it's fair
And I don't even think that anybody cares
It'll leave a hole down the side of me
And it'll leave a scar, can anybody see?
That we gotta get it out, we gotta get it out
And I'mma get it out with the motherfuckin' microphone
Plugging in my soul
I'm a renegade riot getting out of control
I'mma keep it alive
And continue to be flying like an eagle to my destiny
So can you feel me? (Hell yeah)
Can you feel me? (Hell yeah)
If you feel motherfucker then you'll say (Hell yeah)
Hell yeah, I'm livin' life in the fast lane

[Bridge + Hook]
