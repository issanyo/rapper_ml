I don't like the radio
I don't like tv
They're selling so much shit these days
And this shit is not who I want to be
I don't like officials
Using rank to pretend they're not crooks
I don't like the tricks played on kids
In those shitty teen metal books
I don't like my heroes
To kill themselves with the drugs
I don't think success
Can fill you up when you need love
I don't like the whores
That try to fuck you for your game
I don't like my childhood
And do not need someone else to blame

This is the channel I'm dialed into
I already know you, are dialed in too
This is the channel I'm dialed into
And I already know you, are dialed in too
I already know you are dialed in too

Come on

I don't like this music
I don't like this band
I like what we're about
And mock what you cannot understand
I don't like being paranoid
I don't like that I'm breeding again
But I accept all these cards I've been dealt
And do not be your motherfucking friend

This is the channel I'm dialed into
I already know you, are dialed in too
This is the channel I'm dialed into
And I already know you, are dialed in too
I already know you are dialed in too
I already know you are dialed in too

Who gives a fuck about what I like
Who gives a fuck about who listens
As long as I'm here
As long as you know you can keep me here
For whenever you get lost
Or you need an excuse to coverup your intentions
You hate that I express how I'm feeling
You hate that you relate to this shit
You hate that I'm a tick
A motherfucking tick
You're finding hard to forget!

This is the channel I'm dialed into
I already know you, are dialed in too
This is the channel I'm dialed into
And I already know you, are dialed in too
I already know you are dialed in too
I already know you are dialed in too
