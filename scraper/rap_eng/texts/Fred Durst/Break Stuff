It's just one of those days
When you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked
Everybody sucks
You don't really know why
But you want justify
Ripping someone's head off
No human contact
And if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
Its all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talking that shit
(Punk, so come and get it)

Its just one of those days
Feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain
Leaves with a blood stain
Damn right I'm a maniac
You better watch your back
Cuz I'm fuckin' up your program
And if your stuck up
You just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
Its just one of those days

It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
Its all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talking that shit, punk

Alright, Let's have a little fun, shall we?
Everybody in this place, get down, get down on the fucking grown, come on, come on, come on, come on
You guys know how to do this?
Hey do you guys know how to jump the fuck up or what?
Come on

Skin your ass raw
And if my day keep going this way
I might just break something tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keep going this way
I might just break something tonight

I got a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keep going this way
I might just break something tonight

I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keep going this way
I just might break your fucking face tonight
Give me something to break
Give me something to break
Just give me something to break
How bout your fucking face

I hope you know I pack a chain saw, what
A chainsaw, what
A motherfucking chain saw, what
So come and get it

It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
Its all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talking that shit
So come and get it
