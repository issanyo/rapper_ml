[Verse 1]
You keep your distance, I can't deny you
I got the feeling, can't satisfy you
I got your picture on the wall
I got the picture long gone
You keep your wishes, I'll keep my feelings
There goes another one that kept me breathing
I'm waiting for you, I know you're leaving
I'll still adore you, you never need me

[Hook]
Hold on, I've found another way to let you go away
Hold on, you've found another way to bleed my soul away

[Verse 2]
The things you told me, to hear you speak
I'm burning slowly, I'm growing weak
You bring me closer to yesterday
Yesterday's a million miles away
Why can't you hear me, why can't I sleep?
And I don't understand what keeps me breathing
I'm waiting for you, I know you're leaving
I'll still adore you, you'll never need me

[Hook] x3

[Outro]
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
