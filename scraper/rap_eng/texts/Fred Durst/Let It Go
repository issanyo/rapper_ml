Run
Is that all you can do
Its all you've been doing
Since you've been two
You just run
You run away from change
Leaving me bleeding
But you can't see

You're so dumb
With your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

Wait
I ain't waiting for shit
Cause when you're waiting on something
All you can get is a fix
Yeah you were just my fix
Punchin' your card in
For all you can get

You're so dumb
With your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

What hurts so much
Is I believed you
To be a true friend
All along
But you never cared
You never cared

That I had your back
Through all the confusion
Through all the abuse
And I cared
No matter what you said
But now you betrayed me
Embarrassed and played me

So dumb
With your big dumb face
And your big dumb ego
What a disgrace, let it go
What a disgrace, let it go

What hurts so much
Is I believed you
To be a true friend
All along
But you never cared
You never cared

What hurts so much
Is I believed you
To be a true friend
All along
But you never cared
You never cared

I always used to say
Keep your friends close
And your enemies closer
I always used to say
Dig a hole for the next man
And you'll fall in

I always used to say
Keep your friends close
And your enemies closer
I always used to say
Dig a hole for the next man
And you'll fall in

I know, you know
That you're ready to fall in
I know, you know
That you're ready to fall in
I know, you know
That you're ready to fall in
I know, you know
That you're ready to fall in

Too late now
Afraid now
Of all the things I could say now
Its too late to complain
You don't deserve a word

Too late now
Afraid now
Of all the things I could say now
Its too late to complain
You don't deserve a word

What hurts so much
Is I believed you
To be a true friend
All along
But you never cared
You never cared

What hurts so much
Is I believed you
To be a true friend
All along
But you never cared
