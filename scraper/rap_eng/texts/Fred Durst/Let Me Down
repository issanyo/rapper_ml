[Verse 1]
Heartbreak is a headache
Like a toothache or an earthquake
Spontaneous combustion
Leaves a taste that so disgusting
And it don't go away too fast
I'm a window made of broken glass
I've never needed anything
Anything but you
And that's what wrong
That's what i get
For feeling this
Anyway...
Just let me know
All i'll miss
When i'm gone


[Chorus]
Just throw it all away... you let me down
Like everybody says... you let me down
Write me off like yesterday... you let me down
Oh, i guess that your not good enough to be with me


[Verse 2]
Rumors are tumors
Of the sick and mainly useless
When you come to me with these things
It's the shit that i can't deal with
Still i gave you all of me
Faithfulness and honesty
Prayed for God to bring you near
Along with all these tears
And that's what wrong
That's what i get
For feeling this
Anyway... just let me know
Just let me know
All i'll miss
When i'm gone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'd like to thank you
For letting me know i can feel this way
Feel this way
For letting me know i can feel

[Chorus x2]
