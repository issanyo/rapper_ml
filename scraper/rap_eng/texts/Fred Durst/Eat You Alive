[Verse 1]
Hey you, Mrs. I-Don't-Know-What-The-Fuck-Your-Name-Is
I'm drawn to you, somethin's magnetic here
If I could approach you or even get close to the scent
That you left behind, I'd be fine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No doubt now
You bring out
The animal inside

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd eat you alive!
I'd eat you alive
Oh, I'd eat you alive!
I'd eat you alive

[Verse 2]
Hey you, Mrs. Too-Good-To-Look-My-Way and that's cool
You want nothin' at all to do with me
But I want you, ain't nothing wrong with wantin' you
'Cause I'm a man and I can think what the hell I want, you got that straight?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No doubt that
I'd love to
Sniff on them panties now

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd eat you alive!
I'd eat you alive
Oh, I'd eat you alive!
I'd eat you alive

[Bridge]
I'm sorry, so sorry (Damn, you're so hot!)
Your beauty is so vain (Damn, you're so hot!)
It drives me, yes, it drives me (Damn, you're so hot!)
Absolutely insane

[Interlude]
I just want to look at you
I just want to look at you
I just want to look at you, oh, all day
There ain't nothin' wrong, no
There ain't nothin' wrong with that
Once you seep in
Under my skin
There's nothing, there's nothing
In this world that could wash you away
Once you seep in, yeah
Under my skin
There's nothing, there's nothing
In this world that could wash you away

[Bridge]
I'm sorry, so sorry (Damn, you're so hot!)
Your beauty is so vain (Damn, you're so hot!)
It drives me, yes, it drives me (Damn, you're so hot!)
Absolutely insane

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd eat you alive!
I'd eat you alive
Oh, I'd eat you alive!
I'd eat you alive
Oh, I'd eat you alive!
