[Intro]
Who's the man? (the-the-the, the man in the middle)
Who's the man? (the-the man, the-the man in the middle)
Who's the man? (the-the man, the-the man in the middle)
Who's the man? (who-who, who's the man-man-man?)

[Verse 1]
When I reminisce, ignorance was bliss
Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was, 'cause the way it
Was just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun livin' life on the run
Never had chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle, so figure it out
Always thinkin' that you know every little thing there is to know
Buy you don't really know, you know?
It's like love, some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me it's just a pain in the ass
But I'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last

[Chorus]
Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

[Interlude]
Who's the man? (the-the-the man-man, man in the middle)
Who's the man? (the-the, the-the man, man in the middle)
Who's the man? (man, man-man in the middle, in the middle)
Who's the man? (who-who's the man?)

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
At least I can say that I've never been a quitter
I remember high school, man, I hated high school
It was like prison with bullies always puttin' me down
Just a little skater-boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive 'em, now I got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my Gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still I never want it all, and I never want it now
I just wanna cruise, if I lose, then I'll figure it out
How the times files, even with the blink of an eye
When you're young, you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's was amazing what you learn when you've never been taught, you know?

[Chorus]
Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

[Bridge]
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world (such a lonely world)
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

[Chorus]
Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

[Outro]
Who's the man? (in such a lonely world)
Who-who's the man? (in such a lonely world)
Who-who's the man? (in such a lonely world)
Who-who's the man? (in such a lonely world)
(In such a lonely world)
(In such a lonely world)
(In such a lonely world, such a lonely world, such a lonely world)
