Just live and let die
Check, check, check, comon

If you could take a minute of your life
A certain minute when you feel the lightning strike
Danger is the only level of that moment
But it's your moment and you know you'll fucking own it
Glorified in the grace by your victory
When you're done, you escape without memory
Blindfolded through this life as we learn
And consequences when the wrong pages turn

It's an E! true hollywood story
Take a man down with his own glory
Now guess who's next

At some point we come down from the highs
And so be it we move on with our lives
Some of us let the laughs cover cries
Do the math, you can laugh when I die
If life is just a fantasy life then could you
Live this fantasy life for soemthing would you
Just remember that the doors are not closeable
And the mother fucking heroes are disposable

It's an E! true hollywood story
Take a man down with his own glory
Now guess who's next

It's an E! true hollywood story
Take a man down with his own glory
Now guess who's next

Just live and let die
Just live and let
Just live and let
Just live and let die

Just live and let die
Just live and let
Just live and let

So what about the hardcore that ain't hard anymore
Or the shit talkers who ain't shit anymore
Or the old fighters that can't fight anymore
Or the white kid's who ain't white any more
Or the actors that don't act anymore
Or the rappers that don't rap anymore
Or the hipsters that don't hip anymore
Or the limpsters that don't limp anymore

Just live and let die
Just live and let
Just live and let
Just live and let die

Just live and let die
Just live and let
Just live and let
Just live and let die

But no
It's impossible
Just to live your live your life
And let us die

Oh mother fuck that
You wanna talk about some shit
Let's talk about

The hardcore that ain't hard anymore
Or the shit talkers who ain't shit anymore
Or the old fighters that can't fight anymore
Or the white kid's who ain't white any more
Or the actors that don't act anymore
Or the rappers that don't rap anymore
Or the hipsters that don't hip anymore
Or the limpsters that don't limp anymore

It's an E! true hollywood story
Take a man down with his own glory
Now guess who's next

It's an E! true hollywood story
Take a man down with his own glory
Now guess who's next
