[Intro]
I don't have arms
I don't have legs
I don't have any human qualities

[Verse 1]
The devil comes and I, I try to stall and I
Soon my subconscious and conscious might start to brawl
And I put up my walls, and I, and they begin to fall
As this cunning demon takes me as it's voodoo doll and I

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Darkness sets in as the horns start to grow
Suddenly I become somebody I don't know

[Chorus]
Whoa, what do I do?
This body's a temple of doom
Whoa, what can I say?
To, oh, make all of this go away

[Verse 2]
I got many different names, but to you, it's all the same
I be the crawling in your skin, I be the reason for your sin
I be the cunning in your charm and I be the needle in your arm
Call me once, might let you go
But call me twice and then I'm gonna get ya

[Verse 3]
Mind playing tricks on me, I'm paranoid, homie
Nobody know what I'm going through
God, I'm so lonely
I know I'm losing it, I'm hearing, whispering
Somebody's watching me, clocking me, hear my heart ticking

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Worshiping two Gods can get you in deep
Crystal ball show you things you're not supposed to see

[Chorus]
Whoa, what do I do?
This body's a temple of doom
Whoa, what can I say?
To, oh, make all of this go away

[Outro]
You know I'm coming for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
You know I'm coming for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
You know I'm coming for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
You know I'm coming for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
You know I'm coming for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
