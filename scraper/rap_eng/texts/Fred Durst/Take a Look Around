[Intro (Video version only)]
"Mr. Durst?"
"Yeah?"
"We need your help. Pulling into the diner about now should be four top-secret agents. One of them is carrying a briefcase. Your mission is to obtain the disc from the briefcase."

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it, ya shit can how we did it
Just because they don't get it – but I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
Do we always gotta cry? Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo – remember that, kid
So what you wanna do? And where you gonna run
When you're starin' down the cable of a mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set – it's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
'Cause I'ma be the one 'til I jet (I'ma be the one 'til I jet)

[Chorus]
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

[Hook]
And now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
And now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (no, sir!)
And now you want your money back
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through

[Chorus]
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

[Hook]
And now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
And now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

[Bridge]
Now I know why
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)

[Hook]
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

[Outro (Video version only)]
"Hello?"
"Mr. Durst? Abort the mission, the man in the diner had decoys. Thanks anyway."
"This message will self-destruct in five seconds."
