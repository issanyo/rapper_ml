[Intro: Scroggie Jones]
Oh man
Here we go again
You've been waiting, huh?
It's the Deadboy, back from the grave

[Chorus: Bones & Scroggie Jones]
Bones (oh yeah), it's the Deadboy (ah)
Bones (mm-hmm), that skinny white pimp (alright)
Bones (oh yeah), it's the Deadboy (that's cold)
Bones (oh yeah), that skinny white pimp (ah)
Bones (oh yeah), you know who it is
Bones (mm-hmm), that skinny white pimp (alright)

[Verse 1: Bones & Scroggie Jones]
Where's the truth? Say it in the booth
Drop bombs on whack MC's that's actin' new (yeah)
Its 1992, here we come kickin' doors down (ooh)
Sesh Compound, blunts lit, bumpin' motown (mm-hmm)
Hit 'em with the pro sound, then I go ghost (yeah)
Forever in the attic, hittin' all the wrong notes (ah)
I'm the eyes floating in the dark just as I emerge (you know)
You know who it is, I don't gotta say a word

[Chorus: Bones & Scroggie Jones]
Bones (oh yeah), it's the Deadboy (it's the motherfucking Deadboy)
Bones (mm-hmm), that skinny white pimp (well, alright)
Bones (oh yeah), it's the Deadboy (it's the Deadboy)
Bones, that skinny white pimp (well, alright)

[Verse 2: Bones & Scroggie Jones]
Yeah they know who it is, this and that, that and this
Faux fur drag behind me, you already know the biz it's (yeah)
(Bones), look who just stepped in
(That skinny white pimp)
Where do I begin? (yeah)
I began in the land that was frozen
Spent my time huddled around the fire just hopin' (oh yeah)
Till I turned 14, thawed out and noticed
That they don't lock the doors on the cars around the corner
If you wanna detect me you need sophisticated sonar
Ash drop slow, but the snow fall slower
Never had the funds till I struck with the scrap
Yard full of metal, crowbar in my bag
(SESH)
(well, alright)

[Outro: Joseph Urban]
Hey Bones man, hey Bones, what's up my nigga, how you doin' mate
