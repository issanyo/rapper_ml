[Intro]
Keepin' it real, world wide, baby
Limp Bizkit's in the house, so bring it on!
I'd like to dedicate this song to you
For makin' my dreams come true, for the millennium
Are you ready? Then get the fuck up!
Who's hot, who's not?

[Verse 1]
Where you at, Jacksonville, Rochester, Louisville
Columbia, Hartford, Milwaukee, and Lewiston Maine?
Where you at, Providence, Nashville, Memphis, Lauderdale
Portland, Orlando, Chicago, and Frisco?
I left my heart in Austin with Mary Campbell
Got lost in Boston, lookin' for the tea party
Met a child molester in Worchester
I need a Kleenex every time I'm leavin' Phoenix
I get silly when I play in Philly
Limp Bizkit committee down in Kansas City
Never know what I'm in for when I'm play in Denver
Hard Rock don't stop down in Vegas
In Cincinnati the girls call me Daddy
And I probably ain't leavin' the next time I'm in Cleveland
Found my lucky coin in Des Moines
And spit on a boy named Tina in Pasadena
We get to swing from New Orleans, Fort Worth, and Dallas
We toast when we're tippin' up the Challis
Tulsa, St. Louis, Sacto, Mesa
Norfolk, Lawrence, Minneapolis, St. Paul
North Hampton, Detroit, Omaha, New York, LA
What can I say? I can't name 'em all
So somebody, anybody, everybody
Get the fuck up!

[Chorus]
Show me what you got! Wooh, ah!
Show me what you got!
Hey, ladies!
Who's hot, who's not?
Who, who?
Who's hot, who's not?

[Verse 2]
I can't help but to believe in these friends
These bands, these stories, and the places that I've been
I thank God, Mom and Dad
Adriana for the love I feel inside
Jordan, my phat ass band
Without 'em I'd be nothin' but a pumpkin shoved inside a can
Without the fans, there wouldn't be no show
And if that was really so, then life would really blow
To the firm, you always got my back
Korn for the love and the swappin' of the tracks
My brother Cory D., my man Terry Date
We brought it to the plate and you made it sound great
Scott Weiland, the melody man
If you can't sing it, then nobody can
Wu-Tang-Clan, skills from the Method
The world's best MC kills on this record
Slim Shady, the crazy ass cracker
Staind, a brand new drug for your brain
Les Claypool, for actin' like a fool
And all of the bands for the demos that were cool
I'm so grateful for this life of mine
The ones I didn't thank â€“ I will some other time
Now I just want somebody, anybody, everybody
To get the fuck up!

[Chorus]
And show me what you got! Wooh, ah!
Show me what you got!
Hey, ladies!
Who's hot, who's not?
Who, who?
Who's hot, who's not?

[Outro]
Who's hot, baby?
Who's hot?
