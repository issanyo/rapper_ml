Yeah! Word up!
(yeah word up dog)
Somebody's in the house
(in the house)
Colicab in the house!

I bust silly, crazy, cool
On the microphone
Can't stop the tone
When I'm in the zone
I'll be slicker and quicker
Then a wet street
I bust muthafucka's up
That try to bust of me

You word up!
I can't be stopped
Every word I say
Has got letters in it
You better be afraid
Of my unstoppable money
I got all the bitches
Cause I'm so funny

The snake says "hey"
A snake says "ho"
Cause the hoes know the power of the
Bass control
End control?
Can't be stopped!
Cause a bass in your face
Is like da snake

Give me the bass
Like a bass in your face
Like a can of mace
Ride the snake
Give me the bass
Like a bass in your face
Like a can of mace
Ride the snake
Bring me the bass
The bass in your face
Can of mace, snake
Bring me the bass
Like the bass in your face
Can of mace
Ride the snake
Bring me the bass
Ridin' the snake
Yeah! bring me the bass

Ride the snake! (x5)
Base in your face! (x3)

The snake is in the house!
