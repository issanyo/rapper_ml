[Verse 1]
Now I know y'all be lovin' this shit right here
L.I.M.P. Bizkit is right here
People in the house put them hands in the air
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care (yeah)
1, 2, 3 times, two to the six
Chosen for your fix of that Limp Bizkit mix
So where the fuck you at, punk?
Shut the fuck up and back the fuck up while we fuck this track up

[Verse 2]
You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit? (yeah)
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit (why?)
Because we get it on (when?)
Everyday and every night (oh)
And this platinum thing right here (aha?)
Yo, we're doin' it all the time (what?)
So you better get some better beats and, ah
Get some better rhymes (duh!)
We got the gang set, so don't complain yet
Twenty-four-seven, never beggin' for a rain check
Old school soldiers blastin' out the hot shit
That rock shit, puttin' bounce in the mosh pit
