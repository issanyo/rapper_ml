And you, you bring me to my knees, again
All the times, that I could beg you please, in vain
All the times, when I felt insecure, for you
And I leave, my burdens at the door

But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

All the times, that I felt like this won't end
It's for you, and I taste what I could never have
It was from you, all the times that I've cried
My intentions, were full of pride
But I waste, more time than anyone

But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

All the times, that I've cried
All this wasted, it's all inside
And I feel, all this pain
I stuffed it down, it's back again
And I lie, here in bed
All alone, I can't mend
But I feel, tomorrow will be okay

But I'm on the outside, and I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
Inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you
