[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy, oh, crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!

[Verse 1:]
I won some battling, embarrassing, leaving you passed out
Pants down, butt fucked by the Vatican
You show me what a faggot is, I'll show you what a Magnum is
You dead in my eyes, I'm just blasting where your casket is
A young bastard, that's beast and crazy
I was found in the street and raised up by Shady
No sound when I speak, but you know what I'm saying
When my trigger finger click, you would know I'm not playing
I'm the climax of Jason, seed of death
In the Ku Klux Klan, hanging niggas to rep
I'm an authentic asshole, choose your step
Or get tekked, next step you would lose your breath
I ain't here to conversate about whose a fake
Cause every time you drop an album, you lose respect
I'm one of a few rappers that do Mathers a G
From the West Coast chapter, of King Mathers, Skreeeeech...

[Verse 2:]
Lyrical, no subliminal, shitting on you on literal
What you hold, identical to genitals, you dick ridah
Oscillate me from them guys I spit fire
But I'm a murderer and not like them liars
I crush empires, live by us inside of wires
In light of these niggas riddin' by us, try us...
I clip fliers on your lip, then sprint, trying
To rip your fucking mouth off, you bitch... dying
For all standards, flip cannons, shots landing in your face
Now your bodies abandoned, I can show you how to body a bandit
With a shotty I'm standing, in a lobby like Pac nigga, but I ain't get shot
Got grazed, unfazed, gun slang and bang, pump 'cain all day just to earn my name
On the block where I turn my game, I'm Cashis nigga
You motherfuckerz better learn my name, yeeeah...

[Verse 3:]
Maybe Shady raised a Satan baby
I can feel you hating lately, I've been sniffing, drankin', violating my probation
Ya'll can't take me I'll go crazy, you don't want that situation
Wasting tax payers money, giving me all these cases
My past is a violent one and I can't erase it
I'm getting fresh out of jail, and racing back to the station
Staying wasted, I get the bombest chron, with coke that I lace it
Getting close to Cobain, I drain, I'm there I can taste it
It don't take a million takes for me to walk in and lay it
I got a cater, say these motherfuckin DJs will play it
Walking up congratulated, but inside I feel hated, or maybe it's the hatred inside
I spew cause I'm hating that everyone of my guys died, before I can make it
You the false ridah, I don't like you I can't fake it
See I'm patiently waiting, A buzz bangin', and waving my gun
Pussy quit talkin' shit and close up your lady you punk...
