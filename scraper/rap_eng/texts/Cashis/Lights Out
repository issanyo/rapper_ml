[Intro: Ca$his]
Capo
Chris Link
Lights Out

[Verse 1: CHL]
Chris Link my given name
CHL my written name
And god blessed me
To kill in this written game
Grew up in Brooklyn
New definition of lights out
Generator went dead
The whole projects was lights out
Try to steal our product
Yeah it's lights out
So when I go to the booth
Turn the lights out
So I can think of all these crimes
Writing all these lines
Russ told me
They love me for my raw rhymes
Cause I really do it
The streets knew it
What to meet in Queens
See you on Conduit
I'm the bomb stupid
Cause I'm bout to blow
See me in the streets
Never think I was professional
But looks can be deceiving
Just like a bitch
No I don't cuff em
I'm just getting rich
It's CHL in this bitch
This that CHiL Factor
I was local before
Now you hear me after
Started in the streets
Now I'm world wide
I was raised to grind
Thats my G side
Always shady
Rocking with Ca$his
Bury you in the clay
Call me Cashis

[Hook: Ca$his]
Lights out
Cut on the Mic
I rhyme right now
Lines of my life come out
Your bread right now
Lights out
Cut on the Mic
I rhyme right now
Lines of my life come out
Your bread right now
Lights out
Cut on the Mic
I rhyme right now
Lines of my life come out
Your bread right now
Lights out
Cut on the Mic
I rhyme right now
Lines of my life come out
Your bread right now

[Verse 2: CHL]
This hook got me feeling like EM
Hard white rapper
Killing with the pen
Cooper Projects
Thats my 8 mile
But I stood through it all
With a lil smile
Truth is I was raised for the streets
And god gave me flow
To kill all these beats
And then came aggression
To bring all the heat
And then came your bitch
To rub on my feet
I got swag
I could take her in a min bro
But fuck that
I don't want that nasty ho
Maybe if I was drunk
With the lights out
Pretend she Megan
Then It's lights out
But I ain't doing that
I need a bad bitch
And I can get her with swag
Being Hood Rich
I could go Ratchet
I could go Preppy
I'm a pimp bitch
Call me Hugh Heffy

[Hook: Ca$his]

[Verse 3: CHL]
Let the beat breath

Every time I'm in the booth
Cut the lights
So I'm alone in my mind
Like Jesus Christ
But It's Hell in there
I've been through it all
Christmas Miracle
That I never fall
Sometimes it hurts so bad
The way I feel inside
When I think
About my first homicide
Then I turn to drinking
Till its lights out
Or I turn to rap
And bring the mics out
Or I turn to drugs
And I just get high
Whatever I got to do
Just to get by
Never thought that I would make it this far
My life like a road trip in a shitty car
Roller Coaster
I got my up and downs
So every time I smile
That means I'm gonna frown
Till the day I get signed
And take whats mine
Bitch I'll be fine
I just gotta rhyme
My first album
Called the CHiL Factor
I'm Mr. Hard White
And I'm an ill rapper
I'm gonna make it
I'm taking you with me
Y'all my G-Unit
Call me 50
