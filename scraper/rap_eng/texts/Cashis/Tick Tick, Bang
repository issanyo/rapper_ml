Chorus [Focus...]

Don't even said it, homie you gon' regret it
You might of seen me around, but really we ain't one and the same
And i'm sick and i'm tired and it's strange how you don't see it in my face
I'm bout to Tick Tick Tick Bang
You need to dead it, homie this ain't a legend
I really do what I say, and I ain't really playin' a game
And i'm sick of you fakes, cos it's strange how you don't see it in my face
I'm bout to Tick Tick Tick Bang

Verse 1 [Stat Quo]

It's evident, I got the evidence
That when n***s is not relevant, they be hatin' Oh
Not Quo, here me tho, 40 below temperatures I made it go
Standing in the middle of a desert I done made it snow
My effort to bring terror to the stereo
Aggressive when put in, certain scenarios
Another day another burial, It's a blood bath flooding the street
N***'S drown in it, let the levee go
A straight killer, non iller, Godzilla
A monster, murderer, I'm Thriller
Go to sleep, here's a pillow take the slug with ya
When it hit ya coroner come and take the picture
You can't sustain or stand in my lane
As these bars beat in your brain, nothing remains but your remains
I'm f***n' insane, refusing to change and rapin' the game
To get at the chain, you know the name, It's Stat (Yeah)

Verse 2 [Ca$his]

I'll just follow you in the mall, gotchu
Ricochet off the buildin', exit the glass bottle
Lodgin' in ya nostril, double cock the chamber that clear the nozzle
Clip at the bottom, spot 'em just like Bin Laden
Me and my mutha f***n' rebels been plottin' toxic shock on the rival block
Light that a**s up like I'm burnin' pot
Send me somethin' worthy, I can do another murder
In the time you flip a burger, stomach turnin' off the squirmin'
Jumpin' out the f***n' window, ???
Ain't nobody givin' info, they get murdered
I'm rhymin' over instrumentals, while I'm burnin'
On this herb and it seems to be more potent than sherm is
Deter kids from ???
I be caught up in a whirlwind 'til my f***n' world end
Deter kids from???
I be caught up in a whirlwind 'til my f***n' world end

Verse 3 [Obie Trice]

N***s wanna assassinate a n***a ass today
Fascinated with seein' a n***a pass away
Sad to say, they don't know what my past portray
Predicate felons get they a**s blasted away
Now it's a pastor with a casket on display
Tragedy happens coz I accurately spray
No inaccuracy no stray
I massively incapacitate the human body
I ain't one of them rappers tweakin' on the replay
Any melee lock me up throw the key away
Take you from your roots when I shoot my ???
Now you're seven deuce inches beneath deep clay
Learn my truth before your chest go poof
Don't make me have to let them B.M.E goons loose
They don't care about yo mamma, f**k about your father
Murder your kids n***a no one lives, s***t's real
