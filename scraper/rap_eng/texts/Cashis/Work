[Intro]
King shit
Yeah, yo
Yeah
Who else we got?
You know who it is
Work
Sorry for the wait, my nigga
Work, work
I showed you niggas love with the work though
Ugh

[Chorus]
I know that it took me all day to bring the yay
But shit, I'm here now, hope you niggas read' to play
I been countin' money all day, what I'ma say?
Pull up on my niggas like, "Y'all wanna get paid?"

[Verse 1]
Quarterback the rollers, I'm Aaron Rogers with motors
Got the flake with no soda, make mockeries out of quotas
Give out eights to my soldiers, play with my paper, I smoke 'em
Keepin' a chopper loaded and got no time for no holsters
Get a half a slab, let Billy blow up the bag
Then hit the hood like a sav, drop anybody I ask
See, this ain't for beginners who scared to get it, I seen it
Crystal church and cathedrals for any tweaker that needs 'em
Get as much as you need and let 'em go buy the D
You wanna hustle for Gs? My nigga, let's get this cheese
Took a brick out the earth, came back home with a smirk
In border racks and solid packs he'll finally blow up

[Pre-Chorus]
We got work, holdin' down the turf, tax whoever serve
If you ain't gettin' your work from us, your business will get curbed
We got work, up and down the turf, cut some packs and swerve
'Bout to put the hood on lock when I send out all these birds

[Chorus]
I know that it took me all day to bring the yay
But shit, I'm here now, hope you niggas read' to play
I been countin' money all day, what I'ma say?
Pull up on my niggas like, "Y'all wanna get paid?"
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
Work, work, (Work)

[Bridge]
Work now, run that shit
We got work, bitch, it's Bogish
Work now, yeah when the cash in
We got work now, yeah
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 2]
I'm just a middle man nigga, rockin' cocaine, nigga
All these rats and these robbers got my finger on the trigger
You bound to end up dead or in the fed or somethin'
Sittin' 'round, ain't gettin' more than dough, what you scared or somethin'?
I was raised 'round convicts who stayed pullin' licks
Started off in this bitch with a mask and pistol grip
Runnin' off at the lip 'bout the grip he was makin'
Braggin' to his bitch 'cause he bringin' home the bacon
But his damn mouth flyin' off like a rocket
Caught him up in the parkin' lot and I robbed him
Was icy than a bitch, now he naked like a stripper
And wanna put some bread on my head like a skripper

[Verse 3]
Everything on twenty-fours, a thousand grams out the door
Pick a bird then let it go, that's eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Colder kis in the fold, never speakin' on the phone
The tweakers at the liquor sto', they fiendin' for that solid gold
Drop a tenner on the floor, they gladiator for that dope
Got this chrome Calico that eat you like an animal
Crush your skull like cantaloupes, they cannibals, ain't at a loss
Flood the block with hella dope and I'll be rich forever, folks
Stuntin' like I'm Puffy Combs, I took out a student loan
Bought a half a square of 'yo, now I got that product, bro
Come and get a lot of dope, nodders know, all day
I stop-and-go, shinin' like I'm MOP & GLO, pop that, bro

[Chorus]
I know that it took me all day to bring the yay
But shit, I'm here now, hope you niggas read' to play
I been countin' money all day, what I'ma say?
Pull up on my niggas like, "Y'all wanna get paid?"
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
Work, work, (Work)

[Verse 4]
Went J-O for some bucks, threw fifty in the stash
Went straight to the bank, had a hundred, no dash
Kid not, this ain't a game
My interscope got an aftermath that'll emulate
This shit's insane
Yeuch, I ain't been the same
Pull up, pull up, chill, I do damage
Fuck it, hold up, still
Keep it always hundred still
Break it, roll it, hit it, here (Whoo)
Never conceal snitches, doggin' my heels
Duck motherfucker, my gun duck for reals
Slay haters, death appeal
Get up out my face you fake imitators
Activate flame, I blaze instigators
Rectify, best if I
Let the nine blast instead of testify
Bullets to your dome and accessorize
I sully I defy
Against all odds, go hard 'til I die
Punk ass haters, meet the four-five

[Chorus]
I know that it took me all day to bring the yay
But shit, I'm here now, hope you niggas read' to play
I been countin' money all day, what I'ma say?
Pull up on my niggas like, "Y'all wanna get paid?"
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
We got work now, work now (Work now, work now)
Work, work, (Work)
