[Intro: Ca$his]
It's Bogish, though

[Chorus: Ca$his]
Yeah, I'm in the city, where your hoes at?
They be ridin' with the squad and you know that
We go hard, I'm in charge, nigga, throwback
A hundred large at them broads, nigga, show that
Woo, I'm in the city, where your hoes at?
They be ridin' with the squad and you know that
We go hard, I'm in charge, nigga, throwback
A hundred large at them broads, nigga, show that

[Verse 1: Ca$his]
I'm in the city, where your hoes at? (Where your hoes at?)
They in my motherfuckin' room with the Kodak (The Kodak)
Posin', chosen, sittin' like they frozen (Uh huh)
Pussy wide open, gonna keep it open for the squad (Woo)
This how we do it, bitch, we go in hard
Makin' money, let no motherfuckin' ho break us apart
If a nigga try to play me like a dummy then I spark
I ain't talkin' with that reefer, nigga, talkin' 'bout that creeper, nigga
Talkin' 'bout that price, my nigga, pull it off my dresser, nigga
Twenty-five light-its on my dresser, dresser, yes, sir
Twenty-five niggas look like flexus, priceless (Uh huh)
Sittin' in my hand, I'm like Dexter, yes, sir
Twenty-five bitches over twenty-five
Suckin' on my dick and it's over nine inches, listen
Everything bigger like a Texan
B-B-G, respect that, we only get them checks up, yes, sir
Bogish

[Chorus: Ca$his]
Woo, I'm in the city, where your hoes at?
They be ridin' with the squad and you know that
We go hard, I'm in charge, nigga, throwback
A hundred large at them broads, nigga, show that
Woo, I'm in the city, where your hoes at?
They be ridin' with the squad and you know that
We go hard, I'm in charge, nigga, throwback
A hundred large at them broads, nigga, show that

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
Time when the shit go down and we weigh that, we don't count that
Them blues, they come around it and they take that, then they out fast
Onions or a steak, it's like the outback, outback
But I'm never gonna move, no way, hell nah, 'cause Emilio is just 'bout cash
And I got a Dominican chick, she just want a visa, that immigrant shit
But I never be givin' her nada, I swear that I never be givin' her shit
But lately I'm gettin' so busy I swear that I barely be givin' her dick
In a minute she's hoppin' and trippin' and I'm gettin' rid of her privileges
Uh, yeah, ayy, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I gotta go get me a million, if Soulja Boy did it, how tough could it be?
I roll with a couple of killers, a couple of bankers, a couple of freaks
Lookin' back on the days I was younger, awake from the hunger of nothin' to eat
Damn, I told my mother I ain't never goin' broke again
These bitches open now, they soakin' they fallopeans
These motherfuckers playin' games with the hopes they win
Huh, who let these motherfuckers in? I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Ca$his]
I'm in the city, where your hoes at?
They be ridin' with the squad and you know that
We go hard, I'm in charge, nigga, throwback
A hundred large at them broads, nigga, show that
Woo, I'm in the city, where your hoes at?
They be ridin' with the squad and you know that
We go hard, I'm in charge, nigga, throwback
A hundred large at them broads, nigga, show that

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Drop a rack on her fuckin' head
A rack (Rack, rack), just drop a rack on her fuckin' head
Count it out and all hundreds on her fuckin' head
Drop a rack on the floor, watch her fuckin' dance
Woo, drop a rack on her fuckin' head
A rack (Rack, rack), just drop a rack on her fuckin' head
Drop it out and all hundreds on her fuckin' head
Drop a rack on the floor, watch her fuckin' dance
Woo, the bread circulatin' like ceilin' fans
We toastin' for the fact that we ain't gotta kill again
How I'm actin', smackin' niggas with Benjamins
Overreactin' with Jacksons, whack 'em and kill again
Fuck the pen, I don't even pen my lyrics, friend
I do this shit once again, from begin to end
We paper chasin', fuckin' hoes, we freaks like Damascus
Designer hoes doin' grimy shit in fancy places

[Chorus: Ca$his]
Pimpin', I'm in the city, where your hoes at?
They be ridin' with the squad and you know that
We go hard, I'm in charge, nigga, throwback
A hundred large at them broads, nigga, show that
Woo, I'm in the city, where your hoes at?
They be ridin' with the squad and you know that
We go hard, I'm in charge, nigga, throwback
A hundred large at them broads, nigga, show that
