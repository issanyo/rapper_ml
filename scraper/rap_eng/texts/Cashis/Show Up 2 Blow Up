[Intro]
Light up
You know how I get down
It's chill

[Verse 1]
I'm so fresh, ayy
Every car I'm in weed scented
I know eses that could write a book
Off we winnin' (Woo)
You the best bae
Gotta keep my mind off these women
I put Gucci on her coochie, now she G'd up (Now she G'd up)
She woody-woodpeckin' all on my tree trunk (Tree trunk)
Ha, baby, I so real
Tell me how it feel with my vehicle
Hit the dip, swing it side-to-side
Don't forget the pork with the potato
Now we makin' chip, off the Richt' (Woo)
We still run a label, still be labeled as a G
And all my fatals ain't no fable, now
Grab a zip and break it down
I so- I so awesome
Every week I smoke a pound
Silent in my house
But still my lady sayin', "Boy, you loud"
Known to fuck a beat up (I am)
Known to fuck a beat up (I am)
You fightin' everybody
We ain't known to take no re-ups (Aha)
Known to fuck a beat up (I am)
Known to fuck a beat up (I am)
You fightin' everybody
We ain't known to take no re-ups, yeah

[Chorus]
Show up just to blow up, show up just to blow up (Yeah)
Money on my mind like this chronic I'ma roll up (Get it)
Show up just to blow up, I show up just to blow up (Get it)
Smokin' out a scraper, big rings like a donut (Yeah)
Show up just to blow up, show up just to blow up (Get it)
Money on my mind like this chronic I'ma roll up (Yeah)
Show up just to blow up, show up just to blow up (Get it)
Smokin' out a scraper, big rings like a donut (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm so fresh, ayy, nigga don't test me
Nigga don't test me (Nigga don't test)
I am a genius, a mathematician
Mathematical wizard, I'll slide on your wisdom (Woo)
I'll shatter your prism, bitch
Get off my dick, I'm on my boss up shit (I'm a boss)
You won't do shit but be a vic
A stain, a lick, hardly a blip (Ya)
Forever on my square, bitch
And that's some rare shit
Drop racks on my kids, why?
Because I care, bitch (Bitch)
We ain't never been the same, why?
'Cause life ain't fair, bitch (Yeah)
Neither one of us is Fred
So why do you a-stare, bitch? Look
Also, also, also
You should not be flossin'
But he still be gully
Get to stuntin' and you lost it (Yeah)
Also, also, also
You should not be flossin'
Get to stuntin' and you lost it

[Chorus]
Show up just to blow up, show up just to blow up
Money on my mind like this chronic I'ma roll up (Ah)
Show up just to blow up, show up just to blow up
Smokin' out a scraper, big rings like a donut (Yeah)
Show up just to blow up, show up just to blow up (Ah)
Money on my mind like this chronic I'ma roll up (Ah)
Show up just to blow up, show up just to blow up (Ah)
Smokin' out a scraper, big rings like a donut (Yeah)
