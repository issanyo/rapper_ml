[Intro]
Yeah
It's Bogish and you know it
Light up

[Chorus]
Photogenic jiggy got the city in a frenzy
And the bitch that’s ridin' with me got that juicy so I'm biggie, uh
Low pro with the semi, my pockets hold fifty (Yup)
Stackin’ on twenties, the boy gets busy (Ayy)
Photogenic jiggy got the city in a frenzy
And the bitch that's ridin' with me got that juicy so I'm biggie, uh
Low pro with the semi, my pockets hold fifty (Yup)
Stackin' on twenties, the boy gets busy (Ayy)

[Verse]
I was with the whippin' til my wrist hurt
I know, most of y'all niggas never did work
Can't tat no tears on if you ain’t killed a man first
To me it’s fashionable to be a man first
You ain't wrapped tight, nigga, you been tampered
I’ma build an empire, man, you're son like Sanford
Nini in her Pampers, so I be goin' harder
I'm takin’ over my town, Nino and The Carter
A litty lituation, twenty shows in a month
It's time to check my weed farm, I re-up when I want
Nigga, you must be senile approachin' me with blunts
I'm only hittin' vape, bong or joints, so what the fuck? (What the fuck)

[Chorus]
Photogenic jiggy got the city in a frenzy
And the bitch that's ridin' with me got that juicy so I'm biggie, uh
Low pro with the semi, my pockets hold fifty (Yup)
Stackin' on twenties, the boy gets busy (Ayy)
Photogenic jiggy got the city in a frenzy
And the bitch that's ridin' with me got that juicy so I'm biggie, uh
Low pro with the semi, my pockets hold fifty (Yup)
Stacked and on twenties, the boy gets busy (Ayy)
