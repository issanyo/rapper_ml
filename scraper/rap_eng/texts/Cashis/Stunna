[Verse 1]
Walkin' off of Vicodin, somethin' Xanax, I'm likin' it
Take a couple pumps of the coach, now I can write again
Hennessey thrown up on the floor, OG I'm lightin' it
Takin' wax dabs till I'm certified higher shit
Jordan, I'm supplyin' to many ballas admirin'
Forever be alive to any sucka who tryin' him
Why's it them are liars, despising these phony guys
This side of me, I survived, thanks to Marshall I'm alive
Ain't your business, why G-O-D stay on my side
Though I'm gettin' high, livin' real until I die
In my sinners life, no regrets, I get it right
Before they out my lights, changed man, a sacrifice
So I never quit, fuck you bitch I hold my stripes
And I'm a lunatic, who gives a shit, let's die tonight
And mourning might do for my song, will I get sniped
Slaughter if you want, bet a part of me, I'll go to Christ

[Hook]
Summer on to summer, I'm a gunna
I'm tryna mind my business, you can run up if you wanna
It's money over bitches, yeah I'm always on the come up
And niggas hatin' on me I'm a mothafuckin' stunna, a stunna

[Verse 2]
Lately, I go crazy and my lady ain't gon' save me
And neither of my baby's, euthanasia for me, baby
These niggas ain't gon' break me, these niggas ain't gon' break me
Swear to God if you hatin', pussy you will never break me
I fell back to the samie I been givin' niggas lately
When I spray y'all with the K rounds, till you lay down almost shakin'
I can't say I'm in the dark cause I was there but niggas blazin'
I shot everything, Plaxico, Caijian, I'm not a racist
I stare in baby's faces, fuck their momma till they cave in
She givin' me the pussy but I'm fuckin' like I take it
Make it, face it, a problem, I'm waitin' patient for all you
Who give a fuck about stripes, one day is what they call you
Bitches shuttin they cell and I'm sayin' sacrifice all you
But racin' to be the greatest, I pray to God one won't call you
Catch me in the mall with my pistol I'm ballin' on you
Worse than before, I'm even more realer, Coppo's the motto, model

[Hook]
Summer on to summer, I'm a gunna
I'm tryna mind my business, you can run up if you wanna
It's money over bitches, yeah I'm always on the come up
And niggas hatin' on me I'm a mothafuckin' stunna, a stunna
