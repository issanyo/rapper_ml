[Intro / Ca$his]
Bogus
Fool lets crank it up

[Hook 1 / Mazzagardo]
If you want to split H.O's from a key
Then delivery me a bag full of money
Cause this the pure shit that they like
Get the fuck from my sight
If you ain’t buying tonight
Alright
Cause this shit ain't free
You can ticket in the street but not from me
Cause this the pure shit that they like
Get the fuck from my sight
If you ain't buying tonight
Alright

[Verse 1 / Mazzagardo]
He went up, (ugh) he went down, like a merry go round, chasing his tail around the magic circle of delusions, a case of chronic hallucinations, hail the almighty high one himself, with an undiscovered brew creating concoctions, a powerful detergent go and burn the fuel, drown in the poison, go on make a purchase, bribing nurses to stupify with the surplus, I just supplied the shit, with this I quit, give me the bottle back, come on one more sip, I love this shit but I hate it more, all I want is money bitch fuck being poor an excuse or reason think what you like, I got immunity like Rasputin dosing arsenic, isle thirty-three, we need an open car skit, crystals getting consumed it’s lingering of garlic, no tax for toxic, repulse in profit

You ever seen

[Verse 2 / Mazzagardo]
Sarcasm at its finest, your vision turns to blindness, adjusting iris the high just stroked a memory, using people as distractions, pulling out reactions, I don't wash rhymes, you can smell the odor when I combine compounds to bind pills, imma press that shit, so they can sell that shit, the feens need that hit they gonna get addicted to it so they come back and get that shit, man that's the mentality in this fucking lane I pick a bunch of different chems to balance potency and it explodes the brain, so when you touch into reality you ain't the same interrupting emotional growth till your insane, you let it run its course it will always continue undesired effects prominent on the menu in the end act as if it doesn’t suspend you, you acquired the taste so get some more in you
