[Verse 1]
Raised in the struggle
The drama I succumbed to
Made me a G
Some problems I gotta run through
Niggas can't walk on the blocks
That I done hung through
It's hard to have faith when nobody will trust you
Most Niggas dust you
Duck and scream fuck you
Now you realize the streets just don't love you
Remember seeing Rob a lot, and now he dead
We got the same face, my fate is
Misled
I was so caught up in ways to get bread
I let my brother's last days get wasted
Now I'm wondering, if we could trade places
But the strength from you
Got me bound to make it
I'm surrounded by family and friends
Knockin' Monique
Pushin' a rock, Countin' my cheese
This ain't for me
To your memory, I light up a flame
You're the reason my success came (I miss
You)

[Hook]
Dark Nights, Dirt road drinkin' Hennessy (drinkin' Hennessy)
What's
The reason you niggas gon' remember me? (What's the reason)
I am who I am
Cause my niggas live in me
What's the reason you niggas gon' remember me?

[Hook pt. 2]
Dark nights, dirt road drinkin' Hennessy
What's the reason
You niggas gon' remember me?
I am who I am cause my niggas live in
Me
That's the reason you niggas gon' remember me

[Verse 2]
Me and you was a team, you was a G
Sentenced by me, to live on these streets
I let my words bring life to the beat
Feel the story of a righteous MC
Could it bring brightness for me?
Daylight, tryina' dodge three strikes
Cause post partum depression done took your life
I was caught up in my own pain
Couldn't see yours
Now I'm placed in a spot where I gotta grieve more
Everything happens for a reason the tell me
So I think about it all while I'm leaf inhaling
It coulda been me, you sacrificed it all
So I could run around the town
Screamin' SHADY
My lifestyle crazy, my lifestyle made me see
I never lost you at all, and lately
To your memory I light up a flame
You're the reason my success came (I miss you)
[Hook 1 and 2]
Moral of the story, be thankful for life
Hard times build character, you faced with the right
Faced with the wrongs, tryina get faith through a song
My struggles enable me to move on
You can dwell in your own pity
Or rise through the ashes
And gain the focus to be alive with a passion
Cause a gang of my loved ones been blasted
I pray for the day that I be in a casket
I never knew one day, I'd be Ca$his
Rappin' 'bout things I did through ski-maskin'
Hard times give me the strength
To do what I feel
Keepin' yall alive through songs is keepin' it real
I'm pushin' a rock, countin' my cheese
Realizin' this ain't the life for me
And to your memory, I light up a flame
You're the reason my success came

I miss you
[Hook 1 and 2X]
