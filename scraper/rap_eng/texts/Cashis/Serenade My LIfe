[Intro]
Yeah,uh,Shady!
It's Ca$his
Serenade My Life
Shady!

[Verse 1: Ca$his]
Focusing on opening
Emotions that I hold within
Surrounded by my inner demons
Thinking I should roll with them
I don't wanna go to hell
I don't wanna go to jail
But I wanna kill a man
Maybe I should kill myself
I've been sittin'
Contemplating suicidal situations
Now I'm placed in that position
To abide the whole nation
And I'm spottin' n*ggas hating
I'm just watchin'
Being patient
Praying for my own existence
Some say I'm a mental patient
Drugs is taking over me
Sorrow is controlling me
Follow my blind heart
Tomorrow run the coldest streets
I've been cryin' for a week
Will is weak,can I speak
Without someone judging me?
Pushin' me and shovin' me
Mama if you love me
You will really let me go
But I live for a cause I don't really know
Am I wrong if I cry?
But I can't cause in time
For the truth in my life
I will be crucified

[Hook X2]
I'm sitting back patience (patience)
I'm ready and waitin' (waitin')
For my homicide
Serenade my life
And I can't escape it (scape it)
I'm ready and waitin' (waitin')
For my homicide
Serenade my life

[Verse 2:Ca$his]
Conversating with my brother's spirit
I hear him saying
Strangers in the dark, lurking
You just gotta feel them 'em waiting
I ain't eating
I ain't sleeping
Close the door and I ain't breathing
Death is running over me
My conscious is showing me
Ever since my early teens
Knew this was my destiny
World gotta feel my pain
I'm no longer questioning
When, where, or how I will
Happen for when I get killed
Never take my voice away
Through record sales how I live
View me as the realest nigga
Poppin' pills, drinkin' liquor
Sucked into the pressure makes me turn to my aggression
Got a lot a homies dead
Buried all in my head
Cry inside every time
I never stop to read my hands
How could I fear a man?
I've never been near a man
All ya'll fraudulent
You don't like it, kill me then
I've never been near a man
All ya'll fraudulent
You don't like it, kill me then

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3:Ca$his]
Sunk into a sea of self-misery
Being dealt
My only fear is lyrically
Me not being felt
Much hard, much smarter
More true, fuck you
No matter what the conversation
This is what it comes to
Imagine staring at your friend
Feeling they don't love you
You ride till the end
But they feel they above you
I got a chosen few
Name my homies in the song
Defy all odds
More for me when I'm gone
I try to be a better man
Baby if you understand
My love for you is true
But I ain't really love myself
See nobody wanna help
Better off to end this way
Talking to my friends
Weed, G's and Hennessy
Came from a broken home
Smoke till the dope is gone
Listen to the words homie
This ain't really just a song
Came from a broken home
Smoke till the dope is gone
Listen to the words homie
This ain't really just a song

[Hook X2]

[Outro:Ca$his]
Serenade my life
Shady Records on Ca$his
This is real shit
Serenade my life
I ain't scarred, I ain't runnin'
I'm waitin', come get me nigga
Live as a man
Die as a man
Yup!
