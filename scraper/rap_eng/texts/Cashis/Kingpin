[Intro]
Coalition

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm in my old school rollin'
Cocaine around me
Bout to cross the state line in Davidson County
In the back of the projects is where they found me
I think we need a flood
So I told my plug to drown me
Swim, niggas!
A black tee with a pair of Gucci Timbs, nigga
And you ain't get it from me
You got it from him nigga
A couple fiends who been waiting on they checks
You been short all month
So you gone take what you get
Chattanooga been shopping in the A
But not no more
'Cause I'm back distributing the Yay
My price is lower
Knoxville ain't had a deal with the pills in a long time
Now here it is motherfuckers and I want mine
Some Memphis niggas that I know that just jack
They don't know you, they on you so Gotti an' them gone handle that (Ayy)
One thing that's a fact niggas know
That when it come to fuckin' with the pack
We just get it and go (Ten a key nigga)

[Hook: June B]
I'm a Kingpin
You know I'm sitting on top and
I got the merch if you wanna go shoppin'
You can get it for the low
I promise everything will be a go
That's why My city love me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everytime I come around
I swear to god my city love me
(Say they love me, yeah yeah)
Say they love me in my city
I'm a Kingpin

[Verse 2: Ca$his]
Belligerent time, ignorant rhymes, manipulated by crime
I'ma baby from the '80s, coke crazy and grind
ACP protect me from who blockin' my shine
Flippin' green like white six-figure delight
Same clothes for a week but then you look at my ride
And see everything you dream you can be in yo life
Straight tippin'
Moving brown and white, Blake Griffin
And I'm lob city banging, busta, set trippin'
A youngin with a quarter mill
After bail and legal fees back broke for real
I came right back like nice crack
For good scratch from good packs
Streets is watchin'
That's hood facts
Jooks and the crooks
My 45 I could flip off a look
Live by the script of a book
Hustle hard, no shook
Business over here
'Cause it's heavy with the army
Control like Ghandi
Til' I'm gone like Gotti (I'm gone)

[Hook: June B]
I'm a Kingpin
You know I'm sitting on top and
I got the merch if you wanna go shoppin'
You can get it for the low
I promise everything will be a go
That's why My city love me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everytime I come around
I swear to god my city love me
(Say they love me, yeah yeah)
Say they love me in my city
I'm a Kingpin

[Verse 3: Arez Cobain]
I remember late nights with my baby mama back in highschool
We was Bonnie and Clyde
Ridin' dirty with the white tool
She got me on my feet
Helped me cop my first O
Thought the love was deep 'cause she stood by when all the world seemed artificial
Guess the love was unofficial 'cause her confessions blew a whistle
Had me singin' different tunes
Sealed my heart inside a tomb
So I can never love again
Its probably better I assume
Put my heart into the hustle
For my lil' man's came out the womb
Now I'm only get older and wiser as a hustla
Snatch a lily pad to write a verse on Budweisers
What you know about pink slips and bills being past due
Kids on the phone wish you was home
They always ask you
Daddy when you coming home?
I miss ya
When can I see ya?
Blowin' kisses through the phone
Hoping and praying
That they can forgive me like I was in jail or locked up
'Cause everytime I pop up
I got gifts and toys for the time we lost
Fuck

[Hook: June B]
I'm a Kingpin
You know I'm sitting on top and
I got the merch if you wanna go shoppin'
You can get it for the low
I promise everything will be a go
That's why My city love me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everytime I come around
I swear to god my city love me
(Say they love me, yeah yeah)
Say they love me in my city
I'm a Kingpin
