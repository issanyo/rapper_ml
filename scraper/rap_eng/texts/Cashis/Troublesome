[Intro]
I’m living in this world…
Trouble’s all around
I try and I try
Tryina get a place to live in centuries
I’m living in this world…
Trouble’s all around
Tryina get a place to live in centuries drive by

[Verse 1]
Now if you drink the liquor, I’mma turn to a alias
Babies on the block, posted up with my niggas
Time of my life, with the women we was chillin
They was takin big packages deep into the ceiling
Now I’m at the funeral, wishin it didn't happen
Don't know how long ago but you gone without snapping
Sadness, the Madness, my life as a savage
This is real pain in my brain, I’m crashing down
But I can’t stay in a race to come up, know you want it this way
Laws don’t play and the songs pay
I be on my way to the cage in the grave
Life is to be made, I’ll no longer be a slave to the trade
But the true dude shall remain, prayin
Excel on a good day, I think I’m bout the dead homies from the hood mane
I hear them say

[Hook]
Trouble’s all around me
Day by day (day by day)
Hidin in temptation, seeing it’s around (it’s always here for me man)
Trouble’s all around me
Day by day (day by day)
Hidin in temptation, seeing it’s around

[Verse 2]
Now it seems bright lights keep scaring me
I got to make never let her bust a worry G
Still stand at the table see
Shedding tears for my pears, don’t embarrass me on everything
Move scally cuz my urban survival’s like therapy
The rivals want to bury me
I seen the sea, round the way I’m amazing
He ain’t travel in bang and I pray I’mma change
Choices for the future, I remain the same brother that I used to, feel ma pain
I ain’t never learned life without struggle and strain
And I am bout to hit the block and got to hustle again
When you see me in the street I’m kickin rounds in the rain
Just you I’m doing I to you until my brother the same
These suckers aren’t true and I ain’t withe em they lames
That’s why I’m whilin with my pockets, speedin out in the rain nigga

[Hook]
