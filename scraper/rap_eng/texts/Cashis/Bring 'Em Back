[Intro]
Euthanasia, come die with me. You feel me. Let's go

[Verse 1]
My brother died and I can't do nothing to bring him back
When I was bring him beef he brought with me and brought me straps
Back to back in Cadillac smoking herb and
He a Vice Lord I'm 74 we put him work in
One thing is certain and two things for sure
He is the realest and he never got to die no more
But you dying is the reason all this crying for
I finding all your enemies take them all to war
You got killed by some fiends and now I'm set the score
I see him murdered in my dreams hurting me some more
Three in the morning and I am falling down on the floor
Your vision fading from my mind I'm screaming give me more
I feel your spirit boy hear me thorough my lyrics or
Be there with me when I am knocking up on heaven's door
[Bridge]
Nothing's change since you slain but a bigger trap
All on my brain wishing I could bring the Gilla back

[Hook]
Bring em back if I could
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back back back back
Bring him back only if I could man
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back

[Verse 2]
My uncle died and I can't do nothing to bring him back
I saw a vision of him dying and I woke up that
I saw my momma crying tears trying to hold 'em back
Telling us kids go upstairs or head up out the back
By how my mom reacted I start sensing that
In my dreams it was real should I mention that
The killer got ten years but we haven't forgat
You were supposed to be his friends but you clipped him that
23 years on this planet you took him wack
I got you tatted on my arm and I ain't looking back
Bogish boy till the world blow and its the pack
With 30 shots hit him no wonder why I'm always strapped
A cold world when your home boys peal your cap
But you got sons and loved one now grown and strapped
[Bridge]
Nothing's change since you slain but a bigger trap
All on my brain wishing I could bring the Gilla back

[Hook]
Bring em back if I could
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back back back back
Bring him back only if I could man
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back

[Verse 3]
My lady died and I can't do nothing to bring her back
She brought me real love when I'd never heard of that
I showed her too much in coming from to go I'm at
Suicidal homicidal when I live in fact
Daily you saw me riding against my brothers homicide
Brought me a baby girl and shelter me from suicide
My name tatted on your arm that's how I recognize
My lady lying under white trap dead to I
Our baby nine months old and I am terrified
It ain't no hope for me my life was only you and I
Now is nine years make 10 in July
I can't cry tears hold them till I drown aside
I know you are mad I been struggling with these diamonds right
I pray that God would take me to you laying down at night
When I am awake I'm on the couch with the pill bottle high
And hit the streets and do goony things till I'm gonna die
Since you have gone it's been nothing but this trauma I
Remain your man forever that's on our daughter's life
Nothing is change since you slain but a bigger trap
Wish I could change it all but I can only give rap

[Hook]
Bring em back if I could
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back back back back
Bring him back only if I could man
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back

[Outro]
If I could I would trust me
But I'll be there soon don't trip
You'll find out from all these suckers
When they are dying
