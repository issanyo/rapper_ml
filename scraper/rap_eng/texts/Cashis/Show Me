[Verse 1]
Sick of sitting, staring at this phone
Hoping you call me, I'm alone
Telling my bros I'm going out
That's when you call me, I'm on hold now
Damn
I'm foolishly coming through
I'mma do it cause I'm with this shits
When it comes to you like
I need a baker to make it sweeter
On life support, don't wanna end it, you hear the beeper
That pussy power it cowers me to the shower
Kick and licking you forever, it feels like fucking hours

[Verse 2]
Girl 'bout the last time
We argued, fussing and fighting
We said we'd never see each other again
It hurts so bad, we can't even be friends

[Hook]
Now we on the kitchen counter
Making love on the kitchen counter
Tryna make up for the past
Tryna make up for the past
Gon', gon', gon' head girl
Gon', gon', head girl
Gon', gon', head girl
Show me, show me
Show me how much you miss me
Show me how much you need me
Show me how much you care
Show me, na na na
Show me how you love me
When you fuck me like that
You can show me how you love me
When you fuck me like that
Girl show me how you, show me how you
Girl show me how you, show me how you
You can show me how you love me
When you fuck me like that
Girl show me how you, show me how you
Girl show me how you, show me how you

[Verse 3]
Make you point and wiggle like a stripper
Girl I ain't worried, I'm just rich
And but I stay ahead of any nigga
Tryna take my bitch
Sipping [?] and vodka mix it
With the lemon in the cup
We just fighting for some fuck
But that's still my bitch
Wine bottles, flying coach
On the table by the dishes
Like potatoes and tomatoes
Any deeper it'd be fatal for you
Lay when you snooze
At the ahhs and the oohs
That was better than forever
But a night with the dudes, let's ride

[Verse 4]
Last time you threw a bottle of wine
Right throw the window when I came through
I like that angry love, that's when the sex good
Miss how I leave you alone with me yeah
Got you naked, taking pictures
Like you did seem like a stripper
Both turnt up off this liquor, ooh

[Hook]
Gon', gon', gon' head girl
Gon', gon', head girl
Gon', gon', head girl
Show me, show me
Now we on the kitchen counter
Making love on the kitchen counter
Tryna make up for the past
Tryna make up for the past
Gon', gon', gon' head girl
Gon', gon', head girl
Gon', gon', head girl
Show me, show me
Show me how much you miss me
Show me how much you need me
Show me how much you care
Show me, na na na
Show me how you love me
When you fuck me like that
You can show me how you love me
When you fuck me like that
Girl show me how you, show me how you
Girl show me how you, show me how you
You can show me how you love me
When you fuck me like that
Girl show me how you, show me how you
Girl show me how you, show me how you
