(intro Ca$his)
"IN THIS LIFE OF CRIME MY MINDS DESIGNED... TO WIN
WE GOTTA STOP THE VIOLENCE
COS WHATS THE REASON... WE ALL LOSING OUT HERE
HOLD YOUR HEAD, GET YOUR BREAD THO...
(UHH)
REMEMBER WHAT IT IS...
SUCCESS IS DEFINED BY WHAT YOU WANT...
BUT DON'T LOSE YOUR LIFE TO GAIN SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
USE YOUR BRAIN
USE YOUR BRAIN"

Verse 1. illustrait...
"Mother crying tears
Her child sleeps/deceased in a coffin/
Tears shed she lost her offspring/   {​think bout it}​...adlib
Tell me there ain't a problem/ you  dont get to see a child blossum
Now i have a dream like Martin Luther King
Seek the peace/ what our future brings/
Guardian angels be/ spreading there wings/
I feel the need/ the sooner we think/
Bout consequences and actions/
Sooner we have compassion/
Truthfully
Peace is what our future needs/
No more blood shed on streets/
Your minds the weapon thats what im tryna teach/
Make the right choices but can't you see/
Shots off... (shots fired sound)
Families mourn black ties and funerals/
Another loss...
All this gang lifestyle is more than a rumour mill/
Taking the precious gift of life that was once beautiful"

Verse 2. Ca$his

"12 shots to the head young man dead/
Slang two to the brain, they kill him for his gold chain/
(2 SHOTS)
They killed him cos he learned to bang/
That young boy was my cuz tho/
That young boy was my cuz tho/
My auntie crying blood in the rain/
My auntie crying can feel her pain/
Its worse than those hunger pains/
This is scenes from my younger days/
Curses, verses, that leads to nothing but hearses/
Got my family up in churches/
For the first time like my first rhyme/
Designed my life of crime/
I look up in the sky and yell why/
Why we gotta stop it"

Verse 3. illustrait

"violence can we see a future without violence/
Seen so much many suffer in silence/
Pulling on heartstrings like violins/
Families mourning losses crying
Praying dear lord wising it would stop/
Stop the violence/
God, choices we make it ain't all hip hop
Hearing the sirens/
Another lost sheep from a flock/
No survival/
Begging forgiveness from god/
Theres no honour in death at all/
Saying you now live with regrets/
When a family lives with a death/
Hope it eats  your concience/
Hope you expose the accomplice/
Still no statements correspondence/
Nothing related if honest
On the lives lost i make this solum promise
Guns down no weapon shall prosper
Guns down whats the possesion taught us
Stray bullet (gun popping off sound) death of a toddler"


Verse 4. Illustrait

You got blood on your hands now face it
Hope your pleading 2 god
Rubbing the rosary beads raw
Putting faith on a cross
For gods sake when does it stop
When were in a black suit n tie
When were the ones that sadly died
When our families the ones to cry
When our families the ones to cry
Only then will we hear a final reply
A shot fired (gun shot)   single bullet whizzing by
Caught in the corner of my eye
One shot (fired gun) one bullet
Another loss how stupid
Mistaken identity ruthless
To a jesus piece turnt judas
Truth is guns should be banished
Saying that poverty did the damage
Sorry won't reprimand what happend
Im tryna analyze the weapon handled
Tryna verbalise the scandal
Going through channels
Turning tvs off seen enough
I'm writing my words with black ink
So it cuts real deep n makes you think...
(outro) Illustrait

"why is it we always gotta mourn a loss
Why is it karma comes with. a cost
If u don't wear armor u take the shots
Happens all the time can the guns drop"
