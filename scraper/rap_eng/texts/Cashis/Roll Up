[Hook]
Smokin on blows in all 3 rows
If I get it low I can call in mo
And I got hoes and all new clothes
Everything I own less than 2 days old

[Verse 1]
Gonna find my career is too
When your dick is long, yea ho know you
Like my word be the scripture, everything true
Used to million dollar figures, what the fuck they call you?
A million dollar nigga screamin blood all blue
6 points to the left, do what I want to
Now Bogus smoking sips by the bees
They ain’t no Gucci but G’s on me
Baby I’ve been chillin with my lady when I ain’t with the crew
But I thought this was on my crazy case, I run into you
Bitch nigga… death round the corner
For you 2 words, quote it’s over
Plenty round clip on the shoulder
When I’m in the Rover, talkin with 50 soldiers
Laughin at the rosas, all the hoes chose us
Soon as I roll up, bitches start roll up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Straight OG, when you see me
I’m so ruling, Popo can’t see
My eyes can’t hide this potency
You’re the BBC, I’m the BBG
Smoking with my rich in the whip
Kool-Aid blow, she put down the drow with smoke on my dick
No seats, no sticks, real shit
If you ain’t OG get up on my whip bitch
Ain’t no love with yo low budge
You smoke humble, get the fuck high
Out every day, I have myself a little smoke
I already know, rolled down 4 miles, crouts
Big up in your ghetto, peanut butter beam out
Licking sticking suckin, that’s what stress is all about
I’m tryina smoke a quarter pound of foreign – passin out
I’m about 3-6 down now

[Hook]

[Outro]
In case you didn’t know, it’s Bogus baby
In case you didn’t know, it’s Bogus baby
In case you didn’t know, it’s Bogus baby
In case you didn’t know, it’s Bogus baby
