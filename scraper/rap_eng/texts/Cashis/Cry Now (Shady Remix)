[Intro: Obie Trice]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady, Shady
OOOOOOOOOOOOO-MIIIIIIIIIX ("Cryyyy")
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a ho's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
From the same turf as you's, nigga, what nerve of you's nigga
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit, nigga
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's but a nigga is on board

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga
Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissing you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Than clapping down bangers meant, for entertainment, yeah

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
You copy?

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)
