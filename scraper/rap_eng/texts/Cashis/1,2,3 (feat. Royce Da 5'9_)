Natti, he run this motherfucker...
Capo, I run this motherfuckerrr...
Royce, he in this motherfuckaah...
Bogish, let's go!

This one of them thumpers, you ain't corny then them bump us
Bitch you horny, then fuck us, let's roll
I, I, got my Gucci on, it's so on
Whiling in the Benz with a big body, on the way to a bitch party
Me Classy, Capo Cashis, Rikanatti
It's probly a bunch motherfuckin tough actors but I lump your face
To who it concerns, we even do the prosecuting attorneys, we jump on your case
Come out the leather jacket, picture me backin down from a rapper
Not for nothing, never happened, I'll be forever clappin'
Bring it back down...
You horny, then fuck us, let's roll
I, I, check it out my, weapon out now
Simmer down now, better bow now
I, I'm ending all the bullshit ending with a full clip
Dressed like a preacher, shootin' from the pulpit
All a nigga really needs is a little bit
I'm ignorant, I'm stupid
I'm too sick, I'm too big
One nigga, you know it
I'm ignorant, I'm stupid
I'm too sick, I'm too big
One nigga, one nigga, one nigga you know do it

Is that how many suckers wanna come get me
I promise you can't, none of ya'll fuck with me
I stand over the body with a M16
I'll lay the crowd down like...

I'm goin' in, using my motherfucking brain
And control the flow, these other rappers is losin' again
I'm talkin' big shit to niggas who be much bigger
Capo loco, runnin' with a 4-4
Better call the po-po, coming out the block so they go, wanna low jo
So cold in the snow when I'm low low
Your ho wanna go loc, with a young Folk
Got shooters in the hole, surely ya'll loosing never seen no Uzi's
They got pistols coming too late, on my side watch out with groupies
Gotta gang of kids, and a lot of pussy
Push me, I ain't no rookie
Wrap my bill in a plastic bag
Pound your ass and I break your cookie
Sending my brochure, look like suki
I'm locked behind bars like Suke
You know me, west to the west coast, ain't no nigga outdo me
We let you out like today, this thick and I'm out that today
They lurchin', lunchin' any busta
Say they gon do to me, something
Nothing, I'm the wrong one to be fucked with
Call cops out and I owe you nothing
Say something else, next time I'll come back dumpin' nigga

Is that how many suckers wanna come get me
I promise you can't, none of ya'll fuck with me
I stand over the body with a M16
I'll lay the crowd down like...

All 22 clips, niggas can't move this
Fo 5th, no kicks, smoked with new bitch
Abusive acoustics, seducing you through this music
BBG is the movement, we multi-lateral moving
Suckers slump from the shootin'
Now what the fuck was he doin?
Bitch aye, bring yo AK for the melee
Saws up on the bang just like Dre day
I done moved pure right by the KKK, all work but no play
I'm on the grind now overtime, I goin' prime, I'm rollin' high
And if yo punk ass rapper fuck with me, then he will surely die
Mortified of my presence, cause I'm born to ride my essence
So my Eazy E shit quick to tell, that bitch no more questions
The flyest, and the freshest, yes I'm feeling like the best
You better get my respect before I'm clearing out your set
When I'm airing out this Tek, like your bitch get you wet
I take a hit and then I jet, I smoke you right by your projects
When I'm airing out this Tek, like your bitch get you wet
I take a hit and then I jet, I smoke you right by your projects
Bitch nigga

Is that how many suckers wanna come get me
I promise you can't, none of ya'll fuck with me
I stand over the body with a M16
I'll lay the crowd down like...
