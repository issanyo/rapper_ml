[Intro]
King shit
Yeah, yo
Yeah
Who else we got?
You know who it is
Work
Sorry for the wait, my nigga
Work, work
I showed you niggas love with the work though
Ugh
I know that it took me all day to bring the yay
But shit, I'm here now, hope you niggas read' to play
I been countin' money all day, what I'ma say?
Pull up on my niggas like, "Y'all wanna get paid?"

[Verse 1]
Quarterback the rollers, I'm Aaron Rogers with motors
Got the flake with no soda, make mockeries out of quotas
Give out eights to my soldiers, play with my paper, I smoke 'em
Keepin' a chopper loaded and got no time for no holsters
Get a half a slab, let Billy blow up the bag
Then hit the hood like a sav, drop anybody I ask
See, this ain't for beginners who scared to get it, I seen it
Crystal church and cathedrals for any tweaker that needs 'em
Get as much as you need and let 'em go buy the D
You wanna hustle for Gs? My nigga, let's get this cheese
Took a brick out the earth, came back home with a smirk
In border racks and solid packs he'll finally blow up
We got work, holdin' down the turf, tax whoever serve
If you ain't gettin' your work from us, your business will get curbed
We got work, up and down the turf, cut some packs and swerve
'Bout to put the hood on lock when I send out all these birds

[Verse 2]
Trip my ho, nigga
Got it wholesale, Team Costco, nigga
Fiends been with us 'cause our rocks smoke bigger
Right there on the corner by the pothole fishin'
My office door never close, twenty-four and some mo'
Got tree, got booze, got snow
Got blow, got pills, got 'dro like I'm T.I. right hand man
Let's go, trappin' down with the back nineteen
Come from The Bay where they scream out, "Yee!"
And either that bitch has gotta pay that fee
We don't trick for no whores, they cater to a P
Twenty-eight for the P, no shake, no seeds
Everything for the low, for the blow and D
In the right place at the right time with the right rhyme
Who's to say? You can make me rich
Get 'em, go, go, go, go
I'm gone, they coppin' like they grocery shoppin'
Bro, he got ounces, if I ever see the top, bottom
Straight probably have 'em all in, got nothin' to lose
I got somethin' to prove, hustle hard like a grown up
And blow up, sho' 'nuff, this hundo uncut
This might make hte price go up, sho' 'nuff
D-boy, lookin' out for them decoys
Memoirs of a D-boy, previously employed
Wasn't makin more, now then, take it to the boys
Drama, death to informants
Got my spider sense tinglin'
Please watch how you speak around him
And I always make 'em take a hit
Before they spend, no fraud, ayy

[Chorus]
Break a bag, break a bag, break a bag (Break a bag)
Still a sav, spill that cash on your ass, nigga
Break a bag, break a bag, break a bag (Yeah)
Still a sav, spill that cash on your ass, nigga
Hundred racks or more, fuck a nigga life up
This is for the lighters know all your whore bitches like us
Hundred racks or more, fuck a nigga life up
This is for the lighters know all your whore bitches like us
Hundred racks or more, fuck a nigga life up
This is for the lighters know all your whore bitches like us

[Verse 3]
I'm just a middle man nigga, rockin' cocaine, nigga
All these rats and these robbers got my finger on the trigger
You bound to end up dead or in the fed or somethin'
Sittin' 'round, ain't gettin' more than dough, what you scared or somethin'?
I was raised 'round convicts who stayed pullin' licks
Started off in this bitch with a mask and pistol grip
Runnin' off at the lip 'bout the grip he was makin'
Braggin' to his bitch 'cause he bringin' home the bacon
But his damn mouth flyin' off like a rocket
Caught him up in the parkin' lot and I robbed him
Was icy than a bitch, now he naked like a stripper
And wanna put some bread on my head like a skripper

[Verse 4]
I got work, nigga I got major work
I got OG, I got cookies and you know I got that purp
It's perico like it's legal, bitch I learned that in the dirt
Then I hit my nigga Ca$his and he hit me with that work
Rah, woo, see this just the shit I gotta do
Movin' state to state, shit too easy, I just gotta do it
Money keep on comin', I should teach a class on how to do it
They say, "Mr. Major, you so major, teach us how to do it"
Woo, you get to work and then you flip that shit
Then you double up and cut it up and then become the plug
I be with them niggas, yeah, we hustle 'til the sun come up
Made niggas always put in work, that's why they bitin' us

[Chorus]
Break a bag, break a bag, break a bag (Break a bag)
Still a sav, spill that cash on your ass, nigga
Break a bag, break a bag, break a bag (Yeah)
Still a sav, spill that cash on your ass, nigga
Hundred racks or more, fuck a nigga life up
This is for the lighters know all your whore bitches like us
Hundred racks or more, fuck a nigga life up
This is for the lighters know all your whore bitches like us
Hundred racks or more, fuck a nigga life up
This is for the lighters know all your whore bitches like us

[Verse 5]
Went J-O for some bucks, threw fifty in the stash
Went straight to the bank, had a hundred, no dash
Kid not, this ain't a game
My interscope got an aftermath that'll emulate
This shit's insane
Yeuch, I ain't been the same
Pull up, pull up, chill, I do damage
Fuck it, hold up, still
Keep it always hundred still
Break it, roll it, hit it, here (Whoo)
Never conceal snitches, doggin' my heels
Duck motherfucker, my gun duck for reals
Slay haters, death appeal
Get up out my face you fake imitators
Activate flame, I blaze instigators
Rectify, best if I
Let the nine blast instead of testify
Bullets to your dome and accessorize
I sully I defy
Against all odds, go hard 'til I die
Punk ass haters, meet the four-five
