[Verse 1]
Teardropz and closed caskets, runnin through my last days
OG duts all in ashtray
Haters got me in they sights, the devil on they side
I’mma ride forever, whatever fuck I’m down to die
If I got hard life, my wife is my mama
My mother full of shame cuz her son is a gunna
My father respect me and I was down low with the young snow white coke like I kill it
I’m a changed man for a while but my 40 pound man to the ground if it’s ever going down
Punk bitch, I’m not to be fucked with
Knock out by cuspy front kick from my own pimp
Hoes don’t hit me for bread, they want dick
Best O’s in your life tonight what I get, truth’s be
Like I’m sucka sick, I’m be rid if you stackin on your liquors
Brothers purpin to them fix, bitch

[Hook]
I got my lights off, I’m in the Chevy
And the stripes lined out, fuck it I’m ready then
When I see your man, I’mma bury him
The stripes lined out, I’m getting ready then

[Verse 2]
Look, you probly cock a doodle doo on yourself when you see me slide in that Chevy
My clip is taller than Snoop Dogg
Burner got kicked like karate
This shot it leaves on me, holes on your body probly the size of a bowling ball
Blue bandana, old dog when I’m rolling on
Boy, I’m just showing off
Take your money, BM after cash and I blow it off
Wonder where I am dog? My aim is frozen
I put a dime on your back, call it the more, the rosen
I’m in the whippin them struck, you niggas look like you frozen
I’m fin the click and I clack, my bullets said you was chosen
WOOH, we ridin round with clique pal
Shots of high, you sure look like a DJ Quick Crall
That crowd around to hear the greatest of em
I said the boy the truth, even his haters love him
My killer salute, it take no days off
And now it’s gang time, turn the lights on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slim The Mobster]
You know my gun on my waist and my only fear is a case
Made a mill and I owe it all to my safe
I’m embracing the block and the new drop, sitting on fresh shoes
I’m cupping guns by the crates so my niggas keep it fresh too
Nigga and I will not lose
F-in natures for your hyenas, give your ass the blues
Faith tryina study my moves
They working on indictments on my crew uh
Yea, so the money we keep laundering
And hide it in places that they would never find it in
And if they lootin we know somebody went bitch on us, snitched on us
Cuz they don’t wanna see us that rich homie
Yea, my wrist sick on em
Before they know it, fuck around and now the 5th on em
Fuck around, I get you knocked off
No calls, mad song but the lights on

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Teardropz and closed caskets
Yea dead mourn the bastards
How could they blame me of the ratchet?
I’m slippin out control, as mean as the Cashis
Blasting out the black skin, masked assassin
You wanna row with me? Bitch, get yo ass in
This thug passion, smoke while mack shit
6 bedroom, beu boo too, dancing in the mansion
The set that gives the pool dick in you til you passin
Yea, vocal chords on screen that kitty cat on swole
Couchy all creamed out
2 guns but each chain, got one for each reign
2012 I get rich or die but it’s fame
