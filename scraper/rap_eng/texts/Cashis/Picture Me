[Intro]
Yes
Picture me nigga
Yea
Right now
On some other shit
When you see me

[Hook]
I’ve been drinkin out the bottle while I’m standing in the yacht
20 thousand in my pockets, I ain’t even lift a dollar
Haters tryina hold me down but I be riding to the top
And I’m smoking what I want, either it’s cool with you or not
Got your bitches all around me, make me wanna pull the top
Got them jerz about by warmin and she ballin out the lot
Haters tryina hold me down but I be riding to the top
And I’m smoking what I want, either it’s cool with you or not

[Verse 1]
Anything on me but bitch it ain’t free
Head on the ocean, getting laid on the beach
Smoking out the dry, hot box in the street
On my tell me bullshit, I don’t stop for police (never)
A beast on street, cock hack to the east
From tonight til I die, niggas ride, let it be
4-5 on the side of the Jeep, got that Bentley on my knee
Take my foot up off that pedal, put his brain on the seat
They see Pac in the flesh, I’m more than bitches wanna see
But I’m game, God’s grace and now where finished, set me free
And these haters talkin shit like I ain’t who they got to see
And I ain’t scared of catching body, who these niggas wannas be?
Now I’m beggin on my knees, askin God don’t let it be
But I’m a G and to the end of me keep it ever just simple
To the bullet’s rhythm, the pistol triggers and Hennessey
I bet they would remember me ballin, I fill your memory

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Getting money, bitch I’m never stuck balling in the moment
I’m smoking every minute, shoot a killer for the tome
And I ain’t looking for you niggas, top down – you don’t want it
Keep that 40 on me solo, rolling – I don’t need no homies
I’m riding over phonies, oh my God I get this money
And these problem niggas front me, jump hard I keep it gunning
Your bitches say I’m stunting and I ain’t even starting stunting
And they ain’t see me, 50 G blow on my V like it was nothing
I’m jumpin 90 cups to what these be the navigators
See I keep tracking all my stacks, I keep it cracking like I’m B
I feel the haters wanna be like me, I’m realer than I say I be
Been working all the night, suckers shot and saw me changing it
No lames gonna hang with me, them gang niggas bang with me
The range about my change, know what I plan so play no games with me
To the bullet’s rhythm, the pistol triggers and Hennessey
I bet they would remember me ballin, I fill your memory

[Hook]

[Outro]
It’s bottom line
Do what the fuck I want to who the fuck I want to nigga
Bogus!
Yea, you see?
I’m getting money over here man
Now they get money over here mad
Don’t give a fuck about you homie
Scoo!
