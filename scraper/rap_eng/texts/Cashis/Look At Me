[Hook: K.Young]
Now in the club 'bout to buy another round
'Bout to take your bitch down, y'all ain't fucking with me
Look at me, down, nigga, my true allegiance hang low
Two bitches leaked the foe I had to let these haters know
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Say you will, said she wanna get right on top of me
Go girl on my line on your time
Look at me now

[Verse 1: Ca$his]
I'm back in the first, still packing a blunt
Get a ratchet rag, nigga, I'm gonna fuck
Racks I stack less like Kodak
Get a comeback like never get your hoe back
I'm a cold mac, no lack and I roll strapped, everybody know that
Nigga get racks 'cause you can't fall back
In a spot so packed just hear me rap, nigga
They gonna rep on, eyes on, get it in my combo, head home
Throws off, get dumb and you know I gotta do it with the lights on
G-mode, if that's your hoe, nigga, she don't know
'Cause she 304 and don't need no dough
She skid on flows and get three more hoes, two blew on me while I chief on dro
Nigga I'm that, blind niggas, stunting now, we're not shine niggas
Walking in with that paper green feeling like the world is mine, niggas
Down peet for my entourage, nigga, what you know about that bread, nigga?
Fucked up I make the spot alive by throwing out these dead niggas

[Verse 2: King Los]
We probably a KOD throwing all this dough we got
Every Friday turn it to the holy moly donor shot
Your hoe in my section 'cause she know she want this photo out
Bitches dreaming ' necklace cold and Rollie hot
Pull it out, pull it up, pumping Pepsi in my whip
Pulled up with a rib I hope I pull off with a different bitch
Tell 'em hoes I'm going and them hoes will get it ready
I'mma drop a couple thousand while you popping, you niggas petty
Why they funny, say they balling, now they spending like they got it
I don't really give a fuck about this money, I'mma drop it like that, yeah, yeah, like that
Now drop it down low and bring it right back
Now take it to the side, move it like a pro, just wanna see you twerking, baby, do it like a row
Vibe so hot, don't stop, break it down, you hook the show
All that chocolate, the tits you row, fuck with me, you good to go

[Verse 3: B.Todd]
Black stones on my black wrist
Key match the car and my bad bitch
They asking why I stunt hard
'Cause nigga I never had shit
So I go hard, without a doubt
Fill a swisher, baby, with a lot of loud
No turning down, if you a hater of fame
Then why the fuck you in the crowd?
Look at me now, look at me now
I'm one in the game, I'm needing the crown
She looking up while she slapping it down
That new shit blew sick in my flu games
I'm off the chain, no links, bitch
I'm chasing dreams, no sleep, bitch
I lived this, that's true, son
I go Zen, I'm all one
You ain't on shit but my dick
Ain't it funny how this life goes?
Funny how this life goes
When they fuck with you as the lights glow
But back then where you there for me
You remember, nigga, 'cause I don't
