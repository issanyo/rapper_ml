[Verse 1 : Raiza]

I grab my Jesus piece, i put two candles in different angles
Just to release this beast, it feels like i'm being strangled
The devil is on my shoulder, i can't take this any longer
Memories of sin begin as i look in the mirror and see an evil grin
The stress doesn't stop, i'm living in hell
For him, i'm just another soul to sell
Maybe i'm possessed, i don't know what's next
I'm waking up at midnight, with a knife to my neck
What the fuck did i do, to deserve this shit
Why the fuck did you make me have to go and kill that bitch
Living in a nightmare unprepared
I look for help, but no one's there
I'm stuck in a cycle, fuck reading the bible cuz that shit is a myth
If there was a god, would he allow this shit?
I start to sink into the abyss
The devil sings a song and it sounds like this

[Hook x8]
I'm gonna die

[Verse 2 : Raiza]
A gift and a curse, but the curse is worse
If it wasn't for rap, i would be laying in a hearse
I say what the fuck i like
Bitch slut cunt, oh, is that too polite?
An exorcism couldn't change the way i'm living
I'm popping pills just to sleep and time is ticking, i give up
Take my spirit, and take my soul
I would sacrifice anything for this album to go gold
"Come to me, don't be afraid, i can give you money, power, respect and an escalade
Anything you need just remember my name
But if you cross my path, you will no longer remain"
I take the offer, and make a wish
Sometimes, i feel like a worthless piece of shit
But this is how it is, life's a bitch
The devil sings a song and it sounds like this

[Verse 3 : Ca$his]
