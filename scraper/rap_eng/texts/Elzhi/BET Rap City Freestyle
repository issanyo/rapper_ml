[eLZhi]
They say I'm a manifestation of what this planet's been waitin'
They truly hear with two of they ears, scannin' the stations
El is scorchin', heavy flare, burnin' the CD, turn on your TV
I'm everywhere like I'm teleportin'
Throw my all in a verse til' the walls of this ball we callin' the Earth
Stall, pause and fall in reverse
My time is comin', I rhyme with combinin' gunmen who robbin' functions
For diamonds the size of onions
Look at my eyes, I'm buggin', my sick rage makes my ribcage burst my shirt's entertwinin' buttons
I get signed for nothin', they know I'm the truth
I don't just blow a hole in the booth, I lower the roof
Cave in the walls, make they grave out there pavin' their halls
[?] shavin' they balls and trainin' they broads
My crew has been Hussein with the scars, shown as a child
Fist fights and gang fight, the moment is wild
Sicker than torment, my crew thicker than porridge
Kickin' ya door in like you been evicted for mortgage
You try to rob me and get beaten, and left bloodied to death
Even death scared to take a breath from me
I'm one of Detroit's finest, the home of playas
Roll with gators, keep them [?] rolled in Vegas
