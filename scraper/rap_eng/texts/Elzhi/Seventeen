[Verse One:]
At seventeen, you wouldn't be the youngest corpse heaven seen
For a pair of Air Jordans size eleven clean
You would hustle during REM hours
If you, pushed up daisies or garden stem flowers
Look alive everyone has your best interests at heart
Wouldn't be close if y'all were inches apart
The interesting part at sixteen you work a shift at micky d's
Read comic books kept your room clean
And your grades up but now they slippin'
Like bloods hanging where they crippin' quick to cock back stick the clip in
You see how girls love the jewelry drippin' and gossiping about what they whippin'
You and them never lock lips when
You was sixteen you lost your virginity a month ago
Weeks before that you started puffing dro
Hanging with the wrong crowd
Joyriding in a stolen car banging songs loud
Mom's kicked you out the crib cause you stayed out all night
Stayed high all day and that would make you fight
You thinking you grown you only seventeen
You wouldn't be the youngest corpse heaven seen
For a pair of Air Jordans size eleven clean
You would run up on a nigga, steal somebody's car or empty out the reverend's jeans

[Verse Two:]
Now you off the pills, pushing wheels
And stacking up some dollar bills; how it feels?
To live the life you hear about
Portrayed inside of rap songs and seen inside of movies made by Paramount
Your mom's praying for you wonder what to pray about
Is it the duct blowing areas that your rivals airing out?
Last week your man's got shot but he'll recover
He came home, murdered one and looking for the other
So now you stay strapped at all times
Cause life involves crime that can kill you like a fall from a tall climb
Plus you live under the same roof with his granny
Living wild taking xanny's sniffing nose candy
When you got the call from your first telling you that she hasn't had her period
Of course she wasn't hearing it; young and inexperienced
You were just sixteen last year
Working drive-thru as a cashier
Sometimes you pass there and reminisce
Now you in some hot water and your choices are to swim or fish
Cause last night is when your spot got raided
Be lucky that no hot shot sprayed it
You thinking you grown you only seventeen
You wouldn't be the youngest corpse heaven seen
For a pair of Air Jordans size eleven clean
You would risk it all keep shut your mouth and stab a knife into your brethren's spleen

[Outro Bridge:]
Those are probably repercussions that you probably ain't seen
Hope you make better decisions when you're eighteen
If you're doing jail time then wipe the slate clean
Hope you make better decisions when you're eighteen
Once you know the definiton of what fake mean
Hope you make better decisions when you're
[Gunshot]
