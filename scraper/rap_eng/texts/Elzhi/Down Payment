[Verse 1: Stik Figa]
It's Stik Figa mayne, yeah I'm clearing it up
Had to give it to them straight, they don't hear it enough
It's all bad for these the suckers, ain't no cheering them up
A bunch of curious thugs dripping their period blood
Prefer fear over love when really we big winners
Ain't a dollar to my name, willing to split dinners
Be it, lobster champagne, dollar menus or chicken tenders
Ride till the wheels fall or we off in the Earth's center
And I don't dis niggas, instead, I dismember
Discharge this weapon, disfigure, dissenters
Get with that or get with this, get with the big picture
Don't stop, don't quit until we get to the six figures
Mess around and get injured, considered dirty and dingy
And when I kick a verse it's worth every penny
So reach into your purse whether major or indie
Everybody ain't gonna love me, they won't get me, but look

[Chorus: Stik Figa]
I'm just trying to tell them what I know
Tell them where I been, tell them where I'm trying to go
Man look, I'm just trying to tell them what I know
Tell them where I been, tell them where I'm trying to go
When there's money to make, yeah, there's money to get
Money to take, yeah there's money to flip
Gotta take a risk scared money don't win
Trying to get the quiet money so stop running your lips

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Money didn't change me, neither success, only the fake friends
That quick to toot their own horns, I'd rather make bands
That's music to my ears for years ending on a sour note
Like off-key lime powder that's awfully prime time
Push down your throat, so you can get a taste of what I been through
Biting through the tune no fact or act to
Pretend you were in my New Balances while experiencing verticle
Way above your head 'cause your ankles were angled vertical
When you see where the scandal at but
What if you couldn't put your finger on how things got out of hand how could you handle that?
Hater that could make a waiter bend a spoon at lunch while you shoot for the stars but put a crater in the moon, damn
Wish I could say that I was aiming high at my lowest point
To when I fell short I had to blow this joint
Or similar to liquor just to feel buzzworthy
All because ever bar that's been thrown at me was curvy

[Chorus: Stik Figa]
I'm just trying to tell them what I know
Tell them where I been, tell them where I'm trying to go
Man look, I'm just trying to tell them what I know
Tell them where I been, tell them where I'm trying to go
When there's money to make, yeah, there's money to get
Money to take, yeah there's money to flip
Gotta take a risk scared money don't win
Trying to get the quiet money so stop running your lips

[Verse 3: Stik Figa]
You see as time goes on it seems that I'm less eager
Guess experience is really the best teacher
They say time's money, but you ain't invest either
So I had to go get it, can't wait on the Tech feature
Never had a lot, I never got a lot to lose
Everybody thirsty and really they ain't got the juice
And everyone an expert but really they ain't got a clue
I'm nothing like 'Pac, I'm probably more like Posdnuos
Struck gold, I don't know if I'm getting close
Play position was never fitting into a role
One of one, maybe one day you get a clone
Just know that eagles don't fit in pigeon holes
Eat crow I never rode on a coat tail
And watch close they, really hope that your boy fail
I been dope, they been lame so 'oh well'
And hope floats so fuck fame, that boat sailed

[Chorus: Stik Figa]
I'm just trying to tell them what I know
Tell them where I been, tell them where I'm trying to go
Man look, I'm just trying to tell them what I know
Tell them where I been, tell them where I'm trying to go
When there's money to make, yeah, there's money to get
Money to take, yeah there's money to flip
Gotta take a risk scared money don't win
Trying to get the quiet money so stop running your lips
