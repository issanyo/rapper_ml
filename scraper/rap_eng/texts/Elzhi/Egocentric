[Intro: Elzhi + (Ego)]
Damn, it's happening again
Feel like I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Slowly losing control
It just takes me over...(You must have)

[Verse 1: Elzhi's "Ego"]
Got your blunt laced, while blowing 'regs,to think I'd catch boos
On stage, that go in kegs,your imagination's
Growing legs,my back's growing eyes, for unknowing spies
That cut off annoying ties, faster than a Boeing flies
I'm showing wise guys, I'm wise, men
Skies bend, while I'm in there, pulling lies out of thin air
For 10 square miles, so when pushing the pen
This felt like, a pierced cushion within rare dowls
Resembling peers, indeed, the flow sounds sicker
It goes down quicker, than a ten-speed when disassembling gears
You tremble, when fear's about to consume your thought
It will rip a room apart, to chew through your human heart
You're mystified from what exists inside, a Jekyll
Is Mr. Hyde, bigger fish to fry, while our wrists were tied
You're stressed, and couldn't be the best man
Standing by your sister's side, while she kissed her bride.  Question:
Should I come hard and kill every nigga? Or be positive?
As an AIDS test? Sensitive as a hair trigger?
It's better telling, your man I would murder him
Through letters spelling, 'til he holler "Life's a bitch!"
Like it upset her yelling, while he stumbles off the Remy, never grimmy
We keep the Mac in the 'Lac, the semi in the hemi
Couple bastards, who did old dirt, like shimmy
Shimmy-ya, shimmy-yay, on my flimsy prey

[Hook:  Elzhi]
Can't get a grip on my ego
Be wild'n out with my ego
It's hard to think around my ego
Feel like I'm the shit with my ego
Floss with my ego, I'm a boss with my ego
I'm about to run this shit with my ego
Don't say too much around my ego
Tend to lose control around my ego

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
El don't possess enough strength to control me, I make him speak on his Rolly
Or how he keep that purp on paper like a parolee
And that moment I'm done he'll snap out of it slowly
Until then we'll hook up a line to keep you reeled in
Better speak about peace and spread love with building
Because I could be beneath the bed of your children the way I'm beasting
Just know I plan to blow minds back
Rip the most, sip a toast, and whip a Ghost like a proton pack
While I catch a massage by who I'm menage-ing with
You're as fraudulent as a desert with a mirage in it
Provoking El might, get you caught up like you at the light
With the cop on your tail lighting a tail with the broken taillight
Beat you herbs then carve up your henchmen
You starve for attention, but are you hungry enough to eat your words?
You spit that club nonsense, I hop in your mind state, crash your mental plane
Wreck your train of thought and blast your subconscious
Out the water, I slaughter

[Hook: Elzhi]
Can't get a grip on my ego
Be wild'n out with my ego
It's hard to think around my ego
Feel like I'm the shit with my ego
Floss with my ego, I'm a boss with my ego
I'm about to run this shit with my ego
Don't say too much around my ego
Tend to lose control around my ego
