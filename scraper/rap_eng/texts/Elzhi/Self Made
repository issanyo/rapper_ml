[Chorus]
Self made since twelfth grade, this my calling
Every jewel I drop is money out the sky falling
El is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting
My pen bleed while yours be blood clotting

[Verse 1]
Do I give 'em pay or give 'em mercy? Decisions, decisions
They say my bars set 'em free in all the prison divisions
These weaklings, known as foes, are likely not on the hills of this
Stand up nigga, always thinking on his toes
Self made since twelfth grade, that's my calling
Every jewel I drop is money out the sky falling
Like it's raining on a stripper I was eyeballing
Face is in my lap, fingers up my thigh crawling
El is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting
My pen bleed while yours be blood clotting
Word, he finna spaz
Me get ate? Not on my watch
It could be half past 7, then thirty minutes pass
Science and dollar signs are underneath my D fitted
Saw a light at the end of the tunnel, I lit my tree with it
That's just how I'm blazing, nothing short of amazing
Had a brush with death and all it did was make my waves spin
Numero uno, owning watches made by Hublot
Every time I step it up, y'all put the stoop down to a new low
Either do more planning or shoot yourself in the foot with the four cannon
And hit the floor landing where you're standing

[Chorus]
Self made since twelfth grade, this my calling
Every jewel I drop is money out the sky falling
El is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting
My pen bleed while--

[Verse 2]
Might pull up on you in the Q50 Infinite then park
You a infant in shark water, marauder throwing shots against a infinite spark
Inside the boundary of a city state and county
Was down to put a bounty on my head before they crowned me
Giving me more reasons to pour Riesling
And activate the door keys in the Four Seasons
Where I'm from make the news that'll interrupt a program
Some will face the music, others caught up in a slow jam
And took away the hoop goals, to know that I can show you the ropes
Or strangle you with them if you looking for some loopholes
What's in my bio is hazardous and it's vile
It's matches in gas chambers, a water gun in Ohio
An asteroid in the troposphere speeding towards a hopeless mere
Mortal, others appear normal through my ear portal
Y'all would hate if next year I'm in the McLarens, yea
Here and there I see y'all got angles, y'all don't play fair and square
All I push is mind power, screw zombies
They brainwashed while my brainwaves is tsunamis
The small beaches on a island with a few palm trees
Is bars for you gun toters who pursue crime sprees

[Chorus]
Self made since twelfth grade, this my calling
Every jewel I drop is money out the sky falling
El is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting
My pen bleed while yours be blood clotting
Self made since twelfth grade, this my calling
Every jewel I drop is money out the sky falling
El is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting
My pen bleed while yours be blood clotting
