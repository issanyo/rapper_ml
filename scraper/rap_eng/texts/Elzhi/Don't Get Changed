[Intro]
Fascinating

[Verse 1: Denmark Vessey]
[?] stole my what's poppin' [?] like yesterday, whatchu' want?
I love the winter
That's when the quitters deep sleep
From [?] to dinner
You lookin' like a number 5 with two apple pies
I can tell your rap a lie when you bet your ice
If I had to trap or die I'd be in the grave nah I'm Makaveli won't come backareli to my wife
Custom-made hypno scroll on a candy plane
All you gotta do is nod your head in the [?], [?], [?]

[Chorus: Denmark Vessey & ?]
Don't get changed
Don't get changed, you, you
Don't get changed
Don't get changed, you, you

[Verse 2: Quelle Chris & Denmark Vessey]
Yeah, I said quit telling fibs in your raps and your adlibs

My nigga that's why I fucked yo' bitch in my adlibs
Runnin' through the woes with my six in my adlibs
Drop a million like it ain't shit in my adlibs (yup)
In my adlibs (no cut), in my adlibs
Skip like a nigga don't you wish you could have this?
I used to cop shiny suits with Diddy
Ladies squeezing out the sun roof like spaghetti
They play it all tight
Play like you get dough long enough to catch placebo hype
You would think I'm in the hood all Deebo type
Boy I'm just some [?] I don't lead that life
Face down to them green [?]
Skate town before my hood passed it's touch

[Chorus: Denmark Vessey & ?]
Don't get changed
Don't get changed, you, you

I got 35 brothers
Swear that I'm a certified killer
Low-key I don't fuck with niggas

Don't get changed
Don't get changed you, you

Keys and slags and drama and cars and weed

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Three cheers for the last poet
You got grass blowin'
I clash a glass till we splash MoÃ«t during a toaster meet
Most agree I supposed to be coast to coast drippin' the [?]
And as for the track, I can either be a breath of fresh air or a asthma attack
See I don't have to use my best bars to rip out a chest and leave flesh scars to all your producers and guest stars
Uh-uh, these ain't test cars
Rippin' round your neck of the woods, smoother than dress scarfs
With the 4-4 poem, if I picture you picturin' me blowin' up is that a photobomb?
Y'all too nosy not to be in hell in kilos
And don't request these 5 lines if you ain't nillin' free throws
What part of the game is that?
Nameless act, I make you famous with the ignoramus or a shameless brat

[Chorus: Denmark Vessey & ?]
Don't get changed
Don't get changed, you, you
Don't get changed
Don't get changed, you, you
Don't get changed
Don't get changed, you, you
Don't get changed
Don't get changed, you, you
