[Chorus]
I'm only trying to do what I set out to do
To build faith to step out on a mountain to
Thank God everyday for blessing me
And keep best dressed accessories in my cheasapeake

[Verse 1]
Another year has passed to usher in a new one
In first class of the seats were plusher when we flew it
Tonight, we might be in your city just to rock a show
So I'mma need your arms to lift as high as a rocket go
In deep space
I plan to make ya'll see that I'm so far ahead of my time that the big and little hand struggles to keep pace
And just between us two, that's a must do
Like showing love to everybody, but only trust few
I've written down some things to accomplish
To put these pompous
Arrogant pricks inside a maze without a compass
With they accomplice
It's part of my to do list
Along with living life and spotting Judas in a dufus
And staying student to everything that I hardly know
Jog a little, lift weights, do some cardio
Get rest, drink lots of Aquafina
Add that to eating cleaner
Graduate from a Challenger to a Beamer
Just watch me
Get the bread, the girl, and gold throne
Forget about my ex cause there's no need to hold on
To memories of sex, bonfires, cold stone
Delete all of her new pics that's in my old phone
Press reset
This time around, I'm bound to get my respect
For those who treat this God gift like it's the devil's reject
I wonder if they know just how focused I am on getting mine
Peep what's right under my nose and watch for hitting signs

[Bridge]
Cause I'm just trying to do what I set out to do
To build faith to step out on a mountain to
Thank God everyday for blessing me
And keep best dressed accessories in my chesapeak

[Chrous]
I'm only trying to do what I set out to do
To build faith to step out on a mountain to
Thank God everyday for blessing me
And keep best dressed accessories in my chesapeak

[Verse 2]
Come up with some new rhyme schemes and patterns
Different cadences, accurate wordplay
You'd think it can't exist for slow snails, pedecured toenails, and five-star hotels
At the W taking no Ls
Lounging with a gorgeous view from the balcony
Create gold bars by pushing lead call it alchemy
Stay out the belly of the beast drinking Christ blood
Without a blood sacrifice for ice and some nice duds
Execute all the things I've written down
Stack up extra loot by sticking to my guns like a exo suit
Stay the flyest level below the highest altitude
Hey
I'm just trying to do what I set out to do
I plan on getting my buzz back
I plan on being ready for when it does crack
I plan to go at whoever or wakes a sleeping giant
Instead of keeping silent whether sheep or tyrant
It's all a part of my to do list
Such as writing about life lessons that some of you missed
Connecting with a queen so we can build a pyramid
She could be rolling ganja in a Honda somewhere in Madrid and Capetown
Off a shondon, aging like fine wine
Not like the affects of time and turn grapes brown
I'm trying to mold melody and shape sound for those looking to escape where yellow caution tape's found
Learn the business
Turn a blind eye to all mistakes for days, make a wave, never burn the bridges
Achieve what I've tried to do
Look at the bigger picture from a wider view
Stay on the righteous path and the proudest shoot
Make you see I'm a grenade displayed in the Kamikaze charade
Betrayed by deceased to the EC pray
Note to self, don't pay attention to what others posting online
Cause a facade is the most you gon' find
Get pops a crib, meditate, cut off a drug or two
I can't front, I got some work to do
