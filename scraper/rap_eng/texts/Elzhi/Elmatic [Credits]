Thank You
First and foremost, I would like to give a big shout out to Will Sessions for helping me bring this tribute to a classic to life. Let this be the start of something big. I would like to also thank the JAE.B Group for all their help and support. I couldn't have done it without you all. I want to thank Jas for keeping me afloat when I was at my lowest. To Lydia, thank you for putting up with me during our interview grind, it all paid off

What up Phat Kat and Ty, thank you for holding me down. What up DJ Dez, you murdered the cuts. D glove, I see you fam, keep up the good work. Thank you JD for the photos and cover art! Good looking out Amp Fiddler on the keys for "The Word Is Yours." You're a legend. What up Royce, my brother from another mother. Thank you for blessing "Life's a Bitch." Much appreciated. What up Pete Rock, let's get it this year. What's good 14 KT? Khrysis, what's the deal? ATone, you my nigga for real. Thanks for keeping me on my toes when at times I felt off balance. What up Nick Speed, Guilty Simpson, Cool E, Denaun, Phez Rock, Illite and all my Detroit fam? HouseShoes, we did it again. From *Out of Focus* to *Elmatic*, another banger. Good looking out on the feature Stokley. I've been a fan of your music since the first album. Much respect. What up Jamar my lil bro, it's your time now.
