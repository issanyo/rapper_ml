Rough draft...
Few only knew that's Ty and my nigga Kat
Couldn't tell you where the next show or gig is at
When weight fluctuates from slim to being big or fat
Forces you to swallow your pride like take a swig of that
When it time to cut off my heat
Was on my knees, when I was just on my feet
Could have been in the streets
Came close a few times
Was craving a value meal still short two dimes
Must have been hungry cause I'm writing new rhymes
With dreams of being stable, big deals on the table
Yet I'm fighting with the label
On the day they cut the cable
I'm staring at four walls
Wish I could paint a better picture for you like Warhol
But, I stopped getting checks from the Preface
Contemplating suicide like I had a death wish
My brother's the only reason why I'm not breathless
Why I ate beats for dinner, and sleep for breakfast
The bad got to worse extra quick
When I got the phone call from Black Milk who told me Hex was sick
Saw my nigga laying there and I almost cried
Still haven't dealt with the fact my mother died
Coulda lied, but that's the truth
Plus we just lost 'Tin, lost Dilla, then right after Proof
Why does it stay cloudy over my roof and try to crowd me?
