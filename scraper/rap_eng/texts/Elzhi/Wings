[Intro]
Yo, Elzhi's in the building
The Union's in the building
Analogtronics, hot shit, yeah

[Verse]
Puffin' on cigars got me high as planet Mars
Every blue moon I get to mingle with the stars
I toke the Budha, may choke the ruger
I warn you if you download this make smoke computers
El will prevail
Now put that on the Glock shell
Bitches on my jock trail
I knock, when their socks fell
Rhyme writer, tighter than a locked jail block cell
For spittin' molotov cocktails
Straighten on rumors, speculators and consumers
And late bloomers, create tumors
If they ain't consumers on my numerous
Material good for your stereo
To pack fanatics, flyer than aerial acrobatics
Cause what I bust, crush your hopes and dreams
Shoot the gift if it came with scopes and beams
Haters wanna' tie me down like ropes and strings
But I'm about blings, slingin' dope and flings, wings

[Outro]
From Paris all the way to Detroit
This is how we do it y'all, yeah
OJ, Gold Fingers, The Pretender, Jon Murran
The Union
Is in the building
