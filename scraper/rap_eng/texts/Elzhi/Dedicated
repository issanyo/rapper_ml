[Verse 1: Elzhi]

Yeah, I thought you was a down chick
Word got around quick, I'm not the only brown dick you let pound trick
I know the last nigga that you let hit the kitty cat, he spoke on your titty tat
And how your ass is pretty fat, you was a [?] rat, acting all high maintenance
But you're low class, always quick to blow cash, and my dro stash
You come around and go fast, cryin' about no gas, gone with yo' poor ass
Catch you on the rebound, now hurry up and get your shit
That means your jeans, toothbrush, and your extension kit
Now leave the keys on the way out, stay out, I'm not the one to play out
What made you go and stray out? I can't believe my /
You deceived my sense of direction, you just as fake when you weave by
