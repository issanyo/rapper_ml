[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Ay yo, wind up on the Today Show
Nightly News Tom Brokaw, broke off and then K.O'd
Lay low, stay where they may blow the yayo
Like Jimi Hendrix in his afro singing Hey Joe
So real, verse me quoting to show skill
You hoes will go to the first thing that smokin' on four wheels
What's that? As far as bars you wouldn't bust back
To me your raps proves your thinking cap is just a dunce hat

[Verse 2: T3]
Yeah all that, (uh, uh ,uh)
I grab my whole sack when I rap
Sudden impact, sorta like Daddy Kane
Ain't No Half Steppin' mane, ain't a new jack swang
Where my crown at, It's like please Lord please
Let me kill these MC's, I be walking on their nuts
Like doormats, ain't no cops to assist, ain't no cuffs to the wrists
I'm a bad son of a BITCH!

[Hook]
1 2, I tell a wack nigga (GO)
That's how we do it, put it down like that
Yeah yeah, I tell a wack nigga (GO)
That's how we do it put it down like that
Yeah yeah, I tell a fake hater (GO)
That's how we do it put it down like that
Yeah yeah, I tell a wack nigga (GO)
That's how we do it put it down like that

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Come through, and mic check one-wuh-one two
To stun you dumb crews to undo my spun screw
Oh no, bring acid to an Average Joe Schmo
But my go-go gadget polo jacket [?] your logo
Oh here's a boss, beneath my mattress is a Nina Ross
To break a man that's faker then shaking hands with his fingers crossed
Wink wink, here's a sneak peek of my ink streak
That skeet skeet on your forehead, chin and chick's cheek

[Verse 4: T3]
Let's say, I'm a sick nigga, black born leader, gut beater, paper getter
Yeah dog, it's too late when you see it
I already did it I did done it when you seen it
Fo' sho', and what I said what I mean is
Get the senoritas, get em' drunk off tequilas
So gone, I'm large not centimetres
Sex game crazy, had em' saying "Oh Jesus!"

[Hook]

[Verse 5: T3]
(SWITCH FLOWS!)
When I hit it up, yup yes yes
Put a bullet up, to his chest vest
Gotta broke out when it go through ya
It'll be sure to leave lots of mess mess
This rap shit's a hobby, gotta whole coast many mami's
[?] better also, gotta also, got an arsenal many armies
You fake fucks will never harm me
I'm reminiscent of a kamikaze, get off for that last flow You need to put it in the garbage
I switched it up then did it up, then fillin' up til' you get enough
Then give it up, you feelin us (let's go)

[Verse 6: Elzhi]
Livin' through pitiful critics who cynical, send a few criminal clips with serial numbers
Bust a slug, and budge your blood, like women, through any new menstrual
Cycle, I go psycho, my flow stifle, rise a eyeful
Insightful? You write slight bull, and need your stripes pulled
You dead at the end, see never again will you competitors win
I sever the head of a veteran, said to be better than lettering spread from my pen
Hardcore, to make you brothers act fools
When I tend to rip you, like Chip Fu shtick when the track move, and we out

[Hook]
