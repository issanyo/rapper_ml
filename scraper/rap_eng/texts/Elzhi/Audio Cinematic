[Intro]
Take a journey with your boy in the dark corners of his mental
Hope it stays pleasant

[Verse 1]
12 A.M., a knock's on his window
Through the curtains knew if he should let the person in so
It was his boy off of Pete Rock and he got
A gun he took from his reef box that come with three shots
He said, nigga is you down for this stick-up
Replied he's ready as they hopped inside the Chevy pick-up
Got to the spot, his boy Pete from the passenger
Through the glass at the dude with cash getting gas for sure
They saw his car by the leaded and unleaded pumps
The worker would serve him, head down, looking red and flushed
The dude turned around and (?) felt concerned and frowned
Plan a return, started the car, and circled out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
12 A.M., he's on the kitchen table
Dick licked enabled by a chick thick as J-Lo
He grabs for the last rubber in the stash he has
Too bad cause the (?) half and half
Replied stay here, that's what he told the skeezer broad
Starts to leave (?) small heater underneath his draws
Speeding in his car, appears as if he's drag racing
So fast, he almost go past the nearest gas station
Pulls aside at pump five, (?) for his errands
Looks up and sees an Arab staring at the get he wearing
The bell rings from him jerking back the door
Then he caught eyes with the person that was working at the store
In and out of each aisle, he finds the rack of condoms
But in his mind he kinda feel chills behind his back
Told the man at the counter to put ten on five
Then he turned around and saw these guys out the window drive
The worker caught his attention so he could pay the (?)
But was stuck when the truck outside was skating off

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
12 A.M., a man works for hours
To scan the amount of the purchases that land on his counter
This woman had a bunch of items
He helped her, she left, he bout to get dressed
But then another ride comes
He saw a Black guy who decide he possibly look
Like a crook, he shook, cause on this job you see robberies
Dude was pulling at the door but when he walks in
He's on him like a hawk when he walks man
His thoughts ran
Eyes watch him up and down, left and right aisle
Hit the rack stack with the back to back packs of Lifestyles
He came forward with the purchase but he felt nervous
The Black male seems he does crack sales, murders
The guy replies ten on five, the men drove by
He had his head down but heard it
When they skirted

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
They both hopped out the truck, pulling their mask down
It's obvious they didn't come here for gas now
The man behind the register saw the two coming
He reached beneath for his piece like a true gunman
Hands shaky, his hands forming beads of sweat
The two rush inside, the other guy hasn't seen them yet
One yells, hand me your earnings off every purchase spent
The (?) burning at the same time the worker did
Dude in the back, out there hiding behind the condom rack
Speechless, reaches to palm his gat, where the robbers at
He rolls high with a four-five, but with both eyes
Saw the second robber draw a Tec from out his coat side
That automatic that the Arab cat was shaking
He was scared and panicked
Shot the robber with the cannon blazing
After the robber caught the slug his foot was staggering
Clapping the Arab who perished and sent bullets scattering
The other robber was shot from a gun, that popped once
In the eye By the guy who was shopping for condoms
And even he was murdered when the Arab's gun spilled
Strays his way, so there he lay
Now everyone's killed

[Hook]
