[Intro]

[Verse 1 : Page Kennedy]
Rule number one
First you gotta grab the right beat
If you comfortable enough on the track then have a seat
Yo put up your feet, or lay down
I'm about to teach you how to train your dog to sit and stay down
And you don't wanna get one too fast
It sound like OutKast
So you won't outlast them[?]
Cause we don't [undetermined]
And you shout, and you bark
It comes out as
That you and your crew is without cash
So you gotta find a beat like this one
Then your track is wack with skill
No the track is how to pick'em
And that's when you dip'em
That's when you flip'em
And that's when you give'em
The nickels like that's the rhythm

[Verse 2 : Elzhi]
Lesson 2
After you find a beat best for you
Spot the rhythm, if not your written's unacceptable
You gotta learn to ride the track
Know the bass and the snares are basically there
To provide the pase to guide your rap
When you chosen the part, flows you will start from scatting
The moment it sparks, you're composing an art and what happens
You might say something like, don a na nilla
Observe how don a na nilla can turn into words to no one is iller
Or the flow is the killer, just showing you niggas how to stay in the pocket
It's very valuable so just pray that you got it
Lesson three is establishing patterings which is the sentences
Gathering , putting emphasis on the different ones
Imagine if you wrote cheap skates, with cheap skates rhyme with deep lakes
And deep lakes rhyme with sweep stakes
Now, check out my wordplay
I might switch the last word with the second, and place the second where the third lay
Now, you got cheap skates, sweep stakes, and deep lakes
Thats three great double syllables, now we can create
Now, bumpin' cheap skates you thought I won a sweep stakes
And a hundred than can build up till they fill up a deep lake
Thats what you call a three pattering
If we battling, and I use that, you cats should be least challenging

[Verse 3: Page Kennedy]
Rule number fo' here we go ima teach you how to be witty
See many think when they write rhymes they need similies
But I'mma show you different use of language, that you use to distinguish
You from the wanksters
And you ain't always got use like and as
Like as if you gotta say you cut like glass
[?]
Lemme show the right way you supposed to write
