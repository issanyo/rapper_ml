[Hook]
Here we go-go, let's play a game-game
Try to guess the word that I'm a use, I'll explain-lain
I'm end up each and every line just the same-same
You fill in the blank before I say it, that's the aim-aim

[Bridge]
I welcome y'all to the introduction
To learn how to play here's the instructions
A couple rules to show you how the game function
Yo, I'm a take a double, take a double syllable
And split it down the middle so it's no longer even
The first half stay, the last half leaving
So now the end of the line sound deceiving
So figure out the word that match before I change the meaning

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
K-K, you wanna play? How should we start?
You try and guess the other half of this word, we'll use smart-
-alec, you see how easy that was? I say a line like
My head gets light when I'm catchin' a buzz-
-cut, got it? Well we can do another
Why was Sally shocked to find there was a nine inside my under-
-age? Now we can really begin
Long as this beat keep the treats fallin' out of my pen-
-ata, rather slow or faster it's disaster
I come flowin' harder than a master-
-bator, now in the streets we a mess, try to test
We drop it, you stop, pop a two in your resp-
-iratory system, they claim they the best
Hey, you ask me I say maybe they were okay, yes-
-terday, they wouldn't even respond
Those niggas pussy and they don't wanna fuck around with a con-
-dom, I live the life of a star
See me glide in different rides like I live inside of a car-
-nival, yeah, that's your girl in the stand
She's a fan, when I'm done she's goin' to wanna give me a hand-
-job

[Hook] + [Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 2]
Check, this girl was peckin' my neck
She knew this one-minute man who use to bust in one sec-
-retary, it was a dude named Kev
He went to church on a Sunday and turned his back on the rev-
-olution, bet, you caught on yet?
Okay, your dogs turn scaredy cat when they facin' the vet-
-enarian because they not this sick
I keep a chick loss for words so she hop all on my dick-
-tionary, I don't be givin' a fuck
This line goes out to each and every critic that thought I would suck-
-ceed, but peep the line before last
It's breathtakin', it has your favorite rapper soundin' ass-
-matic, I keep the rhyme strikin' them
Cause I sparkle like a diamond and shine like a gem-
-shu, not carin' who I offend
I ain't believin' none of y'all thug niggas livin' in sin-
-emas, I had this girl in my bed
And every time she opened up her mouth she was givin' me head-
-aches, now since the day I got bread I can spread
I know quite a few of my friends have gotten fed-
-up
