[Hook: Dwele]
There's something I wanted to know, can we get closer
Yeah baby, seems like I've waited so long, can we get closer

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Girl you should come up for the week
I'll make you cum from the tub to the sink
Rubbing your feet in a luxury suite
Make sure you come with nothing on just a long shearling
And I'mma make ya toes curl up like they all earlin'
I'll whisper in your ear, tell ya something
Stick my tongue in your bellybutton
Reach down below, you know I'm well sprung
Hit ya from the back to get ya calves trembling
And pull your hair 'til its straight, you look half Indian
Laugh and giggling
With champagne bubbles tickle your nose
Before you I wouldn't throw my old nickels at hoes
I'm just glad we can get close, for breakfast in the morning
We can fly out to Paris, France for the French toast
You made me wait so long and that's a good thing
Now let me make your candy rain dampen your thong
I hit it off like a champion strong, for real
Your still bumpin' and grindin' even after the song but all along I, I

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T3]
Let me talk to ya, feel me for a sec
I love ya sassy ways I must confess
You're lookin' good girl, I hope you into sex
Sort of a model type with a splash of innocence
Your fashion (fash-shon), ass like your moms
I love that Tiffany charm thats hangin' from ya arm
And if we get it on I'mma take her back to the fort
Show her how I run game like an athlete in sport
Sweety I can see that money ain't a thing
Been doin' this for a while no need to explain it
You're doing swell girl, you're never doin poorly
You know I'm hoppin' in whips just look at the jewerly
Plus you need a man in your life
Yo someone who can hit it right, and plus got the right dough
Plus I'll treat you like a queen
Your place or mine I was thinking we should get close

[Hook]

[Dwele]
A lot of cats done tried it
I like to touch the na na, I
Know you act real shy but, know you get down
You're not that type we go
Just keep it low and let it go
No need to act up cause I, know you get down
Can we get closer tonight, I'll make it right
Touch you inside baby, I make you get down
Hold you very close, with or without clothes
Public or closed doors, we will get closer
