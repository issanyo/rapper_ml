Hold your breath
Yeah yeah
(YAH)
Woahh ohh ohhh ohhh oh
Yeah
Im feelin like im whippin in a Porsche girl
You all up in my thoughts
Its simple & reinforced
Love that love that that love
So much that we should back up
You never feel it til it happens
Then it happens
Cause i guaranteed your life is like math subtract it from your past
& the math you think its like fast
Talladega honey moon up in vegas sharin paper
Cross my fingers hopin we dont break up
Now we made it through the basics
We seen it in an instant
Girl id love to see your ass naked
We should stay connected
Every second record is a blessin
Girl you got me smilin so F it
I take it there i take it as a blessin
I use it as a weapon
I rhyme they should use it as a reference
When people stay stick together we forever its embedded
& everytime we go somewhere we always leave a presence, the essence

Hold your breath
(dont let this) run away
(its moving) faster (yeah) faster (yeah) faster
(whoa whoa whoa oh)
Dont let go (dont let go)
Night & day
(its moving) faster(faster) faster (faster) faster

From mix to the intense
The second i hope you smell the incense
Entice the moment of innocence
This how we came together
For better bond suited on how to break hearts
Separated then recluded
Desire was a overwhelming conclusion
Those things of passion created a guard for the delusion
It makes sense
In a mutual choice the muse & states of simple bliss forever we still here
& in a intense climax the moment a miss & the moment of passion is intense enough to commence
At last we in the depths of orgasm
The experience brought us this far
Now we out fast

Take the time when expand emotions recommence to the intense
The second is innocence
Guess the time when expand emotions to the 8 tenths
A second of innocence, innocence

Hold your breath
(dont let this) run away
(its moving) faster faster faster
(whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Dont let go (dont let go)
Night & day
(its moving) faster faster faster

Yeah its like you million miles away
& i can't take that
Lets get that crib, sittin where that, hate that
You need that, feelin that young girls dream of the italy
Gotta lay her boat up streamlove
That paris in the springtime
Wakiki when i, when im lost in your eyes i see me in ya
It feels brand new
Just listen, ya mans true
What u wishin i can't do
Its my mission
I plan to in addition stay thru the good the bad
Whether the rain or shine
Your remain is mine
Body & brains, ya fine
Yeah you all that & then some
What a perfect place to begin from
& baby if you let yourself go
Maybe we could go
Tell you this is all i know
& we could do dinner, dance slow
A broad way show
Tell you this is all i know..

Hold your breath
(dont let this) run away
(its moving) faster faster faster
Dont let go (dont let go)
Night & day
(its moving) faster faster faster

Its moving (faster) moving (faster) moving (faster)
Its moving (faster) moving (faster) moving (faster)
