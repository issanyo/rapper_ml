[Intro: Parole Officer]
Yeah, you made bail boy
You need to stay your ass up out of trouble
Don't let me catch you back up in here man
Smoking on all them reefers and shit
Sign right here, take these, call this number
And if you hear your color called
You got to come in that day and drop
And you better not drop a dirty, boy
Or that's your ass

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
I got flicked by the hooks pointing the Prada look
Off a dutchie
Caught the munchies, but was too high to cook
In front of my crib parked I heard "ten fo', roll down the window"
And I flew a thick cloud of endo
They cuffed me
And booked me 20 minutes roughly
In my mugshot, my eyes bloodshot, I'm looking scruffy
Was locked up, couldn't doze, my nose stuffy
I'm thinking if they tow the whip all I got is my Huffy
Shit, I'm not Puffy
That night was a toughy
The cover like sandpaper, the pillow wasn't fluffy
Whoever ratted, it was horribly done
Anyway, it's morning now so we back to where the story begun
I'm grabbing my things half asleep
I'm searching for my keys, I had to laugh to keep
From crying, while the car sits, the battery's dying
And I'm trying 'bout buying a cheap suit to put a tie in
In this court date that came up quick, time was flying
I'm at the stand no denying in my replying
I'm ordered to take a piss test
And classes on not to twist cess to resist stress; how I get in this mess?
I'm thinking all this over marijuana?
That's when he hit me with community service
"I'll be there your Honor."
Fake Judge Matthews, Muppet Show
"Hypocritical rap bastard, you probably high right now"
So they assign you this color with the number to call it
Then take your money so you can't save some with your wallet
Sixteen for a drop, damn they making G's
Not only taking fees, they had me cleaning out gyms or raking leaves on my aching knees
I hit up Fess [?] to help me get my car back
He was breaking trees (let's roll up)
He came through with a cigar pack, he lit it, I hit it
And now I'm craving a shake and double bacon cheese

[Outro]
Hah. Wait
Did I just?
Damn, I was dreaming, man
I'm tired of this shit, man
I can't wait until this shit is over with
Fuck
