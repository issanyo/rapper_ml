[Verse 1]
I seen the error in your ways
I can never correct the way you wrote your life
And how you word your actions
You never looked them over twice
You just jot 'em down and wouldn't give 'em any thought
Over paper you crossed a line, wasn't pretty smart
Your whole attitude was way past the margin
Trying to pass in the eyes of niggas who had no class
Skipping on school and that experience was teaching
'Til they trapped behind bars looking serious when thinking
Trying to pinpoint where they went wrong, reciting the same old song
It seems like you writing just like him
And you feeling like an artist drawing blanks within my brain waves
To put it in black and white, we wasn't on the same page
Wish I could have steered your hands in the right direction
But you went out like the darkest ink writing in light complexion
Still, I could adjust the actions that you've given me to read
But my life holds literature that's not easily agreed

[Hook]
This is my life
Whether right or wrong
Both feet trailing ink moving right along
I'm trying to live it like a lyric that ignite a song
You live your life on the line, I just keep writing on
Sing it (x4)

[Verse 2]
If you step on any writer's block, you may end up behind enemy lines
Niggas got rap sheets long as my trinity rhyme
Don a sling lead with your name on it, it was written
Dropping hooks 'til the cocaine on us, to give 'em rhythm
Some drink and smoke, a mind full of blackness makes a bold face
But a past written too dark to erase still hold trace
And stays there like our graffiti on them liquor stores
Yosam blasts (?) name tag in the upper left corner
Police they got these blocks down to a letter
But guns that help you bare your soul like sitting down to a letter
Elders(?) in this world is predominately white
And it interests me that they never left the hood like they black as parentheses
John Hancock's a weapon, be careful as he's printed
Because he can push your wig(?) back like a paragraph's indented
