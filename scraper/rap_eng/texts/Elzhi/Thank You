[Hook: Elzhi]
I couldn't have done it
Without my mother being told to have an abortion
And still chose to push me out her stomach
I couldn't have done it
Without god guiding my foot steps through the fires
And even then my blessings were abundant
I couldn't have done it

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Without my manager, every other month loaning me a 100
My dawgs done hit the western union that kept me funded
E-cloudy and rock cannon when I tried to shoot my way to the top
Like 2pac standing in the elevator on some Bishop and Q shit
Just thinking about it make me want to twist up its too lit
Now its champagne rain at midnight on new years
I don't care who appear through my rear view mirrors
Because a deuce did you backwards
That's for the black verse
When peoples body language
Doesn't match with their exact words
But its cool, cause I'm doing it
So major that'chu girl of your dreams
Want me to slide through and hit, then I ghost her
I did some local shows with my name on the poster
Next time it will be unlike I'm getting closer

[Hook: Elzhi]
I couldn't have done it
Without my mother being told to have an abortion
And still chose to push me out her stomach
I couldn't have done it
Without god guiding my foot steps through the fires
And even then my blessings were abundant
I couldn't have done it

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Without white Mike, looking out on studio time
A place to stay in kept me blunted
And I couldn't of done it without yol listening
From down South Cali, New York, Utah, Michigan
To those who overseas
That would rather me blossom like flowers
Than to fall like the leaves from October trees
I stuck around from when the form of my sanity
Through a scuffle
Thoughts the stick ups
Spraying at who randomly move a muscle
Those were hiccups, the only cure was pure holy water
On a Sunday at church in the afternoon
Where Sarah passed the torah
But now I'm in a high-riser, TV Plasma, 4k
See how knowledge is key and each decision has a doorway
Thank you God for blessing me, I'm awesome
Those against me gotta pay on the day that it cost them
My childhood sat across from
Killers and dealers with a sentence
I found the word in a lost slum

[Hook: Elzhi]
I couldn't have done it
Without my mother being told to have an abortion
And still chose to push me out her stomach
I couldn't have done it
Without god guiding my foot steps through the fires
And even then my blessings were abundant
I couldn't have done it

[Verse 3 : Elzhi]
Without Bombay, Soul Daddy and Josef
[?] to keep in one hundred
I couldn't have done it and
I don't mean so sound redundant
But I for sure couldn't of done without Kayanna
If you wasn't the one for me
Then hopefully some day I may find her
I hope you know I appreciate all you done for me
That for real it kills the phrase
There's two sides to one story
Trust believe I will pay you back
That's my word cause I'm doing it (Doing it, Doing it, Doing it)
Although we came from broken homes and foster housing
My clique floss you browsing
These kick cost a thousand
So fuck what you heard, this is that shit
My life was a bitch blowing kisses at clips
I was only ten when I opened my third eye
Heard myself say sky is the limit, where the birds fly
To get where I'm at now
I had to fall, get kicked when I'm down
To get my feet back on flat tiles that's why is over
You niggas know whether drunk or sober
I colder than the blood hitting in a cobra

[Hook: Elzhi]
And I couldn't have done it
Without my mother being told to have an abortion
And still chose to push me out her stomach
I couldn't have done it
Without god guiding my foot steps through the fires
And even then my blessings were abundant
I couldn't have done it
