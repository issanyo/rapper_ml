[Verse 1]
George Bush sending boys to war what is he color blind
And where I stay he don’t see the sky grey
I’m in the middle with guys green Earth chilling right
For mothers feeling blue ‘coz they kids dealing white
For their brown paper bag money from the head junkies
They wanna rock purple labels and red monkeys
A mind full of color schemes in their head planned it
To them boys in blue catch 'em red handed
Pat em down spread their legs put their blackjack
All in their baggy jeans to find bags of green
Could be the dread type sippin' on a Red Stripe
And shorty acting wild puffin' on a Black & Mild
It's true they shoot niggas through Yellow Pages
Move yay pounds on greyhounds out of the blue blue
From Mac and Grey Plymouth and Greenfield
Yellow tapes surrounded bodies on the scene killed

[Hook]
It's the colors colors
The red white and blue
The white runs the house
The red fight the blue
Over colors colors
Rarely seen by the others inside of the spectrum
Which story will I select from

[Verse 2]
You never know who it might be
To have you dropped on the black top
Leaking red through your white tee
Behind my backyard they pushin' them packs hard
The crack just to get a black card
And really should invest in a vest
Lead-proof skin the thug got a slug in his chest
At the Red Roof Inn
Down the horror from this dude getting head truth chin
By this a high yellow red bone with the spread tooth grin
Looking like Pink singer she can pose for Black Tail
A lost black girl in a world of black male
And white collar crime done on the sneak tip
Different from blue collar workers catching a pink slip
Not earning one red cent now what's a fella to do
To make green by mixing yellow and blue
Hustle hard hold the tool
Try to stay low-key as a kilo of coke
That's the golden rule

[Hook]
It's the colors colors
The red white and blue
The white runs the house
The red fight the blue
Over colours colours
Rarely seen by the others inside of the spectrum
Which story will I select from

[Verse 3]
It's too ill when the blue steel do peel
And shift a lead in the direction of the infrared
Been lookin' up to ballers opposite of Shaq size
Back when we got blue balls and caught black eyes
I think it's quite foul must've been Grey Goose
And orange juice twist a white widow in a White Owl
'Coz in the same town pimps putting game down
Their Caddies on white walls bumping James Brown
Al Green and Bobby Blue Band
Stories printed in black and white
And papers of probably news stands that reads
A niggas found dead lying in old piss
A victim of a drive-by, they even killed his goldfish
Hustlers with the BlackBerry and Bluetooth
They blow purples inside of old school with the new roofs
Go from painting the town red beneath the night skies
You going to trial telling little white lies
Was piss poor though his parents would try
To provide him with silver spoons for this American Pie

[Verse 4]
Damn, it's fucked up how they found Ton'
Was robbed for his gold chain in front of his brown stone
With concussion split to the white meat
They even took his kicks like percussion
That you fit to the right beat (beat)
Another black on black cause it's lynch fly
That's what I heard, word get around like the pink eye
Watch out when your enemies sneak by
Wish I could pour a white out
On these lines before the ink dry
Its niggas dead from fighting over a breadcrumb
Feet and head numb from a murder we call it red rum
They say that every black cloud has a silver lining
And if it's true gon' see it once in a blue moon
I was told by old niggas that hold figures
Beware of clowns, hoes and brown nose and gold diggers
So keep the grip between the hips of your blue jeans
Which means the clips and black steel is where you stack bills
