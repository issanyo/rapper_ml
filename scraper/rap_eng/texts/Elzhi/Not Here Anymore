[Verse 1: Phonte]
Went to the well and made a wish
Pray to God I stay around, Tigallo love to throw his weight around
On the same scale they weigh the fish
It's just what it seems, sweet dreams are made of this
Holla at me if you ever been a underdog or set up a upset
Standing on the verge of your success
Steady bearing your soul to the world, you undressed
Surrounded by your successors and the whores you ain't fucked yet
That's how I was gettin it
I don't need the limelight, that's young nigga shit
I'm a O.G. and the G is for gentleman
Yes, Phontigga spit amazon flame, watch 9th rekindle it
Cause I pad verses with the wisdom of my innocence lost
Two brothers, two peas in a pod, two comeback seasons apart
Take it back to when I be in the park
Then rhyme 'til I couldn't see in the dark
So silly niggas betta be on ya guard
Long as breath is in my being, I'mma be on my job
With good music, got that good feel
A good meal, leafy greens, two veggies, protein and a starch
And I'm out

[Hook: Phonte]
Right where I thought I'd be
It's another part of me
And the world's so sad to see
That I'm not here anymore

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Wind blowing through the trees
Blue Bull City skies, 70 degrees
Te' embodies a architect and when he rhyme about it
He body the whole alphabet, so bury me a G
My mama say she done enough worrying for me
So I'm done currying, favor what you niggas groundhog
And spitting that same shit, y'all Bill Murraying
My D.C. niggas say you bamas lack expurrience
Carolina on my mind like Steve Spurrier
I'm the courier, carrying the word that with these verbs
That nigga Phonte's a little murderous
See a little nervousness, and a frown cause you know deep down
You ain't nice, just a little courteous
You just running game nigga, we the fucking tournament
You a temporary visa to a fucking permanent, resident
Citizen, it's evident the denizens
Took over the big house on some Nat Turner shit
Shoulders back, hair tied to the fucking firmament
Can't be like us, and fear no man
Niggas bleed like us, get a fuckin' tourniquet, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
I'm poetic while they po-thetic
I play they life like a movie and in the end give 'em no credit
I was told to run it, so I grip the baton
And spit magic like it's pouring out the tip of a wand
Don't trip, you ain't equipped to fix ya lip and respond
I plan to X you out like the man who hand you and script the Quran
Since life flipped, I'm getting chips in Milan
Pull dips, push whips like the one from the clips in the Tron film
I blow your mental mass where your mind stem
Like a nine M-M right at your line trim
You must rewind him, the syllable sensei
Then bring ya to ya knees the way biblical men pray
Or whores in a brothel
Cause I spill ill from the grill
Like one who reveals sores from their mouth hole
And if you only knew the shit that I been through
To paint the type of pictures my pen drew
Your label tries to fuck you, your friends screw you over
Now you sober watching bad energy affect the evils that men do
They fucking see through
I'm a sick flower that carry lines
Like when you click over on you dick blowers
And it sucks to be you

[Hook]
