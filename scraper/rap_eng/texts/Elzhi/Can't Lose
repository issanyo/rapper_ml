I got haters rooting for me to fail
And take a L, so my highs get
Low as a ho who shake her tail
And her thighs hit the floor
I thought I was curse, but I'm the cure in its purest form
It's very obscure
Sure they all say they want you to win when you begin
But in the end, they hide behind their grin and pretend
So fuck who I offend, you know who you are
I throw you a bar and keep it movin'
Like the cops patrolling in a car keep maneuvering
Planning to flick me
Down because I'm brown this planet is tricky
I found this evil forces in the air that we breathe
The water we drink I'm no statistic
Who cares when someone's smart as we think who coexistent
I'ma take 'em high
Quicker than the pair of hands to the naked eye
Wouldn't spare a chance and tell you how connect the fly
Out of Paris, France and Brazil
Cause I ain't at home sittin' still
I'm spittin ill flows at the shows
To rows and rows of fans with their hands closed
Far for my place I started, when life's gone
With depression like postpartum
I can't lose
