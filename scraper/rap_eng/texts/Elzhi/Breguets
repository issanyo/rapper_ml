[Verse 1]
Those who came to see a train wreck, need to get their brain checked
Having thoughts of toasting me up in the champagne Lex
I would entertain if it were a thing
But I'm the heir to the throne
Strong enough to knock the crown off the current King
Cause every bar is epic
As far as skeptics, it can bring an insomniac outta narcoleptic
I kill whoever crave drama with a thirst for trouble
Yea, my pen is poppin, didn't mean to burst your bubble
Off a rich block
Getting high like when the pitch knock
Puffin' a cigar with a bird
I think I'm Hitchcock
What I write is horrifying
It cracks the head of my foes
Send they fedora flying just before they aura dying
Once my thoughts escape the brain, you can't compare notes
To these air quotes that hit the pad, now it's a paper plane
This that pooki dough from Nino and a dooki roll
Every line is cocaine, every bar is Gucci soul
You claim you're flames when it's only hell
What I spit out in the booth, it's the fountain of youth inside the holy grail
The day you wanna try me
I be
Sippin chai tea
With both feet kicked up like tai chi
Me no worry, I'm a ice storm in Cali
You 'bout as common as a flurry in Missouri
Surely you not posin' a threat
And I don't sleep on fly shit, I just doze in a jet
Traveling state to state and doing shows in Tibet
Off a rhyme that every time you hear your ear collects a frozen breguet

[Bridge]
Yo
Hundred million times on you
Every word is valuable
Every time you hear your ear collects a frozen breguet

[Verse 2]
Only fly n that ain't step foot on soul plane
Without a roll train, you control each half of a whole brain
What you encompass is false
Any rhyme out your pad spoke is bad coke
Chop it up as a loss
Just rolled some hemp then
Wrote this with a pimp hand
It turns a gorilla into a chimpanzee
A pansy who won't attempt plan B if plan A failed
They layin' straight shells
Keep it 100
Life is grand, stay well
The pharoah pen push heroin
It's harrow when they meet your narrow ends
And stick a barrel in your mouth
And let a arrow skin your scalp
To the white meat and rupture a brain cell
If you don't knock it off
I knock the thoughts from your train rail
I'm trained well in these arts and crafts
The first verse was lines and bars
These is charts and graphs
My level's where you find the stars
Run if you want
Watch how I play it like
Jimi Hendrix when he gets behind guitars
I'm in Anguilla
Counting up scrilla inside a villa
I'm still a highlight in a verse
You are a filler and I don't feel ya
Go back to the drawing board you wimps
I caught a glimpse of my future and saw awards
You probably'll doubt it
How close mine do
But I won't just closeline you
I'll body your outfit
I'm quite nice
And it's not the henny with the light ice
Bought the bag of small fortune that'll come with white rice
I am who upsets rookies and vets
While the birbs in the jets collects invisible sets of breguets

[Outro]
Breguets n
All day
Just wanted to show y'all what it was about
Every time you hear your ear collects a frozen breguet
Uh
