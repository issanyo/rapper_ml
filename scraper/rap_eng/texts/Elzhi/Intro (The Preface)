[Verse 1 - Elzhi]
This is only the beginnin'
Not everything I've been in is included though
It'll be concluded in the endin'
I thank y'all for spendin, time
Your nickel and dime or four quarters
To get your pre-store orders
Now it's finally here and I'm in your possession
You witness my growth and saw the progression
A blessing, to the day that I'm breathless
I guess it was destined, now welcome to The Preface
