[Verse 1]
My heart bleed for her like cunt on that time of the month
Missed skipping school with her while she rolling a blunt
Or conversating on the phone in the REM state
Up late in the friend zone, tell me, can you relate?
When we was 8, we hit the roller rink just to skate
Catch us out, we was hanging, was never on the date
Wish I could’ve told her what I felt over a swisher
Instead of flirting with her little sister
As a kid, I wanted to kiss her, a teen, I wanted to fuck her
As an adult, I wished to tuck her
Under my arm while we’re in the mall shopping
I caught feelings like it’s New Year’s and the ball’s dropping
I thought spilling my emotions in the song would make ‘em disappear
Like the motions of a wand, Love Potion Number 9 in reverse
I wish I was there first
How she get wet for these niggas who thirst, that’s the worst
Damn

[Interlude]
Man, that nigga’s a fucking cornball
That nigga ain't got a dollar in his pocket
That nigga still come around wearing Nichii
You know that bullshit
Yo, that nigga came to me, man
Remember what he did to you?
Man, I would’ve fouled on that nigga, man
You know what I’m saying?
Fuck that nigga

[Verse 2]
It’s crazy how she knew me when I never sipped a drink or rolled a doobie then
A Nubian, who deserves a crown to put a ruby in
I seen her go from a freshman to a senior
We’re both from the lower class where the grass wasn’t greener
I remember making angels in the snow, wearing coats
Or after school when we’re comparing notes, sharing floats
That’s a memory she can go to to remember me
Before the cars got nice and the jewels got shimmery
Now, I’m so ready to go steady
With the only girl that gave me butterflies that made my palms grow sweaty
I must’ve left a bad impression
She’s resting on the couch while seeing multiple girls in my session
From inside jokes to outside expressions
I thought it was a blessing to end up with your best friend
So if you’re listening, don’t forget the animes
The sundaes on Sundays, the Saturday matinees

[Interlude]
Look at that nigga chain, man
The fake ass diamonds
You know that nigga chain ain’t worth even talking about
Know what I’m saying
Fuck that nigga
Nigga drunk all the time
Nigga ain’t got no gas in his tank
Nigga riding on E
I’m saying, what that nigga got I ain’t got?
Tell me that

[Bridge]
Yo she got me in the friend zone with nothing left to stand on
She need to put her man on (x4)
