Now when this hit the fan you would smell like me
On the double oh no, now you know me
We hook up then this on vatay splee (?)
Loco so my motive (?) as i hit the lotto
Banana smoothie, strawberry with ten feet
Talking to a dun (?) and i do agree
A decade and a half with koolaid, and elly and ess (?)
You thinking that we so lowkey
The beat goes on and the list goes on
And i pour you a glass of the don perry
We hook up the phone 1-313
Disco, frigerator, sysco, (?) now or later
It's that elevator to the dolo nolo
It's that elevator to the dolo nolo (?)
Dog, strag, 313
Dinner at cheetah's, drinks on me

That's the way it is
Getcha money
Get live y'all
Earl flinn
Ride to the rhythm that the dj play'n
(uh uh)
They ain't feeling what the dj spin
Took my man to ten
Tell 'em play it again
Get live y'all

Yea
Yea
Ain't the deals
I stack more bills than pills
Thrills on the hills for rillz
I'm on tilt
Imagine all the cunt i chip
I never gotta touch myself
I swum a wim (?) in michael phelps
Dc
I never women at cho belts
Still spree
I used to rock
But now i'm in the phillah
R-A, D-I
Don't make me pull the sleeve up
The watch is a keep up
The rocks is a c-cup
Exclusive is the sneaker
A table full of drinks
That's too much to drink up

Chicks wanna sink up
We doin' the machine how i renew 'em and move 'em

That's the way it is
Getcha money
Get live y'all
Earl flinn
Ride to the rhythm that the dj play'n

Mos def'ly fly
That's on the low like the fbi
Blown the dro that just left me high
I'm known to blow
Bone a hoe and get lucky like that lefty guy
Prone to flow 'til the death we die
A thousand
Never that
Shouldn't touch the man that what he's clever at
Pockets is forever fat
You snitches would rather rat
On me
Because i'm gettin off your phony
And my wheels are chromy
With the blades like jenobi
I been around the world where they say what up homie
What up son
What up joe
What up showty
What up doe
Broadcastin live from the district
Gettin like i'm right between your eyes with the biscuit

That's the way it is
Getcha money
Get live y'all
