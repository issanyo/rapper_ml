[Verse 1: T3]
Can I be me? Can I do what I do?
Can I, freak my style? 'Cause it ain't nothing like you
Can I walk my own path? Dude you, step out my shoes!
You done been where I been, you did paid all my dues?
Plus you, rap with El' yet both of you equal
You got, something to say, you in the D with your people, yeah!
You are not me, and I'm not you
Just, give me space nigga, just move!
I, rep the D, the way I do
I can't be you, I won't be you
I got soul in me, that's older than you
I got my man's with me, we colder than you
Can I, be all that a nigga can be?
Can I, show you places that you never would see?
Can I, ball out, and never look at receipts?
Can I, sit back in a luxury seat?
Can you respect who I am? 'Cause I love to be me
But I hate those dudes who's trying to be me
Be with me, or be against me
But don't be fake, keep it real with me, get me?

[Hook: T3]
See what I see? Then walk with me, walk with me
Feel what I feel? Then talk to me, talk to me
Live where I live, and go with me, go with me
Yeah, I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
See what I see? Then walk with me, walk with me
Feel what I feel? Then talk to me, talk to me
Live where I live, and go with me, go with me
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Can I, share with you everything in my soul?
From what I, hear in my ears when clearing my nose
From what my, eyes have seen, what I've felt with my hands
What, my heart has felt, when I fail to understand Why, we be going through it, just barely getting by
Wake up from nightmares, up early getting high
Just trying to forget I had a dream
I was chased by a killer, I shot him, he fell
Turned him over, his face was familiar
But let me knock on wood
Yo, you're supposed to keep your, enemies close
That go for every block or hood
I, would like to walk inside a church and not feel guilty
Paying my tithes with dirty money, every bill's filthy
I hate to feel like I'm alone on this earth
Like my mother, with no support through my moments of birth
And I know that I shouldn't be relying on sess'
But every time I get high, I get wild with stress
But Lord, I want to walk in the steps of your son
But it's hard when they pull your card, and your weapon's a gun
There's no exception, and dumb niggas, they can get it too
Leave they condition critical, maybe I'm just a fool
But can you speak through me, and teach the ones under me?
Already thinking this is all they ever gonna see
Cops hitting the block, and niggas on the corner flee
What a poor ghetto child'll do for a G

[Hook]
See what I see? Then walk with me, walk with me
Feel what I feel? Then talk to me, talk to me
Live where I live, and go with me, go with me
Yeah, I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
See what I see? Then walk with me, walk with me
Feel what I feel? Then talk to me, talk to me
Live where I live, and go with me, go with me
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
I'mma show you where I'm from, where I'm from
