[Intro: Elzhi]
She was the baddest chick
All the niggas wanted to hit that
She was my nigga tho, for real

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Damn
I can't believe I'm writing this song
Admiring your beauty like the life of a swan
Its funny cus' we shot dice in the swipe of a palm
Blew in each others hands and dropped them in a cypher at dawn
And thugs and we never hugged when we greeted
It was just pounds, you dap me hard enough to jerk my fist down
I saw you like one of my niggas
No weaves or braids
At the shop you leave with fades
And would grease you wave
Wore a stud in your nose
Even sag get your bows
Scratches up the elbows
From you scrapping with hoes
Was haunted by these very thoughts
Now the world know what's up
We've been blowing off of trees
Caught Earl throwing up
You was a G
From out of the hood
The truest to me
We used to sneak in to the movies for free
And see usually three dudes that be in your face
Yeah you dated a few
How could you love that man
When I hate him for you

[Hook 2x]
Its like that
You was my nigga
One what, one love, one love
Damn my, damn my, damn my nigga
Once upon a time not too long ago
Nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga

[Verse 2]
You had beef, I had beef
We was one and the same
It felt you was dealt dirty
Couldn't stomach the pain
Wanted a gun to just bang
The blood to just spill
You utter the chill
I pause, fist balled against the walls
Now if you seen a hoe, yelling up in my face
You be on your way to jail
Handcuffed with a case, my nigga
That's real talk
That's how it's been from the start
Back when your moms gave me trims and (?)
When she called you tomboyish
For you bitin' your nails
Your daddy's little girl
She hate it when he writes you from jail
She try to dress you in dresses
Heart lockets for your necklace
You rocking Carhartts
(?) for your breakfast
Could I be to blame
For you coppin' trees in the freezin' rain
And needed change Force Ones and mean Adidas game
Used to walk with a bop minus the switch
Heineken sips
Forget you had vagina and tits
You know?

[Hook 2x]
Its like that
You was my nigga
One what, one love, one love
Damn my, damn my, damn my nigga
Once upon a time not too long ago
Nobody gets my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I was jealous of the fellas
That was hugged upon your Perry Ellis leathers
I never felt this helpless
That were vague selfish pleasures
Wonderin' what's underneath that baggy attire
The agony
Knowing some raggedy guys
Been beneath the panties actually
Only answered the fire
I should have been your first
Who took the gun out your hand
When you put the bullets in to burst a nigga
Hate I couldn't see this person in ya
Till you traded your backpack and your Ones
For a purse with slippers
Perfect figure
You grew out your hair
Took a stud out your nose
And wearin' two in your ears
Sexy as hell
But still you could vibe with the hood
Make sure whoever you beside
Is providin' 'em goods
You hear me?

[Hook 2x]
Its like that
You was my nigga
One what, one love, one love
Damn my, damn my, damn my nigga
Once upon a time not too long ago
Nobody gets my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
