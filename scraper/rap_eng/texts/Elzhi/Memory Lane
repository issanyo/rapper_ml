[Intro]

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
I'm trying to get to memory lane
But wonder should I take the train of thought
Or hop on a mental plane
I don't stay far, but this a place you can't get to in your car
Travel, standing still, it's bizarre; but there you are
Like you never left, back in junior high with your report card
Trying to make a B out the letter F
Maybe that was me around the time that my brother was six
Before I got my first job and my mother was sick
It's like she never needed chemo, her hair looks long, flowing
Sometimes it feels wrong going
But then every corner that you slung
Hung with all your dead homies slung
But now they got breath in their lungs
Looking forever young, before they were stressed
In here they only dress in nothin' less than Guess
Timberland, Tommy Hil, Rockports, and a Pelle
I reach down and grab a beeper while I'm searching for my celly
Damn did I hear Bump and Grind that was the jam at the reunion with the fam
In front of the cam, I'm trying to kick it with my first chick
I used mom's Infinity
This will be the twelfth time I lose my virginity
Shit was the truth, I left and I stopped up at the Hip-Hop Shop Seen 'Tin, Dilla, and Proof
Bugz, Bad Vibes, and Grym, T3 when he was slim
Watchin' La Peace battle Eminem
Soon they handed me the mic to spit a rhyme and a verse
I was shocked to see the clock show the time in reverse
But I ain't wanna leave
Without hittin' my first blunt filled with chronic leaves
I choked up and couldn't breathe
That's the day I missed class, smellin' like twist grass
Mrs. Nash kicked me out because I'm not a kiss ass
So I visited places where spots got shot on a daily basis
Where kids pull triggers with babyfaces
Wait, I must be on the wrong side of the lane trail
Where they rob memory banks and end up in the brain cell
Where all my misery and pain dwell
I'm said to leave out my state of mind before the train bail
So now it's time to go
I threw the deuces up to Dilla, dapped up 'Tin and then I hug my mama slow
Yo

[Outro: Elzhi]
It's the place you wanna be, right
Next time I think I'll take the mental plane
Instead of the train of thought
Hopefully touch down
In a state in my mind, but I'll leave the mental baggage in the crib
Get back to that place
In Memory Lane
