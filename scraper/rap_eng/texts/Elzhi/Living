[Verse 1]
You my little freak mami, personal hood rat
Sucking my dick just ain't the only thing you good at
Knew how to get your way just so your man can pitch the yay
You cook the coke up before he broke up the bricks to weigh
Earning most of your dollars to inherit your mom's pad
For a newer pair of shoes to wear plus a dime bag
And all you know is drama, wanna ??thug??
??Gotta throw them bulls?, brush they shoulders and pop they folded collars??
???
What's worse is when I hurt your arm
And cursing it just turns you on
You was a down chick
Supid booty, round tits
Could've been without a gut, but couldn't give McDonald's up
Raised up on the east side
Where your ex nigga Reese tried to hop on his police ties and died in his caprice ride
Your man before him is doing life with no parole
Dude was trife, he broke your nose
Through the strife you were hopeless so

Living just enough for the city

[Verse 2]
You look so ghetto in your golden open toe stilettos
Your hair be fried to the side, and dyed so close to yellow
Always up in some party
You such a club rat
Hood rat, mall rat, psh yeah you all that
We hear you cussing on your speaker phone
You leave your home
Come back from some scrap without your sneakers and your weave is gone
Called you my gangster boo cause from the top ??? wouldn't stop until the drank was through
Forever coping ?raegos? But never change clothes
Seems retarded at the market seeing you in your evening garments
And when we argued you was cutthroat and so gutta
But what for
To end up at the front door of your mother's
In your panties you tell me "daddy make my fatty shake ?spanka?"
Your booty clap like patty cake patty cake bakers
Man you knew the run game
Acting dumb and rude
Smack the gum you chewed when you choose to complain
You was

Living just enough for the city

[Verse 3]
You judge guys by they clothes
The ride that they drove
Like it's fair
You light a square off of the eyes of the stove
You hood
A koolaid drinker
Your school ain't teach you the rules
Abused by fools
It was cruel, they beat you, you bruised
Can't be too mad cause you had bold credit
And stole a few of they security codes off of they old debits
Never left from your city
That's why you're extra sedity
Yes you were blessed with some titties
But your essence is gritty
And every trick and hoe you know pregnant
Why brag cause your hips is swole, you pigeon toed, and you bow legged
A Mickey Mouse tattoo above your ankle
You love my bankroll
??To sprankle sprankle right at you, dig???
Member that day I almost left you whore
And starting ??illing?? Cause I caught you stealing cheddar I left in my dresser drawer
You wore your dresses short, cause you swore that less was more
Never grew your nails but bought the ones that you could press
And you're

Living just enough for the city
