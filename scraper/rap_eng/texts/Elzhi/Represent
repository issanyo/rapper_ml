[Intro]
Yo what up though
Ya' listenin' to Elmatic
Fire that weed up and put it in the air, yeah

[Hook]
Represent, represent (x4)

[Verse 1]
Straight up shit is real and and any day could be your last when you pass
Your sand has dropped now your hourglass in the flash
The corners is where they pitch rock
To move into a rich block
Find somebody up in your crib
You gotta' switch locks
Niggas pull triggers and ditch Glocks
Over things a bitch jock
As sick as a Hitchcock flick
To be a big shot, looks appealing
The life of crooks getting money off the books, fuck a shook civilian
We took the illing and mistook the feeling
Of climbing to the top, stay in when you don't know where the cops laying
Loaded guns, pop, spraying
Just to get the hands on your clock to stop swaying
Enough to cause both of your knees to drop praying and niggas stop playing
Cause I was told to represent
By OG's claiming the D and repping Flint
Pushing old school whips on 20s they kept in tint

[Hook]
Represent, represent (x4)

[Verse 2]
They call me El, I'm not your legal type of fella
Bong smoker, pipe inhaler, keep a strong poker
Face, playing my cards right, fuck a case
Cops will run in your place for hard white, treat you wrong, poke ya
With the night stick
I know these snitches telling in fact
I'm smelling a rat and the aroma is quite thick
They shut down your light lick bright quick
Charging you with shit that might stick
Thought you was Frank White slick
The jokes on
All you little niggas with locs on
Counting your figures, downing liquors, getting your smokes on
Representing
For the hood putting your city on the map
Young girls throw they kitty and they titties on your lap
Catch you slipping while you tricking
Stick the clip in, to get paid and leave you sicker than that AIDS symptom
They play your man like fools, feel the heat from the tools
Empty your wallet take off your jewels, you know the rules

[Hook]
Represent, represent (x4)

[Verse 3]
No doubt
See my stacks is fat, this is what it's about
Before that Ice Cube conflict with MC Ren
Around the time when 3rd Bass was dissed by X-Clan
I used to wake up every morning with my ear in a box
Bumping Rakim, Kane, Finesse, Freddie Foxxx
Then I bought the Nas CD, Biggie and Pacs
Wu-Tang, Jay-Z, GangStarr and the Lox
Now-a-days I need the greening of cash just like the next man
Using my mind to make shit move, just like an X-Man
I'm talking checks, grands, commas and zeros
Growing up, my heroes palm firearms at dineros
Some of them went to jail, got life in the cell
Others got death, dwelling in Hell, most of 'em fail
When you laying low and the police is hot on your trail
Do you think of suicide or are you plotting for bail?
This is words of wisdom from El
Try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for snakes, represent, one love

[Hook]
