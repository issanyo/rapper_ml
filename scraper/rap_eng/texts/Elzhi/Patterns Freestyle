[eLZhi]
For real, they now rockin' with the best
To get the snot blocked within they chest, concoctions knockin'
They oxygen and breath
Study the man the way you mighta done an exam
I'm a G like ten hunnids, one lump, summer's a grand
Some of 'em plan to stop me shinin', the vendetta's got me rhymin'
Forever like a rocky diamond
Conservin' to think, in high school I'm servin' them geeks
Murder the ink like Ja Rule and Irv when they link
Catch eL, holdin' the tip, scrotum is gripped
Even when I'm not controllin' my slit, fold with the grip
Poetry spit by yours truly, is a treat, pigeon feet
Groupie whores screw me in suite in Venice Beach
You know my M.O., trimmed 'fro, brim low, gems glow, Timbos
Slim hoe in my limo
Imagine it, I have your clique and your management disappear and
Vanish half as quick as a magic trick
A throat slitter, you in the presence of danger, I'm old school like dope dealers that dressed with a pager
In my profession I write definite bangers
That leave you twisted like reppin' the west with your fingers!
