[Intro]
We have to understand that we're talking about our survival and nothing else
Whether or not this beautiful race of people is going to survive on the Earth
That's what we are talking about, nothing else

[Verse 1: Fes Roc]
Shots bust in, cops rush in, on niggas hustling
You know the science of money is substance, the evils
My peoples, live illegal, stack dough that equals
To large amounts, that's hard to count
I blow an ounce and watch the plot thicken
We on the block pitching, while the cops watch with optic vision
Listen, my hood is chaos, it never sleeps
Crime's got us knee deep in the streets, uh, between the sheets
I write verses, while the Devil curses
Watching young kingpins get put in hearses, the fiends lurking
For the dream merchant, their last days seems certain
He overdose before they close the curtain

[Hook]
Tryna tackle the grind, stress hard on my soul
And shackle my mind, making my heart cold
And my head hot, cause's bread not, coming in and I'm
Losing my cool, like the summer wind strolling through
My goal is to stand on the bottom of my feet again
Even if it means robbing then I got 'em in the street in
Broad day and no this ain't of God's way, so I'm hoping
If opportunity knocked, then mine locked, doors open

[Verse 2]
I'm living fast, but cash is moving slow in motion
I'm going through ups and downs like I'm roller coasting
Riding, hiding feelings behind a wide grin
I almost died inside when I couldn't provide ends
Meet, wish I could say life's been sweet
In street drama, the thermometer blends heat
Heat, I'm tryna find a way, depression is grew high
I search for a blue sky, but I'm seein signs of gray
I got a line I say, if I come with two
And combine a trey, add a fourth
I watch how these words on a pad'll morph into a rhyme
This might get me out the sewer grime, many get stuck, few'll climb
They pursue a crime because my city's so poor
My nigga Jay got killed robbing this video store
Tryna provide for his seed, seed
He felt his world caving in, before the day that he bleed
And indeed, greed will fuck your mind if you give it brain
Or give it head, that's one the same
As long as blood's running through my hundred veins
It'll come together whether the weather is sun or rain

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's been another murder, where it never shine, shine
Hustlers off in these streets, agin like fine wine
Ever the lost souls at the age of nine, grind
Grew eyes in the back of my head for who behind mine
That backstab, smack dab in your stacked abs
'til it black scab, feel the pressure like cracked crab
They say the streets is watching
When clicks meet they leave you six feet inboxed in
The block's been good to the hood, got hella bad
Some young fellas that caught slippin, can tell he sad
Fuck it, that's how it go, you just got to keep your eyes peeled
Heard about some guys killed inside my old junior high's field
They said a crackhead did it for white powder
He fiending and so he left 'em leaning, I seen 'em
To just a day ago, that's the way it go
Where they ain't paying dough, so get to laying low

[Outro]
Man, make you want to do somethin crazy man
Get on that 2Pac, Juice tip, get to robbing a liquor store or something
