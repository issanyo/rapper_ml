[Intro - Ayah]
Uh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Uh ah, umm
It's The Leak (ah)
It's The Leak (yeah)
It's The Leak (ah)
It's The Leak (yeah)

[Verse 1 - Elzhi]
Every time I drop somethin hot you hear the sirens peak
It makes the water in the hose on a hydrant leak
You know my shoe game is crazy as the Iron Sheik's
Put a buzz in the streets, it ain't been high in weeks
Months and years, grew around blunts and beers
And older folks playin spades, dealers stayin paid
Until they, layin raised on their stomach with their fists cuffed
Next door to the extra-ordinary, with vocabulary, Lake Shore
I wrote rhymes with remote primes, and quote times of assault crimes
Few years before that back in the four flat
My pops wiped his feet for the last time on our doormat
Look deep in my heart, you'll see where the sore's at
Life's a bitch, I'm runnin through, like I never wore hats
The fuck raw that I possess, I'm kind of luck fla
To look up to niggas that get high and duck law
Enforcement, my parents got a divorce meant
Things'll be different, when he drifted, the three shifted
Four care to hear more, this is The Leak
I'm sheddin' like all of my mystique
I know it sounds fucked up and it deserves a little tweak
But this is everything I am, am, that I cram, jam, in two verses
I witness a few curses, screw nurses, my momma died it do hurt-es
Worse is most say, not any gross pay
Can bring her back, she's up in heaven where the ghosts stay
That level in the sky, beyond where a rocket's shot
I'm where the block is hot, lookin the Devil in the eye

[Hook - Elzhi] (Ayah)
It's the leak, leak
Givin you a sneak peak
When I drop this right hurr, it don't speak
The show is the leak, Leak
Pourin out of my physique
Reminiscin on the times it was bleak
You heard it's the leak, leak (it's the leak)
Beyond the chains and the mink
I bet it pains me (it's the leak), the stains in the ink
You feel me? It's the leak, leak (it's the leak)
It was weak in the beginning (it's the leak)
Now there's no endin to the winning streak, streak
It's the leak

[Verse 2 - Elzhi]
Born in that era of four finger rings and they floss ropes
Dealin with lost hope, a poor singer sings, whores
Fuck on floors, suckin more ding-a-lings
For the cha-ching
Or motels, on blocks I know well
I blow L's and reminisce
When all my chances were as slim as Chris
Rock in "New Jack City"
Recorded at home studios, the two track shitty
Mic blew back pretty bad, I blew stacks plenty
I was chasin a dream I only saw with my eyes open
Some person said it doesn't hurt when someone tries hopin
I stuck to my guns and came out blazin
Amazin poetry, for sure it's the invasion

[Hook - Elzhi] (Ayah)
The leak, leak (it's the leak)
Givin you a sneak peak, peak (it's the leak)
Don't speak, speak ...
The leak, leak, pourin out of my physique (it's the leak)
Reminiscin on the times, times, times ... (it's the leak)
Beyond the chains and the mink (it's the leak)
I bet it pains me, the stains ... (it's the leak)
The leak, leak (it's the link)
It was weak in the beginning
Now there's no endin, endin ... (it's the leak)
Streak, streak, the leak, leak, leak

(*Ayah starts harmonizing halfway through the Chorus]

[Break - Ayah] - 2X - w/ ad libs
They say you give 'em a little and they gonna come back for more
This the sound they wanna hear
So we gon' speak to 'em in riddles, strictly metaphors
It's The Leak y'all wanna hear

Leak y'all wanna hear ...
Leak y'all wanna hear
