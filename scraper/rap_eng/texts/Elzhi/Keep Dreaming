[Intro]
It's like everyday I wake up to some new bullshit
Somebody got something to say about me
Ayo these niggas want to take my spot but you know what I tell them? You know what I tell them?
Keep Dreaming niggas
Find your own way
Don't worry about taking mine
A-yo yo we are going to do it a little something like this
Because I just want to inspire y'all for a minute
So you can see where I'm coming from
Check it

[Verse 1]
Thanks to the snakes who sat in, high grass
Or rats in fly trash
I can handle curve balls without batting an eyelash
Players should focus on their own paper in my class
You will find that anytime I'm tested I pass
So how can you harm me?
When your legacy has no legs, and there is no arms in your army
You hope I answer when death knocked or when death called
You haters can suck a right and left ball, "F" y'all
Im from the city of crooks, gritty and nooks and crannies
Where you heard they took the panties, pocket books from Grannies
Im just a rare breed
With faith the size of a prayer bead
Who stepped it up, not knowing where the bottom stair lead
Became the best ever at rap now that the bear's free
At an unfair speed I spit something sharp then the air bleed
Take the brain inside you head honcho
That's sicker than Griselda Blanco
Or OJ in the Bronco
Or Eastwood in a poncho off A Fist full of Dollars
Rolling with mob ties who can't resist pulling collars
Keep dreaming niggas

[Verse 2]
Yeah, just let me inspire you
Pay close attention to my essence
It only comes once a millennium
A penny from my thoughts may just enrich any city slum
Im out in the Deep, east of the D, thatâ€™s a way though
Got a line for the Mason Dickson, a bar for Barbados
Y'all wasting diction
On fabricated tales laced in fiction
Such as cooking up base addiction
Or dodging case convictions
With guns, a Rollie and China White
Im just being me, super fly TNT
Y'all just Napoleon Dynamite
Y'all suck as this and need to stop
Probably got some bottle to pop
Sitting at the top of your bucket list
So we shouldn't be allowed versing
Who disagrees is on smack
Like a parent when he child [is] cursing
Im wild, and you're the mild version
I quiet a loud person
Then inhale a cloud and get lifted like I'm crowd surfing with a falcon
Get off them lame guy's jocks
I bury 'em
In the same-sized box they put themself in
Keep dreaming niggas, yeah

[Hook]
I just want to Inspire you
To look from a higher view
That's what I desire to do
By pushing this fire through

[Verse 3]
I put cities on the map and make places budge
Give you a sentence iller than a racist judge
From a case where you can trace his grudge
With the same mental plane as Aristotle's
Pushing off different runways than Paris models in Ferragamo's
So I be rising pretty far when I drop this
Landing on everybody topless like eyes in a titty bar
I'm  different, I ain't only out to see paper
Y'all rap, I'm spitting game at mother earth to reshape her
And run this planet in Jehovah's hand, I hope you overstand
You don't want to see no pause to these bars
Think like a sober man
The clincher is that my pen push out poison the way a cobra can
Biting on a Doberman Pinscher
I venture off into to similes
Your excuses is useless as photographic memory with dementia
Who cares about how you stack chips or when your plaque chips
They play your shit
Skip tracks, then play mine until the track skips
Keep dreaming niggas, yeah

[Hook]
I just want to Inspire you
To look from a higher view
That's what I desire to do
By pushing this fire through

[Interlude]
(Sounds of walking through puddles)
Yo this is cloud verse, the second verse
It's like....

["Cloud" Verse 2]
Every day I walk around with my head down
Because I'm afraid that it's either gon' throw shade
Or rain on my parade
Or stay close when my plane was delayed
For many hours
And when my ex was vexed
For not giving her any flowers
It killed my buzz before I had drunk
It was just my luck when it snuck in class
I thought I had passed
But I was flunking senior year
It disappear
Reappear
By it being here I find myself beneath a blue sky
I'm never seeing clear
The forecast says tomorrow may be sunny
Bet money it be like today and the one before last
It pops up to basically end my fun
It be catching up when I walk or chasing me when I run
Even keep me up during bed hours
Always seeming to creep inside my dream when asleep to give me lead showers
Then I awake to see it laughing up a storm
It be there when I perform
And my reception isn't warm
It even showed up at my rebuttal, it wasn't subtle
Instead, it poured down on my head and left a puddle

["Cloud" Refrain]
All it do is rain rain
Rain rain on me
So I try to maintain or keep the same brain
Wishing I can leave it all behind
On a train, plane , automobile
But I ought to know the water gon' spill
