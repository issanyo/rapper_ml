[Hook]
We give it to you straight up
The cuts are raw
We give it to you straight up
Please don't ever try to disrespect it
Let me teach you the ropes

[Verse 1: ChrisCo]
I'm talking punchlines the metaphors
My styles ahead of yours
I used to hit up record stores
And never see the exit doors
Complicated sentences with pot related references
I call my rate perfectionist like I'ma make the best of this
I give it to you straight up but y'all don't understand me
I ain't looking for no grammy or no platinum plaque they hand me
I'm a fucking mic fiend I sit around and light green
Reminisce and make songs bout my life at 19
You got half what I bring spitting nursery rhymes
When I create a verse you rewind like 33 times
Just to analyze the word play and study the skill
Can't believe you really heard me sayin' something this real
Cause the majority of rappers is weak
I'll beat they ass in the street
They playin' dumb you couldn't ask em to speak
There's no choice they gon have to retreat
I run this shit like I got rockets on the back of my feet
What up?

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I was thought real niggas move in silence
So when I rhyme my mind is like a mime half the time
I just wanna pantomime it
Can't find boy this hard without commitment any crime
And hearing sirens who think they sick
They hear me speak catch the vapors I clear up their sinus
Cut from a different cloth this top notch designer
You got cold feet
This hop scotch on the fire
This hot socks from the drier
This reeboks on the iron, I could go on
A-Squad, I'm down for life like I put Shawty Lo on
Mano y mano you Ronald McDonald..you clown niggas ironic and fly city
City that grown niggas the city where the streets yappin
Everybody and they neice rapping, tryin to keep in peace
Cause niggas that beef end up in the meat wagon
I'm so Michigan for anybody listening
Blue city club being on the A list is what get you in
The flow is mean and this is just a reminder
When they say that I'm nice don't take it as kindness

[Hook]
We give it to straight up
The cuts are raw
We give it to you straight up
Please don't ever try to disrespect it
Let me teach you the ropes

[Verse 3: eLZhi]
These niggas so blind fuck a cosign they all can blow mine
Having no spine below a slow mind
Stick with your kind, my shits bangin' like a throw signs
Bandannas ground breaking like windmillers and hand standers
Through your antennas any man eyes land on my plans can vanish
For being nosy like Tony Mantanas
Seen in a mansion just before its raided
After the floor is painted with his own blood right where is aura faded
That's why I kill it with lines after the chorus rated
Sun hot, only got one shot, score and made it
Been had the passion of a mad assassin
On a pad come up with something sharp slashing with this attic craftsmanship
You in it just to stash ya grip, floating in the main stream
I hope you crash ya ship, but hit your head when you blast the clip
So that you plastic ass can ship
For flipping like an acid trip, my nigga

[Hook]
We give it to straight up
The cuts are raw
We give it to you straight up
Please don't ever try to disrespect it
Let me teach you the ropes
