[Verse 1]
Picture me going out, I know what a ho about
Tryna glow off the next man's dough account
But I've, been swift on the toes, since an infant
Why should I treat you different with a gift and a rose?
That's the way I could please ya, but you a hood skeezer
I should squeeze ya, for smoking up my good reefer
You see me hopping out of limousines
So you begin to scheme on my winning team, but in your dreams
You got them niggas actin strange going crazy
Cause you got a figure that could change "no" to "maybe"
Infatuated with material things
You only see your feet in them shoes, your ears in those rings
But ah, you could come around on your best behavior
But sorry love I can't save ya...
And I know every nigga on the block gon' praise ya
I'm international, I can't save ya

[Bridge]
And there's only one thing I know
You really gotta go for sure, ayo

[Verse 2]
So baby girl on no grounds, will we marry, slow down
So just hold your horses like a merry go round, round
You fantasizing 'bout shopping sprees
Cause you seen me dropping G's, like I'm chopping keys
Calling your best friend and tell her that I'm balling
And how you go and have me all in love falling
Fed you a meal, now you head over heels
Dead it and chill, you would have got in bed for a bill
But still, you can't explain why you feeling me this past year
Which one will it be you liability or asset
Let me take a guess, you would show your naked flesh
And shake your breast at any man that would make some sess
But don't come around me for a favor
Sorry sweetheart, I can't save ya...
And we can roll out, roll up, smoke herb of different flavors
I can get ya high but can't save ya

[Hook]
Primetiming's in her mind
But she said me for this time

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
So now, me and you we could never be an item
You goin nowhere, look how far I've come
I got my own shit, but you don't own shit
You bone for a Sprint phone and your home rent
You might have played other niggas but they not me
They see with two eyes, you know I got three

[Verse 4: T3]
You can't play me, no not three
Uh-uh, I'm not the one, that's why I got free
You can't save the unsaveable
Ms. Unsatiable, you coming at me like a Flavor Roast
You want it your way or the highway
You raise your voice, but settle down this where I stay
You never cease to surprise me
So I had to go like a worker on a Friday
You know what you did, don't try to look me sideways
A little thing called trust, glowin my phone up
All in my contacts callin peeps up
So time's up, I done been through enough
The road too rocky for me to roll so I bust up

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Outro]
I could send you my French ride
Was it to have a good time?
