[Intro: DJ Live]
It's time to get live from the Backroom right now
I'm your boy, DJ Live
We gon' take you to the Motor City D-Town right now with my boy Elzhi
Elzhi step to the mic and talk

[Verse]
You can catch me out in Oslo, Spain
And puffing on a jet in the sky, no raining
Yet I'm hydroplaning, El, extraordinaire in a pair of Jordan Airs
Exporting flare on rare recordings supporting snares
That's why I never wrestled with thoughts of not being special
I'm nestled in a celestial body, you just a vessel for what
I say and mention should make you put your two cents
In your memory banks and use it to pay attention
To that kid with the fitted, the D on the front knitted
The OGs passed me the torch I lit my blunt with it
And carried tradition, in addition to women wishing we married
Now on a mission, made position
And though I'm seeing commas
And diamonds may cause you to watch my watch
I rather brag about being timeless
So those who take fads and run with them, I make mad
Til they stomp on their notebooks and they turn them to brake pads
