[Verse 1]
Stand...toe to toe wit anybody watch they feet twitch
Think I'll shoot the twinkle out ya eye before you blink quick
Spit rip, always got a line like I'm Pinks if
We the shit never catch me slackin' like some wing tips
Sip a bottle thinkin' bout the niggas I done rapped around
But feelin' like I never graduated where's my cap and gown?
Patta down, I'on't trust a soul you need to pat 'em down
I'm petty like the petty bullshit beef wit me and Danny Brown
Round here niggas wanted play it how they wanted to play it
Thought about it then I let it slide I'm money motivated
Don't ya hate it ain't on my radar for me to cultivate it
So the way it's cool to finesse it if niggas know the basics
Show ya faces better be the same as when ya mouth speak
Pull up on ya new to your Agenda like in South Beach
Now, for them niggas sleepin' on me they can count sheep
I'll reach, out and get him Ghost now call him Styles P
These grown men in their feelings I swear they need to stop
And while we at it please forget my number when the Yeezy's drop
I broke the side button yo my ringer Nas ether hot
Call ya girl to put my love below off in her speaker box
Reafer got me on another planet now we level up
Do my dirt alone cause niggas don't be leavin' well enough
Metal tucked, eye on my opponent wish me better luck
Pour a shot and toast just know I'm sippin' from the Devils cup


[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Never trust a man unless he show his hand
Recognize your worth and learn the only life you know is grand
Stop pointing fingers when its concerning your issues
Read between the lines and find that signs
Can turn into mis clues
Words are whispers actions speak loud
Never follow or seek crowds
Take every critique proud with your head up
And never let money change you
When its exchanged through
Transactions cause ive seen it rearrange few
Ignorance bliss but knowledge is power
Sometimes you gotta stop
Just to acknowledge the flowers
Believe half of what you're hearing
Peep out the whole scene
And keep ya piss while you on parole clean
That's if you roll green and
Walk the straight and narrow
Represent your town, state, and borough
Never thrown in the towel like crate & barrel
And keep ya eggs in one basket
The truth can also be ugly when you unmask it
Patience is key decisions are doors
Windows are opportunities
That shut close
Follow your heart and your mind
Only if your gut knows
Appreciate your highs, but lows
Are blessings in disguise
Always take heed to the lessons and the wise man (whatup)
Legitimize, Plan, Provide, Praise
If you ain't front and turn your back on'em
Look at'em sideways
