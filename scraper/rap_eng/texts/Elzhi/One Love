[Verse 1]
We met up at the mall in the fall, somethin' I'll never forget
She was the shit like when you sit and let it fall in the stall
Like it was made, I'm more taller then small, she was 5'3"
Looking like a women with drive that had the live key
I pressed up loving her thighs and how she dressed up
Buggin' off her eyes and the size of her breast cups
Long story short, I got the numbers and the email
We talked about the past and she broke it down in detail
How it felt to not have a father as a female
Told me that was confidential keep that on the DL
Her convo was classic as Illmatic in 9-4
After that day since then I let our bond grow
That was like three years strong, it wasn't long
Before I strip the thong gave her the schlong and wrote this song
And it reads "Baby girl is everything I need"
Rollin' my weed that's why I fuck even when she bleed
Ya don't feel me but shorty even taught me how to slim down
Bailed me out of jail, got my car out the impound
Cooked me hot meals, helped me when I got bills
Keeps me buzzed and does all of the above, one what? One love

[Verse 2]
Her childhood was rough, her father's out robbin' for stuff
It never was enough, soon he was cuffed and later snuffed
She explains how she felt and how the cards were dealt
I can tell she was scarred, life was hard, no help
She was raised off of Dexter
Where the pimps and prostitution a little extra men wanted to sex her
Back when she was six she recalls porno flicks
Mother turning tricks and dicks just to get a fix
And though they got by, she can't remember a day
When her mother was not high, chasin' some hot guy
Fast forward to middle school she's fucking with a baller
On Pirelli's, he bought her a celly so he can call her
She moved out at sixteen to live with this older guy
He was twenty-five, that nigga use to blow her high
Had a few exes one named was Robbie
Was pushing a new Lexus by owning some duplexes
Only thing he was too sexist
Baby girl was getting beat downs, body slams and suplexes
Was happy that she left cause that coulda been death
He did a little more then push and shove, one love

[Verse 3]
She had very bad taste in men
Her last boyfriend who was chasing ends is facing ten
I know just why he stuck with her, he knew she was a down chick
Never do she lie and never does she sound slick
Told me she was tired of them dudes and I was different
How I don't just lay around all day and get lifted
And she can see the future, I took her to museums
And taught her some Kamma Sutra, next level
Way beyond my ex level, right down to the sex
Feeling like it's no latex, she gives me breakfast in bed
After that then it's excellent head
I got her open like a wound where the affection can spread
I can't lie I feel the same, I thought I was a player
'til I seen her kill the game the day she revealed her name
Can't another chick scoop me in a room full of groupies
She's the only one that I be thinking of.. one love
