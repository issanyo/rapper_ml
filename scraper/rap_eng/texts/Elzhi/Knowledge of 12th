[Intro]
Yeah, I'm just a kid from Detroit who started scribblin'

[Verse]
Up and down the streets of 12th all I saw was the [?] livin' lawless
Nothing was flawless
The kid pumpin' raw was slangin' his harvest
He'll be fourteen in August with whiskers like a walrus
I observed as a youth [?] and vests is bulletproof
From drama on the streets to problems under my roof
The city ain't been the same since the block got scorched from all the riots
They say they used to sleep on they porch
At least that's what I heard eavesdroppin' on card games
Sneakin' to sip Miller in the era of Thriller
You feel the chill of your body how mommy tells you to get down
From shots bustin' out the window of a Monte Carlo
They found Marlow lyin' dead with his Marlboro half-lit
By some half-wit who lost his marbles
Or was it retaliations from fiends in the alley
Chasin' his first high [?] and now he basin'
I'm just givin' you my views, that made me confused
Like seein' bums with no shoes who's beggin to buy booze
My cousin abused drugs, [?]
Was too young to know greens can take away your blues
Or the crack, or the liquor from the lack
Of the figures are bein' stacked
Niggas black from the back of the trigger
They might point it at they self with livin' on 12th
Dream of get rich schemin' while demons move stealth
Think about what they drove and the way that we're clothed
Have your family ever had to heat your house with the stove?
Refrigerator on E, your kitchen full of mouse traps
Eating Ramen noodles till someone in your house snaps
You would sneak up the block and get your mouth slapped, probably in front of your friends
Your momma's plans undoubtedly was tryna' get you out of harm's way
Where they set off fire alarms with firearm spray
On 12th Street
