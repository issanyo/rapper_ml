[Chorus]
I wrote a letter from me to you, telling you everything I do
I know I'm not there all the time, but you still always on my mind
I wrote a letter from me to you, telling you everything I do
I know I'm not there all the time, but you still always on my mind

[Verse]
I'm hoping it'll get to you so you can open it, read it
I felt you need to have seen it to see I'm broken and beat up
Emotions soaking the sheet up, can fill the ocean and sea up
You got me moping, we haven't spoken in over three months
And it's choking me up, like I was smoking three blunts token
I'm out here in Oakland doing promotion free stuff
And coping with the fact that you felt that I broke our oath
And it hurts me most when I can't see your growth in motion
I'm on the road and my album's approaching gold
And I'm holding your picture in my wallet, my little bro is posing
Wish I could go home and see you get baptized this Sunday morning
Make sure your hair's combed and brushed low
And be strong when you going through surgery cause your bones is growing crooked
Can't write in my booklet, it throws me out my zone and
Look it I'm gone and
Unhooking the phone and
I'm pushing the tone and
And just for a moment
I wrote the letter

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter from me to you, telling you everything I do
I know I'm not there all the time, but you still always on my mind
I wrote a letter from me to you, telling you everything I do
I know I'm not there all the time, but you still always on my mind
I wrote a letter from me to you, telling you everything I do
I know I'm not there all the time, but you still always on my mind
