[Sample]
Without Warning

[Verse 1: Phat Kat]
You silly niggers can't afford my problems
Life's a bitch, I stepped off the port of Algonquin
Then did my bumpy Johnson like I was from Harlem
Half of these niggers is robbing
The others are starving
For cheap they putting their job in
[?] you best [?]
Half of these niggers coming with no options
It seems like life is an auction
Sold to the highest bidder, nigga
Better use caution, get popped
Got red socks - Nigga you blame Boston
Shoulda fame shooting silly
Nigga you came talking
In the end you all die like Christopher Walken
Tryna be King lacing your weed with Talcum
Watch out
Without Warning

[Hook]
Yeah, Yeah
It's We Again
Ronnie Cash, Elzhi, Cold Steel Again
These same guys make the world through the [?]
Groupie niggers pass this number to your girlfriend

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Find me messing with a model
I'm spitting like a Wessun with a Hollow
Make the letters move like the Message in a bottle
Flow so sick that it can trick nurses
They say I'm violent for the way I punch lines and kick Verses
And you and [?] to a World Premiere
That's like haters, like wait, like you [?]
I write great but you might have missed it
Like being quite late to the right gate where your flight is listed
I'm where they clapping rounds make you falls back
Dressed in all black but no capping gowns
Talk shit, I will hurt your feelings, give you caps and crowns
And sink your battleship until your captain drowns
Fool, Invade your map and town

[Hook]
Yeah, Yeah
It's We Again
Ronnie Cash, Elzhi, Cold Steel Again
These same guys make the world through the [?]
Groupie niggers pass this number to your girlfriend
