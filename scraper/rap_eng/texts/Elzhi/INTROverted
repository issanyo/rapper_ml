[Verse 1]
Whether you copped the album, downloaded, you streamed it or popped the CD in
I just want my grandmama to see me win
Stumbled on top of rocky road where Glocks reload
Me and my ego box we throw punches he knock me cold
Off my toes and heels, if I was on my feet I wouldn't have chose the cheap frozen meals and over draft accounts over closing deals
My life a cinema I'm just now exposing reels
But why would they want me to blow?
They know an explosion kills
What's behind enemy lines, they get plenty rewinds
Infinity times, infinite infinity signs
You got some shit but wait till mine's drops it's priceless
It can't caught by a pawn shop
You wish we could mind swap
This grown man put his destiny in his own hand
Dreaming of own land while struggling with his phone plan
I'm just trying to pick up on my calling, but eyeballing
What it takes to feel like a giant versus the sky falling
You bound to fall if you walk before you try crawling
The same is not having things in your name looking fly, balling
Dear fans, I wrote this around empty beer cans
In the mix getting twisted like engineer hands
With mere grands and outdated gear brands
After every year spends another tear lands
I had to disappear, it's probably something yall don't wish to hear (wish to hear)
I'm just putting you up on game like whispering
All in my little sister ear
Finding pics inside a unfixed brassiere
Cuz on the low
I had to stand before a judge, I caught a charge
Not a file is at my P.O.'s fingertips like a manicure
And it's more
I'm stressed when by far more I'm surely grating
Cuz I eat when I'm depressed, I'm so sorry for the wait (wait, wait, wait)

[Outro]
Cuz I eat when I'm depressed I'm so sorry for the wait (wait)

This had to be the intro
Worded...
For anyone that's feeling intro-verted
Hey yo, this had to be the intro
Worded...
Out for anyone feeling intro-verted
