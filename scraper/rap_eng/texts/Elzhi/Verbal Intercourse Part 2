[Intro: Elzhi]
Yeah
This goes out to everybody that's trying to get on
Think they gonna get rich
Take notes, yo

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Through the lights, camera and action
Glamour, glitters and gold
Here's a warning to anybody that considers this road
Of riches, filled with jewelry, cars, and thirsty bitches
Crooked contracts, the close friends who switches
Up on you when things go sour
Around y'all
It's called a downfall cause it brings more showers
But don't forget the rain in the spring grows flowers
That causes you to rise where a king shows power
And it's not easy
You got a measly one shot
To be hot up in the game
But over time it got sleazy
Major labels wanna judge you off your last record
Then design something you can sign, to fuck your ass naked
That can turn your 15 minutes into last seconds
Take it from somebody with a past checkered as mine
I was in a group around '99
But rappin' since eight, thought it was great
To be finally signed
But little did I know I made a huge mistake
I found out the label and the manager was fake
And the person that betrayed me the most was my partner
Though all three would be the reason for my departure
I'm thinking to myself
"How you let them out smart ya?"
Nobody warned me like I'm warning you
Happy, aren't ya?
But I'mma show'em
That it was nice to know'em
Or maybe I should ho 'em
And throw them in the poem
Cause they think that I'm below them
Just wait until my shit drop
Cause I got a drive that don't slow down for pit stops
And this one goes to my aspiring artists
With the fire in their eyes
To reach higher and farthest in the skies
May every move you make be wise
And may every mistake
You can take and reprise
You only get one shot
It's not like you get three tries
To rise like G5s
And I'm out...

[Outro: Elzhi]
Yeah
This is how it goes, yo
Read between the lines
Make sure your paperwork's straight, get your attorneys
You don't wanna be like me yo
Sign a bullshit contract
Fuck that
Get your own
For all my aspiring artists out there
