Ah okay I know what I'm going to write now...
Okay... Here we go...

[Verse 1]
A wise man told me resembling Goldie
Bumping the oldies though watch the road please
After he let me hold these gold keys of knowledge
That I acknowledge wasn't from college
But from a lot of mileage
He said "No matter how rich you are
Life can trouble you
Don't fall for the illusions of losing
Cause going through the ups and downs creates the W"
He was hip to the fact that I was stressing
I asked what gave him that impression
It was my expression
He said "Use this info at your discretion
You might think you need a drink, but you thirsting for something more refreshing"
I nodded in agreeance
And told him that living in the dark can be an inconvenience
He said "Kiddo, whatever's got you looking bummed out like skid row
Head hanging down hunched over with your lid low
Just know that you should never bottle things up on the inside
Then laugh it off and grin wide; that's called foolish man pride
Cause if one doesn't let it out, it could be fatal
To the body like for mommy without the proper pre-natal
Care"
And there is where he gave me the idea to let go of the wear and tear I couldn't bear
He hadn't heard a song, nor seen a single video
It never was a question in my mind as if, 'Did he know?'
He was just polite and inviting, I was enlightened
I thanked him, we parted ways and went home and started writing
Then notice how the poison from within me turned to medicine
Once it had hit the page from the pencil that the lead was in
From the pencil that the lead was in...
