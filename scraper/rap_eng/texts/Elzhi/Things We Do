Yeah

[T3]
I got a rhyme for those dudes who lie
About me and mine
Yo, run it back, run it back
I got a rhyme for those dudes who lie
About me and mine
I squeeze them nines, from behind the blinds
I leave you flat in ground in the pinebox
I'm not a killer wit' mine
But I get
Rid of nigga to get piece of mine
If you got the bar separate me from mine
I must be dope for you to steal my style
Try to take my sound
Yo, run it back, run it back
I must be dope for you to steal my style
Try to take my sound
You don't want those pieces out
Better yet you better kneel in church
Don't want these heard
Put a hole through your Dittrich fur
Your little style that you got is so minimal
Is you ready to swing blows with a griminal

[Hook]x2
Things we do to you
Things we do and doing
Things we do to you
Things we doing

[Elzhi]
You heard the click
Pushin', scurshin' whips
New Shearlings kicks
Two words I'm sick
Run it back, I'm sick
Every verse I spit
That a curse I've writ
I find the words that fit
They come together like hoes on the curb for dick
On a urge to trick
For them services
Call me sir or if...
You prefer to diss
Get turned and twist Whoah
Nervousness
I curtain piss, on any nigga that's lame
Call me sick and insane
Talkin' chickens for brains
Shift the stick in the range
When I click and I bang
Niggas pick up your frame, till you lifted in shame
They goin' down quite quick like a wick went in flame
I'm in the wickedest game
Run it back, wickedest game
Don't get stick for your chain
It's the Slum to the Villa, your heads' unda the pillow
Why? (We're coming to kill ya)

[Hook]

[Break]
Introducing the world famous, Slum Village
Are ya'll Ready baby? Let me know if ya'll ready
All the way from De-(Dj scratches) Detroit

[Elzhi]
Yeah Yeah
You look and stare
I see you shook in prayer
I bust at you, (bang) they cuffin' who?
What you wanna do? 1 2, you wanna (uh)
For sho' ya do, if you hold a crew

[T3]
I don't need a clip, to bust your lip
I run your shit, with a swift fist
If you gonna talk the shit (talk the shit)
I'm aiming quick (aiming quick)
You better run (better run)
Cause I don't miss (cause I don't miss)
