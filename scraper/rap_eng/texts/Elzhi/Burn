[Intro]
Let's go
Let's run
Let's fly
Let's save

[Verse 1: C.o.s.MIC]
Can't we just quit, hit reset
Chill for a moment, rewind and eject
No more planning the future, we freeze it
One too many times, got deceived by speeches
Reformat, stop the world from spinning
This time get it right from the beginning, huh
We fucked it up too many times
We spun to many lies to make it right
Destroyed it all in a second
Heading for something bitter so we're jetting
And reinvent ourselves elsewhere
Maybe a quick fix but I'm drained on ideas
We can't fade out no easy ways out
Played out clich√©s got nothing to say now
So throw away that Kleenex, let's be out
'Cause I guess it's better to cut loose than to bleed out

[Chorus]
(Burn)
Let's go, never return
(Burn)
We gonna smile when we see everything burn
(Burn)
So let's run, leave it all behind
(Burn)
We won't cry when we look back in time

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
I jot it down as memory and asked myself what did I expect
For it to turn out like it did on Butterfly Effect
If I read it out loud and I focused real hard
I could travel back and change things that make me feel scarred
But just like in the movie, there's  potential consequences
This current life I'm living could make no kinda sense it's...
It's altered by some wise decision that I wish I made
It could be yesterday, or way back when I used to twist my fade
At the top...on the phone...with my aunt... are these question 'bout my hair
Asking me if I'm aware that I look crazy, like I care
Which I don't, and I swear I should have listened to the points that I was dissing
But I find myself resisting
'Cause I wasn't trying to hear her telling me to find a trade
It's like she flew on a cloud to rain on one fine parade
How could anyone on the Earth deny
A dream, to live some nightmare you would reverse, if you could
I think it's worth a try

[Chorus]
(Burn)
Let's go, never return
(Burn)
We gonna smile when we see everything burn
(Burn)
So let's run, leave it all behind
(Burn)
We won't cry when we look back in time

[Verse 3: C.o.s.MIC]
Let's go, never return
We gonna smile when we see everything burn
So let's run, leave it all behind
We won't cry when we look back in time
Let's fly...one way
We're going to be ok whatever becomes homebase
Let's sail away the anger fast
We're gone with the wind, a blank slate, no past

[Outro Chorus]
(Burn)
So let's run, leave it all behind
(Burn)
We won't cry when we look back in time
