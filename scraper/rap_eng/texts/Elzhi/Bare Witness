Yeah SV

[Elzhi]
Yo when niggas blurtin
Its flirtin with death I'm certain
You actin off the wall consider yourself curtains
I'm nasty
You ask me am I disgustin, you bet
I'm like playing russian roulette
Bustin two teks
Straight shittin
I'm great spittin
Get great kitten off the great writtens
I shoulda been born in great Britain
'stead I'm from the Michigan state mitten
I keep a nigga on his toes like he hate sittin
Know your place or get your flow erased
'til you a nobody
So it prolly wouldn't make sense to show a face
Shit was just murdered
I'll leave you with two words: fuck you
Or you fucked, however you wanna word it

[T3]
Shit I mean biz
Put 'em where the maggots is
Who that bad as me
Young Lazarus damn dog it's been a bit
I rise up surprise cuz we the shit
Chillin where the flask was
Now judge
Haters make me nauseous
Blog us, we get it while we prosper
I could see the storm comin' just call me doppler
Radar
Nine months waiting call it labor
Niggas stay sharp call it razor
Niggas better raise up
Or get his face taped up
And no I'm not gangsta, its anger
For niggas tryna play me like sega
You faker, thought I was soft cause I had a blazer on
But I am not PM Dawn
I'm a madman on the song bearing arms

Bare witness as I come back
Step up, microphone check up
Back by popular demand once again
X2

I'm the truth when I step in the booth

[Baatin]
Front knees for rilla the subliminal rhyme thriller
Chill a minute with me and my niggas from the villa
Touch of jazz poetical interestingly intriguing
Or even or zooming im better but still human
Changing of plans
And what you thought that I couldn't do man
Metaphoric expressin the lesson eternally blessed
No matter which way that I turn
Threw it in a yearn
It's zealous this irony of what reality tell us
Still could be consumed in the analytical synthesizzle my nizzle
Visible disible from the jizzle
Um
Get you ready for the action with just a syllable
Satisfaction from the rap drawer when you're miserable
