[Intro: Elzhi]
Damn, that’s how it’s gon’ be
Just gotta do it all myself
Fuck that Imma do it my way then

[Verse: Elzhi]
I told my moms one day that I’ll become known
Over any track I’d get dumb on even if it’s a drum and a trombone
How could I’ve lost it when I’m inspired
Then keep excuses sounding tired and possibilities exhausted
To everything that’s working out for me
But don’t read me up and down and think you know my story
Cuz even when it was written for me to be poor it wasn’t written poorly
Getting tested by dropouts and old schools who sit and score me
High grades of weed who was willing to die paid
While I stayed harpin’ over how I sharpen my blade
By trade tryin’ to snatch a dream out a nightmare
Reality out a dream even though it seem I’m right where
I seen myself when I was dreaming
I'm supposed to be shopping at Neiman Marcus
And sheddin' light on my darkest demon
After I realized that everything would go fine
I saw it happen without a co-sign
So they could say I been slummin’
And throw shots at my income
But when I drop holler “incomin’”
From the explosion that my pen summon
It’s mind-blowing yet I’m sick of going through life
With a knife in my spine showin’
With everyone who’s talking from behind knowin’
So I can’t miss my shot like Shyne Po and
Rondo’in so watch the dime go in
Till I’m raking in cash and cutting through a snake in the grass
Lawn mowing
Slit his tongue for trying to spill venom
The wisest soldier knows I’ll fold your clothes
While you're still in ‘em
Till I’m swimmin’ in women between the coast line
Know what happened without a co-sign
I’m from the D
Where your window face a deprived view
They jacked you in the drive-thru
While you order a number 3
Buildings dilapidated dreams of putting your city on the map deflated
Some died over beef that was rap-related
And I know how it feels to think you living in a bubble
Can’t double your dividends
You’re likely giving into trouble
I grew up where we wasn’t fed well
Bodies with a dead smell
They moved birds like a bread trail
Now it’s a bag from they knapsack
With prices on they head
And I ain’t talking bout the tag on they snapback
Thank God I never injected or sniffed a nose line
I did it all without a co-sign
Yeah
Keep telling yourself that El
You stumblin' on the right path
Eventually you get there

[Outro: Skonie]
I may not fly to the finish line
But I’ll be there in time
Cruisin' the mile in my old school style
Detroit red in my mind
No street lights no signs
I don’t need co-signs
Cuz I don’t see I don’t see I don’t need co-signs
I don’t need co-signs
