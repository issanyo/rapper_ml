[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Stay alert, look alive, that's the ritual
Don't get ate up by the same blocks that get you full
Either them boys had to meet quota
Or got your name on a sheet inside of a neat folder
This time a year n's do wil' out
They go crazy tryin' to shine
Buying 9mm, eyeing mine
Some see that minimum wage allows very few to eat
For they kids, they engage then get married to the street
Find theyself addicted to the lovin' that they kill for
That brings the dollar bill or
Bags from the Tommy Hill store
Watch out!
They already racial profilin'
So when the streets talk, hope is at a low volume
Young boy lost his freedom just to get respect from it
Couldn't tell a gut feeling from a upset stomach
Was it justified for a good for nothing reason?

[Chorus]
When them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season
Watch out for Johnny Law
Watch out for Five-o
Watch out for Babylon
Watch out for Popo
Watch out for One-Time
Watch out for Narco
Watch out for Flat Foot
Watch out for Slow Roll
Was it justified for a good for nothing reason?
When them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season (x2)

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Don't fall in love with the prezies like young Leslie and
The city of crooks, she's a lesbian
Only hit the club for a fool she later set up
Play cool, so when she spray tools, he later wet up [?]
Removed his chain, found his wallet, and then she stole both
Shorty ain't just out for the bread, she want the whole loaf
'Cause money talks with a silver tongue
Make you think your want is your need
Like cars with the speed, weed to fill your lungs, or what the pill young mind states who turn savage
Who have rich personalities but earn average
Watch out!
That's if you got your watch out
At the right time
In the wrong place where you do not belong
Taste your own blood from thugs
That bust slugs with heaters and mugs
By crooked police that plant drugs
Acting like they found a cigar, you were stuffing treason
'Cause

[Chorus]
When them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season
Watch out for Johnny Law
Watch out for Five-o
Watch out for Babylon
Watch out for Popo
Watch out for One-Time
Watch out for Narco
Watch out for Flat Foot
Watch out for Slow Roll
Was it justified for a good for nothing reason?
When them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season (x2)
