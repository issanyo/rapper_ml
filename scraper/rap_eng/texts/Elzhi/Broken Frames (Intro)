[Theory 13]
This is Theory 13
Up in this
I wanna share a little something with you onto broken frames
So why don't you dim the lights and experience this?

Collapsed frame work
Unable to support the purpose of its existence is nothing but a premise
To misconceptions of prejudicests
But you don't feel me
Looking out of your rose colors to see vision laced in pink
Only what you observe is not really what you think
Because the integrity of the sight has been violated by a flaw
We don't need another point of view
There's already too many
We need a common ground or threat to lace it all up
To keep us from falling on our ass again
Trippin' over lies we're only feeling ourselves in
All caught up in the charlotte's web and hanging over the edge ?
But actually depit to hell or beyond
Or whatever's your nightmare
Staring in the glass and so much beauty staring back
Not seeing what you lack
Ignoring the facts in the fact
Believing what you see is all that
Only because the mirror is cracked, destorted
Contorted your image until not one blemish remaines

We all play this game
Our broken frames let us ignore pain -
The only true warning to the deeper issue
Let us play that blind game
Let us play that mind blame
Manipulation until complete strangulation of reality occurs

And still vision is blurred
Those who remain sightless, shall remain flightless
Heavy as rocks on the bottom of the dead sea
Weathered by their "ignorance is bliss"-mentality
Visually impaired, spiritually scared should grasp hold of the shackle
And throw it off and see for whats the real deal -
To feel the pupils dilate and they retracted in perpetuos light
And they are trapped into perpetuos night
And know that it's right
Know that it's right!
And accept the sight because that's life!
That's the true essence!
Not to trigger ourselves into believing to better belief into our existence
And persistence is the only way
Covered with the desires to see things the real way
Very tame

Throw away those broken frames!
Let the breather breathe in from light
And evade the genuine image in your sight hemisphere
Than you'll no longer fear being seen
The mask can be tossed aside and we can reside on the real side
We can reside on the real side
