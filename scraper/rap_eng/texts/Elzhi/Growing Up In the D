[Intro]
What up though
Ay yo, everybody had a place that they grew up
Location, they hood, they burrow, whatever you wanna call it
But I'm from Detroit, Michigan
And I just wanna reminisce for me growing up
In my hood, in my city, three-one-three

[Verse 1]
Growing up in the D in the eighties, it was crazy
Before Jay Z, before imagination got lazy
I remember Cagney and Lacey
Before iPhones, the only phone I had was my dad's (rotary)
This is well before Jodeci, when Jojo was just a hobo
Sleeping on the boat headed to Bob-lo
Changed school more than I changed socks
Bell Aisle docks, chuck rocks at the duck flocks
Pro wrestling fights festering
'Cause I kept back breaking my boy with King Slender
Blowing in his Nintendo, peaking through the window
Tryna' see his older sister change, I remember
The Greatest American Hero, Mork and Mindy
These are the superheroes I looked up to
Practising the Junk Yard Dog moves, the Heart Foundation
With teens I literally looked up to
