[Intro]
I'd like to have you sit back for just a little while
I want to tell you my story, my life story
And I'm sure, some where along the line
That you will find comfort, joy and peace
Just like I did
Would you go with me for just a few moments
Back to my childhood

[Verse]
Vowed to never look twice in my book of life
I'm on Chapter 20
Turning my pages backwards really show how far I've come
Just a young buck itching to buzz, the womb is the gun
Moms pushed me out her chamber, the doc caught a hots one
She must've threw them headphones over her full blown stomach
Turning my cocoon radioactive transforming within a woman
My life begun it, skip to chapter two
And see a picture of my father running
My 2nd birthday; he never bothered coming
But broke his neck to come through
My mom's crib to come through
My mom's ribs and within nine months I came to
He created a splitting image in more ways than one
And the face of his baby son and through our door ways to run
How could you retreat on a part of you that comes out of your own needs?
So when that n*gga let my mom suffer for 5 long weeks
Met my old dude and gave him a chance
I was still young watching cartoons
Playing with toys and staining my pants
Step Daddy psssst please, it feels like blood
The same type of needle takes from you and fills right up
Our bond became strong as teflon, Moms stress gone
She pressed on like a piece of vinyl recording the best song
Speaking of songs when the speakers were on and connected to the stereo
She would play a lot of old school records
Music plays a big part
And it would stay that way til I'm old and gray
And until things get dark
Kind of how my future look
Hate to use the book of my past
Wishing that I could forget the page that I was on last
Bringing the storm back to my spiritual garden
I know rain equals growth
But even the earth couldn't survive 40 times in a row
But it's my life I can't lose the page
So let's see daddy leaves and then this music thing
Oh here we go, Moms threw vinyl on the stereo
Pumping the sweet tunes
She would sing lullabies to help me close my eyes
And the wee hours of the night
They finally got married
Their wedding vows they recite
Kissed the bride
To my Pops was like a kiss of life
A true and living resurrection
'Til the rain came harder
It's an erection
You see they just married
And they was talking about below and it clicked
She tried to cock back and squeeze
But it jammed, she miscarried
Now this very situation happened later on in the chapter
Her insides
She's torn from the baby gone in the after
Now you can take that both ways
My auntie dies
Proven in beat that we don't stay
And they keep telling me that it's gon' be ok
But it transformed for lies
On top of that this young cat
Gets weaker in the eyes
And even through the bad times
Music was always there for me
Me with a pen and a loose leaf
Equals one big orgy
Cumming with it
My feelings inside become a sentence
Snatching thoughts from a black cloud
That hung in distance
And got good at it
Just a skinny black kid with thick glasses and book baggage
And a torn jacket
But looking back
I can hear them cracking jokes again
It's hard to see the future
With a scratched lense and broken frame...
