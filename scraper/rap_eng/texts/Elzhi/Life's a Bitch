[Intro: Elzhi]
Let's keep it real yo and count this money
Put the Grants up in the safe cause we spendin' the Jacksons
Washington's go to wifey, that's what it's all about right

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Everything I write is like a fatality
I’m a pattern-punishing painter with a pen
Got a style kinda like sodomy cause I'm anal with the way I get it in
I'm a maneuver with the mic, like Drano
Moving through a pipe, I'm insane-o
You can lose your life, I'm biblical with this lyrical ability
Respected I’m here to get rid of these records
Get checks and fill up facilities
I ain’t sounding like no man
I ain’t holding no dynamite, I just got dino might in both hands
Nigga this is Elmatic
I’m with a chick with her tail tatted
She at Chanel baggin', pill addict
Ill, I’m still at it
For real status and you gon' be a vegetable unless you got you a steel cabbage
I woke up early in the mornin'
Dressed in black yawnin' said two of the best is back
Early in the mornin'
Dressed in black yawnin' said two of the best is back

[Refrain Chorus: Elzhi]
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
I got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Get a rush from how they bust, swear they was leakin' puss from
I don’t deal with hoes nor trust scum
And treat money like pussy, if I fuck it off then it must come (cum)
I stay fixed on lines that make your mind play tricks
When they mix, even my basics sound like The Matrix
I’m more vivid than Michael Bay flicks
What I say tricks, then it lay clicks to rest like God after day six
They left fallin’ from missin’ they opportunity
At the door nor death’s callin now they breath’s stallin’
And who could touch me, fuck who you read about
And haters, I weed ‘em out the same way I do my dutchie
I’m a maniac on track the way a train react
With smart bombs for dummies
And Dum Dums for braniacs
They only have a few minutes of fame
They caught flame and my pen is to blame
I get it in when you pretend it’s a game
The way racquetball and tennis became the game’s finish
Nine outta ten is exchange
And I’m tremendous, it goes without sayin’
With my pen insert, it’s sort of introvert
It’s not about playin’

[Refrain Chorus: Elzhi]
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye

Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye

[Outro: Stokley Williams]
The time has come for us to stop messin’ around
Cause once you know that I like having you around in my life
Oh baby
So many times I want to hold you
I want to say I love you softly in your ear
Oh baby
Don’t keep runnin’
My heart is yearning for your love

Keep runnin’
Can’t keep runnin’ in and outta my life
Keep runnin’
Can’t keep runnin’ in and outta my life
Keep runnin’
Can’t keep runnin’ in and outta my life
Keep runnin’
Can’t keep runnin’ in and outta my life
Keep runnin’
Can’t keep runnin’ in and outta my life
