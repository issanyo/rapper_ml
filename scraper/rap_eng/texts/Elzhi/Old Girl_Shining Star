[Hook: Melanie Rutherford]
Old girl, remember that you're a star
You shine, even when it seems afar
Remember who and what you are
Cuz girl, you are a shining star

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
This to ya single parent mothers
Raisin' the youth in the gutter
No phones, spendin' days
At the booth with ya numbers
Baby daddy left you
When ya stomach and your breasts grew
You thought that he was special
Only if you just knew
But you don't need him, and it sucks
He ain't leavin' extra bucks
When it's freezing
Catch a bus, just to feed 'em
I know at times your situations seems pretty bad
It's gonna get better, my golden treasure
Without you, sunshine it wouldn't be no day
You just started shinin' my way
Now all my ladies say...

[Hook: Melanie Rutherford]

[Verse 2: T3]
Yeah, I know it's hard for you, yeah
Got ya moms kinda concerned
Didn't trust him that much
He just delivered the sperm
Then he was out just like them color levis
Medium shirts, Mayn buckles, and Adidas
And through it all, she never threw it in your face
Had to work two jobs, get a smaller place
And she stayed in church, renewing her faith
Kept her head above the water
With just minimum wage
Trying to keep her boy about the hookers
Where she from, dog, it ain't all good
All my mothers say...

[Hook: Melanie Rutherford]

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Girl never let life get you down
With shaka, sit you down
It's beef, face to face
When you leave basic faith
Just keep your head up high
It was once said to cry
It's good to get it all out
You should get rid of all doubt
For you the truth, that I adore
And it's really cuz
You never has your kids feel more poor
Than they really was
You worked your fingers to the bone
Just to keep the ringer on your phone
Lights and heat up in your home
Yeah

[Verse 4: T3]
I hope you take it as inspiration
Don't let situations, try your patience
It gets rough, but you'll weather the storm
Always came with a hustle when the right was smores
So we wrote this song, just for you
Cuz it take a lot of guts just to do what you do
Most couldn't understand or walk a mile in your shoes
Plus the love that I got, we appreciate you

[Hook: Melanie Rutherford]

[Outro: Elzhi]
All the ladies say...yeah
To the single parent mothers
Holdin dem bridge cause  they gotta go to the laundromats on Sundays and drag they kids with em
All the ladies say...(Bounce)
To the single ladies
We feel your pain
We got love for you
