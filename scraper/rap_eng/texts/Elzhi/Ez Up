[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ez up, Ez up, yeah baby Ez up
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ez up, Ez up, yeah baby Ez up

[Verse 1 T3]
To my thick chicks all across the world
You know a nigga kind selfish plus a hunger for girls
Soft fragrance designer clothes
To the hood rats to the ones who pose
From the actresses to my main misseses
State to state where you find my mistresses
Various dames that are blowin' me kisseses
To that I 'main insignificant
Got me wrappin' my package more than niggas at Christmases
Ladies I promise that I know what your wishlist is
Makin' you cream girl in various instances
Gimme the chance I'm the man I'm mister just
Aww naw legs to the wall
Them drawers comin' off girl

[Chorus]
Baby girl, you drivin' me crazy girl
I can not control
Ez up, Ez up, yeah baby Ez up
I can't enough girl
When I'm at the club girl
In your city show
Ez up, Ez up, yeah baby Ez up

[Verse 2 eLZhi]
Pretty faces surround me, they blow me kisses
From far away in Cartier glowing lenses they show a interest
Beautiful like the Pharrel and the Snoop thing
Pierced tongue ears hung jewels on the hoop rings
And all over it's the same story different name
Cause you give me brain and quick to claim that you my main shorty
Gotta be smart enough to make it on the dean's list
Genius, jeans fit, clean from diseases
Cool and down to Earth
Gucci around the purse
Bugie never shoes be matchin' with a poofy leather
Body curvacious Armani skirts bracelets
Furs and splurge cause she work places
Flirtatious a freak in the bed a woman in the street
Toes is done up showin' her stomach in the heat
Race is open, your taste in clothin'
Is exquisite, sophisticated motion

[Chorus]
Baby girl, you drivin' me crazy girl
I can not control
Ez up, Ez up, yeah baby Ez up
I can't enough girl
When I'm at the club girl
In your city show
Ez up, Ez up, yeah baby Ez up

[Verse 3 T3 + eLZhi]
You ain't heard about the things we doin'
Exotic spots where the water's the bluest
Takin' long routes south various routes where it's secluded
If you the type I like we can definitely do it
Got a fetish for a well-groomed piece with a pedicure
Hair done, cleaner than a fresh pair of Air Ones
Sprayed with the perfect fragrance
Belly ring, a tattoo of the name she threw on her celly screen
Gotta have hood in her, cook a good dinner
Well spoken Louis bags with Chanel clothin'
Short and tall thick in the right places
Proportioned and all when she strip to her night laces

[Chorus]
Baby girl, you drivin' me crazy girl
I can not control
Ez up, Ez up, yeah baby Ez up
I can't enough girl
When I'm at the club girl
In your city show
Ez up, Ez up, yeah baby Ez up
