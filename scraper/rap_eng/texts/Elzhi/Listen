[Intro: Amber Navran]
Listen
What you're searching for

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Is it alright if I talk to you for a minute
How I feel about our potential as a unit
Maybe it'll kill your doubt or
Maybe you recall
What we had'll truly fall
For the only sane idea in a screwy ball
We were 2 out of 7.6 billion
Building, wielding answers, filling blanks
With a bed of banks building
We were good money
Life was grand
Then it all changed so my world stopped reverse back
Then revolved strange
I seen something I ain't know existed
True immersion of the universe
[?] cue immersion through a person
Cause I understand you
Was more than a man
I was someone you could'a ran to
Nothing like Andrew
We was just on the phone
Talking about science and sake
The day your hand slips in my jockey with your finger all rocky
Newlywedding out of Rio, I thought that I was your Neo
Before you left me scarred like Pacino
Sniffing the kilo
I don't love that

[Chorus: Amber Navran]
Listen
What you're searching for is all right here
Listen
It's just waiting for an open ear

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
I truly thought that you believe in what we could've had
We were moving fast
Wasn't sure if it was good or bad
It's been proven as time slips away
It can heal or reveal how you feel about a person
Are they real?
And I still think about relating to my struggles with depression
Feel like I had rest with Satan in the pit of fire
For the longest time, he was sucking oxygen out the room
So you were a humidifier
I did admire days you drove over and prepared a entree
We burnt one watching Eric Andre
Made out to The Secret, then you left
You were my soulmate
Would've paused a planet in a rotatin'
Then gave you the herb
Though that's half the percentage of what you were
We could've surfed
The islands of Brazil when we hit the turf
If you chose space
That's just a dead relationship in a closed case casket
No exposed face

[Outro: Amber Navran]
Listen
What you're searching for is all right here
Listen
It's just waiting for an open ear
Listen
Hate grows in the heart of those who won't
Listen
