[Intro]
Yeah
I know you looking for that fire
I got that John Blaze shit though
Yo, I know y'all just want two 16’s, so
I’m just gon' spit it like that
For real

[Verse 1]
So that’s exactly what you’re getting
Me spitting a couple written verses, the first is ‘bout Quentin
Young & wild, brung a child on this planet he doesn’t claim
Scooped chicks using his cousin name and plays a dozen games
Thinks he knows it all, still tries to fit in like when your clothes get small
Following in those footsteps then walked towards exposed pitfalls
Momma kicked him out of her house ‘cause of his poor grades
He left right out that door straight worse than before, made
Money on the streets with elites, in no time there's receipts
From leather seats and fleets, rolling sweets, and tucking heat
Since that metal’s been on the cop providing, it’s like
Riding a bike then catch you with your chain slipping, pedalling on the block
Bang, bang, bang, he finds himself inside a shootout with some rival crew
Thinking ‘bout survival through
Traffic speeding while bleeding it’s graphic, blood leaking more than an ounce, shit
At 16 hours before his daughter’s birth, he was pronounced dead

[Hook]
Damn, say you wanted two 16’s
I’ma give you two 16’s
You say all you want is two 16’s
Then I’ma give you two 16’s
Yeah, I’ma give you two 16’s
Yeah, I’ma give you two 16’s
Yeah, I’ma give you two, one, two, one, two (two, two)
Listen as I run through
Both of these tales, I wish I could undo

[Verse 2]
She was pregnant at 16, you would think maybe if she felt the baby shift she
Would not be as angry with herself for getting down on her first night
In the back of a Crown Vic as them sounds kick
Nauseated, moving around, sick to her stomach, missing class
Kissing ass to make up a test with the study, listen, pass
With flying colors, always evil eyeing brothers
Since her baby father don’t claim her child and probably denying others
At first you thought “I don’t need him, I’ll just give him his freedom”
‘Til she finds out a girl knows him, that’s who she buys her weed from
She was told that he slangs with his cousin dealing
What she thought Dylan was his name that she wasn’t feeling
So she made a call, got some young, wild niggas to spot him
Knocked him on his bottom, pointed at him and shot him
What a shame, that was around the same time that her water broke
She had a child but got arrested, missing the first words her daughter spoke

[Hook]
Damn, say you wanted two 16’s
I’ma give you two 16’s
You say all you want is two 16’s
Then I’ma give you two 16’s
Yeah, I’ma give you two 16’s
Yeah, I’ma give you two 16’s
Yeah, I’ma give you two, one, two, one, two (two, two)
Listen as I run through
Both of these tales, I wish I could undo
