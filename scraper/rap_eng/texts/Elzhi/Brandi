This chick, this chick, this chick
Fly fly fly

[Dwele]
Yeah yeah

I asked can I get a taste now
Punch strong love you've got me slowing down my pace
And I gotta vision of you going down my waist
Never coming up until I get you out them cups
What are those? DD?
You different from my last chick Moey who was a little chill and too bubbly
See, you got me talkin funny to be around you is no good
You only here to take all my money from me

[Slum Village]
Oh oh

Chillin in a Palm suite
Listenin to R&B
Feelin all comfy
Poppin up bubbly
Seen that set, lovely
Loved it, it must be your lust in my undies
Livin on the front street yelling
