[Verse 1: Malaki]
The KGB make this stage twice as dangerous as these streets
Malaki and Binary form all these spontaneous beats
Formed the lyrically elite, peace to the conquistador beats
When we unsheathe our swords and the One Man Army brings beats to boards
We tame your angriest beats, defy your atheist beliefs
Malaki will get a crowd of paraplegics outta their seat
When I strangle the mic, I mangle your ass slow and painfully
Be thankful you still alive or the faithfully while the frames catch records eye
You chose to live dangerously tanglin' with me
You can't hang, I'll make Jack the Ripper look like your guardian angel
Anger me, I'll give you enough mic cable to hang yourself
Place your name on the waitin' list for hell with the rest of the cell gangsters
And gashes on your back after lashes with the mic cords
Warlords storm stages makin' mic stand pipe bombs
And Molotovs out of Krylon Cans, meet my demands
Or you'll have a Michigan mic massacre on your hands

[Verse 2: Senim Silla]
Bio-hazardous Agent Orange, Silla's airborne
Infectuous rhyme lectures spit quick and effective
Dangerous, lethal languages of slang could kill
Murder he wrote, an assassin would rename my skill
Senims a rough son of a gun keep razors under my tongue
Strike with enough force to puncture a lung
I'm lyrically harmful, literally speakin'
Emcees I'm browbeatin', demeanin' and ill treatin'
Get introduced to mines and meet your demise
I despise rap guys and all they wack ties
Cause in my eyes, all men are not considered equal
Especially if you ain't one of Binary's people

[Verse 3: Texture]
I'm what you askin' for, I'll give you that plus a classic more
And delivery, verbal total package raw, the mental matador
Mic heavyweights to shake the planet core
With one verse got you thinkin', "Yo, cancel the war!"
You flirtin' with death, better off dancin' with wolves
Or stabbin' yourself in the vocal chords with cancerous swords
After this track, ya hit the streets recruitin' new thugs
'Cause we got your squad shook, holdin' hands in group hugs
The die-harders, and [?] is like a monster in your closet
Challengin' us is like playin' a possum with a carcass
You could never win, hope your DJ specialize in medicine
'Cause the Athletic army conquers and divides your regiment
The MI residence known for talkin' shit
And got my reputation rippin' in the heart of "the mitt"
A fortunate gift, bent lines that'll force you to quit
Drop the mic and have you writin' for the source or some shit

[Verse 4: Elzhi]
These niggas backstab like they Benedict
Drag they face in the mud 'til they mug looks like they bit a brick
Bust like Magnificent Seven on horseback
Unsigned but find my rap quotables in the Source ma-
Gazine for fiends who fiend for guillotine sword stat my tongue is the stinger
My brain is the stun gun, It's deadly as the one you put your thumbs on and squeeze from the bottom
With fatigues but I'm hidin' in the trees so high I can breath on a falcon
Jump down, sneak up on a emcee from the rear
A predator with the literature, it shows through my signature
Deliver more, did just for your clique
Whats even more sick is I'm a visitor
And plus they be diggin' more
Scopin' the perimeter, sink within the floor, Terminator 2
Split your brain in two while you snore
Keep sleepin' my train of thought is heat seekin'
Fade your poor squad like drippin' ink from my pen and addin' Clorox
Murder emcees and leave my fingerprints on doorknobs
The court finds me guilty, might be different in the Lord's eyes
An evil genius, I play a villain in a movie
Fingertips touch the ceilin' from the revealin' of the uzi
And its bloodsport, open up my mind form watch those slugs walk gracefully
Where your head reside is now a vacancy
Elzhi-on, cut the head of a python
With a butcher knife long, when I die I want my third eye bronzed

[Verse 5: O-Type Star]
A sip of liquor, the flow picker with sensational wool
And skin like brass, the gravitational pull
Of two stars that's rotatin' like space vinyl
Had me on the train like Lionel... Richie
Broke then rich again, Illinois to Michigan
Spartan conditions I won't bitch but switch again
Style like tracks to smack who can't stab me
I build excitement like Pontiac Grand Prix
Wider is better, Iller is deffer
Im tryin' to count zeros and hoes like Hugh Hefner
The O-B-A-F-G-K-M
My squad all stars, suckers we slay them
O-Type Star I blew spots when I said things
My thoughts take flight like black hawks with red wings
Uh, slicker than a oil refinery
I hit your whole system when I shine with the Binary

[Verse 6: Lacks]
Acknowledge the presence of perfection
I could give a fuck about you lyin', sayin' your style is free when its tense like Les Nesman
A freshman in this game and we tryin' to graduate
I blow minds but you be blowin' funk from the last ass you ate
Now let me ask you straight before I start trippin'
Is it me, or does somethin' about your lines sound like Nas cause it was bitten?
Your motor skill is outright and meanin' to act fast
I hump rhythms while you couldn't Poke a Tone with Trackmaster
The rap bastard without Wu-Tang
Though, realistically most males are
The differences is I don't judge my manhood by what my sales are
If its about the boldest, I'm the most
I'm coldest since winter
To make you stop the tape and inspect the deck like you down with the RZA nigga
So I advise you to remember your roles
And tell your crew if they got beef, than I can bring the dinner rolls
Over [?] with swing snares and fat drum kicks
I sing sweet soliloquies of souls and hold up chicks
I mean chickens runnin' off in chickens like bestiality
And for any nigga that want it I drop the beat for you to battle me
Simply to prove at your expense, I be's the shit
Squeezin' squares into little pieces like Cheese Nips

[Verse 7: OneManArmy]
A whack emcee is something I could never be
That's like growin' dreadlocks while you takin' chemotherapy
Theoretically, pen and paper is the recipe
Alphabetically I'm comin' after you like the letter V
If you ever step to me, the worst is yet to come
You'll never get the best of me, call it like a referee
Call it destiny, check the melody
Break the law of gravity and lyrically catch a felony
I make it harder for the next emcee that's my specialty
Rappers better be tryin' to rap ahead of me
I'm a hard act to follow I could prove it medically
I'm sick in the head, I could move a crowd with mental telepathy
Expect nothin' less of me, top pedigree
Rap assassin, blastin' with syllable weaponry
Shoot the sheriff and the deputy, don't be testin' me
Whoever think they fat can get the Dick Gregory

[Verse 8: J.U.I.C.E.]
Its countless how many rappers over vinyl we scar
I just rotate and dislocate your spine if we spar
Even freestyle in French when I'm rhymin' abroad
I'm in the party rhymin' off Bacardi Lime and cigars
I rattle rafters, you battle rappers tryin' to be hard?
Rap's blackjack and JUICE is like a primary card
You secondary, that's why you gotta rhyme with a squad
But genetically ya'll niggas is designed to be flawed
Yesterday I spit game at your dime and she paused
To let me see her thick frame and outline of her drawers
So the chance that you been lookin' for is finally yours
But see I'm deadlier than havin' cyanide in your pores
I spin a rhyme, my hand is intertwined with the cord
Slowly the mic is ripped to bits, my dynasty tours
Big JUICE when signin' off with the Binary Stars
The only person who could kick a doper line would be God
