[Verse 1: Elzhi]
I run the track by lacing the strings and the bass kicks
That's the basics
And then wear the loop like bracelets
I will forever write thorough
And if you were to see how much it grosses out, you might hurl
Just shows you how my future's looking brighter
I shouldn't be tooken lighter than that welterweight division decision when booking fighters cause I'm
As big as the Brooklyn writer from the East Coast
As a deceased ghost and here's an increased dose
Of that raw exquisite
Haven't been down since I came up
So I feel like I defy The Law of Physics
In this time I'm containing the plan
To drop a jewel on whoever the weakest link in your chain of command
I know these lines up high above your head propelling
Y'all hit the mainstream to catch air time something like parasailing
I know where you felling, but I don't care and telling
I don't spare melons, so on the snare I'm tearing your cerebellum
