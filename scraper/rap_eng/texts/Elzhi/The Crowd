[Chorus 2x]
See this is how it goes down
And come all the way from the bottom
Lifted up from the ground
And take it to the sky
Until it's over the clouds
Make it feel like heaven
So it's felt by the crowd, crowd, crowd

[Verse 1]
Over lies, you will be pulverized, beneath Jehovah's skies
In a cloak disguise, my goons follow you like cobra's eyes
Shorty still, peeling them sporty wheels, Lord he illing
Cold as the place you keep your forty chilled
See my mind is on, a level more deeper than monotone
Off a line alone, I shine like the finest designer stone
So what you mainstream and you hot, when did you gain steam?
It makes my brain scream, your career shoulda remained dream
You may fall, I'm AWOL, I'm out with heaters and spray all
And put you in a hole like robbing Peter to pay Paul
Try and boast, and ain't lying close to what I diagnose
I can fry and roast, any guy, till they a flying ghost
Beyond peons, beyond eons, till there's neon Klingons
Close encounter of the three kinds
But there's not a response, those niggas ain't crazy
That phrase be the illest, while I kill this in phase 3
Check!

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
The fly talker, over your head like a Skywalker
Purple la sparker, mark ya, circle eyes darker
I could give a f*ck, got a flow that leave a river stuck
You hear, deep in lines, keep a nine near the liver tucked
Bread winning, stroll with a whore, inside my bed linen
Legs up, like she up on the floor, with her head spinning
Wind milling, then feeling like I'm worth ten mil when
The pens spilling and concealing mic
I toke greens, blowing out smoke screen, poke queens
Leave em with soak jeans, you're the definition of what joke means
I'm star status, like blowing lights through out the far stratos-phere
It's clear who's repertoire that is
Pursuit white, and f*ck a shoe price, my cheese outgrew mice
I'm too nice, cut through slice, I'm seeing you twice
The lead pacer, been making moves like Speed Racer
Indeed trace a line that f*cks with your mind like a freebaser weed lacer
Yeah!

[Chorus 4x]
