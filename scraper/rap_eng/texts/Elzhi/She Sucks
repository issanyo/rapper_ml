[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Late night
Slipped in the clip in case I got to grip the nickelplate tight
She made me catch the freight right off Linwood
In between the Calvert and Glynn hood
I text her 'round 10 just to see if she's been good
The last time we kicked it was nothing how I predicted
I sat down with my ticket and thought just how wicked
Her vibe was, let me describe cuz it was eerie
She clearly doesn't like Jesus pieces on your jewelry
Because I felt something was forcing my hand to tuck the chain
Way deep inside of my Ralph Lauren, it fucked my brain up
I wasn't right for a week
I still feel creeped out, tonight's sure to speak it
I just got off the stop for a block and I was in horror-shock when I heard the door unlock before I knocked
She was a dime, XXL, spread fine
If looks could kill, she'd make the headline in a fake mind
I sat down, she poured some red wine, I reached for a cup to sip
Did I drink blood, or was I bleeding from my upper lip?
I stood up to check my appearance in the mirror
Looked behind me, didn't see her but could totally hear her
She asked me would I like to live forever (Would you like to live forever?)
I turned around, she was still on the couch which made it clearer
That she either practiced witchcraft or she might be...
Before I could finish the thought, why did she jump up and bite me?
I blacked out, woke up with dirt in my mouth
And then I felt insects crawl on my skin next
I've been vexed but never like this
I tried to break free, didn't think it would take me a millisecond, yet I'm still affected
Standing over the hole, I was buried and covered in dirt like Mike in the video for the Thriller record
I smell blood, saw some bums urinating
Then I felt my teeth growing through my gums, irritating
The hell out of me, but it couldn't match my hunger pains
So I sprung to drain, blood contained in they Jugular vein
I saw an old couple
I left them both lying dead on the road, scuffled
Yo, I can't control these urges
I feel sorry if any poor soul emerges

[Bridge: [?]]
As he leaves the scene, he follows two teenagers
From behind he attacks them
While he's feeding off of 'em and sucking their blood
He senses someone in the distance

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
At least my senses aren't failing, inhaling's intense
I can smell in the distance of somebody dwelling
I heard 'em pull up, stop, now she's excelling past
Her foot on the gas, yelling, I'm behind, trailing fast!
I'm trying to quiet the stomach rumbling 'til it's mumbling
I know she's sorry that she stumbled into my world, it's crumbling
I'm sure it's troubling to hear me dive through your back windshield
Grabbing you while you're driving, now your car's tumbling
Over and over with my teeth in your neck
I knew she was dead before I check, I stepped out of the wreck
Jetted downtown for seconds, though I should go in Sweetwater
Not to eat all the wings but to bring a complete slaughter
Women scream, men were hollering
After I sucked the life out this waitress holding a dollar in her hand
Now this body's on the floor, but I still want more
Walked out the door and got shot up by the police, it was 4
Bullets bounced off me, I caught the last one with my teeth
Then there was this brief silence from the police chief
I ran up on him so quick he didn't know what hit him
Bodies drop, after I bit 'em they begged for me to get 'em
Slowly I saw the night turn into day, it was concerning
And usually I would need some herbs to burn in a "J"
Instead, I headed inside this abandoned building
Cuz I read any time the sunlight shed, I could be dead
So lock your doors and don't come out after nightfall
You might crawl in your own blood if I bite y'all
