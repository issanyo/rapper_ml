[Intro]
Check me out y'all
It's Elzhi in your area
Bout to back slap and bury ya

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Check, now let me show you how I blaze it
Leave niggas in amazement on ways spit
Shit trickier than a maze get
Everything I drop raw cut you like a chop saw
You should stop, like when a cop draw before he drop y'all
You get your fort crushed actin out of sorts
You don't support us, you must snort dust ridin' the short bus
Cause I'm an animal, scratch that I'm the manual
Pull out, swingin' the metal like mechanical
Movement, soon as the groove hits I prove that you need improvements
Since I'm so smooth with whatever I maneuve' with
And I ain't braggin' player you get your spot got
What I jot is hotter than the dragon's lair
It's only right you should show me light
Because the flow be tight, I wouldn't slip on a snowy night
I vex, now who should I bomb next
New schooler or an old timer like a timex
Simple minded with a complex
My glare disrupt the cameras
I keep promoters scratchin' their name out and tearin' up they banners
When I write cigars flare again
The bars buried in the song is bout as strong as barbarians
Far scarier than the Omen
Chicks give me dome in my home while I'm sittin' spittin' poems watchin' Conan
This for my real heads and paragraph addicts
I kill the air time impairin' the asthmatic
It's like that, you know it's like that
I'm who you internet haters want to strike at
Don't make me show up to your porch with a spiked bat
And leave your front and rear tires on your bike flat
Defeat and kill, delete your skill you think you sweet until
I cut you off and leave you in the cold like you haven't paid your heating bill
Fuck your squad and your street appeal
Eat a dilznick clique fleet until my kicks is in your leader's grill
For real

[Hook]
It's Halftime
It's Halftime
It's Halftime
It's Halftime
