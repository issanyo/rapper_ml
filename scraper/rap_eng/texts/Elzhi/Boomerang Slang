This is the unfinished stories of the streets, baby
Don't get it twisted cause the globe already does that
Live and learn, watch the Earth get a turn, 360
Boomerang, violent kid'll burn
Where I live at is so cold
And models that grow old
Cause niggas die young and go broke! Haha
Is it the way we is?
Is it the way we live?
How do we portray them kids? Negative!

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
This is the code of the streets that ain't wrote yet
Niggas starving, it's getting nippy
Red face taking cold steps
This trigger finger is itchy
The other hand is sticky
Robbed this nigga at gunpoint
The cops bust quickly
Before you know, dead
Bloodshed in the snow
5-0 shot him, one nice cop, the other rotten
Same cops the same night
Stopped a guy for no reason
Put his face against the windshield
He fucked it up while he was breathing
The rotten porkchop kicked his teeth in
Did it in the alleyway so nobody would see him
He recovered from bleeding
So the next evening when he got stopped
He said "F That!" and started squeezing
Bulletholes through the cops' car
After firing, he heard sirens
Dropped the gun, wishing he got far
Got his grandmother thinking
What did she do wrong
Got his brother putting like the same exact suit on
He wore to his boy's funeral
Over cocaine, fast life, fast cars
Money and gold chains
He sits through the sermon
While the preacher preaches
The same preacher that knows the bible
But don't know Jesus
He takes your hard cash and hard lass
In a Lexus Coupe
Pipped out with a chick
Busting his life out
Took a long stroke
The condom broke
And he didn't know it
Dick on the clitoris
Constantly spitting on it
Where the period at?
The stomach getting bigger
She needs money for the child
"Give it up nigga!"
The dough that she takes she spend it up on drinks
Puffing cigarettes while she's still pregnant
She didn't know until she had the baby how bad she was affecting it
Now he barely breathing, he could've been the next president

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
For the karma
Walking in the streets of the arma-
Geddon, young cats spitting fire armour
Never see sweet 16
Parents grow sour
Casket in the dirt, you throw flowers
Cats taking cold showers, for eyewitnessing
Murders, snatching purses from senior citizens
We living in the last days, the innocent
Bystanders in their pathways
24 hours turn into half-days
The gat stays in the thug's waist
Another hard decision that the judge makes
Murder was the case
The streets will get you beat
Like Tina Turner's face
Before she fought back
Stray bullets floating off track
Killing young kids, jump roping on their property
Where they once lived
Plus niggas ain't living properly
And we gotta be
These days
So we hustle like old folks in cabarets
Looking towards the bright side
Through a cave before we caved in
But the future looks dark, within a grave
Like a waistband, my arms and legs stretch when I awake
I thank God for it
Life, it takes God for it
Many led by this redhead guy
With a pitchfork and two horns
Lounging in a place that's too warm
For my nig-get-out-of-view point
I try not to do wrong
But I want to be in that limo askin' for the Grey Poupon, for a change
I'm sick of saving change from a coupon
I'm a rhymecaster that'll do
The same stuff that Ice Cube's on
With a suit on, and got bread
Thaw out your cold heart with hot lead
It's like a coin toss
Who got heads, who got tails?
Which one you thinking with?
It seems to me that cats would rather rest in peace instead of keeping it
