[Refrain: Dwele]

[Intro: Elzhi]
Magnetic, know what I’m talkin' about
House Shoes, know what I’m talkin' about
SV, know what I’m talkin' about
Feel this, feel this, feel this, this here
Hodgepodge, know what I’m talkin' about
Lackadaisical, know what I’m talkin' about
Dwele, know what I’m talkin' about
Feel this, feel this, feel this - this here

[Verse 1]
Her aura’s a radiant light,, very fly, like takin' a flight
On a plane, she’s not plain, she’s eccentric
From a distance I’ve admired her, feeling like the man she wants
I’m far from, but yet tryna get close, though she knew me all along
I’m the cat that’s in the club that know every word to every song
Dancing to tunes like these, like leaves I’m falling, praying that she catch it
It’s a cold, cold world and I steady put myself out there
Wearing it thin, but eventually becoming lovesick
She’s beautiful, her personality sweet as her fragrance
As usual, my mouth shuts, speaking in body language
I shift to the corner with her, eyes shift to the corner
Watching these clowns approach her
So deep in the culture
I ease over, for the feelings of being closer
She make niggas with big vocabularies be at a lack for words
Hoping she stay, she goes by, when her back is turned, walking out the door
Suddenly it doesn’t seem as hype
It’s like the sun losing its beam of light
Spoiling my day
But when I see her face, it looks dipped in Oil of Olay
It’s hard to concentrate, wishing these arms were lakes
Cause there's a chance that she would dive into 'em
I need someone as real as her, she’s the inspiration for the rhyme

[Refrain]
Sarah
Someone as real as her in my life

[Bridge]
Kool Dee, know what I'm talkin' about
DJ Q, know what I'm talkin' about
Binary Star, know what I'm talkin' about
Feel this, feel this, feel this - this here
? know what I'm talkin' about
Wajeed, know what I'm talkin' about
Marquise, know what I'm talkin' about
Feel this, feel this, this here - this here

[Verse 2]
Her smile is like the sunshine, she can brighten your day with it
Even in the club, slightly dark, you can’t miss it
Your inspiration, though do not know who you are
Just hope that when you hear this you think it’s beautiful
As a gentle breeze
Memories of you stump through my brain
Can’t hide my feelings, they bust through the frame
When I see you
Wanna be where you be
Like the robot that’s off of T2
And you’re Sarah Conner
Straight killing me with your ability of creativity
I’m willingly at your feet, massaging them til you go back to sleep
Capture deep thoughts, of us taking walks in the park
Watching the sunset, I haven’t experienced love yet
But I know it’s more than getting your fingers and tongue wet
Or straight up having sex with a female you just met
What I’m saying I can’t get over it, yo
You’re the inspiration for the rhyme
