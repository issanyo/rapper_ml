[Intro]
Same old thing looking out this window right here
I wonder is it ever gonna change?

[Verse 1]
Hi I roll with the slum and throw my condolence to sons
And daughters depart just to walk with their marvelous father
And skies that are blue as the eyes of a portrait of Jesus
Every nigga that's ignorant is supporting my genius
Increasing my anger at babies deceased from a hanger
Somebody’s baby's deceased from police where there’s danger
It’s not safe in the streets for little Patrice and Kilayla
It’s blood on that man’s hands that has nothing to savor
Willing to die before his eye it’s spilling and cry
His tissue is damp, his fist holds a pistol that’s clamped
How can I not watch the news? It’s in front of my house
It's so close, you swore you saw the gun in my mouth
Near shot three houses down from the weed spot
A fiendish plot through broken English between the lots
Sick of it all, house is burnt from the brick to the walls
Neighborhood kids are involved instead of kicking a ball
They’d rather kick in your balls

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I roll with the slum, your hand out, I don’t owe you a crumb
So therefore, before me, you’d rather spare yours
Ain't coming off a dime cause many dimes I lost
And I won’t be crying as a president in this present and awkward time
They pour me a drink, I be at the bar with the preacher
Ready to spar, stress got my whole head in a jar
Taxes is high, planes jacking they crash in the sky
They’re masking their cry cursing out God asking him why
Women with no class be batting the lash of their eye
Pathetic, some women pregnant but sucks on the glass to get high
I seen robberies by a fiend afraid of God
I never seen a fiend robbing me for not a thing
Honestly, we lie to the judge about sex, violence, and drugs
Girls with fake IDs get inside of the club
And catch a nigga up off the liquor drunk
Make the cock jump, get knocked up for a bigger chunk and
