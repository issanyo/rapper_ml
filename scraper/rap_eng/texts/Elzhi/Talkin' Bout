[Chorus: Khrysis]
What'chu talkin' bout?
Let me tell you what to talk about
Is you gon' stay?
Is you gon' be out?
Let me tell you somethin' 'bout
You gon' love me or leave me alone? (x3)
Don't fuck wit' me, I'm in my zone

[Verse 1: Khrysis]
C'mon, Sample mutilator
Sound manipulator
You ain't talking paper
Ta ta, I'll see ya later
No love for Jericho
Ha ha, You's a hater
And if you turn coat nigga, you's a traitor
See, me and my mens and them is out for the dividends
And in a game where nigga's trying to win
See look, I ain't got time you see
Wasting my energy fucking with some fake ass friends
Look, gotta go is what I tell them hoes
I been beat, you ain't nothin' but a discrete foe
Think you on a level, but you don't even know
You ain't even part of team shit, but you thankful though
Look, now don't get me wrong
'Cause I ain't got no qualms
Just gotta deal with you from the distance of arms
It's all love though
But you don't be giving it back
This shit be wack
Let me tell you something
Look

[Chorus: Khrysis]
What'chu talkin' bout?
Let me tell you what to talk about
Is you gon' stay?
Is you gon' be out?
Let me tell you somethin' 'bout
You gon' love me or leave me alone? (x3)
Don't fuck wit' me, I'm in my zone

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Hey, you not a hater you just colorblind
We both live a life, but you prefer the duller kind
Afraid to be yourself, so you follow trends
I'll throw the book at you for looking through a hollow lens
You not on the same page, I know where this novel ends
Cause I always get the last word
No rival wins taking shots
That's a blast heard
All around the planet from the plaster
Ghetto bastard who stash birds
To the class nerd
With spatula and mastered
Find a joy in this since I'm a poisonous tarantula
A hazard
In fact you are
Listening to what I'm calling wizardry
From another plane where you can't take a plane and visit me
Exquisitely put if I say so myself
And you won't cause you're vanilla
Hate to be the one to tell ya
That my setbacks isn't failure
And you'll never be this stellar
Sure you're laughing to the bank, but you whining in the cellar
And that's sad, I'm sorry
You can't see I'm special like a stradivari in a college grad pad who pushes dat Ferrari
You don't get graphic one bit and I know
And I could tell because my big cousins had atari
And it's not really a surprise homie
Keep your nose out my business and your eyes on me
I'm up when the sun down and rise slowly
I get love from all the kids and every wise OG
So I'm sayin

[Chorus: Khrysis]
What'chu talkin' bout?
Let me tell you what to talk about
Is you gon' stay?
Is you gon' be out?
Let me tell you somethin' 'bout
You gon' love me or leave me alone? (x3)
Don't fuck wit' me, I'm in my zone
