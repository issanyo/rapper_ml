[Intro]
Y-y-yo, ch-check this out
Check this out
Check this out

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Been pushing a pussy wagon, back when I wore my hair bushy saggin'
Pullin' out hundreds when the kush be baggin'
Collapse frontin' while I rap somethin'
To make your eyes bigger than computer boards with the caps button
Was quotin' show fees before I could even grow goatees
Ho please, I'll have your panties sliding like snow skis
I'm hot as a summer day with no breeze
I'm from the hood where they throw threes and other O.D.'s
And you say you want a classic, niggas is asscheek
Signing last week, now let the head of the class speak
And drop jewels like professors at top schools
Pop tools and cut into niggas like scalpels
This for my shorties holding rock, it's the aim
Rich in personality but want they pockets the same, I feel 'em
I'm better than before, I'm letterin' the flow
And if you slow, I'll put you in the know, know

[Chorus: Elzhi]
It goes one for the money (ONE)
Two for the fame
And every rapper in the game sounding the same
They the reason why this industry isn't tame
I light it up, now let 'em feel the flame, flame
And let 'em know (x4)

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
I snatch your queen's heart and
A cross between Martin Sheen and Dean Martin
Puffin on the green garden
Grippin where my jeans partin'
Givin' you the middle of an instrumentals
I'm blackin out like a widow just a little
These flames can't hold a candle to me
This man'll truly, fire Cubans and handle Uzis
You findin' him commando movies, it's on the hush hush
On tour I'm in the five-star, even the bus plush
Now what? I smile at your foul slut
She's on the low wavin', like how I like my hairstyle cut
Yeah I'm the nicest, compatible with ices
A cannibal with Hannibal mechanical devices
Oh, now can I get at Joey, whoa
Bangin the audio, the realness I only know
Niggas is trippin, not as if they wig is a flippin
Like [explosion], no matter how big is your ship and
Promote me to flare, I'm Smokey the Bear
You soft as Ethiopian hair
Me fallin' for the okey-dokey is rare
Now, we can go toe-to-toe, you're below the pro
And if you slow, I'll put you in the know, know

[Chorus]
