[Verse 1: ElZhi]
You shouldn't find it puzzling that me without pieces not a complete picture
My aunt said we need Jesus and she repeat scriptures
Spent half my life rolling up choke and getting slurred
Sipping booze and hitting herb, that's my written word
Them life ills will have you quitting 3rd - semester
Until the rest of your school year for cool gear, see
I'm tryna break the chain and give you a jewel here
But chains and jewels the only thing a fool hear
Everybody's on molly's and wifeing a stripper
With mafioso personas living life in the hipster culture
Like it's a [?] or true religion with [?]
Ir some hotter name it's not a game so let me coach y'all
Claims, I went through that phase
I'm just tryna keep it a 100 days between teenage pregnancies and runaways
The dead beats without the sonic [?]
Shoot up the block, bucking will have you ducking under strays
We just out here tryna function
And conjunction with young punks and know-it-alls like [?]
Flunked in the 12th booster from the retail shelf
Not focused on health, wealth, knowledge of self

[Chorus]
Not focused on health, wealth, knowledge of self
Not focused on health, wealth, knowledge of self
Not focused on health, wealth, knowledge of self

[Verse 2: O.C.]
Just imagine you could wash your body inside out
And wash always all the garbage and filth
Absolved of all wrongdoing, sin, guilt
Innocent blood spilt
Left in the hands of a [?] is the soul of a 4 year old
Hoping to survive with a chance to grow
[?] my word, it's the half moon overlapped by the [?]
But that's embedded in the star
That universal flag being flown
An ode to the Gods and the Earth in the name of Allah
The flesh only a vessel
For any knuckleheads popping shots to turn your shit into a wetsuit
Instead of hitting them streets, youngs need to be hitting the books
Forget rap, fuck balling y'all
Niggas proud that they is hanging at the mall
Only cool while you a teen while a [?] is 25
Experimenting with ways to get high
Ain't too many other ways to say the words "die
Dead, death, demise", people open your eyes
[?] human harddrive with data stored in my archives
Experience to best [?]
Rather get fooled once your learn on what you call the 3rd coming
Use your brain, forget what's below the belt
Try not to be swayed by anyone else
And try and practice
Health, wealth, knowledge of self
Health, wealth, knowledge of self

[Chorus]
Not focused on health, wealth, knowledge of self
Not focused on health, wealth, knowledge of self
""
Not focused on health, wealth, knowledge of self
Not focused on health, wealth, knowledge of self
