[Intro: Elzhi]
Cold world..
Elzhi, SigNif
Giving you the realness

[Verse 1: SigNif]
Smoking (?) used to be my pastime
So caught up in the world  when life passing by
You know the things that don't matter
But fill your mind with matter
Thinking you need the (?), glints and glamours
Until you realize everything that glitters ain't gold
That one thing that sets you apart and sparks your soul
Powerful and empowerment illuminates the  globe
Truth be told, I wouldn't have been right where they are
If I ain't follow the planets and connect the stars, but still
No regrets is the motto
No longer filled with sorrow
I used to find at the bottom of my liquor bottles
Poured out for Nate
Then who's patiently waiting
And struck 'em in the lung
That's just the daily
Depending on where you from
Hear the day gone, tomorrow
That's why I inspire for better tomorrows
It's bigger than the latest traditions
You look way better when you stand out
Not looking for hand-outs
Positive reinforcement removes all doubt
Our transitions
Health, power, love is why we livin'

[Hook: Signif/Sample & DJ scratches]
Open your eyes, get wise, do the exercise (word!) (x3)
(?) that I play to win

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
You may find it puzzling to me
Without pieces, not  a complete picture
My aunt said we need Jesus, and she repeat scriptures
Spent half of my life rolling up, choking, getting slurred
And  sippin' booze and hittin' herb, that's my written word
Life's ill but have you quit third semester
Into the rest of your school year for cool gear, see
I'm tryna break the chain and give you a jewel here
But chain and jewels is the only thing a  fool hisses
Everybody's off molly's and wife's into strippin'
With mafias and personas
And living life into that hipster culture
Like it's a cult or true religion of couture or some hotter name
It's not a game, so let me quote y'all
Plays, I went through that phase
I'm just tryna keep it 100k among teenage pregnancy and runaways
Them dead beats with a son prefer a gun to raise that
That shoot up your block
Buck and have you duckin' under strays
When you just here tryna function
And conjunction with young punks and know-it-alls
Like me who flunked and
The 12 booster from the retail shelf
Not focused on that health, wealth, knowledge of self

[Hook]
