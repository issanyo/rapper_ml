[Verse One: Talib Kweli]
My nigga Khrysis be offering you some heat, yup
You other rappers I'm offering you a seat
Matter fact, take several
Park it like valet
Page is to opera to writing is ballet
If your taste is exquisite then maybe you'll make a visit
To a place where you can get, support it and make a difference
That's of course that's only if the recording remain consistent
And you make a straight line to the store, the shortest distance
To travel the globe over the rainbow, the pot of gold
My career is to the point where I've learned to enjoy the road
Taking flicks in front of famous cathedrals
Sip mojitos on the beaches of Rio with Bobbito
Mardi Gras in the streets with Phontiggalo
Stopped at Curren$y crib for some extra loud piff to blow
Hit this tree and the smoke digital
If I diss niggas no subliminals
No syllable rap
They say I'm off beat, the flow criminal
Y'all niggas just beat off but no centerfolds
Y'all niggas softer than some dinner rolls
Check
All these fake nigga been exposed

[Hook: Phonte]
One time for your mind baby
One time for your mind
One time

[Verse Two: Elzhi]
I come through, geared fresher
Flow's tighter than clothes in a queer dresser
We'll have you leap from a pier, we'll call it peer pressure
You've been hoaxed tell your kinfolks
I give beats heart attacks, pen strokes, lead poison pencils
Turn anthems to lullabies and lobotomize instrumentals
You traumatized so you stop, tears stalling
Is it wrong I
Make the song cry to get the top tier falling
Doughboys say I'm swagged to death
I'm bad ass to the white kids bagging meth
I spit fire you just got the dragon breath
Your ex off the rag an F
Luckily I had a Magnum left
I pointed right where her thong at
And knocked it loose and like Dr. Seuss
I gave the cat the long hat
Shift the bed with this gift instead
Ill as pointing an infared at an infant head
That's a bad look
Like on the nights when your dad cook
Wishing he had took, culinary courses with a grad book
Fuck your sorry flows and your sad hook
I'm still glad that you mad shook
Elzhi

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Phonte]
New Tiggalo, new Tiggalo, new Tiggalo
Yo, the audio controller
12 bar cardio, rap game Georgio Moroder
Tigga told ya
I soldier through the coldest winters
Now the jeans sitting right where they supposed to fit him
The battle fill ink but no beginners
Not bragging I just had to be clear
Go and grab you a chair whether she dark skin or Vanity Fair
Give me a chick rocking natural hair and red roses in 'em
And I'm an animal
Nah, I'm an onimal, oops, I mean honorable
Giving you niggas what you paid for
I lay law like Derek and the Dominos
Play your position with me? Call it an honor roll
Test me, God bless your soul
I'm bugging out call pest control
Nigga vamamos
To the west coast, eating Won Tons
With Krondon screaming "Fuck one time for Guantanamo"
We shoulda did this shit a long time ago
Cause every single line, every rhyme I wrote
It's nothing but that scheduled two opiates
Stimulates, yeah nigga all kids of dope
I'm Langston meets Slang Ton
Don't need a track for that bottom feeder rap, you niggas is plankton
An AK to a paint gun
Competition? Nigga there ain't none
At all
Hahaha
