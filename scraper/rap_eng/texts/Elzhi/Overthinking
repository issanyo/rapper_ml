[Verse 1: Elzhi]
I try not to overthink
But what if backers fronted me with
Money like you drove a brinks truck?
You outta luck
Cause what I'm jotting is career ending
Atmosphere bending to whose ear lending a fear
That they'll see it appear trending
On the sites in they web browsers
I've dodged bullets, demons, chicks who try to get inside of a celeb trowsers
To extort 'em, fake pregnancy, and post a picture just for likes outta bordem
Sometimes I think that could've been me
From how I used to spend free time out in NC
NY, LA, or trips having meetings up in capital
Which could've blew me up and have my haters ducking shrapnel, but
It wasn't meant to be
I used to wonder why collapsing under my
Blunders by the time that I undone a tie
I had to wear while up in court when I was sued
But now I see it's not the size of your problems
It's how it's viewed, so I'm thinking
You either change the way you see things
Or keep poking at a hive and wind up getting bee stings
Cause I was looking up to D Boys pushing Sebrings
A steering wheel and three rings
Keep a bank roll and drop a G-string
We sing they praises when they serving time
If it's moms who they were serving
Would I think that they deserve a dime?
Let me think, hell no
And that's off the top like a elbow
That fell low from the turnbuckle

[Chorus]
Or maybe I'm just overthinking
Or maybe I'm just overthinking

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Everybody got flaws including me, I'll admit that
I'm just a kid born in the city where the skinny nigga's die trying to get fat
And sit at the round table thinking once I found a down label
We could build a foundation if the ground stable
My very first contract I signed jerked me
Stuck a toe inside of waters that one would define murky and I almost drowned
With bricks tied to both ankles
That's how it all goes down behind the scenes
I know what you thinking how you slip up if your mind is king
Know-it-all smarty pants, they would've hemmed your designer jeans
I was green with a dream and if it manifested
These anorexic pockets would have 100-grand investments
My pops wouldn't have to find a job again
And maybe my aunties wouldn't be beefed out
Cause that's a problem when they sister gone
They know she would insist upon
Building back up a consistent bond
Until they not existing on the planet

[Chorus]
Or maybe I'm just overthinking
Or maybe I'm just overthinking

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
All these thoughts inside my head keep me up at night
I queue a beat, plug in my earbuds
Let it bump and write something heavy, or is it something light?
Do I base it on pumping white or thoughts about Trump and right
Wing conservatives can talk about these haters and how payback triggers nervousness
Revenge is best cold when you serve the dish with no preservatives, but
Maybe this just ain't the track for that
To do the multi-syllables than acrobats
I need knock it out the park
Crack the backs with championship back-to-backs
Anyone who's tryin' to short change me is paying active tax
I'm just saying
Nigga's never want to see me win
Part of the reason why I've been through these situations I'm in
Maybe it's in God's plan and I've reached my fullest potential cause
I've felt that I was dealt a odd hand
If I play my cards right then I could win it all, but
What if I lose myself?
Every second that every minute fall

[Chorus]
Or maybe I'm just overthinking
Or maybe I'm just overthinking

[Outro: Alan Watts]
And all so called civilized peoples
Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive
We confuse science, words, numbers, symbols, and ideas with the real world
Most of us would have rather money than tangible wealth
And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed
And to read about it the next day in the newspaper
Is oddly, more fun for us than the original event
