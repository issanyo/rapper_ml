[Hook: Elzhi]
I dated a lot of Misses and I gave em nicknames
So it wouldn’t be flat out disses
See when searching for Ms. Right
It always turns wrong
You won’t believe how long my list is
I’m lookin for that right miss
But I can’t find her
I know nobody’s perfect and this is a reminder

I hope when I see her I don’t have on my blinders
And maybe next time I’m lookin
Life would treat me kinder

Yeah I’m lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for that one
I’m lookin' lookin' lookin' for that one (x2)

[Verse 1: Elzhi]
Yeah we could start on this note
I dated a young miss who put words in my mouth
We’ll just call her “misquote”
Deleted this one for good
And went on date two with someone I couldn’t relate to
“Misunderstood”
I wish thunder would clear from my existing storm
From when this chick thought I was rich
She was “misinformed”
Heard me on the radio and tried to get this cake
The match was all wrong I couldn’t live with “mistake”
And when this resonated I jetted so fast
Can’t forget the one I met with no class
“Miseducated”
After her I found another and felt she could’ve been miss right
But she never saw my potential
That’s “mis-sight”
Proving wrong to move along isn’t the easiest
I’ve been hearing how “mischievous" steals out of CVS
Her place of work so she needs to get her wrist slapped
Then there’s the miscarriage that happened to “mishap”
With all that misfortune she lost it you get the gist snap
The way that “misbehavior’s” always into fist grab
Stays walkin out on checks after eating
And key up your car if she think you’re cheating you see

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
You ever seen someone in a room and pacing back and forth
With a lot on their mind holding it in that was “miscommunication”
When we argue it’s heated
But it was nothing like the last relationship that was told to me by “Mistreated”
Never saw someone as damaged
Honey’s misused
Another had money issues
She was “mismanage”
Had to give food for thought to “mislead”
Who swore I’d throw her this bread
Toss her salad and give her fish head
Instead I resisted
The problem was dispatched
Then I got with “misfit”
We were a mismatch
So I stepped to end it cuz of her past
Could she be “misrepresented”
Nah she disguised it
Unlike the girl who was taught all men are dogs
That was “misguided”
So I dismissed her meaner than I ever thought I could
Then in the hood I met “misdemeanor”
What

Nah you gotta be kidding me
I can’t do it

I’m lookin for lookin for lookin for that one
I’m lookin lookin lookin for that one

I’m lookin for lookin for lookin for that one
I’m lookin lookin lookin for that one
