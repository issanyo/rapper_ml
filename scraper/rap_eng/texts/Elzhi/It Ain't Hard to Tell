[Intro]
Yeah, it's Elmatic, check

[Verse 1]
Yo let me start you from the Genesis far from where the finish is
No role models just empty bottles of Guinnesses
Roaches in the ash tray toss and gettin' fast cash the
Ski mask way for those who never passed class
Born inside of poverty
Probably they stack bread and crackheads never looked alive to me
Robberies and liquor stores tricks and whores
Reality was sick as yours so I blow trees stronger than sycamores
Now wait, let me get back to my past
As I rewind mine, before I got on the 1-9-9-9
Mother gave birth to this divine mind
Born with this arm, leg, leg, arm head like a Qur'an line
No paternity but as I'm turnin' three I learnt to be
Strong, pops moved along and he never returned to me
Thought I'd feel anger for an eternity
I bottled my feelings inside with
Pride is never swallowed followed
By killers they rise ride off of endo
Bustin' off cartridges through your window
Different from the one from my Nintendo
That line shoulda been my intro, here's when I started rappin'
Lookin' up to younger thugs with they heart at trappin'
Starter cappin' fly wheels
Thick chicks in high heels tellin' me my skills is sick
I was only eight slowly fate took its turn
I'm where hookers earn, money and drugs sell, it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
Check, I went to Peck Elementary, Lesenger, Cody
To graduate I had to take a semester with homies
Too busy writin' none of my time went into my assignments
Jot a line as my rhyme schemes maneuver like the Heimlich
Use to ditch class for bitch ass
Picture me a lot shorter my vocal pitch sound like it switch fast
Young and rebellious, hangin' with failures who L twist, the eldest
See me saggin' that's what my belts is
That's round the same time my mother is ill
Collecting mental scars waitin' for the others to heal
No one saw the vision everyone's beyond blind
Can't think about finding the meaning of life when tryin to define mine
I won't pretend its cool, was wet behind the ears
So I had to jump in this pool graduate and finish school
Niggas was mad that I owned a diploma they was just sleepin
They shoulda slept til they domes in a coma
I'm that bad shorty who been through the land of Berry Gordy
With a buddha man that grew a grand but gained 40
That ain't rich in all my hell I wasn't born with a silver spoon
Just a wooden one upon my kitchen wall
Now I rock shows from Cali Groves down to Wichita
Feelin' like a grew ten feet a couple inches tall
Just thinkin' back what was to doubt about my view sunny
Now it seems too funny cause even new money gets counted out
Nobody believed, only ones was J Barb or JAE.B Group
Money investments everyday be cool
You thought I fell, it ain't hard to tell
