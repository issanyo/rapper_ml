[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Truth be told, this is who you call the truest out the newest fold
Till people watchin our every move like it's the Truman Show
Coolest flow signal to my crew the cue to go with they finger on triggas
Gunpowder under cuticles
Newest flow shows as ugly as warzones, yeah
Shit is ugly as Lady Gaga's wardrobes
Word to Dilla his verses iller the words are killer
Ain't heard nothing this legendary out since the birth of Thriller
My human nature to expose teams seems these rapping niggas are girls
Pre-teen Billie Jean, seems they love when I'm performing, they laugh at your performance
My shit is Martin Luther, your shit is Martin Lawrence
Touring on a plane in somewhere in the world new
In the clouds listening to Stevie Wonder's 'Girl Blue'
So true dude is feeling confident and feeling taller
I'm feeling on top of the world without the fear of falling

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9]
I said niggas known to talk a lot, get chopped up
I say I'm sitting in a coffee shop, I dont mean I'm at no starbucks
Just me and Vishis roll around like we don't need no niggas
Just these triggers we old school like Dean Pritchard
You can't take the heat, get yo' ass out the kitchen
Matter of fact take yo' ass back in there and wash those dishes
I'm ready for war I know what you're thinking I already said it before
You better get ready for this deadly medley whenever we here to record
I can cut into you in my sleep like stepping to the weak
I can catch a bullet in my teeth
I'm known as who not to go at, don't ask just never tempt me
You can bet yo' ass, you'll have no ass you bet against me
Ugh I'm in the best shape of my life lyrically I don't even write seriously
I just fuck around
Like a rolling stone I lay the hat in many homes
Bad boy like Diddy Combs
Shoulders' what his whole entire city on

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Yo you need to be amputated I'll snap you in minutes
I left Detroit rappers in fitteds decapitated
It's not a dumb threat cuz though I'm not what I'll become yet
I'll challenge some vet and stick it to him like a drum set
Clap the matic I'll flip like an acrobatic slap fanatics
With murderous rap mechanics
I'm worth pay, pockets go green like it was earth day
That's why I blow cake like it's my birthday
The way I roll - envision a city blob
Half of yall shouldn't rap, y'all do a shitty job like colon cleansing
And I'm dying to test ya, no denying I'm applying the pressure
Like the iron I rely on that lie in the dresser
Several try and get they Kangol crushed
Cuz my skills ill like slicing up devil's pie off of angel dust
You left behind me looking shadowy it's fatality
To ever try to handle me like a piano key
