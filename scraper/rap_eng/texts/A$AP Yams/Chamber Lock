[Intro: A$AP Yams]
Ayo TyY wassup man it's the big homie himself. Lil Newport, the Puerto Rican Bobby Brown A.K.A Carlos Xantana bake, pop a pill, I see you out there in London with them London boys [?] boys and all that, with your four wheelers and all that. Stop hitting my line b, ya heard

[Verse 1: A$AP TyY]
Chamber lock, deep thoughts don't ever break the code
Niggas get in that position, somehow they fold
Count your blessings, fuck that, don't ever tell a soul
Scared the devil in her eye, she posted in that room
Consequences that I gotta face
Trapped in the struggle, I gotta find my way
Body feening, probably leaning, she my only fix
We make it last forever, cause it's hit or miss

[Hook]
Tell me where you wan' go
You've got the gun in your hands
I know you've got plans
Tell me where you wan' go
You've got the gun in your hands
I know you've got plans
You should pull the hammer back
You should pull the hammer back
You could be on the attack
Girl I know you'll take me down, down
Girl I know you'll take me down, down

[Verse 2: A$AP TyY]
Body in that red ghost, that's hell on wheels
Devil in that red dress sitting cross bloody heels
See how wealth feels, the way of living costs
And through these burning bridges, a nigga still made it across
It's hard to see these niggas smile, or see the crooked smile
They've been plottin' for a fuckin' while
Lord forgive me for my sins I just wanna win
Story of my struggle, but get into the end
Grind until my last breath
Killin' shit, 'til there's nothing left
We thirsty for a mil, my niggas out to kill
(We thirsty for a mil, my niggas out to kill)

[Hook]
Tell me where you wan' go
You've got the gun in your hands
I know you've got plans
Tell me where you wan' go
You've got the gun in your hands
I know you've got plans
You should pull the hammer back
You should pull the hammer back
You could be on the attack
Girl I know you'll take me down, down
Girl I know you'll take me down, down
