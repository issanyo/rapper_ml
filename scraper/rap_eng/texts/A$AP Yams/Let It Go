[Intro: A$AP Yams]
Trap Lord season begins, now repent your sins
This Yamborghini on the motherfuckin' check-in
You know I had to hangglide through for this one and all that
You know, we at the all-star game right now, eyes closed (swish)
Shootin' fade aways from half-court (elbow in the rim and all that)
Tomahawk jams (y'all still in the D-League doing, uhh, layup drills)
Ya heard? Ya feel me?

[Hook]
Kill a motherfucka with the Magnum .44
Find a chump slumped, nigga, magnum on the road
Body full of bullets when they found him on the road
Lay a fucker down, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload (Fergie!)

[Verse 1]
Ride Maybachs like Ross (huh) 550 Benz, four doors
Praying for my niggas, they lost, dying no thing, they wolves
Riding on a gang that floss, multiplyin' by the gang that bucks
Pull a 9 on anything we spark, ménage ain't a thing, they whores
Pussy so good, need more, let me get in those drawers
5-0 in the corner store, he heard all them claps with a round of applause
Spit at your back and you lie on the floor, rat-a-tat-tat and you gon' see the Lord
Bitch like horse, X In Her pores, want more sex, all in her jaws
Molly!

[Hook]
Kill a motherfucka with the Magnum .44

This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
Semi or the tech, spray it at him then reload (Fergie!)

[Verse 2]
I'm grippin' the Mac and you under attack
Spit at your back and you taking a nap
No heart a be pumping, your body relaxed
You talk to me dumb and that's how I react
One arm in the air like I'm waving a cab
The 9 is a bitch and she making it clap
I'm palming a 5th like I'm giving a dap
Be ready to scrap when you talk to the Trap (my condolences)
You are now talking to a boss, Lou Bang still ride in the Porsche
Two thou' for the grill they cost, white gold teeth, no floss
Young Trap Lord like Doss, two bitches in the crib, no drawers
She rocking the mic with her jaws, I call that bitch Nicki Minaj
She pop one pill no cough, when shit get real she spark
Givenchy my bitches bought, smoke that life 'til you niggas see God
Getting head in the foreign cars, get the head from the foreign broads
Hasta la vista, señor, pussy ass niggas a see Allah (Fergie!)

This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go

[Outro: A$AP Yams]
So it's like, "Fuckin' Problems," platinum (bling, bling)
LongLiveA$AP number one album in the country (bling blow)
Sold out tours, what's next? Trap Lord
Let these motherfuckers have it, let 'em know we not playing this year
The limb's never been so relaxed, ever, heheh
It's lonely at the top; all this shrimp, nobody to share it with
We ain't trippin' though, heheheheh
Y'all walkin' 'round with wrinkled silks, looking crazy, nah mean?
Pay your dry-cleaning bill and all that (pay that, pay that)
Cause it's like, it ain't even a competition no more, hahahahahah
