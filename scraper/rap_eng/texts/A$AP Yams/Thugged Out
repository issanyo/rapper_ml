Yeah
Cozy Boyz
I'm feelin' extra sexy right now
You know what I mean, sexy clothes
I got my Velour jean jacket on
I pull up to the club... on a camel
With two different throwback jerseys on at the same time
One on top of the other
My mixtape, comin' soon
Hosted by Tay Diggs, ya heard
Shoutouts to the Asian lesbian demographic and all that
We bout to kill em ya heard
Y'all don't want me to start singin', feel me?
This is my song for real no doubt
Got the coke way makin' me feel thugged out
Hit em with the... hit em with the adlib
I'm feeling thugged out
Nah mean, I'm in the VIP
Posted on the couch, with the Allen Iverson arm sleeves
With the matching warmup suit
With the windbreaker pants that tear off on the side
Let me rip them bitches off and get real cozy on hoes
It's the Puerto Rican R. Kelly
Reppin' TP2.com in this bitch
ASAP mob
