[Verse 1: Kid Monroe]

I'm a fuck this bitch
And then I'll cut her off
I need more than her
Cause one just ain't enough
Are we fucking after my show girl or nah?
Bring your friends and I'll watch you take it off
I heard you fuck good
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow
I wanna fuck your friend, is that a problem?
I'll hit it once, and then I'll pass it off
Just tell me is you wit it girl or nah
We'll get high as fuck and then we'll have some fun
Find another bitch, and have a threesome
We'll go all night until we see the sun
The way you throw it, I think you may be the one

[Hook: Kid Monroe]

Show me is you really 'bout your money girl, or nah?
Don't play with a boss, girl take it off

Is you really bout your money girl, or nah?
Can you really take dick or nah?

Would you die for a nigga or nah?
Would you lie to a nigga or nah?

Oh Nahhhh Oh Nahhhh
Would you ride for a nigga or nah?

[Verse 2: Young Clyde]

It's the King of CoD up in here
Do you like it when I hit it from the rear?
Shorty come and fuck with the real
Mother fuck them lames, they don't know how you feel
She sweating, she be poppin' pills
Shorty say she just looking for the thrill
Well, get your ass over here
I know how to make you feel
After I get that ass, shorty you already know the deal
(What the deal though?)
You gotta get that ass out of here
I ain't cuffing these hoes

Shit got me hella throwed
I been whipping up the work
I been moving this snow
I got a couple choppers
I ain't afraid to let them blow (CoD)
