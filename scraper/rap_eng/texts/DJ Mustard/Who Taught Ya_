[Verse 1]
Paul Pierce with two chains, boy, I'm twice the truth
Every time I call 'GAME' when I step in the booth
John Wall or John Wilkes cause I'm lyrically booth:
Packing 34 clips, "born ready" to shoot
Call me Josh Smith cause my verse so smoove
Slamming stanzas down, Blake Griffin of the books
Baller Ballmer bombing, watch my Redick for the proof
And call a doctor for my river flows sicker than you
Call me Dr. DeanDRE cause I got beats for the Cubes
CP3PO going gold when I hoop
Winning all Bars Wars: I'm linguistically Luke
And I'm ballin' out Gwinnett, so tell the Drake I'm a Lou:
He can call me for verse, I can ghost for his crew
Y’all thought I was finish, y'all thought I was thru?
Flip that beast mode on, going Fetty, going zoo:
Got a smoking Lit Queen, Fairie cooking for my two

[Verse 2]
I make loaves by hot prose
I suppose I singe shows:
Similes like stoves, ammos or Patmos
Getting close to close: my fatal flows attracting dough
Imposing blows upon you lows cause I'm the one God chose
Step up on the stage, and I be pouring ambrose
I keep it 100 like I'm on the Nightly Show
I keep it 100 like my name is Jalen Rose
Spitting fab fire flames like I'm 2Pac arose
Running past y'all cause I know like Bo knows
All about the ball, boy: I'm posted down lowe
Esp to the N, ESPY for my flow
Syntax for the slaughter, flip on ABC -- GO!
