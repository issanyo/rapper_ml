[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, oooh
Ah yeah, ooh
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been doing my own thing, let me sip my drank and roll up this weed, ooh, ooh
My bitch said she done with me, now I'm on my own, so come fuck with me, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign with Wiz Khalifa]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (Whoa, whoa)
I'm getting hoes and these villains
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, I'm getting hoes and these villains
If you ain't cool, we ain't chillin'
Kick the girl out in a minute
Better yet, a second bitch tryna talk reckless, you heard?
I don't play about my word, getting in the whip, girl, you getting curbed
Pour another sip, roll some more, I'm smoking herb
Tryna turn up with the kid, all that shit is for the birds, fuck you talking 'bout?

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been doing my own thing, let me sip my drank and roll up this weed, ooh, ooh
My bitch said she done with me, now I'm on my own, so come fuck with me, ooh, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been doing my own thing, let me sip my drank and roll up this weed, ooh, ooh
My bitch said she done with me, now I'm on my own, so come fuck with me, ooh, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been doing my own thing, let me sip my drank and roll up this weed, ooh, ooh
My bitch said she done with me, now I'm on my own, so come fuck with me, ooh, ooh
