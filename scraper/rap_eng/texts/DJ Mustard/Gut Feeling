[Verse 1: Ella Mai]
Something in the walls
Something in your walk looks different
Something deep inside
Got me wondering why I don't understand
Why I can’t put my finger on what the fuck is up
What's missing?
You're distant, and I’m spinnin'

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Don't ask questions usually
Got the answers that I need
Intuition tellin' me
Mmm

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
I just have a gut feeling
Don't know why I don't know what it was, really
But the more we touch, the more it starts killin' me
Killin' me
Just have a gut feeling
Killin’ me

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
Uh, lookin’ in your eyes
I've been feelin’ like I'm crazy
'Cause I'm goin’ through your phone, look for somethin' wrong
I can't find nothin'
I must be trippin' tryna listen to my intuition
Sayin' you're guilty
So baby, just tell me
I never asked before but right now I don't know what's goin' on

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai & H.E.R.]
Don't ask questions usually
Got the answers that I need
Intuition tellin' me
Mmm

[Chorus: Ella Mai & H.E.R.]
I just have a gut feeling
Don't know why I don't know what it was, really
But the more we touch, the more it starts killin' me
Killin' me
Just have a gut feeling
Killin' me

[Bridge: Ella Mai]
I'm the first to speak my mind up if I feel a way
Not the type to be here cryin' in my pillowcase
Is it nothin'? Or somethin'?
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Ella Mai & H.E.R.]
I just have a gut feeling
Don't know why I don't know what it was, really
But the more we touch, the more it starts killin' me
Killin' me
Just have a gut feeling
Killin' me
Killin', killin' me

[Post-Chorus: Ella Mai & H.E.R.]
Starts killing
(Ah, ah, ah)
Starts killing
(Ah, ah, ah)
Oh, woah
(Ah, ah, ah)
Killing me
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah), yeah
(Ah, ah, ah)
Killin', (Ah, ah, ah)

[Outro: Ella Mai]
A: Aware. I was guarded while my guardian angel never parted ways. Just stayed and layed with me. Not nakedly, just waited patiently. For now, I am aware. And as I stare into your soul, I see it clear. Can we start again from here?
