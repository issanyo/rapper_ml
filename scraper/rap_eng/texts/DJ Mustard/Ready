[Intro]

You been patiently waiting
Yeah, I see you

Loving your body
You sexin' all on me

Let you watch me while I stroke it

Inside, you don't stop me Annie
Because you know I make you feel right
Make you feel right

You're biting and scratching and kissing on me
Everything your doin' lets me know
