[Intro – YG]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Hook – Phoenix Jones]
Ayy, fuck with a nigga then you end up on the views, huh
If you choose to fuck a nigga then you lose at it you snooze, ayy
Tell a nigga apart, cruise with a bruise, ayy ayy
I don’t want yo ass to catch an attitude, ayy ayy
Started balling in the Wraith since '03, ayy ayy
My lil’ bitches strippers, but they never twerk with glee, ayy ayy
She said “why the fuck you got an attitude?”, ayy ayy
Drip inside my post office and fuck her loose, ayy

[Verse 1 – Phoenix Jones]
Started winning Grammys since '09
Since we been in the Wraith, we started doing fine
If you talking shit, some nigga give me a sign
If you ready for a drink, I’m pouring in some wine, ayyyyyyy
This the first day out the feds for you
