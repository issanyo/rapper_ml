[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
It's gon' be your favorite song
(Mustard on the beat ho)

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
When I be in the shower, she know that I leave it alone
So for at least a half an hour, she be tryna break into my phone, oh
I don't know what I did to make her feel insecure
But she gon' have to trust me, cause I ain't even doing no wrong

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
She won't ever get them four digits, aah
No she won't ever get them four digits, aah
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
(tryna unlock my phone)
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She won't ever get them four digits

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
She so damn nosy
Don't know why she be listening to her friends
That's probably why she on me
Cause they niggas be cheating on them
She just wanna be up in my photos
She just wanna be up in my videos
She just wanna be up in my emails and my DM's

[Hook: Eric Bellinger & Fabulous]
She won't ever get them four digits
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
No she won't ever get them four digits
(I pray the Lord my code to keep)
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
(If I should die before I wake)
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
(I hope this girl don't crack my phone)
She won't ever get them four digits
(Face down, break her off
Face down, break her off)

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
What's crackin' baby, other than my code?
Just came off the motherfuckin' road
Already it's another episode
I think shawty undercover on the low
You know I be talkin' on the phone real late to 'em
She be walkin' in on me getting straight to 'em
I be like "okay baby stay calm
It's just Jake from State Farm"
On the real, what you searching for?
The thought upsets you, seeing that I hurt you more
I'm out the game but you know that I gotta keep it player
Every night I say a prayer, she won't ever get the four digits

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
She won't ever get them four digits, aaah
No she won't ever get them four digits, aaah
(She won't get them now, specialy won't get them now)
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone (unlock my phone)
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
She won't ever get them four digits, aaah
No she won't ever get them four digits, aaah
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone (unlock my phone)
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She won't ever get them four digits (digits, digits, digits, digits)
Digits (digits, digits, digits, digits)
Digits (digits, digits, digits, digits)
Digits (digits, digits, digits, digits)
She won't ever get them four
