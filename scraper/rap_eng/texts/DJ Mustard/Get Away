[Chorus: RJMrLA]
Sometime I need to get away, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Just need a lil drank, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Sometime I need to get away, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Just need a lil drank, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
It's the way I'm feeling

[Verse 1: RJMrLA]
That's the way I feel, that's the way I feel
Should I hop up on the jet or should I stay and chill?
I took my girl to Hawaii 'fore I pay the bill
I came out with no lights but I have cable still
I think my body gettinâ€™ immune to these pain pills
It's like I'm never in the mood, it just ain't real
I probably made it out the hood, but couldn't escape jail
Trying to show my daughter, if I say I will
I know so many been influenced by the way I did it
All this pressure I'm enduring, and hate came with it
I'm still the last one standing offline and on stages
All this shit you holdin' inside is outrageous
Trying to get over my pride, it's overrated
'Cause what I used to want in my mind, it's slowly changing
Gotta get away, but I just came back from vacation
I was on the way, got blinded by my reputation
Find me centre stage, but I can't send my location
My surroundings ain't the same
All this privacy invasion, that the problems got me raging
Ask me back into submission
In this war zone, my uncle battling with his addictions
Sometimes I am feeling alone in the crowd, I'm conflicted
In the moments when my family's most proud which I don't get it
Poor drinker, book the ticket

[Chorus: RJMrLA]
Sometime I need to get away, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Just need a lil drank, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Sometime I need to get away, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Just need a lil drank, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
It's the way I'm feeling

[Verse 2: RJMrLA]
Hard times overdressed in a timely fashion
Some cry over stress, can't disguise your passions
Dead weight on my shoulders, got my legs limber
A black man with more limits than a sex offender
Rolex the picture, Moet net the sipper
Your chance get slimmer, more bread that they give you
Don't know where half my money went
'cause I'm an extra spender
I just want my kids to have a better Christmas next December
I remember, all I wanted was my neck to shimmer
It got hot, I got right, and went left in winter
Ain't no reward for remaining real
Trying to deflect the swords, with the same shield
I got to get away

[Chorus: RJMrLA]
Sometime I need to get away, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Just need a lil drank, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Sometime I need to get away, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
Just need a lil drank, just tryna escape
The way I'm feeling
It's the way I'm feeling
