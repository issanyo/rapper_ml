[Verse 1 - Young Stoney]
Already fucked up, trying to do a keg stand
And nah I ain't gay but I'm thinking bout a dead man
Benjamin, Fanklin, life's a gamble so I always throw my ace in
American kush but damn I'm looking Asian
My swag like a Maverick
You up on average shit
I seen cold world on my power trip
Fuck you, pay me, I got that by the hour dick
Drinking till I'm out of it
Puffing on diesel till it's gas fumes
My joint be looking like it's past due
I'm rocking 2 piercings with no tattoos
All Adidas when I pass through
Corpus Christi is my new home
I already got ties, no need to put a suit on
I'm like a soldier with his boots on
Military minded, spit and change the climate
Nothing perfect but the motherfucking timing
I fuck yo girl and tell her tweet about it
She gave me head while I read, bitch read about it
If you keep yo shit 100 then we a thousand
My habits badder than bitch that you see me pounding
Lyrical heroin and my verse is like a coke sniff
Don't trip, drive her crazy but I don't drift
Go fast and leave her pussy like a crash site
I tell her to bring her friend but only if her ass wide
I mean so what she's bi, so what she's bi
And if I didn't fuck, so what I tried?!

[Verse 2 - Young Rigarus]
Sipping Hennessy, elementary I was getting head in Tennessee
10 years later these bitches saying they still miss me like I'm Drake but your fake
So for yourself take a break and get baked
Jump in the lake and yourself as bait, for a larger predator
I'm the top competitor
I'm light as a feather when I'm higher than tuition for Baylor
Haha bitch!
Stoney about to murder
I know you ain't' heard of me
The guy who fucked your chick and fled like a murder scene
She's a burden to me
Stressed me out so I burned a tree
I'm new to the game so I had to pay a learner's fee
Cypress Hill, taking hits from the bong
Fuck with me wrong, you'll never see right
Put up a fight
Electric flow make that light bright
So what I'm white? So what I'm white?
My kush is on fire, no feds in sight
Haha
On the beat with Stoney
Step up to us and I'll kick yo ass like a pony
Leave you lonely while yo chick blow me
Afterwards she tries to phone me
"Wait bitch, how'd you get my number?"
Making money even in my slumber while you losing money every mile in your Hummer
If she's a vegetarian, I got that cucumber
He we go!
These hoes in love with Tim Tebow cause he don't blow the weed smoke but we toke, she toke
All you faggots take after Home Depot
Home Depot, where all you garden hoes rest
Get attacked by hornets nest and leave you with the rest
Lame ass rappers screaming "We the best!", DJ Khaled
Every statement coming from you is invalid so we take a ballot
Then we take a ballad and toss you fools like a garden salad

[Verse 3 - Young Stoney]
Fucked up so I'm parking backward
Pardon my soliloquy
I'm my own enemy
I don't know sympathy
Open her legs wide before I go between
Hit it like I'm pissed off
She my bitch and I'm a big dog
Like a tag you get ripped off
I fuck the world till my dick soft
Then it's lift off
Light the kush and hit it like a punching bag
Can't buy shoes if my hat doesn't match
I'm the only option, fuck a running back
Smash yo face like a pumpkin patch
It's YS and Young Rigarus
Married to the money and power, I'm a polygamist
We be them Adida Gang senators
Twitter ain't' the only place they mention us
Driving in the HOV lane and I ain't see Jay-Z
Don't need no Blueprint, this that T-A-3 motherfucker!
