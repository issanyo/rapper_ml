[Verse 1]
You can say what you want
I'll do what I want
Maybe tomorrow we could see things differently, but
The way it's going right now
We better put it on hold

It’s your 17th message
In 17 minutes
I can’t reply no more
My head’s not in it
Told me to shut you down
But Ima put down this phone

[Pre-Chorus]
So patiently I’m listening
I know that you’ve been up waiting for me
Alright, I’ll tell you what
Before you go lay down, unlock the door
As soon as I get home I’ll be all yours

[Chorus]
Let me come inside
And we can reconcile
All night, all night, all night
It’s all yours
All night
It’s all yours
All night

[Verse 2]
I hear your're mad right now
But we can use a letter
Keep it built up, and I’ll emancipate it
I got a plan all worked out
So you can sit tight

Wouldn’t string you along without a reason
That ain’t good enough to deserve some pleasin’
I’ll make sure you never have a single dime
I’m puttin’ things right

[Pre-Chorus]
So patiently I’m listening
I know that you’ve been up waiting for me
Alright, I’ll tell you what
Before you go lay down, unlock the door
As soon as I get home I’ll be all yours

[Chorus]
Let me come inside
And we can reconcile
All night, all night, all night
It’s all yours
All night
It’s all yours
All night

[Bridge]
We can work it out
Beneath the sheets
'Tween you and me
Mustard on the beat
I have you
We be switching as we be flipping positions
I know you been reminiscing
Remember how good we fit in, huh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can break it down to the beat
One heart between you and me
Make you forget you’re mad at me
Remember how sweet this love can be

[Chorus]
Before you go lay down unlock the door
As soon as I get home I’ll be all yours
Let me come inside (let me come inside)
And we can reconcile (we can reconcile)
All night, all night, all night
