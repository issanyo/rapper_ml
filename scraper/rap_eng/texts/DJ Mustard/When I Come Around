Let me take you on a date, date
We ain't gotta wait
Tell me if you got an ex-nigga in the way
He can stay, I just want to get a little taste
And I see you keep your body in shape, look
I just wanna day, back
Damn you look good
Damn you look good, girl
And you look good, need to stop
Niggas came in, two shots
I'm waiting to hear Sugar Free, Quik, or 2Pac
It's the coast, t-shirt, flannel, no coats
A party ain't a party if my nigga can't smoke
Here we go, let me let me let me make a toast
To baby over there, cause she know I want to poke
No I don't - I just want to stick it in her throat
Drop out the house and go dippin' on the spokes, niggas know
2 12's in the backseat
Passin' by the kids, they yellin' that's me!" as I skate
Damn, what's with all this hate
When I come around, can't say it to my face
OK, niggas know I do stay paid
And niggas can get that fade
When I come around, niggas better quiet shit down
You niggas ain't buying Cristal
You sharing that drink
Fuck do I care what you think
I come through wearin' that mink
Niggas all drunk, I don't wanna hit yo blunt
I can fuck with any bitch that I want
Is that yo chick? Niggas looked over like "chhhh"
I did that back in '06
She was like wait, hold up, that's my jam
This the new Dom, bitch, that's my man
Try and get this money as best I can
Can you do it from the side baby yes I can
Just wait, I'mma beat it out like Cey
Goin' all night, just give me like 5 tapes
And I'm straight, dang, that's what I deserve
We gettin' money now, that's what I done heard
Yall be in the club with all them nerds
I be at the house wit' a girl on reserve
Whatcha gon' do wit' all them curves
Teach me something new right now I wanna learn
This ya turn, girl you gotta give it what you got
Ain't nobody givin' you a spot
This ain't no team, you ain't finna get no ring
Wake up girl, this ain't no dream, this my life
Champagne bottles on ice, come through feeling like Mike
You ain't my wife, please, I'm everybody type
Girl I got what everybody like
When I come around, niggas better quiet shit down
You niggas ain't buying Cristal
You sharing that drink
Fuck do I care what you think
I come through wearin' that mink

When I come around
Just when I come around
When I come around
Just when I come around
When I come around
