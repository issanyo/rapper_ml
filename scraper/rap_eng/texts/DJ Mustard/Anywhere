[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
What's better than the time being?
Dark skies never scare me
Fallin', I'll be right behind ya
It's still me, like the very first time

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' had to be this hard
Somethin' that I really want you
Somethin' had to be this far
Somethin' that I really wanted

[Chorus]
You could be anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me
You could be anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me

[Verse]
Because I've loved you, yeah
It's not important any longer to me
What are we even fightin' over? Yeah, yeah
It's not important any longer to me

[Refrain]
What's better than the time being?
Dark skies never scare me
Fallin', I'll be right behind ya
It's still me, like the very first time

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' had to be this hard
Somethin' that, I really want you
Somethin' had to be this far
Somethin' that I really wanted

[Chorus]
You could be anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me
You could be anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me

[Bridge]
I don't know what to do if you're not right beside me
I had to move, but, baby, you know where to find me

[Chorus]
You could be anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me
You could be anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me
You could be anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me
You could be anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me

[Outro]
Anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me
Anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me
Anywhere right now
It ain't hard to see
I'll be your light
If you say the words for me
