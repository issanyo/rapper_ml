[Verse 1: Kamaiyah & Travis Scott]
Hot girl, keep a black bandana
Gettin' jiggy like a background dancer
I just come through, stunt through (yeah, yeah)
I'ma set the waves and the standards
Pissed 'em off, now they all can't stand her
Why they mad?
'Cause they know that I'm the answer (ooh-ooh)
I give no fucks, so what?
No home trainin' no manners (yeah)
I'm sippin' Moet, I keep sippin' Moet (yeah, yeah)
These hoes be so pressed, but these hoes ain't no threat (yeah, yeah)
Disrespect me and I show no respect (yeah, yeah)
I show mo' neglect with this ice on my neck
I be stuntin', you know my team is big money
Chasin' that green like a junkie
I'm ham on the beat, they can't touch me (you can't touch this)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All I know, all I know is this

All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know is ballin' (yeah)
All I know, all I know is this, yeah, yeah (straight up)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Bust down, bust down, bust down (yeah)

Way too loud to interrupt now
All I know is how to do it for the set (yeah, yeah)
All I know is how to get it from the go (yah)
All I know is how to, and I'm the best
All I know is how to, and how to roast

Still, still rent still (yeah, yeah)
Still squad, still friends, still
Still runnin' up the bill
Still racking up the hill, still
Still goin' after bills, still (sheesh)
