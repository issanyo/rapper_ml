[Verse 1]
I ain’t looking for a cheap thrill
If I love I want to love real
Give me something I can feel
Po' me up, I drink it down and get a refill
I don’t just give trust, baby you and I-I-I-I
Something ignites us, like fire-ire-ire

[Pre-Hook]
I don’t want your money I just want your appeal
Kick back, Netflix and chill
All I ask is that you keep your end of the deal
Boy we got mad time to kill
Take your time
There’s no rush, we alright
I ain’t goin’ nowhere baby
Don’t you worry, we can do this all night
Put your hands up on my body
It’s a party, you know how to play nice

[Hook]
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it’s your private party, and we just getting started
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it’s your private party, and we just getting started

[Verse 2]
Do the right thing, keep scoring
Your team I’m promoting
We ain’t gotta take the fast lane
Slow-mo-mo, woah where you goin’?
Pace yourself with this love
And I’ma make sure that you always have enough
My heart on cuff
And I ain’t got no plans giving you up

[Pre-Hook]
It ain’t about your money I just want your appeal
Kick back, Netflix and chill
All I ask is that you keep your end of the deal
Boy we got mad time to kill
Take your time
There’s no rush, we alright
I ain’t goin’ nowhere baby
Don’t you worry, we can do this all night
Put your hands up on my body
It’s a party, you know how to play nice

[Hook]
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it’s your private party, and we just getting started
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it’s your private party, and we just getting started

[Bridge]
It’s ‘bout time for a little loving
Don’t be shy, come here baby, don’t you want to touch it?
Hands up on my body, ain’t no need for rushing
Ain’t no limit where we’re going, I want all or nothing
It’s ‘bout time for a little loving
Don’t be shy, come here baby, don’t you want to touch it?
Hands up on my body, ain’t no need for rushing
Ain’t no limit where we’re going, I want all or nothing

[Pre-Hook]
Take your time
There’s no rush, we alright
I ain’t goin’ nowhere baby
Don’t you worry, we can do this all night
Put your hands up on my body
It’s a party, you know how to play nice

[Hook]
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it’s your private party, and we just getting started
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it’s your private party, and we just getting started
