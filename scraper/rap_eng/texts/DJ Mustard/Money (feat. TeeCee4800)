Featuring YG, Cash Out & K. Smith

(Intro)
Um yea
Mustard on the beat, hoe

(Verse)
Big money, fish fat
New guns, go click clack
Bang bang, you dead now
Stead of workin, got caught, you in the feds
Ass up, face down
Early morning eating bacon and hash brownies
I’m in the slow lane, going fat though
I’m young and rich, you niggas mad though
I’m an asshole, I need a ass wipe
I got the Porsche cuz I’m addicted to the fast life
You a flip bitch, we know you
You just getting money doing what we told you
I’m in the A town with Cash Out
Crack yo bitch then I smash out
20 racks, I blow that
20 racks, I heard say you owe that

(Hook)
See I’m getting money
Iced out, see a nigga sunny
Hah, got a pocket for them bricks
Fuck back, I’m a partner for them licks
See a nigga topdown
Make a bad bitch wanna go down
See I’m getting money
Iced out, see a nigga sunny

(Verse)
See a nigga ice
Don’t play, I will put it in yo life
Yea, and you niggas better ketch-up
And you know you wanna be Must-ard

Oh Lawd who letting them killers
Tryna count my money, that ain’t none of yo business
I see yo girl lookin, nigga better get er
I’ve been pullin up the funds in the hood like it’s nothing
Pullin up and park it on the corner then hop on it
Niggas say they lookin for me but they ain’t really bout it
It ain’t hard to find us, I be always poppin

Have a bunch of round niggas that be down to ride with me
And that nigga hatin, we about to slide on him
When I started getting money, nigga switch yo side on me
