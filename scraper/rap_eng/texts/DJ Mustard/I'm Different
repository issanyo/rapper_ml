[Verse]

I’m different, yeah I’m different
I’m different, yeah I’m different
I’m different, yeah I’m different
Gold chain on a boy cost 10 thousand
Gold teeth in my mouth cost 7 thousand
Should I mention about the gold watch that your girl be rounding
Man this shit astounding
Pull up in the parking lot, watch everybody round it
So much money I can’t even count it

I’ve been selling so much they call me crack king
Sell a brick every time the cell phone ring
Young Clyde, man he the next best thing
CoD stay flexing hard in the streets

Versace outfit, 100 grand
Grippin the wheel with my left, pussy in my right hand
Ask me what I do, I just say I do it man
No MJ, got the crowd jumping like Jump man

World champion
Makavelion
Won’t stop till i’m worth 100 million
Billion
Dope sold in the trillions
Stay low-key like chameleons
Fuck bitches like Christina Milian

I am not your average rapper
No ghost write, no Casper
Stay true to myself that all that matters
Fake rappers all about the chit chatter
Hit them with the ha-hammer
Paparazzi with the gilt glamour

All that bullshit don’t matter
Get my steak served well done on a gold platter
I'm Tim Burton, like the Mad Hatter
Blunt wrap fatter
30 clip in the uzi about to let that shit splatter

Hands in the air, guns on the ground
Everybody know King Sosa run this town
Been trill, everyone know my sound
RS3 coming soon, it’s coming right around
