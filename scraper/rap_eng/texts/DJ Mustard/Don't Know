[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I came here on my own
I don't know about you
But I came here to bust and I lose

[Chorus]
Show my body
Better time to take you there
Even with my baby popping, go nowhere
I don't know about

[Verse]
Thirty on my road will be over till the evening tonight
I don't know da ba da denim da dadum day or die
Lately yeah, lately-ly, la-la-lately
Then understand, understand, understand
Get you down, understand, understand, understand

[Chorus]
Show my body
Better time to take you there
Even with my baby popping, go nowhere
I don't know about

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know about
I don't know about
I don't know about you
I don't know about

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I came here on my own
I don't know about you
But I came here to bust a move

[Chorus]
Show my body
Better time to take you there
Even with my baby popping, go nowhere
I don't know about

[Verse]
Thirty on my road will be over till the evening tonight
I don't know da ba da denim da dadum day or die
Lately yeah, lately-ly, la-la-lately
Then understand, understand, understand
Get you down, understand, understand, understand

[Chorus]
Show my body
Better time to take you there
Even with my baby popping, go nowhere
I don't know about

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know about
I don't know about
I don't know about you
I don't know about

[Bridge: Instrumental]

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know about
I don't know about
I don't know about you
I don't know about
I don't know about
I don't know about
I don't know about you
I don't know about
