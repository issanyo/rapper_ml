“Who Do You Love?” (Freestyle)
[Verse 1: NiME]
Alumni, batgang
Got your girl wearing gold chain
And these haters I just slain
Imma bring em max pain
You already know I'm the motherfucking main
Walked in the building done killed the beat
Got your girl over here, hit her 3 times, 3-peat
Bad bitches always wanna suck my dick
But it ain't nothing new
This shit going up just like Iamsu
I'm like Fetty Wap cause I got the Jimmy Choo
And I ain't fucking with you
Cause you a little ho
I don't know why I'd talk to you
Once, Twice, no never do that shit
Never do it again
Hold myself back I ain't ever gon touch that
Just fuck it, I'm in the club and I ain't never coming back
[Hook: YG]
Bitch, who you love?
Bitch, who you love?
Bitch, who you love?
Bitch, who you love?
[Verse 2: NiME]
Hey bitch, who do you love
I don't give a single fuck
Thought I said it in my rap before
You a little whore
I ain't gonna touch ya, not even a little more
Pop that ass all on the floor
If ya got a nice ass, than I might not be able to pass
Got and bring it back, bring it back
Let me see it one more time
Make it mine
Oh, as soon as I get home tonight
Imma get it right, we gon take a flight
Ha, up off the kush
Got the new shit in my pocket
I ain't even gonna ask, just pop it
Just stop it, just stop it
Don't even come on to me, don't feel me up
Cause I really don't give a fuck about your feelings
And I might more even if you screaming
I might never stop, might not pull out
Ha, you know imma kill it like whaaat
[Hook: YG]
Bitch, who you love?
Bitch, who you love?
Bitch, who you love?
Bitch, who you love?
[Verse 3: NiME]
Cash Money, this shit is funny
And you've been talking shit for a while now
And you're girl’s whiling out
And I already know she about to put out
For the whole team, you already know what I mean
I've been sipping on lean for a while now
Yeah, and I got em screaming wow
Pop it in the sky, like oh my, I'm high
Oh jeez, she pulling her panties down for me
Imma pop a 3
I'm about to OD on that OG
Pour another oz for a bad B
Oh, damn, hold me back
I'm going for a while like wham
Oh, put it in, then pull it out, out
Damn, but not gonna for a while
I've been doing this shit
I've been killing beats, fucking bitches every day of the week
Haters wanna hold me back but I don't really care
I'm going in it don't matter where
Homie what you saying
Homie, I'm the illest, I'm the trillest
And I done killed this beat like I kill your bitch in my backseat
Pull it back out and let me ask a question: Who do love bitch?
