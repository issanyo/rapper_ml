[Chorus]
Oh, same nigga, I'm still on the block with extras
And my homies ain't wake up all them visions
All that day that I was stressing
But always try to get my weight up I was patient
I was surrounded with a weapon
I know these niggas won't kill me, if they kill me
They gon' try to send a message
New money but I'm still the same nigga, I'm still on the block with extras
And my homies ain't wake up all them visions
All that day that I was stressing
But always try to get my weight up I was patient
I was surrounded with a weapon
I know these niggas won't kill me, if they kill me
They gon' try to send a message
New money but I'm still the same nigga

[Verse 1]
One time, fuck one time
Niggas tryna' build a case
And two times for my real crime is that get away
Black Bentley outside, parked next to the Range
Might take my time but no time go away
Stand out the way but they know me and I'm paid
So they know I'm walking in with the whole safe
And amigos know me, I'm the trophy on the top shelf
So I'm in the Ghost with everything that's in the cop felt
Take it to the rules, I just do it my way
When we gotta strike nigga this the LA

[Chorus]
Same nigga, I'm still on the block with extras
And my homies ain't wake up all them visions
All that day that I was stressing
But always try to get my weight up I was patient
I was surrounded with a weapon
I know these niggas won't kill me, if they kill me
They gon' try to send a message
New money, I'm the same nigga, I'm still on the block with extras
And my homies ain't wake up all them visions
All that day that I was stressing
But always try to get my weight up I was patient
I was surrounded with a weapon
I know these niggas won't kill me, if they kill me
They gon' try to send a message
New money but I'm still the same nigga

[Verse 2]
I still ride around with infant
Shift shit like I'm 40 on my LV
Big shit I be struggling putting the clip in
Where the pin ma, I swear to God I ain't gon' miss shit
I will admit it was ugly how I relive it
I woke up every day trying to fix it
All them bitches was in the way call this living
I done seen a hundred bet on trying to fix it
Treat us like Peter momma word is he don't feel shit
You gonna make me see my wardens on a field trip
They done took a lot of my niggas out there literally
I can't stop talking about to all my niggas really

[Chorus]
Same nigga, I'm still on the block with extras
And my homies ain't wake up all them visions
All that day that I was stressing
But always try to get my weight up I was patient
I was surrounded with a weapon
I know these niggas won't kill me, if they kill me
They gon' try to send a message
Same nigga, I'm still on the block with extras
And my homies ain't wake up all them visions
All that day that I was stressing
But always try to get my weight up I was patient
I was surrounded with a weapon
I know these niggas won't kill me, if they kill me
They gon' try to send a message
New money but I'm still the same nigga
I'm the same nigga
