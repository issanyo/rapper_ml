[Verse 1]
In the Bay on a Wednesday, next to my baby
Hoping that it ain't you calling
Cause I don't want to explain
Why there is an ex-man calling me at four in the morning
I could tell him you a friend but baby then again
We're doing a little more than talking
Since the day that I met you didn't want to like you
Can't believe how much I've fallen

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep it inside
I swear from the beginning that I tried
Oh, yeah, yeah
Keep to yourself
I never meant this way too much, hey, hey

[Chorus]
This little secret we've gotta keep it
We've got a lot to lose, we've got a lot to lose
And if we go there, we can't ignore that
We've got a lot to lose, we've got a lot to lose

[Post-Chorus]
But I'm willing to risk it all for you
I'm willing to risk it all for you, baby
But I'm willing to risk it all for you
I'm willing to risk it all for you, baby

[Verse 2]
It's getting so complicated, this situation
I promised him forever
And the way it's escalating I'm hesitating
Feels like it is now or never
I throw away try to fight it now I can't deny it
Got me feeling so much better
When I close my eyes all I see is me and you together

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep it inside
I swear from the beginning that I tried
Oh, yeah, yeah
Keep to yourself
I never meant this way too much, hey, hey

[Chorus]
This little secret we've gotta keep it
We've got a lot to lose, we've got a lot to lose
And if we go there, we can't ignore that
We've got a lot to lose, we've got a lot to lose

[Post-Chorus]
But I'm willing to risk it all for you
I'm willing to risk it all for you, baby
But I'm willing to risk it all for you
I'm willing to risk it all for you, baby

[Chorus]
This little secret we've gotta keep it
We've got a lot to lose, we've got a lot to lose
And if we go there, we can't ignore that
We've got a lot to lose, we've got a lot to lose

[Outro]
But I'm willing to risk it all for you
I'm willing to risk it all for you, baby
