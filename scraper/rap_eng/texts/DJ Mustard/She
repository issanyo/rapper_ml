[Chorus]
Don’t treat me like no angel
You know that I can be a lot to handle
When I'm high off of you, I offer you, I
High off of you, I offer you, I
Oh you do me like I'm your drug
You're like poison on the tip of my tongue
And I’m high off of you, I offer you, I
And I'm high off of you, I offer you, I

[Verse 1]
It’s better them days
Going and I never been feeling away
Down to try something different
Lips and legs, soft skin so feminine
Curves like me, covered in my cherry scent

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Them boys love some you
But I ain't mad cause you look good on me too
On me too
Yeah, them boys love some you
But I ain't mad cause you look good on me too
She look good to me too

[Chorus]
Don’t treat me like no angel
You know that I can be a lot to handle
When I'm high off of you, I offer you, I
High off of you, I offer you, I
Oh you do me like I'm your drug
You're like poison on the tip of my tongue
And I’m high off of you, I offer you, I
And I'm high off of you, I offer you, I

[Verse 2]
It’s better them nights
Fingers up and down my legs
Feeling like mine
Getting high off my own supply
Feels so right
Being done just high like it’s 2 AM
And we’re covered in my cherry scent

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Them boys love some you
But I ain't mad cause you look good on me too
On me too
Them boys love some you
But I ain't mad cause you look good on me too
Damn right

[Chorus]
Don’t treat me like no angel
You know that I can be a lot to handle
When I'm high off of you, I offer you, I
High off of you, I offer you, I
Oh you do me like I'm your drug
You're like poison on the tip of my tongue
And I’m high off of you, I offer you, I
And I'm high off of you, I offer you, I
