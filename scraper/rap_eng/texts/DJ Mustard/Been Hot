Mustard on the beat Hoe!

[Verse 1]
Yeah hoe with the vision
Let em all see the eye
Plottin on a meal ticket
Dodging all the bike cops
Man the streets real wicked
I'ma need some wheel pop
Plottin on a meal ticket
Put my name on Will Call
Come on Journey on the check
Come on take em real far
Tell attorneys keep a check
Cuz we gettin' mailed often
Money and respect, fly shit
Lit's off the hot shit
Get you wet up, lit up like a Molotov
Hot Sauce, stop playin'
Niggas know I been hot
Cooling right now
Hell nah, beeg hot

[Chorus]
Chillin' on mem no chilling with me
Juice where you been?
You ain't know I been I been hot
Juice where you been?
You ain't know I been I been hot
Juice where you been?
You ain't know I been I been hot

[Verse 2]
Ball with no rim I should keep the Benz top
When there's war no kids get exempt from the shots
Liquor store in my crib hundred dollar bottle different guy
I want a meal ticket, I won't sit up here and lie
I know it feel different, I won't interfere with God
Uzi fit up in the Gucci coochie, coolly, coolly high
Uzi fit up in the Gucci coochie, coolly, coolly high
Front row tickets and chicken tikka pie
Plush bowl party tip a waitress one more time
Bitch I been high, put satan out his job
God's flow, skyscrapers, sip scotch from '89
Wait I'ma do me, nigga I'ma get mine
Only thing free when you flocking fulltime
Jeopardize your freedom when you caught up for them crimes
Tryna wash my niggas, clip 'em like a clothes line
Hold time, big chilling, niggas smart, being high
Shoulder getting colder, getting older, being the blind
See this real nigga, we gon' make some real pop
Plotting on a meal ticket
Put my name in wheel comp, real time
Stop playing, niggas know I been hot
Cool it right now, hell nah, I been hot

[Chorus]
Chillin' on me no chilling with me
Juice where you been?
You ain't know I been I been hot

[Verse 3]
Platinum back to back
Yeah you know I been hot
Talking 'bout a rose
That you know I been I been kind
Playing with the keys
Yeah you know I been law
Zone in the plate
'til you know I been raw
Light-skinned freak, yeah you know I need a red thigh
If a nigga tripping he gon' see a red dye
Talkin' wet dreams you could get your bed dry
Fifth rubber quit, yeah I mean a head shot
Always going boss, so I'm about to run point
Finished chain on, hope you niggas get the point
Buying cellphones for the homies in the joint (brr)
Heard he fresh out, roll it up, that's a joint
Just got a rollie thugged out on a fee
Went to Fer-lee hold the fort with Fer-lee
Jury game lit, 'bout to pardon out the peace
Flash like alarm while you work a nigga sleep (hmm)

[Chorus]
Stop playing, niggas know I been hot
Cool it right now, hell nah, I been hot
Chillin' on me ain't no chilling with me when it's hot
Juice where you been?
You ain't know I been I been hot
Bitch I been hot
Bitch I been hot
Juice where you been?
You ain't know I been hot
Chillin' on me ain't no chilling with me when it's hot
Juice where you been?
You ain't know I been I been hot
Bitch I been hot
Bitch I been hot
