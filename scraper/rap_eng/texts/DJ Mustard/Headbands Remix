Bouncin' with the treble announcing that I'm a devil
How could you settle for ounces when pounds are down with your level?
Counting up a special on the mound with a mouthful of cellos
Mama is bugging out the drama is fuckin' loud
But whatchu' gon' do when I'm burning prada on the couch
So play my shit backwards and lets see what happens
Have you Seeing more stars than the expendables when you catch my action
Simple Similes Simplified with abstract fractions
Delusional and you know it your your hoping for a hocus pocus
This morning I'm out of focus still choking out all opponents
My motives are gonna show it blowing up on explosives
Dreams of the championship belt well hopefully I'm gonna own it
Create a buzz but don't make it up cuz thats fake as fuck
Cuz not even Edward Scissorhands made the cut
Sit back in fact intact tic tacs in this ass
Relax and laugh with dad in the back with tin man
I, tend to spit just around perfection
Me not being the answer is just so out of the question
My minds being controlled looking like elections
When I win it you gon' be the only one I don't mention
Keg stands Keg stands till I throw up eggplants
On my game off the top Rondos Headband
The Greenest of Screens seem to be deep in my dream
Puttin' 3 fingers up just so you can read in between
Lets break bread and make a toast
Titanic situation man we in the same boat
Flow goin' erratic I should check the dam base
Haven't been playing square man I gotta get in shape
I'll put you squares down if you wanna square up
Old school Will Ferrell Man I back up my rebuttles
Not a dick imma gentlemen Like my jackets in the puddle
Pack up all my troubles and head straight to the back of the shuttle
I, spit heat and melt plastic
Saw me slitting my wrists yea I'm caught red handed
Wanna play baseball? Then throw me a few Cutters
Spirit Animal Peacock Man I show my true colors
