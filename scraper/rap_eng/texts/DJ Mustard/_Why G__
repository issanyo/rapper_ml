[Intro]

GDP. Smoker's Cough Shit 20-14
Yeah

[Verse 1: GDP]
Rapper's my son/sun like planet Earth
Your girl a teen mom, should've planned that first (fuck ya'll)
Eating ass dessert
Ask your managers, I'm the man in Jers
West Orange, that's Tatooine
Walk up to a chick like "What those tattoos mean?"
I do my rap routine and count stacks
Oh she, said "I really dig your style dude. Mad unique." (GDP)
I'm a titan like Saturn's moon
Kill 'em softly with kindness and gratitude
We got that attitude
"And what you sad for?"
Nah I said "I have the blues."
I mean my lower back's killing me and rappers ain't ill as me
Heavy artillery, I speak my mind like soliloquy
My rent's 850 plus utilities, you feelin' me?
Silly G write a rhyme like Shel Silverstein
Falling Up, when I'm balling don't call me up
At the club 'til I'm crawling drunk
Or call a girl I ain't called in months
(like) "Where you calling from?"
Sip wine made of red grapes and malted plums
Assault the drums
She said "GDP your nuts." Yeah a salted one
Went to war with the whole world, fought and won
I'm getting money now and more to come
GDP

[Hook]
We the shit
(smokin') Weed and shit
No stems, no seeds, no sticks
Throw an ounce in the crowd like I don't need that shit (2x)

[Outro]
GDP
Need that shit. Believe that shit
Hash money, yeah you need that shit
