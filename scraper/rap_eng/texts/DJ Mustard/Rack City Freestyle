B.o.B
Yeah! Mm

[Verse 1]
I'm from that city
Yup that's that city
Put Decatur on my back
Got the whole map with me
This kush came from Canada
Call that immigration
Its way to loud
We gonna need proper ventilation
Two ladies perfect symmetry
And I gave them both an A+ for participation
Back it up for Bobby, pop it on my camo
If I was a flat screen, she'd be on my channel
What's up with that toe girl whats up with that camel
She want back shots so I hit her with that ammo
Yes I am an animal I will kill a poacher
Corpses all around me, all I see is vultures
That's just for the birds but I'm no ornithologist
But I got an eagles eye view of the obvious
All the arrows pointed in the right direction
Dots I just give the lines for you to connect them
No salary cap, no roof, no ceiling
I could do this in my sleep, every dream worth a million
I roll up on your poster, your CD is my coaster
Fool kill yourself take a shower with a toaster
Life like a movie, wasted like Gucci
Ain't on that white girl but she Susie
That Becky, that Bridget, that Kelly at once
Repetitive, gestures just all in a bunch
World Cup bottoms, trophies on the front
Roll up a bat I could bunt with my blunt
