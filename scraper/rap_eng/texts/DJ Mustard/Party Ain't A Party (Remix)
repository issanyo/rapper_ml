[Verse 1: Sevon Miles]
A party ain't a party if Sevon ain't in it
I like when the ladies give me business
When they twerk that booty on me
When it wobble and jiggle, it make a nigga horny
Oh my bad, too much info
Givin' out my weakness is a no-no
Always like them thick girls, not the skinny ones
But I guess I got a huge appetite for anyone

[Verse 2: Sevon Miles]
Fresh fade and brand new kicks too
Like Jamie, Ima do what it do
I'm too real to act so brand new
Time to grab a drink and act a fool
Big niggas really know how to party
Someone gimme shots of Bacardi
Ooh whee, I'm really feeling shawty
We can get drunk, go crazy in the lobby

[Pre-Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Gone 'head girl, twerk it all on me
I need it for you to work it all on me
We ain't leavin' 'til the sun come up, baby
Came to do this here all night long

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party
If I leave 'em in the club, I take it straight back to the lobby
Now shawty with the booty dancin' like she wanna do me
Turn around is she bad? Damn right, I let her do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it
If you bad, turn around girl, let me see you do it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I keep her straight like a band too
I keep it straight like 12:30
I fuck over your girl hair do
If it's curly I straighten it, if it's straightened, I leave it curly
You look good standin' next to me
There ain't enough room, we need to get a suite
And if my momma had another child
Then she would've had an extra G
Fuck that, flip that, that soul
She need a pool by the stove
She cookin' eggs and she twerkin'
You might just think I'm perverted
But she ain't got on no clothes, Hootie Hoo
Exit the club to the Trump
And her back is so fat you can see from the front
And I walk in, this bitch smellin' like joints

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
I don't wanna hold your hand
Girl tonight I got other plans
I just want to see you throw it back
Back on me and let me see if I can catch all of that

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
