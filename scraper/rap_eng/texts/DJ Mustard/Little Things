[Pre-Hook]
What if I told you I was true?
And 'bout it, 'bout it too
If I told you that I could do it better
What if I told you I was trill?
Way doper than a pill
What if I told you that you need to forget her?

[Hook]
Tell me about the little things, the little things
That I know I could do (better)
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do (better)
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do

[Verse 1]
We can keep it on the low
No need to take it slow
I'm a real one, ain't tellin' no one
I'm going down you down to go?
Where you gonna be?
And where you wanna be
You got a thing on me
We can have fun
I ain't tellin' no one
Trust me wait and see

[Bridge]
You want this?
Get up, get up
I keep it better, better
All that was with us, with us
You a fly ass nigga, nigga

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2]
Real niggas do real things
So I am with the games
We can get down
Make the haters sit down
Until it ain't gon' change
You love the things I do
And how I ride it too
I never quit now
Nigga hear this shit now
I always keep it cool

[Bridge] + [Pre-Hook] + [Hook]
