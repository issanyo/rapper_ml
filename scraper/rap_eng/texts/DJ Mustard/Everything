[Verse 1: Ella Mai]
I'd be lying if I say I never really cared how
I step out the bathroom
You notice my perfume and tell me I'm perfect
Oh, you're so deserving
Baby, you're worth it
I could tell I'm your focus
I'm all on your mind and I know it
Even when I'm off, boy, you on it
Sometimes you might talk but you show me

[Refrain: Ella Mai]
Love the way you pay attention

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
You notice everything
So I give my everything
My pain and my struggle, my friend and my lover
I put that on everything
Feels like a forever thing
Yeah, you take my everything
So we can have everything
Yeah, we gon' have everything

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Yeah, never been good at trusting
But there's somethin' 'bout you I'm in love with
I say that I'm fine but you know that I'm lyin'
You read between all the lines

[Refrain: John Legend]
Love the way you pay attention

[Chorus: Ella Mai & John Legend]
You notice everything
So I give my everything
My pain and my struggle, my friend and my lover
I put that on everything
Feels like a forever thing
Yeah, you take my everything
So we can have everything
Yeah, we gon' have everything

[Bridge: Ella Mai & John Legend]
Oh, anything I give, you take it
All I know is you've been so patient, oh, yeah
My young heart, boy, you'll never break it
And I owe it all to you, hey

[Refrain: Ella Mai]
Love the way you pay attention

[Chorus: Ella Mai & John Legend]
You notice everything
So I give my everything
My pain and my struggle, my friend and my lover
I put that on everything (Oh, I, yeah, yeah)
Feels like a forever thing
Yeah, you take my everything
So we can have everything
Yeah, we gon' have everything
We gon' have everything, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Ella Mai & John Legend]
Oh, yeah, yeah
We gon' have everything
We gon' have everything
Oh, I, I
Oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
We gon' have everything
