[Intro]
Yeah
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Bridge]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
Baby, wanna fuck with me?
On a late night, she just wanna creep
On her boyfriend, she just wanna cheat

[Verse 1]
Top down, blunt lit, cup full
Fast lane turnt, got us on and off a half night of work
Throwin' money while she on stage
They only know about our code name
Champagne, but we ain't at the club
Lil' act right, I have her actin' up
I'm in a muscle car, seven deuce cut
Keep the trap tight, never loosen up
Get shit done, call shots
Something new up off the car lot
Her top off, I'm gettin' hard top
Pull up when that car stop

[Chorus]
All you see is niggas hoppin' out the whip shinin'
Stuntin' on these niggas, without tryin'
Stuntin' on these hoes, they know I'm buyin'
It's on me, we ain't hidin'
We bring 'em out, hot cars
Champagne with hot broads
We bring 'em out, on call
Ready to go, it won't stall

[Verse 2]
Giuseppe heels, Celine bag
Look like she hopped out a King's mag
She want the real, I want the cash
She know the deal, don't get a pass
I smell like O.G, sipping codeine
But I never slow it down, still goin' O.T
Goin' hard in the game like it's post-season
Ten chains on, no reason
Club life (Life), thug life (Thug life)
We brought the hoes out, so get right (Get right)
Money fall out, the card swipe (Swipe)
Before this party, bitch, real life (A'ight)
Club life (Club life), thug life (Thug life)
We brought the hoes out, so get right (Get right)
Money fall out, the card swipe (Swipe)
We hit the party, pull up all types

[Chorus]
All you see is niggas hoppin' out the whip shinin'
Stuntin' on these niggas, without tryin'
Stuntin' on these hoes, they know I'm buyin'
It's on me, we ain't hidin'
We bring 'em out, hot cars
Champagne with hot broads
We bring 'em out, on call
Ready to go, it won't stall
We bring 'em out

[Bridge]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
Baby, wanna fuck with me?
On a late night, she just wanna creep
On her boyfriend, she just wanna cheat, a'ight
I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
Baby, wanna fuck with me?
On a late night, she just wanna creep
When that new thing pull up in the street

[Chorus]
All you see is niggas hoppin' out the whip shinin'
Stuntin' on these niggas, without tryin'
Stuntin' on these hoes, they know I'm buyin'
It's on me, we ain't hidin'
We bring 'em out, hot cars
Champagne with hot broads
We bring 'em out, on call
Ready to go, it won't stall
We bring 'em out
