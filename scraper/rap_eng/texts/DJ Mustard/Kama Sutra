Shots ain't nothing but a free throw
Walking 'round here like you the hot shit (what?)
Tryna tie me up, I'm a hostage
But I never call 911
Hands everywhere like I got 6 arms
Like Shiva
But I'm feeling on your buddah
Uh, shawty thinking about the future
Found me whenever you around me

We could call it Kama Sutra
You tryna tie me up (tryna tie me up) (tryna tie me up)

Shawty, I don't mind

Tie me up, tie me up
