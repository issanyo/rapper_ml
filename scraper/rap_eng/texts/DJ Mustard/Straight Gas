[Hook x2]
All the niggas smokin' straight gas
All the niggas sippin' straight gas
We mix the O.G. with the hash
And all my bad bitches got ass

[Verse 1: Young Lace]
Alright, I'm smokin' on that gas
Rollin' with a bad bitch
She hop up in the whip and give me all the cash quick
Got lean in my cup so my eyes low
(?) gang is the niggas that I ride four
I used to wanna shoot hoops on TV
Now all the bad hoes got my shit on repeat
I get A's in the booth, no cheat sheet
Pop a couple Mollys, got me feeling like E.T
Knock 'em down like a domino, one's come, I don't know
Never fuck with snitches, make em vamanos
My butt is hot: no cigarette
And I'm the man, you can see it in my silhouette
Roll the weed and let's smoke
Money cup game, all my nigga's sippin' on fours
Ridin' on fours, sippin' on fours
Ridin' on fours, nigga sippin' on fours

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: 504Yung]
All my bad bitches, yeah they smoke weed
I'm rollin' up an eighth of that O.G
Friday, Chris Tucker this is Smokey
Fly nigga, real nigga, these bitches know me
These niggas cheap, acting like they got it though
Yeah I'm eatin' good, yeah I'm talkin' shrimp and pasta, ho
I ain't trickin' even though I got a lotta dough
I fucked your bitch a couple times then it was time to go
Sippin' on that lean, rollin' up that bean
And a nigga so fresh, yeah they call that Mr. Clean
I got yo bitch up on my team, she workin' for that green
I put her on a track until my pockets go "Cha-ching!"
(Sippin' on that lean, rollin' up that bean)

[Verse 3: Privaledge]
All my bad bitches got ass
Purple(?) the definition of swag
And no credit, all my niggas got cash
And they keep the pump too, but they rolling on gas
Got a mouthpiece, so money our mustache
Shorty let me smash, ain't even get her it back
Took her to Mickey D's, she ate it like her last
Cuz she know the paper spendin' like Taz
Got a yellow chick with a scholarship, 'bout to pass
Say she got a son in L.A., I'm thinkin' Nash
Say she got a boyfriend that rap, I'm thinkin' "hater"
Burn got motorroll up, I'm thinkin' "RAZR"
Tryna tell these hoes I'm Kobe, I'm not a Laker
Musta got a hit, all these other niggas vapors
Get it, bag it, blunts, papers
Higher than a muphukin' Philly wave racer
YBL shit
