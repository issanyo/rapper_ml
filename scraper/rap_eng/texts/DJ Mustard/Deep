Think I'm finally back in my zone again nigga. .yeaah
[Verse 1]
Zone 3 runner Southside what I bleed
The 3 on my back I'm A.I to these streets
And I'm running it dirty got ground on my feet
I'm the son of my city they proud that it's me
I'm shining this heat bout to penetrate deep
This summer will be the hottest one yet
Better yet it'll be the hottest one ever
If I'm watching the throne still I'd buy a Rolex
Wake up in cold sweat hoping times will get better
My timing was off hope my timing ain't never
My time has been ticking I'm trying to weather
The storm is approaching I'm trying to tell em
Hail is approaching no ice on a nigga
But hope that Atlanta prepared for a drought
If time made me money then I'd make an effort
And if I made enough money I'd make it out of the 3
(Deep) 3 (deep) deep in game CP3 with the shot
Oti Ant Davis I've been on the block
But I never get blocked I'm a beast with the rock
See a wolf could be dressed like a sheep
And the pressure increase cause I just started eating a lot
I'm telling you I have been scheming and plotting
You bite down on me know my teeth will be sharp
I'ma beast (beast), and every bite back will be deep pray to god
Then I feast (feast), table of wings let a king get a spot
No more peace, my appetite going on days I'ma eat
My eyes have been open for days and I'm weak
Cause the pressure is on me no way to release
Hustle like all seven days of the week
Insomniac dream to get paid in my sleep
Create an empire I made it for me
My label CP and my name is in ink
A couple years back put my name next to king
Castro in action dictator the beat
Slide to black pesos a favor for me
You insane if you think ain't no danger with me
I go crazy on beats get a banger for me
I straitjacket straight snapping anger in me
Like look at all this that I gave em free
No charity breaking the bank on one knee
With a ring tryna marry the game
Hope the bakery open cause I want the cake no receipt
But I still wanna get to this paper this heat
Probably bake em if they think this cake shit is sweet
And I feel like Scarface with this paper
Let it make you or break you no breaks I ain't taking a seat
Got my foot on the gas and no brakes with the three
Blasting roll through the three they would think I was king
So crown me, finally made it
Mid 90s was then but I'm m beyond it I should be finally famous
But I feel like Sean, I feel no shine
I can't feel nothing the hell am I on
I feel like I should be better with time
I needed signs, cause CP is mine
And when angered we bang em a taste of this nine
No more patience no I'm, out for paper till mine
Can erase all the problems I'm facing outside
Of my circle can't no one get trust but my mom
And I can't love a woman they waiting in line
And my face to the sky am I facing a lie
I'm awake and alive, but been pacing for mine
Chaos place faith in God and then wait for the end
I'm out for the paper align an artist within
Notebook paper Picasso a pad and pen
So i can't wait to die so that I can live
So tell me that this ain't a masterpiece nigga
I've made it to mastery nigga
My girl satin soft she a masterpiece nigga
And my pack on the back of me nigga
Watch me start running it built like an athlete
Oti see cash these green faces smile back at me
Rolling the pack 350 and the pack with me
Castro turn casual meets into casualties
I turn a battle to war tryna rap with me
Passing out hit after hit that's a battery
Hope I don't blow in your faces like acne
Scope to your dome I'm too paced with this accuracy
Chaoti coyote don't miss with this acme
I'll catch a body bounce back like a trampoline
No Hermes no Fendi my belt made for champions
Niggas with addies I'm focused on rap again
