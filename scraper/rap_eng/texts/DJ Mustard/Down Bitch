[Intro]
Wha', wha', wha', wha', wha'
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah I hope you're 'bout that life

[Hook]
I need me a down bitch
A fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic
Down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic

[Verse 1]
I need me a proud bitch, a proud to be around bitch
A proud bitch, a proud to be around bitch
A proud bitch, a proud to be around bitch
This ain't every day, she knows it's a blessing bein' around this
She know I'm young and with the shits
She with it long as I come with this dick
I remind her of her oath, now she reminisces
She chocolate like Hershey, Hershey's kisses
I'm the ride or die type
I put your life before my life
Hope you ain't in it for the limelight
Hope you in it 'cause the vibe right
In that red dress so you know it's brackin'
(I ain't set-trippin', but I fuck with who I fuck with, though)
I'm a Pisces so you it's happenin'
(Nah, I ain't emotional, I fuck with who I fuck with, though)

[Hook]
I need me a down bitch
A fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic
Down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic
Can you do that for me?

[Verse 2]
I need a freak that'll pop it every week for me
I need a freak that'll pop it every week for me
I need a freak that'll pop it every week for me
Pop, pop like she gettin' a fee from me
When I come around she get a weak stomach
When I come around she get that D from me
She ain't tryna get that cheese from me
She just want me home every night 'cause she love me
So fine, on my mind all the time
On my grind, gettin' mine, sippin' mine
No time to kill time
Got the homie back, I need somebody to guard mine
Pinky promise, Cross your heart, sign your name on dotted lines
Can you hold it down? Can you hold it down?
Last situation did me foul, out of bounds
P.O.P., hold it down

[Hook]
I need me a down bitch
A fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic
Down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic

[Bridge]
If I needed you tomorrow, could you do that for me?
I'm down for the cause, could you do that for me?
Take you shoppin' at the mall, could you do that for me?
I ball, you ball, could you do that for me?
Could you do that, do that?
Could you do that, do that?
Could you do that, do that?
Pick up the phone when I call

[Hook]
I need me a down bitch
A fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic
Down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
A down bitch, a fuck up, stick around bitch
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic

[Outro]
Crown Vic, Crown Vic, Crown Vic
Ride with me even if I'm in a Crown Vic...
