[Verse]
I got a favor, I gon' write for the bay now
Hot box, 3 a.m. in LA now
Got a bitch, flew her in from the A-town
She like her ass tooted up and her face down
Face down, face down
Like Boosie man, I'm makin' all this pay now
Got a hunnid then I put in the PayPal
Got a text then she slide like a playground
In the DMs, in the emails
Call me lucky, cos' you know I got them females
Like an actor, like a singer
Wrap it up, and you know I'm gettin' greener
Got a bottle of Patron, drank a liter
Gotta bitch, always there when I need her
I don't know, maybe I should keep her
You should know I'm only rappin' for the weaker
Gave a fuck, now I'm bitin' like a beaver
Tried my luck, now I'm signed to the meaner
I can make it fire up with no features
Hot tub, with 2 on, call it leisure
I got 2, but we balance like a teeter
I got another, but I never get to see her
Got faded while smokin' on some green herb
Got 2 on, in the bed goin' ee-er
Got the bass, in the club out the speaker
Stretch it out, pull it out to a meter
Low key, keep it cool like a freezer
Other way, but you know I'm try'na please her
Five hunnid degrees, got a fever
Follow me cos' you know I'm the leader
Took it off, now she bitin' on my finger
It been a while, gettin' old like a senior
Now I know that I don't need to feed her
Now I know that she ain't with an eager
Been a month, she been actin' kinda keener
Bat it home, for the win, Derek Jeter
Other dudes, swerve out when I switch lanes
Went from ball, to the mic how I switch games
I don't really give a fuck what my bitch name
I got 2, and you know I a ain't want no mistakes
Got paid, fuck it all in the same day
Got laid, take it all in the same day
Got taste, mess it all in the same day
Got fame, take it off in the same day
We got up, head at rim like Gerald Green
I head it high, staryolmine
Said, why you stare at me

[Outro]
I love to get on
I love to get two on
Y'all hate on me now
Y'all hate on my style
I take a bitch down
I took that pic down
We all drippin' style
We all kickin' loud
We off in it now
We off in it now
Said
I'm all finished now
