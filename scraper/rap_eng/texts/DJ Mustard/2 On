[Verse 1: Aystar]
I wake up I've got 2 on
I slept with this bitch and now she thinks thats me missus on the phone
I had to tell her what you on
Thats 2 sales, see them 10 draws
Thats 2 gone
If you don't like the hustle you better move on
Or find yourself a good nigga
Can't take me out the hood, You better know this hoods glued on
Don't knock the scales they got food on
Im out night and day, yeah, get me Tom Cruise on
As soon as the phone rings i go get me shoes on
Got no time to waste, no time for mates
Im tryna get it in and all i do is spend when im with them
But can't help meself becuz in the M
Its like i always find myself sitting at the bar, fucking sipping a bottle of suen different everytime
Spend what i made the week before and then i back up on the grind

[Hook: Tinashe]
I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, bruh
Pour it on up 'till I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit, let's roll

[Verse 2: Aystar]
I got this bitch lingering around me like she wants the wood
She doesnt want the wood, but she probably wants the wood
But shes more interested in this pocket full of money i just pulled out for this bottle of honey
Jack Daniels, we got this whole squad in clubs, split into groups but we're all one, its fucked
It
If it goes off no mana got bare pokers, no cards your man are jokers you dont go hard
Them are outside for spliffs
Back to the bar
And then we're outside with lifts
Looking at these walkers like your home tight thats crisp
Grip the ting and then im outside the crib
Im tryna get in and hit that quick, fast and chip
Like she wanted me to cuddle up
How am i supposed to resist when shes got that big back
Money over bitches, no, i had to think fast

[Hook: Tinashe]

[Verse 3: SafOne]
Yo, Saf, yo yo
I woke up with a new on
Looked to left like the fuck did I get you from
Rings I got 2 on
Chains I got 2 on
Think bout my life like fam im fucking 2 on
Black airmax she had loubs on
Bitch try tell me i should put my Jimmy Choos on
But im casual
Black jeans, belt, Luis Vuitton and them s3 pedals to put my foot on
I be cruising
Ive got man thinking "how does he do this"
I got your main links choosing me, but guess what I dont pursue shit cah im good like that
Take the pot of the stove we dont cook like that
Every yutes got a shank, you'll get juked just like that
Ive got the 38 degrees you can cook like that
So rudeboy, dont look like that
Because im 2 on
And everyone im with is focused
What the fuck are you on
I bring back tees with st, i get my hats from youpon
She saw my ona mad one hat i bought the blue one
Nobody breathing when i saywhat you on
