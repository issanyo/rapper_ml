If you kiss me on my neck then I'll probably stay in longer
If you do it how I like it then the feeling will get stronger
Cause you do it well, girl enjoy yourself
Just don't hurt yourself
Fuck me til' I say stop
Fuck me til' I say stop
Fuck me til' I say stop
Fuck me til' I say stop
We gon' fuck until this bottle is gone
Fuck me til' I say stop
Fuck me til' I say stop
Fuck me til' I say stop
We gon' fuck until this song is over
And your bra is off
And your panties hit the floor
Leave your heels on
What you waiting on

[Verse 1: YG]
Kiss me girl I'm a kiss you back
And I'll be CarMax if your lips is chapped
Yeah I'll be anything you want me to
Yeah I'll do anything you want me to
Fuck me girl til' I Say stop
And I ain't sayin stop til' I hear the neighbours knock
Yeah I'm a F-R-E-A-K
I'll fuck you all night won't stop til' it's day
Yeah, fuck tellin' me to wait
The dick good plus the head great
But I can put you to bed way before eight
I'll make you cum all early

Stop actin' icky girl give me some pussy
And I'll give you a hickey while I'm hittin' that pussy
You know I gotta smoke, girl I hate bein' sober
And if you kiss me on my neck girl I'll probably stay longer

[Verse 2: YG]
Let's do it how I like it girl all night long
Let's do it how I like it girl with no comdom on
I ain't dumb girl and I can't sing
But I think I'm sprung girl like T-Pain
So tell me watchu gon' do about it
You live in your nigga house
You should move up out it
Cause he a no life
He ain't worth your time
I'm tryna make you mine
Cause you oh so fine
I'm tryna get you in my bed so I can beat it up
Got a appetite for pussy so I'mma eat it up
Drop your draws, drop your bra
Leave you heels on but take errthing else off
I ain't in a rush girl, enjoy yourself
I'm just tryna fuck you girl, nobody else
You know I gotta smoke, girl I hate bein' sober
And if you kiss me on my neck I'll probably stay longer
