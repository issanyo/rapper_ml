[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She my fasho chick
Still trying to get some more chicks
Might end up with no chick
If my bitch find out but
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
Ya ya

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I fell in love with my side bitch
And its funny cause she wasn't even my bitch
Fly shit had her open like a locksmith
She was nominated for the best to ever ride dick
She like girl [?] a side bitch
And you won't ever catch me with a thot bitch
Cali-forn-i-a I'm up at Toxic
Smoking on bomb shit, looking for a dime bitch
Cause I ain't with the nonsense
I don't spend no money, ain't got no time spent
On these ho ass bitches that ain't got shit
Cause that'll be the same ho to run their mouth quick
And if my girl find out she might hurt us
That pussy ain't worth getting murdered
I hope you keep it on the low, I might just give you dick and dough
I hope that she don't ever know

[Hook]
She my fasho chick
Still trying to get some more chicks
Might end up with no chick
If my bitch find out but
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
Ya ya

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Just had sex with a blasian
She ain't my bitch but she think it
She be cooking and cleaning
She got her nails done and her feet did
She think I don't know nothing
Her ex figure got a new phone number
Put her up in some new shit
With her best friend
Then I burn rubber on a bitch like Joe
Why a bitch gon' tell me no
She ain't got no panties on
She came ready to go

[Hook]
She my fasho chick
Still trying to get some more chicks
Might end up with no chick
If my bitch find out but
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
What she don't know won't hurt her
Ya ya

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm grinding on you, you grinding on me I'm all in your shit
I'm feeling like money, you feeling that drank, you feeling this dick
