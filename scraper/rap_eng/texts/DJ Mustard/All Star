[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign and (DJ Mustard)]
Dolla Sign
Fuego-go-go-go-go… go
(I go by the name of DJ Mustard like this let's go!)

[Verse 1: Tydolla$ign]
I got all this money, about to leave with all these bitches
Tell that bitch she can have all these hundreds
But she can't have something for nothin'
Make that thing bounce, turn me all the way up
Pop one of these and wash it down
How you like me now?
Rosé bottoms up in VIP smoking up a cloud

[Bridge]
Tell me what the fuck you gonna do
With a young nigga like me
Nigga with so much loot
White tee in a Bentley
I know what your bitch gonna do
Soon as she see me
She gon' drop it low, she gon' pick it up
She gon' back it up right here on me

[Hook]
I'mma knock it down like I'm hittin' free throws
And I'm getting money like I'm playing for the pros
She used to the rookies but I'm an all star, all star
Throwing hundreds out the sports car, sports car
All out, ball out, all out, ball out, all out, ball out, woah...
All out, ball out, all out, ball out, all out, ball out, it's Pushaz iNc baby

[Verse 2: Tydolla$ign]
I drunk all this rosé about to get started on this Clicquot
Tell that bitch I got more pesos than José
Ven aquí chupa mí pito, (fire) rápido
Turn a young nigga up
Baby don't trip it's just drugs
Now girl lets bump, I ain't talking bout the dance
I'm talking bout getting fucked up

[Bridge]
Tell me what the fuck you gonna do (what you gon' do?)
With a young nigga like me
Nigga with so much loot
YT in a Bentley
I know what your bitch gonna do
Soon as she see me
She gon' drop it low, she gon' pick it up
She goon' back it up right here on me, Baby...

[Hook]
I'mma knock it down like I'm hittin' free throws
And I'm getting money like I'm playing for the pros
She used to the rookies but I'm an all star, all star
Throwing hundreds out the sports car, sports car
All out, ball out, all out, ball out, all out, ball out, whoa...
All out, ball out, all out, ball out, all out, ball out, it's Pushaz iNc baby

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
Money, money, money, money
Bitches know the boy fly, I cross my T's and dots my I's
I am that ride I am that high, 28's on it I am that fly
I am that guy, say what you feel
One more chance, shit I always been real
Pooty tang bitch put it all in your grill
Silent T baby kiss the old me
All out, BrickSquad, Pushaz Ink capo
Fruit snack inside, outside apple
BrickSquad Snapple all out asshole
DDP the pussy, bitch who wanna wrestle?
I'm just getting money give a fuck about your inner source
Been fuckin' Beats, name a song I ain't in the chorus (intercourse)
Take it out your mouth & put it all in your friends
No homo me and Ty, we all in!

[Hook 2x]
I'mma knock it down like I'm hittin' free throws
And I'm getting money like I'm playing for the pros
She used to the rookies but I'm an all star, all star
Throwing hundreds out the sports car, sports car
All out, ball out, all out, ball out, all out, ball out, (whoa)
All out, ball out, all out, ball out, all out ball out, it's Pushaz iNc baby!
