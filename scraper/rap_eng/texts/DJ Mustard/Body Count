[Verse 1: RJ]
I'm usually a weapon, when I use (?) like a Wesson
Out the Uber, take the U, that's the user interception
Do me in the restroom, give me room without the dresser
I'm a shooter on a section, like her shoes on a finesser
How many licks do it take is the question
Girl, you like bitches, you can move in my direction
Hundreds on hundreds, all my hoes homosexual
Got the Uzi, but I'm known for all the zippers, like Giuseppe's
I hit you with sexy, you hit, cause i'm next
When we fucked, I just left you asleep
Yeah, bitch, I told you don't press me
Don't call me, don't text me
Didn't I say this dick ain't for free?
Just let me breathe

[Hook: RJ]
I shoot the club up again, you just caught up in the crossfire
I kill the pussy, when I'm finished, you probably got an outline
Your body on me
That's your body for me
Your body on me
That's your body for me
And I'ma add it to my body count

[Verse 2: Skeme]
I do this with no effort, and my shooters with the extras
Flooded presidential, tell me time is of the essence
Same hoes from before that gave me no's, give me yes's
Now my standards way too higher, and most of them bitches got nexted
But if she send a better promise, I can't wait to catch her on my section
Get her home and leave that pussy on a stretcher
She talkin' too much, sayin' how her nigga used to stress her
That's when I'ma to the left her, cause I got no time for lectures
Set it off, started wrong be the phrase
If you want this upgrade, girl, you gots to behave
If you really with this shit, ride this dick like a wave
Game kickin' all (?), 'till the day I see the grave

[Hook: RJ]
I shoot the club up again, you just caught up in the crossfire
I kill the pussy, when I'm finished, you probably got an outline
Your body on me
That's your body for me
Your body on me
That's your body for me
And I'ma add it to my body count

[Verse 3: RJ]
Okay, the car said twirp, the bra said chirp
The draws went for serp, cause the charm said erk
Pull my arm out the dirt, diamonds in my shirt
Pocket full of merch, RIP, no church
Okay, girl, I stack trims to the rims, no Tetris
Keep it hella boss, samurai couldn't (?)
Body after body, ask a body like a reference
I probably shoot the messenger, cash out no register
Cars with no shoes
I known to hop out and do what I do
Should got my baby over here, where I can't be your stairway
RJ Mr. LA, you choose
She's coming too

[Hook: RJ]
I shoot the club up again, you just caught up in the crossfire
I kill the pussy, when I'm finished, you probably got an outline
Your body on me
That's your body for me
Your body on me
That's your body for me
And I'ma add it to my body count
