Started off, selling work
Bubble gang fast cash yeah I made it work
First lick, nigga had chips
Fifty grand three homies yeah we all split
Car lot let's spend this cash nigga
Now the whole hood thirsty tryna past nigga
Better calm down that's how you get cracked nigga
Thirsty for the cash now you talking 'bout send you pictures

Ever since a lil nigga I ain't been the same
Cashed out fast need everything

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
Now we was often hoping, out the regal and poppin
Extraâ€™d out with this crippin, them young niggas off Slauson
Living for my reputation wasn't making no profit
Had to come to my senses and get all about my business
Niggas was mad at the chain that's apart of the game
But you ain't shit when you broke so fuck what niggas was saying
Left the work in the spot with residue on the blade
Starting running up in shit and life was never the same
Niggas hoping them counters going hard in the paint
Plotting on flockin a house and hope we come out with the safe
Got rollie on his neck I put a gun in his face
Don't even ask where he from just do my dougie and skate
Ah, look, and for a minute we was coming with it
Old schools playing Gucci through ya residentials
New jags diamond boogers was your presidentials
'til all my niggas got double digits, damn
But shout out to my bro's though
I'm robbing rap now but I got my own flow
I'm paying taxes on em so it's grown dough
'til shittin on whoever's in is what I'm known fo
Two thousand twenty you'll be home so I got a little minute to get everything in it
Life, gotta live it to the limit
But I ain't gotta tell you cause we did it
