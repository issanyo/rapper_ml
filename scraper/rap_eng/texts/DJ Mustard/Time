[Intro]
She just want time
She just wants time
She just wants

[Chorus]
I been working late late nights, now my main bitch wanna fly
'Cause she just wants time, she just wants time
I been gone for a lil minute, tryna get back where we finished
She just wants time, she just wants time
She just wants, time

[Verse]
She just want my time
I been getting what's mine
I ain't forget about all them times
But in the midst of things, I had to let you go to get my own thing
But in the midst of things, I had to let you go to do my own thing
I know you're at home, you ain't got me, and you're so alone
I know it ain't fair, a young nigga blowing and you ain't here
And all of this time, you kept me down, you kept it G with it
I know it's a shame a nigga didn't change
I told you I'd be right back and did

[Chorus]
I been working late late nights, now my main bitch wanna fly
'Cause she just wants time, she just wants time
I been gone for a lil minute, tryna get back where we finished
She just wants time, she just wants time
She just wants my, time

[Outro]
I know it's a shame a nigga didn't change
I told you I'd be right back and did
