[JG Trigga]
It’s JG Trigga
Listen up, girl

[Verse 3: JG Trigga]
When I'm down, she's always by my side
And when I’m played hard and bad, she won’t let em slide
One is down to party all the time
She got the laugh and the joy all the time
One I can tell all my fuckin secrets
That’s my other half, gon be rockin Air Raid sneakers
Nicki and Drake, Young Money speakin’
We got the whole crew talkin bout us, speakin
Taking silly selfies, playing Playstation
Walk through Hoboken, take 7th to the station
One to chill in summer, and to go on vacations
Shit may get weird but that’s how God makes us
Dat my #1 bitch in here! (Whoop, whoop!)
We too damn fly, people looked scared (Whoop, whoop!)
Now you telling me to go point her out? (Whoop, whoop!)
That’s my main one right over there! (Whoop, whoop!)
Love you baby girl!

[Verse 4: Mila J]
Who's always there when I call (Whoop!)
And even when I fall
(Yeah if your main in here right now, I wanna see you point her out)
Who been with me since day one
Won't turn on me for anyone
(Yeah if your main in here right now, I wanna see you point her out)

[Hook]
