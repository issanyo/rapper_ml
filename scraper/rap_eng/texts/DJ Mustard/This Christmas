[Intro]
Hol' up
Mustard on the beat
Hol' up

[Verse]
I've been thinking 'bout some jingle bells
Snow falling on the window sill
Santa baby you can pull [?] (Yeah)
Just make sure you got that thing to give (Yeah)
I've been a little naughty but I wanna make it for the bad times
Baking cookies, know you wanna taste it don't you be shy

[Pre-Chorus]
Feelin' good when I'm full of cheer
I've been waiting for them 12 reindeer
I'm sitting, chilling under the mistletoe
Lit the tree I know you feel the glow
Glow, glow, glow, glow

[Chorus]
Santa baby stay a little don't you rush we got time
I wanna take a selfie with you, show the world you're all mine
(All mine yeah)
Cause this Christmas, will be the first time of the [?] love with you
But hold up Santa baby I got trust issues
I know you gon' be dashing through the snow down these chimneys
I know you got plenty
I just wanna make sure you feel me
Cause this Christmas, will be the, greatest time of your life with me
I ain't asking for the diamond, the rings
I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself, why did you just leave?
Santa baby would you make a little turn for me

[Bridge]
Left turn, [?], surprise what's inside?
Sweet pine, chestnut mine
Good times [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
Full of cheer
I've been waiting for your 12 reindeer
I'm sitting, chilling under the mistletoe
Lit the tree I know you feel the glow
Glow, glow, glow, glow

[Chorus]
Santa baby stay a little don't you rush we got time
I wanna take a selfie with you, show the world you're all mine
(All mine yeah)
Cause this Christmas, will be the first time of the [?] love with you
But hold up Santa baby I got trust issues
I know you gon' be dashing through the snow down these chimneys
I know you got plenty
I just wanna make sure you feel me
Cause this Christmas, will be the, greatest time of your life with me
I ain't asking for the diamond, the rings
I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself, why did you just leave?
Santa baby would you make a little turn for me

[Bridge 2]
Thirsty this moment, it's colder today
That cocoa's waiting come get you a taste
On the second day of Christmas, my baby gave to me, two dubs like I think it's you and me
First day of Christmas my baby's gave to me, real love and grateful memories

[Chorus]
Cause this Christmas, will be the, greatest time of your life with me
I ain't asking for the diamond, the rings
I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself, why did you just leave?
Santa baby would you make a little turn for me

[Outro]
Santa baby would you make a little turn for me
Ring, ring, ring
Santa baby would you make a little turn for me
Ring, ring, ring
Santa baby would you make a little turn for me
