[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
In the trap, got that hot pot whippin' on the sofa
Jackie Tan bricks out the dough, look like Coke Cola
Sellin' dogfood on the low just like Chipotle
China white got the trap just like Magnolia
Foreigns out of Quattro, picture me rollin'
Pointers in my ear, I got ebola
Thuggin' with my vato, Longway Chapo
I go Adolf with the fuckin' Draco
Gas bag touchin' Amico
My shirt Givenchy, look Jumanji
My closet tailor-made from London
Well shit look crocodile hunter
Pick a pocket, baby, blue hundreds
I got them boxes of fruit comin'
No Telly, it's Patek Philippe
The rose gold burr two tone, Longway, bitch

[Chorus: Quavo]
Money all in the closet (Cash)
We don't believe in a bank account (Yeah)
Sittin' down, watchin' ball player contract
And we got the same amount (Whoa)
