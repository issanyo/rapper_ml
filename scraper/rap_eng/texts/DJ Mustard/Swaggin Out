Verse: I got no conscious so I show pain, and it got my life messed up in this game
So how its going be when I see the peek of the mountain, shall I fall or shall i rise round like a fountain
Wasn't looking good so I had to swag it out, my nigga milli hit me up no I'm busting out/
Deuce give u dat raw blade brutality, swag wit the bars no wack niggas stopping me/
Played around got grime had to get them off me chlorine, know i got swag when I hit the scene/
Swagging and I'm flexing yeah I got dat combination, that's likes me seeing the stars no combination/
Man they got no logic why can't they see my flexecution, I ain't Bin Laden i ain't going see no execution/
Ask me how I bin I been swagging, but i heard u been chilling nigga i was laden/
I see no freaking reaper can't watch my spirit go, I'm back and I'm ready wit the flow/

Hook: I'm swagging yeah I'm swagging yeah I'm swagging yeah I'm swagging
