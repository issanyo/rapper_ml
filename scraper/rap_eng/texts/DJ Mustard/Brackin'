[Intro]
Larry makin' all the hits
Mustard on that beat, hoe

[Verse 1]
All this damn bark about whose who
I don't hear that gun talk when I shoot through
10 to 4, two 5's or a deuce deuce
Shoot a hunnid, bet a hunnid, I hit points too
Nah, you don't want to come out, niggas scared of that
You know that feelin' when you nut in that hoe bare back
I'm puttin' fear in niggas hearts, I'm a bear attack
OMMIO, we been brackin', I can bang that
Niggas 'bout to mend ends on us
Politickin' with Korean on us
Breakin' bitches that done been on us
We don't need the Fed's notice
We tight grilled on a lot of shit
I'm in the field with your bottom bitch
Playing spot a trick, takin' shots of Hen'
I done seen it all with this fire stick
Niggas long ranged shooters, StojakoviÄ‡
Quick to cut a hoe off like I cropped a bitch
Got old spot feel took a pass to [?] to club, all the time to tell me it's a hassle
I with the same niggas that they hit the trap with me
Only thing changed, bitches got badder
