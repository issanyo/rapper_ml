[Intro: DJ Mustard]
Mustard on the beat hoe!

[Verse: Von Tae']
Rack city bitch, rack rack city
Ya nigga in my bed throwin' that ass like a frisbee
He said he ain't never had dick that make em dizzy
So don’t be surprise if that nigga act sadity
I took em over seas, sippin on Mimosa’s
Sat that ass on me like glass on a coaster
Nigga gave me neck, I showed em no respect
I fucked em, turned em over, then I nutted on his chest (ooh kill em)
I was killin’ it, nigga called me Terio
Fuckin' on a million, we was louder than the stereo
Hysterical then the nigga talking marital
I'm just tryna fuck nigga, I ain't tryna marry you


[Chorus: Von Tae']
Rack city bitch, rack, rack, city bitch [x3]
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and some fifties bitch

Bitch, this is rack rack city bitch
Rack rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
