[Verse 1]
Kush getting rolled, love you through highs & the lows
Back on the road, got me gassed while I head for my goals
Man from the go, she been a cutie & ting
Came in a thong, tonight I'll be pulling some strings
& all season, she never looking to switch
So tell Four seasons, they better book us a suite
Doper than coke or whatever you looking to bring
Black never crack, & that's word to my Nubian Queen
& I know that you seen too much
Your ex, he from Texas, he chopped & left you screwed up
You just want some TLC, you no longer do scrubs
Got you like your mama got you, something like a group hug
Cupid got the hook up, we could both shoot up
Cuz love is one a hell of a drug, shouts to the new plug
A real nigga is one who believes in true love
The type to hold they homies down & still keep they boo up
Wanted you before I blew up
Yo baby daddy was a bum, & shawty that's true stuff
Told him you got pregnant, disappeared & had you stood up
It's bad he ain't pull out, it's worse cuz he ain't pull up
Lotta fakes out here, learn to maneuver
He don't treat you like the one, then you gotta put the two up
Straight deuces on a boy
Go make your money, no excuses for no boy

[Chorus]
Feelings
Got me in my feelings
Going off like Drizzy
I might just do the
Might just do the Shiggy
In my feelings
Got me in my feelings
Going off like Drizzy
I might just do the
Might just do the Shiggy
Do you love me? (Boo'd Up)
Are you riding? (Pull up)
Never leave from beside me?(Boo'd Up)
Cause I want ya & I need ya
Do you love me? (Boo'd Up)
Are you riding? (Pull up)
Never leave from beside me (Boo'd Up)
Cause I want ya & I need ya too
