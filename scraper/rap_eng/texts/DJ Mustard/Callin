[Verse 1: Reem Riches]
Bull, look
Uh the money callin' for a young nigga
I got money like a drug dealer
Yeah, you gettin' money I could fuck with you
I said if you gettin' money I could fuck with you
I'm ridin' through L.A with my top back
Trynna put my city on the map
You bitch keep callin' I don't ever call her back
Check my missed calls lil nigga that's a fact
My nigga all up, my niggas all pay
Goin' hard all the time we don't have no off-days
Pardon my manners but I don't fuck with you niggas
Y'all be all on my swagger
[?] y'all can have it, the money callin' while I'm all in traffic
I said [?] y'all can have it, the money callin' while I'm all in traffic, aye


[Hook: TeeCee4800]
The money keep callin', the money callin'
You know I gotta answer for it
Girl keep callin', your girl keep callin'
But I don't ever answer for it
No, no I don't ever answer for it
No, no I don't ever answer for it
No, no I don't ever answer for it
Cause the money way more important


[Verse 2: TeeCee4800]
I don't know why she keep callin'
It was a one night thing darling
Please don't the wrong impression
Just a young nigga out here straight flexin'
Came through in a bird, sellin' birds
Bag a nigga bitch with one word
Yeah the money keep callin'
Bankroll nigga tell your wifey quit stalkin'
Ridin' round the city in that Beamer
If we ain't got cash, we got Master or Visa
MTM we don't catch [?]
Dice game, I better hit that fever, aye
We the In-N-Out boys
Yeah you know what that mean
We the cash out boys
Wait, hold on!


[Hook: TeeCee4800]
The money keep callin', the money callin'
You know I gotta answer for it
Girl keep callin', your girl keep callin'
But I don't ever answer for it
No, no I don't ever answer for it
No, no I don't ever answer for it
No, no I don't ever answer for it
Cause the money way more important
