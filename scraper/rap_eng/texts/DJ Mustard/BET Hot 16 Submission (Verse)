Something bout rappers thinking it’s a wrap they started rapping…
Imma start bringing the morgue in, I ain’t talking captain
Although I’ll still linger over the barrel though
The pen’s mightier than the sword, and i’m slicing cantelopes
I’m a bar flippa
Gymnastically causing tragedies
They aim to be outstanding
But none of it's standing out to me
What are they saying?
They playing, I think it’s all talk
I’m illa than ebola in AIDS patients wit smallpox
A little touch of the SARS, measles and then malaria
Bury ya just for thinking, i’ll eva get outta character
Tried listening to these cats, but they’re just boring me…
Knowing that they historically, can’t even afford to breathe
In the same room as Pac, Pun, or Biggie, Luda, Busta or Missy
They need to get on their grizzy, started from the bottom…
But not saying I’m drizzy
Im just slaying bodies till they decaying from using semis
One shot away from taking over a cypher
While waving off all the snipers
And bringing in Miley cyrus
Expecting all artists to shatter after the wrecking ball
At my beck and call
Aim at necks until I check em all
Until they fall, the rifle’ll get it’s welvyn on…
Pluck em and yell ‘Got em’
Then flex whenever the weapons drawn
Red eye focus, I guess i’ll name it Decepticon
Everybody screaming levels
Til they got their levels wrong
Take Eminem’s insanity
Pluto’s level of gravity
World War II’s casualties
Combine em, get the average me
This is just a warm up...
Lyrically burning calories...
I guess its time to step in the ring
And yell challenge me
