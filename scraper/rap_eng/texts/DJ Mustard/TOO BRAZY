[Chorus: YG]
Two young niggas going too brazy
Two bad bitches, I be double datin'
Two mad niggas sayin', fuck you, pay me
Two houses, I be going too brazy
Two young niggas in the coupe, racin'
Two young niggas on the block, pacin'
Two young niggas, po-po chasin'
Two young niggas beefin', Freddy vs Jason

[Verse 1: YG]
Two cups 'cause I'm gettin' too fucked up
I'm strapped up, I'm too much for you poo butts
Do too much, then your ass gettin' touched
Two babies with butt, tryna fuck on us
Two pistols everytime I slide
Too much red, I might start a fire
Two bankrolls and both of 'em mine
I love baby too much and she ain't even mine
Two young niggas on the same mission
Tryna leave a fuckboy's brains missin'
Try to take my chain, then you gon' get hit
Can't hit you? I'ma hit your bitch
By myself, I be too focused
By myself, I get too loaded
Dick disappeared in that pussy, hocus pocus
Dick too bomb and your bitch know it

[Chorus: YG]
Two young niggas going too brazy
Two bad bitches, I be double datin'
Two mad niggas sayin', fuck you, pay me
Two houses, I be going too brazy
Two young niggas in the coupe, racin'
Two young niggas on the block, pacin'
Two young niggas, po-po chasin'
Two young niggas beefin', Freddy vs Jason

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
Two bands for the drac', give me two of those
Twenty for a P, 'less you buying two or more
Stomped down, ease 'em over twenty toes
Two Ms in the bank, fuck the twenty roll
Judge gave me two years for my nigga pole
Two outta town tucks, never be at home
Two grams in the wood, we be breathin' dope
Two niggas bangin' bloods and we keep the 4
Two tone, .40, pop it, gotta keep it on me
Facetime the jeweller twice, just to see the Rollie
Nigga, two bad thotties, give 'em [?]
Damn near drowned in my lap, got 'em scuba divin'
Two hunnid somethin' on the dashboard
Two forms of ID for the passport
Double homicide since they asked for it
And that 2 Chainz shit'll get you taxed, boy

[Chorus: YG]
Two young niggas going too brazy
Two bad bitches, I be double datin'
Two mad niggas sayin', fuck you, pay me
Two houses, I be going too brazy
Two young niggas in the coupe, racin'
Two young niggas on the block, pacin'
Two young niggas, po-po chasin'
Two young niggas beefin', Freddy vs Jason

[Verse 3: YG & Mozzy]
Two Maybachs and they back to back (uh)
Two .40 Glocks with big dicks, they go rat-ta-tat
Shit too brazy, gotta adapt to my habitat
I bought it at a store, told, 'We ain't paying nun' of that'
Ayy, we been waitin' two days, where the package at?
Middle fingers to the law when they paddy wag
Two hunnid for some here for my scallywags
200K from another M, nigga, tally that
Tally that, 400K in a fanny pack
Spent 20 out of that and get your baby daddy whacked (oh ohh)
Sneak diss at me, you should see your favourite rapper get attacked
YG, what'd you do for fun? Hang out where the scandalous at
Dry snitchin' ain't permitted, we don't side with rats
We ain't never fell off, fuck you mean, we bringin' Cali' back?
Draci in a bali bag, get a nigga body bagged
We ain't tryna snatch a chain and run, we need all of that

[Chorus: YG]
Two young niggas going too brazy
Two bad bitches, I be double datin'
Two mad niggas sayin', fuck you, pay me
Two houses, I be going too brazy
Two young niggas in the coupe, racin'
Two young niggas on the block, pacin'
Two young niggas, po-po chasin'
Two young niggas beefin', Freddy vs Jason

[Outro]
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ayy
Ay-ay-ay-ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, Stay Dangerous, nigga
