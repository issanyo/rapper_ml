Verse:
Your feelings
Girl, I won’t play wit ‘em
(No)
But you dealin’ wit a lame nigga
(Fa sho’)
If you love him
You could stay wit him
But he don’t eat the pussy up, like I do
And the sex ain’t the same neither

You know I ain’t the one to talk down
On a nigga
I can’t believe you really let your guard down
For this nigga
I been tryina chill but it’s hard
(Ooh yeah)
You gone make me pull up and pull his card

Hook:
Cause I’m tryina be Boo’d Up wit you
(Boo’d Up, Boo’d Up)
So if it’s war then I’ma suit up for you
(Yeah yeah) Cause all I got is this good love for you
It’s Summer ’18 and I choose up on you
Your nigga bout to lose up
On you

Ooh
Girl I know you ain’t happy
You really just Cappin
But you need something new
To get you high like I do
So baby let me roll up
Uh yeah

Verse 2:
I know I’m probably lookin’ desperate baby, so what
(So what, so what)
I text you purple hearts
I know you need a soldier
(Aw yeah, aw yeah)

I know if he go thru your phone
He gone go up
(He mad)
But I do what I want
So I ain’t gonna slow up

Hook:
Cause I’m tryina be Boo’d Up wit you
(Boo’d Up, Boo’d Up)
So if it’s war then I’ma suit up for you
(Yeah yeah) Cause all I got is this good love for you
It’s Summer ’18 and I choose up on you
Your nigga bout to lose up
On you

2x

Ooh
Girl I know you ain’t happy
You really just Cappin
But you need something new
To get you high like I do
So baby let me roll up
Aw yeah

Outro:
Oh..
