[Verse 1]
T-Many
Drive young bitches crazy
You know the motto
Fuck you, boy pay me
Balmain'ing
Belt cost 12 80
Kick a bitch out
If she acting Fugazzy
Had a bitch, went to Poly
Call her my beach baby
I fuck her every night
She be, she be calling it dating
You kiss her face and you basic
She always faking
I give her real orgasms
Ovulations

They calling amazing
Baseline, drop, guncock back Troy Ai-Ai-
Ay, nigga don't be stealing my swag
It's to late ain't it

All Gucci though
Knock em down like a domino
Bringing it into your front door
Domeshot, Porch floor
To many bitches

Names Jane Doe
Man you niggas Rainbow
All My Niggas Rambo

[Pre-Chorus]
Shh, Chillin Tropic

Get you folded for some dollars
Don't get out of pocket

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm In This thang, thang, thang, thang
But bitch I'm in This thang, thang, thang, thang

[Verse 2]
Fingers in the air
Niggas gonna start banging
Throwing money to the birds
Put em in their cages
Niggas wild
Can't tame me with a gas chamber
Deep dish rims
Lips like Topanga
On my two busy for you shit
Call me later
If I was a bum I'd give you none
Like the church ladies
It's aggravating
Niggas, fucking up my aviaton
Flyer than most
Trying not to boast
But niggas debating
Uh, and the broads gonna follow
My nigga Wale told me pop my collar
Chain so gotti
They thought we was Gotti brothers
Two twin bitches
My nigga fucked the other

[Pre-Chorus]
Shh, Chillin Tropic
Niggas give me pound

Get you folded for some dollars
Don't get out of pocket
