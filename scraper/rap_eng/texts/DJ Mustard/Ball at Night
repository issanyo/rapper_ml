[Intro: Bure & YG]
It's ya boy Bure!
And my nigga
Mustard on the beat ho

[Verse 1: Bure]
Yeah
I wake up and it's time to ball
I ain't got no worries on my mind at all
Just copped some new gear at the mall
Feels like Mike Jackson, the way I'm off the wall
I arrive at school and it's game time
We suited up cause it's freakin' prime time
Playing the point guard, this is my time
But the other team ain't worth our time
We focused, we just feel so ready
We always win, we go slow and steady
And chances of losing getting thready
We don' end the war like Teddy
We the best in the 'deen, don't worry
Dave stay making threes like Curry
Field says time your time, don't be in a hurry
We on point, our vision ain't never blurry

[Hook]
Yeah, we gon ball at night
Practice makes perfect, we gon do it 'till we get it right
We be flying high just like a kite
Everybody get ready for the fight night!
Yeah, we gon ball at night
Practice makes perfect, we gon do it 'till we get it right
We be flying high just like a kite
Everybody get ready for the fight night!

[Verse 2]
We turning up the heat
Everybody on the edge of their seats
Because it's Mustard on the beat
Whoooo
We the real elite, nobody can defeat, nobody can beat
Whoooo
David dunking like 'Bron
Aidan making buckets like Harden
You say our team ain't the best, man I really beg your pardon!
Harlaw's losing, such a pity
I'm just playin' but I'm feeling so witty
Imma make a bucket, do the wop like Fetty
Just checked the scoreboard, we up by fifty
This ain't just a game, don't get it twisted
Hawlaw's win, looking like they missed it
The klaxon rang, that's game over
Feeling so good, brush the dirt off my shoulder

[Hook]
Yeah, we gon ball at night
Practice makes perfect, we gon do it 'till we get it right
We be flying high just like a kite
Everybody get ready for the fight night!
Yeah, we gon ball at night
Practice makes perfect, we gon do it 'till we get it right
We be flying high just like a kite
Everybody get ready for the fight night!

[Refrain]
Cole stealing shit like no tomorrow
Ty's form classic, flicka-da-wrist just follow
Through, the game ends as we bid the other team adieu
Get ready for the new-new
We don' came through, like I always say, we don' stayed true
And just like the Clan Tang-Wu, man we don feel like the OG crew

[Hook]
Yeah, we gon ball at night
Practice makes perfect, we gon do it 'till we get it right
We be flying high just like a kite
Everybody get ready for the fight night!\
Yeah, we gon ball at night
Practice makes perfect, we gon do it 'till we get it right
We be flying high just like a kite
Everybody get ready for the fight night!
