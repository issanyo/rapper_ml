[Verse 1]
Look in the mirror
Who do I see? Who do I wanna be today?
If you came for a show, which role should I take?
Fading to grey, so do we make a big mistake?
True colors'll show, baby, just put me on display

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I have no secrets
'Cause thereâ€™s a version of me that I dunno how to hide
When you're making me glow with your fingers against my thighs (Glow)

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah
(Nothing on my body, but this mood ring, this mood ring)

[Bridge]
I'm in the palm of your hand
My temperature is at your command by my demand
And now I'm falling for you
I turn to golden from blue
And you do too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah
