[Verse 1]
Mama said never love a nigga more than he love me
See my daddy said the same thing, and he an OG
Your love is all I can think of
I don’t want it, boy I need it now
My heart is telling me I’m crazy
'Cause I shouldn’t be sticking around

[Prehook]
Everybody know in the town
I’m the one that’s holding you down
You the one that’s hoeing around
Everybody know, everybody know in the town
But I’m the one that’s still here now
Still here
Still loving my baby like he ain’t did nothin'
But that’s still my baby, yeah he still the one

[Hook]
Oh baby, I’m the definition of a rider
That’s my baby
I ain’t gon’ leave ‘cause I ain’t a switch sider
No I ain’t, no I won’t
You make me want to leave you every day, but I don’t
I’m still riding
'Cause I ain’t a switch sider
No, no I ain’t a switch sider
No, no I ain’t a switch sider

[Verse 2]
Mama said never love a nigga more than he love me
See my daddy said the same thing, and he an OG
We on a love rollercoaster
But I can’t help myself, I need it now, now
Does this have something to do with her?
Is she the reason that you’re not around?

[Prehook]
Everybody know in the town
I’m the one that’s holding you down
You the one that’s hoeing around
Everybody know, everybody know in the town
But I’m the one that’s still here now
Still here
Still loving my baby like he ain’t did nothin'
But that’s still my baby, yeah he still the one

[Hook]
Oh baby, I’m the definition of a rider
That’s my baby
I ain’t gon’ leave ‘cause I ain’t a switch sider
No I ain’t, no I won’t
You make me want to leave you every day, but I don’t
I’m still riding
'Cause I ain’t a switch sider
No, no I ain’t a switch sider
No, no I ain’t a switch sider

[Bridge]
Mama said never love a nigga more than he love me
See my daddy said the same thing, and he an OG

[Hook]
Oh baby, I’m the definition of a rider
That’s my baby
I ain’t gon’ leave ‘cause I ain’t a switch sider
No I ain’t, no I won’t
You make me want to leave you every day, but I don’t
I’m still riding
'Cause I ain’t a switch sider
No, no I ain’t a switch sider
No, no I ain’t a switch sider

[Outro]
It's like, every time I try and confess my love for you
It's just... Hello?
See this is what I'm talking about
You never ever listen to what I'm saying
I know you went out last night
And I know there's someone else
I might as well just...
My friends warned me about you, I mean
I should've listened
