[Verse 1]
We not from the same planet, but you wanna give mine a try
We ain't grow up the same way, but we both end up alright
One hand pulling me closer, the other pushing me away
Won't you make up your mind now, cause we don't got time to play

[Pre-Chorus]
I'mma take my time girl, we can do it how you like
Slow walk in the moonlight, so tonight might be your night
Won't be no pressure from me, wanna make you part of my team
Don't let the world have to fall down before you call me

[Chorus]
I'll be around if you ever needing me
I'll be around if you ever get lonely
And if you ever find yourself in the need of rescue
All you gotta do is send a text to
I'mma be around, I'mma be around
If you ever get lonely, if you get lonely

[Verse 2]
We don't talk the same language, but you always on my mind
I'm the one you wanna hang with, but I can't get none of your time
You wanna talk then I'm open, but I won't beg you to stay
Cause if you're done then I'm with it, so let's not play no games, no

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta worry, I just wanna be the one to hold you
And let you know who you can call when you can't sleep
I'mma be around, pick you up when you're feeling down
When you see my name in the sky I'm not far away
So you can always call me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If you get lonely
If you ever get lonely
Then I'ma be, be around
