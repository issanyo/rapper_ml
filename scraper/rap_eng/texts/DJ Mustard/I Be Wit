[Intro]
There's two things that every nigga out there should come equip with

[Verse 1]
You're salty ass giving mortons eye blood
Pressure, fresher, yessir
Got me hard as Titans saying S words
Thats your B word, Super C perb
Keep her away from us, freak before we seek her
Options knocking, they not popping
Bottles, now it's baby looking for adoption
Target, quick to, close your lid off
Get off two-hundred yards away, shoot your ear off
You had to be reminded, huh
She like, Choice, time waits for no man
Why should I? Umm
Cause you not time, bitch, duh!
Yeah, you fine, but you got me mixed up with an another one
Flipped it hardball, had her pictured in under arm
Fuck your vision until you see where I'm coming from
Vroom-vroom because a hundred something
Boom-boom, I'm bout to come in something
Never trust a tongue throught a bitter heart
Get it far, tissue scar, hit with hella tips fuck a mini bar
My diamond have her clock hoisted in the crowd
Just to let these hoes know Choice is in the crowd, huh!

[Hook]
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the stuff
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit and all the stuff, all the shit
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the stuff, all the shit
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the shit
I be with, I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with, I be with all the shit and all the stuff

[Verse 2]
My top down, nigga, kill me if you gonna
Mona Scott got a budget for the drama
Moma here's still legal, it ain't standing on no corner
No one stealing from the trenches
Think they ever want the problem to be honest
Niggas don't be the message, they bring it
Yeah, getting out, yeah that means Winfield Jackson
Was going for the second ring
I stabbed a ski mask for the scheming
Car hundred going over Clevelands on that Martin
Like Teret is got King grievance
Step your play up and get defense
Get the faint up with the bleachers
Step your pay up for the features
Nigga mind your shit, or I'll remind your shit
Mind don't mind doing sense sentiment with an iPhone 6
Some niggas done died for this shit
More niggas done killed for this shit
Ran the state, I never fainted I was built for this shit
Finna too real for this shit
But for that cheque I'ma get empty clip 'till you hit
You gon' drown if you slip
You don't get I be with

[Hook]
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the stuff
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit and all the stuff, all the shit
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the stuff, all the shit
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the shit
I be with, I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with, I be with all the shit and all the stuff

I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the stuff
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit and all the stuff, all the shit
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the stuff, all the shit
I be with all the shit and all the stuff
I be with all the shit, all the shit
