[Verse 1]
Baby
I been thinkin' 'bout you all the time
Lately
I been wantin' you back in my life
I know, I know
Been a while since we felt the vibe
But I know I know, I know I know
I know what you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Met you in the lobby, I was just arriving, you was checking out
Felt you staring at me and immediately I had no doubt
Missed your flight, we spent the week together but it's all over now
'Cause we tried to keep it going when we got home but our heads were in the clouds

[Chorus]
So I'm waiting for the sun to come up
Take me for a ride in your Beamer
Let's just roll the top down, ain't gon' stop
'Til the stars are above
Wish that you would talk to me
'Cause I don't really know just what to think
Got me now, runnin' round, looking for your love
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
Kinda makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
It's raining
Thought we'd never drift but I can't lie
We faded
Grass ain't always greener on the other side
I know, I know
I know that the cold world passes by
But I know I know, I know I know
I know what you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Met you in the lobby, I was just arriving, you was checking out
Felt you staring at me and immediately I had no doubt
Missed your flight, we spent the week together but it's all over now
'Cause we tried to keep it going when we got home but our heads were in the clouds

[Chorus]
So I'm waiting for the sun to come up
Take me for a ride in your Beamer
Let's just roll the top down, ain't gon' stop
'Til the stars are above
Wish that you would talk to me
'Cause I don't really know just what to think
Got me now, runnin' round, looking for your love
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
It kinda makes me wonder

[Chorus]
So I'm waiting for the sun to come up
Take me for a ride in your Beamer
Let's just roll the top down, ain't gon' stop
'Til the stars are above
Wish that you would talk to me
'Cause I don't really know just what to think
Got me now, runnin' round, looking for your love
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
Kinda makes me wonder

[Outro]
I feel like I'm driving myself crazy continuously wondering about you
I have to remember that I come first
Ultimately this is my world and
I'm ready
