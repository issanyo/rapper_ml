[Verse 1]
Boy, you want a nasty girl
Tell you all my secrets
She make your wife happy, oh
So her number get deleted, yeah
Fuck one more thing, making my body roll
Boy, you see me, ain't fiending
You wanna put your hands on my body
You wanna do what I like

[Pre-Chorus]
Your ex girl, your ex girl, she weak
Yeah, that bitch ain't got nothing on me
I'm getting money, I'm spending money, yeah
I'm tryna tell you, boy
You know she can't put it down like me
I got that sex you say you need
To keep you thinking 'bout my freaking (thinking 'bout my freaking)

[Chorus]
'Cause there ain't nothing better than my shit
Ain't had nothing better than my shit, no
Ain't had nothing better than my shit, no (had nothing better)
Ain't had nothing better

[Verse 2]
I'm glad bitches hating
They baby daddies know my name
Niggas thinking they more ratchet than they girls
Huh, weak niggas, you insane
I don't chase no nigga, I'm about mine
I can't take you from her world, don't need to lie
You ain't got that kind of money for me
You can't handle me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Your ex girl, your ex girl, she weak
Yeah, that bitch ain't got nothing on me
I'm getting money, I'm spending money, yeah
I'm tryna tell you, boy
You know she can't put it down like me
I got that sex you say you need
To keep you thinking 'bout my freaking (thinking 'bout my freaking)

[Chorus]
'Cause there ain't nothing better than my shit
Ain't had nothing better than my shit, no
Ain't had nothing better than my shit, no (had nothing better)
Ain't had nothing better

[Outro]
You know she can't put it down like me
I got that sex you say you need
To keep you thinking 'bout that freaky
'Cause there ain't nothing better than my shit, oh
Ain't had nothing better than my shit, oh
You ain't had nothing better than my shit, oh
Ain't had nothing better than my shit, oh
