I been grinding to get it since I was low
Been married to the game like I love her and I D.O
I be so focused on Lil’ shit like Hollygrove
Ducati flows- God MC that’s omni po
I’m the nigga that mashed and came out
Looking he was a star in this bitch
Dead ass- I had to hit them with a coroner kiss
Like warring is this
The morgue is for the frauds the rich
It’s more than just clips
More magazines than stores in this bitch
I’m talking progress they backwards
I’m thinking boatses and mansions
I’m thinking stocks and expansion
They talking pokers and hammers
But damnit
I got the kind of squad to make a nigga vanish
Holding down Baltimore while I get this work here on campus

Work it out Cal, you can work it out
Show them everything they say they heard about
Work it out Cal, you can work it out
Show them everything they say they heard about

Now I’m everything
They said I’d never be
Success won’t change Cal
I’m forever me
How Ironic
Border line don’t believe
The one you never saw coming
The one you came to see
Pay to see
This is crazy B
God is taking me
Even on X-Box live you shouldn’t play with me
You get Ate up, straight up
Get your weight up
Like what’s a pay cut
When your salary self made up

For the cheese like nachos
Pull up on a nigga pronto
Ridin' for the guapo, it's just me and my vato
If money ain't the convo, tell me what the hell you call for
Catch me in my condo, DoubleUp 'til my heart stops and my eyes close
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos

In this crazy ass world
More beef than a taco
How I’m supposed to get through
If ain’t me and my vatos?
Me and my niggas  x2
DoubleUp that’s Cal plus 3 of my niggas
Big brother shit I want cheese for my niggas
Suffered through this college shit
Degree is for my niggas
So when I get this food
I’ma feed all my niggas
Loyalty until I die and leave all my niggas
People asking me
Why do you rap
What’s the chances of making it
You in college do that
But at the end of day
God’s plan is God’s plan
When play you spades
Don’t look at God’s hand

For the cheese like nachos
Pull up on a nigga pronto
Ridin' for the guapo, it's just me and my vato
If money ain't the convo, tell me what the hell you call for
Catch me in my condo, DoubleUp 'til my heart stops and my eyes close
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
