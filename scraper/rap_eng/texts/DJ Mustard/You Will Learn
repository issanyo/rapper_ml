[Selena Gomez]

Verse 1:
What happened?
I feel that confusion, and you know
This is my fault, baby, you can go
Cause I'm not what you are looking for

Pre chorus:
And tonight (oh oh)
You can do on your way and follow your own lines (oh oh)
I'm not crazy enough to make you feel unable (oh)
Everything I do is just because I know, I - I know…

Chorus:
I know that you will learn
That I can't see your body burn
I know that you will learn
That I'm not the only one
Who wants you good but I can
Make you know baby

[Macklemore]

Verse 2:
I don't know what I feel
Is it like I need you, but my body put you out, baby (uh)
Maybe I should heard my heart
Stop thinking and just make it start
