[Intro: Jessie J]
Jessie J, Jhené, Rixton, woo!
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Verse 1: Jessie J]
Back at 'em, way past 'em, yeah
Stay hungry, don't fade away
Hands up, I need you awake
Awake, awake
Know what it is, how I play
Don't like it? Oh well, okay
I'm blessed, I don't hear the hate
The hate

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
Cause when I come in, I spot 'em
From the roof to the bottom
And I keep knockin' 'em dead
Take 'em down, down, down
Let's get it poppin', I'm a serious problem
I think it's time to turn it, turn it up right now

[Chorus: Jessie J]
We about to change the pace, we're gonna need some space
Get out the way, so sorry to interrupt
I got somethin' to say, attention please
Mic check, I need you to turn me up
We about to change the pace, we're gonna need some space
Get out the way, so sorry to interrupt
I got somethin' to say, attention please
Mic check, I need you to turn me up
Louder, louder, louder, I need you to turn me up
I want it all, I need you to give it up
Pardon the invasion, sorry to interrupt

[Verse 2: Rixton]
I’m runnin' in, I’m comin', not afraid
Not tomorrow, need that today
Gotta find another rule to break, all day, always
To everybody who slept, crept, and left on me
Slowed me down and came around and stepped on me
My back is just what you get from me
You don’t know me, move from me

[Pre-Chorus: Rixton]
Cause when I come in, I spot 'em
From the roof to the bottom
And I keep knockin' 'em dead
Take 'em down, down, down
Let's get it poppin', I'm a serious problem
I think it's time to turn it, turn it up right now

[Chorus: Jessie J]
We about to change the pace, we're gonna need some space
Get out the way, so sorry to interrupt
I got somethin' to say, attention please
Mic check, I need you to turn me up
We about to change the pace, we're gonna need some space
Get out the way, so sorry to interrupt
I got somethin' to say, attention please
Mic check, I need you to turn me up
Louder, louder, louder, I need you to turn me up
I want it all, I need you to give it up
Pardon the invasion, sorry to interrupt

[Bridge: Jessie J]
Interrupt, interrupt, turn it up, up, up
Interrupt, interrupt, turn it up, up, up

[Verse 3: Jhené Aiko]
Took a flight up, every day I’m birds-eye viewin'
From your mouth to the street, watch me blow through and do it
Stop for a minute, jealous talk, I get off when I hear it
I do it like I do ‘cause the game ain’t finished

[Chorus: Jessie J]
We about to change the pace, we're gonna need some space
Get out the way, so sorry to interrupt
I got somethin' to say, attention please
Mic check, I need you to turn me up
We about to change the pace, we're gonna need some space
Get out the way, so sorry to interrupt
I got somethin' to say, attention please
Mic check, I need you to turn me up
Louder, louder, louder, I need you to turn me up
I want it all, I need you to give it up
Pardon the invasion, sorry to interrupt
