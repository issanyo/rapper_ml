[Intro: TeeFlii]

If you got a drink, or if you got some weed
Drink up, smoke up

[Bridge 1: TeeFlii]

Have a drink, fill your cup
Tonight it's turnt up
Cause Annie long gone up

[Hook: TeeFlii]

Shut it down, take you down, put it down
See I'mma shut it down, take you down, put it down
Yeah, I'mma shut it down, take you down, put it down
Shut it down, take you down, put it down

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]

Annie, we slow dancing on this floor
Bottles of Patron, girl you got me on
Girl don't play around, pop these Molly's with me
You all on this dick tryna fuck with me

[Bridge 2]
I, look that pussy eye-to-eye
We gon' fuck all night
Stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready, just

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

I see you Annie, yeah
You've been patiently waiting, yeah
I really got the fire, fire and desire
They cock blocking, let them hate then
You can't be on my team if you ain't trying to get it in
