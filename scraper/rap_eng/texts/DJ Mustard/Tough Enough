[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah
I am the kind of girl that run the world
I got this visa on the street that bring them to their knees
If you want me, you better keep up
'Cause I need a man that brings the heat, the man that brings me the bang bang
I need the gangsta dough that turn it up someone who's tough enough
Tough enough for my love, yeah
Tough enough for my love, yeah

[Hook]
I need a bad bad boy who can satisfy me
'Cause I'm a bad bad girl and I know what I need
I need some mad mad world when you're riding with me
Are you a bad bad boy? Are you tough enough for my love?
Oh oh, tough enough for my love?
Oh ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
My man he knows the way down there, makes me shake the legs
The more he loves, the days to follow me
I'm on the day ???
My man he picks me up, he drinks me up
He rolls me up, puf-puf
My man he brokes me up, he fills my cup
Because he's tough enough
Tough enough for my love, uhm
Tough enough for my love, yeah

[Hook]
I need a bad bad boy who can satisfy me
'Cause I'm a bad bad girl and I know what I need
I need some mad mad world when you're riding with me
Are you a bad bad boy? Are you tough enough for my love?
Oh oh, tough enough for my love?
Oh-ooh ooh
