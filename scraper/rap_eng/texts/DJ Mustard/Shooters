[Verse 1: Game]
I grew up in Bompton down the street from Leuders
Grew up with a Mac I ain't talking no computers
Swerving down Rosecrans watch how I maneuver
Hanging out the Cutlass red rag and the Ruger
My mama house in Santana, g-mom's in Hoovers
Fuck my mama best friend, yeah Tiara was a cougar
I was the first nigga out the hood with a Mueller
Had to move off of Cedar couldn't fit it in the cooler
Now I'm on Rodeo top down with the jeweler
Shittin' on niggas in the Wraith like manure
Even if I fuck your bitch I'm acting like i never knew her
Nigga want a problem he gonna end up in a sewer

[Hook: Game]
My nigga, D-Shake, Bad Ass they're my shooters

My nigga Tay-Dog and Taco they're my shooters
They're my shooters (on the set)
They're my shooters (on the set)
They're my shooters (on the set)
They're my shooters (on the set)
They're my shooters (on the set)
They're my shooters (on the set)
They're my shooters (on the set)

[Verse 2: RJ]
Hold up, on God in heaven
Light this bitch up my nigga time is essence
Aye at 40 with 30 that's curry for 40 you scary
I ain´t never did heroin
But I'm a shooter even if a nigga want you dead or
Want you crossing over
I'm not to be mislead, will be your boss an all
Then we valet park and pour us a fifth of dose
With the doors up in Barcelona
Yap Yap
All that lil snitchin gon get a cop shot
Melt down a pistol and hit a chop shop
Orale ese they can´t ignore me I´m L.A I go to war with that Quete
Ok, i just won the case you a loser
Still ain´t wit the scene Just to see if it was school
For all these new bangers sending shots off computers
Clear as water in Aruba
Squeezing llamas off of scooters
Get em looter

[Verse 3: Skeme]
All gas no brakes
Flat lines for the fakes
Family first no friends ain't no love for the snakes
One call and Obone, Tiny Munchie are too much They all gon get brackin
And leave your block chopped and screwed up
All my niggas ruthless and he in this we refusing
Dookie keep it knocking rolling
Change my name to Duke Nukem
My whole side shooters like we left handed hoopers
Ball out in red jerseys like we playing for the Hoosiers
I hop out the coupe wit Woopas
Top off and show the hooters all the generals wit me
No bitch nigga, just salute us
If any nigga diss he must not want to see his future
Known to trip and never slip we even got it in the Uber
Chuck talk to em

[Verse 4: Joe Moses]
I tell em get off on Slauson
That hat be Boston
Ask any nigga in LA man you better not cross me
We hop out no walkin
No mask no handgun
They claim they hate the set
Well nigga command one
Only Vs no yees my shooters Flag and Baby Woop
Blood in Blood out HPB´s and all fruits
My IFG's my P-Stones they all shoot
It's war time nigga on RF
We all troops
Caught my first and one, foul play on Western
Just bought a Ferrari do it look like I´m stressing
It´s still 54th and I´m still out here nesting
It´s still 54th and I´m still out here nesting
