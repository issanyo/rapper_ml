[Verse 1: Yamine]
Oh, Yo boy Yamine love Rihanna like a Blue Berry Bee
Yo dat girl so special she so interested in me
Yeah I need that girl she my world
Jamaican skin tone
Had me in a bone
So shiver with a what
Long hair I wouldn’t dare
She the best so Rihanna come up and tell the rest
Yo….yo…..Yo boy Yamine go Rihanna

(Chorus: Rihanna)
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
Feel a little more and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But, baby, who, you needed me


(Verse 2: Yamine)
Uh, Yamine had this beat up high
Everybody already knows when I pass by
If you messing with a real
Then it's not worth the lie
And if you are trying to peel
I'll make yo ass cry
Lil Ri, needed me
Now I'm home
And she seeing me
Everything I own
Ain't make believe
Just look at my crib with all of my money
While Rihanna come back on the hook tasting like honey
Chick so bad, she have a nigga hoppin like a bunny
It ain't Easter Sunday, but today is sunny
I also like the night time, but you make my day funny
If a nigga run up on me I'll shoot his ass in a hurry
If Drake tryna come, then I'll welcome him with the money

(Rihanna)
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But, baby, who, you needed me

(Yamine)
Yo Rihanna yeah you got
And I know I pop it
Go and rock it
Yeah….yeah...yeah…..ooooh. (yeah bro)
