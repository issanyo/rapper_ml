6 Double O Dapper Don get dollars
Baltimore resider I’ve been known to spit fire
Anytime you see me?
Call me Young Sire
Call me out my name
Get carried like Mariah

Boss shit
Corporate law shit
Feelin’ my bars?
Superstar super raw spit
Bought my car
Drove off
Out the auction
So fast out the 6
2 Pedestrians got carsick
Hold up, hold my phone
Top dog out the east- did it on my own
Shout outs to Reddz
My nigga, my nigga
If it’s time in put in work
Pop the trunk and I’m witcha

Drinks up E&J in my cup
Send the shooters if say I’ma bluff
Flash flood make it rain in the club
Don’t bug me I got raid in the trunk
DoubleUp

Baltimore raised
Ghana where I’m from
Watch what you say to me
Condom on your tongue
Play it safe or ate away on these 808’s
Jump shots’ll get you points
These hands’ll make you fade away
