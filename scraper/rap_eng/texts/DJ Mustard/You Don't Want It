[Intro]
Uh, I don't think you wanna get rich
You don't really want it
You ain't really tryin' to get rich, no
You don't really want it, uh

[Verse 1]
Now you don't want that late night gas with no brake light crash
In the daylight I see it in your face
You don't want that blood sweat tears
Then a bunk bed peers
No they upset, they level with your game
No you can't take a loss like that
Off that
Wasn't really thought that y'all could ross like that
Don't know how I feel they can't afford like that
Off that
Right back
Had to get it up to low
We took
Gotta tell me do it for the love
Gotta do it Jimmy Choo
Got this balling in my blood
Think I came this far to shoot dubs?

[Hook]
I don't think you're tryin' to get rich
You don't want it
You ain't really tryin' to get rich
You don't want it
I don't think you wan-wan-wanna get rich

[Verse 2]
Now you ain't got what it take to do it like me
Get you head up in the game or you can sight see
Waiting for a hand out, this ain't the right league
Spend so much time I hear balling it's my wifey
Please when I live I breath, I sleep, my dreams they lavish
Went from check to check to check to balance
I press I bet you flop, you all theatric
I'm mostly savage gambling take advantage
I'm here to ball why you call off work
When a top jump back what I call a vert
For I hit my contacts check my call log verse
See if I could make a play to get it all off first
Woo, little animal lose
A separation off of this I drip a pair on the shoe
Or I could put you on some skates breaking ankles and loose
Saying this is what they pay me to do

[Hook]
I don't think you're tryin' to get rich
You don't want it
You ain't really tryin' to get rich
You don't want it

[Outro]
I don't think you wan-wan-wanna get rich
I don't think you wan-wan-wanna get rich
