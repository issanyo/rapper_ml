[Hook]
Bitch I'm a grind for my motherfucking scrilla
Most likely I'm a die with my fingers on the scrilla
My scrilla
Haha

[Verse 1]
Uh
All about the currency, smoking on that purple weed
My bitch doing tricks on my dick like a circus freak
Pop, pop that pussy like I put in the microwave
Make you feel some type of way
I don't feel nothing, still puffing on that real muffin
My girl from Houston so that's trill fucking
Every time we kick it, I peel something
Walking up with A's on
I get high so much that all my fucking days long
Life short, ask the people on the life support
You'll get no reply
Ask em who popping, they gon' say, "Stoney Wright"
Yeah I get it popping like pills going down your throat, don't choke
I don't vote, just barely turned 18 this August
Bitch I go the hardest, flow is so flawless
So lawless cause I don't listen to officers
The game just changed, heartbeat ain't' on the monitors
Adida Gang the highest, you can see it in binoculars
See me on my Twitter but I'll never be a follower
Told her I'm a bust a daughter in you daughter's mouth but only if she swallow her
If you ain't get that then then you probably fuck your palm
Chill out bitch you just need to suck a bong
Hit the smoke then hit a hoe
If it's that codeine then I sip it low
All I see is a bunch of ass kissers without no mistletoe
I flip y'all off with my middle toe
Hah

[Verse 2]
Pour it, sip it, lick it, dip it, flick it
Is you fucking kitten? Smelling fishy and you actin little pissy
Well piss off cause all your music getting shitted on
On top of Texas what I sit upon
I'm a king, Adida leafs on my crown tho
My bitch's ass like a secret, keep it down low
They say Stoney "You must be out yo, motherfucking cranium"
When I see the enemy, there's nothing saving 'em
I ain't a killer but don't make me have to take that route
Cause it's full speed ahead and I ain't never slowing down
Blowing out killer smoke, gun smoke
Punch holes in the wall when I'm pissed off
Hip-Hop, will never be the same
Before long all these kids gon scream Adida Gang
Flacko already knew that but he got locked up
Free my fucking brother and everybody getting caught up
This that South Texas beach flow
Where everybody like to party and never do they drink slow
And Ty and Marcus still puffin that weed smoke
Those the realest motherfuckers here at Camden
If it ain't' drugs or money, I don't understand it
Time Alone 3 gon be the best tape that you heard this year
Coming from a young kid working on a strong career
So hashtag that T-A-3
And I'm a do my thing while I rep AG
Ah
Ahh

[Hook (2x)]
Bitch I'm a grind for my motherfucking scrilla
Most likely I'm a die with my fingers on the scrilla
My scrilla (5x)
My scrilla, my scillas, my scilla, (5x)
My motherfucking scrilla
Lil' bitch
