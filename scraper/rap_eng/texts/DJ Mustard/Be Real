[Hook: Ben Wylie]
You ain't got no will
You ain't got no bottle
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real
You ain't got no cash
You ain't got no dollars
You stay with that drama
Let's just be real
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real

[Verse 1: LTtheMonk]
Yo I tell em to B-Real
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just Kill A Man
The Cypress Hill in a man
Says I better be ready
For When The Shit Goes Down
I tell my DJ quick
The Monk Is The Name
Play the ad-libs
So the game
Knows to Mange Tout
Eat it up
Follow suit but
Bite the style you will lose your tooth
Yeah, I been a Nigga With Attitude
Straight Outta London
LT incumbent
In my office they coming
Politic discussing
How the underDoggystyle be fucking
With their minds and their hearts and the Gin & Juice
I pour it up and see the faces screw
All Eyez On Me
So Skandalouz
Who knew alcoholism was for the cameras?
I raise a toast to the fans of us
And another to my brothers
There's a band of us
Can't handle us
To LA we go
With a verse for the West Coast

[Hook: Ben Wylie]
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real
Let's just be honest
We all know the deal
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real

[Verse 2: Ben Wylie]
Straight up
You know I can
No time to mess around
Just do my thing
Tryna make me be someone I can't
What's up with you?
I told you who I am
I hate this
You were my friend for ages
We went through different stages
Live life on separate pages
Girl why break this?
Threw it away over one stupid thing
Now my life's a mess
Please don't do it again
Cause you know how I feel
About this whole game
So let's stop playing
Faking ain't the way
Now I know I'm so ashamed
Knew you were a liar
When you called me other names
All I want to do is show you how I feel
Slow it down a minute
Show you how to be real

[Bridge]
You can call anyone you want
Ima kill 'em all later on
Cause we the only ones that stunt now
Let's just be real
Be honest
Be real
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real

[Hook: Ben Wylie]
You ain't got no will
You ain't got no bottle
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real
You ain't got no cash
You ain't got no dollars
You stay with that drama
Let's just be real
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real
Let's just be honest
Let's just be real
