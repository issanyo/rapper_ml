[Verse 1]
Ooh, tell me what I could do
This ain't what it's supposed to be
I don't wanna drop it now
But you ain't up under me
And tell me what I could say
To make it feel right with you
'Cause you got a lot of love
And I got some things to do, and I'm...
I'm just a woman in love
Never thought it could feel like this
All I need is a late night call
Got me running right back, back, back, back
I don't wanna get over you
I just wanna, offer it now

[Pre-Chorus]
All day (All day)
All night (And all night)
You got some nerve playin' with fire
You don't (You don't), realize (No)

[Chorus]
That I'm on my way for your satisfaction (Faction), 'faction
Caught in bad habits, call me an addict
But I need your satisfaction (Ooh-ooh), 'faction
You got that kinda somethin', fuck, it's good
It make me run my mouth
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, run my mouth
Oh-hoo, run my mouth

[Verse 2]
I tried to let you go
I came because I'm too caught up, yeah
It's because you keep calling me
All up all over me
I get stuck inside these walls that you built (Ohh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
All day (All day)
All night (And all night)
You got some nerve playin' with fire
You don't (You don't), realize (You don't realize)

[Chorus]
That I'm on my way for your satisfaction (Faction), 'faction
Caught in bad habits, call me an addict
But I need your satisfaction (Ooh-ooh), 'faction
You got that kinda somethin', fuck, it's good
It make me run my mouth
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, run my mouth
Ooh, run my mouth
Ooh-hoo
You got that kinda somethin', fuck, it's good
It make me run my mouth
