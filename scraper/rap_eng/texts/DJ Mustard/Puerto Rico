[Hook]
I just met a bad bitch right on the gram
Every time we talk she be fighting with her man
Everything lit I got ass on demand
Everything lit I got cash on demand
'Bout to smoke 4, 5, 6, 7 grams
Right in Puerto Rico, feeling like the man
Let's have a good time it's all part of the plan
Everything lit baby, every week we taking trips baby

[Verse 1]
Got damn it I just came up, all gold like King Tut
All my shit blinged up, never got my chain tucked
Shorty ass so fat I had to step my game up
I just seen 4 bad bitches wit the same butt
When I'm in San Juan I be smoking that bomb tree
Roll me up a nice blunt 'n smoke under the palm tree
They call me a gringo not Espa√±ol but I know the lingo
Skinny nigga Mandingo haters could chupa mi pingo
I'm flashy, bad bitches can't walk past me
Ima athlete, run this rap game like a track meet
Since I'm the King they be bowing down when they come around me
I'm met the plug he told me to hit em when I'm in Cali
Shout out to Yolianis, shout out to Blair Imani
She a Black American Muslim, Puerto Rican mami
It's lit baby
I just met a baddie on Twitter
We out in Puerto Rico you can get her come on

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning to a blunt rolled
Hit it like a bongo
Figure out what I'm gon' do, think about where I'm gon' go
Probably hit La Isla Bar & Grill at the Telly
Back in the states we eat peanut butter & jelly
I might hit that zip line, might hop on a rowboat
Gotta stay low though, paparazzi got Go Pros
If I gotta hit a lick I hit it on my go phone
So hot in Puerto Rico I need a snow cone
Feeling so good a nigga ain't tryna go home
So I might drink a coco loso and go loco
On the road touring, out in Puerto Rico I'm a tourist
Look like the island was organized by a florist
It's gorgeous, I ain't even from here
Came for the weekend might stay here for 1 year
The feeling kinda priceless this what I call unfair
Feeling like a don, King on vacay in San Juan

[Verse 3]
And I got my lady on the trip too, hell yeah she thick too
Hope she understand I'm the man and I'm lit too
Baby we on vacay wit' baddies just pick two
And hold a nigga down like the watch on my wrist do
Boricuas make it hard for me to not lust
These girls like toasters the way they pop up
Shit we might get chauffeured 'cause we on
But everything honestly so close a nigga might walk
Matter fact when we get back we cuttin' lights off
And Ima buss ya ass like a bubble in the park
We makin' like it's art, eyes closed in the dark
I'm feelin' like the man I'm bout to do the John Wall
Like Troop 41 when I was in Carolina on
We like Ice Cube & Kevin Hart girl you my ride along
She just wanna lay out in the sun 'n catch a tan
I'm in Puerto Rico feeling like the man!
