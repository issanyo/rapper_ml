[Verse 1]
I been knowing you for long enough
Damn I need you right now
You can take your time, don't have to rush
This might take us a while, (yeah)
I left all the doors unlocked and you said you're on your way
When you get here don't just say a word, got no time to play

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you think that you know me
But you ain't even see my dark side
This is for you only
So baby do me right, do me right

[Chorus]
We can go all, the time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
Where we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide

[Post-Chorus]
Baby it's all your if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (tonight)
Said it's all yours if you want me,all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (Let's collide)

[Verse 2]
Is this love or is it lust?
You make it hard to tell
Are you someone i can trust?
Since you know me so well
I'll do whatever you like
Got me under your spell
But promise what we do tonight
That you won't kiss and tell

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you think that you know me
But you ain't even see my dark side
This is for you only
So baby do me right, do me right

[Chorus]
We can go all, the time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
Where we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide

[Post-Chorus]
Baby it's all your if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (tonight)
Said it's all yours if you want me,all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (Let's collide)

[Bridge]
I know that this is love when we touch boy
You got my heart
And can't nobody make me feel like you do, boy like you do
Cause baby we can go

[Chorus]
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
Where we don't turn off those lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide

[Post-Chorus]
Baby it's all your if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (tonight)
Said it's all yours if you want me,all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (Let's collide)
Said it's all yours if you want me,all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (Let's collide)
Said it's all yours if you want me,all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (Let's collide)
