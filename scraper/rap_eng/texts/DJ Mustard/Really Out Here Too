[Verse 1]
All the heat all summer and it got me a lil darker
And the street light shoutout made it harder to get caught up
Ain't no more goin' on outside
It's really war goin' on outside
Imma do my own way
Your way no way
Caught up with a throw away
Fuckin wit a hoe yeah
Diamonds in my rolly
Parties in the doorway
Plugged in with Jose
Married to my old ways
How could I divorce it?
Still waters run deep in the streets like a faucet
Everybody gotta eat
We don't get to many choices
Felonies we forced with
Trappin' out apartments gotta pay the mortgage
I've been hearin voices
Beggin me to get you door kicked
You know I grew up as a poor kid
I need a portion


[Hook]
They tell me I'm burnt cause I never hold back
(They tell me I'm burnt cause I never hold back)
Got me way to turnt tryna do the whole dance
Cause we be really out here
Whoo-whoo
Cause we be really out here
Whoo-whoo


[Verse 2]
They told me love they neighbor
But if I never see inside of your house
Don't be mad when a nigga bringing something out
A whole lotta crime and capitol from off the couch
Really think you makin' millions off that house
Few pistols in the bag, we don't know how to act
Think they stopped makin' guns when they made your strap
Nigga dropped outta school
Cause he learned how to rap
Got robbed in the stu cause he record where he trap
All my young killaz hearing this shit
I hear what I said hope you feel it
Like me cause I'm feelin' this shit, shit
And after shows take pics OMMIO that's my click
Young nigga called 6 just touchdown
Got me 50-1-50 with a 100 rounds
I hit the party in my cities till they shut 'em down
Hit the studio and write a 100 pounds

Whoo-whoo
Cause we be really out here
Whoo-whoo
