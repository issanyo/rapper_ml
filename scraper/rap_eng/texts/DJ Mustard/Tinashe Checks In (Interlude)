[Intro: Male & Female]
God damn, bitch it's hot as fuck
Roll down the windows, turn on the AC
Or turn on some music or something, you got me fucked up
Let me see what's on the radio
(**DJ Mustard songs playing on every radio channel**)
No no no no no, hell naw, bitch, I'm tired of this shit
Bitch, hell naw!
Bitch I'm tired of this shit, I'm tired of this nigga

[Interlude: DJ Mustard]
92.3 Pusha Inc. Radio
It's a beautiful day in the city right now
I know everyone's out doing their thing, it's summertime
But I need all my sexy independent single ladies
If you don't need a nigga for shit
Call me up right now, like right fuckin' now

[Verse: Tinashe]
Would it be a mistake if I put it down on you?
I'm not into games, I've been feeling lonely, so are you
We should do the damn thing, let me hit the shower
Are you comin' through? Give me about an hour
And I'll be ready pop the pill, got super powers
Fuck you talkin' 'bout?
We don't even speak, we just do the nasty
Thought we would make a family
Used to love to see my nigga happy
Even though you brought baggage
Did everything you asked me but you was gettin' ratchet
Now we got damage, you let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches have it

[Outro]
Bitch get his phone, c'mon
He's asleep, let's go
(No bitch, I'm scared, no I can't do that)
Come we'll get his phone, c'mon
(Alright, fuck it, c'mon)
You know his code bitch?
(No, but I'm about to crack it)
It probably that bitch birthday
(It better not be, 5-2-6)
Check that nigga mama birthday
(Oh, 1-2-3)
Damn that ain't work neither
(Shit well is it my shit?)
Wait don't try too many time bitch
You gon' get locked out, we gon' get busted
(Damn bitch I'm already locked out)
Fuck (fuck)
