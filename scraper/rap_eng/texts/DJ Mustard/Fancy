Verse 01: DrAssenator
First Thing's First I'm The Realist
Whole Block's Against Me Still, I'll be realist
You baby boy rappers can't reach my level
I feed banana clips to you damn monkeys
Makin' me laugh like chunkies
If i ain't the greatest then i'm headed for it
Call me tony stark, when i tear the dark
Your girl like me
She's gettin' advice for real g's from Dogfart
Cause, Nigga I'm so fly
I'm next level devil, you can't  reach my level,bruh

[Chorus - Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, about to blow

Verse 02:DrAssenator
I Say baby- your baby got me on her playlist
Got her, wavin' hellos on me when i walk around with chips [Chips]
Banana clips for you monkeys, chips for the ladiez
Middle finger for the haties, but haties your baby's love me like an aventura
Cliques for the G's
Karma is a bitch, but takin' best of the bitch
Hoes with tricks, getting smacked like freaks, huh
Chicks love meh
Call me menace, cause i can make your recipes go rest in peace, ho
Feels like I'm squeezing on'em
But i'm the greatest round' here
And I'm provin; it with every drop
And, i'm hit yo

[Chorus - Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, about to blow

[Bridge]
Trash the hotel
Let's get drunk on the mini bar
Make the phone call
Feels so good getting what I want
Keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah Iâ€™m deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch

Verse 03: DrAssenator
So Many skiils, live inside my ill mind
I've been grindin' got you grown men hating on meh
But I'm mastur-ba-ting on the hate you giving to meh
See, I'm the realist, most illest
Don't listen what other niggas say huh
They hate me, cause they not me
Them motherfuckers wanna judge me, cause they not me
See, I'm the best and I'm headed for the greatest
I'm doc, and this shit is latest
And you latex, stay on that D

[Chorus - Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, about to blow

[Outro: Iggy Azalea]
WHo Dat-who dat, IGGY rock
