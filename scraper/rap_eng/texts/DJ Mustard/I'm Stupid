I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
Pull up to the school with my brain missin'!
Pull up to the school with my brain missin'!
Pull up to the school with my brain missin'!
Pull up to the school with my brain missin'!
Middle finger up to my freakin' teachers!
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
Pull up to the school with my brain missin'!

[Verse 1]
Pull up to the school on my Razor Scooter
All the teachers hate me, I'm their worst student
They say Kle Shay how'd you get so stupid
Stupid is a stupid does, I just put my mind to it
Got a GPA lower than a midget
Can't stay still up in class, gotta fidget
So I just skip, chillin with my niggas
They let me say that word, regardless of my pigment
Got a girlfriend, who laughs at my report card
She asked how I got straight F's? Cause I worked hard
Broke her heart when she got rejected at Harvard
She says I pronounce that wrong, baby that's absurd
Bitch the first word in the dictionary's Aardvark
I know that, cause I tried to read it and only got that far
It's a shame, people say I'm not smart
But hey I got a bright future working as a mall cop
It's not my fault I got distracted, blame the school system
Venn Diagram's look like boobies, they should get a new system
Better yet dude, you can blame all the teachers
It's their fault they're boring, not my fault I didn't listen

[Hook]
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
Pull up to the school on my Razor Scooter!
Pull up to the school on my Razor Scooter!
Pull up to the school on my Razor Scooter!
Pull up to the school on my Razor Scooter!
Middle finger up to my freakin' teachers!
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
Pull up to the school on my Razor Scooter!

[Verse 2]
Kle Shay, got a F on my quizzes
And when I said it's ridiculous, my teacher showed me my answers
When she showed me my answers, I didn't understand her
I left all of em blank to protest the tests nature...
Plus I'm a gangster...
Grades low, GPA low
Me and my principal don't get along!
I guess I'm gonna get my GED and drop out
Dad told me, if you do then you are kicked out
Ching-chow wing-wow, sound of the delivery man
That has nothing to do with this song, I just really wanted to say it
Well if they don't give a damn, I don't give a fuck!
Gonna become a bum, live it up, in an alley behind K-Mart
Man, I gotta tell you being homeless sucks
Moral of the story, stay in school kids!

I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
I'm stupid, yeah I'm stupid
Pull up to the school with my brain missin'!
