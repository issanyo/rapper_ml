[Verse 1]
Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah?
You can ride my face until you're dripping cum
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?
You gon' let me stretch that pussy out or nah?
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save ya
Baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favours
Pussy so good, I had to save that shit for later, later
Panda, Panda, Panda

[Hook]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers

[Verse 2]
I don't want a good girl, I been rolling with the baddest
She told me she models and she told me she an actress
Talking 'bout her, she been everywhere up on the atlas
Doesn't make a difference, she still end up on my mattress
Fuck your 15 minutes, I'm the man of the hour
No more room up in my bed, let's take it to the shower
Talking how she love me and she don't want me without her
You don't love me, you just love my money and my power
Hey, cause girl I'm on
And if you need a drink, you take anything you want
Cause it don't mean a thing, you can see 'em bringing more
Cause when we do our thing, table's shining like New York

[Hook]
Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time
It's been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, we do that every time
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah
Got a feeling you might, yeah
Got a feeling, got a feeling you might, yeah, might year
