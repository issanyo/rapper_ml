[Vesre 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, that's my main
Caught a nigga cheating and she stayed
Say she love me always
I fuck with my bitch the long way, ooh
Through the ups and the downs, unconditional
I eat it in the morning like cereal
Here we go, here we go, we ain't done yet
When she call me "big daddy", I love that
That my main, that's the one I curve all these hoes for
Got my name tatted on her body like a cholo
Ten toes down for a nigga, she a rida
Head game crazy and that pussy fire
She get her own money and she ballin'
She answer when a real nigga callin' (when I'm callin')
Yeah, that's my main thing
Everywhere we on the same thing, us

[Verse 4: Mila J]
Who's always there when I call
And even when I fall
(Yeah if your main in here right now, I wanna see you point her out)
Who been with me since day one
Won't turn on me for anyone
(Yeah if your main in here right now, I wanna see you point her out)

[Chorus: Mila J]
Dat my main one, dat my main one
Yeah she up in here with me right now
I said dat my main one, dat my main one
Yeah she know that she's my ride or die (say what)
So all you haters you can-you can try tonight
Cuz I'm down for whatever when she's by my side
Dat my main one, dat my main one
And we always be down for life
