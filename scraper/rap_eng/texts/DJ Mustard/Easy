[Verse 1]
I'll fix the strings and play my part
I know the pain that's in your heart
I've tread the distance, near or far
Just wanna be right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I know love has been a stranger to you
Maybe I'm the one to change it for you
Won't be easy 'cause the lessons feel new
But the writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
Love is easy, easy
So don't you make it hard
Can't you see me, see me, see me?
Be easy with my heart

[Post-Chorus]
All we got is here and now
Why won't you let your guard down?
I'm just tryna show you how
Love is easy
So don't you make it hard

[Verse 2]
I'll chase the wind, I'll face your dark
I'll make a wish upon your star
Although you're afraid I'll break your heart
Just let my hands erase your scars

[Pre-Chorus]
I know love has been a stranger to you
Maybe I'm the one to change it for you
Won't be easy 'cause the lessons feel knew
But the writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
Love is easy, easy
So don't you make it hard
Can't you see me, see me, see me?
Be easy with my heart

[Bridge]
Oh, take your time, no need for rushing things (Rushing things)
Baby, don't you know that with me, you're safe?
The easy option is to run away (Don't run away)
To hide from love, oh, baby, what would it change?
I been thinking 'bout some better days (Better days, yeah)
Not to pressure, all I'm tryna say is...

[Chorus]
Love is easy, easy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So don't you make it hard (Don't you make it, said don't you make it hard)
Can't you see me, see me, see me? (Can't you see me crying)
Be easy with my heart (My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart)

[Post-Chorus]
All we got is here and now (All we got is here and now)
Why won't you let your guard down (Your guard down)
I'm just tryna show you how
Love is easy (So, so easy, yeah)
So don't you make it hard (Hard)
