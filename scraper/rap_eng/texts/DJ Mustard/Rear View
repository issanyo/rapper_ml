[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
So much stack, I wanna thank your mama and everybody know why
Too much that both hands can't grab, but best believe I'm gon' try
Got 5 percent on my window, no seeing into my ride
Don't think too hard, girl, let's go, give me your thoughts while I drive
Come on, baby, tell me, baby, tell me right now
We can make that back seat to 'tel right now
Adjust the rear view, oh, that's the clear view
Girl, I hope you're ready, hope you're ready right now
And dance is a hobby, oh, good lordy
Nothing get the Porches, but she's a Bugatti
Break push start it, break push start it
Baby, don't hurt nobody

[Hook: August Alsina]
Baby, pump your breaks, I think you need to pull over
Come on and swerve my way, back it up, let me slow up
Cause baby I see you, all up in my rear view
Yeah, I see you, but I need a rear view

[Refrain: August Alsina and Flo Rida]
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Girl I like that, crack in my mirror, give me bad luck like that hourglass figure
Ringing my wing 'til that thing get bigger, curve like a trigger, wanna cut you like a scissor
That's it, baby, nearer, I love your hind side from the back, you're a winner
Thick skirts, thick, get it feda prime dinner, get it, twerk it, shake it 'til my knee cap shiver, yeah
Don't I like what's below that spine? Both cheeks shaking at the same damn time
Shorty be my lady, can't replace that wine, presidential status on my Rollie face shine
See when that jiggle it's official call it 808, some toilet tissue, you know the shit, let that marinade
Like something bitch, you wanna yum bum celebrate, you know it's real when I say

[Hook: August Alsina]
Baby, pump your breaks, I think you need to pull over
Come on and swerve my way, back it up, let me slow up
Cause baby I see you, all up in my rear view
Yeah, I see you, but I need a rear view

[Refrain: August Alsina and Flo Rida]
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see

[Bridge: August Alsina]
Now we in the fast lane, pedal to the floor, babe
Speed it up, speed it up, don't stop, I'mma beat it up, beat it up, someone call the cops
Now we in the fast lane, pedal to the floor, babe
Speed it up, speed it up, don't stop, I'mma beat it up, beat it up, baby I'm speeding

[Hook: August Alsina]
Baby, pump your breaks, I think you need to pull over
Come on and swerve my way, back it up, let me slow up
Cause baby I see you, all up in my rear view
Yeah, I see you, but I need a rear view

[Refrain: August Alsina and Flo Rida]
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see
