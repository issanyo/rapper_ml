[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Wake up in the mornin' roll a blunt, before a young nigga brush his teeth
Wipe his face with a warm rag, back to the streets
Money on his mind, last night he couldn't even eat
Money on his mind, he couldn't eat
Mama must think he gettin' out of hand, but he think he's all good 'cuz he got a couple bands
Woman, 21, shorty stay up in the club, [?] shorty wanna be a thug
Double cup nigga [?] white with that lean
Cash rules everything, my young nigga lives by C.R.E.A.M
Gettin' a little paper, now the bitches all on 'em
Gettin' a little paper, now the bitches all want 'em
Might be a lot of things, but he ain't no fool
[?], young niggas at work without his tool
[?] my young nigga rocky
Show up 40 deep and get this motherfucker poppin'

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 2: YG]
This is for my young nigga locked up for something he ain't did
But he really locked up for for somebody else's crime he said
Put him on the case, but he ain't really did nothin'
But he go an' take it for the hood, he ain't [?] like fuck it
We came here with a lawyer, but the lawyer bullshittin'
Went to court with my nigga, all we could do was listen
20 years young, he don't wanna go to prison
15 to life, he like fuck that sentence
And I ain't even that I paying for the lawyer
Me and [?] thinkin', we got played by the lawyer
With a life sentence, he can't get a [?]
Plus, [?]
But, fuck it he thuggin', all he want is some pictures of money he can't eat lunch with
His Day 1 Niggas he just wanna keep in touch with, but, remember, he ain't even do nothin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Raised by the block, stay by a Glock
One of the big homies got him workin' on the clock
