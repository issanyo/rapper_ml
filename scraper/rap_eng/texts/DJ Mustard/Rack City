[Intro]
I don't even like this verse
Hahahaha...
No shut up!

[Hook]
Uh, Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Uh, Yeah it's Timmy bitch
Let me play with your titties bitch
Yeah!

[Verse]
I go hard on the track you would think I'm in a chain gang
I got that good wood, but not my chain main
Bout to set it off, hands up, bang bang
My turn to blow like I'm last in a gang bang
I'm in Paramount, find me with the vatos
Get a Latin lady and im eatin' out her taco
Hit it from the back now I'm tearin up the gato
Make her face change like I'm Pablo Picasso
You can't play me, stop that, pause it
Too much fly shit
All up in my closet
Make a video then I make a new deposit
Write a new rhyme then I never memorize it
They gon' say Tim, write about some deep shit
You want some deep shit, jump up in the sea bitch (BITCH!!!)
Listen up, cause you won't have Tim long
Cause I'm ill to death... Kim Jong
Get it
Cause he's dead
Kim Jong Il
Just died
Yah, yah
I gotta rest this one guys

Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Black titties bitch, black black titties bitch
