[Intro]
Ay, Ay, Ayy!

[Verse 1: Kitster]

What's that, walk up in the club where my cup at?
Purple weed, lean and my bitch is sipping Malbec
Drop it to the floor oh yea where the ones at?
And I only wanna hit it once and never come back
Referral that, we'll chat, not fake it's all fact
120k spent on clothes yea we copped that
Leave the club with 20 girls yea we bring them all back
You be talking short shit, we be talking tall stacks
Neiman and the Louis are the places that we shop at
Got that, (Yea) and all these bitches wanna king me
Ain't wanna girlfriend or a queen they be bitchy
New Roley on they be asking what my wrist be
So much liquor down my system fuck my kidneys
Pull up, in a brand new whip we make a killing
Chilling, with your bitch call that shit a checkmate
Get it, if she DTF that's a bet bae

[Hook: KSnS]
Drop drop drop it real low  
Drop drop it real low 
Drop it to the floor
Drop drop it to the floor (x2)

Drop drop it real low 
Drop drop it real low
Drop it to the floor 
Drop drop it to the floor (x2)

Dr-drop it real low  
Drop drop it real low 
Drop it to the floor
Drop drop it to the floor (x2)

[Verse 2: Sylla]
She gone drop it down move around like she want some
Thirsty ass bitches taking pictures getting thumbs up
Now they on the pole getting throwed ‘cause they on one
Ratchet ass hoes they don’t know we ain’t ‘bout that
We ain’t ‘bout that
Nah, we ain’t bout that
XO on the low got her chit-chat
Pissed off at your mister, calling Kitster, wrist up middle finger to a bitch (ahh)
Drop it down low
Now shake ya booty
Giving me head like she giving me a noogie
Riding her around like a mother fucking boogie
She might pop molly, now she being loopy
Gone get loosey
Gone get looney
I don’t fuck with you if you a straight up boojie
Please get groovie
Better keep moving
Bounce that ass and shake those boobies like…

[Hook: KSnS]

[Outro]
Drop it to the floor, floor
