[Verse 1: D Lo]
Pull up, yeah my whip look like a turtle neck
And if you ain’t heard is where they murder at (east oakland)
All eyes on me I think I’m 2 pac
2k’s but I’m toting me a 40 Glock
Erythang purple I mean erythang
From the drink in my cup to the mary jane
I got a 30 on this 40 you better bag back
Or get your head crack like a bad back
It’s d lo, on my mama ain't no nigga harder
My niggas catch murders, fuck a man slaughter
I’m Derrick Rose, I won’t miss a shot
I’m at the free throw line with this 40 Glock
Rondo, I keep a 9 on me
Just in case a pussy nigga tryina slide on me
You ride for that bitch but you won’t ride for your niggas
You’s a b i t c h nigga!

[Hook]
Ok, niggas stay in your lane

[Verse 1: YG]
Ok, niggas stay in your lane
Stop saying my name, tryina act like you a cat
You ain’t got 9 lives, but this night I make you stay in your grave
You should ashamed, young nigga ballin
Your bitch keep callin

And you ain’t got shit
You should be ashamed, cause I’m poppin
Walked in the mall, tell my niggas go cop some
Buy burners for the hood, till my homies go pop some
We gonn pull up, you gonn hop out
And do your shit nigga, you better drop something!

[Hook]
Ok, niggas stay in your lane
Before that gat scatter yo brain
Click clack, bang, bang
Never leave the house without my thang
Take your bitch and your chain
My nigga you’s a b i t c h
My nigga you’s a b i t c h
My nigga you’s a b i t c h !
