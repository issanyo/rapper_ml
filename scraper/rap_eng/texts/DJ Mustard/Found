[Intro]
Mustard on that beat, ho!

[Verse 1]
Your kind of love should have a warning
Didn't know I would fall like this
Each and every morning can't wait to kiss your lips, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't looking for another one
No need you got everything I want
Just keep giving me love
Giving me love
Giving me love

[Chorus]
In the madness of this world
I'm glad I found you
When my heart don't seem to work
It's you I turn to
It get hard it get hard out there
Put your arms put your arms right here, oh
You don't have to say a word
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found

[Verse 2]
Something I can build on
Your rock in the sea of sand
Even when the sun gone
You bring the light of your love to my land, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't looking for another one
No need you got everything I want
Just keep giving me love
Giving me love
Giving me love

[Chorus]
In the madness of this world
I'm glad I found you
When my heart don't seem to work
It's you I turn to
It get hard it get hard out there
Put your arms put your arms right here, oh
You don't have to say a word
I'm glad I found

[Bridge]
Someone with the effort
Someone with the time
Water in the desert
I I'm glad I found
Good amongst the evil
Simba in his prime
Ooh I'm in my equal
I'm glad I found you, yeah yeah
I'm glad I found you, yeah yeah
I'm glad I found

[Chorus]
In the madness of this world
I'm glad I found you
When my heart don't seem to work
It's you I turn to
It get hard it get hard out there
Put your arms put your arms right here, oh
You don't have to say a word
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found
