Pass me the microphone/
And I'll hit rappers acting like Joe Jackson/
Until they leave the mic alone/
Is this mic on?!/
In other words most rappers re-lease music/
But still, leave the mic a loan/
Strike you with the greatest hits/
Why you always missing it?/
Guess cuz every batter wants to come a get the Biz quick/
A wiz in the mix/
Bout to whisk you with a quiz/
Then flip you just like a pancake/
Just a man stating he's steak sauce/
Since they raised stakes on the day they made J cross/
Not Dr. Jay but cross Jordans while rocking Jays/
Guess I'll save face crossing lakes and these water banks/
I Liquidate your funds/
To fund all of my fun/
Then funnel it down a tunnel/
At the risk of sounding redundant/
Humming these conundrums/
Like Dr. Seuss fused with Riddler on Ritalin/
Quick, clever Enigmas, forming a question/
Testing false truths with true or false tests/
Make a Liar wanna say yes to them/
I am the Yes man/
Not Tricks but you guessed it kid/
I'm not a gymnist/
Got carried away with riddles that sound like fitness/
Didn't catch the reference?/
Let's just say I'm saying I'm popping off like a penguin/
Like Mr. Popper in Gotham/
Or should I just say CobblePott/
Is that a penguin a sly fox?/
I think you should just watch/
