[Intro]

My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make a new flow

[Hook]

My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make a new flow
Tryna get the girls 2 stepping on a dance floor
2 stepping on a dance floor

My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make new a flow
Tryna get the girls 2 stepping on a dance floor
2 stepping on a dance floor

African vibe
Imma make u mine

Don't waste my time
Imma make u mine
Imma make u whine

...i told her

[Hook]

My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make a new flow
Tryna get the girls 2 stepping on a dance floor
2 stepping on a dance floor

My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make a new flow
Tryna get the girls 2 stepping on a dance floor
2 stepping on a dance floor

My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make a new flow
Tryna get the girls 2 stepping on a dance floor
2 stepping on a dance floor


[Verse]

How you mean when you say that you got a man
I look flyer than most & i got a plan
Low-key i know, that you been a fan
You wanna see me blow like taliban

I treat the love game like Afghanistan
It's war till I prove I'm better man
Right now i know i wanna bust 1 skank
But the slow vibe, made me take your hand

[Bridge]

African vibe
Imma make u mine
Imma make u whine

Don't waste my time
Imma make u mine
Imma make u whine

...i told her

[Hook]
My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make a new flow
Tryna get the girls 2 stepping on a dance floor
2 stepping on a dance floor

My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make a new flow
Tryna get the girls 2 stepping on a dance floor
2 stepping on a dance floor

My bando be my studio
I've been there all day tryna make a new flow
Tryna get the girls 2 stepping on a dance floor
2 stepping on a dance floor

[outro]

My bando be my studio
Ain't got time for the niggas i know
Ain't got time for the bitches i know
Busy 2 steppin' up, in the studio

I ain't got time for the team i know..
Ye, i've only got time for my bando
I've only got time for my bando
I've only got love for my bando

2 steppin' in the studio
Don't, don't, don't, don't you question me

Don't, don't, don't, don't you question me
I know what i need
Don't, don't, don't, don't you question me
I know what i need
