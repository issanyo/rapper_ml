[Intro: Jeremih]
She is the freak of the week, now everybody
See, she is the freak of the week

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Last night I had two bitches
Vegas where it's always getting real
Something sexy 'bout them pretty keep it hood bitches
They just seem to show me what I'm feeling
Let your body see, I said she freakin' to me
The way she move that ass to the beat
Now everybody see, she is the freak of the week
You got your body speaking to me

[Verse 2: Krept]
Step, step, step to the party like an OG
Party jumping, neighbours can't go sleep
Now the neighbours tryna call the police
Fuck the feds
Say you a freak, show me how freaky
And she got moves like bad gyal RiRi
Said he hit it right, go H·A·M when he tap that
You last ten seconds, man, you're a Snapchat
Hit it in a car, hit it in a house
Hit it in a bath, hit it on a couch
Meet me outside, jump in the ride
If she ain't mine then she probably with Kone (holla at me)

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
I'mma grab your waist, okay
How much long gonna take? I'll wait
Came with that nigga? No, no
You should be my bitch

[Hook: Jeremih]
See, she is the freak of the week
The way that body speaking to me
Now everybody see, she is the freak of the week
You got your body speaking to me
Uh, yeah I know that you want it, you want it
You want it, you want it
Tonight, let's see you get naughty, get naughty
Get naughty, get naughty

[Verse 3: Konan]
Say you got a man, you don't seem sure
Showing off your skin, I wanna see more
We can take a little detour
Have you ever ate McDonalds on a G4?
You got your keys to my beep beep
They ain't doing it right, come and see me
I can tell that you're freaky
And I know you ain't shy like Chief Keef
I can see you got your eye on it
Big batty girl, come whine on it
Big titty girl, where your arse at?
She can't believe that I asked that

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
I'mma grab your waist, okay
How much long gonna take? I'll wait
Came with that nigga? No, no
You should be my bitch

[Hook: Jeremih]
See, she is the freak of the week
The way that body speaking to me
Now everybody see, she is the freak of the week
You got your body speaking to me
Uh, yeah I know that you want it, you want it
You want it, you want it
Tonight, let's see you get naughty, get naughty
Get naughty, get naughty

[Bridge: Jeremih]
She's a freak, she's so freaky
She's so freaky, oh so freaky
She's a freak, she's so freaky

[Hook: Jeremih]

Tonight, let’s see you get naughty, get naughty
Get naughty, get naughty
