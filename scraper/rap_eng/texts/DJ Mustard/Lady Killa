[Intro: Cocc Pistol Cree]
I’m reloaded
Cocc Pistol
Click clack… bang
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Verse 1: Cocc Pistol Cree]
I’m killin' these hoes, blood trail from the red bottoms
Hermes, Berkin in my hand, bag full of problems
Pull up dumb late, middle of the driveway
Every day payday, toss the key to valet
I’m stuntin' in the club like I own it
Brought my own table, why the fuck is you on it?
Bottles comin' off the ceilin', sip from the omen
These young niggas broke, where the fuck the old men?
A hunnid bitches strong and we go alone
So bend the pink slip, fuck a car note
It’s hot as a bitch and it’s mean cold
But I’m a bossy bitch, cut the air wrong

[Bridge: Cocc Pistol Cree]
If this could kill I’m the ladykilla
Bunch of bad bitches all around me like I’m babysittin'
Tight pussy, broke niggas can’t fit in it
She ain’t got shit on me cuz I’m the ladykilla

[Hook: Cocc Pistol Cree]
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
Don't watch me, bitch, watch yo' nigga
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
Don't watch me, bitch, watch yo' nigga

[Verse 2: Cocc Pistol Cree]
I got a few hunnid in my hand, about to throw out
Keep a few hunnid in my bag until I show out
It’s all on the trick, brown skin dumb thick
And if he like grip phones, I got a couple in my grip
Bitches turn up, party 'til the sun up
Slip a molly in his drink now he payin' like he owe us
He think he dooped but he don’t know us, we certified killers
Bunch of bitches hit the flow when we walked in the buildin'
Got my mack on, got my shades on
I’m just squarin' bitches, send them punk bitches home
Got my Robins on, got my Fendi on
If the nigga ain’t trickin' send his broke ass home

[Bridge: Cocc Pistol Cree]
Hair done, nails done
Brass niggas case a bitch want some
Nigga lookin like he wanna spit some
Spit some, you might get some

[Hook: Cocc Pistol Cree]
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
Don't watch me, bitch, watch yo' nigga
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
Don't watch me, bitch, watch yo' nigga

(Verse)
Look, I don’t fly coach and I win
I’m a boss bitch, you clueless like Blair
Got a millionaire with some sort and pepper hair
Just swindle him to die so I can get my share
I’m killin' 'em, I’m killin' 'em
I be seein' dead prez' like gainin' 'em
I’m killin' 'em, I’m killin' 'em
I be seein' dead prez' like gainin' 'em

[Bridge: Cocc Pistol Cree]
Well wait hold up, 'cause I’m about to squirk up
Your little greedy bitches made a go and get yo' dough up
Well wait hold up, my bitches bout to turn up
Mustard on the beat, you rap bitches better catch up

[Hook: Cocc Pistol Cree]
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
Don't watch me, bitch, watch yo' nigga
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
I’m the lady, the lady-lady, the ladykilla
Don't watch me, bitch, watch yo' nigga
