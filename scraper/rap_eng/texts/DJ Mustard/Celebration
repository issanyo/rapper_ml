Medicated, hella faded
Everyday we turn up it's a celebration
We don't wait for the money just make reservations
3 mollies 2 bitches that's a celebration
If show no kitty you won't get no check
My nigga please don't get me wrong
All the bitches on me, it's ok come on
You niggas hatin', it's a celebration

[Verse 1]
Glitter box in my mouth it's a celebration
Hundred bands on a nigga no hesitation
You can pull up to the trap no reservation
Still strapped, even though I'm on probation
Real A town don nigga, go and face it
New king getting out but I'm underrated
Big pistol in my hand, nigga no safety
50 shots out that Glock, nigga celebrating
Word out, and they got no patience
Lotta nigga reticent and gang banging
These niggas switchin' up Alley ain't changing
Blow'd hundred in a week just celebrating

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get money, bitch is robbin' and she gotta pay me
Good girl gone bitch from the late 80'
Got a slim white bitch that tryna act shady
Always scrat the protein with a 3-80
Celebrating, money making
This a million dolla dick, bitch, act crazy
I'ma blood, nigga, bang gazelle, goin' crazy
Ain't nobody run into the money don't be lazy
Fuck cake, nigga, this a celebration
Rob bitch, it wasn't me, it's elimination
Fifty inches in her ass, she out celebratin'
Last nigga tryna mob said he didn't make it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm celebrating off coke
Get your ass shipped and I ain't talking about poked
Ho ass niggas still acting like [?]
The motherfucking mob around here [?]
Around 50 niggas that's the 504
Only words to the law is "I don't know"
Ain't a bitch at the city that I can't poke
I'm a ratchet ass nigga got rich off dope
I ball with the mob, get money with the mob
Treat a bitch like a tongue and go to sleep in her mouth
Residential to the south and we connecting to the loud
Got a plug in the A niggas know what I'm about
