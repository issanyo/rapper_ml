[Intro: YG]
Mustard on the beat ho

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location, let's
Send me your location, let's
Send me your location, let's
I don't need nothing else but...

[Drop: DJ Mustard]

[Verse: Khalid]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Send me your location, let's
Send me your location, let's
I don't need nothing else but...

[Drop: DJ Mustard]

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
