[Intro]
Mustard on that beat, ho

[Chorus]
Talk too much, baby, put it in your mouth
Says she's from the west coast, I love it better down the south (word, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse]
Say she rep the set though, flex though
Say she fell in love with Death Row
Back in 9-4 and I met her on the west coast
She gets the best smoke
I just really want your number
WhatÂ´s your metro?
Girl, you know it's no vest, though
For the blessed, though
Valley outside, let's go
Lot of money in my jeans
Look light that passion
Girl need knee pads, pass that ass, Steve Nash
Girl, would you come and bounce that?
Let me bounce that, I need it counted
To help a nigga come and counter
Need a bouncer
To get you off me, how you bounce it?
Let me drown in the pussy, wetter than a fountain
Won't you put it in the rear for me, baby, mountain
Smoking gas, need a firm and to put it out'cha
Smoking on loud, they can't hear
I know it's gon' know when she whisper in my ear

[Chorus]
Talk too much, baby put it in your mouth
Says she's from the worst coast, I love it better down the south (word, hey, hey, hey, hey)
