She let me eat it with my grill in, and tell me never turn the lights off
Skirt through the light, gone
But you know how to ride slow when you with Mr. K-I-D-I-N-K
Know I done spent all night try'na fight through the hoes cause

When I walk up in the house have nothing on when I get home
Hit it with the left hit it with the right you can call me Quavo Larry Holmes
My bitch she's not basic at all, I walk in the mall buy a bed for her doll
She shit on you hoes walking bathroom stalls, she get super nasty on alcohol
Pull up in the coupe with the roof missing, got a bad bitch riding with the nipple pierced
Blood on the floor dripping my Christians, that's Louboutin if you don't get it
Got 5 mamacitas and my eyes low and I got them all on cinco de mayo
I spotted her front row at my show make her the trap queen I brought her to the bando

Go on and spread 'em baby
