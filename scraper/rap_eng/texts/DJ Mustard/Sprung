You’re flirting with me, I’m flirting with you
Let me feel all on you
Annie let’s stop playing around
Let me take you home and dick you down
And get you sprung on this
Get you sprung on this
Annie let me get you sprung on this
Yeah, get you sprung on this

[Verse 1: YG]
If I told that I love you I be lying to you
Cause if I loved you I’d be on that jet flying to you
Hold up, she got an ass like Pinky
Pretty bitch but she act so easty
Bam give it to her like bam
I ain’t from the Lou, but that pussy get ram
I got her screaming, moaning, hit it from the back

[Verse 2: Teeflii]
Annie, south central niggas turn you up
Real niggas in the hood twisting fingers up
You scared, I ain’t scared to beat the pussy up
Don't play, no games, I tear it up
