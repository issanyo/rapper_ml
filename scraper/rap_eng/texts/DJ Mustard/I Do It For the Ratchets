[Intro]
Buck I see you
Mustard on the beat ho!

[Verse 2]
Fat pussy
Hit it from the back pussy
Run a lap, Marathon
Make a track pussy
Jack pussy
Fuck it in the trap pussy
Have a nigga killin' other niggas, if you have pussy
Wait a second no pants, Air tight
And only club if your hair and nails right
Fuck them red bottom jays for the fair price
Knock a nigga down with you friend, You the share type
Rack city
Tyga said rack city
Black fifty
Gucci with the black dickies
Back with me
Man I go all in
Twitter fan, tell the bitch you can call in
Ass like Nicky
Never leave a hicky
Got a nigga in the bitch, fuck waitin' you picky
You ain't ever been MickyYou a fool on the meat
Fuck what they talkin' bout' you a fool in the sheets

[Hook]
"She holla"
Where the ballers at, ask me where the ballers at
Hut one, hut two, im the quarter back
Fuck a pretty bitch gotta let you have it
I don't do this for the motherfucking rapping; I do this for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets

[Verse 2]
Verse two
Sadity man I hate those
Go bowling in her pussy, A hole
Nice face but her ass like play dough
Charge on the mouth with my dick, Diego
Knock it off knock it in then knock it down
Mayweather with the ratchets, knock em out
Said her last nigga weird, Pacquiao
Left her in the studio, ass up face down
Pretty bitches gon' hate we donâ€™t need that
Where the ratchets at, tell me where the ratchets at
Shake your ass to the beat then bring it back
Mills said bleed
Driver can you handle that?

[Hook]
"She holla"
Where the ballers at, ask me where the ballers at
Hut one, hut two, im the quarter back
Fuck a pretty bitch gotta let you have it
I dont do this for the mutha fuckin' rappin', I do this for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets

[Outro]
Hey hey hey
