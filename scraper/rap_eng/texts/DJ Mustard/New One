[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh yeah
Ooh yeah
Dolla Sign
Mustard on the beat ho!

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
If she a freak then Imma find out, I don't know but Imma find out
I'm in the club with a bool one, but I'm looking for a new one (a new one, yeah)
Looking for a new one, a new one yeah
I want a new one, yeah yeah
Looking for a new one, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Here we go!
If she a freak Imma find out, I don't know but Imma find out
And she ain't got no class, had to put that bitch on time out
I just fucked her in the living room, pussy so deep I had to climb out
And she never seen my bedroom, she ain't ever seen my momma house
Check a hoe, then I check my bank account
I'm sipping codeine with my pinky out
And I don't talk about bitches man, unless the head good enough to think about it
So hold on let me think about it
Wait a 1 minute, let me think about it
Shawty pussy so wet mane, I mean a bitch need a sink around it

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
If she a freak then Imma find out, I don't know but Imma find out
I'm in the club with a bool one, but I'm looking for a new one (a new one, yeah)
Looking for a new one, a new one yeah
I want a new one, yeah yeah
Looking for a new one, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She had some coke, she spread some lines out
She said don't tell nobody, I be mimed out
She unzip my pants and pull slime out
She said Tunechi you a beast, let me find out
Ass everywhere, ass everywhere, pull up in that thing you never saw, parallel
Time to fuck a bitch, I never fuck
Where the fuck she at?
I be standing like some colored clothes, blame the Laundromat
Who you see?
I walked in this bitch with a cute bitch
And we gon' leave out this bitch with a new bitch
Man I'm just stickin' to the bread like a toothpick
Nigga gon' head, cut that hoe if she don't do shit
Lick her like a fine bitch that find bitches
Shout out to all my side bitches
Young fly nigga thats jetlag, you don't know about time difference
I rhyme different, I'm so hard I could do a verse and leave a line missing
Tunechi!

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
If she a freak then Imma find out, I don't know but Imma find out
I'm in the club with a bool one, but I'm looking for a new one (a new one, yeah)
Looking for a new one, a new one yeah
I want a new one, yeah yeah
Looking for a new one, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Just bought a new crib, need a new one
Got an old school red and a blue one
Me and my niggas got fur coats on, make it look like the fucking zoo coming
Told my old bitch I need a new one
Sold my last brick, I need a new one
She always talking about working out, so I stretched her out like a futon
Fuck my last bitch on a coffee table (ya dig!)
Fuck my new bitch on a hockey table
If this is a Miyagi hoe [?] I got like a hunnid flavours
If you don't know, you better find out
Bat cave, honeycomb hide out
I slip in and I slide out
I'm known to go deep, like a white out

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
If she a freak then Imma find out, I don't know but Imma find out
I'm in the club with a bool one, but I'm looking for a new one (a new one, yeah)
Looking for a new one, a new one yeah
I want a new one, yeah yeah
Looking for a new one, yeah
Yeah, yeah
