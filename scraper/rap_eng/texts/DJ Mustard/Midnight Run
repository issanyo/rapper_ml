[Verse 1: Royce The Choice]
Holly-wood but it's north-west Saudi
206 like the number of bones in your body
She bought a room for us and I boned in the lobby
If you hit the room you would owe more than Gaddafi
Eating first teriyaki
Purple and brown Huarache's
Sloppy toppy got me knock kneed
Oxy Reynolds in my chai tea
Copy..(sound affect)..copy
All these niggas ever do so much I'm feeling like I'm not me
(Laugh) Fuck with the one-time none time
You subtract's I let the racks plus sign
I'm never off
Garth Brooks hat going pop
With my white bitch never look back, USC
Pound of whole "E" in her book bag
Parents had a trust fund for her and I took that
Know I need it
Get your life 'fore the grim reaper get it
When she goes bankrupt then he can get it
Rocking Tim Witcher fitted
All accuited like a Cochran case
Take my pickens then I roll like a Stockton play
This christian was raised with jews
Would knock your bitch if she came in new
But she through

[Hook: Royce The Choice]
God if I gotta go, for the funeral
Could I get all my hoes in the front row?
I need all my hoes in the front row
All my hoes in the front row
God if I gotta go, at the funeral
Could I get all my hoes in the front row?
I need all my hoes in the front row
All my hoes in the front row

[Verse 2: Skeme]
(Look) young Duke, I stay with bad bitches
I mean bitches so bad I use my crib to add attention
Try to told them this was pimpin'
But these niggas never listen
Find her right off Manchester if your baby momma missing
Sucka Proof
Nigga I'm the truth
Money through the roof
Everything slow but paper off a 7 of that juice
Riding coupes
Leaning with your boo
This shit what I do
I got old hundreds in my rap, shit ain't nothing new
I got Mustard on bid-neat
And your bitch on the fid-neat
I keep stacks so tall, boy your dollars all pygmy (aye)
I'm ballin' on them, stay tryna defend me
Steady taking shots at niggas man, but that shit don't offend me
I just made another 50 through my email nigga
"Fore this rap we bought it whole and sold it retail nigga
Run your mouth about the kid, you like a female nigga
Your show money couldn't get my whip a detail nigga (aye)
Young boys pulling euros out the lot
Man I would take your girl but I heard that bitch a bop
I got homies who got plots
And got more homies that flock
You won't be rich out the hood, it's best you think about the box (aye)
Told this world that "it's fuck you pay me"
For the last 8 months I rolled around in a Mercedes
Talking Lexus, drop head caddy's
And bitches don't call me by my name, they call me...

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Maa if I gotta go, just take life slow
They being haters online that's a typo
Young Veggies I'm bout to give the game lipo
She bust it open for the free, you getting priced though
I right wrongs, write songs, and we don't wife hoes
Mustard on the beat, that's gone make the function go
I'm making money while I'm swaggin', that's a "W"
You the first to lose, coming in number 2
Fuck you saying ho? Let your man loose
She leave me for a lame, she a lame to
I'm out here getting to it, tryna keep my name true
Mama use me in the shower like shampoo
I know they told ya I'm the boy but I'm the man too
Could make a chick think but I can make her dance too
My cuzzo took a "L" and he know what's up
I'm putting money on his books while I'm rolling up
The best part about it: When I make you open up
And then I turn you round, back shots be going up
Young niggas run the city, I signed the declaration
Alcohol in your system, she showed that temptation
We split them hoes up, I call it segregation
She rock my shirt with panties, now that's that product placement
I rock them Puma suades
We do them Prada's too
Wasn't rapping I could be a fashion model too
