(DJ Drama intro w/ Jeezy ad-libs)
When we well and gone, please enjoy the legacy
(it's all the same, it's all the same)
And remember, we envisioned this from the beginning
(Yeah... yeah what, yeah what, what... ha

[Hook]
It's all the same, it's all the same
All you rappers got work
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody did dirt
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody whip work (raise the generation)
It's all the same, it's all the same
All these bitches gon talk

[Bridge:]
If you hit one club you ran through them all
Brought her girlfriends I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same 'caine
A hundred of you niggas is saying the same thing

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Bitch nigga where the bricks at
Put 'em in the hood so they can flip that
I don't know if you heard who fucked up
I'm supposed to be here you lost cut
When the shit come on it goes silly
You fucking round Mr. put on for my city
Mr. 1800 motherfucker broke nigga pound
Fuck this sucker duck ass nigga that did it for the town
Mr. just bought another ho, 10 go down
Just to reassure me I gon see no clown
I never ever think I'm too rich for this shit
Got that 40 cal on me 2 clips for this bitch

[Bridge:]
If you hit one club you ran through them all
Brought her girlfriends I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same 'caine
A hundred of you niggas is saying the same thing

[Hook]

(In about 3 seconds E-40 will begin to speak)

[Verse 2: E-40]
They say the game's the same but the players change
But the players change and the game done changed
Ain't nothing changed about me but my chain
My paper, my crib, my fame
Everybody sound the same except us but we don't give a fuck
Man toss that lame a stool so he can step it up
Man this soft ass sucka ain't cool bruh, no good luck
You know when they act a fool and when they cut up
My money long like Cher hair I'm everywhere like air
I'm out here with the hot pants where they don't play fair
Got hella nicknames like weed strains
Just spark a swisher and get high as Dubai cranes

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
If you hit one club you ran through them all
Brought her girlfriends I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same 'caine
A hundred of you niggas is saying the same thing

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Every year since I got here they'd thought it'd be their year
And then it's all the same.... Still at it
