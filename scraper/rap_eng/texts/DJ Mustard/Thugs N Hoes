[Intro]
Got to get a bitch and get my dick sucked
Got to get a bitch and get my dick sucked
2x

[Chorus: Vell]
Thugs and hoes, thugs and hoes
All a nigga fuck with is thugs and hoes
2x

[Verse 1: Vell]
My whole life i've been thugging
Since a little nigga, been getting money
Moved up from the 4's to the 6's
Now a nigga foreign on this whip shit
30 toes down, time to get band up'd
Real niggas know the 30 never jam bruh
All shots to the head bruh
E-N-T, G-T getting bread huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday all chewy
On a Sunday all Louie
And it's real life pimping
Man my life is a movie
Pull up in the 6
Hop out all Gucci
Niggas smashing on their bitches
Cause they hoes all choose me

[Chorus: Vell]
Thugs and hoes, thugs and hoes
All a nigga fuck with is thugs and hoes
2x

[Verse 2]
Wake up and hit a lick
5-0 get on us then we kick
E-N-T with this shit
Niggas talkin that jimmy
Pull a Glock from the hip
From the trap straight to the fucking blade bitch
Only thugs and hoes finna get paid bitch
So going get some fucking chips
Cause if it ain't dollar signs
Then it don't make sense

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday all chewy
On a Sunday all Louie
And it's real life pimping
Man my life is a movie
Pull up in the 6
Hop out all Gucci
Niggas smashing on their bitches
Cause they hoes all choose me

[Chorus: Vell]
Thugs and hoes, thugs and hoes
All a nigga fuck with is thugs and hoes
2x

[Bridge]
And what i'm doing?
Got to get a bitch and get my dick sucked
And what i'm doing?
Got to get a bitch and get my dick sucked
2x

[Chorus: Vell]
Thugs and hoes, thugs and hoes
All a nigga fuck with is thugs and hoes
2x
