[Verse 1]
He said he would beat it beat it up, beat it beat it up
I told em that what's up, told em that what's up
We connected eyes and he read my lip
I swung my hair and I hit my dip
And I'm coming off the top
He don't know another chick hotter
Flexing on 'em chilling in my Prada
Whole lotta chicks got beef get slaughtered
Money whole lotta, come on
It started just falling all down at once
You was with your friends when you put up  a front
I was trying to get to know you better every time but
Every time I turn my head you switch it up

[Hook]
Boy stop playing with that thing I know you want it
I would love to make a change if you can afford it
You ain't 'bout that life stop fuckin' with me
Tryna act like you ain't checking for me
Don't be mad when another nigga looking at me
I got another 'nother nigga looking at me
If you playing
You know I ain't with them games
You ain't 'bout that life stop fuckin' with me
You ain't 'bout that life stop fuckin' with me

[Interlude]
Why act like you do, call you brand new shoes

[Bridge]
Then I pick you up when she let you down
Then you call me when you are lonely
Then I whip you up let you hit the road then I let you hit the town
The I answer when you are lonely
Then I dust you off then I take you in when she kick you out

[Hook] + [Bridge] (x2)
