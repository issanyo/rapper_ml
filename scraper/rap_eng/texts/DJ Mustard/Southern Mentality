(Hook)
Twerk it, Perk it, Work it, Shake it
This is real Barrio Los Santos song till we spaz it
Rock yo way when you do the bubble butt
Living in LA till I got some fuckin Pizza Hut
Grind on me bitch, I got a vibe on you
When I groove that shit, I will stick on you
Grab it, touch it babe, if you wanna shake it up
It's Odyssey on the DJ, hey mustard turn it up

(Chrous)
Let's go up and down to the hydraulics
Show me your way to do it till we got alcholics
Reppin down to BLS from the Southern Mentality
It's Odyssey, I'll take it to the fantasy

(Verse 1)
Let's start the beat when you shake wit it
Like Miley does the thun thun, twerk it
When I sippin on the Patron, perk it
I'm loving this bad bitch when you go, drop it
Ride it down to the 64 Cadillac
When you yike yo head on my dick
Blacks girl gone wild at the Marriott
Mexicans girls gone wild at the club, come shake that shit
Come on, let's go now when you snap it
Make it nasty wit yo ass, when you grab it
Me and my holmes, we got into laid
Noche de sexo, I got a porno to laid
Paid in full with girls in the Jacuzzi
Let it ride at the hotel, when you get it down on me
Shake it like a salt shaker when you go ride wit it
Odyssey bitches go disney, when you get low wit it

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Let that bitch go Boom Boom Pow
Buenas Noches, I got a new condom mame wow
Shake it like a red nose when you turn around
Round and round with your butt like much pound
Do the chicken shit when you do the starfish
Rock it like a little mermaid, If I had a good wish
Turn the function up, It's about to go down
Up in the club like move bitch to the ground
Pull up to the culo, I feel like the motto
This shit is Yolo, I got a nasty girl from the photo
Grab the beats up when you do the Planet Rock
Do I Look Like I Don't give a fuck
That's what cholas say, when you come and play
It's gettin hot in here, We take it off like Everyday
Booty it up like a motherfuckin skateboard
Hollywood Jumpin to the Cars, I feel like Tom Ford

(Chrous)
