[Intro]
R.I.P to the competion

[Verse 1]
Black City bitch, Black Black City bitch
That girl bust it like the New Jack City bitch
Black pretty bitch Selita Ebanks
Money talks so when I talk I be frank
Yeah she plank, face down ass up
Toast to this real shit put your glass up
Who wanna bet they keep up when I gas up
Act like a safe in your ceiling put you cash up
D Twizzy on the freewizzy riding to that There is No Competition Thrizzy
Party scene I'm the black Charlie Sheen
You fake niggas can't even be real for Halloween cause

[Hook]
Black City bitch Black Black City bitch
Black City bitch Black Black City bitch
Black City bitch Black Black City bitch
I keep cash and I got that black with me bitch

[Verse 2]
Silver emblem two black R's
Who's that in the nice black car
Autopsy came back the results are... cause of death? Bars
Got a killa flow from the llama
Got a killa ho half Columbiana half Dominicana poke out from behind her
Work out a little bit get the rest from her mama (Niceeee)
Black city bitch black out a 0-3
California King Kush black out from OG
You made your death bed now lay in it
The end is here start saying it

[Hook]

[Outro]
R.I.P to the Competition

We can kill you niggas softly if necessary... suckas
