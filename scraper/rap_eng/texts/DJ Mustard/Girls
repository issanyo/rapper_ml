[Intro]
All the girls all go, getting money on your own
Let me see ya get low on the floor
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Verse 1]
Got on my dress, I plan on going in tonight, oh
I'ma give you my best, I was waiting on you, oh (On you)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when I drop drop drop it down, everybody gon' see (Gon' see)
How you like like like it now, all eyes on me (On me)
'Cause the way this thing rolling
And the smoke that you're smoking feels good, oh, oh

[Chorus]
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun, fun
Swinging in the air, show them, show them what you working with
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun, fun
'Cause we don't really care, we don't really care girls just wanna have fun

[Verse 2]
Now see I got your attention, I'ma play up on it (Oh)
In the club and I'm choosing, you gon' be that one tonight, oh (Tonight)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when I drop drop drop it down, everybody gon' see (Gon' see)
How you like like like it now, all eyes on me (On me)
'Cause the way this thing rolling
And the smoke that you're smoking feels good, oh

[Chorus]
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun, fun
Swinging in the air, show them, show them what you working with (Ooh, ooh)
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun, fun
'Cause we don't really care, we don't really care girls just wanna have fun (Girls just wanna have fun)

[Bridge]
All the girls all go, getting money on your own
Let me see ya get low on the floor
'Cause you got a one night pass
Need more in my glass, pour me up, baby, this your song
And it if you do it up real big
Ain't worried 'bout a, turn it up with me all night long
Give it to 'em, oh, oh, oh, give it to 'em

[Chorus]
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun, fun
Swinging in the air, swinging in the air, show them, show them what you working with
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun, fun
'Cause we don't really care, don't care, we don't really care, don't care, girls just wanna have fun (Girls just wanna have fun)
