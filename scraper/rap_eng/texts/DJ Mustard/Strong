[Verse 1]
Smoke one the strong way, roll one the long way
Fine ass bitch, hey, she fucking with my feng shui
Weed all in my eyes, I'm finna cry
Weed in the brownie pies, body high
They trippin' cause my eyes red, I look like a pothead
Y'all niggas monkeys so I'm bout to go bananas
Everything I ride flip flop, yeah, Tropicanas
Put deuces in the Phantoms, west side of Atlanta
I'm the same nigga told you bout salamander sandals
Uh, getting head in a bunkie, rolling up a dutchie
Bitch, I want my number back, your pussy musty
Fuck that bitch, trust me

[Hook]
Man, that weed strong as fuck (x4)
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) (x8)

[Verse 2]
Shawty said she got that burning pack, I am too high to determine that
I'm geeked up off the chief, talking to me, gotta run it back
Charlie Sheen, all that, roll up a ball bat
I'm in the hotel with two lesbians, where the fuck y'all at?
I'm with the coalition, team, pouring up this lean
Drive a nigga bitch cray till she need a Ritalin
Smoking out the back of cars, man, we just a bunch of stars
Black kush up in my cigars, I am high off this planet, Mars

[Hook] (x3)
