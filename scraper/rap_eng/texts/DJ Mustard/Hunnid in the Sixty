[Intro Hook: Franny Arnautou]
They don’t really get it, get it, get it
I would die for my city
And they don’t really get it, get it, get it
I’m going hunnid in the sixty

Yeah they don’t really get it, get it, get it
Only my crew rides with me
And they don’t really get it, get it, get it
I’m going hunnid in the sixty (hunnid in the sixty)

[Verse 1: KING SOL]
Look, I’m 16 ain't no way I'm in a Benz yet
But you’ve probably seen how nobody’s gon prevent that
Play the scene I ain’t even paying up a rent cheque
We about to get it that’s why we ain’t paying them debt

Hopped up in my ride, all I really got’s a permit
That don’t really matter either way I’m gonna work it
Hunnid on the freeway and you know that don’t fall
So my team is always playing that good music King Sol

It’s the good life, and I don’t even need to shout out Kanye
Hunnid in the sixty that’s like ninety dollar entrees
Presidential suite, you can meet me in the lobby
Meanwhile I got haters chasing tryna call they mommies

It ain’t a secret this is only what I dream about
Hitting all the charts, it ain’t really much to scream about
We been out, finding that right sound on the questionnaire
Rollin’ down the freeway I feel like now I’m getting there

[Hook]
Don't get it, get it, get it
I would die for my city
And they don’t really get it, get it, get it
I’m going hunnid in the sixty

Yeah they don’t really get it, get it, get it
Only my crew rides with me
And they don’t really get it, get it, get it
I’m going hunnid in the sixty (hunnid in the sixty)

[Verse 2: KING SOL]
A private escort I’m driving down the freeway
I live on the weekends but you live on the weekdays
Now I got a bunch of leeway starting up the car
Every single day’s a delicacy call that caviar

A superstar, yeah I wanna be rockin’
Every night’s a race I guess you call that Jimmie Johnson
And we ain’t stoppin, I’m looking dapper quick
If you ain’t reppin our team then you should run like Kaepernick

This beat is sick, and this whole track you’re gonna love it
I swear that I’ll be counting stacks, my last name Buffett
We like the Warriors really y’all more like the Nuggets
This life’s a bestseller, yours is left unpublished

I’m digging through the rummage, don’t know where I’m headed
And plus I can’t forget I’ve got a team I owe them credit
So yeah I need them all and thank God none of them betrayed
Cause what’s a team with only Chris Bosh and D Wade?

[Hook]

[Outro: Franny Arnautou]
Don't get it, get it, get it
Don't get it, get it, get it
They don't get it, get it, get it
They don't get it, get it, get it (hunnid in the sixty)

Don't get it, get it, get it
Don't get it, get it, get it
They don't get it, get it, get it
They don't get it, get it, get it

(hu-hu-hu-hunnid in the sixty)
