Yeah
I know you've been hoping shit would change, yeah
I know you've been acting kinda strange, I know
I know you think bitches gon' tempt me, think they gon' tempt me
But you should know I ain't a sucker for temptation
We ain't had no cash but I gotta thank you girl cause you've just been so patient
Tryna pave the way, get it cracking
Just tryna make you happy, but you just ain't reacting
Desperation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

Praying, praying, praying like you just committed treason
Praying for some motherfucking freedom
Praying that the struggle would start easing
Dealing with my downfalls and all my fucking demons
I beg em to stop but they just keep on screaming
Cause I'm causing you pain
When they calling my name
Telling me that it's a part of the fucking game
Part of the fame
Pardon my flames cause I just spit fire and vomit grenades
Somebody just called the firebregade
They can't tell me shit like they playing sherades, uh
Me, Myself and I ain't one and the same
"Nah, nah, nah, nah"
Me just went insane and Myself is to blame
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
I has gone derranged, now we're all astranged
Cause deep down inside we are all afraid
Cause I know you've been thinking bout leaving
"Yeah"
I know you've been sick of fucking grieving
But I thought I was somebody that you could still believe in
I guess this whole time I was fucking dreaming
You were being polite and it was so decieving

I know you've been hoping shit would change, yeah
I know you've been acting kinda strange, yeah
I know you think bitches gon' tempt me, think they gon' tempt me
But you should know I ain't a sucker for temptation
We ain't had no cash but I gotta thank you girl cause you've just been so patient
Tryna pave the way, get it cracking
Just tryna make you happy, but you just ain't reacting
Desperation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been
