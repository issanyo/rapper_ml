[Hook]
Put my whole city on
Now I got the whole West
More money, more problems
Smoke good weed to lower the stress
Nothin' less, nothin' less
I just want the top, nothin' less
Nothin' less, nothin' less
I just want the top, nothin' less

[Verse 1]
I just made a play, I need a hundred K
In the studio I do a song a day
Every now and then I gotta take a break
I need a Rihanna, Selita Ebanks
I own a company, employ the ones that run with me
Turnin' up in this business, I give 'em Hell 'til they're done with me
Countin' money, puffin' trees, higher than the clouds
Livin' in the fast lane, never slowin' down
Tell me what you stand for, what you're all about
Niggas tryna beef, rather have a cash cow
Up all night, hustle 'til I pass out
Focused on my mission, got the plan mapped out
Me and all my niggas Heart Break, Shmop Boyz
If it ain't about money then you know we ain't for it
Stupid, disrespectful, take a shit up in your toilet
I don't think you really want it, flow sicker than ebola

[Hook]
Put my whole city on
Now I got the whole West
More money, more problems
Smoke good weed to lower the stress
Nothin' less, nothin' less
I just want the top, nothin' less
Nothin' less, nothin' less
I just want the top, nothin' less

[Verse 2]
The boy is on a campaign
If you work hard for it then it can't fade
When it comes down to it, it's a few things
God, family and HBK gang
We don't give a fuck, we just wanna live it up
One time for the Bay, let me give it up
Two things: can't stop and I can't hate
Every day I'm eatin', need a full plate
Said I'm on the grind, can't waste time
If you want the top, it's gon' take time
Swagged out, this that shit you can't buy
Niggas wanna play then it's bang time
And I ain't even gotta do much
Curry in the 4th, man, too clutch
Good in every hood like a tune-up
Only speak up when you bring Su up

Nothin' less, nothin' less
I just want the top, nothin' less
