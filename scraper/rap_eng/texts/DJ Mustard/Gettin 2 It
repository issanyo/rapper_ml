[Verse 1 : Teecee4800]
Driving real fast down Washington

I don't want shit I don't need shit
If I have my hand out then I smacked a bitch
Aye! Told her get it off the floor
Use to getting fast nigga in and out the door
Niggas's all talk all square all show

Stay with three stacks like Andre
Dunk on a nigga like Andre
Smoking big weed everyday
I'm with Ty so he sipping on that bomb bay uh
Bad Puerto Rican bitches
But they ain't never get my riches


[Hook : Teecee4800]
I take my time and I think I need about twenty racks in one week
You take your time you always sleep
You ain't got no money broke nigga you cheap
Tell me how you gettin' to it
Tell me how you gettin' to it

[Hook : Teecee4800]

[Verse 3 : RJ]
Look
I pull up, crack the whole dice game
Better hit the point like a sniper aye
Got it out the mud, I was OT
Had a drum way before I had a gold teeth
Hoo, that's no lie I promess
Cross my heart and crucified, I'm honest
Talk is talk it's for fake shots, like botox
When niggas play both sides you check them like phone pass
It's no matter how you gon' ride
That you gotta get dough
[?]
Niggas feel I'm on the hill of the [?]
Got rubberbands around these bills and my rubbers
[?]


[Hook : Teecee4800]

Tell me how you gettin' to it
