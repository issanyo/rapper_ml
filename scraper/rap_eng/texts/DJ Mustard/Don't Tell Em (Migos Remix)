[Intro: YG]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Know you say you down with it
Won’t tell em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I’m from Chicago
I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it (in it)
Nobody take me out tho
You got gifts bring em down the south pole
Marathon doll gon' puttin' miles
Don’t you worry bout it might gon' work it out
Only is you got me feeling like this oohh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right, right, right, right, right

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Don't tell 'em that I beat it up like fight night
But she did tell me that you're small like a Mike & Ike
Too much information, baby, you ain't gotta tell me
But everybody know that she selfish
Pull up in Ferraris, my bitch rockin' Versace
They already know we fuckin', you ain't gotta hide it
Nobody can find us, we coolin' on islands
You ain't gotta tell him that I got you outta Follies
When I pulled up on her, you know she get in
She ain't know that I'm handsome and wealthy
House on a hill, got a mansion, come live
Just don't tell nobody how you got in

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Beat it up, don't eat it up, Bentley Mulsanne I speed it up
Want you to travel around the globe with me, no Expedia
Rockin' a mink chinchilla, fox fur, put in my interior
Smokin' hookah with Everclear, takin' a trip to Delaware
Maison Margiela, I shop any weather
My girl wanna be a Giuseppe stepper
Peter Piper, he done piped the pepper
I'm Michael Phelps, won a gold medal
Hit it with the left then hit it with the right
Knockout just call me Mayweather
So many Benjamins on me
Might mistake me for a bank teller

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

[Verse 4: Offset]
I'm dabbin' in Maison Margielas, don't tell 'em they might get jealous
Her forehead on my pelvis, I don't cuff 'em, I don't settle
You a champion, you deserve a gold medal
Ain't got time on my schedule, gotta go get the cheddar
You ain't got time to be worried 'bout them
Kissin' all over you, rubbin' your hip
I got the Tiffany diamonds all up in your ear
Smackin' your booty while I'm hittin' it from the rear
Smackin' a secret, your pussy be drippin' and leakin'
I did a show I cannot leave it, fuck her and then I delete it
Victoria, she keepin' a secret, don't tell 'em that, no
My diamonds, they cold, anemic, and I can't front, no
I'm finished, you know I need her

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
