Do yo thang girl, what, what, do yo thang girl, do yo
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Hook: Marcus Moody]
Got a girl from the bull and she get low
First touch down from the in out
YSL heels on but she no saint
They be yellin' who that? When the booty shake
Every time I do it it's a movie
Fuck hoes, no love for a groupie
I've been getting money since a Juve
Got a nigga rappin' like Juve
Juve, juve
I've been getting money since juve
Juve, juve
Got a nigga rappin' like juve

[Verse 1: Marcus Moody]
Girl it's you with all that ass, huh?
Girl it's you with all that cash, huh?
And you ain't doin too bad, huh?
You got a [?], huh?
You ain't be up in no cab, huh?
Call an [?] for that ass, huh?
You're the leader of the pack, huh?
You be chillin' in the back, huh?
Them niggas dont know how to act , huh?
But know I came with them stacks, huh?
You told the dude that you wanna hit his track ,huh?

[Hook]

[Bridge: Marcus Moody]
Girl you look good, won't you back that ass up?
Youre a fine motherfucker won't you back that ass up?
Call me big daddy when you back that ass up
Girl, who is you playin' with, back that ass up


[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]

Well girl I'm tryna know ya
What I gotta do?
You are from California, the way that booty move
Now she wanna sex with me
Love the way that shawty put that ass on me
Damn, I feel like she gonna put the hex on me
If this your girl then she might be your ex-homie, yea
