[Intro: AKAFrank]
Yeah, it's AKA, AKA, AKA
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Verse 1: AKAFrank]
Money fast like a Rari
Leave your man, don't be sorry
Got a ass like Nick and she think she a Barbie
Just say you're coming with Frank
My bank straight a complaint
She high on my list, but I don't know where she rank
I said the head be the greatest, and the pussy a fool
She know my rules and principles, I took her to school
A real one, a jealous bitch, she a kill one
Walk up in the spot like she the owner of the building
I hate to hit it and quit it, but I gotta go
We vamanos, then stick to adios, then adios
She know my name, say my shit bang like the set
Rex Ryan, coach him up then I jet
Sit back, if you make it clap then you'll get these stacks
And if you can't, then your ass gotta get back
I shine when it's pitch black, better have your bitch back
She all on me, don't forget that

[Hook: London]
Back it up, drop it down on a real one
Show me you a real one
I got stacks full of cash I can peel on you
Show me you a real one
You a real one
Baby, you a real one
You a real one
Baby, you a real one

[Verse 2: London]
Drop it on me
Drop that shit like it's hot like the suvi
And the hot boys back in the 90's
When we used to freak
Ooh, drop it some more
Keep dropping it like you're scrubbing the floor
Keep dropping it, baby, 'til I get sore
And can't take no more
Baby, baby don't stop
Girl, your body so hot
You got me melting on you
I feel like spending on you and I don't even trip
So baby is it your spot?
Or baby is it my spot?
Cause you know just what I want and
The way you dancing on me, I think we need to dip

[Hook: London]
Back it up, drop it down on a real one
Show me you a real one
I got stacks full of cash I can peel on you
Show me you a real one
You a real one
Baby, you a real one
You a real one
Baby, you a real one

[Verse 3: AKAFrank]
She like I am so real
I'm damn near endangered
Talk like I know her, then I am a stranger
She smelling money, it's on me and she know that I got it
I tell her she is the product, and how we gon' make a profit
Top down and she topless
Drive her crazy, don't stop it
Cause I'm making cash money, all these niggas [?]
Running out of options, I pass her like Stockton
Your man like the feds, I know his ass watching
I'ma be looking fresh as hell
Splashing in Pink Dolphin, ready to set sail
Your money looking pale, I'm doper than the scale
You knock the hoe down, I post bail
Time is money and I know she can tell
She got big dreams, she be wishing in the well
Get the number, fuck might call her [?]
Thank you for the night, mine has been to real
Get at it

[Hook: London]
Back it up, drop it down on a real one
Show me you a real one
I got stacks full of cash I can peel on you
Show me you a real one
You a real one
Baby, you a real one
You a real one
Baby, you a real one
Back it up, drop it down on a real one
Show me you a real one
I got stacks full of cash I can peel on you
Show me you a real one
You a real one
Baby, you a real one
You a real one
Baby, you a real one
