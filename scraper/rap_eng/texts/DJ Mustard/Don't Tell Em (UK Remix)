Mustard on the beat, ho

[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, touchin' like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Know you say you down with it
Won’t tell em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I’m from Chicago, I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it (in it)
Nobody take me out though
You got gifts bring em down the south pole
Marathon doll gon' puttin' miles
Don’t you worry bout it might gon' work it out

[Verse 2: Konan]
Jumped out the CL,  she told me keep in on the dl
Started on the TL, now she's in the DM's giving me the details
I'm a OG bitch you guessed it
Said she wants ice cream for breakfast
Can't stop staring at my necklace
Now she's in my bed watching Netflix (behave)
Take a break then I'm right back in
Big batty girl that's my pattern
Weed smoke on my jumper
That's what I call high fashion

[Hook]

Body like the summer, touchin' like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

[Verse 3: Krept]
Started with a "hey, nice to meet you"
Now I'm with your bae try and see through
Girl, I need a preview
Getting bitches undercover nigga GQ
Go all night, team no sleep
Put it so far in, team so deep
The kiss will make your day (what else?)
But this dick will make your whole week
Yeah, I'ma fire now
Put in on my square, I'ma buy a round
Says she doesn't do one night stands
I said that's cool, we'll be lying down
She knows I'm prepared for the kid
We've just come, I'm here for the women
I want brain if you crash at mine
That's a head on collision

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Only you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why, why
Loving and grabbing the rhythm of the hips
That's right, right, right, right, right
