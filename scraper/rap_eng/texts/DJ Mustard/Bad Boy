[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Shawty got potential, but he don't need a sponsor
You should see his goons, more niggas than a concert
Body like Teyana, stomach lookin' proper
Eyes half closed cause he smokin' on that ganja
Hol' up, hol' up
Hard denims and cardigans, they all rugby
He my lil bad boy, Sean Puffy
Givin' me stacks, a rack T take that
Smokin on that James Brown, this the payback
I be his hood girl, I put that grind in him
So inked up I can write my rhymes with 'em
He give me all of his, but let me roll with mine
And the shoes spiked up like a porcupine
He love my Harlem ass, the way my swag pop
A real bad bitch, never needed ass shots
Two door coupe, all-white, whole thang
And when I see him I'm like honey in that cocaine

[Chorus]
Bad boy, real when I need a wrap
And his only competition is the IRS
Bad boy, a real one, I need that
And his only competition is the IRS
Make money money, make money money money
(Make money money, make money money money)
Now everybody say
Take money money, take money money money
(Take money money, take money money money)
IRS

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Yo, well he's a bad boy, but it feels good though
I'm out rappin', while he chillin' in the hood, yo
All the girls want the money, I don't need shit
'Cause I can do my own work on some queen shit
He know he hot shit, money in his pockets
Swag out the world, they see him and he's a topic
He beat the kitty up, a dog like YG
Them Jordan's on fire, jewels icy (ugh)
Him stupid is not likely
'Cause all my guys hood smart, I like 'em just like me
Now we down at the club with some weed smoke (weed smoke)
And a G knows a G 'cause a G knows
Hear them others say somethin', you just awesome
Bonnie and Clyde through the gang cause we bossin'
His motto 'Thug Life,' he run with them bad toys
But it's all good, I told you he's a he's a, he's a

[Chorus]
Bad boy, real when I need a wrap
And his only competition is the IRS
Bad boy, a real one, I need that
And his only competition is the IRS
Make money money, make money money money
(Make money money, make money money money)
Now everybody say
Take money money, take money money money
(Take money money, take money money money)
IRS

[Outro: Teyana & Honey Cocaine]
He my lil bad boy, bad boy
Bad boy, bad boy
Bad boy, bad boy
He my lil bad boy, bad boy
Bad boy, bad boy
Bad boy, bad boy
Hold up
Well he's a bad boy, but it feels good though
Good though, good though, good though, good though
Well he's a bad boy, but it feels good though
Good though, good though, good though, good though
