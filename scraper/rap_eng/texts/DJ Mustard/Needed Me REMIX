[Verse 1: Don Trip]
I just got a text from my old lady say she leaving me
And silly me I thought she needed me
But you got to do better than the ???
Who am I fooling, you knew I was using you
Fuck am I saying, this shit ain't new to you
This shit ain't news to you
I was just cruisin' through
Sooner or later I'll pay for misusing you
What goes around, comes back around
Baby I get it, karma is a hoola hoop
I ain't gon' change, I'm out of super glue
Other words, ain't no fixing me
I can't be tamed, the try is insane
Baby there ain't no mystery
I just want a girl who will fix me supper
So I can come home and pretend I love her
Pretend I was not just fucking some girl
Pretend I do not have a stash full of rubbers
Those ain't mine, hold up, you know what
Jermaine must have left that shit in my car
But she's not stupid, she might need sutures
To doctor the bruises I left on her heart
And I be back in the bitch DM
And she'll be at my room like 9 PM
Asking me a million questions bout my BM
Put that bitch to sleep, Tylenol PM
Wake up, I'm dreaming ??? gone
No French Toast this morning but
I made sure I killed that cat
Shit I caught myself giving you some time for more

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I never been on my own until I looked at my phone (Damn who dat?)
Seen that smile on your face look like I been replaced
Guess you got tired of being patient
Thought cuz you stayed where I live and I paid all the bills you weren't going nowhere
Desensitized to how I made you feel
How were you supposed to know that I cared (Yea)
I get it now, hindsight, 20/20, reconcile, 50/50
Hard to believe that you really quittin'
Look I really miss you, scrollin' through pictures just reminiscin
Too many bitches and none of em beneficial
I admit, just one of my many issues
Still want to work on my friendship with you
Still want to start a ??? with you
So let me get out of my feelings first
Dealing with you is the bigger picture
I was in disbelief now I see it's true
I guess we are through
I wouldn't be here singing for you
Feeling complete, I needed you

[Rihanna:]
You needed me

[Starlito:]
You weren't just another body on the thot list
Now you got my phone number on the block list
How did it come to this, I got my number switched
Tried calling again, calling your mama, calling your job, calling your friends
Calling it quits, I never thought it would end
Damn, guess you really ain't fucking with me
