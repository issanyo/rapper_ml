[Hook: Tyga]
On this baking soda
Drop a four in the pot, make an ounce to a rock
Put it to your lip
On this boiling water, Heavy on the block
Hit the strips, set up shops, Stayed with a Glock
On this Arm & Hammer
Chopper with a bandana, make a nigga ass shake, Grip handle
All my shit crack nigga, crack nigga
All my shit crack nigga, crack nigga

[Verse 1: Plies]
All I need is baking soda
And the fork, and a scale
Now let's hope that these niggas don't tell
All I need a bad bitch
Who will suck me on the road
So I don't fall asleep driving with the dope
I'mma tell you what I don't need
And that's some nigga in my business
When I go to cop i don't take them with me
That's a lesson that I did learn
And the crackers get behind you
Don't you turn off, nigga they will pull you
One thing that I do know, if they ask
And they search you and your car
You better tell them "hell no!"
If my lawyer ain't with me, Motherfucker ain't talking
I got a motherfucking pistol in my pocket
If I get another quaalude
She will love me in the morning
This Liquor got me feeling like I'm Tony
Take a look at the bad guy
Motherfucker don't want that
I ain't never crossed a nigga who didn't have it coming
I swear!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Plies]
You gotta to watch a nigga out here
They put cut on the otta
We done sold you something that won't turn over
Hit y'all with a flim flam
He went and fuck up your cash
Now you're looking for a nigga with your mask
And the games that I don't play
Took a loss in a minute
Nigga trapping a nigga ass, gotta feel it
I ain't spared nobody, nobody
I ain't spared nobody, nobody
Keep a head on the swivellater
Shit is got real creep
Everybody out here tryna eat
The Young nigga wylin' at em'
See, I'm wylin' right with em'
When it come to the cash I feel them
I ain't taking no loses
Everything gotta count
Breaking mine all down to the ounce
All I need is a big lick, big chain
Big bank, this year all i'm doing is big things
