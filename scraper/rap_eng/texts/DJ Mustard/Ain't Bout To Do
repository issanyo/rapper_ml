[Hook: Diggy Simmons]
Ain't bout to do
I'ma do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
I'ma do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
Let me do what your boyfriend
Just ain't bout to do
What he won't do

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
What he ain't gotta do
Is put a bow on a pink 911
And it ain't got a roof
Throw you the keys and you're telling all your girls
Girl ain't he the truth, yeah
That's why you need to go ahead, toss the metal
Toss them up the deuce (Gonna toss em up the deuce)
Gonna toss em up the deuce (Deuce, deuce, deuce)
And what I ain't tryina do
Is tell you're messing with a lame nigga
Guess we ain't the same kind of dude
Pick a spot on the map
Tell the pilot longitude, latitude
And she give a nigga lip but she never gimme no attitude
She donâ€™t give me no attitude

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Montana!
Ain't not true drop the half of mil on the car
Drop the top came out the roof
Waiting in the booth, LeBron in the V
We going back to he
She ain't bout to do
Shut Diggy I never win no figgy
I might pull up with Iggy, I might pull up with Nicki, ha
I said trick you guessing, courtside, got your chick four core pressin'
I think I met her at Griffin
Hope I ain't never gotta clip her like Griffin
He ain't spending on, the rarry on your arm
Bonita apple bomb, you gotta put me on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Diggy Simmons]
What he ain't bout to do
What he ain't gonna do
Is treat you how you wanna
And what I ain't bout to do
Nah, darling you, say that I'ma do it, I'm gonna
Let me change up your do
Change your winter into summer
Where you wanna go we can go, no, no, no
Girl we can go, nah
Come and see with the other side looks like
Buy you thangs that your other guy couldn't buy
If he only knew I bet he wouldn't like
Send that nigga text tell him goodnight
Young and independent
Show you thangs and I'm younger than your nigga
Yeah this could be for you
Do all the things that he ain't bout to do
