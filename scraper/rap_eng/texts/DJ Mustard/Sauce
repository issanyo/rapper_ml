[Verse 1]
We ain't even been talkin' for a minute yet
And I already got you elevated
You don't know if I'm a saint or a sinner yet
But you already singin' Ella praises
If we're out for the night and you're by my side
Don't get emotional
'Cause niggas gon' slide wit' you in my ride
So I rather let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I'm good without you, I'm fuckin' with you regardless
And if that's gon' hurt you, least you can say is I'm honest
Good things don't always get to you the way that you want it
I'm good without you but I'm fuckin' with you regardless

[Chorus]
So tell me if it gets too much
Tell me if you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool if
There's too much sauce in the food for you
Sorry that you can't keep up
You're lookin' like you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool
It's just too much sauce in the food for you

[Post-Chorus]
Too much sauce
I got too much sauce, sauce

[Verse 2]
Don't I still pull up when you need it?
I gotta know you can deal with it (Stop)
Readin' through the lines, boy, you're showin' (Stop)
Playin' with your mind, 'bout to blow it
It takes a strong man, strong shoulders
You gotta level up if you want this (Stop)
Chewin' with you mouth wide open
Like you can't see

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I'm good without you, I'm fuckin' with you regardless
And if that's gon' hurt you, least you can say is I'm honest
Good things don't always get to you the way that you want it
I'm good without you but I'm fuckin' with you regardless

[Chorus]
So tell me if it gets too much
Tell me if you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool if
There's too much sauce in the food for you (Too much)
Sorry that you can't keep up
You're looking like you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool
It's just too much sauce in the food for you

[Bridge]
Too much sauce
Know what to do with it, you know what to do with it
I got too much sauce
Know what to do with it, you know what to do with it
Can't hang, can't hang with a boss
Know what to do with it, you know what to do with it
I got too much sauce
Know what to do with it, you know what to do with it

Too much sauce
(Right, right, right, yeah, right, damn right)
I got too much sauce
(Right, right, right, yeah, right, damn right)
Can't hang, can't hang with a boss
(Right, right, right, yeah, right, damn right)
I got too much sauce
(Right, right, right, yeah, right, damn right)

[Outro: Spoken Word]
L: Lust
Four letters like love, but less precious
More like electric veins running fast than frenzy my heart, make me crave and act restless
So infectious
