[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Verse 1]
Roll with it all you gotta do is roll with it
Let me into your system baby yeah, roll with it
Said I got what you missing
You ain't gotta go get it when I pull up with that work for you baby come get it

[Pre-Chorus]
You been on my mind ever since
Need to relax sit back and let it sink
Stimulate our minds away in every kind of way
And blow the stress away ain't gotta think

[Chorus]
Let's take a trip up to the island and just lay up
A private flight up for the night gon' take us way up
Just the two of us no one else invited
Baby jump right in
Let's take a trip up to the island and just lay up
Said baby you know I know how to take us way up
Just the two of us no one else invited
Baby jump right in

[Verse 2]
But go slow with it get a hold in it
Don't you let me take control in it
Take control in it
Said you know I got that dope and the shit that go with it
Treat my body like a boat baby flow in it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You been on my mind ever since
Need to relax sit back and let it sink
Stimulate our minds away in every kind of way
Come blow your stress away ain't gotta think

[Chorus]
Let's take a trip up to the island and just lay up
A private flight up for the night gon' take us way up
Just the two of us no one else invited
Baby jump right in
Let's take a trip up to the island and just lay up
Said baby you know I know how to take us way up
Just the two of us no one else invited
Baby jump right in

[Bridge]
No rules no plans this is all for us
Put your phone down boy ain't time to chill
Cause I want you to, work up on this
Turn up on this, late nights early morning
Trip out to the island and just lay up
Take a min out the game you the player
Unravel me boy all these layers
And we go at it again an hour later

[Chorus]
Let's take a trip up to the island and just lay up, lay up
A private flight up for the night gon' take us way up, way up
Just the two of us no one else invited
Baby jump right in
Let's take a trip up to the island and just lay up, lay up
Said baby you know I know how to take us way up, way up
Just the two of us no one else invited
Baby jump right in

[Outro]
Just when I thought I couldn't love again, you changed me
