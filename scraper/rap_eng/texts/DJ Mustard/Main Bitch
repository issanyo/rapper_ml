[Intro]
Mustard on the beat ho!

[Hook]
Tell my homies about my side bitch
Tell my side bitch bout my main bitch
I don't tell my main bitch shit
Main bitch know my government
Where the money sent
She a cut a bitch don't you tell my main bitch shit
Shown up, shown up, shown up, don't ever tell my main bitch shit
Shown up, shown up, shown up, so don't you tell my main bitch

[Verse 1]
Shit always smiles when I'm pulling up
Fuck the crowd when it's you, it's us
You was down it was pulling us
I don't be with you enough
Tell these side hoes choosing us
Hope to God they don't ruin us
I'ma hit the jeweler
Bitch drop a dime and I'ma do the drugs
Flood the pinky like I do the rest
Show the homie love
Got my main bitch showing up
Showing out better show me some
What that showmanship like
I took you down, but you owe me for life
I accept all my wrongs when I'm wrong if you're right
But it ain't an entree without the sides to suffice
Oh I could never tell my main bitch this

[Hook]
Tell my homies about my side bitch
Tell my side bitch bout my main bitch
I don't tell my main bitch shit
Main bitch know my government
Where the money sent
She a cut a bitch don't you tell my main bitch shit
Shown up, shown up, shown up, don't ever tell my main bitch shit
Shown up, shown up, shown up, so don't you tell my main bitch

[Verse 2]
Girl I don't need a tripping less we live in the Caribbean
I don't a sober living club in mile high
She my number uno when it's count time
Top ramen noodles on the chow line
The Rollie say it's bout time
The foreign say leave it mine
Don't want to be in Cedar Sinai
I feed her feed her mouth wide
Ya wifies legs spread like a house fire
Yea I'ma share the bed but the house mine yea
Wifie like the feds when I'm outside yea
Got me looking 'round so if I took you down bitch you owe me for life
But it ain't an entree without the sides to suffice
Oh I could never tell my main bitch this

[Hook]
Tell my homies about my side bitch
Tell my side bitch bout my main bitch
I don't tell my main bitch shit
Main bitch know my government
Where the money sent
She a cut a bitch don't you tell my main bitch shit
Shown up, shown up, shown up, don't ever tell my main bitch shit
Shown up, shown up, shown up, so don't you tell my main bitch

[Outro]
Don't tell my main
My main bitch shit
Shit
Just know my side bitch know who I claim
Like what's on your conscience go to your grave
Though all my content she can't obtain
I remain the same, you my main thing
I won't change a little bit
Never told my main bitch this
Oh I could never tell my main bitch this
My main bitch this
