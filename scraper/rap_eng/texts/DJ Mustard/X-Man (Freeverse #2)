[Intro]
Ah hah
Yeah
Webby
Let's Go

[Verse 1]

See I'm a motherfucker killing it and doing my thang
For years now
What you think that Webby is new to the game?
Giving y'all the real shit, smoking beautiful strains
And got the fans heads bobbing till they bruising they brains
Looking like Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, yes
At the Roxbury rolling with chicks in spandex
I'm bout to breakthrough so fix the damn nets
Before this Great White done bit your damn neck
Cuz I, I was fresh to death back in the high chair
Velcro stride rights, always had a nice pair
Now it's Nike Airs, tied tight, spittin on the mic
Kill em in Bermuda with a time share
With a fat butt model bitch
Who don't even think twice when she swallows it
So just, respect my conglomerate
It's Homegrown music group we on our shit (they mad)
Cuz they hear about the cash we've got
And yeah we eatin good like Action Bronson
With A.D.D. I'm distracted often
But they know that when I step up in the lab it's poppin
Watching kids hoppin on the fad and jockin
Now everybody raps man that's the problem
But steppin to Webby should be your last of options
You don't want no bad blood, Magic Johnson
Webby's sicker than a virus
Ain't nobody up in this motherfucker should try this
Spittin fly shit
And got the kids actin up like they were parented by Billy Ray Cyrus
I got the young white girls all twerkin'
While they parents back home think they still virgins
Got 3rd graders running around cursing
Filling up Dasani bottles with their dad's bourbon
And I stay swervin' Rocking and right (right)
Step up on the scene, hat cocked to the right
Eyes bloodshot from the pot and the pipe
Words slurred, Drinkin' my Ciroc with a Sprite
They sayin, "Fuck Webby he just raps about drugs
And the booze that he drinks and the girls that he fucks."
But uh, I just rap about the things that I love
The things I do, while you're at home on Pornhub
You asking people's A/S/L in chat rooms
While I'm out on the town all night like raccoons
Blowing up taking a match to gas fumes
I'm bad news, crazy, and covered in tattoos!

[Hook]

And I do not give not one single fuck
So bitch just suck my dick
And that's it (But you know that I be killin em)
I do not care what y'all think of me
Because I'm too high to give a shit
And that's it

[Verse 2]

So what's new motherfucker I be cocky and driven
So any obstacle given
I'm Tom Cruise up in this bitch, there's no Impossible Mission
Any rapper dissing, I'm like "yo you gotta be kidding"
I'm laughing at you at the crib while eatin pasta and chicken
And it's parmesan crusted, that's the way I does it
Walking around blacked out, pissing up in public
Pound sign Who Cares (Cares) I just say "Fuck It"
My fucking lawyer bills are already over my budget
But my attorney is a beast in the courtroom
He got me off once, he gon get me off more soon
Lock me up at 9 AM
I'll be out before noon
Hungry motherfucker eating food right off of your spoon
Dope as any other rapper times two
Getting so high all I write is haikus
Leavin crews injured, I'm the new Simba
Get up on the beat and cut it up, Fruit Ninja
Drop that ass down dr-drop that ass down
Calling up my dealer and I copped the last pound
Rollin up that headband while I'm into kegstands
Superpowers when I'm on the mic, X-Man

[Outro]
Ya
I'm like motherfucking Wolverine, Collossus, and Gambit
All rolled up into one motherfucker
HomeGrown
We here man
Freeverse Series (Ya)
So suck my dick
