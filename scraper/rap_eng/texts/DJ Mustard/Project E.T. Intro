[Intro: Future]
DJ Esco the Coolest DJ on the Planet

[Excerpts]
Its time to find the answer to search for life beyond earth, we are life, we are intelligent, we must know
The military and the government wants you to believe that theres nothing to this topic
How do we know this by the way? Well we know it by paying attention
Many countries know about the extraterrestrial existence
Could it be a UFO? Possibly, they’re actually saying potentially
I don’t have a whole lot of time, Okay okay well what we’re thinking of as aliens They, they are extra dimensional beings, they are not what they claim to be
Escomo, the coolest DJ in the world
Mexican Air Force pilots, capturing on tape whats said to be 11, 11 UFO’s
Theres definitely something out there, the question is have they come here
Theres a midland man making a claim about the extraterrestrial

[DJ Esco]
I remember when I first got locked up in prison, in Dubai
I was just lookin’ around and I was like, I was a alien, a Escoterrestrial
It was like a real alien in there

[Excerpt]
Then its the best evidence to date, that extra terrestrial visitors are indeed engaging our planet
Is E.T. gonna be in my backyard when I get home tonight?
