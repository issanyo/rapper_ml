We rock Yale hats and never went to Yale
We went to Gateway, Southern or went to jail
And tears just fall into the pale
So if you kick the bucket I got no more in my well
Still tryna bring back the jersey with the tail
Know that green and blue Whale
Ron Francis used to sail-
And in my town we used to have the Ravens
Now the addicts just crash when the rave ends
Lemme put it into other terms, Laymens
Yall grow beards cuz your too lazy for shavin’
Like where the fuck is the work ethic?
Right
You just wanna trend on Twitter
What the fuck did you do beside get bent on liquor?
I heard your record and it’s hot trash
If I threw it out the sun roof I woulda gotten tickets cuz I littered
That’s why they’re bitter I can see it in your faces
Too scared to smile like they just got braces
And I killed em by being silent
You know the real ones move in silence
And the rest of em gotta buy it
Kool-Aid, Tryna find those A&Rs to pay
I dominated my league like Juve
That was off that top, that’s tupay
You should kill your self that’s roulette
Bang






Saw a commercial for a funeral home
And I was surprised that you weren't in it
Ironic they suspected- I was the one who wasn't livin
That car crash the greatest thing that ever happened
I was plotting your execution while I was laid up on my mattress
I'd rather be a dead body than a washup
Honestly it's a toss up
If I ain't Daddy Warbucks
At least I'm getting my call up
I been in the minor leagues playing to little crowds
Knocking em out the park on the pitches I figured out
Just replay my catalog I've always been the shit on it
I'm bout to kill the game U can all go Mookie bett on it
I have a wish list -
It starts with "Suck my dick bitch"
And that directed at who ever told me different
Of anything I believed
Anything I've conceived
The holy trinity told me sacrifice come in 3s
You're now listening to symposiums
Please stop your shit
Please sip Imodium
See I had no iodine for salt in the wound
But I have risen like his corpse from a tomb
Happy EASTER
For all of U who "passed over" me -know Im feasting
U should look to me if you need something to believe in
Lemme coach you
They say lemme toast you
Fuck em I ain't on a yacht like some boat shoes
I'm just in my own zone - riding on my own wave
And lately I have not experienced a slow day
I don't know how to roll jays
I don't need that Flo naze
Your girl only looks good from a distance she's a Monet
I been plotting what it can be
I don't need a girl I need a Grammy
