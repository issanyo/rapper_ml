[Interlude: Drakeo]
Mr. Big Bank Boto, I need all my chilli sweetheart
The Stinc leader, the head bopper
The spring cleaning
Plain’s no sin thing Shirley
Everything is regular on my end
Chilli, Bow Wow, Mr. Pops on my night sheet
Off all this drank, I know I got a problem
Mud walking my ass in Neimans
We made this shit fashionable
Walking in my Christians
Cause Jesus died for ‘em
Shit, you know us, the homewreckers
The whip crashers, that's regular
We do anything, anything, anything
For the uchies
