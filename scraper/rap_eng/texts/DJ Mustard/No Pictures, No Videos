[Chorus]
Pull up where I'm at, we chilling you laugh
Your secrets are safe with me
All that sneaking your snaps and hiding your flash
It won't get away, I won't put no trust into her
Just keep your phone in your purse
Your purse in this draw, your shit gon' be locked and safe
I won't put no trust into her (no video, videos)
Just keep your phone in your purse
Your purse in this draw, your shit gon' be locked and safe
I won't put no trust into her (video, video)

[Verse 1]
I ain't doing bitches, only doing sistas
I ain't doing videos unless it mo spits
I maneuver in and out, give you motion sickness
Pimping today I ain't got time for y'all and suspense
A get some paper on a lie like it's some powder with it
I tell a hater do your job, at least come with it
I'm on the radar, on the rise for some new beginnings
See first it's Faded, then it's Vinyl and GQ edition
A nigga gotta pick and choose just to know this whip
Be outcha looking like a fool, 'cause you don't know your limb
First thing is first, you should know we're just chilling
Just play it cool, cause that's way more appealing
Trust me it's worth it, i'll wait if you with it
Know you ain't feel this way in a minute, I get it
I kill it!

[Chorus]
Pull up where I'm at, we chilling you laugh
Your secrets are safe with me
All that sneaking your snaps and hiding your flash
It won't get away, I won't put no trust into her
Just keep your phone in your purse
Your purse in this draw, your shit gon' be locked and safe
I won't put no trust into her (no video, videos)
I won't put no trust into her, no trusting of her
No trust in no words you say to me

[Verse 2]
So just keep your phone in your purse
Don't need your phone to be turned
You don't need no words to be heard
You're lost in your song like a verse
You know it get worse when you're thirsty
Cut that shit off like it's surgery
I'm getting rich and discerning
You stealing pics with your Sherman's
That's like tempting to a burglar
We gon' to finish this early, I show no mercy
Before you serve me I see your ulterior motives
You've got some media dirt in your photos
Miss me with all that getting caught in the moment and
Tuck in your phone once I noticed, you bogus
I'm over this

[Chorus]
Pull up where I'm at, we chilling you laugh
Your secrets are safe with me
All that sneaking your snaps and hiding your flash
It won't get away, I won't put no trust into her
Just keep your phone in your purse
Your purse in this draw, your shit gon' be locked and safe
I won't put no trust into her (no video, videos)
Just keep your phone in your purse
Your purse in this draw, your shit gon' be locked and safe
I won't put no trust into her (no video, videos)
Just keep your phone in your purse
Your purse in this draw, your shit gon' be locked and safe
I won't put no trust into her (no video, videos)
Just keep your phone in your purse
Your purse in this draw, your shit gon' be locked and safe with me
Damn video, video...
