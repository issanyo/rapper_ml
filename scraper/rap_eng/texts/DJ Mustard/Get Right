[Intro]
Uh na na na na, yeah
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Verse 1]
They say the way that is supposed to be
The same the way that is supposed to go
But I’m sure you already know
And I don’t really really wanna leave
No, I don’t really really wanna go
What the hell should I stay fucked?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t understand how you don’t agree
When you’re the reason we ain’t well we wanna be
Did you think of that?
No, bet you never thought of that
No, I know you want me back
No, but I ain’t coming back

[Chorus]
No no, we’ve been through this before
I can feel I want it
I’ma walk out that door
If you don’t give up
I don’t know if I can do it no more
I can’t feel I want it
I’ma walk out that door
If you don’t give right
Well you’d better get right now
If you don’t give right
Well you’d better get right now
If you don’t give right

[Verse 2]
I don’t even know what else to say
I don’t even need to say no more
Why should I keep repeating myself for
When you don’t even care anyway
When you don’t even got nothing to say
When all you do is push me away, yeah

[Pre-Chorus] I don’t understand how you don’t agree
When you’re the reason we ain’t well we wanna be
Did you think of that?
No, bet you never thought of that
No, I know you want me back
No, but I ain’t coming back

[Chorus]
No no, we’ve been through this before I can feel I want it I’ma walk out that door, If you don’t give up I don’t know if I can do it no more I can’t feel I want it I’ma walk out that door If you don’t give right

[Outro]
Get get get right
Get get get right
Get get get right
(Mustard on the beat, ho)
