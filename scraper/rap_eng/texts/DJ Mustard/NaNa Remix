Ok, there Ain't nothin to it
But somebody gotta do it
Get yo game up got my ratch on
Til a nigga put the brakes on
Stop!!!
You the baddest when you make yo booty talk
And if 2 of my chicks in the spot
They get along like Nicki and Riha

Yea we outchere
Pussyier in yo' cup

Chorus

Hold up Wait a minute
I see your girl is with it
I see she want me in it
Oh Na Na Oh Na Na
Hold up wait a minute
The way she drop and split it
And put her ass all in it
Oh Na Na Oh Na Na
