[Chorus: Ryan & Roscoe Dash]
I got a freak in the morning, freak in the evening
Do you want it like that?
Baby, turn it up and stay around
If you show me, I can do it like that
I could take you take, yeah and I ain't done yet and I ain't done yet
I could take you take, yeah, yeah and I ain't done yet and I ain't done yet

[Verse 1: Ryan]

So I can get on you, baby

I'ma take you down all night

[Chorus: Ryan & Roscoe Dash]
I got a freak in the morning, freak in the evening

I could take you take, yeah, yeah and I ain't done yet and I ain't done yet

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
(Carisma what up? Uh, P-Lo)
Uh, yeah, you know I dick it down then I lick her up
She told me she got a man but she don't give a fuck
From the back, from the side, how I switch it up
If you a bad lil' bitch then give it up
Uh, she know I like it worldwide
I ain't gon' handcuff you, girl, that ain't my style
Fr-from the West Coast so I go In-N-Out
Ne-never thought these words would come out my mouth
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Just for you
You can hop up in this whip
And we can do what we do

[Chorus: Ryan, Roscoe Dash & (P-Lo)]
I got a freak in the morning, freak in the evening

If you show me, I can do it like that
I could take you take, yeah and I ain't done yet and I ain't done yet
I could take you take, yeah, yeah and I ain't done yet and I ain't done yet

[Bridge: Ryan]
Down, down, shawty when you put it on me
Take you down, down, so girl, you don't ever wanna leave
Take you down, down, so get up on it and not quit
Take you down, down, down, down, down, down, you can be my secret freak

[Chorus: Ryan & Roscoe Dash]
I got a freak in the morning, freak in the evening
Do you want it like that?

I could take you take, yeah, yeah and I ain't done yet and I ain't done yet
