[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Seal popper, Mr. Big Bank Uchie face
Fresh up out the tempo and threw Budda on my jewelry
Stinc nina, head bopper, the spring cleaner
Four thick in a foreign, I'm bringing the street sweeper
Four Seasons, your bitch is a meat eater
Mud walking, plug talking, I was told I need Jesus
Don’t believe them Mr. TEC-9, MCM bag
I'm worth too many bands to be tied to a straggler
Drakeo ain't got work for us, nah you be tattling
And every song I get on make the beat go rattleing
And if you want beef with us just make sure you can handle that
Niggas got me nervous, got me grippin' where the handle at
Silly ass girl, sweetheart where your manners at?
Carry big guns, big guns, they go rat-tat-tat
Seal popper, I don’t play, boy still need my medicine
Young nigga, but to these boys I'm a veteran
Known to take, I should be housed up at Kettering
Silly billy really want to try me for my pieces
Bullets bodying for pints, yeah bitch it's that easy
This is fat means greasy, stevie it can get sleazy
Believe me, my young niggas is heathens, demons
Boy do you really want to see me? think not
Know it’s getting ugly, niggas asking for the re-rock
Piss test felon, I'ma have to take a detox

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
Mr. Hooligan, the mud sipper
Kick my foot in the air just to show my blood drippin'
High fashion, every scene is a closed casket
And tricks are for kids for you silly jack rabbits
Pocket rocket, Johnny Rocket, keep it on me
Scars on my face, nickname me Tony Tony
Mr. Mosley, stand close but don’t clone me
Big ass forty but they don’t think I keep it on me
Surely, these young niggas is foolies
Keep rocks and stones for anybody I think guilty
Play laser tag with niggas ten and think they bullies
Now a thousand frowns and nigga my song was just a clear key
Now it's news reporters and jewels and source for the nuisance
Now it's beads and chains, the J's be thinkin' I'm Buddas
Now it's news reporters and jewels and source for the nuisance
Now it's beads and chains, the J's be thinkin' I'm Buddas

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda

[Bridge: Drakeo the Ruler]
Carry big guns, big guns, they go rat-tat-tat
Seal popper, boy I don’t play, I need my medicine
Boy I need my medicine
Carry big guns, big guns, they go rat-tat-tat

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr. Big Bank Budda, Mr., Mr
Mr. Big Bank Budda
