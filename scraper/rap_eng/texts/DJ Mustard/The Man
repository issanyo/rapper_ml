Dolla Sign !
Mustard on the beat ho

[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up in that all white ghost, ghost
Lil' niggas better take notes, notes
Pushaz Ink bitch, we on on
Can't name one car I ain't drove

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
And I got Mustard on the beat, we good
Christian Louboutin on my feet, cause I could
Take you out the hood if you really want the wood
Bitch I'm from the Dubs, I ain't never hollywood
Dolla Sign, double cup up, mixing molly
Tights make a skinny bitch the life of the party
Ask me if I'm rolling, tell the bitch "Probably"
Never gave a fuck, never say "sorry"
Running out of money, never will I do it
I met your bitch, and toot it and boot it
Young Wild & Free, my life is a movie
Everyday freaking, everyday groupies
Indoor jacuzzi, outdoor jacuzzi
Take a bitch down to a rated X movie
All she says is "Louis", all she says is "Gucci"
Tell her anything, to get in that coochie , and I'm

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Imma be the man for a minute
Imma be the man for a minute
Let me put the Dolla Sign in it
Let me put the Dolla Sign in it
Oho, Now I don't know what be going on
But them tights make them bitches think they got it on (hahah)
Now I don't know what be going on, (JM Huh)
But them tights make them bitches think they got it on

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Tights and its lean shit
Red Bottom bitches, no reeboks
And bitch we got another one
And Mustard on the beat
So Imma kill it how I kill it, we done did it
Me & Ty done shitted on everyone committed
To every car we driven, to girls with big kittens
To all the hoes we pimping, the studios we're catching
The backyards with backyard, I get it back hard
And if she don't want to fuck then Imma jack off
And if the ass too big Imma smack off
Take the dick out of your mouth, bitch I'm bout to blast off
3, 2, 1, we're fucking on the coach
I only go raw if the dick was in your mouth
Imma slim on the nana, I'm Joe Obama
[??Miles'o Scama , bitch Sucarana??], ahah

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Imma be the man for a minute
Imma be the man for a minute
Let me put the Dolla Sign in it

Oho, Now I don't know what be going on
But them tights make them bitches think they got it on
Now I don't know what be going on
But them tights make them bitches think they got it on

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up in that all white ghost, ghost
Lil' niggas better take notes, notes
Pushaz Ink bitch, we on on
Can't name one car I ain't drove
And I got Mustard on the beat, we good

Bitch I got Mustard on the beat, we good
I'm from the Dubs, I ain't never hollywood, and I

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
