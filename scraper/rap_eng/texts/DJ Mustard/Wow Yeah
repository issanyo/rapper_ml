[Verse]
I'm never growing up
Stay forever young
Me and all my friends will run the world
Runnin' from the gun
Diamonds in our lungs
Sirens flashing purple when we drive
Guess it's in our blood
Burning rubber up
We could go for miles, and miles, and miles
Never gonna stop
Keep it super hot
2 hundred on a highway

[Chorus]
They see us, they go, "wow, yeah."
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow
You know that we're so wow, yeah
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow
You know that we're so wow, yeah
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow
You know that we're so wow, yeah
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow
They see us, they go...

[Verse]
I'm never growing up
Stay forever young
Me and all my friends will run the world
Runnin' from the gun
Diamonds in our lungs
Sirens flashing purple when we drive
Guess it's in our blood
Burning rubber up
We could go for miles, and miles, and miles
Never gonna stop
Keep it super hot
2 hundred on a highway

[Chorus]
They see us, they go, "wow, yeah."
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow
You know that we're so wow, yeah
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow
You know that we're so wow, yeah
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow
You know that we're so wow, yeah
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow
They see us, they go...
