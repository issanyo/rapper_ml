[Verse 1: Ty Van]

You told me Ty please stop making songs about me but I thought about ya
You said it’s no mistake, looked in my face, said you need space so I moved on without ya, and after moment after

I’m wondering like what she doing do she think of me, on second thoughts this can’t be real oh no this make believe, how you move on how you react and what you make of things, the type of stuff you can’t make up cause this ain’t maybelline, I’m hurting baby pray for me

You

You watch my instastory every time I post I wanna block ya now I don’t see up and down I go  I, reminisce when I put my tongue up and down your throat THEN, lay you on the BED in and out inside I go

Addicted to your grip, holding firm I’ll never slip, but right now you acting up wish you was just stick to the script, got my stomach doing flips, then my heart it start to skip, when you know you both in love but walk away that make you trip

[Post-Chorus]
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you)

[Verse 2]
Boy, you know we cool when I ain't waitin'
But I act a fool when I don't get it
And I'm steady bruisin' just to save this
But I tripped on your love, now I'm addicted

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's a whole lotta love, ain't tryna waste it
Like we be runnin' a mile to never make it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna taste it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna face it

[Chorus]
But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin'
I've been sippin', that's how I control
This feelin', you keep givin'
You keep on hittin' it, ooh, oh
Maybe it's your love, it's too good to be true
Baby boy, your love, got me trippin' on you
You know your love is big enough, make me trip up on you
Yeah, it's big enough, got me trippin' on you, trip-trippin' on you

[Post-Chorus]
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you, trippin' on you)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you, trippin' on you)

[Bridge]
That's some kind of love, baby (Drip, drip)
That's the type of love, make me (Trip, trip, trippin' on you)
It's big enough, make me (Drip, drip)
It's big enough, got me (Trip, trip, trippin' on you)

[Chorus]
I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin'
I've been sippin', that's how I control
This feelin', you keep givin'
You keep on hittin' it, ooh, oh
Maybe it's your love, it's too good to be true
Baby boy, your love, got me trippin' on you
You know your love is big enough, make me trip up on you
Yeah, it's big enough, got me trippin' on you, trip-trippin' on you

[Post-Chorus]
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (My bad, my bad, my bad, trippin' on you, yeah)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you, trippin' on you, baby)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you)
Said I admit I was wrong when I did it
My bad, my bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (Trippin' on you, trippin' on you)

[Outro]
Trippin' on you, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
