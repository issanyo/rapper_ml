[Intro]
Ella Mai: I been thinking ‘bout telling him for a while now but what you think?
Girl: I think that’s a good idea, are you sure you want to do that?
Ella Mai: I mean, to be honest, I don’t even- I don’t care. I don’t care about him
Girl: That’s true, but it’s whatever makes you happy
Ella Mai: Hold on, hold on, hold on, he’s calling me. I’ma call you back, alright?
Girl: Alright

Ella Mai: Hello?
Guy: Hey, what’s up? I just want to say I’m sorry

[Verse]
Hold up
I got a confession
While you was out doing her, I was out doing him
Had to teach you a lesson
'Cause what I needed here was missing
Two can play the game, I ain’t tripping
'Cause you thought that I would stay
Now your ass gon’ pay
Can’t teach an old dog new tricks
Ain’t gon’ be the one you screwing
You made your bed, boy you better lay in it
'Cause I’m laying with another
Hope the next time you know better
Next time you know better
Next time you know better
Next time you know better
