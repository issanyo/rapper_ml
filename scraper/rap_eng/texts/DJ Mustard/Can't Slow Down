[Intro: RJ]
Slow down, slow down
Slow down, down, down

[Verse 1: RJ]
I was politicking, with my father missing
Where my pops was living? He was in and out of prison
I was fighting for my visits
I waited
Pistols in the kitchen Washing broken dishes
I was out the system. Intuition, had me fishin'
For a decent pot to piss in
I waited
So what you fucked up?
Cause I been fucked up
Yeah I been fucked up, been showed tough love
Took what the streets gave, and got my dough up
Now I don't give no fucks, and I don't trust your love
Cause live get broke up when hoes done shows up

[Hook]
I can't slow down, now, now
I can't slow down, now, now
No, I can't slow up, get my dough up
I can't slow up, get my dough up
I won't slow up, get my dough up
No, I can't slow up, get my dough up
Slow down, down, down
I can't slow down, down
They feel me it's the real me
Slow down

[Bridge: RJ]
No I don't know a limit
I just go and get it
Pose with every [?]
I'm so photogenic
I just wonder if you get the picture
I waited

[Hook]
Now I can't slow up, get my dough up
I can't slow up, get my dough up
No I won't slow up, get my dough up
I can't slow up, get my dough up
No, I can't slow up, get my dough up
I can't slow up, get my dough up
No, I won't slow up, get my dough up
I can't slow up, get my dough up

[Verse 2: Choice]
Why you wanna run the game on me
When, my name ain't[?]
My name ain't Chuck-E-Cheese, bitch
Fuck e'em up [?] black and japanese bitch
You just tired of these niggas talking street shit
But live on internet[?], so that don't mean shit
We play ball, I have my lawyer playing defence
And he get us a better world [?]
The trick, the choice, player ass name, baby
[?]Gery last name, last name baby
And young soldiers, boy they dime a [?]
Sparklers at the table like we scared to play with firecracker
[?] drum remove the [?]
Grocery bag overt the thumb, catching shells as they jump
[?] chip off his soldier
Unloading, refuel, kill the niggas [?]

[Hook]
No, I can't slow up, get my dough up
I can't slow up, get my dough up
No, I won't slow up, get my dough up
No, I can't slow up, get my dough up
Slow down, down, down
Slow, slow
You feel me, it's the real me
Slow down, down, down
