[Intro]
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, one thing though
Richvale

[Verse 1]
I had a bay like Hudson
And you be on a beat hoe, Mustard
And she could probably suck a dick for some Trukfit
My hairs so gorgeous and my tracks so ugly
And I'm everything these other guys ain't
Still keep is 'G' without a gun on my waist
My scent Tom Ford, yeah she fuck with my taste
She like, "Boo I got a man, but can we fuck?"
I'm like. "Wait, that ain't right girl"
She care more about her title than integrity
She wanna take a photo next to me
Cause she think I got money just to blow, bitch
You could fool anyone except for me
You got an ass like a video model (what, what)
But you got a brain like a peanut
She like, "Pryde, can you send me some dollars?"
Boo, you got a man, but I could come and send you DEEZ NUTS
Homie that's that nerve
Unless you got some followers that bitch is gon' curve
And if you 'bout being stuck up bitch (word)
All my real ones that be with me say, "word"
Whats up?

[Chorus]
When a real youngin' want you
And your man he can't do nothing for ya
Oh, These hoes ain’t loyal
Oh, These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah, yeah, ah, let me see

[Verse 2]
Why you want fame? You don't need it
All these dumb chicks wanna be famous for no reason
Can't cook, can't clean, can't chill
But be up on the internet preaching 'bout whats real
I'll give you real
Still know right here, after overseas
Getting chicks to dress up for me call it hoe-loween
And I don't even really care if she say no to me
I see the vision , my vision baby there's more to see
Freakin' no speakin', I'm only here for the weekend
I got her sayin, "Oh my god!'
Without a preacher or deacon
She on me for no reason
She prolly think that I'm rich
Awh man I wouldn't trust that bitch, no!

Come on, come on, girl, why you fronting?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon’ leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon’ cheat
Come on, come on, girl, why you fronting?
Baby show me something
You say that you love me
But you can bet your bottom dollar she ain't loyal

[Chorus]
When a real youngin' want you
And your man he can't do nothing for ya
Oh, These hoes ain’t loyal ( these hoes ain’t loyal)
Oh, These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah, yeah, ah, let me see
When a real youngin' want you (want you baby)
And your man he can't do nothing for ya (oh nothin', oh)
Oh, These hoes ain’t loyal ( they playing games)
Oh, These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah, yeah, ah, let me see

[Outro]
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal (let me see)
These hoes ain't loyal (yeah, oh, yeah)
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal (these hoes ain't loyal)
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
No-oh
