[Intro]
Locked up in Lexington went through Atlanta
Been in New Orleans I've been to Miami
Fuck with AZ I'm at home in Cali
He been to Mexico he been to Panama

[Hook]
They had me locked away down in the country
(locked up in Lexington went through Atlanta)
I just got back I was down in the country
(Been in New Orleans I've been to Miami)
Plugged on the west side of the country
(Fuck with AZ I'm at home in Cali)
Cuz just got back he was out of the country
(He been to Mexico he been to Panama)

[Verse 1]
I say when I make it out of Kentucky, Ima be poppin' and Ima get money
I'm over these niggas like I'm nigga's bunkies, I didn't get lucky bitch I had to hustle
Saw my family go through that struggle, they didn't do that shit for nothin'
If I fuck with a bitch I would be cheatin' cause I'm in a relationship with this moolah
I done heard niggas tell me they gon kill me, I done heard niggas tell bitches I'm snitchin'
But I'm still livin' you niggas just talkin'? 30 shots on me come show me you wit it
Bitch don't play with me cause you can get it, after I blow you I'm droppin' yo nigga
It be the niggas that ain't got no money, that ain't got no bodies that swear they some killas

[Hook]
They had me locked away down in the country
(I've been to Memphis went through Cincinnati)
I just got back I was down in the country
(At home in Missouri and Louisiana)
I got a plug from out of the country
(He from Bar Guam he only speak Spanish)
Cuz got back he was down in the country
(He get 15 dollars for a xanny nigga)

[Verse 2]
I say once I make it outta that prison, I'ma be winnin', I'ma make millions
She call me daddy but she not my daughter, and I didn't raise her I don't got no children
I cannot fuck her unless she on fleek, my shoulders hurt cause Detroit on my shoulders
Playin' is over, this choppa 400 degrees it ain't from the Nolia
Heard all my niggas got hit with indictments, heard my whole city got hit with indictments
We see them rollies and we get excited, we see them foreigns and we get excited
We see that money and we get excited (ahh), we see them bitches and they get excited (ahh)
We see them 40's and we get excited, we see them choppas and we get excited
Play with that money I take it to violence, 10 niggas spittin' like we in a cypher
Cuttin' you open like we a few doctors, I know some lords, I know some disciples
Them niggas bangin' like they out of Compton, them niggas half human half monster
I say when I make it out of that county, I'm really gon' play with them commas
I'm really not playin' with nobody, nigga touch me and it's bodies on bodies on bodies on bodies on bodies on bodies
You know I ain't playin' with you niggas
You know niggas play with them commas
You know I need help when I counted
Them killas do what I say like I'm Simon, I cannot fuck with you unless you solid
All of this talkin' my nigga be quiet
Some shit is private where is yo silence?
They had me locked away out in Kentucky
'cause I saw them rollies and I got excited
Who is this nigga you with is he wired?
I can't get back in the car with the sirens

[Hook]
They had me locked away down in the country
(I've been to Covington hustled in Ashland)
I just got back I was down in the country
(Bro in Columbus, his plug in Tampa)
I got a plug from out of the country

Plugged on the west side of the country
(Rodeo drive paper not the plastic nigga)
