[Hook: TeeCee4800]
Bitch nigga you corny
Ridin' round in the Forgies
You ain't even got four G's
You ain't even know four G's
My Louboutins cost four G's
Bitch nigga you the police
And I don't fuck with the police
Ridin' round in the Forgies, with four 4G's

[Verse 1: TeeCee4800]
Ayy it's T.C. the Loc, got money got weed
Got promethazine and a lot of Robin Jeans
I stay fly my nigga, I do this shit on the daily
You stay broke my nigga, you do that shit on the daily
I woke up thought being broke was borin'
So I robbed a couple houses in Torrance
Cashed out, on a foreign
Pull up to any bitch I'm scorin'
Uh you know I stay with them fly kicks
You know I stay with a fly bitch
And you can try to bag her
But every time you do she be like

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
Bitch nigga you corny
Ridin' round in the Forgies
You ain't even got four G's
You ain't even know four G's
My Louboutins cost four G's
Bitch nigga you the police
And I don't fuck with the police
Ridin' round in the Forgies, with four 4G's

[Verse 2: E-40]
Zappboard beneath the ashtray, woofers in the back
Water in the duals make loud glass pack
Sogliano tippy toes twenty-fours chrome
Bought a set of pirelli's and left the stickers on
Skippin' down ave with the beat on blam
Soundin' like a motherfuckin' summer jam
Fat bank roll, my pockets pregnant
Both of them twins, they need a c-section
My Feddi lengthy like 40 career, hustlin'
Granddaddy purp in the air, hoverin'
Zonin' like a motherfucker, high as a quail
Bluntpower spray to get rid of the smell

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
Bitch nigga you corny
Ridin' round in the Forgies
You ain't even got four G's
You ain't even know four G's
My Louboutins cost four G's
Bitch nigga you the police
And I don't fuck with the police
Ridin' round in the Forgies, with four 4G's

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Four G's, two bottles at Greystone
Smokin', getting my drink on
Threw four G's on your baby momma
Secret Sunday's now she at the My Cabana
Four G's for the bill at Katana
Thousand tip for the waitress I'm a baller
Shot caller, 64 Impala
Don dadda, me and Ace Obama
Faded at the Grammy's with the G-pen
Dolla sign kush, I'm reekin'
Yeah I smell like Kesha
You niggas corny, like tortillas

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
Bitch nigga you corny
Ridin' round in the Forgies
You ain't even got four G's
You ain't even know four G's
My Louboutins cost four G's
Bitch nigga you the police
And I don't fuck with the police
Ridin' round in the Forgies, with four 4G's

[Verse 4: Charley Hood]
I'm on my bullshit spittin' like two clip
Got your bitch on my pool table doin' splits
How them niggas actin'? Spoiled like they trappin'
I'm from 10-4 street none of that happenin'
Me and my niggas, burnt out
All fly shit, all ru'd out
Talkin' reckless? Nigga outside your mouth
Gone ahead and get you pistol whipped like bloom blaow
No tough talk you ain't got no rap sheet
Y'all niggas ain't really had no beef
Y'all niggas ain't really clap no heat
Stop cuffin' your bitch, nigga come approach me!

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
Bitch nigga you corny
Ridin' round in the Forgies

You ain't even know four G's
My Louboutins cost four G's
Bitch nigga you the police

Ridin' round in the Forgies, with four 4G's
