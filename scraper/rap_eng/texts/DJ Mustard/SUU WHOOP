[Intro]
I'm from West Side Bompton Tree (suu whoop)
Fuck all the fake Bloods and the enemies (suu whoo-suu whoop)
YG 4Hunnid chunkin' big P's
Niggas went quiet, then Mustard did the beat

[Pre-Chorus]
Suu whoop, my coupe, suu whoop, suu whoop
Suu whoop, my bitch, put red on her shoes
Suu whoop 'til I die, no lie, that's truth
Suu whoop, gang ties, bullet wounds, that's proof

[Chorus]
Suu whoop gang or don't bang (suu whoo-suu whoop, bang)
You ain't got a pistol, don't hang (suu whoo-suu whoop, don't hang)
I ain't scared, nigga, I'm bray (suu whoo-suu whoop, I'm brave)
YG a rapper and he full-fledged bang (bang)

[Verse 1]
Suu whoop my rag (rag)
I'm suu whoop when I'm mad (mad)
"YG, don't you got a daughter?"
Yeah, I'm a gangbangin'-ass dad (dad)
Big B, Gucci bag (bag), blue hundreds in my bag (my bag)
"YG, how you feel about the hundreds bein' blue?"
Nigga, I ain't mad
The Crips know I'm with this Blood shit
Need a Piru and that's Blood, bitch
Always down with this thug shit
She get fly, she suck dick
Pull up Bentley, mean muggin' (muggin')
All daps, she ain't huggin'
If you a square, you ain't fuckin'
She love 2Pac, she thuggin' (she thuggin', nigga)

[Refrain]
"YG, he brazy (brazy)
Grew up off B Brazy (B Brazy)
YG, he paid (he paid)
Don't get in his way (his way)"
.40 on my waist (my waist)
Like I'm tryna go to jail today (today)
Red rubies in my chain (my chain)
Niggas know how much I paid
A lot, on the block, YG be goin' to the top, to the top, to the top
In a box, never let 'em put a nigga in a box
'Cause a nigga off the block
YG a.k.a. Big Blood, a.k.a. Big Red Fox (Big Red Fox, nigga)
YG a.k.a. Lil' Buddha from that 400 block (4Hunnid)

[Pre-Chorus]
Suu whoop, my coupe, suu whoop, suu whoop
Suu whoop, my bitch, put red on her shoes
Suu whoop 'til I die, no lie, that's truth
Suu whoop, gang ties, bullet wounds, that's proof

[Chorus]
Suu whoop gang or don't bang (suu whoo-suu whoop, bang)
You ain't got a pistol, don't hang (suu whoo-suu whoop, don't hang)
I ain't scared, nigga, I'm bray (suu whoo-suu whoop, I'm brave)
YG a rapper and he full-fledged bang (bang)

[Verse 2]
Bangin' on these bitch niggas
Bangin' while I'm rich, nigga
I don't make no sense, nigga
'Cause I don't give no shit, nigga
Come to L.A. and pay rent, nigga
Your bloodshed ain't lit, nigga
Fuck it, you don't wanna be a bitch, nigga
You a clown, you IT, nigga
Suu whoopin' in my songs
My enemies sing my songs
My suu whoopin' so strong (so strong)
I can't do no wrong (no wrong)
My whoopin' can't be cloned (can't clone)
I'm berious, I'm bold (I'm bold)
My bitch in a suu whoop robe (my throne)
Take it off, she in a suu whoop thong (her thong)
I ain't with the pink-haired Blood shit (suu whoop)
I ain't with the only-at-the-club-Bloodin' (suu whoo-suu whoop)
My niggas I be with, they known for bustin' (suu whoo-suu whoop-whoop)
What, who, and where? End of discussion

[Refrain]
"'Cause YG, he brazy (brazy)
Grew up off B Brazy (B Brazy)
YG, he paid (paid)
Don't get in his way (his way)"
.40 on my waist (my waist)
Like I'm tryna go to jail today (today)
Red rubies in my chain (my chain)
Niggas know how much I paid, a lot

[Pre-Chorus]
Suu whoop, my coupe, suu whoop, suu whoop (suu whoop)
Suu whoop, my bitch, put red on her shoes (suu whoop)
Suu whoop 'til I die, no lie, that's truth
West Side Tree Top Bompton, nigga, on Bloods
Suu whoop, gang ties, bullet wounds, that's proof
On Piru, suu whoooooop

[Chorus]
Suu whoop gang or don't bang (suu whoo-suu whoop, bang)
You ain't got a pistol, don't hang (suu whoo-suu whoop, don't hang)
I ain't scared, nigga, I'm bray (suu whoo-suu whoop, I'm brave)
YG a rapper and he full-fledged bang (bang)
