[Hook]
We can do it in a hotel
You can meet me in the lobby
Just don't tell nobody
Keep it on the down low
We gon' do it on the down low
Down low
We do it on the down lo
Ain't no talkin'
Ain't no talkin' in here
We do it on the down low
Down low
Girl, we gonna do it real slow
Ain't no talkin'
Ain't no talkin' in here

[Verse 1]
One, roll my blunt, the we gon' smoke
Two, ice in my cup, you pour up
Three, you can't stop feelin' on me
Four, you ain't no whore, you just horny
Five, it's just us in this room all alone
Six, kissing you on your spot
Seven, you talkin' to me freaky
Eight, open your legs and I'm gon' search you right
Nine, when you wanna do it again
Ten, just remember we can do it in

[Hook]
We can do it in a hotel
You can meet me in the lobby
Just don't tell nobody
Keep it on the down low
We gon' do it on the down low
Down low
We do it on the down lo
Ain't no talkin'
Ain't no talkin' in here
We do it on the down low
Down low
Girl, we gonna do it real slow
Ain't no talkin'
Ain't no talkin' in here
We do it on the down lo

[Verse 2]
Your whole body speaking a language
You ain't gotta take off that skirt
I'm gon' put my name on it
I might even put my head in it
Just don't catch feelings
Because you know my sex is right
See, girl, when you wanna do it again
Just remember we can do it in

[Hook]
We can do it in a hotel
You can meet me in the lobby
Just don't tell nobody
Keep it on the down low
We gon' do it on the down low
Down low
We do it on the down lo
Ain't no talkin'
Ain't no talkin' in here
We do it on the down low
Down low
Girl, we gonna do it real slow
Ain't no talkin'
Ain't no talkin' in here
We do it on the down lo
