[Hook]
Tonight we're fading away
Passport, chandeliers and champagne
So high like we're up in a plane
I know, I know, we do it for fame

[Instrumental]

Tonight we're fading away
Passport, chandeliers and champagne
So high like we're up in a plane
I know, I know, we do it for fame

Tonight we're fading away
Passport, chandeliers and champagne
So high like we're up in a plane
I know, I know, we do it for fame

Tonight we're fading away
Passport, chandeliers and champagne
So high like we're up in a plane
I know, I know, we do it for fame

[Verse: Noonie Bao]
We are the wheel of fortune
Spinnin' round and round
We are the lucky, lucky (lucky)
Never going down
So go tell all your girlfriends
To come around
'Cause we don't stop, stop
Drink it up

[Refrain]
Lazy girls club, club
We sleep all day
We're up all night, night
Limousines in neon light
