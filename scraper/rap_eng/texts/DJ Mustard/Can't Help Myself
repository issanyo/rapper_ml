[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm on right now
I want it right now
I been a thing for ya, babe
Yeah, yeah
Like getting loud
Backseat, I'm down
Backseat, I'm down

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm ready whenever
Put bitches together
It's all about we
We on the same team
Bring the Hen' and gold wrappers
Get active and strapped up
You're losing your mind
I'm losing my mind

[Chorus]
Can't help myself
Can't help myself
Can't help myself
Can't help myself
Can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Look in the mirror right now
I repeat, right now
I'll take it off for ya, baby
Oh
Whip it up like cake
Do you think you can take it?
Uh, do you think you can take?

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm ready whenever
Put bitches together
It's all about we
We on the same team
Bring the Hen' and gold wrappers
Get active and strapped up
You're losing your mind
I'm losing my mind

[Chorus]
Can't help myself
Can't help myself
Can't help myself
Can't help myself
Can't help myself
