Featuring DJ Mustard

(Verse)
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
While my capricorn's at it's really thirsty
And picture hands in the air you driving merces
This is for the bitches
Weave long, tights on ,name is my bitches
Team long money long take alot of bitches
Got that iphone 5, love that instagram pictures
Got them jays on, with your nails done
Ride big good but you don't care nah
Got a girlfriend ready for the threesome
Got a nigga but you really don't need one

(Pre-Hook)
I bet you fuck him, truck him
Buzz it like it's open
Put it to the side
Open wide and let me come in
Baby I'm a freak shit I'm no game
You got your ex looking teddy
That's his whole name?

(Hook)
I got a hundred thousand dollars in my pocket
And watch them hoes breaking off when I drop it
Shake your ass real whore till it break
I tell her it's your birthday so let me cut your cake
And tell the bitch to get nekkid
Let me see you get nekkid
And tell the bitch to get nekkid
Let me see you get nekkid
And watch her ass hit the floor

(Verse)
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
Where all my leos at I'm really thirsty
And put your hands in the air we driving merces
Take lessons on the side tryin' to learn tricks
Pay 25 a hour just to ride dick
With the car scene and there is a crenshaw
And baby daddy really think he a pimp
He got a new benz with a car plug
And got another bitch pregnant down in Hartham
Is it saddy or is it bm
He got alot of bitches poppin' in his BM

(Pre-Hook)
I bet you fuck him, truck him
Buzz it like it's open
Put it to the side
Open wide and let me come in
Baby I'm a freak shit I'm no game
You got your ex looking teddy
That's his whole name?

(Hook)
I got a hundred thousand dollars in my pocket
And watch them hoes breaking off when I drop it
Shake your ass real whore till it break
I tell her it's your birthday so let me cut your cake
And tell the bitch to get nekkid
Let me see you get nekkid
And tell the bitch to get nekkid
Let me see you get nekkid
And watch her ass hit the floor

(Bridge) x2
All the end up in the bitches holla
All the broke bitches don't bother
All the pretty bitches with the wig
Do a trick for a fucking dollar

(Hook)
I got a hundred thousand dollars in my pocket
And watch them hoes breaking off when I drop it
Shake your ass real whore till it break
I tell her it's your birthday so let me cut your cake
And tell the bitch to get nekkid
Let me see you get nekkid
And tell the bitch to get nekkid
Let me see you get nekkid
And watch her ass hit the floor
