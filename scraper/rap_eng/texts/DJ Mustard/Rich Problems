I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems

[Verse 1: Que]
If I keep shittin' on you, I apologize
Niggas ain't eatin' like its Ramadan
Bitches in my entourage, all flavors like HÃ¤agen-Dazs
Hit you with the carbine 9 if you play with the parmesan
Ballin' so hard jump the scrimmage line
Closet like a mothafuckin' Finish Line
Garage open, shit look like a Enterprise
Rich nigga still eatin' noodles when its dinner time
I just found a 100 in my pants pocket
Never carry cash cause it don't fit in my damn wallet
Got an "F" in school, but I made an "A" for flashy
Whatchu make a year, thats what I gotta pay for taxes
I got problems you don't got
My bitches keep bitchin' to me bout some botox
They like to pop up on a nigga like Jackbox
I gotta swap and pay rent on like four spots

[Hook]
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I don't know which Rollie I'm gonna wear
Ain't no real niggas over their
I be ridin' in a vert in a thunderstorm with a bitch with long hair
Walk in Giuseppe's, I got four pair
I'm on the drugs gave her dope sausage
Just a young nigga beatin' dope charges
Switchin' time zones, I need four watches
She suck it so long she need a throat lozenge
Foot on the wood during all star
Mailbox so far I need a golf cart
Crib so big its like Wal-Mart
Yard so big its like a ballpark
You know they call Target "Target"
Nigga don't get in my way
Dont be my "Target"
F-f-fire shots at your ball fade
And she is so wet she's a mermaid
Truuu!

[Hook]
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems

I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
I got rich nigga problems, I got rich nigga problems
