[Verse 1]
You can say what you want
I do what I want
Maybe tomorrow we can see things differently but
The way its going right now we better put it on hold
You see seventeen messages in seventeen minutes I can't
Reply no more, my hand's not in it
Told me to shut you down
But Imma put down this phone
So patiently I'm listening
I know that you've been up waiting for me
Alright I'll tell you
Before you're goin' down and lock the door
Soon as I get home I'll be all yours

[Chorus]
Let me come inside
And we can reconcile
Let me come inside
And we can reconcile

[Drop]

[Post-Drop]
On, on it, on
On, on it, on
On, on it, on
On, on it, on

[Verse 2]
I can break it down to the beat
One heart between you and me
Make you forget all that I need
Remember how sweet this love can be
I can break it down to the beat
One heart between you and me
Make you forget all that I need
Remember how sweet this love can be
(love can be)
(love can be)
(love can be)
(love can be)

[Chorus]
Let me come inside
And we can reconcile
Let me come inside
And we can reconcile

[Drop]
