No shame no retakes, just blame no regrets
Balmain jeans call paris if you snap me you know im lavish
No ceo status, all my mandem savage
Why you hating now little man. Soon you'll be one of my little fans
Always keep Jaes on my feet, gucci shades like im a geek. (Emz)

[Verse]
Who's that? Who's that? At the door. Won't stop Won't stop!
You know I need more, been on this ting since I could afford
Sign me for cheap? Are you mad! Are you sure?
Now im rich i used to be poor... Wealth but now family torn
Soon german car I'll be whipping
Soon me and you be glistening

My life has changed I swear down shit won't be the same
AMG different lanes full throttle I ain't touching brakes
You know I keep it real. i still love all my bros
But mandem talk to me as if they own the roads

My life has changed I swear down shit won't be the same
AMG different lanes full throttle I ain't touching brakes
You know I keep it real. i still love all my bros
But mandem talk to me as if they own the roads


[Chorus]
Dig down diamonds, hiding now find us
Jump infront I wait in the line
Don't worry about me im fine!
Emz you good on trap?Rap? or grime?, stay in your lane im just fly
Asking me how is my life
Don't worry about me im fine
