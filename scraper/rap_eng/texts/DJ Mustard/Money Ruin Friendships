[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't ever lost a friend
And if I ever did, then fuck them niggas
Still money over bitches
Fucked up how money ruin friendships

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm the nigga with the check, girl
I'm the nigga put these diamonds on your neck, girl
I got the juice, baby, I just wanna spend it on you, baby
All my niggas getting dough, we stay real
I still take a nigga bitch, fuck how he feel
No old bitches in the brand new crib
All ten toes stomp down, I'll be on my shit

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
And I ain't ever lost a friend
If I ever did, then fuck them niggas
And it's still money over bitches
Fucked up how money ruin friendships
Fucked up how money ruin friendships

[Outro: Joe Moses]
I ain't ever lost a fade, and if I ever did, scream fuck them niggas
I ain't ever lost a friend, and if I ever did, Blood really wasn't with us
