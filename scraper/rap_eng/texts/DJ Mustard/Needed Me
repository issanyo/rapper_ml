[Verse 1]
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
Also feeling lush[?]
Dude, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling cheated aw?[?]
You should chip off that shit I was kicking to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you but

[Pre]
Baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another number on a hit list
Trying to fix it in a issues with a bad bitch[?]
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never saying you could have it

[Chorus]
You, needed me
Ooh, you, needed me
Feel a little more,[?]
But baby ooh, you, needed me

[Verse 2]
