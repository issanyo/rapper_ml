[Hook: TeeCee4800]
I got my phone and I tell her to come over
I got the pole in the crib and we gon' go up
Shake that ass, shake that ass, shake that ass
You the only girl getting all this cash (getting all these racks)

[Verse 1: TeeCee4800]
I said stop acting sadity tonight you can be a rack
C'mon suck up all this dick and get that ass smacked
I be dipping from the cops so fast, call me NASCAR
Got the weed, lean, fiends call me for that Aderall
I used to rock pro clubs, now I rock Burberry
No love here, turn my phone off to February
Toot it and boot it, don't care if I lose it
I give it to you, don't care what you do with it

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
I got my phone and I tell her to come over
I got the pour up in the crib and we gon' go up
Shake that ass, shake that ass
You the only girl getting all this cash (getting all these racks)
I got my phone and I tell her to come over
I got the pole in the crib and we gon' go up
Shake that ass, shake that ass
You the only girl getting all this cash (getting all these racks)

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Shake that ass right now
Get that cash right now
They playing with you, I'm gon' help you get that bag right now
I'm in a stash right now
Work that pole for a nigga, then get low
Had to grab me some more condoms from the store
She a freak and you know she trying to go
Girl you playing, let me take your ass on roll
Ayye, bitch I'm paid
While you playing I might throw it in your face
TeeCee, tell the hoe how we play
I got bitches, why the fuck would I text?
Bring Magic City all the way to Cali
Girl stop playing I might hit it in some Ballys
I'm in the lab, I'll meet you in the Valley
Like I'm Pat Riley, got a win like Khaled

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
I got my phone and I tell her to come over
I got the pole in the crib and we gon' go up
Shake that ass, shake that ass
You the only girl getting all this cash (getting all these racks)
I got my phone and I tell her to come over
I got the pole in the crib and we gon' go up
Shake that ass, shake that ass
You the only girl getting all this cash (getting all these racks)
