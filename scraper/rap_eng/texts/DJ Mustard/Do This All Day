[Verse 1]
Smoking on American, eyes looking Chinese
Flow so sick I just stuck it with an IV
So far in the sky little rappers can't find me
Everyvtime I swim in the pussy girl I dive deep
I be, chilling smoking on that diesel
I don't really give a fuck about your people
Only one Stoney, there could never be a sequel
Never be a equal, motherfuckers need to get that
Adidas everything and never do I miss match
1st place at everything, never do I get last
Never do I smoke blunts, only roll them Zig-Zags
Pussy ass bitches whining for they bitch back
That's a lost cause
Gave her dick longer than the amount that your pot cost
Spend time on spending money
Lately life is getting a lil' funny
Everybody hate but never say to the front of me
Probably cause they know I run this shit like a 100 feet
And I'm gonna be everything that I wanna be
She lick my lollipop but I'm sucker free
Oh yeah and that's Mustard on the beat
Mayonnaise on her lips, broccoli in the zips
Salsa on the chips and my dick in yo bitch
I don't really give a fuck and I never said otherwise
All these rappers are my children and father never listen to his son advice
And I do advise

[Verse 2]
You to shut the fuck up and listen to my flow man
Don't ask me how I do this shit cause I don't really know man
I ain't know it, ain't know it
But I know I spit some dope shit
This that shit I give em hope with
Ass so fat I can't even give her whole dick
She ask me if I love her, I tell her "Whoah bitch!
This ain't a fucking love song
This a fucking fuck song
So I'm a slow it down so you can get your fuck on
Back that ass up now drop it on that dick girl
I'll fuck you so good you'll feel like it's just us in this big world
I love when them hips twirl
Yeah do it like that and I'm a do it like this
This that Time Alone 3 and I'm Stoney Wright bitch
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, bitch I'm on like the light switch
And what I'm on is that more than alright shit
That shit you hit and until your mouth dry
That shit that make you smile like you found pie
Yeah I'm on that shit
They calling me that bastard like I had a black lip
You a photobomb rapper in the back like an adlib
And you like a bitch with no ass, you Miley Cyrus
Haha

[Verse 3]
I could do this shit all day like it ain't nada
Tell her gimme pinoch and she say si papa
Don't look at me surprised at my position cause I've been aca
Yeah I been here, higher than the sky goes
After so much bullshit this is what I chose
High socks with high hoes
High tops with bright clothes
I know I got you mind blown
Like how the fuck he rap so well like he already famous
Well look man this my gift and you can never take it
I'm never gonna stop like there's no brakes
I drop shit so hard it needs it own case
I'm a bad motherfucker but that's probably what you figured
Boy I rep Texas AND my city in the center
254 till I'm 187
This is hell on earth cause it certainly ain't' heaven
I'm going harder than T-Pain on his own song
I'm up in this bitch about to get my smoke on
Motherfucker I'm AG so it's grind mode, grind mode, grind mode
What's up to the Den, motherfucker I'm home
I'm stoned more than a mountain
What is rap with me?
A child's sport
If life a bitch, make her smile more
Every part of me different like tile floor
And when you think you went the furthest, went a mile more
So fresh, so clean, graduate of 13
Now I'm the 361, studying at the TAMU
Stripes on my shit like Grandview
If you ain't know, they the zebras and my shit Adidas
