[Verse 1]
I know this chick from around the way
She only hit me up everytime shorty want some
First I'm like cool it's straight like this can't be real shorty where is you from my god
But now it's like I think of you everytime I'm on your block
It's just something I'm not used to got me waiting round the clock

[Pre-Hook]
I know lots of women but I'd rather call your ass up when it's 2am
I could get to pimping but I'd rather hit your ass up knock it out
Then I hit you "I'm on my way"
Then you hit me like "OK"
Then bout 10 minutes later you hit me up with a text that's like "I'm really tired"

[Hook]
Feel like I'm slippin on my pimpin by telling what it is
I don't usually be trippin like this but it is what it is
Girl it is what it is yea girl it is what it is yea girl it is what it is oh yea

[Verse 2]
You be talkin a lot through the phone
You at the crib nothing on (nothing on)
I be ready to go you like take your time (time)
When it's up to you you like never mind
I want it now I don't  need hesitation
Guess the liquor got you losin patience but if I did that to you it but an attitude oh

[Pre-Hook]
I know lots of women but I'd rather call your ass up when it's 2am
