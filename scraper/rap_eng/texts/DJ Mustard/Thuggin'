[Verse 1: Jay 305]
I'mma a rider, I'm in the streets where it's violent
Niggas beefin' over nothin', fuck it we thuggin'
House party, fuck clubbin', take a fade, it's nothin'
I'm blussin'
You ain't the homie nigga? We jumpin'
On my momma
We don't care around here
No respect around here, smell like death around here
Tiny fuck ass niggas, throwin' up westside and bitches
And don't even fuck with us
Where your pass at?
Matter fact where you from? We don't stand back
I'm in every hood like a motherfuckin' alley cat
I lost somebody momma or a hood rat
Posted in the hood around here
And that's why I'm good around here

[Hook: Jay 305]
I'm thuggin', on everything I'm thuggin'
Everyday I'm thuggin', everyday I'm thuggin'
All my homies thuggin', all my bitches thuggin'
My momma know I'm thuggin', nigga

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Bitch I'm from the (?) double lean
No BM, that's sucker shit
I'm really from (?), my nigga, I'm so (?)
My fullies is thugs, we'll shoot up the club
I'm the reason your favorite rapper's a blood
To say I'm the truth, I get loose up in the booth
You niggas is fakers, see me? It's in my roots
Really on the block though, phase ironic
Heard was you a turn-up in 2400
All red laces, chucks, I don't give two fucks
Got two twin Glocks, I call 'em my two sluts
I bust two nuts, finger fuckin' my bitches
We don't fuck with no (?)
Fuck boys in (?)
I don't trust you bitches but I'll fuck your daughter
Got a Rollie from Steve, clear diamonds as water
It's the AOB and them OPMs
I made a mill off tour, and I'm still thuggin'

[Hook: Jay 305]

[Verse 3: Jay 305]
I'm a rider, I'm in the streets where it's violent
Don't be on no sucker shit
Take a fade, it's nothin'
Really on the block though, phase ironic
Matter of fact, where are you from? We don't stand back
Fuck with no (?), fuck boys in (?)
