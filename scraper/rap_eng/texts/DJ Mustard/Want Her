[Intro: YG & DJ Mustard]
4Hunnid
Y'all already know who I am, right?
Mustard on the beat, ho!
Let's go

[Chorus: Quavo]
Girl all the rich niggas, girl all the rich niggas, they want you
Girl all the rich niggas, girl all the rich niggas, they want you
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her

[Verse 1: Quavo]
If I'ma spend I'ma pay for some friends
I'ma pay for some friends
If I'ma spend I'ma pay for some friends
I'ma pay for some friends
If I'ma spend I gotta pay for some friends
Let me pay for some friends
If I'ma spend, shawty bring your friends
I'ma pay, I'ma jugg, get 'em in
I'ma rap to you like Juvenile when that bag come
You want a rich nigga to pay your table tab, huh?
When we go shopping you want me to buy that bag, huh?
You don't like it when I hop out with that mag, huh?
You don't like it when I'm fifty deep with my niggas, huh?
That's the only way a nigga can't come get you, huh?
I got what you want, I know what you want
Want a rich nigga come and pull up on your block
Want a rich nigga come and pull up on your block
Bum bum, tell her get up out that Honda

[Chorus: Quavo]
Girl all the rich niggas, girl all the rich niggas, they want you
Girl all the rich niggas, girl all the rich niggas, they want you
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her

[Verse 2: YG]
You want a nigga to buy you a new ass, huh?
You want a nigga to pop out that tag, huh?
You want a nigga that know how to smash, huh?
You want a nigga to cop like he got that badge, huh?
You want a nigga that don't care about your past, huh?
Cause you been living NASCAR fast, huh?
Don't talk just buy that bag, huh
Buy that bag and get that ass, huh
She fuck with niggas by the plug (by the plug)
She got me going against my morals ('gainst my morals)
Oh this bitch lying, but she loyal (oh she loyal)
Oh this bitch want to be spoiled (she want to be spoiled)
That pussy got me tripping, need to wake up
How I let her sleep in my bed with all this makeup
That head game got me tripping, tripping
Can't believe she let herself get faithful

[Chorus: Quavo]
Girl all the rich niggas, girl all the rich niggas, they want you
Girl all the rich niggas, girl all the rich niggas, they want you
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her

[Bridge: Quavo]
She'll have you spending, spending, spending
Spending, spending, spending
Shit how you spending, spending, spending
Spending, spending, spending
She could make a rich nigga spend
She could make a rich nigga spend

[Chorus: Quavo]
Girl all the rich niggas, girl all the rich niggas, they want you
Girl all the rich niggas, girl all the rich niggas, they want you
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
Want her, all the rich niggas want her
