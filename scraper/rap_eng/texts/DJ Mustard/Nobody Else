[Verse 1]
Got that exclusive for you
Ain't nothing conclusive 'round here
'Cause you know I got you right where you need to be
Boy let me put it on you
It don't get no better, I promise
Let's cherish this moment
You have been chosen, fuck what she wanted

[Chorus]
You ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else
You ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else
'Cause what we got right here
Ain't nobody gonna understand, no no
But you still ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else

[Verse 2]
Always loyal from the instant that you walked my way
Always down for whatever, I got you baby
I got you fiending for me
It's really appealing to me
So that I reveal and flaunt it
'Cause you ain't allowed

[Chorus]
You ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else
You ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else
'Cause what we got right here
Ain't nobody gonna understand, no no
But you still ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else

[Outro]
Are you even listening?
I don't know about you but I really don't have time to waste
It's simple
It's my way or no way
