[Verse 1]
I've been waiting so long for this (waitin' for)
You see it's finally here
I was born for this shit (born for this sh-)

I'm just gonna help you see it
I don't care if you believe me, I'm 100 (I keep it 100)
So what if you got a problem
Yeah, I started from the bottom I'm a goner (I do my 100)
So if I see and I want it, I'ma grab it
You can bet it I'm a hustler (you know I be hustlin')
Better do it for you only cause nobody ain't gon' never give you nothing (never)

[Verse 2]
Busy days restless nights (I see her)
Ain't got no time for sleep (no time for sleep)
And I'm gon' keep this up (keep it up)
For at least another week
If it doesn't work out (if it doesn't work)
Then all I can blame is me (blame it on)
I don't mind though, that's alright (Ha)
