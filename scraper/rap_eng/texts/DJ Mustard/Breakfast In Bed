[Verse 1]
Couldn't sleep last night
Waking up in cold sweats, reading your last line
Now it's six in the morning
And I'm staring at the side of the bed that you're not in
I wonder where you're waking
Wonder if you're all alone
Don't you wish you could just be right here
Waking up where you belong

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you playin' hard to get?
Never had to wait this long before
Never been the type to fight for more
Waking up with no regrets
Isn't that what we do this for?
Isn't that what we do this for?

[Chorus]
So let me take you to my room, I'll give you what you need
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to take this to another level
Get you high off my intensity
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
Take you home with me
I just want to get you home with me (breakfast in bed)
I just want to give you that, I just want to give you that

[Verse 2]
Why you makin' me beg?
You ain't gotta do me like that, boy it ain't fair
I been trying my hardest
Last week you was on it and you wouldn't stop calling
I know what you're thinking
Don't want to make it serious
But we don't need a title for what we got here
And the rest is up to us

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you playin' hard to get?
Never had to wait this long before
Never been the type to fight for more
Waking up with no regrets
Isn't that what we do this for?
Isn't that what we do this for?

[Chorus]
So let me take you to my room, I'll give you what you need
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to take this to another level
Get you high off my intensity
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
Take you home with me
I just want to get you home with me (breakfast in bed)
I just want to give you that, I just want to give you that

[Verse 3]
On a silver platter when you wake up
High into my realm I wanna take ya
Got a lot of tricks, let me break you off
You know what time it is when I take it off
Boy you know I got a lot to offer, I ain't never gonna stop you when you wanna come get it
Just know I keep it real tight so you can stay for the night wake up, breakfast in bed

[Chorus]
So let me take you to my room, I'll give you what you need
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to take this to another level
Get you high off my intensity
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed

[Outro]
I don't want to sound crazy but
I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page
If it's me it's, it's only me
You and me
Here
