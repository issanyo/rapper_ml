[Intro]
Baby, I get so scared
Mustard on the beat ho!

[Verse 1]
Baby, I get so scared
I get so scared that you'll open my heart
Baby, I get so scared
I get so scared that you'll open your heart
Baby, I know you care
I know you care, you've been here from the start
That even though that things ain't clear
I'll stick with you, you're all I got

[Chorus]
You're everything I need and more
You're the thing I need to soar
But my trust issues collide with what I feel
Yeah, you're everything I need and more
You're the thing I need to soar
But my trust issues collide with what I feel inside

[Verse 2]
Baby, understand it
Understand that I've been hurt for a minute
Baby, understand it
Understand that you make me feel different
Baby, if I could I would step back into myself in an instant
Baby, can't we just relax
I know you're out there, give me a minute

[Chorus]
You're everything I need and more
You're the thing I need to soar
But my trust issues collide with what I feel
Yeah, you're everything I need and more
You're the thing I need to soar
But my trust issues collide with what I feel inside

[Bridge]
Nothing's gonna change
My thoughts won't go away
Nothing's gonna change
The thought won't go away
Nothing's gonna change
My thoughts won't go away
Nothing's gonna change
The thought won't go away

[Chorus]
You're everything I need and more
You're the thing I need to soar
But my trust issues collide with what I feel
Yeah, you're everything I need and more
You're the thing I need to soar
But my trust issues collide with what I feel inside
