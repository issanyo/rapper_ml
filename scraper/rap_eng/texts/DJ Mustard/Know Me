[Verse 1]
Everybody talking down, they don't really know me
Assume it's cause of weed that I got the name Stoney
Man fuck you, just listen to my story
Don't compare yourself to me cause I'm different category
I'd be a lying motherfucker if I said I never worried
Shit gets crazy, bitches start hate me, even try to play me
Damn that's cold shit
And I'm 500 degrees, check my old shit
Before I had a mic and I was rapping in my phone
Back when me and LB were always getting stoned
250 dollars on your wardrobe and I spent that on cologne
Got that Versace, Versace, cause the hoes love it
Used to a nobody but I'm known public
Clifton, V-M, Meridian, Waco yeah, yeah bitch they know, they know, they know
Aye!

[Verse 2]
Funny guys chase pussy till they go broke
Cause I chase the money and get the bitches that they don't poke
My music is all the pain that I won't show
If these hoes all the same, man I won't know
I don't listen to nobody except for the voice of reason
It ain't' a coincidence that I'm the only one speakin'
Fucked this one girl who said her race was Puerto Rican
Kept the lamp on when we did it and that's word to Cam Meekins
Wear so much Adidas that I need a damn endorsement
Looking like a boss but I don't act like I'm important
You didn't see me at the party, I was just recording
Put my name first by a rapper and the sign will be a more than
Don't mind my braggadocio
Eyes always small like I came from Tokyo
I can't stand a nosy ho
You don't need to know all the places Stoney go
I be fucking everywhere
Said fucking everywhere, literally
Haha
Time Alone 3 bitch
Aye!

[Verse 3]
Let a real man in ya life girl
You know the time is right girl
I'll do you so right girl
Show you what it's like girl
You ain't' never been treated so well
Kissing your Vicky secrets but I swear I won't tell
Yo body is my licorice, tell me if you ticklish
Broke up with my girlfriend and the truth is I don't miss the bitch
You like when I bite ya lips
I got bars all day, I be on that Rikers shit
18 year survivalist cause you know that life a bitch
I reject bullshit like a scientist
Getting booty like a pirate is
If you a fuck boy, I can't even speak to you
Everybody like Stoney this is what you need to do
Fuck that, I don't take advice, I take time
Disrespect the beat, yeah it's a hate crime
Said I go bananas and I heard it through the grapevine
I know all the haters jealous of my great mine
Y'all can all be Kiley Words, I won't give a fuck
I got peace and happiness and she just getting puffed
Bitch I go hard and try to beat my own best
Killing all these rapper's beats, it' Time Alone Tres
