[Verse 1]
I don't know who's living in my body
'Cause I don't recognize a thing about it
That don't even matter, I'm just glad I got into the party
So I can feel your music in my body
'Cause you the only out of everybody
Who can deal with all my ways
I know I got some ways
But you control the flame
So I just wanna stay right here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
It could be a room full of people, you still my sight
Look at how the whole world is searchin', but I got mine
It's emotional, uncontrollable, all I think about is you
So if the tears wanna flood my gates

[Chorus]
Let the water flow
Just let it fall out from my face
'Cause I never thought I'd ever hear me say
I just can't breathe without my baby
Ooh, you my baby
So come and kiss up on me
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance close

[Verse 2]
I don't even really care who knows it
Just keep me there, keep me in the moment
Seen a lot of things, but I never seen my spirit glowin'
The way you do me got me outta body
'Cause you the only out of everybody
Who gon' go out of the way to show me all the ways
Come control the flame
I just wanna stay right here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
It could be a room full of people, you still my sight
Look at how the whole world is searchin', but I got mine
It's emotional, uncontrollable, all I think about is you
So if the tears wanna flood my gates

[Chorus]
Let the water flow
Just let it fall out, out from my face
I never thought I'd ever hear me say
I just can't breathe without my baby
Ooh, come here, baby
So you can kiss up on me
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance close
So you can kiss up on me
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance

Just let it fall out, out from my face
I never thought I'd ever hear me say
I just can't breathe without my baby
Ooh, come here, baby
So you can kiss up on me
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance close
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance close
