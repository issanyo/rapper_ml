[Verse 1: King-D Tha Problem]
Ewwh King of 260
I swear that I had this title since the age of 16
I'm a dog in this game, I'm a mixed breed
That got drive like a mother lovin' 6 speed
I'm better then any rapper you compare me too
Cause I get to business boy like a pair of suits
Plus I stay on my toes like a pair of shoes
Boy I'm fly, You gon need a parachute
Look, I got Killer Gang wit me
We traveled city to city
Atlanta to Mississippi
We'll be in Paris soon
Even if you think that you gritty
Don't think that you can eff with me
Cause believe things'll get sticky
Boy I ain't scared of you
Nah and I never have been
Talk all this and that, none of it ever happened
Now you see the bigger pic, boy it ain't got a caption
I'm the best, I just say that to get reactions
Look I'm the rapper that you hope to meet
When performing I'm the rapper that you hope to see
I'm a role model I'm the rapper rappers hope to be
Cause when it comes to rapping
Ain't no other rapper close to me
That's how it's supposed be
Rappers that claim relevance
They all resemble ghost to me
I been runnin' this game and I need to soak my feet
And the best rapper award, yeah it goes to me
But you better supposably?
Sounds like some bull, are You a matador?
Here's the harsh truth, you don't matter boy
I'm on point like Kyrie... Cavaliers
Get out my face gimme space.. atmosphere
Haters keep talking it's BS I'm hearin'
These rappers is pissed off them boys on they feelings
Cause me I am dope I repeat I am dope
So I guess my promoters drug dealers drug dealing
I turned all my fans into druggies
Who do you love, I know you'll say you love me
You'll get a handshake if you lucky
It's bout to Chris Bosh
That means that it's 'bout to get ugly
I know you can feel it I know you can feel
Cause I heat it up like a skillet
Just know that I'm wit it just know that I'm wit
Boy I got the juice like I'm Bishop
That bull ish you speaking
Said that bull ish you speaking
My go-to response is whatever
Cause mother lovers never loved us.. remember
