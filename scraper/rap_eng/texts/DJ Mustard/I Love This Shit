I love this shit (I love this shit)
I love this shit (I love this shit)
I'm high as hell, drunk as fuck
I love this shit (I love this shit)
I love this shit (I love this shit)
I love this shit (I love this shit)
Got a pocket full of money, finna get me some head
I love this shit (I love this shit)

[Verse 1]
Everyday smoking my Cali, all about greens, St.Patty's
All my niggas get money, and all these bitches get nasty
Doing 'bout a buck on the Westside
Head in the whip, that's sex drive
Got a pocket full of presidents
Fucking hoes in Puff Daddy residence
Everybody getting torn
Just a couple more shots and these girls doing porn
I'm a Eastside nigga, wake up, start stunting
Ain't about money, then it ain't about nothing
Kiss my ring, I'm a Don
Only nigga ball like me named Lebron
Kiss my ring, I'm a Don
Only nigga ball like me named Lebron

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And it's nothing but bad ass girls and some millionaire niggas
Now it's looking like a party, 7 figures, 8 figures
Now you know I go hard like a porn star nipple
Shawty show a nigga love, bust it up and make it jiggle
It's the winning team, guillotine
Cut that thing til the cookie cream
Yeah, I done heard you'se a church girl
But you ain't never acting like a church girl
You should be grown, back it up like a dump truck
Let a real nigga go to work, girl
I am that nigga , so I act like I am that nigga
Met a bitch, heard she was Kevin's heart
Chopped her down, she done broke Kevin's heart
Club swinging like Tiger Woods
With a bunch of white girls like Tiger would

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't with the small talk
I just pull up on them hoes, let the car talk
I'm a mob boss, keep it lowkey
My girl got the fly bitch trophy
Big ol' ass out here flexing
Copped new boobs, what a very good investment
Straight facts, all my niggas look rich
That's on my life, they ain't fucking with the clique
