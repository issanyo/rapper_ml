[Intro: Belly]
Yeah
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Chorus: Belly]
Thinking you a bad bitch
Really, you just doing bad bitch
Fronted on me when I ain't had shit
Until I came up like a savage
Foreign girl with a accent (yuh)
She can barely fit that ass in the Aston (it's true)
You fronted on me when I ain't had shit (yuh)
Until I came up like a savage
I been up, 4 days
I ain't even sleep, 4 days
I been comin' down, 4 days
I would rather dream when I'm awake
Ayy, I ain't crashed in like 4 days
Liquor got me goin' more craze

I lie and say the world's yours, babe

[Verse 1: Belly]
I put my mama in a million dollar condo
I just made a million dollars off a convo
My gorilla strapped up like the gun show
Had this motherfucker lookin' like the congo
Uh, I made it out the jungle
If you hatin', bet this dick gon' reach your tonsils
Huh, bitch call me Papa Shango
I'ma beat, beat it up just like a bongo, hey

[Chorus: Belly]
Thinking you a bad bitch
Really, you just doing bad bitch
Fronted on me when I ain't had shit
Until I came up like a savage
Foreign girl with a accent (yuh)
She can barely fit that ass in the Aston (it's true)
You fronted on me when I ain't had shit (yuh)
Until I came up like a savage
I been up, 4 days
I ain't even sleep, 4 days
I been comin' down, 4 days
I would rather dream when I'm awake
Ayy, I ain't crashed in like 4 days
Liquor got me goin' more craze

[Verse 2: YG]
Belly, what's brackin'?
You fronted on me, fr-fr-fronted on me
That's the worse you could do when you done it on me
I fucked your friends 'cause you used to fuck my homies
She told her friends, "That nigga stunted on me"
Pull off in that Lambo
Burnin' rubber and my eyes low (bitch, back the fuck up)
I tell her she can fuck up my life
Just don't fuck up my cash flow
Walk up in this bitch, Louis, Gucci, lil Prada
Went from none to somethin', been like tada
When you hear how I ball, don't call
This is not your cheese, you get nada
You did me wrong when I ain't had shit
Got done like Ellie, you a bad bitch
I used to sleep on mattress
Now I got XO's on my tracklist

[Chorus: Belly]
Thinking you a bad bitch
Really, you just doing bad bitch
Fronted on me when I ain't had shit
Until I came up like a savage
Foreign girl with a accent (yuh)
She can barely fit that ass in the Aston (it's true)
You fronted on me when I ain't had shit (yuh)
Until I came up like a savage
I been up, 4 days
I ain't even sleep, 4 days
I been comin' down, 4 days
I would rather dream when I'm awake
Ayy, I ain't crashed in like 4 days
Liquor got me goin' more craze
