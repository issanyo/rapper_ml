[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
Straight dope with homie, bout' to do dirt
Got a plug with no money, can't buy work
Just hit me a lick I need mine first
All this dope make my mother fucking eyes hurt
Got weed then I got to the fucking pills
Start messing with coke 'cause I want a mil'
I remember when I won a million record deal
Now I'm in this bitch screaming fuck a record deal
Selling all these O's with my eyes closed
Ship it out with a mother fucking blindfold
Got a bitch to get the bread 'cause the bank playin'
Got a bitch to get the bread 'cause the bank playin'
Wish the police would come try me
Trapped out so I never got an ID
36 for 28, 16 for 30
Everything gotta go, bitch I'm in a hurry

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Yeah, dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Yeah, dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Yeah, dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, run it up
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, run it up
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Dope boy, count, count, dope boy, count, count

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Got a flex in that yellow like a 64
My nigga say he want a dub that's a 6 hoe
That's when I have some cool water that I whip slow
That's when I have some cool water that I whip slow
Fuck a bitch ya I'm in love with my scales
Fuck a Nemo tryna find these fish scales
Trying to wear the work out, we gon' stress that
'Til my daughter get the bread, he gon' fetch that
Tell the water whipping nigga what I'm best at
If I'm in the court room I won't confess that
Got a Benz outside but that's a hot box
But we working, work it down, that's a chop shop
Be riding from the city we finesse that
You better keep that Calico, might respect that
They gon' be kicking down the door where you rest at
They be coming, get your birds, where your nest at?

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Yeah, dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Yeah, dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Yeah, dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, run it up
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, run it up
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy, nigga
Dope boy, count, count, dope boy, count, count
