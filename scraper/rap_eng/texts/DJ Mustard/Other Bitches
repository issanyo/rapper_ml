[Verse 1]
Would it be a mistake if I put it down on you?
I'm not into games, I've been feeling lonely, so are you
We should do the damn thing
Let me hit the shower, are you comin' through?
Give me about an hour
And I'll be ready pop the pill, got super powers
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? We don't even speak, we just do the nasty
Thought we would make a family
Used to love to see my nigga happy, even though you brought baggage

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did everything you asked me but you was gettin' ratchet
Now we got damage, you let these other bitches have it

[Chorus] (x2)
You let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches have it

[Verse 2]
But what can I say? I just put it down on you
Don't want you to stay, I was feeling lonely, so are you
And we just did the thing
I'mma hit the shower, what you 'bout to do?
Now you looking sour
No we ain't getting back together, stop the flowers
This ain't like before, we don't even speak
Send a text message, but only about sexing
It could be messy, don't hand-cuff and don't harass me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to want a family but you was gettin' ratchet
Now we got damage, you let these other bitches have it

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You let these other bitches, you let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches, you let these other bitches have it
You let these other bitches, you let these other bitches have it

[Chorus]
