Count it up, count it up, count it up (count it)
Hit it from the back, pussy mount it up (mount it)
Tatted up, tat it up, tat it up (we tatted)
Can't none of my niggas get in Kanada (nope)
Bet it up, bet it up, bet it up (big bettin')
Tell 'em it's a go, nigga, set it up (nigga, set it)
The bust down, bust down, wet as fuck (it's wet)
Ayy Mustard, tell these niggas, "Catch up"
Count it up, count it up, count it up (count it)
Hit it from the back, pussy mount it up (mount it)

[Verse 1]
Ayy Mustard, tell them you can, "Catch up"
Ayy blood, tell them get their reps up
They psycho, tell 'em get their vest up
Ayy YG, tell 'em throw they set up
Tell them get their bands up, get their fans up

Tell 'em when I pull up, I'ma pull up with a hammer, nigga don't pat us
Tell 'em we gon' do it for my homie, just caught a case, he got caught on camera (we don't give a fuck, nigga)
My brazy lil niggas get on Instagram and tell you they gon' get at you
No I can't meet you in the right mind just so to write, lil nigga I'm a factor
No I ain't regular, nigga, I got hoes in the back, I'm Santa
