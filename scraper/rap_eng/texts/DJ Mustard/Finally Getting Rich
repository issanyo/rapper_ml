[Tag: Mustard on that beat ho]
[Chorus]
Finally getting rich on a bitch
I be out breaking down barriers
And I probably might switch on a bitch
But I would never change my character

[Verse 1]
Yea I know I got the gun charge
Niggas still Keep the pole tucked
Parked the lambo leave the doors up
Hundreds don't fold up
Niggas sniffin like a nose run
Gettin' high on they own stuff
Matter the plug late
But it was early like a lunch date
Bust down that's a bust break
Hungry but I just ate
Shootin dice, nigga touch cake
And the ice will keep the punch straight
Birds on the runway
Hoes doing blade work
Niggas having differences
They be from the same turf
I be on the rich way
Niggas wanna lane merge
She just sent me some pictures but it ain't her
Wait, Lamborghini in and up the Vegas streets
Silent Tennie's jumpin off the stage with me
No plan B, worked the plot A to Z
Broke the pot tryna pop before I...

[Chorus]
Finally getting rich on a bitch
I be out breaking down barriers
And I probably might switch on a bitch
But I would never change my character

[Verse 2]
I see my baby mama harder than a lot of you niggas
You see I lie to these hoes but I don't lie to the Millions
I made Atlantic Records give my an armlet
Shoot my shoot I miss the face I'm taking over offers it
Who got the West bet breaking I ain't talking rapping
I make them young niggas shoot don't cross my heading
I'ma ball to the bang nigga no laughing
So when petit hit the gram that's a coke action
See I stated with the grams then I fucked a few vans
Got the juice like I'm juice me an orgy
Let me act like the tea and big meat
Praise the Lord for the chopper your priest
And the snitch niggas call me a beast
I got rich and I'm still in the streets
Must repeat this
Blue faced like I'm sea sick
Me and baby Dime on a re-shit

[Chorus]
Finally getting rich on a bitch
I be out breaking down barriers
And I probably might switch on a bitch
But I would never change my character

[Bridge]
Finally getting rich right in front of you
Share with the clique that's what brothers do
We just hit a lick with the W
We just hit a lick that's a W
Finally getting rich right in front of you
Share with the clique that's what brothers do
We just hit a lick with the W
We just hit a lick that's a W

[Chorus]
Finally getting rich on a bitch
I be out breaking down barriers
And I probably might switch on a bitch
But I would never change my character
