[Verse 1: Iamsu]
Gold all on my neck, Bathing Ape on my back
Even though I'm lookin from the front, I can still see that back
I got racks on racks, no I'm not YC
I'm hyphy like Keak Da Sneak
Please don't creep by me, don’t try me
I be on freak, geeked off that brain I receive
All this fly shit, I bought came with receipts
This ain’t no game, don't be playin with me
All these bad bitches be stayin with me
Beat the beat up like I'm Roy in that ring
Enough of me rapping, gon' let that boy sang

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
I had one, two, three too many
I'm fucked up, four chicks with me
I'm loud, took about 5 shots
6 bottles I just copped
Twisted, turnt up, 24/7
That's more bad bitches I’m getting
They know I hit em and quit em
And go past what they came here for
Baby can I see you make yo ass drop?
I'mma let the Rose bottles pop
I'mma sip this Roc, baby don’t stop
Cause yo body on fire, you too hot

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't feel my face
I'm so numb, I'm so wasted
So dumb, I'm shit faced
Just in case I don't make it

[Chorus]
Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin
Take my trees, nigga I'm gone
Take my keys, nigga it's nothing
One of these chicks is taking me home

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
That little red bone said she’s taking me home
Fine ass friend said she coming along
Love in the morning, so I'm fuckin em strong
I'mma beat em to sleep then I’m gone in the morning
Hold up! I tell a bitch roll up
Before I gotta roll out all I do is turn up
Turn down fuck what, need another drink
Baby go and pour up, money hungover
So you know I gotta throw up the fetti so that they know that I’m ready
To get em poppin and droppin the party never be stopping
Cause I be keepin em rocking, you all these bitches be choosin
Cause now they see that I’m winning like I’m allergic to losing and I

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't feel my face
I'm so numb, I'm so wasted
So dumb, I'm shit faced
Just in case I don't make it

[Chorus]
Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin
Take my trees, nigga I'm gone
Take my keys, nigga it's nothing
One of these chicks is taking me home

[Verse 4: Problem]
Ro-Rolex shinin – call it perfect timing
Many is fresh, my baby's big timing
Like a giant clock, club taking big shots
Like a giant Glock, bitch got high then she made her booty drop
While I watch it like the cops, do the niggas in the hood
Smell it fore I light it so you know my weed good
Fly like a pilot. from the same town as Suge
Concealing big D, she gon take it like a crook
Just make one thing understood
You nothing without paper like books
Word to my nigga double A, everybody's under me
Make bitches come, anda, ¡Ándale!
When I’m digging in that skeezer, no soda – that squeezer
I'm caking, no Pam, bros gone off that sizzurp
Crazy ass peep make these bitches go beserk
All my niggas makin reserve, Problem

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't feel my face
I'm so numb, I'm so wasted
So dumb, I'm shit faced-ed
Just in case I don’t make it

[Chorus]
Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin
Take my trees, nigga I'm gone
Take my keys, nigga it's nothing
One of these chicks is taking me home
Take my drink, nigga I'm buzzin
Take my trees, nigga I'm gone
Take my keys, nigga it's nothing
One of these chicks is taking me home
