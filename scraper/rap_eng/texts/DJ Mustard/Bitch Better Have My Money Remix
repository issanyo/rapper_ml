[Verse: Bravioso]
Have my money on deck, She pull it out of her chest
All about them dollars, Im hollering out WEST
Where if you got a problem, we solving it with the tech
She know before I call, she better hit me with a text
This real G though, Watch the money fall chips, crunch, fritos
Bithes wherever we go, Im balling out with my people
So many fucking bottles Im running on ground zero
Told her fuck it up, She made it jump like BINGO
If I dont see the money, chop it up with the eagle
I dont miss like Dwight from the free throw
AndIf you got enough, She'll probably give you a preview
You broke niggas will never get to the see through
Im balling with bad bitches thats fucking and barely legal
Pussy tighter than speedos, little momma from Encino
Let her carry heat that bark like Tido
I ain't really tripping because the heat I carry threefold
So, So, So
Its back to them dollars, Told her bag up the squala
The same money she gone follow
She said dont judge blaming it on her father
But I dont nigga baby, Im just being honest
Ima sit back and light me up a pound of chronic
Cutting it up, breaking it like Im hooked on phonix
Money up and Down
But let tell you whats a promise, HUH

[Hook]
Bitch better have my money (x8)
My, My, My (x3)
