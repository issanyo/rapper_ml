[Verse 1: Andrew Sam]
Blue and white 'til we die, it's the El Monte Lions
Attempt to keep up, or lose your breath tryin'
It was just one race, why you breathe like you dyin'?
This is our year, 2013 no lyin'
You stopped at 2012, guess that makes you the Mayans
We'll always take first, your only hope is tyin'
Just accept defeat, catch your breath and start sighin'
It's okay to lose, so long as you ain't cryin'

[Chorus: Andrew Sam]
Straight out the blocks, leavin' others in the dust
Never satisfied cause first place is a must
Make it look easy as we hop over hurdles
Distance makin' others look slower than turtles
Raise up the bar cause we fly like rockets
Too strong for shot put, other schools can't top it
Jumpin' too long, they just don't measure up
Vaultin' too high, other schools look like chumps
Straight out the blocks, leavin' others in the dust
Never satisfied cause first place is a must
Make it look easy as we hop over hurdles
Distance makin' others look slower than turtles

[Verse 2: Andrew Sam]
Take the outside lane cause you need the head start
When we compete, our fans know it's an art
Don't cross the chalk; homie, stay in your lane
This is our year, no more losses and pain
Don't drop the baton like you always drop the soap
In the dome with the put, let's hope you don't choke
I heard your school's name / Then I laughed, you're a joke
We've been warmed up, maybe you need a coat
Sharpen your spikes cause you needa get a grip
Understand we're the best, shut up and don't trip
You're gonna get burned cause in Track, you're just ash
When the gun shot goes off, we're gone in a flash

[Chorus: Andrew Sam]

[Bridge: Andrew Sam]
All-weather or dirt, the results are the same
You're trying too hard, we win with no pain
So when we're through, just remember our name
Cause we are too beast; not weak, can't be tamed and...

[Chorus 2: Andrew Sam]
Raise up the bar cause we fly like rockets
Too strong for shot put, other schools can't top it
Jumpin' too long, they just don't measure up
Vaultin' too high, other schools look like chumps
Straight out the blocks, leavin' others in the dust
Never satisfied cause first place is a must
Make it look easy as we hop over hurdles
Distance makin' others look slower than turtles

[Outro: Andrew Sam]
Sprinters, distance runners, jumpers, vaulters, and throwers
We're all lions / El Monte Track Anthem...
