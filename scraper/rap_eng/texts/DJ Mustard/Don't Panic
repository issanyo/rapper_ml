[Intro: French Montana]
Don't panic
Nigga, don't panic
Don't panic
Nigga, don't panic

[Verse 1: Sneakbo]
In the club, smoking marijuana
I just wanna party, fuck the drama
Boy, you know I came here with the hammer
Try me and catch 6 from the ladder
Ciroc bottle fucking up my bladder
I'm with [?] come and holla
And I ain't talking bitches from the manor
I'mma get girl twisted, something like a spanner
I see a couple bitches over there
Tell the bodyguard "bring em over here"
Throwing money for your pussy in the air
You gon' have my whole squad like Bo, she the best
My pretty brown ting with a round ting
Your arse looking like it need a pounding
I'll book a room at [?] West, how that sounding?
I'm just tryna get her wetter than a fountain
Big dick, bigger than a mountain
Girl, you could come see it if you're doubting
Or ask all the girls in the south, bitch
If my dick's mix up, it got em fighting
Can't stick around, I be skating
Real nigga getting paid quick
Dodging bullets like the Matrix
Come back [?] I'm on that bait shit
[?] bitch posing on the pavement
Indirects when I see em, they don't say shit
They don't say shit
Boy, I flex on a nigga if he's hating

[Hook: French Montana]
Don't panic
We're just getting started nigga, don't panic
Real niggas getting cake
Watch them fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic
We're just getting started nigga, don't panic
But don't panic, don't panic
We're just getting started nigga, don't panic

[Verse 2: M Darg]
Darg's back, who let the darg out?
We don't swing [?] guys this ain't arms house
Give a bitch dick and send her to young Darg's house
Better be Bo tryna run in Darg's house
Big machine go dudududu
Some lame guys [?] I wish I coulda shoulda
Most thing I do, I go and make wood up
Female [?]
Jetski, jetski
Full speed to the max, no Pepsi
Four Ps to the sack, nothing less, G
40 in the MAC, lick out your chestpiece
Drop with it, roll with it
In the party with your soaker and got soaked with it
Got poked by your friend, I think he [?] it

[Verse 3: Grizzy]
Look at us, look at them
You ain't banging guns, well get some ordered them
Thinking 'bout the days we used to bully them
But now I fuck the gyal and get the pussy wet
Now they wanna beef, I tell em move
You ain't slapping guns or done a move
Always sleep with thingies in my room, man
I let the something ride if there's any funny moves
Still up in the bando, come and look
You ain't really bad, you're just a crook
My youngers with the flickies wanna jook
Heard them niggas wanna try, I just wish a nigga would
Busy getting money, I can't look at you
Them niggas think they're fly because their hoodie new
All my 150 so savage
Don't panic

[Verse 4: S-Wavey]
Trap trap nigga, don't get no sleep
Please stop now, you ain't slapped no heat
If I say we got dum dums
I'm talking 'bout bando, come and bang this heat
These niggas think it's all a fucking joke
Catch these niggas slipping, they gon' catch a smoke
And if my niggas don't hold them
[?]'ll come on through, come and soak him
Catch me with Darg and Hasty
44 long, no safety
Badboy prick best blaze me
S-Wave, head blazed, shoot face, G

[Hook]
