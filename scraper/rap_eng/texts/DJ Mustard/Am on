[Pre-Hook]
Rolling with the goons
Downing all the booze
Breaking all the rules
We ain't sleeping
Ball into the club
Shorties wanna fuck
We gone puff puff
Till we hit the ceiling

Till we done it all we ain't sleepin
Uhn Uhn X2

[Verse 1]
When I get on the mic I come alive
When I see a hater I  whine up and drive
Shorty forming boti
In the room she gets naughty
She spoilt she rotten
So we kick it to the morning
No pits no stopping
By tomorrow I have forgotten
Put feelings over nothing
Can't send we stunning
Shorty bugging calling talking about loving
Am like bitch hold on am tryna coup my foreign

[Hook]
I saw her so lonely hmmm
I put her on low key
She tell me nagode
Never watching the game am on it
These niggas more coward than judas
Wanna test am goons "kai wawa'
Yh
And now we underneath the covers no strings but we fucking like we lover Yh uhnu x2

Got me like oh lord am on in this grind
Shorty steady bursting my mind X2

[Verse 2]
Purples drank in my cap
Eyes go red like a  nigga blood shoot
Ohh got the flow of a live wire
In the morning we gone nack  tired
People wishing dead e go back fire
Amma still tell my story like a town cryer
See am aim on the mic is to murder it thoroughly
Living my live some can question it morally

[Hook]
Saw her so lonely hmmm
I put her on low key
She tell me nagode
Never watching the game am on it
These niggas more coward than judas
Wanna test am goons "kai wawa'
Yh
And now we underneath the covers no strings but we fucking like we lover Yh uhnu x2

Got me like oh lord am on in this grind
Shorty steady bursting my mind X2

[Pre-Hook]
Rolling with the goons
Downing all the booze
Breaking all the rules
We ain't sleeping
Ball into the club
Shorties wanna fuck
We gone puff puff
Till we hit the ceiling

Till we done it all we ain't sleepin
Uhn Uhn X2

Shorty tell me what to say now
I go carry you fly away now
Abj iv'e been reppin
Stay turnt no stressing
Bush burning ever second of the day now X2
