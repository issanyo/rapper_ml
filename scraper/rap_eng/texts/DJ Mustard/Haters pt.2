They acting like crazy

(Verse 1)
Free-styling to free-styling
Free my brother DJ for Crack Wild N'
It's not my fault he ain't had the father
It's not my fault he was sipping out the bottle
You is Lame, you a shame
I should be on the hall of fame
But most you wanna be rappers
Can't even get into the game
Do I have to refrain?
Deshawn think he a GOAT
And yes this is a diss track
My first diss track of all time
And your not coming back
Little, little, Jalen thinks he's a boss
Judging my songs
Like he's Rick Ross
I song with NBAYoungBoy my brother you think I'm false?
Watch me go and catch another track with him
But this one is 6 minutes long!

(Hook)
Forget them haters
Forget them haters
Forget them haters
Yeah yeah
Forget them haters
They acting like crazy
Cuz they ain't got tators
They acting like crazy
Cuz I got the cake up (repeat)
