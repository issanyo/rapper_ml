[Verse 1: Preme]
Both middle fingers to the force
I just left port in a Porsche
And I always chose money over war
Still ready for the beef but don't talk to the pork
Just a young nigga from the way getting paid
We been living but I die for the homies any day
And they love me from the 6 to the Bay
Roll a nigga over in the Rolls if he in the way
I'm loaded, racked up loaded
Back up nigga, I'm way too frozen
Hundred pill rolling bet she love me by the morning
A-list bitch but her name ain't important
If they buy a brick in my city I import it
Would shout out my connect but the feds might quote it
No 9 to 5 cause that shit look boring
New whip, new bitch and them hoes both foreign
Woah, middle fingers to the cops
Bitch I'm the boss on my block
My little bro changed since the day he got shot
Bandana and the hammer now we look like Pac
Just trying to make a million with this pen, get my niggas out the pen
Build a dozen niggas [?] and I do this shit again
Man I only got brothers, I ain't never had friends
Getting dollars with them niggas that ain't never had cents
Oh no

[Hook: Preme]
Fuck all them niggas they dodging
All of them bitches is my bitches
All of my niggas is mobbing
[?]
We loaded
Fuck all them niggas, my niggas is loaded
We loaded
Fuck, man we get it, we loaded
Fuck all them niggas we mobbing
I turn from your bitch to my bitch
And a nigga gon' try shit
Listen lil nigga go backwards
We loaded
Fuck all them niggas, my niggas is loaded
We loaded
Fuck, man we get it, we loaded

[Verse 2: YG]
No white T's anymore, they don't check ID's anymore
Got a bitch named Christian Dior, cause all the bitch wear is Christian Dior
Catch a nigga ridin' by myself
Got the nine on me, I ain't really ridin' by myself
I don't need help, I count mine by myself
On a mission to the money, I designed by myself
I'm loaded, racked up loaded
Backup nigga, watch how I blow this
This shit come and go, hocus pocus
Gotta keep a hundred some plays in motion
She tryna fuck all day and get loaded
I wanna fuck two, but I'm tryna get focused
Million dollars in there, what a nigga grossing?
Used to kick down the front door, now the door open
Ooh, we don't fuck with the opps, baby tryna fuck up the knots
Oh, and if you fuck up tonight, we gon' have to jack off the Glock
I'm just tryna cop a house in the hills, couple mills
Can I live?, big steak on the grill
In the safe half a mill, P Reign 4 hundred
OVO 4 hundred, six side so trill

[Hook: Preme]
Fuck all them niggas they dodging
All of them bitches is my bitches
All of my niggas is mobbing
[?]
We loaded
Fuck all them niggas, my niggas is loaded
We loaded
Fuck, man we get it, we loaded
Fuck all them niggas we mobbing
I turn from your bitch to my bitch
And a nigga gon' try shit
Listen lil nigga go backwards
We loaded
Fuck all them niggas, my niggas is loaded
We loaded
Fuck, man we get it, we loaded
