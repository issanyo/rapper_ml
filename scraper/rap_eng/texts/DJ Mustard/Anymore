[Chorus]
You don't need to call anymore
Don't fuck with you at all anymore
You don't need to stall anymore, anymore
We don't keep in touch anymore
'Cause we ain't in love anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

[Verse 1]
Used to be the one for me baby, baby
Used to be the one, used to be the one, be the one, babe
You been switching up on me lately, lately
You been switching up, you been switching up, switching up, babe

[Pre-Chorus]

Pull up in the luxe all black, all black
Crush up this bud, like yeah, yeah, yeah

Got me criss-cross, fall back, fall back
Told you from the jump

Need to let it go
Different episode, same old show

Make these bitches rich all cash, all cash
Toke on this blunt like yeah, yeah, yeah
Without you baby

[Chorus]
You don't need to call anymore
Don't fuck with you at all anymore
You don't need to stall anymore, anymore
We don't keep in touch anymore
