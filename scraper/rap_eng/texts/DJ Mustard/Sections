[Verse 1: Hurricane Chris]
Bad bitches over here
Come on girl let me tell me something in your ear
Pockets on fool, I got a lot of cash
Le mama says she wanna kick it
Karate class
You can tell I'm a boss, I ain't gotta brag
Hit the mall like a dog, got it poppin' tails
Ty Dolla $ign
Hurricane Chris
Shoe stick get your chick and I can't miss
Tell that waitress I need more bottles
And pass me some water so I can roll harder
Standing on a couch in a vip
Hoes takin' on the closure, we got freaks
Got a yellow blonde bitch, lookin' hella fine
He ain't talking about money, nigga never mind
Quarter million dollar whips sitting outside
And when I get in the bed I'd be going life
You ain't talking bout money

[Verse 2: Hurricane Section]
Yeah
She poured up in a new Benz
Looking like a dime piece with two friends
And that two friends looked too sexy
So deep in the club, load me two sections, yeah
Tell that drop it to the floor like a damn fool
Can you make it wet, wet like a swimming pool??
Gotta have a nice body and a cute face
Pull up in that Maserati looking too straight
Err'body in my click get big money
And when I leave I'ma leave with your woman
Have you ever seen a nigga spend like fifty grand in the club one night?
Blowing money like a fan, I'm drunk
And I ain't gon' lie, feeling like about to faint
But I ain't gon' stop
6 shots of Patron got a nigga straight way
Take it to the head, I ain't even gotta chase it
I'm drunk
Got a nigga straight wasted
