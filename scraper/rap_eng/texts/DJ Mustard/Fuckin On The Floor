Pulling on your ponytail

Fucking on the floor

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]

One thing is that you know is that I'm trying to get you
I know what to do with you
Yeah, got an ass like a porno star
And everybody know who you are
And fucks with you the long way
You keep making other Annies hate

So leave that, Annie where you at?

You wanna be my little freak

So leave that, Annie where you at?
Annie I'm tripping and I'm pulling on your

[Verse 3: Yea Dat]

Look, I'm like "All I know is this ratchet"
We fucking on the floor like we don't need a mattress
She don't do gymnastics but she be doing backflips
When I put that D in her cause I put it deep in her
EML girl we be on some ratchet shit
Trying to turn a classy chick into a ratchet bitch
Codeine sipper baby I'm an activist
And I beat that pussy up on some active shit
Damn Annie look at all that ass and shit
Make a nigga wanna hit it from the back and shit
Whole team winning baby like tag we it
Finna' change my name to air cause I'm maxin' shit
