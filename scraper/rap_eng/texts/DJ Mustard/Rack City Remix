[Verse]
Starter hat, Starter Jacket Starter Blues
Everything Starter but the shoes
J's on my feet like the alphabet
Flipping to the money, Ima acrobat
Big money, add on that
Make it fall, Avalanche
Vintage Gang homie, Lot of snapbacks
Touch the hat get back slapped (Lowkey)
Tinted windows can't see me like a ghost
Ballin D. Rose, Man Kelo
Stuffing bread in laundry bags, stacking three loads
Ocean Gang splashing, Grab your rain coat
Its OG, Triple Splash
BBC Gorilla bath, that's a Bathing ape
I invented swag
Im taking shots better call a cab
Im Lowkey, zoned out
Out my face, skate Roll Bounce
Wait until my shows be sold out
Fake dudes claiming I was their old pals
Im scary, Im something to run from
Noluv, Trust none
Im one one
She on me
If its money let a homie hold some
