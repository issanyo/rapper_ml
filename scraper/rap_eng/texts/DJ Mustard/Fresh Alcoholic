Throwing up on a fresh set of Air Yeezys
Passing out watching my new 50 inch tv
Fresh alcoholic (fresh alcoholic)
Fresh alcoholic (fresh alcoholic)
Can't find my iPhone need someone to call it
Big fucking bottle, no money in my wallet
Fresh alcoholic (fresh alcoholic)
Fresh alcoholic (fresh alcoholic)

I start the night with a 1.75
And by the end of the party I'm probably barely alive
I'm probably spittin on your floor, ain't no way I could drive
So if I get kicked out, well then I'm hitchin a ride
And I arrive at the next party with my man Zack Black
Check my iPhone looks like I got a snapchat
From King BB with some girls wearin snapbacks
Then after that I pull the Svedka up outta my backpack
Around now is when I'm playing some pong
But watch where you're standing, girl, I'm wearing brand new lebrons
And if you think that you're gettin a pull, then you're dead wrong
Cuz I spent like all I had on this bottle, I'm drinkin til it's gone
I represent that TMC shit on the daily
So whether drunk or sober, bitch, you can't play me
I'll puke and rally in the middle of verses
So fresh to death when we die we'll leave in nike hurses
Wake up grab a drink and yes, I'm ready to go
Throw on some clothes, lace the jays and yes I'm ready to roll
Optimistic alcoholic, my glass is half full
Looking the freshest, so hella hoes I am ready to pull

[King BB]
Pull up to the party, backpack full of brews
Handle full of captain, so the drinks I pick and choose
J rush playing pong, had to tell him the news
That being a fresh alcoholic, it just ain't easy to do
But I do it so naturally
Stumbling about slurring stupid and drunken babbling
Turnt the fuck up, no idea what is happening
All I hear is "Gosh, that drunk guy's so dazzling"
As the clock strikes 3
Stumbling back home is where you could probably find me
Tried to call a cab, but too drunk to remember the street
Didn't really matter anyway, cause my wallet was empty
