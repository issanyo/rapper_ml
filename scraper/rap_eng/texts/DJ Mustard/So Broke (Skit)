[Interlude: Drakeo]
Really?
I’d hate to be you
Standing round all day waiting for food
I’m hitting gates and these masons
Thinking what I spent on my shoes
Is mind blowing
Niggas looking at my watch
Like clearly I have the time for it
But if you try me
You won’t have these thoughts
To put his mind to it
Your position is ugly but don’t blame me
You nigags had the audacity
To try to look at me shady
Just crazy!
I can never be you
And you can never be me
Sincerely yours
Billy
