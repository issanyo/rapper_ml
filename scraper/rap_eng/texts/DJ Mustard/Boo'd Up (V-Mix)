Feelings, I can't lie I'm in my feelings
Because you're so perfect and you're honest, promise

You gon' make me pull up on your father in the coop, yeah yeah
Make a move if it's cool marry you, yeah yeah
God i want to thank you, thank you for sending an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
Ouhhh, girl you make it hard for me to see another woman
You got my heart, could have it all if you want it
Ain't gotta ask me when it comes to you
Ouuhhh, girl you make a nigga feel like a king when you come through
Won't let them bitches come in between girl I gotchu
Yeah yeah lay your head right here

[Chorus]
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up, said I put that on my mama, true love
Since i found you, it just won't stop it goes
Ba-dum, boo'd up

Turn off my phone no distractions when I'm with you
You gon' get that text in the morning

Ouhhh, girl you make it hard for me to see another woman
You got my heart, could have it all if you want it
