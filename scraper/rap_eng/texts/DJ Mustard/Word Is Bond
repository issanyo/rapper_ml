[Intro: YG]
You niggas thought it was over
Oh shit
I told you niggas we might get this money
I told you niggas shit was ‘bout to get ugly
I told you niggas don’t be sleeping on me
I told you niggas
Ratatata-Oh
Uh, look, uh, uh

[Verse 1: YG]
If I told you I was back, nigga that's what it is
I run the left side of the map and that's what it is
My homie got that pack and that's what it is
If you ain't trying spend that hot box then that's what it is
If you don't want to get that money and act like a bitch
I'm the one get the money and pass it out to my clique
Cause everybody know I'm rich
Everybody everybody everybody know I'm rich
Put the squad on my back (squad)
Google Maps will tell yo ass where it's at
Backseat full of bitches
You can say a nigga riding with that Mack
Oh, life still krazy
Newborn baby, niggas I don't know still hate me
Facts never tripping
Personal message to them niggas, I'm shit on y'all vicious

[Hook: YG]

[Verse 2: YG]
If I said I got it, I did that
Said we gon profit, I did that
My career you wanna follow cause I did that
Your favorite top model, I done did that
Had to put the black gates where I live at
Shooters on deck try to pull up you gon' get jacked
Mind of a maniac
Since I got popped, I purchased about 50 straps
If I mention yo name, I probably put you on
So I ain't talkin' bout no orders 'til the contract closed
Lookin' in the mirror like "Am I wrong?"
Nah it's business nigga don't take it personal
They gave my gang all my money
So when it get ugly shit ain't funny
Promise I'mma make it, hate me or love me
And I promise I'mma stay the same with this money

[Hook: YG]

My word my word
My word my word, my word my word
My word my word
My word my word, my word my word

[Verse 3: Slim 400]
If I told you I rep Bompton nigga, then that's what it is
If I felt to push a line nigga, then that's what it is
Bow down in none situation, I been with the shit
I'm the one niggas watch so y'all know what it is
My blique ain't going nowhere, my niggas started this shit
Saying everything but B's, now the industry bang
Niggas better get credit or get hit by the gang
And it really is Bompton, fuck who dissing my name
Sounding good on these tracks, started calling my phone
Go and get you a hit, and leave a nigga alone
Cause the shit y'all talk will have you sleeping alone
When I fire, I fire - I'm try'na tip that dome
Really with the shit, fuck who try'na play me
Really offa' Spruce, nickname from the homies
Posted with the .40, fat-ass Rollie
You ain't from Bompton if you don't know me

[Hook: YG]
My word is bond

My word my word
My word my word, my word my word
My word my word
My word my word, my word my word
My word is bond
