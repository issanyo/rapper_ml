[Verse 1]
I remember the time nigga, shit was just all cool
Wearin' them blue chucks, C-walkin' at the school
Mackin' on all the hoes, worry about shoes and clothes
Hittin' that first block, see how shit goes
Niggas is Crip tho, niggas is gettin' dough
Smokin' a lil weed, hittin' you first [?]
Niggas get put on like "fuck it let's do it bro"
Me and my day 1's, stayin' with dope and guns
Niggas is turnt up, niggas is havin' fun
Like this shit all games, niggas ain't killin' none
Shit start gettin' real, homies just got kill
Wars is poppin' off, snitches is takin' deals
House get [?] nigga, look at my grandma feel
Find my stash but she like "nah ya playin' that there"
Uh, I was just a lil nigga and I'm in too deep
Give me time to think aye

[Hook]
Tell me how would you feel
If the judge give you 25 to a L
Tell me how would you feel
When they don't even let you see your own peeps
Tell me how would you feel
At nights can't even go to sleep
Tell me how would you feel
Tell me how would you
Feel


[Verse 2]
Lil niggas always on the block
Knucklehead neighbor gave a fuck about the cops
And his pops was a OG listenin' to OD's
Pop tellin' [?] you just smoked that AZ
I guess crack was the trend back then
Cause a nigga got in and they ain't being back since
He a little nigga but he seein' all this grown shit
Pistols on the counter, 2 clips and 'bout 4 bricks
Now he livin' wild, bitches love his style
He ain't worried about the jail he know it comes with his lifestyle
Never leave your 9 at home it ain't no good there
Try to take the right road, a nigga never been there
Sold to the wrong nigga now I'm sittin' in a jail
Now I'm writtin' letters talkin' bout how I'm a changed man
When I get out and it's back to the same plan
Rocks in my mouth and I'm runnin' if I see the man
Aye!


[Hook]
Tell me how would you feel
If the judge give you 25 to a L
Tell me how would you feel
When they don't even let you see your own peeps
Tell me how would you feel
At nights can't even go to sleep
Tell me how would you feel
Tell me how would you
Feel
