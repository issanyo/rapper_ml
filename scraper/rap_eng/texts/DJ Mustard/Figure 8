Mustard on that beat ho

[Hook]
They throwin' paper at me rainin' like a thunder storm
Actin' like kiddies in the candy store, the candy store
They stealin' money out their girlfriend's drawer, their girlfriend's drawer
Just watch me
Shake that figure 8
Move slow, drop low, shake that ass like an earthquake
Shake that figure 8
So fast, make it clap, baby feed 'em that cake cake
Shake that figure 8
Move slow, drop low, shake that ass like an earthquake
So fast, make it clap, baby feed 'em that cake cake
Eight eight eight eight eight eight
That figure eight eight eight eight

[Verse 1]
You wanna bomb chick? Well it cost Nick
Walk in with that oochie wally wally
I be wildin out, thugged out, I bang bang
He wanna eight figure, I'm over here twistin' fingers
Mad set signs thrown out my car window
He wanna know what I mean when I say I'm winnin'
Then my chain spoke to 'em like bling bloan
Nick won't stop blowin' up my phone now
Oh, straight balla business
And I won't stop trickin' cause I got it (Ughhh)
That some balla business
And I won't stop trickin cause I got it (Ughhh)
They feelin it
Got a real chick listening when I'm speaking it (Ughhh)
Now a real chick speakin'
Let them other fake chicks know it's real outchea
No mistaken

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'mma make you want it, night and the mornin'
Try and not to lose your mind
Sugar honey iced tea, that's what you gon scream
Happens to me everytime
They talkin bout who that, look at that nasty girl, that nasty girl
Who that thinkin' she run the world, she run the world
Who that look at that nasty girl
Yea you know you want it, you want it, you want it, you want it
