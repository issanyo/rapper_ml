[Chorus: Starrah]
Rollin' through my city, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers out the window
Push a buck 50, blowin' swishers out the window
Can't nobody fuck with me, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers out the window
Police finna hate it, blowin' swishers out the window
Everywhere we go we faded, blowin' swishers out the window
Rollin' through my city, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers
Blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers
Blowin' swishers out the window

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay, I'm ridin' through the city blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers like nintendo
Extendo, the blunt lit long like a limo
Puff puff pass, give it back like a rental
For real though, man this whole thing I can face it
For real though, these bitches caught the vapers
Hot box nigga need a lil' ventilation
It's motherfuck paper, this nigga segregation
Ugh, roller rolled up in the rover
Attitude like the one time it never pulled me over
Got the tool in the backseat, in case these niggas try me
Put the tool in the stash spot case you hear a siren

[Chorus: Starrah]
Rollin' through my city, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers out the window
Push a buck 50, blowin' swishers out the window
Can't nobody fuck with me, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers out the window
Police finna hate it, blowin' swishers out the window
Everywhere we go we faded, blowin' swishers out the window
Rollin' through my city, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers
Blowin' swishers out the window

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Since the beginning blowin' swishers first time that I did it
And a nigga felt like Mike Tyson when I hit it
Roll up just like M Bison when I spend it
All my last $20 bet a young nigga spend it
For real though stuff it like a pillow
Say she don't smoke but she make me pop a pill though
My eyes all red and them bitches sittin' real low
It's me and Mike Avila, who got a cigarillo
Police finna hate it, I'm rollin' so sadated
I'm rollin' with no plate, you pull me over niggas skatin'
Roll bounce, Bow Wow size blunt as tram
You been holdin' on that swisher for a minute
I'm just sayin' nigga

[Chorus: Starrah]
Rollin' through my city, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers out the window
Push a buck 50, blowin' swishers out the window
Can't nobody fuck with me, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers out the window
Police finna hate it, blowin' swishers out the window
Everywhere we go we faded, blowin' swishers out the window
Rollin' through my city, blowin' swishers out the window
Blowin' swishers
