[Hook: Que]
For the cheese like nachos
I'll pull up on a nigga pronto
Ridin' for the guapo, it's just me and my vato
If money ain't the convo, tell me what the hell you call for
As soon as the block close, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm talkin' bout bald head, tatted up ese's
CV70's and infred tres
Hold up, they ain't never on that bitch shit
Fuck a chicklet, they on the corner with that biscuit
Called 'em up like (brrp), nigga need that (brrp)
Said that money good, my partner pulled up like (skrrt)
He ain't playin' wit' it, that pistol permanent, he stayin' wit' it
Yeah, he tryna live his dreams, so he layin' wit' it
Uh and I helped him cross the border, now he finally seen his daughter
And his vato just got shot up, he hit the block and all you heard was
Blocka, blocka, blocka, blocka!

[Hook: Que]
For the cheese like nachos
I'll pull up on a nigga pronto
Ridin' for the guapo, it's just me and my vato
If money ain't the convo, tell me what the hell you call for
As soon as the block close, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Que pasa homes, I'm caked up, need a loan
I'm talkin' pesos, nigga leave me the fuck alone
I'm talkin' big chips, nachos
Rappin' bout another nigga life, well it's not yours
Catch me out, G'd up, mobbin' like the cholo
52 rounds in the chop, nigga YOLO
Get right, get you what you want like the Costco
Nigga pullin' up on a chicken like at Roscoe's
Black hammer, bandana, yellow box, arm hammer
It came out Laredo, sent 'em out to Atlanta
Me and my nigga talk sour cream and nachos
Fuck wit' my nigga, I'll knock the beef up out your taco

[Hook: Que]
For the cheese like nachos

It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos

[Verse 3: Que]
Headed to the guapo, it's just me and my vato
Ridin' wit' the heat on, in the winter, wit' the top gone
For the cheese like a nacho, I'll knock the beef out your taco
When it come to Velveeta, I do not play bout my peso
It's just me and my vato, we in a Porsche on Rodeo
Tryna find us a J-Lo to paint a face like its make-up
If you play with the queso, them bullets flyin' rapido
Call my vatos like andele go and pick up ladrillos
My compadress, my partners, aka my amigos
And they play with gambino, don't touch it if it paquito
If it ain't bout guapo, lil' nigga don't call
Cause I don't wanna talk, fall back, nigga, pause
I don't play about my vatos
When it come to 'em, give a nigga that trabajo

[Hook: Que]
For the cheese like nachos
I'll pull up on a nigga pronto

If money ain't the convo, tell me what the hell you call for
As soon as the block close, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
