[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
If you ain't fucking get the fuck out
Had a twelve pack of rubber 'bout to run out
Back seat got 'em toes on my windows
I was gone off the lean so my bitch goes
And every time a nigga drive it's a DUI
Smoking in the S5 I be speeding by
Get the pussy on accident I don't even try
She ain't sucking some later then I leave her now
Got a little freak in lemonade the severed sr bimmer
Everytime she come around niggas tag team her
Free clothes, elbows out the tower roof
You a rookie keep the pussy if you got dough
From the same streets we might've fucked the same bitch
Made her bust it open hope it wasn't your main bitch
I'm about a dollar a broke course the main bitch
Y'all I'm 'bout to fuck 'em but chick stay in your lane bitch

[Hook - YG]
I got a bitch in Atlanta, a bitch in LA
A bitch in Miami, a bitch in the Bay
I got a bitch she cook steak I met her on tour
And all the bitch wet is question me and
I got a bitch in every city
I got a bitch in every city
I got a bitch in every city
I got a bitch in every city yeah
I got a bitch in every city
And all we ever do is fuck

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Ye bank roll, stunting on these fake hoes
Murder one I beat the pussy nigga case closed
It ain't shit to get her naked when your neck froze
Kick the squares off bus take the rest home
Straight like that get straight to it
And I'm all to fucking and the cuffing I can't do it
I hear these niggas talking about fame but they ain't moving
You hit me with some brain I watch my chain stupid
I'm a dog, dog ass nigga
Your boyfriend triggered you can call that nigga
I heard you got some brans spending all that with ya
Got some weed and some liquor get the pitcher baby I just wanna hit ya

[Hook]
