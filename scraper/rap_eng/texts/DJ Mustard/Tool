[Verse 1: TeeCee4800]
Aye, big face benjis and a hemi
That pussy fertile, I need a jimmy
I'm in the motherfuck' coup√©, goin' crazy
It's just me and my Caby
Be yanked out to the motherfuckin' fullest
Niggas tell me I'm bogus, what you talkin' 'bout willis?
Blue chucks, shelltoes
Earrings below zero
Icey Fresh is my second home
Want a nigga to try me, so we can get it on
C-walk on your face, nigga
While I'm listening to Mase, nigga
Ten toes, two feet
Blame it on the streets
MTM, what you talkin' about, Young Tally
The Loc, nigga, don't make me chalk him out

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
I just hit that bitch and move
I just give that bitch the tools
Runnin around city with the tool
If you trippin' I let that loose
Know it sound like i'm off a deuce
Probably cause I'm off a deuce
Popped that zanny in there too
I swear this the best damn juice

[Verse 2: Jay 305]
Hold up, hold up
Bitch, what you talkin' 'bout?
You better get your baby daddy, 'fore I stomp him out
Ain't no passes for yees, so fucking chuck him out
I'm at Slauson and Yee's tryna get some takeout
With a bitch I'm fresh out
Touched down from West Side, I gotta fuck 'em
Listening to Messy Marv (yadda) fuck 'em
Fuckin' rats on Snapchat, I (yadda) fuck 'em
Yeah, it's me, hoe, Jay-3-0-cinco
AKA never seen with a weak hoe
Getting robbed at Roscoes on Pico
Rappers rap game like a motherfuckin' free throw
Bitch I'm thuggin'
I'm talking 'bout fuckin'
Dirty South Central nigga, fuck your hood
Lil G, man, trippin, got the burner in the function
I ain't gon' spill my Henny, baby, even if they bustin'
This nuts

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
I just hit that bitch and move
I just give that bitch the tools
Runnin around city with the tool
If you trippin' I let that loose
Know it sound like i'm off a deuce
Probably cause I'm off a deuce
Popped that zanny in there too
I swear this the best damn juice

[Verse 3: TeeCee4800]
Cashed out for the lo'-lo'
Put a couple of my homies on the payroll
Nigga, what they here for
Break a dice game up, put a ten to four
Aye, and then I smash on the gas
On to fuck a nigga's bitch
Then I have her set a trap on him
Yeah, I teach her how to pass on him
Bad lil bitch, but I never spend no cash on her
I just give a bitch the tools
Tell her walk it out like shoes
Yeah, you know that's how we do
Yeah, it's me and Marley Blu
MTM, nigga, we don't give a fuck about your crew
Free my nigga, D-Loc
I'm in New York in my pea coat
Young Tally, nigga, I'ma go to the Grammys in my khakis, nigga

[Hook: TeeCee4800]
I just hit that bitch and move
I just give that bitch the tools
Runnin around city with the tool
If you trippin' I let that loose
Know it sound like i'm off a deuce
Probably cause I'm off a deuce
Popped that zanny in there too
I swear this the best damn juice
