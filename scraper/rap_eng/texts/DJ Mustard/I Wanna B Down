[Verse 1: YG]
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

[Hook]
I wanna B down
With what you're going through
I wanna B down
I wanna B down with you
No matter the time of day or night it's true
I wanna B down

[Verse 2: YG]
Promise you will be my lover
You will never ever leave me
She know a nigga lie, but itâ€™s whatever, she believe me
Let me hit it I make you come early like premis
As long as she never leave me
Lick you up like fiji water
Go harder harder
Girl I fuck you while we listen to the carter
Ain't worried about money, I'm a baller
I hit her with that game Coach Carter
I ain't the type that's gone ask where your Benz at
My nigga need a girl, so where your friends at
Where she live at? Can he pull up?
He be gang banging though, he a hussler, can he pull up?
See, it be the little things that matter
Got me climbing up the love ladder
You can be wife, best friend
My nigga, it's all good
Just love me like you said you would

[Hook]
I wanna B down
With what you're going through
I wanna B down
I wanna B down with you
No matter the time of day or night it's true
I wanna B down

[Verse 3: YG]
She said, your secrets is safe with me
Just think I heard them pages in my diary
Say don't you ever lie to me
Don't ever get that pussy up
Even if I cheat her with a bitch that wasn't good enough
Cause most of the time these bitches don't matter
She say long as she don't find out just make sure I wrap up
She know a nigga gon' be a nigga but I'm that nigga
She wanna be with so she might as well put up with it
Like hold up!

Look

Shit you know me, I'm in the studio goin hard
Ye?

Haha

[Hook]
I wanna B down
With what you're going through
I wanna B down
I wanna B down with you
No matter the time of day or night it's true
I wanna B down
