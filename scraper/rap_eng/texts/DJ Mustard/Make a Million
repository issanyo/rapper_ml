I woke up and jumped on a plane
Checked out my budget, I'm straight
Fuck if you feeling some way
Cause I got some millions to make
Fuck if you feeling some way
I woke up I slept on the plane
But you cannot sleep on my name
I got some millions to make

Fuck if you feelings some way
I went to sleep on a plane
I woke up I jumped off this way
I woke up I jumped on the plane
I woke up, my diamonds were dancing
I kissed them like I'm a romantic
And customs keep going through my baggage
And checking my notes like a ransom

Is you gon help me make some millions?
I not just your average civilian
Cause I was in class with some real ones
Shooting dice in the back of the building
Slept on a plane, got a Charlie
Got jet lag but I'm in a 'Rari
I knocked your bitch at Le Jardin
She fucked me before I departed

I woke up, my diamonds were dancing
I kissed them like I'm a romantic
And customs keep going through my baggage
And checking my notes like a ransom

I woke up and jumped on a plane
Checked out my budget, I'm straight
Fuck if you feeling some way
Cause I got some millions to make
Fuck if you feeling some way
I woke up I slept on the plane
But you cannot sleep on my name

I got some millions to make
[?]
So fuck if you feeling some way
Cause we got women on the way
They walked in, my diamonds were dancing
I kissed them like I'm a romantic
Just hopped off a flight from Atlanta
I got myself fly but I landed
I'm making, I'm making some millions
Wake up gon make me some millions
10 million gon make me 10 million
10 million gon buy me a building
I [?] up in Barneys, they don't got what I want up in Saks Fifth
I tip for the 'Rari, yesterday I passed out up in Maxfield's
I woke up, my diamonds were dancing
I kissed them like I'm a romantic
And customs keep going through my baggage
And checking my notes like a ransom

I woke up and jumped on a plane
Checked out my budget I'm straight
Fuck if you feeling some way
Cause I got some millions to make
Fuck if you feeling some way
I woke up I slept on the plane
But you cannot sleep on my name
I got some millions to make
