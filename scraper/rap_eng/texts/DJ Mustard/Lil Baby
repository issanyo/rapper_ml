Hell yeah, you got the right idea
You let me hit it from the back like a Rottweiler

Hit it raw doggy in the morning

Every time I'll pull it cocky got you put it on me
Got you screaming oooh oooh

Girl, I beat it up, beat it up right, I will

Hit it to a swirl, break the ice out
Ain't even with her, you gon' wild out

[Chorus]
Girl, I beat it up, beat it up right, I will
Oh, and I go deeper than your ex-man did
She be like, "Slow down zaddy, yeah that ain't too big"
She a pretty young thing and ain't got no kids, oh
