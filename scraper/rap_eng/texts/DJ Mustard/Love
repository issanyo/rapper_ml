[Verse 1]
I've been waiting all night long for you
And I made up all these things to do
So why don't you slow it down, slow it down, slow it down
I want you to do it now, do it now, do it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Cuz if I had to wait much longer, I'd have to start without you
But now that you're here, I'll put on a show
So why don't you watch me baby? Just watch me

[Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
I want your love, love, love, love
Cuz theres nothing better, nothing better, nothing better
Than your love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
When you're not around I crave for you
When your lips touch mine, I might just melt
So why don't ya go down, go down, go down
I want ya to do it now, do it now, do it now

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x3]
