[Intro: Jay 305]
Uh, motherfuckin' hood tales, nigga
Nigga these my hood tales
Motherfuckin' hood tales, nigga
Uh, uh (Mustard on the beat ho)

[Verse 1: Jay 305]
Woke up, brushed my teeth
Cross the street, holla at Moe G
"Tell me about the raid that happened down the street"
Blowing out smoke, telling me
"Watch these suckas, keep you a freak
But most important, get your money"
Smiles and cries, hi's and bye's
Fo'sho, whatever that means
Got some game now let's get something to eat
Pick up M got in the wind
Forgot I left my pistol in the rental I was in
Shootup there got my shit
Back to the block where i heard some shit
Same time I got a text from punk ass bitch
"I'm pregnant", "Ain't nothing happening
I used the condom bitch, I ain't the daddy"

[Chorus: Jay 305]
In the hood, ghetto tales
Uh, in the ghetto nigga
Uh, I'm a ghetto nigga
I'm a ghetto nigga
In the hood, ghetto tales
Uh, in the ghetto nigga
Uh, I'm a ghetto nigga
I'm a ghetto nigga

[Verse 2: TeeCee4800]
Woke up quick, right about noon
Just thought that I had to be in midtown soon
Yankee fitted hat nigga to start my day
We bang the deuce over here, this ain't west LA
Put on my fresh blue chucks with the flat blue laces
Put on my earrings, make sure them bitches is blanging
Check the store, press any nigga look like he banging
Couple hours later just me and my niggas, we swanging
It was about six o'clock, seen the house on the block
With all the lights out looking like a easy flock
All you gotta do is knock, told that little nigga get out
Grab the safe, grab the jewelry nigga and get out
Uh, now we at the skating rink nigga
Parking lot cripping, seen a couple niggas slipping
Pulled up on him quick, nigga dropped the whole clip
Didn't leave no witnesses, that's some hood shit

[Chorus: Jay 305]
In the hood, ghetto tales
Uh, in the ghetto nigga
Uh, I'm a ghetto nigga
I'm a ghetto nigga
In the hood, ghetto tales
Uh, in the ghetto nigga
Uh, I'm a ghetto nigga
I'm a ghetto nigga

[Verse 3: Jay 305]
What? Hood ass bitch
Shut the fuck up, go put on some shit
Oh shit, there go the police
CRASH! I ain't getting caught in the sweep
I'm breaking trying to shake him
In my new Gucci's, I wish I would've change 'em
Fish game alley way the bird came out
Ran to my motherfucking aunty Tammy house
I'm ghost, I got away
But that don't mean I won't get another day
Smokin' homie tryna sell me his J's
Type of shit that happen every fucking day

[Chorus: Jay 305]
In the hood, ghetto tales
Uh, in the ghetto nigga
Uh, I'm a ghetto nigga
I'm a ghetto nigga
In the hood, ghetto tales
Uh, in the ghetto nigga
Uh, I'm a ghetto nigga
I'm a ghetto nigga
