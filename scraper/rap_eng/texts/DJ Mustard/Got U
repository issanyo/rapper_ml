[Intro]
Let me see you
Mustard on the Beat Ho

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
Money be on time, I never wait for it
She know I'm good for it, she know it's good
She love me long time, I go a long time
Never the wrong time, cause that's my bitch
I got you baby, I got you baby

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
She a diva, bad senorita
She be on time, cosign on the leases
I never wait for the chicken cause she be coming with it
Plus I play my position unlike these other niggas
She gone count it up and tell me that it's all there
All she fuckin' with is rappers and ball players
She be handling business, she be going to work
I'm scratching shit off my checklist, spilling all out her purse
I be macking for sure, I be dippin' for real
I'm a young wild nigga with a different appeal
Yeah, and these other niggas know wassup
I'm the only one that know what's love, ayy!

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
Money be on time, I never wait for it
She know I'm good for it, she know it's good
She love me long time, I go a long time
Never the wrong time, cause that's my bitch
I got you baby, I got you baby

[Verse 2: Symba]
Now after I fall back then I call back
Get you in your feelings and force you to crawl back
I do miss you, but I can't say shit
I'ma play the role like you don't phase me
Ask me what's wrong, girl I'm just high
Sitting here thinkin' 'bout how we got this far
You ain't no side chick, more than a main girl
Wives get divorced, we in our own world
You hit the hotline, tell you to come through
Got you out the bed even though you don't want to
I'm who you run to, these other niggas know wassup
I'm the only one that know what's love
Bruh tell 'em wassup...

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
Money be on time, I never wait for it
She know I'm good for it, she know it's good
She love me long time, I go a long time
Never the wrong time, cause that's my bitch
I got you baby, I got you baby

[Bridge: Marc E. Bassy]
Hold me down, I'ma hold you
What you need I could show you
Hold me down, I'ma hold you too
What you need, What you need
Hold me down, I'ma hold you
What you need, I could show you
Hold me down, I'ma hold you too
What you need, I could show you yeahh...

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
Money be on time, I never wait for it
She know I'm good for it, she know it's good
She love me long time, I go a long time
Never the wrong time, cause that's my bitch
I got you baby, I got you baby

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
Mine, that's mine, that's mine, that's mine
Mine,  that's mine, that's mine
