[Intro]
Rollin' with my blammer on

[Hook]
Rollin' with my blammer on
I'm not alone
Oou, I ain't scared of y'all
Ten steps ahead of y'all (ohh)
Mustard on that beat, hoe
Rollin' with my blammer on
I'm not alone
Oou, I ain't scared of y'all
Ten steps ahead of y'all (ahh)

[Verse 1]
Rollin' with my blammer on
Homies with me and I'm on
Haters want me dead and gone
Go make that hammer get that blammy on
Rollin' with my blammer on
Play my own I'm Al Capone
A gangster stuff in casts and cones
I made it past the average Joe
I can buy your trap that hole
You flock, your sly, you back at home
My spot is fly I'm rappin' gold
On Spotify with platinum songs
I put in work, I know my worth
I pull up vert ,I pull out first
I splashed my shirt, I smell like work
You flash your girl, these shells is perked
Oou, the roof, disappear, regroup, reappear
Match that matte black strap with my gear

[Hook]
Rollin' with my blammer on
I'm not alone
Oou, I ain't scared of y'all
Ten steps ahead of y'all (ohh)
Rollin' with my blammer on
I'm not alone
Oou, I ain't scared of y'all
Ten steps ahead of y'all, all y'all

[Verse 2]
Mandatory action
Mandatory shoot at Troy Ave shit
True story tip before a lap dance
Gotta stay alert never lackin'
Never be a sucker for a bop
She don't use hands that's soccer
Whippin' out bands got mileage
This blammer too big to disguise it
Johnnys pulled me over did the most
I had to hand my hammer to my hoe
They almost took me in that was close
I'mma need that back in for them shows
Tinted up livin' GLE Coup√©
Send a slug knock your chimney off the roof
Chipped up got my skillet in the booth
Iced up got December in my tooth
I put in work, I know my worth
I pull up vert, I pull out first
I splashed my shirt, I smell like gerp
I meant like work I, ooou

[Hook]
Rollin' with my blammer on
I'm not alone
Oou, I ain't scared of y'all
Ten steps ahead of y'all (ohh)
Rollin' with my blammer on
I'm not alone
Oou, I ain't scared of y'all
Ten steps ahead of y'all, all y'all

[Outro]
Rollin' with my blammer on
I'm not alone
Oou, I ain't scared of y'all
Ten steps ahead of y'all, all y'all
