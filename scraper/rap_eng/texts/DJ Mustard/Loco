[Verse 1: Mr. Capone E]
I got the prices on the low low
Cartel money like Chapo
Migos straight chillin with the vatos
Mustard on the beat so its malo
Bad boys in California
Hi Power Boyz posted up in every corner
Warn ya, bottles on every table
With the business when ya hangin with the table
Mally Mall, criminal, passin a blunt
Low riders just poppin the trunk
Miss Lady Pinks got the rucas with coca
Baking soda, keepin it chola
Rolas got the DJ goin hyphy
Bringin the west back like it was the 90s
In all the hoods where ya'll find me
Black, white, brown, pakis, even the chinese, goin

CHORUS

Mally Mall:
Loco, loco, loco, loco
I'm in love with yo ass like the coco
Pussy so tight, feel like I'm in a choke hold
Drop top Maybach, that's a photo
Y.O.L.O

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Walk in the club they go loco
Migo, Capone-E, here vamonos
Got cheese in pockets like nachos
Get the coco from my ese that's my vato
Touch down in L.A., pull up in a 6 4
Then I ask a young nigga where he hit tha lick for
I told him come down to the varrio
In the hood everybody goin' loco

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Lil Momma so loco she sneakin' photos
She all in my shows, she won't leave me alone
Full blown kiss, she tryin' give me her phone
Don't let me drive that free no more she throwin up her thong
She loco and she in my kitchen whippin' up coco
With no panties on and she got her nine on Tony Romo
They losin' and tryna kill me I'm takin' them out like Jhango
Got em matching, I be kicking it like I'm Kato

CHORUS

[Mally Mall]:
Loco, loco, loco, loco
I'm in love with yo ass like the coco
Pussy so tight, feel like I'm in a choke hold
Drop top Maybach, that's a photo
Y.O.L.O

[Verse 4: Offset]
Bitches they crazy they goin' loco
I hit the door and I got a bankroll
Young rich nigga I got money off the coco
Came from the bottom to the top Migos we took over
You can go and leave (leave)
You will never find a nigga like me (never find)
You was in the club and I pulled you with a Louis fleece (Louis)
Two bitches in the bed wit me while I'm sleep (two bitches)
I go loco they call me El Chapo
The bricks be jumpin' like pogo
When I see a nigga pull out the camera
Runnin' to the money boy I got a lot of stamina

CHORUS
