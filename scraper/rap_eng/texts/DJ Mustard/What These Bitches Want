[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Before this rapping I wanted to be a kingpin
On the corner with niggas running them things in
I was told get the money and bring the team in
And never ever let them hoes get between them
Born a slave, but I die a king, and um
For bad bitches with money, I got a thing and um
I'm feeling like King James when he got his ring
Because I started off with nothing except a dream, nigga
I'm cut from a different cloth
They don't make no more, you niggas soft
The streets killed Lil Snupe, I took a loss
That's why my heart so cold, my shit defrost
Everybody saying that I stunt too much
But they don't know where I came from, I done too much
And my ex chick said I like to fuck too much
So I turned around and told her, "Bitch you want too much"

What these bitches want from a nigga?
Want from meeeee, want from me (Yeah)
What you want from me? Want from me
I gave it all I got, I won't let you get the best of me, yeah
(Best of me, girl)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, no one can save us and we realized it
We knew the outcome and we still tried it
That South Central state of mind
I'm in the field, logic to be a real rider
We did this shit to the extreme where you ain't feel honest
Now this blood is on your hands and you hope these bills wash it
Sinking deeper in regret but that's the real faucet
See man, go for self that was the real Slauson
But do this win lose or draw that was a real promise
Till death do us what's most important was rep to us
The set schooled us to love and lie and respect shooters
Reflect to it this year I'm dropping my best music
Hope you niggas get rich and then reinvest to it
Wish you niggas success and minus the stress to it
Lot of steps lot of losses and regrets to it
A game of life you ain't the type that will accept losing
Whatever's left to it flying in a jet to it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Want from meeeee, want from me (Yeah)
What you want from me? Want from me
I gave it all I got, I won't let you get the best of me, yeah
(Best of me, girl)
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ain't trying to waste no time (no time)
So I gotta let you know (let you know)
Oh, money on my mind
Money over bitches, that's the story of my life
(Story of my life)
Yeah I know them guys try to catch me slipping
Tell them keep on trying (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Want from meeeee, want from me (Yeah)
What you want from me? Want from me
I gave it all I got, I won't let you get the best of me, yeah
(Best of me, girl)
Yeah, yeah
