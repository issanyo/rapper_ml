[Verse 1: YG]

Yeah, y'all gon' have to kill me
Asked your bitch if I can fuck, she said feel free
You can't fuck with me I'm too much(too much)
Look at me my money too up(too up)
I'm killing niggas like the Ku Klux(Ku Klux)
Niggas talk shit but they don't do much
You niggas pool butts my bitch good looking
She sucked my dick and told that bitch good licking
Now I'm rolling off a pill, yeah I'm rolling off a pill
Fuck around and crash now I'm rolling off a hill
Niggas know the real can't deal with the fake
I ain't looking for some love I can deal with the hate
Oh, oh, yeah my teeth grinding
You emotional bitch, just be quiet
Yeah, look, I got these ratchets getting ratchet
Alcohol and pills I got habits on habits nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Beautiful April]

Yeah, look roll-a-roll-a-roll-another one
Light that shit up, take a hit, burn another one
Kush in my system no a bitch fucked up
Purp drank in my cup gon' pour a bitch up
Pull me up, pull me up bitch you know I can't sleep
And a bitch still rolling off a trip last week
Pushaz Ink and you know my nigga Mustard on the beat
Ratchet quality music and we do it for the streets
We do it for the freaks, we do it for the peeps
We do it for the thieves, getting money in the streets
Nigga you don't want the beef, man the bros bring the heat
Fire flame for ya' ass boy your better have a seat

If you really with the shit shake it for the President
On my first lady shit shaking hands on my chips

Yeah, I'm a nasty nigga I'll fuck you on the couch
And if you with that I'll fuck you in the mouth girl
