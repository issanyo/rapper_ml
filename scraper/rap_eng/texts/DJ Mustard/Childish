[Verse 1: Vell]
Damn I miss my thick bitch Katrina
Ride the dick so good like my Beamer
When I seen you at the mall you was peepin'
Same day on the IG creepin'
In my DM like "Vell, hit me up"
I'm thinkin' in my head like man I finna fuck
Called her on my phone I finna pull up
Bounce out, fifty down I got my bands up
I ain't tryin' to play no games I'm tryin' to luck up
And I been about my money call it slow bucks
You gotta get a clue baby
These hundreds blue I'mma throw this money up

Used to take you to the mall, showed you how to ball
Now you blowin' up my phone and I don't accept calls

Fuckin' hella models, champagne we sippin'
I tried to hit her on the low-low
But you was playin' hella games ho

And when we ride around the city yeah we smokin', ho
