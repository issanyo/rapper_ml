[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Tyga]
All the girls all go, getting money on your own
Let me see ya get low on the floor
'Cause you got a one night pass
Need more in my glass, pour me up, baby, this your song (Yeah)
And it if you do it up real big
Ain't worried 'bout a, turn it up with me all night long
Give it to 'em
Oh, oh, oh, oh, give it to 'em

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ha, pop a pain in the Porsche, she a painkiller (Woo)
Made a deal with her momma, I deal with her
She 5'9" with them heels on her, tall spills on her
I pop a brassiere like it's a bib
Ferris Bueller, my day off, she paid off
Rock got game like Playoff
Funny how I made off
Lookin' at my peers as I take off
Says she got another chick for me I should wait on (Woo)
Lookin' for a JLo, bad little some' I could take home
California king, you can lay on
T-Raww stuntin', bank on
Got a few girls I could bring on, so play on, playa (Yeah)
I keep her, got her hip to me like beeper
So many girls but not enough weekend
Got a man, but she creepin'
Don't get caught up in the deep end (Ha)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Tyga]
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun (Yeah)
Swinging in the air, swinging in the air, show them show them what you working with (Yeah, I see you, uh)
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun (Yeah, I got a car for the bad bitches, come lap up)
'Cause we don't really care, don't care, we don't really care, don't care, girls just wanna have fun
Girls just wanna have fun fun (Yeah, T-Raww, JLo, this that shit though)
