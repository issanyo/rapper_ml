[Intro]
DJ Swish
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Verse 1: RJ]
I ain't got no time for messy bitches
I'm too all about this money (money)
Y'all ain't got no business in my business
Benjamin, a hundred honest
She be on all me, my nuts only
After we leave she hear my comments
Rather take a break than make a flip
Than take a flip than make a promise
Ever since I been famous
Bitches been all in my comments
Must wanna get my mine next
Your body language look famished (oww)

[Hook: RJ]
My mind is playin' tricks on me
She can't be this on me
Come get your bitch homie
My mind is playin' tricks on me
She can't be this on me
Come get your bitch homie

[Verse 2: Choice & RJ]
Put your tonsils right beneath my boxers girl, there's power in your knowledge
Politicking, proper proposition, pick her pockets pull up partners
People playing put in position to pop a profit off my product
Shit, I'd rather make her flip and make her flip than make
'em flip more commas, problem with your pussy pausin'
Keep that [?] hunnid (ever since I been famous)
They say don't change like laundry money
Not her son, he at the door, nigga, bounty hunter
Tom Brady need a Belichick
Wrist and neck froze, dial-up internet
What's yo' budget for the intercourse>
I'm not in a relation, I'm in a Porsche
House of pain, bitch make me build a fort
Brought my main bitch out, just to get at yours

[Hook: RJ]
My mind is playin' tricks on me
She can't be this, homie
Come get your bitch homie
My mind is playin' tricks on me
She can't be this, homie
Come get your bitch homie
