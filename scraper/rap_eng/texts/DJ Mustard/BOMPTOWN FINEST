[Intro]
Bomptown finest
Bomptown finest
Look, uhh, nigga, Bomptown's finest

[Verse 1]
I done did the unexpected
They countin' niggas out, now them dickheads respect us
You unsure about me bein' successful
Well, I'm unsure about your ass standin' in my section
'Cause I done put in overtime, caught cases
Pop straps when Pop think I lost my mind
Where I'm from they try to hate and politic
But fuck that, buy a strap, load them up with hollow tips
I'm, self made, self paid, self safe, self everythang
And that Maybach doin' donuts, bitch
I'm in Bompton, still hitting' corners
And if the 'Gnac gone, niggas still sip Corona
I done made me, I feel good about it
But them suckas try to tell me, take the hood up out me
Who would Master P be if he wasn't "'Bout It 'Bout It"?
Or HOV without the Marcy Projects

[Bridge]
I'm Bomptown's finest, yeah, nigga
Bomptown's finest, 4Hunnid, 4
Nigga, Bomptown's finest, yeah
Bomptown's finest, uhh

[Verse 2]
Now when I pull up, everything exotic
Can't complain, life's sweet, blue drank, Hypnotic
The past year I've been makin' all profit
My team finally got it, then somebody shot me
Damn, that's just the Devil, my nigga
But thank god it ain't end with a shovel, my nigga
Have it dusted off my shoulders like whatever, my nigga
And Frogg ain't gone, he live forever, my nigga
Rest in peace to my nigga Frogg
You know your 4Hunnid niggas out here, doing they shit, nigga
My nigga gone but never forgotten
You know anytime I bheese, I told you what's poppin'
Uhh, so y'all niggas finally made it
Buddha still the same, you know that nigga brazy
You know when small niggas hatin'
There's money being made now so niggas started changin'
And Game just dropped Documentary 2
He got some bangers on there, in one he talking bout you
I know you and Peso had issues
But real shit, it seem that nigga miss you
Your kids, I took them Christmas shopping
You know me, I'ma do my part, nigga I gotchu
I know you watchin' so you know what's up with G man
He was just worried about his kids and his freeman
Your mom said that you said, we was on bad terms
Man that shit work a nigga nerves
But long as Lil Buddha on this Earth
It's long live Lil Frogg that's my word

[Bridge]
Nigga Bomptown's finest
Ayy, nigga Bomptown's finest
Ayy, nigga, Bomptown's finest
This is Bomptown's finest
Nigga, Bomptown's finest

[Verse 3]
Third verse, three years later, still Piruin' it, still gettin' paper
Gotta tell you about the homies, whole lot up in the makin'
TB, yeah that's my nigga, but we ain't talk much lately
Me and H fell out, me and Mustard fell out
Me and you fell out 'cause
There was some shit you didn't tell me 'bout
But I ain't even trippin' 'cause I get the bigger picture
Big Buddha that's my nigga, so you know you my nigga
Turtle gone, Chica-gone, Buddha three
Call, you know I answer my phone
"How this nigga in skinny jeans be the realest from the team?"
This how them old niggas holla behind the scene
And baby Buddha, my Tree Top trooper
Big homies don't love ya 'cause they ain't say nothin' to ya
But in real time the shit out here be too tough
Gotta stay dangerous, gotta keep touped up
Hoppin' out with two tucked doin' too much
Don't give two fucks livin' like I can't lose much
Fuck luck, hit the bottle, now I'm fucked up
Spread the money out
Cause goes around, come around, nigga, nunchucks
Blow it once okay, blow it twice, you a dumb fuck
I done took homies off the block
Who knows how many homies
I done saved from gettin' popped
Look at Slim he ain't gotta sell rocks
I told him figure out this rap shit, then you buy the block
Look at Syke800, lookin' like money
I told him save that shit don't spend it all on the day
Ayy Buddha, 'Ru you know what it 'Ru
We got some shit in the makin', it's bomin' soon
Went from slangin' to bangin' and burglaries before school
Then finesse this rap shit on Piru
