If your chick come close to me
She ain't going home when she post to be

Ooh, my niggas close to me
And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh, them hoes go for me
Got your chick send a pic, like, "Pose for me!"
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Yeah, that's how it post to be
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be

[Verse 1]
Tell me what it is
Tell me what you want girl

Let me give you all the things that you never had
Ooh baby if you want it
If you wanna do bad things, I do
The best you've ever had

So many nights when you studying and I'm callin'
You making money, I'm making money

[Verse 2]
Uh
So you telling me
That every girl that I meet, is somebody you wanna be with
You see me with it, you need it
Man if you want it, you keep it
Nah, matter of fact, give it back
'Cause I remember going through hell and back just to get her
Her mama telling me that I would never get it, forget it
But, now I'm in the kitchen cooking rice and beans
All good in the hood
Nigga, no new team
I'm playing ball with a brother
I let him wiggle through struggles
And her pap talk a lot, but I just sit and I watch
'Cause I ain't listenin' to shit
I'm just looking at her
I'm just telling you the truth
Nigga, look what I heard
