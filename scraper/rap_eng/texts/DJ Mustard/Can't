[Intro]
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Lil', lil' nigga, hah, hah
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Verse 1: Slimmy B]
You ain't with the pop out, four time, chops out
If I catch a case, it's gon' be for a knockdown
Was dead after Dre, but we got the city hot now
This .45 a twister and I ain't talkin' Chi-town
If she ain't tryna pay me, then a bitch can't date me
Still in the field, hope you suckas don't take me
Diamonds shinin' but I still do a nigga shady
I'm fuckin' on your bitch, probably why these niggas hate me
They tryna take my style 'cause a young nigga wavy
Feel like YG 'cause of my life, shit brazy
Thinking I'm your nigga, LOL, bitch I can't be
Dick so good, turn a bad bitch crazy

[Chorus: Slimmy B]
I be really gettin' money, you niggas can't (nope)
Actin' like y'all in the field, you niggas ain't (where?)
I be ridin' round with Draco, baby K (boom, boom)
Masked up, no face, no case (lil' nigga)
Still on the block thugin', ain't shit changed (no)
Back to back in big bodies, switchin' lanes
Give a fuck about a broke bitch, I'm gettin' paid
SOB x RBE, lil' nigga it's the gang (gang)

[Verse 2: Lul G]
Cash that ain't new, I thought y'all knew, nigga
All these hunds on me, and they blue nigga
And all these hoes want me, fuck your crew, nigga
Suckas like us, so I'm strapped with that tool, nigga
Young nigga, I be rockin', VVS bling blaow, I be coppin'
Nerd niggas claimin' funk, ain't dropped shit
Broke nigga want a feature, nigga stop it (you broke)
I don't really give a fuck about the neck though (bitch)
I be thuggin', I be runnin' to the check though
Gang gang for my nigga, I stretch bro
Brodie got the strap, he a show you how that TEC blow

[Chorus: Slimmy B]
I be really gettin' money, you niggas can't (nope)
Actin' like y'all in the field, you niggas ain't (where?)
I be ridin' round with Draco, baby K (boom, boom)
Masked up, no face, no case (lil' nigga)
Still on the block thugin', ain't shit changed (no)
Back to back in big bodies, switchin' lanes
We go fuck up on a broke bitch, I'm gettin' paid
SOB x RBE, lil' nigga it's the gang (gang)
