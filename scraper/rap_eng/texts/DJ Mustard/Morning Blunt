[rap]
Uh
Got my pre rolled blunts with the sativa
I look like a diva
Look like barbie smoke like marley
I don’t like to party
I like to stay home and smoke a blunt or a fat backwood
If I could I would
Have a Blunt whenever I want by the side of my bed  the small table drawer

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I had infinity blunts
To start my day right
High lasting till the night
Than I wake up
Wake n bake my morning blunt

[Chorus]
Yeah
Morning Blunt
I look like Barbie and I Smoke like marley
Got my green lighter
Got my breakfast served
A blunt on a plate
My dealer got me baked (yeah)
Morning Blunt
Wake n bake
Morning Blunt

I start the day right
The water feels so nice
When you high in the shower
I couldn’t be hotter or colder
I felt so much better

I dressed so comfortable
Played my weed playlist
Put on a sweatshirt and
Sweatpants
Made a nigga relax (relaxed yall)

Got me a nice breakfast &
Another blunt
And some sausage and eggs
This is a way to live
And baby you between my legs

[Chorus]x2
[rap]
Yo got my blunts
For Breakfast [morning]
Lunch [afternoon]
& Dinner [night]
Oh baby having sex so high
And felling yo thighs
Feels so right
I have so much time
I wanna thank the devil for this deal
My god I wish this was real
Got my fat backwoods
For 4:20 Am
It’s an appetizer
Before my morning Blunt
And my penis you can suck
And not for a buck
But for a couple hits of the Reefer
So you won’t break my high
Oh so kind
You don't want money
You want the time that we could spend
That you wanna give me head
And wanna get High with yo daddy
Let me show you my fetishes
If we going down that route
We going south
And up and down
Around town
Sucking the cum
Up your lips
And you sip
And suck and we fuck
And we done
We get up and you roll
And  we both smoke my morning blunt
And than I go back to sleep
Than baby look at my jar of my ounce
And make as many morning blunts as you can
I know you’re mouth and fingers are sore
But can you do a little more for me
You’re big gay stoner daddy
That will do whatever you want
Either in bed
Either with weed
And if it’s just loving me I’m down
I smoked my morning blunt
And I’m ready to go down town on you what!!!!
[Chorus]x2
