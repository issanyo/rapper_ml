Home for your Hip-Hop & R&B
Now, question of the day
Ladies, females, men, gentlemen
Is it okay for you to have a side bitch or a side nigga?
If not, give me a call right now at 1-800-776-PUSH

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
My side girl wanna be my main bitch
Say she wanna have my babies
Said our love would be amazing
Until we pushing up daisies
And I don't know how she gon' take this
I'd rather she start up, come on, and take dick
Call me daddy when I get up in it
Never spending that Chanel, well after that I'm dipping
