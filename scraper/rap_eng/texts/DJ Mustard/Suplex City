[Chorus: Brock Lesnar]
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch!
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch!
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch!
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch!

[Verse: PFV]
30 Seconds in, hit him with an F5
Hit his back so hard he feels it in his next life
Put 'em over that shoulder just like a knapsack
Stock man going down like the NASDAQ
No Roman's revenge
I know that I'll win and I know that I'm holding that title again
It's that Lesnar for president; no election
We dictate this ring from the start 'til the end
Punch him in the gut and hit him with a shoulder tuck
Head down! Man you know what's up
Spin him, flip him, man we gotta get him over up
Then we leave him like the covers man he folding up
First I hit him with a knee in the ring
Then he's married to the sheets let him sleep
German suplex - make the best fallin'
Ask 'em who's next; we tell 'em Seth Rollins. (Gone)

Hit him with an F5
Yeah we hit him with an F5
Hit him with an F5
Money in the bank?
Nah we hit him with an F5

[Chorus: Brock Lesnar]
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch!
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch!
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch!
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch!

[Outro: PFV]
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch
Hit him with a German, hit him with an F5
Suplex city, Suplex city bitch
Hit him with a German, hit him with an F5
Yeah we hit him with an F5
Hit him with an F5
German first then we hit him with an F5
