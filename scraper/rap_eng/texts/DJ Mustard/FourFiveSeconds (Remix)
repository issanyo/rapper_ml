[Verse 1: Scrubb$]
Get them guns out
Cause the suns out
For them ladies
Time to party
Let us get crazy
Cause it's spring break
We finna turn up!
There ain't no hate here fill up my cup!
Turn the music up to the maximum
Roll that loud up, let's get high 'till were dumb
We'll be dancin' from the night to the mornin'
From the beach to the whites of the sheets then we do it all again

[Verse 2: Sh!eldZ]
Throw them hands up like you don't care
For the artists singin' this song
Ri and Ye what a pair
Go ahead get loose go Donkey Kong
Get down to this song as it plays for the crowd
Throw them hands up for the ladies that are loud
With the crop tops and the booty shorts lookin' fine
Throw them hands up for the sake of a good time
Man it's spring break live it up, cause YOLO right?
