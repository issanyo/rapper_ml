[Intro]
He who believeth in Ja
Shall not be condemned
But he that believeth not
Is condemned already
Only because
He has not believed
In the man and the only begotten son
My Lord

[Chorus]
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky

[Verse 1]
Yeah, why would you leave somethin' you love here to die
In the cold
And it grows
Like a concrete rose
Beautiful ain't I?
'Til I withered and died
In them same streets you left me in
Screamin' Lord let me in
I don't know where to begin
Since I lost yo love
But then again your love
Was strictly for the drugs
I don't know whether to hug
Or to fill you with slugs
Fuckin' them whores
Instead of claiming what's rightfully yours
Pierced a hole in my heart from all the pain you caused
With no direction you left your first born lost
Give or take a few
Cause my hate for you
Grew, over the years
Through blood, sweat, and tears
I wanted to be just like you
My father figure, now I want to fight you
You bitch nigga, left me 'lone
And parts of me never outgrown
The fact that you left home
But moms was so strong
Don't let them get you fed
This world is yours she said
Now nothin' is stoppin' me but two to the head
In life there's more to come when it's all said and done
You lost one love, your only begotten son

[Chorus]
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky

[Verse 2]
Broke wit nothin to live for
And damn ready to die young
I'm the shadow behind the gun
Look at what I've become
The fear of many niggas
The floss of most bitches
The love that runs deepest
In the hearts of street niggas
Raised in the ghetto
By the ghetto
Was taught young to pop the metal
That's how shit get settled
Learn to cook up the coke
Never leave home without toast
Learn to fly my bitches with birds, in first not coach
Never trust ya, from a toddler to hustla
I was trained as a youngsta, to cock back and slug ya
Love me or hate me, ya only son
Let me live or kill me, the chosen one
Ja, under the gun, gotta kill 'em fo' sho'
If you want it you gonna get more then you askin' for
Life's got more to come, but when it's all said and done
You lost one love, your only begotten son

[Chorus]
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky

[Verse 3]
I wanted to be forever yours
Look it now we're nothin' more than two lost souls
Lookin to meet at the crossroads
I burn the hydro, lay back with my eyes closed
In deep thought like Brittany is somethin' I'd die for
How the fuck do you sleep at night?
Knowin' you wronged the only thing you ever did right
Despite the loss I stretch the length of a short
Now I got a new father whose name is New York
Runnin' wild in the streets
With heat, we don't talk
Cause when its cold you basically live life in dark
But light will shine from the heavens and bless one
Ja Rule; love, your only begotten son

[Chorus]
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry
'Cause I live to die
With my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky
