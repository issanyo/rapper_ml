[Bridge: Case]
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a be a nigga for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a be a nigga for life

[Chorus: Black Child & Ja Rule]
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Who's that chipped out?
Twenty-one year old, hot commodity
Coming out of a bum deal lottery
With a flow like sodomy
Put it on your bitch ass quite properly
I suggest you keep all eyes on me
And don't sleep as it is I'm highly critique
Pussy, money, murder it's part of my mystique
You feelin' me, this here is one of Queens elite
Predecessor of the street
While you munch, I eat
Ja's here
The nigga you love, but still fear
I done been there, done that
Now nigga, it's my year
I can leave you on the clear view
If you ain't yet clear
Matter of fact if you breathin' be glad you got air
Shut the fuck up
When grown folks are talkin', you hear?
Or get your shit blown, baby
From mouth to ear
Don't fear, when you smoke weed and fuckin your wife
Why? 'Cause I'm a nigga for life

[Chorus: Black Child & Ja Rule]
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Spare yourself the reality of an ass whippin'
That I'm givin' when I be gettin' tight and start flippin'
On your bitch ass niggas who like forming a cipher
It gets me hyper
Want the real? I'm a slice ya!
Light ya ass up with sixteen or more
Slugs coming from my snub nose Bulldog
Raw, to the core, let's lay down some laws
This is Ja's house, bow down or bring the war
Motherfuckers
Y'all don't want to touch what's hot
Whatever it be
The mic, the Glock, the drug spot
Like a bitch, you scared of life and takin' chances
And right now, you showin' more ass then an exotic dancer
The answer is this, niggas don't wanna touch
Ja live, stronger then a fucking coke rush
See on the streets we be killin' niggas like cash
You heard? I.N.C., nigga, it's Murdaaa!

[Bridge: Case]
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a be a nigga for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a be a nigga for life

[Chorus: Black Child & Ja Rule]
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Nigga, I live amongst the thoroughbreds, was raised to blaze lead
If you get shot, play dead, and put two in his head
Known to pasteurize and criticize a nigga size
Look him right in his the eyes and leave him dead where he lies
Come through mobbin' like Crips from Compton
We're all in burners and all sippin' on Gin, fuck flossin'
Nigga, I'm tossin' iron
And if you ain't buyin'
Then you're dyin'
For denyin'
I'm so inspirin'
To the youth, see I'm settin' it straight
Lettin' them know never to step on nothin' less than an eighth
And the longer it takes, somebody is gonna die for it
The "Streets is Watchin'," Jigga warned you, don't ignore it
Cause only niggas holdin', go JAP and blow yen
With the six double-oh
Fresh out of the pen
Brandishing the steel for the ice
Holdin' my dick, talkin' shit, shootin' dice
A nigga for life
So whatchu sayin' is
What the fuck is a nigga?
Rob a bitch, slap a bitch
All that shit

[Chorus: Black Child & Ja Rule]
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life
