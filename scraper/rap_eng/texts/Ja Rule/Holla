[Verse 2]
Let me holla at my true thugs
If niggas want war, bust slugs
Nigga, what? I'm hotta hotta and just can't be touched
Plus, anybody that fucks with me, gonna get felt
How many want it? Determines how the slugs get dealt
'Cause I (Spit 'em, spit 'em)
Choke them niggas like roaches and then (Flip 'em, Flip 'em)
Long as I'm alive, I'ma (hit 'em, hit 'em)
Respect mines, to the day of my demise
Don't fuck with me, cuz the flow's (killa, killa)
Whoever who wants it?
It's yours, now your gonna (Get it Get it)
(Fill a, fill a) Nigga full of holes
Treat 'em like hoes, and show no love to them homo thugs
It's us you wanna fuck with
As soon as them slugs skip
From body to body, go from brave to bitch
I don't respect it, plus niggas committed treason
Who want it with Ja? Who ready to die breathing?

[Chorus]
(Holla, holla)
All my niggas that's ready to get (dollars, dollars)
Bitches know who can get 'em a little (hotter, hotter)
Come on, If you rollin' with me (follow, follow)

[Verse 3]
Ja baby, one of the many, many niggas who sip Henny
With the the two-seaters, sitting on twenties
I, I be with running in, running out
Then, thou bestow hit em' up, gun em' down
Niggas ain't ready for Ja, anyway, anyhow
I give it give it to niggas, claimin' that they live it
Real (Niggas, Niggas) brandish the iron and flash
Like (hold this, hold this) when you got nothing to live for
Notice, niggas be hot, and more explosive
Focus, ready to rip 'em up with the dose, this
My life, niggas is frontin', and stuntin' for nothing
Better act right, fo' I spark and dim your lights?
I'm a hazard, to niggas, a bastard
To bitches, when in doubt, go for stealth, and clap the finish
Anything movin' rightfully hit for wrong doin'
I'ma follow and encourage all my niggas to (what?)

[Chorus]
(Holla, holla)
All my niggas that's ready to get (dollars, dollars)
Bitches know who can get 'em a little (hotter, hotter)
Come on, If you rollin' with me (follow, follow)
It's Murda..
(Holla, holla)
All my niggas that's ready to get (dollars, dollars)
Bitches know who can get 'em a little (hotter, hotter)
Come on, If you rollin' with me (follow, follow)
It's Murda..
(Holla, holla)
