(Ashanti) [Ja Rule talking]
Always there when you call [Buck-shots, haha]
Always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby

(Chorus - Ashanti)
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

(Ja Rule)
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter-past three
And shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in hoops and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti]
But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

(Chorus)

(Jay-Z)
Hov!
Big Pimpin'
Walk with a small limp
And I'm here to scoop you broads out your mid-sized cars
Bring hoes out of the closet
My dough gives chicks motive
He got enough money to afford it!
But one thing you could say about Jay
It's not a day I ever bought it
Y'all can audit my life
I put on that on my unborn daughter's life
All I give 'em is game
I don't give 'em my name
Chicks leap through hula-hoops to get in the flame
All it takes is Cristal juice to get in they pants, man
Ain't nothin' gon' change 'bout Hov
But my socks, my drawers, and my Rocawear clothes
And of course the flows
So pretty soon I'll be able to rap in Morse Code (beep beep, beep beep)
Please believe me
But enough about Jay
My resume speaks for itself
Get your keys we leavin'
Hov!

(Chorus)
Oh I'm, feelin' like you livin' a, double life
Cause you don't be comin' home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin' for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti]
But who cares, you care

(Chorus)
(Ashanti)
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
