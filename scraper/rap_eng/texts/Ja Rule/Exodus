[Ja Rule - Verse 1]
In case you don’t know the call me Loc
Short for L-O-K-I
I’mma speak for rule saying his last goodbyes
This is Exodus
This been a hell of a ride
From Venni Vetti Vicci to Blood In His Eye
In the next plan in time I just seen the rock split
And the rider's had about as rough as a ride gets
And you know that they all want to murder The Inc
But they can’t kill us, so now we got to finish these niggas
And if finish it means murder (murder murder murder) so be it like you in the soviet
Nah I'm the man with his gun
Last that I recall
They tried to mirror the God, mimic the style
Then leave them in memory of
With his fondest of memories lost, a new identeny was born
And na this ain’t a movie dog
This is murder (murder murder murder)
In the executive form
Yo Gotti I make the hits, you just give me the nod
But the air play the gun
Play from New York to L.A
The S.K's will make these niggas spin like perelaes
We had some good years but I’m tired
And yall niggas expired
And trying to put the douse to the fire
It’s like an episode of The Wire
The only difference is video tapin' us in real life
Now everybody wanna look at us and think twice
And point there fucking fingers like damn they're the bad guys

[Ja Rule - talking]
Y’all niggas don’t know we them niggas man murder INC we done been through it all done n seen it all
There ain’t nothing you can tell me nigga haha
I just wanna let ya'll know man I’ve been through so many things

[Ja Rule - Verse 2]
And if it wasn’t for the way I live life
Would a nigga pray every night to Christ?
Jesus I was just asking
Cause my prayers seem to never get answered
But mama didn’t raise no bastard
I was born with the talent
You can’t touch I call it magic
You call it music once it gets remasterd
I got with Gotti, he started making classics
It’s MURDER
It’s been a course of traffic
Trust was my only nigga's force of habit
At the time in the game everything was average
Pac had just died
Big had just died
And my nigga had a plan to keep Def Jam alive
First he sign D
Then he sign me
Then he introduced Jay
And the rest is history
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the misery
Reminiscing the Spike Lee them was the school days
We graduated with A's
But these niggas make you wanna bring out the AR's and AK's
And till they back up cause that what they gave us
When they read our indictments and various pappers
But no harm no foul them niggas is funny style anyway
Now we go hard to the edge

[Irv Gotti - talking]
That’s a good question though, See I don't understand why they would think what they thinking about its just not the case tho I love my niggas that's all
'im guilty of and that all that I ever was guilty of is the love for my niggas its all good tho I ain't streesing that shit man sometimes God has to put you
Through things that bring out the best very in who you are nigga Sam said it to me, he said sometimes greatness is not what you accomplish its wot you
Overcome. Still breathing, feel me?
