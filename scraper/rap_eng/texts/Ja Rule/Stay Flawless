[Hook: Yummy Bingham]
I gotta be a gangsta like that's what's up
Make you harder, like a semi-truck
Stay flawless like a million bucks
Stay flawless, flawless, my ladies saying
Wooooaaahhh Wooooaaahhhh

[N.O.R.E.]
Yo, yo, yo
Court cases, why the hell I'm still dumbing out?
This is years later, I should've learned lessons
Got bifocals, start seeing better
Flows like a automatic machine gun in rainy weather
I'm a whole new man, a new artist
The Rock broke up, I threw my chain in the garbage
I was disappointed, it was my fault, I thought stupid
Fast forward, all alone still think stupid
We could Ford or truck it or just Coupe it
Rims on some Eazy-E, shit straight ruthless
Tuck this Medusa with a bottom jaw toothless
Bubba cush philly smoke, sour D slinging smoke
Kick you in the face like I know judo
Get up in that ass homes, that's no Bruno
Six steps forward, back three spaces
Entourage thicker than  visitations
Feels good but it's dangerous like head with braces
From the tunnel to palladium, y'all shouldn't play with him
Got enough dudes to fill up Shea Stadium
Or Citi Field, I swear I really will
Shots fire and you ain't no apprentice
Smack your mouth numb and I ain't no dentist

[Hook]

[DMX]
Yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh
Whaaat!
Niggas stay out my way like they owe me something
But if what I'm saying is wrong, nigga show me something
Cause I been knew from the time I ran up in you
How's it going down with your clowns, I can tell you
Put it on that ass like ain't no tomorrow
And the nightmares'll get you if you live passed the horror
Last nigga that dared to step was just scared to death
Cause he knew it was the grace of God that spared his breath
Turn live niggas into corpses with the forces
Handing out losses and of-courses
This all I'm saying it's X on the flizex
Who's nizext trying they luck with the big X
Jump off the back of the truck and you'll get stuck
With knives, bitch niggas can't fuck with mine
Seeing them on the grind with dog, nigga what
Bloodhound baby, fucking shut up

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
I hear whispers that murderer's dead, and Rule got witty
It's now I'm barely living with that, I beg to differ
Two door whipper, no roof quiff-er
Bleed 'im propa, bleed that nigga
Yeah I'm definately Hefner
Three bitch in her, I want no lesser
Let's run it back like one time like Hester
Niggas gon make me KRS ya
De de de da di de de de da di day
I spit it like earlier, recently
Me and the dogs are reconciled, what now?
These niggas go in to hiding like dicks that ain't circumsized
Better recognize, my nigga N-O is still on the run
Nigga just eating a little better now
And I consider you the best
There's no pause, running that shit, get off my dick!
I'm back!
Niggas!
Ha ha!

[Hook]
