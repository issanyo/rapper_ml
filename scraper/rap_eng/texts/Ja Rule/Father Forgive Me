[Chorus]
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me
For I have sinned in a world that is broken and scorned
I should have been warned, nobody tells us
That you will live your whole life just to die, then be mourned
So what's it all for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 1]
My God...
Everybody wanna look at me deep in my eyes and see the soul
So I keep 'em closed
I'm the one the Lord himself done chose
To be a stand out and stand alone
Me, myself, and I
Is what I got in the end
You can put me in the casket or pen
Probably be a better state than I'm in
But then again, I be watching from the outside, looking in
Looking in from the outside as I reminisce
Wanna give witness, all the remembrance
For those who ain't here who'd love to hear this
Love to see this, love to feel this
Maybe you wouldn't have felt just how lonely life gets
Maybe you never see just how dark the night gets
Why is the question, and the reason

[Chorus]
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me
But do you know what they scream when they dying in pain?
They scream your name
The Lord is our Savior
That's what the pastor says every week Sunday in pray
But you're never there
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Oh Lord...
Will they ever understand us loners
Us natural hustlers that hug the corners?
And plus it feels like the world is closing in on us
Or is it just me? The one and only
(R-U, R-U, L-E, L-E)
Ain't nothing anybody really can tell me
Done been through it, done seen it all lately
I'ma get through it, just bear ya soul with me
'Cause it's all crazy, but it's all made me
Realize the gift that the Lord gave me
Wish I could sometime talk to him and save me
What would I say? I don't know, maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm lonely, only because (I)
Was born alone to die alone (my)
Life is lived to die, to mourn
Live for today, you die tomorrow, that's why...

[Chorus]
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me
But there's a life I must claim, and his life isn't mine
Please send me a sign (death)
Was the scene of the crime as he lied but his eyes wide and died
And nobody cried
All the lonely people (I look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (I look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?
