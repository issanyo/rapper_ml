[Intro: Jimi Kendrix]
Whooohoo, feel real good right here
This is your boy, Jimi Kendrix, I.N.C
Family business (I.G. What up!)
Ashanti, what up, baby? (Ja)
You ready to go?
Let's go in this club and tear it up
Oh! Now I need everybody to get off your feet
Put your drinks down
Get off the wall and stop trying to be so cute
You heard me?
Come on!
Here... we... go.. come on!

[Chorus: Ashanti]
We're gonna party through the night
Don't you wanna drink and dance tonight?
Don't try to be so cute tonight
Let the beat drop and make you feel
Oh so free

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
I got to find that thing, that thing that make me feel good tonight
Oh so good tonight
Got my girls with me, we gon' tear down this thing tonight
Down this thing tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Ashanti]
All my ladies looking hot to death
And swinging them things right to left
And everybody in the place
Has got that look upon their face
Like all I wanna do is party
Let that sweat drip off my body
So here's what I'll do

[Chorus: Ashanti]
We're gonna party through the night
Don't you wanna drink and dance tonight?
Don't try to be so cute tonight
Let the beat drop and make you feel
Oh so free

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
I just feel like I, like I could float on up to the sky
And come back feeling right
This is something I usually don't do, but I just might
Get with you tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Ashanti]
All my ladies looking hot to death
And swinging them things right to left
And everybody in the place
Has got that look upon their face
Like all I wanna do is party
Let that sweat drip off my body
So here's what I'll do

[Chorus: Ashanti]
We're gonna party through the night
Don't you wanna drink and dance tonight?
Don't try to be so cute tonight
Let the beat drop and make you feel
Oh so free

[Verse 3: Ja Rule & Ashanti]
Rule, niggas loosen up!
And button down your button up
See the gun in the club, let's tear the club up
It gets just that hot in here
Cool me down, praying O.J. and Belvedere
Over the rocks while the crowd is rocking
Everybody's rolling like we live from Woodstock
Let's all toast to the highest and utmost the Rule and the
Princess
And everbody with the two step
Get up, dance
And all my gangstas that don't dance
Lean back
'Cause this is gangstafied, soon as I testify
We all wanna party through the tonight
Any ladies that look cute tonight, send them my way
I'll show them how to loosen up, get in a cardale
Move, baby, the name is Rule
R-U-L-E repping I-N-C

[Chorus: Ashanti]
We're gonna party through the night
Don't you wanna drink and dance tonight?
Don't try to be so cute tonight
Let the beat drop and make you feel
Oh so free

[Outro: Ashanti]
Yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
