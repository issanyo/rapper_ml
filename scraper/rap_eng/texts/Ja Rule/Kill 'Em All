[Intro: Ja Rule & JAY-Z]
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
What you thought, nigga?
Uh
It's my nigga, Ja, yo
Respect that
Uh-huh
My nigga
Them niggas get outta pocket
Uh, uh, uh
My niggas need to stop playin' too
'Less we hit 'em
Know why?
All my niggas
You gon' miss
Uh-huh, yo
Top dog, my niggas
You gon' miss
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
It must be the way that I spit shit
That make you say damn this nigga ridiculous
The way I hit 'em and move, nigga that can't lose
Inconspicuous incognito niggas ain't ready
For whoever who has the flow nigga know I spit deadly
Fear me to the day I'm dead on the street with holes in me
The ghettos got love for me 'cause I'ma lay for 'em
Gradually there after
The only fib will be love and disaster
Tears before laughter, but who gon' cry?
My style be so touchin' it could wipe yo eye
Pray truce to obvious lies and dead wise guys
And any bitch niggas feel they fuckin with my's
C'mon let's get it on, to the break in the dawn
Before long, if you wrong, you be dead and gone
And I live on to glorify my name in vain
What you thought motherfuckers, I was playin'? Baby, I hit 'em all

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Ja Rule]
Lord I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For as long as I'm a alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
I want my piece of the pie, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Respect mine 'til the date of my demise, baby, I hit 'em all
Thinkin' it's a game, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Show 'em I ain't playin', I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For operatin' like lanes, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Baby, I kill 'em all, whatcha wanna do with this
Nigga nothin', so shut the fuck up
And learn somethin' see my team can get a whole town gamin'
Give it up we even take the small change
Nigga yeah uh you think my way of life fucked up right?
'Til you live it and the cash gets to eattin' at yo spirit
Fear it you be a broke nigga, you near it
You be the next nigga,never have to go back and been it
Cold stares thought you need a killa 'round here
Y'all niggas really have some pitiful ideas
I keep tryin to get this world to see
Hustle hard my mind on that money
My motto to be stack it if you got it for when you get it
Don't talk about it just be about it, that it
Went all odds against niggas gettin' rich
Figured to earn a dollar makes sense, baby, I hit 'em all

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Ja Rule]
Lord I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For as long as I'm a alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
I want my piece of the pie, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Respect mine 'til the date of my demise, baby, I hit 'em all
Thinkin' it's a game, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Show 'em I ain't playin', I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For operatin' like lanes, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Baby, I kill 'em all
Enormous style, comin' fresh out of Queens (Brooklyn!)
I recognize how my killa cliques gettin' down
Get this, while takin' yours into process, niggas is stress
Leavin' peep holes in yo chest god bless the next that get laid to rest
Frustration and stress make me question death
I wanna shoot all niggas I feel should be shot on the spot
Let 'em rot with lead in their knot
Talk shit, you bitch ass niggs be miss
Smoke weed it give you the heart to proceed
Whatcha game plan you da man
Go for your guns feel no remorse
When I leave your brain and runs
Now settle down get your shit tight
Show respect, move right, and everything is aight
But if you slip, son, that ass is gone
Top Dog motherfuckers recognize
Baby, I'ma hit 'em all

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Ja Rule]
Lord I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For as long as I'm a alive, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
I want my piece of the pie, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Respect mine 'til the date of my demise, baby, I hit 'em all
Thinkin' it's a game, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Show 'em I ain't playin', I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
For operatin' like lanes, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em
