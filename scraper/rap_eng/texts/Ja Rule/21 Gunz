[Chorus: Ja Rule]
We got M-1's, 32s, 45's, streetsweepers
Throw your guns up, 21 gunz solute
Niggas soldiers, ready to die, recruits
We got 40 cals, 44s, dilingers, 22s
Throw your guns up, 21 gunz solute
Cos you're nobody 'till somebody kills you

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Nigga you walk around like you got an "S" on your chest
But wear a vest like a condom in the city of sex and violence
Problems, get me aroused, niggas is foregone
Why Lloyd Banks got gay lovers like Star Jones?
Why Young Buck got stuck for all them fake stones?
And why the hood is screamin G-units homos?
Now I ain't sayin y'all no gay niggas, but shit
Y'all ain't acting like no straight niggas!
Cos now this bitch Fifty snitching again
I'm throwin shots to the wind
Cos me and Gotti, see, we dipping again
Cos never have two men, owe so much to so many
And I'm so glad, I'm so patient, with enemies
If revenge is the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
Then killing a pussy nigga is sweeter than busting in ya
And busting out more shots I'll do, cos you're nobody
'Till i find you and kill you!

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
We got M-1's, 32s, 45's, streetsweepers
Throw your guns up 21 gunz solute
Niggas is soldiers, ready to die, recruits
We got 40 cals, 44s, dilingers, 22s
Throw your guns up 21 gunz solute
Cos your nobody 'till somebody kills you

[Young Merc:]
Word on the streets, these niggas ridin around wth the FEDS
Like I dont still ride with one in the hand
Like I won't have one of my young'ns hop out broad day with the spread
That 'K hit, Banks fuck around and lose a leg
And Yayo slumped in the hospital bed, eatin through IVs
With a machine helpin him breath, it's INC
And I dont hate, niggas hate on me
More money more problems like B-I-G (Baby, Baby)
I'm in the hood, homie, that's where you can find me
Where we got O's for sale, not to mention a D
Got fiends on lard, nigga I go hard
14 I was moving that white on my front yard
See I'm far from a nigga that's just in the booth spitting it
Nigga I'm still living it, try me I'll empty it
I'm still dirty nigga, low in the rover, no hoster
Rule give me the word, it's over

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
We got M-1's, 32s, 45's, streetsweepers
Throw your guns up, 21 gunz solute
Niggas is soldiers, ready to die, recruits
We got 40 cals, 44s, dilingers, 22s
Throw your guns up, 21 gunz solute
Cos your nobody 'till somebody kills you

[Caddillac Tah]
I got a massacre in the cut waiting to happen
4 bitch niggas a bitch, put 'em in a ditch, dirt nap 'em
Then purse snatch 'em, chain thief, turn killer, the zoo keeper
With tranquilizers for the gorillas, nigga, get your banana peeled quick
When them hammers spit, slip, get hit and watch the blood drip
And soak your G-unit skee coat, and we on the speed boat
With bottles and smooth models that deep throat
Weed smoke in the air, literally in the lair, jet, we blowing down
OG cush by the pound, now, got a 'K with a clear clip
That hold 100 rounds, and its nothing for me trunk it
And come visit your town

[Ja Rule:]
Cos on legal grounds, the incs been aquited
But you know the hood is screaming we got away with it
Cos 50 is see-through, and nigga i see you
Lookin like a homo on the cover of GQ
Ascot in the air, literally in the air
Who dat Tyson Beckford was hitting from the rear?
Your moms was queer, lesbian, gay
So it makes sense 50 got gay tendencies

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
We got M-1's, 32s, 45's, streetsweepers
Throw your guns up, 21 gunz solute
Niggas soldiers, ready to die, recruits
We got 40 cals, 44s, dilingers, 22s
Throw your guns up, 21 gunz solute
Cos your nobody 'till somebody kills you
