[Ja Rule]
Yo, yo, Ja Rule, TQ, BABY
You ain't gotta sneak and creep
Around no more
You was my freakiest whore
Now you be dealing with broads
In my CL five double O on the DL
Hollerin' 'bout you hangin' with the females
Shit I just wanna be down
Can I eat? So to speak
Cause what you bitches fail to realize is I'mma freak
Who get you wetter?
The mo' hoes, mo' better
I'm appalled that you keepin' shit from your main nigga
Lesbianage shit I've been there and beyond baby
So bring a friend, two or three
And let 'em breed envy amongst each other
I fuck's one and shit on another
I'm in my peek throw 'em out
And call 'em up next week
And do it again one weekend
In NY or La, the Rule and TQ baby holla

[TQ]
Make me wanna holla
But still ain't changed
It's really kinda botherin' me
And stressin' out my brain
I get so angry
When I hear you on my telephone
Talkin' all crazy
Need to leave me the hell alone
I don't know

1 - How can I be down?
If you only gonna hate me
Aggravate and strain me
Always bringing me down
I don't wanna come around
If you always gonna betray me
Feeling like leaving lately
That's why I ain't coming around

Use to be my homegirl
Then you started trippin
Every time I got a new girl
You always wanna kick it
(Why you wanna?)
But then I started losing girls
Something kinda fishy
Ain't never made love to you, hell no
You lying on me viciously
So tell me

Repeat 1

Why is everywhere I go?
You're try to find me
You're running behind me
Tellin' my business to everybody
Say that you're in love
But you need to get outta here
It ain't gonna happen

Don't like women that
Can't control your mouth piece
That's why you must understand
You'll never be with me
I'm telling you...

Repeat 1 till end
