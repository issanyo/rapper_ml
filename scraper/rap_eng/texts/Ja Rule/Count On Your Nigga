[Intro]
Uh, yeah
It's Ja Rule nigga
Uh, uh, yeah
Feel this
Uh, Ja Rule nigga
It's Def Jam, Ja

[Verse 1]
Look at my lifestyle, it's dangerous
When I was young, this sorta life was contagious
Hustlin' hard like them sharks down in Vegas
My gat and I come bust spontaneous
This world made us to take only what they gave us
The game is our loss
Watch yo gloat
Then show you that this world ain't yours
Push crack like swingin' doors
And leave strips wide open
Ja's holdin'
A pair a nines and ya'll cats foldin'
My life ain't been all that golden
This rhyme hit me at a young age and kept callin'
I know I'm fallin'
Into the evil of money and drugs and lost woman
But that's what I'm lovin' about livin'
Bein' I see my birth as a givin'
Knowin' my inner limits
This game ain't no scrimmage
Let's play big, we're winners
Beg the Lord for forgiveness
For when I die please take me off your shit list
Cause I'll be nameless
Puttin' them through changes
The J to the A
Niggas know the flows crazy

[Chorus]
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt
You could count on your nigga

[Verse 2]
I got a lust for this money
Admire them old timers
Assume with no conscience
Made a world so chaotic
Opened up my mind and introduced me to narcotics
Brand new whips not this thicks the hottest chicks
I just can't seem to keep them off my dicks
The difference is y'all did y'all thing on the low
Made a lot of dough
We did our thing high pro
Though we still blew
I wish I knew dirty money was evil
I never understood until I lost a few people
Dead and gone still their memory lives on
Throw a mural up let them niggas them was loved
Now we're into better things
Got our hands on every ring
Crime in the streets
Cause it's my time
I draw the line between love and war really
Nigga you with me
You're flossin', outside that you fear me
Literally straight up and down with no cross
As God is my witness and JA is yours
I'm a spit in your directions
Hit the floors, Nigga

[Chorus]
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt
You could count on your nigga

[Interlude]
Uh, yeah
Uh

Topp dogg nigga

Uh, Uh
Ja Rule nigga
Uh, Uh

Def Jam nigga
Uh, yeah

Uh, yo
I'm big boy nigga
What the deal big boy
What the deal
Uh, yeah
All my niggas, live on
Dog
We kill 'em all

[Chorus]
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt
You could count on your nigga
Uh, yeah
