[Intro]
Yeah, Rule
Are you a figment of my imagination?
Or am I one of yours?

[Verse 1]
Believe me baby, and hear me, fear me, feel me
That's why they all wanna kill me dead
True in the head but nigga not
As soon as I get the drop
I pull up the pop of the test
It's outta the prairie
Bitches style juice running through my head
How many wanna die nigga?
My concept It's irrational
My thinking now
I'm erratic like Mike W's whose falling down
I'm losin' sight now I can hardly see
And smoking all this fucking weed
I can barely breathe
I'm like tell a bitch bleed
Squeeze on D
Run up in the deli
Wrung up on D

[Chorus]
Are ya watching me?
They be watching, niggas they be watching, keep watching
Keep watching me
Now don't look down
Are ya watching me?
They be watching, bitches they be watching, keep watching
Keep watching me
Now don't look down
Whose watching me?

[Verse 2]
C'mon watch as I creep through your block
In the hard top drop
With my bead on knock
Cause cops I ain't standing
And gangstas know
Catching before hanging
And my dogs keep banging
Cause ain't shit changing
And hustlers y'all keep slanging
We stuck in the game
Wit not a lot to gain
But everything to lose
But we soldiers that front-line
In days to rule
We do homicide drive-by's
Cock and spray
If you the last man standing
You about to lay
6 feet underground
Watch me now
Stop me how?
Y'all niggas trying to cop my style
I spit nothing but hot ones
And pop guns
Make it hard for niggas to function
Who want some of the Rule baby? (None of ya'll)
I'm legally considered crazy
But if that's the way that God made me
This world can't change me
And that's the way it'll be
Caught in the dark
Until the light shines on me
I'm a slave to this game
But I'm breakin' free
So keep watchin' me
