[Intro: Ashanti]
If you were me, what would you do
Always a lie and never the truth
Now as for me, I'm moving on
You'll always be my baby

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I just got to let you go for now
Thought I could take it for a while
Maybe you will make it back around
Baby, I just got to live my life for now
Can't see me changing for a while
Hope I can make it back around

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
Anything that I want, I can get it, boy
You know you turn me on and on
That's why I switch my frame of mind
Of being there when you call, I'm always on time
I'm looking to spread my wings and party
Everything and for everybody
Need my space, my time alone
It's like our hearts don't match no more
Still everything that you want, you can get it, boy
You know I still got love for you
In court I'll plead the fifth, my baby

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I just got to let you go for now
Thought I could take it for a while
Maybe you will make it back around
Baby, I just got to live my life for now
Can't see me changing for a while
Hope I can make it back around

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
When you was cheating, you was probably thinking
I won't sense a thing
But love got a funny way of catching up to lies
And your lies can't look me straight in the eyes
I'm not surprised that you would hurt me, baby
Though why me, baby?
Just let me breathe
And I'll fly freely

[Pre-Chorus: Ashanti]
If you were me, what would you do
Always a lie and never the truth
Now as for me, I'm moving on
You'll always be my baby

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I just got to let you go for now
Thought I could take it for a while
Maybe you will make it back around
Baby, I just got to live my life for now
Can't see me changing for a while
Hope I can make it back around

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Why in the world would you wanna leave me, girl?
Is there something out there
That you feel is better than what's here at home?
And I know a bitch can do better on her own
You're not alone, the way you hurt me, baby
Shit, why me, baby?
I feel your pain a little, but I know that love is real
And as long as I let you go that you feel
The need to come back to me, baby
Who else gon' hold you and sex you crazy?
R-U-L-E
Come on back, holla at me, baby

[Chorus (2x): Ashanti]
Baby, I just got to let you go for now
Thought I could take it for a while
Maybe you will make it back around
Baby, I just got to live my life for now
Can't see me changing for a while
Hope I can make it back around

[Outro: Ashanti]
If you were me, what would you do
Always a lie and never the truth
Now as for me, I'm moving on
You'll always be my baby
