[Hook]
When bitch niggas get you off the grind, nigga grab the nine and
When fake niggas try to cop the style, cock the 40 cal and
Well if you don't like the way its going down, nigga grip the pound
And if there's more than one that got to go, grab the calico and

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Real talk, The Inc about to run New York
Cause there's no real niggas left to hold the torch
Who gon' hold us of, cause you don't read newspaper's nigga
Let Ja tell it, that's Murder Inc boy's, that's real killers
Money laundering, tax evadin and drug dealers
Backed by Kenneth Mcgriff, you can't be serious
We just niggas getting money, fucking all the bitches
And life and death can be a matter of inches
You know
That fo' four that handle his buisness
Like capital gains, reload and hit them with intrest
Damn
What so gangsta about these niggas
Now I got the full speed niggas, led
Leave them dead over bread, or head
Cause we done fucking these same bitches
And you know they talk, and the pillows be my witness
My forgiveness
Niggas can't be this stupid
It's gun talk, niggas better get used to it

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Black Child]
I dont' care if you're a criminal or a cop, shoot or get shot
I'm raised by the plot, product of the hater
The gauge and the Glock, and I keep a blade
I ain't afraid if it pop, the gauge still a gun
Married muder one, sleep with the fishes
Tasting red rum, young and corrupted
Nothing to fuck with, straight out of the gutter
With no introduction
Our role models is forced with the hollows
Fuck slothes the swallow the fifth a holla
The witness Impala
Weed twisting ganja
Load up the clip's and flip the corner
They Morner, be morners they goners
We gangster, gangster point and blank ya'
Thank ya'
Niggas keep me in the mood
To eat a nigga food
I murder with real bombs

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ja Rule]
The nine the cal the pound the 'co, niggas
The weed the dope the E' the coke, niggas
The gauge is mine, that's all I know
I've been doing this since 9 6, the oldies know
This tough load, the 3 8 o's, I let my ho's hold
Keep it in their purses, In case of illegal searching
They got worship god, and trust the gun
Ask for your forgiveness, and send niggas up
Fucking stick niggas up, these bitch niggas touch
It's all about violence, real niggas is silent
And know these niggas whose guns got low mileage
Got ducked taped, hog tied up in their houses
I'll make you watch while I fuck the spouse
This, ain't buisness, it's personal, gun talk
When I holla your the first to know
How many hoes, and how much blood has been lost cause

[Hook]

Yeah
Murder INC
We riding here motherfuckers
