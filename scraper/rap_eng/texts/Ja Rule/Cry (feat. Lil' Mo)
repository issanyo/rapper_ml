Lil' Mo] (Chorus)
When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
[Ja Rule]
I life I love my wife
But bad times prevail, it overwhelmed me
I'm livin in hell but livin wealthy
And know these hoes love me
Because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Give me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin
Let's get the party
Cracking right here fuck V.I.P
Now when my baby loves me
Home wit tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies
She ain't surprised at me
Just surprised that we
Been together for this long
And I can be
The one to mistreat her
Thought it last forever
Cuz if I cry, you cry
We cry together

[Chorus]
[Ja Rule]
From, what I recall we was little niggas
Cuttin school, gettin high, wit the hottest bitches
Livin, life so free
That we ain't fearin
The, ills of the world
In heat of drug dealin
You and I then made a killin
And stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasures
Love is the only evil seed that could sever
A tie this close
Not the love between us but your love for the dough
You went O.T. and started makin M-O-N-E-Why
All my good niggas gotta die
Wish it could last forever
I wish death was pleasure
Cuz when you died
I cried, we cried together

[Chorus]
[Ja Rule]
Wash away your tears (my love)
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love)
I'm putting on everything that (I love)
And my pain it's my love
And I want
This world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear cuz the nigga died happily
My momma warned me life was a muthafucka
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin
And every night she'd just look at me
Wit tears in her eyes and then be saying shit like
"I don't want my baby to die"
Brought so much pain into a life
Gotta make it better
Cuz when ma cried I cried
We cried together

[Chorus]
[Lil' Mo]
Oooooohhhh
You cry, then I cry
Then we cry
When he cries
I cry together, together
When I cry, then you cry
Then we'll cry, together
Baby, cuz when
Ja cries, Mo cries
We'll cry, together
If he cry, I'll cry
Then we'll cry, together
