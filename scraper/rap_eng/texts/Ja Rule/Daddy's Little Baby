[Intro: Ronald Isley]
It's my heart
Pray
Who, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, mhm yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Daddy's little baby, must learn this world is shady
And the color of your skin don't make you less of a lady
Degrade yourself, never, 'cause I'm teaching you better
Life ain't all about cheddar, diamonds, and leather
Understand, you a black sister, in this white man's
World, don't let it get ya, down girl
It's essential that you grow amongst your group
So you don't grow too fast and be doin' Lord knows who
'Cause daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
What I do for a living is a talent I'm given
And I'ma raise you too black, too strong, beautiful
Tell the truth, let you know what women go through
Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gon' cheat
So be careful in the heat, baby girl with cold feet
Keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby, ha, yeah

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
I'll always (Always), come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby, now and ever, who

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Yo, Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and his chemistry
Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly
Put her over my knee, and let her know this world is yours
Men are dogs, take it from daddy and hold yours
Head high lady, love is 'bout lies and deception
Will always be seen through the eyes
In my demise, don't cry just, hold on
Stay headstrong, and live to learn that life goes on
The day you was born, God answered my cry for help
I look at you a female replica of myself
I was conceived 2/29, you 9/22
God, what's the science in this sign you threw?
I wanna know, just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
So she don't have to come up like I did runnin' loots
Keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby
For real

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
I'll always (Always), come back to you (You know)
I'll always come back to you
I'll always (Well, well, well), come back to you
You're my baby (Yeah), now and ever, woo
I know, I know

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
When I look in your eyes, I see stars
It's me and you against the world
Baby, it's in the signs
And anything you want you can get it, daddy's getting it done
You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
And go through rain, sleet, and snow to kiss the sun
Though my travel, through the storm has just begun
Swear to God, when my sister died, I was only five
Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
She came at the time when nobody cared for me
This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully
Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
My little lady, can't quite understand me now
But baby, in time I'll break it down
So keep yo head steady, baby, this world ain't ready
Make me proud, you're daddy's little baby
For real

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
I'll always come back to you (Oh, oh)
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever, woo
You know, I love you girl, oh yeah
And I'll always, be there for you girl
You know, you know baby
You're my baby, now and ever
And I'll always, oh, you know, you know, la-la-la-la, yeah
You're my baby, now and ever
And you know, you know, baby, know
You see I love you, girl
You're my little baby girl, yeah
You're my baby, now and ever
And I know, you know, you know
Oh you know, always, oh, always
You're my baby, now and ever, yeah know
