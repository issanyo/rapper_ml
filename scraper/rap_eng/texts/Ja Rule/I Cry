[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I love my life, I love my wife
A bad time to prevail, it overwhelmed me
I'm livin' in hell but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me
Because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin
Let's get the party
Cracking right here fuck V.I.P
Knowing my baby loves me
Home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin' her lies
She ain't surprised at me
She just surprised that we
Been together for this long
And I can be
The one to mistreat her
Thought it last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry
We cry together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
From, what I recall we was little niggas
Cuttin' school gettin high wit da hottest bitches
Livin, life so free, that we ain't fearin
The, ills of the world, in heat of drug dealin
You and I then made a killin, and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever
A tie this close
Not the love between us but your love for the dough
You went O.T. started makin M-O-N-E-Why
All my good niggas gotta die
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Wash away your tears (my love)
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love)
I put it on everything that I love
And my pain it's my love
And I want, this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear cause the nigga died happily
My momma warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night she just looked at me
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like
"I don't want me baby to die"
Brought so much pain to her life
Gotta make it better
'Cause when ma cried I cried
We cried together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry
We cry, together

[Outro: Lil' Mo]
Ooh
You cry, then I cry
Then we cry
When he cries
I cry together, together
When I cry, then you cry
Then we'll cry, together
Baby, 'cause when
Ja cries, Mo cries
We'll cry, together
If he cry, I'll cry
Then we'll cry, together
