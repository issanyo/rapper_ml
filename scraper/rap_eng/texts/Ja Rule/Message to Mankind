[Intro: Rose Royce sample]
You lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive that you would do for me...
Trouble seems so far away, you changed that right away
You abandoned me...
(But I ain't mad at cha..)

[Chorus: Rose Royce sample]
You abandoned me
You abandoned me

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
Matter of fact, I was laughing at cha
Crying with ya, thinking God would grab a napkin
Nah, he was just a hoopla, bitch, I'm a superstar, bitch
Get mine regardless
Pardon the arrogant comment
Use and knowledge but admit I schooled these niggas
And did it with honors
Gave birth to a style that is way too common now
Niggas is cocktails got my shit all watered down
Hennessy flow-er, me, R-U-L-E
Easy people, you know what them guns do
Kill any nigga that ever looked at me wrong
Who ever said my name in vain in a hook of a song
Got to be killed or reformed, disrespecting the Don
Killing bitch niggas has got to be a blessing from God
And I've been blessed with the strength to go against odds
If it was left to the fans it might've been hard, because...

[Chorus: Rose Royce sample]
You abandoned me
You abandoned me

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
This world dubbed me the soul snatcher
When Pac died it immediately put All Eyez on Me
The 5 foot 9, 165, raspy voice, you see from Queens, NY
I prospect, usual suspect
The gossip, word on the streets
This nigga Ja Rule is a problem
And runs with more shooters than Rodman
Favorite gun is the Larkin and got more beef than New York, Boston
Inc. got the U.S. Open
Time served, the south turned, turn back the time in ya Mueller
Who the, nigga.. who the, nigga..
But still I know I got it like that like Pharrell
But that didn't stop the public from giving me hell
And I won't stop continuously pressuring them
So any niggas that jumped ship can jump back in, because...

[Chorus: Rose Royce sample]
You abandoned me
You abandoned me

[Outro: Ja Rule]
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha...
