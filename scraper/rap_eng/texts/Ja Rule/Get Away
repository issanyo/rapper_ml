[Intro: ?]
You know, I've been thinking about you
And I've been thinking, we should get together
But I know you have somebody, and I do too
But I got one question. Can you get away?

[Chorus: Christina Milian & Ja Rule, both]
I've been lookin' to get away from him
I've been lookin' to get away from her
Oh, we gots to find a way, babe
I've been lookin' to get away
Since I found you

[Verse 1: Christina Milian]
Say whatever it is you need to say
Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout heading my way
This relationship is getting crazy
Lately, lately, lately
I've, been feelin' this way from back when
But now it's time I turned you in
Maybe now baby we can be friends
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus: Christina Milian & Ja Rule, both]
I've been lookin' to get away from him
I've been lookin' to get away from her
Oh, we gots to find a way, babe
I've been lookin' to get away
Since I found you
[Second Chorus - first two lines reversed]

[Bridge: Ja Rule]
Can you get away, get out tonight?
Meet me up at the club mama
Can you get away, get out tonight?
Cause I'm free baby
Can you get away, get out tonight?
Meet me up at the club mama
Can you get away, get out tonight?
Cause I'm free baby

[Verse 2: Christina Milian & Ja Rule]
Well what about my career, my man, my life?
Baby, I give you me, myself and I
And if you could get near me, there'll be no more pain love
Well come on boy and love me, love me, love me
The more things change, I know, I know men play games
All I wanna know, are you the same?
Take a chance girl and love me, love me, love me

[Chorus] (2x)
[Second Chorus - first two lines reversed]

[Bridge: Ja Rule]

[Verse 3: Christina Milian & Ja Rule]
I'm not ya man so I'm feelin' like a one-night stand
I'd be convenient for the both, I know you feel me
Well come on lets do this
No thought to it, lets give our love a chance
Cause when ya lovin' me, kiss, hug, love with me
I'm trying to get it where you can't get enough of me
Baby girl, I just wanna be free
Well come on boy and love me, love me, love me
