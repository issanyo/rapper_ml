[Chorus]
I been around the world
And gets nothin but love
For who I am
I thank my fans so much
Even though some may hate
Still I appreciate
All my friends and family
That kept it real with me

[R. Kelly]
I been around the world and back like whut up
East side to west side tourin like whut up
And even though the price for the house was so much
I still roll with them from the hood like whut up
Cuz when it comes to bein the realest I'm sho nuff
Im a straight up industry villain fo sho nuff
And I can't satisfy some of ya'll no matter what
And some a yall cats are soldier love
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Ain't nuttin but fake faces fake people fake friends
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Where there ain't nuttin but envy wannabees playa-hatas
Yea I know I need a hug but ya'll need a hug too
Cuz God gunna judge me the same day he judge you
And even though we have our struggles that's alright
You know we ghetto folks is gon' find a way to shine

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
Sometimes... this world can be so cold
When you looking through the windows of the soul
I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds
Cuz I been around this globe and back enough to know the fact
Who loves me and who loves me not
We be shit's so hot you could put it in red tops
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block
Until they heart stops that's why they fear for me
And I thank you for every blessing that you givin me lord
And I'm grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords
And all these hatas I keep shakin em off
Rubbin they face in fame I'm sorry I changed the game
But its mine and I can't complain
Rule and R Kelly, "Been around the world"
Puttin it on women "Bumpin n' Grindin" these bitches
But we always on time when a woman fed up
And that's luv, that's why they all fuck wit us
Cuz we...

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Said my lyrics is my testimony, that's how I live
I had to get rid of a lotta fake homies, I won't forgive
You see me on T.V. sometimes not how it is
Yall gotta start learnin how to separate me from showbiz
When I'm rollin through your city, show me love
And ladies when you see your boy, gimme hug
And though I'm not conceited (right)
Its jus my space sometimes I need it (right)
Said I got so many friends in them area codes
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja's lets break bread together, pray together
That we grow strong together
Its clear forever, help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together, lets cry together
And even if we grow together
Then together we can make it better

[Chorus x2]
