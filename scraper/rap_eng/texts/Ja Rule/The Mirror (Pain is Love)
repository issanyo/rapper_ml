[Chorus: Stefanee Morrison]
My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Yo, how could one ever know that I'm forgiven
This bitterness and resentment
Block the flow of God's blessings in life
You know it's stressing me, right?
Holding on in the hurt, (?) poison, them emotional scars
And locked doors that shouldn't be open
The lines is too thin like coke and cheap gin
Like ghettos that turn good kids into gunmen, I'm wondering
If all my niggas fall anything
How the fuck we gon' stand for something?
Impossible's nothing, when ya fucking with a nigga with a attitude
100 Miles and Runnin', like (?) and Cube
Like Jesus to Judas
The betrayal is nothing short of ruthless, I'll die before I pretend
I had the power to exorcise, selfish all over (?)
When I am, tempted to see the darker side of my life
I reframe, from entering into traps of temptation
But sometimes I gotta ask myself this question, Lord

[Chorus: Stefanee Morrison]
My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

[Verse 2: Ja Rule (Stefanee Morrison)]
My mind is playing tricks like, look but don't touch
Touch but don't taste, taste but don't swallow
No one's promised tomorrow
But pray for the days to follow, I'm so confused to be honest
Is my faith in the almighty or the almighty dollar?
The father, the son
A hundred to one, the bullet, the gun
Kill somebody innocently that ya love
In my lifetime I sold a whole lot of drugs
And done even more, to ease the pain, the love's gone
They say never say never, I say never get better
(?) back, then back together
Where there's pain there's pleasure
Where there's pleasure there's hate
No one hated me more than myself, it's hard to relate
To someone you know so well, or so I thought
Sometimes I look in the mirror, and see someone else
There's two of me, but I'm by myself
Ready to die, am I losing my mind?
Then look in my eyes, and my question to God
(My life, my love, is it in vain?)
All reflections of pain, that's reluctant to change
I'm transparent to love, I don't see the love in
In reflection within I'm blind, then I close my eyes and
Thank the Lord for every day that I rise
My heart, my soul, my mind
As long as I'm breathing, I'M ALIVE, the reason, I SURVIVE
The pain throughout my life, it's called love

[Bridge: Ja Rule (Stefanee Morrison)]
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is

[Chorus: Stefanee Morrison]
My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

[Outro: Ja Rule (Stefanee Morrison)]
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is
