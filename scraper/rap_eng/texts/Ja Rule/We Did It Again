[Intro]
Oww... (Yeah)
Yeah we did it (it’s on fire)
Yeah we did it (we are ready to rock this)
Yeah we did it (uh uh ye got Metallica, in here)
Yeah we did it (Ja Rule, Swiss the monster)

Lets go...

[Chorus]
Just When you thought it was over
Just When you thought it was done
Just When you Though it was safe now

We did it, did it again
We did it, did it again

[Verse 1]
Fast Cars, Fast Brauds
Cause I'm a rock and roll star baby
Born in the USA
I'm going to hit the highway
On my Harley
Do about 38
Nothing else but take it easy
Any woman what won't please me
I'll give her up
Anything that won’t touch me or move me I'll give it up
And i know your all serious

We did it, did it again

More than this, Nevermore you whipping boy

Yeah… (louder)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Believe in the air you breathing in
I'm a Mad Work Freak
With a Freaky weekend
No Matter What you spend
Because your just living it up
And damn were going to do it again
Come on, you better bring some friends
We having a party tonight
I'm bringing juice and gin
You'll beat your head
We did it, did it again

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah you know about that time
Rip that smile right of your face
Oh baby Metallica, Swiss
What you want with this?
Rip that smile right of your face
Now you get it, come on you
Rip that smile right off your face
Yeah, we did it again
Huh, oh baby Metallica, Swiss Beats
Rip that smile right off your face
There's no fucking with that
Rip that smile right of your face
