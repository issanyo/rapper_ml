[Verse 1]
Rule.. 700
You know how we do (Mpire..)
Yeah, fuck with them old jacks down on their hard luck
They say it never makes sense 'til it adds up
And that the truck is never full 'til it backs up
And that ya never been betrayed 'til friends act up, yup
What kind of world are we living in
When ya only concern is the car that I'm whipping in?
Huh, and I'm so vain, I just Twitter'd it
Didn't like the way it came so I kitted it
No bullshit, what's worse - the gift or the curse?
Whoever does it last did it better than the first in the first place
Unless ya MJ, pick one - dead or alive
I'm a Moonwalker, Space Jam on planet nine
I'm a martian, no, I'm an alien
No, I'm a rich nigga, to hoes we all green
Yeah, I'm a monster, incredible piece of a dream

[Chorus: The Script sample]
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
Yeah, yeah...

[Verse 2]
I never been, a nigga that fix it 'til he made it
If anything, y'all underpaid him
Yup, so I don't list in the Forbes
'Cause I don't wan' make ya favorite rappers look small
Muggsy Bogues, Abdul-Jabbar
The comparison's how I ball to y'all, it's
So far, it's like Earth to Mars
You ain't never gon' get there, even in a light year
Nor a leap year
'Cause every four years, I come up with a style that's a period
According to the Cartier, niggas got a year
The Audemere saying this time let's kill 'em dead, yeah
So I rhyme, no reason
I'm blessed but gotta exorcise my demons, I'm
Still alive but I'm barely breathing
And when a heart breaks, no it don't break even
And I been to hell in the name of Jesus
And prayed every night on my life it freezes
I'm falling, to pieces

[Chorus: The Script sample]
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
Yeah, yeah...
