What's your hustle? And who the fuck you represent?
When you got in the game? And where was I when you was playin?
Why the love lost? Remember son, you got put on

[Verse 2]
Ja's in a stand still, cuz niggas fail to realize
This killer instinct in my eyes, ain't to be tried
Nor denied, the fact that I sat back and watched a lotta wack
Niggas earn plaques
Congratulations, I ain't hatin
Just know my LP's in the makin
Currently waitin to holla at the nation
This world ain't ready for me
My personal thought and questions
The Gods study lessons while the weak count they blessings
Cuz money's a must, not a preference
Use my resume as a reference and gain all acceptance
