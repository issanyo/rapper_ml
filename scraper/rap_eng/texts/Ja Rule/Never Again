(talking)
Uh, you make a lot of mistakes in life
Those same mistakes keep callin us back, pullin us in
What the fuck's wrong with niggas?

(Chorus)
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
[But the streets keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]
Never again

Will I look a nigga dead in his eyes and know he's dead wrong
And don't leave him dead where he lies, it's a fucked up world we live in
I'm tired of feelin the pain but ain't fightin the feelin
Niggas can you feel me?
Cause in this world I'm alone, and trapped inside this body that's out of control
I'm hittin these streets daily
Know when I got babies to feed rarely seein 'em rarely
This game inhaled me, and like Christ on the slate, nailed me
God, please don't fail me
But it's crazy to ask upon the Lord for help
When I got guns to bust and drugs to sell
I see you in hell, muthafuckas, I ain't bitter
Cause I know snakes and snitches get it where they slither
My niggas, doin life in the pen
This gotta be what y'all thinkin, shit

(Chorus)
[Cause these hoes keep callin, they keep callin, they keep callin]

Will I make you cry baby
You know I lie, you can see it in my eyes baby
But the truth is when a woman's fed up
There ain't a damn thing you can do about love
What about us?
Why must our lawyers discuss
Who gets the kids, who gets the cribs and how we should both live
When I love ya, when we apart all I do is think of ya
But you think I'm fuckin everything that's walkin
Either skirt or the thong
It don't matter, cause in your eyes I'm dog-fuckin 'em all
I got a woman that's gone and a passion for bitches
If you lose one the other becomes your religious
So what am I to do but get the wind behind me
Ground beneath me, make it hard for hoes to reach me
Cause the Rule ain't easy
Babe, unless you're freakin please believe

(Chorus)
[But the game keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin]

Will I think these niggas friends and they foes
Cause in this rap game, you never know, just let it go
If my pain is love, my brain's on drugs
And may all my hoes thug on
And keep these punk niggas paralyzed, from the waist down
I got 'em face down is the equivalent of where I'm at now
Over the top of y'all niggas
Just a little quicker and smarter
Enhancin the game makin it harder
For niggas that freeze again like Braxton
I be hittin niggas with thrillers like Mike Jackson
I'm a problem
Number one with a bullet, I keep it up in my gun
It's hollow so when I pull it it numbs
Your whole body
Give it or take a few seconds
You'll probably, be the same nigga to dick ride me
Never again would I close my eyes
And walk through the dark backwards blind

(Chorus)
[It keeps callin, it keeps callin, it keeps callin]

Never again

(Chorus to fade)
