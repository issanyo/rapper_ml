[Intro]
Real life, real life
Fantasy, fantasy

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I'm a rock star, Rick James, Mick Jagger
Bright lights, big stages, bad habits
Get high, go to prison, and evade taxes
This is not what I envisioned when I started rapping
Fuck the mansions, the phantoms, the suites, the cabanas
'Cause none of that matters when the mirror shatters
All I see is pieces of me scattered
Is it a miracle, or is it madness?
Because when I puts it all together it reflects this
And this is me
About as close you gonna get to insanity, or genius
My real life fantasy

[Chorus: Anita Louise]
Is this my life, or am I dreaming
I can't lie, I don't believe it
Oh, I don't believe it
Oh, is this my life?

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
The talk of the fantasies, the more twisted the memories
I never thought Gotti would leave the game like D-R-E
Never thought 'Shanti would ever stop repping the team
And how the the fuck is Lloyd hooking up with the enemies?
If this was '03 I would have told you you was crazy
If you told me this is what it would be
I miss Vita, Caddi, Black Child, Charlie
I thought we were tighter then the Marley's: family
But I guess you can't be
In an industry that breeds nothing but envy
Jealousy, please nobody befriend me!
In my real life fantasy

[Chorus: Anita Louise]
Is this my life, or am I dreaming
I can't lie, I don't believe it
Oh, I don't believe it
Oh, is this my life?

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
I'm fantasizing about dreaming about a nightmare
How weird is this? It seems like somebody just lost their grip on
(Real life) fantasy, (real life) fantasy
(Real life) fantasy, (real life) fantasy
I'm on more than they're on, cocaine or methadone
I'm on this money these bitches the upper echelon
I'm on one, reality's on one
It's a thin line, here's to Christian

[Chorus: Anita Louise]
Is this my life, or am I dreaming
I can't lie, I don't believe it
Oh, I don't believe it
Oh, is this my life?
