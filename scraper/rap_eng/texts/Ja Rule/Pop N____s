[Ja Rule]
How many niggas hit the scene like Rule
Benley gt, pushin through bock flooded, with jewels
H-2 with the hungerous Rule beside me
Armed up the army, don't play that with nobody
Rule, Murder & Gotti
We hittin bitches like Lowe's be hittin switches, 16 at a time
Times that behind with me down we lose and find
X style the night that they mind we? The times
With renegades prowling this bitch with braids
Leather gloves with dark shades and sowed off day
Reminiscing the Cleo, she go to living life flawless
Who the boss, you know this
Who the god, who fawlging
Hit me I'm giving niggas 1 to 3
Y'all need 1 to 3 hours to accomplish what we have built here
You nigga know this is Rule here
I'm cocking back, I got an idea

[Chorus:]
Just hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop niggas, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block niggas, hop niggas, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome run
Hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block niggas, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome run

[Ja Rule]
Y'all niggas wanna see the N-G
I'll go watch it like it's a hundred and ten of me
Guns bustin' in every direction, the public enemy
But naah I ain't Chuck B, it's Rule baby
Y'all niggas wanna get it crazy, come on y'all can't fade me
The music is slavery, roll up and haze
Because most niggas is lazy cotton pickers
Wish they'd find out it's me and my niggas they gone
'cause they prisoners of they own home, we party and get it on
Live it up! As soon as we hit em home
We tuckin away the chrome and humpin up on some hoes
We dem niggas you love to hate... I know
Who cares I been blowin your bitch back out for years
Plus she shared so many tears for me
While you was away, was around the time I made "Put It On Me"
So homie, stay from 'round here you ain't know, this is Rule here
I'm cockin back, I got an idea

[Chorus:]
[P. Williams]
Yeah, you feelin hot tonight well look it here playboy we could go outside
(x2)
Huh, you feelin hot tonight well look it here lil' mama we could go outside
(x2)

[Ja Rule]
Certain niggas need to be kissed in the ground that I walk
Shuttin up when I talk, it's Rule in full floss
5-0 is tellin him X marks the speasy
How niggas gettin this money, it can't be this easy
Believe me, I see between cracks and crevices
Angelic and devilish, who thinks better than this
The shell love and angel live in the darkest angles, this is Rule here
I'm cockin back I got an idea

[Chorus:]
[P. Williams]
Yeah, you feelin hot tonight
Well look it here playboy we could go outside (x2)
Huh, you feelin hot tonight
Well look it here lil' mama we could go outside (x2)

[Chorus:]
