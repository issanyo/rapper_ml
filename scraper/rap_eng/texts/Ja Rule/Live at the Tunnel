Everything yeah, yeah

[Hook]
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all, It's murda

[Black Child]
Respect a thug, or accept a slug
Or accept the death of somebody you love
That's the rules we live by, ways I kiss by
We all Murderers in the eyes of all ours
So when I pull a bubble up and back in your car
When I spit 16's you gona wish they was sparks
Can you hold something, you can hold heat you can keep
Slugs in your sleep while I'm plugging your freak
I'm the thug of the week, the killer of the millenium
Spitting like a mack 10 and a 9: Eminem
Blasting off like Flex on New Years
Who cares how many slugs y'all spit in the air
Niggas over here got Glock 19's, P89's, hollow points, and M16's
357's and mack11's
We clap you come to the funeral...

[Tah Murdah]
Motherfucker if your holding them ?? nigga
Then I'd advise nigga, we rip the high niggas
Don't matter the size niggas
Ever since I popped up, alot of niggas done got stuck
While I'm laying the cut, meant that's rocked up
Believe it's murda
Niggas get popped up, burryed and chopped up
We don't give a fuck if the cops get touched
A ?? and a baby blue drop
With a stash box holding a 5th and two Glocks
And every 16 I spit I ??
And won't stop firing, firing until I got, a 4 full of money
And playboy you bunny
Yo you get us a clip of hollow tip slugs from me
Bitch nigga, acting out the life of a thug money
I hustle and, grind those block for drug money
And make sure, kept counting every stack
We drop bombs like Flex and Big Kap

[Hook]
Fuck that
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all, It's murda

[Ronni Bumps]
Oh why must children die
I guess the lil' nigga want the peice of the pie, let 'em die
Oh why must thug niggas snitch
I guess the lil' nigga thought he'd get a lil' rich, lil' bitch
That's why we don't talk quick
Cause niggas who talk quick get killed for the bricks
This is it, that's why we walk with our guns
Cause those without guns get killed by guns

[Ronni Bumps]
?? the one that will kill you son
It's the same where ever we from, it's the slums
We spit guns, lay you down for the 1
I love when niggas talk slick with they tounge
You ain't buying no one, you talking shit
I'm from the place get killed for shit
So fuck where you from, better start from day 1
It's amazing...

[Vita]
Murda mommy in every song
You was warned, should of listened when I told ya
It's comming to a closeure
And almost over now
Go to war like a solider now
And you rat broads running my style, I'm shutting you down
From NY to LA,Vi-ta from Jersey
More of a bitch then a lady
Chase chips, slick bitch
With flows that's sick, and it only gets worse...

[Hook]
Fuck that
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
That y'all, It's murda

[Ja Rule]
Murda, is the way of the walk
And since I walk a thin line, I'm looking at niggas with dead eyes
And I'm baptized, my body has sined
A lil' weed, a few hoes, and a whole lot of head
Got me hollering, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
About nothing at all, front
I'm blasting off, killing you with probabal cause
Cause you probabal of thinking that you hotter then I
It will never be untill I die, and tourch the sky
Hells angel, fly
I feel like I'm at war fighting for my inner self fighting for my life
This world made me a, Murderer
May the lord take you, before I murder ya
Bodies turning up, and who you think got 'em all touched
Muderers, is on your block catching the rush
Like niggas can fuck wit us, they all gonna fall
Rule nigga, It's like that y'all
