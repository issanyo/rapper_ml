[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]
Word to mother, my nigga Buck 3000 on the boards
Holla back ... hey Terry you gon' be big boy
Y'knahmsayin? ... aiyyo, aiyyo Jody
Hey you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit, get that bottle of Voo
Out the back of the back for me baby
I need to get right before I do this here
Uh huh

[Hook - Lloyd and Alexus]
(Why me and you)
Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up
(What we been through)
It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you)
And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through)
Just imagine what life be without me

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Mami I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward
Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged, but you ain't too proud to beg
First time we got alone, you gave me some head
And been calling me ever since, to do it again
When we met you was a seven, just creeping to ten
And now your my lucky quarter, the days get shorter, lights get longer
You know when the weather is cold, feelings grow stronger
Wanna perform her, your pussy feel like walking pneumonia
Got me sniffling, sneezing, coughing, and aching and shit
And I'm starting to think I'm falling in love with this bitch
I'm having dreams about her jeans and how they fit
In that Urban Jeffrey baby tee
She's wearing my name already, so you know she's fucking me
I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards
The only question I ask myself is ... shit

[Verse 2 - Ja Rule]
Why me? Better yet why you and I?
Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?
Singing "Dangerously In Love" ... this a dangerous broad I'm fuckin
Like Al it's the "Scent of a Woman"
That got me playing hardball like Doc Gooden
Excuse my intruding, I don't mean to be rude, but our situation is kinda amusin'
Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other
It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers
And my niggas can't tell us, what we been doing is wrong
And your girl's getting jealous, cause we been getting along
Hold on, this is how it all begins
You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends
And hang out at the mansion, in the Hamptons on weekends
Then it all ends, and the question is ..

[Break - Lloyd]
Have you even been touched like I touch ya?
Been held like I hold ya?
Been loved like I love ya?
Be real, be real
Have you ever been seen like I see you?
Been heard how I hear you?
Been felt how I feel you?
Be real, be real

[Verse 3 - Ja Rule]
Girl your my (sunshine)
But sometimes it gets a little cloudy don't it?
Them sunny days
I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya face
It'd be great to get up every morning to eggs and steak
But you can't relate, so we separated on good terms
No one's concerned, about who ya been fucking, and who ya fucked last
But when I see you, still the question I ask is ..
