(Chorus:) [ Ja Rule, Ashanti]
I wanna be your chick
I wanna be down for you
( Do you trust me? ) Yeah
( Love Me? ) Yeah
( You're puttin' it on me ya must be )
Ya down ass chick
I wanna be your chick
( It ain't only for the RULE BABY )
I'd ride for u, die for you
Do anything ya want me to
I be ya down ass chick

[ Ja Rule ]
This is no intentions of bein' offensive
To women by callin ya'll bitches
My down ass bitches
Still my queen bitch's cut look clean'
On ya finger next to the finger ya flipped at me
And this no in between me and you
Only me and you
Who else gon' put it on u like the RULE
God only looks after children and foo's
And ya not so who gon' look after you
It's true baby

[Vita]
True baby
It's only for you baby
Vita thighs only divide if you inside
Cuz i love the way you touch me
Nobody can get it
And if it's comin' and gunnin'
Just come in it and spit it
So when ya gone for a minute
I just fantasize like if it's you it's all in it
Then I'm satisfied til' you come back to me
Holdin' stack and jewels
V-I-T-A and my nigga J-a Rule baby

{Chorus}

[Ashanti]
I'm gonna be here when ya need me
RULE baby can always count on me
And you don't ever have to worry
You know I'll make it in a hurry
I'm here for ya
And i won't never leave shead tears for ya
Cuz boy ya got to me
There'll never be another for me
You'll always be my one and only

[ Ja Rule (Ashanti) ]
Babygirl would ya bust ya gun with me? ( Yeah Yeah )
Lie to the feds then come get me? ( Yeah Yeah)
And if i died would ya kill for me? ( Yeah Yeah )
Are you trustin me? ( Yeah Yeah )
Are you lovin me? ( Yeah Yeah )
Yea let's get is grinnin
Lide we asked for the Simpsons or Ike and Anna May
On one of their good days
You smile like sun rays 5'5 with brown eyes and thick legs
Only for the RULE baby

{ Chorus }

[ Charlie Baltimore ]
Now baby i told you i can show you
Better than i can tell you
Blow trial and bring the conversey and mail
U dem sweet words and naked flicks
I'm still that pretty down down ass 2 cars behind ya 6
And i diss any clown ass cockin my round ass
Only a down ass
And it's all for you
I'm grown a tad bit since we been at it like rad bits
To move a little bumper and it's
[ (Ja rule) AND IT'S ALL FOR RULE ]
Shit Who gon' love you like that?
Thug with you wit a stak to the ceilin
And split in the dub with you
Cuz i played my position with KO-D's, O G's
Until that blood shed blood red and we O-Ded
Remember every word that ya told me
[ ( Ja Rule ) SHOWED ME HOLD ME ]
All you need in your life is
Chuck, drugs, and dubs on 22's
Now tell me who the hunny for you
Chuck

[Chorus 2x]
