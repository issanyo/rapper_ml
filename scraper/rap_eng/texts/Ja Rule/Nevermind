[Intro: Darriald]
Now...what am I supposed to do
Seems like I always fall for someone just like you
All these problems weighing on my brain, got me so confused
Stuck in the moment,damn what should I do?

[Verse 1: Darriald]
Nevermind forget it
Us children weren't meant to be the same that's why I'm... different
Apparently not even the same thing I'm barely..uh... Living
The life I was born to live so I guess that I'm..um...skidding
Across the fine mind that wasn't deemed mine
Or that's how I feel most of the time
I feel like I just can't relate
So I hesitate
To avoid the need to conversate
Everyday I have dreams after I wake
Seems like I always deal with heartbreak
Counting these cards never made mistakes
But there will be a day I do and I pray god won't forsake
Me
Just a another kid that doesn't fit in with society
And unlike my peers I don't party and live in sobriety
And I'm an outsider constantly filled with anxiety
Just a misfit
Now I understand mother
Me growing up with a brother
Also a sister, we really need each other
So when you gettin' mad at me...I..get it
You come home from working 12 hour shifts, you told me to wash the dishes and I'm really sorry mother but I..um... didn't
Why am I so decadent
Why am I so irrelevant in every situation that I've ever ever ever been
In
I don't understand am I going crazy?
I gotta be my dad must've known when I was a baby
And lately
He even had the nerve to call me
I picked up the phone and we hardly
Even talked all he really said was sorry
Man I don't give a fuck about your god damn apology
And there I sit moping
Mixing emotions with potions in my mind hoping
That I could hold onto my body to pry open
And pull out a token
To this game of life man I need another try
10 bullets to Darriald's head Then I die
10 bullets to Darriald's head Then he dies
Suicidal thoughts just to cover up the lies
Inside my disguise
12 gauge.....12 gauge to the fa-ace
Pop some bullets in my mouth to see just how it ta-aste
Take over my mind take me to a different pla-ace
I wanna talk to someone about but...just...

[Hook: Darriald]
Nevermind forget it
Us children weren't meant to be the same that's why I'm... different
Apparently not even the same thing I'm barely..uh... Living
The life I was born to live so I guess that I'm..um...skidding
Forget it
Nevermind Forget it
That's why I'm...um...different
Forget it
Nevermind
