[Intro]
Dice are rolling, Knives are out
With the present danger all around
I don't say they mean harm, but they'd each give an arm
To see us six feet underground
See us 6 feet under ground
See us 6 feet under ground
Yeah, uh, yeah
Give it to 'em
It's Murda I N C

[Chorus]
Uh, the Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
'Cause they don't understand me
And while I'm holdin' up I know you smilin' down
At all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)

[Verse 1]
Look at me now hittin' 'em up holdin' it down
'Cause I'm destined to be I know you love to see me
(6 feet underground) why see do the Devil's Eyes
You vision my demise so may your soul lie
(6 feet underground) and before that I believe
That I can fly most people gettin' lye my niggas is gettin' by
If you can't see we Benzes ya jags, we forward ya last
We diamonds ya glass, we get pussy y'all ass, give me love
We be wearing gloves tied up in gloves with special 38 slugs
So we don't end up (6 feet underground) the butch is hittin' 'em
The rule is to get rid of 'em for those who feel they getting away
Ja we sendin' 'em (6 feet underground) I've feel I've cursed
My body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin' more than to see my niggas eat with me
But my enemies want nothin' more than to see me (6 feet underground)

[Chorus]
The Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
'Cause they don't understand me
And while I'm holdin' up I know you smilin' down
At all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)
The Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
'Cause they don't understand me
And while I'm holdin' up I know you smilin' down
At all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)

[Verse 2]
I'm so ignorant 'cause I done played my last tears
And pain is bliss been through so many things
It's hard to resist a mind that's currently
Thinking on his last wish it's nothing to fuck with
When I know what I want because you must think I'm a fool
Claiming you love what I do and be out playing the Rule
Bad move, more cars, more hoes, more jewels, and I'd love
Nothin' more than to see you (6 feet underground) doesn't
Matter how we gonna get outta weed rollin' it outta windows
Nor from Adam? but we show them uh now we leave them niggas
Creating a deal let it open so won't be goin' (6 feet underground)
Because I've feel I've cursed
My body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin' more than to see my niggas eat with me
But my enemies want nothin' more than to see me (6 feet underground)

[Chorus]
The Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
'Cause they don't understand me
And while I'm holdin' up I know you smilin' down
At all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)

[Verse 3]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Baby the Rule can't die tonight
(6 feet underground)
Now all my niggas is ya wit me, yeah
All my niggas is ya wit me, yeah
You start I warned em' that I ain't
Livin right niggas might see my life as
Sort of a sacrifice money, bitches, and ice
But fuck it whoa whoa something let me
Still to something ride 125 in a low low frontin'
It's free will emotion you know I'm high flickin' ashes
At police while I'm ridin' by I'm ghetto I don't fear
Is deeper than love if you want to get it nigga then
Come on nigga get it in blood because I've feel I've cursed
My body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin more than to see my niggas eat with me
But my enemies want nothin more than to see me (6 Feet Underground)

[Chorus]
The Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
'Cause they don't understand me
And while I'm holdin' up I know you smilin' down
At all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)
The Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
'Cause they don't understand me
And while I'm holdin' up I know you smilin' down
At all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)

[Outro]

Yeah, it's Murda Inc., baby so what you want, baby
Ain't none of this 'cause ya niggas ain't crazy
