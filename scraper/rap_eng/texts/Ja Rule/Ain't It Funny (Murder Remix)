And our situation won't matter

In the freakiest manners

Off the wall

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't it funny
It's been awhile since you came around
Now ya wanna see what's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me how ya want my time
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind (on your mind)
See it never had to be this way
You should of never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame
Knowin how the situation changed

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say

Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't it funny

[Jennifer Lopez]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' cuz my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me

[Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce
Tryin' to blind me with your bling bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing

Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool
