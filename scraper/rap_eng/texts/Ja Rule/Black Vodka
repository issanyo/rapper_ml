[Chorus]
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me

[Verse 1]
She better come straight with no chaser
'Cause ran this motherfucker, I'd chase her
And she the only one I got a taste for
All drinks is on me, I can taste her
'Cause I know that you see me through the glass
So cool it down boy, they call me Ice cube
You always go down so smooth
I think I'll have a double with you
Vodka came with Khalua
And vermouth for guesses to three
And this is how I see you
A couple more'll make 'em all look like Shakira

[Pre-Chorus]
A few shots of tequila, it might kill you
Or it's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

[Chorus]
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me

[Verse 2]
I very rarely drinking on a weekday
But this was the day after Tuesday, hump day
So I make an exception to the rule
Got cocktails for two, it was only me and you
Ugly, like a hangover
Had a fuck and get drunk and call my ex over
She will remain sober
But have you ever seen this bitch with her clothes off
We turn the lights off, lit up some candles
She was the OJ, I was the Smirnoff
Cancel, it's like when the show's over
House lights off, everybody go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause too much of petroleum might kill you
It's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

[Chorus]
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me

[Verse 3]
Pretty brown eyes, beautiful lips
Dark complexion like licorice
I run my finger around the edge of the rim
Of my shot glass, body's an hourglass
It's summertime, still got class
Still the best shot a nigga ever threw back
You finna get me drunk fast
Hit me home, strip me down, butterfly effect
You so fly (so fly)
I'm so high (so high)
I can't lie, no matter how bad I want you
You ain't ever gon' feel like the fir≈°t time

[Pre-Chorus]
And too much tequila might kill you
But it's more than likely to get your mind blown
Feel me, more importantly you feel love
If not, maybe you didn't have enough of that

[Chorus]
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
Black vodka, body so proper
I love the way she is on top of me
