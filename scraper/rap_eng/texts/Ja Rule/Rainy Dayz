[Intro: Ja Rule]
Ha ha, here we go again
Rule, Mary J. Bilge
Woo! Holla, ha ha

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ja Rule]
It's just those rainy days
Spent a lifetime trying to wash away
'Til the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me
On all those rainy days
Spend a lifetime trying to wash away
'Til the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
We're always living so crazy and sexy and cool
And we begin to love it (begin love it)
Watching all the heartache and pain of the world
And think nothing of it (thinking nothing of it)
Baby I got love for you
And I know that you got me baby (got me baby)
But every time the sun shines bright it gets so cloudy, oh

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ja Rule]
It's just those rainy days
Spent a lifetime trying to wash away
'Til the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me
On all those rainy days
Spend a lifetime trying to wash away
'Til the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige & Ja Rule]
'Cause nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it, it always seem to fall
Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell you before about chasing those waterfalls, yeah
'Cause nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it, it always seem to fall
Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell you before about chasing those waterfalls, yeah

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Rule
Mary baby, see it just a sin
It's the path that I'm on, in this midst of madness
And my rain is a tad bit, to wet for the average
Yeah, and I can see it her eyes
That she's scared of the soul collision by Rule and Blige
In my demise, smile on them Rainy Dayz
'Cause that's the Lord shedding tears on my grave
And it's so real it's funny, Rule and Gotti rain supreme
And hail down money, but the storm's still coming

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige - rapping]
God, it ain't easy for none of us
Ghetto children growing up alone, all we do is cuss
Mad at the world, cause no one told us about the storm
And they ain't give enough love to keep us warm (no love, no love)
Every time I look around my people are dying
Stressed out, pissed off, but I'm keep on trying (what)
To make sure me and you we make it through this maze
'Til the sun shines again on these rainy days

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ja Rule]
It's just those rainy days
Spent a lifetime trying to wash away
'Til the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me
On all those rainy days
Spend a lifetime trying to wash away
'Til the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
I feel like an angel, mend my broken wings
So I can soar again, Lord let me in
And through all the passion and the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin' (yeah)
Makin' promises of love to those that spread love
And for those that can't take it, stand up
Baby we gon' make it and the words of Marvin Gaye
"War is not the answer"

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ja Rule]
It's just those rainy days
Spent a lifetime trying to wash away
'Til the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me
On all those rainy days
Spend a lifetime trying to wash away
'Til the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige & Ja Rule]
'Cause nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it, it always seem to fall
Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell you before about chasing those waterfalls, yeah
'Cause nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it, it always seem to fall
Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell you before about chasing those waterfalls, yeah
