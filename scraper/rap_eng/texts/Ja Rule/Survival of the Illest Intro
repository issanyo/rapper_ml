[Verse 1]
For the first time in my life, I feel the love from my
Bitches and thugs, spit game and throw slugs
It's the Ruler, live by, take it in blood
Cuz it's the J to the A to the death nigga what
Don't get it fucked up, I'm as hot as it gets
I make hits while y'all niggas best shit be the skits
Can't be serious, tryin to see Ja with blindfolds
I take em off, I'm lookin at you with your eyes closed
You can't see to know, my niggas get dough
Live fast, set you up and rob you slow
Can I, be forgave for cursin your name?
Will I, be the last nigga to shed my pain?
If not, I'm a spit flames till I'm dead and the angels sing
Cuz when you hot that's what this game'll bring
And I'm sick with this, my flow is fuckin ridiculous
When Ja's on the premesis niggas is gon get it
For the fearless, you a little hard headed, you needs to feel it
Clap on em, let these niggas know you dead serious
Niggas comin at who? Ja Rule?
Nigga what the fuck, you brand new? You ain't know?
Hoes get dicked, properly dealt with
Meanin you die slow, like I'm givin out hives in stereo

Put it on the streets like rock that's chopped up
What the fuck?

Yeah, all my niggas locked down
Chris Black, Black Child, Big Snails
Robo Jus, Big Rail
Yeah, all my niggas

[Verse 2]
This young blood here came up hustlin
Livin corrupted, lickin shots and fuckin
You live to love it, once you're Armor All-in
Your low pros on your west C 400
Residential rolly flooded, with carats
Time to get this pimp shit established
You hoes don't know? I'm extravagant livin lavish
Alias Don (?) Barnes, hun, funds unlimited
Backed by my 'preme team crime representatives
We in this, to settle some sure unfinished business
With deadly intentions, redemption
Rollin live Rovers with new suspension, over niggas
When I quest for nine digit figures
Bitch, we poppin Cham', Cristal, caddy corner from Jigga
Yeah, we them provacative, million dollar click niggas
Up the emmys, prefer crew with linen
Love the devil and women I keep em sinnin
God forgive me, just as filthy as the next nigga
No excuses, but just put in work for Lex Lugers
Laptop computers, the power of smack
This wasn't Compton, look how they snatched black on falls back
I feel that, you like a part of me that I need back
In prison, out of control but driven
]From the island to Clinton, down state to up state
The cell shit could mentally frustrate
With all gray, crimi-nals
Show strength, consolidate with the best a y'all
No doubt, so as we eagerly await your come out
I'm constantly avoidin comin in
But either way we gon walk again, side by side
CMC till I die
When they setenced you five, my heart died
Two loves niggas

Uh, Irv Gotti, yeah Jigga
Ha, my nigga O
Live fast die slow, motherfuckers
