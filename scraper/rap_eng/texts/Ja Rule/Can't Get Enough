[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo
This is some of that old futuristic Mr. Spacely type shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on
Talk about it

Hey shorty, love, what the deal, yo?
Let me hit that on the low low
Don't tell your friends, that's a no-no
Cuz if she knows, she's gon' wanna go home with me
Riding this nigga like you're suppose to be
All up on me, like bonin' me
But enough about her, see me in 10 minutes
In 30, I'm up in it cuz

1 - 	I'mma put it on you until you can't get enough
	I'mma work your body until you can't get enough
	I'mma kiss the kitty until you can't get enough
	Is that enough (It's not enough)
	Is that enough (It's not enough)

2 - 	I'mma put it on you until you can't get enough
	I'mma work your body until you can't get enough
	I'mma kiss the kitty until you can't get enough
	(It's not enough, it's not enough)

27, 28, 29, 30
I'm in the bedroom all up in her legroom
But really though, how I like it, yo?
Spreadeagle with her toes to the ceiling, yo
Breaking it
I'm deep in the puddy and she's taking it
I'm thinking how long can I stay in it
About another 30 minutes
A 40 ounce and some Guinness
And shorty I'll be my witness that

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Enough

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 2
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

Let it ride
Let it ride
Let it ride
