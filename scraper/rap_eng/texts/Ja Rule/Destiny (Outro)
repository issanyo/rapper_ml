[Intro]
Yeah, yo, yo, yo, YO! Holla (holla)
The Last Temptation, uh, we comin' through now niggas
It's a problem (a problem), it's a problem (a problem)
Always has been, hahaha... ayo Buck...
Turn me up a lil' bit in my motherfuckin' headphones and shit
C'mon, and let these niggas know (niggas know)
Let 'em know...

[Verse]
Muh'fuckas y'all want war with the God, c'mon, y'all know better
I put holes in ya leather, reknit your sweater
And I bet the flow's wetter than ocean front property
Better come at me properly
Niggas better off poppin' me, but I believe
Y'all scared to clap them hammers
And the fact that I'm unpredictable, gives me the advantage
What the fuck, am I'm speakin' Spanish, niggas?
What I got to tell y'all in detail how we murder niggas
Handle ya business
The Inc. is religious, Murder's the sacrifice
We throwin' M's niggas, that means Murder for life
And I'll die for that red and black
That house with the cheddar stack and the smiles on my kids faces
What could replace this?
This lil' nigga here done come to grips with death to taste it
My air's thick and filled with hatred
Surprise of that look in my eyes, but don't be
I'm just following the footsteps the Lord done pave me
If I go crazily insane
I'ma blame it on the world, look what I became
'Cause they give me all the fame and the money mayne
Made me an icon
So the world can catch a nigga with his lights on
That's the pros and cons, ya never quite free
But just gimme a lil' room so I can breathe
And my pain gon' be the death of me
But to be loved is my destiny, my black people...

[Outro]
Yeah (yeah), we out (we out)
Holla (holla.. holla..)
