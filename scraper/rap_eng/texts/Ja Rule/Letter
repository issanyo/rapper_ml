[Rap Verse: Ja Rule]
I've been non-stop, since day one, keeping it gangsta
Never thinking 'bout consequences, I keep runnin'
What to say to mean don't mean nothin'
Just keep your head up
The way I been living, my lifestyle's gettin' me fed up
From New York to Japan, we breaking bread
While the world is at war and slangin' lead
You and I's, Too Hot For TV like Making The Band
Now get up and dance, and all my bitches, shake that ass
Non stop
