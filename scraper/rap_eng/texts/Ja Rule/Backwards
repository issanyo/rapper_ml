[Refrain: Dirashi]
I can't feel my face
Boy I'm on a 3 peat
I swear I am not the one who's fake
Thats the ones you used to see me with
I learned from my mistake
Now I flip a CD
For the homies back in Indy state
I'm tryna fuck on Dreezy

[Chorus: Dirashi]
Boy I'm blunt as fuck
Feels like I'm moving up
But I go backwards back
My lungs erode
I smoke all out the bowl and have an asthma attack
We put in work
Dreads on my nigga Kirk
He keep that hammer packed
That gun go Bdiing
That's an east side ting
Feel like Baka Trav
I'm high as fuck
Feels like I'm moving up
But I go backwards back
I’m feeling me
She has double D
I go and attack
That ass is fat
She go bring me back
To her crib I smash
Then I Tay-K dash
Out of her home
Pass to bro Like Nash

[Verse 1: Dirashi]
She gold diggin' so I leave her wondering like Stevie
I leave all that fuck shit for the birds, she a kiwi
But I cannot complain when I palm her ass like KeKe
And my brother stay gettin' laid but he still toting that fifi
I don't remember you I don't wave
That's so you know that I'm not fake
I see all these niggas tryna surf my wave
Y'all can barely slide the sand by a lake, yuh yuh yuh
I just fucked my bitch down to Lil Boat 2
I remember when you played us in high school
Now you all up in my face nigga you a joke too
You like Tiger you a woods to me, we will smoke you

[Chorus: Dirashi]
Boy I'm blunt as fuck
Feels like I'm moving up
But I go backwards back
My lungs erode
I smoke all out the bowl and have an asthma attack
We put in work
Dreads on my nigga Kirk
He keep that hammer packed
That gun go Bdiing
That's an east side ting
Feel like Baka Trav
I'm high as fuck
Feels like I'm moving up
But I go backwards back
I’m feeling me
She has double D
I go and attack
That ass is fat
She go bring me back
To her crib I smash
Then I Tay-K dash
Out of her home
Pass to bro Like Nash


[Verse 2: Mid Yaki]
Look up real nigga
I’m on page three
It never phased me cause money never made me
You niggas are pastries
You can never play me
I wanted to be JAY Z
But honestly i can be
Cause i ain’t got Hov money
So instead we gone make some guwap off yo money
Make a kill probably get a lot off show money
It gets real if you try to take my dough from me
Them are not my niggas, i don’t trust them niggas
Trust fall
Fall back I don’t trust y’all
Yeah

[Refrain: Dirashi]
I can't feel my face
Boy I'm on a 3 peat
I swear I am not the one who's fake
Thats the ones you used to see me with
I learned from my mistake
Now I flip a CD

I'm tryna fuck on Dreezy

[Chorus: Dirashi]

[Verse 3: Dirashi]
I am not a bird man but I demand respek
Two, Three Gucci Ghost chains around my neck
I swear I see all you thirsty hoes tryna chase my check
But a nigga stiff arm is golden it will protect

[Outro: Dirashi]
That shit will protect, ay that shit will protect
Stiff arm is golden that shit will protect me
I feel hella sexy when I stiff these hoes
