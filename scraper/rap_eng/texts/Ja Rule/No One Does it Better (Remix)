[Chorus: Ashanti]
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
No one does it like murder inc
(Repeat once)

[Black Child]
When it comes to guns
I'm similar to a professional killa
A-K's and dilingers
They say they ain't feelin us
Who gives a fuck
As long as when we're dead they remember us
Keepin it gangsta (Ya) Baggin bitches
The baddest bitches, pullin out the mack wit niggas
Jumpin out the Jag wit deep dishes, Wit freak bitches
Got beat bitches
I love my, street bitches
And no one does it like Murder Inc
Two steppin in the club witout spillin our drink
Then we rollin out on drugs, that's built by Brinks
Bitches comin out they clothes, before they can think
And we ain't gon stop, doing a damn thing
We could make it pop in the block or the bing
I don't know if it was the watch or the ring
Or because the way Ashanti sings

[Chorus: Ashanti]
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
No one does it like murder inc
(Repeat once)

[Caddillac Tah]
Yo
These niggas picka-boo
Stickin they head in and out of the hood
But I aim good, and hit em up
Woods, gets twisted up
Nothin but that stinky stink
No vest on my chest flood out peeks and links
Never the less, we pressin em wit the four car (let's do it!)
Thats when the head and body'll fall next to it
Fuck yappin, i'm clappin to let the check do em
Dirty, if you jam my other hand a thirty-thirty
And you ain't savin the club
My wolves'll pound you
Get layed down wit that white choke jawed around you
Ya dog, we serious
And dog we livin this
Never no gimicks and
Hold off petty shit
And nobody fuckin wit the Inc
Ain't no body as ill as the Inc
Coups and snorkle minks
(Head cracks!) everytime I'm rollin the Dodge
(Murda!) Motherfucker for life

[Chorus: Ashanti]
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
No one does it like murder inc
(Repeat once)

[Ja Rule]
GET READY FOR RULE NIGGAZ!
Cuz I'm just gettin started ya heard me?
Got rappaz older than James Worthy tryna serve me
You kiddin me? you think chasin my style is the remedy?
Boy heres my format, now niggas fall back
When you get it right, you gon know
Cuz baby girl be hollerin "no no"
Fuck that, I'm gonna kill all of y'all niggas slowly but surely
Til the click and curtain boys Rey, Tom and Pauly
Ho's can't ignore me, while I'm ticklin their clit
On the hood on the 6, smashin the Marvin Gay classics
Hit dimes on the average, shit, y'all know me baby
No body does it like Murder Inc

[Chorus: Ashanti]
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
No one does it like murder inc
(Repeat once)
