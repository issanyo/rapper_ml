[Intro]
What's my name
R-U-L-E
Blowing back on mary jane
And analyzin' the game
The game done chose me
To bring the words I can't say, it's one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I'll be makin' less room for you
Only God can hold me
Judge me, the only man that help is above me, holla

[Verse 1]
I've met so many men and
It's like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feelin' sexy
Who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is
Their insecurities

[Pre-Chorus]
Tired being alone (yeah, yeah)
Sick of arguin' on the phone (yeah, yeah)
Tellin' all your friends (yeah, yeah)
But your man don't understand my love

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, the style of your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2]
Now I've been thinkin' bout this relationship, and I wanna know
Is this as good as it gets
'Cause we've been through the worst times
And the best times
But it was our time
Even if it was part time
Now they be lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we're gettin' married
Hard lovin', straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this for nothing
Hoppin', poppin'
Let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind
Sun glistenin' off my skin, hey!
And I'm nasty, and you know me
You still don't mess with your baby

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, the style of your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 3]
Now people loving me and hating me and treating me ungratefully
But not knowin' that they ain't makin' or breakin' me
My life, I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breath again, baby I can breath again
People screaming "what the deal with you and so and so"
I tell them bitches "mind your biz," but they don't hear me though
I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I can breath again, baby I can breath again

[Pre-Chorus]
Tired being alone (yeah, yeah)
Sick of arguin' on the phone (yeah, yeah)
Tellin' all your friends (yeah, yeah)
But your man don't understand my love

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, the style of your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
And I can't go on without you
