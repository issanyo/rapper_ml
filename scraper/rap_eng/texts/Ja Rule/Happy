[Intro: Ja Rule]
Right back at y'all
It's the world's most talented record label: Murder Inc
And that angelic voice you hear in the background
Oh, that's our new princess of hip hop and R&B
Miss Ashanti, haha

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
Boy, you fill me with so much joy
You give whatever it is I need
My love here to stay, won't ever leave
So glad that you fell in love with me

[Pre-Chorus: Ashanti]
My love is so good
That I wouldn't be without you, babe
Couldn't see me without you, babe
My love is so good
That I wouldn't be without you, babe
Couldn't see me without you, baby

[Chorus: Ashanti]
All my life
I've been searching for you
Everyday
So glad that I found you, boy
All my life
I've been feeling for you
Everyday
I'm so happy, baby

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
Boy, you got me feeling so good
You take all my pain away from me
Without you around, I couldn't be
And I know you fell in love with me

[Pre-Chorus: Ashanti]
My love is so good
That I wouldn't be without you, babe
Couldn't see me without you, babe
My love is so good
That I wouldn't be without you, babe
Couldn't see me without you, baby

[Chorus: Ashanti]
All my life
I've been searching for you
Everyday
So glad that I found you, boy
All my life
I've been feeling for you
Everyday
I'm so happy, baby

[Bridge: Ashanti]
I'm so happy that I fell in love
I thank God he sent you from up above
I'm so happy that I found someone
And I thank God he sent you from above

[Chorus (2x): Ashanti]
All my life
I've been searching for you
Everyday
So glad that I found you, boy
All my life
I've been feeling for you
Everyday
I'm so happy, baby

[Outro: Ashanti]
That I wouldn't be without you babe
Couldn't see me without you, babe
And I wouldn't be without you, babe
Couldn't see me without you, baby
