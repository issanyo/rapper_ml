(Intro)
3000 what's happenin my nigga ha-ha
Ok Inc Empire ha some niggas know about that shit huh
I'm startin to see the paint crack
I'm startin to see the paint crack
You niggas is fuckin cowards
The murder Inc
We fuck with these ho's man you know ha-ha

(Verse 1)
Bitch I shine like diamonds from Sierra Leone
Excuse me not diamonds but diamondes
<!---->And Kanye had me thinking of wearing diamonds at all
<!----><!---->Till I thought again that a ho's best friend
And when I get the sippin on hypnotic and hen
I can get the touchin on your closes friends
Plus we do that other touchin leave no witnesses
Touchy touch
I guess that's how us gangsters is
And I'm bout to tell your bitch how a ho should live
Get a nigga hold him down even thru his bid
Coz I put this on my momma and my 3 born kids
I'm a get this chicken and flip it as long as I live
And if there's beef on the menu I'll cook it at 50 degrees (?)
Shoud I continue?
You hot I'll put you on freeze
You know who I'm talkin to mister 5-0
You know where they go when them niggas need info
Over and out 10-4 I'll buck at you later
The streets know but I don't want them to call me a hater
Coz I've got gwop just like you but I don't get shot like you do
You bitch nigga
Back to the pick of the litter here kitty kitty I get so much pussy
I should run the city so come on and fuck with me
Get drunk get high
It's loki introducing the Inc empire lets go

(Chorus)
These niggas don't really want it oh
In the club bitches all up on us like
(You so hot 4x)
But these bitches don't really want me no
They just want to be around a nigga coz

(You so hot 4x)

(Verse 2)
Niggas I know you all fuckin with the eh eh the what
Inc empire. Get down and get tied up and part of my delayer
Nigga been tied up fuckin on America top modal's
Like Tyra but don't get it fucked up a nigga still roll up
Mossburg pumped up and show a nigga tough love
Maybe that bitch mya ya got the best of but now me niggas
My best move will be my next one
Just cock me a gun nick name futon
Coz it's about to hurt any nigga that sleep on it
Can't sleep on this plush hand made by foreigners
For 350 whole season no harness
No conflict with diamonds man they all flawless
Bitch speak when spoken to when round ballers
Bottom birds for the winter down south in neworlands
Then head up top for some peach pickin in Georgia
Name your price lil mamma I can fuckin afford ya
Send you home a new bitch all the ho's will applaud ya
Ignore ya before ya take a hit of that dose
I want ya to bring that ass a tad bit closer?
I'm pose to get to know you better
You know a nigga don't know no better
I wear suede in the rain and if that don't get her
Drop the roof On the range let the rain drops hit us
Bitch stayin in your lane
You don't know

(Chorus)
These niggas don't really want it oh
In the club bitches all up on us like
(You so hot 4x)
But these bitches don't really want me no
They just want to be around a nigga coz
(You so hot 4x)
