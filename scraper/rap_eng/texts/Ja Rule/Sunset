[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Now niggas know I'm from New York
But shit I love Cali-forn-i-a
From back when NWA
Rocked the black and grey Raiders shit
On some gangsta shit
Niggas wasn't thinkin' 'bout hoes and how
(?)
I done two-toned the blues just to ride up the strip
For the look on sunset sun-up on sunset
Niggas be on some pimp shit
But you already know this, if you ever know this
By the looks of me baby I'm holding
And I ain't telling if you ain't knowing, I'm a don
Meet me at the (?)
I'll be sitting out front in the back, watching the stars born
And you ain't getting gone, at least no time soon
Cause we heading over to the Viper Room
To get high on whatever your heart desires
But you can start giving head while we ride sunset, c'mon

[Chorus: Stefani]
Can we take a ride up and down the sunset?
(?) watch my body get so wet
Tonight's gon' be the night
Baby boy you won't forget
I'll make you feel so good while we riding
So good while we ride
Can we take a ride up and down the sunset?
(?) watch my body get so wet
Tonight's gon' be the night
Baby boy you won't forget
I'll make you feel so good while we riding
So good while we ride

[Verse 2: The Game]
You already know California's the Mecca of hydraulics
The switches on low riders
The Daytons on gold wires
West siders throw it up, my niggas its all love
I'm calling out every Crip and Blood in LA
Essa's hit the strip on dubs
Let's hit the club, my bitches start stripping for dubs
Mami wassup, Lambo doors up
When they see me they show me love
Honk the horn, pull over and roll up
The chronic and blow dubs
Better hope it ain't no gun-play
Cause sunset Friday is Crenshaw Sundays
And I love LA like Snoop love the six-tre
Where would I be without Dre? To Live and Die in LA
All we know is low riders and sex
And what happens on sunset, stays on sunset
Got the whole strip throwing up dubs
And since Pac died, it ain't been no California Love

[Ja Rule]
California!

[Chorus: Stefani]
Can we take a ride up and down the sunset?
(?) watch my body get so wet
Tonight's gon' be the night
Baby boy you won't forget
I'll make you feel so good while we riding
So good while we ride
Can we take a ride up and down the sunset?
(?) watch my body get so wet
Tonight's gon' be the night
Baby boy you won't forget
I'll make you feel so good while we riding
So good while we ride

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
LA, ghost ride ya whips
For the bay, put ya stunna shades on
Sittin on chrome, candy painted impala 6-4
6-deuce continentals with suicide doors
Can't help but floss when you in floss-Angeles
Just learn ya dress code B's & C's
Cause its all about the G-code
Niggas fucking (?)
Riding down rodeo with twins that resemble J-Lo
Uh-oh, they wanna get to licking and pimping
The right places I promise
I be patient before I get to replacing a bitch
I mean in 2 with this shit
That means its 4 lips at one time around one dick
Can be doing it while we hitting the strip
In the back of the 6, Sunset, we riding high on it

[Chorus: Stefani]
Can we take a ride up and down the sunset?
(?) watch my body get so wet
Tonight's gon' be the night
Baby boy you won't forget
I'll make you feel so good while we riding
So good while we ride
Can we take a ride up and down the sunset?
(?) watch my body get so wet
Tonight's gon' be the night
Baby boy you won't forget
I'll make you feel so good while we riding
So good while we ride

[Outro: Stefani]
I'll make ya feel good while we riding baby
So good while we riding baby
So good while we riding baby
And your love just drives me crazy
