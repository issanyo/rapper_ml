It's the rules of engagement nigga
What ya'll know about that shit?

Niggas I been in this game for years
Makin' me the animal that I is
Theres rules to this shit
Remember these crack commandments
That is what I call The Rules of Engagement
You should master this
Take notes you bastards;

RULE 1;
Never outshine the master
If you oppose a threat he gon' kill you faster

RULE 2;
Conceal your intentions always
Nowadays niggas either snitchin and catch phrase

RULE 3;
Always say less than necessary
Them niggas that talk too much often get buried

RULE 4;
I know you heard this before
Push your enemy totally, Hail Mary's and rosaries

RULE 5;
Pose as a friend, work as a spy
Take 'em to get high, Then put it between his eyes

RULE 6;
Stir up water to catch fish
This here is my favourite, ain't no need in explainin' it

RULE 7;
Keep others suspended in terror
Be unpredictable, in other words gain the advantage

RULE 8;
Play a sucka to catch a sucka
Seem dubmer than your mark muther-fucker so you can touch him

RULE 9;
Know who you dealin' with
Don't offend no wrong niggas, get your family killed

And RULE 10 shoulda been number 1 to me
Play all the way to the end without gettin' your hands dirty

It's the rules... of Engagement niggas
