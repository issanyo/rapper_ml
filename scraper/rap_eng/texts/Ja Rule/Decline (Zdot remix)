[Intro: RAYE]
Hold up, wait, wait, wait
Hold up, wait, hear me now
Hold up, wait, wait, wait
Hold up, wait, hear me now

Hold up, wait, wait, wait
Hold up, wait, hear me now
Hold up, wait, wait, wait
Hold up, wait, hear me now

[Verse 1: Raye]
All you think that you said when you running it
Now you're bellin' up my line like an ambulance
Say "fam-fam-a-lam" no, I'm done with it
No a 999, no emergency
Baby, nah, nah, no, I ain't into you
I'm a block you soon, you're bug-a-boo baby
Back a man, come unavailable
And I know I'm gonna find myself a better you

[Pre-Chorus: Raye]
(Please just)
Hold up, wait
Hold up, hear me now (Please just)
Hold up, wait
Hold up

[Chorus: Raye]
Baby, I was always there for you, oh
I was always on time
And I gave you my all
So now you call, I decline
And now I don't know about you
But I know I'm gonna be fine
And I gave you my all
So now you call, I decline

[Post-Chorus: Raye]
Hold up, wait
Hold up, hear me now
Hold up, wait
Hold up, hear me now
Hold up, wait
Hold up, hear me now
Hold up, wait
Hold up

[Verse 2: Raye]
I'll be, I'll be, need a minute
You can "Shhh" when I talk, let me finish
Why you go? Get gon', I'ma get it
You can move over there, aaah
Going all out, 'cause you need the freak
She was done, saying "I don't need you, B"
You had a good girl, yeah

[Chorus: Raye]
Baby, I was always there for you, oh
I was  always on time
And I gave you my all
So now you call, I decline
And now I don't know about you
But I know I'm gonna be fine
And I gave you my all
So now you call, I decline

[Post-Chorus: Raye & Jaykae]
Ah, baby, you don't get to play me
Nah, baby, oh, when you call, I decline
Nah, baby, you don't get to play me (hold up, give me now)
Nah, baby, oh, when you call, I decline
(hold up, wait, she's a white version)

[Verse 2: Jaykae]
She can decline my call, but not my card
I gave her my all, but not my hearth
Short memory, you're not so smart
'cause you played me, so I got no scars
So please don't talk like I'm a bug-a-boo
'cause I'll drop you like I dropped those bars
Gettin' all gassed, 'cause you got a new ling
Well I am not having it, yeah, ain't got no chance

Hold up, wait, hold up now
Ain't pickin' up when I phone up now
Real talk, I don't think you're ready for the truth
But if you're so sure, I'll own up now
Right, didn't think so, bit of info
Still got your pictures in my window
I was there now, but I wasn't involved
Got a call, boy, wasn't him no
Just answer the phone, man

[Pre-Chorus: Raye]
Now you call, yeah, I decline
Now you call, ca, ca, ca, I decline
Now you call, yeah, I decline
Now you call, ca, ca, ca, I decline

[Chorus: Raye]
Baby, I was always there for you, oh
I was  always on time
And I gave you my all
So now you call, I decline
And now I, I don't know about you
But I know I'm gonna be fine
And I gave you my all
So now you call, I decline

[Post-Chorus: Raye]
Nah, baby, you don't get to play me
Nah, baby, oh, when you call, I decline
Nah, baby, you don't get to play me
Nah, baby, oh, when you call, I decline

[Outro: RAYE]
Oh, baby, you don't get to play me
Nah, baby, oh, when you call, I decline
Nah, baby, you don't get to play me
Nah, baby, oh, when you call, I decline
Hold up, wait
Hold up, hear me now
Hold up, wait
Hold up, hear me now
Hold up, wait
Hold up, hear me now
Hold up, wait
Hold up, hear me now
