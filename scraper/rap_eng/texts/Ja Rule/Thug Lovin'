[Intro: Ja Rule (Bobby Brown)]
What up, Gotti, yeah
This is how it's goin down, nigga, Rule, baby
(All we need is a a stage, God)
Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, come on, ha-ha-ha)
It's on and popping, baby
The Last Temptation, ha-ha
He's back (WOOOOO!!!)
Y'all know who I'm talking about
To the world over, B. Brown
Come on, come on

[Chorus: Bobby Brown]
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored, baby

[Verse 1: Ja Rule, Bobby Brown & Both]
I know you're living your life faithfully, safely, away from me
But you miss being next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you want
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
Or intervene
Of me peeling your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
Shoes 19, coming through in that new Bentley thing (GIRL!!)
The talk of the town, the tease of the city (yeah)
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy or Bob and Whitney (WHO?)
I'm here 'cause the Lord sent me (WHO?), pound puss like a pugilist
Grin real devilish and freak bad bitches (oh-ohh)
Forget the story, I know you're getting bored
And that nigga ain't getting you horny no more, is he?
'Cause when it's all said and done, it's me
Loving, thugging you, baby...

[Chorus: Bobby Brown]
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving (woo!)
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored, baby

[Verse 2: Ja Rule, Bobby Brown & Both]
Sweet thing, living it
Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent (ha)
Maybe I'm too generous
Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even (girl, I know)
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God?
Betrayal, trust, this thing of ours  (GIRL!!)
Should be secretly held sacred, 'cause I love it when you pop your body-body
And move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi and rub up alongside me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is you need my heat (Ja!)
'Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Loving, thugging you, baby...

[Chorus: Bobby Brown (Ja Rule)]
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving (thug shit)
And I know you're getting bored (know you're getting bored)
Dealing with him (dealing with him)
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored, baby

[Verse 3: Ja Rule, Bobby Brown & Both]
Rule, baby
Baby girl, here I'm holding your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless (WOOOO!!!)
'Cause you been getting at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck from strays
'Cause I been in a rage (GIRL!!) lately (yeah)
Hoping God'll forgive me for all the sin, all the women
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginning (WOOOO!!!)
I hope you (watch) so you could see that nigga ain't built like me (like me)
Black Sheep of the family
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love looking something like soft porn
Now tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him?
Where the brightest of days just look dim
And you fucking with a loser, baby, you can't win (HA, HA)
When it's said and done you're gonna need me
Loving, thugging you, baby...

[Chorus: Bobby Brown (Ja Rule)]
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging (Rule, B. Brown)
Thug loving (ha)
And I know you're getting bored (know you're getting bored)
Dealing with him (dealing with him)
I know you miss my loving, my thugging (WOOO!!!)
Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored, baby

[Outro: Ja Rule (Bobby Brown)]
Yeah, yeah
I.G., Ja Rule (I know you miss my loving)

Dealing with him)
