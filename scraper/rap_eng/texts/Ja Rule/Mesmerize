[Intro: Ja Rule]
Haha, yeah
Whattup ma? How you been?
Yeah I know, I know, hehe
It's all good.. (Murder Inc.)

[Chorus: Ja Rule + (Ashanti)]
Girl, your stare, those eyes I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you thug me, baby)
And I can't deny I (love it when I'm witchu, baby)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I got a fetish for fuckin' you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
'Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
'Cause every woman just wanna be happy
And it's CRA-ZAY, but BAY-BAY, I... (love it when I'm witchu, baby)

[Chorus: Ja Rule + (Ashanti)]
Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you thug me, baby)
And I can't deny I (love it when I'm witchu, baby)

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
I wanna get away, 'cause you know like I know
And there's a better day, a-comin, I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin
Like when we kissin' - bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll - ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me, baby

[Chorus: Ja Rule + (Ashanti)]
Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you thug me, baby)
And I can't deny I (love it when I'm witchu, baby)

[Verse 3: Ja Rule + (Ashanti)]
Shorty, are you really gettin' bored with me, or him?
'Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin' my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
(Baby, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

[Verse 4: Ashanti + (Ja Rule)]
Ooohhh... ooohh...
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin' different, boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down ass, witcha round ass)
I know I'm feelin you (like you feelin' me)
The way you're holdin my body, the way you touch me

[Chorus: Ja Rule + (Ashanti)]
Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you thug me, baby)
And I can't deny I (love it when I'm witchu, baby)

[Bridge: Ashanti]
I love when you touch me, baby
All over my body, baby
I love when you kiss me, baby
All over my body, baby
I love when you touch me, baby
All over my body, baby
I love when you kiss me, baby
All over my body, baby

[Chorus: Ja Rule + (Ashanti)]
Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you thug me, baby)
And I can't deny I (love it when I'm witchu, baby)
