[Verse 1: Ja Rule & (01)]
Yeah, it's our world, please believe
Niggas ain't real, please believe

I-N-C, niggas what's fuckin with me?
R-U-L-E.. love me or hate me, baby
Refer to 3:36, baby
That's the rule, please niggas don't get it confused
See this game that we playin', y'all playin' to lose
Who's next that wanna ride (who?)
Spittin' (who?) how I do niggas (who?)
Knowin' they wanna ride (who?)
Rule baby, I've been really outta control lately
If you relatin' let me hear ya say, yay-yay, yay-yay
Y'all feelin' my pain? I've been runnin' wild time and again
Y'all swerve in my lane, I'll pull up and start poppin' ya brain
Fuck knowin' these broads names, extravagant champagnes
Y'all niggas is lame, my niggas ain't sane
Who you fuckin' with?

[Chorus: Ja Rule, Vita & (01)]
Y'all niggas wanna dead (who?) then wanna ride (who?)
Y'all know them niggas who steady screamin' (Fuck you!)

We scream it, we yell it, we livin' murda murda murda
Y'all ain't feelin' (who?) y'all don't like (who?)

We live it, we breathe it, we screamin' murda murda murda

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Murder INC. is my blood
We go through the pain together, by any means
Poppin' it hot at whoever, or so it seems
Niggas that getting hot, not this hot nigga very hot
See it in your eyes, niggas ready to die
But as long as I'm alive, I'm puttin' this on my life
For niggas that ain't right, they get it upon sight
If ya know me, then you'll no way, pop away
Cock and pop again, baby, men will be men
I spit off 10, fuck it give 'em the 16
Like my guns dirty and hands clean
Loose bitches in tight jeans
Old money and crack fiends, was a fetish
Before Guliani got into office and deaded shit
Fuck it, I'm livin' my life on the edge
Got one in the head, plus a niggas Fed, 'nuff said
I'm gonna behead niggas that don't believe this
Rule baby, 3:36

[Chorus: Ja Rule, Vita & (01)]
Y'all niggas wanna dead (who?) then wanna ride (who?)
Y'all know them niggas who steady screamin' (Fuck you!)
It's murda murda.. you know it's murda murda
We scream it, we yell it, we livin' murda murda murda
Y'all ain't feelin' (who?) y'all don't like (who?)
Y'all know them niggas who steady screamin' (Fuck you!)
It's murda murda murda, you know it's murda murda
We live it, we breathe it, we screamin' murda murda murda

[Verse 3: 01 & (Ja Rule)]
We are the world's most dangerous niggas alive
All of my niggas bang with us and let's ride
Motherfuckers want war but not many survive
'Cause 50 shots tearin' through the side of ya ride
'Cause we are (murderers)
Muthafucka you heard, playa (murderers)
Poppin' collars in air
Poppin' shots through ya rearview
Bullets, they tear through
Got niggas wonderin' like,"What the fuck did I do?"
So niggas wanna go and get they man 'cause they can't do this shit
Because they got no heart for this, bust a gun and body shit
Niggas like you probably snitch, do a nigga then get rich
Niggas like you always fit, 6 feet deep inside a ditch
There ain't nothin' fuckin' with this, ya know why?
Nigga I just came into the game, "Ready to Die"
Ready to hold heat, drive-by with Rule
Poppin shots through the sunroof screamin', "Fuck You!"

[Chorus: Ja Rule, Vita & (01)]
Y'all niggas wanna dead (who?) then wanna ride (who?)
Y'all know them niggas who steady screamin' (Fuck you!)
It's murda murda.. you know it's murda murda
We scream it, we yell it, we livin' murda murda murda
Y'all ain't feelin' (who?) y'all don't like (who?)
Y'all know them niggas who steady screamin' (Fuck you!)
It's murda murda murda, you know it's murda murda
We live it, we breathe it, we screamin' murda murda murda
Y'all niggas wanna dead (who?) then wanna ride (who?)
Y'all know them niggas who steady screamin' (Fuck you!)
It's murda murda.. you know it's murda murda
We scream it, we yell it, we livin' murda murda murda
Y'all ain't feelin' (who?) y'all don't like (who?)
Y'all know them niggas who steady screamin' (Fuck you!)
