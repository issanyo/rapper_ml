[Chorus]
What they say(say, say, say)
What they say I don't hear
It don't make who I am
I don't care what they say
(say, say)
What they say about me
('bout me, I hear)
But don't care what they say
Well they say I'm arrogant
And they say I'm awfully rich
They say I'm too conceded
Well I say I got a reason
(and they say)
I call'em ho's
(they say)
I lost control
Well I say thank you for caring
(they say, they say)

[Verse 1]
We been pimpin', since pimpin'
Been pim-pim-pim-pim-pimpin'
Loud little nigga probably die like John Lennon
Only true religion he know is bitches ass in him
What he got his momma tried to get him the fuck up out of him
He ain't shit and ain't goin' be shit out of him
Probably end up on drugs just like his father
What his say is hearsay and money is problems
So why should I give a fuck 'bout him

[Chorus]
What they say(say, say, say)
What they say I don't hear
It don't make who I am
I don't care what they say
(say, say)
What they say about me
('bout me, I hear)
But don't care what they say
Well they say I'm overdoing
And they say I act brand new
And they say it's not 'bout money
Well I say it's about money
(and they say)
I'm getting ho's
(they say)
I lost my mo
Well I say hey little lovely
(they say, they say)

[Verse 2]
Look at him riding around town
In his new drop Phantom
Troubled every bitch and these bitches know that he married
Bitch ass fake thug sing like Mariah Carey ass nigga
Screaming Murder knowing he ain't a killa
Look at his watch look at his chain
I can't ------ this nigga's doing his thang
I ain't on his dick or nothing I'm just saying
Talk is cheap man and money is power
So I shouldn't give a fuck 'bout him

[Chorus]
What they say(say, say, say)
What they say I don't hear
It don't make who I am
I don't care what they say
(say, say)
What they say about me
('bout me, I hear)
But don't care what they say

[Verse 3]
A nigga goin live how he live
Fuck it baby it is what it is
And I is the truth getting money like -------
Say what say why say who
(I say)
I say it ain't so but it's so how true
Is it that nigga is sounding a bit like who
R U the answer like AI
A question the----like----
The name took it off Ja'
I been ridiculed and criticized
And in the same breath been praised and idolized
And if you ever get a chance to take a look in my eyes
Tell me if I give a fuck 'bout it

[Chorus]
What they say(say, say, say)
What they say I don't hear
It don't make who I am
I don't care what they say
(say, say)
What they say about me
('bout me, I hear)
But don't care what they say
What they say 'bout me ooh, ooooh
I don't really care
Now you can talk about me
As much as you please
But I don't give a D.A.M
