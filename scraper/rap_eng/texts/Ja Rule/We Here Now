[Intro: Ja Rule]
Yeah
Here we go, feel this shit
Into the new world, the new day
Ja Rule, Irv Gotti, nigga
Its Murda

[Chorus: Black Child]
Yeah, we here now, don't get scared now
Ja Rule nigga 'bout to tear shit down
What y'all thought y'all was gon' eat forever
And my dog wouldn't blaze heat for cheddar?
We better eat together or meet at the crossroads
'Cause the Lord knows it's Murda, hold those
When yo' casket close and yo' souls rise high
Remember the DEAD don't die 'less they FUCK WITH I!!!

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Niggas know who dope, yo
Shit, the flow is wretched
And my G too futuristic for you hoes to catch it
I'm a God send, the fallen angel when I do sin
Far from perfection but still considered a gem
Thank you lord for givin' me wind beneath my wings
When the miracle spittin' there shall be no witnesses to the pain
And my ignorance, I charge to the game
So many love done slain by bullets with dead aim
I weathered the change
Stormed through the streets in the range
Can't complain, a nigga live to die in the flames
'Cause I torture, J the A  R-U-L-E
Niggas can't be seriously fuckin' with me
What you hollerin' 'bout?
We can hit up an alley and air out
Bullets exit the barrel, and enter your mouth
That's how I'm built
Under the floss there's nuttin' but filth
Don't let it fool ya
I still let them slugs heat up and cool ya
All forever more, so help me Lord
Gon' find a, way to my grave just because I'm a Mur-der-er
Whole, not part, cut me open
I bleed for the Inc. from the heart
When I start it's usually endless
Pop one with gloves on
Make you check fo forensic, son
In yo' appendix, son, you got hit up, huh?
Fuckin' with Ja, you know it's MURDAAA

[Chorus: Black Child]
Yeah, we here now, don't get scared now
Ja Rule nigga 'bout to tear shit down
What y'all thought y'all was gon' eat forever
And my dog wouldn't blaze heat for cheddar?
We better eat together or meet at the crossroads
'Cause the Lord knows it's Murda, hold those
When yo' casket close and yo' souls rise high
Remember the DEAD don't die 'less they FUCK WITH I!!!

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Rule spits monotonous, hot as apocalypse
Now you eyin this, ferocious mic supremist
Whose limits is endless
This nigga here done risen
Murderous flows kill suspicion
Niggas is too light in the ass to be shittin'
Hollis Ave. historical, nigga respect tradition
'Cause all I see is bloodshed and niggas wanna see me dead
Inherit this style is sumthin' like a million square miles  (CHANGE IT UP)
Til I - find 'em and hit 'em and be done with 'em
Givin' is gettin' and niggas get got for bullshittin'
I'ma, run up on niggas, gunnin' 'em down
And you confess that I'm the best, so who's touchin' me now?
Shipped three hundred thou' with a freestyle, fuckin' you up
And got you hoes in the back rows tossin' it up
I got the touch 'cause my flow is bananas
Bitches can't stand us, we ghetto fabulous
Aim, when I bust and blast on surprise
If y'all niggas don't know you need to see me live
I'm like two .45's spittin' in every direction
Y'all niggas is hoes in stilettos and thongs (nigga)
It's a break of a new day
May-be you'll get to see violently (yeah)
What drives me (yeah) take 'em back to the gutter (yeah)
Smother the world in filth (uh-huh)
Rule's the name and now you gon' see how I'm built, nigga

[Chorus: Black Child]
Yeah, we here now, don't get scared now
Ja Rule nigga 'bout to tear shit down
What y'all thought y'all was gon' eat forever
And my dog wouldn't blaze heat for cheddar?
We better eat together or meet at the crossroads
'Cause the Lord knows it's Murda, hold those
When yo' casket close and yo' souls rise high
Remember the DEAD don't die 'less they FUCK WITH I!!!
