[Intro]
Yo, we gonna try something a little different
Yo, make.. make my voice a little more distorted
Yeah, I don't know if they ready for this
Uh dance, uh uh dance, uh uh dance, uh uh dance
Uh uh, verse

Last night we had an argument
Afterwards I'm feelin' pretty bent
Then I took a drink, and I didn't think
What was in store for me

1 -	You don't know, you don't know how she'll take it
	Tell me what a simple man could do
	Will she cherish your heart, will she break it
	Cuz you are everything and everything is you, sing

2 -	You are everything and everything is you
	You are everything and everything is you
	You are everything and everything is you
	You are everything and everything is you

Listen
Baby don't want you playin' me
When you're lovin' me, and holdin' me
Ooh we're fuckin' then you play me
You play me, you play me
You everything to me
I'm wondering if you will see
That I will love you always

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Break it down

[Ja Rule]
Yeah huh, Ja Rule and Dru Hill, nigga
Baby girl, you tellin' lies
Cuz when I look at you in your face
I could see I'm on your mind
And it don't matter what them hoes may say
I know your love is blind for me
Every bitch needs a thug nigga in their life
Truly, could it be, could it be
You enjoy me fuckin' you while you be lovin' me
Bitch destroy's hoes mentally
That's why they freak with me, frequently
Love is life

[Nokio]
No nigga, life is love
Take the baddest bitch, ice her up
After the tour, tell her to keep in touch

[Ja Rule]
Nigga, that's what's up

[Nokio]
Being Nokio's a bit much
Got bitches overseas that love to fuck
Got bitches in the states that love to suck
What the fuck y'all want from me
Ghetto celebrity from B'more

[Ja Rule]
Murderer, Do Or Die from the N-Y

[Nokio and Ja Rule]
Now everybody get right

[Nokio]
N-O-K-I-O baby

[Ja Rule]
R to the U to L-E, baby
And yo, alotta y'all bitches hate me
Cuz you can't relate to me
What the fuck you want from me?

[Nokio]
Let them hoes know not a thing
Ice the wrist, neck, ear, and rings cuz you know

You are everything

Repeat 2 until fade
