Throw your motherfuckin fingers in the air
Motherfucker, the war is on, we're gonna pour it on

Hit a clubs rush the door, niggas fuck the *known

[Black Child]
I earned connections, everytime I burn my weapon

Fuck the feds, nigga we spit hollow heads
Our motto is shed blood for dead thug
That shed blood in hell, when my slugs set bail
Pray for death from your cell, I won't bet we got to jail
From pretty niggas, with half a nickel flow
Them bitch niggas, they keep their dimes on the low
Ya'll niggas is lame, commercial niggas get out the game

Then ask what the fuck you goin' do, test the mic on your gun

We don't give a what, what
All of my ladies, it's all gravy
Get your tubs up

Plus, ain't nobody hotter than Totti
So who you riding with
Ladies hating blatently hating cause they ain't hiding
Dismiss hot chick, straight to the top chick
That'll chase you, that'll strip you off your crown and replace you
When I stay laced boo, in the top of the line
In the finest designers, from Fendi and Gabbana
Players if you want it, I got it, just come and get it
Thugs if you hustling hustling, come and get it

We don't give a fuck! What!
