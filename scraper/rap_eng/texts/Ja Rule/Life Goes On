[Intro]
Yea
This one goes out
To all my niggas across the world
Going through that struggle
Feeling that pain
We with you my niggas
But no matter what God has planned for us
Know this
Life goes on

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
They say "Kill or be killed's the only way to live these days"
So how come only my hood niggas live this way
We put together the puzzle, but still stuck in a maze
I put it all in perspective cause I'm coming of age
28 and I see more niggas go to the grave
More mommas in pain
More murals with names (Ey)
Sometimes you look to the Lord to blame
And pray every day wishing that things could change
Cause I'm just wishing you was here, my niggas
Wish that you could be with me to ball, my niggas
Send a sign I'm on call, niggas
Promise to pick me up if I fall, my niggas
The way I wish y'all was still alive (I know)
Through memories y'all still alive (And I know)
Through my eyes in my mind, you'll live forever

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh) (Pour us some liquor for)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea) (Whoa, I wish for)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea) (For all my niggas, yeah)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh) (Pour us some liquor for)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea) (I wish for, I wish for)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea) (For all my niggas, yeah)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
I pour it out for my niggas that's dead and gone
As for my niggas in prison, I throw it up cause I'm riding for 'em
Big Black and Lil Will, them there my niggas still
Mu Tah and Lil Itchy, you know a nigga miss you
Tron and Lil Al, Bam, Skeet and Younger Al
Tron and Lil Trap, I wish y'all was still here
And I ain't a heard a word for more than 10 years
I feel that if I'd been there, he'd still be here
But I'ma hold it down and ain't gon' cry about it
'Cause I'ma holla at ya, I'll see you in the next life
And I'll still be that same nigga
Still doin' thug thizzle
Wearing the same ol' Dickies
Then we can still drink the same Henny
Cause back then that's how we did it
So how could I forget it?
My three daughters and goals out the doors
I lost in the struggle
My homie and my oldest brother

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh) (Pour us some liquor for)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea) (Whoa, I wish for)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea) (For all my niggas, yeah)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh) (Pour us some liquor for)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea) (I wish for, I wish for)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea) (For all my niggas, yeah)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)

[Verse 3: Chink Santana]
What part of the game is this? My nigga
Wish you was with me in my 6, my nigga
While you was flipping them bricks, I figure
I been flooding the streets wit hits, my nigga
You told me give it my heart
I gave it my love
I gave it my life
But you was my blood
You bringing me pain dawg
But I'm on the grind
I'm trying to stay focused
I'm losing my mind
I'm missing you dearly
I wish you was here dawg
Fucking these hoes with me
But instead, I'm in tears
But when you passed it rained
And God's tears took away the fucking pain
So look man (Ey)
I can't cry no more
You died once and you can't die no more (No more) (Shit)
So they can't stop me now
The only way is if they pop me now
I'ma hold it down

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh) (Pour us some liquor for)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea) (Whoa, I wish for)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea) (For all my niggas, yeah)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)
I pour out the liquor for (Ohh) (Pour us some liquor for)
I wish, I wish, I wish for (Yea) (I wish for, I wish for)
For all my niggas that's dead and gone (Ohh yea) (For all my niggas, yeah)
I'ma see you when I get there (Life goes on)
