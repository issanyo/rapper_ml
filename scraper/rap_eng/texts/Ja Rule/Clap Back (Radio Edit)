I'd like to welcome all my *** to the world famous Murda Inc. Show
They call me the Mighty Rule, how ya livin'?
This real *** we talkin', I wanna ask all my gangsta ***
A real question, what do you do when *** spit at you?
Clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
If they holl'in about Rule, ***, here's the real
I'll pop ya top like Champagne bottles that chill
Wear nothin' but ice, smiles tinted up to The Greatest
Tell 'em I'm nice too, plus push them nice grooves
The Inc roll like deuce, man, I'm ol' G Bobby J
An' we sling at soccer fields the yay
They don't respect that, don't get your minds around me
Get it pushed back, y'all don't want that
I send 'em to the morgue while keepin' my *** bouncin' fo' sho'
'In da club' with no gun, got 'em takin' it off
Can't help that, I'm the *** that puts it down
Once I hit that, that's if I'm up in the May
Fasten them holdin' the throwback, West 44 Lakers
Let's make no mistakes, resents take place
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back, ***, ample space
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
The Rule be 'In da club', rude *** poppin' the bubbly
*** get ugly, I hug the snub closely
But usually, we still see your ***
That's is known for quick ***, trying to ride my ***
I can't handle it, lower their manners
To get they *** in front of my *** to dance, the *** want more chance
Catchin' hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These *** is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit his thang
Give *** the back hand, pimp ***, it's not realistic
The game is helpless, not get it twisted
I'm young, wrapped an' gifted, but still at the bottom
An' stuck somewhere between Gomorrah an' Sodom
I'm here to make this rap *** hotter than Harlem
*** the dog, beware of Rule 'cause I'm the problem
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back, ***, ample space
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
Like Bush an' Saddam, I'm a find out
Where 'em Laden's hidin' an' bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than yo scrubs
Mask an' glove, gun hot from burnin' *** up
I'd rather be bossed up, wit a bunch of broads
The preacher's daughter screamin' out, "*** the law"
I play a struck chord, wit the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest *** out of all the religions
An' God gave me his blessings to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the Nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
An' 'Clap that boy' like Birdman an' Clipse
I got these *** all over my ***, like ***
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back ***, ample space
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
(Let's take 'em to war)
Yeah, my *** 'Zino in this mother***
Break 'em down ***, break 'em down
Queens in this mother***, all my Jersey ***
All my Boston ***, all my Brooklyn ***, Brooklyn, Sir what up?
Yeah, holla at me, man
