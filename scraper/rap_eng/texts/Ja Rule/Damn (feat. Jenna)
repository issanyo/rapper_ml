Darkchild, 9-9
(They ain't ready for this)
Ja Rule
Uh, Darkchild

Yeah, yeah, yeah, damn
I couldn't think about the next man bangin' you
Hittin' it, empowerin' you the I used to
You make me holla, your cat top dollar
Purr when wet, worth puttin' diamonds on your collar

We down, hittin' switches like a 6-4
Follow me and you against the world, baby girl
(Oh, oh, oh)
But you broken, now she got your side of the bed
Your 6 with wide-screen TVs, in the head

You like the livin? dead ?cuz you won't be back
The cat you thought was on throwin' you off-track
(Oh, oh, oh)
Can't do that, love's like a tug-a-war match
You can't win, you fall in, get too attached

You wanna be where I'm at, feelin' me without climax
Nails diggin' in my back, head board outta wack
What you love about Ja is what caught your eye
Painful lies and sweet goodbyes, baby, why?

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

I fell in love with you, see, like they do in movies
You were the generous type, you brought me things I didn't need
Promised to take care of me but then I pushed you to leave, yeah, yeah
Money don't make the man, I understand, since I let you go
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

But I could've had damn near everything, yeah, yeah
You see I should've changed my plans
Let you be my man just for your doe
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And never ever have to explain

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

It's wrong for me to think this but I could have handled it
Me playin' you for a fool, frontin', so romantic
Just to get my wishes granted, I should've did what I had to do, oh
Now when I think it through, I could've been to you a real good girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

It didn't mean that this is your world, yeah, yeah, yeah
To satisfy all my needs I could've pleased you a little bit more
(Oh oh oh oh)
Should've been, could've been, would've been
But these thoughts I just ignored, oh

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

You don't even wanna talk to me, you don't wanna be with me anymore
You don't even wanna call at all, but you come around tryin' to hit me off
You don't wanna go out with me, I can't stand to see you outta line
But it's really killin? me, you're not feelin? me, I wish you were mine but

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside
