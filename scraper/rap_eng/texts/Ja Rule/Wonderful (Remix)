[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies
Stars and jewels and all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me?
Want you
Would you still be calling me?
Still calling you
You'll be loving me?
I'll be loving you

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimping ain't easy, trust me, I know when gangstas and hoes
Go, go, go, go, go, go, together
Like chinchilla and bad weather, I'm good, but been better
All my bros get cheddar and glamorous things
Copped a few cars, a crib with east and west wing
'Cause this is how I'm living and y'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it, how to prey on my weakness
The power of P-U-S-S-Y
Got a lot of niggas wondering, it ain't just I
Gotta keep your cash coming and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
She probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip Seraphim, who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-N-C

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies
Stars and jewels and all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me?
Want you
Would you still be calling me?
Still calling you
You'll be loving me?
I'll be loving you

[Verse 2: Ja Rule & R. Kelly]
I want to know why love is about money
And why you wanna take it all from me
Honey, my life is dark, but it's lovely
Crimes, cars, cribs, ain't that right, Kelly?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Y'all bitches don't know money ain't a thang
Mami need a little change
Girl, I'm pitching quarters
Closest to the arches, but live in a fortress
New Benzes, new Porsches, new cases, new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious Rule
Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
It's no wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
It's kind of funny how you right back there

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies
Stars and jewels and all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me?
Want you
Would you still be calling me?
Still calling you
You'll be loving me?
I'll be loving you

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh
Ashanti...

[Verse 3: Ashanti]
Now, how many nights does it take to make you believe my love?
Through all these years, done had your kids
How could you wonder?
See, I was with you through the rain and the thunder
And all the crying and the pain, who'd you run to?
Now tell me, baby, do you still wonder?
'Cause I'm that chick from I-.N-C
Some try to front, but them chicks ain't me
Straight to the top, you all gonna see
All my ladies say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"
It's no wonder why we still here
And all this hating and we still here
You didn't think that we would be here
Ain't no mistaking, this is our year

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies
Stars and jewels and all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me?
Want you
Would you still be calling me?
Still calling you
You'll be loving me?
I'll be loving you

[Outro (repeats until fade): R. Kelly]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh
