[Chorus]
When you call, I come running, baby
Baby, when you call, I'll be right there, baby
Baby, when you call, I come running, baby
Baby when you call, I'll be right there

[Verse 1]
What's the deal with you and me?
I know you feel the chemistry
I can tell what's on your mind
The same thing that's on mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it coming on
The way I feel it, baby, it just can't be wrong
I want you needing me
And I'll come running, baby, that's the way it's gonna be

[Chorus]
When you call, I come running, baby
Baby, when you call, I'll be right there, baby
Baby, when you call, I come running, baby
Baby when you call, I'll be right there

[Verse 2]
Tell me, do you think of me?
With you is where I wanna be
'Cause boy, I got you on my brain
I know you feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it coming on
The way I feel it, baby, it just can't be wrong
I want you needing me
And I'll come running, baby, that's the way it's gonna be

[Chorus]
When you call, I come running, baby
Baby, when you call, I'll be right there, baby
Baby, when you call, I come running, baby
Baby when you call, I'll be right there

[Bridge]
Oh no, baby (come on)
I can't stop, baby (don't stop, don't stop)
Oh no, baby (come on)
I can't stop, baby, baby (don't stop, don't stop)
Oh no, baby (come on)
I can't stop, baby (don't stop, don't stop)
Oh no, baby (come on)
I can't stop, baby, baby (don't stop, don't stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it coming on
The way I feel it, baby, it just can't be wrong
I want you needing me
And I'll come running, baby, that's the way it's gonna be

[Chorus]
When you call, I come running, baby
Baby, when you call, I'll be right there, baby
Baby, when you call, I come running, baby
Baby when you call, I'll be right there

[Bridge]
Oh no, baby (come on)
I can't stop, baby (don't stop, don't stop)
Oh no, baby (come on)
I can't stop, baby, baby (don't stop, don't stop)
Oh no, baby (come on)
I can't stop, baby (don't stop, don't stop)
Oh no, baby (come on)
I can't stop, baby, baby (don't stop, don't stop)
