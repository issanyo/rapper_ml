Here we go again, baby
Where is the pain?
Had to break free from all this motherfuckin'...
Beside the strengths of my life
Open my eyes and see: it's a big world out there
God can only shine his light on me...

I'm crying, everyone's dead
My pain, my love
Im crying, everyone's dead
My pain, my love...
