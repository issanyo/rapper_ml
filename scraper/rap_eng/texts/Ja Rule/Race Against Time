[Chorus]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

[Verse 1]
God, why the hell am I here?
Is it a blessin', or a painful lesson of life and its directions?
Date of conception, two twenty-nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Look into these eyes and witness lives tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock, there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was cash money
So that I lust for
Be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven, that I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip, but you be there to pick me up
Down I'm on my knees like what's up
Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence
Got me to a better sense, cause what's yours is mines
Hear me, Lord, I'm runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

[Verse 2]
Nobody cry for me, cause I
Wanna see you smile for me when I die
Look through my windows to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world, which is so cold
Take me, save me, before I'm crazy
The only reason I live is for my baby
Never did you tell me that, life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this, shit might be changed
But now, I'm just racin' against time tryin' to survive
And see why, y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie
Get drunk and stay high
Don't de-nigga-ny
Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me, Lord, I'm runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life

[Verse 3]
I fears no man, but when its time to go, I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness, learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light, but all I see is the night
When everything else is bright
What happened to my life?
Is this what I am? Is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire
Within my soul I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny, maybe one day
I'll give this world the best of me
You know I never been one to judge right or wrong
I embraced and showed you love
Then I throw slugs at the other side
Go get 'em in broad daylight
What a nigga would give to live my life
You don't want it, cause if you could get it you would try
Feel me, Lord, Ja has arrived

[Chorus]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
