[Intro: Ja Rule]
Yeah, I like the way I came here
Rule
Shanti
Lin

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm helpless
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m
Helpless, baby
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
I ain't ever been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at the revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin’ at my sister as she dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart said [snap]
Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody’s dancin’ and the bass top volume
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
Saying to myself, "Baby, this one’s mine.”

[Pre-Chorus: Ashanti]
Shorty made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking “What’s she gonna do?”
She grabbed you by the arm, I’m thinkin’ “I’m through”
Then you look back at me and suddenly I’m

[Hook: Ashanti]
Helpless, yeah
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m
Helpless, baby
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Helpless, yeah
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m
Helpless, baby
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
One week later, I’m writin’ a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin’ at this girl, cuz she wants to form a harem
...No, I ain't sharin'
Two weeks later, in the living room stressin’
My father’s stone-faced while you’re asking for his blessin’
I’m dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I’m tryin’ not to cry
‘Cause there’s nothing that your mind can’t do

[Pre-Chorus: Ashanti]
My father makes his way across the room to you
I panic for a second, thinking “we’re through”
But then he shakes your hand and says “be true”
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I’m

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Helpless, yeah
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m
Helpless, baby
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em
Helpless, yeah
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m
Helpless, (so helpless) baby
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

[Break: Ja Rule + Ashanti]
Ashanti, I ain't got a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have’s my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We’ll get a little place in Queens and we’ll figure it out
I’ve been livin’ without my family since I was a child
My father died, my mama cried, I grew up buck wild
But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real
And long as I’m alive, Ashanti, swear to God
You’ll never feel so… (Baby I'm)

[Chorus: Ashanti & Ja Rule]
Helpless, yeah
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m
Helpless, baby
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

[Ashanti + Ja Rule]
Helpless, yeah (I'm so helpless)
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m
(Cause you know that I'm)
Helpless, baby
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

[Outro: Ashanti + Ja Rule]
Baby I'm
Yeah
Mm, so into you
So into you
Hahaha
