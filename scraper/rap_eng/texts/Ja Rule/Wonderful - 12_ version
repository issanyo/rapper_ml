If it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars
And jewels and all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me?
Would you still be calling me?
You be loving me?
Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin' ain't easy, trust me I know
When gangstas and hoes go go go go go go
Together like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedda and glamorous things
Copped a few cars, a crib with a east and west wing
'Cuz this is how I'm livin' and ya'll women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness?
It's the power of the P U S S Y
Got a lotta niggas wonderin', it ain't just I
Gotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
Shit, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphin', who doesn't like me?
And the murderous I N C
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars
And jewels and all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me?
Would you still be calling me?
You be loving me?
How many girls does it take to get to
Mack status, player status?
Pimps that get ya boy half rich, before we hit show biz
But show biz brought next level chicks
Pull up them in them hot cars, go and buy the whole bar nigga
I came from the dirt, what you want me to say
Im at the top of the world and lifes a pussy buffet
And that's why I get M I A
Shut the game down, so the bustas can't play
Hell yeah, I splurge money, hell yeah, I act funny
Look at you, like fuck you
All the shit I been through
It's a wonder, why I'm still here
Said I was gone, but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
It's mighty strange how you right back here
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars
And jewels and all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me?
Would you still be calling me?
You be loving me?
I wonder why love is about money
And why wou wanna take it all from me
Honey, my life is dark but it's lovely
Crimes, cars, cribs ain't that right Kelly?
Ya'll bitches don't know
Money ain't a thang, mami need a little change
Girl I'm pitchin' quarters
Closest to the arches, but live in a fortress
New Benzes, new Porsches, new cases, new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious Rule
Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone, but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its kinda funny how you right back there
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars
And jewels and all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me?
Would you still be calling me?
You be loving me?
