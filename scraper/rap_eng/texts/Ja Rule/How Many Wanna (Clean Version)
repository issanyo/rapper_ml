Yo, yo, uh

[1] - I'mma ride to the end of the road baby
This life will drive me crazy
Be gettin' right lately
Wondering when the lord gonna take me
Where all my gangsta's at? (Yeah)
Where all my ladies at? (Ahhh)

Never gon' see life without the Lord, they say
What's a thug to do but kneel down and pray
Lord, forgive me
They're lookin' down on it
Sometimes I feel I need out of it
Spin me 'round one time
Close my eyes, then CLICK
Once im dead maybe
Ill deserve all this
World, get OVER me
Playa hit that ja from what it sound like
Mad playas gettin' that rule don't even sound right
Like, now you caught in that whiplash, ? open eyed
You're all welcome, dont wanna live my life
May God help them
Am I resemplafy my sacrifice?
Women and ice got me lovin' hells paradice
You feelin

[Repeat 1]

My life is caught up in that madness
But I do deal with it
If the blood's your heart, live it
Baby, don't die wit it
Have to judge my soul (uh)
Trippin' outta control
Smashed up on the freeway
Gotta be the drugroll, give me leyway
Slidin' back and unload, murderers don't fold
Any action need to be shown?
There we go, wrapped and sold
Always rap in front of my foes
I keep playas on they toes
Women know to get that dough
Playas know freek them  ?
We that heat, can't be froze
We that burnin' that leaves you cold
We them guns that can't unload
We that platinum, not that gold
We them thugs, you just can't touch
We them thugs that just too much
Y'all don't wanna deal with us
We them thugs, murderers

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

[2] - How many wanna die wit me? [7x]
How many wanna die wit me, die wit me?

Can't ya see they all wanna out my life
If you had your way, I would be dead, on site
Wanna show yo face, so if my love is right
People hatin' on Ja, ain't even half that tight
Hey, you feelin me?
Make me wanna get too close, it ain't a joke

Ain't always be played with
