In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
God, why the Hell am I here?
Is it a blessin' or a painful lesson of life and it's directions?
Date of conception, two twenty-nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Lookin' into these eyes and witness lives' tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock, there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was 'Cash Money'
So that I lust for, be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven, and I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip but you be there
Pick me up, now I'm on my knees like, what's up?
'Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence?
Got me to a better sense 'cause whats yours is mine
Hear me Lord, I'm runnin' outta time
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Nobody cry for me, 'cause I
Wanna see you smile for me when I die
Look through my windows to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world which is so cold
Take me, save me, before I'm crazy
The only reason I live is for my baby
Never did you tell me that life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this, shit might changed
But now, I'm just racin' against time tryin' to survive
And see why y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie
Get drunk and stay high, don't de-nigga-ny
'Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me Lord, I'm runnin' outta time
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
I fear's no man, but when it's time to go, I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness, learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light but all I see is the night
When everything else is bright, what happened to my life?
Is this what I am, is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire within my soul
I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny, maybe one day
I'll give this world the best of me
You know I never been one to judge right or wrong
I embraced and showed you love, then I throw slug's
At the other side, go get 'em in broad day light
What a nigga would give to live my life?
You don't want it 'cause if you could get it you would try
Feel me Lord, Ja has arrived
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
