Do u like manolo put two in ya stomach

Sellin for me to keep the operation p**sed
We enourmous someone said the inc is murderous
You dont want us to strap up and blaze the strip
But if need be we bang out like bloodz in crips
Strap on the nozzles and extend the clips
Murda meets gangsta sh*t
And all my niggas that live it from hood to hood
Bang to this nigga

Hussein Fatal:

To get that green
Put a hole through a nigga shoulder as soon as the beam glow
Prolly raid u in the face
Give me a break imma rapper out here to stay
Dont make me do what i say
Jus let me say what i do
Cuz imma put it in a rhyme everytime i got to spray up your crew
I ain't lickin off shots to warn em
Jus a pop straight to the dome
On the real G-unit nigga Glock and all
Hoes believe im the one to get
Stupid in the booth with rule i told yall there was a gun in this b**ch

And when u want the biz my brick city outlaws will bury u niggas
Im so cool when i be doin my numbers
Caddilac Tah:

James Gotti:
U think you hard as f**k
But when the slug hit u dead if ya name ain't armored truck
Murder inc outlaws and the floys is here bang bang shoot em up or boys is near
Stampedin anything in our way will attract war
If you smart you'll slide over like handicap doors
I ain't a killer i jus spark alot
So when i squeeze im turnin your whole block into a parkin lot
Understand im the grimey floy wanna trip to death then try me for it
Crazy since 94
Thats why cats dont hang around me like chinese stores
One step ahead of you get more guys
U strap wit 44's we strapped wit 45's
F**k talk get the chalk out
You'll be lucky if u able to crawl or walk out
Ja Rule:
I live the mob life
So when i pop up in your life and i pop twice
Get down i spits more than rounds
And niggas bleed heavier than hoes on they period
This sound gotta move faster than ferious
But nah i ain't ludacris
Im here to let you niggas no i ain't new to this
Gun but ya b**ch
Thats the way i get down beieve my style
Its murda clap a nigga then hide the burna
Lern ya balm ya like imbalmin fluid
Intil your limbs feel the loss of movement
In the hospital critical livin again its murda
Yea gun subliminal style and bang with nothin but criminals

The rap gods is spiritual

Chorus:
The Life (Echoes)
