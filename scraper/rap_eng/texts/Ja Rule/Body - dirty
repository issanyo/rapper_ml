Here we go now
Shake your body like a tambourine
Give it to me now, you know
Shake your body like a tambourine
Baby, its your body, body, your body can't complain
Its the thing that makes me say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, its your body, body, body, your body, body, body
That got us goin crazy, shawty, its your body
Shawty got a history, a freakin [Incomprehensible]
Keep em trickin and shes send em [Incomprehensible]
Ride around 3 am and Im makin that phone call
Even though Im high Im comin, baby, Ill be right over
Yes, Im feelin myself, especially right now
Your doors will lift up, the top will come down
You that new car Im drivin now
Baby, yous a rider, let me pull up beside you
But I ain't tryna get put out
Im just really tryna put it in your mouth
To see what it do, baby, whats it about

Its the thing that makes me say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, its your body, body, body, your body, body, body

Back and forth and forth and back, baby
She like hit it from the back, Ill ride you later
And we was only in the elevator
Hope the puss is tight cause the head was major
When women dont wanna come I make em
Beg em, I make em feel like Im doin them a favor
Give an ultimatum cause Rule ain't no west savior
Im horrible like West Craven
If you considered a hoe, baby, I can't save you
What I can do for you goes without sayin
Not sayin that I want us to be naked, baby
I dont want you to think that Im ungrateful, baby
Especially when you twork that, work that body
For me in the club and all eyes is on you
We dont need to talk money cause my mind is on it
Besides, baby, you know what I want
Baby, its your body, body, your body can't complain
Its the thing that makes me say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, its your body, body, body, your body, body, body
That got us goin crazy, baby, its your body
Girl, I got a history, I've taken bitches home
Sleepin with em, then I kick em, I wish they kept us on
Ride around 6 am and Im tryin to sleep and go
Cause Im high and its too early, too early in the mornin
I gotta get, get, get up, get dressed so fresh, so fly
Im only here for the night, baby
Tomorrows L.A., the next week its MIA
Around the world and back again
Its me, bitches, love the way I hit it
Reminiscin about it, baby, skys the limit
Give me the [Incomprehensible] ass to get in where I fit in
We ain't fuck in a good minute
Baby, its your body, body, your body can't complain
Its the thing that makes me say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, its your body, body, body, your body, body, body
That got us goin crazy
Baby, its your body, body, your body can't complain
Its the thing that makes me say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, its your body, body, body, your body, body, body
That got us goin crazy, baby, its your body
Baby, its your body
Baby, its your body
