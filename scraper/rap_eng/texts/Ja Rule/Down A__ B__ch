Ja Rule, Chuck B-more, every thug needs a lady
And every thug needs a down ass bitch
Huh, feel me, every thug needs a lady
Baby, I'm convinced you my down ass bitch
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd lie for me like you lovin' me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd die for me like you cry for me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd kill for me like you comfort me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
Girl, I'm convinced you're my down ass bitch
I know that you're lovin' me 'cause you thug with me
Who bust slugs for me, my baby
Who gon' kill for you like I comfort you
Who else but the Rule, you feel me
Girl, when we connect with dots we hit the spot
Twin Benzs you ride hard, I ride drop
And to make it better, baby got the Nina' Biretta tucked low
When I'm two cars back with the four, four
And it freaks you out on your mommas couch
That's what us thugs be 'bout, you know me
And when I pray for love, baby, pray for us
Who celebrates the thugs, my lady
Got me seekin' capital game when I spit sixteen
Where the bars are sixteen in the doors of cars
A star is born in the hood
Made a name live on R U L E, ladies, feel me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd lie for me like you lovin' me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd die for me like you cry for me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd kill for me like you comfort me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
Jerk, I'm convinced you're that down ass bitch
Now, I'ma show you blood or love, there's no belly
You bounce from blow sellin'
Dough amounts to no tellin', there'll be no tellin'
Snitches get it back who gets to your backs for, my boy
What part of the game is that, huh?
Niggas, and they feelings 'cause I handle your dealings
Keep your name intact, my fame's intact
So cops won't know what it's hittin' for
Now hoes wanna know what you shittin' for
'Cause I'm your bitch, Bonnie to your Clyde
It's mental, mash your enemies, we out in the rental
I'm your bitch, niggas run up on, ya
Shift ya lungs, who's your organ donor?
What they know about extreme measures, I'ma ride
With you and my baby, three-eighty at my side
And we lock the town, I'm as down as any thug
My love, they gotta take us in blood, what?
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd lie for me like you lovin' me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd die for me like you cry for me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd kill for me like you comfort me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
Girl, I'm convinced you're my down ass bitch
Baby, you could die from love
At any given time I could die from slugs
But that's what this life is capable of
The death and the life of a bitch and a thug
Is what I'm scared of
But got a woman who ain't afraid
To tuck the toast in the Escalade
Pop on niggas, that showin' me shade
But only for the Rule 'cause that's, my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair that don't care
Blazed by the shots and flares, girl, c'mon
Follow me and bust back at police conceal ya, heat
It's a bit much to blaze up Rule and Chuck
N I G, the Murderous, I N C
With one on the hip, one in the holster
Nigga, will toast ya' quick especially a down ass bitch
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd lie for me like you lovin' me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd die for me like you cry for me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd kill for me like you comfort me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
Girl, I'm convinced you're my down ass bitch
Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch, thug on, ladies
Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch, thug on, baby
Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch, thug on, ladies
Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch, thug on, baby
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd lie for me like you lovin' me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd die for me like you cry for me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd kill for me like you comfort me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
Girl, I'm convinced you're my down ass bitch
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
If you'd lie for me like you lovin' me
Baby say, yeah, baby say, yeah
