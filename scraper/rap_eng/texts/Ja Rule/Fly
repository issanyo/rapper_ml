Wanessa
Hey, Ja Rule
Uh, baby... Brazil

Question:
Who's back at gym wrestling
With most protein less beings
Shpes begin to shack into every nestling
You guested it was I in a G T
Ruling with Wanessa you know we rule this...
I know you're looking at me
But there is something to see
Something special that you can't deny
I've got my dreams, can't let them fade
I wanna show the world that I can make it right, right
Moving, Wanessa, baby
Guess you know about that, right?
There is go some king another
(I think about this at it all)
Don't matter what you say about me
(I saw my way up to the top)
This is my life (This is for you)
You wanna try me I'll sent off
I've been feel so many things
(This is the way I've been)
Made me the girl I'm
(You know my history)
You know that I will keep searching for something more
And I'll fly
I'll sing the way I feel
And I'll fly
I'll show you that I'm real
And I'll fly
The time changed my mind
Come and let me take you on this ride
I've seen your world so let me show you mine
If you could see, there is no such a thing
As a perfection that you want from me
Just look around you, nobody is perfect
Like everyone, you gonna keep on your in
There is love I haven't sigh
(To keep you carry on the line)
I'm gonna show that I can
(I'll make you see that I'm alive)
Like a bird flies away
It goes me on that I can see
Just say you come with me
I will see you, baby
And I'll fly
I'll sing the way I feel
And I'll fly
I'll show you that I'm real
And I'll fly
I'll sing the way I feel
And I'll fly
I'll show you that I'm real
And I'll fly
(So think... So think...)
I'm trying to change my mind
Come and let me take you on this ride (Yeah, man)
I've seen your world so let me show you mine (Oh, baby)
Come and let me take you on this ride (Wanessa, Wanessa)
I've seen your world so let me show you mine
(Oh, yeah)
Wanessa, she is a superstar, can you see
Her in the club with your binoculars?
So I have seen it all through
The lenses of my Pumas
She is the woman of my own heart
Especially when the you cool stops
You are my Tuesdar Baryshnikov cause you
Will be quite in "Dance With the Stars"
This thing of us is not a loco strain of
Strains is more like a can I get closer?
You body is calling
So I'm gonna go and pick up
This is a relationship with no hang ups
It can't be about just us
Is just us, is just like law
It ain't no rules when
It comes to love and more
Me and you, maskinh and colliding
Creates something so fly
But there's so many things
(This is the way I've been)
Made me the girl I'm
(You know my history)
You know that I will keep searching for something more
And I'll fly
Come and let me take you on this ride
And I'll fly
I've seen your world so let me show you mine
And I'll fly
Come and let me take you on this ride
And I'll fly

And I don't wanna stop
