[Intro]
I just never had time

[Hook: Jon Doe]
Between the lights and the cameras
The trips from New York to Paris
It seems I never can manage to say that I
(I just never had time)
Living my life on the road
And every city is home
I should have picked up the phone and said that I
(I just never had time)
I never had the time
The time I need to say
That what's been killing me
Is, baby, one four three

[Verse 1]
Everybody you was with said you was shit, girl
That's right: the it girl
The one I'm really trying to get with, girl
Not once, but kinda like a refill
I feel, I cannot get any better
You niggas getting cheese better make mines fetta
Spread it on brushetta
Been all around the world seen these bitches won't shut up
How did we meet? Sucked and fucked ? caught up
? brought up
I've been wanting to experience real love
I really wanted to explore love, I just never had time

[Hook: Jon Doe]
I never had the time
The time I need to say
That what's been killing me
Is ? one for three
Living my life on the road
And every city is home
I should have picked up the phone and say that I
(I just never had time)

[Verse 2]
Let it rain, let it rain, rain down, on me
I've been really trying to be someone I never been
Trying to visualize something I never seen
And if I can't see it, how could it every be?
I'm just trying to be more than a memory, I pray
Remember me, miss me when I'm gone
18 months ain't that long
I need to get away from it all: the niggas, the bitches, the business
Like Drake said, the hardest part is minding your own
Fuck 'em all bilingual, maricon
I'm on the beach with my feet up: Monaco
The sad part about it, though
I wanted you to be here, I just never ? say so
? say no
I couldn't think you was waiting on my call
(I just never had time)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
If I'll never get the chance to say it
Them 3 words: so famous
Or infamous, depending how your dope do
Me myself, I'm more ? love true
I'm here, but never there for the moment
Especially wondering how we still do it
? done it
Sex is always, "Who's coming?"
So selfish, but so wanted
If there's anything you learn from this is
Don't let your feelings lie dormant
Cause ?
I wish I would have told you
(I just never had time)

[Hook]
