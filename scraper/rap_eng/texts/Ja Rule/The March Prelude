[Intro]
Yeah, been a slave too long
All my murderers
Let's march my niggas

[Verse]
Lord, can we get a break? (Lord, can we get a break?)
We ain't really happy here (We ain't really happy here)
Take a look into our eyes (Take a look into our eyes)
And see pain without fear (And see pain without fear)
Lord, can we get a break? (Lord, can we get a break?)
We ain't really happy here (We ain't really happy here)
Take a look into our eyes (Take a look into our eyes)
And see pain without fear (And see pain without fear)
Lord, can we get a break? (Lord, can we get a break?)
We ain't really happy here (We ain't really happy here)
Take a look into our eyes (Take a look into our eyes)
And see pain without fear (And see pain without fear)
Lord, can we get a break? (Lord, can we get a break?)
We ain't really happy here (We ain't really happy here)
Take a look into our eyes (Take a look into our eyes)
And see pain without fear (And see pain without fear)
Lord, oh Lord, can we get a break?
