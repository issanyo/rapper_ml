Chapter II
Ashanti

[Ashanti (from "Foolish")]
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you...

[Ashanti (from "Happy")]
Found you, boy
All my life
I've been feeling for you
Everyday
I'm so happy, baby...

[Ashanti & Ja Rule (from "Down 4 U")]
I wanna be your chick
And only for the Rule, baby
I'll ride for you, die for you
Do anything yout want me to
I'll be you down ass chick
I'm gonna be here when you need...

[Ashanti (from "Baby")]
I love it when I hear your name, got me saying
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...

[Ashanti & Ja Rule (from "Mesmerize")]
Love it when you look at me, baby
Your lips, your smile, I
Love it when you kiss me, baby
Your hips, those thighs, I
Love it when you call me, baby
And I can't...
