[Shady] (Ja Rule)
Girl you know my style, I've been peepin for a while

I know what you're thinkin, just anotha star seekin
But baby money ain't a thang (Money ain't a thang, money ain't a thang)
Cause I can see yourself with me, and I can see myself with you
Honey what'choo wanna doooo? (Baby girl, what'cha wanna do?)
Bump that playa shit I talk, a nigga ain't just tryin to fuck
Shady niggas get lonely too (What oy know about that?)

Hook 1

[Shady] (Ja Rule)
Rolex's and Lexuses got you cashin checks and shit
All yours if you roll with me (Come on baby, let me show you some shit)
Finest female on the block, 'tween them legs you keep it hot
Cool that ass with I-C-E (Be easy)
Cause I can see yourself with me, and I can see myself with you
Honey what'choo wanna doooo? (What you wann do with me, huh?)
Bump that playa shit I talk, a nigga ain't just tryin to fuck
Shady niggas get lonely too (Yeah yeah)

[Tah Murdah]
Yo, if you was fucking with me
I tell you, we couldn't fuckin for free
You'd be a bitch without chips if it was up to me
In other words, if it costs for you
Bet I won't be the reason you be flossin boo, neva spendin a penny
Neva no slow necks, fuck you around fo' think you gonna down this henny
And inhale this 'dro, you gotta be kiddin ho
I'm the one with the wetter flow, and there I neva go
Just stack and let it grow, I ain't got chedda' to blow
Shit, I' tryin to see the dealer for the five double O
Six, ya heard bitch? Picture this
Me gettin hairs and nails done, neva
I rather put it in ya stomach however ya want it

[Black Child]
If you ever kiss this dick, then you my bitch
If you ever pushed my whip, you hold my bricks
Can't roll my spliff, I smoke 'dro and shit
??? I get dough, and don't share my shit
You hear my shit, people wear this dick
I don't fear that click, I'll tear that shit
And won't lick it, you heard what I said
I might lie on my tongue but won't lie on my head

[Ja Rule]
Bitches lets get right, niggas lets get right
Murderers throw in for life
We gettin high tonight
Whether you know it or not baby
I get head in the drop baby
Ridin' down Sunset baby
I've been somewhat of a freak lately

Baby girl if you was my bitch, you can get a taste dick
I like the mouth moist once I put it on ya lips
I hearin a soft voice like "this my shit"
And in the back of my mind I'm like "she can't be serious"
Home is where it is, and home wreckers love to leave heads in your whip
To fuck up your shit, baby girl is I was your NIGGA
Baby girl is you was my BITCH, it would be murderous
