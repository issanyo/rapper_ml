Ja rule:
Yeah all you ?
Ladies, cristian
Let's get 'em
Girl you be checkin on me
And i wanna know if we cut what it's gonna be
You f*ckin with the wrong
Expect nothing less than diamonds, benz, perfumes
One things for certain
Im searchin for mrs. right now that's right
Baby if you like i get you our of the night
Put you in the little cute ?
There's a problem maa, i fell for you ha ha
Cristian Alexanda:
I think we got a problem, she's too fine
The way she works her body man it's blowing my mind
I know im not gonna be okay, if she leaves
And now she got me looking, and she's staring at me
My situation's changed all caught up, and i wish that i can fix out
And we're gonna get up, cause her eyes i can't resist
I'd give anything to make her mine

Chorus:
She's too fine, she's so fine, she's too fine
She's so fine, i'd do anything to make her mine
Girl work your body, you got me all hypnotic
Girl we get naughty, cause girl i want you back
If you want me, im tryna get to you
There's nothing that i can do, everybody knows she's too fine
She's so fine, too fine, she's so fine
Cristian Alexanda:
I never thought i'd say this bout some girl
I used to be a player but she's working my world
I know she's not gonna be okay if i leave
Cause now her friends are stepping over talkin to me
My situation's changed all caught up, and a game that i can win now
And we're gonna get up, cause her eyes/ass i can't resist
I'd give anything to make her mine

Chorus:
She's too fine, she's so fine, she's too fine
She's so fine, i'd do anything to make her mine
Girl work your body, you got me all hypnotic
Girl we get naughty, cause girl i want you back
If you want me, im tryna get to you
There's nothing that i can do, everybody knows she's too fine
She's so fine, too fine, she's so fine
Cristian Alexanda:
She look more like a beauty queen, from a movie scene
I said girl i dont mind, what do you mean I am the one
She took my hand to the floor, and we got it on
The way she's shakin, man there's ain't no escapin
Ja rule:
We've got too many issues and too many games
Got too many shoes to pack for two days
A good thing is that i think she goes both ways
Head game me, brought two friends look like twins
But let's play devil's advocate for one evening
And handle my buisness ? baby why wouldn't i
You be everything your heart desires. your so fine

Chorus:
She's too fine, she's so fine, she's too fine
She's so fine, i'd do anything to make her mine
Girl work your body, you got me all hypnotic
Girl we get naughty, cause girl i want you back
If you want me, im tryna get to you
There's nothing that i can do, everybody knows she's too fine
She's so fine, too fine, she's so fine
Cristian, Rule
