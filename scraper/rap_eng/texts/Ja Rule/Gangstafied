Hey Gotti, Hey Chuck
How the fuck we gon' keep droppin this fire on these niggas?
Know what I'm saying we killin' 'em on the radio
Then we jump off onto this gangsta shit
Bless our niggas on the block
Could bring it however, you know what I'm sayin'?
However they want it
I don't think these niggas understand we still don't give a fuck
Know what I'm talkin' about?

[Chorus]
Niggas want the drama?
They can get it 'cause we soldiers and we ridin' 'till we die
Straight gangstafied y'all, betta recognize
Sent the clique to fuck
We be pushin over bitches 'bout they motherfuckin buisness
And we gon' be thuggin it fo' life
You could see it in their eyes, dog they never lie

[Caddillac Tah]
Yeah, yo
Niggas trying to take us off our grind
We back for the first time, like luga
Chrisin' nigga listen we holdin rugaz
You wavin them pee shootas
We blowin that sticky buda, this gangsta shit I ain't new to
Nigga, better guard your madula
When I spit I'm hittin a shoota
And used to the drag
So I keep the hammer tucked under the Mitchell and Ness
Two clips in the vest, leave yo' family stressed
Yeah I'm a son of a bastard
Gun playin I mastered, way above the average
Swiffin' and cash is hate day(Hands up!)
Go on the floor nigga it's pay day, you know the procedure
Her animal and holdin heat it totin the rifa
Rollin off the purple people eating the Ferrari Medina's
Push the red line, Nigga for that bread I grind
And each and everytime, I catch a nigga slippin' I'm gon' get him
So stay on yo' P's, We gangstafied G's
And thanks to I.G we flyin at high speed

Niggas want the drama?
They can get it 'cause we soldiers and we ridin' 'til we die
Straight gangstafied y'all, betta recognize
Sent the clique to fuck
We be pushin over bitches 'bout they motherfuckin business
And we gon' be thuggin it fo' life
You could see it in their eyes, dawg they never lie

[Ronnie Bumps]
I'm the reason that you wake up and cry(It's on nigga)
I'ma be 'till you crawl up and die(hold on nigga)
For the first time I feelin my light(it's on nigga)
We movin weight if the price's is right(hold on nigga)
Gotta tell 'em they ain't talkin, for them niggas who creepin'
Gotta tangle in the walkin', You either dead when you sleepin'(Tie 'em up!)
Gimme a minute you be, you be back in the flittin'Huggin the clip
You wishin it wasn't a day like this(I wonder why)
I be in yo' crib bangin yo' bitch(I love to fly)
Let her give you head and shit
When you done give her back I got some breads to get
That's yo' bitch, but my hoe, you owe me dough
I P-I-M-P, ridiculous my nigga
My guns stay empty, they sick of this nigga
I ran through the game, Shots wit no name, Blocks wit gun play
Like we're on cocaine Nigga!

[Ja Rule]
For the life of me, I can't see why niggas run on the guard
It's unrighteously hard, and foolish like Sean
But I know, niggas is scared of the kid it's cool
If you don't know by now niggas the name is Rule
I put it on you fake fashion and pump motherfuckers
'Cause I'm always on time, especially when I quarter past nine
In the mornin nigga, Catch you yawnin nigga, It's murda my nigga
Fuck 'em 'cause these bitches got a dream to hear me
Like I got a different stroke, and I'm fucked in pennies
But the reality it hurt more than the truth
The bitches you be fuckin on, be fuckin me too
It's surf boo, The trust with niggas with Benz's and big trucks
Them MTV cribs, off the islands here
And y'all scared I can see it in yo' eyes
'Cause y'all don't want no more driver in yo' eyes

Niggas want the drama?
They can get it 'cause we soldiers and we ridin' 'til we die
