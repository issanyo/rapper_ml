If you creep pon your man no mek no-one see you
Can't mek nobody have no secret for you
Hookie jookie and the nookie that i'm giving to you
(Lady's voice)Uhhhh, uhh, uhhh
If you creep pon your man no mek no-one see you
Can't mek nobody have no secret for you
Hookie jookie and the nookie that i'm giving to you
(Lady's voice)Uhhhh, uhh, uhhh
Ask a woman if she's faithful she says yes indeed
Can't swear for a woman when she is in need
Overtaken by a hunger that she has to feed
Whoever gives her what she wants gonna follow their lead
(Strange Voice)What do you think will happen when she wants the ride
When you won't give her and she steps outside
Knock on my door at a quarter past five
Well you know i'm going to let her inside
Guess what will happen when i draw those blinds
What was yours is now suddenly mine
She comes back and shes all full of smiles
And your too dumb to recognize these signs
Can't mek nobody have no secret for you
Hookie jookie and the nookie that i'm giving to you
(Lady's voice)Uhhhh, uhh, uhhh
If you creep pon your man no mek no-one see you
Can't mek nobody have no secret for you
Hookie jookie and the nookie that i'm giving to you
(Lady's voice)Uhhhh, uhh, uhhh
When a man gives a gal bun him give her that with cheese
Meet a woman now and later have her on her knees
But to hide it like a woman isn't done with ease
No matter how you try to lie the truth she always sees
(Ladys voice)Uhhh...
(Strange voice)The guilt is written all over your face
She already done tried your case
Cause you made it so easy to trace
Now somebodys gonna take your place
So when you're out there and you're having your fling
Slamming and banging and bedsprings sing
Back home in bed like she won't notice a thing
Down there smells like Irish Spring
Can't mek nobody have no secret for you
Hookie jookie and the nookie that i'm giving to you
(Lady's voice)Uhhhh, uhh, uhhh
If you creep pon your man no mek no-one see you
Can't mek nobody have no secret for you
Hookie jookie and the nookie that i'm giving to you
