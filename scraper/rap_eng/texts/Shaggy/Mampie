[Intro]
Now this one dedicates to all the girl-who-weight-lovers
Stay 'em inside and this I'm pleasing because I'm now Jamaican
I tell you about this 'cause I know you all care, yo
You hear me now star

[Chorus]
Jump and spread out, you're no mampie
Get I man jump and rock, gal you're no mampie, gal
Shout it out, you're no mampie, and a
Reel it out, you're no mampie

[Verse 1]
See me now
Jesus Christ, a mampie-mania
Everybody have a mampie inna them corner
Gal a dare me go a dance, stand a all over
Me have mi bad-minded friend, Red Fox mi partner
When me come inna the dance, one piece of drama
See the whole heap of mampie there all over
All the gal them big, fat, stink and slubber
And the man them little bit untollerant
Well everybody have a mampie caught up in a corner
And I give them bubble and left, right and center
I man rub out a gal until her front catch fire
Me say three bingo-bucket deh pon the bar counter
Say three dodge fat and bubble pon the fire
That are a cow ragout, chicken body, mannish water
That a weh the mampie drink now fi give them stamina

When them come inna the bar shoot under the shower, she just
Lift up a titty fi air to wash short, aha
Wash under the titty, soap and water, she just
Put down the titty, one piece of drama

And put her hand pon the air then say: "Thank you Father"
And me glad fi know say that the same things still deh ya
