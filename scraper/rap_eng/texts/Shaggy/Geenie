[Intro: Shaggy, Brian & Tony]
She definitely mine until the end of time
Talking about this sweet little girl
My darling princess
I gotta get Brian & Tony Gold to help me on this one
In the whole wide world
Allow me to express my love
Baby you're definitely mine
Shaggy

[Verse 1: Brian & Tony]
She was a genie and a perfect work of art
She had a certain light that overcame the dark
I couldn't imagine this love to fall apart
Oh baby my love
The one who won my heart

Oh the girl is mine

Another woman in a mi life there is no contest

[Verse 3: Brian & Tony]
The way that she moved was like she glided
Through the breeze
With every step she took she made my poor heart
Freeze
Sweetness she portrayed
Girl my love gets stronger
Day by day(BOO)

[Chorus: Brian & Tony]
She's mine
She's mine
She's mine
Oh the girl is mine

[Verse 4: Shaggy]
I say goodness gracious me
She's got me on my knees now I'm begging please
Why don't we take a trip down to the Florida Keys
Let's spend some gees and set your mind at ease
I'm here to make your life better
Express yourself in a your love letter
I'm here to give you extreme pleasure
I'm the man you write about down in your
Ledger
