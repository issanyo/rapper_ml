Intro: Shaggy (Rayvon)
Straight outta Flatbush, always tek it back (Whoa oh)
Fi yuh peeps (Whoa whoa whoa oh)
Don't worry about it, it's been brought up
Cause you never know what your gonna turn out to be

(No oh oooh oooh) Life has it's funny twist and turns yuh nah mean (Yay yay)

Chorus: Rayvon
Back in the days, tried and failed but look at me now
How, things have changed, had no friends but look at me now
It, seems so strange, no one cared but look at me now
Fortune and fame, who would guess but look at me now

Verse 1: Shaggy
Friends, spend nuh time wid dem
I was the kid who never follow many trends
Used to wear the glasses with the soda bottle lens
Girls didn't like me and a few would just pretend
It's funny back in school the guys that were so cool
Are the very ones who wish them could a be walkin inna mi shoes
Now tell me whose the fool, them never have a clue
That's why I'm here to dedicate this song to all of you, hey hey!!!

Chorus: Rayvon
Back in the days (The days) tried and failed but look at me now
How, things have changed (How things changed) had no friends but look at me now
It, seems so strange (So strange) no one cared but look at me now
Fortune and fame (Oooh wee) who would guess but look at me now

Verse 2: Shaggy
I, never realized, I could make reality di tings I fantasize

Stuck to my plan and to everyone surprise
Even those who doubt a stand before mi mesmerized
I bloom delay a late, I couldn't get an eight
Di cheerleadin chicks grew up to all be overweight
See now I lookin great, I wonda what they ate
To that I'm really happy wid my supermodel date, hey hey

Chorus: Rayvon
Back in the days (I know) tried and failed but look at me now

How, things have changed (Shooby dooby doo yeah) had no friends but look at me now
It, seems so strange (I know I know) no one cared but look at me now
Fortune and fame (No no) who would guess but look at me now

Bridge: Shaggy
If you think you got it figured out well listen to me
Don't ever underestimate what people can be
Now who's the one that's most likely to succeed
It's usually the one's you don't see, hey

If you think you got it figured out well listen to me
Don't ever underestimate what people can be
Now who's the one that's most likely to succeed
It's usually the one's you don't see, come again

Chorus: Rayvon
Back in the days (Back in the days) tried and failed but look at me now
How, things have changed (How things have changed) had no friends but look at me now
It, seems so strange (So strange) no one cared but look at me now

Fortune and fame (Oh) who would guess but look at me now
Back in the days (Back in the days) tried and failed but look at me now
How, things have changed (How things have changed) had no friends but look at me now
It, seems so strange (So strange, hey) no one cared but look at me now
Fortune and fame, who would guess but look at me now

Outro: Rayvon

Back in the days, how things have changed, oh, um um um, um um um um, um um um um, hey!
