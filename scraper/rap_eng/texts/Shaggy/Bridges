I bet you wish you never burn that bridge
Oh no cause now you'd like to cross it

I bet you wish you never burn that bridge
Oh no cause now you'd like to cross it

I bet you wish you never burn that bridge
Oh no cause now you'd like to cross it

I bet you wish you never burn that bridge
Oh no cause now you'd like to cross it

Climbing up the ladder you better watch your steps
Watch how you a flex and watch the moves you meck
Careful of the people you disrespect
Dem di repercussions man nuh take nuh checks
Cause when you coming down they might not wanna treat you right
And when you coming down that's when you gonna get the fight
And now your wishing that you were a little more polite
And now the table turn and everything a come to light

(Repeat)

It's no coincident the people you meet
You haffi careful how you move in the street
The same man you pass when you going up
When you coming down, him a laugh and a grin him teeth
Grandma say today for you, tomorrow for me
That's when you have to face your real sorrows for real
I know you wish you never burn your bridges
But who cyaa hear haffi feel
A cyaa believe yo burn it, yo burn it, a weh you a go walk
When you haffi cross the river in a dark
You burn it, you burn all your bridges in the past
Now your future lead you to the same path

(Repeat)
