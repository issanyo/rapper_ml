[Intro: Shaggy (Beres Hammond)]
Now in come the thing called....
Fi the ladies, you know?
Beres Hammond..
Shaggy!
Give it to me, do it to me, give it to me
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, no

[Chorus: Beres Hammond]
The way you make me feel
From deep down in my soul
I'm losing all control
Girl, I can't fight this feeling, no
It feels so right
Champagne and candlelight
The way you hold me tight
Girl, I can't fight this feeling

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Woman you're nice
Smile 'pon your face it's like you bright up all mi night
Girl, mi can't wait fi give you everything you like
Love you from the day you grace mi sight
I guarantee that you'd be satisfied
Don't be afraid to break the rules
On to better things, so tell the little man fi cool
Thank mi lucky star, I can't believe I found a jewel
Man dem all a spot you and a drool
So make dem know say that me have the tool

[Chorus: Beres Hammond]
The way you make me feel
From deep down in my soul

Girl, I can't fight this feeling, no
It feels so right
Champagne and candlelight
The way you hold me tight
Girl, I can't fight this feeling

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Woman, you bring di niceness, priceless, gyal you have the place

You know say no bag of man can come call your name

Woman your body tight, hotter, woman you're really blessed
Polite, proper, cut above the rest

That's why ah, girl I confess

[Verse 3:]
Passion, passion
Dance and you smile you beckon, beckon
And I just know what it is you reckon
Gimme more, gimme more

And you can bet on your four-leaf clover

[Chorus: Beres Hammond]
The way you make me feel
From deep down in my soul

Girl, I can't fight this feeling, no
It feels so right

The way you hold me tight
Girl, I can't fight this feeling
