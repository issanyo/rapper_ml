Uh, that's right, reality check
You know what I mean?
Street life's eh, Scorpion, yeah, uh
When I was young, I use to dream of being rich
Have a lot of houses and cars
Couldn't know which one was which
And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
You think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow
There was a treasure chest
Sometimes having more is really less
So take a look inside yourself
You'll realize you're really blessed
No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone who has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay your dues
So don't worry just push on through
Keep'n it real
Gotta big up all my peoples who be working
On the future though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow
And I forgot to have myself the house
The mansion, and the Benz
I'm not the type of brother who be making mad ends
I got myself a girl but we be kicking it as friends
Is not enough for me now that depends
Again, not everything you want
Is everything you really need
The standard of society is more deviated by greed
Are you prepared to follow?
Tell me, are you prepared to lead?
So persevere and you'll succeed
Keep'n it real
Gotta big up all my peoples who be working
On the future though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow
All the harsh realities
Appears to come in twos and threes
Don't worry 'cuz there'll be a better day
One thing I can promise you
Just keep on keeping on, I swear to you
There's gonna be a brighter day
Back in the days, I use to dream of being rich
Have a lot of houses and cars
Couldn't know which one was which
And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairy tale life, perfect without a ditch
You think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow
There was a treasure chest
Sometimes having more is really less
So take a look inside yourself
You'll realize you're really blessed
No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone who has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay your dues
So don't worry just push on through
Keep'n it real
Gotta big up all my peoples who be working
On the future though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow
That's right, see me, yeah
Give thanks fa wha you have, ya kno
And when you think that it's bad
There's always somebody that's worse
Know what I'm saying? Give Jah blessing, see me
