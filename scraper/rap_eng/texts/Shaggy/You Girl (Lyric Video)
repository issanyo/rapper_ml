Straight up this love is like a blessing from above
Baby girl you know we go together like hand and glove
'Cause girl I'm always 'bout to see you
Said this is Shaggy and Ne-Yo

I know when it's you girl, you girl
Sunshine and the flowers, jealous of the power
Of you girl, you girl
Reason that my heart beats we hit the bed but no sleep
Ooo girl, ooo girl
Body like a blessing say amen when you undress in front of me
Oo wee oo wee
I would happily call you the better half of me

Good lovin' wake me up in the morning
Make it right before the lights up
Put on the pleasure when her body is calling
I make her face light up
Mi get the rating from just how mi performing
She know I got the right touch
And she no stop request me daily
My one and only lady 'cause lately she knows that
I understand the body language you speaking
That physical attraction
The little things you do ya temperature peaking
I'm loving your dimensions
Well put together not be to revealing
You've captured my attention
'Cause girl you got the real thing
That on my bended knee thing
My feelings are so sure

I know when it's you girl, you girl
Sunshine and the flowers, jealous of the power
Of you girl, you girl
Reason that my heart beats we hit the bed but no sleep
Ooo girl, ooo girl
Body like a blessing say amen when you undress in front of me
Oo wee oo wee
I would happily call you the better half of me

Yo

We nah fi force it our love continue growing
Keep it spontaneous 'cause our thing is never boring
'Cause every night girl it's your body I'm exploring
I'm knowing
Just what you need to keep you glowin'
Just like a river girl your body's ever flowing
I'm genuine in everything that I am showing
Girl I'll protect you from the rain my heart is pouring

You've got terrible days
I know you could find somebody better, yea

Am I deserving of you? No never
