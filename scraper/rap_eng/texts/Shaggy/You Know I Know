[Intro - Shaggy]
Mr Lover Lover
Shaggy, Olly Murs, our time

[Verse 1 - Olly Murs]
You know I heard about you
You got a flirty mind
And I confess that you've been blessed
The way you dress is borderline
The more I think about it
I wanna make you mine
We pretend that we're just friends
But I think it's time we redefine

[Pre-Chorus - Olly Murs]
I've waited up all night to see ya
Baby meet me at the bar
You don't have to dress up for me, yeah
Because you're perfect as you are

[Chorus - Olly Murs]
All of these things that I wanna do
All of these things make me think of you
All of these moves that I wanna use
You know I know that you want me
All of these tricks that I wanna try
All of these licks, wanna do it right
You don't have to tease, you ain't gotta lie
You know I know that you want me

[Post-Chorus - Olly Murs]
You know I know, you know I know
You know I know that you want me
You know I know, you know I know
You know I know that you want me

[Verse 2 - Shaggy]
Gyal, try play cute; she want me bad
From the way she look, I know she like my swag
Every time I spot her looking at the ceiling
Gotta feeling catching all kinda feelings
You on my IG, checking out my Snaps
Trying hard now not to double tap
Well baby girl you should know this side the real thing
You are the queen, know your boy could play your dream team

[Pre-Chorus - Olly Murs]
I've waited up all night to see you
So, baby meet me at the bar
You don't have to dress up for me, yeah
Because you're perfect as you are

[Chorus - Olly Murs]
All of these things that I wanna do
All of these things make me think of you
All of these moves that I wanna use
You know I know that you want me
All of these tricks that I wanna try
All of these licks, wanna do it right
You don't have to tease, you ain't gotta lie
You know I know that you want me

[Post-Chorus - Olly Murs]
You know I know, you know I know
You know I know that you want me
You know I know, you know I know
You know I know that you want me

[Bridge - Olly Murs]
You know I know you'll never find another
Hey, just call me up and call me Mr Lover
Hey, I'm in disguise when I'm undercover
Hey, you know I know that you want me
You know I know you'll never find another
Hey, just call me up and call me Mr Lover (Mr Lover, Lover)
Hey, I'm in disguise when I'm undercover
Hey, you know I know that you want me

[Chorus - Olly Murs]
All of these things that I wanna do
All of these things make me think of you
All of these moves that I wanna use
You know I know that you want me
All of these tricks that I wanna try
All of these licks, wanna do it right
You don't have to tease, you ain't gotta lie
You know I know that you want me

[Post-Chorus - Olly Murs]
You know I know, you know I know
You know I know that you want me
You know I know, you know I know
You know I know that you want me

You know I know, you know I know
You know I know that you want me
You know I know, you know I know
You know I know that you want me

[Outro - Shaggy]
Mr. Lover Lover
Your eyes tell no lies, girl
Can't wait to get around of me cover
Open up the Benz-O, power
