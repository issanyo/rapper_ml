[Verse 1: Toni Seawright & Shaggy]
Boy, what have you done for me?
I've been going down on you
You not going down on me
Girl, that's just how rude boys play
I don't have to take you there
I can please you in other ways

[Chorus: Shaggy]
Across the hall, neighbors hear the sound
Mr. Lover Lover's in town
Carpet burns from being on the ground
Rudy have hot gal a moan and groan
Crash oh dawn the phone
Baby, don't stop yeah you like that Simone
Champion lover the best pound for pound
Take you to the clouds without going downtown

[Verse 2: Toni Seawright & Shaggy]
Why, why don't you just change your ways?
Won't you open up your mind?
Boy, we're living in modern days
Girl, I'm coming from the school
Where if you want the job done right
You have to use the proper tool
You never been loved until you've been filled
Filled full of pleasure from the rude boy's skill
Passion and ecstasy, you know the drill
Full up your cup 'til your juice's spill
Leave the door open just for the thrill
Now you're at the point where you can't keep still
Covered in sweat but feeling the chill
That's the effect of a lover man's pill

[Bridge: Toni Seawright]
Tell me why you want to tease me baby (Oh yeah)
Don't you want to please me (baby)
Why you holding back when I know what's on you mind
Tell me why you want to tease me baby (Oh yeah)
Don't you want to please me (baby)
Why you holding back when I know what's on you mind

[Chorus: Shaggy]
Across the hall, neighbors hear the sound
Mr. Lover Lover's in town
Carpet burns from being on the ground
Rudy have hot gal a moan and groan
Crash oh dawn the phone
Baby, don't stop yeah you like that Simone
Champion lover the best pound for pound
Take you to the clouds without going downtown
