[Intro]
Yeah, luv, it's party time
Mohombi, Costi, Shaggy (rude boy)
Faydee

[Chorus: Mohombi and Faydee]
Habibi lei, Habibi lei, Habibi lei lei lei lei-lei
Habibi lei, Habibi lei, Habibi
I need your love, I need your love, I need your lalalalalala
Let me love you, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
If I love you, love me right back
The kind of love that keep you comin' back
If I love you, love me right back
Don't ever leave me, girl, don't do me that
So please (stay!), don't walk (away!)
Gimme another chance to love you the right (way!)
Girl, my true feelings pushing up
Woman, your love mi can't do without

[Verse 2: Faydee]
Who am I without you by my side?
Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark
Wishin' I could hold you now...
When you were here for me, I was not there for you
I was too blind, couldn't see what you did for me
Now I don't know what to do

[Bridge: Faydee]
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be right here for you
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be calling out for you, can you hear me?
(Toca toca latino!)

[Chorus: Mohombi and Faydee]
Habibi lei, Habibi lei, Habibi lei lei lei lei-lei
Habibi lei, Habibi lei, Habibi
(Quiero quie-ie, te quiero mi amor)
I need your love, I need your love, I need your lalalalalala
(Papi chulo) Let me love you, oh-oh

[Verse 3: Shaggy]
And every time that you think to leave
I'll be don't, don't, don't, don't go
And every time that you think of me
I'll want your big bright smile, just glow
There's no "us" without you, girl
And when mi look inna mi future, see you, girl
My true feelings pushing up
Woman, your love me can't do without

[Chorus: Mohombi and Faydee]
Habibi lei, Habibi lei, Habibi lei lei lei lei-lei
Habibi lei, Habibi lei, Habibi
(Tengo baby)
I need your love, I need your love, I need your lalalalalala
(Papi chulo) Let me love you, oh-oh
