Convertible, let your hair blow
Madi gras w___ they let the beats throw
Quick, flash, let me see your lights show
Uggh SHAGGY Tosses In One Time Around
It's not the size of the bulb, it's just the glow

VERSE 2 - SHAGGY

Well built chassis ___ bump around
Dunk in the trunk shey to deh sound
Twelve inch woofer wit deh full surround
Hot body watts curve to deh ground
I catcha from the side of yah grille
Can I ride, let me feel the thrill
Slow it down cause my oil will spill
Cruisin' the buffer zone, time to chill

Convertible, let your hair blow
Madi gras w___ they let the beats throw
Quick, flash, let me see your lights show
It's not the size of the bulb, it's just the glow

CHORUS - SHAGGY

BRIDGE

Hotty gurls, wet t-shirts, tank tops, spoilers and skirts
That's the way she flirts
Can you handle the ??curve/gurl
It's a car not a gurl
Get your mind out of the dirt
For whatever it's worth
Stop being ah pervert

CHORUS - SHAGGY
