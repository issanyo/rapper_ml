[Verse 1: Shaggy]
I’m sitting here staring at the four walls thinking what is it I got to do?
Get back my baby
Lonely is taking over now and my heart’s kinda heavy so
I gotta get back my baby
I’m feeling kind of hopeless now, should have never messed around
You never know what you got ‘til the moment that you lose it
I gotta get back my baby

[Verse 2: Maître Gims]
J'ai tout compris le jour où t'es partie
Encore une histoire, tu m'l'as dit sans le dire mais j'n'avais pas compris (mais j'n'avais pas compris)
J'n'aurais pas dû lâcher ta main, j'suis l'étranger sur ton chemin, c'est c'que je ressens
Stop, tu reviens chaque nuit et je me réveille

[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
I’m sitting here staring at the four walls thinking what is it I got to do?
Get back my baby
Lonely is taking over now and my heart’s kinda heavy so
I gotta get back my baby
I’m feeling kind of hopeless now, should have never messed around
You never know what you got ‘til the moment that you lose it
I gotta get back my baby

[Verse 3: Sting]
As she cries telling me that we’re through, I can’t deny
Won’t deny, on my bended knee
Best to give it a try
Stop, goodbye, she won’t even look me in the eye
Baby, I lied but I love you
I’ll do anything girl

[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
I’m sitting here staring at the four walls thinking what is it I got to do?
Get back my baby
Lonely is taking over now and my heart’s kinda heavy so
I gotta get back my baby
I’m feeling kind of hopeless now, should have never messed around
You never know what you got ‘til the moment that you lose it
I gotta get back my baby

[Verse 4: Shaggy]
At night I wonder
Why did I commit such blunder?
Now the pain is taking me under
She deleted my number
Nightmare, I woke from my slumber
Thinking baby what should I say
Tell me where have you gone?
Baby when you coming home?
I need you by my side and my throne
As I grow weak, without you girl I’m incomplete
I’ll do anything just to make it up

[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
I’m sitting here staring at the four walls thinking what is it I got to do?
Get back my baby
Lonely is taking over now and my heart’s kinda heavy so
I gotta get back my baby
I’m feeling kind of hopeless now, should have never messed around
You never know what you got ‘til the moment that you lose it
I gotta get back my baby
