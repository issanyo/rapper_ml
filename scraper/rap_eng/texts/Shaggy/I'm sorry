Yeah Yeah it's Shaggy... Tobi

CHORUS:

God I'm sorry
For I didn't know what I was doing
For I only thought that I was chilling
But I hurt you I hurt you, hurt you I hurt you, I'm sorry

RAP VERSE 1:

Just like in Scooby I'm shaggy
Looking for goodies and candy
Yet still balling into parties
Feeling like I got the bannies

And I used to think that I was on the right track
Taking weed I was taking crack
With the devil I was taking ranks but it felt like I was taking part

I was feeling I was in the hood
I was feeling I was in the groove
I was thinking I was feeling good
Now I know if I could change the groove
I would cause I never understood
That all I needed in life was you
Now I see old things becoming new
I know you love me I love you too

[Chorus]

RAP VERSE 2:

Nigga know he young and attractive
Knew the good things I did bad things now the fact is
I realized that I'm the bad guy trying tactics
I'm so sober I'm so dumb Lord help me practice

I know I'm living and breathing for you
I now believe and you know that it's true
I used to hate hoping love on the queue
Old things are past away all things are new

I pray this moment
You and me is not a cliche
Grace on my doorstep
Clearly written on my T-shirt

[Chorus]

RAP VERSE 3:

Everytime I sit and think about the things I did
I always end up feeling pissed and I just wish that I could fix it

But I got your grace
Now your name I raise
Not feeling disgrace
Now I seek your face

I will run my race
I am now an ACE
I will live my days
Always singing praise

I just don't know how to feel
The devil just wanted to kill me
I sinned and you paid the bill
I sinned and you just forgave me

I know that wasn't the deal
I'm sorry and you know I mean it
You love me I know it's real
You love me and I can feel it

[Chorus]

RAP VERSE 4:

All I'm tryna say is I'm sorry
Thank you for the things you did for me
Now I seek your face like I'm touring
Lord I wanna hear you call me

Lord I put you first go before me
Now I'm with you feeling like I'm balling
Cause you show me love like nobody
And I love you too I just love you too


Yeah yeah it's shaggy... Tobi
