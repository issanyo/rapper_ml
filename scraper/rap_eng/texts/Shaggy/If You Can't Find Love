If you can't find love
If you can't find love
If you can't find love
Then how you going to find yourself?

If you can't find love
If you can't find love
If you can't find love
Then how you going to find yourself?

A man owns a big house
A man got plenty money
A man got red wine to drink
In the land of milk and honey

A man’s got a job
He’s got some status and self-respect
But still he's never satisfied
So, what did he expect?

If you can't find love
If you can't find love
If you can't find love
Then how you going to find yourself?

[Shaggy]
Don’t have no honey, don’t have no wife
Loneliness a kill yuh when yuh go to sleep at night
Yuh have everything in life
But it nuh feel right if a woman is not by your side

Ain’t gotta fuss, ain’t gotta fight
Just find a girl that yuh know is definitely yuh type
Yuh have everything in life
But it nuh feel right if that woman is not by your side

[Sting]
A man got no worries
A man got no strife
A man got a million distractions
To keep him up at night

There’s a hole in his pocket
There’s no holes in his shoes
But there’s a hole in his life
You wonder, what’s a man to do?

If you can't find love
If you can't find love
If you can't find love
Then how you going to find yourself?

He talks to you of freedom
He talks to you of choice
As something he can’t jeopardize
You tell him there’s no compromise
There’s ghosts that must be exorcised
One day he’ll have to recognize

If you can't find love
If you can't find love
If you can't find love
Then how you going to find yourself?

If you can't find love
If you can't find love
If you can't find love
Then how you going to find yourself?

Love is the only thing can get you outta trouble
You living life, but you living in the rubble
Love is the only thing can get you outta trouble
Free your mind, dig yourself outta the rubble

Love is the only thing can get you outta trouble
You living life, but you living in the rubble
Love is the only thing can get you outta trouble
Free your mind, dig yourself outta the rubble
