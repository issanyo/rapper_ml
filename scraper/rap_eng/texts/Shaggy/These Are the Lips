Know what's good for your mistress is also good for your wife
She might just go elsewhere if she's been deprived
You dig that?
SHAGGY

**Chrous:**
I know it's something that she wants to do (that's right)
But I don't think that I should ask her to
Coz it doesn't quite seem right (say what?)
You see these are the lips that kiss my kids goodnight
Though my baby only aims to please (uh uh)
I can't let her see the freak in me
Coz it doesn't quite seem right
You see these are the lips that kiss my kids goodnight

Listen now, _______
Understand, this a something i wish _______
Friend you're wrong, dont think that she is the one
Freak woman, ___________
Understand, bet she do anything she can
And better than she a give it to another man
Protect your slum, __________ before she run
Remember man, she proabably better than the next woman
Understand

**Chorus:**
I know it's something that she wants to do
But I don't think that I should ask her to
Coz it doesn't quite seem right
You see these are the lips that kiss my kids goodnight
Though my baby only aims to please
I can't let her see the freak in me
Coz it doesn't quite seem right
You see these are the lips that kiss my kids goodnight

(this verse was difficult to understand)
Now you _________
Lock ______, tell me how you feelin coz you're here
In my car, hard to predict your ________

All that you need from a freak might be in your wife
Your house is your home and your future's looking bright

**Chorus:**

But I don't think that I should ask her to

Try and love your woman before she love another man
Try and freak your woman before she freak another man

Coz it doesn't quite seem right
You see these are the lips that kiss my kids goodnight
