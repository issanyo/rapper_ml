[Intro]
A man got to do what a man got to do
You know a man got to do what he got to do
You know what I'm saying
Been here too long
And a lady like you got to be by my side at all times
Say a man got to do what a man got to do
I got a dream baby and I got to follow my dream
You know what I'm saying
Been here too long
Check out

[Verse 1]
I pack my suitcase this morning I'm ready to move
I finally got that courage I'm leaving soon
I left a note on my pillow expressing my views
Want you to be the first to gather the news
Can't deal with them tears
It's making me blue
God knows I care as much as you do
And to be honest my baby I'm worried 'bout you
Girl I'm worried 'bout you

[Chorus]
I can't leave you until I'm certain that you'd be safe alone
And you be holding the guiding light so that I can find
My way back home
I can't leave you until I'm certain that you'd be safe alone
And you be holding the guiding light so that I can find
My way back home

[Verse 2]
You got me moving, got me grooving
Is it between you or my gold
I got my vibe and my pride keep my focus all on my stride
Need support and understanding are you with me
All the way
Need to know that you are there so I can make it
Through my days
I wanna be somebody
I wanna make people happy
And baby don't you worry
I'll be on my say I say girl

[Chorus]
I can't leave you until I'm certain that you'd be safe alone
And you be holding the guiding light so that I can find
My way back home
I can't leave you until I'm certain that you'd be safe alone
And you be holding the guiding light so that I can find
My way back home

[Verse 3]
I pack my suitcase this morning I'm ready to move
I finally got that courage I'm leaving soon
I left a note on my pillow expressing my views
Want you to be the first to gather the news
Can't deal with them tears
It's making me blue
God knows I care as much as you do
And to be honest my baby I'm worried 'bout you
Girl I'm worried 'bout you
