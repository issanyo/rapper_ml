[Chioma]
Wish I could makes thing alright
Shaggy
Change the world in one night
Gong Zilla
Wish I could fix this crazy world tonight

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
And it’s Crazy
How they rather see the whole pudding spoil
Thank to share a slice with one hungry child
Mankind so unkind
And it’s crazy
How the roughest of man create a smile
Always mad is such a sad state of mind
Mankind so unkind

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Yo
Unno nah run, them lock off di fun
So dem strap them lock down, now
Now what type of pipe them lock off the light
Bridge that light back now
Them cup overflow, nuff food inna the pot
You see just how the ting work
Unno take from the poor
Laid back pon we shore’s
Like we sponge pon nuh script work
Cause me nuh tuffy tippy toppy to them ya drunk
How we living everybody fi dem own
When dem up dem wanna kick you when your down
But true ah sinner get fi cast the first stone
Its crazy

[Chorus: Shaggy]
And it’s Crazy
How they rather see the whole pudding spoil
Than to share a slice with one hungry child
Mankind so unkind

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
And it’s crazy
How the roughest of man fraid fi smile
Always mad is such a sad state of mind
Mankind so unkind

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
And if the big bad wolf can smile and be happy
Then how some gangsta can't laugh
Sensitive badman your feelings too touchy
You always want to prove hard
Screw face nah fool scooby doo or scrappy
Ah gwan like big man and boss
Haffi run like parry and duck like Daffy
Them site the top man in charge
Gong and Shaggy we chest brawl
Sly and Robbie you done large
Nuff ah them ah gwarn like them ah di general
Them ah just corporal and Sarge
Boil them out them just sauce
Can't take mustard and card
Old G like Barry nuh beg man sorry
Cause no man nuh bigger than God

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
And it’s Crazy
How they rather see the whole pudding spoil
Than to share a slice with one hungry child
Mankind so unkind

[Chorus: Shaggy]
And it’s crazy
How the roughest of man fraid fi smile
Always mad is such a sad state of mind
Mankind so unkind

[Verse 3: Chioma]
Cos after the rain, it will be brighter
Let’s break through the chain
And we’ll leave the fame
If we could Just run away
And get through the fire
Let’s save the world tonight
Cause its just so strange to walk away
And turn our backs on the hap nots
Is there a plane and lets start changing
The way we thinking and lets get it right

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
And it’s Crazy
How they rather see the whole pudding spoil
Than to share a slice with one hungry child
Mankind so unkind

[Chorus: Shaggy]
And it’s crazy
How the roughest of man fraid fi smile
Always mad is such a sad state of mind
Mankind so unkind
