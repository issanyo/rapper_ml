Tell my friends I'm done, I'm not comin' back
Wanna fall in love, want another chance
Fortune fame and gold, yeah I got quite the life
But I'd trade it all, do anything for love, anything for love

'Cause it's all I need, all I need (6x)

Anything for love
Tell me what it costs, tell me what's the price
I wanna fall in love, want to sacrifice
It's all become so dull
And I don't wanna play anymore
'Cause the only thing I want, is anything for love

'Cause it's all I need, all I need (all I need) (6x)

Anything for love, do anything for love
Any day now, any day
Love comin', love comin' back
Oh I now it's comin'
Any day now, any day
Love comin', love comin' back
Oh I know

Everyday I wake up and all my boys...

So tell my friends I'm gone, I'm not comin' back
I wanna fall in love, I want another chance
They tell me that you don't care anymore, and I don't, no I don't don't believe them
'Cause I just can't give up, do anything for love, anything for love

'Cause it's all I need, all I need (ahh) (6x)

Anything for love, do anything for love
Anything for love
