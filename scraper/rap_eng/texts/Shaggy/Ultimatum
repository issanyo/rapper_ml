Intro: Shaggy

Ultimatum, badman nuh tek ultimatum, go wey, yuh haffi stay

Chorus: Natasha Wilkins
If I stay, would you put a end to all the games you play
Can you promise me that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today, only way I will stay
But if I go, this will be the final curtain of the show
You have lost the best thing that you ever known
Guess you have to learn to make it on your own
Let me know stay or go

Verse 1: Shaggy
Before you go let's analyze the situation
I'm a typical Jamaican why you layin your frustration on me
When we met it was a perfect combination
But you know my reputation don't know what you were expecting from me
Fight back, you canfight get things a go if yuh nuh like that
Cause I know that when you leavin you come right back
Your new founded termination sounds to me like desperation
There's no ground for termination

Chorus: Natasha Wilkins
If I stay, would you put a end to all the games you play
Can you promise me that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today, only way I will stay
But if I go, this will be the final curtain of the show
You have lost the best thing that you ever known
Guess you have to learn to make it on your own
Let me know stay or go

Verse 2: Shaggy
I must admit I have a weakness for these women
Who a plot like them a villian try the best to separate you from me
I don't understand just why the hell your cussin
When you knew that she meant nothin so what if she was your cousin
You say fight back, how the hell could I resist when she's dressed like that
Tell the truth I had to leave but she came right back
Now you heard the explanation taken to concideration it was sexual frustration

Chorus: Natasha Wilkins
If I stay, would you put a end to all the games you play
Can you promise me that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today, only way I will stay
But if I go, this will be the final curtain of the show
You have lost the best thing that you ever known
Guess you have to learn to make it on your own
Let me know stay or go
