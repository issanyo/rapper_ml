[Intro]
Uh-huh
Now this one goes out to my lady
I want me and you to go on this wonderful love rendezvous baby
Ha ha ha ha
One on one
Give you a little love escapade
You know what I'm saying?
Mr. Lover

[Verse 1]
Candlelight, dinner for two
Just me and you
Under the moon
Sailing on a summer night cruise
I'm here to rock your whole world baby
I'm da man allowed to drive you crazy
Set the motion to the ocean
'Cause some commotion
Girl surrender to my love potion
I'll hit you off now with some hot oil lotion
I play it safe so let me break out my Trojan

[Chorus]
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, lady
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, lady

[Verse 2]
Now let me plan a day real fine
Hot tub, jacuzzi, caviar with some white wine
That's right, I'm livin' millionaire style
Mansion in the hills and not another house for miles
Now let me take you and show off my pet reptile
Intruders I'm gonna feed it to my rottweiler
No interruptions today
Leave it to me and have things my way

[Chorus]
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, lady
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, lady

[Bridge]
'Cause I like the way you do the things you do
I wanna make sweet love to you
'Cause I like the way you do the things you do
I wanna make sweet love to you

[Verse 3]
I wanna send chills up your spine
I let you feel good inside
And explode just like a land mine
I'm here to conquer and thrill and that's my mission
Love-making with timing and precision
My skills is kickin'
An' like breakin'
Proper lovin', leave you humming
Sweet melodies of future come
Prepare to get soaked in sweat, yeah, girl
'Cuz you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Chorus]
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, lady
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, lady
