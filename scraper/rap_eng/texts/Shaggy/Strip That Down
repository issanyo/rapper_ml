[Intro: FACU Coronel]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Liam Payne con Facundo Coronel
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, This Is The Remix!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Liam Payne & FACU Coronel]
You know I've been taking some time
And I've been keeping to myself (self)
I had my eyes up on the prize
Ain't watching anybody else
But your love, it hit me hard, girl
Yeah, you're bad for my health
I love the cards that I've been dealt
Do you feel the same as well?

Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne & FACU Coronel]
You know I used to be in 1D (now I'm out, free)
People want me for one thing (that's not me)
I'm not changing the way that I (used to be)
I just wanna have fun and (get rowdy)
One Coke and Bacardi (sippin' lightly)
When I walk inside the party (girls on me)
F1 type Ferrari (6 gear speed)
Girl, I love it when your body (grinds on me)
Oh yeah

Chorus: Liam Payne & FACU Coronel]
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby (swing)
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Post-Chorus: Liam Payne & FACU Coronel
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love when you hit the ground, girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love, when you hit the ground

[Verse 2: FACU Coronel & Liam Payne]
You know that since the day I met you
Yeah, you swept me off my feet
You know that I don't need no money
When your love is beside me
Yeah, you opened up my heart
And then you threw away the key
Girl, now it's just you and me
And you don't care 'bout where I've been

[Pre-Chorus: FACU Coronel & Liam Payne]
You know I used to be in 1D (now I'm out, free)
People want me for one thing (that's not me)
I'm not changing the way that I (used to be)
I just wanna have fun (and get rowdy) (ooh)
One Coke and Bacardi (sippin' lightly)
When I walk inside the party (girls on me)
F1 type Ferrari (6 gear speed)
Girl, I love it when your body (grinds on me)
Ooh

[Chorus: FACU Coronel & Liam Payne]
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby (yeah)
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Post-Chorus: Liam Payne & FACU Coronel
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love when you hit the ground, girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (strip that down)
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love, when you hit the ground (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love when you hit the ground, girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (yeah)
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love, when you hit the ground (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (oh
Quavo)


[Chorus: Liam Payne & FACU Coronel]
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Liam Payne & FACU Coronel]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, c'mon, strip that down for me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Ayy)
Don't say nothing, girl, strip that down for me (strip it down)

All I want, girl, if you strip that down for me (strip it down)

You're the one, girl, c'mon, strip that down for me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
