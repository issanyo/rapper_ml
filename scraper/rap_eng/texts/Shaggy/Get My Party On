Ya-ya man, I just got my hair braided, car waxed, put on my player face
It's 12 o'clock, it's time to get it on, hey yo chaka

Midnight to fair I'm seemin, squeemin, armed with the franklins wheelin, dealin
Got a damsel I'm peepin, not for the keepin ah oh, pagers beepin
When I'm out there seekin, creepin, chicken heads weaken your girl I be freakin
Since your man, he be sleepin, girl stop your weepin, later we be raisin the ceilin

Oh-oh-oh, I get my party on (party on) until the early morn (early morn)
I get my party on (yo), we gonna party til the break of dawn

Mommy with the thick thighs, curvy on the hips, gotta broad tongue type
Baby you the shhhh, here to give a good time
Pickin up your corsage later in the pulmaride, your the player's pick
Rollin with the big dogs, hangin with my clique
Punk you betta think twice, you don't wanna trip, put away your pistols
Sip up on this crystal, catch up on the in style, watch em hunnies there

Oh-oh-oh, I get my party on (party on) until the early morn (early morn)
I get my party on (yo), we gonna party til the break of dawn

Hot chicks and fish net stockins, fake breast and tummy tuckin
Low rider jeans are rockin, know who the dudes be cockin, hot cars and roads be block n
We ball so girls be flockin, a lot a cherries poppin
Upstairs where boots be knockin

Oh-oh-oh, I get my party on (party on) until the early morn (early morn)
I get my party on (yo), we gonna party til the break of dawn

So come on and party with me, ain't no better place you could be
When we come, stop the party, can't nobody do it like me
So come on and party with me, ain't no better place you could be
Loosen up and set yourself free, take a chance right here, you'll see

Midnight to fair I'm seemin, squeemin, armed with the franklins wheelin, dealin
Got a damsel I'm peepin, not for the keepin ah oh, pagers beepin
When I'm out there seekin, creepin, chicken heads weaken your girl I be freakin
Since your man, he be sleepin, girl stop your weepin, later we be raisin the ceilin

Oh-oh-oh, I get my party on (party on) until the early morn (early morn)
I get my party on (yo), we gonna party til the break of dawn

Oh-oh-oh, I get my party on (party on) until the early morn (early morn)
I get my party on (yo), we gonna party til the break of dawn
