Uh, wow, uh, hm, ya, SHAGGY!
Uh, yeah

This one goes out to all my women
My strong women
Uh

So amazing how this world was made
I wonder if God is a woman
The gift of life astounds me to this day
I give it up for the woman
She's the constant wind that fills my sails
Oh, that woman
With a smile and a style
She'll protect you like a child
That's a woman

Chorus:
She'll put a smile upon your face
And take you to that higher place
So don't you underestimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman

Woke up this morning
Got up with the scent of a woman
So picture if you would what life would be
... ain't much good without a woman

She can nag and be a constant pain
Oh, that woman
But those hips
She's got me whipped
And it's just too hard to resist
What a woman

Chorus:
She'll put a smile upon your face
And take you to a higher place
So don't you underestimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman

Tender lips that's so so sweet
Gentle words she softly speaks
Such an angel when we meet
God bless the ground beneath her feet
She can take you on a high
Be your comfort when you cry
But if you look into her eyes you'll see
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman

Chorus:
She'll put a smile upon your face
And take you to a higher place
So don't you underestimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman
