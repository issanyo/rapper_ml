Hook:
Still counting up all the blues
Old friends and they never new
Undefeated we don't ever lose
God damn yeah i got the juice

Still counting up all the blues
Old friends and they never new
Undefeated we don't ever lose
God damn yeah i got the juice

Verse:
Life is just a mix of good and bad
Where i'm from a hundred get you a half
Still winning, still bad at math
Plug still on the block with variety packs

Last year was a cold summer
Blacked out till we seen the sun up
Riding around in a 4 Runner
My only advice is you don't run up

Independent fuck a label too
We go wherever the money move
We been out the building that's old news
Back in the day used to skip school

Still the best, never take tests
All this shit don't make sense
Fuck you and your presidents
When I die im gonna visit dead friends

Still counting up all the [beep]
[Voicemail] "Hello, you no-good, dirty... give me a call"

"You were supposed to check out today by 11... um, we're looking for ya"

Still counting up all the blues

Old friends and they never new

Undefeated we don't ever lose

Independent fuck a label too

God damn yeah i got the juice

There's no need to find us, we looking for you
There's no need to find us, we looking for you
There's no need to find us, we looking for you
Um, we're looking for ya
