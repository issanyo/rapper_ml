Now this one goes out to the father
For shower of good blessings
Right now I gotta give thanks
And praise most I

[Chorus]
[KY-MANI]
Thank you Lord for what you've done for me
[SHAGGY]
To the Father I say
[KY-MANI]
Thank you Lord for what you're doing now
[SHAGGY]
I go down on my knees and pray
[KY-MANI]
Thank you Lord for every little thing yeah
Thank you Lord for now you made me see
Sing along, sing along
[SHAGGY]
Now when I look back in the days of all the sweat and
All the dues I paid
I go down on my knees and pray
And give thanks to the Father for the blessings that he shined on me
I sing a little song of praise
Though I know that everybody ain't as fortunate as I may be
One more time I say
Words cannot express appreciation what he's done for me
Right now I say thank you Lord

[Chorus]
[SHAGGY]
When I look back at all the things that the Father has done for me
I give thanks to the Lord and everyday i'm on my knee
Write the song now to please
No matter the color nor the creed
It was invested in me I'm here to do a good deed hey
I try to put a smile on your face
I write a simple song so it appeals to your taste
I tried to do the things that people appreciate
Well thanks for the music that they all embrace
And I say thank you Lord

[Chorus]
[KY-MANI]
Say I'm in no competion
But I have made my decision
You can keep your opinion
I am just a calling on the wise man communion

[Chorus]
[SHAGGY]
I thank the Lord once again for the power of the pen
Yes I be making ends to feed my family and my friends
Push out my Benz check your lens
Beg you ease up off my fence
Mi afi push out my mother in the latest gems
I have to put the food upon mi table
Have to feed the little mouth them in my stable
Hail up to the Big Yard label
And me say thank you Massa God that I am able
Give thanks to the Lord

[Chorus]
[KY-MANI]
Said I want to thank you
Shaggy want to thank you now
Said the people got to thank you
