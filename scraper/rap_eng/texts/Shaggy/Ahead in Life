Shaggy:
Uh it wasn't me...

Woman calling Shaggy:
I bet it wasn't it was your third leg, in between the other two

Shaggy:
Alright Woody, you and me we neeed to have a talk
Cause your always gettin me in trouble right now this, this ain't funny

Verse 1: Shaggy
Why is it you always gotta be standin up
Or rub a dub, your like what's up
Have woman kissin on your head and stuff
Why is it you never ever seem to have enough
Why can't you ever go to bed and just chill?
Actin all ill, showin off your skill
Always tryin to make me go against my will
Why is it you always up in someone's grill

Background Singers:
That playboy shit you did yesterday
Won't you know I got busted anyway
You went home and didn't feel her cat
What kind of dumb shit is that?

Chorus: Shaggy
All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life
To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, oooh
All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life
To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, oooh

Verse 2: Shaggy
Why you always gotta be the one to take the lead
You wanna plant a seed, good thing I wore a shield
You think without a brain you seem to like can't even read
So why you think you have the right to tell me what I need
Now I'm tryin to talk to you you hold your head in shame
You sorry that you came, you think this is a game
It seems to me that I'm the one that's always bein framed
Cause everything you do guess who's the one to get the blame

Background Singers:
That playboy shit you did yesterday
Won't you know I got busted anyway
You went home and didn't feel her cat
What kind of dumb shit is that?

Chorus: Shaggy
All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life
To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, oooh
All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life
To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, oooh

Bridge: Woman calling Shaggy
You banged my friend, you pissed me off, you banged my friend, you boned
All fuzzy, cheap punk, hello.....hello....you make me sick

Chorus: Shaggy
All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life
To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, oooh
All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life
To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, oooh
All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life
To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, oooh
All I really wanted to do, was to get ahead in life
To get ahead in life, that's all I really wanted to do, oooh
