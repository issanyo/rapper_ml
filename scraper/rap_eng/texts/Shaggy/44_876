[Intro: Shaggy, Aidonia]
Straight from jamdung to London
Ragga muffin weh wi say (Hey)
Style a style an a pattan a pattan
Didi donia (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shaggy and Sting ina combination

[Verse 1: Shaggy, Sting]
Wake up to sunshine in di morning
What a beautiful feeling
Me hear the birds them singing
Way up ina the tree limb
Me get a call from the Englishman, say him wan come hold a vibes?
Him wan run left the cold fi ketch some island life
4-4 to 8-7-6, at the drop of a dime
Link up anytime
4-4 to 8-7-6, call the airline
Fly out anytime
I'm trying to free my mind, and live a life stress free
But the politics of this country are getting to me
I have a dream that I'm swimming in the Caribbean Sea
And then my good friend Shaggy says
"Come spend some time, family"

[Pre-Chorus: Sting]
I hear reggae music, that's playing in the street
With maximum bass at all frequencies
It shakes me to my soul with a positive vibration
I start dreaming of Jamaica and the Caribbean nation

[Chorus: All]
4-4 to 8-7-6
4-4 to 8-7-6

[Verse 2: Aidonia]
Yow
From the 4-4 go a 8-7-6 dat a Kingston town go a London
Big up di UK man dem-bam-bam-bam-bam
Welcome to Jamrock sand
Fly come a yard fi di island breeze
Pretty girl walk 'pon di white sand beach
Try please stay so a rice and peace
8-7-6 put yuh mind at ease

[Pre-Chorus: Sting]
I hear reggae music, it carries me away
And the ghost of Bob Marley, that haunts me to this day
There's a spiritual truth in the words of his song
And the Caribbean nation to which they belong

[Chorus: All]
4-4 to 8-7-6 (Oh)
4-4 to 8-7-6
4-4 to 8-7-6
4-4 to 8-7-6

[Outro: Shaggy, Aidonia, Sting]
From di UK
To the shores of Kingston a so it go (Rockers)
Didi donia (Yeah, Shaggy)
Yeah, Sting (yeah, hey)
