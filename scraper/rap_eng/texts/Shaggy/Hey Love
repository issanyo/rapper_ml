[Chorus]
Hey love, can I get a rain check?
Just 25 and I'm not ready yet
Hey love, let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love, got more grounds to gain
Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain
Hey love, I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

[Verse 1]
I remember as a kid I used to dream
I had a big crush on Sandra's kid sister Jean
But she was in love with Dwayne
It's been so many years but I still feel the pain
What about the girl across the street?
Took the same bus, I used to reserve her seat
But she would just sit with her friends
And the all talk about guys in Beemers and Benz
Seem like my luck took a slide
Then shorty came along and stood by my side
I couldn't give her much but she stayed
Now I'm hitting all the charts it's so easy getting laid
Living in style, I'm getting paid
Hooking up my peeps with the millions I've made
Now I'm having girls who I knew in first grade
Now I'm kinda feeling like my shorty getting played
So I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Hey love, can I get a rain check?
Just 25 and I'm not ready yet
Hey love, let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love, got more grounds to gain
Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain
Hey love, I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

[Verse 2]
I wasn't popular in school, I wasn't popular in sports
All the girls I love loved the guys on the court
I feel like I been cheated of my youth
'Cause back in the days braces weren't so cute
Girls used to laugh at my suit
Now I got models in bed knocking boots, so

[Chorus]
Hey love, can I get a rain check?
Just 25 and I'm not ready yet
Hey love, let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love, got more grounds to gain
Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain
Hey love, I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

[Verse 3]
I remember as a kid I used to dream
I had a big crush on Sandra's kid sister Jean
But she was in love with Dwayne
It's been so many years but I still feel the pain
What about the girl across the street?
Took the same bus, I used to reserve her seat
But she would just sit with her friends
And the all talk about guys in Beemers and Benz

Now I'm hitting all the charts it's so easy getting laid

Now I'm having girls who I knew in first grade
Now I'm kinda feeling like my shorty getting played
So I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Hey love, can I get a rain check?
Just 25 and I'm not ready yet
Hey love, let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love, got more grounds to gain

Hey love, I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more
