Went to number one and now she kicked up a storm
Who big her up now me and Robert and Shaun
Whole heap of entertainer come come step pan me corn
Now she was a top ten lady from the time she was born
But she went and played me now my love is gone

Whole heap of entertainer come and step pan me corn
Now she was a top ten lady from the time she was born
But she went and played me now my love is gone
Oh I got my new lady and she's got it going on
And on and on and on and on and on and on
