SHAGGY: In the Summertime

It's a summertime affair
Shaggy ha
Ravyon
Sun and fun in the
Atmosphere, oh yes
In the summertime when
The weather is high
You can stretch right up
And touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women
You've got women
On your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride and
See now what I can find

Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Weh me say
Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee
Shaggy say
Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as honey
Sting like bumble bee

(Rap:)
It's a summertime affair
In the atmosphere
I man love off her attire
And the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tyre
And a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up
Not a sign of snare
Got to be rolling in my
Christas so the girl them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon
As your ultimate pair
Taking care of our career
So tell the world beware
'Cause it's a brand new
Selection for your musical ear

We say what we want and
We say what we need
And we love everybody
And we do as we please
And when the weather is fine
We go fishin' we
Go fishin' in the sea
We are happy to live life
That's our philosophy

Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Sweat a run off her body
With her caramel skin
I man smiled at her she
Looked at me and grinned
I offered her a drink she said
Juice and Gin
And I whispered in her ear
I asked how you doin
Where was it that I reside
And I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance
Her eyes sparkling
Just her voice and what
She said let my poor head spin
Raggamuffin Shaggy
With a musical swing

I say
Pretty little woman
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee
In the summertime
When the weather is high
You can stretch right up
And touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women
You've got women
On your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride
And see what I can find

Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee
Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as honey
Sting like bumble bee

Repeat rap

In the summertime
In the summertime
