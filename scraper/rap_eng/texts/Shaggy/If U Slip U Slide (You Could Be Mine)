[Hook: Melissa Musique]
You could be mine for the rest of my life
And I wouldn’t mind , I wouldn’t mind
And I could be yours
For the rest of your life
I know that you wouldn’t mind
Hey baby!
You wouldn’t mind

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Girl I need your love
Yuh know weh fi do girl fi hold me
So I can’t lose that touch
Been around the world
Still nothing compare to the glue

Cya go round yuh no love
Cause she’ll never quit

Come from the love inside
So let’s unite
Cause she’ll never quit
She’s commited to this
She’ll never put no one above
