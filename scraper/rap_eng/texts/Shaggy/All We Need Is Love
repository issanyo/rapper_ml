Sometimes i wonder what the future holds
From the way it looks it's like we don't have much control
Better comfortations the only other day
Never tought that we would end up living life this way

All we need is love
All we need is love

Where there is life there should be love
If there is hope there it should be love
We don't need anger we're stronger togheter
Where there is life there should be love
We can do better yes each one of us
My sisters and brothers love is the answer

What about the children think about their needs
We can make a different if we only just belived
No it won't be easey still it works we try
It's a revolution and it starts with you and i

All we need is love
All we need is love

Where there is life there should be love
If there is hope there it should be love
We don't need anger we're stronger togheter
Where there is life there should be love
We can do better yes each one of us
My sisters and brothers love is the answer

But all we need is love
Heey all we need is love

All we need is love
All we need is love

Where there is life there should be love
If there is hope there it should be love
We don't need anger we're stronger togheter
Where there is life there should be love
We can do better yes each one of us
My sisters and brothers love is the answer
