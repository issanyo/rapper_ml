[Intro]
Uh, that's right
Reality check
You know what I mean
Street life's eh
Scorpion, yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
When I was young
I use to dream of being rich
Have a lot of houses and cars
Couldn't know which one was which
And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
You think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow
There was a treasure chest
Sometimes having more is really less
So take a look inside yourself
You'll realize you're really blessed
No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone who has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay your dues
So don't worry just push on through

[Chorus]
Keep'n it real
Gotta GIG up all my peoples who be working on the future
Even though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

[Verse 2]
I never got to have myself the house, the mansion, and the Benz
I'm not the type of brother who be making mad ends
I got myself a girl but we be kickin' it as friends
Is not enough for me now that depends
Again, not everything you want is everything you really need
The standard of society is motivated by greed
Are you prepared to follow
Tell me are you prepared to lead
So persevere and you'll succeed

[Chorus]
Keep'n it real
Gotta GIG up all my peoples who be working on the future
Even though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

[Bridge]
All the harsh realities
Appears to come in twos and threes
Don't worry 'cause
There'll be a better day
One thing I can promise you
Just keep on keeping on
I swear to you
There's gonna be a brighter day

[Verse 3]
Back in the days
I used to dream of being rich
Have a lot of houses and cars
Couldn't know which one was which
And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
You think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow there was a treasure chest
Sometimes having more is really less
So take a look inside yourself
You'll realize you're really blessed
No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone who has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay your dues
So don't worry just push on through

[Chorus]
Keep'n it real
Gotta GIG up all my peoples who be working on the future
Even though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

[Outro]
That's right, see me, yeah
Give thanks for what you have, ya know
And when you think that its bad
There's always somebody that's worse
Know what I'm sayin'
Good job listenin' to me
Wa-wa, wa-wa
Wa-wa, wa-wa
Funky
