[Chorus]
Bow wow wow yippie yo, yippie yay

Don't call me name if you not down inna mi shoes
Gal a call man dog

Don't call me name if you not down inna mi shoes

[Verse 1]
Call me human, rather call me animal
Brother one pit-bull, mi sister one doberman
Have three little pup and them a Alsatian
Have a Chiuwawa too but be a peregrin pal
Have mi French poodle, she a mi woman
And of course Shagsman, the doberman, the handsome one
Maybe niam off your foot, da, da, da, niam off your arm
Tear at your head if you now trouble I man
Say wa

[Bridge]
Motion, gal me inna the motion, Lord
Rub down your body with lotion
Inna the motion, gal inna the motion, mmm, naw
Rub down your body with lotion

[Verse 2]
Me have mi beer-drinking pal called Sport McKenzy(BOO)
The shoe-maker friend, the one them call bosh puppy
When it come to fight him a just hang on for we
Little but him tall a what I tell mi brethrin Scrappy
And the coward is one a the uncle Scooby, yow
Who the leader fi the posse, I and I man Shaggy
Rough did one time, me never want that ready
And true ready him a pusshound with a private pussy
Rin-Tin-Tin-Tin and him a police-pecky
And the one named Lassie breathe fi Sport McKenzy
Should I breathe fi Shaggy
Get a little pedigree
Take it from the number one, the youth named Shaggy
I say

[Chorus]
Bow wow wow yippie yo, yippie yay
Bow wow yippie yo, yippie yay, woof
Bow wow wow yippie yo, yippie yay

Read how bought the beagle, the one we named dog
Who attack but me come fi come abuse a line
Now me fi have used the line, now the line weh me bind
Bad to sit down at the line and park the car
Watch you have some line, Jah know me have fi stand
Now you fi use pesticide from dusk till dawn
On the way fi make the grass stamp a them ground

Rub it down the suntan lotion

The shoe-maker friend, the one them call bosh puppy
When it come to fight him a just hang on for we
Little but him tall a what I tell mi brethrin Scrappy
And the coward is one a the uncle Scooby, yes
The leader fi the posse, I and I man Shaggy
Rough did one time, never want that ready
True ready him a pusshound with no private pussy
Rin-Tin-Tin-Tin and him a police-pecky
And the one named Lassy breathe fi Sport McKenzy
Should I breathe fi Shaggy
Get a little pedigree
Take it from the number one, the youth named Shaggy
