[Intro]
Welcome to the mission
My music has got to get what it rightfully deserve
Shaggy

[Chorus]
My music got me on a mission
I'm following my intuition
Why don't you check the composition
With this ya music when it hit you
Say you feel no pain
My music got me on a mission
I'm following my intuition
Why don't you check the composition
With this ya music when it hits you

[Verse 1]
My music is my mission
I'm here to take it around the world
To get the global recognition that we fully deserve
To every man, every woman, little boys, little girls
Embrace the sweet reggae culture
There's a lot more to learn
You could a be from the east
Could a be from the west
Could a be from the north
So could a be from the south
No matter where down in a the world
Shaggy will be at your doorstep
Pan you cassette down in a you deck
No bother think about eject
Better yet
How about you get it live and direct
Say mic check (mic check)
No sabotage mi sound check
You better let a lyrical genius
Come try intercept
Shaggy a say one more time

[Chorus]

Why don't you check the composition
With this ya music when it hits you

[Verse 2]

Everywhere down in a the world

Some of them no speak the language
But the lyrics them chant
Excess amount of music weh the DJ perform

Straight up in a de place a where the people congregate
