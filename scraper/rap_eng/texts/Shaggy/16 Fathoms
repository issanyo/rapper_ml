16 fathoms down
Where my ship is bound
Another drop in the ocean
16 fathoms down

She said, “Sailor man, believe me
I stand on solid ground
You say your plan is to leave me
And sail out from this town

You know prophecy runs in my family
I know where your ship is bound
One day you’re going to find yourself
16 fathoms down.”

16 fathoms down
Where my soul is bound
Another drop in the ocean
16 fathoms down

I didn’t pay no mind to her
I just turned around
My ship lies out in the harbor
I sail out from this town

My thoughts become uneasy
Her words keep turning ‘round
I pray that I won’t find myself
16 fathoms down

16 fathoms down
Where my soul is bound
Another drop in the ocean
16 fathoms down

Girl, it nuh matter weh yuh do and it nuh matter weh say
Yuh try break mi but it nuh work today
It nuh matter weh u do and it nuh matter weh yuh say
Mi wear di crown and yuh caan teck it weh
Yuh think mi was a loser but mi tell yuh say wrong
A nuff woman a road dem waan mi fi be dem man
Positivity surround mi
Mi nuh waan nutten negative round mi

[Sting]
A storm will rage inside me
As I sail out on the sound
I pray to God this darkness pass
I pray that I won’t drown

Now the sails are blown to bloody rags
The mizzen mast come down
The prophecy has doomed me
16 fathoms down

Of course, God come to find me
In the place where the ship went down
The prophecy will bind me
And that’s where I’ll be drowned

16 fathoms down
Where my ship is bound
Another drop in the ocean
16 fathoms down
