I'll be there for you
Oh baby, I'll be there
No matter how far away, yeah
I'll be there

Verse 1:
Eye's wide to ceiling
Suddenly I awake from day dreaming
Find myself overwhelmed by this feeling, tried to kneel in, search for spiritual healing, yo
No when they look for where you come from
No money, no future, no function
Everywhere that I look another last one, with a mask on
Every youth is a man's man, yo
I give a kiss to my girlfriend
Now i got to do right by the same thing
'Cause of her that they need a few good men
Dry your tears friend
I'll be back just dont know when

Chorus:
If you wait for me, just you wait and see
I'll be there, I'll be there
And if you pray for me, darling wait and see
I'll be there, I'll be there

Verse 2:
I found a perfect opportunity
Don't you think I came to this decision easily
Everyday away from you is an eternity
Wish that I could be there to witness your maternity, yo
I didn't plan on staying so long
Through the fear i need to stay strong
Through the left and the right we hear the same song
Hope I ain't drunk
Tryin' to get my paper chase on, yo
At times I find myself in danger
In the process I became a stanger
Now I find that I'm living in the age of, something major
And my life is what they wage ya
Yo

Chorus:
If you wait for me, just you wait and see
I'll be there, I'll be there
And if you pray for me, darling wait and see
I'll be there, I'll be there

Verse 3:
From awakin' in my car I can feel it, best believe it
Everyday I try to find a way to leave it
There's so much on my plate now to deal with
Young minds on this place will find a way to relieve it
Now the souls are the victims of surroundings
What we do to survive is just astounding
Parl shamed by the circumstance fo founding get to crowning
Ain't no other opportunities

Chorus:
If you wait for me, just you wait and see
I'll be there, I'll be there
And if you pray for me, darling wait and see
I'll be there, I'll be there
