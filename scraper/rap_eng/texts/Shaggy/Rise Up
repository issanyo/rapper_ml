Hey hey hey hey

Hopes are lasting higher, higher, let nothing cave away
The expectation of a nation's like music to the ear
Oooooo we're singing a brand new song
Marching to a brand new beat
Down the inside, through the palace, filling every street

[Chorus]
It's time to rise up
Stand and take your place (rise up)
Shine like the sun (rise up rise up)
Your journey has just begun
Rise up (rise up)
Stand like the brave (oh yeah)
Rule your destiny
Be the best that you can be

[Shaggy]
Well well well well now we start from the bottom and we reach the top of the toppa
No matter where we go you know so nothin can stoppa
We stand up and salute now to the yellowa the green and blacka
I'll make you know so [?]

[Ziggy Marley]
The world is for your taking
Giving up is your only crime
I've written all the pages of history
This is your moment this is your time, yeah
Now we know, it's not an easy role

3'O clock, another road block (you gotta carry it alone)

[Chorus]
Rise up (get up!)
Stand and take your place
Shine like the sun (you are just like the sun, you are just like the sun!)
Your journey has just begun
Rise up
Stand like the brave (like the brave!)
Rule your destiny
Be the best that you can be (you can be)

Triumph!

[Bridge]
There's a winner, inside you
Just waiting to answer the call
(Answer the call, I said answer the call)

You heard the voice (now make your choice)
Now make the choice
You've got to follow and start believing for you now

[Chorus]
Rise up
Stand and take your place
Shine like the sun
Your journey has just begun
Rise up
Stand like the brave
Rule your destiny
Be the best that you can be

[Diana King]
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Di boy dem in a di party party party
Mercy mercy mercy
Di boy dem in a di party party party

[Ziggy Marley]
Here comes the black and the green and the gold
Control, control
Giving every ting we got
Heart, heart, heart

[Buju Banton]
[?]
I still feel we been drained of success
Therefore my bredrins we got to do our best
Whether north, south, east or west

[Chorus]
Rise up
Stand and take your place
Shine like the sun
Your journey has just begun
Rise up
Stand like the brave (higher and higher)
Rule your destiny
Be the best that you can be
Rise up
