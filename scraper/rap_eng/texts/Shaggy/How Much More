[Verse 1]
Now every day another youth hitch up in a gutter, mmm
Now I man talk and I man stutter
Can't understand say you fi try and help the youth them make them get big, what

Say how much more ghetto youth have fi suffer
How much more live without bread and butter
How much more body we a go discover
Have fi live together every brother and we sister
Stop suffer

[Verse 2]
Me say
Mm, Jah pan the land a so we live a so we die
Can't find the answer to the question why
Me say the sky is the limit so you try touch the sky
Put your trust in the God now Jah rasta for I...selasi
...Hear how me cry and give me a bly
Never trouble you so why you want shoot the i
Too much wicked man deh 'bout ya oh me oh my
Now feel it inna me heart when a siren a cry

Mama say you brut you living like a coot

Bad company make the i take the wrong route
Now you de behind the bar in a crisp stripe suit
And everyday another man a try pick your fruit
Now them have you pan them nosel like a brand new recruit

[Chorus]
How much more ghetto youth have fi suffer
How much more live without bread and butter

[Verse 4]
Like a butter pon a piece of hot bread
A so your blood run when a shot lick your head
Don't you think it's better living than it is to be dead
And in the Bible it is written and so it should be said
Thou shall not kill neither blood must shed
And yet still you wouldn't mind full me up the lead
And tell me if your conscience no burn you when you go a bed
And now you can't sleep you de a think 'bout the dead

[Chorus]
How much more ghetto youth have fi suffer
How much more live without bread and butter
How much more body we a go discover
Have fi live together every brother and we sister
Stop suffer

[Verse 5]
Life it rough inna the ghetto
Everyday me neighborhood a run like soweto
Over the badness is like you no let go
The other day them shot me bredrin in front of esso
Take away him wallet with about twenty peso
After them shot him them dump him over there so
And all me a warn is like me never say so

[Chorus]
How much more ghetto youth have fi suffer
How much more live without bread and butter
How much more body we a go discover
Have fi live together every brother and we sister
Stop suffer

[Verse 6]
