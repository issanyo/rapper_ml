[Intro]
What are you talking about such lustful behavior?
Make sure that you're loyal to your wife
Shaggy again, oh gosh

[Chorus]
I said I love you girl, you know you want me
You kiss and caress me, hug me up girl

Love me girl, you know you want me
So kiss and caress me, love me up girl
That's why me bawl out lust

Watch out fi lust

And sometimes vigorous

Ring pon her finger, it make her him wife
Him don't coming late, him coming early at night
