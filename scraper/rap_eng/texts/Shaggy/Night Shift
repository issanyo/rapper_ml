[Intro Shaggy]
Now we're working on the night shift
Baby when you see me I don't care I'll  fight it
Mama [?] I like it

[Sting]
I’ll have to work another night shift
I won’t be coming home tonight
You don’t have to worry where the time slips
Only by the night I come to life

Working weekends and the weekday
Working in the darkest of the hours
I’ll take the bus, I’ll take the subway
Whatever gets me to my destination

Fast forward the eventide, it’s Friday night
And I’ve only got to work until the day
I’ve got a message to send back home
Saying that I’ll be working in the nighttime, hey

I’ll have to work another night shift
No chance of coming home at all
3 o’clock has always been a sweet spot
That’s what they call the witching hour

Fast forward the eventide, it’s Friday night
And I’ve only got to work until the day
I’ve got a message to send back home
Saying, Mama, I just had to be away

Fast forward the eventide, it’s Friday night
And I’ve only got to work until the day
I’ve got a message to send back home
Saying, Mama, sorry I had to leave
Mama, sorry I had to leave

[Shaggy]
So babygirl, I got to leave
Mek sure go straight to your bed nuh badda wait up fi me
Not getting a break until ‘bout quarter to 3
Before me reach home is the sun you gwain see

So tonight, you gonna sleep alone
Cause if you're lookin’ for me in the middle ah night I won't be home
Don't badda send no text, don't try fi call me pon di phone
Working late inna di office mi nuh deh out a street a roam, LORD!

Fast forward the eventide, it’s Friday night
And I’ve only got to work until the day
I’ve got a message to send back home
Saying, Mama, sorry I had to leave
Mama, sorry I had to leave…
