[Intro: Shaggy (Joe)]
All the ghettos around the world, dig this
Ghetto, Fabulous, Joe
Shaggy!
(All the children sing)

[The Boys Choir of Harlem]
I'm a ghetto child
I'm a ghetto child

[Verse 1: Joe]
Check it out
There's a world out there that I wanna see
There's a man that I'm destined to be
I won't be stopped by the ghetto streets
I believe inside that I can't be beat
This life could be a ball and chain
If you let yourself get caught in the game
I had some friends sold drugs for dough
But I don't intend to go down that road

[Chorus: The Boys Choir of Harlem]
Just because I'm a ghetto child
I won't live down to your expectations
Just believe that a ghetto child
Can rise in the highest celebration
Know that I am a ghetto child
But I can see the best in me, can you?
I'm a ghetto child

[Verse 2: Joe (Shaggy)]
(All the ghettos around the world, dig this)
One day I'm gonna change the world
Make a better place for every boy and girl
Everyone in need, homeless families
Have a place to sleep and food to eat
I'll take every gun off the streets
So another tear won't be shed in grief
And every thug in every hood
I will make 'em change from bad to good

[Pre-Chorus: Joe (The Boys Choir of Harlem)]
I believe that it can be done
Gotta start somewhere and I'm that one
All the children sing (yeah, yeah)
All the children sing (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Joe (Shaggy)]
(Hey, yo
Look at me in a different light
Spare me all about those stereotypes)

Ain't no madness that'll bring me down
Gonna take this life and turn it around

(The sky's the limit, I won't be denied
Ain't no stoppin' me, I'm a ghetto child)

And at the end, when it's said and done
We will all be singin' this ghetto song

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus x3]

[Outro]
It's not where you're from
It's where you're gonna be
It's not where you're from
It's where you're gonna be
