I searched for you
Down under the sun
I screamed for you
Down under the sun
Can you hear me
Down under the sun (can you hear me)
I grew up in the world a citizen a friend and a girl
Watching greed surpassing giving
Everyone consumed with their own living
If money could talk they'd ask us all to share what we've got
'Cause I can't seem to find equality in the human kind
I searched for you
Down under the sun
I screamed for you
Down under the sun
Can you hear me
Down under the sun (can you hear me)
They say in love and war you can justify and ignore
Your disabilities contradictionary strengths and sins
But it seems to me that warring is what we believe
No wonder if all we do is fight
That true love is so so hard to find
I searched for you
Down under the sun
I screamed for you
Down under the sun
Can you hear me
Down under the sun (under the sun, you know) (can you hear me)
Hot
First of all I add you to my agenda you're my primetime
When the moon hit the stars at the skyline (right)
Isn't hard to recognize the right sign (aha)
Seem below perfection now you're all mine
As the sun meets the sea in the evening
You and I can consummate our feelings
You touch me with your therapeutic healing
Well baby let us emphasize
Every time we fantasize
Bottom line you are a prize
Such a different rule applies
Love the flex
Need the sex
Never know what's coming next
Baby girl now light the ride
Love it when our hearts collide
Be together can't divide
Everybody put aside
Pull up, pull up
Pu-pull up, pull up
It's Ida Corr
She givin' you some more
It's Mr. Lover (Mr Lover)
I searched for you
Down under the sun
I screamed for you

I searched for you (got it started)
Down under the sun (Jamaican sun)

Down under the sun (can you hear me) (woohoo!) (Shaggy)
I searched for you
Down under the sun (uh uh)
