And if I don't tell you, as much as I want to
Girl, my love for you is so strong
So come get some love, I've got so much for you
Girl, my love could do you no wrong

So strong, so strong

[Verse 1]
Girl, any time that you need me, call
Even if a middle a the night
Woman, you are the yin to me yang
Touch the road, so we fly
We both then take flight
No other girl can drift inna your lane
Eveyting inna we make sure we did right
Give you all a me loving sincerely
Just make sure we keep the thing tight

[Hook]
Well, I might not be there, as much as I want to
Girl, my love for you is so strong (right)

Girl, my love could do you no wrong
Look what you do to me, you got me singing sweet songs

[Hook]
And if I don't tell you, as much as I want to
Girl, my love for you is so strong
So come get some love, I've got so much for you

[Outro]
A day without the shining sun
Is a day without your loving, baby
One look and we feel as one
'Cause that's how easy we communicate
No heart's got to find guarantee
Girl, your love can depend on me
If love, could sign a dotted line
You would surely see your name next to mine
And you would surely see your name next to mine
You would surely see your name next to mine
