I was a boy, I was dreaming of the U.S.A.,
All the movies I see are from the same place
All the music I love is from the U.S.A.,
All the stars that I see have an American face

The only blue jeans I wear are from the U.S.A.,
The sneakers here on my feet, they are American made
Presley, Monroe and Dean are from the U.S.A.,
Louis Armstrong, Sinatra and Marvin Gaye

[Sting & Shaggy]
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the United States

[Shaggy]
You seek a visa, you’re dreaming of the U.S.A.,
It’s never easier looking for another way
God bless America, dreaming of the U.S.A.,
Are we hysterical, dreaming of the United States?

[Sting & Shaggy]
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the United States

[Sting]
Don’t stop dreaming…
Don’t stop dreaming…
Don’t stop dreaming…
Don’t stop dreaming…

[Sting]
And so they work in the fields across the U.S.A.,
The work nobody else wants to feed their family
They join the army, they’re fighting for the U.S.A.,
Here in the land of the brave, and the home of the free

[Sting & Shaggy]
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the U.S.A.,
Dreaming in the United States

[Shaggy]
Big up all the immigrants living and working right here inside of America
Get up every morning working two jobs to make it here in America
I’m a military man who carried arms and fight in defense of America
I await the day when we will all inhabit a better America
