[Intro: Shaggy]
Mmmm
This girl got me waiting and the time has come for a decision to be made
Oh yes, ooh well
Tell them Ken Boothe

[Chorus: Ken Boothe]
I say the train is coming, baby
I say the train is coming now
I say the train is coming, baby
I say the train is coming now
So long I've been waiting, waiting for you (wait on my knees)
Oh Lord
Now the time has come, when it's between you and me
Oh Lord
Because the train is coming, baby
I say the train is coming now, now, now, now
I say the train is coming, baby
And I am leaving on that train, Lord

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Woman me a go away and me naw come back
Stand up at the station with me suitcase packed
Gal how me love you but me naw turn back
Tell me right now, this minute if you coming or not
Stand up at the station at about 6 o'clock
Rain it, a pour and lightning start to flash
I man wonder to myself whether she coming or not
Or it's about time I man wake up and face the fact
Well she find a new love and it's holding her back
That is why I'm standing by myself on the railroad track
Boop boop bop, heart a beat non-stop
There's no wonders or signs are you coming back?

[Chorus: Ken Boothe]
I say the train is coming, baby
I say the train is coming now
Every day I pray for this little hour, ooh yeah
Now the time has come and I want you to stand by me, ha
Because the train is coming, baby, mm
I say the train is coming now, now, now, now
And we will roam this land, mmm
Where we all will be free, Lord

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Look how long she have the general a wait
Time a run out and it a get kinda late
I am losing patience, I'm in a bad state
Set me foot up on the train, you naw go see me back again
Well me life long romance gone down the drain
All of a sudden me sunshine turn to rain
Fun and laughters into sorrows and pain
All because you left me waiting in vain
So me say, women me love you but me naw come back
Stand up a the station with me suitcase packed


[Chorus: Ken Boothe]
I say the train is coming, baby
I say the train is coming now
I say the train is coming, baby
I say the train is coming now
So long I've been waiting, waiting for you
Oh Lord
Now the time has come, when it's between you and me
Oh Lord
Because the train is coming, baby
I say the train is coming now, now, now, now
I say the train is coming, baby
And I am leaving on that train, Lord

[Outro: Shaggy]
Woman we a go away and me naw come back
Stand up at the station with me suitcase packed
Gal how me love you but me naw come back
Tell me right now this minute whether you coming or not
