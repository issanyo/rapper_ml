First of all, I man praise the father
Proceed the order, who can hear feel it harder
Brave enough fi creep cross we border
Bail out fi Lord, a mercy when we ketch you pan we corna

We won't retaliate unless provoked
No need to question loyalty 'cause I defend my folks
I won't allow my friends to be the butt of all your jokes
You try pass, a this reggae pass gets revoked

So me know dem cah hold weh
Thru thick and thru thin nah stop till we win
Dem cah control weh
All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end

No par wid, no phoney
Thru thick and thru thin nah stop till we win
That's why dem cah hold weh
All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end

Mi neva say, nuff a dem try fi reel me, dem way beneath me
Still yah and dem still cah believe me
See say dat the business it need me, music it feed me
Cah have the followers a lead me

You notice how we live, I set the trends
Dem how you tink we get dem sexy gal yah pan we ends
We live by certain standard, certain rules we neva bend
A death before dishonor dat a we a defend

So me know dem cah hold weh
Thru thick and thru thin nah stop till we win
Dem cah control weh
All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end

No par wid, no phoney
Thru thick and thru thin nah stop till we win
That's why dem cah hold weh
All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end

Real rude boy, don't need to the order
Live by they code and have faith in di fada
Protect we ends and defend we border
God alone mi trust and him a new life partner

Neva put you trust ina no gal you was order
Next ting you end up on a tape recorder
Rub extra time, chew, you stab up du wardna
Stress tek you now thin dung and muaga

So me know dem cah hold weh
Thru thick and thru thin nah stop till we win
Dem cah control weh
All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end

No par wid, no phoney
Thru thick and thru thin nah stop till we win
That's why dem cah hold weh
All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end

So me know dem cah hold weh
Thru thick and thruw thin nah stop till we win
Dem cah control weh
All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end

No par wid, no phoney
Thru thick and thru thin nah stop till we win
That's why dem cah hold weh
All the rights we defend, we have a fight till the end
