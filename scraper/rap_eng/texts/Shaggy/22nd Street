[Sting]
You’ll see me walking in the streets at night
Just following the sound of my lonely feet
I’m relinquishing of all control
My mind’s in tactical retreat

I doubt you even live here still
But it quickens up the pace of my heartbeat
When I find myself by accident
On 22nd Street

All the years, since bittersweet
Are chapters in a story book
That still is incomplete
The falling leaves will tumble to defeat
But nothing’s ever changed round here
On 22nd Street

[Shaggy]
Every time I’m at the spot I remember
22nd was the place I met the girl of my dreams
A bright sunny day in November
Such a beautiful sight staring right back at me

To get yuh body was my goal
But yuh fit perfectly ina di wifey roll
Yuh have mi unda control
On 22nd Street weh yuh capture mi heart and soul

[Sting]
I have a dream that I can’t shake
A dream where lonely lovers meet
On the corner of the avenue
And 22nd Street

The street musicians start to play
Their violins so sweet
We can’t help ourselves but dance
These steps we must complete

All the years, since bittersweet
Are chapters in a fairy tale
That still lies incomplete
The falling leaves are destined to repeat
That nothing’s ever changed round here
On 22nd Street

[Shaggy]
Well any time I walk the spot I remember
22nd was the place I met the girl of my dreams
A bright sunny day in November
Such a beautiful sight staring right back at me

I couldn’t leave you alone
Something inside told me I’m gonna make you my own
I had you locked in my zone
You are the queen of my life and the heir to my throne

[Sting]
All the years, since bittersweet
Are chapters in a fairy tale
That still lies incomplete
The falling leaves will tumble to defeat
I find myself alone again
On 22nd Street
