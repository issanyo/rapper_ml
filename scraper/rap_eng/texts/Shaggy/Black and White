[Intro: Shaggy]
Shoot it
Talk to me girl

[Verse: Kylie Minogue]
These photographs don't relieve me
They're all I have of you since you left
Seeing you smile is so misleading
It's black and white, you ain't coming back to me

[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
It's black and white, you ain't coming back to me
It's black and white

[Extended Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Smile for me, smile for me
It's all that I have left to
Remind me, remind me
That life is perfect baby
Lie to me, lie to me
So that I'll never have to let you go

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Smile for me, smile for me
Like in those photographs
That remind me, remind me
Oh how I love the way they
Lie to me, lie to me
So that I'll never have to let you go

[Verse: Kylie Minogue]
Now everything's out of focus
Since you left, baby nothing's clear
I'd rather keep this illusion
And pretend you're still right here with me

[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
It's black and white, you ain't coming back to me
It's black and white

[Extended Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Smile for me, smile for me
It's all that I have left to
Remind me, remind me
That life is perfect baby
Lie to me, lie to me
So that I'll never have to let you go

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Smile for me, smile for me
Like in those photographs
That remind me, remind me
Oh how I love the way they
Lie to me, lie to me
So that I'll never have to let you go

[Verse: Shaggy]
No more shady here - I want to know
I won't have to let you go now
Shoot it!
Here we go one time
Without your love, I'm lost girl
You know, you can't replace me
I need you in my arms, girl
Won't you come back and save me
Without your love I'm lost, girl
You know, you can't replace me
I need you in my arms, girl
Won't you come back and save me

[Extended Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Smile for me, smile for me
It's all that I have left to
Remind me, remind me
That life is perfect baby
Lie to me, lie to me
So that I'll never have to let you go

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Smile for me, smile for me
Like in those photographs
That remind me, remind me
Oh how I love the way they
Lie to me, lie to me
So then I'll never have to let you go

[Bridge: Shaggy]
Life ain't black or white
Let me take you back tonight
Let me bring you back to life
Let me put the spark in your life
Give it to me then girl i'll make
Make fifty one shades of grey
You won't get up from where you lay
Breakfast in bed, girl I don't play
When you with me, girl you're alright
Worst mistake was saying "bye bye"
Angel clipped your wing you can't fly
One load does the sync in the pipe

[Outro: Shaggy]
I, I, miss you girl
I, I, need you girl
I, I, miss you girl
I, I, need you girl
I, I, need you girl
I, I, need you girl
I, I, need you girl
I, I, need you girl
I, I, need you girl
I, I, need you girl
