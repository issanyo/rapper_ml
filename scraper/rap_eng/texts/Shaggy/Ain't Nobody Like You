[Quincy Jones' "The Dude"]
Ain't nobody whose out there like him
Any corner in the neighborhood,
That's the place that you'll always find him
Soft talkin' with a rap so sweet,
Ladies call him The Candy Rapper

Ain't nobody whose out there like him
Any corner in the neighborhood,
That's the place that you'll always find him
Soft talkin' with a rap so sweet,
Ladies call him The Candy Rapper
(They want his love.)
He's the only one that's really cool
(He's really cool)
That's the reason why he's The Dude.

[Josh Pan]
Honey came in and she caught me redhanded
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
