[Intro: Shaggy]
Sailing on the tropical seas
Enjoying the trees and the breeze
Uncle Charlie! Shaggy!!!
Unforgettable, you got me like that
Give it to ya, you give it right back
Unforgettable, you got me like that
You got me like that, I know you like that

[Verse 1: Charlie Wilson]
I could spell it to you forever
I don't want to miss a thing
In your arms I will surrender
You're my one and everything

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Love's in the air, this beautiful light
Caviar kisses, champagne on ice
Let down your hair, don't cover both eyes
Oh, baby, it's clear to see that

You are perfectly unforgettable
Priceless masterpiece, indescribable
You are perfectly unforgettable
Unforgettable-oh-oh-oooh
