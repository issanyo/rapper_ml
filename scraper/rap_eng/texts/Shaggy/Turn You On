[Intro: Cris Cab, (Shaggy)]
Oh, oh, oh (Shaggy)
Ah, turn you on (Cris Cab), yeah, yeah
(Girl you turn me on)

[Verse 1]
Why are you still here, remind me
You think we'll have more fun here, not likely
So many places that we couldn't be
So many places girl
I see your face when I see my back seat, yeah
And now your dimples got me smiling
Laughing while we're driving
The time is now arriving
Pull over to the side and ooh
You turn it on

[Chorus]
I wanna know wanna know what turns you on
I wanna know wanna know, the night is young
I wanna know wanna know what turns you on
I wanna know wanna know, the night is young

[Verse 2]
When we finally get to your home
You tell me that your parents are gone
Your dad really thinks you're an angel
I do too that's why I'm here to entertain you
It's on tonight, girl don't be shy
Your body's telling me you want it
To feel that surge, feel in your urge
The whole neighborhood knows you're home
And now the flame has been ignited
And you can't fight it, love the way I do it girl
You get so excited, oho
You turn it on

[Chorus]
I wanna know wanna know what turns you on
I wanna know wanna know, the night is young
I wanna know wanna know what turns you on
I wanna know wanna know, the night is young

[Melanie Fiona]
Cause I'm feelin' away your rock roll reggae vibe
Whisper softly in my ear that really drives me wild
Like the night we're young, I wanna have fun
Just please don't tell my daddy 'bout the things we done

[Shaggy]
Girl I make you hit the right pitch
Hope on up the night stick
And me turn you ready turn on like a light switch
From the right itch, gonna make you like this
Hop upon the [?] reunite this
[?] Turn you on
Keep your body satisfied from dust till dawn
And number one on my charts
I need the keys to your heart
Or you can make it easy push the start

[Chorus: Cris Cab, (Melanie Fiona)]
I wanna know wanna know what turns you on
(Do you really wanna know, sing that song for me)
I wanna know wanna know, the night is young
(It's all we)
I wanna know wanna know what turns you on
(Do you really wanna know, turning me on)
I wanna know wanna know, the night is young
(Keep on turning me on)

[Outro: Melanie Fiona]
You turning me on

You really really turning me on
Turning me on

[Shaggy]
I wanna turn you on
Turning you on
