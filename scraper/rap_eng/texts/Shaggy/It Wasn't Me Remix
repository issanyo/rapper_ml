[Intro: Rikrok &(Shaggy)]
Yo, man
(Yo)
Open up, man
(Yeah, what do you want, man?)
My girl just caught me
(You let her catch you?)
I don't known hall all of this happened
(With who?)
The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
(Say it wasn't you)
Alright...

[Chorus: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Atlantic Monroe]
Ay
If I'm not eatin' her ass then I'm leavin'
Teams on the back call me pippen
Gonna Asian booty gonna dip in
Eat her ass good, she got that heavy breathin'
Oh my
Oh wow
Eat her ass once and she's like holy cow
But I'm doin' stuff
On the lowkey
Eat her booty clean while she snackin' on bologna

[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (wasn’t me)
Heard the scream getting louder (wasn’t me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?
