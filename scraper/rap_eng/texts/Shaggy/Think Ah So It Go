[Intro]
Blessings again to all mi DJ friend
Have a mek dem know you understand
Hard work and dedication

[Chorus]
You think a so it go no when a DJ work hard
Bus all him sweat fa sell a million record
While some people a relex a dem yard
Si down and a draw bad card
Well then the bag a lip service it nah help the plan
Have to try and elevate we young musicians
This is something a got to tell to everyone
So make we move as one

[Verse 1]
Wey we a do weh we try
Beg you listen to the Shags
Sit down and reminisce when me a DJ session
When promoter all a rob me and the singer Rayvon
Can't find taxi fare fi reach a Flatbush bottom
To beat the system me have to strong
Full of determination
Make dem know so that the DJ have to hit number 1
Through the grace of the almighty
The gift to write a song
My dream turn to reality when the Grammy touch me hand bim
No mek me settle down and pause fe a secound
Sting International, Robert Livingston, Gibraltor, Paul O Rossi
And the Ruff Entry Gang
Hot cold and freezing down a Long Island

[Chorus]
You think a so it go no when a DJ work hard
Bus all him sweat fa sell a million record
While some people a relex a dem yard
Si down and a draw bad card
Well then the bag a lip service it nah help the plan
Have to try and elevate we young musicians
This is something a got to tell to everyone
So make we move as one

[Verse 2]
They say many are called but the chosen is few
Know why is it you want to disrespect the crew
And you don't like fe se another DJ go through
I remember whem dem a express them negative views
And a name me as the DJ most likely to lose
When dem si down and give me bad album review
Se me a foreign DJ can't make hit tune
When me hit number one them find a bag of excuse
Se me managment a mafia and me color get me through
Now me hit them like a puzzle mek them can't find a clue
And through the big broad smile I and I man see through

[Chorus]
You think a so it go no when a DJ work hard
Bus all him sweat fa sell a million record
While some people a relex a dem yard
Si down and a draw bad card
Well then the bag a lip service it nah help the plan
Have to try and elevate we young musicians
This is something a got to tell to everyone
So make we move as one

[Verse 3]
I remember when I man all a bleach a session
I remember when I man have no dollars in mi hand
I remember when I man all a fight fi Uncle Sam
I remember when I man all a face sentance
I remember all the DJ wey a chat mike fi long
Them time the dance use to ram and gunshot done session
When the DJ dem fight over the same mike stand
Red Foxx, Screey Dan Knight Rider, James Bond, Marshall One
And Corpral Tan, Mikey Slim, and Megga Man, Sleepy Wonder
Floydie Wonder, GT, Pac Man, Mikey Jarrett, K-C Jockey and Bubbo
General, Sami Levy, Mr.Eazy Trevour Sparks, Rayvon
Can't forget Lloydy Stiff, Shinehead and Sluggy Rand dem de DJ a
The DJ who a de New York veteran

[Chorus]
You think a so it go no when a DJ work hard
Bus all him sweat fa sell a million record
While some people a relex a dem yard
Si down and a draw bad card
Well then the bag a lip service it nah help the plan
Have to try and elevate we young musicians
This is something a got to tell to everyone
So make we move as one
