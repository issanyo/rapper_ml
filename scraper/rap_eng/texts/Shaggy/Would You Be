Ohhhhhh......
Baby I hope you dun get offended in anyway ya know
But your beauty is so
Magnificent
I'm just tempted to touch ya know
Yo bebe jus a meks sha a gwaan now??

(Brian Gold - Chorus)
Would you be offended if I told ya
I like the way you lick your lips
Would u be offended if I showed ya
How I like to work those hips
Is it a rude for mi to wink
An let you know I like what I see
Would u be offended if I touch ya
Imagine how it could be

(Shaggy - Verse 1)
Your like a jewel baby
This ain't no pick up line
Epitome of a lady
Truly one of a kind
Wear a precious diamond
Wid all dem polish shine?
Can't wait to hold u closer
Can u read my mind
Later images for which I won't apologize
I hope that u can see the passion in my eyes
Won't over step our boundries
These words are hard to find
Stated my intentions
Hope you my way inclined

(Brian Gold)
Tell me if im wrong
Expressing how I feel
How can I go on
If I don't know the deal

Would you be offended if I told ya
I like the way you lick your lips
Would u be offended if I showed ya
How I like to work those hips
Is it a rude for mi to wink
An let you know I like what I see
Would u be offended if I touch ya
Imagine how it could be

(Shaggy - Verse 2)
No need to be embarrassed
I know you feel the same
You feel my record
Can I say this ain't no players game
You feel the spark between us
Come lets ignite the flame
Coz if you let it pass
We'll only have ourselves to blame
Showing you a world of pleasure
That's my only aim
I wanna take ya to the clouds
An let you scream my name
This is your decision
Baby stake your claim
Take a chance
Coz if you don't den it would be a shame

(Brian Gold)
Tell me am im wrong
Expressing how I feel
Can I go on
If I don't know the deal
