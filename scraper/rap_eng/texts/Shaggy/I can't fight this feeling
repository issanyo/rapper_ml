Give it to me, do it to me, give it to me
Don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t stop, no
The way you make me feel
From deep down in my soul
I’m losing all control
Girl I can’t fight this feeling
It feels so right
Champagne and candlelight
The way you hold me tight
Girl I can’t fight this feeling

Smile ‘pon your face it’s like you bright up all mi night
Girl mi can’t wait fi give you everything you like
Love you from the day you grace mi sight
