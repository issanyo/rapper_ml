[Intro: Shaggy]
Mr. Lover pon your case again!
Sue, say, you know say you're platinum

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Such a beauty

Every man hypnotize
(Nothing can't mash up me, a mi bonafide)
Coulda never make me stray
No matter how hard dem try
(Nothing can't mash up me, a mi bonafide)
True you see me hesitate
No bother think say mi shy
(Nothing can't mash up me, a mi bonafide)
Them coulda have the gummy-gummy fi make me roll mi eye
(Nothing can't mash up me, a mi bonafide)

[Chorus (2x): Rikrok]
Sweet girl
You're the only one for me, the only one who has my heart
There's no need to stray, our love is like a perfect work of art
Ain't no need to lose your cool, you really gotta play it smart
(Got to play it smaaaaarrt)

Real ol' columbo, she nuh stop play detective

[Chorus: Rikrok]
