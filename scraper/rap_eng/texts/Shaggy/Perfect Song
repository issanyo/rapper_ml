[Verse 1: Shaggy & Maxi Priest]
I feel like I know you based upon my observation
It's been a while you've been rocking my world
Me an my friends been having private conversations
We've been calling you the bashment girl
Though you may not even value my opinion
It's safe to say that you're the topic of my song
Even though you may be out of my dominion
I just wanna say girl you are the bomb

[Chorus: Maxi Priest & Shaggy]
All I want girl is to have you in my perfect song
You are the, you are de
All I want girl is to have you in my perfect song
You are the, you are the, you are the one
All I want girl is to have you in my perfect song
You are the, you are de one girl
All I want girl is to have you in my perfect song
You are the, you are the, you are the one 'cause

[Verse 2: Shaggy & Maxi Priest]
You got de style you got the class I've been after
Just the thought of you was driving me wild
You got the stuff to fill my life with joy and laughter
You got the stuff to make me turn and smile
You're my lyricst my inspiration and girl
I wanna sing you like my favourite song
I may not have the riches of the world to offer
I just wanna say girl you are the bomb

[Chorus: Maxi Priest & Shaggy]
All I want girl is to have you in my perfect song
In a mi, in a mi
All I want girl is to have you in my perfect song
You are the, you are the one girl
All I want girl is to have you in my perfect song
