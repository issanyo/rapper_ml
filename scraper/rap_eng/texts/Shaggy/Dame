[Spoken Intro]

Your love, it makes me melt away
It makes me melt away
Your touch just makes me melt away
On a summer day
Your love makes me melt away
Baby, right away
You make my body melt for you

Sweet tripping body well tone
Make your love run down
Like an ice cream cone
Slow motion girl from top
Yeah like that keep it up like that girl
Might... cause my love won't burn you
But I keep in touch like an infernal
Whatever it takes to make you stay
Girl my love makes you melt away

[Chorus]
Your love, it makes me melt away
It makes me melt away
Your touch just makes me melt away
On a summer day
Your love, it makes me melt away
Baby, right away
You make my body hot for you

Ice my love so hot to makes your body melt like ice
Come over here lay down let's turn off the lights
Girl I will do you right
I will take you straight to paradise
Make me hot hot hot hot hot hot
So hot
Hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot

Shaggy baby, Shaggy baby

[Chorus]
Your love, it makes me melt away
It makes me melt away
Your touch just makes me melt away
On a summer day
Your love, it makes me melt away
Baby, right away
You make my body hot for you
