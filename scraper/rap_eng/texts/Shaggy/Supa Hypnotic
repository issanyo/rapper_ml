[Verse 1: Shaggy (Nicole Scherzinger)]
Hey sexy girl I see yuh are impressed
I'm puttin it on the record yuh mi love interest

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Slowly, movin into position, like a beat from you kick

You are so, boom boom, supa hypnotic
Slowly, from the floor to the ceilin
You know I got to, feel it, one more time rewind
That's right, supa hypnotic

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
Don't, stop, what your doin, thus, for, the vibe will be
Ruined
Just, keep, movin on, the one the three
Baby, it's, so, absolutely (Uh huh)

Attracted like the magnet, I can get used to this, oooh
Oooh oooh

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Slowly, movin into position, like a beat from you kick
Drum
You are so, boom boom, supa hypnotic
Slowly, from the floor to the ceilin
You know I got to, feel it, one more time rewind
That's right, supa hypnotic

[Verse 3: Shaggy]
Clinch face, bite dem lips

Yuh got mi, huggin and rubbin and touchin and squeezin
Yuh got mi, smokin yuh lovin yuh beauty quit teasin now
Forget yuh man, at leaset for awhile
I'll have yuh walkin with a pain and then smile
Yuh feel, deep inside this yard man ride
I'll have yuh, chattin patois Jamaican style now sing it

[Verse 4: Nicole Scherzinger]
So I close my eyes, realize that I belong to you, and I
Can't help but just give in

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger] x2
Slowly, movin into position, like a beat from you kick
Drum
You are so, boom boom, supa hypnotic
Slowly, from the floor to the ceilin
You know I got to, feel it, one more time rewind
That's right, supa hypnotic
[Outro: Nicole Scherzinger]
What the boom boom boom boom, oooh oooh ah ah ah, that's
Right supa hypnotic
Supa hypnotic, Ooooh, supa hypnotic, what the boom boom
Boom boom
