[Intro]
Yuh hear mi, God fi repent, yuh know
God up, God up, fi real time serious
Yuh dun know, God up, God up, God up

[Verse 1]
Check the state of the world we live in
Can't you see it's a cryin' shame?
(Forgive them)
Leadership fails before it begins
Motivated by personal gains
(Forgive them)
Tempers flare and patience wear thin
Finger pointin' but who is to blame?
Repent (x4)

[Hook]
'Cause we're two steps away from a real disaster
Think they're the boss but a who are the master?
Life set a pace, everything's much faster
Need to slow down and pray, forgive them

Two steps away from a real disaster
Think they're the boss but a who are the master?
Life set a pace, everything's much faster
Need to slow down and pray

[Verse 2]
Fightin' for what they did not create
Cryin' peace while inflicting pain
(Forgive them)
Man deciding another man's fate
Claiming power in their God's name
(Forgive them)
Words of love but their actions speak hate
Seems like mankind has gone insane
Repent (x4)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(They don't know)
If they stick to this path there'll be nothing else left to defend
(They don't know)
Instead of finding a cure we should look for the means to prevent
(They don't know)
We can talk to the Lord, ain't no need for a special event
Repent (x4)

[Hook]

[Verse 1]

[Outro]
Repent (x16)
Forgive them
