[Intro: Shaggy]
Girl, gimmi little loving, girl gimmi little loving, baby, come come
Girl, gimmi little loving, I want you by my side tonight
Girl, gimmi little loving, girl gimmi little loving, baby, come come
Girl gimmi little loving don't wanna be alone tonight

[Chorus: Prof T]
See I don't mind when you say that you're going away
I just don't want to be lonely
And I don't care if we share only moments a day
I just don't want to be lonely

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Girl, could you hold me babe that would please me
Don't do this darling I hate when you leave me
You got me hooked girl this isn't easy
If you don't love me baby release me
Now girl we could dine pour us some wine
After the meal we can unwind putting my heart back on the line
Girl its a fact you should be mine
Now mi no plan fi spend another long lonely night
And a lay down in a mi bed a hug mi pillow up tight
No feel no way I man can't take the fuss and the fight
I rather make sweet love to you under the candle light

[Chorus: Prof T]
I don't mind when you say that you're going away
I just don't want to be lonely
And I don't care if we spend only moments a day
I just don't want to be lonely

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Now listen me please I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you darling put me at ease
What's with this feeling I wish it would cease
My heart is held hostage I beg for release
Why won't reveal just what you feel
Let it out babe just be for real
Girl what you afraid of why is it concealed
I know what I bargained for and this ain't the deal
Now mi no plan fi spend another long lonely night
And a lay down in a mi bed a hug mi pillow up tight
No feel no way I man can't take the fuss and the fight
I rather make sweet love to you under the candle light

[Chorus: Prof T]
I don't mind when you say that you're going away
I just don't want to be lonely
And I don't care if we spend only moments a day
I just don't want to be lonely

[Outro: Shaggy]
Girl, gimmi little loving, girl gimmi little loving, baby, come come
Girl, gimmi little loving, I want you by my side tonight
Girl, gimmi little loving, girl gimmi little loving, baby, come come
Girl gimmi little loving don't wanna be alone tonight
