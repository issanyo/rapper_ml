Yo man, yo, open up man, what do you want man?
My girl just caught me, you let her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen, with who?
The girl next door, you know? Man
I don't know what to do, say it wasn't you, alright
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
How you can grant the woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness while you cling on your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you, the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player, you have to know how to play
If she say you're not, convince her, say you're gay
Never admit to a word when she say
I need to claim and you tell her baby, no way
But she caught me on the counter, wasn't me
Saw me bangin' on the sofa, wasn't me
I even had her in the shower, wasn't me
She even caught me on camera, wasn't me
She saw the marks on my shoulder, wasn't me
Heard the words that I told her, wasn't me
Heard the screams gettin' louder, wasn't me
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from
What she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me
Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on da right prefix
Whenever you should see her, make da gigolo flex
As smarty as it be by you ina de complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worryin' 'bout things from the past
Hardly recollectin' and then she'll go to noontime mass
Rik-boy, your answer, go over there
But if she pack a gun, you know you better run fast
But she caught me on the counter, wasn't me
Saw me bangin' on the sofa, wasn't me
I even had her in the shower, wasn't me
She even caught me on camera, wasn't me
She saw the marks on my shoulder, wasn't me
Heard the words that I told her, wasn't me
Heard the screams gettin' louder, wasn't me
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin', it makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player but you're completely lost
That's why I sing
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
