[Verse 1]
Told me once, told me twice in a row
You were gonna leave me
That we were done, love story gone wrong
All because of me, yeah

[Bridge]
I didn't love enough
To make us keep it up
And now you're on your way
You're taking your chance on love
Thinking that you're so tough
Hoping I
Will be missing you and all I'll do is cry
Begging you to come back

[Chorus]
But if you're gonna put a gun to my head
Better make sure I get dead
Cuz I'm a firestarter
I can turn water into flames
Don't put a gun to my head
Unless you'll make me dead
Cuz I'm a firestarter
Imma burn, Imma burn till you're gone
Don't put a gun to my head
Unless you'll make me dead
Cuz I'm a firestarter
Imma burn, Imma burn till you're

[Post-Chorus]
(Bang, bang!)
Don't put a gun to my head
(Bang, bang!)
Don't put a gun to my head

[Verse 2]
We go up, we go down, we go all around
But now you wanna keep it simple
No more play, no more running round town
All to make me see yeah

[Bridge]
I didn't love enough
To make us keep it up
And now you're on your way
You're taking your chance on love
Thinking that you're so tough
Hoping I
Will be missing you and all I'll do is cry
Begging you to come back

[Chorus]
But if you're gonna put a gun to my head
Better make sure I get dead
Cuz I'm a firestarter
I can turn water into flames
Don't put a gun to my head
Unless you'll make me dead
Cuz I'm a firestarter
Imma burn, Imma burn till you're

[Post-Chorus]
(Bang, bang!)
Don't put a gun to my head
(Bang, bang!)
Don't put a gun to my head

[Verse 3: Shaggy]
I took her love hostage
Tied her to the bed like bondage
Foreplay girl I speak your language
You come first so I take no advantage granted
I know just what your body needs
So girl just let me proceed
Give it to you slow or with a little speed
Great loving guaranteed indeed
Ah uh my faulr you ah go fall in love
(Why ya gonna do me like that?)
Ah uh my faulr you ah go fall in love
(Why ya gonna do me like that?)

[Post-Chorus]
(Imma burn, Imma burn till you're-)
(Bang, bang!)
Don't put a gun to my head
(Bang, bang!)
Don't put a gun to my head
