When she moves me inside
Feels so right now
I’ve got nothing to hide
When she moves
Sends my spirit so high

I walk towards her with my two left feet

[Shaggy]
You got the courage from this sweet reggae beat

[Sting]
And then she greets me with a smile so sweet

[Shaggy]
My heart goes boom, boom, missing a beat

[Sting]
When she moves
When she moves me inside
Feels so right now

When she moves
Sends my spirit so high
