[Shaggy]
I’m sitting here staring at the four walls thinking what is it I got to do?
Get back my baby
Lonely is taking over now and my heart’s kinda heavy so
I gotta get back my baby
I’m feeling kind of hopeless now, should have never messed around
You never know what you got ‘til the moment that you lose it
I gotta get back my baby

[Shaggy]
My girl, why, tell me what I got to say now
Cause I don’t really wanna see you wave, bye
I can’t bear all this pain in my heart
I swear I won’t lie
As soon as you walk out the door tell me why I realize
I can’t live without you

[Sting & Shaggy]
I’m sitting here staring at the four walls thinking what is it I got to do?
Get back my baby
Lonely is taking over now and my heart’s kinda heavy so
I gotta get back my baby
I’m feeling kind of hopeless now, should have never messed around
You never know what you got ‘til the moment that you lose it
I gotta get back my baby

[Sting]
As she cries telling me that we’re through, I can’t deny
Won’t deny, on my bended knee
Best to give it a try
Stop, goodbye, she won’t even look me in the eye
Baby, I lied but I love you
I’ll do anything girl

[Sting & Shaggy]
I’m sitting here staring at the four walls thinking what is it I got to do?

Lonely is taking over now and my heart’s kinda heavy so
I gotta get back my baby
I’m feeling kind of hopeless now, should have never messed around
You never know what you got ‘til the moment that you lose it
I gotta get back my baby

[Shaggy]
At night I wonder
Why did I commit such blunder?
Now the pain is taking me under
She deleted my number
Nightmare, I woke from my slumber
Thinking baby what should I say
Tell me where have you gone?
Baby when you coming home?
I need you by my side and my throne
As I grow weak, without you girl I’m incomplete
I’ll do anything just to make it up

[Sting & Shaggy]
