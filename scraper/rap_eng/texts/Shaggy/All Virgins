[Intro]
I don't believe that virginity is as common as it used to be
Some of them a worth leave the nights
Gal a stick out pon a my night
Yo-a

[Verse 1]
The gal fit lack of traffic
Man them burn cloche and try don't get her stick
Just like a cherry every man trying fi pick
The man a fly belt buckle and a try down-zip
Watch it

[Chorus]
All virgins put upon your hand
All virgins grap up your gram
All virgins put upon your hand
All virgins grap up your gram

[Verse 2]
Look how the man them line up long
Everybody want piece of the action
Man them want fi see them long john

True she command, that no mean she a one
Wine pon the gal if the gal at divan
Pon top a man a where she frequent tone

[Chorus]
All virgins put upon your hand
All virgins grap up your gram
All virgins put upon your hand

Oh Suzetta give to every man

True she a virgin I man read fi long

Carry her around mi loverboy mansion
Wash her foot inna mi loverboy wash pan

Rub her down with the loverboy lotion

All virgins put upon your hand
All virgins grap up your gram

True you deh ya and you are boss marvellous
Come pack a copy inna the little tight dress

All virgins put upon your hand
All virgins grap up your gram

The man a fly belt buckle and a try down-zip

All virgins put upon your hand
All virgins grap up your gram
All virgins put upon your hand
All virgins grap up your gram
