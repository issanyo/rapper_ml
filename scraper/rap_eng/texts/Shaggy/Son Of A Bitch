[Intro: Marsha (Lady Saw)]
Aight that's it!
(What's wrong???)
Im tired, sick and tired of the same old thing over and over again
(Come on girlfriend talk to me)
I'm takin the bitch to court (Why?)
I'm takin the house, Im takin the kids (Uh huh)
He can have the Volvo, but that damn Jag is mine!
(Oh sure girlfriend, oh sure, sure)

[Hook 1: Marsha (Lady Saw)]
Could you believe I caught my man red handed
Screwin' that slut next door (What!)
Picture them being both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor (Oh Man!)
What could he be thinking?
Can't believe that he would hit that freak
Girl, my jaw hit the floor
I was so mad I couldn't even speak

[Verse 1: Lady Saw]
It's simple!
Run di bwoy out of your life
Divorce him as your wife
Diss him cause, you know him disrespect you too
Nuh mek him come back pon di ends
Mash up all di Benz
Call the cops, and tell them say, "him beating you"
The mother fucker don't deserve, wha' you a try preserve
The marriage a somebody him a look fi use
It nuh mek sense you pretend, him nah change again
A dog will be a dog 'til the very end

[Bridge: Marsha (Lady Saw)]
Underwear on the counter (Son of a bitch!!)
They left stains on the sofa (Son of a bitch!!)
She left her weave in the shower (Son of a bitch!!)
See, I got them on camera (Son of a bitch!!)
I saw her kissin' his shoulder (Son of a bitch!!)
Him jook it and him flip it over (Son of a bitch!!)
I heard her screams getting louder (Son of a bitch!!)
Now this relationship's over!

[Hook: Marsha (Lady Saw)]
Could you believe I caught my man red handed
Screwin' that slut next door (Damn!)
Picture them being both butt naked
Bangin on the bathroom floor (Nasty!)
What could he be thinking
Can't believe that he would hit that freak (Uh uh?)
Girl my jaw hit the floor
I was so mad I couldn't even speak

[Verse 2: Lady Saw]
Girlfriend...
Look how you treat him like a king
Him nuh haffi lift a pin
Get him fi every penny weh him ever earn
Nuh tek di bag of sweet talk, prepare fi walk di walk
Mek him know this is a lesson weh him haffi learn
Light di clothes and mek it burn
Tell him a fi your turn
All weh him a dead, a nuh fi your concern
Me nuh care, him nah nuh right fi bring him gal a night
A yaso it fi done, argument it a dry

[Verse 3: Marsha]
He tried to tell me he was sorry for the pain that he caused
I been listenin to his reasoning, it makes no sense at all
Tried to act like he was sorry for the pain that he caused
Girl, he thought he was a playa
But he wasn't at all

[Hook: Marsha (Lady Saw)]
Could you believe I caught my man red handed
Screwin that slut next door (Right there?)
Picture them being both butt naked
Bangin on the bathroom floor
What could he be thinking
Can't believe that he would hit that freak (Uhhhh!)
Girl my jaw hit the floor
I was so mad I couldn't even speak
