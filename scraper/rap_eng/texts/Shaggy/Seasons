[Intro: Shaggy & Omi]
Season
Right baby sees, ah fi get it nah need no reason
Yes Costi, Yes Mr. Lover
Omi - Shaggy

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Girl, you must be sent from above
You keep me warm under the winter glove
Your smile is colorful like flowers in the spring
So me have fi make a toast to your ting, ting, ting
I never meant to fall for your love
I know you're all I'm thinking of
This is more than a summer fling
It's only right that I put on the ring, ring, ring

[Pre-Chorus: Omi & Shaggy]
Sad if you left my sight
I won't be okay
Like it's the last time
Love me right through every season
(Through every season - me gal we have no reason)
There ain't no reason you can't stay
(For every season)

[Chorus: Omi]
Right through every season
Right through every season
Right through every season

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Girl, you bring me up just like the sun on the horizon
And even when it rains I'm enlightened
Oh, you're so sexy with you in the swing
I'm in love watching when you do your thing, thing, thing
Girl, you make me heart skip a beat
And any time you no near, me no sleep
Feel like the leaves when they drop off the limbs
Me canâ€™t loose you, so me put on the ring, ring, ring

[Bridge: Omi]
In a world, in a world without, without your love
I don't think I'd be able to breathe
Out of memories when I should be dreaming

[Pre-Chorus: Omi]
Sad if you left my sight
I won't be okay
Like it's the last time
Love me right through every season
There ain't no reason you can't stay

[Interlude: Shaggy & Omi]
Right through every season
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every, yeah
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every, yeah
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every, yeah

[Chorus: Omi & Shaggy]
Right through every season
Right through every season
Girl you always on my mind
Right through every season
I need you 'till the end of time
Right through every season

[Outro: Shaggy & Omi]
You're the apple of my eye
Woman you make me feel like I can fly
There's something [?]
That's better than you and I
Season
Right through every season
Right through every season
Right through every season
Baby girl, you make me sing
