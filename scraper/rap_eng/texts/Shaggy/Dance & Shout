[Intro]
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover
Uh, uh, well
Sugar
Here's another one
And another day

[Verse 1]
Move to this, let me see you jump and twist
Pump your fist cause you know it's hard to resist
As long you know you're rollin' with the love
Specialist
Feel the pow, let me put the groove in your hips
The night is young, so let's go roll with the fun
You got some gun, check it out, gimme some
Cause I'm about to play an old girl like a drum
She shackatack, poor soul settle down

[Chorus]
Girl, what you gon' do with all that body?
(​Shake it up all night)
Careful with that thing before you hurt somebody
(​Tell me what you like)
Do it, baby
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground

[Verse 2]
Gotta holla' to my fellas who be hangin' by the
Bathroom door
Waitin' for the honeys dance in the dance floor
Push up and get the niggas y'all ready for the score
Now who's the dog, you're the one that sung hardcore
Come on
I gotta take this part to a new high
Keep it tight, ain't got no time no fight
You wanna be a player, better know to do it right
Kissing all the honeys under the disco light

[Chorus]
Girl, what you gon' do with all that body?
(​Shake it up all night)
Careful with that thing before you hurt somebody
(​Tell me what you like)
Let 'em know
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground

[Verse 3]
Take you where there's all night action
Dancin' to the beat with a passion
Mr. Lover party's happenin'
Doin' anything you and I can
I'll take you where there's all night action
Dancin' to the beat with a passion
Mr. Lover party's happenin'
Doin' anything you and I can

[Chorus]
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground

[Verse 4]
So baby-baby, let me see you move your body pon the
Dancehall floor
Gotta one, just jigga, shake it up, gimme more
Jerk chicken on the grill, so make the champagne pour
Girl, don't be a drag, I might show you the door
(What?!)
I like to see bodies take and shake
Dressed in lace, uh, and a perfect shape
Girls local and out of state
I got a couple of them and I'm gettin' ready to mate

[Chorus]
Cassandra, let's shake (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Michelle, let's shake (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground

Shake your body down to the ground

Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (shout)
