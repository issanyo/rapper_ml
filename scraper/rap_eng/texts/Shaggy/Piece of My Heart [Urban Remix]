Enough of the break up
(Yeah, yeah)
Girl, let's deal with the make up
Alimony mean all the money
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Didn't I make you feel
(Didn't I make you feel)
Like you were the only man
(You were the only man)
(The only man in you life)
Didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can
(Oh, yes I did)
But for all the love I gave ya
It's never enough
(Not enough)
But I'm gonna show you, baby
That a woman can be tough
(So)
So come on, come on
Come on, come on and
So what, you have me under pressure
Despite the fact say in life you give me pleasure
I'm the only man and I possess the keys to you treasure
So give the contender on the trail
Captivate your mind
I'll make your heart grow fonder
(Ooh)
Still you're trying to find out
Whose covers that I'm under
So you start to wonder
Heart beat like thunder
(Yeah)
So I blow my cover
'Cause I'm the great pretender
Girl, surrender, yeah
(Take it)
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Oh, oh, break it)
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
(Hey, darling, give it up, give it up, give it up)
(Oh, oh, have it)
Have another little bit of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
You play Detective Boo, want a new suit
Going through my pockets, searchin' for clues
Trying to follow me, you and your desperate crew
The end of this relationship was long over due
Now what you did was cute, girl, you spent the loot
Easy on the tears, oops, man, you soil my suit
Do yourself a favor and find a new recruit
And don't take it personal because you got the boot
You're out on the streets
(Looking good, absolutely)
And you know deep down in you heart that that ain't right
(Come on, come on)
And, oh, you never, never hear me when I cry at night
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I tell myself, that I can stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I sing it again
(Yeah, say it again)
So come on, come on, come on, come on and
(So what?)
(Take it)
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Why don't you)
(Oh, oh, break it)
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
(I don't think you know)
(Oh, oh, have it)
Have another little bit of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
I can make you, you can make me
{Ooh, ah)
Anyway you want it, baby, we can do it right
Jump out a the frying pan and straight down in a the fire
I'm Mr. Gigolo, your most notorious liar
Ex-amount of loving you get what me did require
(Ooh)
Your personal attendant, well, my love is not for hire
Girl, search yourself, 'cause I'm you heart's desire
Twenty-five girls in a my life, don't want a wife, I need a lover, yeah
(Take it)
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Oh, oh, break it)
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
(I got your heart, I got your heart, girl)
(Oh, oh, have it)
(Shoop)
Have another little bit of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
(Ooh, ah)
Rock, baby
