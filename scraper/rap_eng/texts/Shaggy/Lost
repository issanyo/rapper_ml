Verse 1 - SHAGGY

You thinking that your grown now
You got your eyes set on the street
Some how you think that you can stand on your feet
No job,no house,no car
Tell me how can you quire these things
I know just what your thinking
The road you wanna take will leave you sinking
You wanna roll around with your crew
Tow drunks
Gang bangs
Steal cars
Doing all of these horrible things

Verse 2 - SHAGGY

See son its never too late
The effort to correct is never to great
A family should stick together
One blood
One luv
One heart open arms welcome you at the gate
You thinking that im crazy
I see through all them see your visions
Hazzy
I'm fired up with the preminotions
Black suits
Long faces sad words slow singing at the side of your grave

HOOK

CHORUS
