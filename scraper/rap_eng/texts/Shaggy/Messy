[Verse 1: Dinah]
I'll tell you straight how I feel with no filter
No touchin' up what you see, there's no filter

[Refrain: Dinah]
I can be cruel sometimes, outta my mind
Insecure and out the door
I am who I am and you won't have to wonder

[Pre-Chorus: Lauren]
I can be hard to handle
Dance around the house with nothin' but the radio on
I can be such a scandal, runnin' at the mouth
Then crying on the bedroom floor

[Chorus: All]
I can be messy
I can be messy, yeah, I admit it
I can be messy
I can get crazy, yeah, I admit it
Oh, no changin'
Oh, no changin', ayy
I can be messy
Yeah, I can be messy, yeah, I admit it

[Verse 2: Normani]
No secrets here, it's just me with the lights on
Say what I'm feelin' 'cause I can't hold my tongue

[Refrain: Normani]
I can be cruel sometimes, outta my mind
Insecure and out the door
I am who I am and you won't have to wonder

[Pre-Chorus: Ally]
I can be hard to handle
Dance around the house with nothin' but the radio on
I can be such scandal, runnin at the mouth
Then crying on the bedroom floor

[Chorus: All, Normani & Dinah]
I can be messy (I can be messy)
I can be messy, yeah, I admit it
I can be messy
I can get crazy, yeah, I admit it
Oh, no changin' (Oh)
Oh, no changin', ayy (Oh, yeah)
I can be messy
Yeah, I can be messy, yeah, I admit it

[Bridges: All, Ally & Normani]
Oh, I admit it, I admit it, I admit it
No apologies, oh, yeah
Oh, no changin', oh, no changin' it, oh, no changin' (Said no changin')
Yeah, I admit it, yeah

[Chorus: All, Dinah, Ally, Normani & (Lauren)]
I can be messy
I can be messy (Yeah), yeah, I admit it
I can be messy
I can get crazy, yeah, I admit it (Yeah, I admit it)
Oh, no changin' (No changing)
Oh, no changin', ayy (No changing it)
I can be messy
Yeah, I can be messy, yeah, I admit it (Yeah, I admit it)
I can be messy
I can be, I can be, I can be (Oh)
I can be messy
Messy, baby (Messy, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Oh, no changin'
Oh, no changin', ayy (Yeah)
I can be messy, yeah, I can be messy
Yeah, I admit it
