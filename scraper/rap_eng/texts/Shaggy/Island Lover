A man don't know what him have until him lose it
And when she gone it's like he don't know what lick him

Man have him woman from oh so long
She give him whole heap of loving and satisfaction
She never ever set eye pon a next man
Support you when you down and even held your hand
Well she is the mother of your child and the lady in your life
With the ring upon her finger represents that she is your wife
Why you want to mistreat her and torment her life
Like you really don't believe she leave you for another guy

She cannot take it no more she's got one foot through the door(ME)
Need some time by herself she feeling so insecure
She decide she's gonna venture on an island tour
Jamaica! Island of the sunny outdoors
So she could walk along the beach and relax along the shore
With her sun baked skin, but her heart was sore
Stumbled on an island lover wita coconut cure
Put a smile on her face and let her feelings pour

A Joe Grin with a funky dread locks
"Hello!" with that real low tone
And a raw Jamaican accent make her poor heart foam
She forgot about the problems that she had at home
The night was young it was eight o' four
Reggae music it a lick and she was bored no more
All what de pan her mind she hope to God that she score

[Verse 4]
A man don't know what he has until that glorious day
When she says she's gonna leave him and he says "no way"
Take a vacation be back in a few days
You a think 'bout all the girls you'll have while she is away
What is it one, or two, or three, or four, or five in a day
Is it Suzi, Beverly, or is it Angie or Faye
Well I'm your island lover upon your girl's parkway
Inside my love canoe she spends her night and day
You think she getting played but she is getting laid
And now the both of us together damn we got it made

With a figure like that you should be on top of my dresser like a figure
