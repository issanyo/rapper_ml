(feat. Na'sha)

Long time she want me change my ways
Knew as me a bad from back in the days

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
Thought we would last forever and a day
I took one look in his eyes and fell for all his lies
So why do I want this man to stay? Yeah, yeah(uh! uh! (Shaggy)

Wooky, wooky, when me give Angelina
Make she curl up, I throw them and scream
Feel me loving make them gal them reveal
Everything in them heart that them feel

Good loving when the woman receives
Sake them ehat she wants she can't leave
Ragga, ragga, me no pet gal feel real
Make them know me no romp when we a do it

Gal, you're hot and it shows
From the hair style to the pedicure toes
Gal, mesmerize from the lyrical flows
We habe the argument to con her out of she clothes

She knows that bavk in the days pon the ends
Situation used to make the wise girl tense
That's when she hear about me and her girlsfriends
Me never romp to swtich them up on every weekends

Tony can't do it like a me, wooky, wooky
Sherly can't do it like a me, wooky, wooky
Brandon can't do it like a me, wooky wooky
Kevin can't do it like a me

You got the style and the looks
Gal, them a grudge you and talk about you stush
Man, I see you walk and all I notish your tush
You're well, Brazilian up on all walks of your bush, come on

You leave a lasting impression in my mind
Top shelf material, your dress well divine
Man, them all a look for you if you put on di whine
Tell them

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
Thought we would last forever and a day
I took one look in his eyes and fell for all his lies
So why do I want this man to stay? Yeah, yeah(uh! uh! (Shaggy)

Loving, loving, whem me give Angelina
Make she curl up, I throw them and scream
Feel me loving make them gal them reveal
Everything in them heart that them fell

Good loving when the girl them receives
Sake them want and can't leave
Say, ragga, ragga, me no pet gal feel real
Make them know me no romp when ew a do it
