[Chorus: Shaggy, Brian & Tony Gold]
For every day and every moment (wa, wa)
For every smile and every dream (every smile and every dream girl)
I'll paint you a rainbow (uh, a big rainbow)
For all the joy you bring (all the joy you bring yeah)
I'll buy you a mountain (a nice mountain girl)
And I'll cry you a stream (wa, uh)
I'll give you a river (so wa)
To show what you mean to me (so wa, uh, uh)

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
I don't wanna sound cheezy
But I realize that loving you is very easy
Playing in the summer sun warm and breezy
Not at all sleazy
Poor, but I love it when you give me that look
Whoo, you're looking so teasy
Woman you're the fire and my love and it's freezy
Living like a Jefferson's George and weezy
If I am queezy
Girl you're always to hear and I'm dote this time
So I'm needed
Can't get enough of you women I'm greedy
Sinking in the ocean of your love and unheeding
Unconseeding and I wanna show you what you mean to me

[Chorus: Shaggy, Brian & Tony Gold]
For every day and every moment (wa, wa)
For every smile and every dream (every smile and every dream girl)
I'll paint you a rainbow (uh, a big rainbow)
For all the joy you bring (all the joy you bring yeah)
I'll buy you a mountain (a nice mountain girl)
And I'll cry you a stream (wa, uh)
I'll give you a river (so wa)
To show what you mean to me (so wa, uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
You know you have a shoulder you're persignin' on, cryin' on
When you need your lover know it's Shaggy you're relyin' on
Under the wings of me love and 'bout to flyin' on
You mean the world to me
Cause I've been with many girls and I never saw the benefit
Now I got the love I want my enemies of keepin' it
Bonified lover and I'm polybery keepin' it
I want the world succeed

[Chorus: Shaggy, Brian & Tony Gold]
For every day and every moment (so wa)
For every smile and every dream (smile and every dream girl)
I'll paint you a rainbow (a lovely rainbow)
For all the joy you bring (all the joy you bring yeah)
I'll buy you a mountain (right a mountain)
And I'll cry you a stream (wa,wa)
I'll give you a river
To show what you mean to me (what you mean for, wa)
