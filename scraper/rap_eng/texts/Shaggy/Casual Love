[Verse 1: Jordin Sparks]
You've been here all this time
Ooh, your love's been heavy on my mind
Don't know how to describe
The way you made me feel
Took me on a high

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
And I know I'm hurting when you're not around
And I know I'm yearnin' for your love, baby

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
I don't wanna be just another girl to you
I don't wanna be just a casual lover
I don't wanna be just another girl you knew
I don't wanna be just a casual love

[Verse 2: Jordin Sparks]
Don't want no fussin' fight
The pain I've been through, baby
Now I see the light
No more lonely days and night
No, I might not know if what we have is right

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
And I know I'm hurting when you're not around
And I know I'm yearnin' for your love, baby

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
I don't wanna be just another girl to you
I don't wanna be just a casual lover
I don't wanna be just another girl you knew
I don't wanna be just a casual love

[Bridge: Jordin Sparks]
This love can last forever if we just hold on tight
I know that I am better with you by my side
I gave my heart so freely and laid it all on the line
Cause lovin' you is like breathin'
It's so easy

[Verse 4: Shaggy]
Cause loving's you is so easy
She love when (?), my love is guaranteed, yeah
I'm one phone call away, girl, if you need me
I'm your's, if you need a shoulder if you lean, yeah
You don't (?) my love you know
Relax and drop your arms, (?)
Regard the things I do for you comes naturally
Not anyone can get it casually, aye

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
I don't wanna be just another girl to you
I don't wanna be just a casual lover
I don't wanna be just another girl you knew
I don't wanna be just a casual love

[Outro: Jordin Sparks]
I don't want to be no, no
I don't want to be no, no, no
