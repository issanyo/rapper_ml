[Verse 1]
Early Sunday morning in the spring of '96
I'm chilling on my couch watching the Bulls against the Knicks
My honey marches in and ask if I think I'm slick
It seem she found my shirt with lipstick
I thought I could explain but then my story wouldn't stick
Incriminating pictures show me some other chick
It happened once before and she was tired of the tricks
She ask me if I can spell the word evict

[Chorus]
Why me Lord? Situation's looking kinda bad
Why me Lord? I lost the best girl I ever had
Why me Lord? I'm homeless and I'm feeling kinda sad
Why me, why me, why me, why me?
Why me Lord? How you member massa god so quick
Why me Lord? When trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit
Why me Lord? Is just because you don't know when to quit
Why me, why me, why me, why me?

[Post-Chorus]
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?

[Verse 2]
Just the other day when I was rolling with my crew
Made a little flex around by Flatbush Avenue
I'm calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew
That's when I saw the boys in blue
They pulled me to the side why I don't even have a clue
Looking for a reason and they finally found a few
A case of ammunition and a loaded .32
I can't believe what I'm going through

[Chorus]
Why me Lord? Here I am I gotta face the time
Why me Lord? Though the evidence ain't even mine
Why me Lord? I swear I ain't guilty of the crime
Why me, why me, why me, why me?
Why me Lord? How you member massa god so quick
Why me Lord? When trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit
Why me Lord? Is just because you don't know when to quit
Why me, why me, why me, why me?

[Post-Chorus]
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me, why me?

[Verse 3]
Take heed never take advantage of the things you need
Never let yourself be over come by greed
Walk the straight and narrow and you shall succeed
Get you act up to speed
And try no matter what it takes to give a next man a blye
Everybody else deserve a piece a the pie
Honesty the best policy no sell no samfie
And if ya need me ask why

[Post-Chorus]
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me Lord, why me?
Why me, why me, why me?
