So amazin' how this world was made
I wonder if God is a woman
The gift of life astounds me to this day
I give it up for the woman
She's the constant wind that fills my sail
Oh, that woman
With a smile and a style
She'll protect you like a child
That's a woman
She'll put a smile upon her face
And take you to a higher place
So don't you underestimate
Strength of a woman
Strength of a woman
Woke up this mornin'
I got up with the scent of a woman
S'picture if you would what life would be
Ain't much good without a woman
She can nag and be a constant pain
Oh, that woman
But those hips, she's got me whipped
And it's just too hard to resist
What a woman
She'll put a smile upon her face
And take you to a higher place
So don't you underestimate
Strength of a woman
Strength of a woman
Tender lips that's so so sweet
Gentle words she softly speaks
Such a nature will we meet
God bless the ground beneath her feet
She can take you on a high
Be your comfort when you cry
But if you look into her eyes, you'll see
The strength of a woman
Strength of a woman
She'll put a smile upon her face
And take you to a higher place
So don't you underestimate
Strength of a woman
