Straight to the lips as I kissed your lips
Sweet ‘cause my girl talk wit her lips
Don’t worry I’m some kind of boy you can’t miss

Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya
Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya
Uh, you got a way about ya (you better know)
I can’t live without ya
Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya

(Chorus)
Hotter than a flame
Sweet like sugar cube
Girl our love is like one and not the same
Your kiss is like a drug and girl it’s driving me insane
Every touch intoxicate me but I regret none of it
I think is that the cure we mix with all of me on care
That true I never met ya and all of it remain
And this will last forever ‘cause our love will never change

Uh your arms are tender
My whole life surrendered
Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya (you better know)
Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya

Girl you are the greatest love I’ve ever known
Chest on my chest every second we’re alone now
Uh you know your loving really set the tone
And just to find your love I would turn over every stone
Could last forever, don’t ever change it
Even if you’re far away I never hope to reach ya
If you know then I’m not when I’m with you
Girl we were connected, this a fire can’t kill

I never knew, I never knew
Until I kissed those lips of yours (she pon the lips, she love to kiss)
Until I kissed those lips of yours (girl this kiss can’t miss)
I never knew, I would’ve never known
Until I kissed you
I never knew, no I never knew

(Chorus)
Hotter than a flame
Sweet like sugar cube
Girl our love is like one and not the same
Your kiss is like a drug and girl it’s driving me insane
Every touch intoxicate me but I regret none of it
I think is that the cure we mix with all of me on care
That true I never met ya and all of it remain
And this will last forever ‘cause our love will never change

Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya (until I kissed ya)
Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya (you can’t miss)
Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya (I can’t miss ya with my kiss)
Boy I never knew what I missed until I kissed ya (kiss like a crispy skin)
