SHAGGY!

I love to see the ladies take full control (uh)
Independant woman don't depend on a soul (that's right)
Confidential the fact that she has her own (uh uh)
No body has to tell her how to play her role (oh ya)

I'm talking all the honeys to my left
Sophisticated ladies are the one who set the trends
Ladies who dont hang around with no progressive friends
They dont have no time to play a silly game
Shallow mans are all the same
All the fellas who get played
Not because they pour the drinks it means they're gettin laid
Show her some respect and maybe wouldn't have been played
Yo - Now you're looking kinda dumb, I bet this pants are tiresome

I love to see the ladies take full control (love it ...)
Independant woman don't depend on a soul (no depend on nobody, see)
Confidential the fact that she has her own (...)
No body has to tell her how to play her role (sweet)

(say what)Beep Beep, dude's pager going off
Car keys spinnin on his finger showin off
Bet he thinks all the hyper love the latest stuff
It takes more than flashiness for home girl to be impressed
Ladies want be be adored
Ladies want a real man to keep them reassured
Forget about the cash she wants a heart to be secured
He's not gonna sacrifie the ..., can't hang with step aside

I love to see the ladies take full control (...)(oh ay oh ay oh)
Independant woman don't depend on a soul (...)(sweet)
Confidential the fact that she has her own (uh mm)(...)
No body has to tell her how to play her role (Tell em Barrington)(sweet)

She's alright (She's alright)
It don't matter what you want to offer her because she's been around the world
You're so right (You're so right)
Bet your thinking that she's confidential women but she's an independent girl
She's alright (She's alright)
It don't matter what you want to offer her because she's been around the world
You're so right (You're so right)
Bet your thinking that she's confidential women but she's an independent girl (oh oh oh oh)

I love to see the ladies take full control (...)(yeah)
Independant woman don't depend on a soul (...)(sweet)
Confidential the fact that she has her own (...)
No body has to tell her how to play her role (Watch out)(oh yo oh)

I love to see the ladies take full control (uh)
Independant woman don't depend on a soul (ah wa)
Confidential the fact that she has her own (Hot girl)
No body has to tell her how to play her role (Oh no oh oh)

Strong women (shidely shidely shidely?)...
