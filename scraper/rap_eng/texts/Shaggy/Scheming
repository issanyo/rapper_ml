Girl I trick style
Take freedom watch up!
Where you a come from this morning?
How you've been strolling in your life?
I got no answer when I was calling
Your phone's been off all night
No regards for my feelings
I think it's time we sever ties
It's clear to me you're creepin
Don't wanna hear no more lies
'Cause you be scheming
You take my feed yap
You be scheming
No take mine for a fool no way
You be scheming
You take my feed yap
You be scheming
No take mine for a fool no way
You think you are so clever
Yea it's got its own back ways
You slip and call me Trevor
Such disrespect to my face
Good luck on your future endeavors
I'm checkin out of the race
I'll see you whenever
One last guilty embrace
'Cause you be scheming
You take my feed yap
You be scheming
No take mine for a fool no way
'Cause you be scheming
You take my feed yap
Girl you be scheming
No take mine for a fool no way [x2]
