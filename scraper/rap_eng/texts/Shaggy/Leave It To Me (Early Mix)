Uh-huh, now this one goes out to my lady
I want me and you to go on this wonderful love rendezvous, baby
One on one, give you a little love escapade
You know what I'm saying? Mr. Lover
Candlelight dinner for two, just me and you
Under the moon, sailing on a summer night cruise
I mean to rock your whole world, baby
I'm the man allowed to drive you crazy
Set the motion to the ocean 'cause some commotion
Girl, surrender to my love potion
I'll hit you off now with some hot oil lotion
I'm playin' it safe, so let me break out my Trojan
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, baby
And leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, baby
Now let me plan a day real fine
Hot tub jacuzzi, caviar with some white wine
That's right, I'm livin' livin' in style
Mansion in the hills and not another house for miles
Come, let me take you and show off my pet reptile
In two days I'm gonna feed to my rottwiler
No interruptions today
Leave it to me, I'm having things my way
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, baby
And leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, baby
'Cause I like the way you do the things you do
I wanna make sweet love to you
'Cause I like the way you do the things you do
I wanna make sweet love to you
I wanna send chills up your spine
And let you feel good inside
And explode just like a land mine
I'm here to conquer, thrill and that's my mission
Love-making with timing and precision
My skills is kickin' like quickin'
Proper lovin' leave you hummin'
Sweet melodies of future comin'
Prepare to get soaked in sweat, yeah, girl
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, baby
And leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, baby
'Cause I like the way you do the things you do
I wanna make sweet love to you
I like the way you do the things you do
I wanna make sweet love to you
Now this is for the lover in you
Dedicated now to me and my boo
Now this is for the lover in you
Dedicated now to me and my boo
