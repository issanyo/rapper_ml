[Intro]
My ladies!
HA, HA, HA, HA
You know you gotta run away
With me to the islands
HA!
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa
My sugar cane
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa
SUGARCANE

[Verse 1]
She said she's tired of the city life
Says she wants a simple life
Tell me she she need me
Want to settle down and be my wife
Introduce her to the island life
She says it everything that she likes
We bought some fruits from the fruit stand
Roots from the roots man
Coconut water well we get it from the jelly man
She had a piece of my sugarcane
From then she hasn't been the same

[Hook]
She says
No bright lights no fame
HEY!
Caviar or champagne
She wanna be a plain old jane
She likes the taste of my sugar cane
It ain't hard to explain
How this girl rocks my brain
She likes being a plain old jane
She likes the taste of my sugar cane
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa
She likes the taste of my sugar cane

[Verse 2]
Girl there ain't no substitute
Don't you worry about the loot
Wanna be a mommy ripe and ready for a couple youths
Forever on this island cruise
Tell me baby how can we lose?
She love the ackee and the salt fish
Yam from the market
Sweet cocoa tea or some real hot chocolate
But when she taste my sugar cane from then she hasn't been the same

[Hook x2]
She says
No bright lights no fame
HEY!
Caviar or champagne
She wanna be a plain old jane
She likes the taste of my sugar cane
It ain't hard to explain
How this girl rocks my brain
She likes being a plain old jane
She likes the taste of my sugar cane
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa
She likes the taste of my sugar cane
