(Na, na, na, na
Ooh, na, na, na)
Enrique and baby Serayah

[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
Wide awake, wake, wake 'til 6AM
(Time to work)
Let me make, make, make you come again
(Don't ya)
Keep it hush, hush, hush, don't tell no one
(Undercover Mister Lover yeah)
Got enough, 'nough, 'nough to turn, you on

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Baby just keep it our little secret
What they don't know won't do them no harm
We can do mouth to mouth with no speaking
We can see eye to eye in the dark

[Chorus: R. City]
Oh-oh-oh, don't you need somebody
Baby I wanna, I wanna know
To keep you up all night
Baby I'm at your, I'm at your door
Don't you need somebody
When I knock, when I knock open up
Your love can let me in
Oh, don't you need somebody
Baby I wanna, I wanna know
To keep you up all night
Baby I'm at your, I'm at your door
Don't you need somebody
When I knock, when I knock open up
Your love can let me in
Na, na, na, na
Ooh, na, na, na
(Talk to them Serayah)

[Verse 2: Serayah]
Waited long, long, long to get your call
(And don't you need somebody around there)
You're alone-lone-lone you want me now
(I'm mister long night, stretch out the night)
I'mma run, run, run a red, red light
(I'm mister gonna love you up all night)
Then take it slow, slow, slow with you all night
(Talk to me)

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Baby just keep it our little secret
What they don't know won't do them no harm
We can do mouth to mouth with no speaking
We can see eye to eye in the dark

[Chorus: R. City]
Oh-oh-oh, don't you need somebody
Baby I wanna, I wanna know
To keep you up all night
Baby I'm at your, I'm at your door
Don't you need somebody
When I knock, when I knock open up
Your love can let me in
Oh, don't you need somebody
Baby I wanna, I wanna know
To keep you up all night
Baby I'm at your, I'm at your door
Don't you need somebody
When I knock, when I knock open up
Your love can let me in

[Verse 3: Shaggy]
Mister lover, lover, love you straight through the night
Girl me have to grip you I'll squeeze you tight
Cause I promise if you let me go I'm gon' do you right
If you let me in I won't let you out my sight
You're sweeter than a honeycomb
Girl I wanna be the man to take you home
I will listen, tell me anything that you like
Hope you keep your body running 'til the daylight

[Chorus: R. City]
Oh-oh-oh, don't you need somebody
Baby I wanna, I wanna know
To keep you up all night
Baby I'm at your, I'm at your door
Don't you need somebody
When I knock, when I knock open up
Your love can let me in
Yeah cao
