Move to this let me see you jump and twist
Pump ya fist cause you know its hard to resist
That how know you rolling with the love specialist
Feel the vibe babe put the groove in ya hips
The night is young so let's roll with the fun
Ya got some gum take it out gimmi some
Cause I'm about to play on old girl like a drum
She be Shaggitized before its all said and done

Shake it up all night
Careful with that thing before you hurt somebody

Lets dance lets shout shake your body down to the ground
Lets dance lets shout shake your body down to the ground
Lets dance lets shout shake your body down to the ground
Gotta halla to my fellas who be hanging by the bathroom door
Waiting for the honeys as the leave the dance floor
That's right you got the digits , you all ready for the score
Now who the dog, you the one that's on all four
Come on I got to get this party to a new height
Keep it tight ain't got no time for no fight
You wanna be a player better know to do it right
Careful of the honey under the disco light
Girl What you Gonna do with all that body
Shake it up all night
Careful with that thing before you hurt somebody

Lets dance lets shout shake your body down to the ground
Lets dance lets shout shake your body down to the ground
Lets dance lets shout shake your body down to the ground
Lets dance lets shout shake your body down to the ground
Take you where there's all night action
Dancing to the beat with a passion
Mr. Lover Party is happening
Doing anything you Imagine ( repeat )
Chorus
So Baby baby mek me see you move your body pan the dancehall floor
Gal wine just jiggle, shake it up give me more
Jerk chicken pan the Grill so make the Champaign pure
Girl don't be a drag I might show you the door
I like to see bodies baked and shaped
Draped in lace hugging a perfect shape
Girl local and out of state I got a couple of them in my gates ready to mate
Chorus
