Ain't seen no love like this
Never felt no love like this
I ain't seen no love like this, eh

It's all about love
(Love, love, love, love)
Sweet love
(Love, love, love, love)

A little more love
(Love, love, love, love)
I need your love
(Love, love, love, love)

Now as I wake up in the mornin', meet the risin' sun
You're on my mind throughout the day
Could hardly get things done
It's that love that you give comparison to none
Cupid gave me a shot from a loaded gun

There is no love like this I've ever seen her with
Love strikes, got me all believe it
Sweaty palm and the tearful eye
The thought of you brings me butterflies

It's all about love
(Love, love, love, love)
Sweet love
(Love, love, love, love)

A little more love
(Love, love, love, love)
I want your love
(Love, love, love, love)

I know I'm far from perfect, that's to my dismay
You complain that I'm so stuck in my ways
Insecurity is what I seldom display
It's unexplainable that love I feel for you each day

I told enough lies, it's amazin' that you're still with me
Most times my conscience gets the best of me
All the skirts that I used to chase
No one else can ever take your place

It's all about your love
(Love, love, love, love)
Sweet love
(Love, love, love, love)

I need your love
(Love, love, love, love)
Sweet love
(Love, love, love, love)

(Love, love, love, love)
It's hard to conceal it
(Love, love, love, love)
I need to reveal it

(Love, love, love, love)
It's hard to conceal it
(Love, love, love, love)
Yeah, yeah

It's all about love
(Love, love, love, love)
Sweet love
(Love, love, love, love)

A little more love
(Love, love, love, love)
I want your love
(Love, love, love, love)

A little more love
(Love, love, love, love)
Your sweet, sweet love
(Love, love, love, love)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My woman, my woman
