(Shaggy talking:)
Closest to me she must be a good child?
Dont ignore the signs, thats right
You be her teacher,, taking

(Shaggy verse 1:)
Shivering she awakes in the cold sweat
Terrified so she speaks under her breathe
Makes a fake cry for help, shes a real mess
Thats the sign of the stress
Ma, listen to her
Heartbeats working overtime in her chest
Scared stiff from approaching footsteps
Ignoring the stains on her torn dress
Come now ma, listen to her

(Shaggy hook:)
How could you put your own child in danger
And turn around and take the words of a stranger
You didn't wanna face the facts so you blamed her
Too late ma, you should have listend to her

((background vocals) chorus:)
Gone, shes asleep, finally, shes at peace, the angels, gone, out of reach, finally, soon to meet, the angels

(Shaggy verse 2:)
Shes fading like a delicate flower
Try to wash away the shame in the shower
Defending him left her feeling overpowered
You were wrong ma, you didn't listen to her
It was there in the words of a letter
Have you read that maybe things could be better
You let her down and I won't let you forget her
Save ya tears ma, you should have listened to her

(Shaggy hook:)
How could you put your own child in danger
And turn around and take the words of a stranger
You didn't wanna face the facts so you blamed her
Save ya tears ma, you didn't listen to her

((background vocals) chorus:)
Gone, shes asleep, finally, shes at peace, the angels, gone, out of reach, finally, soon to meet, the angels
