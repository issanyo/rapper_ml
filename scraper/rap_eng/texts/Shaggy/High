[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Girl, you oughta to charge for all the love you give
Take away the negative and bring the positive
And I'm not really much of a scientist
But I can try and explain what the science is

[Pre-Chorus: Shaggy]
Right on time every time, every time, baby
Don't disappear into the night, baby
Just give me that time every time, baby

[Chorus: Demarco]
Girl, your loving got me looking down on Earth like it's goodbye
Just you go the above and bring me on the get skies
I swear there is no limit to your loving, that's no lie
I got a thousand reasons why, your loving gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
I am somewhere up in the atmosphere, outer space, any reason
I just like how you hold me down and lift me up, girl, just believe it

[Pre-Chorus: Shaggy]
Right on time every time, every time, baby
Don't disappear into the night, baby
Just give me that time every time, baby

[Chorus: Demarco]
Girl, your loving got me looking down on Earth like it's goodbye
Just you go the above and bring me on the get skies
I swear there is no limit to your loving, that's no lie
I got a thousand reasons why, your loving gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high

[Bridge: Shaggy]
You keep me up, girl, when I'm feeling down
I dictate to your love, I'm needing it now
'Cause you got me high, way up high off the ground
Come down, come down
If you agree, I will sound
And if I announce, I don't wanna be found
Your love got me high, way up high off the ground
Come down, come down

[Chorus: Demarco]
Girl, your loving got me looking down on Earth like it's goodbye
Just you go the above and bring me on the get skies
I swear there is no limit to your loving, that's no lie
I got a thousand reasons why, your loving gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
Gets me high, gets me high
