[Intro: Shaggy]
Now this one goes out to the father
For shower of good blessings
Right now I gotta give thanks
And praise most I

[Chorus: Ky-Mani & Shaggy]
Thank you Lord for what you've done for me
To the Father I say
Thank you Lord for what you're doing now
I go down on my knees and pray
Thank you Lord for every little thing yeah
Thank you Lord for now you made me see
Sing along, sing along

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Now when I look back in the days of all the sweat and
All the dues I paid
I go down on my knees and pray
And give thanks to the Father for the blessings that he shined on me
I sing a little song of praise
Though I know that everybody ain't as fortunate as I may be
One more time I say
Words cannot express appreciation what he's done for me
Right now I say thank you Lord

[Chorus: Ky-Mani & Shaggy]
Thank you Lord for what you've done for me
