(Got to let you know)
(The world is one big yard)
(Let the ladies of the world know)
(Let's give thanks to the lord.)

No one stops to smell the roses
There's just too much going on
Wish we'd only stop to notice
That the writing's on the wall

I can hear the people talking
Longing for them olden days
We can choose the path we walk in
If we will only change our ways

We are the one's (Chorus)
Easily we point the finger
Always someone else to blame
We can't always be a winner
That's the nature of the game

One by one we'll make a differnce
There's no effort that's too small
Lets decide to go the distance
And change the writing on the wall

We are the one's (Chorus)
We are the one's
Who make this world whole again
We are the one's
Who make this a home
Again
