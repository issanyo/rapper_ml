[Intro]
My dream, my dream
My, my , my
Dream ha he
Dream ha he
Now I got to wonder if you dreaming or not
'Cause everything seems so real
Shaggy (cha)

[Verse 1]
As my days grow old and my night grow cold
And I yearn for your tender love
My desires are strong I can't seem to hold on
And I wanna feel your touch
Girl I love you so much it's way pass a crush
And they fantasy feels real
And when reality bites it cut likes a knife
And I wake up asking myself

[Chorus]
Is it really real or is it a dream?
Is it really real or is it a dream now?
Is it really real or is it a dream?
Is it really real or is it a dream now?

[Verse 2]
Hear me now
Girl you know sexy that you have it all together
Tickle up me fancy with you sweet smelling feather
Smooth like a silk you could be rough like a leather
Don't wake me up I want the moment to last forever
(Ha) time goes by you know my loving gets better
Passionate moment probably think I would a never
Have you in a mi thoughts girl you sit down and you wonder
Girl let this one last forever

[Chorus]
Is it really real or is it a dream?
Is it really real or is it a dream now?
Is it really real or is it a dream?
Is it really real or is it a dream now?

[Verse 3]
As I reminisce on the times I missed
And the warmth of your tender lips
I can't help but wonder if I wake
Will I find a love like this (yeah, yeah)
I guess it's fair to say that
You are the woman in my dream
Well that's the word or haven't you heard
Why don't you get up and help me sing

[Chorus]
Is it really real or is it a dream?
Is it really real or is it a dream now?
Is it really real or is it a dream?
Is it really real or is it a dream now?

[Verse 4]
Hear me, hear me
Is it a figment of my imagination
Or that me under sexual frustration
Right now me under nuff aggravation
Can't show it must protect man reputation
Now this is something I must ask a question
I would a really like ta know your intentions
In regards to my infatuation
Tell me 'bout the operation

[Chorus]
Is it really real or is it a dream?
Is it really real or is it a dream now?
Is it really real or is it a dream?
Is it really real or is it a dream now?
