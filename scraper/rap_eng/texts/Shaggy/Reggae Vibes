Let's hear a reggae vibe, yeah, yeah
This one called the change of style
Shaggy style, let me say

Life ah be under pressure
The only way to relieve the stress is musical pleasure
Sometimes I feel like I'm alone
'Cos everyday I wake up it's the same old, same old world

Gotta get some vibes to get my feelin's fixed
In the mornin', aye
Gotta get some vibes to get my feelin's fixed
Down in the evenin'

'Cos reggae the vibe relieve me of my sorrows
It's on the rise, the music of tomorrow
I gotta realize that it's the only thing that keeps me safe
Oh, gosh

Reggae the vibe relieve me of my sorrows
It's on the rise, the music of tomorrow
I gotta realize that it's the only thing that keeps me safe

Good mornin' Mr.Bassy, would you pluck those strings?
Could you play me a line for the song that I sing now
Let reggae music flow, 'cos from the land of wood and water
Where the good times roll, now roll

Gotta get some vibes to get my feelin's fixed
Now in the mornin', aye
Gotta get some vibes to get my feelin's fixed
Down in the evenin'

'Cos reggae the vibe relieve me of my sorrows
It's on the rise, the music of tomorrow
I gotta realize that it's the only thing that keeps me safe
Oh, gosh

Reggae the vibe relieve me of my sorrows
It's on the rise, the music of tomorrow
I gotta realize that it's the only thing that keeps me safe

Reggae music got me on my toes
Reggae music feel it in my bones
Reggae music got me on my toes
Reggae music feel it in my bones

Well, now the music is a rockin'
And the bass is really droppin'
And the vibes is in the air
I feel it in the atmosphere

Wa, wo, yeah, wa, wo, yeah
Wa, wo, yeah, wa, wo, yeah

'Cos reggae the vibe relieve me of my sorrows
It's on the rise, the music of tomorrow
