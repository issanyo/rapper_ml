[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait in vain, to love you
Can't wait to give you me last name
Don't make me wait, don't make me too long girl
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love you, to love you
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love you, to love you
A wah mi say

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
It didn't take me long to fall in love with your mind
And I won't even mention the way your body perfectly design, so fine
And judging from your outlook on life, I knew this would be more than just one night
But now I'm ready for the next level and you're telling me you need more time, no crime
Nothing wrong with waiting a little bit, yuh know this is more to me than just hittin' it
But only get a love like this once inna life time and if this is our chance I ain't missing it
My whole life I never felt like this, just wanna run where I don't wanna fight this
I ain't rushing yuh to make up yo mind, just wanna put some more quality in a we time
Come on, girl

[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
I can't wait no fi love ya
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you

[Verse 2: Sting]
I don't want you to think I'm rushing you
I know you like to take your time (time, time, time)
I'm already sold by the idea, of you and I
Just tell me where I need to sign (sign, sign, sign)
'Cause I've been searching for a while, girl
And I know what works for me (oh, oh)
All I need to know if this is what you want, girl
'Cause I'm already where I need to be, so don't make me wait

[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
I can't wait no longer
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love, to love you
Fi wah

[Bridge: Shaggy]
You don't wanna rush and I don't wanna take my time
I'm putting everything on the line
They say that true love's hard to find
I'm ready now to make you mine

[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
Don't make me wait
Baby, now, baby, now, don't make me wait
You gotta say yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't make me wait
Baby, now, baby, now, don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
