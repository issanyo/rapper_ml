Uhu, baby give it to me gal yeah
Uhu, there is sexy gal there
I love the woman don't you act nice
Don't you make me have think twice
Baby girl I'm loving you once
But I be paying the price
Tell me I'm the only one
Talk to me girl, the only one
A woman say, never felt a loving like this
You remind me of my first kiss
Girl you ... with the nicest
I been sitting around to reminisce
Oh you used to love me from a distance
... with persistence
... with a response
Anyways you never put on my resistance
I already know you never change your ways
I'm familiar with the things you play, baby
Just keep saying I'm the only one
I'll pretend that the lies are fun
Lie to me baby
Won't you just lie to me baby
I already know
You gotta try for me baby
Why don't you lie to me baby
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me I'm the only one
Keep feeding me lies, I already know

You don't realize ...
When you ready to reload
...when she follow...
Ready for fi explode

If you need the love and the affection
...I'll be the next man
Girl just keep saying I'm the only one
I'll pretend that the lies are fun
Lie to me baby
Won't you just lie to me baby
I already know
You gotta try for me baby
Why don't you lie to me baby
And tell me I'm the only one
Tell me I'm the only one, the only one

... with persistence
... with a response
Anyways you never put on my resistance
