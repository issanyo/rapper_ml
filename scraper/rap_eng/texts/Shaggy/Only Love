[Intro 1: Pitbull]
Shaggy
(Yo it's Pitbull)
Mr. Worldwide
Let's show the world how powerful love it
(Now we spread love around the world)

[Intro 2: Gene Noble]
Round and round and round we go
Waiting for the wind to blow
As we walk this world alone
Only love can bring us home
Waving powerless and blind
But tomorrow, we'll be kind
Let love guide us through the rain
Forget our yesterday

[Hook: Gene Noble]
Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Only love can conquer all and move mountains
When you cold, only love makes you warm again
Only love heals a broken heart, we been through
It all girl, came through the storm again
Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free
I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me
Forever in my eyes, you will always be the one for me
I'll always love you until they read out my eulogy

[Hook: Gene Noble]
Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Love heals all, love kills war
I love the hustle but I love you more
Ride or die that's what love is for
Believe it or not, God loves us all
When I was down and out
You were down with me
Things got deep, you'd drown with me
If there was heat, I know you'd cock back
Click, clap, spit a round with me
Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me
To all them haters, they can come get and me
It's us against the world, 150 I love Miami
That's my city, 305
It's all good, all good
Love is love, love is love
Shaggy, Pitbull, dale
It's all on us

[Hook: Gene Noble]
Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever

[Outro: Gene Noble]
Round and round and round we go
Waiting for the wind to blow
As we walk this world alone
Only love can bring us home

[Hook: Gene Noble]
Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever, babe
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
