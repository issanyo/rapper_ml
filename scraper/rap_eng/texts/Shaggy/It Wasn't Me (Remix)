Shaggy, Cartel remix
Nucci Rayo
Now picture this I'm bucknaked on the bathroom floor
Hittin' Aaliyah raw, Henney-ed up, Mya seen it all
Same reason Kim and Foxy ain't speakin' no more
And why Britney and Christina didn't speak at the awards
Keys in the door, I heard a noise
I didn't get up
Next thing you know Destiny's Child split up
But yo I'm Cris-ed up, got Monica in Miami
Soon as Kobe get married
I'll be back with Brandy

[Shaggy]
How you fi hav yuh woman access a yuh villa?
Trepass and a witness up inna 'you pilla
Yuh betta watch your back before she turn into a killa
Interview the situation or she call The Gleaner
To be a true playa you fe know how fe play
If she say a nite, convince her seh a day
Never admit to a word wat she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, baby no way

1 - [Nucci](Shaggy)
Yo but she caught me on the counter
(It wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa
(It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower
(It wasn't me)
I even had her in the Range Rover
(It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my should
(It wasn't me)
And here's the words that I told her
(It wasn't me)
She heard the screams gettin' louder
(It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

2 - [Richard "Rikrok" Ducent]
Honey came in and she caught me redhanded
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both buck naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

[Shaggy]
Mek she know seh, dat she neva hav' no right fe vex
A never yuh seh see, a mek the gigalo flex
A somebody else whey favor yuh in de complex
See is believing so yuh betta change yuh specs
Yuh know she a go bring a whole heap a tings up from de past
All the likkle evident you betta know fi mask
Quick pon yo' answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, yuh know yuh betta run fast

Repeat 1

[Wiz Dinero]
Uh-huh that's my story and I'm stickin' to it
What you seen and heard, I ain't admitting to it
It wasn't' me, you wanna call me liar, flattin' my tires
Seein' how you play goin' through my two way
You wanna tear my Polos
I can't stand it when you rig up them four doors
From Miami, me and Shaggy in the Caddi
Plus mami with the fatti
Told me, meet her backstage
Talkin' bout she need it badly
I never met her, never seen her
What you talkin' bout?
Bathroom tryna catch us when I'm walkin' out
Dressing room on the floor, on the table too
I'm telling you it wasn't me, it was Don Pooh

Repeat 2

I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me

Repeat 2

I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me
