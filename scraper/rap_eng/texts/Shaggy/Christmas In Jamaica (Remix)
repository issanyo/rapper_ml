[Intro: Toni + (Shaggy)]
(Toni Braxton) Mr. Boombastic
(Just call me Santa Claus
I think we should make this a Jamaican Christmas, girl)

[Verse 1]
Lovers frolickin', playin' in the sand
Got my Coppertone, getting on my tan
Exotic setting for a lady and her man
A perfect little holiday, sounds like a plan
We can stay in bed all afternoon
We can make out to some cool reggae tunes
We can sail under the light of the moon
Wish we could freeze this moment
Then it wouldn't end so soon...

[Chorus]
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...

[Verse 2: Toni Braxton + Shaggy]
Unplug the phones, y'all
Don't need no calls
No callin' home
Take a break from it all...
'Cause we both grown and we can do whatever, see?
Baby, it's just you and me, let's live out a fantasy
Hiking in the mountains, romantic rendezvous
Bathing in the fountains, stop-let me look at you
Just in case you're doubtin', let me paint a view
Picture you're in heaven, everything is true

[Chorus]
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...

[Verse 3: Shaggy]
It's Christmastime, let's catch the vibe (just come on, come on, girl)
I'm rockin' you Jamaican style (just come on, come on, girl)
'Cause we can chill here for a while (come on, come on, girl)
Baby, it's just you and me, come on, come on, it's a fantasy

[Bridge: Toni + (Shaggy)]
Dah-dum, dah-dum-dah-dah, dah-dum-dah-dah
Dah-dum-dah-dum-dah-dum-dah-dum-dah-dum
(Just come on, girl)
Dah-dum, dah-dum-dah-dah, dah-dum-dah-dah
Dah-dum-dah-dum-dah-dum-dah-dum-dah-dum
(Toni Braxton, Shaggy, come on, come on, it's a fantasy)
And I'll be having so much fun...

[Chorus]
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...

[Interlude: Shaggy + (Toni)]
You know, when it comes to this Jamaican lovin'
It's, ah, I'm an all-nighter, girl (Come on, come on, girl)
Yeah girl, it's an all-nighter
Ah, sing to me, girl (Don't you know...)

[Chorus]
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail...
