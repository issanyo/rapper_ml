[ Intro: Shaggy]
Sexy, hot!
I love your style girl
Put it on me
Brian and Tony Gold let the ladies know
They got it goin on
Uh! Shaggy!!

[Chorus: Brian And Tony Gold (Shaggy) ]
Hey sexy lady, I like your flow
Your body's bangin', out of control! (Uh!)
You put it on me (That's right) ceiling to floor
Only you can make me scream and beg for more!

[ Verse 1: Shaggy]
Her body's callin, bawlin'
Got me crawlin' up the wall and
My size ain't small, it's tall
And catch a glimpse her clothes be fallin

Her neighbor's callin, bawlin
All this noise is so appallin'
They must believe we're brawlin'
Headboards bang till early mornin'

[Chorus: Brian And Tony Gold (Shaggy) ]
Hey sexy lady (Uh!!) I like your flow
Your body's bangin' (Yo) out of control!!! Yo! (A big tune)
You put it on me (Uh!!)) ceiling to floor (Ceiling to floor girl)
Only you can make me (Uh) scream and beg for more!!!

[Verse 2: Shaggy ]
I was her father's choosin'
Performance left her snoozin'
Rug burns her knees we're bruised and
She's hooked ain't no refusin'

[Brian And Tony Gold: ]
I knew it all along (Uh!)
She was the perfect one (What!!!)
She really put it on (On me)
I had to write a song

[Chorus: Brian And Tony Gold (Shaggy) ]
Hey sexy lady (She's drivin me nuts)
I like your flow (Uh! Uh!)
Your body's bangin' (Sexy Lady) out of control!!! (Sweet and nice)
You put it on me (You know you got that figure)
Ceiling to floor
Only you can make me (Wow)
Scream and beg for more!!!

[Verse 3: Brian And Tony Gold]
Hey sexy lady you be fine, drive me crazy
Movin' on, and on, and on
Hey sexy lady you be fine, drive me crazy
Movin' on, and on, and on

[Shaggy (Brian And Tony Gold) ]
Gal you're extra sexy like (Whoa)
And you make me wanna say (Hi)
When you shake, you shake it down (Low)
Gal you wicked to rahtid nah (Lie)
Gal I like the way how you (Flow)
Everytime you passin' me (By)

And you wicked to rahtid nah (Lie)

[Chorus: Brian And Tony Gold (Shaggy)]
Hey sexy lady (Uh!) I like your flow (Whaddat)

Only you can make me (Only you) scream and beg for more!!!
