Yo this one goes out to all my immigrants, you hear
Live up, don't give up

Wait a minute let me set the record straight
You need to listen for a moment or two
Hear the accent, don't get it twisted
My momma didn't raise no fool
Though you think that you got me figured out
When you really haven't got a clue
So take a lesson from this island boy
This coconut may be smarter than you
So i say

*Chorus*
Don't judge me
You dont know me
Don't think I'm some small town phony
Got nothing, up on me
You ain't walking in my shoes
I'm just one out of many
Hailin from a third-world country
Got nothing, up on me
You ain't walking in my shoes

Learnt my lesson from my humble beginnings
And I wouldn't have it no other way
Became a man in the street of Kingston where
Survival was the art of the day
I choose the best as my main competition
And I'm always on top of my game
So don't be blinded by my race or my gender
Coz we're realy all one in the same
So I say

*Chorus*
Don't judge me
You dont know me
Don't think I'm some small town phony
Got nothing, up on me
You ain't walking in my shoes
I'm just one out of many
Hailin from a third world country
Got nothing, up on me
You ain't walking in my shoes

No I won't stop
Gotta make it to the top
Hell no i won't stop
Aimin for the sweet spot
Powers to the bald heads and the dread locks
Let me make it clear
No we won't flop
Got a plan, got to make anyway I can
Putting in the work with my own two hands
Better check it, respect it
I'm a man, i'm a West Indian

Don't judge me
You dont know me
Don't think I'm some small town phony
Got nothing, up on me
You ain't walking in my shoes
I'm just one out of many
Hailin from a third world country
Got nothing, up on me
You ain't walking in my shoes

Don't judge me
You dont know me
Don't think I'm some small town phony
Got nothing, up on me
You ain't walking in my shoes
I'm just one out of many
Hailin from a third world country
Got nothing, up on me
You ain't walking in my shoes

(yeah, yeah, yeah)
