Shaggy, woof, Scooby
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
Weve got some work to do now
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now
Once again, Im 'onna fall
Once again, I find my back is up against the wall
Will somebody help me? Please hear my call
Or get a message to my dog and we'll be on the ball
'Cause everybody need a friend that they can depend on
Someone who could help them out of a situation
Only a friend alone can understand my pain
If only I could get some message to my Great Dane, Scooby
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
Weve got some work to do now
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Tell me, where are you
(Scooby-Dooby-Dooby-Doo)
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Tell me where are you
(Scooby-Dooby-Dooby)
Once again Im in a jam
Once again I never seem to ever have a plan
You know me I'm in trouble man, can you lend a hand
Right now, I am reachin' out to Scooby and the gang
Sure feels good to find a friend that you can lean on
And they wouldn't leave you if you say you saw a demon
And even though sometimes I am a little, little outta luck
And if I worry much I know my dog has got my back
And I know that even if it means hed have to fly like a bird
I know hell be here for me now and match my word
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
Weve got some work to do now
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now
Come on, Scooby-Doo
I see you, pretending down to shivers
You're not fooling me 'cause I can see
The way you shake and shiver
Scooby-Dooby-Dooby-Doo, Scooby-Dooby-Dooby
Even if it means hed have to fly like a bird
I know hell be here for me now and match my word
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Tell me, where are you
(Scooby-Dooby-Dooby-Doo)
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Tell me, where are you
(Scooby)
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
Weve got some work to do now

We need some help from you now
Come on, Scooby-Doo
I see you, pretending down to shivers
You're not fooling me 'cause I can see

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
