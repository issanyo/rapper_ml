Christmas in the island breeze pa ra pa pa pam
People lights and coconut trees pa ra pa pa pam
Laying on the island beaches pa ra pa pa pam
Here's some shining season ra pa pa pam
Christmas on our island
Let's have a jamaican christmas
Ra pa pa pam
When we come
Christmas in the city
Come on get along
Let me take you to jamaica ra pa pa pam
If you never been you are gonna be here long
Come on get your sugar king from mister lover man
Treat you like a honey... To your tongue
Underneath the mistletoe come on give me some
Rolling on this new girl, standing in the sun
So when you are ready take a trip to my island
Cause there is nothing like christmas in my island
I have been around the world and cross the globe
But I am always heading right back home for christmas

Can't fly a rein deer that's fiction
You may find santa claus that's not fiction
I don't know about elf and jack frost
On your girlfriend... Keep your socks off
So when you are ready take a trip to my island
Cause there is nothing like christmas in my island
I have been around the world and cross the globe
But I am always heading right back home for christmas
