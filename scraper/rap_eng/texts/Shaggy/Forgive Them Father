[Intro]
Them say money is the root of all evil
But a no money
Some people a kill people little or nothing
Some say them a gangster but a studio gangster

[Bridge]
Well now a gun shot lick and a marrow it fly
Little youth with the 45 and him say do or die
Now him muma she cry water run from her eye
And she remember when him was little bit and oh so shy

[Chorus]
Forgive them father cause they know not what they have done
To save them from destruction gave his only begotten son
Like them no understand say revelation a come so watch the heathen them a run

[Verse 1]
Too much fuss and fight(BOO)
And that is not right
You no can't blow breath in a man but still that you want take life
Innocent youth die bury a next guy
And him muma wool her belly and ask God why?
Well no ask me no question I tell you no lie
It's about time the world start to realize
This a revelation and it's a serious time
Put your a hand inna the air and pray to the most high

[Chorus]
Forgive them father cause they know not what they have done
To save them from destruction gave his only begotten son
Like them no understand say revelation a come so watch the heathen them a run
Cha

[Verse 2]
Youth man a beg and you fi put down your gun
Me no want fi see another youth tumble down
This is reality no play dumb dumb
Some a them a thing 'bout dollars having a large sum
Money is the root of all evil if so me no want none
Wicked man them a heathen fi them fire burn
Whole a them shall perish inna the wicked kingdom
This is Shaggy one of Jah Jah son

[Chorus]
Forgive them father cause they know not what they have done
To save them from destruction gave his only begotten son
Like them no understand say revelation a come so watch the heathen them a run

[Verse 3]
Yow! yow! yow! stop talking yow
Mislead the youth to shoot them one another down
Muma what this you're talking pure foolishness
Can't sit down eat me Sunday ackee and salt fish
Can't use me tounge and lick out me pyrex dish
As me sit down and a wish me mouth start get peckish
Have fi eat me dry bread and drink the water well quick

[Chorus]
Forgive them father cause they know not what they have done
To save them from destruction gave his only begotten son
Like them no understand say revelation a come so watch the heathen them a run

[Bridge]
Now a gun shot lick and a marrow it fly
Little youth with the 45 and him say do or die
Now him muma she cry water run from her eye
And she remember when him was little bit and oh so shy
Watch it

[Verse 4]
Youth man a beg and you fi put down your gun
Me no want fi see another youth tumble down
This is reality no play dumb dumb
Some a them a thing 'bout dollars having a large sum
Money is the root of all evil if so me no want none
Wicked man them a heathen fi them fire burn
Whole a them shall perish inna the wicked kingdom
This is Shaggy one of Jah Jah son

[Chorus]
Forgive them father cause they know not what they have done
To save them from destruction gave his only begotten son
Like them no understand say revelation a come so watch the heathen them a run

[Verse 5]
Too much fuss and fight(BOO)
And that is not right
You no can't blow breath in a man but still that you want take life
Innocent youth die bury a next guy
And him muma wool her belly and ask God why?
Well no ask me no question I tell you no lie
It's about time the world start to realize
This a revelation and it's a serious time
Put your a hand inna the air and pray to the most high
