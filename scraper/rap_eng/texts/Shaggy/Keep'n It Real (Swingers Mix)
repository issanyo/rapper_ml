Verse I
When I was young I used to dream of being rich
Having lots of houses and cars couldn't know which one was which
And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairytale life perfect without a glitch
You'd think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow there was a treasure chest
But sometimes having more is really less
Take a look inside yourself you'll realize you're really blessed

Hook

No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone that has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay you dues
Don't worry just push on through

Chorus

Keeping it real
Gotta big up all my people who be working on a future
Though they know they gotta struggle
Keeping it real
To all my hommes working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keeping it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
They're ain't no need for drowning in you sorrow
Keeping it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

Verse II
I never got to have myself the house the mansion and the Benz
I'm not the kinda brother who be making mad ends
I got myself a girl but we be kicking it as friends
It's not enough but maybe that depends, again
Not everything you want is everything you really need
The standard of society's motivated by greed
Are you prepared to follow tell me are you prepared to lead
So persevere and you'll succeed

Chorus

Bridge
All the harsh realities appear to come in twos and threes
Don't worry cause there'll be a better day
One thing I can promise you just keep on keeping on
I swear to you there' gonna be a brighter day

Repeat 1st Verse

Chorus
