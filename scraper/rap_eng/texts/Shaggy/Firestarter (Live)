[Verse 1]
You told me once, told me twice in a row
You were gonna leave me
That we were done, love story gone wrong
All because of me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't love enough to make us keep it up
And now you're on your way
You're taking your chance on love
Thinking that you're so tough

[Chorus]
Hoping I will be missing you and all I'll do is cry
Begging you to come back
But if you're gonna put a gun to my head
Better make sure I get dead
'Cause I'm a firestarter, I can turn water into flames
Don't put a gun to my head, unless you'll make me dead
'Cause I'm a firestarter
I'ma burn, I'ma burn 'til you're gone, gone, gone, gone, yeah
Firestarter, I'm a firestarter, hey
Firestarter

[Verse 2]
Ah, we go up, we go down, we go all around
But now you wanna keep it simple
No more play, no more running 'round town
All because of me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't love enough to make us keep it up
And now you're on your way
You're taking your chance on love
Thinking that you're so tough

[Chorus]
Hoping I will be missing you and all I'll do is cry
Begging you to come back
But if you're gonna put a gun to my head
Better make sure I get dead
'Cause I'm a firestarter, I can turn water into flames
Don't put a gun to my head, unless you'll make me dead
'Cause I'm a firestarter
I'ma burn, I'ma burn 'til you're gone, gone, gone, gone, yeah
Firestarter, I'm a firestarter, hey
Firestarter

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You told me once, told me twice in a row
You were gonna leave me
That we were done, love story gone wrong
All because of me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't love enough to make us keep it up
And now you're on your way
You're taking your chance on love
Thinking that you're so tough

[Chorus]
Hoping I will be missing you and all I'll do is cry
Begging you to come back
But if you're gonna put a gun to my head
Better make sure I get dead
'Cause I'm a firestarter, I can turn water into flames
Don't put a gun to my head, unless you'll make me dead
'Cause I'm a firestarter
I'ma burn, I'ma burn 'til you're gone, gone, gone, gone, yeah
Firestarter, I'm a firestarter, hey
Firestarter
