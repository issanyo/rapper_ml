[Intro: Shaggy]
It's a beautiful day
For me to rock around your way
Only when I see Sting

[Verse 1: Sting]
Sweet nightingale
Why do you wake me so?
Sweet nightingale
You're telling me something I don't know
It's quarter to three
Your singing, driving me right out of my tree
I'm so tired that I could weep
When all the other birdies are still fast asleep, yeah

[Chorus]
Morning is coming
Morning is on its way
Morning is coming
It's revelation day

[Verse 2: Sting]
Sweet Nightingale
We'll talk it over in the light of day
Why can't it wait?
I need my beauty sleep, whatever you say

[Verse 3: Shaggy]
Wake up, it's a beautiful day
Wake up, don't you hear what I say?
'Cause I be rocking in my shoes to this sweet reggae groove
Ain't nobody gonna spoil my mood
To this beautiful sunshine, I'm rising up
Just a positive vibe mi use and build me up
Overflowing like di hot coffee inna me cup
Ain't no time for easing up, yeah

[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
Morning is coming
Morning is on its way
Morning is coming
It's revelation day

[Verse 4: Sting]
Oh, nightingale
You broke a dream where I don't live on my own
Oh, nightingale
I look around but there's nobody home
Rouse yourself and get out of bed (Uh-huh)
And drag your comb across your sleepy head
Clean your teeth and wash your face
Look like you're a member of the human race

[Verse 5: Shaggy]
Wake up, it's a beautiful day
Wake up, don't you hear what I say
'Cause I be rocking in my shoes to this sweet reggae groove
Ain't nobody gonna spoil my mood
Now, mi say, morning time back to evening time
Dis a message wha mi use to uplift mankind
Whether you know how fi bubble or you know how fi whine
"Enjoy, it's a beautiful time"

[Chorus: Sting & Shaggy]
Oh, morning is coming
Morning is on its way
Morning is coming
It's revelation day
Morning is coming
Morning is on its way
Morning is coming
It's revelation day
