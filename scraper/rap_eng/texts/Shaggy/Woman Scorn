Yeah, I really love this, it's time to show you who di boss
Wake up, get up, wake up, here, whatchu got you skin out?
I know what she was doin here, I know what she was doin
You can't keep it in your pants, gimme so level now

So hard to believe that this is how my day begun
Woke to find I'm staring down the nossel of a gun
Palm begin to sweat, imagination start to run
How or where or when she find out, sent mi gi ya bun

You got my attention, baby, tell me what's the deal
Take your time to explain to me exactly how you feel
Just showing me your side to you I've never really seen
No need to brandish your steel

'Cause we been together so long
You no see say we relationship so strong
All this drama, now where did it come from?
Was so right, tell me where did it go wrong?

It didn't have to end up like this
I don't see why we can't work it out, despite this
Have me deya all a hope say you might miss
There's no reason for this permanent goodnight kiss

Before you pull the trigger just remember who I am
I'm the man who stuck to you when no one gave a damn
I'm the man who dust you off and make you live grand
A di same one whe father the pickney inna your pram

May have strayed a bit but you are still my number one
Done pick the ring you name de pon the wedding band
Wear me last name, officially your husband
So why you woulda wan spoil the plan?

'Cause we been together so long
You no see say we relationship so strong
All this drama, now where did it come from?
Was so right, tell me where did it go wrong?

It didn't have to end up like this
I don't see why we can't work it out, despite this
Have me deya all a hope say you might miss
There's no reason for this permanent goodnight kiss

Don't say a word, 'cause all that I've heard
Just can't explain why you think
I receive more that I deserve
Don't even try to sell me your lies
You were no good from the start
And I'm mad 'cause I just realized

Moral is a woman scorn, hotter than a firestorm
Never sleep, never calm, never heed to the warn
Made her angry now she gone, never shoulda mash her corn
Never witness from your born, devil in a woman's form

'Cause we been together so long
You no see say we relationship so strong
All this drama, now where did it come from?
Was so right, tell me where did it go wrong?

It didn't have to end up like this
I don't see why we can't work it out, despite this
Have me deya all a hope say you might miss
There's no reason for this permanent goodnight kiss
