SHAGGY

Let me hear you say, somebody say oh hoooo
A girl like you is like a brand new automobile Â… drive any man crazy
You passing around my avenue again baby
Your style is so repetitious it's about time Shaggy and Wayne Wonder start to get vicious

Wayne Wonder

Chorus:
Doing something different for a change
What a sexy body girl I have you in my range - SHAGGY
May not be sufficent but I'm doing just fine

SHAGGY

When we do it different baby-love it is together
She want a rub a dub lover have her under cover
When we do it different baby love it is together
She want a rub a dub lover have her under cover

Baby love I admire the way you move the way you groove
I love the way you dance even when you step upon my shoes
It's my dream to sweep you off your feet and take you on a cruise
A romantic intersection i'm just here to pay my dues

Never see a girl that I love this right
It's kinda wicked it's kinda wild
Taking it easy under cool profile
You're so smooth and you're so mild
I don't care what your friends may say
I'm going to love you any way
Because they don't know about those days
When you gave good love to me downstairs

Wayne Wonder

Chorus:
Doing something different for a change
What a sexy body girl I have you in my range
May not be sufficent but I'm doing just fine

SHAGGY

Girl I love you I got to confess
My heart skip a beat I feel the pressure in my chest
Girl the way you got me going I wonder if you god bless
Are you a cut above the rest here to put me trough the test
I wouldn't mind love you up and give you nothing less
Your coca cola figure in that skin tight dress
Hold me in your arms with so much tenderness
Hmmm girl you make me breathless

Wayne Wonder

Standing vision anywhere you go
Every living male want to sit in your row
I can't afford to miss this show
So I got to let you know
Don't you worry honey don't you fret
Want to be all over you like sweat
Room full of class not to mention you got taste
I need next to get into your place

Wayne Wonder

Chorus:
Doing something different for a change
What a sexy body girl I have you in my range
May not be sufficent but I'm doing just fine

SHAGGY

When we do it different baby-love it is together
She wanta rub a dub lover have her under cover
When we do it different baby love it is together
She wanta rub a dub lover have her under cover

The last time I say you all I got was a glance
I vow that day if I had another chance
I would (kiss) kill you with romance
I wouldn't even hesitate to make you jump and prance

Wayne Wonder
Standing vision anywhere you go
Every living male want to sit in your row
I can't afford to miss this show
So I got to let you know
Don't you worry honey don't you fret
Want to be all over you like sweat
Room full of class not to mention you got taste
I need next to get into your place

Wayne Wonder

Chorus:
Doing something different for a change
What a sexy body girl I have you in my range
May not be sufficent but I'm doing just fine

SHAGGY

Baby love I admire the way you move the way you groove
I love the way you dance even when you step upon my shoes
It's my dream to sweep you out your feet and take you on a cruise
A romantic intersection you don't know what path to choose
Electrify your love and blow your romance fuse
Anybody else you get you would definitely lose
Wayne wonder and shaggy we speaking the truth
