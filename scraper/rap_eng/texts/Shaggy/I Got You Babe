They say we're young and we don't know
Won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know, maybe that's true
'Cause you got me and baby I've got you

Baby, I got you babe, I got you babe
They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned our money's always spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a lot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got
Baby, I got you babe, I got you babe
I got flowers in the spring
I got you, you wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And when I get scared you're always around
So let them say your hair's too long
I don't care, with you I can't do wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb
Baby, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe
I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe
I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you babe
