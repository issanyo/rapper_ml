[Intro]
Now, when I'm trying to tell the truth, they always think that I'm lying
When I be trying to tell my girl that... her friend's trying to make moves on me
('Cause they probably are)
Straight offa that you think I'm trying to hit that
Yow girl, you know that ain't my steelo
(Whatever)
What's wrong yo? Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
First of all, give me a break (Why?)
That's not my style that ain't how I operate
She's the one who had step to me
Tell me that she wanna do me
She's your friend and she didn't hesitate
Honey dip be dropping' mad game in my ear
Even telling me she be without underwear (No what?)
I don't know even know why you trippin'
It's your girl who is kickin'
Tryin' to get me in a one-night affair
That's what you get for runnin' out your mouth
Talkin' to your friends lettin' all my secrets out
How I put it on in the' morn
Work you over 'til dawn
[?]
Don't even stand there looking all surprised
Didn't take long for them all to realize
Boo, that you needed a hand
Takin' care of your man
You should be happy that I didn't hit the prize (No you didn't)

[Chorus]
Your friend made a pass at me
No matter what I say, you just don't believe
You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it
But I didn't, now you mad at me
Why? (I can't believe this)
Wahhh, Your girlfriend step to me
No matter what I say, you just don't believe
You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it
Now you mad at me

[Verse 2]
Probably thought she was your friend (My best friend, damn)
Childhood buddies from the tender age of ten
Seems swapping dolls was a game that you both used to play
She probably thinks the same applies to men (Not my man)
See girl, you need to know what's goin' on
Cause I do believe that you got it all wrong
You will have no one to blame
'Cause you didn't stake your claim
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
That's what you get for runnin' out your mouth (So now it's my fault?)
Talkin' to your friends lettin' all my secrets out
How I put it on in the morn
Work you over 'til dawn
[?]
Don't even stand there looking all surprised
Didn't take long for them all to realize
Boo, that you needed a hand
Takin' care of your man
You should be happy that I didn't hit the fan (Whatever)
Why?

[Chorus]
Your friend made a pass at me
No matter what I say, you just don't believe
You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it
But I didn't, now you mad at me
Why? (I can't believe this)
Wahhh, Your girlfriend step to me
No matter what I say, you just don't believe
You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it
Now you mad at me

[Verse 3]
I know you think you really know her (Well I did)
Maybe now is the time you should try and think it over
Hey I ain't no Cassanova
But your friend is the one who be tryin' to win me over
Though you think you really know her
Maybe now is the time you should try and think it over
Yo, I ain't no Cassanova (Damn right)
But your friend is the one who be tryin' to win me over

[Chorus]
Your friend made a pass at me
No matter what I say, you just don't believe
You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it
But I didn't, now you mad at me
Why? (I don't believe this)
Wahhh, Your girlfriend step to me
No matter what I say, you just don't believe
You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it
Now you mad at me
