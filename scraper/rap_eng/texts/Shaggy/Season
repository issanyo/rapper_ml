[Intro: OMI & Shaggy]

Season
Right fi every season forget you dont need no reason
It's Mr. Lover

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Girl you must be sent from above
You keep me warmer than a winter glove
Your smile colorful like flowers in the spring
So me haffi make a toast to ya ting, ting, ting
I never meant to fall for your love
I know you're all I'm thinking of
This is more than a summer fling
It's only right that I put on the ring, ring, ring

[Chorus: Omi]
So, baby you left my side
I won't be okay
Like it's the last time
Love me right through every season
There ain't no reason you can't stay
Right through every season
Right through every season
Right through every season

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2: Shaggy & Omi]
Girl, you bring me up just like the sun on the horizon
And even when it rains I'm enlightened
Oh you're so sexy yuh waist a swing
I'm in love watching when you do your ting, ting, ting
Girl, you make me heart skip a beat
And any time you no near me, me no sleep
Feel like the leaves when they drop off the limbs
Me can't lose you so me put on the ring, ring, ring

In a world, in a world without, without your love
I don't think I'd be able to breathe
Out of memories when I should be dreaming

[Hook]
So, baby you left my side
I won't be okay
Like it's the last time
Love me right through every season
There ain't no reason you can't stay


[Pre-Chorus]
Right through every season
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every..yeah
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every..yeah
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every..yeah

Right through every season
Right through every season
Girl you always on my mind
Right through every season
I'll need you 'till the end of time
Right through every season

[Closing]
You're the apple of my eye
Woman you make me feel like I could fly
There's nothing out there that I could buy
That's better than you and I (Shaggy!)
Season
Right through every season

[Instrumental break]

Baby girl you make me sing
