I come home in the morning light
My mother says "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mother, dear
We're not the fortunate ones
And girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh, girls
Just wanna have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy, dear
You know you're still number one
But girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh, girls, just wanna have
That's all they really want...
Some fun...
When the working day is done
Oh, girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh, girls
Just wanna have fun...
Girls
They want
Wanna have fun
Girls
Wanna have
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh, girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh, girls
Just wanna have
That's all they really want...
Some fun...
When the working day is done
Oh, girls
They wanna have fu-un
Oh, girls
Just wanna have fun...
Girls
They want
Wanna have fun
Girls
Wanna have
They just wanna
They just wanna...

Girls just wanna have fu-un...
When the workin'
When the working day is done
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh, girls...
Girls
Just wanna have fu-un...
They just wanna

They just wanna have fun...
Girls just wanna have fu-un...
