Chorus

Are you looking for a man to make you lose control?
A man who when you need a friend will fill that roll
Be a life blanket when you're feeling cool
Girlfriend this is your lucky day
They don't call me Mr. Lover coz I like ice cream
I am Mr. Lover coz I fulfill dreams
When last your man made you moan & scream?
Girlfriend this is your lucky day

Verse 1

Well, who's gonna take the heat?
A lot of fellows ___________ show indeed
But have you ever wondered why a woman will cheat
It takes a real man to make a woman complete
Fellahs out dere acting like their on speed
But slower can be better if you wanna succeed
Listen to your woman & ask what she need
Sometimes it can be better if u follow her lead

Chorus

Verse 2

You have a man
___________ that he's known
So if he's all of that
Then why are you on my phone?
Could it be that deep down you're feeling all alone
Something's telling me things aren't really great at home
You say you got a man
Well let's see what that means
Let's see, he pays your bills, he buys your stuff, you keep him clean
What does he tell you stuff to make you feel like a queen?
It takes more than money girl to feel like a queen

Chorus

Verse 3

Love making should be fun
The lady should be satisfied before you're up & done
Ladies if your man is one who love to jump the gun
Let him go & call me later
Let a real lover show you how it's done girl

Chorus
