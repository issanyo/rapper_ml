[Verse 1 - Massari]
I wouldn't have it any other way
If I could roll you, I'd be smoking everyday (Bad Man)
'Cause everytime you come around the way
All I seem to think about is you on top of me
Girl, pick up, damn you got me saying
When I feel the rush, I know you're taking over me (Bad Man)
Control it now, holding down the waist
Turn that thing around until you begging for a break

[Hook - Massari]
Say why oh, why oh, why (why oh)?
You got this thing about you
You don't even try (oh)
And they got nothing on you
Why oh, why oh, why (why oh)?
Girl when I get around you
I can't even lie
I want a bit of what you got

[Verse 2 - Shaggy]
Gal, if you take it all off
Then I wanna be a witness
Testify, case closed when me fixed it
Just a little time we a spend, make me invest
So, gimmie, gimmie all of the love plus the interest
Mister lover inna full control
So anything you want, my girl, let me know
Girl you body boom, it's time to explode
Just give me that access code

[Hook - Massari]
Say why oh, why oh, why (why oh)?
You got this thing about you
You don't even try (oh)
And they got nothing on you
Why oh, why oh, why (why oh)?
Girl when I get around you
I can't even lie
I want a bit of what you got

[Verse 3 - Shaggy]
Gal, me want you come this'a way, my direction
Don't deviate 'cause I don't see a next man
No choice, one candidate, no question
You get my vote, gal, you win the election
Main attraction, you star the show
So when me cast you, girl, me nah'go let go
And if your knees go past your elbow
That make my head explode

[Hook - Massari]
Say why oh, why oh, why (why oh)?
You got this thing about you
You don't even try (c'mon)
And they got nothing on you
Why oh, why oh, why (why oh)?
Girl when I get around you
I can't even lie
I want a bit of what you got

[Hook - Massari]
Why oh, why oh, why (why oh)?
You got this thing about you
You don't even try
And they got nothing on you
Why oh, why oh, why (why oh)?
Girl when I get around you
I can't even lie
I want a bit of what you got
