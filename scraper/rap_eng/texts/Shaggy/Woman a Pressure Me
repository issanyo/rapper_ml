True me love me sweetie pie I can't take it no more
Anyhow she get the ring you know me life gone now fi sure...yes

[Verse 4]
Before you tie the knot well everything looks sweet
Now she wash, she cook, she clean and keep your house sparkling clean
Keep her body in a shape young fresh and green
All when she a twenty five years when she a sixteen
When you say "I do" you probably think it's a dream
All at a sudden it's like the beauty turn in the beast
If a me you want marry let me put you at ease
I rather gone roam this place like them damn lego beast
Shaggy say:

Woman a pressure me left I man a linger
Say me naw get her till the ring deh pan her finger
Gal just a pressure me left I man a linger
She say me naw get her till the ring deh pan her finger
