Leo, Shaggy!
It's football, baby!
Everyday!

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
So let's play 'till the crowd get loud again
Hands up 'till we get loud again
So let's play this game we love
And enjoy the beauty of

[Post-Chorus: Leo Aberer]
What's all about them game
Go, let the sun shine, rain
Tell me what you feel
Come on, let's get real
Just one game, one love
That's all I'm thinking of
Let's get up, get out
As a beauty sky

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Football to the world embrace it
All my youth take enough the basics
We love it so we can't replace it
One ball, one field, so we boots, we lace it
One heart, one game, one love
Our sport what's we're well proud of
Gimme more skills than the push and shove
And enjoy the beauty of

[Chorus: Leo Aberer]

That's my life, everyday!
Football, baby!

What's all about them game

Tell me what you feel
Come on, let's get real
Just one game, one love
That's all I'm thinking of
Let's get up, get out
As a beauty sky

Ayy-o, football is my life

Everyday, hey-o, football is my life

[Outro: Leo Aberer]
Um, dois, três
O lema ao meu comando
Estamos passando e vamos jogar
Um, dois, três
O lema ao meu comando
Estamos trotando e vamos jogar
Football is my life!
