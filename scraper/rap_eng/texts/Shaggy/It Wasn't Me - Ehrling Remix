[Hook: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me redhanded
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna'
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, baby no way

[Bridge: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Hears the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
As the screams get louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see a make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seeing is believing so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident you betta know fe mask
Quick pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast

[Bridge: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)

Hears the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
As the screams get louder (Wasn't me)

[Verse 3: Rikrok]
Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listening to your reason
It makes no sense at all
People tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
