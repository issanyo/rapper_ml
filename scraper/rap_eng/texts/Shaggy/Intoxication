Yo, I like crazy hangover, yo
I think you put some'n in my drink

Listen gal, me nah ina nah freaky stuff
Me nah make no old woman come trip me up
Look, you send a naked woman and feel me up
Buy me drinks all night and booze me up

She take three shots and it nah loose her up
Say Shaggy drink 'cause a me boots are up
Every time she go sip she tipsy up
Bartender go slip and switch the cup

Listen, woman, me nah know about what you a think, gal
Feel like you put something in me drink, gal
'Cause you got me head stuck ina the sink, gal
And I can't remember last night

I ain't never gonna drink again
Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when
I had sex with my woman's best friend
Again I can't blame intoxication

Ain't never gonna drink again
Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when
I had sex with a girl I considered a friend
I can't blame intoxication

Gal, a bounce pon me bed like trampoline
And a shake up me hip like tambourine
And a dive pon the pool like submarine
Whips and shakes, eh gal, how that come in?

Gal a had me pon the bed and a tie me up
Position ina saddle and ride it up
Too much of one thing, gal, we glide you up
She just slip on me lap and slide it up

Listen, woman, me nah know about what you a think, gal
Feel like you put something in me drink, gal
Now you got me head stuck ina the sink, gal
And I can't remember last night

I ain't never gonna drink again
Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when
I had sex with my woman's best friend
Again I can't blame intoxication

Ain't never gonna drink again
Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when
I had sex with a girl I considered a friend
I can't blame intoxication

Baby mother pon the phone say she coming early
Flight lands at nine, now I eight thirty
How me ever explain 'bout her friend Shirley
Lipstick pon me pants and me shirt dirty

While popping adieus when the sun comes up
Wife in on my bed, all cozy up
Couldn't drink and drive so me sober up
Never want kill nobody pon the road, come up

Listen, woman, me nah know about what you a think, gal
Feel like you put something in me drink, gal
'Cause you got me head stuck ina the sink, gal
And I can't remember last night

I ain't never gonna drink again
Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when
I had sex with my woman's best friend
Again I can't blame intoxication

Ain't never gonna drink again
Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when
I had sex with a girl I considered a friend
I can't blame intoxication

I ain't never gonna drink again
Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when
I had sex with my woman's best friend
Again I can't blame intoxication

Ain't never gonna drink again
Before I take a sip I'm gonna think of when
I had sex with a girl I considered a friend
I can't blame intoxication

Can't blame intoxication
I can't blame intoxication
