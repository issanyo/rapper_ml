Aré, Donya dige kari ba man nadare (= Yes, the world doesn't care about me anymore)

Delam por az darde khoda dobare (= Oh, god! My Heart is full of pain again)

Age beri mano tanham bezari, baba dige baram farghi nadare (= If you leave me again, I really don't care anymore)

{Chorus}

OhO! D-d-d-d-Donya (= Oh, w-w-w-w-world! *Donya is also a female given name) *3

Maro dast andakhti! (= You pulled my leg!)
