(Chorus)
You’re gonna make me smile like I’ve never smiled
Love like I’ve never loved
Hold me like I’ve never been before
Gonna make me sing like I’ve never sang
Love like I’ve never loved
Hold me like I’ve never been before

(Verse)
Yea but girl you want my heart
Someone you’d even trade my soul
I’m calling my love and I’m the keys to open doors
I’m giving you my heart like I’ve never did before
Girl the loving where you give is seniorita and senior
Our love I really seen it
Calling, you hit me like I’m near
Loving is all you need, you are the wind inside my sail
I’m giving you everything until the smallest detail
Girl I’m never giving up because your love will never fail

(Chorus)
You’re gonna make me smile like I’ve never smiled
Love like I’ve never loved
Hold me like I’ve never been before
Gonna make me sing like I’ve never sang
Love like I’ve never loved
Hold me like I’ve never been before

(Verse)
Promise to never leave and girl you’re always by my side
Whenever that you leave me, hope we both swallow our pride
Even when the road is rocky, to what we align
Yes I believe I got, I’m gonna do what we assign
Yea yes I’mma get you, ‘cause all we have is time
Flawless and you’re such a… girl you’re so refined
Know that you’re my one and only, trust me every time
Always love to see you like our window’s gonna shine

Hold me like I’ve never been before

Oh oh oh oh
So tell what has gotten over me
She’s remarkable
This ain’t no ordinary love
