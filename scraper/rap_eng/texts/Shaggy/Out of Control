Di gal dem afi move quicker
Hanging with the city slicker
In the VIP dem know mi as the big tipper

A gal cya touch mi liquor
Unless she play wid mi zipper
Ga, I luv ya bumper sticker
But your girl friend thicker

Late at night, no matter the hour
Cyan wait fi get her up ina mi love tower
Root up her garden and a pick off she flower
Seh she wants a man who know fi conquer and devour

Well, right now, done she feel the love power
Afi do it again before we scour ina the shower
Bad man nuh bower, gal feel di plower
Afi drop her off before mi hit the rush hour

Gal, you drive the man dem crazy
Show of your body 'cos gal you no lazy
Every move that you make just thrill me
Course tonight I'm gonna drive Ms. Dazy

'Cos gal, you have the figure and bumper
Can leave before I get that number
You want a man with the some real hard lumber
Say the word I'm taking over

Wouldn't mind turn her inna mi next baby mother

Me alone she wha she nah settle fi another

Well, right away yuh man never hesitate
Dis ya big fish nah ignore the bait
Pon the first date, instant we mate
Hoffin and puffin, nuh romp fi gyrate
