Mystery gang, Mystery gang, Mystery gang gang (x4)

Just finessed the plug and now I'm sippin on his wok
Slurrin when I speak but your bitch still like how I talk
Call me wokkie talkie cause I stay this way all day
She ask, "How can I save your life?", but bitch, this ain't The Fray

My name is Shaggy
It's nice to meet you
They call me Raggy, but I will still shoot you
Why your pants baggy
Your mama still dress you
It's not the 90's, you got a few screws loose
How you rock Louis but still lookin stupid
Make your bitch love me but I ain't no Cupid
My family hate me cause I'm always zooted
I rap about drugs but they still blast my music

You is a doofus
You is so putrid
Stay out my lane less you wanna get wounded
You is excluded
You is diluted
That boy wanna fight, well be there or be cubic
I defy laws like I disobey Newton
I fight like a black belt, you can call me Putin
Was bound to be up bitch, there ain't no disputin
Don't fuck with my unit, we know we all shootin, computin these numbers, they stay risin up

Big buck huntin, like Cheif Compton, smoke some wraps and then pass out
That bitch love to call me Santa, she stay sittin on my lap, lap dancin, she stay prancin, she my Prancer, I'm her ganster, I'm her master, she wear Thrasher

But she don't skate, still go on dates, I'm no cheapskate, I'm never late
Took her out to dinner but that shit ain't only what I ate (ayeeee)

Mystery gang, mystery gang, mystery gang (x2)

Lil shaggy got no friends because he think that they all lame (Yup)
She think I wanna wife her, but she played like a board game (Sorry!)
That bitch left me on read but now she blowin up my phone (Sorry!)
She callin me nonstop sayin her parents are not home (Sorry!)

What the fuck up with that?
Bitch you got no racks
Hittin me up cause I got stacks
Still ran a full train on her tracks

I may like it in Alaska but best bet I have no chill
I would love to rob your guap but I'll still shoot you for the thrill
Ginger white boy, unsuspected, think I'm pussy, come and test it
On the come up, unexpected, find a beat, and I perfect it (aye)

Mystery gang, mystery gang, mystery gang
Mystery gang, mystery gang, mystery gang gang gang
Zoinks, mystery gang gang gang
Mystery, mystery, mystery gang (x2)
Gang, gang, gang, gang

Hahaha, that shit fire though
That shit fireeee!
