[Intro]
Finally (03)
Finally (you know I'm feelin' godly now)
DTB on the beat, that's bro
Just had my last episode
Season finale, you know what I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Finally got me a bag, finally got me the cash
Finally got me a bitch, finally got me the whip
Finally all of that shit, ayy
Finally, finally, finally, finally, ayy
Finally, finally, finally, ayy ayy

[Verse 1]
Finally got me a bag, finally got me the cash
Finally got me the swag, finally got me the bags
You know I'm smokin' that gas, ayy
Finally poppin' the tags, finally hittin' the mall
I Gucci'd all of my dogs, I'ma designer my drawers
And you know I'm finna ball, ayy
Finally got me a deal, fuck it, we poppin' them seals
Fuck bein' sober, finally poppin' them pills
Finally poppin' them pills, ayy ayy
Finally famous, finally stopped hatin'
Still screamin' fuck all the fame
Niggas be playin', bitches be playin'
I'm finna fuck up the game, ayy ayy

[Chorus]
Finally got me a bag, finally got me the cash
Finally got me a bitch, finally got me the whip
Finally all of that shit, ayy
Finally, finally, finally, finally, ayy
Finally, finally, finally, ayy ayy

[Verse 2]
You niggas work at the oil refinery, ain't where I'm tryna be
Niggas be findin' me, niggas be findin' me, niggas be findin' me, niggas be findin' me
Bill after bill, I got the ticket, I got the ticket, I got the ticket
I made a mil, I made a mil, I made a mil, I made a mil
I had to get it, I had to eat
Bitch they call me Greedy, ride in the streets
Bitch I'm a wolf, I'm a beast, I'm a creep
Ride with your bitch and your bitch is a freak
And she be geeked, made her turn the other cheek, suckin' me until he sleep
Lil Jon in the east, aw skeet skeet skeet, aw skeet skeet skeet, ayy

[Chorus]
Finally got me a bag, finally got me the cash
Finally got me a bitch, finally got me the whip
Finally all of that shit, ayy
Finally, finally, finally, finally, ayy
Finally, finally, finally, ayy ayy

[Outro]
Ooh, damn, damn damn damn
We like four freestyles in tonight, I don't know what the fuck goin' on, but
The wolf is a, the wolf is loose my nigga
The wolf is loose, ayy, ayy, ayy
