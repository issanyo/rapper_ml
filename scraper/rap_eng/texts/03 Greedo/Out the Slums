[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Lord, keep me away from these bums
Nick Cannon, rapping all out my drum
Ayy bitch, ain't no up next, I'm the one
2-2-3 shells all on my rug
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
This swamp water that I mixed with my mud
Fat daddies like I'm Ralfy the Plug
But it's the Ruler, fuck with me, gon' get slumped

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
White girl my princess, perfume smell like nail polish
Sell product, bailed out two times on one case and we still mobbin'
Heard that we seamless but guarantee won't tell 'bout it
Play games with this TEC and I'ma spit a couple shells out it
Nintendo Switch on this handheld
Mario Kart, watch the tail slide out
Brand new foreign car bought with my advance
Thinking you can see us, take another glance
I wear PP with Buscemi, treat that shit like Vans
My nigga Ralfy kickin' shit, board in his hands
Skateboard P with the grams
Diamond tester make Neptune sounds
Milkshake like Kelis how they dance
Leave that bitch in the field was the plan
Bowlegged with the three point stance
Bitch I'm a beast, yes I am
It's the wolf with the lamb chop
Now watch a ghost on your stage, stuck again
Here I am, here I am

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come

[Verse 3: Drakeo the Ruler]
Just hopped off IMO in my thug
They like Drakeo man you back on that bull
Duh bitch, don't you see all this mud?
Coupe abuser, don't you see all these guns?
Up in Bally Total Fitness where I make all my runs
Cold Devil, draggin' minks on the floor
Ain't nobody finna book me, ask these niggas, yeah they know
Get you whacked for these goodies and this Gladback on the floor
Yeah mister fucking Mose, pay attention to my quotes
I'm a menace, ask Dennis, man I'm sinister with arms
Brains missing in the orange, tryna get these lucky charms
Call of duty, yeah it's war, black opps on the floor
Drinking pints when I'm scorched, man these niggas know the score
How I pull up, have to blame Bin Laden for the Porsche
Drinking pints when I'm scorched, man these niggas know the score
How I pull up had to blame Bin Laden for the Porsche, the Ruler

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come
In Cavalli but I came out the slums
On Rodeo but I still got my drum
Thought I had life until I posted a dub
Man tell these niggas I'm as real as they come

[Outro: Drakeo the Ruler]
This shit, nigga, crazy, you know what the fuck it is nigga
Back on that shit nigga, yeah niggas thought I had life
Niggas wouldn't fuck with a nigga and all that
Haha nigga, what the fuck is you talkin' 'bout nigga
Check the scoreboard nigga, haha
Anyway, nigga
I'm a sore winner nigga
Like when I leave I take the scoreboard with me
