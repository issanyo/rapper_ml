[Chorus]
If I went down again
Would you get tired of it?
If I went down again
Would you get tired of it?

[Verse 1]
If I went down again
Would you fuck with my friend?
Would you spend all my ends?
Go broke, would you pretend?
If I went down again
Would you get used to it?
That's all that foolishness
That's all that losing shit
I always lose a bitch, yeah
No I ain't new to this
I always fall for hoes
It's nothing I don't know

[Chorus]
If I went down again
Would you get tired of it?
If I went down again
Would you get tired of it?
Tired of it, tired of it

[Verse 2]
If I went down again would you tag me on your timeline?
If I went down again can I blow you up like a hotline?
If I went down again and got bailed out then where we gon' hide?
If I went down again I just might text you on the south side
She said the same and then she opened up her mouth wide
She make a nigga wanna hit it when we outside
I'm doin' everything I know her mama won't like
Too gangster for her, she way too nasty for me
She think she gained it for em, she says you can't record me
She pull up when we horny
If I went down again, would you support me?
Ooh, if I went down again, if I went down again

[Chorus]
If I went down again
Would you get tired of it?
If I went down again
Would you get tired of it?
If I went down again, oh
Would you get tired of it?
If I went down again
Would you get tired of it, get tired of it
