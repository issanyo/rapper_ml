[Intro]
Yeah
(Nyne Six)
If I ever go broke
All day
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If I ever go broke I get money out these bitches
If I go broke I get bread out these bitches
Stay away from racks, I get cheese from the traps
[?]
If I ever go broke
Yeah
If I ever go broke

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Aw man, yeah
If I ever go broke I get bread off these hoes
If I go broke I get bread off these hoes
I guess she didn't want me, now I got to glow
Ran up 100 but still chasing more
Bad little chick buy the check she gon' go
She roll up the dough while I dough
She want a nigga that's popping
The ice that is [?]
Shawty want me to take her shopping, I'm like baby stop
I know the haters be watching
I grind like I ain't got no options and don't plan on stopping
All of my niggas is violent
Fuck with us, leave your ass silent
And no I can't stop 'em
[?] I'm Big Poppa
Baby get dough, I can't knock her
I ain't trying to lock her
Shawty, she know I be watching
Shawty, she know I be watching
I'm just being honest
Promise my chick be astonished
When I pull up in the whip shining in all that designer
Shawty your body like diamond
Look like she mixed with exotic
I knew I would find you
Baby, you know I'm the man
Call me the foreman, I'm really the man with the plan
I turn this bitch into a fan
And she made me rich, that's the plan

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If I ever go broke
Yeah
If I ever go broke
Yeah, yeah
If I ever go broke
If I ever go broke
If I ever go broke
If I ever go broke
Yeah, yeah
If I ever go broke I get rich off these bitches
Yeah
[?]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Been talking money so long I can't go broke
So strong I got the game in a choke hold
Squad switched, now I'm getting to it solo
I been getting out the mud, I ain't no joke
I got a problem spending hundreds and poppin' them tags
Keep the money in the dresser, the rest in the stash
Good everywhere I go, yeah they know me
Pulled up counting hundreds [?]

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
I came here with Casey, the bitches gon' hate me
They wish they could date me
Your bitch trying to rape me
I'm freestyling lately
My nigga in here smiling
All my niggas in here wilding
Turn it down, we so violent
[?] now I'm silent
Yeah
If I go broke
If I ever go broke
Bitch want no smoke
No you don't want no more
[?]

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
If I ever go broke
Yeah
If I ever go broke
Yeah, yeah
If I ever go broke
If I ever go broke
If I ever go broke
If I ever go broke
Yeah, yeah
If I ever go broke I get rich off these hoes
Yeah
