[Intro]
My lil homie caught a
My lil homie caught a homi
My lil homie caught a body
First night out
He don't, he don't want no crimey
Aye, he don't want no crimey

[Chorus]
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment
Solitary his confinement
Jail the only way you make it off this island
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment
Solitary his confinement
Jail the only way you make it off this island

[Verse 1]
Bitch, you gotta be from underground to understand this shit
Bitch, you gotta be from out of town to want to buy this shit
Bitch, you gotta be from out of bounds to want to try this shit
You ain't gotta beef with Jordan, down to be the flyest bitch
Hatin' won't work 'cause I'm workin' 'til I'm tired bitch
Bitch, you had to been to county jail to live to tell this shit
Prison saved my life 'cause I know I was supposed to die that year
Bitches want my life so they just started actin' hella weird
Niggas want my wife, that's not my wife, might fuck my other bitch
Don't you close your eyes, we stayin' woke like Donald Glover, bitch
Watch her snort a line right off the dick before she suck the dick
Suffocate the pillow talk, just hold it down and smother shit
They comparing me to Pac so I got on some walkin' shit
Shout out to my lil homies hittin' licks and flockin' shit
I be in the studio 'cause I don't do no talkin', bitch
If I wasn't rappin', still be Gucci'd down and choppin' bricks

[Chorus]
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment
Solitary his confinement
Jail the only way you make it off this island
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment
Solitary his confinement
Jail the only way you make it off this island

[Verse 2]
Bitch, who got the lean? Who got the xans? I need prescription shit
I'm from where we Crips will beef with Bloods and beef with Crips and shit
I'm from where before you get some kids, you get some sentences
I'm from where they spreading all the rumors and the sicknesses
I'm from where your favorite drug dealers might be witnesses
I'm from where some peoples caught on fire faking chemists
I'm from where they used to get the water with no fish and drip
I'm from where they treat a dead body like some fish 'n' chips
Eat your ass alive, you might get swallowed by a trinky bitch
She might look just like she is a model but got syphilis
I'm from where some bitches be more gangster than these niggas is
Half the time these killers really gay or really snitching shit
I'ma make myself a fuckin' general like [?]
Free my hitters, I could be in prison just like Ruthless is
I got extradited, I bailed out before you knew the shit
Fox was worried 'bout me, I was good but he the truth for this

[Chorus]
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment
Solitary his confinement
Jail the only way you make it off this island
My lil homie caught a homi
Caught a case, he caught a body
Compton courthouse with a crimey
Where they do the gangsters grimy
Undercovers on assignment
Solitary his confinement
Jail the only way you make it off this island

[Outro]
We on that ape shit
First 48 shit
Got the birds in
We okay shit
That building ancient
First 48 shit
A hundred birds
Real gracious
On my flights
I got them birds
That building ancient
Aye, First 48 shit
Ayy, ayy
