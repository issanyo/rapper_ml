[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
How does it feel to be ballin'?
(How does it feel to ball, how does it feel to ball?)
All of these bitches keep callin'
(All of these bitches call, all of these bitches call)
I'm out here gettin' my dollars (get it, get it)
Pimpin', no poppin' my collar (get it, get it)
How does it feel to be ballin'?
(How does it feel to ball, how does it feel to ball?)
All of these bitches keep callin'
(All of these bitches call, all of these bitches call)
I'm out here gettin' my dollars (get it, get it)
Pimpin', no poppin' no collar (get it, get it)
How does it feel to be ballin'?

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
How does it feel to banini me?
Get all the bread like a panini
Give me a road like the peavy
I get the coke and recede it
Hidden in the valley, sittin' in the alley
Lookin' like a Sally, sittin' in the alley
Drummer Gang, keep a hitter 'round me
Hit mob, we the new assailant
Kicking shit like a newer balance
You a killer, never knew about it
Niggas tired of the disrespect
Show me what you gon' do about it
White boy like Boomhauer
Got meds like Doogie Howser
Talk shit, shoot the dookie out him
Real crip, bring the Tookie out him
Kiddie shit, bring, the goofy out him
Holy shit, bring the coofy out him
Know them hitters who will shoot around me
I can do it with no crew around me
Tell lil mama I can do without her
Newest bitch, every newest out

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Ketchy the Great]
How does it feel to be ballin'?
(How does it feel to ball, how does it feel to ball?)
All of these bitches keep callin'
(All of these bitches call, all of these bitches call)
I'm out here gettin' my dollars (get it, get it)
Pimpin', no poppin' my collar (get it, get it)
How does it feel to be ballin'?
(How does it feel to ball, how does it feel to ball?)
All of these bitches keep callin'
(Gang, all of these bitches call, all of these bitches call)
I'm out here gettin' my dollars (gang, gang)
Pimpin', no poppin' no collar (gang, gang)
How does it feel to be ballin'?

[Verse 2: Ketchy the Great]
I just popped a gram of molly, servin' the thotty
Poppin' P's, breaking on exotic
Smokin' Gelato, hatin' bitch gotta pave my pockets
I'm not with nonsense
I be changed, drinkin' out my lane, you're not a goddess
I'm a god, ball, you can't block it, Glock with a stock equipped
Mop head niggas gettin' wicked, probably shot your bitch
Gang gang gang gang gang, knocking out your whip
We just tryna flex like Hulk Hogan when we hit the play
Spit on people's scriptures, fingers itchin', I need every penny
I just spent Ben Franklins 'til they dizzy, rankin' on your missus
Hey, she just wanna give me head, man that lil bitch trippin'
So wait, I won't get up in her head, I'm tryna break from chillin'

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
How does it feel to be ballin'?
(How does it feel to ball, how does it feel to ball?)
All of these bitches keep callin'
(All of these bitches call, all of these bitches call)
I'm out here gettin' my dollars (get it, get it)
Pimpin', no poppin' my collar (get it, get it)
How does it feel to be ballin'?
(How does it feel to ball, how does it feel to ball?)
All of these bitches keep callin'
(All of these bitches call, all of these bitches call)
I'm out here gettin' my dollars (get it, get it)
Pimpin', no poppin' no collar (get it, get it)
How does it feel to be ballin'?

[Outro]
Nine for nine, you know I'm fighting ninety-nine
Back for the nine nine and two thousand
We the new Cash Money
