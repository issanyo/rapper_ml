[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Would you love me if you know I liked these other hotties?
You're my possession, I possess you like a hottie body
I be goin' in every time I'm in her body
Hit my ricky fast life like I'm Ricky Bobby
Ayy, tell her take it nice
Beat that thang down, baby I don't want to fight
Ayy, get higher baby, take a flight
I won't spend a dime, baby you can spend the night
I was sniffing white, now I'm dripping white
I be living life, would you take it down, poppin' up like a Miller Lite
Some my bitches can't help, some my niggas white
Straight shooter, made you think you Steph Curry's wife
Klay Teezy, let a nigga splash in the night
Think I'm in love with my thottie
Maybe just for her body

[Chorus: ?]
Now would you, would you, would you mind?
If we ain't had to take it slow baby
Now would you, would you, would you mind?
Would you already know
I tell her wine up on me, yeah
Go down, ah, go down
And if she climb up on me, yeah
Then I'ma take her down, oh na

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo & ?]
Ride a nigga just like a Ducatti
Playboy like my name Carti
All day, we don't sip 'Cardi
Stack M's, no B like Cardi
Yeah, we came to fuck up your party
Greedo let me holler at 'em
We came to fuck up your party
Fuck up all your partying, uh
All these bitches getting naughty, yeah yeah
Baby tell me what you want, uh
I just want to take a couple shots tonight, yeah yeah
Do your body right and I just want to save your life
I just want to save a life, haha

[Chorus: ?]
Now would you, would you, would you mind?
If we ain't had to take it slow baby
Now would you, would you, would you mind?
Would you already know
I tell her wine up on me, yeah
Go down, ah, go down
And if she climb up on me, yeah
Then I'ma take her down, oh na

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
I'ma take her down
Baby came around
Treat her like an hashtag
'Cause I can't wait to pound
Treat her like an hashtag
'Cause I can't wait to pound
I'ma beat it from behind
I'ma put it in her ass
I'ma get her too fine

[Chorus: ?]
Now would you, would you, would you mind?
If we ain't had to take it slow baby
Now would you, would you, would you mind?
Would you already know
I tell her wine up on me, yeah
Go down, ah, go down
And if she climb up on me, yeah
Then I'ma take her down, oh na

[Outro: ?]
You gotta stop playing sides
Baby we can take a ride, ah ah, ah ah, yeah
