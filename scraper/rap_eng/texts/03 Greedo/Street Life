[Intro]
They be calling me by my fuckin' real name
Screaming all off the dope
Get the fuck up out of here
Whoa Kenny

[Chorus]
Mama said be in by the streetlights
I done fell in love with the street life
I didn't go to bed with a night light
I was too busy thuggin' outside
Mama said be in by the streetlights
I done fell in love with the street life
I didn't go to bed with a night light
I was too busy thuggin' outside
I don't need cable, I don't need cable (I don't watch TV)
I don't need cable, I don't give a fuck about the neighbors
I don't give a fuck about the dinner on the table, I can eat later
I don't need cable (I don't even need no PlayStation), ayy, ayy

[Verse]
Young street nigga with a handheld
Robbin' drug dealers for they Nextel
I could take you back to the sidekicks
I was solo dolo, no sidekick
Ooh, sidepiece
I ain't even talkin' 'bout a side bitch
I was in school with a nine piece
Bitch I dare the principal to talk shit
I'ma whip out on anybody
I was growing weed inside my closet
Had cocaine inside my locker
Had a Glock inside my pocket
At my prom I was the only nigga with a baby momma
Been having these pistols 'cause I been about the fuckin' drama, ayy

[Chorus]
Mama said be in by the streetlights
I done fell in love with the street life
I didn't go to bed with a night light
I was too busy thuggin' outside
Mama said be in by the streetlights
I done fell in love with the street life
I didn't go to bed with a night light
I was too busy thuggin' outside
I don't need cable, I don't need cable (I don't watch TV)
I don't need cable, I don't give a fuck about the neighbors
I don't give a fuck about the dinner on the table, I can eat later
I don't need cable (I don't even need no PlayStation), ayy, ayy
