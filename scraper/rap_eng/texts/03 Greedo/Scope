[Intro: 03 Greedo]
So I scope, so I scope
So I scope, so I scope
So I scope, so I- so I scope
So I, so I, so I scope
So I scope, so I scope
So I scope
So I scope

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
So I scope
And I don't like the way these niggas move, it's the approach
Niggas creep up on you in the dark road like a roach
I been in the trenches too long, gotta go
White brick, tan brick, like a yellow brick road
Purple zip, red zip, I got some more, who wants to pour?
We gargle syrup like Scope
I need a forty with a scope
So I scope, so I scope
So I scope, so I scope
So I scope, so I scope
So I scope, so I scope
So I scope

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
03 the one, I'm bangin' crip, you take a chance, I got the dope
She take a sniff, I take a sip, and she the one that's movin' slow
If I go broke, get that dough out your ho
I was taught to get it out the mud, the tender age of four
I'm not broke any more
Suicide my left door
Shovels goin' on my toe
It was a perfect summer
A new no limit when I pull up, damn
A purple Hummer
Soldiered down with Soldier Reezy
And I came with the Drummers
Got a pound of California and I know who want it
Marijuana, oh it make me ghost

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
So I scope
And I don't like the way these niggas move, it's the approach
Niggas creep up on you in the dark road like a roach
I been in the trenches too long, gotta go
White brick, tan brick, like a yellow brick road
Purple zip, red zip, I got some more, who wants to pour?
We gargle syrup like Scope
I need a forty with a scope
So I scope, so I scope

[Verse 2: Ralfy the Plug]
Ayy bro
These niggas talkin' crazy, I just scope
Big forty, I ain't worried 'bout your nigga, he get blown
Sippin' Kobe, that's a four up in the deuce to get me poured
You don't know me, that's some cookies in my wood, I'm not no scrub
Who these niggas, put some holes up in these squares just like a sponge
The one who be pluggin' these lil niggas with the mud
The plug he just breakin' these lil bitches for they funds
He be sippin' on real deal finnigan from the farm
I'm trappin', hmm
I'm not just rappin' nigga
You cappin', hmm
Boy stop that actin' nigga
You ain't gettin' no money
You ain't thumbin' through hundreds nigga
You ain't sippin' no muddy
You ain't pourin' no bubbly nigga

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
So I scope
And I don't like the way these niggas move, it's the approach
Niggas creep up on you in the dark road like a roach
I been in the trenches too long, gotta go
White brick, tan brick, like a yellow brick road
Purple zip, red zip, I got some more, who wants to pour?
We gargle syrup like Scope
I need a forty with a scope
So I scope, so I scope

[Verse 3: Desto Dubb]
Yeah yeah yeah, the lean it cost more than gold
Eat it up, I got red but it ain't old
Beat the case but I never told
Won't pay my bail with my soul
No seal (nope), no sale (nope), two bails (yep), no jail (nope)
I win, would never fail
If you do learn your lesson
God put me in position
It's a blessin', I been dressin'
Codeine got a nigga flexin'
Two niggas, one pint
We still pulled up to that fight
I come alive when it turn night
I pour the lean when the time is right
Just got a pint and I tote a nine
Sixty a line, I paid fifty-five
Nine sixty buy this pint
I'm a hundred, I'm up tonight
Ralfy don't forget that Sprite
Greedo came home last night
We might fuss but we never fight

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
So I scope
And I don't like the way these niggas move, it's the approach
Niggas creep up on you in the dark road like a roach
I been in the trenches too long, gotta go
White brick, tan brick, like a yellow brick road
Purple zip, red zip, I got some more, who wants to pour?
We gargle syrup like Scope
I need a forty with a scope
So I scope, so I scope
