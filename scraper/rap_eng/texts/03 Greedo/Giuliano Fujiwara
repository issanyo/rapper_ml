[Intro]
Giuliano, 03
Giuliano Fujiwara
Yeah

[Chorus]
Giuliano Fujiwara
Gonna flood baby's wrist, Fiji water
Helmut Lang, Hilberry
We gon' spend a little time away in Paris

[Verse]
I can get you what you want
Draped her in some Saint Laurent
We don't never be at Ross
Poppin' tags at Guillermos
Turn up when I travel, Rico and dark shadow
This that Raf Simons, this that Robert Geller
Herman and Versace, new Issey Miyake
All my niggas icy like we be playin' hockey
That new Rockefeller, dubbin' like I'm Jay-Z
Crip, blue bills, gang banging, but I'm rockin' Yaley
Got my chain from Charlie, Fendi made her vomit
03 in that Y3, oh I think they like me
Yup, I stayed down, I ran it up, Drummer Gang in the cut
Tigers when we up
Crippin' blue, blue Japan, Jill Sander full of xans
I be feelin' like the man, every time we make plans
Rag & Bone, Off-White, broke all my life
I don't wanna think twice, once, no
We don't look at the price, gang
We don't look at the price, once
Faces on my Fendi feet, laces match my Gucci B
Cuzzy still her favorite P, Gucci moon and tiger teeth
Faces on my Fendi feet, laces match my Gucci B
Cuzzy still her favorite P, Gucci moon and tiger teeth

[Chorus]
Giuliano Fujiwara
Gonna flood baby's wrist, Fiji water
Helmut Lang, Hilberry
We gon' spend a little time away in Paris
