[Intro]
X loaded up bro
Never see me in the church
Prayer for my lost, 03
X on the beat make it boom

[Chorus]
I just had to say a prayer for my lost one
Probably never seen me in the church
I just had to say a prayer for my lost one
I just had to put my nigga in the dirt
I just had to say a prayer for my lost one
Had to ride behind another hearse
I just had to say a prayer for my lost one
And you know it hurt
Prayer for my lost, prayer for my lost
Prayer for my lost, prayer for my lost
Prayer for my lost one, and you know it hurts

[Verse 1]
Are you the type to keep it solid if the cops come?
If I ever get in drama would you not run?
I said a prayer for my lost one
Every time I did some time another lost gun
Are you that real, would you bop one?
Don't come around if you not one
I am too real to be short one
That's the outcome, where I'm from
Can't ride around without drums, yeah
I'm from the section where them drugs make your nose run
I'm from the sections where we smoke until it's no love

[Chorus]
I just had to say a prayer for my lost one
Probably never seen me in the church
I just had to say a prayer for my lost one
I just had to put my nigga in the dirt
I just had to say a prayer for my lost one
Had to ride behind another hearse
I just had to say a prayer for my lost one
And you know it hurt
Prayer for my lost, prayer for my lost
Prayer for my lost, prayer for my lost
Prayer for my lost one, and you know it hurts

[Verse 2]
Lately I been losin' homies left and right
Lately I been losin' hotties left and right
Maybe 'cause I'm havin' nightmares every night
So I gotta keep a chopper by my side
Every weekend it's another homicide
'Cause they keep just catching bodies on my side
I don't wanna die
Sometimes I'm like fuck it 'cause I live a hellish life
Feel so broke 'cause ain't no money by my side
I remember Lil Money by my side
Man sometimes I wanna cry
But I'm always outside, ooh
That's why my feelings, gotta hide, ooh
I keep my chin up for my pride, ooh
And I'm screamin' free the guy
And I'm from the other side, yeah, yeah
Hearin' voices in my head
Probably the homies that just dead
Leave me alone, all my niggas gone
Leave me alone

[Chorus]
I just had to say a prayer for my lost ones
Probably never seen me in the church
I just had to say a prayer for my lost ones
I just had to put my nigga in the dirt
I just had to say a prayer for my lost ones
Had to ride behind another hearse
I just had to say a prayer for my lost ones
And you know it hurt
Prayer for my lost, prayer for my lost
Prayer for my lost, prayer for my lost
Prayer for my lost ones, and you know it hurts

[Outro]
Pray for me, pray for my lost
Pray for my niggas just layin'
Oh, life keeps on changin'
Who made this arrangement?
Who knew that this shit get this dangerous?
I still just can't take it
