[Intro: D-Lo]
My daddy didn't raise no bitch
My daddy didn't raise no bitch, nigga
RudeBoy, D-Lo, look, ayy

[Verse 1: D-Lo]
My daddy didn't raise no bitch
I'm a gangster boy, I got pimp bones
I been thuggin' ever since middle school
Got caught with a sack, got sent home
Got a broke bitch in my DM's, I just act like I don't see the shit
Got my own money, I don't need a bitch, got a big gun, gotta see the shit
I'll shoot a nigga I love, he cross me the wrong way
It ain't never the wrong time, bro we spank shit broad day
Had to show the bitch that I'm different, got a bag unlike your last nigga
These diamonds got me drippin', I splash niggas, I gas niggas
I'm a reputable in my section, my niggas will kill you just for looking wrong
I'ma kill a bitch, come push me
I'ma show you I ain't no pussy, ayy
Do your homework 'bout a real nigga
You don't even know if I kill niggas
I be bouncin' out, just drill niggas
You gotta contribute to the funk, can't let them niggas go without
'Cause you up and that nigga down, he think about killing you right now
Somebody save me, save me
My niggas sick with them choppers, they goin' crazy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Thugged out, we the ones who bring the bloods and the cuz out
Ones who don't bang who be sellin' all the drugs out
All my niggas thugged out
Keep playin', we gon' pull the fuckin' guns out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I stay with them dudes, my boys
In and out the club, ballin' in the hood, my boys
I did everything I could for my boys
Game made me build and destroy, yeah
I'ma rewrap the bricks, I'ma rewrap them bricks, Jordan Downs, yeah
Went through the struggle but my hood supportin' now, yeah
Keep it real, you're recordin' now, ooh
Lots of Texas chest
I ain't never had a wire on my fuckin' chest
I'm a real street nigga, gotta duck the feds
'Cause a nigga fightin' cases still in Texas bitch
Roll up the blunt, load up the gun, don't need a shooter
I'ma do it sober, smoke a blunt after I shoot you
Roll up the blunt, load up the gun, don't need a shooter
I'ma do it sober, smoke a blunt after I shoot you, ayy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Thugged out, we the ones who bring the bloods and the cuz out
Ones who don't bang who be sellin' all the drugs out
All my niggas thugged out
Keep playin', we gon' pull the fuckin' guns out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out

[Verse 3: OMB Peezy]
Look, Peezy, bitch I'm a thug
And I'm surrounded by killers, bitch they'll murk your ass in this club
He was woofin' too fucked up so we left his ass where he was
I'm in the field like a quarterback, keep talkin', gon' catch a slug
Lil Pappy like that's my thug there, he be ready for the beef
Try to run, you ain't goin' nowhere, got a laser on that heat
I know they plottin' on Peezy, gotta keep the heat in my reach
Man I can't picture me starvin', I bet win or lose I'ma eat, yeah
We the ones that bring the bloods and the cuz out
One false move, you'll get stomped out, ayy
Gettin' money, you know I don't give a fuck 'bout
None of that shit you talkin' 'bout, Peezy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Thugged out, we the ones who bring the bloods and the cuz out
Ones who don't bang who be sellin' all the drugs out
All my niggas thugged out
Keep playin', we gon' pull the fuckin' guns out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
Thugged out, thugged out, bitch we thugged out
