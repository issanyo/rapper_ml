[Intro: 03 Greedo]
I'm not the type
I'm not the type
I'm not the type
Sum up the difference
I'm something too different
Something too different
Dave-O, make me a slap

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I'm not the type to just sit in the house
Bitch, I'm the type to go figure it out
I'm not the type to type tough shit on Twitter
I push a button, go get me a nigga
I'm something too different
Just to sum up the difference
My OG told me that I had to lose just to gain
Sum up the difference
I'm something too different, to sum up the difference

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Ain't the type to talk shit, let you talk back
Bitch, I'm the type to leave a nigga where the chalk at
I ain't one to talk to the pigs, where my cell at?
Niggas never trapped interstate, where my jail at?
You ain't in the trenches, where the mil' at?
Nigga, you ain't scale that
Nigga, you ain't sell that
You just probably smelled that or hit that
Tell these pussy niggas get back
We don't do the parties or the kick-backs
Got beef, that's a big snack
Run up on me, leave a few stacks
I could drop ten, that's a fuckin' feature
Stomp a nigga out in the Raf sneakers

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Philthy Rich]
I'm not the type to just sit in the house
Bitch, I'm the type to go figure it out
I'm not the type to type tough shit on Twitter
I push a button, go get me a nigga
I'm something too different
Just to sum up the difference
My OG told me that I had to lose just to gain
Sum up the difference (Ayy, it's Philthy, nigga)
I'm something too different, to sum up the difference (Uh-huh, look)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Niggas'll steal from you, tryna help you find it (Suckers)
Money on your head, the closest nigga lyin' (12)
Lil Ant was two years old when he felt designer (Swear to God)
Bitch pussy wore out, couldn't feel the lining (Bitch)
My niece mad, ain't no paintings of her in my house (Is that right?)
Me and her mama beefin', we ain't gon' hash it out (Uh-uh)
Pressed up a thousand CD's just to pass 'em out (Oh, I remember)
Niggas ain't want to buy 'em, now they cashin' out (It's Philthy)
Got my ass whooped every week because I didn't listen (I couldn't listen)
Kicked out of school, nigga couldn't pay attention (I couldn't pay attention)
The OG's always told me I was somethin' different
Now I'm worth a few mil' to sum up the difference, It's Philthy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I'm not the type to just sit in the house
Bitch, I'm the type to go figure it out
I'm not the type to type tough shit on Twitter
I push a button, go get me a nigga
I'm something too different
Just to sum up the difference
My OG told me that I had to lose just to gain
Sum up the difference
I'm something too different, to sum up the difference
