[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
I been counting money forward, I don't back track
Every night I pray the lord he bring that Act back
If my brother bring a play then I'ma latch that
And we came up out the gutter as a matter fact
I pull up on her, it's a party in my way back
Fall in love, ain't got no feelings, you can have that
I'ma pull up with no ceilings at your address
Let that chopper get to drilling, be like grah grah

[Verse 1: Bino Rideaux]
All I wanted was hundreds on my C day
Niggas be talkin', we don't believe it
Came out the struggle, I live and breathe it
I'm still pouring, Drakeo still be fiendin'
I'm still bringin' them stacks in with no D-day
Yeah, I make her bust it on the freeway
You can't put no budget on what we make
Never give a fuck nigga no leeway
I was 'bout my hustle back in pre-K
Used to dress the flyest on a free day
Long as you supplying I'm receiving
Fucked my bitch all night and then I'm leaving
'Cause niggas spending money and I need it
I'm riding with Envy, he gon' grow up
Pull up on your block and be like show up
I don't talk to no bitch about niggas
But your bitch talk to niggas, niggas know us

[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
I been counting money forward, I don't back track
Every night I pray the lord he bring that Act back
If my brother bring a play then I'ma latch that
And we came up out the gutter as a matter fact
I pull up on her, it's a party in my way back
Fall in love, ain't got no feelings, you can have that
I'ma pull up with no ceilings at your address
Let that chopper get to drilling, be like grah grah

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
Niggas know me, I'm the Ruler, I don't back track
If you pull up in a coupe I can match that
Off this mud, buck fifty in the fast track
I'm sick of niggas and these subs, I'ma crash 'em
Always acting out in public, I'm a class clown
Money doing Benihanas, I'm an asshole
I'm drinking red, I wish a nigga'd bring the Act back
Nigga dressing like he on but he crack cars
All big banc uchies, look at dashboards
In a max sport, the flu flamming rap star
All up in your news feeds
Kick door, Bruce Lee, never drove a hoopty
Sick of niggas boosting, I'm strangling Judas
Told I'm a nuisance, these niggas must be stupid
They think I'm 'bout to bow down, you might just tap out now
We fix grills like pow wow, the Stincs got the laugh now
Maylene give my MAC round, don't rap beef 'cause that's out

[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
I been counting money forward, I don't back track
Every night I pray the lord he bring that Act back
If my brother bring a play then I'ma latch that
And we came up out the gutter as a matter fact
I pull up on her, it's a party in my way back
Fall in love, ain't got no feelings, you can have that
I'ma pull up with no ceilings at your address
Let that chopper get to drilling, be like grah grah

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
It's early in the morning
She's chilling as I'm noting
And I'ma get that fire on niggas
I don't live let die on niggas
Remember where I left sight on niggas, my side don't sleep
Homicide lowkey, high notes [?] or the safety squared on my sleep
New belt, Louis V, best dressed, clean feet
No socks, two G's for the slip-on loafers
Grape singing like McQueen for my neck
Purple diamonds, blue diamonds on the Titanic
Lately I been on my tip like an iceberg
You was digging your boogers, I got that drip that I was splashin'
Club flashin', fast loves in the club, got shit for these rappers
Twice I [?] love, that's just for these trappers

[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
I been counting money forward, I don't back track
Every night I pray the lord he bring that Act back
If my brother bring a play then I'ma latch that
And we came up out the gutter as a matter fact
I pull up on her, it's a party in my way back
Fall in love, ain't got no feelings, you can have that
I'ma pull up with no ceilings at your address
Let that chopper get to drilling, be like grah grah
