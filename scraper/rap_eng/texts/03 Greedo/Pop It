[Intro]
Ayy, it's Benny
This a perc, this a, this a what?
Ayy

[Chorus]
This a percocet, I don't do the xans
I don't do molly, bitch I do them real drugs
This a percocet, I don't do the xans
I don't do molly, bitch I do them real drugs
Pop it, pop it, ooh
Drink some water bitch, pop it, pop it, ooh, ooh, ooh
You need some water bitch, pop it

[Verse 1]
She said I been goin' poppin' in the booth like I was poppin'
Legendary like the doc, we ain't fuckin' with the opps
Baby wanna taste me, she gon' suck me when she lick the top
Dancin' like the diamonds on the package, watch me milly rock
She say that she nasty, told her show me what you really got
She say that she nasty, told her show me what you really got
Back when I was in the pen, I was dreamin' of the Benz
Ridin' shit without the rims, I'm booted up with all the timbs
I'm just focused on my aim
All this money make you lose your friends

[Chorus]
This a percocet, I don't do the xans
I don't do molly, bitch I do them real drugs
This a percocet, I don't do the xans
I don't do molly, bitch I do them real drugs
Pop it, pop it, ooh
Drink some water bitch, pop it, pop it, ooh, ooh, ooh
You need some water bitch, pop it

[Verse 2]
Shake some', shake some' 'til you make some'
Break a nigga, tell a nigga get his cake up
Shake a nigga, if he can't handle y'all lil break-up
Paid up, pay him for your nails your rent and makeup
Lyin' down, tell lil partner he can check this game out
Charge a bitch, then I gave her gifts and then she came out, whoa
She got played out
So that bitch just couldn't stay 'round
Treat that brain like a playground
Run her blood pressure up so she stay down
Local winner, hi hater when I came down
Now she hate it when I came 'round

[Chorus]
This a percocet, I don't do the xans
I don't do molly, bitch I do them real drugs
This a percocet, I don't do the xans
I don't do molly, bitch I do them real drugs
Pop it, pop it, ooh
Drink some water bitch, pop it, pop it, ooh, ooh, ooh
You need some water bitch, pop it
