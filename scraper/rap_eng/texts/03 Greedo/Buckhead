[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Know what I'm sayin' like
I'm a thirsty young nigga, know what I'm sayin'
I'ma get up on a bitch if I think she fine, you know what I'm sayin'
Now I'm rich, I think I can pay the fine,  you know what I'm sayin'

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead, ooh
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet, ayy
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Ooh, damn, I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet (bitch)
You know who I am
I'ma flu flamm, free Drakeo
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead, ayy
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to ayy, told that bitch to whoa
If I ever lose a broad I'ma fuck her friend
I'm a real ass nigga, I cannot pretend
I ain't never really sippin' on that juice and gin
I'ma get promethazine and I'ma pour it in
If I'm smokin' on a blunt I'ma push a blimp
If it ain't a backwood you are not my friend
I was chokin' on that shit, I'm sippin' on the Henn
If they ain't got Henn, sippin' on the Rem
I ain't gon' get twenty-four, pourin' juice, I'm pourin' fours
Bitch you know I'm bangin' baby loc
Ride me like a hunter s'posed

[Verse 2: Key!]
Yeah, kick a door in some skate shoes
Bitch, I ain't bougie, I just hate you
Pull up right now, I'm at Lenox
Ayy if she ain't talkin' money speakin' Spanish
Ayy, bitch I never went to high school, huh
Bitch I went to school high, you dig
Killed my best friend like Fresh did
Got your main bitch on my chest
No Scantron, no test
Niggas sick, asbestos

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead, ooh
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet, ayy
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead

[Verse 3: ManMan Savage]
I don't know how I ain't fuck yet
Bitch been on a nigga's dick so long, meet me in Buckhead
I ain't fucked a bitch without the neck, you can bet that
Bitch I'm all about a check, you ain't even gotta sweat that
In that backpack bitch, it's a whole lot of racks
Dare a nigga play with it, I'ma push his top back
Plus she got that type of pussy make a nigga come back
If I put her in that Gucci bag, your bitch won't come back
Introduced her to this lifestyle, she say she ain't goin' back

[Verse 4: Runway Richy]
I ain't hit her but I could've though (Runway)
Hit her friend and her sister with another ho
Shawty got her eyes on me (yeah)
Won't you come and spend some time with me (yeah)
Told her pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead, bring a friend with you
When she on that Henn she on ten with it (she on ten with it)
Damn, I don't know how I still ain't fucked yet (yeah)
Bitch tryna chill, I told her fuck that

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead, ooh
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet, ayy
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead

[Verse 5: Yung Mal]
I told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead
Goyard filled up, nothin' but blue faces, big heads
I'm rich as a bitch, I don't know how I ain't fuck yet
She wanna play them games with a nigga, I swear I ain't on that
I dipped her, she can't even call my phone
LV hold my pants up, that's where I keep that chrome at
Middle finger with the five, hell yeah, that's my zone jack
I just bought a new jack, finna paint that bitch matte black, yeah

[Verse 6: Lil Quill]
I just put the Forgis on the Lam, it got two doors
I can't set it on me, one lil bitch, I need like two hoes
Bank account loaded, bankroll fat, can't even fold
Bustdown Rollie, think I spent like twenty-four
Double G wrapped 'round my belt, she call me too old
Plug just hit my line, no call back, just send me three more
Yeah lil bitch you fine but I'm not textin' you this lingo
Racks stacked up like Pringles, ain't fuckin' with no cheap hoes, on God

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead, ooh
Don't know how I still ain't fuck yet, ayy
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
Told that bitch to pull up on me, I'm in Buckhead
I don't know how I still ain't fuck yet
