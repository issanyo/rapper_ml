Aye beat boy 03
Purple summer (x2)
Hol up who are you (x2)
You ain't ever made the news
Hol up who are you? You ain't ever made the news

(Hook)
Hol up who are you
Oh you ain't ever made the news
Drummer gang reloaded
You don't want to make the news
My manager say they respect the money
Peep the jewels
Since niggas hating on me
Bitch I gotta take the tool
I Rob but I don't steal
I fucc around and take your jewels
Just cuz you in yo feelings that don't mean that you a fool
Knocc em off
Breaking news
Knocc it off, breaking news
Knocc em off, breaking
Knocc it off, breaking news

(Verse 1)
Momma cried that day I hit that channel 7, ABC
I been out and one year later out here flexing, 103
My lil brother lil money went to heaven, G.I.P
His little daughter always gon receive my blessings, keep money
Every morning I been praying on my knees
Almost amputate my leg
Now I'm running up the cheese
Niggas tough on they lil post
But just was running up the street
I'm bacc walkin and shit talkin
You don't wanna fucc with me
No more counting bands, on the gram
Money in the bank
Niggas out here leasing foreigns
Missing payments, empty tank
I'm a project nigga ima always shoot it straight
Half these niggas say they got me just be lying to my face
I be knowing but don't show it
Ain't got time that ain't my place
I just use them for whatever
Then be like "I need some space"
I don't know shit bout no case
Please don't tell me what they say
I ain't worried bout who fake
I'm a legend he a snake, YEAAAAHHHH

(Hook)
Hol up who are you
Oh you ain't ever made the news
Drummer gang reloaded
You don't want to make the news
My manager say they respect the money
Peep the jewels
Since niggas hating on me
Bitch I gotta take the tool
I Robb but I don't steal
I fucc around and take your jewels
Just cuz you in yo feelings that don't mean that you a fool
Knocc em off
Breaking news
Knocc it off, breaking news
Knocc em off, breaking news
Knocc it off, breaking news

(Verse 2)
Feeling like Future that shit better make the news or something
Niggas talkin all that jabs but ain't gon do me nothing
Niggas see me goin up and wanna choose or something
Fucc that life I'm dying hard like I was Bruce or something
I'm free but niggas give advice bitch I ain't losing nothing
Look at yo life look at my life now who can use discussion
Fucc you listening to these raps is you confused or something
If I get rich is you gonna give me my poo-poo or something
Aye
Ain't ever worried bout no rumors
Aye
Done lost faith in half these shooters
Drummer gang bitch no we ain't recruiting
Now I'm winnin all you niggas look like losers!!
Never wish jail on a nigga
Ima put a shell in a nigga
(03, aye aye)
Neva wish jail on a jail a nigga
I just put a shell in a nigga
(Aye 03!!)
