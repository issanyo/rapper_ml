[Intro: DestoDubb]
Hah, pray for all you bitch ass niggas
Thank You Fizzle

[Chorus: DestoDubb]
I was raised on the east, I'ma die on the east
Mind state on beast, appetite on feast
Mind state on beast, money start to increase
I'ma die on the east
I was raised on the east, I'ma die on the east
Mind state on beast, appetite on feast
Money start to increase, I'ma die on the east
I'ma die on the east

[Verse 1: DestoDubb]
I had a case before a car
Qualitest before Paul
I live first with no scars
I got stripes with no awards (nope, nope, nope)
I had a dope boy dream when I was sixteen
And I started sippin' lean and I started poppin' E
Then my mama locked the door, I was sleepin' on the floor
Now I'm fuckin' on your ho, and she stealin' from the store
The sixties was my crows, and the forties was my bros
E White showed me the ropes, now I'm traveling 'round the globe
Every week I called home, 'fore a nigga went to jail
Then I get through the mail, call my mama from a cell

[Chorus: DestoDubb]
I was raised on the east, I'ma die on the east
Mind state on beast, appetite on feast
Mind state on beast, money start to increase
I'ma die on the east
I was raised on the east, I'ma die on the east
Mind state on beast, appetite on feast
Money start to increase, I'ma die on the east
I'ma die on the east

[Verse 2: Pimp Pimp P]
I was raised on the east, bopping bitches every week
Boppin' bitches to sleep, it's regular
My daddy was a pimp in the crib
Do the dash on the motherfuckin' Saint Cliff, regular
It's the Pimp Pimp P, slap your mama in the week
We ain't going to sleep
I stay on the east, RIP Doe B
And the homies got heat, huh
Donkey dickin' bitches on, have a long week
Going to sleep, it's regular
Get a bag lil dude, huh
Do the dash lil dude, huh

[Chorus: DestoDubb]
I was raised on the east, I'ma die on the east
Mind state on beast, appetite on feast
Mind state on beast, money start to increase
I'ma die on the east
I was raised on the east, I'ma die on the east
Mind state on beast, appetite on feast
Money start to increase, I'ma die on the east
I'ma die on the east

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
Gangbangin' on the east side
Run up a jet like a G9
I'm a lagoon, no seaside
We ain't from where this beach die
On the side, keep heat by
Who got the drugs for the cheap buy
Fill 'em in, that creep life
Went from oatmeal cream pie
Back in the pen, now it's ten for the fee price
They took way more of the ten, guarantee I'll be fine
I be doggin' all my bitches and they boyfriends feline, yeah

[Chorus: DestoDubb]
I was raised on the east, I'ma die on the east
Mind state on beast, appetite on feast
Mind state on beast, money start to increase
I'ma die on the east
I was raised on the east, I'ma die on the east
Mind state on beast, appetite on feast
Money start to increase, I'ma die on the east
I'ma die on the east

[Outro: Pimp Pimp P & DestoDubb]
Kill
Skrrt
Skrrt entertainments
It's regular, been regular
We pick up our money
We don't throw it on the ground
I'ma die on the east
It's regular
We never throw our money on the ground, we keep it in our hand
It's regular
'Cause we die on the east, it's regular
