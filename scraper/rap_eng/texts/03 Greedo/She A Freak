Your girl came in creepin' with the low
She was fuckin me back when i was broke
Keep that pussy soaked
Talkin' like a super soaker
Ran into that bitch in Kroger
Swoop down on a nigga like a vulture
On a motherfuckin' tip like pacific ocean
She come out of San Diego but we met in Oakland
She got fire pussy, best thing smoked
She stay in her own world
And her favourite song's zoning
