[Intro]
I ain't got nothin' for a nigga
Lame ass nigga, you goin' out sad and all that
They call me handsome triple that

[Chorus]
This shit just ain't pan out how we planned out
Thought you was the plug and then you ran out
I can't lift a finger, ain't no handouts
Matter fact, bitch get down and lay down
This shit just ain't pan out how we planned out
Thought you was the plug and then you ran out
I can't lift a finger, ain't no handouts
Matter fact, bitch get down and lay down

[Verse]
Really had that package out in traffic, bitch what happened? (you went broke)
Ridin' 'round with pistols made of plastics, choppers with attachments (is you flippin' or you slippin' coach?)
You ain't a hustler you a has-been, what happened?
All you niggas started rappin' and trappin'
Most these niggas out here cappin', it's nothin'
Why you talkin' to that cop, that ain't the judge, quit yappin', ooh
Tellin' on yourself 'fore you got to jail, ooh
Tellin' on your dog when you make bail
I don't understand what you been through
Most my niggas 'round me for real
I'm a real thoroughbred
Cock my gun each time I'm gettin' head
'Cause I can't trust that bitch or that lil lame she with
But I'm still finna get some head
Ooh, I'm a nigga from the projects
I ain't never really gave a fuck about a bitch, ayy
I'm just gettin' rich, you can suck a dick
I'm the hottest out, bitch you know who you fuckin' with

[Chorus]
This shit just ain't pan out how we planned out
Thought you was the plug and then you ran out
I can't lift a finger, ain't no handouts
Matter fact, bitch get down and lay down
This shit just ain't pan out how we planned out
Thought you was the plug and then you ran out
I can't lift a finger, ain't no handouts
Matter fact, bitch get down and lay down, ayy
