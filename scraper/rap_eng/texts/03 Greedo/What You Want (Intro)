[Intro]
Ron-Ron do that shit
Whoa, hey, hey, hey
Wait, wait, ooh, ooh, wait

[Chorus]
I ain't Durk but this ain't what you want
Keep a burner like a fuckin' blunt
Call me Greedy, eat you like some lunch
Drummer Gang, we murder, fuck a sucker punch
I'm the man with the birds, I'ma fuckin' stunt
Sippin' on some sizzurp like some tiki punch
I ain't Durk but this ain't what you want
Bitch I keep a burner like a fuckin' blunt

[Verse]
I'ma smoke a nigga like a pound of gas
Don't let your caption write a check that you could never cash
I'm going up just like a rider, have a dozen flashing
Fuck magic mountain, and I got baby girl in Magic dancin'
Baby love me 'cause I'm thuggin' and she say I'm handsome
Tell my nigga Mike Will we need another Ransom
Run right through that shit, you know we had to body bag
Death certificate, you know I had to toe tag
Gucci buckle worth a fortune, tighten up the dragon
Got the chickens in the kitchen like I work at Zaxbys
I been callin' all the plays like I'm Johnny Madden
Put my projects on the map, now I got 'em swaggin
Everybody trappin', everybody cappin'
Everybody rappin', shit that never happened
I'm the realest out, verse bought the south
Rappin' real estate, I'm from the realest state
It's safe, I'm straight, I never been all on my rental plate
I entertain but I got started on the interstate
Lil bitch I'm out of state, outfit from outer space
I get that Gucci with the orbit to go out on dates

[Chorus]
I ain't Durk but this ain't what you want
Keep a burner like a fuckin' blunt
Call me Greedy, eat you like some lunch
Drummer Gang, we murder, fuck a sucker punch
I'm the man with the birds, I'ma fuckin' stunt
Sippin' on some sizzurp like some tiki punch
I ain't Durk but this ain't what you want
Bitch I keep a burner like a fuckin' blunt
