[Intro: 03 Greedo]
I might load it up
We didn't bring them hoes with us
All my niggas totin' guns

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
It's hard to deal with paranoia
I think I need another lawyer
I need a bitch who gon' be loyal
Smoke creepin' out the barrel of the blower
It's hard to deal with paranoia
I think I need another lawyer
I need a bitch who gon' be loyal
Smoke creepin' out the barrel of the blower

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
It's hard to deal with paranoia, ayy
All my niggas they too loyal, ayy
All my bitches they too spoiled, oh
In the kitchen, them hoes gon' boil, yeah
Really speakin' to the migos, ayy ayy ayy ayy
Really bangin' for them kilos, ayy ayy ayy ayy
And I never been a hero, ayy ayy ayy ayy
Now a nigga like a hero, ayy ayy ayy ayy
Blacked out, creepin' like a villian, ooh ooh ooh ooh
In the kitchen with the skillet, ayy ayy ayy ayy
All my bitches in they feelings, ayy ayy ayy ayy
At the top like the ceiling, ayy ayy ayy ayy
I ain't never played any game game game games
All my niggas really gang gang gang gang bang
All these niggas ain't gang gang gang gang gang
Which gang gang gang gang gang?
Bitch a nigga bangin' grape grape grape grape grape
Built the planet out of apes apes apes and the scrape
And a nigga really ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy
And I tried to treat the game like a motherfuckin' play
Call me Greedy, now I'm, ooh, no I'm straight
I, signed a deal and I got paid, I
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
It's hard to deal with paranoia
I think I need another lawyer
I need a bitch who gon' be loyal
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
It's hard to deal with paranoia
I think I need another lawyer
I need a bitch who gon' be loyal
Smoke creepin' out the barrel of the blower

[Verse 2: Bambino & 03 Greedo]
Leave a nigga stinking, and I came in with the Stinc Team
Drummer Gang in this thang, make it bang
Ain't nothing out your range, 03
Niggas try to hate me like a bandit
These bitches tryna act like bitches, good Hannah Montana
But I know she got like Miley Cyrus
Goddamn homie, how you change like a light get
He was all in, scared of them life sentences
I am not afraid, I'm not a media witness
Wasn't tryna send you home, but with a lighter sentence
Shawty wanna ride, I think she need a ticket
Ticket on my head from the opposition
Stinc sack with a lil card 'cause that sack went missing
Still in the field, still in the field tripping
HamdouliLlah, nigga my shoes is Christians
She's on a date, she's out on business
Remember when it felt like I ain't have a pot to piss in
Now I can't stop the chopper from kicking
Give a young nigga an early dismissal
Lil bitch is a weak link
Came up short, now that bitch can't reach me
The bitch that make it look easy
Know the feds watching but I hope they don't see me
White girl, real chopper, she know men, she like Phoebe
Tried to put that trick on repeat
Brag about that bitch, bet that bitch evil
Tell a bitch do not try, tell her go home, tell her get by
And if I get caught money pass prepaid man, ah
Ah, ah, greedy, ayy, go, oh, too greedy, oh
