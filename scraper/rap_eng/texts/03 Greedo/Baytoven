[Intro]
Uh, bitch, you took too long
All my niggas got on
I dog a bitch like Beethoven
Ron Ron just like my Zaytoven (Ron Ron do that shit)
Beat Boy, that's my Metro Boomin (Beat Boy taught me)

[Chorus]
I dog a bitch like Beethoven
Ron Ron just like my Zaytoven
Beat Boy, that's my Metro Boomin
We takin' all that shit over
I dog a bitch like Beethoven
Ron Ron just like my Zaytoven
Beat Boy, that's my Metro Boomin
We takin' all that shit over

[Verse 1]
Dog a bucket head bitch like a cocker spaniel
03 Greedo got it lit just like a roman candle
Long nose four four, call it cheat code
Next Friday, feel like Joker with the heat though
No low-riders but I'm hoppin' in traffic
My bitch keep askin', I'll shoot if it's blastin'
Yeah I know that pussy but can tell she a catfish
Fried foods, grillin' bitches, take your wife too
I feel like the nigga who was poppin' back in high school
Twelfth grade, sold drugs, principal face
Dog a lil bitch ass like a Pomeranian
I'm in Dubai, hair tied like Arabian
Tryna know if niggas pullin' triggers
All my bitches gradient, I be on some player shit
Dog a pussy, and I'm never sayin' shit
Ayy, ayy, and she fuckin' with me

[Chorus]
I dog a bitch like Beethoven
Ron Ron just like my Zaytoven
Beat Boy, that's my Metro Boomin
We takin' all that shit over
I dog a bitch like Beethoven
Ron Ron just like my Zaytoven
Beat Boy, that's my Metro Boomin
We takin' all that shit over

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm Future mixed with Young Thug
Throwin' all the drugs up, Jay know I'm like nunchucks
Swingin' on my weapon, hit the wood and I'ma get to flexin'
I'ma keep me a gun for protection
Hoes tryna come up, fucked up, how the game go
Get your dog mangled, she say I'm a dog just 'cause I gang bang though
I can make you sweat, I'm on your head like a Kangol
Flier than a red hot, that shit can't though
Armed with the metal like Jax, I hit 'em with the flow
Mortal Kombat on a ho, oh no, oh no
Tryna ride the wave, get it babe, oh low
Lower than the ocean but I'm higher than the ozone
Think I'm missin' me some prozone
Man them niggas need another Zoe
Ayy, sittin' on the throne

[Chorus]
I dog a bitch like Beethoven (you bitch)
Ron Ron just like my Zaytoven (get real, ayy)
Beat Boy, that's my Metro Boomin (ayy)
We takin' all that shit over (get paid)
I dog a bitch like Beethoven (ho)
Ron Ron just like my Zaytoven (I need the dough)
Beat Boy, that's my Metro Boomin
We takin' all that shit over (all my niggas cutthroat)

[Outro]
Drummer Gang, make it bang, baby we in this thing
And that shit heartless mane
Might take a nigga chain
Whippin' that woodgrain
Really came from that hood mane
I'm doing good things
I did what I could mane, just do what you should mane
