[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Oh, fell asleep at the wheel
03
Wake me up in traffic
Ooh, yeah yeah
Wake me up in traffic
03

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Wake me up in traffic, fell asleep at the wheel
Lately I been trappin', kush lean and the pills
Wake me up in traffic, ooh
Wake me up in traffic, ooh
Wake me up in traffic, fell asleep at the wheel
Lately I been trappin', kush lean and the pills
Wake me up in traffic, 03
Wake me up in traffic

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Sleep walkin', sleep talkin'
My other side bitch bringin' me Hawkins
She's creepin', she's my secret
Still can't trust her to keep my secret
So when I got her in her Vickies I don't feel at all
Popped a pill then I popped another ceiling off
Keep her clothes on just so she can turn her feelings off
So lit, fuck around and burn the ceiling off
I'm going up in the hood function
She wanna fuck with a nigga hustling
I'm at the store with another onion
No Halloween but she got a pumpkin
And I got my mask and my glove
Dead presidents, chase a bank, do some drugs
Every day I repent but I keep fucking up
Only my God can judge me, too rich for a judge
Ooh, I don't give a fuck
Ooh, unless I get paid I don't go to clubs, ooh
We hopped out with drums and she knew what was up

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Wake me up in traffic, fell asleep at the wheel
Lately I been trappin', kush lean and the pills
Wake me up in traffic, ooh
Wake me up in traffic, ooh
Wake me up in traffic, fell asleep at the wheel
Lately I been trappin', kush lean and the pills
Wake me up in traffic, yeah
Wake me up in traffic, yeah

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
Wake me up in traffic, scratch that, bitch I'm off three pills
Off mud with my thugs, I'ma crash it
Damn, i should've tucked these seals
I ain't friends, I ain't kins with these rappers
Shit, 'cause these niggas might tell
I was told I'm a dog to these hoes
Shit, don't we all go to heaven?
I ain't wifing, I ain't cuffin' on nothing?
Maylene and me battling for custody
I was with ling ling tryna bust 'em
Man down on the scene, it was nothing

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Wake me up in traffic, fell asleep at the wheel
Lately I been trappin', kush lean and the pills
Wake me up in traffic, ooh
Wake me up in traffic, ooh
Wake me up in traffic, fell asleep at the wheel
Lately I been trappin', kush lean and the pills
Wake me up in traffic, yeah
Wake me up in traffic, yeah

[Verse 3: Fenix]
Hey let me change your life, come and fuck with a D boy
Get them pints in, Karo two, he don't need four
Three more bricks, get 'em gone, that's how we pour
Bustin' scripts down, good insurance, that's a free score
HellaWave, big bankrolls
Niggas flexin' with them chains, we finna take those
You gon' hold them bitches down, we finna break those
Muddy on my Faygo, shoot and we on fade bro
Break a bitch back, break a bitch back
I been movin' with that pack, flip it, run it back
I been runnin' up a check, I run it, run it back
All my niggas they some runners, we some running backs

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Wake me up in traffic, fell asleep at the wheel
Lately I been trappin', kush lean and the pills
Wake me up in traffic, ooh
Wake me up in traffic, ooh
Wake me up in traffic, fell asleep at the wheel
Lately I been trappin', kush lean and the pills
Wake me up in traffic, yeah
Wake me up in traffic, yeah
