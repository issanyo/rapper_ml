Where you
You know where that shit come from, you know what I'm sayin'

Probably California where it came from
Where you get the guns with the drums say act fun from?

Ooh, California to Chicago, we go dumb dumb

Probably in Chicago where it come from
Ooh, California to Chicago, we go dumb dumb

[Verse 2: Z Money]
Where'd you get the bag, the swag, and the cash from?
Eighty thousand on me like some fuckin' ransom
With a Grape Street nigga (Greedo), Cali where he came from
Only fuck with real niggas, nigga that I ain't some'
From Chiraqy but I got on Bally, gun on me in Cali
Plug go in and out, got drugs at my traphouses, drinkin' got me drowsy
And this stanky shit I smoke the loudest, but my four-five louder
From Chiraqy but I'm out in Cali and I got a big gun

[Interlude: 03 Greedo]
Yeah, you bitch ass niggas talkin' 'bout you got that gast
Or you got that strap with that motherfucking hundred round drum nigga
Where you get it at?
You know what I'm sayin', we ain't seen you in the city
We ain't seen you in Cali, we ain't seen you in Chicago

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Where you get the bags full of gas for the cash from?
Probably California where it came from
Where you get the guns with the drums say act fun from?
Probably in Chicago where it come from
Ooh, California to Chicago, we go dumb dumb
Yeah, all my niggas want some
Chicago to California, we dumb dumb
Where it came from, where it came from
Where you get the bags full of gas for the cash from?
Probably California where it came from
Where you get the guns with the drums say act fun from?
Probably in Chicago where it come from
Ooh, California to Chicago, we go dumb dumb
Yeah, all my niggas want some
Chicago to California, we dumb dumb
Where it came from, where it came from
