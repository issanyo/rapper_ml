[Intro]
These, these, these niggas lame as hell
Lately I been flexin', I don't do this shit often
Flexin', I got game for sale
All these niggas lame as hell
Flexin', I got game for sale

[Chorus]
Lately I been flexin', I don't do this shit often
Million dollar man like I'm Ted DiBiase
Big gold dollars, I ain't worried bout the cost man
And I came in Givenchy
Rockin' Louis boots but I came in Givenchy
Rockin' Louis boots but I came in Givenchy
Million dollar man like I'm Ted DiBiase
I'm in Ted DiBiase

[Verse 1]
All my bad bitches bossy (ayy)
All my bad bitches flossy (and they flossy)
You wanna fuck 'em, it's gon' cost you (it'll cost you)
Or I'll fuck around and loss you (loss you)
Real player shit, ooh I ain't playin bitch (I ain't playin')
I'ma play a fuckin' game if I play a bitch (playin')
Otherwise I ain't playin' shit
You be playin' 'til it's K and shit (yeah)
Ooh, why we think you niggas lame and shit (lames)
Ayy, ayy, ayy (God Level)
You be fuckin' up the game and shit (fuckin' up the game, goddamn)
You know I got game for sale (I got game)
Leave your nigga 'cause he lame as hell (lame)

[Chorus]
Lately I been flexin', I don't do this shit often
Million dollar man like I'm Ted DiBiase
Big gold dollars, I ain't worried bout the cost man
And I came in Givenchy
Rockin' Louis boots but I came in Givenchy
Rockin' Louis boots but I came in Givenchy
Million dollar man like I'm Ted DiBiase
I'm in Ted DiBiase

[Verse 2]
Used to rock that Gucci, it got boring
Now I had to switch it up with Louis when I'm touring
Fill a pint and a nigga look foreign
All purple, now I switch it up with orange
This is Burberry, it ain't come plaid
All that other shit make a nigga mad
All these niggas tryna take a nigga's swag
Had to show off 'cause a nigga got his bag
On Rodeo every weekend
I'm in Lenox if I'm out of town geekin'
Had to stop goin' up to the Beverly
Too much gang bangers, I don't want that end for me
Got a chopper in the bag, I'm off ecstasy
And I'ma let a nigga breathe, ayy

[Chorus]
Lately I been flexin', I don't do this shit often
Million dollar man like I'm Ted DiBiase
Big gold dollars, I ain't worried bout the cost man
And I came in Givenchy
Rockin' Louis boots but I came in Givenchy
Rockin' Louis boots but I came in Givenchy
Million dollar man like I'm Ted DiBiase
I'm in Ted DiBiase

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm flexin', I'm flexin', ayy
I'm clutching my weapon
Milion dollar man, million dollar man, Ted DiBiase
Can't let these niggas test me
Can't let 'em grab for it, tryna trick me out my spot
Million dollar man like I'm Ted DiBiase
Million dollar man like I'm Ted DiBiase
