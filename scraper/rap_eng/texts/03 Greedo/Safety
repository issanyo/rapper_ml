[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Beat Boy taught me
Grippin' on your waist
Switch positions in the Wraith
Ride a nigga, switch lanes
Ron Ron do that shit

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Grippin' on your waist
Switch positions in the Wraith
Ride a nigga, switch lanes
Ridin' dirty, stay safe
I keep a pistol for safety
(Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous, lil nigga stay dangerous)
Stay dangerous
(Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous)
Keep that shit off of safety

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous
RIP to SB from Raymond
Like cuz I'm blessed and famous
Lil cuzzo was a real gangbanger, face tats tryna cover the pain up
Off drugs and anger, used to trade our bangers
East side to the west, we was always hangin'
And I'm going up now but my life been changing
My lil hottie say I'm workin' just like Jamaican
You don't know who raised me, I'm a grape, you a raisin
Burnt out and turned down and you always hatin'
Doin' numbers, countin' green like I'm caught in the matrix
Laid back like Neo but ho I'm still crazy
I'm the one, 03 got the streets in flames
Couldn't be no lame
Since I pop it keep a popper on and aim for a hater
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I got a good luck for pager

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Grippin' on your waist
Switch positions in the Wraith
Ride a nigga, switch lanes
Ridin' dirty, stay safe
I keep a pistol for safety
(Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous, lil nigga stay dangerous)
Stay dangerous
(Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous)
Keep that pistol off safety

[Verse 2: Ralfy the Plug]
We stayin' dangerous
Niggas ain't gang gang gang, they can't hang with us
03 too, been a block before the fame was up
We been out here totin' Glocks on Naomi Street
Free the real, hmm, and keep the fake
The gunman should probably be home in about May
Pop the weasel for niggas thinkin' they Debo
You niggas gon' need ten honk to drive my ego
Swervin' and swervin', switchin' lanes up on the speed bump
Post still drippin' hot sauce like Tapat√≠o
Politics, hmm, just like my fashion nigga
I been did the jeans with the wings, that shit is regular
Your mans don't got over ten, you don't compare to us
Bitch all in her feelings 'cause I don't care enough
You better keep a forty for safety 'cause shit get dangerous
These niggas all in they feelings 'cause ain't no taming us, the Plug

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Grippin' on your waist
Switch positions in the Wraith
Ride a nigga, switch lanes
Ridin' dirty, stay safe
I keep a pistol for safety
(Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous, lil nigga stay dangerous)
Stay dangerous
(Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous)
Keep that shit off of safety
