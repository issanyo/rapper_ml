[Intro]
Ice ice
Ice, ice ice ice, ooh
Ice, ooh

[Chorus]
Bright white, dice dice, top flight, dark Sprite
You can only understand me if you really move it
White knights, white dice, now I live a white life
Dancin' on the work, do the Vanilla Ice, two brick
Ice ice ice ice, I ain't talkin' jewelry
Ice ice ice, so icy like Gucci
Soldier like I'm Juvie
Quit the baller blocking, this is not a fuckin' movie

[Verse 1]
Fresh out say cheese, say that I'm the best out
I'm the biggest rappin' drug dealer from the west now
I can get that ice all on my teeth and on my chest now
And my whole body in Versace with the checks now
Ice white, flight nice, Air Force One life
Project nigga, this that mobbin' with the couch life
Swipe life, trap life, never have a wife life
Sendin' hoes pigeon toed, raisin' up the pack price
This that I was coolin', I got hot and grabbed a MAC life
If I have a flashback I fuck around and flash twice
O3 I thought we squashed it nigga, stop it, put you on ice
Niggas tryna get me pinched, tell the judge I'm innocent
I can't trust the enemy and I can't trust my fuckin' friend
I can't even trust this lil pussy nigga Benjamin
Frankly I was really only living for the listeners
Until I realized some of the wrong people listening

[Chorus]
Bright white, dice dice, top flight, dark Sprite
You can only understand me if you really move it
White knights, white dice, now I live a white life
Dancin' on the work, do the Vanilla Ice, two brick
Ice ice ice ice, I ain't talkin' jewelry
So icy like Gucci
Soldier like I'm Juvie
Quit the baller blocking, this is not a fuckin' movie

[Verse 2]
George Gervin (iceman)
George Jung (cash man)
Presidential George Bush, George of the Jungle
Ice man back when he was hurt he grabbed the ice pack
Ice pick, when you roll with this you need a few sticks
Ice checks, coolin' like a cooler 'cause my ice wet
Playing police roles like Ice T, and I got the Ice Cube
Big snake, cold world, life cool
I been breakin' out in people's faces what that ice do
High school, damn you was the man way back in high school
I just bought some shit I can't pronounce 'cause it was ice blue
Ice fool, ice fool, bitch I got them ice jewels
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, don't make me ice you
Icy nigga, icy licker, I just had a cold stripper
And she brought her wifey with her, and I think they real sisters
Icy body when I lick her, savage so I never kiss her
Fuck it I'm a nasty nigga

[Chorus]
Bright white, dice dice, top flight, dark Sprite
You can only understand me if you really move it
White knights, white dice, now I live a white life
Dancin' on the work, do the Vanilla Ice, two brick
Ice ice ice ice, I ain't talkin' jewelry
So icy like Gucci
Soldier like I'm Juvie
Quit the baller blocking, this is not a fuckin' movie
