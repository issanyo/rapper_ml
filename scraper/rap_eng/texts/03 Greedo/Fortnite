[Intro]
Look at my Twitter, you feel me
They talkin' 'bout my uh, my peoples TK, Picaso in the Forbes magazine
That they talkin' 'bout us

[Chorus]
Just last week I was mentioned in the Forbes bitch
Young street nigga tryna make another fortune
With my daughter, playin' Fortnite, PS4 bitch
Treat the projects like a motherfuckin' fortress, ayy
We was tryna pull up in them Porsches, ooh
We be tryna pull up in the Porsches, ayy
Only like the cars with the horses
Ferarris and Lambos, you know we hearing voices
Just last week I was mentioned in the Forbes bitch
Young street nigga tryna make another fortune
With my daughter, playin' Fortnite, PS4 bitch
Treat the projects like a motherfuckin' fortress, ayy
We was tryna pull up in them Porsches, ayy
We be tryna pull up in the Porsches, ooh
Only like the cars with the horses
Ferarris and Lambos, you know we hearing voices

[Verse 1]
Projects on Easter, had to throw a party
I sip lean, don't sip Bacardi
Coolin' off with Mei Mei, daddy daughter playdate
Had to have the AR, never had the AK, ooh
Drummer Gang, hundred round drums
Real street nigga and you knowin' how I'm come
Ooh, yeah, make her vomit
Sick of all these niggas but ain't sick of gettin' money
Ooh, you be sick, I get your woman
Ooh, hit a nigga in the melon
Got his whole head throbbin', niggas mobbin'
Keep it mafia, yeah nigga poppin', ooh
Yeah I remember I was robbin'
Only nigga in the Billboard and the Rolling Stone
From the projects, I just signed a contract
I was just in Complex, niggas still don't get the concept
I don't give a fuck who mad about that Pac shit
I don't give a fuck who gettin' mad about that bald shit
All I know is I'm what's out the bricks, I wanna ball bitch
Ayy, ayy, fuck a bald bitch

[Chorus]
Just last week I was mentioned in the Forbes bitch
Young street nigga tryna make another fortune
With my daughter, playin' Fortnite, PS4 bitch

[Verse 2]
HipHopDX, XXL, Fader
Real street nigga, I ain't never been a hater
I was always taught I gotta keep that shit player
Real street nigga runnin' for the mayor
Watts shit, Watts up
We are taught to survive under pressure and you know we got our Glocks up
Ooh, ayy, yeah we don't never love
Got that chopper and you know a nigga finna dump
I'm the only street nigga in the LA Times
LA Weekly, they was talkin' 'bout me doin' crimes
I don't give a fuck, I ain't even have to rhyme
On Genius, these hoes on my penis
White sheets, yeah nigga is a hypebeast
White man, everybody don't like me
Pitchfork, yeah nigga with the pitchfork
Poker and the chopper, what the fuck you talkin' shit for?
I'm the one on VFILES, ooh
Black and white, check these files
I ain't never been a snitch, I ain't never been a bitch
I'm a project nigga, I'm just tryna get rich
03, he so strategic
He so conceited

[Chorus]
