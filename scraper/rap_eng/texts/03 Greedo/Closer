[Intro]
Oh, um
Money changes everything

[Chorus]
If I could kiss you in my room then I would
This dick gon’ make you wish you were from my hood
Just so you cursing me these nights like you should
This dick gon’ make you wish you were from my hood
She was tryna get closer
(She was tryna get closer)
Now she tryna closure
(But now she tryna get closure)
She was tryna get closer, closer, closer
But now she tryna get closure, closure, closure

[Verse 1]
One night, in my life
It just might get you right
Keep blowing
Keep going
Until the morning you gon’ get less lonely
I was homie who you slept on
Now I got you in my bed
This the one that I get sex on
The other bed I use to get some rest
This a trap baby don’t nobody live here
A couple racks, a couple meds, a couple sticks, yeah
I keep it lit just like [?]
Ain’t got a song about another fucking bitch, yeah
I gotta love you just [?]
I gotta fuck you if you wanna be my bitch, yeah
I gotta tuck you if it turned out you the shit
Only time I take my answers to the whip
I’m too legit, yeah

[Chorus]
If I could kiss you in my room then I would
This dick gon’ make you wish you were from my hood
Just so you cursing me these nights like you should
This dick gon’ make you wish you were from my hood

[Verse 2]
I can’t let my eye how you looking so good
Stay by my side like she’s been banging my hood
Let’s fall in love like that love-movie no book
Forget about me after a while like you should
I know this girl that’s just like me from my hood
That’s my old [?]
She gon’ keep her alert
If I were in my situation I would
Keep closer to you like I know that i should
Oh, tryna get closer, closer, closer
Tryna get closer, closer, closer
