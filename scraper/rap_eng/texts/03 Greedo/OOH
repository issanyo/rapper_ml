[Chorus]
From the bottom to the top, top
To the bottom, I came from the streets
Streets made me
Riding from the bottom to the top, top
To the bottom I came from the streets
Streets made me
They like oouu G whats your next move
And I'm like ouuu
Imma do what I gotta do

[Verse 1: G Perico]
Mic check 1, 2
Wanna know did my check come through
I'm a speed demon Glock red beam
Pop rubber bands and hit the money machine
Big blue face, chase, fuck a case
This shit in the hood and I can't be replaced
Murder if I gotta
Come through pop ya the whole entire clip
You won't make it to a doctor
It's DOA, I'm plotting all day
My blue print can't get duplicated
Top of the lines, one of a kind
Put the blue rag on top one time

[Chorus]
From the bottom to the top, top
To the bottom, I came from the streets
Streets made me
Riding from the bottom to the top, top
To the bottom I came from the streets
Streets made me
They like oouu 03 whats your next move
And I'm like ouuu
I might get this shit [?]

[Verse 2]
From the [?]
I paved the lane
I sold the lean, cocaine, herion, I be high as Lil Wayne
Big chopper like
[?]
[?]
Pushing my buttons like I'm a fucking lame, un tame
Wolf of Grape Street, bitch, I ain't with orangutans
Rampage, wouldn't understand this ain't no arcade
Say she wanna ride my joystick like my name Nate
AK's aiming at your chest, no heartbreak
SK's wrinkle up his face like a Shar Pei
Big dog status on these marksmen
I be purple down you better duck like Darkwing, 03

[Chorus]
From the bottom to the top, top
To the bottom, I came from the streets
Streets made me
Riding from the bottom to the top, top
To the bottom I came from the streets
Streets made me
They like oouu 03 whats your next move
And I'm like ouuu
I might get this shit [?]
