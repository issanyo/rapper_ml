[Intro]
Creep, creep music
Whoa Kenny
You know what I'm sayin', Lil Deuce with me
Ready to shoot, ayy

[Chorus]
I swear I bought my first blower from a basehead
And now I get my syrup in the cases
I whip the white girl but I'm not a racist
I swear I bought my first blower from a basehead
I swear I bought my first blower from a, ooh (twenty-five dollars), damn, ooh, ayy
From your mama, and she, ayy (fuck that throat)
From a basehead (I bet these niggas won't play)
Fuck that bitch, always wasted

[Verse]
Bitch I get my syrup in the cases (a lot)
When you pull up and you dancin', don't waste it (in the parking lot)
I ain't playin', when you pull up better shake it (ayy, ayy)
Put that shit inside the liter then she taste it (make that shit shake)
She gon' treat it like some dining room basics (ayy, ayy)
All these cases, bitch you better not break it (bitch be careful, ooh, damn)
I had her suck it even though she had braces (bitch be careful, goddamn)
Ooh, ooh, now I hate the bitch, goddamn
Why you keep actin' so crazy? (why you wildin' and shit bitch?)
Kicked her out that bitch was lazy (bitch ass ho)
You been here for two hours, why you still ain't tried to pay me?
This bitch is crazy, I kicked her out
Now that bitch pullin' back up with her brother
She knew he a blood and she knew I was cousin
But bitch didn't know that that boy was my cousin
Stupid, damn
Y'all got different dads, we got different scams
I was in the trap, oh, damn
I don't know where you was at, I don't know that man, ooh
You don't be where I am, damn, damn (goddamn)
You a nigga in the house, you a nigga on the couch
You was playin' 2K, all you niggas too lame
Ayy, we ain't playin' games
I bought a blower, age of eight, ooh
Takin' aim, don't play no games, ayy
(Make it rain, Drummer Gang)

[Chorus]
I swear I bought my first blower from a basehead
And now I get my syrup in the cases
I whip the white girl but I'm not a racist
I swear I bought my first blower from a basehead
I swear I bought my first blower from a, ooh (twenty-five dollars), damn, ooh, ayy
From your mama, and she, ayy (fuck that throat)
From a basehead (I bet these niggas won't play)
Fuck that bitch, always wasted
