[Intro]
03
Touchdown in the field
Touchdown
First night out
Touchdown in the field
First night out

[Chorus]
Touchdown, I'm in the field
Touchdown to cause hell
I just was sittin' in the cell
You ain't felt how I feel
You ain't been to no jail
You ain't felt like I feel
Gassed up, just rollin' gas with your head down
Don't get touched by the shell

[Interlude]
Oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Feelin' like my big dog when he came home
Used to be pissed off 'til I got home
I get right out and go on WorldStar
I hit that pussy like a pornstar
I had to fuck you like I'm fresh out
Every time I go soft, baby, go hard
When you on TO you gon' send me more than postcards
I want to see it, care package
'Fore I receive it, I ain't trackin'
Where have you seen it?
I'm askin' around
Oh, it's about to go down
Like I'm back on the road, lover
[?] hold me down

[Chorus]
Touchdown, I'm in the field
Touchdown to cause hell
I just was sittin' in the cell
You ain't felt how I feel
You ain't been to no jail
You ain't felt like I feel
Gassed up, just rollin' gas with your head down
Don't get touched by the shell

[Verse 2]
No, I ain't down to tell
Bitch, I am not on bail
If you can't handle jail
Then don't gangbang or sell
If you can't be prepared
No don't post it on there
Pin it off Instagram
Pin it on Instagram
Watching out for the feds
Now they know who I am
If I post my location
Then they know where I am
Bitch, I know you won't talk to me, yeah
You just needed some company
Come here shawty
Bitch I know you looked out for me, yeah
But you needed some company
Come here shawty

[Outro]
Touchdown in the field
Touchdown to cause hell
Field
Touchdown to cause hell
Just was sittin' in the shell
You ain't felt how I feel
You ain't been to no jail
You ain't feel like I feel
Gassed up, just rollin' gas with your head down
By the shell
Touchdown in the field
Yeah
No, this ain't the NFL
Touchdown in the field
Touchdown to cause hell
