[Intro: 03 Greedo]
AceTheFace
03, havin' it, havin' it, havin' it
Havin' it, havin' it
Ron Ron do that shit

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Havin' a hundred bands (a hundred), havin' a hundred band conversation
Money and rubber bands, I put the money right back in rotation
It's a money situation, lil money, big faces (yeah yeah)
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation
Money and rubber bands, I put the money right back in rotation
It's a money situation, lil money, big faces (yeah yeah)
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Havin' it, havin' it, handling packages, 'member we never was having shit
Probably 'cause my lil habitat rarely successes and average hate, just be mad at me
Havin' an attitude like they don't have a bitch, maybe 'cause you sellin' half of shit
Haven't seen half of it, have you went after it?
Have you been accurate? happy my time got immaculate
You haven't been where I've been and you sure haven't macked a bitch
Happy feet with the brick stack when I dance on it
I get the bird just to step on it
Have you been fugitives, not with the foolishness
That's where the tooly is, dirty pineapple look like an Orange Julius
Dropped out of school but I stay where the ruler is
No we ain't cool but I'm cold as the cooler is
Music helped a nigga live, now I gotta feed the kid
I can't blow a nigga wig, so I put a hundred on his wig

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Havin' a hundred bands (a hundred), havin' a hundred band conversation
Money and rubber bands, I put the money right back in rotation
It's a money situation, lil money, big faces (yeah yeah)
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation
Money and rubber bands, I put the money right back in rotation
It's a money situation, lil money, big faces (yeah yeah)
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation

[Verse 2: OMB Peezy]
Havin' a hundred grand conversation
I'm runnin' to them bands, I ain't playin'
I do the dash in that Benz
Fuck the police 'cause they thought I was racin'
I had to go to a different location
White fans made me stop being racist
That bitch got mad at me, callin' my other one
Whip out my dick and put nut on her face
Taste it
I'm sippin' purple and smokin' on purple
That fuse of purple be me lazy
Boom, we slidin' for murder, you know that's my type of occasion
Ayy, I got a hundred bands for you to put his face on the pavement
Hop out with my gun in hand, make you do the running man
I just might kill your daddy, for the shit that his son was sayin'
Hop out with my gun in hand, make you do the running man
I just might kill your daddy, for the shit that his son was sayin'
Peezy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Havin' a hundred bands (a hundred), havin' a hundred band conversation
Money and rubber bands, I put the money right back in rotation
It's a money situation, lil money, big faces (yeah yeah)
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation
Money and rubber bands, I put the money right back in rotation
It's a money situation, lil money, big faces (yeah yeah)
Havin' a hundred bands, havin' a hundred band conversation
