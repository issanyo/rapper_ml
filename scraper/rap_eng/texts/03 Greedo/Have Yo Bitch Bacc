[Intro: 03 Greedo]
You say you tryna ride for a nigga who hatin' on you, you know what I'm sayin'
Have your bitch back, you know what I'm sayin'
Now you fuckin', shit, he fuckin' your bitch and then he like have your bitch back, you know what I'm sayin'
We ain't, we ain't doin' all that man
Don't touch a nigga while he just got a motherfuckin' mistress

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
We don't beef with these niggas over these bitches
Really came out of the trenches, all my niggas is some hitters
All this textin' is ridiculous, tweetin', typin', post an image
Have you ever been offended off the women that we pimpin'
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Have you ever been somebody, no, chopper make your body rock
Drummer Gang my second label, hundred bullets first of all
All money in, stupid bitches never goin' out
No dates, no dates, we don't do no hangin' out
In the kitchen makin' straight rich gang bangers
Outside, other side where I reside, free my cuzzo doin' time
I'm like fuck it, do a line, pop a molly all the time
Let me fuck her with my nine, she a freak, she a thot
Shake somethin', shake somethin', like pepper and salt
I'm the nigga with the sauce, all this flavor in her mouth
Baby got the drip now, you can tell she talkin' different
Must've been around some niggas that'll raise her eyebrow

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
We don't beef with these niggas over these bitches
Really came out of the trenches, all my niggas is some hitters
All this textin' is ridiculous, tweetin', typin', post an image
Have you ever been offended off the women that we pimpin'
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: J. Stone]
We ain't catchin' feelings for pussy poppin', hood boppin'
She gon' take the homies out flockin', you gon' take her shoppin'
All money inner and out, thumbin' through all the bands
Clique full of Drummers, I ain't talkin' 'bout a marching band
I'm the driver and the shooter, got the MAC with the cooler
I'm a mack and a ruler, blowin' racks with my jewelers
She got ass, I'ma toot her, beat it fast and I boot her
Pass her to my producer L-Finguz
Twist my fingers up, I don't give a single fuck
Used to drive the Regal Cut, now I want a Bentley truck
Switch it up, she back that ass up, I be rich rollin'
You can have that bitch back, you report that bitch stolen

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
We don't beef with these niggas over these bitches
Really came out of the trenches, all my niggas is some hitters
All this textin' is ridiculous, tweetin', typin', post an image
Have you ever been offended off the women that we pimpin'
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 3: J. Stone]
We don't beef with you niggas over these bitches
Got my mind on a million since they let me out of prison
Backwood roller, I ain't fuckin' with no swishers
And I got a whole pint, I ain't fuckin' with no liquor
Fuck her then I diss her, you gon' tell her that you miss her
I don't cuff her, I don't kiss her, I don't love her 'cause it's money over bitches
Or should I say riches over snitches
My whole clique is million dollar niggas
Bitch learn somethin', twerk somethin'
Twerk somethin', she gon' fuckin' hurt somethin'
Got the pussy soakin' wet, she gon' fuckin' squirt somethin'
I'm a soldier and a vet, fuck around and murk somethin'
I'm a rider for the set, turn nothin' into somethin'

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
We don't beef with these niggas over these bitches
Really came out of the trenches, all my niggas is some hitters
All this textin' is ridiculous, tweetin', typin', post an image
Have you ever been offended off the women that we pimpin'
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (you can have that bitch back)
Have your bitch back (ayy, ayy, ayy)
