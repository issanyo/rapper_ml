[Intro]
Oh, Mei Mei, ooh, ooh
Mei Mei, hey, ayy, ayy ayy
Mei Mei
Beat Boy taught me

[Chorus]
This for my daughter, listen to the shit I taught you
They don't like to see a black person win
If I go down when I end up out of town
Just understand that I just wanted to live
'Cause when you young and tryna make it where I'm from
They don't want to let you raise your own kids
Fuck what these scary peoples always talkin' 'bout
You gotta get out there and take you a risk
You done seen what I did, you done seen what I did
Street nigga, you done seen what I did
You done seen what I did, you done seen what I did
Street nigga, you done seen what I did, you done

[Verse]
2005 blessed me with my only child
I changed my life 'cause all her life went in and out
Since my eighteenth she been my baby so she know I'm wild
Since she been my baby so she know I'm wild
Used to visit me in jail so she could see me smile
Keep her in Jordan, she say kids be tryna take my style
So fuck it, time for Gucci, ain't think we would make it out
Can't be from Drummer Gang if your kids say you ain't around
Can't be from Drummer Gang if you ain't finna lay shit down
Ho least against us, these hoes disrespectful
I told my daughter never be like her, just run your check up
Stay by my side when I got shot, that's how I know you special
These bad ass kids are not your peers so don't go fold to pressure
This ain't 'bout tough or weak no more, this shit 'bout thinkin' better
Me and my daughter bang the hood, Jordan Downs reppers
And I got metal for a shin, still ain't no half steppin'
You know it ain't nothin' changin' but our addresses

[Chorus]
This for my daughter, listen to the shit I taught you
They don't like to see a black person win
If I go down when I end up out of town
Just understand that I just wanted to live
'Cause when you young and tryna make it where I'm from
They don't want to let you raise your own kids
Fuck what these scary peoples always talkin' 'bout
You gotta get out there and take you a risk
You done seen what I did, you done seen what I did
Street nigga, you done seen what I did
You done seen what I did, you done seen what I did
Street nigga, you done seen what I did, you done seen how I live

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
They don't wanna let me raise my own kid
Yeah, yeah
Mei Mei, ayy ayy
Mei Mei, ayy ayy
Mei Mei, ooh, ayy ayy
Mei Mei, ooh
