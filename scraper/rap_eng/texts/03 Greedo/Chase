[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I've been known to chase, you know I stalk the prey
I see all these wolves around me like I'm watchin' gray
We some beasts, we show our teeth, we just don't conversate
Pull up on you, we can let the chopper talk today
Ayy, I've been known to chase, you know I stalk the prey
I see all these wolves around me like I'm watchin' gray
We some beasts, we show our teeth, we just don't conversate
Pull up on you, I can let the chopper talk today, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Pull up, push up, and pull out, keep my name out of your mouth
Nigga that's out, hatin' ain't what we about, Dolce Gabanna her blouse
I put Chanel on her pouch
I'm on my tip like a tower, inside the pen with the powder
Gettin' some meat, I keep the heat in the shower, lookin' like somethin' to eat
Bitch I'm a beast, I treat the track like a feast, she hit the trap for the fee
She turn the street to a creep, coochie like bustin' a P, you know I'm evil
[?] the eagles, you better duck if you sleepin'
Avalanche, avalanche, over you ho
Can't you just strip it abominable, snow

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I've been known to chase, you know I stalk the prey
I see all these wolves around me like I'm watchin' gray
We some beasts, we show our teeth, we just don't conversate
Pull up on you, we can let the chopper talk today
Ayy, I've been known to chase, you know I stalk the prey
I see all these wolves around me like I'm watchin' gray
We some beasts, we show our teeth, we just don't conversate
Pull up on you, I can let the chopper talk today, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Ketchy the Great]
Big bad wolf ayy, blowin' big cooks, ayy
Hop on the buck and I'm duckin' the 12
I'm runnin', I can't get booked, ayy (no)
Niggas is plottin' but Roman
Got a dick on my dick, I can't get booked, ayy
Racks in my pocket, I pull out a ten
Aw damn, this shit look like a book, ayy
Why the lil nigga run off with the sack
Got your bitch on my pocket, she lookin', ayy
I got a chopper, it eat up the opps
Don't fuck with the cops I'm crooked, ayy
Pulling her bricks out the wood
It's good until her banana pudding, ayy
Maison Margiela, I'm flexin'
I Stinc, I do it, I stick it, I do it, ayy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I've been known to chase, you know I stalk the prey
I see all these wolves around me like I'm watchin' gray
We some beasts, we show our teeth, we just don't conversate
Pull up on you, we can let the chopper talk today
Ayy, I've been known to chase, you know I stalk the prey
I see all these wolves around me like I'm watchin' gray
We some beasts, we show our teeth, we just don't conversate
Pull up on you, I can let the chopper talk today, ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: Doley Bernays]
All these wolves in that sheep clothes, I ain't wearin' no cheap clothes
Margiela my street clothes, only live by that street code
Only know what my street know, ain't got time for no cheap ho
I get paid in my sleep though, all I'm thinkin' is bankrolls
Menace to society with guns up on my belt
Look I'm tryna see in that parking lot if homie needs some help
Checks come in, that phone ringing
Niggas frontin', that chrome singing
Still mingle with hood rats, that's EBT and that cold chicken

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I've been known to chase, you know I stalk the prey
I see all these fools around me like I'm watchin' gray
We some beasts, we show our teeth, we just don't conversate
Pull up on you, we can let the chopper talk today
Ayy, I've been known to chase, you know I stalk the prey
I see all these fools around me like I'm watchin' gray
We some beasts, we show our teeth, we just don't conversate
Pull up on you, I can let the chopper talk today, ayy, ayy
