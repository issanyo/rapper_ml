Chang Chang

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh & 03 Greedo]
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it
MIA with it, we don't play with it
We out in London, we out in Paris
California king now, I had an air bed
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it
MIA with it, we don't play with it
We out in London, we out in Paris
California king now, I had an air bed
I've been down before, I blew up
I was on the blow-up bed
Now I'm that nigga from Los Angeles to New York
Bay Area to Memphis Tenn, yeah

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
I share hoes, she say her last nigga was a scarecrow
Me and Greedy Greed back to back in Sprinter Benz
It's 2018, it's 'bout time that they let some niggas win
My body tatted and my passport matchin'
I'm addicted to traveling, I'm an airport addict
You just 21, you is not no savage
I am stackin' for them days, I am not gon' have it
I'ma pull a drakey out the bag, fuck a rabbit
Now watch him get to hoppin' like a bunny when I clap it
I be overseas, you ain't never left Cali
At the shows with the Queen Bey and I met Khaled
I'm booked, ain't no more room on my calender
This Hellcat'll burn the fuck out your Challenger
High school dropout, I ain't graduate
But I got rich, fed my family, then my niggas ate

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh & 03 Greedo]
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it
MIA with it, we don't play with it
We out in London, we out in Paris
California king now, I had an air bed
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it
MIA with it, we don't play with it
We out in London, we out in Paris
California king now, I had an air bed
I've been down before, I blew up
I was on the blow-up bed
Now I'm that nigga from Los Angeles to New York
Bay Area to Memphis Tenn, yeah

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Fives, tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds
Bitch you ain't the one I want, I wanted
Shoot your shot, the chopper hold a hundred
AR-15 drummin'
Look here bitch
I don't give a fuck about no good hair bitch
We can get some money out some good head bitch
I just keep on sayin' it's a good year bitch
I been blowin' up like a Goodyear blimp
But nigga don't tempt me
I'ma squeeze my finger on the chopper 'til it's empty
Know I keep that Bun B, rest in peace Pimp C
If UGK, best be ridin' dirty with me
I feel like a legend, got some time to do in Texas
I can't make a statement, guess they just don't get the message
Smokin' lines, sippin' lean, know that line ain't hit the 'znie
Just sendin' them tracks out of town, address it

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh & 03 Greedo]
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it
MIA with it, we don't play with it
We out in London, we out in Paris
California king now, I had an air bed
We in the Bay with it, we in LA with it
MIA with it, we don't play with it
We out in London, we out in Paris
California king now, I had an air bed
I've been down before, I blew up
I was on the blow-up bed
Now I'm that nigga from Los Angeles to New York
Bay Area to Memphis Tenn, yeah
