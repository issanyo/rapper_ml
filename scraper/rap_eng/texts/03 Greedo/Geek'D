Thank You Fizzle

[Chorus: Destodubb]
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
The bitch that I'm fuckin', is fucking OG
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
She sucking my dick like she ain't got no teeth
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
The bitch that I'm fuckin', is fucking OG
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
She sucking my dick like she ain't got no teeth
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd

[Verse 1: Destodubb]
I change my clothes more than I sleep
I buy a pint every day of the week
Maison Margiela they up on my feet
Tweaking so hard, that you think I'ma tweet
Tweaking so hard, she notices me
Bathing ape jacket and bathing ape tee
I take your gram, so you know I be geek'd
I'm in a fit, and these Maisons be [?]
I fuck your bitch and her pussy antique
I fuck your momma, she pay for my lean
I go for the [?], I do not retreat
Kick the bitch out cause Im smellin' her feet
I'm at the top cause your nigga can't reach
Your time is over, you just reach your peak
Your breath stank, that shit really weak

[Chorus: Destodubb]
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
The bitch that I'm fuckin', is fucking OG
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
She sucking my dick like she ain't got no teeth
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
The bitch that I'm fuckin', is fucking OG
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
She sucking my dick like she ain't got no teeth
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
When I'm off the lean, the bitch lean
Should I pop a molly or geek
Percocet x codeine, I do everything
Right now off 03, everybody love 03
Free the drugs 03, they wanna see me free
Bitch do the splits for a cheque, hope you suckin' dick
Bitch do the splits for a trick, hope you suckin' dick
I'm a samurai, you stand up high, every time you hit
I'm a samurai, you stand up high, you gripin' on my hips

[Chorus: Destodubb]
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
The bitch that I'm fuckin', is fucking OG
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
She sucking my dick like she ain't got no teeth
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
The bitch that I'm fuckin', is fucking OG
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
She sucking my dick like she ain't got no teeth
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd

[Verse 3: Destodubb]
Off of the molly, I'm feeling real jolly
Pourin' up lean, that is my hobby
All of this ice, you think I play hockey
I'm off the molly, I'm locked in the lobby
I'm off the molly, I'm going to papi
Fuckin' your momma, she actin' all yachty
Feel like a boss, they callin' me Gotti
Right on my head, I'm feeling like yachty
Seated Maclaren is parked in the lobby
You see my bitch, you know she a baddy
Went to the [?], and bought me some [?]
You bought this cup and noticed I'm coughin'
All of this weed, you think that it's foggy
All of this money, these niggas is salty
Riding my wave, just call me tsunami
Used to be broke eating salami

[Chorus: Destodubb]
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
The bitch that I'm fuckin', is fucking OG
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
She sucking my dick like she ain't got no teeth
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
The bitch that I'm fuckin', is fucking OG
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
She sucking my dick like she ain't got no teeth
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
Off of the molly, I'm Geek'd
