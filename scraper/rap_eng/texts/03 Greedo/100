[Intro: Drakeo the Ruler]
I tried to tell you nigga, shit get deep
The homewrecker, Paul Bunyan knocking down Christmas trees
Mr. T chains, yeah it's glistening tremendously
It's all about the benjamins, a hundred when I stick and move
Itâ€™s the 2, Greedy bastards in a Bentley coupe
Acting like Mystikal with eighty bands on Instagram
Ignant, belligerent
I should've went to college with my penmanship

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
Stop playing with me
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Punk bitch I got a hundred in my men and that
Hundred dance like ten and ask
And they all got bloody neck, bitch I made it out the 'ject
Pussy ass niggas couldn't stop it now I got respect
Birdman of the set, ho you see me taking rip
You ain't seen a hundred yet, all my niggas runnin' trip
That lil pussy nigga who was hating, I just split his wig
I ain't tryna one again so you just be on weird shit
Real shit, not the type of nigga that I deal with
When I sign a deal for a million, it's cheap to pay killing
'Cause more than they want money, niggas die to feel this feeling
Meanwhile remix and go down in pieces
Bitch we a whole 'nother species

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
Stop playing with me
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
A hundred in the Draco, a hundred ain't no snaking
I'm finding out a hundred, another hundred whip Mercedes
If I don't get a J pay then you don't call me baby
Crazy, lady, give 'em stinky faces
I'm dealing with emotions only 'cause it's entertainment
When a nigga sneak diss me he get shot for entertainment
Stop playin', my lil niggas shady
A nigga wouldn't be rappin' but I do this shit for KD

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
A hundred on my wrist, a hundred on my neck
A hundred on the Draco mean a hundred niggas dead
Stop playing with me
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good
You lil niggas don't be getting no money but it be sounding good

[Outro: Drakeo the Ruler]
Wait back up, say it again
I been out two days, we right, you know that
We was driving foreigns and all that
It was that ignorant shit, nigga I got it
I'm back, and this shit regular
Mister mister mister mister mister, shit
I guess that's me huh?
