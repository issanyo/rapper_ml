[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Big grape street, dick make her legs shake
Bake weight, cook cake, shake and bake
Chickens and the plays on Debo with the tools
Hit your own face, fake xans with the dinner plate
Leave your ass work on the innerstate
You can mix the Cali grape with a real Memphis grape
Beat a roll in dust down, wrap you up in duct tape
I just want the motherfuckin' bills like a duck face
Fuck love, fuck hate
Young Dolph still straight
Pino got cake, Daddio got cake
Paper Route Business
She on work gettin' blue flakes
Purple all over my suitcase
Purple racks, Rollie got a blue face
Willy Wonka, ho's dick blue face
Blue street diamonds and the blue jeans
Put a fuck nigga in a food chain
Kickin' shit, Johnny K, Liu Kang
Free my niggas out the cool cage
Tied up, shoelace, you late
VVS, motherfuckers too fake
Paper Route jumpin' gang, blowin' by 'em, Hussein
Bitch my whole section treat a nigga like Lil Wayne
All black, glove mask, car fast, Bruce Wayne
Duffle bag boy but I still ain't met 2 Chainz

[Chorus: Jay Fizzle]

[Verse 3: Jay Fizzle]
Flew up out to Cali with the grapes
Go and kick dubs with my locs
They see me on game, I don't want it
Grape street nigga do the most (crip)
All I do is bang and sell dope (on crip)
Purple rags tatted 'round my ho (on crip)
I turn the club to a crip meeting (bitch)
Got the whole joint down in my show (yeah)
Purple racks, left side hanging (gang)
Purple street baby love gang (gang)
