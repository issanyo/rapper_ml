[Intro: 03 Greedo]
You know what I'm sayin', we creep up on niggas
We sit back and watch everything and swoop down on shit, you know what I'm sayin'
Haha, 03 (Beat Boy taught me, Ron Ron do that shit)

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Ketchy the Great]
Killers like condors (vultures)
You better not snore (vultures)
Kick down your front door (urrr)
Put you to sleep, all my niggas gon' creep
Killers like condors (vultures)
You better not snore (vultures)
Kick down your front door (urrr)
Put you to sleep, all my niggas gon' creep
Ayy, killers like condors (vultures)
Killers like condors (vultures)
Killers like condors (vultures)
Creep up on niggas, we creep up like roaches
Killers like condors, vultures
Killers like condors, vultures
Killers like condors
Creep up on niggas, we creep up like roaches (roaches)

[Verse 1: Ketchy the Great]
Killer like John Wick
I got the flame on me, no Bic
Bust him over the head with a Glock, I'm trippin'
Meat cleaver chop him up, I'm a demon
I'm schemin', I'm cold, I'm anemic
I got the heater, I do not kick it like FIFA
Bring it to your door like pizza
Bitch I lean, I'm the tour of Pisa (mud)
Heckler & Koch, have you restin' in pieces
Greedo get poppin' like grease for no reason (oh my God, oh my God)
Face tats on, janky lil nigga
Can't get a job so I'm servin' the clearance
Back at the trap, I'm thuggin' with my killer
Gang shit, been in the vip, go gorilla
Draco shells flyin' at a monkey nigga
Heats up, back up, I'm 'bout to dump the nigga
I'm a nice guy, but I'l get tricky
Lord forgive me for the sins I'm commiting
Committed, to not going out on no bitch shit
I'ma join my vultures, ready to hit shit
Hit a lick, don't play, I'm too serious
I got K's like the Ku Klux member
I got nines like the month of September
Lean in my life, I don't make a decision, nah

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Ketchy the Great]
Killers like condors (vultures)
You better not snore (vultures)
Kick down your front door (urrr)
Put you to sleep, all my niggas gon' creep
Killers like condors (vultures)
You better not snore (vultures)
Kick down your front door (urrr)
Put you to sleep, all my niggas gon' creep
Ayy, killers like condors (vultures)
Killers like condors (vultures)
Killers like condors (vultures)
Creep up on niggas, we creep up like roaches
Killers like condors, vultures
Killers like condors, vultures (03)
Killers like condors
Creep up on niggas, we creep up like roaches (roaches)

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Coyotes and leopards and lions
Hyenas, piranhas, play possum, we come just to eat you
Bitch I'm a crip, I'm a creep, I'm a creature
I grew up where you could get jacked for your sneakers
Got hitters who used to get ass for they teachers
Bow legged stance, used to meet by the bleachers
Got niggas in touch with they feelings who reaching
Off Excstacy, drink, liquor, mixed with the lean
With that white up they nose like they clean it with Kleenix
Poppin' that pussy, she play with the penis
Ballin' with O's in the strap like Arenas
Sellin' out traps, now we sell out arenas
Sit on the game floor (sit on the game floor)
Killers like condors (killers like condors)
Dealers on my tour (dealers on my tour)
I got a life boy (you know I got a life boy)
What the fuck I'ma fight for? (what the fuck I'ma fight for?)
No she's nothing to die for (no she's nothing to die for)
Django, we smokin' them white boys (smokin' them white boys)
Cookies filthy, they makin' that white noise (makin' that white noise)
Loud make a fuck nigga's ears bleed
Flyest killers you done ever seen
Hop out the cut and I bleed the scene
Horn keep a look, you can see the 'stige

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Ketchy the Great]
Killers like condors (vultures)
You better not snore (vultures)
Kick down your front door (urrr)
Put you to sleep, all my niggas gon' creep
Killers like condors (vultures)
You better not snore (vultures)
Kick down your front door (urrr)
Put you to sleep, all my niggas gon' creep
Ayy, killers like condors (vultures)
Killers like condors (vultures)
Killers like condors (vultures)
Creep up on niggas, we creep up like roaches
Killers like condors, vultures
Killers like condors, vultures
Killers like condors
Creep up on niggas, we creep up like roaches (roaches)
