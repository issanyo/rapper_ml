[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, Kane season
Twinkle on the beat, yeah
Twinkle on the beat, yeah
Whoa Kenny
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Smoking with a package then the package get you fucked off
When they sent the po-po to my door but y'all was ducked off
Fuckin' up a plate of sushi wontons with the duck sauce
Sent the pack of doggy to me, walkin' fuckin' buff soft
Pick your phone up, I just touched down with the bow wow
Pick your phone up, I just touched down with the puppy chow
Puttin' zones up, got a brick, I'm 'bout to bust it down
Pick your phone up, bet that rat ho wanna fuck me now
Fuck me now, busy button down, bust it down
Fuck the ones, throw some hundreds down
Hundred pack, fifty pack, shippin' twenty piece
Chicken bucket, chicken nugget, bitch I feed the streets
Chopper block, mix that dope up with that Fetty Wap (1738)
Watch it drop, bitch I started sellin' ready rock, fuck a pot
You don't make a G a day you can't sit in the spot
Ho keep lookin' at me, you gon' suck this dick or not?

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Take a bag, bust a lick, and run a check ho, a check ho
Bet them VV's in my neck glow
I just might go throw a Rollie on my next ho
Beat the pussy in the studio like Death Row, Death Row
Chopper give a nigga Death Row, Death Row
Fuck a rookie, need a vet ho
I just might go throw a Rollie on my next ho
Hundred kilos in my trunk, I might get Death Row

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Cruisin' through the city in my oh-eighteen (skrrt)
Sendin' the bitches, servin' the fiends (ooh)
Ridin' through the street, just caught a lick (yeah)
Take that flip and I caught my first brick (ayy)
I'm a Baby Loc cri-ni-nip, role model ni-ni-nip
I ain't got the swag and got the sauce, I got the dri-ni-nip
I can do a feature, do a show, and hit the dealership
Ask Channel 7, people say I'm really dealin' shit
Brrrt my ad-lib, Drummer Gang, we generous
We gon' give your ass the blues 'cause we ain't never givin' shit
Everybody generals 'cause everybody militant
Drummer Gang the Army, the Navy, we killin' shit, ooh

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Take a bag, bust a lick, and run a check ho, a check ho
Bet them VV's in my neck glow
I just might go throw a Rollie on my next ho
Beat the pussy in the studio like Death Row, Death Row
Chopper give a nigga Death Row, Death Row
Fuck a rookie, need a vet ho
I just might go throw a Rollie on my next ho
Hundred kilos in my trunk, I might get Death Row
