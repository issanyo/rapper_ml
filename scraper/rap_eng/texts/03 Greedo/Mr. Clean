[Chorus]
I just got married to marijuana, I fell in love with the lean
Me and the powder a power couple, I'm feelin' like Mr. Clean
I'm in the kitchen, ayy
I'm in the kitchen, I'm fuckin' with dishes and I'm in the kitchen
I got the water and you know I'm whippin', yeah I'm in the kitchen
I'm in the kitchen, I'm in the kitchen
I'm in the kitchen, I'm in the kitchen, ayy

[Verse 1]
Make her wonder like white bread
More cap than a bald head
I was livin' in the kitchen, whippin'
Ooh, damn, baby just look at my wrist hit, ayy
Baby I'm takin' them risks, ayy
Baby you know we official
If they knock on my door then I'm itching
Baseball, downin' baseball, talkin' baseball, keep it quiet
God level, I'm like Pastor Mase, I was just preachin' to the choir
Hell yeah I'm gettin' high, hell yeah I'm on fire
Just like Richard Pryor, but I hope I won't die
Bitch you know I'm facin' life, Jordan Downs where it's trife
I can't even trust my wife, knife knife
She'll stab me in my side, homie stabbed me in my back
I was tryna get the racks, now a nigga get the packs, yeah
What goes around comes around
We don't play games

[Chorus]
I just got married to marijuana, I fell in love with the lean
Me and the powder a power couple, I'm feelin' like Mr. Clean
I'm in the kitchen, ayy
I'm in the kitchen, I'm fuckin' with dishes and I'm in the kitchen
I got the water and you know I'm whippin', yeah I'm in the kitchen
I'm in the kitchen, I'm in the kitchen
I'm in the kitchen, I'm in the kitchen, ayy

[Verse 2]
Walk out the county
Right next to the money counter
Microwave and a hundred thousand
I got the money piling
I think I might just buy an island
Told my label I don't need a stylist, ooh
And I'm shoppin' up in fifths closet
You ain't gotta doubt it
Put that fur around my collar, I will never call her
She just want a baller, prayin' for my daughter
I can't get her pregnant, she gon' want the dollars
And that bitch a negative (yeah)
I got pictures of you naked bitch, don't make me expose you

[Chorus]
I just got married to marijuana, I fell in love with the lean
Me and the powder a power couple, I'm feelin' like Mr. Clean
I'm in the kitchen, ayy
I'm in the kitchen, I'm fuckin' with dishes and I'm in the kitchen
I got the water and you know I'm whippin', yeah I'm in the kitchen
I'm in the kitchen, I'm in the kitchen
I'm in the kitchen, I'm in the kitchen, ayy

[Outro]
Drummer Gang in this thing
Life from EA
Met her in Buckhead
Do you fuck for a prayer?
Whoa, get over just to get the head
Ayy, they gonna play a game
So you gotta play a game, god level
God level, god level, god level, god level
Ayy that's what my god-mama used to say
God level, every time she'd talk, on Grape
Auntie Gil, that's my god-mama, on crip
