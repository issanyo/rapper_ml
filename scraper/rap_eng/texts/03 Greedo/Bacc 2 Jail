[Intro]
If I go back
Turbo

[Chorus]
Go back to jail, would you ride?
If I go back to jail, tell me would you stay right by my side?
If I go back
If I go back to jail

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna hide from hell, I hope I'm makin' bail
I keep them drugs on scales, are you gon' be for real?
I want your love like Kelis said, tell me everything, I need it
Tell me are you gon' see bae?
When I send out that message, would you send me that package?
Workin' hard so all that access
These niggas never been to prison
So they can't understand what I said
In it for bread, been indicted by the feds

[Chorus]
If I go back to jail, would you ride for a nigga?
If I go back to jail, would you lie for a nigga?
I'm tryna run from hell, ride for a nigga
I hope I make the bail, lie to a nigga

[Verse 2]
If I go back to prison, would you send me some pictures?
Would you buy that cell, and you know we gettin' richer
I put her on that Backpage, yeah
Bitch we fell in love backstage, yeah
If I just gave you bars, would you ride on a nigga?
If I just came too hard, would you lie to a nigga?
And say that you loved, I'm who you fuck with
Never left when it was ugly, that's how I know you love me
If I go back to jail, would you ride?
Go back to jail, would you lie for a nigga?
Baby don't hide from a nigga
When I'm gone just get high for a nigga
If I don't get a deal, like this lil nigga
Or is you givin' up?
Or you just don't give a fuck
If I'm gone for less than three years, don't give it up
If I go back to jail
