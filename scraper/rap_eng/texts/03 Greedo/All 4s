[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
All, all, down on all, all 4's
She got down on all 4's, while I'm rollin' a 4
She make her knees touch her bows, fingertips touching her toes
She pickin' up all that dough
She gon' crawl on the floor, she go down on all 4's
Just like all of my ho's
Down on all 4's
Down on all 4's
She picking up all that dirt off the floor

[Verse 1: RJ]
Got my bitch on my roll, there's some shit you don't know
She get rid of her clothes, put my kids on her cloth
She get hit on the low
These thing been going on for a minute
My name ain't Business but ooh I be in it
She throw it back play the bay like I'm Emmit, Yeah
Then I double back like a kidney
She hit the stage, same way that I hit the stage
I'm a dog let the cat out the cage
From LA but she dance in the A
All for Mr. LA from the pole to the play
From the stroll to the mirror
Pick up the dope put it in my Ameris
You know we on this a hit when you hear it
Won't disappear and appear. disappear...

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
She got down on all 4's, on all 4's
She make her knees touch her bows, fingertips touching her toes
She pickin' up all that dough
She gon' crawl on the floor, she got down on all 4's
Just like all of my ho's
She got down on all 4's
Just like all of my ho's
Down on all 4's
Down on all 4's
She picking up all that (all that D)

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Watch her go down on the D
She been around my whole clique
Even look like a b
Pull up in stores with the stick and hes talking all that shit 03 make all of the hits
Be like don't quit, bitch I'm an addict, addicted to ratchet
Watching the book-makers here automatically
Beat that shit up like its mad at me
Hyper hygiene like a canopy, I'm in this bitch with a strategy
Baby keep shaking that ass for me, I love you for your mentality
Give me that money, swervin' through lanes
Life with drumma gang
I'm with you, up in this thang, baby we making it rain
Can't hang with no lames, we checking for shine
She wants the world when she got on all 4's

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
She got down on all 4's, on all 4's
She make her knees do the most, fingertips touching her toes
She pickin' up all that dough
She gon' crawl on the floor, she got down on all 4's
Just like all of my ho's
She got down on all 4's
Just like all of my ho's
Down on all 4's
Down on all 4's
She picking up all the dough...
Down on all 4's
Down on all 4's
She picking up all the dough...
