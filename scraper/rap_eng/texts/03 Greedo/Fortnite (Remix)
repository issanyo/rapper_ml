[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Look at my Twitter, you feel me
They talkin' 'bout my uh, my peoples TK, Picaso in the Forbes magazine
That they talkin' 'bout us

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Just last week I was mentioned in the Forbes bitch
Young street nigga tryna make another fortune
With my daughter, playin' Fortnite, PS4 bitch
Treat the projects like a motherfuckin' fortress, ayy
We was tryna pull up in them Porsches, ooh
We be tryna pull up in the Porsches, ayy
Only like the cars with the horses
Ferarris and Lambos, you know we hearing voices
Just last week I was mentioned in the Forbes bitch
Young street nigga tryna make another fortune
With my daughter, playin' Fortnite, PS4 bitch
Treat the projects like a motherfuckin' fortress, ayy
We was tryna pull up in them Porsches, ayy
We be tryna pull up in the Porsches, ooh
Only like the cars with the horses
Ferarris and Lambos, you know we hearing voices

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Projects on Easter, had to throw a party
I sip lean, don't sip Bacardi
Coolin' off with Mei Mei, daddy daughter playdate
Had to have the AR, never had the AK, ooh
Drummer Gang, hundred round drums
Real street nigga and you knowin' how I'm come
Ooh, yeah, make her vomit
Sick of all these niggas but ain't sick of gettin' money
Ooh, you be sick, I get your woman
Ooh, hit a nigga in the melon
Got his whole head throbbin', niggas mobbin'
Keep it mafia, yeah nigga poppin', ooh
Yeah I remember I was robbin'
Only nigga in the Billboard and the Rolling Stone
From the projects, I just signed a contract
I was just in Complex, niggas still don't get the concept
I don't give a fuck who mad about that Pac shit
I don't give a fuck who gettin' mad about that bald shit
All I know is I'm what's out the bricks, I wanna ball bitch
Ayy, ayy, fuck a bald bitch

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Ooh, fuck her three times 'cause she gorgeous, ooh
Went and got the Rari, not the Porsche bitch, ooh
Married to the money, no divorce shit, ooh
Two hundred fifty on my neck bitch, cool
I'm a boss, real CEO
King of the hill, pull up in a Ghost, ooh
Bring your neck close, order mega toast
And my wrist gross, throw up on them hoes
Skrrt, I might crash the Porsche
Money on me nigga got a face of course
And my shoes, you can barely afford
Might get a Lambo with the suicide doors
I got three or five hoes, I'm a pimp
You a lil nigga, somethin' like a shrimp
Too many racks, make a real nigga limp
Now the gang blowed up like a blimp
Too much ice on my wrist, oh that's drip
I ain't kick it with your bitch, she a rip
Oh my girl, she an ocean, you might slip
I might take her to the island, it's a trip
Need my check please, you can't catch me
Way before the deal I been ridin' Bentleys
Why you cappin', 'cause my bag extra hefty
Cashed out an a coupe 'cause it's sexy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
