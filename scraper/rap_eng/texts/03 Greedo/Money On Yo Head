[Intro]
Money on your head
Money on your head
Money on your head
Long live Lil Money

[Chorus]
Money on your head, yeah
Tired of getting perfect
I can kill you with some bread, yeah
I'm still running from the feds, yeah
But it's money on your, money on your head, yeah
I got tired of getting perfect
I can kill you with some bread, yeah
I'm still running from the feds, yeah
But it's money on your, money on your head
Money on your head
Money on your head, money on your head
Money on your head

[Verse]
My lil nigga dead, yeah
Now it's money on your head, yeah
We gon' put these kids to bed, yeah
They still haven't freed my grandad
All the Drummers bringin' hell, yeah
Choppers shaking like an earthquake
Love these bitches like a mermaid
Thirties with me like we dykin'
For you niggas it's a bad plan
Glad I made it out the car man
You ain't made it off the porch yet
This purple rack just like a toy man
You play with us and it be go time
Baby I'm working my wrist
Baby I'm working my move
Baby I'm taking the chips
I'm getting paid by the street
Greedy ain't makin' no diss
Niggas been hating on me
But I ain't makin' no diss
Baby I'm breaking the dish, hey
I want that wet on my fist, hey
Drummer Gang, we petty likin'
We just really like the violence
All my niggas steady swervin'
All my niggas steady swervin', yeah
(Money on your head, money on your head)

[Chorus]
Money on your head, yeah
Tired of getting perfect
I can kill you with some bread, yeah
I'm still running from the feds, yeah
But it's money on your, money on your head, yeah
I got tired of getting perfect
I can kill you with some bread, yeah
I'm still running from the feds, yeah
But it's money on your, money on your head
Money on your head
Money on your head, money on your head
Money on your head
