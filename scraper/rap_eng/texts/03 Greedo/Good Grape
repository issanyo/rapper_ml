[Intro]
X load it up bro
All the time
Know she heard that good grape make her legs shake
X on the beat make it boom

[Chorus]
Who got all the cake? who got all the cake?
I got all the flavor, said she want a taste
Who got all the cake? who got all the cake?
I got all the flavor, baby said she want a taste
Said she heard that good grape make her legs shake
Said she heard that good grape make her legs shake
I know you heard that good grape make your legs shake
Know you heard that good grape make your legs shake

[Verse 1]
Look baby, let me see you make that ass shake
Pop that pussy like a pill for a headache
Gotta shake it like a motherfuckin' earthquake
Ayy-ayy, I don't want a taste
Ooh baby, put that shit right in my face
Ooh baby, put that shit right in my face
Ooh, hope you old enough, can't catch a case
Let me see your ID or just show your age
Fresh out of high school, okay I think I like you
Talk about what we might do

[Chorus]
Who got all the cake? who got all the cake?
I got all the flavor, said she want a taste
Who got all the cake? who got all the cake?
I got all the flavor, baby said she want a taste
Said she heard that good grape make her legs shake
Said she heard that good grape make her legs shake
I know you heard that good grape make your legs shake
Know you heard that good grape make your legs shake

[Verse 2]
Yeah, love me all night
Don't fall in love I got wonder and I
Fell in love with my life, but it's just for one night
She only wanna fuck to get in free at clubs
She wanna be on stage like she rich as us
Perpetrating, fall in love when you twerk it baby
Fuck with me, you don't need nobody
Lights on, wanna see your body
I won't let you see nobody
Better make me your hobby

[Chorus]
Who got all the cake? who got all the cake?
I got all the flavor, said she want a taste
Who got all the cake? who got all the cake?
I got all the flavor, baby said she want a taste
Said she heard that good grape make her legs shake
Said she heard that good grape make her legs shake
I know you heard that good grape make your legs shake
Know you heard that good grape make your legs shake

[Verse 3]
Touch your toes, make your knees touch your elbows
Head down, pussy poppin' on the headstand
Touch your toes, make your knees touch your elbows
Head down, pussy poppin' on the headstand
Head down, head down
Twerk somethin', shake somethin', make somethin'
Twerk somethin', shake somethin', make somethin'
Twerk somethin', shake somethin', make somethin'
I'ma fuck you just so I can taste somethin', yeah

[Chorus]
Who got all the cake? who got all the cake?
I got all the flavor, said she want a taste
Who got all the cake? who got all the cake?
I got all the flavor, baby said she want a taste
Said she heard that good grape make her legs shake
Said she heard that good grape make her legs shake
I know you heard that good grape make your legs shake
Know you heard that good grape make your legs shake
