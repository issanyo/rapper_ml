[Chorus]
I heard 03 got all the heat
My side, two bitches in one whip
Niggas thought it was all over
Beatin' me, how can I sober
Say I'm surrounded by vultures
Now I'm surrounded by soldiers
Should we get right to the gunplay
He got a hundred he gon' say
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard

[Verse]
That we went down undercover
I'm back out on bail and I'm still raising hell
Feeling like Slater or Screech, got a white girl with me and got saved by the bell
Look at me funny, they want me to disappear like I'm Dave Chappelle
I get it out of thin air, still gettin' packs in the mail
What type of drugs do you sell?
Last year I needed some help
Now I can get it myself
I was the shit in the cell
Thought I won't get out of jail
People sayin' I got ninety-nine years
I got ninety-nine sales for your bitch and I'm here
Ninety-nine problems but bitches ain't near
Xanny barbarian like I'm golden ear
Purple a soldier but I don't romance
I'm usually off a few lines when I dance
Baby got me in the times when I glance
I turn a white girl and pry with no hands
Kitchen whippin' 'til I go down again
Drummer gang family, we don't want no friends
Test that nigga to the final exam
I left the hood like the white boys and text the Trans-Ams
Free my bro Speed, let's get back to them grams
Free Facka Flee, free Yapo every time
Free Scavy D, slugs on me, this god's plan

[Chorus]
I heard 03 got all the heat
My side, two bitches in one whip
Niggas thought it was all over
Beatin' me, how can I sober
Say I'm surrounded by vultures
Now I'm surrounded by soldiers
Should we get right to the gunplay
He got a hundred he gon' say
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard

[Outro]
I, I heard I got life
I heard I went on the run, I heard I wasn't on the run
I'm lyin' 'bout a case, I don't chat Greedo bro
Greedo back, keep talkin', hey, ho
More money, more change
More money, more change
More money, more change
More money, more change
More money, more change
More money, more change
More money, more change
More money, more change
