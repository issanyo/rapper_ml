Three purple hearts
Three purple hearts
Three purple hearts

[Verse]
She ain't love me 'til she saw me shine
Playin' with a nigga all this time
You ain't love me 'til you saw me shine
Playin' with a nigga all this time
She wear a minute, now I'm on your mind
Since I lost Lil Money I been on my grind
Always been one hundred, never told her lies
I can't let her go, I will never really know why
Shay Shay you got my attention
Sorry for times I went missing
Have you heard 'bout whose lips I'm kissin'
I understand why you keepin' your distance
But I still love you
And I never care who done fucked you
Been in this game, I can't judge, wave it above you
That's what these lames do
Know I done played you so I can't blame you
But why you so playful? don't make me hate you
I never fake and act like you wasn't there when I had nothing at the bottom
Now I'm at the top, that's why everything that you ever want, you know you got it
Sucker for love, fuck with a thug
She ain't leave when I was broke and I was strung out on them drugs
Stored at nothin' but under three purple heart
Stored at nothin' but under three purple heart
Stored at nothin' but under three
Stored at nothin' but under three
Now she fuck with 03, purple hearts, yeah
Stored at nothin' but under three purple heart
