[Intro]
Hey, 03
Yeah

[Chorus]
We woke up
Intoxicated off of all type of drugs
I'm never sober when I'm in love
I need some type of drugs
I need some type of substance
She keep sendin' me subs
I need some type of substance
She keep sendin' me subs
So I need some type of drugs

[Verse]
So I hit up my plug
Wanna spend some time with a thug?
Come here, suck a dick in the club
Type of bitch who don't give a fuck
Fallin' in love
I'm off all type of drugs, oh
She keep sendin' me subs
I need bread and the cheese
I'm the center of the streets
I need premium fee
That's the boss, he in me
Come and fly with a P
Woah, I'm putting drugs in my tree
Bitch, you know I'm a fiend
Give you all to me
Take a dose, maybe three
It's only one of three

[Chorus]
We woke up
Intoxicated off of all type of drugs
I'm never sober when I'm in love
I need some type of drugs
I told that bitch I need substance
She keep sendin' me subs
I told that bitch I need substance
And she keep sendin' me subs
So that means I need some type of drugs

[Bridge]
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
I drank some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
I told her take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Baby, take some, drank some
Pop it like some ecstasy

[Outro]
We woke up
Somewhere by the sea
That's the buzz, he in me
Come and fly with a P
Ooh, I'm a wolf you lookin' at, ayy
Lookin' like somethin' to eat
You know I'ma creep
Ice man in my cheek
In the snow it's a freeze
And snortin' blow is a key, yeah
