[Intro: Drakeo the Ruler]
Nigga stop playin', I just left Hsu Yun
I don't rap beef, I just know TECs and drums
And you ain't do it right if no detectives come
And I brought kate into the booth, ain't got no extra tie
You can say my wrist broke but my neck is fire
Flu flamm the rap game 'til I get extradited
Judging by my case files I'm obsessed with rifles
Had a meeting with the floggers just to say I'm they idol

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict (I don't rap beef)
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (for real)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (just sayin')
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you (nigga I don't rap beef)
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (I don't rap beef)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (you see it nigga)
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you

[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Don't at me
Fuck it, please bro at me
They gon' have to find a suitable picture for Fox 11
You ain't learn from Cold Devil, I'm a nuisance, I'm tellin' you
Take a mud walk through Neimans like I got expensive power
I got dirty money on me but I just got out the shower
I'll shoot up everything, we ain't squabbling for hours
I can tell that nigga sour, plug talkin' with alfalfa
Know my attitude is childish, if I spoke to you be honored
I'm a flu flammer nigga, two pumps when I enter
Tryna break a Kylie Jenner, bitch I'm Drakeo, I'm a winner
Niggas in the Twitter fingers, if I shoot you there's no ending
The flashing lights on my pendant, I'm a legend out of prison
I'm a front door kicker, Liu Kang was my mentor
Off a five and a perc, two thirty was the printin'
Out of school from suspension, not because it was dismissal
And my dick old nigga, bro I know you niggas miss me

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict (I don't rap beef)
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (for real)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (just sayin')
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you (nigga I don't rap beef)
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (I don't rap beef)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (you see it nigga)
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
[?] dot it twice, dot the checks three times
I'm really used to chasing seconds in my free times
Claim they have enough so I had to serve 'em three times
Bitch I'm 03 so I'm watchin' out for one time
I can turn a hater to a motherfuckin' punchline
Down later gators with a motherfuckin' Glock nine
I got some designer and some weapons so I won't die
Won't we make it slap, we treat a rapper like a horsefly
Ride the wave, this ain't a boat ride
Yankee got the stick and Lil Kitty got the four-five
Locked tools, strapped up, and them niggas gon' try
Watch out for the G-Hive
I'm from the side where we G-Slide
I need blue hundreds on green guys (on green greens)
I'm off the mud and the tree slide
We out the slums, fresh out the slums

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict (I don't rap beef)
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (for real)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (just sayin')
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you (nigga I don't rap beef)
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic (I don't rap beef)
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bali (you see it nigga)
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you
