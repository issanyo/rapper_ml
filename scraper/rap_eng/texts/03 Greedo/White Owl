[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Who got the white now, white now, I now, I now, I now

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Right now, right now, right now
I'm goin' up like a white owl, white owl, white owl
I'm getting high like a white owl, white owl, white owl
I'm up all night like a white owl, white owl, white owl
Iced out like a white owl, white owl, white owl
And I'm talkin' 'bout it right now, right now, right now
Bitch I gotta do it right now, right now, right now
I been goin' up right now, right now, right now
Matter fact with a white owl, white owl, white owl
White owl, white owl, white owl
White owl, white owl, white owl
Goin' up right now, right now, right now

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Right now, right now, goin' up like a white owl
White owl, white owl, cover up, eat them white out
Iced out, iced out, she put bling by her eyebrow
She got tattoos and piercings, she wanna experiment
Double up like Spearmint, two hoes, no period
Cold as Alaska, bitch chill out, now cool it
Like the crib, blue side of the fridge, stuck inside that freezer
Wrist shiver like windshield
I got that ice and J pass, I ain't talkin' no windshield
Blow like a windmill, turn his meal to tinmill
Ketchup just gave me like ten pills
Nocturnal take it, just off this new Benadryl
Back in the pen, ayy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Right now, right now, right now
I'm goin' up like a white owl, white owl, white owl
I'm getting high like a white owl, white owl, white owl
I'm up all night like a white owl, white owl, white owl
Iced out like a white owl, white owl, white owl
And I'm talkin' 'bout it right now, right now, right now
Bitch I gotta do it right now, right now, right now
I been goin' up right now, right now, right now
Matter fact with a white owl, white owl, white owl
White owl, white owl, white owl
White owl, white owl, white owl
Goin' up right now, right now, right now

[Verse 2: Ketchy the Great]
Yeah, ayy, bitch I'm higher than a lighthouse
Fly and I come alive at night, stalk the rat like a white owl
Throw a bitch back, ooh, ayy, get her with the white out
San Franscisco cookies, boy I smoke it, makin' dope
Pinky rink up on 'em, drippin' on your bitch, she might sink
And my ear still wet somebody grab me a towel
I'm all on a towel, xanny, bitch I'm geekin', I snapped out
And I'm always off the juice, but I never pass out
And I'd rather roll a wop with big poy than a white out
And my white girl want the white girl like right now
Gucci sweater, got a hole in it 'cause the ass fell out
Gucci never give no damn, I'm still gon' fuck 'em in the mouth
Bitches on my dick, they just want nut from me just for the clout
I'm too high up in the sky, I be climbin' up a mountain, ooh
I been sippin' lean, I'm drowsy, I'm drowsy, ayy
And your bitch just want to go down on me, wait
High, like a white owl in the sky
