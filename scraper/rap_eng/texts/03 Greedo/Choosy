[Chorus: Chris O'Bannon]
Said she ain't a groupie, then tell me why that bitch is so choosy
Askin' if it's Gucci, if we ride drop top in my hoopty
And I'ma say that we can do it
Don't hate on me 'cause your bitch choosin'
I'ma say that we can do it
Don't hate on me 'cause your bitch choosin'

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
It's all by choice, not forced
Wanna roll with me, my boys
Told her strap up, and ride horse
Hush hush shush, don't make noise, ayy
I let her hit the doobie, 'cause she didn't put in on these cookies
Sorry if I sound moody, but I just want head and some pussy
Married to the game, I am tooken
F&N make a pussy nigga start bookin'
And if you hookin', be on dog and not tooken
Bitch don't choose me, overlook me
Millionaire gangster like Messi in his prime
I told her I was coming and I nutted in her eye
But is you still down for the motherfuckin' cause?
You gon' say the dope yours when the boys bring the dogs
It's Chang Chang

[Chorus: Chris O'Bannon]
Said she ain't a groupie, then tell me why that bitch is so choosy
Askin' if it's Gucci, if we ride drop top in my hoopty
And I'ma say that we can do it
Don't hate on me 'cause your bitch choosin'
I'ma say that we can do it
Don't hate on me 'cause your bitch choosin'

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Say she ain't a groupie, all off the pills, no roofy
Make project music like Juvie
And you know I treat the pussy like sushi, only eat it with my cutie
Give me brain like my tutor, professor, I came with my ruler
Bitch free my Drakeo, every time I catch a gun case
More mad that they take the chrome
I fell in love, ain't no hotties that I'ma take home, after my shows
I needed trust, not these hoes, I only trust in my bros
Can't answer if your number ain't in my phone
Pull up, I'm fake ain't at home
Pull up, I'm fake ain't at home
Lookin' through the peephole
Just might shoot you in the dome
If you niggas lookin' wrong
Blowin' like we Cheech and Chong

[Chorus: Chris O'Bannon]
Said she ain't a groupie, then tell me why that bitch is so choosy
Askin' if it's Gucci, if we ride drop top in my hoopty
And I'ma say that we can do it
Don't hate on me 'cause your bitch choosin'
I'ma say that we can do it
Don't hate on me 'cause your bitch choosin'

[Verse 3: ALLBLACK]
ALLBLACK a real sixteen, on Demont they respected my pimpin'
ALLBLACK copped them luccis, 304's, ain't 'bout the square shit or simpin'
I remember when that punk bitch turned back on me
Called me broke, put me on IG, flushed racks on me
One of my main shooters got broke, he might've clapped at me
Bills piled up, no toys down, it was bad for a P
Bitch I'm up now, what's up now, can't tell I took an L
Chinese change on no shirt, that fat nigga D-12
Niggas hate when I come around, I make 'em nervous, I can tell
Talkin' too much, grippin' they pockets, sweatin' and shit, bitin' they nails
This Kel-Tec got a hockey stick
Ain't gon' sock a bitch, I'll pop a bitch
My mama said that's a damn shame how high I get
On Jehovah I run fades, LA County shit

[Chorus: Chris O'Bannon]
Said she ain't a groupie, then tell me why that bitch is so choosy
Askin' if it's Gucci, if we ride drop top in my hoopty
And I'ma say that we can do it
Don't hate on me 'cause your bitch choosin'
I'ma say that we can do it
Don't hate on me 'cause your bitch choosin'
