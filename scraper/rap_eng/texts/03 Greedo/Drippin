[Intro]
How does it feel to be me?
Wolf, yeah, yeah yeah, ayy, yeah yeah
Beat Boy taught me

[Pre-Chorus]
How does it feel to be me?
How does it feel to be somethin' that came from the streets?
Really was sellin' them keys, this is the way that we eat, 03
Ecstasy, percocet, kush and the powder
Geekin', it really don't matter
I just came down [?] fightin' a lot, this is what made me a savage

[Chorus]
I, been, drippin', inside, kitchen
I, been, drippin', inside, kitchen
I been drippin', ooh, I been drippin', ooh
Inside the kitchen, whoa
I been drippin', I been drippin', baby 03

[Verse]
This the way the wolf sound when he off an ecstasy
I need all my kush loud, baby please don't message me
Send the package like a G-mail, made a couple G's
I just left the section, rappers' daughters want to mess with me
She want to have sex with me, Greedy so my baddie sweet
All my bitches street, she need a nigga with some felonies
Hater never met me, it ain't nothin' that they tellin' me
I was in the mansion lookin' handsome watchin' Ellen D
Generous, but I never give her shit, I don't ever give her shit
Lil DK made me militant, gotta keep quiet when you killin' shit
03, text me, I'm feelin' it
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
How does it feel to be me?
How does it feel to be somethin' that come from the streets?
Really was sellin' them keys, this is the way that we eat, 03
Ecstasy, percocet, kush and the powder, baby it really don't matter
Geekin', it really don't matter, geekin', it really don't matter

[Outro]
Call me Greedy, eat it off a platter, ah
Skinny nigga but my pockets fatter, ah, ah
Say hi 'til I'm done, say and I'm done
How does it feel to be me? how does it feel to be me?
Only one 03, only one 03, how does it feel to be me?
Ooh, I was in jail now I'm free
Freestylin', he's violent, he's talented
How does it feel to be me?
