[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Drummer Gang, East Atlanta
East Atlanta, Drummer Gang, whoa

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Drummer Gang got the bass like Young L
East Atlanta flip weight like dumbbells
Did the W, bitch that's two L's
Wanna shine with me, bitch I ain't Juel
Ayy, I don't mean no disrespect, ooh, ooh
Drippin' like the Dipset, ayy, ayy, ooh
I don't mean no disrespect, ayy
All my niggas drippin' like the Dipset, ooh

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Get the bag, I just get the bag
Get the bag baby, Drummer get the bag, ooh
Get the money, we ain't lookin' up the tag
I don't do the lowrider, car jackin'
Goddamn, I'm pullin' up saggin'
I ain't talkin' 'bout my pants, it's the wagon
Goddamn, I'ma pull up in the foreign
Sippin' lean, now a nigga started snoring
Like the three little bears, I need porridge
Hibernate with a pair of some foregins
Yeah that bitch pussy good but she poison
BBD, go BD, paid in full bitch, ayy
Think I'm Rico, think I'm Ace too
Think I'm Money Mitch, bitch I think I'm Money Mitch
Young L shit, 03 gettin' rich
ManMan, he a motherfuckin' savage

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Drummer Gang got the bass like Young L
East Atlanta flip weight like dumbbells
Did the W, bitch that's two L's
Wanna shine with me, bitch I ain't Juel
Ayy, I don't mean no disrespect, ooh, ooh
Drippin' like the Dipset, ayy, ayy, ooh
I don't mean no disrespect, ayy
All my niggas drippin' like the Dipset, ooh

[Verse 2: ManMan Savage]
Try to take from me and Greedo, catch a 2L
I just went and draped my bitch down up in Chanel
Fucked that nigga's bitch but keep that on the DL
This a new whip off the lot, this ain't no resale
We got J's in the trap just like Ezell
Caught you slippin', I can tell you a shell
Just like Screech, you was saved by the bell
All this drip bitch, yeah I got sauce for sale

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Drummer Gang got the bass like Young L
East Atlanta flip weight like dumbbells
Did the W, bitch that's two L's
Wanna shine with me, bitch I ain't Juel
Ayy, I don't mean no disrespect, ooh, ooh
Drippin' like the Dipset, ayy, ayy, ooh
I don't mean no disrespect, ayy
All my niggas drippin' like the Dipset, ooh
