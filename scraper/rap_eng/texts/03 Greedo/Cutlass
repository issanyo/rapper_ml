[Intro]
X load it up bro
Back to it, we went back to the future
X on the beat, make it boom

[Chorus]
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the, woo, back to the bucket
Back to the, ayy, back to the bucket
Back to the, yeah, back to the Cutlass
Back to the, damn, back to the Cutlass

[Verse 1]
I remember I was strugglin'
Woke up and I started hustling
And I had to get that muscle
Flexin', leave these peoples puzzled
Chopper, no we ain't gon' touch him
Green was sproutin' up, no brussel
Orange hairs like I'm fucking Chucky
White girls like I'm fucking Jason
Live my dream just like I'm Freddy
Got the bodies in the basement
Dead bodies, dead bodies, talkin' presidents
Everybody know I'll get you out of here, no evidence
Ayy ayy, ayy, pull up at your residence
Ayy, ayy, niggas gon' be heaven sent
Go to jail only way we go to hell
All these niggas actin' frail, I put packages in mail, boy
Ayy, like the paper boy

[Chorus]
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the, woo, back to the bucket
Back to the, ayy, back to the bucket
Back to the, yeah, back to the Cutlass
Back to the, damn, back to the Cutlass

[Verse 2]
Back to the business, back to the bitches
Back to the riches, Bally Total Fitness, put weight on my bitches
Like a trainer, I'm a gang banger, not an entertainer
But I'm famous, bought a banger 'fore I ever let my chain swang 'em
Smoke another zone, bitch we Cheech and Chong
Ridin' with my niggas whether right or wrong, ayy, ayy
Most of these rappers'll write a statement 'fore they write a song
In my trap I'm doin' numbers like Celine Dion
Put that Tech inside my beverage just to calm me down
You want static, it get hectic, then you not around
Bitch you gotta be protected in the Jordan Downs
Bitch you gotta be protected in the Jordan Downs

[Chorus]
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the bucket, ballin' on a budget, I was hustlin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the Cutlass, couldn't trust me, baby I was druggin'
Back to the, woo, back to the bucket
Back to the, ayy, back to the bucket
Back to the, yeah, back to the Cutlass
Back to the, damn, back to the Cutlass

[Outro]
Ooh, take 'em back to that Cutlass, ooh, ayy
Take 'em back to that Cutlass, ooh, ooh
Take 'em back to when I was strugglin', ooh
Take 'em back to when I was hustlin'
Back to that, back, back, back, back back
Back to that, back, back back, back, back back
Ooh, damn, Drummer Gang, we gon'
Ayy, ayy, ayy ayy, ayy ayy, ooh
