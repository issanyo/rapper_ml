[Intro]
Feel like I'm walkin' on air, yeah
Feel like I'm walkin' on water

[Chorus]
Floating, I can touch the sky, I'm high enough
Chopper right behind us, load it up
Watch your spirit rise in front of us
Just 'cause you thought y'all could call my bluff
Walkin' on air, walkin' on water
Walkin' on air, floatin' (walkin' on air)
Feels like I'm walkin' on air, floatin' (like I'm walkin' on water)
Like I'm walkin' on water, floatin'
Yeah, she let me dive in her ocean

[Verse 1]
I dive inside her ocean
When I'm high I'm feeling like I'm floating
Pour the line and another line, pour the potion
Put a deuce in a lemon lime, now I'm floating (floating)
Every time I dive inside her ocean (inside her ocean)
Every time I'm high I feel like I'm floating (feel like I'm floating), 03
Beat up that pussy, I turn to a savage
Fuck on that pussy, look just like an actress
Work and the gun just right under the mattress
I feel like I'm floating on top the magic
Deep inside her ocean, I'm ridin' the wave
Ridin' the wave

[Chorus]
Floating, I can touch the sky, I'm high enough
Chopper right behind us, load it up
Watch your spirit rise in front of us
Just 'cause you thought y'all could call my bluff
Walkin' on air, walkin' on water
Walkin' on air, floatin' (walkin' on air)
Feels like I'm walkin' on air, floatin' (like I'm walkin' on water)
Like I'm walkin' on water, floatin'
Yeah, she let me dive in her ocean

[Verse 2]
Niggas swiping baby mamas, that ain't beef niggas
Where I'm from we keep the drama in the streets nigga
Yeah you know I got the chopper in the seat nigga
And it came with a beam nigga
Drummer Gang, got a hundred in this thing nigga
We'll put your ass to sleep nigga
Pullin' up to creep music when we creep nigga
No doors on the Jeep nigga

[Chorus]
Floating, I can touch the sky, I'm high enough
Chopper right behind us, load it up
Watch your spirit rise in front of us
Just 'cause you thought y'all could call my bluff
Walkin' on air, walkin' on water
Walkin' on air, floatin' (why these niggas steady beefin' over hoes)
Feels like I'm walkin' on air, floatin' (feels like you walkin' on air)
Like I'm walkin' on water, floatin' (chopper make a pussy nigga)
Yeah, she let me dive in her ocean

[Outro]
Fill you up with holes, chopper make a pussy nigga pose
Keep another ho
Man I'm walkin' on water
Still fuckin' on your mother and your daughter
I'm fuckin' niggas' baby mamas, yeah
I leave you walkin' on air, like I'm walkin' on water
When I'm deep in her ocean, I feel just like I told you, oh
