[Intro]
Zuned in and I'm, yeah, oh, yeah
Zuned in and I'm zoning (in my zone, in my zone)
Zone

[Chorus]
Zuned in and I'm zoning
Bitch, you know I'm staying focused
Bitch, you know I'm baby loc'ing
So we gon' keep that shit in motion
Zuned in and I'm zoning
Bitch, you know I'm staying focused
Bitch, you know I'm baby loc'ing
So we gon' keep that shit in motion

[Verse]
Zuned in and I'm zoning
Tell my nigga pour the potion (tell my niggas pour the lean)
All my niggas baby loc'ing (all my niggas they got weed)
All my niggas stayin' foxsued (all my niggas makin' G's)
Oh, oh, all my niggas makin' G's, all my niggas makin' G's
All my niggas chasin' cheese
All my bitches, they some freaks
All my bitches, they be eatin'
Duckin' like I keep the street
Shout out my boy Ketchy
All my bitches gettin' sexy
And both my boys be pimpin'
I mean, all my boys they keep pimpin'
All my hoes is more than jewels
Designer on my fuckin' shoes
VVS on my fuckin' jewels
Gettin' rich like them fuckin' Jews
If you pussy, I am not amused

[Chorus]
Zuned in and I'm zoning
Bitch, you know I'm staying focused
Bitch, you know I'm baby loc'ing
So we gon' keep that shit in motion
Zuned in and I'm zoning
Bitch, you know I'm staying focused
Bitch, you know I'm baby loc'ing
So we gon' keep that shit in motion

[Outro]
Bitch, you know I'm baby loc'ing
Zuned in on that ass, hell yeah
Beat it up, I'ma spazz, hell yeah
Ask lil mama if it's good, hell yeah
Geeked is how we are, don't do it, hell yeah
