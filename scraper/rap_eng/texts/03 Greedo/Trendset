[Chorus]
I been waitin' on this moment
And I been waitin' for the longest
I remember I was homeless
Now I'm just the first to do this out the homies
I been waitin' on this moment
And I been waitin' for the longest
I remember I was homeless
Now I'm just the first to do this out the homies
Trendset, trendset
Drummer Gang lookin' just like DipSet
Trendset, trendset
Drummer Gang lookin' just like DipSet

[Verse]
Feelin' like Killer Cam
Drinkin', feelin' like Jimmy
Feelin' like Un Kasa
I ain't from a public city
All they wanted you at
Can't be in no lie
I make ya feel
I feel like dime
What the turn out
You done changed on me
Vacuum seal well
Like Bigs and J
Beef I gotta say
Like one for you anyway
Remember I was in this place
Got 'em thuggin' on the case
Treat a black boy right
Like an RB ray
Never been to the race
I be aimin' at your brains
I ain't fuckin' with the vein
I just do it for the change
I just do it for the gang
No time to wait, no time to wait
No time to wait, no time to wait

[Chorus]
I been waitin' on this moment
And I been waitin' for the longest
I remember I was homeless
Now I'm just the first to do this out the homies
I been waitin' on this moment
And I been waitin' for the longest
I remember I was homeless
Now I'm just the first to do this out the homies
Trendset, trendset
Drummer Gang lookin' just like DipSet
Trendset, trendset
Drummer Gang lookin' just like DipSet
