[Chorus]
You don't want no static, make it rain, we leave you shellshocked
Thunderstorm diamonds look like water in the wristwatch
You don't want no static, make it rain, we leave you shellshocked
You don't want no static, you don't want no static
Fuck around, that shit get tragic
Nigga you don't want no static, you don't want no static
Tell me what's your status man

[Post-Chorus]
Hatin' ass bitch, you know we ain't nothing average
Long live Money, I be on my counting cash shit
Chauffeur is a bad bitch, I'm trapping out in traffic
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, bitch that's never had it, goddamn

[Verse 1]
Call log, when she call off, bitch what happened?
When she callin', bet she fallin', ain't no cappin', ayy ayy
But she get it by the boatload
She just let me be the captain, ayy ayy ayy
I'm her favorite nigga rappin'
You know I ain't cappin' (talkin' 'bout the bad bitch)
In the streets I'm a legend (ayy ayy)
And she know what I'm whippin' (ayy ayy, yeah)
All my haters be blessin', Haitians in Texas
Yeah yeah, ain't no hate on a legend

[Chorus]
You don't want no static, make it rain, we leave you shellshocked
Thunderstorm diamonds look like water in the wristwatch
You don't want no static, make it rain, we leave you shellshocked
You don't want no static, you don't want no static
Fuck around, that shit get tragic
Nigga you don't want no static, you don't want no static
Tell me what's your status man

[Post-Chorus]
Hatin' ass bitch, you know we ain't nothing average
Long live Money, I be on my counting cash shit
Chauffeur is a bad bitch, I'm trapping out in traffic
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, bitch that's never had it, goddamn

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was runnin' out of time
Baby I said I was fine and lied
Maybe I was runnin' out of time
I can see the envy in your eyes

[Chorus]
You don't want no static, make it rain, we leave you shellshocked
Thunderstorm diamonds look like water in the wristwatch
You don't want no static, make it rain, we leave you shellshocked
You don't want no static, you don't want no static
Fuck around, that shit get tragic
Nigga you don't want no static, you don't want no static
Tell me what's your status man

[Post-Chorus]
Hatin' ass bitch, you know we ain't nothing average
Long live Money, I be on my counting cash shit
Chauffeur is a bad bitch, I'm trapping out in traffic
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, bitch that's never had it, goddamn
