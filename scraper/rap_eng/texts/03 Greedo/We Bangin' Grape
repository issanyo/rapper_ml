[Intro: 03 Greedo & Lil One Hunnet]
Yeah, Lil One, 03
I'll wrap a nigga, clap a nigga, sorry for the wait
BlocBoy JB
I'll show up at your wake and throw a party with the K (yeah)
It ain't my birthday but I'm partyin' with cake (ayy)
Get rich and people envy, they sorry, on Grape (yeah)

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Ayy, we bangin' Grape (crip)
Hunnet shoot shots at your face (rrah)
You diss the gang and it's First 48 (word)
Think you Osama, put you in a lake (the lake)
Your bitch on her knees like she pray (she slurpin')
You fuck with me then you late (you late)
Cool, I was in the school with a tool (the tool)
Remember when I pour a first move (move)

[Verse 1: BlocBoy JB]
First gun was a twenty-two (rrah)
Headshot a nigga, put a nigga on the news (the news)
I stomp a nigga in new Gucci shoes
I rob a nigga and take all his jewels (his jewels)
Eat up his mouth like food (food)
You know I want the car just like a Jew (yeah)
I left the Stinc and the Glock didn't shoot
Man these niggas put me up in that move
I'ma pull up with that sawed off (sawed off)
Man you a pussy, knock your balls off (rrah)
Say my boy and he ain't have a stick, he's a knockoff (knockoff)
All y'all niggas fuckin' call the bully, it's a mall soft (mall soft)
These niggas they think that I'm a rookie, I won't fall off (no)

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Ayy, we bangin' Grape (crip)
Hunnet shoot shots at your face (rrah)
You diss the gang and it's First 48 (word)

Your bitch on her knees like she pray (she slurpin')
You fuck with me then you late (you late)
Cool, I was in the school with a tool (the tool)

[Verse 2: Lil One Hunnet & 03 Greedo]
I mix Kool-Aid with my pickle juice (ayy)
My diamonds sting just like Pikachu
I'm in that cat playin' peekaboo (yeah)
I pissed that rack just like Jigga do
I'm in the Maybach at sixty-two
I got my seat back, I'm sippin' juice (yeah)
I kick my feet up and drip Ragu
Kick rocks, yabba dabba doo
When I first jumped off the stoop
I had a deuce deuce in my boot
You got a question for who?
BlocBoy, know I shoot (shoot)
I got on Canada Goose (goose)
Bitch fresh, came out of the zoo (zoo)
I got a pint of that juice (juice)
I'm 'bout to pour me up two (Lil One Hunnet)

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Ayy, we bangin' Grape (crip)
Hunnet shoot shots at your face (rrah)
You diss the gang and it's First 48 (word)

Your bitch on her knees like she pray (she slurpin')
You fuck with me then you late (you late)
Cool, I was in the school with a tool (the tool)
Remember when I pour a first move (move)

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
We bangin' Baby Loc, we bangin' Peter Roll
Bitch I'm a wolf, you a motherfuckin' antelope
Watch the lil chopper hit you in the cantaloupe
Niggas don't know that we got all the antidotes
We got the drugs, we with the thugs
Ridin' with Bloc and we know we the plug
Drummer Gang, we gon' hit you with slugs
Kanye how my shoulder gon' shrug
Lil One Hunnet, 03 motherfucker
My brother a gangster, you know I'm a hustler
You know we gon' plug you, we came from the gutter
We know we the Peter Roll but we gon' dust you, ooh
Watch your body hit the floor, you ain't really want the smoke
Now it's clouds around your throat, should've been from Baby Loc
Should've been from Baby Loc

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Ayy, we bangin' Grape (crip)
Hunnet shoot shots at your face (rrah)
You diss the gang and it's First 48 (word)
Think you Osama, put you in a lake (the lake)
Your bitch on her knees like she pray (she slurpin')
You fuck with me then you late (you late)
Cool, I was in the school with a tool (the tool)
Remember when I pour a first move (move)
