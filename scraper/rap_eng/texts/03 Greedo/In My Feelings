[Intro]
Every time I get a hold of you
Whoa Kenny

[Chorus]
In my feelings, mmh
Every time I get a hold of you
Feet touchin' the ceiling
Told you I would get close to you, yeah, yeah
In my feelings
Every time I get a hold of you, yeah
Feet touchin' the ceiling
Told you I would get close to you, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Look what you think made me want link
We'll have some drinks and we can, yeah
We can get freaky, I'm just thinkin'
I was speakin' again, ayy
She fuck me through the weekend, and I ain't talkin' the singer
She wanna fuck me to SZA, I wanna cut her like scissors, yeah
I fuck her every time I take her to dinner
She look like something you can eat
You want to fuck me, better hear please
Wanna fuck her every week
I might get caught up in my sleep

[Chorus]
In my feelings, mmh
Every time I get a hold of you
Feet touchin' the ceiling
Told you I would get close to you, yeah, yeah
In my feelings
Every time I get a hold of you, yeah
Feet touchin' the ceiling
Told you I would get close to you, yeah, yeah
