[Intro]
I'm like paranoid
Know what I'm sayin', street niggas be like, we don't go to fuckin' church
Playmakers
Unless I'm going to a funeral, know what I'm sayin'
Ain't nobody get married where I'm from, know what I'm sayin'
When it be crazy I still call on her, you dig
Run that back Turbo

[Chorus]
Praying to God, caught a lil faith a long time ago
When it get hard, he's just the one that I'm callin' on
Praying to God, yeah
Praying to God

[Verse 1]
Got on my knees and prayed, tryna delete the hate
I cannot hesitate, I gotta navigate
I know agitate, I know I aggravate
I had to levitate, then they would gravitate
Ask my bitch 'cause she bring me my preference
I get high 'cause I'm needing my blessings
Have you ever been in the streets, lost your best friend?
Have you ever bought your weed from the Mexicans?
I really ran in the plugs
I'm really runnin' up drugs
Road runner, run it up
Pray to God, I need love

[Pre-Chorus]
Prayin' to God, prayin' to God
Prayin' to God, prayin' to God
Hopin' that I deceived your eye
Prayin' to God

[Chorus]
Praying to God, caught a lil faith a long time ago
When it get hard, he's just the one that I'm callin' on
Praying to God, yeah
Praying to God
Praying to God, caught a lil faith a long time ago
When it get hard, he's just the one that I'm callin' on
Praying to God, yeah
Praying to God

[Verse 2]
In church but I'm geekin', more cash than a deacon
I'm fightin' my demons, these niggas is leeches
These niggas be thiefin', watch out for they greetin'
These bitches be griefin', they niggas be leavin'
You know they ain't break up, ain't nothin' I can make up
Everybody been through shake-ups, go to prison when you wake up
He was just sleep on his feet, he was just sleep on the streets
Pull up with the street sweep
These niggas preyin' on me
These niggas hatin' on me
They tryna crucify me
They must not know who I be
I walk on water like Jesus
I fuck around, brought the C
Life is Montana and me
Niggas'll never be me

[Chorus]
Praying to God, caught a lil faith a long time ago
When it get hard, he's just the one that I'm callin' on
Praying to God, yeah
Praying to God
Praying to God, caught a lil faith a long time ago
When it get hard, he's just the one that I'm callin' on
Praying to God, yeah
Praying to God

[Outro]
I feel like I'm on God Level
Lately I been high as ever
I feel like I'm on God Level
Lately I been so high off whatever
I don't think I feel my heartbeat
I just know I just was starving
Can you go hard baby, hardly
Ain't have a heart in me
