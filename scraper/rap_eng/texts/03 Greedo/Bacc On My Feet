[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Like Prospect
I'm in the club doin' the same... 03
Same old two step

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
She ain't scared to come to the gutter
She pull up just like she should
She don't let me leave without money
She dump the guts out my wood
She put that lean in my beverage
When she load my heat she look sexy
Put me back on my feet when I stepped in
That's why I treat her so good
Put me back on my feet when I stepped in
That's why I treat her so good

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
First off I got it lit like Prospect
I'm in the club doin' the same old two step
Living legends, all the lost ones I respect
Drakeo make a sneak diss and hit the reject
Hands up, this ain't no nae nae, we gon' hit them folks
In East Atlanta really whippin' with the kitchen fork
Bitch ride with me, my bitch ride for me
My bitch lie for me and my bitch ride on me
Even though I'm from South California
Took her down on the south side of Florida
On the run, she let me dog all 'til the morning
I can't show up to no girl without a Laurie

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & Dubba-AA]
She ain't scared to come to the gutter
She pull up just like she should
She don't let me leave without money
She dump the guts out my wood
She put that lean in my beverage
When she load my heat she look sexy
Put me back on my feet when I stepped in
That's why I treat her so good
La la la la, la la la
Put me back on my feet when I stepped in
La la la la, la la la
That's why I treat her so good

[Verse 2: Dubba-AA]
Yeah I love all of my bitches
They treat me just like they should
Cannot fuck with no bitch if she bougie
That's 'cause I'm straight from the hood
Young nigga, need a Beyonce
She super bad, and do what I say
Keep the money comin' in like every day
From MIA to the West like Kim K
I don't really like to move, really like to dance
'Cause I got the tool off in my pants
Baby is you gon' ride for me?
If it go down is you gon' slide for me?

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
She ain't scared to come to the gutter
She pull up just like she should
She don't let me leave without money
She dump the guts out my wood
She put that lean in my beverage
When she load my heat she look sexy
Put me back on my feet when I stepped in
That's why I treat her so good
Put me back on my feet when I stepped in
That's why I treat her so good
