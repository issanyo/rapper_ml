[Intro]
Yeah, woah, yeah
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
Woah

[Chorus]
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
Make it look good (make it look good)
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
Make it look good (make it look good)
I don't just trick on just anybody
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
Make it look good, make it look good

[Verse]
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
Make it look good for a couple hundred
Make it look good for a couple homies
Make it look good for a couple moments
Make it look good and I'm in my zone
I love the way that you fuckin', I ain't never fucked
I can tell by the way that you done what you done
You can do what I want, bitch I love when you stunt
Keep on grindin' it up, ooh
She say I'm making this shit look so easy as fuck
Selfish like PnB, beatin' it up
These niggas bitches, ain't decent enough
Ain't no need to discuss, you been sleepin' with us
I pour the lean in her cup

[Chorus]
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
Make it look good (make it look good)
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
Make it look good (make it look good)
I don't just trick on just anybody
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
I don't just trick on just anybody
Show me some ways you can make some money
Make it look good, make it look good
