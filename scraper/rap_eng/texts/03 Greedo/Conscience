[Intro]
I'ma be your conscience
I'ma be your conscience
I ain't bein' too conscious
Whoa Kenny

[Chorus]
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
That's me, that's me
That's me, that's me
I could be your conscience, I'ma be your conscience
I could be your conscience, I could be your conscience
I'ma be your conscience, I'ma be your conscience
I could be your conscience
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch, I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch, I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
I'ma be your conscience

[Verse]
I'm that purple devil on your left shoulder
In some Raf Simons screaming hit the yola
I would do anything to fulfill my dreams
But I'm sippin' lean if a nigga blow it
Smoking city weed, I'm in California
Got a Texas lawyer taking Texas cases
Wanna be my homie, you gon' have to take it
'Cause I'm paper chasin' and these peoples racist
My lil brother Paul on your other shoulder
On the same shit, but he's still an angel
Tryna work my move, you gotta see my angle
Like my hands out, 2 L's in front
Like you get the picture and you're tryna frame it
Mind on drugs, I've been tryna change it
Gotta sacrifice when you're gangbanging
Fuck the interstate and that's an understatement
I was out of state for the entertainment
Dancing on a girl you remind me of
Like I'm Usher Raymond, tryna knock the vacant
Granddaddy house, I was in the basement
In the S-E-L, playing with the bangers
If you're in this world you should do the same
It's the only reason I done became famous
Gotta be a gangster, gotta keep it player
Never one way, gotta keep some layers
Stack Monday, gotta clean the paper
Lil Money laying, gotta peek and prayin'
Lost him in the Beamer, drove my peoples crazy
Been through situations that'll keep you mainy
Fuck a pussy nigga, I can't see too many
I can't do the Xanax, drive my people zany
Need a new Mercedes, pull up in the Maybies

[Chorus]
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
That's me, that's me
That's me, that's me
I could be your conscience, I'ma be your conscience
I could be your conscience, I could be your conscience
I'ma be your conscience, I'ma be your conscience
I could be your conscience
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch, I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
I know a lame when I see it
Bitch, I know hate when I hear it
I take a few drugs when I need it
So hard to look in the mirror
I'ma be your conscience
