[Intro]
03
If I wasn't rappin' baby
If I wasn't rappin' baby, wasn't rappin' baby
If I wasn't rappin' baby
If I wasn't rappin' baby

[Chorus]
If I wasn't rappin' baby
You know I'd be trappin' daily
Shippin' shit, I'm wrappin' babies
She say I be actin' shady
Wake up and I'm after payments
Bitch, I'm tryna grab Mercedes

[Verse]
And I'm playin' them naked ladies
Save the cash and never save 'em
If I wasn't rappin' baby
I'd be back stuck on the pavement
If I wasn't rappin' baby
I'd've never left the station
If I wasn't rappin' baby
I'd still be on that vacation
If I wasn't rappin' baby
I'd never be here to taste ya
That's the part that drive you crazy
'Member when I caught them cases
You thought they would take you, Jason
Thank the Lord I wasn't patient
I did it without the stations
Took a loss and rearranged it
Took a charge and didn't say shit
Sweet lady, need a replacement
You feel good, get left for ravin'
Fly bitch from where I be bangin'
[?] in my fuckin' favor
Bitch, I'm from another planet
Where we speak a different language
Fuck the jury and the plaintiff
Word to Chase, he fuckin' saved me
Reason why I got the [?]
Now I'm here to bring the plaques
Hottest shit since Michael Jackson
Janet Jackson, satisfaction
Love my sisters on some black shit
White girl in my fuckin' baggage
White girl made me fuckin' happy
Fuck the bounty, I'm just laughin'
'Cause you drove out here to grab me
I got out soon as I landed
Waited longer on the package
Now they know I'm really trappin'
And I still don't know what happened
Realest nigga in first class
The realest statement in your caption
"#Free03, my favourite rapper"

[Break]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
If I wasn't rappin' baby
03
Yeah, yeah
If I wasn't rappin' baby

[Chorus]
If I wasn't rappin', baby
You know I'd be trappin' daily
Shippin' shit, I'm wrappin' babies
She say I be actin' shady
Wake up and I'm after payments
Bitch, I'm tryna grab Mercedes
If I wasn't rappin', baby
You know I'd be trappin' daily
Shippin' shit, I'm wrappin' babies
She say I be actin' shady
Wake up and I'm after payments
Bitch, I'm tryna grab Mercedes

[Outro]
And I'm playin' them naked ladies
Save the cash and never save 'em
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I'd be back stuck on the pavement
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I'd've never left the station
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I'd still be on that vacation
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I'd never be here to taste ya
That's the part that drive you crazy
'Member when I caught them cases
You thought they would take you, Jason
Thank the Lord I wasn't patient
I did it without the stations
Took a loss and rearranged it
