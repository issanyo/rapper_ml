[Intro]
03, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I been sleeping with your girlfriend, same time you're doing time
I been on the other end, I had to change my life
Run for my life, run for your life
Run it up with your wife, might fuck tonight
Can't trust that bitch, so don't trust that bitch
Can't trust that bitch, nigga don't trust that bitch

[Verse 1]
I don't usually fuck these niggas' bitches, I'm a player
But this hottie way too thick and her lil man a hater
Just for these hoes these niggas risk they life to get the paper
Just for the dough, I think I need a Lincoln Navigator
Take them back to bald fades with the activator
It's been some time since I had some shine
But I been back on my grind and she been back on my mind
Just like a distant reminder in the back of her mind
I put that arch in her spine, now I got her shaking
Body language, bold statement, capping is my occupation conversation rule the nation, talk her out her pink sweatsuit
So fast, she make Amber Rose look like she got no ass

[Chorus]
I been sleeping with your girlfriend, same time you're doing time
I been on the other end, I had to change my life
Run for my life, run for your life
Run it up with your wife, might fuck tonight

[Verse 2]
Everytime you make a run for your bitch
I pull up and make her run from that dick
Run it up when she finds all my strips
We don't run all our lips, go'n and run for some shit
I can't give up locations, no information
You know we don't say shit 'cause we fighting cases for real
Fuck it got saved by a deal, you never felt how it feels
Your money counterfeit, my money real
You might go down and it's all up from here
I was depressed off them drugs and realized I'm the plug
I got blinded by love and that shit fucked me up
And that's all that I fear, all that I fear
Bitch it's my year, bitch it's my year
Love is all that I fear

[Chorus]
I been sleeping with your girlfriend, same time you're doing time
I been on the other end, I had to change my life
Run for my life, run for your life
Run it up with your wife, might fuck tonight
