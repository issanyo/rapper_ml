[Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to be stressin'
But my life be so hectic
I can't go nowhere without my own protection
These niggas think I need a shooter, boy, forget it
Ain't nobody shoot when I was jugglin' them crutches
They say I'm a ho 'cause they ain't coming to my function
Everybody talking, nobody be doing nothing
Every nigga 'round me, I can't really trust 'em
Rollin' up a [?] of some musty
I don't have time for a discussion
Drummer Gang beat it up, percussion
On Money, came into this rap game with my own money

[Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds

[Verse 2]
Tryna tell me what to do made me not fuck with you
You ain't never made the news, you really just confused
Fuck your opinion, LA Weekly think that I'm that dude
That explains your attitude
Niggas talk shit, then complain that I respond and don't stop it
Working out has never been an option
I'ma still talk shit, this ain't no act
I can't hit your double cup 'cause this ain't no Act
This ain't revolvers, these is some TECs
I don't trust this nigga, I just seen who he texts
Make a pussy nigga go and lean like some Tech
Used to snort cocaine, now I fiend for the check
Yeah
Ooh
Ooh
I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds
