[Intro: Key!]
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Eww, yuck
Eww

[Verse 1: Key!]
Ayy, don't touch that, whoa, two-two-three kick
Back, ayy, drum set rat
Sell it low, where the motherfuckin' gnat, ayy
Moncler, let's be clear
I got hands like a fuckin' engineer
Give me head while a nigga tryna steer
Nigga burp like a motherfuckin' bear, ayy
You from the bottom, how your ass get here?
Cut a broke nigga off like near, ayy
Shed weight, sub weight, kick her out, fix your face
Four-five make you get in shape, four-five hard to ventilate
They might find your body lake, old money, Ricki Lake

[Chorus: Key!]
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going
Suck it, keep going

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Chasing the dividends, I'm getting chickens in
Keys to the Ben-en-enz, glad my job came with the benefits
I caught a case with the evidence
Money to lawyers made it disappear again
Met with Maria, she shook like Shakira did
Daddy the plug, only colors I see are blue benjamins
Purple diamonds in my overbite
Got me chewin' hard to eat steak and fries
On 285, got a doggy bag, sold dog food like Purina did
Brick after brick after brick after brick after brick after brick like a pyramid
Body got hieroglyphics like Egyptian
I don't what race I'm is, it's a mixture
My mama almost had me in the kitchen
I really grew up gettin' all the whippin'
I was a BeBe's kid how I'm baby loc crippin'
Purple hoodie, black hat on the mission
First day of school I dropped out of nutrition
I had to eat 'fore my daughter was Christian
I had a baby in high school
Fucked with lil baby, you know I was pitchin'
Baby mama mama taught me Spanish when ditching
I went to school with them white dudes

[Chorus: Key!]
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going
Money keep going
Suck it, keep going
Suck it, keep going
