Hurry up, send me the zip, I got a package to ship, ayy, ayy
I'm really sellin' cocaine, you never been on a plane
Trap out your government name, you better stay in your lane, we know you niggas is lame
I am a lion untamed, bitch I'm a wolf, smokin' on cookies
And I'm a crip like I'm Tookie, 'member that time that they took me
Screamin' out long live Lil Money, boy used to cook with no book, I'm in the kitchen

[Verse 2]
Always bail out the cell, you never been to the pen
I know you ready to tell, get your lil paper and pen
You gon' sit in that room, you gonna tell all your friends
Nigga don't try to pretend
I would just pull up in Benz, I'ma just pull up in Beamer, I'ma just pull up in van
Moved out the hood 'cause I'm rich, no I don't need me no tint, I'ma just pull up with ooh
Ah, gift that go right out that stash
Lift that shit up, let it spit, lift that shit up, let it spit, lift that shit up, let it spit
I got these chickens in here, I got three niggas in here
I got two shooters with me
I'ma really sellin' the keys, I'm really sellin' the trees
Get your money, get your money, get your bread
Fuck around, I'ma aim for your head
Get your money, get your money, get your bread
You fuckin' with me, I'll be aimin' at your head
I'ma shoot up your home like I'm aimin' at your bed
I was aimin' at your bitch, I was aimin' at your kid

[Chorus]
I'm sellin' pounds of weed, I got a thousand keys, ayy, ayy
I'm sellin' pounds of weed, I got a thousand keys, ayy, ayy
I really trap in this bitch, I really trap in this bitch, ayy, ayy
I don't just rap in this bitch, I don't just rap in this bitch, ayy, ayy
