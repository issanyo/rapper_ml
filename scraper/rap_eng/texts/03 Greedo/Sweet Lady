[Intro]
Its only one, 03

[Chorus]
I'm from Grape Street, where we G-slide
(G-slide and hit your Ricky ass)
Sweet Shay Shay, would you be mine?
You know I like 'em dark skin like Shay Shay
Got that pretty smooth skin like Fay Fay
I think Shanini got a body like Tata
She fuck with Greedy 'cause he fuck her like a pornstar
Freaky-deeky, heard her pussy got that voodoo
I know she gay but I done fell in love with Poo Poo
Sex appeal like butt butt, I'm like ooh woo
Go to court for a nigga like why goo

[Verse 1]
Fuck around and drop some codeine in my champagne
She going in like diamond lane in the diamond lane
She going down like the motherfuckin' stock exchange
Addicted like some cocaine to the campaign
I like the 'woods, kiss the motherfuckin' ashtray
One more time for Poo Poo, bet you I can make that ass shake
Baby I can get you straight, don't act gay
Fuck it, I won't interrupt you, get them stacks bae
I'm in Atlanta, you know one day I'll be back bae
Support my daughter May May, no back pay
If I gotta creep up on you with a masked face
Or put these bitches on the blade, fuck Backpage (fuck that)
Doin' numbers like a motherfuckin' facts page
Seventh letter, crooked ladder, get your facts straight (bangin')
All you niggas quick to tell, it's a rat race
Waste your time hating, I'ma go and rack chase

[Chorus]
I'm from Grape Street, where we G-slide
(Hahaha, free my nigga Tay though)
Sweet Shay Shay, would you be mine?
You know I like 'em dark skin like Shay Shay
Got that pretty smooth skin like Fay Fay
I think Shanini got a body like Tata
She fuck with Greedy 'cause he fuck her like a pornstar
Freaky-deeky, heard her pussy got that voodoo
I know she gay but I done fell in love with Poo Poo
Sex appeal like butt butt, I'm like ooh woo
Go to court for a nigga like why goo

[Verse 2]
Sweet lady
Grape Street lady, think she tryna have my baby
She know to have that sex appeal like Maury
She know to always keep it trill like BA
I do her wrong but I ain't in to being sorry
My other hottie left a nigga for a flea J
He ain't rollin' with no money, he a cheapskate
Oh I'm just tryna get a ticket like a sweepstakes
I love my hottie dumb thick like cheesecake
Run that bitch like Diddy, have you walkin' for some cheesecakes
Makin' that band say I'm the man 'cause that D came
Had a bitch that look like Cassie workin' three blades
I got a bitch who fuck me off the syrup, booty out
Smuggling something, got a porno over Mookie house
She got a body on her, pockets healthy
Which one look better, is it Kendra, is it Elthy?
I need a miracle, might ask the lord to help me
She a project bitch but look hella clean
Just a couple up-and-comers that be on the scene
Fuck her once under the covers like a bone meat
Got her wishin' it was some way she could clone me
I'ma just pull up somewhere up the road, she's really lonely

[Chorus]
I'm from Grape Street, where we G-slide
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Sweet Shay Shay, would you be mine?
You know I like 'em dark skin like Shay Shay
Got that pretty smooth skin like Fay Fay
I think Shanini got a body like Tata
She fuck with Greedy 'cause he fuck her like a pornstar
Freaky-deeky, heard her pussy got that voodoo
I know she gay but I done fell in love with Poo Poo
Sex appeal like butt butt, I'm like ooh woo
Go to court for a nigga like why goo

[Bridge]
I like all the hotties with the colors in their hair
Tats on they face with the buds in they ear
P-I-M-P, come and fuck with a player
Bang my whole gang and you know I won't care
At all, at all, at all
Watch a young nigga, ball, ball, ball
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Outro]
I don't know who I'm missin'
Oh, can't forget Nae Nae, she thick as a bull
GiGi she had all that ass, I ain't really seen her too much after the baby, but you see what was goin' on, haha
They say Pooka got it in, they don't talk about how, why, when, and where, hahaha
Hey, hey, if you from the Jordan Downs then come over there
Whoa whoa whoa
Too many hotties in my section, I want 'em all
Call me Greedy 'cause I want 'em all
Call me Greedy 'cause I want 'em all
I get GiGi 'cause I wanna ball
Take a project bitch off
