[Intro: 03 Greedo & Yung Pinch]
Ayy, wanna wake up, you got to go baby
Doing here? it's like 8 AM (All day)
She wanna spend the night, but she can't spend the night (Yeah)
(Beach boy in the sun)
She wanna be my wife, but she can't be my wife (Yeah, her)
Yeah

[Chorus: Yung Pinch & 03 Greedo]
She said she hate when I go, she want me to stay
Wish I didn't have to leave so soon, it's too late
I'm already on the first flight, out through the door
My phone doesn't work right now, leave me 'lone
She got syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She pat out her nose and she don't wear no makeup
She keep syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
We gon' make up every time we break up
She got syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She don't wanna wake up, she don't wanna
Syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She don't wanna wake up, yeah

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
She got syrup in her double cup, that's what fuck her up
When I pull up I'ma fill her guts, fill her tummy up
When I pull up she just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck
But I told her I can't fall in love, no we can't fall in love
She be always tryna spend the night, tryna spend the night
I'm just tryna let her by, tryna let her by
She do everything I like, everything I like
But she can't be my wife, she can't be my wife
Project niggas and you know our life was dark, ooh
I was out there thuggin' every night, making moves
I done graduated from that shit, ooh
That's the reason she in love with me, yeah yeah yeah
I done graduated to the G
Now they tryna put me in a penitentiary

[Chorus: Yung Pinch & 03 Greedo]
She said she hate when I go, she want me to stay
Wish I didn't have to leave so soon, it's too late
I'm already on the first flight, out to the door
My phone doesn't work right now, leave me 'lone
She got syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She pat out her nose and she don't wear no makeup
She keep syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
We gon' make up every time we break up
She got syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She don't wanna wake up, she don't wanna
Syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She don't wanna wake up, yeah

[Verse 2: Yung Pinch]
She said baby don't you go, she want me to stay
She want me to fuck all night, all day
Been through this before I can't be your bae
But we can still fuck right now, don't play
You know how I like it, ass down, face up
I don't really like it when bitches gotta cake up
Bitch I'm out the cell and I just smoked eight blunts
Tell the flight attendant I don't wanna wake up
Wait I'm gettin' to this money, probably why they hate us
Need it right now, I don't wanna wait up
Heard she got a new man, won't take no paycuts
I ain't fucking with no bitch that ain't got big butt

[Chorus: Yung Pinch & 03 Greedo]
She said she hate when I go, she want me to stay
Wish I didn't have to leave so soon, it's too late
I'm already on the first flight, out to the door
My phone doesn't work right now, leave me 'lone
She got syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She pat out her nose and she don't wear no makeup
She keep syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
We gon' make up every time we break upShe got syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She don't wanna wake up, she don't wanna
Syrup in her hand, she don't wanna wake up
She don't wanna wake up, yeah
