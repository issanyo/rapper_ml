[Intro]
Yeah, whoa, ayy
Oh, yeah, 03, yeah
I feel like Jason or somethin' baby
We makin' a killing with that white, ayy

[Chorus]
Gutter nigga, fuck another nigga, I'ma pull the trigger on my own
I'm a hitter, fuck another hitter, I'ma hit a nigga with the chrome
Chopper breakin' glass like some crystal, left a nigga with a broken home
I'm a killer, you are not a killer, all they gave me was a broken bone
Aimin' at a hater's dome, 'member aimin' at the floor
AK was too strong, still could hit a nigga's dome
Don't be trippin' with your phone, y'all be trippin' like some hoes
Don't be trippin' with your phone, y'all be trippin' like some hoes
Bringin' that gutter shit back, bringin' that gutter shit back
Bringin' that gutter shit back, Drummer Gang hit you with MAC's, ayy, ayy
Bringin' that gutter shit back, bringin' that gutter shit back
Havin' an asthma attack, blower came right out the stash

[Verse]
Keep a kilo, smokin', sippin' some tequila
2Pac back, never hit the fetus
Crippin', creepin' up, it's a creature
In a feature, fly as jeepers creepers
Newest hottie is a paralegal
'Member poppin' niggas out the regal
Ballin' with my shooters, desert eagle
We some heathens, you was never evil
We some demons but we feed the people
Realest nigga, I'ma teach the people
No rap beef, you can get the ether
In the kitchen with the egg beater
Gettin' chicken, ran into the heater
Sneakin' geekin', hit her in the sneakers
Fuck a greetin' and it's nice to met you
Talk is cheap and these haters cheaper
Treatin' every thottie like she ain't a keeper
Tell a bad bitch bye Felicia
Won't see you next Friday either
Been hot, nigga y'all was sleepin'
I was starvin' nigga, now I'm eatin'
Your ho was loyal nigga, now she cheatin'
Chick-Fil-A with the Polynesian
Hit Billboard, nigga now we beefin'?

[Chorus]
Gutter nigga, fuck another nigga, I'ma pull the trigger on my own
I'm a hitter, fuck another hitter, I'ma hit a nigga with the chrome
Chopper breakin' glass like some crystal, left a nigga with a broken home
I'm a killer, you are not a killer, all they gave me was a broken bone
Aimin' at a hater's dome, 'member aimin' at the floor
AK was too strong, still could hit a nigga's dome
Don't be trippin' with your phone, y'all be trippin' like some hoes
Don't be trippin' with your phone, y'all be trippin' like some hoes
Bringin' that gutter shit back, bringin' that gutter shit back
Bringin' that gutter shit back, Drummer Gang hit you with MAC's, ayy, ayy
Bringin' that gutter shit back, bringin' that gutter shit back
Havin' an asthma attack, blower came right out the stash

[Outro]
Bringin' that gutter shit back, bringin' that gutter shit back, ayy, ayy
Bringin' that gutter shit back, Drummer Gang hit you with MAC's, ayy, ayy
Bringin' that gutter shit back, bringin' that gutter shit back, ayy, ayy
Havin' an asthma attack, blower came right out the stash, ayy, ayy
