[Intro]
Yeah, turn the beat up
Yeah-ayy, ayy, turn it up, ayy, 03
Just left, yeah
Oh, I just left, Grape
I just left Oakland
Tell me what you think, did a show
In New York did an interview
Now we back in the A, ayy

[Chorus]
Just left New York, still got snow on my shoulders
My lil partners might just fuck around and snort them a boulder
I be camoed down, I came in with the soldiers
Make project music like I came from Magnolia
Been around the world, fucked all type of girls
All these hoes want is the diamonds and pearls
I nickname her Tiffany, shine with my girl
Nickname her Tiffany, shine with my girl

[Verse]
Pussy make the world go 'round
Money make your girl go down
She been around the town, yeah
We met in the Jordan Downs, yeah
First date I got head
And I knew she was with it
Led her to Grape, oh
She suckin' me and this bitch is gifted
Still ain't gon' hit it
I'm 'bout my riches (halo on top of her head)
I'm 'bout my business, ayy
Might spoil her, might spoil her, ayy
Might spoil her, might spoil her, ayy
Her daddy is a baller, 'nother dad is what she called her
Facts, yeah

[Chorus]
Just left New York, still got snow on my shoulders
My lil partners them might just go snort them a boulder
Stay camoed down, 'cause I came in with soldiers
Make project music like I came from Magnolia

[Outro]
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, Magnolia
This is three up top, not the 'Nolia clap
We got three up top, this ain't the 'Nolia clap
We got three up top, this ain't the 'Nolia clap
Projects like I'm from Magnolia
New Juvie, baby I'm Soldier
Bitch slim but my bitch still colder
She ain't got beat on her phone
I got a model at home
Alright let me hear it from the top, this shit hard
