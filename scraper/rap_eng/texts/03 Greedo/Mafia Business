[Chorus]
You gonna make me put you in a suit and tie
Steady speakin' 'bout my work but its not your business
You ain't about no business
Some niggas talk like bitches
We was brought up by the Mafia
We was taught to keep it Mafia
We done lost that nigga Mafia
We gone them give my niggas the business

[Verse]
I don't have a dime I just keep it luck
Bitch I'm broke why you mad?
Get that money out your ass
Open your eyes you is not her
I won't give a bitch a bag
Got a go call when you get yo bag
'cause I'm walking with a limp that don't mean I pimp
Man I hope she ain't mad I am not him
Ray, hes my nigga he say we ain't shit
Tryna do it for a nigga that we can't forget
Run my life up in the sack don't feel the same without my nigga here
We jump in the same gang for a 100 years
Man I swear I haven't cried in 100 years
Last night a nigga cried about 100 tears
Tell the hoes I need 40
Tell them all I want 40
Used to be broke, still had Nike, Puma, Jordan
Man I swear without my Ray, my life's boring
Got a gold bank, got a gold check
Gotta keep it mafia with all the hoes

I was about to hit my Ricky
Pulling up in the 50
I was swerving through the traffic
Rollin' but then I had to pass it
We been breaking down that backwood
I've been into selling that good
If you with me then you're that good
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
You gonna make me put you in a suit and tie
Steady speakin' 'bout my work but its not your business
You ain't about no business
Some niggas talk like bitches
We was brought up by the Mafia
We was taught to keep it Mafia
We done lost that nigga Mafia
We gone them give my niggas the business
You gonna make me put you in a suit and tie
Steady speakin' 'bout my work but its not your business
You ain't about no business
Some niggas talk like bitches
We was brought up by the Mafia
We was taught to keep it Mafia
We done lost that nigga Mafia
We gone them give my niggas the business
