[Verse 1: ALLBLACK]
Man who the fuck is top, so cold, I'm the one that's trife
Tee-Tee hate me 'cause I played the bitch twice
Yeah I know I'm out of pocket, I was playin' with life
I'm black and shiny, all gold, hold the ice
I'ma keep my jeans up my ankles and keep all my mics
Driver's seat, I'm gettin' rolled like a bike
I'm finna club live air baby, I ain't feelin' the yike
I'm at Benis, skim you well, Jackson chicken with rice
I'm too high off the molly, got my dick goin' soft
Plus her pussy bunk as hell and it smell like stroganoff
I remember pourin' powdered milk on Apple Jacks
Skippin' PE, stealin' shit out niggas' backpacks, it's BLACK

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I'm too high off the coke, it got my dick goin' soft
These niggas do the cool jersey, I let the heat cool off
How you know it's good coke if you ain't snortin' the snow?
Test the work, these niggas scared to test the business
All these niggas focus on is havin' sex with bitches
Project niggas, I'm the one who made it out the trenches
Since the age of 18 I only seen 03 Thanksgivings
Thirteen K to see their Christmas
Wipe me down key, I feel some tension
Beside me, menage me, we be gettin' busy
Hide the work in her skirt, made her squirt when we get it
Breakin' down the work, we do division, ayy

[Verse 3: Nef the Pharaoh]
I'm on the molly with that flame like I'm Ghost Rider
I know the truth about your raps, you got a ghost writer
If you ain't never been in London on a double decker
Then you can't say it with your chest because you playin' checkers
I elevated on a nigga, made it hard to reach
I don't miss officers, this ain't Tha Carter 3
Her last nigga broke her heart 'cause she bargain for cheap
And then she came and sat with Chang and I sold her a dream
All praise to Allah, BLACK fuck with me
Cuttin' through these blue hundreds like a buck fifty
Why all these half ass niggas got they cup empty?
I'm 'bout to do the bitch pussy like dope did Whitney

[Chorus: ALLBLACK]
Stephen Curry how I ball out
LBJ how I ball out, ball out
Kyrie Irving how I ball out
I can't foul out, that bald nigga with his tongue out
Stephen Curry how I ball out
LBJ how I ball out, ball out
Kyrie Irving how I ball out
I can't foul out, that bald nigga with his tongue out

[Outro: ALLBLACK]
Yeah, Neffy, Big Chang
Thank you for fuckin' with me
03, thank you for fuckin' with me
DTB, DTB, thank you
