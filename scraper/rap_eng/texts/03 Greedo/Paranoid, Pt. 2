[Chorus]
Paranoid, hearin' voices
Seein' things, makin' choices
You need a nigga with some felonies
And baby if they ask you I'm just sellin' weed
Hearin' voices
Seein' things, makin' choices
You need a nigga with some felonies
And baby if they ask you I'm just sellin' weed

[Verse 1]
When I'm OT and I'm breaking down boulders
I gotta look over my shoulder
I put the juice in my soda
To stay calm when I'm touching that yola
Me and J feel like G-Boy and Yola
Can't believe that our dog's life is over
Mercy me, worry me
Put them snakes around my collar when they bury me
'Cause it kept it G, they still hated me
Who enemigos wanna be in that two plane and see
Just got a room but in the lobby was emergency
Bullets in me but they wasn't tryna murder me
And that's the part that worry me
'Cause I can't let these niggas bury me

[Chorus]
Paranoid, hearin' voices
Seein' things, makin' choices
You need a nigga with some felonies
And baby if they ask you I'm just sellin' weed
Hearin' voices
Seein' things, makin' choices
You need a nigga with some felonies
And baby if they ask you I'm just sellin' weed

[Verse 2]
I feel like every other second I have something at my window
I feel like a serpent ridin' with me in the Benzo
Mind playin' tricks on me, I feel like the Getto Boyz
Coca like I'm Scarface, throwin' D like Rich Boy
Come and get your bitch boy, I admit I get 'nnoyed
When she spend the night and I get in it like a hemmroid
I know it hurt, I hit that ass, I'm talkin' shit boy
Me and Scars 'em, Lil Money, Ray, and Big Boy
Who else would think
I'm asking God to wake me up from this nightmare and dream
I swear my life so bittersweet, it feel like both things
I got one foot in industry and one foot in the streets
I got some people bangin' grape but way in Tennessee
New York, Atlanta, Texas, Carolina
Call and see, private callers callin' me
I took a flight later that night and end up in the D
Was way in Phoenix when they tried to get a hold of me

[Chorus]
Paranoid, hearin' voices
Seein' things, makin' choices
You need a nigga with some felonies
And baby if they ask you I'm just sellin' weed
Hearin' voices
Seein' things, makin' choices
You need a nigga with some felonies
And baby if they ask you I'm just sellin' weed

[Outro]
Sellin' weed, yeah yeah
Got keys, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, and lean, and lean
