[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Ridin' with stick out on my seat, huh
I'ma go and work your lil bitch, oh you a freak, huh
Heard them boys did a street sweep while you sleep, huh
She gon' run off with the sack and give it all to me, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Ridin' with stick out on my seat, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
She gon' run off with the sack and give it all to me, huh

[Verse 1: ManMan Savage]
Catch a nigga down player, I don't miss a beat, huh
Walked in, I was Gucci'd down to the feet, huh
Ridin' 'round with that stick in the front seat, huh
Bad bitch in the bathroom, not to pee, huh
Went and got drop head just to feel the breeze, huh
Since Juvenile been 400 Degreez, huh
Young hot nigga but my neck still on freeze, huh
She gon' get the sack and bring it back to me, huh

[Verse 2: Runway Richy]
You ain't stick to the G code, boy you told, huh
Got bitches, you be flexin' for these hoes, huh
Poppin' poppin', playin' the gangster role, huh
You got exposed, huh, case closed, huh, yeah

Shootin' a hundred shots, I call my chopper Wilt Chamberlin
Your bitches can't be savin' them
I'm flexin' on a hater, WrestleMania
Put 'em on a plate, them niggas ate 'em up

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Ridin' with stick out on my seat, huh

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
You mad I made it out the mud, huh
Really sold the drugs, huh
Pullin' up with them thugs, huh
You was out here talkin' like you tough, huh
Think you bulletproof 'cause you get buff, huh
Tryna get a lil buzz up, buddy buddy with the opps, ain't it
Ridin' 'round with the cops, ain't it
Still sendin' out subs, huh
I'm in the field with the heaters like the Super Bowl
Boom boom boom, jakes at the door
My condo came with marble floors, ayy

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Ridin' with stick out on my seat, huh
I'ma go and work your lil bitch, oh you a freak, huh
Heard them boys did a street sweep while you sleep, huh
She gon' run off with the sack and give it all to me, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Ridin' with stick out on my seat, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
She gon' run off with the sack and give it all to me, huh
