[Pre-Hook: Kacy Hill]
I was in an empty space
Avoiding your love, never gave me grace
Spending all my time away
Better to want you in retrograde

[Hook: Kacy Hill & 03 Greedo]
And how do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
What makes you make me feel like a nigga?
Are you just here 'cause I'm a drug dealer?
What makes you make me feel like a nigga?
I know you need the protection of a hitter
I'ma leave the dank out
Gucci'd down, molly'd up
Say she love the way I sauce
Let me serve her out of town
She be beggin' for the clout
Baby out the Jordan Downs
We been through some ups and downs
But she gon' always be around
Kept it right out of the doubt

[Pre-Hook: Kacy Hill]
I was in an empty space
Avoiding your love, never gave me grace
Spending all my time away
Better to want you in retrograde

[Hook: Kacy Hill & 03 Greedo]
And how do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Go snort a line to Kacy Hill
That's how this dick gon' make you feel
I'm off a percocet pill
I'll fuck you 'til my syrup spills
I put two cups on her booty
I wanna fuck on her groovy
We finna make us a movie
Love is rage like Lil Uzi
Love and hate like The-Dream
Purple kisses, our beauty
Only one on my team
Only one like 03
We too tight, I can't lose it
It's too tight, I can loosen
Feel me up when she do me
When we hardly be coolin'
This a hotbox, just use it

[Pre-Hook: Kacy Hill]
I was in an empty space
Avoiding your love, never gave me grace
Spending all my time away
Better to want you in retrograde

[Hook: Kacy Hill]
And how do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?

[Outro: Kacy Hill & 03 Greedo]
What makes you make me feel like a woman? (What makes you make me feel like a nigga?)
I'm saying things that I thought that I wouldn't (What makes me make you feel like a woman?)
And now you caught me, remind me of my beating heart (Yeah)
I'll be your Venus if you are my Mars, yeah (Yeah)
What makes you make me feel like a woman? (Like a woman)
Like a nigga
