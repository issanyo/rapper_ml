[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I remember niggas turned on me
Niggas actin' like they never really heard of me
Now I'm hoppin' out with pistols, let it burn on 'em
Watching how the tables turned on 'em

[Verse: Maxo Kream]
Treat your niggas like your brothers, you would never turn your back
Right or wrong for your brothers, you would bust a nigga cap
Used to mob deep as hell, you had a hundred niggas strapped
Now you locked up in jail, where them hundred niggas at?
Probably tryna fuck your main, they ain't worried 'bout you, nigga
But they screaming free your name on they Instagram and Twitter
Niggas cappin' for the 'gram but they ain't give you one dollar
How that post to be your mans, but he ain't checkin' on your momma?
Took away your commissary, think the boss man on some jelly shit
Had 50 bands on you, but they put it with the evidence
Your name ring bells, still eating in the county
Before you made it to your cell, you had soups and brownies
You gon' eat regardless, but your niggas left you starvin'
But when the drama pop off, you the first one they callin'
Remember whatchamacallit took the box and stole the pounds
And you pulled up on his block, with the Glock and gunned him down
Caught him lackin' from behind, you cocked the 9 and popped the iron
Put your life on the line, but your niggas let you down
You ain't bitchin', you ain't cryin', got a heart of a lion
No snitchin', testifyin', day for day, you do the time
Your lawyer said your homie snitchin', you thought it was a lie
Then you read that black and white, broke your heart and crushed your pride
The same blood nigga that you called your lil' bro
The same lil' nigga droppin' names like a hoe
Took him to interrogation, he was posin', fake stiff
Let them crackers fast talk him, now he shakin' like a bitch
Laws threw some time at him, started singin', Taylor Swift
Told on you for a Coca-Cola and some cigarettes
Cut from a different cloth, these fuck niggas made different
Screamin' "death before dishonor", swear to God, you really live it
Laws tried to question you, you told them crackers burn in hell
Take a .38 shell before you ever talk to 12

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I remember niggas turned on me
Niggas actin' like they never really heard of me
Now I'm hoppin' out with pistols, let it burn on 'em
Watching how the tables turned on 'em

[Outro: 03 Greedo]
I've been betrayed, I've been betrayed
Hoppin' out with Ks, aimin' at they face
Bitch, I've been betrayed, I've been betrayed
Hoppin' out with Ks, aimin' at they face
