[Intro: Lil Pete & 03 Greedo]
Ayy
03, Lil Pete
I ain't even gon' lie
I ain't even gon' lie
Why these niggas tellin' lies?

[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I ain't even gon' lie
The street shit is all a nigga know
I'ma have to get it how it go
Wonder why they always tryna lie, tellin' lies
I ain't even gon' lie
The street shit is all a nigga know
I'ma have to get it how it go
Wonder why they always tryna lie, tellin' lies

[Verse 1: Lil Pete]
By myself, I ain't never needed you
Twenty bands, I could count blues on blues
Strip club, VIP, we drinkin' mud with it
I don't want it by myself unless the thugs get it
I fell in love with the street shit
And I ain't even gon' lie
I fell in love with this fast life
Fast money, fast cars, and the trap life
We gon' get it out the mud
Fuck your cosign, we don't need your love
I pull up to the block with the thugs
Wrong wrong turn, we might shoot shit up
Every time somethin' happens, we the ones to blame
Know they comin' when I call, I don't gotta say
Bro kinda mainy but he go brazy
Never fall for these hoes, yeah they can't play me

[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I ain't even gon' lie
The street shit is all a nigga know
I'ma have to get it how it go
Wonder why they always tryna lie, tellin' lies
I ain't even gon' lie
The street shit is all a nigga know
I'ma have to get it how it go
Wonder why they always tryna lie, tellin' lies

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I ain't even been alive
I been fuckin' with the blow
I been playin' with my nose
Yeah I love gettin' high
I been facin' so much time
You would never even know
How it feels to lose my lil nigga Nelly
At the bus stop right by the store
I used to never ever cry
'Til my lil brother died
Just another homicide
I can't swallow my pride
I don't never go to sleep, I ain't lyin' down
You the hottest in the street, oh we lyin' now?
Well I guess I am a pussy and I am a bitch
Well I guess I am a rookie, guess I am a snitch

[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I ain't even gon' lie
The street shit is all a nigga know
I'ma have to get it how it go
Wonder why they always tryna lie, tellin' lies
I ain't even gon' lie
The street shit is all a nigga know
I'ma have to get it how it go
Wonder why they always tryna lie, tellin' lies

[Outro: Lil Pete]
Don't lie, I ain't even gon' lie
I ain't even gon' lie
Why you always tellin' lies, you a liar
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Lie, why you always gotta tell lies
