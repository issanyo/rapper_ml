[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
I got them Futures on my feet, I feel like Pluto
I just dropped my bottom bitch, then I knocked two hoes
Took the laces out my kicks and now I'm swaggin' nigga
It's pink dolphins on my pills and on my jackets nigga
I be fuckin' all types of bitches, they just gotta be bad nigga
My pull out game vicious, I'm not your dad nigga
You still my son, gotta keep that drum
And my [?] OG's are one of one

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Run up a check like a track star, shoot a three, no backboard
What's a goon to black boy?, i ain't scared, I ain't scared
It's Halloween all year, codeine all year
Shawty high off a perc dry, I know your vision ain't clear
Ain't have no pot to piss in, you ain't give me no hand when I needed it
Best friends turned snake in front of my eyes, couldn't believe the shit
I just had to level up on 'em, Forgiatos on the truck on 'em
Your baby mama backstage on the tour bus, lettin' me fuck on her
Fifty racks when I walk inside the Neimans, that's gettin' blowed quick
Overseas havin' that Cali pack on me, I got it in shipments
Black bitch in a foreign ride, steering wheel on the other side
I tuck the dope in between her thighs, I'm livin' like I'm televised

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
I got them Futures on my feet, I feel like Pluto
I just dropped my bottom bitch, then I knocked two hoes
Took the laces out my kicks and now I'm swaggin' nigga
It's pink dolphins on my pills and on my jackets nigga
I be fuckin' all types of bitches, they just gotta be bad nigga
My pull out game vicious, I'm not your dad nigga
You still my son, gotta keep that drum
And my [?] OG's are one of one

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Fuck that, I'm wifin' bitches
Keep it with me like a license picture
Pretty lady with the pink hair
Legs folded like a pink flamingo
Pink dolphin give me all the freakies
Poppin' off me like my diamonds Fiji
I like my diamonds purple, representing that's [?]
Purpled down like a Teletubbie, I remember I was Barney blowing
Up it since I heard The Jacka on me
Every summer stayed in Sacramento
I was trappin' on the mack road
E pills had me on the come oat
I got to stretch out when I'm on the road
Shittin' on niggas, I really sell dope
Margiela, offset with the coat
I had to green up the ice and the coke
I got the lean but it's for me to bowl
Shout out to Future, F Beezy the movie
I'm too paranoid, I can't skeet in a groupie
I got a shooter with ice on Osama
Who's stackin' the commas, who's still wearin' goofy

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
I got them Futures on my feet, I feel like Pluto
I just dropped my bottom bitch, then I knocked two hoes
Took the laces out my kicks and now I'm swaggin' nigga
It's pink dolphins on my pills and on my jackets nigga
I be fuckin' all types of bitches, they just gotta be bad nigga
My pull out game vicious, I'm not your dad nigga
You still my son, gotta keep that drum
And my [?] OG's are one of one
