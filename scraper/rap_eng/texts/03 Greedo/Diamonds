[Chorus]
I can't wait to put them diamonds on my fist
I can't wait to hit the islands with my bitch
I can't wait to get designer on my kicks
I been shining, now she grinding on my dick
All these top notch hoes need project dick
Project dick keep them hoes sick
Her neck, her back, my neck, my wrist
No more Nike on my kicks, my check my bitch

[Verse 1]
White girl, friend of Migos that know Katy Perry
Kicked your bitch, kidnap in traffic, not no Halle Berry
All this dribble got me crossin' over, never carry
Chopper with no luggage, when you got a bag you hurry
Gettin' dressed inside the mall, came in shorts and all
I feel like I'm Lil Flip, this is the way we ball
Gettin' high in high end, knock out like I'm Tyson
Concrete jungle, wild thoughts, we Rihanna Bryson
Street nigga with a license, keep it legal when I'm drivin'
Too illegal when inside it, baby it's a gangster party
Pussy niggas not invited, you ain't never catch a body
Homie ain't about a homi, he still livin' off his mommy
Real nigga, baby I'm a real nigga
You should fuck a nigga who been workin' on a meal ticket
I remember meal missing, now I'm on a bill mission
Natural ass like kill semi, baby you should deal with me

[Chorus]
I can't wait to put them diamonds on my fist
I can't wait to hit the islands with my bitch
I can't wait to get designer on my kicks
I been shining, now she grinding on my dick
All these top notch hoes need project dick
Project dick keep them hoes sick
Her neck, her back, my neck, my wrist
No more Nike on my kicks, my check my bitch

[Verse 2]
I can't wait to sell niggas who ain't fuck with niggas
I can't wait to fuck these bitches who ain't fuck with niggas
I can't wait to get that Wraith, Audi R8
Only Beamer I would skate is that i8
Bentley truck, Montley truck, floatin' in that Tesla
Better have a bank just to get to know me better
Balenciaga bunions, bitch I'm in a Kenzo sweater
I put Gucci on my glasses, now I'm lookin' better
Ho touch your tiptoe, insert your info
Might beat it up to the same instrumental
Bitch what it hit for?
I like them girls with them tattoos and dimples
Not in your face, I'm talkin' 'bout your ass
Blowin' on me like a sax, talkin' all that jazz
Gotta be an SUV if I'ma ride a Jag
Me and Live on 'Deo Drive, poppin' all the tags

[Chorus]
I can't wait to put them diamonds on my fist
I can't wait to hit the islands with my bitch
I can't wait to get designer on my kicks
I been shining, now she grinding on my dick
All these top notch hoes need project dick
Project dick keep them hoes sick
Her neck, her back, my neck, my wrist
No more Nike on my kicks, my check my bitch
