[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Niggas best beware when we show up
All my niggas carry a blower
You could get your whole block tore up
Thinkin' that we scared 'cause we blew up
Niggas best beware when we show up
All my niggas carry a blower
You could get your whole block tore up
Thinkin' we got scared 'cause we blew up
We got the blowers on us, ayy
We keep the blowers on us, ooh
We got the blowers on us, yeah
We keep the blowers on us, ayy
We keep the blowers on us

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
As a kid I was strapped on the bus
All the crips used to call it the cuss
All the crips used to call it the sus
All of these bitches was sus
It ain't a nigga I trust
I'ma pull up and I bust
You know we don't give a fuck
We used to crip walk with our fingers
I never thought I would be singin'
I never thought I would be blingin'
'Cause I was right there like I'm Chingy
I be strapped when I'm walkin' in Neimans
Never ever been a Marcus
Big bag, he stingin'
Got it out the flea market

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Niggas best beware when we show up
All my niggas carry a blower
You could get your whole block tore up
Thinkin' that we scared 'cause we blew up
Niggas best beware when we show up
All my niggas carry a blower
You could get your whole block tore up
Thinkin' we got scared 'cause we blew up
We got the blowers on us, ayy
We keep the blowers on us, ooh
We got the blowers on us, yeah
We keep the blowers on us, ayy
We keep the blowers on us

[Verse 2: AD]
In the lab I keep a blammer on me, 'case I ever hear the cold world
Swing to Vegas for the big guns, bullets lookin' size of cold waters
Got the forty for me ese, keep a fifty in his old chopper
We ain't playin' when we hit the court, we be ballin' like them Globetrotters
Hoes be playin', never fucked a nigga, when a nigga had them broke pockets
All these presidents up in my jeans, they all dead, I call them ghost pockets
We got weapons like the Ghostbusters, I won't go out if it's no problem
Little homies with the gotti thirst, Nike store, we boostin' Foamposites
Triple ounce, they eatin' healthy cake, then I hit the lab with Greedo
From the gutter, probably never change, homie still drinkin' Titos
Cracker smoke you every Friday, jackin' niggas like Debo
Insane diss then you can lose your mama, you the new Finding Nemo

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Niggas best beware when we show up
All my niggas carry a blower
You could get your whole block tore up
Thinkin' that we scared 'cause we blew up
Niggas best beware when we show up
All my niggas carry a blower
You could get your whole block tore up
Thinkin' we got scared 'cause we blew up
We got the blowers on us, ayy
We keep the blowers on us, ooh
We got the blowers on us, yeah
We keep the blowers on us, ayy
We keep the blowers on us
