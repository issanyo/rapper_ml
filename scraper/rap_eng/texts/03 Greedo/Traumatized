[Chorus]
All these money bags left me traumatized
Hit the cookie bag, now I'm hypnotized
When that beef is on we don't apologize
Most my niggas dead, didn't see age 25
All these money bags left me traumatized
Hit the cookie bag, now I'm hypnotized
When that beef is on we don't apologize
Most my niggas dead, didn't see age 25

[Verse]
Lost homies to the judge, lost homies to the gun
Ridin' 'round with a grudge, ridin' 'round with a drum
Young and I'm reckless
How could I be where I'm at in the game after that and I keep a protection
I'm in your bushes late night like a demon, you know I'm the creep of the section
I'm back and I'm flexin'
I got a picture of me in the session
Hop out on enemies at intersection
I'll never take the loss again, you know I paid the cost to win
You know I paved the way for them, I wanted three but all of them, ayy
Fuckers steady callin' in on me, next call was contained
Free all of my gang, let 'em out of the chains
All my dogs in the cage, all my dogs in the grave
I don't do it for the fame, I just do it for the grade

[Chorus]
All these money bags left me traumatized
Hit the cookie bag, now I'm hypnotized
When that beef is on we don't apologize
Most my niggas dead, didn't see age 25
All these money bags left me traumatized
Hit the cookie bag, now I'm hypnotized
When that beef is on we don't apologize
Most my niggas dead, didn't see age 25
