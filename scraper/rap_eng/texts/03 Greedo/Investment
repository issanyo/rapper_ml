[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
You spend your very last dollars on a chain
Might spend my very last dollars on a Rolls Royce Wraith
Spend your very last dollars on some lean
I get high with my supplier so it's paying for itself
Its a investment, Its a investment, Its a investment

[Verse 1: Destodubb]
Pressure make diamonds, then I'm diamond tester
Can't walk a mile in my Masion Margielas
I got the Benz, peanut butter leather
Space Jam jays, they padded leather
Gun a Beretta, pour a two just to feel better
Might be fly, but I'm way fresher
You got from Mike and I got it from Hector
Invest in that lean and that liquid I make
My life is a movie, no it's an adventure
Finding my chain when I got arrested
Must have been my best investment
The clothes that I wear, that was made by me
All of this lean that I sell in these streets
I wrestle with snakes and I argue with thieves
Invest in my bitch and I got her a weave
My car in her name but I got the key
Invest in these pills and I'm sellin' xannies
Police behind me, I'm actin' [?]
Invest in this warrant, I got my army
God protect me from my enemies
Bought it for five and I sell for a G
Flipped every cent, now I need my money
Flipped every cent, now I need my money

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
You spend your very last dollars on a chain
Might spend my very last dollars on a Rolls Royce Wraith
Spend your very last dollars on some lean
I get high with my supplier so it's paying for itself
Its a investment, Its a investment, Its a investment

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Run up the money
I was leanin' the molly, the cookie, the coke and the crystal
You leave me down with the drugs
So you know I'm official, I go on a mission
I'm [?] ,had to get a motel with the kitchen
Judgin' no soul with no disses, pay the jade do the dishes
I know you copy the flow, the shit that you sayin' really fictious
Run up three my initials, drummer gang tot pistols
I'm a fucker, never kiss her, when the mail get delivered
Good gas every Wednesday, make it snow in the summer
Go gold and purple summer, made my own marijuana
I don't wear Abercrombie, walk around off the addy
Walk around like it summer, tell these fuck niggas
I don't fuck around [?]

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
You spend your very last dollars on a chain
Might spend my very last dollars on a Rolls Royce Wraith
Spend your very last dollars on some lean
I get high with my supplier so it's paying for itself
Its a investment, Its a investment, Its a investment
