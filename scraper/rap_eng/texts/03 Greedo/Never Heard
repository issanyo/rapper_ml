[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, whoa
Whoa, 03, ayy, ayy, whoa, whoa whoa, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I never heard of these niggas, no
This nigga talkin' 'bout he got a body, what body?
They talkin' all that, all that jazz, you dig
Ayy, they talkin' all that jazz
What happened back in the past?
Ron-Ron do that shit

[Chorus]
I never heard of these niggas, you never murdered a nigga, no, no
I never heard of these niggas, you never murdered a nigga, whoa, whoa
Shooters on shooters on shooters, this a chopper, no Ruger, ayy, ayy
Shooters on shooters on shooters, this a chopper, no Ruger, whoa, whoa
I never heard of these niggas, you never murdered a nigga, no, no
I never heard of these niggas, you never murdered a nigga, whoa, whoa
Shooters on shooters on shooters, this a chopper, no Ruger, ayy, ayy
Shooters on shooters on shooters, this a chopper, no Ruger, wait, wait, ooh

[Verse]
Handle a nigga like a mop, bedroom full of chops, whoa, whoa
Don't fuck with the opps, whole hood full of cops, no go
I be focused on the wealth, I be rollin' by myself, solo
Trees like a Keebler elf, cookies coolin' on the shelf, free smoke
He took a hit, fucked around and got smoked
How could you test me, you know I'm off coke
Drug drippin' down the bitch throat, red head, Lil Boat
QC in the float, quarter chicken was the quote, hit the weed 'til it's a roach
Niggas used to fly coach, had to switch up the approach
Told the bitch I'm domineer, ho you fuckin' with a player, hit me and the whole crew
Drummer Gang like a snare, bullets flyin' in the air, fresh prince, Bel-Air
That was over niggas' heads, shoot a nigga from the bed, baby roll me like some Pez
Should've left the bitch instead, now it's nothin' to get dead, kill him then I get some head
From another nigga bitch, oops I did that shit again
Blame it on the Brit Spears, why these niggas steady playin', call a nigga every spears
Face a nigga fears, wet him like some tears, all these niggas weird
Fuck these niggas hatin', all these bitches sayin'
It's a nigga year, it's a nigga year, yeah

[Chorus]
I never heard of these niggas, you never murdered a nigga, no, no
I never heard of these niggas, you never murdered a nigga, whoa, whoa
Shooters on shooters on shooters, this a chopper, no Ruger, ayy, ayy
Shooters on shooters on shooters, this a chopper, no Ruger, whoa, whoa
I never heard of these niggas, you never murdered a nigga, no, no
I never heard of these niggas, you never murdered a nigga, whoa, whoa
Shooters on shooters on shooters, this a chopper, no Ruger, ayy, ayy
Shooters on shooters on shooters, this a chopper, no Ruger, wait, wait, ooh
