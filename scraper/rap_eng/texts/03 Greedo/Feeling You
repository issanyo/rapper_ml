[Intro: 03 Greedo]
See you in your feelings, but I
See you in your feelings, but I

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you (Chang Chang)
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
I can see you in your feelings, I got twenty-twenty vision
I had funk with your brother, now that nigga never visit
I really think he scared of me, it might be the bear in me
A Northern California nigga, death to all my enemies
I got your text baby, but I ain't read it
It was too long and I'm conceited, plus you had too many reasons
For all the times I did you bad and ever made me sad
Your friends talk about me daily, tell 'em kiss my ass
You almost had me stressed out but I ain't mad at you
'Cause your new nigga gon' be broke, can't throw that bag at you
Bad Blac Chyna neck, shit weak, ball catcher
While I'm the type to buy the store and throw the mall at you
Chang Chang

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I can't really handle your lil fingers in my face too much
You be in your feelings so that's why we always out of touch
I was in the hand to hand, you was in Fendis up
Feelin' like somebody 'cause you gave that lil pussy up
Thought you'd make me mad, huh? where did you get that from?
Really I was wondering who your mama and your dad was
They ain't teach you nothin' better, how to keep a man forever
Give me head and make me breakfast, bacons, eggs, and extra cheddar
I'ma need the money out these hoes in the morning (I need money at the door)
I'ma need the money out these hoes in the morning (I need money at the door)

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you
I see you in your feelings but I, I ain't feelin' like you
I just love the way it's feelin' when I'm, when I'm feelin' on you

[Outro: 03 Greedo & Nef The Pharaoh]
I see you in your feelings, I can see you in your feelings
I can see you in your feelings, I can see you in your feelings
Your head I'ma kill it, I can feel it
I can see you in your feelings
Got your feet touchin' the ceiling
I can see why you would feel it
You won't see me in my feelings
You understand me, it's not me, that's the next man
You won't catch me in my feelings
Hah, you so
All I'm seeing is a million
Stacking money to the ceiling
We the rappers in the building
03, unlimited
Mmh, Chang Chang
We gettin' rich
Could you get up out your feelings bitch?
