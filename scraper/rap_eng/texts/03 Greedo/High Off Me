[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Don't need no drugs, I don't need no drugs
Don't need no drugs
I don't need to sip no lean
Captain Crunch presents

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I told her I don't need no drugs, don't need promethazine
'Cause lately I been high off her, now she get high off me
I told her I don't need no drugs, don't need promethazine
'Cause lately I been high off her, now she get high off me
She blow me like the weed, she sip me like the lean
She blow me like the weed, she sip me like the lean
She blow me like the weed, she sip me like the lean
She blow me like the weed, she sip me like the lean

[Verse 1: Yung Bans]
That's my lil freak, diamonds hittin' green, pink
One of one, the gang in this bitch with the Stinc Team
Shawty like the way I dress, she wanna drip like me
Broke nigga drinkin' Henny, I be sippin' lean, ayy
Fuck a lot of bitches, might do, ayy
Nigga couldn't walk in my shoes, ayy
Strike the fuckin' plug like Raichu, ayy
Like the pussy bald like Caillou

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I don't tell her the truth
She keep askin' if I'm sober, I can't tell her the truth
She keep askin' if it's over, I don't tell her the truth
I'm a real street nigga, smokin' dope in the booth

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
I told her I don't need no drugs, don't need promethazine
'Cause lately I been high off her, now she get high off me
I told her I don't need no drugs, don't need promethazine
'Cause lately I been high off her, now she get high off me
She blow me like the weed, she sip me like the lean
She blow me like the weed, she sip me like the lean
She blow me like the weed, she sip me like the lean
She blow me like the weed, she sip me like the lean
