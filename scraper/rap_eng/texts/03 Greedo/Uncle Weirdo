[Intro: Ralfy the Plug]
I'm tired of these nerd ass niggas boostin' for the Gram
Man these nigga uncle weirdo, straight weirdo ass niggas, dweebs

[Chorus: Ralfy the Plug]
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit, ain't tryna hear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
He had a blower but he bust out of fear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit, ain't tryna hear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
He had a blower but he bust out of fear though, uncle weirdo

[Verse 1: Ralfy the Plug]
Man these niggas uncle weirdo
Talkin' that tough shit but I ain't tryna hear it though
Niggas trippin', opposition come up missin' though
I ain't worried 'bout these lames, I keep a pistol on me
And for these niggas tryna beef we got shells for 'em
But we ain't worried 'bout these lames, ain't gon' kill nothin'
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Call of Duty on the block, you know we got them sticks on us
I see you hatin' but you know we got your bitch on us
Trollin', the homie up in the function lookin' pitiful
Boy here's a napkin, clean your face, wipe those kids off you
Don't tryna flex the Stinc Team ain't been had dough

[Chorus: Ralfy the Plug]
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit, ain't tryna hear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
He had a blower but he bust out of fear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit, ain't tryna hear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
He had a blower but he bust out of fear though, uncle weirdo

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Auntie you're dealing with some weirdos
03, my first name ain't zero
All my plugs do be higher than a Lear though
Plus he bustin' those xannies like Cheerios
If you mad at breakfast baby I'm about material
Online shoppin' with bopper while she cheer me on
But she don't get nothin'
Bustin' with me in the field 'cause we told on a nigga
Purple fountain like Shaquille
Straight to down, 304, she had no
You was just a bro, had your trust all in your ho
Don't confess it off the blow
On the xan, not your man, made you leave, you a ho, I'm gone

[Chorus: Ralfy the Plug]
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit, ain't tryna hear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
He had a blower but he bust out of fear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit, ain't tryna hear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
He had a blower but he bust out of fear though, uncle weirdo

[Verse 3: ALLBLACK]
Yesterday I ran across this crazy ass page
Hips buyin' pussy, tricks on Snapchat, and hoes runnin' fades
A couple friends and famous rappers gettin' stripped on the blade
I even caught her Armenian goals tryna bust a few dates
The username was 304, sixteens, and weirdo
Shit looked worse than Red Eye when he got socked by Debo
Auntie sheriff sat me down and gave me the cheat codes
I was like Shaq, dunkin' on niggas but couldn't shoot free throws
Never went fed against the grain, show stopped ways
Ngigas will sacrifice they mama for a little bit of change
Never trust a nigga who run a pussy before he run plays
Never trust a nigga who choose Ruffles over Original Lays
Ralfy and 03 runnin' plays with 22NDWAYS

[Chorus: Ralfy the Plug]
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Niggas boostin', ain't finna take shit from me
Chopsticks with mopsticks will knock down your big homie
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit, ain't tryna hear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
He had a blower but he bust out of fear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit, ain't tryna hear though
Uncle weirdo, man these niggas uncle weirdos
He had a blower but he bust out of fear though, uncle weirdo
