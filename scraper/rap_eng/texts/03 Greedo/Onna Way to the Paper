[Intro: 03 Greedo]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Please stop buggin' me baby
I be on the way to the paper
I got that blower on my hip like a pager
I'm on my tip, I might flip like a skater
Fuck around and sell a brick to your neighbor
I made my bitch serve shit like a waiter
I run my motherfuckin' city like the mayor
Hitstick with the grip, keep it player

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
Call me Greedy 'cause I came in with the flavor
Whip it, whip it like a slave, I'm a baker
House nigga in the kitchen with the white folks
I got high and start to think this was Jamaica
Smoke a nigga, send him off to meet his maker
Whole team wearin' purple like the Lakers
Lonzo the way I ball, step your game up
Gonzo, long nose make you wake up, chopper for the shake up
I was in the Bay, smokin' K with the gangsters
Crack in the streets, we from where the earthquakes was
Tell these pussy rappers stop playin', I'ma pull up
If they keep on buggin', nigga we don't have to play tough
We don't even play fair either, you can get sprayed up
I am not a sniper, but I'm quick to hold that K up
I got all this fuckin' dribble like a fuckin' lay-up
I'ma get the key and get some pussy then we lay up

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Please stop buggin' me baby
I'm on my way to the paper
Got that blower on my hip like a pager
I'm on my tip, I might flip like a skater
Fuck around and sell a brick to your neighbor
I made my bitch serve shit like a waiter
I run my motherfuckin' city like the mayor
Hitstick with the grip, keep it player

[Verse 2: Yhung T.O.]
Please stop buggin' me baby
I'm off these drugs, my mind crazy
All this shit I been through is what made me
This Glock on my hip just for safety
I can't let these niggas faze me
I will not stop 'til I'm Jay-Z
Oh, and my wifey Beyonc√©
We send your bitch on a blind date
I was in LA totin' straps with the gangsters
Ferragamo cuffs, used to be on the ankle
Free all of my niggas out the cell, give 'em anger
Smokin' all this dope 'til my chest feelin' strangled
I can't rewind with you
Wish I wouldn't've waste time with you
I got my love from my moms
But I got my pain from you
All the shit that you do

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
Please stop buggin' me baby
I'm on my way to the paper
Got that blower on my hip like a pager
I'm on my tip, I might flip like a skater
Fuck around and sell a brick to your neighbor
I made my bitch serve shit like a waiter
I run my motherfuckin' city like the mayor
Hitstick with the grip, keep it player
