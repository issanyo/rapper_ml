[Intro]
Yeah
You lil bitch ass niggas steady speaking up on the low
If these project walls could talk
They'll be just like 03, you dig?
03

[Chorus]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Verse 1]
I remember robbin' Paisas every other Friday
I remember money house, I'm selling out of molly
I remember in Atlanta talking pounds at Follies
I remember laying down bullets in my body
If you know you finna fold then get the fuck from by me
If you ain't finna hold it down then you can't be my crimey
Greedy get the guap and play the game but keep it grimey
I've been shot by who I love and told on by my family
I've been double crossed and bird fed
One time they sucker punched a nigga
Yeah they knocked me out like Ronda Rousey
Blindside you with this bullet if you come around me
Seen you at this party, was gon' hit you, you was fucking outie

[Chorus]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Verse 2]
Sim-simmer, who got the keys to the Beamer?
Who put that lean in two liters?
Dreadlocks like Beanie Man, I'ma red beam you
Hit your white whip up, you know I'm gon' cream you
Act in Lime-A-Rito's, it's no Lime-A-Rita
Really sell killos and plugged in with migos
My dog Dark Jack, he stretch just like a regal
We get thumbs up when we ride past your people

[Chorus]
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

[Outro]
And we do it for Lil Money, yeah
Long live Lil Money, oh
Money changes everything
I could never give a bitch a wedding ring, ooh, yeah
Rest in peace to all my niggas
GIP to all my killers, woo
