[Intro]
They got you feelin' that under, hah
I cannot fall off
You know what I'm sayin', I don't even want to make a lot of words to this hook 'cause I just want them to know
I cannot fall off
Man I just want them to be screamin' that shit in crowds
Then I won't fall off, for real
Gren8 Beats, Faded

[Chorus]
I cannot fall off, walkin' on a tightrope but I stay fly
I cannot fall off, a nigga had it hard so I had to stay high
Yeah, I cannot fall off, bet I won't fall off, fall off, ayy
I cannot fall off, bet I won't fall off
I cannot fall off (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, 03)
I cannot fall off (no, no, no, no, no, no)
Bet I won't fall off, bet I won't fall off
Bet I won't fall off, bet I won't fall off

[Verse 1]
Bet I won't fall off
I'm at work, bitch I can't call off, no days off
Gettin' money all day (all day)
Got that money in my drawer, ayy ayy ayy (damn I'm gettin' paid off)
I got money in the bank (I got money in the bank)
I got that money in the safe (I got money in the safe)
But it's at my safehouse (but it's at my safehouse)
Where the niggas stay 'round (where the niggas stay 'round)
I came out the projects (out the projects)
Had the unit by the fuckin' playground (First 48)
I ain't never play off (free 300)
I'm the realest thing 'round (out the cage)
Bitch I do it for my hood, hey hey hey hey hey (ayy ayy)
Do it for the Jordan Downs (bitch you know I bang Grape)
Where we stay don't rape
Chessboard really with me right now (how a nigga get paid)
Came from LA (ayy ayy)
But a nigga loved it in the A-Town (ayy)
Bet I can't fall off (bet I can't fall off)
'Cause a nigga goin' up right now ('cause a nigga goin' up)

[Chorus]
I cannot fall off, walkin' on a tightrope but I stay fly
I cannot fall off, a nigga had it hard so I had to stay high
Yeah, I cannot fall off, bet I won't fall off, fall off, ayy
I cannot fall off, bet I won't fall off
I had to not fall off (ayy, ayy)
I cannot fall off (I swear to God, you know what I'm sayin', I'm feelin' like Money, ayy)
Bet I won't fall off, ayy, ayy, I guarantee, yeah
Bet I won't fall off, bitch you can see it, ayy

[Verse 2]
I hate a bitch who get loud
Calm down 'cause a nigga stressed out
I hope a nigga beat trial
I can't love you 'cause I know that bitch foul
You ain't holdin' niggas down
You the type to make a nigga look down
Walkin' 'round with a frown
Now he tryna sell another pound

[Chorus]
I cannot fall off, walkin' on a tightrope but I stay fly
I cannot fall off, a nigga had it hard so I had to stay high
Yeah, I cannot fall off, bet I won't fall off, fall off, ayy
I cannot fall off, bet I won't fall off
I cannot fall off (ayy, ayy)
I cannot fall off (I swear to God, you know what I'm sayin', I'm feelin' like Money, ayy)
Bet I won't fall off, ayy (know I put that on my mama I'm not gon' fall off, ayy)
Bet I won't fall off (I'm countin' every dollar you feel me, every motherfuckin' dollar, ayy)

[Chorus]
I cannot fall off, walkin' on a tightrope but I stay fly
I cannot fall off, a nigga had it hard so I had to stay high
Yeah, I cannot fall off, bet I won't fall off, fall off, ayy
I cannot fall off, bet I won't fall off
I cannot fall off (ayy, ayy)
I cannot fall off (I swear to God, you know what I'm sayin', I'm feelin' like Money, ayy)
Bet I won't fall off, ayy (know I put that on my mama I'm not gon' fall off, ayy)
Bet I won't fall off (I'm countin' every dollar you feel me, every motherfuckin' dollar, ayy)
