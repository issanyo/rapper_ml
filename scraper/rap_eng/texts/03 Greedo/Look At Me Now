[Intro]
Ah-hah
You know I always wanted to be a six figure nigga

[Chorus]
Look at me now bitch, look at me now bitch, ayy ayy
You know I'm stylin', you know I'm stylin', ayy ayy
Castaway, got away, made it out the island, ayy ayy
Mafia, mafia, like a damn Italian, ayy ayy
Look at me now bitch, look at me now bitch, ayy ayy
You know I'm stylin', you know I'm stylin', ayy ayy
Look at me, look at me know, look at me, look at me know
Look at me, look at me know, look at me, look at me know, ayy ayy

[Verse]
Niggas been jackin' my style, bitches been diggin' my towel
Goin' up like Juntao, goin' up like Juntao
Baby I'm mafia boss, and I never been a boss
But a nigga been in Houston, I ain't comin' with excuses
Bitch I'm with the distribution, I ain't really selling music
All my niggas going stupid, I'ma stay away from cupid
All you niggas is some losers, lil nigga I'm winnin'
This is only the beginnin', and these niggas acting friendly
Niggas usually hate, and I never had a date
I ain't never wore Bape, Valentinos, goin' to see the migos
And I got a kilo, and I, ayy
Haven't ever really been a hero, baby I don't play
Thought I fell off of the beat, baby ran up with the heat
Baby I came out the street, baby you know I'm a beast
Whoa whoa whoa
Baby do it good, cook cook cook
Fresh up out the kitchen, hmm
Fresh up out the kitchen, ayy ayy ayy, ayy
Get up out my mentions, ayy ayy, ooh, ohh
Did not gon' forget it, ayy ayy ayy, ayy
I remember, I remember, ayy ayy ayy
A year ago I lost my nigga, ayy ayy

[Chorus]
Look at me now bitch, look at me now bitch, ayy ayy
You know I'm stylin', you know I'm stylin', ayy ayy
You know I'm violent, I am fresh out bitch, ayy ayy
Look at me now bitch, look at me now bitch, ayy ayy
I got a million, fuck all your thousands, ayy ayy
We in the building, baby we wildin', ayy ayy
I got a million, fuck all your thousands, ayy ayy
We in the building, baby we wildin'
Look at me, look at me know

[Outro]
