[Intro]
I've been meditating with the money
Prayin' for the paper
Focused on the funds (TrePounds)

[Chorus]
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
I done always kept that shit one hundred
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
But I done always kept that shit one hundred
One hundred, one hundred
I done always kept that shit one hundred

[Verse 1]
Hundred miles they runnin'
Offer me a run and all, your girlfriend got to runnin'
You gon' probably hear me 'fore you see me comin'
Turn a bitch to Stevie Wonder, I was pushin' keys
Go hard and I black on the street
Put the crack in the streets
Heard fake make it shake, yeah I had to get the cheese
I'm a wolf, you are lookin' like it's something to eat
Gotta feed me like the eagles, scream every week
If I went down when we was deep
Would you come down and still be freaky?
All that phone sex left her leakin'
This call keep on beepin'
And she can't see why that phone keep hanging up for no reason

[Chorus]
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
I done always kept that shit one hundred
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
But I done always kept that shit one hundred
One hundred, one hundred
I done always kept that shit one hundred

[Verse 2]
Focused on the funds, loading up my drum
Probably ain't nothing but the crumbs, I been counting up the hundreds
Type of money bought her everything she wanted
Now their hair braided like their name was Pocahontas
She tryna chase me like an animal she huntin'
Every time I pull up, she start gunning, oh
She shoot it down like it's nothing
I was counting up blue hundreds
I ain't never change, stackin' up the paper
I could never change, I ain't never been no hater
Always been one hundred, I was everything she wanted, oh
She don't want a broke boy, she need a nigga getting hundreds

[Chorus]
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
I done always kept that shit one hundred
I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
But I done always kept that shit one hundred
One hundred, one hundred
I done always kept that shit one hundred
