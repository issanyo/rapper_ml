[Intro]
For my dawg
For my dawg

What's a man best friend, his fuckin' dog
I need a hottie out the Bricks to blow my dirty draws
I'm winnin' now before, I took another loss
I just found out that my lil cousin just got shot
I just called the doc today, he asked me where I shop
I just heard my nigga Gravedigger took a shot
You better put your kids inside, somebody gon' get popped
I'm goin' through a lot, feel like we all we got
I made it to the top, before I got the guap
I made it out the lot, I got it out the pot
Lowkey at the spot, finally made it off the block
I made it out the brick, fresh out on the parking lot

[Chorus]
For my dawg
For my dawg
For my dawg
For my dawg

[Verse 2]
For my niggas that would kill a nigga
Tommy but no Hilfiger
Tom Ford, no Eddie Bauer
Backwoods are full of power
I made it out the twin towers
9-11, know the way for us
Tellin' people they should wait for us
Tellin' people they should pray for us
It ain't never too much weight for us
Enemigo, it ain't never too much hate for us
Came up off of noodles, it ain't too much on our plate for us
Niggas hatin', shit it must be too much grape for 'em

[Outro]
For my dawg
For my dawg, yeah
For my dawg
For my dawg
For my dawg
