[Intro]
All my hoes is different flavors
X load it up
Different Flavors
Distant, distant, dis', different flavors, woo
X on the beat, make it boom

[Chorus]
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Get her pregnant, I told that ho to have my baby
She going crazy, she screaming like that bitch in labor
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Keep it player, I like my hoes in different flavor, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Every time I hit, I just can't lie, I had to taste it

[Verse 1]
Ooh, different flavors, bitch I got a different flavor
I don't save her, I don't think that I can save her
But I love her, I can't lie, I know I love her
She get the money, you know I love to get the money
Ain't acting funny, that bitch ain't never acting funny
She hit the bully, a bully on a fuckin' bully
The boulevard, she'll never pull my card
I go too hard, I fuck around and break your heart
I get the car, I get the cars, that's push to start
I don't drive far, purple with the tan guts
PBJ fresh out the jar, drippin' like I'm Messy Marv
Get the bag and make 'em starve, she recognize she with a star

[Chorus]
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Get her pregnant, I told that ho to have my baby
She going crazy, she screaming like that bitch in labor
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Keep it player, I like my hoes in different flavor, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Every time I hit, I just can't lie, I had to taste it

[Verse 2]
She got flavor, more flavor than a 'frigerator
Brand new freezer, I'm way too cold to ever taste her
Ain't no hatin', told that bitch I'm not no hater
I put the blocks inside the plastic like vanilla wafers
I get the paper out the package, never graduated
And I be out here serving niggas like a fuckin' waiter
I got too much on my plate, she got too much of the cake, ayy ayy
I got too much on my plate, she got too much of the cake, ayy ayy

[Chorus]
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Get her pregnant, I told that ho to have my baby
She going crazy, she screaming like that bitch in labor
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors, ayy
Keep it player, I like my hoes in different flavor, ayy
Different flavors, I like my hoes in different flavors
Every time I hit, I just can't lie, I had to taste it, ooh

[Outro]
I had to taste
Different, different, a different, a different flavor
Ayy, ah-ayy, a different, ayy, ayy, ayy
I had to taste her, ooh, damn, goddamn, goddamn
Ayy, ayy, ayy, a different flavor
