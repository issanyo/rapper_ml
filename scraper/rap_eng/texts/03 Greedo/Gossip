[Intro]
03, ooh, ooh, ooh
03, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ooh ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Chorus]
Nowadays only niggas gossip
When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'

[Verse 1]
Brand new Guccis, wore 'em twice, I had to break 'em in
My lil hottie wanna fight, you tryna take him in
Your lil nigga mad at us 'cause we been fakin' friends
I make your niggas, make a hater want to make amends
I might freestyle this whole album 'cause I hate the pen
I put that beef shit in the hood so I could bait 'em in
I'm from the area with the LA Rams and Raiders fans
I'm in the field and I been makin' plays and makin' plans
Fuck a rumor, prove it to us, bro you act like you the shooter
Fuck all of them questions in the section, ho why you ain't do it?
Took some L's, I'm on the run, lil heard 'em walk inside the trap
Lost my lil brother and my burner, still had time for music
And I'm on these pussy niggas' ass every time I do it
Niggas tried to leave me out for dead, I ain't fuckin' stupid
Dirty project nigga, I don't want my dreads done
Talkin' 'bout a nigga but these niggas get they nails done

[Chorus]
Uh, nowadays only niggas gossip
When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'
Nowadays only niggas gossip
When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'

[Verse 2]
Still ain't lyin' in my raps, foot on these niggas' necks
We told you pull up in the hood, you still ain't show up yet
Why a nigga bitch ain't really 'bout the disrespect
You tried to tell a nigga sorry, people don't forget
Let's be real, you ain't a nigga been about the trap
Still ain't did shit 'bout who chased you down with a strap
When I pull up you get missin' nigga, that's a fact
I hear them stories, you can flip 'em like an acrobat
First of all this fakin' 'bout some shit you overheard
That really ain't your business 'til you put in on the bird
Second off your really never made it off the curb
Everybody know my business now, I keep my word
Third of all I never marked down in my fuckin' life
Most of all I would never fuck a lame wife
Buying drugs when I took money, music saved my life
I made this album just to bust on niggas I don't like

[Chorus]
Nowadays only niggas gossip
When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'
Nowadays only niggas gossip
When I pull up on these niggas niggas switch the topic
I heard all these pussy niggas talkin'
I ain't never seen you get it poppin'

[Outro]
What body? what body? what body?
Nigga you's a nobody, ayy ayy
What body? ayy ayy, what body? ooh ooh
Nigga you's a nobody, ayy
