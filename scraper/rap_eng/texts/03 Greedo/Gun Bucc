[Intro]
This nigga think
I ain't even gotta shoot a nigga, you get pistol whipped
And I don't even do the pistol shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't know if you understand, but umm
New, new, new, new, new chopper, new chopper

[Chorus]
New chopper every show that I get
I could kill a nigga with the backend
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy ayy
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend, ayy ayy

[Verse 1]
I'ma fuck around and hit you in the lip
This a drum, I don't do extended clips
Heard you niggas still talk a lot of shit
Give a fuck about a nigga or his bitch
I'll shoot a nigga up and hit the whip
Only time I ain't gon' shoot is 'round some kids
And a nigga found out where your mama live
We dropped your daughter off so she could babysit, that's crazy
Mmm, better watch your lady
Yeah, 'cause a nigga gang banging
Peter roll bangin', baby loc crip
You know you're gone, I can't baby no bitch
Play your role 'cause I'm tryna get rich
Get the dough, better get it out a trick, yeah

[Chorus]
New chopper every show that I get
I could kill a nigga with the backend
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy ayy
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend, ayy ayy

[Verse 2]
I'm just playin', I'm just playin' with my dollars
Fuck around and bought a Glock and a revolver
And I bought another chopper
Bought a draco just so I can stop you
When you pull up to my spot
I got a pistol when you pull up on the block
When I'm out of town, bet you get rocked
You don't know, I hit you with the red dot
I can even hit a nigga without
I'ma show a pussy nigga what I'm 'bout
You ain't never fought life one time
All a nigga thinkin' 'bout is doin' crime
It's over, that's how I feel
At times that's how I feel
It's over, that's how I feel
Sometimes that's how I feel
That's why I had to kill
You ain't felt how I feel

[Chorus]
New chopper every show that I get
I could kill a nigga with the backend
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy ayy
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip, ayy
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend
This a chopper, I can't do the pistol whip
Gun buck you just for thinkin' we pretend, ayy ayy
