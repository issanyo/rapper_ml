[Verse 1: Prozak]
Our lives are all about chances and circumstances
And hopes that it will advance us
Maybe one day we can have the answers
What is life, what is death and what comes after that?
And why do they call life a gift if it gets taken back
So contradictive our existence to be specific
The need to be prolific
Superseeds our goal of coexistence
It's kind of ironic fueled by grief of valued possessions
And in the end we decompose back to nothing, its senseless
You'd figure by now we would get it, leave it, cease and desist it
With every instance exhibit ignorance with persistence
Would our creator take credit creating all of us?
Or would our God rather just refrain and remain anonymous?

[Hook x2]
To tired to move on, too far to turn back
To late to right wrongs, you better move fast
Proverbial sands fall through the hourglass
As time becomes our emphasis nemesis as the hours pass

[Verse 2: Prozak]
We're looking for the savior
All alone we roam in the land of the haters
Everybody wanna raid us, rape us
Forsake us, tame us, man it's so heinous
Acts of aggression, blasting the weapon
Hey let me ask you a question, will a lack of affection
Dissipate, eliminate, obliviate all in reflection
Sink back to obscurity straight to the bottom of the depths
In this mess of all purity
As our insecurities
Surely, purposely gotta stop prematurily
Ain't Nowhere to go but cast down bellow
When the flames burn high and your heart has froze cold
Never really thought about the path you chose
Left to die in misery alone
You gotta make a change while you can
Because time is flying and it waits for no man
Keep sole control of your whole life span
And it holds the roll of Psalms in it's right hand
Try to make amends make it right with friends
Make use of the time you spend
And never look back at the past again
Can you get your soul back,well it just depends

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Prozak]
Everything as we know it is merely perception
Even time the adventure of life synthetic invention
There are those that wander in search of direction
Aimlessly seeking divine intervention
Perhaps one day,they will make the most profound connection
That what matters most in this world is our intention
Born into a specific place in mankind
Positive or negative energy
The only thing we leave behind

[Hook]
