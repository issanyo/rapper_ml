Chorus
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places,worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
The tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

Verse 1
It started in a nice suburban home with white picket fences
This was the a life of a little princess
Such a happy girl with pigtails and curls
Such a bright future when daddy gave her the world
She got a Benz on her sweet sixteen the most popular
Nominated the high school queen and her father was being quite nice
I mean not like a father's love, more like something else it seems
I know it bothers her wishing she could wake from this dream
I know it's haunting her nobody was there to hear her scream
What has her father done she wishes she was eighteen
So she can up and run as far away as she can be cause

Chorus

Verse 2
She met a guy and his name was Jack
He served 12 weeks in basic training now he's off to Iraq
She holds her breath and counts the days till he flies back
But he never will cause Jack has died in combat
Her hope it seems her broken dreams now filled the body bag
And in return for his life she gets a folded flag
With some dog tags, but man it's so sad
The fact Jack will never have a chance to be a dad
She broke down when she heard this
Knowing that money's the only purpose for Jack joining the service
And now she is nervous her kid is crying and the bills are piling in
She keeps a smile on the surface

Chorus

Verse 3
American princess is now a queen
But without a king
Her weary eyes has seen a lot of things
Not always plesent but the future brings
A former shell of herself
She is on the streets now she is doing things
Drugs and alcohol can only help to ease the pain
But it seems like nothing in this life can hide her shame
Walking in the rain, and man it's so strange
She is thinking to herself how the hell the world changed
A car pulls up along the curb side another customer
It's time to get inside
She demands to get her money before she goes farther
The man turns his face, it was her own father

Chorus
