[Intro: Prozak & Random people]
Thank you and enjoy the movie, next
Oh yeah two for the Tales From The Sick, please
Tales from the sick huh? Ok, that'll be 17$ even, please
And can I get a large popcorn too?
Sure
Do you want anything?
No, I'm fine, thanks
Right here you go
Enjoy your show, next
Oh this place is packed
Oh ok there's two seats right here
Oh, cool
I heard this guy is kinda rapper or something
Yeah I think so

[Krizz Kaliko & Random people]
Warning the following film contains graphic images
Grotesque violence and strong sexual content
(they're locking the doors?)
This film also contains disturbing the trails of ourselves
And society as a whole
Which may, in fact, leave you with severe sense
Of hopelessness and despair
Please refrain from hurting yourselves or others
During the agonizing reappraisal
Of your tortured and corporate all fragile human existence
Now we present to you "Tales from the sick"

[Hook x2]
(Now who are you) I'm the Alfred Hitchcock of hip hop
(No you're not) Don't believe me, just wait 'til my shit drops
(Thought you knew) Tell sick stories with a suspense plot
(Come and watch) Even Edgar Allen Poe would say my shit's hot

[Verse 1]
Hello ladies and gentlemen and good evening
You're about to witness the sickest thing ever breathing
There's no need to keep pinching yourself, you ain't dreaming
Someone, please shut that bitch up in the back who's screaming
Some people will tell you I'm half angel, plus demon
Who's purpose is to stalk the earth for gothic reasons
Must've cursed at birth for what it's worth, they pulled a heathen
I think them the stigmata, so my hands are bleeding
The devil sends his regards and seasons greetings
For those who don't believe in God, he'll be meeting
Your life will cease, so rest in peace, your soul is leaving
For eternity, burning, begging and pleading

[Hook]
