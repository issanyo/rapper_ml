[Verse 1]
I tried to hold my own, safe face, maintain
The only light in my tunnel is this freight train
Moving at the speed of karma, it's insane
One minute you're on top, next you're in flames
Burn like embers on this solitude
What happened to the yes men that surrounded you?
What happened to loyalty, respect and gratitude?
Vultures, when they thought you had something they surrounded you
Mortal of vampires, drain you of your own well beings
Stepping on necks on the quest to become king
Cutthroats, turncoats, manifest like dope fiends
Insult to injury, choke with their own heart strings
Enemies of the worst kind, souls black like shoeshine
Nature of the hater, perpetrator, they consume time
666 metaphorically their true sign
Trust me, you will see them and receive them all in due time
Enemies

[Hook x2]
I can't take this, no more
This is my life, not yours
So what the fuck are you hatin for?
I must be something you can't ignore

[Verse 2]
I keep on pursuing the pseudonym as if
The real person in Prozak are congruent as in there’s 2 of them
Connected at the souls, symbolic the black hole
The secretly seeking dominance, ominous control
Nowhere to turn next, thoughts are out of context
Life is out of focus and I'm hopin to survive this
Depression, lost my way, no direction
Well under midst of career resurrection
Shed a tear for my form of reflection
You fell victim in the battlefield of deception
Well on the quest to keep it real, he been steppin
Through the landmines of his own mind’s invention
Wolves in sheep's clothing, deceitful screen smoking
Evil is omnipotent, it's all-seeing, all-knowing
Keep your eyes open for bad signs and omens
Or get fed to the lions like ancient times of Romans
For real though

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Like a jack of all trades and a king with no subjects
Renegade to the game, I'm looking 'round like what's next
Been through it all, man from stolen ideas
The shady record label's tryna put bullets through my career
And even some of my peers, who weren't as they appeared
Back stabbing faggot rappers who hold themselves dear
But it stops here
I’m on top, I’m back again, it's a new year
For the focus and dedication, I'm your worst fear
To see me shining and grinding
Through the core of the storm and it's on, I keep lightning
I'mma keep writing, keep performing and keep fighting
Keep spiting, you industry whores, while crowd hyping

[Hook x2]
