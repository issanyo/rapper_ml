[Intro: Prozak]
As the sun sets
Silhouetting the treason buildings that surround you
Shadows are born
Taking on a life all of their own
The black void of these shadows can either provide you
With serenity and peace or consume you with fear sorrow and despair
Welcome to the realm of those who live in reverse of the natural cycle
Those who hide amongst the day-walkers
Those damned as nocturnal
