[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
Even though the world's around me
I feel lonely like I'm the only one
Even though the world has found me
It can drown me, it feels just like nothing
Even though the world's around me
I feel lonely like I'm the only one
Even though the world has found me
It can drown me, it feels just like nothing

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Maybe there's a reason I feel I'm the only one
I walk amongst 7 billion understood by none
A lost soul walking down the cross-roads
Searching for some sanctury, some peace of mind just to grab hold
Man overboard in the darkest sea of reality
Desperately trying to keep himself from sinking
And he's frantically panicing, there's no sign of land
Can he manage to be that man that can handle this damage and get back up on his feet again?
'Cause somewhere deep inside his abdomen he feels the burn and purpose to defeat these inner demons that seem to submerge him
That always seem to surface and cause a diversion that swerves him to crash and burn on his course to destiny's purpose

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
Even though the world's around me
I feel lonely like I'm the only one
Even though the world has found me
It can drown me, it feels just like nothing

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Maybe it's too late now, I see the sky has faded
No turning back, no second chance and that's an understatement
My only friend is my reflection and he's dissipatin'
Into these endless days of disarray I'm contemplatin'
Where did I go wrong? Try to hold on -- be strong
Hard to feel that home when there's no place for me to belong
I guess it's back to packin' down these back roads
With a black hole inside my chest that used to hold a soul

[Bridge: Prozak]
Maybe when it's all done I can finally realize
Why I felt alone through this journey of my life
And everything will finally make sense to me one day
But until then I wish I could make this go away

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
Even though the world's around me
I feel lonely like I'm the only one
Even though the world has found me
It can drown me, it feels just like nothing

Ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

Even though the world's around me
I feel lonely like I'm the only one
Even though the world has found me
It can drown me, it feels just like nothing
Even though the world's around me
I feel lonely like I'm the only one
Even though the world has found me
It can drown me, it feels just like nothing
