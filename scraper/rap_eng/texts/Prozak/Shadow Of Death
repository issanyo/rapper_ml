[Hook x2]
Half angel, half devil
Half man, half beast
Half love, half hate
Half war, half peace
You’d better pray to God and hope that He will walk beside you
Cause in your darkest hour the reaper is sure to find you

[Verse 1: Prozak]
I never asked for it
Chosen to be the chosen one to gather souls of those
Chosen to become post-mortem
To live or damn eternal fates of the wrong
Either embrace by heaven’s fate, or enslaved by Satan’s throne
I’ve gone by many names, pronounced with screams of pain
I’ve walked through valleys of dark
And embarked through hells flames
Such a shame that in the end I am all you have left
Now draw your last breath, hello, my name is death
The only thing that’s certain
I guarantee to each and every person
Here through the curtains and I’ll be there lurkin
A predator with man
I’m forced to enforce the course of nature
Provided by omnipotent plans
These hands are so callous, from years of such malice
Sir fear is thy power, sever but must balance
Adhere to my talent, some here you must vanish
Time for one’s loved one to drink from thy chalice

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prozak]
It never seizes to amaze me
Witness them screaming and carry on when I come for their babies
Or mothers, fathers, brothers, daughters
Husbands, wives, uncles, slaughter
I just do what I’m supposed to
But yet you feel the need to bleed
When you see my shadow’s amongst you
You pray for forgiveness, perhaps a second chance
I do not speak your language, why must you even ask
Your body fills with Paralysis
Your eyes open wide, and pupils dilate with self-analysis
So just relax and let it go
Let the wings of fate delegate responsibility of your souls
And it’s over now, your soul has reached it's destination
And it’s funny how you’re at the gates of hell
But yet your body’s underground
And deafening silence always seems to be the only sound
As you’re descending down

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ye though I walk through the valley of a shadow of death
Thou shalt fear no evil, for Thou are with me
Thy rod and Thy staff - shalt comfort me
