[Intro: Prozak]
When two people come together
They often intertwine their identities and become one
But what happens when one of them removes themselves from the situation
Leaving the other lost unable to move on
Forever existing in the past like a ghost roaming the endless corridor of memories
Each day becoming more transparent, until finally, they’re erased

[Hook: Prozak]
Can someone tell me how to continue
When I can’t seem to function
Barely making it on the day to day
It’s like, my heart and soul has been ripped out of my body
Involuntarily laid out; put on display
I thought you were my love you were my life, you were my everything
I cannot sleep I cannot think I can’t do anything
And you, you barely even recognise my face
You moved on I’m in the same place
I’m erased

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Never thought of a, life outside of ya
Now it’s all I think about, this ain't even possible
How can we remain apart our love was unstoppable
We’re like the same person so connected psychological
Always think the same things same hope same dreams
Shared love shared pain supposed to share a last name
Tell me how can I explain life will never be the same
All I’ve had all I’ve known I'm watching going up in flames

[Pre-hook 1: Prozak]
Is it me or is it you who is the one to blame
And how can I move on when half of me has ripped away
I put my life into the words that you would always say
You said together forever how does forever change?

[Hook: Prozak]
Can someone tell me how to continue
When I can’t seem to function
Barely making it on the day to day
It’s like, my heart and soul has been ripped out of my body
Involuntarily laid out; put on display
I thought you were my love you were my life, you were my everything
I cannot sleep I cannot think I can’t do anything
And you, you barely even recognise my face
You moved on I’m in the same place
I’m erased

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Does this even phase ya? I use to think you was perfect
Like heavens angels mad that, nothing's further from the truth
All you are is danger, deep inside your souls
A black box chamber full of pain containing a stranger
You took away the only thing that made me whole
An empty shell remaining with a broken soul
Damaged goods with no reason to care no more
Everything I thought I had I’m watching walking out the door

[Pre-hook 2: Prozak]
Can someone try and help me please? I don’t know where to go
I feel my life is closing in I’m ‘bout to lose control
I’m at the end of the rope and I’m ‘bout to hang below
Never thought you’d be the end of me sending me overboard

[Hook: Prozak]
Can someone tell me how to continue
When I can’t seem to function
Barely making it on the day to day
It’s like, my heart and soul has been ripped out of my body
Involuntarily laid out; put on display
I thought you were my love you were my life, you were my everything
I cannot sleep I cannot think I can’t do anything
And you, you barely even recognise my face
You moved on I’m in the same place
I’m erased

[Bridge: Mackenzie Nicole]
Darling, I am not the one for you and you are not the one for me
And that I know is true
I know you can find someone that can truly make you happy
And whether you realize it, it is true
Darling like I said I would I don't remember how we were
But that was then and I need something new
I must stay true to my identity and I cannot be myself
Whenever I am with you

[Hook: Prozak]
Can someone tell me how to continue
When I can’t seem to function
Barely making it on the day to day
It’s like, my heart and soul has been ripped out of my body
Involuntarily laid out; put on display
I thought you were my love you were my life, you were my everything
I cannot sleep I cannot think I can’t do anything
And you, you barely even recognise my face
You moved on I’m in the same place
I’m erased
