Little too late now they be trying to take all that evil back
Got a feeling this is the season to reap a harvest
And karma always snaps harder when it's coming from your own hand
Hit you like a fist knocks your soul down in quick sand
Here we go, animals are dying by the thousands and
This fool, we're starting to plan on building subsidized housing
Overpopulation is breaking the same as crime and
Decreasing of our supplies
Global warming climb and rising
Tell me where do we go when nothing's left
Nowhere to run such a mess
Nowhere to hide such a distress
Poisonous air takes your breath
GMOs watch it grow
Corporation cash flow
What's the goal I don't know
Mind control I suppose

[Hook]
They gotta go, nowhere to turn
And the sky turns black and the fires burn
And the oceans flood and overturns
Nowhere, nowhere to run

[Prozak]
Sea levels rising
Peace sells, who's buyin'
Prison cells full volume
Chemtrails, who's flyin'
Infidel stealthbombers NSA Al Qaeda
NRA ricochet bombs away wild fires
Terrorism airliners TSA soul bias
Phone taps drone attacks
Politicians all liars
Look on the bright side
But wait which side is brighter
They been looking awful dark to me I don't know which is lighter
Closed eyes, closed minds no one seems to mind that
We're running out of time
Last call we're checking out and
From where I'm sitting hard to say
We don't deserve it and
I'm not preaching, I'm just as guilty as you man
Nobody is perfect

[Hook]

[Prozak]
Let's change the ending, preventing this whole impending doom and
Stop ourselves from descending right into our eternal tombs and
Quit consuming everything and save a little room
For future generations yet to come so they don't run on fumes and
Leave behind some guidance instead of just violence
All we gotta do is reach inside of us and then we'll surely find it
Love understanding intelligence all irrelevant
The ever mystic continue the world's development

[Hook]
