[Hook]
We just, hurt each other
We're destroying each other
And we are just fading away
Soon there will be no place to go
Reach the end of all we know
With small minds we can not grow
We are just fading away

[Verse 1]
Its kinda funny when you think about it
The fact that we're all in this
Together
But yet we still complain about it
Separated by race, or religion
Or the income that what makes me come to basis
On whether or not to embrace them
We got to stop with the hatin'
For heaven's sake we're mistakin'
With all
This blatant shameful acts of abomination
These trials and tribulation should be the education
To make sure history doesn't
Repeat itself with these mistakes again
To put it in laymen
We're just some homosapiens inhabitan'
The same planet
And having to maintain within
Maybe we could work together
To make this
Place better for future generations
The Children
Someday they may never experience
Hunger and famine
Disease and planet contaminants
Extinction level damage
Leaving them stranded and ravished
Submerged in sabotage from these centuries of habits
Like thieves in the Night stole their future
Before they could even have it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man its so volatile how we're falling like dominos
Just drowning in our own sorrows no thought of what tomorrow holds
And these seeds of misery are sproutin'
You can clearly see you and me have been deceived and its astounding
How we all journey through life
Conflicted with all the strife
Afflicted with all these lies
Tryin' to simply survive
Hoping our souls will suffice
Just need to open our eyes
And see the devils disguise
Or sadly meet our demise
And I know it seems impossible
To topple these obstacles
And things ain't always what they appear to be inside the optical
Illusion of human ruin that you and me is pursuin'
So cruel and unusually worded and congruent with influence
To destroy and deceive us all
Place our back against the wall
Bringin' ourselves to a crawl
Dwell on each and every floor
Is it to true to recall?
And we not even evolved?
Is there to much to resolve?
Now we all, now we all fall

[Hook]x3
We just, hurt each other
We're destroying each other
And we are just fading away
Soon there will be no place to go
Reach the end of all we know
With small minds we can not grow
We are just fading away
