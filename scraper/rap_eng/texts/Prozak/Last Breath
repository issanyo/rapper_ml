[Verse 1: Prozak]
Just relax and let it go
Let your heart beat fade away to the sounds of my syllables
Incredible how immeasurable death is innevitable
Mind body and soul inseperable
Until the valley of the shadow of death
Your last request is a plead of help, screamin from your last breathe
Judgement day from all those things in the past
We told you life was self inflicted how long you thought it would last?
Huh, now them demon's screamin out your name
Walkin parallel the universe's is in the rain
It's a shame that it's come to this, listen to the snake hiss
Try my friend but you can't run from this
Heaven or hell's flames or purgatory
You're at the crossroads now what's your story
Nevermind man that's none of my business
This is between you and death with life as your witness

[Verse 2: Prozak
So what becomes of what becomes us
Witness the dark shadows walk amongst us while the darkness still corrupts us
Pain and anguish and dispair
The flames of hell will flicker in the eyes of the demons as they take you there
Torche's light the way through the tunnels
The ground crunches with bones as blood drips in puddles
It's kind of suddle, how death embalms you
And cardiac arrest will calm you as the cemetary calls for you
Back on earth your body's laid upon this metal table
Your spirit watches from above, time to end the fable
Embalming fluid is your life's blood
A box made from wood you would cry if you could
But you can't now, stiff with rigamortis ain't no comin back now
Time stopped to put you back down
Another journey through the darkness of the shadows
Another body on the pile, prepare for battle!
