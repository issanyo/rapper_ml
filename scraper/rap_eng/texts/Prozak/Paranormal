[Intro: Prozak]
Much like wind, blowing through hallowed cemetery grounds
We all circulate within this void of reality, in search of something more profound
Hopes and dreams fuel our will to live, projecting our desires into the universe
And awaiting what it gives
Throughout life's journey you will encounter saints as well as the heartless
But remember, in order to appreciate the light, one must spend time
In darkness
