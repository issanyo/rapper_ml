[Verse 1]
They cultivate your fear
To keep you in the cage
Manifactured media to keep you entertained
The story of your life
Every day remains the same
Go to work
Like a slave
Every day
Then you die!
Expression has been lost
So put your dreams on hold
And never think for self
Do exactly what you're told
When they control your mind
Then they control you flesh
Go to work
Like a slave
Every day
Then you die!

[Hook]
Tell me what is real (nothing!)
Tell me what is real (nothing!)
Perception (Everything)
Deception (Every day)
Perception (All you know)
Deception (Do what you're told)
Perception (Hypnotized)
Deception (Mesmerized)
Perception (I telesized)
Deception (Now feel the lies)
Tell me what is real (nothing!)
Tell me what is real (nothing!)

[Verse 2]
Where ever lies the truth
Amongst this world of lies
Misdirection provided to keep you occupied
And if you change the channels
You will surely change their minds
Go to work
Like a slave
Every day
Then you die!
History's condemned to always repeat itself
You must predict the future from the past to save yourself
Don't be another victim, that you're even hollow shell
Go to work
Like a slave
Every day
Then you die!

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I can't seem to figure it out
I can't seem to get it right
I can't seem to figure it out
I can't seem to get it right
I can't seem to figure it out
I can't seem to get it right
I can't seem to figure it out
I can't seem to get it right
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right

Perception (Everything)
Deception (Every day)
Perception (All you know)
Deception (Do what you're told)
Perception (Hypnotized)
Deception (Mesmerized)
Perception (I telesized)
Deception (Now think alike)
