[Intro: MissNissa]
Despite what everyone is saying
Time hasn't made anything any easier
In fact: I think it hurts worse every single day
Everything around me is a constant reminder of him
Of us
As I write these words, I wonder if any of you
Can truly understand what this feels like

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Everything you do, I'm right there
Please wake me from this nightmare
You can't seem to see me but I'm right here
Transparent, in the night air
Afraid to walk in the light
And so I stay here and watch you at night
Try to hold dear everything in our life
If I thought I had more time I would've made you my wife
But I never seen it coming it was so fast
Tried to hold on, but I couldn't last
As I laid dying, everything flashed
All our hopes and dreams are now passed
I'm still beside you, but you can't see
I know you want it back, but it can't be
I'm afraid the darkness now has me
Just try to move on and be happy

[Hook: MissNissa]
Maybe I will see you a-gain
Just know that I love you
Always thinking of you
Ever since you went away
Nothing much to live for
Close my eyes and wish for
Just to have you one more day
Nothing is the same now
All I feel is pain now
I will never be the same
Always have the same frown
All I do is break down
Every time I hear your name

[Interlude: MissNissa]
I know how this must sound
But I know he's still here with me
At first I pretended as if I didn't notice
I thought that the grief was playing tricks on my mind
I would see him while passing the mirrors in our home
And hear him calling at night

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Sometimes you look right in my eyes
When you stare off into space and cry
For a second I feel so alive
But the it, sets in that I'm nothing besides
A ghost, my God is empty I wish I was set free
Afraid to leave, she will forget me
I scream in vain
I speak her name
It's so hard when I see her in pain
There's nothing I can do to comfort her
And death itself couldn't take my love for her
Nothing is left for judgement that must occur
And everything else is becoming such a blur
Fading away and everything turns dark
Going away to a place so far
Leaving you now, we must be apart
But I'll go on living in your heart

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MissNissa]
It's been some time now since he called me
I fear that he's grown tired of waiting
Counting the days of this mortal life seems almost unbearable anymore
Some say that Heaven is in the eye of the beholder
There is nothing I would want more in this world, or the next
Than to be with him
If he has refused to move on
To stay stuck between worlds just to remain here by my side
I owe this to him
Please try to understand
I love you very much
And tell Dad that I love him
We will all be together again soon enough
And never have To lose each other again
Goodbye for now, but remember eternity is forever

*Gunshot*
