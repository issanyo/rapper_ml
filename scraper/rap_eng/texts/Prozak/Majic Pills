[Verse 1]
When I was five, they took me to a place with padded walls
They introduced me to these pills that would become my all
Forced me to wash my hands so many times it turned them raw
I've stared at pictures full of vacant, tell what I saw
They were so nice they gave me cookies, milk and lemonade
Always rewarding me for the sick and twisted things I'd say
My daddy had insurance so I was a privileged child
I got more pills than any other kid around for miles

[Hook]
Everything's fine
Thanks to my new majic... Pills
Works every time
Thanks to my new majic... Pills
It helps my smile
Thanks to my new majic... Pills
Sun always shines
Thanks to my new majic... Pills
Pills... Pills...

[Verse 2]
Kept flashing images to try to see what makes me tick
Thought I was healthy but thank God they had discovered this
Sundays they use electric currents, though it makes me sick
So please don't cry mother, they promised blue cross covers it
I'll be the child you've always wanted, soon I swear I can
With more prescriptions in my system I can be a man
Always a problem child, genetically been led astray
Another magic pill to make my symptoms go away

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Told me that I had too much ambition for my own good
Keep him sedated, segregated, yes I think we should
There must be something wrong, we'll have to monitor his health
He must be craz; he demands the right to think for self
That's not the proper way to live in this society
You must obey, only existing to acquire thee
Don't worry son, with medication you will become well
Be just like me, your father's son
A corporate lifeless shell

[Hook]
