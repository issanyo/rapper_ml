[Verse 1: Prozak]
This all began as I woke up one day
I was cold and alone and the whole world slipped away
I realized that I'm hollow, an empty shell
I heard things in Heaven, but many things in Hell
I'm so oblivious to life on the outside
My soul is a prison and my mind is the confines
There's no escape, no one to desecrate
Heart and soul segregate while inner demons congregate

[Hook x2]
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Everyone's terrified when the darkness comes
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Close your eyes and rest in peace when it's all done

[Verse 2]
I see mindless souls with blank stares
Reflecting from mirrors but nothing compares
Nothing will brace you, nothing prepares
For all the pain that might be out there
Life is but a dream, no it's a nightmare
Voices that scream and I cannot bare
Desensitize me until I do not care
Pulling on my soul they rip and they tear!

[Hook x2]

I'm trapped in Hell, can't wake from this dream
Hair standing up, see my breath as I scream
Tears roll down my face in the stream
I pray for repentance to peace be redeemed
And I know this cannot replace all the hate inside me
I would take my life but would that set me free?
Go away, just please let me be!
Eternity, I cannot rest in peace

[Hook x3]
