[Verse 1:]
It's been a decade now I've mastered my craft
Slick quick and sharp as a tac stick like the axe in your back
Perhaps I'm strapped with a gat but best to step the fuck back
Three hundred pounds of the tatts
Prepared to step the face flat
I'm the reason heathens quit breathing by bleeding from lesions
Leading these demons through killing seasons and leave them grieving
No need in proceeding your begging and pleading
Only appeasing my appeasing for blood, I stop when Hell is freezing
The Hitchcock of hip hop, the darkest shit on the block
These haters hate it cause their bitches I jock
I got it on lock, dropped like these empty shells from a Glock
I quick to blow up your spot and watch your corpse as it rots

[Hook:]
Going to Hell and they wanna blame me
And your children were pale now they wanna name me
Wanna put me in jail cause I know they hate me
I'm tired I'm tired sick of bullshit
When your life's at an end and you're going crazy
And violence is a trend cause it's what they made me
I'm tired I'm tired sick of bullshit
I'm tired I'm tired sick of bullshit

[Verse 2:]
They try to blame me for school shootings
Disputing freedom of speech, they're saying their minds we are polluting
But what happened to people being responsible for things they did?
Red Lake that reservation yo fuck that kid
This shit ain't suitable for weak minds
Explicit lyrics and deep rhymes, just relax and it will be fine
No need to shoot up your school, no need to act a fool
No need to drown the neighbor bitch inside your swimming pool
No need to slit your wrists to be noticed
But if you must remain focused, slit horizontal and then quote this
I am a bitch, I am so weak, I cannot take this life
It ainâ€™t my fault I killed myself, in fact I blame this knife

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Sometimes I can't stand it, anti-the-whole-planet
I wish that I could vanish, I know I take for granted
But can you blame me for feeling I'm going crazy
In this world where it is legal to kill a baby inside a lady?
And even worse now this gay shit is a trend
Emo faggots wearing girl panter huh where does it end?
But you're telling me to keep an open mind, shit my mind is open
I think your jaw might (be broken) from the dicks you've been be smokin'
And can anybody tell me what the fuck a metro-sexual is?
And what religion's got these preachers out here touching kids?
Never mind I don't think that it was meant for me to know this
We're going straight to Hell as if you didn't notice

[Hook:]
