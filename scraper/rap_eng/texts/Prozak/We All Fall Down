Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
When we all fall down
Na na na
Na na na
When we all fall down

[Verse 1]
I feel like ever single second's the same
It's sort of like suffocating under the reigns of satan's chainss
That maintain, it's a damn shame how we all fall
Like rain drops on brick walls and simply fade away
Into the memories of yesterday
And when there's no one left to remember the human race shall cast away
Inside this vast abyss of disarray
Instantly viciously and in a moment's notice become history
And while this anxiety is piling high in me
I am screaming in silence on the outside disguising as calmly
Contemplating the irony why would He
Create a race so violently refusing to reside in harmony
Constantly cussing clamaty, greed and vanity
Proceed into deceive each other and destroy humanity
Savage mechanical ravaging families scandalizes
Cussing these agonies while planing these mass catastrophes

[Bridge]
Wanna be somebody someday somehow someway
Some pray we can make it to a better day
We got to save face change fate embrace change brake chains
Try to turn the page before it's too late

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Headed for rock bottom as the clock's counting
Descending like stocks and bonds, falling like leaves in autumn
We are brought up products by the heartless for economical harvest
Illuminati remain an anonymous block of the economics the end is upon us
I promise just looking for silence
Some comfort to something to help occupy these final hours
A temporary sabotical from these animals
That chew us and consume us like rapid ravaging cannibals
Mechanical mammals with amo wearing camo their mind is so narrow
Death and destruction is the only scenario
Straight to the burial bombs are dropping form areas
Their motivations are the only compensation of materials
And this planet we've attacked with our habits
Is in the saddest state from falling from grace since we've inhabited
Such a disgrace we became a race that's complacent
Ungrateful, and wasteful and hateful shameful savages

[Bridge]
Wanna be somebody someday somehow someway
Some pray we can make it to a better day
We got to save face change fate embrace change brake chains
Try to turn the page before it's too late

[Hook]
