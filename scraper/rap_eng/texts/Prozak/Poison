[Intro]
I know if you love something, let it go
If it comes back to you, it's yours
Chances are it won't come back to you
And if it does, do yourself a favor and let it go yourself

[Hook]
Poison it's what you are to me
Yeah, I said poison
This prison is unpleasent and I wanna be free
Why sould I have to pay?
Cause you don't like the way I am today

[Verse 1: Prozak]
I know it's fucked up how I treat ya
Tellin' your mom I used to beat ya
Mistreat ya, and how I used to leave ya
Alone home by the phone crying in pain
Stuttering and flinching every time you have to speak my name
Pamphlets about domestic violence
And how you lived this life of pain and misery and anguish and silence
It seems I can't explain my actions, and in my absence
You have to see your family's horrified reactions
Cause uh, I know they'd lock me up if they could
Makin excuses for me like a trooper girl just like you should
Shattered dreams and expectations
Starin out the window with teary eyes, a broken will and lacerations

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prozak]
When we first got together you said that you respected me
Knowning about my fucked up childhood but you still accepted me
We took it to that level but sometimes I swear
It's like I'm posessed with the devil
And these differences that cannot be settled
Only time we fuck it's out of spite and hatred
Lookin at me like you wish you could kill me, that bond is sacred!
See I was fucked from the get go... raised like a pit bull
Mental abuse, pain and anguish... things I can't let go
All I can do in this life is bring you down
Things were much better for you until the day I came around, huh
Fuck it... I can't take this pain no more
Pistol in my mouth, dead body on the floor!
