[Intro]
You know it's funny…
Every time you get to the last song on your album
It kinda makes you wonder like
What if this WAS your last song?
And if it was, then what would you say?

[Verse 1]
I close my eyes, but it won’t go away
Am I a passenger aboard this life
Or am I just a stowaway?
Sometimes I feel my soul’s a throw away;
Inside is so cold and grey
Just hope that I can cope and don’t explode today
Surrounded by these broken shards from the past
I sit and try to analyze these racing thoughts as they pass
Friends turn into foes
And foes turn into friends
It makes you wonder for what purpose we serve
All in the end we’re falling
And thus continues the cycle of our humanity
So hard to watch our dreams just dissipate into reality
So this goes out to those who feel like me
And refuse to walk the beaten path to fight for their own destiny

[Hook]
An alien inside my own skin;
No matter what I’ve tried to do in this life, I can’t fit in
I know there’s reasons for things and things for reasons
The black sheep: alone in this world since I’ve been breathing
(An alien)
Alien inside my own skin
No matter what I’ve tried to do in this life I can’t fit in
I know there’s reasons for things and things for reasons
The black sheep: alone in this world since I’ve been breathing
(An alien)

[Verse 2]
Some people say just keep on keeping on
Continue putting pens to papers, paying dues and keep on writing songs
I find no comfort in these words no more
I find no comfort that this world is obsessive with brutal acts of war
So keep your friends close man, enemies closer
Stay true to your fam and stay standin’ banded like soldiers
If ignorance is bliss, then silence is golden
They use misdirection to keep the public from knowing
Beware of Trojan horses, destructive and evil forces
Always think before you follow and contemplate who the source is
Of who stains to gain
Who stands to profit
Who shall bare the blame
Who’ll stand to stop it?
The laws of karma coming back again
Prozak Hitchcock. Outcast. They call me Alien

[Hook x2]
