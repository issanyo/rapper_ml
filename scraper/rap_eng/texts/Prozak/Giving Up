Sometimes it seems we're falling

[Hook: MissNissa]
When you feel like giving up (giving up)
When you feel enough's enough (enough's enough)
I'll be there to lift you up (to lift you up)
Always be there when your times give up

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Sometimes your souls is so heavy it drags you to the ground
You pray for better days like sunshine through black clouds
Sometimes it feels so lonely like you are the one and only person
I'm just hopin deep inside it leaves you facing cobe
Nowhere to turn to, nothing seems to concern you
Dwelling and yelling, person the names of people that burned you
You gotta learn to let it go
Negativity slowly slithers into your soul
To cause cancer and synergy
Your only given ammunition, the enemies
Homie trust me, I've been there and on it, it's like a deadly disease
A cat and mouse game, holding on your hawks true
Truth's that life has a funny way of making you feel mundane
But trust me it'll get better, always remember
It gets the darkest before dawn, friend try to keep your head up
Your future is bright but the right pair abide you will see
Even in the dark of night if you'd listen to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prozak]
So discouraging when problems are flourishing
Pursuing you at the same time, where is the nourishment?
When the wings are pulled, drag yourself up off the floor
You owe it to yourself to go for self to go to war
And take back what is yours
Break through barricades with rage like you're unstoppable
To accomplish on top of these off-road roadblocks and obstacles
You gotta get sick with this serendipity, stick with it
Like we're staring to the depths of the abyss
We're haters instruments
It's a void textual, manifestation cesspool
Entity of aggravated haters and all of others fools
Don't let it consumed you but groom you, penetrate through you
You'll be doomed to become what you hate
For heaven's sake I'm praying for you
I know you're stronger and better
Say never ever fall victim to false fiction
Then recall your life's mission uh
Stand with conviction, but perseverance ambition
And guided by intuition you will defy and surpass the friction

[Hook x2]

Sometimes it seems we're falling down
