[Hook]
It's no surprise now
Look at my eyes now
It's your demise now
Wake up you're dead!
It's on tonight bro
Two rivals will collide with assault rifles
Wake up you're dead!
This is the end game
No more pretending
Quick to remove your membrane
Wake up you're dead!
This was the last straw
And now it's last call
Fuck it, let the body's fall
Wake up you're dead!

[Verse 1: Prozak]
I can't explain it to you
This hate that's in my blood
It runs as cold as ice through my vain's and my thoughts just flood
They take over my mentals with such a profile, lack of sentimental
Blinded by rage I'm vengeful, revenge for the mentals
Logic right out the window
Maniac right from the get-go
So tight I grip this pistol
So no more innuendos
So if we going to do it
Lets get to doing this
Spilling fluids
Including each other in ancient sacrifice like druids
Trust me you don't want to do it
You don't want to get in to it
I speak murder mighty fluent
(Can't control myself man)
If i put my mind to it
I can stop your time from moving
Leave your life in fucking ruins
(Shaking's in my hands again)
The voices in my head are getting louder
And continue to tell me to bring a lamb to slaughter
(Trust me you don't want that)
Cause I might just snap and attack you
Snatch you and have you an what have you
Just to get it cracking
(With this baseball bat)

[Verse 2: Prozak]
We're some arch enemies
Like some superhero building comics
It seems our fate has brought us together homie we can't stop it
Survival of the fittest, prepare to finally finish
We're about to handle business
One on one leaving no witness
This hate submerges me
The urgency to hurt you see
Planning it perfectly
Disturbingly murder in the first degree
No amnesty savagely stabbithy cavitys
Causing a casualty casually
By causing me chaos and calamity
Every fiber in my being wants
To cease your heart from beating
Wants to stop your lungs from breathing
(I think I've lost my mind)
Don't let it be deceiving
My calm demeanor meaning i really want to leave you bleeding
(This rage has turned me blind)
And my aggression has turned in to quite an obsession
To teach you lessons with my weapons
(This is a battleground)
I won't feel vindicated
Til you are eliminated disintegrated on pavement
(put you right in to the ground)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prozak]
Seek and Destroy
Invite betrayal Deploy
Put him in holes
Bodies explode
Reload
Like a carnival cannibal
Red Dragon like Hannibal
This rage so animal
Why can't I get a handle bro
Lost in a state of psychosis
I can barely focus
Just go for the throat full force and choke
And hope that it closes
But just remember you provoked this
And woke this ferocious beast
So take notice its about to swarm on you like some locus
I'm called upon so full of rage
Now all I see is red
Enemy time you wake up
Mother fucker you're dead
