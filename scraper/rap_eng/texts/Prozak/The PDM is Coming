[Intro]
Oh shit... It begins... Right where it ends... Here it goes..

[Hook]
The PDM is coming! We got to take our places
Now everybody's got a case can't wait to see them faces
Signal your brainwash bullshit
Your fuckin lies is bullshit
It's time to take a look
We read your fake ass like a book. (PROZAK!)

[Verse 1]
PDM, tell me what does it mean?
Terrifying shit that'll make a motherfucker scream
Original and wicked, it's self inflicted
Best believe it self destruct when we spit it
In a minute, bout to run the game and it's a shame
Bitches getting rocks y'all for speakin our name in vain
Fuck the fame, PDM's about the glory
Fuck keepin it real, and fuck your life story
You pull us, walkin towards us
You just ignore us
Wishin to spit but your microphone's cordless
And hopeless, so disgusted when I wrote this
The underground is out of tune and out of focus
We're bringin it back to that level again
When motherfuckers played the part and was a rebel within
Yeah, fuck your momma takin two to the chin
Attack your ass like my name was Osama Bin

[Hook]
The PDM is coming! We got to take our places
Now everybody's got a case can't wait to see them faces
Signal your brainwash bullshit
Your fuckin lies is bullshit
It's time to take a look
We read your fake ass like a book. (Yeah! Motherfucker!)

[Verse 2]
Fresh out of life, but the devil's takin feds
Played with Ouija boards and knives when I was a kid
Skitzophrenic so my brain is always wavin
Cross between Steven King and West Craving
Your worst nightmare, we takin it right there
Project Deadman got you runnin like a bomb scare
Mission is the murder claw or the mitten
Call it what you what, wicked rhyme spittin
Body's float in the Great Lakes
Screamin, watch the dead wake
Watch the murder victims body shake
A homocide ain't no thang to us
Eject the seat, even cuz this shit is too dangerous
Go through your mind like a migrane
Have you screamin for your soul suicide on the night train
Crash and burn, explode, implode, reload
See you in hell as the story was told. (Goodbye.)

[Interlude]
The PDM is coming..
The PDM is coming..
The PDM is coming..
The PDM is coming..
The PDM is coming..
The PDM is coming..

The PDM is coming! We got to take our places
