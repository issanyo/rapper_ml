[Hook: Prozak] (x2)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking I'm high, thinking I'm high everyday

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Leaving a piece of me behind at everywhere I go
Reaching every state every city every single show
Life in the fast lane you never want to take it slow
You can’t enjoy the highs without taking all the lows
And that can be found at the bottom of a bottle
Of liquor or pills perhaps both at full throttle
The comforts of the road deceiving it’s all hollow
As you try to drink away all the pain with each swallow, and
Hoping that something will change, maybe tomorrow, then
I can try to get my head together maybe understand
Life out of a suitcase can be hard to handle man
Without your kids without your friends without your fam
Despite these lyrics I’m seriously not complaining
Destined in this world since birth to be an entertainer
The fans make it worth each and every step but later
The stage lights dissipate back to thinking about

[Hook: Prozak] (x2)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking I'm high, thinking I'm high everyday

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Strange faces in a foreign land
Suitcase full of acid while I tour again
Headlights cut the black night pouring in
Never been a nice guy never wore a grin
I’m just here squeezing blood out these oranges
Talking shit representing my origins
In a whisky hole tell ‘em Jim Morrison
Writing out the eye hovering over a toilet
And these spirits got me going in
But I ain't wasting my words and that’s a warning
Usually a heart ends, cracked like porcelain
Fuck around and get your whole mills spooned to portions
Sorry to bust a contortion
Unrattle every cage before a thought of your motion
See i'm a wild animal my psych’s been roasted
And all of y’all tamed under massive hypnosis
I'm just

[Hook: Prozak] (x2)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking I'm high, thinking I'm high everyday

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
I got a battle that’s brewing up in my brain
So many memories of things that I could just never change
But I shake it off cause it’s the stage that I must tame
Inside a cage where the fame ain't easy to gain
Simmerin’ in a cynical lane to maintain
For the people who get therapy from everything we say
Tech is dressing just to mash out problems
Pouring up another just to get smashed off them
Mama said these days I'm a stranger, not familiar
And Cheeky said it’s kinda like y'all are my new familia
Strange quotes from great folks trying to just stay close
On the road break coast pulling a space ghost
You need us to lead this great feeling into a Zenith
All the journeys are scenic, this high is so intravenous
So we just roll on, and break the night into the day
Thinking of my everything until everything just fade away

[Hook: Prozak] (x2)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking of my, thinking of my (life, life)
Thinking I'm high, thinking I'm high everyday
