[Verse 1]
You see, every day remains the same for me
I often wonder what it takes to just set me free
I stare into this dark abyss that I know is my life
No where to run, no where to hide, no way to cope or strife
And everything I see is gray, now the colors are gone
They slowly fade away into the lyrics of the song
Searching for sanctuary peace of mind, but somethings wrong
I lost myself along the way and its been far too long
Somebody tell me wheres my kindred spirit
(I try to transcend)
And all I catch is interference
(How will this all end?)
Hoping that someone can hear this
(Let pills dissolve in)
I think I'm finally thinking clearest
(just hope you feel this y'all!)

[Hook]
Things will never ever be the same again
I hope that you will understand the pain I was in
I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend
Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again
Things will never ever be the same again
I hope that you will understand the pain I was in
I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend
Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again

[Verse 2]
All apologies to people that I will leave behind
I can't explain the pain and rage that dwells inside of my mind
I feel I've lost the war inside my head that keeps me alive
And everything I've ever loved is gonna slowly subside
Into the darkest night you've ever seen
My soul is tainted, nothing clean
Some say that life is but a dream
But nightmares only come for me
So tell me where they go
With inner demons at my door
Their always fighting for control
And tryna be feeding off my soul
No longer know my ups from downs
No happiness, just only frowns
I'm always staring at the ground
Just hoping something comes around
And now my visions blurry surely
I'm fading fast and in a hurry
Maybe death could finally cure me
Never thought i'd leave this early

[Hook]
Things will never ever be the same again
I hope that you will understand the pain I was in
I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend
Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again
Things will never ever be the same again
I hope that you will understand the pain I was in
I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend
Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again

[Bridge]
(Same again)
(Pain I was in)
(Being a friend)
(Maybe I'll see you again)
I try to transcend
How will this all end?
Let pills dissolve in
Just hope you feel this y'all

[Hook]
Things will never ever be the same again
I hope that you will understand the pain I was in
I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend
Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again
Things will never ever be the same again
I hope that you will understand the pain I was in
I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend
Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again
