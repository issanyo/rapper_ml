[Verse 1: Prozak]
Living in these dark times, it’s hard to stop these dark rhymes
It seems that we have lost before we’ve even crossed the start line
Metaphor for human race what’s in store for heaven’s sakes
Watching ourselves dissipate and even worse participate
In our own demise think about it read between the lines
Damn we must be blind to see the signs we’re almost out of time
And reality might not always be what you might hope
Sometimes you’re really feeling like you’re walking across a tightrope
Above a sea of uncertainty and certainly it hurts worse to be
Coerced because of loss of freedom hurts worse than a third degree
Burn let the ashes fall yearn pick up the pieces y’all
Gotta learn to hear the call turn before you hit the wall
Sink or swim make it count
Trust your friends when in doubt
Make amends take a vow
Opposition take them out
Never let nothing get between you and your hope and your dreams
We’ve suffered long enough now it’s time they hear our screams

[Hook]
If we could start all over a million miles from here
Could we eliminate the hate inside and all our fears
Or would you keep it going our self-inflicted hell
We gotta reach for peace before history can repeat itself
(a Million miles from here,maybe we could start all over)
If we could start all over a million miles from here
Could we eliminate the hate inside and all our fears
Or would you keep it going our self-inflicted hell
We gotta reach for peace before history can repeat itself
(a Million miles from here,maybe we could start all over)

[Verse 2: Prozak]
We gotta do the math, find out the final score
I swear we’re knock knock knocking up on heaven’s door
And as the world turns we get closer to the fate
It really makes you wonder what’s the purpose what’s at stake
What are we meant to do besides living and breathing
Why must we try to live outside our means and stay daydreaming
Material things and money seem to be our obsession
And when it isn’t that it’s killing with billions spent on weapons
We gotta coexist which means we gotta focus this
Hope for utopian bliss despite our newfound hopelessness
Back then religious beliefs is what kept us separated
Now it’s the power struggle for financial domination
Sins of the father continue passed on to generations
Maybe one day we can unite as one a sovereign nation
Take for what it is but don’t take it for granted
And always suspect the unexpected on this unsuspecting planet

[Hook]
If we could start all over a million miles from here
Could we eliminate the hate inside and all our fears
Or would you keep it going our self-inflicted hell
We gotta reach for peace before history can repeat itself
(a Million miles from here,maybe we could start all over)
If we could start all over a million miles from here
Could we eliminate the hate inside and all our fears
Or would you keep it going our self-inflicted hell
We gotta reach for peace before history can repeat itself
(a Million miles from here,maybe we could start all over)
