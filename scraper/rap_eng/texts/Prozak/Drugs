[Verse 1]
Oxy cotton man that shit is rotten but uh
Crush em and snort em and all your problems are forgotten oow
20's 40's 80's addictive huh maybe my nose is bleedin and I keep
Itchin like I got rabies *snorting sound* just let it drain
Another synthetic pathetic method to submerge my inner pain
Blame my family friends who else it just depends
Just want it all to end I need to snort again
I need some more drugs like all six of them
Ill take these Vicodins hey you pass the clonopins
There bangin at the bathroom door but I can't let them in
Rigamortis pale blue on white porcelain

[Hook]
Oh we oh we oh drugs they take control
Oh we oh we oh drugs they own my soul
Oh we oh we oh drugs they take control
Oh we oh we oh drugs they own my soul

[Verse 2]
No where to even explain I couldn't think to refrain
My life could be summed up in one word COCAINE
I lick the end of the straw that I snorted through
When I'm through I rub my teeth with the residue
I'm always thinkin about the next line man I know I owe you 3 bills
Fuck it ill pay you next time
I gotta score some more no matter what the cost is
Man I can't even feel my face my nose is frost bitten
(im high as a kite)
Im havin complications
(i do this every night)
In self desecration
(i don't know wrong from right)
I can't resist temptation
(hold on it'll be alright)
Itâ€™s self annihilation

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Your teeth are grindin hard you cannot catch your breath
Your eyes are dilated welcome to crystal meth
Sleep depravation now intertwines with some chemicals
As a result a twisted realm of scenarios, paranoid
Hearin police scanners and radios the voices now speak to you in stereo
Seeing shadows around the corners of your eyeballs
To smoke the rest and hide in the closet till night fall
Midnight its time to make the escape jumped in the ride time to score
More you can't wait backing out the driveway but didn't look both ways
Another tweeker dead obituary page

[Hook]

[Outro]
They call my name
They are to blame
Needles in my vein
Here we go again [x2]
