[Verse]
All that I've seen, all that I've known
All is lost now, a world without hope
Nowhere left to run, nowhere left to go
Overpopulated, and yet were all alone
Global warming outside but were still cold
On the inside, our souls are froze
Grim future walking down this dead end road
Hard to cope when you've reached the end of the rope
Nothing left to do but hang in the balance now
Just above the poisoned soil and the toxic ground
Polluted oxygen's circles in your lungs while
The acid rain just drains from the black clouds
Scared and lost people gather into the streets and crowds
No longer civil thinking of survival somehow
Through this threat they are met with projectiles
The blood spills as the fire's burn for miles

Panic and destruction is all that's around
So you better hit the deck when the boot's hit the ground
Ashes to ashes we all fall down
Ashes to ashes we all fall down

Nothing will remain take a last look around
Not the screams of pain have replaced all the sound
Ashes to ashes we all fall down
Ashes to ashes we all fall down

The time has arrived, now watch it unfold
Everything in sight ignites and explodes
Don't believe the lie's you've been told
Don't believe the lie's you've been told
Endless days of night, no light to behold
Total loss of life we've lost all control

[Outro]
Don't believe the lie's you've been told [x18]
