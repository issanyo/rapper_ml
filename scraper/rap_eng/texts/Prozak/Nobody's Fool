[Verse 1: Prozak]
Don't even know you anymore, maybe I never did
Like I was living in a fantasy inside my head
I'm gettin' pissed and clenching my teeth and fists
Is this the end of us? Is this what this is?
A bottomless abyss of emptiness
I wish it'd never came down to this
But it did, I sit back reminisce
Of the times I was blind, hit rewind
To remind of the times I was out of my mind for you
The room is spinning, we were done from the beginning
Realize it's too late for pretending to have a happy ending
Where do we go wrong, nothing left to hold on
Everything's too far gone, shaking tryin' to stay calm
Thinking about of us got me thinking all about the repercussions
Of the structure, put my fist through walls
For heaven sake I'm afraid I forsake you
Just saying some days and some ways I fucking hate you

[Hook: Prozak]
Are you really thinking that you're foolin' anyone?
(With all that evil you've done)
Are you really thinking that you're foolin' everyone?
(With all the lies that you spawn)
Because of you we were already done
(Before we've even begun)
Because of you there was nowhere to run
(We're headed straight for the sun
Na na na na na na na
It goes on and on and on
Na na na na na na na
It goes on and on and on)

[Verse 2: Prozak]
The way you're making me thinking, it's like I'm lifeless
You're taking away my pride, my peace of mind is priceless
You're making me miserable with each and every interval
So cinical with syllables, I like you to consider though
Each and every single thing that I have done to you
But obviously that's not enough so now I'm thinking what to do
It's like a never ending cycle of immense pain
No quality of life and I think that I'm going insane
Wish I could forget you in the day that I've met you
And I pray for the better days and hey I'mma let you (Go!)
Can't relieve the pressure, just a breathe to an effort
To release compression of this misery I must forgo

[Hook: Prozak]
Are you really thinking that you're foolin' anyone?

Are you really thinking that you're foolin' everyone?
(With all the lies that you spawn)
Because of you we were already done
(Before we've even begun)
Because of you there was nowhere to run
(We're headed straight for the sun
Na na na na na na na
It goes on and on and on
Na na na na na na na
It goes on and on and on)
