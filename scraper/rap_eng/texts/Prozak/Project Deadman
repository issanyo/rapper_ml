PDM See the difference between us and them is we keep it underground and wicked
Something ya'll don't know nuthin about. All these groups I hear claming
Underground. How much you pay that f**kin DJ to spin that? MTV to play that?
That freestyle, how much for that? Hahahaa

(Prozak)
Goin insane my brain refrains from the pain of being lame
Ya'll should be a monopoly and not f**k with this rap game
It's a shame this industry's standards got ya'll tainted
But you're paraded and playded got you devastated and hated
So f**k it so sick of the mainstreams and fantasy pipe dreams
I'm sick of drama queens don't follow me or I'll let these demons outta me
With a vengeance it's a wicked evil presence
Now wanna pretend this ain't real like Vacil Prozak's ill
I'm talkin bout NyQuil don't wana drive? Well I will
Strait to hell all because you have to do what thou will
But I am not concerned I hope this lesson's learned
Sit on the edge of the industry dog and watch it burn

It's Project Deadman comin from the underground
Wicked is how we kick it arrested but never convicted
Your time has come this shit is goin down
Your whole life trying to find something real
We're Project Deadman and we're bringin that sound
We're from the murder glove bitch we got issues
We got the wicked shit we'll never let it down
Project Deadman more underground the hell

Crazy and ran that speaks on rap beats with rock guitars
Bizzare and yet ridiculous it's so maticulous
So sick with this we meditated my crimes ain't victimless
F**k how you feel f**k keepin it real F**k the mass appeal

Self inflicted. And that f**kin beat is how we ripped it. Also deadly to the
