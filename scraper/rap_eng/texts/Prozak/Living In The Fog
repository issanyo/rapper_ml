[Intro]
Prozak, Cypress Hill

[1 Verse:B-Real]
The first time I hit the weed was in fifth grade
Shit stayed in my head, I could recall it like it was yesterday
Hit the bong, fill the lungs, let it down, here it comes
Started coughing like a rookie
«Hold it in, you fucking pussy»
Yeah, that`s what they told me, homie
I was getting higher, homie
Started feeling paranoid, who these people?
They don`t know me
Why you looking at me funny
Like you wanna jack my money
Watching his body bleed, he wanted nothing from me
I started feeling euphoric
And then started to ignore it
Every hit took my mind off and absorbed it
My eyes wet, mind heavy, glazing up a smoke`s
Someone had an ounce of weed
I broke the whole thing
Waking up after
Apparent reason why a girl is asleep on sofa with a mouth open
Be careful what you are smoking
`Cause it can lay your ass out
They take advantage of you while your ass is passed out

[Hook]
For days living in a fog
And I want to get away beside the stars
As soon as you recognize, you better
And the moment you open your eyes it all seems bizarre
I get high, you get high, we get high
(We living in the fog)
I get high, you get high, we get high
(We living in the fog)

[2 Verse: Sen Dog]
I was just puppy when my homie offered to hit this (hit this, dawg)
It`s some pop shit that`s gonna get you lifted (get you lifted, dawg)
So very cautiously I put it to my lips (Yeah)
Hoping like a mofo I would not have a bad trip
Soon as I hit this shit my mind went dry (damn dry)
That shit made me feel so damn fly (damn fly-y-y!)
Walking down a street, young niggas laughing
Took another hit like a G, then I passed it
Me and my homies got so high off the weed
That we took off running and we hit up with a tree
Since that day I fell in love with Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
It`s the best for taking stress off the brain
A while ago took the Mexican Ces
Tried chocolate top but kush is the best
From day one I never stopped smoking herb
And ain`t never gonna stop, you heard?
That`s my word

[Hook]
For days living in a fog
And I want to get away beside the stars
As soon as you recognize, you better
And the moment you open your eyes it all seems bizarre
I get high, you get high, we get high
(We living in the fog)
I get high, you get high, we get high
(We living in the fog)

[3 Verse: Prozak]
One day I was smoking on some Mary-Mary
It was me and my homies at the cemetery
It was on Halloween and some shit got scary
See, I didn`t want to do it but my homies dared me (I dare you)
There was a spot where this couple was buried
Rumor has it that they died on the day they got married (Got married)
It was their anniversary 10 years ago
Shivers down my spine, here we go (let`s go)
Blunted out, I wondered out into the fog
I am hearing footsteps and a howling from the straight dog
Shit, I`m about to take off, this weed got me paranoid
Panorama is horrible when you see things you can`t avoid (Oh, my God)
I turned around and started running back
I heard the car started up and my homies giggle, what the fuck they laughing at?

[Talking: Prozak]
Hey, hey, get back here! Motherfucker! Hey! This ain`t funny!

[Hook]
For days living in a fog
And I want to get away beside the stars
As soon as you recognize, you better
And the moment you open your eyes it all seems bizarre
I get high, you get high, we get high
(We living in the fog)
I get high, you get high, we get high
(We living in the fog)
