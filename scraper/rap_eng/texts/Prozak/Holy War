[Intro]
War is a big business (x6)
And tax payers are paying at the pumps

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Global tensions running wild
Bodies float across the Nile
Anthrax sold in vials
Oil wells burns for miles
How many troops are going in
Fighting this war that we can't win
Hey mister president
There's oil dripping down your chin
It began in 91 I watched blood and fuel drip
20,000 people are dead now its enough to make you sick
How many souls can you rip
Take your pick
When the guns click
Lies spewing from the lips
Of bureaucratic hypocrites
Holy war, holy shit
The Quran crucifix
Drop them bombs, watch them hit
Genocide up in the mix
Soldier boy, so fragile, so narrow
Now the price of your blood is measured in barrels

[Hook: Prozak]
God damn
Uncle Sam's gotta plan
With that rifle in his hand man
Its a holy war
The holy land
Is the new Vietnam
Bodies burning in the sand damn
Another holy war

[Interlude x8: Prozak]
What are we fighting for

[Verse 2: Mike E. Clark]
I see our freedoms over here get taken everyday
Seems like our world can't handle what the fuck we got to say
Where things are going fake gods, seeds are growing, confusing the people
To debate and switch all in the name of hell
Put us to war, you make us kill, all in the name of God
But worry about an unborn fetus, I think that's fuckin odd
Can't understand how people still use religion
To justify all their evils, you fuck, we got a holy war

[Hook ]

[Bridge: Prozak]
Visions of violence
Blood equals economics
As our nations standing catatonic
(Give us a holy war)
Give us our daily product
Dictator sits on his throne
His paper the skull and bones
Evacuate, the war's over
(Another holy war)
And bring our soldiers home

[Verse 3: Prozak]
What is false what is real
You can't think, but you can feel
Wounded on the battlefield
Your sacrifice for mass appeal
Propaganda's on the news
The public doesn't have a clue
Now think of what you're going through
Your freedom don't belong to you
The world is coming to an end
The devil's got an evil grin
He's televised on CNN
And everybody's tuning in
Dog tags
Watch em drag
Body bags
Burnin' flags
The truth hurts
When it stabs another victim on the slab

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
War is a big business (x8)
(Its a holy war, another holy war)
And the tax payers are the customers
