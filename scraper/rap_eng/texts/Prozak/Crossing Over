[Prayer | Psalm 23:1-4]
"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;
He leadeth me beside the still waters
He restoreth my soul;
He leadeth me into the paths of righteousness for His name's sake
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me;
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."

[Verse 1]
I can't believe this is you
After everything we've gone through just look at you and what you've been reduced to
Artificial life, a respirator they've been working on you all night
It's in the paper how you tried to take yourself out
A bottle of pills and when they found you you were passed out
I wonder still as you died did you have doubts
When they revived you-you were screaming with your hands out
Straight from hell express route
I see you lying in this bed now
With machines and I.V.'s, God please, just wanna rip them out
But I can't cause if I do, you will die
Damn it's hard to stand beside you as I see you and your family cry

[Hook x2]
Don't know where we go
When this life spins out of control
When it gets dark and it turns cold
And you're feelin' like don't nobody know
And you're all alone

[Verse 2]
Now your body's shaking
I can see the demons over in the corner waiting
Salivating, waiting for you to crossover
The threshold of mortality and death's border
Close my eyes and hold your hand now it's getting colder
Knew you were upset, depressed and somewhat bi-polar
I tried to warn you but as usual you wouldn't listen
Your face is pale your bodies numb and now your tears glisten
On a mission to self-destruct but now you're wishing
For the regret and blind hope and false intuition
You try and try to hold on, but there's nothin' left
Knowin' each and everyone could be ya last breath
That takes you to your final rest

[Hook x2]
Don't know where we go
When this life spins out of control
When it gets dark and it turns cold
And you're feelin' like don't nobody know
And you're all alone

[Verse 3]
Time to pull the plug
Administer The last rites, words, and final hugs
You feel the tears drip on you and you feel a tug
And for the very first time, you finally feelin' love
It's too late, comatose and catatonic state
Surprised and your eyes wide, as you fulfill your fate
Eternally damned and dropped off in front of Hell's gates
Your mind, body, and soul shall now disintegrate as all the demons celebrate

Goodbye
