[Intro]
Motherfuck you
Straight up fuck you
Double fuck you
Bitch fuck you

[Verse 1]
I want this anthem for those who can't find em
For them industry [?] who don't know talent from [?]
Becoming obvious that they've been plotting on us
Tryna stop us from accomplishing profiting dollars that are ours
We underground man, we do it ten times harder
Hella shows, payin' dues we true to life artist
Hustle mentality with confidence to [?]
Straight to the top, defy gravity to reach furthest
It's in my blood like a deadly venomous element
And I've accapted it look into my eyes it's evident
Each and every sentences further to rappin' instead
I've been earnin', deservin' every single chance that I get
And I can't help it if you're hatin' homie
Let me tell you this:
I'm one of the hardest rap artists to lyrics when I spit
My work ethic is set on to everybody admits
So if you're talkin' shit on me then you can suck on my dick bitch

[Hook]
(Fuck you!) To major labels and their whole stuff
(Bitch fuck you!) To the radio, kiss my ass
(Motherfuck you!) To the people doubting my craft
(Straight up you!) For thinkin' you can witness me crashed
(Double fuck you!) To the haters off in the past
(I'm like fuck you!) Sneaky little snakes in the grass
(Never trust you!) Prayin' that I'm comin' in last
Carefull throwin' all them rocks when you're livin' in glass

[Verse 2]
The heart of an artits is often the hardest to damage
So careless from being rubbish' (?) is shape shifts to granted
All you want is to be heard to strike a nerve
Despite the obstacles that are spiting you with each and every curve
It's a paradox a literal pandora's box
You often give up everything, regardless if they care or not
And they being all them people in charts
CEO's, major labels sittin', watchin' you starve
They're turning ringtone rappers in the national stars
And makes you mad as hell, smashin' knuckles to scars
While billboard keeps on grindin' for them phonies at large
Is got crawling in your skin while they're claiming them charts
And it's never been about the talent
It's all about the who'se paying and who will management
Cause who you are is who you know and that is adamant
To be successful and relevent, that's the end of it
Fuck em I say "to hell with it"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Strictly independent, gorilla hustle underground rap phantom menace
I never backdown and I'm back on with the vengence
The snake and bat has got my back with each and every sentence
I keep on grindin' and rhymin' it right every second
Supplying divine lines from my ol' mic, check it
You look suprised to find em alive but I'm not stressin'
I won't comply to your lies and can't try pride agression
And did I mention? It's all karma and it's right from the wine
Sorta like Mike Tyson I fight night
I'm hyped till I fight for mine
The truth hurts like a knife, like a spike in the spine
And thanks to the talking, you for helping me shine

[Hook]
