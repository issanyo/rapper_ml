[Verse 1]
This can is slick
Man he thinks I didn't notice
My girlfriend's on her cellphone texting
It's all envocus now
Supposed to be my best friend in 7 years
And now I think about it all week long
My bitch was acting weird
My first impulse to the kill 'em right now
Chop his body into pieces and place 'em in hollowed ground
Fuck it, I'll get 'em at the same time
Someone's suspecting
They'll never ever see this coming
The dots connecting
Had to head home and get ready
Got work at 5 o'clock
Man I hope she isn't there, cause boy I swear to God
I don't know if I can restrain
This anger that's in my brain
This hatred is pumping faster than nitrosolvent in my veins
I gotta chill, relax, try to keep it cool
Cause revenge is best revolved when you have 'em play the rules
Drive home and grab my uniform and gave her a smirk and said
"I love you baby girl and I will see you when I'm home from work"

[Hook x2]
Fear
Panic
Betrayel
Nervous
Careful what you find when you dig below the surface
You might lose you mind from the pain that it brings
And who can you trust when life ain't what it seems?

[Verse 2]
Left the crib, the first stop hit up a liquor store
I grabbed a fifth of Jack and a pack of smokes
Like tunnel vision I kept driving in the days
Can't believe I'm just finding out, huh
Today of all days
This can't be real I'm getting sick to my stomach
The more I think, the more I drink, shit I think I'mma vomit
Retaliation's on my mind, everything's getting scary
Just to think, just to spring we was gonna get married
Damn I know this must sound crazy but I think that I still love her
And can't be what it seems man that dude is like my brother
Maybe I should just head home, have it out and just confront her
With no communication, we could just misread each other
This anxiety's inside of me is a bottomless pit
It's idol be defiling me and now the bottom line is this
I gotta man up, stand up to get to the bottom of this
And speaking of bottoms I might as well be downing this fifth

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Driving through the neighborhood, now it won't be long
Turn up the radio and I'll be damned, they're playing our song
So serendipidous, this can't be just coincidence
Somewhere we lost our innocence, tonight we will rekindle this
So ridiculous to think she could betray me
My first love, my first kiss, the mother of my baby
Maybe I'm just insecure of our relationship
I'm pulling up the block, what the fuck is this?
My homeboy's car is parked in front my house
They must have seen my pulling up and now they turn the lights out
I popped the trunk, grabbed my pistol, vision's in my head
I cocked the hammer back, yeah and all I seen was red

[Outro: Prozak & Jamie Madrox]
Bitch
Fucking whore
I've shoulda kill this bitch
'Sup you fucking bitch
Die you fucking whore!
Die!
What the motherfuck did you do?
It was supposed to be your surprise birthday party!
Oh I'm sorry!
