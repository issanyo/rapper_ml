[Verse 1]
Looking back I never really had a chance
Alien misguided outcast
Haunted from the ghost of my past
Soul is broke, but my body intact
Deep inside I was catatonic
Traumatised from the childhood violence
Never really thought about the effect on this
Life that I'm living I'm just being honest
Thinking about it all makes me nauseous
So pissed off, can't stop this process
Misery, my life's synopsis
Set me free, I cannot stop this
I don't really know where to go from here
But one thing is crystal clear
Any chance of a normal life disappeared
But the pain gave me this here career so

[Bridge]
I don't know if I should love you or hate you for
Making me this way
But I just want to thank you for
The gift of insane

[Pre-Hook]
(Now)
I'm thinking about it all, I'm forsaken
(You)
Made me this way, I'm your creation

[Hook]
I'm alienated
And everything inside of me that's ever been good
Has all been stripped away from
And never to return and I'm trapped here in this isolation
Like a prison in my body that I can't escape from this devastation
On top of my stress so I'll never truly be free
And everything inside of me's grey
People tryna look at what they can't understand
So I just push 'em away
Ashamed to admit it, I'm not capable of feeling the same
Do you know what it's like to live life locked inside a cage?
Thinking about all of this I don't want to be free
(Here in my life I'm drowning, lost inside)
(Here in my mind I'm dying all the time)

[Verse 2]
Living this life disconnected
Pretend to make friends, but no connection
Isolation without affection, but my two sons are the one exception
Spitting images of my reflection
Without the darkness and imperfection
The light they shine is my direction
Their existence is my redemption
A second chance to right the wrongs of this life that I led
When I'm dead and gone maybe I will live on
Like the lyrics of a song that nobody's ever heard, feel me?
Just fade away, finally embrace this vacant space
The endless grave without a trace
Back to the place from which I came

[Bridge 2]
But for now all remains the same
No matter what I do
And we both know who is to blame
And all you put me through

[Pre-Hook + Hook]
