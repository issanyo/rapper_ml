[Verse 1]
People tell me that I never really smile maybe
If they knew me ever since I was a child they'd be
Understanding the reason for my withdrawal lately
It's been worse than it has in a long while
You see my brain just thinks a lot
Often lost in thought
Often spaced I just cannot
Seem to get it together been losing my patience a lot
Hope for the better whatever anything to make it stop
If you're feeling like me then you'll understand
And if you don't I apologize in advance
But on the other hand
I don't really give a damn
Take it or leave it, I am who I am
Just another person trying to find his way
Trying to figure it out trying to find my place
Either lead, follow or get out of the way
Life is too short, too fast to turn the page

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I really think I'm losing it
I don't really know what I would do without the therapy of music
Therapeutic no substituting
Can't erase the pain but sure help subdue it
Helps me to get through
Dismiss my issues
Gives me a lift to a place that's less blue
Sorta like a force field that protects you
Audio barricade I suggest you
Turn it up a little louder
When you feeling lonesome
When you feeling down some
When you really feeling like you hit rock bottom
And nothing to break your fall but more problems
And all the walls seem to close in on you
Nothing but darkness to fall upon you
Feels like all is lost everything around you
The sun will rise again you gotta push onward

[Hook]


[Verse 3]
Every time I look around I can't help but
Pray for something or someone to save us
From our own ways that seem to plague us
From the dawn of time our hate discontains us
All we really gotta do is live and let live
Enjoy the ride of all that exists man and that's it
Kinda simple ain't it? So why complicate it?
With all the bullshit and games that people playin'
If they wanna make their own grave let them lay in it
All I'm trying to say is don't create your own pain
Otherwise you'll be the one to blame and that's being honest
Another lame brain maybe you're walking around us
Every day can be a new day if you let it
Try to focus on the positive and not the negative
Tip nonsense I'm just saying let it
Go far by the wayside so many
People trying to bring you down
They drag you to the bottom then they try to watch you drown
And pretending to be friends but yet somehow
Always a reason to run they mouth
So jealous

[Hook]

[Outro]
Turn it up watch it
All just go away

Turn it up watch it
All just fade away

Turn it up watch it
All just go away

Turn it up watch it
All just fade away
