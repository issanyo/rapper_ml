[Intro: Kate Rose]
I know you really can’t see but
This grief is tearing through me
It’s left me like a house of cards
One breath – you’re gone

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Man it still seems so surreal that you’ve gone away
It sounds cliche but I still think about you everyday
See you in my dreams and pictures on the fire place
See you in the mirrors, reflection resemble my own face
When we were kids you used to tell me “never back down”
So how did you give up on everything and hit rock bottom
Toward the end we hardly spoke, we’ve never talked too often
You were too blind to see the pills were causing all your problems
Looking back at everything sometimes I blame myself
I could of try to do something to try to get you help
You kept on hidin', denyin', lyin' to your ownself
That you were playin' with fire, declining your own health
Then the phone called from hell that I remember well
Almost 5 a.m. hearin' our parents scream and yell
They were so incoherent with grief I can hardly tell
Then I finally understood that this was farewell

[Hook: Kate Rose]
I know you really can’t see but
This grief is tearing through me
It’s left me like a house of cards
One breath – you’re gone
I can’t move on

[Verse 2: Prozak]
I used to think that I’ll be the one leaving Earth first
With all the trouble causing and alcoholic at my worst
You used to tell me slow my roll before I hit the dirt
Ironically I think that God had got our fates reversed
And every now and then I drive alone to your grave
And even though my faith is weak I get on knees and pray
Wherever you may be, I hope it’s in a better place
That you can finally rest in peace inside eternal grace
And let me be the one to tell you nothing is the same
A heartbreaking conversation every holiday
The empty chair at the dinner table takes your place
The hollowness inside, I see it  in your childrens face
One day we all will be united on the other side
And all this pain and anguish will be surely be cast aside
We’ll have eternity to make up all that lost time
But until then hold a place for me up in the sky

[Hook: Kate Rose]
I know you really can’t see but
This grief is tearing through me
It’s left me like a house of cards
One breath – you’re gone
I can’t move on

[Bridge: Kate Rose]
I’ll hold on to your memories
You’ll always be a part of me
I’ll hold on to your memory
I’ll hold on, I’ll hold on
I’ll hold on (I'll hold on, I'll hold on)
(I'll hold on, I'll hold on)
(One breath, you're gone)
(I can't move on)

[Hook: Kate Rose]
I know you really can’t see but
This grief is tearing through me
It’s left me like a house of cards
One breath – you’re gone
I can’t move on
