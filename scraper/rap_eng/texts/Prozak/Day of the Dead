[Intro]
They say that when there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth
This is the Day of the Dead

[Hook]
Nothin to fear but fear itself on the day of the dead
They say there's no rest for the wicked it's the day of the dead
They say that life is self inflicted on the day of the dead
The devil disguised himself as God it's the day of the dead

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Enslaved in chains we walk the earth in search of happiness
Eternal bliss coincides with peace on earth and no conflicts
Think about this life that you call hell and all those things it means
Inside your mind is where you find them screams and broken dreams
Last rights, tell all these people how you livin
Call it Karma, 10 fold, some out to call it sinnin
Despite your belief, 3 sixes are the mark of the beast
The dead increase, PROJECT:DEADMAN walks among the deceased
Bodies crawlin from mud, victoms tainted with blood
Murder victims ressurected from shallow graves in the woods
You thoughts you had it all figured out
When you was young and though you'd never see the day that you faded out!
But it's upon us, like prophecies of Nostradamus
Truth hurts when it's honest, death and disease is chronic
Day of the dead, bloodshed, don't be misled
Don't be afraid of the shadow that's cast apon your death bed!

[Hook]
Nothin to fear but your religion (on the day of the dead)
Controls you , you judge, and then you murder (it's the day of the dead)
The evil upon you is what you're preachin (on the day of the dead)
The hatred towards others is what you're teachin (it's the day of the dead)

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Ravens circle above the sky turns green
45 seconds of life, try to figure out what the fuck it means
Afixiation of your soul emerged in misery
Trying to find someone to blame for life's conspiracies
(Judgement) (it is upon us) (Judgement) it is ahead
Judgement, it is the device that's built inside your head
Self destruction or self afliction? fact or fiction?
Emaculate conception... or Chrtists crucifiction?
Your eyes bleed,on bent knees you pray
2 worlds collide like suicide ...the crossroads you lay
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
Rest in Peace mother fucker confession will make your skull crush!

[Hook]
