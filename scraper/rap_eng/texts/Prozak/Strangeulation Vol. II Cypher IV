[Intro: Tech N9ne]
So you know you got to go when Tech N9ne hand you this track
So I call on Krizz, Rittz and Prozak, let's go!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
(Haha, here we go again! Yeah! Hey Tech, watch this!)
Kali baby, I guess I'm back at it again
Lemme laugh at 'em again
'Cause they know I write the back out of a pen
Holy moly get going nobody hold 'em is what they told 'em
And poda-be motor yodeling sick and ain't gettin over it
Sick at the lip and watch 'em clown, watch 'em clown, clown
Loving to tickle 'em I be licking 'em down, give 'em the crown
Look at the ground when you approaching the regal Beagle
And people don't be equal and when they saying: it's fecal
Betta give it up, put 'em in the blender
Surrender it like you had enough
Never no-contender pretending like you ready-to-buck
Ninja turtle talkin' to a splinter, I don't give a fuck
Ah-ha, it goes up
Killin niggas like they coppers
And rappers on my thing-a-ma-bobber
Come to chopping I'm the home of the whopper
Your girly bopping I don't think I can stop her
So dope that it made her wanna gimme a slobber
They remember you when you stop and you pop
Every syllable, bow down to a nigga that's bigger than you
And he thinking he can come and speak at him really rude
Ah-ha, eat the nigga food
I'll knock the stuffing out ya muffin, fucking knucklehead
Never did it wrong 'cause you singing the song all in your head
Lead off, I beat the beat up and go
Run a nigga feet off and chew 'em like a piece of pilaf
Shitting on niggas an leave the seat off, then re-tweet off
Social media this to beat off to
Damn, they think we lost 'cause when we get off a look at themselves saying we awful
'Cause it's more than bread that we wanting
Me and Nina keeping 'em jumping
And we won't stop 'till we get to the top
You in the way then we Midwest chop ya!

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Shit, never could do right in school, I just choose to cruise by
The principal told me I'm a loser, the dude’s right
All I did as a kid was shoot dice and toot white
Causing disputes, my future was never too bright
But who would’ve knew I’d be lucky enough to get a record deal
And pursue my music? I’m too psyched, not once, but two times
I murder shit, a repeat offender with the biggest independent, salute N9ne
If they bussin' I'mma take this rappin' shit to a new height
Too tight like Drake's bike jacket, my crew like
A pack of wild wolves, 'bout to howl at the moonlight
You wanna come at us? God bless, Gesundheit
You a pussy, you might lose a fight with a bull dyke
And I already give you a fuse strike, a few of mine
Kinda swole with this now your face is basically a bullseye
And you like ooh-ah!
And I ain't quitting 'til I got a crib in Malibu, sitting poolside
I'm chilling, sipping Crown a coke bag
I say what I'm thinking, never been known to hold back
I'm pimpin' 'em steadily, putting hoes on Prozac
Blow got me looking like my nose is snow-capped
Under the scopes, steady getting groped and poked at
Then those that oppose that wanna do-si-do
Per rope-a-dope will get you K.O.'d or toe tagged
At 5'10" you can see my 'fro from rows back
Fake friends hanging on my coast below Tech
Hate the term 'no homo' but I'm sick
Of bending over, getting fucked for the dough I don't have
Oh snap, forgot it was a chopper song
This is what you want to hear, I guess I better do a study how I execute it, therapeautic
Don't compare me, some of these rappers got a bigger pussy than the Octomom
And yo, ya-uh-yeah!

[Verse 3: Prozak]
Thinkin' about takin' it to another level
I'm from another realm like an angel falling from heaven
I fell to the Earth, the purpose of resurrection
I'm coming through your speakers like demonic possession
And hell's bells, don't be afraid of mythology
Deep inside my brain is a wicked psychology
Ancient revelation intertwined with technology
Alien biology, you know that I gotta be Strange!
Damn right, and I'm proud to be
Biggest independent label, check the biography
We taking over the industry without an apology
Burning all the bridges, tell me who wanna follow me
I'm sick with the sickness and spit with the quickness, so vicious with every bar (bar)
So best to be leaving me lonely, psychotic and mentally scarred (scarred)
And I don't really wanna be the one to tell you but I will if you don't get it by now
Our strangers are angels, and able to seal the game, you lames better bow down (bow down)
You need to recognize a miracle inside the lyrical, we're killing all these shows now
It started from the bottom, now we got the people showing up and lining up in every town
Takin' it to another planet and stratosphere
Circle like a satellite on top of this atmosphere
Snake and bat the symbol of the future, don't interfere
You don't really wanna be the one we make disappear
And this flow is hypnotic, it's class A narcotics, you pop out the bottle
Prescribed by psychologists, go for psychotic shit
Prozak and Kaliko, Rittz, Midwest Chopper shit

[Outro: Skyler Brown & Kelsee Pietz]
Baby, you up?
Yeah, let's do it
