[Verse 1: Prozak]
Gonna take it to another level, never gonna run with the devil
Don't matter, rap or metal
My brain wavin' like a razorblade, pops
Like a 12 guage pumped down to make a mother fucker jump
Back to back the preminition of a murder scene
With the smell of rotting corpse, and the screams of the unseen
What the fuck is goin on in my brain
God damn this life, I think that I'm insane
Havin visions of a homicide, a killin, watchin' blood spillin'
Prozak: the wicked villain
Savin' the best for last, fuck the past
Surpass, and everlast this life when the guns flash
Boom! Motherfuckin' guns blazin, when I'm hell raisin'
Better watch your back, from the shit that you been sayin
Layin on the ground, screaming in pain, whos to blame, insane
Chest pains, with pumped veins, seven lines of cocaine
Rails upon rails, nails upon nails
Light your ass with the flames of cock-tails
Your style is so stale, your face is so pale
In life you will fail, your soul I impale

[Hook: Mike E. Clark]
All my fuckin life, I've been insane
And every fuckin day, I feel the blood rain
And everything I say, it only brings pain
All the wicked prey, salvation some day

[Verse 2: Prozak]
What you wanna do battle me? Better pick a stratedgy
PDM in this bitch, you can't handle me
Walkin amongst the dead, keeping the demons fed
With body parts full of blood red bullet lead damn
Cardiac arrest the pains up in your chest
Nothins left but your last breath, now you may rest in peace
But the beats increase disease the white sheet
The meek inherit the earth, for what it's worth , middle east
Havin visions of a homicide, a killin, watchin' blood spillin'
Prozak: the wicked villain
Savin' the best for last, fuck the past
Surpass, and everlast this life when the guns flash
Obvious you are out your mind, happiness you'll never find
So keep on looking motherfucker for that seventh sign
Takin it to the end and pretend its not the end but it is
Handle your buiss, a deadman lives

[Verse 3: Prozak]
Apocolyptic when I kick the wicked shit when I spit it
Turn the tables on your fables, when I bring it to you
Serve you, never knew you tell me what you're gonna do
When my spirit walks right through you
Victim of a homicide, involuntary suicide
Mass form of genocide, human rights don't apply
For this, I live and die for this, murder for this
My soul eclipse, with death's last kiss

[Hook]

[Outro]
A man of god preach does he sell the preach of such a powerful an order
The spirit of God flows lilke a river through that order
That man that considers himself an atheist
Stood up from that audience that night he did not leave

[Hook]
