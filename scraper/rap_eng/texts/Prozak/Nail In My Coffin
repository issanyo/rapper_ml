[Verse 1: SCUM]
I've got a plan to change, I will never follow through
Or even attempt to take a step into the right direction
I'm on the road that leads to hell, when there's a chance
To take a turn and hit the gas and blow right through that intersection
Instead of spendin time at home with wife and kids
I'm going out every other night and when I return, my hands are bloody
Then I get a shovel, leavin again to dig a hole up in my secret burial spot
Just to get rid of another body, So what the fuck is wrong with me?
Cause I'm walkin around the edge of a street
Without any shows of feelings, my hands be grippin a shotgun
I'm pumpin and dumpin in front of the scared
The heavens above hopin my angel gets hypnotic
Gets met with attack, cause I doubt that I actually got one
I'm losin it all, my mind is gone and even hope
That there's a chance for a monster like me
Become someone's normal, cause there's no stoppin
A runaway train full enough of the clips I'll put out on the deal
I pick up a hammer and proceed to drive an another one
Rusty ass nail in my coffin

[Hook]
It's another nail, just another nail in my coffin, nail in my coffin
Just a fuckin nail, yet another nail in my coffin, nail in my coffin
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, nail in my coffin, nail in my coffin
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, nail in my coffin, nail in my coffin

[Verse 2: Insane Poetry]
I am a family man, I got a wife and daughter
I’m a vibrant author by day, at night I like to slaughter
Try to fight this monster, it's like Dr. Jekyll versus Mr. Hyde
Inside of this mind is a maniac just like my father
Got a split personality, damn it, is he Mr. Brooks?
Serial killer in your neighborhood, modelin with different looks
You see the devil and the horns with the crooks
Crownies found with their eyes gouged back with fishing hooks
Got an insatiable apetite for murderous posse
When I write stories, then come live gory scenes
When I wake up, my hands full of blood
I'm lying naked in my room, thinkin what the fuck I've done
Another blackout, I acted out the next chapter entry for my books
In blood I'm writing, when I read it back it's frightening
Not been able to stop this urge, I exhale when I'm caught in
And when it happens it's a nail in my coffin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prozak]
In every breath is just another nail, another fail
And so mortality skips the scale and teleports me straight to hell
And a hand basket, rigor mortis inside of a black casket
I feel the metamorphosis takin control in each and every fasciis
I'm living in downward spiral, I'm thinkin it down and nightcrawl
I'm grabbin this loaded rifle, my thoughts are cold and spiteful
I'm tryin to get a grip on this, moronic thoughts of slippery shit
Demolish me to increments, this inner demon miscreants
Guided by dark forces, no longer could hear God’s voices
No conscience is in my choices, ambient sounds of evil noises
Perhaps it's mental illnes, but the fact's I can’t conceal this
No silver bullet would kill this, no one should ever feel this
Complete void of emotions, like a vast and darkest ocean
Inhabited with tortured souls who laught at you with hearts so frozen
... Who laught at you with hearts so frozen

[Hook]
