[Intro]
But which one of us is the horror that scares little children?
Is it me? Or is it the man that made me?
For evil defines what it is life defines me

[Hook]
I'll be forever watching I'll be forever stalking
At night you hear me talking I am the Deadman Walking

[Verse 1: Prozak]
You think I'm dead bitch but you'll never know
All those things from the past better let it go
Prozak down with the blood flow
Hell ride never die with that murder show
You hear me whisper in your sleep when you slumber
The sun is clouded by the storm when it thunders
My body rots to this tomb I feel a slave
The maggots eat my corps as I am screaming for my Grave
I'm insane everyday's the same
I take your brain levitate through flames
I never had a conscience I don't feel shame
Dont speak my name when the sky drops rain
The terror elevates the pain to a level
The walking dead coinsides with the devil
You see my face penetrating through your mind
My body walks the earth in vein until the end of time

[Hook]
I will forever watch you I will forever want you
I will forever see you I will not ever leave you
I'll be forever watching I'll be forever stalking
At night you hear me talking I am the Deadman Walking(2x)

I am your debtor your master
I have your voice your life

[Verse 2: Prozak]
All I wanna do is take your fuckin life
And burn this bitch down like Devil's nite
Run with an axe in the pale moon light
Screaming they're baaaaaaack like Poltergeist
You hear me whisper in your sleep when you slumber
The sun is clouded by the storm when you thunder
My body rots to this tomb I feel a slave
The maggots eat my corps as I am screaming for my brain
My body rots but my mind still goes
Parallel universe time is froze
Fly Through the sky like ten black crows
I'm out for revenge and my hatred grows
The terror elevates the pain to a level
The walking dead coinsides with the devil
You see my face penetrating through your mind
My body walks the earth in vein until the end of time

[Hook]
