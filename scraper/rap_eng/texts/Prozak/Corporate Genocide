[Hook: Prozak]
How many have to die before you realize
Corporate Genocide we under closed eyes
So many sacrifice, how can you justify
There is no one to testify, no one to testify

[1 verse: Prozak]
Sacrificial Lambs, part of the master plan
Designed by corporate dictators enslave to make profit, man
And all across the land wrap your heads with contraband
In a form of radio, television, you understand?
They keep panic with no regards for the planet
It`s all for the profit, how the fuck you can`t stand it?
And now you manic depressed, compulsive obsessed, stressed
Clutch your chest, the executive got you feeling oppressed
They offer pills for your ills and now you broke to pay bills
See they got you, now they bought you
Tell me how the fuck it feels
To be a slave to a trade and now you are forced to your grave
And now poor are back to war while oppressors are getting paid

[Hook]
How many have to die before you realize
Corporate Genocide we under closed eyes
So many sacrifice, how can you justify
There is no one to testify, no one to testify

[2 Verse: Prozak]
Is it democracy or blatant hypocrisy?
Using people captivity to fulfill financial prophecies
You are not a citizen, man, you are just a customer
Corporations, media government are the hustlers
This is the shame now, nobody safe now
It`s time to spark a revolution through the underground sound
So get the fuck up, people throw your fist up
Your fist treated like cattle, forced by blind trust
The power of the nation lies in it`s people
So it`s up to you to fuck with the righteous, destroy the evil
United we shall stand, divided we shall fall
But if we stand together and conquer, it was worth it all

[Spoken: Prozak]
Think about it, people, this nation is 5% of population and yet we consume over 28% of the world`s energy, 27% of the world`s recourses, all to support corporations that do nothing but destroy us and strip us of our identity and choices, brainwashing us to trap us into a slum with this false sense of social status we have chosen!

[Hook: Prozak]
How many have to die before you realize
Corporate Genocide we under closed eyes
So many sacrifice, how can you justify
There is no one to testify, no one to testify

[Outro: George W. Bush]
We need an energy bill that encourages consumption
