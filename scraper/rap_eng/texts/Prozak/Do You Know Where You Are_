[Intro: Tech N9ne]
We don't ever want no trouble
We don't wanna have to fight
But disrespect
Is unacceptable
So it's not our fault after it goes down
If you came to us with some bullshit
There's no limit to what can happen
As the peace barrier has been broken by ignorance

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
People find themselves impaled in hell and it's
Evil devouring now there's how they're down there
You're in my town nigga!
Pick up the pilly and put the hype down nigga!
Because you wanna run your mouth
Some to the lungs, we killas'll gun you out
You better get ghost, backpack
You don't want the shit to go brrat cat
Your mother put you in a permanent knapsack
Because I can't go out like that
It'll go down, when a stupid nigga come in your town
In a bar with a pocket full of dough now
A lot of ho's 'round and he throw frowns
Cur with a perv, that is not us
Dishonorable nigga, we gonna lock up
You don't know, dead bodies 'bout to pop up
Steppin' in my face like what!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Question?
Do you know where you are?
You talkin' big shit you best to get steppin'
But you'll never get far
If you slip and let my crew get the weapons
But they not in the car
They're all around you, so just take a second
Do you know where you are?
Do you know where you are!?
Do you know where you are?
You talkin' big shit you best to get steppin'
But you'll never get far
If you slip and let my crew get the weapons
But they not in the car
They're all around you, so just take a second
Do you know where you are?
Do you know where you are!?

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Punk ass nigga feel like he got an S on his chest
Always letting his mouth write a check that his ass can't cash

[Verse 2: Prozak]
You're in my zone
Killer territory, this is my throne
Sadomasochism get your bones broke
And placed below, encased in limestone
Too late to save face
You will never see the light of day
Just you wait
You'll be begging to take the pain away
That blood you taste is your last meal, say grace
Do you know where you are!?
Like a psycho loading my rifle
I'm digging holes in the dirt in advance
Under the light of the moon where the witches brew
With their brooms and their devil's dance
Bloodstains on my face
Bloodstains on my shirt, bloodstains on my pants
And now that I'm thinking about it
You don't know where you are!
Should've never crossed the line
Should've never switched lanes, cut into mine
Destiny will intersect from time to time
Now the thought of killing you consumes my mind
To erase, mutilate, levitate you
This hate, so contagious, contains you
Eternity in the grave where I place you
Only I know where you really are!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]

Do you know where you are?
Do you know where you are!?
Do you know where you are?
You talkin' big shit you best to get steppin'
But you'll never get far
If you slip and let my crew get the weapons
But they not in the car
They're all around you, so just take a second
Do you know where you are?
Do you know where you are!?

[Bridge 2: Prozak]
The jack of all trades is master of none
When time's up wind up or thy will be done

[Verse 3: Monoxide of Twiztid]
Meet me in the middle of a mosh pit where I got to get so crazy
I'm a little bit of Pac with a new Glock shit and I'm angry
Anybody wanna stop this, a pop lip to a cop
It's a whole 'nother level that I get to rot
Got everybody running when I get the shot
Ain't nobody looking to really get it with anybody
I'm choking the circle of people that killing everybody
Even else they think that they equally need to hear me
Now nothing but the evil is speaking and I keep providing
Keep me hiding in low down, making it go 'round and 'round
When I clown in your town
Do you know what the reason you the fools throttle?
It's about to go down!

[Verse 4: Madrox of Twiztid]
Uh!
Welcome to the shadows
This ain't a motherfuckin' freestyle battle
Me and my brother knuckle up, fuck you up
With an uppercut, sure enough to make your teeth rattle
Finish him!
Double headed axe to the back of the face
The motherfucker's invading our space
Do you know what we are?
From the murder glove
We ain't got no love for motherfucker's tripping and getting dumb
Man they want some got enough to go round 2, 3 times
You ain't serial killers on the grind
I'ma start with your soul, then kill your body and mind
Alive for a short time and dead by the end of the rhyme
I'm back and in fact, do you know where you are?
Motherfucker we 'bout to break your neck
Better watch your mouth and keep your ass in check
'Cause me and my killas are gonna die for respect
