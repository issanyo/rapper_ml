[Hook x3]
Maybe itâ€™s just best to try to leave me by my lonely homie
Maybe we ain't friends, if you want my trust show me
People actin' kinda funny like a full moon
Got me feelin' dark gloom
Igniting my psycho just like some gas fumes

[Verse 1]
Maybe I should set an example, extract some blood samples
Run this razor blade across his throat and adam's apple
Dismantle his body into pieces, sink him in this reservoir
What the fuck you starin' for, what the fuck you take me for?
Take this as an act of war
Dressed in black and strap my lord
Act like demons from the past I'm tappin' at your chamber door
Quoth the raven "nevermore", Edger Allen, I implore
Hope you prayed before you were placed underneath this cellar boards
I'm going out like Berkowitz, your existence superfluous
My persistence to hurt you and remove you from this earth
And it's vital that I complete the cycle
Proceed to murder your idols on pins and needles
Leave you bleedin' with knives and rifles

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I've been in this game so long
I'm numb to the pain, hold on
I function this way, mind gone
You takin' my place? (Dead wrong)
I'm infamous, incision you to increments
With these instruments of vigilance, have you wishin' for innocence
Beat you into submission, bitch
Show you the mind of villain instead of killin' it
Lyrically like you ain't feelin' this
Always perceiving, seemin' to be the seed of a demon
Cause you can't seem to beat 'em or cease 'em from breathin'
I'm sick of this, ignorance, illegitimate, hatin' shit
Bitches, stay up out my mix, quit jockin' on my style, so sick
You talk about my style so much you might as well be my publicist
Twenty-ten, back again, resurrect like I'm from Nazareth

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Huh, people actin' real funny, you know what I'm sayin'?
There must be a full moon in this motherfucker or something
