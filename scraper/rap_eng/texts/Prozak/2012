[Hook x2]
Aligning of the planets, eclipsing all the sun
The Anticrhist has come to life so now you all must run
No need to bar up houses, too late to load those guns
You've always known (sooner or later this way comes)

[Verse 1]
The chosen go to heaven, the damned will dwell in hell
But what becomes of us chosen lifeless shells
I think they become demons ressurected for this reasons
The tortured and smoldered and thee enforcment of all these demons
The final price we pay, displayed through age of sin
Nocturnal, demonic, robotic creature swaying [?]
It's so resourceful they save every more so
Leaving bones and cartilage fall apart by jaws so shaprened forceful
They rummage and scavenge the streets in search of [?]
Through severian language they praise and pay the Devil homage
The air reeks in sulfur, the ground begins to [?]
The sky is filled with vultures
As the clouds begin to bleed like ulcers
You are cast away and removed from the sight
Down the pathway of the black plague of days of etarnal night
It is over, you must enjoy the prophecies of the raptures
So [?] you're captured, you must bow down to your master

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
The sun void cast the Earth of nourishments
While [?] soil is giving birth flourishing evil [?]
Diabolical serpents with apocalyptical purpose
To eliminate the sign of us, these terminators of surface
You don't know where to turn, now you're acting so concern
High in sight is 20/20 'bout to watch the world burn
Your deepest, darkest fears are slowly here to fruition
There's no way out of here except genocidal extinction
Your soul is on the crossroads, only feeling heart broken
Way be down the point of no return and abscence of all hope
There is no tomorrow, only pain and sorrow
The end is finally here, time is the only thing you can't borrow
So just relax and let it go, like I always said before
There's time to walk of between the road where the flowers grow
The cemetary is awaiting to take your body below
Holograms of your love ones screaming "silence though"
(Silence though!)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Your lungs filled with embryonic fluid
You start screaming from the seeding
Yet piercing and chanting of minds [?]
Volcanic ash consumes your eyes, nose and mouth
And telekinesis they be speaking and you cannot tune a mouth
It's like a whole world's a nightmare
You're right inside the crosshairs
You tryin to find your way, but it's too late
There ain't no light there
The hounds of hell are howling
Deceitful creatures rambling
The serpents peeking surface in search of Earths [?]
We always had these testaments as evidence of such [?]
From the Bible, to the mines, to the findings of NASA
We chose to ignore scholar ancient mend of sacred honors
We the senselessness and selfishness
That's brought upon us final hour
I know it's hard to follow, perhaps it's just a dream
Maybe you can decipher  the things really means
So until then my friend, I bid you well
To whom this may consume, end times 2012
