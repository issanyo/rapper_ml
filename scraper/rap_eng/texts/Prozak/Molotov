[Verse 1]
You gotta watch your own back cause nobody else will
This is a game of survival, it's kill or be killed
You are surrounded by rivals that only think ill
This is a time for reaction, this ain't no stand still
You gotta place yourself on high alert like Defcon
Pierce through the skull of your adversaries like Tevlon
You gotta stand up for yourself, quit getting stepped on
Not have to sleep with those sticky serpents decepticons
You gotta stand up and now back up your self-confidencing
Tear ‘em to shreds like CIA documents
Black ops pack Glocks, rock spots, onslaughts
Pour shots, Hitchcock, hip-hop, top notch

[Hook x2]
There's no surrender, never homie, at any cost
You've always got yourself when all the hope is lost
We in this together, this modern riot’s holocaust
You the flame, I’m the motherfuckin' Molotov

[Verse 2]
You gotta keep your guard up, never ever let it down
Cause you never know when sneak attacks be back around
Some people like to take your kindness for weakness
So keep your privacy secret, the least you say – the better the defense
And try to keep a situation from every angle
So you can get a handle before you'll get dismantled by scandal
And best remember pure evil comes with seductive smiles
You might be sleeping with the enemy, stuck in denial
That those as close will hurt you the most and after a while
You see the truth called the shining, through so dark and so vile
Their hearts are frozen, exposing their true nature, the behaterring
And nothing more than the wolf posing inside of sheeps’ clothing

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I know these verses are painted with grim reality
And seeming seeding with negativity but in actuality
These analogies derive from catastrophes
Such blasphemies that have attacked and happened, they have happened to me
Just passing down some wisdom, beware of narcissism
Intertwined with volatile violently vulgar organisms
Better known as human beings, you can't trust nobody
It seems these bottom feeders always tryina be feeding off hopes and dreams
But maybe we can change as a society
And try to make lighter things that challenge our camaraderie
I'd like to think the best of every person
But it seems so self-defeating when the greed is still alive and lurkin
We gotta stop the hurting, then reach for higher learning
Only then can we advance and try to recover from burning
Each other in every hovel, possible way we can
But until then, until then, until then

[Hook x2]

Of the motherfuckin Molotov…
Of the motherfuckin Molotov…
The motherfuckin Molotov…
