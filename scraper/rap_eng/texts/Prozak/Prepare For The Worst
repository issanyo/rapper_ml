[Hook - Prozak]:
You gotta, hope for the best, prepare for the worst
It’s never over 'til you’re rollin' all alone inside that hearse
And there's, one life, one death, one path that’s yours
So run fast, full blast, kick back them doors
[X2]

[Verse 1 - Prozak]:
I know sometimes your mental state will try to misguide you
Mislead you into thinkin’ that you’ve got the devil right beside you
Perhaps you’re thinking you're sinkin'
And slowly slippin' by misguided intuition
Which is one more part of inhibitions(?)
You've got to be yourself no matter what the cost
And if others don’t like it
Tell those player haters just to (fuck off!)
Don't waste your time on pettiness or petty people
See they wanna spread evil to make up for the fact that ____ people
You've got to rise above 'em; take them with a grain of salt
Never subscribe to negativity, homie assume the force
And imitation is the greatest form of flattery
That’s how I’ve been rappin’ for 10 years;
And kept my sanity!

[Hook]
You gotta, hope for the best, prepare for the worst
It’s never over 'til you’re rollin' all alone inside that hearse
And there's, one life, one death, one path that’s yours

[Verse 2 - Prozak]:
Them people are afraid of things that they don’t understand
So never take it personally, just try to be the bigger man
I hope you find some inspiration from this song
That you can take away from, maybe you can break free from these limitations
It's all inside your head, and if you think about it
When you know that you're the shit
There ain't nothing no one can say about it
Keep that ego to a minimal, try to stay respectful
Not cynical, this is critical, stay original
There's no respect for an imitation, carbon copy
And never take for granted friends or family, man, or become sloppy
These are the words to live by, when you’re an artist
And maybe one day you will understand it, when you’re the hardest emcee

[Hook]
You gotta, hope for the best, prepare for the worst
It’s never over 'til you’re rollin' all alone inside that hearse
And there's, one life, one death, one path that’s yours
So run fast, full blast, kick back them doors
