[Verse 1: Prozak]
I cannot breathe, but I don't seem to struggle
I hear the voices of my grandparents and my brother
Everything so unfamiliar, yet I know my way
To describe this feeling, it's the opposite of pain
No separation from the sky and the ground
Leavin' it only to my imagination as I look around
All along the outskirts walk the lost souls
Screaming in the language that only the shadows know
Script of the any recolection of the former lives
So full of sorrow otherwise hollow on inside
The feeling is so lonely that I have to turn away
I ponder how awfull to be the final price to pay
I continue moving to the trenches of this outter realm
The feeling of being followed is certain but I cannot tell
Up from down, left from right, night from day, day from night
But the whisper in the wind told me "it's all right"

Keep your life
Keep us alive

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Walking down this dark hallway with many doors
And every single room is the place that I've been before
Door one was the hospital I was born in
It's right across from that was my grandmother she was sewing
In the same chair when she lost air such a blank stare
Tryin call her name but I can only speak in prayer
Moving on into the third door
I feel the presence of my cousins and uncles so I'm in corridor
Of this dark room that is pitch black
Since that I've never seen the faces I knew they never be coming back
The forth room is empty
But I can understand symbolically that's how I felt most of my life
So it was me
Door five help my spirit guides inside
Their hands are joining in the circle protecting me from all sides
A dark figure blocked the sixth door
Cloud black the whisper in the wind spoke again and it said "turn back"

[Hook: Liz Suwandi]
Keep your life
Keep us alive
