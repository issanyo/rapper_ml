[Hook x2]
(Hate) It's in everyone I know
It follows everywhere I go
Carefully take control
All this hate inside you (hate)

[Verse 1]
It's living inside of you, this ferocious monster
Your catalyst, your nemesis stop the ganger imposter
Eating at your conscious, subliminally filling your head with nonsense
Evil ambience, while we're spreading level in content
Pulling on your strings like a puppeteer
Got you punked with fear, and it's so sincere
When the devils creeps near, and he speaks in your ear
When he sneaks in your mind, body, soul disapears (hate)
And maybe one day we will come overcome this circumference
Whole circle of violence and exchange it for silos or somethin'
Meanwhile the blood is still runnin'
Nation kills nation, brother kills brother
Often for nothing more than self dominance over one another
Mother earth is ready to shake us off the fault lines
We gotta look into ourselfs see where the fault lays
We gotta tryin' stick together in these dark times
Ancient revelations come to life inside these dark rhymes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Somehow it stays ingrain in us, that's ain't enough
That we maiming, murder each other it stays the same ain't no giving up
Hate is such a primitive, simple emotion
Yet its blindly followed by billion of simpletons with silent devotion
From coast to coast and ocean to ocean
I get the notion like their forcing hate down on the throat
Like potent poisonous potion distracting us from everything
And attackin' us from the back it seems
It's slashing us right at the steams
And never look back and laugh at our dreams (hate)
We gotta try to conquer this remaining optimism
Before the words mankind and extinction become synonymous
What's a worth then? When there's nothing left
Absence on life with cold silence in your chest
Full of nothing but rigor mortis and regret
Only wishing you could witness another sunset
A brutal world full of tortured souls with non rest
Planet earth is a deadly game of chess full of (hate)

[Hook]
