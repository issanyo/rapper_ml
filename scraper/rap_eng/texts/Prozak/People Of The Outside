[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
We are the lost
'Cause you don’t kno-o-o-o-ow
Forsaken so-o-o-o-ouls
We are the ones
Waiting in the co-o-o-o-old
For you to no-o-o-o-otice

[Verse 1: Prozak]
People of the outside always looking in
Through the windows of their own eyes, tryna fit in
But realizin' they will never really know the feelin'
Or replace the hole inside ‘em, so cold it’s like freezin’, man
I can’t tell ‘ya how many times that I felt it
Life can be a living hell like a cell that you’re trapped in
Like a bed of nails, impaling you so relentless
Like you’re born to fail, sincerely feelin’ helpless
Slowly slippin' away, sinking in quicksand
Like drowning in water, shackles on both hands
Like fallin' blindfolded not knowin' where you’ll land
Nobody seems to really care, nobody understands

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
We are the lost
'Cause you don’t kno-o-o-o-ow
Forsaken so-o-o-o-ouls
We are the ones
Waiting in the co-o-o-o-old
For you to no-o-o-o-otice

[Verse 2: Prozak]
You just got to try and believe in your own self
Cause only you possess the key to your own cell
And if you think down deep where the darkness dwells
Confront your fears to release from your own hell
Cause every breath is nothing, short of a miracle
An epic journey through time and space, so vastly spiritual
And I’m tryna reach it, the method lyrical
Screamin' through your speakers
But it seems that you don’t hear me though
You gotta drop the baggage, the negativity
And everything that it inhabits
So you can clearly see that peace of mind is within reach
Just gotta grab it, take control of your own destiny
And best believe you can be happy

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
We are the lost
'Cause you don’t kno-o-o-o-ow
Forsaken so-o-o-o-ouls
We are the ones
Waiting in the co-o-o-o-old
For you to no-o-o-o-otice

[Bridge: Tyler Lyon]
Which side are you on?
Do you know where you’re standing?

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
We are the lost
'Cause you don’t kno-o-o-o-ow
Forsaken so-o-o-o-ouls
We are the ones
Waiting in the co-o-o-o-old
For you to no-o-o-o-otice
