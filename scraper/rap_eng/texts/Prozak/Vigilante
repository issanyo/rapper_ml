[Intro]
Vigilante, vigilante
Vigilante, vigilante

[Verse 1: Prozak]
I feel the excitement, there is no turning back
I feel that I'm righteous just like the Zodiac
And take a look at that, that man is smoking crack
I hit him with a bat and now his neck is snapped
Sprinkle of holy water, then said a prayer
I send that demon back to hell, down to Satan's lair
Wait, what's over there? I think I spot some more
I think they're hell's minions and they’re disguised as whores
I started walking past them, then I attacked the random
I scream the hail Mary every single time I stabbed em
These are the end of days, this is the end of time
Human purification, this is a hate crime

[Hook: Prozak]
It’s so sad to say, so many passed away
Sent a foreign grim stone, they are castaways
Some say my heart is weak, so many led astray
There’ll be better days or either there’ll be hell to pay
But for the first time but there won’t be no better days
Look into his eyes, you think he is a mental case?
A vigilante in his mind, he can sink the day
A vigilante in his mind, he shall sink the day

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I'm so out of the ordinary
That my mind is like a sword I carry
If through rhyme I destroy adversaries
Turned a freestyle battle to a mortuary
Carry guns and knives, kill sluts and wives
They're the reason that we're fucking up most of our lives
It took a while to realize that maybe it's an excuse
But they gotta take me alive from the murdering in the booth
Keep while the chipping tooth cause the mic's too close
But I pretend it's a bitch and I just spit on the throat
Maybe I need a little help, but not from a script
I need more emcees to help murder a bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Lyrically I’m Adrian Chase, a ski mask
And no face, ghost face, I'm Ghost Rider
With the spirit of vengeance and a skull of fire
Bout to seek out the witches and point out you liars
All the fakers and biters like vampires
They tryina drain us dry hoping that we retire
Going deeper than the underground this time around
Pay attention real close to all the shit that's going down
Bout to hit you 3 times with a blast of .45
Death wish to the script, keeping true to every line
Should I follow every sign that pointed a hollow grave
Then I wouldn't be here tryin to save the fuckin day

[Hook]
