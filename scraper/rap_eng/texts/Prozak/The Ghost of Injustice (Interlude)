Although they attempt to hide the events of the past
Their are no lies large enough to conceal or subtract
Indeed blood on the hands may quickly wash away
However the wound's inflicted are eternal, forever to stay
The Ghost of injustice spreads fear and provokes
A vicious malignant entity we have long since awoke
The choices are simple, remove the bandage and repair
Or continue to keep infected with more lie's and despair
