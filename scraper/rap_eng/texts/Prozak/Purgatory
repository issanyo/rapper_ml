[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Afterlife deserved
Is it really real anyway?
Wish I could find a better way
That I would lay me down
And give my life to you
There's nothing left to do
The inner story, the purgatory
What does it all mean?

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
The Good Book says and I don't really think they be wolfin' and if you already get tooken
I shook those fears, and I don't really believe and I should, and now the book got me lookin'
Seem like some all types of hopes, folks, copes and what they lovin' the most (the most)
I had the weirdest dreams and guttural screams and demons were seen from coast to coast
(Breathe) for the last time, sniff as if you deserve it
(Believe) if you don't know by now, you just made it real permanent
(Sleep) inside the golden gate, somewhere everyone hates you
(Please) ain't no savin', no face or nowhere to escape to
Eyes is wide shut but I gotta go visit
The automatism, the vision inside of my gut
Life is like "what?!", whatever you make it
Don't waste it 'fore your time is up till the peace of you
That you can see knee deep, tryna sweep 'em
Keep 'em from peepin' you
And when the streetsweep keep
[?All the deep sleep blinkin' you?]
Sinkin' 'em, ain't nobody speak of you
And that's purgatory!

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Afterlife deserved
Is it really real anyway?
Wish I could find a better way
That I would lay me down
And give my life to you
There's nothing left to do
The inner story, the purgatory
What does it all mean?

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Imagine a place that is darker than anything
That you have ever seen
The Earth is infected with evil in people
There is no vaccine
Baptized in blood, it's too late for repentance
The rapture is here
Surrounded by flames and the smoke through the portal
The devil appears
Screams can be heard at the Valley of Death
As the torture begins
The judgment is poured on behalf of our Lord
We shall pay for our sins
Nothing to do but to suffer, eternity
Screaming in pain
Tortured by demons and minions from hell
As they're praising his name
Please God, help me understand this plan
From this planet of madness
I try to walk the right path in this world inhabited by savage malice
I take a look inside but what I find behind my eyes is eternal sadness
I'm begging for forgiveness, Father, I don't wanna perish
Let me rise from the ashes

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Afterlife deserved
Is it really real anyway?
Wish I could find a better way
That I would lay me down
And give my life to you
There's nothing left to do
The inner story, the purgatory
What does it all mean?

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
You cannot even see a movie
Without the thought of a killer comin' to get you with the uzi
And you don't even know the killer but he hit you with the tooley
And murdered many more, the motive made is the man is moody
And who is the one to shoot him? He is, indeed his
Mother should've murdered him as a fetus and beat his
Ass with his cleated Adidas
Jillian and Mayci are deleted now we live defeated!
Crooked cops is puttin' niggas in boxes
I watch this on the telly, every day a synopsis
Double cross this, really silly to pop quick
And not get caught with the prejudice for the chocolate
Caustic, burnin' so many right as the Glock spit or talked then he lost it
STOP IT! All I was yellin' till last cough it was chalk shit no hospice!
The homeless, the onus is on us
Get blown up by the enemy and damn, it hurts
A stronger aroma of grown guts
Then bone dust, for infinity we damned at birth, handed dirt
A natural disaster, kill 'em all in the churches
The man at work?
But is the one working God or Satan?
Awakened in purgatory, people, welcome to planet Earth!

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Afterlife deserved
Is it really real anyway?
Wish I could find a better way
That I would lay me down
And give my life to you
There's nothing left to do
The inner story, the purgatory
What does it all mean?
