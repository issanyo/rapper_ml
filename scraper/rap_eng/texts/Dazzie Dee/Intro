[Introduction: Dazzie Dee]
This is not a x-rated album
It is for everything human that's moving
This album is not approved by the NAACP
Urban league, business men's club
Or jive ass black preachers
And not the middle class negro who gave up the fight
The day he got $10 more
And moved into his big house on the fucking hill
Where the white man used to live and thought
And he is paying double loads and double rent
In his house and his apartment
And he thinks he is doing something
This album isn't for that mother fucker
This album is for that poor black mother fucker
Living in the God damn ghetto
