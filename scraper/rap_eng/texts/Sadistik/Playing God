Ayo I'm starting to face that a part of me's fake
And everything that they say is just hard to relate
And then it (ends quick) and it starts to decay
Until my (friendship) is a part of the phase
And I, can't pre-tend, can't stand these trends
Can't stand weak friends that have pretense
Sad can't stand back at that deep end
Now I see that I don't need friends
And I feel like a modern day patriot
With a mind of a God and a heart of an atheist
God's love is a conjugal visit
Cus you just get fucked while you're locked in a prison
My passion's emphatic (it's mixed with) tragic romantic (instances)
Sadness and hazards (six six six) havoc that crafted (Sadistik)
An eye for an eye and a tooth can trade
Then you turn the other cheek 'til the bruises fade
If you lose an eye, lose a tooth and lose a cheek
Then your religion is losing face
When I vacate, to a sanctity
To a safe place, that was made for me
And then placate, all my atrophy
Then I won't say faith, isn't make-believe
I walk (a fragile path), of thought (and habitats)
I've lost (and can't have back) across (the aftermath)
Of befriendin' each sentence, endin'
Retention defense and tension
Repentance needs ventin' when in
Dependent deep ended friendship
Followed first on a path of hollow verse
Solemn words that were both spoke but not emerged
Gotta learn that I gotta get through autumn first
Follow dirt that is gonna let the God occur
Read your Bible (script the verses)
Stand for nothing (but sit at service)
Find the meaning (but miss the purpose)
Read in depth (but you get the surface)
Some say, I'll have to be synthetic, to get my quotes red (read) like your Jesus said it
Some day, I'll form opinion, either stand up to God or fall for religion
The road you cross, isn't quite a crossroad
Your Bible's lines signify a barcode
And I'll go, put a rhyme to reason
Nietzche said "god is dead" and I believe him!
