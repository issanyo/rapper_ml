[Intro: SeezMics]
Update your Facebook status and let 'em know where you are
Be your own little star, star, star, star
I’m gonna catch that one when I grow up
Send some Tweets out, where will you eat now?
Post some pictures so we can see how
Ridiculous your life really is
When it’s all in the wrist
Come and get your log in
Go and get your log on
Come and get your log in
Go and get your log on
Come and get your log in
Go and get your log on

[Verse 1: SeezMics]
Get your log on before it’s all gone
A status symbol, we don’t need to talk long
The strong arm of a quota
Mind if I safe-for-work quote ya and post up?
Cause I could do so verbatim
Here’s what you’d say to flirtation
“I don’t accept requests from perfect strangers
And my breasts look best from certain angles.”
I’m faceless- fingertip foreplay for the fun of it
Logging on for the crime and the punishment
A couple clicks to adjust your pics
Embellishing foot fetishes just for kicks (ha)
Do you do the same with your character?
Is it a game when there’s no truth in daring ya? (nah)
Now, I’m on the other side of America
But I’m never too far to get my log on and stare at ya

[Hook: SeezMics]
Cause it’s all in the wrist
When developing relationships that don’t exist
You see, it’s all in the wrist
When developing relationships that don’t exist
Go and get your log on, uh huh huh
Come and get your log in
Go and get your log on, uh huh huh
Come and get your log in
Go and get your log on
So you can...

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
Friend request me, let’s get friendly
To send me MP3’s then text me
So let’s see: how’s your clique in high school
Well let’s see, just click your high school
Choose a name if it requires one
You don’t wanna be a twit, pick the right one
Use your name as a username that you can change
There’s a quick fix on iPhone for that
It’s so apparent when you vent
Cause if you’re afraid of spiders, you should share it on the web
Karen has just sent you a marriage by request
Plus there is an event to tag you there if you accept
Stare into the center of the monitor you have
And add them as a friend so you can monitor them back
Log on and count up all the followers you have
But who’s leading who when you’re still following them back, like that

[Hook: SeezMics]

[Verse 3: DOOD Computer]
Live in a place where there’s no thumbs down
And you getting hash tag daps, digital pounds
If you itching for validation, it can be found
Just make a comment on the climate of your city or town
And all of a sudden, everybody gather round
To rally behind the mundane complaint with a frown
It’s hindsight in real time, so you’re taken that pic down
Kick the photo-bucket, photo-shop it, you’re slick now
Cause they don’t really know you in real life
So be to them the way you see yourself on the inside
Right, you’re a special little snowflake
Right click and save when you locate your soul mate
And hope that they don’t hate receiving drunken tweets
Or noticing that you became the mayor of their street
It’s never been so easy to become a creep
It’s the facial recognition generation, text in peace
