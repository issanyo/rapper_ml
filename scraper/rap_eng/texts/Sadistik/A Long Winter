[Hook: Ceschi]
This winter lasted far too long
All that we loved sunk into fog
If one day without rain could come
To just make way for warmth of sun

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
What if every drop of rain's a letter from the sky
And they each concealed a message if you read it you could fly
Who would send it would you bet that it was God?
Cause it doesn't really matter if it's met with an applause
It's a testament of flaws I'll sit and face the skies now
Empathize with rain to anticipate the ride down
To find out how they dance between the paper stars
To embrace the dark before they inundate the night's clouds
Now that's an optimistic view
I can script a musical while options are reviewed
Pieces of me tend to die but I can miss the funeral
I fall into the view that my life is simply beautiful

[Hook: Ceschi]
This winter lasted far too long
All that we loved sunk into fog
If one day without rain could come
To just make way for warmth of sun

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
I try to find a pattern in the fallen leaves I walk in
But I can't find if I'm inside an autumn breeze or coffin
All I see is dark when you own both these irises
I attempt to bite my lips but all my teeth are sharpened
It's like I like to like to fight the sight that I've become
Like I like to like to find the night inside the sun
Like I tried to write the side of life that I've abided by
And by and by I strive to find a sign that I'm in love
Love is what you find when you're circling the sky
While you're burning all the white feathers learning how to fly
Searching for a sign or a version of goodbye
That could perfectly describe what was pertinent inside
I'm not certain but if I'm a brushstroke on the canvas
I'm scratching all my love notes on a matchstick
And when it catches the smoke becomes letters
And it floats on forever 'til the sun grows romantic

[Hook: Ceschi]
This winter lasted far too long
All that we loved sunk into fog
If one day without rain could come
To just make way for warmth of sun

If you are what you eat then I will eat my heart out
And wear it on my sleeve so it matches my apparel
Up the other is a sample from the tarot
So I can cheat destiny and gamble with the arrows
That they sling when I quiver in their wake up in a blizzard when I shiver and I shake
Love like a sinner when it's grimmer and I play
Tough to be delivered from this winter
Another night of wondering if it's the age of innocence
I'll plead the fifth right before I take a sip from it
I'll cease desist and try to break the dissonance
From the demon's lips just so I can make a difference
In this day without the rain
The sky is sapphire leaving traces of the stains on my skin
I'll never say it was in vain
I'll just hold my breath and pray that I can savor it again

[Hook: Ceschi]
