[Verse 1: Sadistik]
I’ve been dancing on the quicksand for one too many moments
Swallowing the sunshine and company I’ve chosen
Is the company of wolves, underneath their clothing
They just hide their sheepish smiles that are sunk beneath the ocean
With the chitty-chitty bang bang, pretty city same pain
Do I? Did he? Witty, will he really let his fangs hang?
Amen, ’cause that statement’s all but obvious
And all I want to know is what it takes to show my godliness
I’m defacing all the monuments
In this lonely desert, there’s no trace of Ozymandias
And I don’t know how many people catch the references
Caught up in the revelry but still they lack the reverence
Of standards like my skeletons or craft the saddest elegance
‘Cause I can sink tsunamis that could probably crack the sediment
And this is just an open, drunken, broken, sunken nothing
Hoping that I’m something when the Reaper comes to sow
Secrets of my soul are simply jagged
Little pieces that’ll finally show the truth if I can match it
In a sequence, and they tell me that my eyes are simply windows to the soul
But my window panes are only pain…here we go
This is where you listen close, anaconda grips the throat
Dancing with the devil and he’s stepping on my mistletoes
I’d give control if you can tell me it’ll be alright
‘Cause nothing ever lives and no one ever really dies

[Hook: Louise Fraser]
I see the past in your eyes
Drift by like rain clouds in the sky
Wondering how you can turn back time
Trying to leave your past behind

The rain that falls on your face
Washing away the tears that trace
I can't see if I’m a sacred place
Hidden in somewhere safe

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
I’m over-pessimistic in this slumbered frame of mind
Even rainbows are just another bank to climb
Another waste of time, that I feel but can’t kiss
I feel like Atlas when the thunder breaks my spine
I’ve spent eleven hours sinking in the mud
And all I’ve done is paint your facial features with my blood
‘Cause I’ve wasted half my life thinking I’m in love
But it was just the side-effects of breathing ether in my lungs (yes)
Man bites dog, gnaws his hands right off y’all
Just can’t fight off all of mankind’s flaws, call
Me atheist, a satanist or anti-god while
I’ll wait for this so place your bets ’til landslide fall off (?)
And I’ll watch…while the innocent shatters
The Phoenix never comes to be risen from ashes
We’re all gone but there isn’t a rapture
And everything you loved was just visions of grandeur
So I go to sleep (sleep), listen inactively
To my heart beat (beat), is it a masterpiece?
Or fool’s gold, is feeling so cheap
There’s more than one way to go to and skin a catastrophe
And actually, when the rose is red and caustic
I’m just feeling like I’m frozen in these old, synthetic topics
Where I’m dealing with the copacetic, open-ended logic
That no one ever dies even though our flesh is tarnished

[Hook: Louise Fraser]
I see the past in your eyes
Drift by like rain clouds in the sky
Wondering how you can turn back time
Trying to leave your past behind

The rain that falls on your face
Washing away the tears that trace
I can't see if I’m a sacred place
Hidden in somewhere safe

[Hook: Louise Fraser]
I see the past in your eyes
Drift by like rain clouds in the sky
Wondering how you can turn back time
Trying to leave your past behind

The rain that falls on your face
Washing away the tears that trace
I can't see if I’m a sacred place
Hidden in somewhere safe
