[Verse 1]
Yeah I sit beneath a plaster moon
Puff puff pass the gloom and watch the ashes bloom
Black balloons float above me singing saddest tunes
Like no one loves me but that can't be true
I never show my ugly attributes, I'd rather choose
To expose my sunny plastic moods, so after you
I know that crummy sulken frumpy, oh-so-grumpy attitude
Over something nobody can have but you

[Bridge X5]
You're such a mess
And plus your nose is bloody

[Hook x2]
Does anybody ever really want to know why I
Always leave the party when we say bye-bye
With a cyanide taste and a mai tai chase
And another trail of blood when the pipeline breaks
And she's always got to listen to the rhythm of the wicked
When I give her my attention try to fix it but the fix is
Just a little bigger litter better little more to benefit
An addict when I can't afford the habit that you chose

[Verse 2]
Yea you wait in line to take a line
A powdered nose and some make-up might erase the strife
So take your time wait until you taste the sky
To take your flight cloudy headed let it fade to white
I'd wake up night after night after night
While you'd take another line after line after line
Little little lovable drift into this puff of smoke
Something so innocent is getting into such a hole
Yea you huff and blow to huff some blow
Lovely Snow White why'd I find your touch so cold
You look so comfortable but pretty with your bloody nose
And you're still thinking that nobody knows
You're such a mess

[Hook]

[Outro X9]
Sleep back to back in the shape of a butterfly
Another sign that it's time to tell my lover bye
