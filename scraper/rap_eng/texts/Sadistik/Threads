[Sadistik]
She hates to play alive
Fading in 5 out since '85
Sanctified by the H inside
Maybe he can save us
Sheâ€™s praying to a savior
That just
Gave her all the fake
Facades
Tracing through her veins
That are stained
With the taste of god
Tell me have you died today?
Did you find a way?

To push the daisies in a
Place that you could
Hideaway?

Or Did you write the way to
Hell across a crying face?
Maps made of mascara
Masquerading mask era
Are you terrified to join
Them love?

Are you embarrassed by the
Lies, or just enjoy the
Rush?

You still avoid the touch?
Too disappointed huh?
There's no salvation in a
Haven where the poison numbs
Still the Angels take you up
On high
One day they're not gonna
Bring you back
MIt's not worth it for a
Couple highs
We're all tied by a single
Thread
They'll discard you like a
Cigarette but
Tell me are you pretty yet?
Or is it just regret?
Does seeing bones in
Reflections make you
Innocent?

Are you the skinniest yet or
Just the closest to?

A little death Petite Mort
For the chosen few
I brought a rose for you
It's soaked in vinegar
I tied it to a thread, you
Go to binge 6 purge
You take me prisoner, you
Make my center burn
But you'll never learn at
All, I know that's just your
Signature
