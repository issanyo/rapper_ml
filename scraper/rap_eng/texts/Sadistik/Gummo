[Verse 1]
Honestly, I'm as hollow as a zombie seems
Autumn leaves have fallen, but this fall is full of somber things
I saw a dream as I wandered where a pond’s beneath
I wanna sink, but the bottom of it’s not in reach
I’m on a beach walking towards the waves, rocks in jeans
Virginia Woolf felt these pocket seams
The hallows sing like it’s Halloween
Howling, Hallow’s Eve's
Themes that the shallow breeds scream in a harmony
Authoring includes dotting I’s and crossing T's
For a biography hollow eyes don’t wanna read
I sharpen teeth on their hearts until applause is reached
I’m not a king in this kingdom full of novelty

[Hook: Yes Alexander]
Moonchild, do you dream about me?
When you want to go deeper, won’t you feel my reaper?
In your chest, as you breathe
Suffocating your soul
Why keep your dreams in me

[Verse 2]
Honestly, I'm a part of all the wrong I see
Wanna see God, I hope the opposite of God is not in me
I ponder deep thoughts and want 'em free
Monitoring a heart that beats off the beaten path of sovereignty
I gotta sing in proper keys to get the proper keys
Open locks with these, bada-bing im in and then I’m off to sleep
All I see’s an odyssey of odder scenes
Odd, it seems so obvious this audience is not for me
Monsters seem to offer me some awful dreams
I’m Harmony Korine meets a darker being it seems
I walk discreet to not be seen by gossip queens
When this author needs to polish off a vodka shot or three
Noddin' off and weak, marijuana leaves, ganja trees
Pot or weed, anything you wanna call it’s peace
Just as long as this solace keeps
I’m not complete ‘til the songs I sing resolve the grief
It’s a cacophony, properly, problem need to pop a b-
Lood vessel, stressful when I cop a plea
Apostrophe, claims ownership of property
Probably I’ll never know, cause it’s not my thing
I gotta leave

[Hook]

[Outro]
Life is beautiful
Really, it is
Full of beauty and illusions
Life is great
Without it, you’d be dead
