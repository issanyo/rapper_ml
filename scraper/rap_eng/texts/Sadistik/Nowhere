[Intro]
I'm feeling so Jodorowsky today man

[Verse 1]
Someone inject me with the venom from the jaws of iron, God-defyin'
They said I'm on the cross to die–Pontius Pilate
That's the judge jury, injury, there's no hung jury
Hungry for the bloodlust, so hush-hush
I'm a pushover, it's a domino effect
If you, think it's a game I'll put you collarbones in check
I need Bacardi Gold when I hear my cardio, a card'll go
Up my sleeve, walk into the carnival
Vámanos
A mi barrio sigue
Préndelo yo sobre todo
Adíos debase
Yeah my audios debase, but I don't need a language change
To explain they ape each other, all I see's orangutans
Bangers bang in the brain, it's all a sea of 808s
I'm from the state of rain, but I don't reign my state, wait
I lost my mind, when I went searching for a soul tonight
I came up empty-handed when I learnt to play a role and take it slow

[Hook]
I’m going slower
Frozen in a coma
I’m going nowhere
I know it, I know it

[Verse 2]
When I'm 38 I hope I'm a special
Son-of-a-gun, jumpin' the gun so disheveled
Holdin' shovels, diggin' holes with roses, settled
With dumb hoes I used to know, but now those are echoes
In this Mariana Trench
Now I won't carry on the stench
Of the carry-on you're carrying at your very own request
You're a parasite in my eyes, a burial is next motherfucker
Hiding the monsters under covers
Undercover girl, cover up, everyone's a shutterbug
And I'm so underground, I'm C.H.U.D
Watch me make a puddle out your blood, umbrellas up above (acid rain, dancer)
Plaster matter, mask-making Mad Hatter patterns
Breaking at an addict at his lowest point and full of opioids
A poster boy, ego destroyed
Or maybe that's just schadenfreude or a shout to Freud, I'll take it slow

[Hook]

[Outro]
"November Graveyard"

So no dead men’s cries, flower forget-me-nots between the stones
Paving this grave ground. Here’s honest rot
To unpick the elaborate heart, pare bone
Free of the fictive vein. When one stark skeleton
Bulks real, all saints’ tongues fall quiet:
Flies watch no resurrections in the sun

Stare, stare
Till your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind:
Rave on the leash of the starving mind
The blank, untenanted air
