[Verse 1]
Amass a massacre pupils adjust the aperture
My castle's Dracula brutal with just vernacular
Hands are tarantulas scapulas spread my angel wings
Halo rings are bullet holes I made to sing
Marijuana I'm on has got me neurotic
It’s awfully demonic even the odds I'm oxymoronic
My Rottie up on the ottoman odd I'm inside a burning bush
That's purple Kush it's got me talking to god

[Hook]
My mentality’s kill or be
I hide in my honeycomb

[Verse 2]
Conscious of anacondas and monsters inside my closet
My concentrations methodic a constant state of a conflict
Accommodate ‘em with coffins
It's complicating my conscience
Haunted on occasion and congregating with convents
Which is is witches? Wicked Wiccans I've weakened
On weekends we light the wick on the spliff
And split it with demons
I'm fiending the evening's evil
These people whisper their secrets
I seek written upheavals to burn churches and steeples, yea

[Hook]
My mentality’s kill or be
I hide in my honeycomb

[Verse 3]
It's not paranoia if you're right clairvoyant inner minds
Smoke a half kill the nerves stare in voids to feel the high
I'm a sinner but my center's fine sipping wine with dinner
It's divine keep it cheap I'm not the vintage type
Don't ask again bitch I said I'm fine
Don't be a witch or you’ll get set on fire, get left to dry
When I exorcise this head of mine
My flesh feels like it's petrified
Identify their bodies by the teeth now come and testify

[Hook]
My mentality’s kill or be
I hide in my honeycomb

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
My mentality’s kill or be I hide in my honeycomb
Surrounded by killer bees so I keep a gun at home
Like bang stay out of my comfort zone
Yea leave me the fuck alone

[Outro]
From way up here on setting suns
I hope I fall and that I land on everyone I know
I hope they die cause so will I
I’m selfish and I’m small like everyone I know
I don’t want to go outside today
I don’t want to have to lie today
Either way it’s tidal waves I know
I’ll hideaway I’ll hideaway I’ll hideaway
