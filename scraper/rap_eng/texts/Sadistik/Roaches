[Intro]
Turn a blunt into a roach in a hundred feet of snow
Turn a blunt into a roach in a hundred feet of snow

[Verse 1]
They testify that the dead can rise
Pests and flies get the pesticides
I'm pessimistic pestilent since
The lightning bugs went electrified
Tried to run like insects in light
A nest that's tired unless it's tied to the
Hive mentality my finale seems dire
Why are we fine with the agony?
(And I know) I'm not storm chasing with wrong sails
(And I know) I got short patience for tall-tales
Ah hell it never rains, it's all hail
That's heavy rain on everything no heaven reigns yet all hail

[Hook]
It's a nuclear winter
(The roaches all around me, roaches all around)
It's a nuclear winter
(The roaches all around me, roaches all around)
It's a nuclear winter
(The roaches all around me, roaches all around)
It's a nuclear winter
(The roaches all around me, roaches all around)


[Verse 2]
I see fantasies of my own demise
Ants and fleas in my lonely nights
Maggots in my haggard skin
Mantises in Cody's eyes
In passages I co-designed
Abdomen, thorax and head
Stab 'em with a tack or pin
Then resurrect me like Lazarus
Watch the locusts sink in my heart
Cockroaches think that they're gods
But the insects don't impress
I dissect their midsect
I find death in the sterile things
Bury me in kerosene
Get soaked in blood like a Carrie scene
Now open up for those roaches

[Hook]
It's a nuclear winter
(The roaches all around me, roaches all around)
It's a nuclear winter
(The roaches all around me, roaches all around)
It's a nuclear winter
(The roaches all around me, roaches all around)
It's a nuclear winter
(The roaches all around me, roaches all around)

[Outro]
??The world like you never know, until it approaches and now you begin to understand. There is something worse, there is something that hell itself is going to be cast into. There is that final judgement, those are hanged at the cross, those hailed in the nails.?? [???]
