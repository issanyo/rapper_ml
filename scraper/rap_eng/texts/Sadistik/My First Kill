[Hook: Onry Ozzborn + Sadistik]
Sentimental sediments exempt
Everything that's said is being held in contempt
Better off conveying messages on old film
Pandemonium inherited is my ill
Do with it what you will
Yeah, they don't listen to my dreams
So I'm kill 'em in their sleep and leave 'em victims in a heap
Yeah, they don't listen to my dreams
So I'm kill 'em in their sleep and leave 'em victims
Observe my first kill

[Verse 1: Onry Ozzborn]
Those that hold me close and dear to them are almost like my children
'Cause I owe them everything beneath the ceiling
Stars and space amongst [?] room for more to be bored
Ordinary orbiting and flickering through feelings
The extraordinary thing about the human race
Is nobody has won but been running ever since the gun
Ribbon awaiting them patiently but nowhere in sight
So spectators begin to twiddle every thumb
The one of 'em becomes the invention of gossip and lore
Tall tales adding on to a story 'til it is something more (true)
Median day in the galaxy closes in as we lose touch with gravity
Become vertigo as we spin
This common sense not farfetched and anyway
Just a glimpse of a baby's first breath all the way to its grave
A game of life played by characters from The Dirt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
It's worse than winning a purse

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
Seattle days, addled and dazed
Always gray, no way out of the maze
Oh wait, how did it taste, the medicine that you forced in?
My throat, I choked broke like porcelain
Oh, they poke needles into sore skin
And space out, chase down endorphins
All their teeth look like some herring bones
Skin so transparent, I can see into the varicose
I hide for days, no clientele lately
Still finding ways to drive myself crazy
Crazy like the gods, crazy like a mob
Crazy like a fox, crazy from [?] place into my palm, yup!
So I refrain, no I refrains
Just Irish whiskey in my icy veins
A black heart in an ivory frame is what I became
That spark lights the flame, bang!
