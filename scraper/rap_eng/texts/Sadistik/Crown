[Hook]
My heart is bursting
My head is a hole now
The lines are twisting
And I want more

[Verse 1]
How’d I get so narcissistic?
Everything feels artificial
All my skin’s turned inside out
Fishing hook all in my mouth
Wishing well stalling my doubts
Apparitions haunting my house
Wendigo’s don’t know when to go
And no heaven knows if I’ll sink
Inside the reaches of Kingdom Come
Blind preacher told me that Jesus loves
My teachers made me grind teeth to dust
I think, that I I think too much
If I think too much then I can’t sleep
If I sleep too much then I can’t smoke
If I smoke too much then I can’t dream
Then I can’t see my father
He said don't you see that you're my boy
Afloat at sea on a search for buoys
In drowning pools, sounds are mute
Sirens sing surrounding you
No time for Kings, no fountained youth
Those minor keys I found in you
Grew out of tune, too out of view
Unatoned, don't sound attuned
I'm so out of it, they so counterfeit
I can't even count the fits
Leeches adorn my outer rim
Made a ring of thorns, no crown would fit
I don’t wear it out, It’ll wear it out
It’s whereabouts clandestine, guess it’s paramount
Heavy is the head that bears the crown

[Hook]
My heart is bursting
My head is a hole now
The lines are twisting
And I want more

[Verse 2]
How’d I get so narcissistic
Everything feels artificial
All my skins reptilian
Left in rough dominions
I bet my blood’s vermilion
Dead head above 4 living limbs
I’m villainous, obsidian
I’ll burn a bridge then build again
I wish, these wishing wells
Were filled with those who wished me well
I mix my woes with whiskey well
Well whiskey whisks me whimsically
I disagree with the parrot crowd
Spinning carbons on carousels
Skinny, living like caracals
Heavy is the head that bears the crown
