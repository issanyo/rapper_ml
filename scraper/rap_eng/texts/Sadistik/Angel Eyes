Try to find a place in lines that I embrace
While I strive to find a balance between a time and space
In a microphone.. When I'm soundin' intense
I feel like 'Pac on his hospital bed, countin' his breaths
And they still say, Ill never blow on the mic
Unless I spit a gimmick with some clever jokes cus I'm white
Im forced to listen to critics just chatter they teeth
With all their bullshit opinions like it matters to me
And my closest friends stumble as they mumble and doubt me
While I try to hold the world as it crumbles around me
Feel my lungs close, strain harder for breaths
As the broken dreams I have match the heart in my chest
And the pressure builds But without a release
I know that ya hope floats, but its out of my reach
I'm tired of the masks that we wear (if only)
You saw my true self you'd be scared (to know me)
But now I finally see what I love is worthless
Beauty's skin deep, but its just a surface
My shoulders are breaking and my focus is hazy
Plus my teeth are chipped from biting all the bullets that you gave me
In the form of lies, and I mistook it as honest
Took the good with the losses, til the good was just lost, its
Hard to hold the burdens until my shoulders bleed
I was forced to flee, until I learned to fly with broken wings
Across the visions of feelin's and all this violent livin'
Of a fucked up system insistin' that I should try to fit in
But now I can see I'm unrelated to you
Cus I took off the mask that suffocated the truth
(If Life) could even worsen, (Then Id) release my burden
(And try) to be the person, (Who writes) and speaks in perfect
(Advice) for people hurtin', (Who cries) and fiends for nursing
(And time) would be asserted, (To find) a decent purpose
(But I) am weak and burdened, (I cry) and seek alertness
(In life) to be the person, (Who's lines) are seen as perfect
(I try) and seem so nervous, (That life) has demons lurkin'
(That I) defeat the purpose, (And Life) is seen as worthless

Watch everyday just pass me by
Slowly corroding and acting fine
Suffocating on this mask of mine
Til I run out of breath and I can't survive
Repeat x2

Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth
Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth
Through my angel eyes I see the devil's truth
Through my angel eyes I see
(Repeat x 4)

I need to get a piece of inhibition (First!)
And speak another piece of bitter vision (Words!)
And get a better syndicate of vindicated few
And I better never let another mitigate the truth
Cus I'm the better, never get a flow with flaw
Better with the letters, veteran know it all
Talk a lot in a song, better hold em off
I thought I was lost, never fold or fall
If I could ever get a minute trying to be
My life independent when I'm dying in peace
I might get a sentiment I write to a beat
My mind of a veteran, trying to see
That life's beautiful, suitable to let go
Of anything and Ill just survive through it all
Inner lines intertwined, my mind is livin' life
Grippin' mics, livin' life in trife its live and die
