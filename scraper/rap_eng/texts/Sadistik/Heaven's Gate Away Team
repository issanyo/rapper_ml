[Verse 1]
Phenobarbital mixed with apple sauce and vodka
Who needs rationale when they ration out the dogma
Promises of gods in their passages of karma
Mr. Applewhite can turn the average to a martyr
Purple jumpsuits with the patches on the left
39 aftermaths happened in those beds
39 had to gasp canceling their breath
From the 39 plastic bags wrapped around their heads
Deliver us from deliverance
Gimme gimme love or barbiturates
Itchy trigger fingers going numb from the bitterness
They said I'll never fade
Just enter Heavenâ€™s Gate

[Hook]
The truth is always hiding in the darkest spot
And you could probably find it where the monsters are
Billions of people follow the same dream
Save me from Heaven's Gate Away Team
The truth is always hiding in the darkest spot
And you could probably find it where the monsters are
Billions of people follow the same dream
Save me from Heaven's Gate Away Team

[Verse 2]
I am not a god, I am not Allah
I am not of law, I will not applaud
I am violent, I am not to laud
Nodding off, flying higher than the cosmonauts
Write it like Nabokov, light it like a Molotov
We tried to call to arms confide and watch the stars
We lied and crossed our hearts to promise we'd be different
Threw our sins at God in synagogues, in a fog of demagogues
Get macabre and substitute a slaughter for religion
Yea we say it's not of our volition
Then call on God to fix it but it's fiction
Crucifixion, dying off just to conquer our addictions
Dyatlov pass incident lost in our own winters
They wait in vain for a cosmic intervention
And save the pain just to lock it in a prison
I stay awake with the monsters I've been given
They said I'll never fade
Just enter Heaven's Gate

[Hook]
The truth is always hiding in the darkest spot
And you could probably find it where the monsters are
Billions of people follow the same dream
Save me from Heaven's Gate Away Team
The truth is always hiding in the darkest spot
And you could probably find it where the monsters are
Billions of people follow the same dream
Save me from Heaven's Gate Away Team

[Outro]
Now, the only time we have an opportunity to leave the human kingdom and go to the Kingdom Level Above Human, is when there is a Member from that Kingdom Level, incarnate in human form, saying to you, "I'll tell you about a Kingdom Level beyond here, and if you want to go there then you have to follow me, because I am the guy who's got the key at the moment
