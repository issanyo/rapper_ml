[Hook]
In heaven everything is fine, in heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine, in heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine, in heaven everything is fine
In heaven...

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Last night I found a lady in the radiator
She sings me hate songs, pays me to satiate her
I stayed awake, masqueraded a mask that made her more terrified
A pair of eyes appear disguised
I take flight and stay high in paradise
With bad luck snake eyes a pair of dice
I'm paralyzed, she speaks twice, a pair of lies
It's parallel, apparent hell of parasites
I wanna make her dead, I'll draw her body then Erase her head
People will do anything to pay the rent
I make amends, the Maker mends, I make up friends
I play pretend, 808's and radiate
The rainy days can't faze me, yeah
Don't let em say I'm crazy, nah
I'm a pariah that's lighting fires on bridges
The eye of Osiris hides in my visions why go to heaven now?

[Hook]
In heaven everything is fine, in heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine, in heaven everything is fine
In heaven...

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
Last night I found a lady in the radiator
She said we're alike, maybe I can stay forever
I traced her face with razor blades to paint away
The stains I made with red blues and hues
The fuchsia maroon rouge, the set fuse and bruises
The noose fits her neck, exit wounds are left
Her words are gory this purgatory is perfect for me
A search for glory has turned to mourning at night, I
Listen to God when the liturgy calls
She lives in the wall, I kiss her 'till the misery's gone
Her ministry's all I listen to I give it my all
A physical bond addicted to the skin of Allah
I get lost in thought until I'm numb and feel the terror forming
They get lost in thought because it's unfamiliar territory
I buried warnings in Terra Firma and allegories
To get to Heaven we went through Hell and shared the story

[Hook]
In heaven everything is fine, in heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine, in heaven everything is fine
In heaven...

[Outro: Kno]
In heaven, everything is fine
In heaven, I will make you mine
In heaven, I am on my way
To heaven, but they won't let me stay
In heaven
