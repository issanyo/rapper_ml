It's beautiful when the sky is made of blue
And my eyes follow suit as I try to paint the hue
I embrace the view, with my arms wide open
A heart I've broken and a mind that stays in gloom
Cus every single love is a piece I have to carry
On a back that feels broken in a sleepless January
Even when the seasons change into freezing rain
I won't be afraid, cus I'm leaving Canterbury
I walk a path that's been painted with the frozen rain
Whispers in the wind are still praying that it snows again
And even then I'm still chasing an emotion when/
I'm searching for some beautiful but saying that I'm so content
The ghosts pretend and they tell me that I'm different
Tell me I'm perfect, they tell me I'm significant
They tell me every single lie they conjure and barter
Because I am a monster
And everyone that I've ever loved is dead
They disappeared, and found a better one instead
And even though that December sun has set
I still read her lips, and I remember what it said
"You're not alone Cody, you're not alone
Just stay by my side and you'll see what grace provides"
I start to relish, she's archangellic
And when she tells it, I can see it's safe to fly
Into the wind with a murder of crows
So I can leave where I've been with the circle of vul-tures
To ascend with my personal goals
And I can sing to the dead 'til the surface unfolds... first
I'll sit and listen to the symphony
Mix it with my misery and kiss it til my lips will bleed
This is me, Mr. bare-boned winter
Who's been tracing footsteps where the scarecrows whisper
In a ear discreetly, still and calm with
Philharmonics, spoken crystal clear to teach me
And when the pistoleers defeat me
I'll just evanesce 'til I disappear completely
This is just a Monday night puppy love letter
To a cherub that's apparent when the things become better
If it's an angel with a subtle recoil
Then I can probably find an rainbow in a puddle of oil
When I surrender...

I watch the stars that illuminate the sky
Til I remunerate what the lunar state provides
And even when all that beauty-scape has died
I choose to wait until the weight accumulates inside
And soothes the aches... This is life beneath the monolith
Where I can seek a guide to see that I can reach the bottom with
The clocks will switch when the idle pieces ball to fists
Cuz all of this is just a wish that I could meet the dawn again (x3)

(At night I close my eyes)
And I pray for the sunset, wishing you were here so the day wasn't done yet
(At night I close my eyes)
When the light glares in, I'll just dream about you 'til the nightmares end
(At night I close my eyes)
And I pray for the sunset, wishing you were here so the day wasn't done yet
(At night I close my eyes)
When the light glares in, I'll just dream about you 'til the nightmares end

[Louise Fraser]
I never meant to release you, I never made out alive
I never meant just to tease you, I never meant you to cry
I never meant you to cry, I never meant you to cry
At night I close my eyes, to be with you
At night I close my eyes, just to see you again
At night I close my eyes, to be with you
At night I close my eyes, just to see you again
I'm in a rift without you, the sky is still blue
At night I close my eyes
I'm in a rift without you, the sky is still blue
At night I close my eyes...
