[Verse 1: Early Adopted]
I arrived
Not sure where I was
Been living in a fog and a buzz
Gotta’ come down at some point, that time was now
Prolonged realizing she ain’t around
And won’t be back
Didn’t wana’ face it
Or myself
Mirror disgraceful
Ain’t as easy to actually change
As it is to stand there and say it (look)
I got comfortable in a place that don’t make me comfortable
And I stayed untiI I wore my welcome out
Didn’t knock my boots on the mat when I came in the house
And I’m out
Took myself out of the element
Destination was irrelevant
Anywhere but here
I just promised myself that I won’t go to hell again (look)
Now I hear clearer like my ears just popped
Ever since I hopped on a plane and kissed my pops goodbye
Told me to work hard
Didn’t know what I was doing, but “good flight”
Salute
That same man told me sleep can wait
And being tired well, it ain’t a real thing
And when I take it into consideration and think
He’s right, don’t mean shit, in the grand scheme
Now I never I miss breakfast
Napkin tucked in my neck for when egg drips
Three drinks on me, etiquette
Coffee, the water, the o.j., refreshments (look)
I learned how to tame the air
After running against it for all these years
How to untie knots and set sail
I ain’t stopping until I hit new sands
Had to learn the Bowline after giving up on the Windsor
Come to think of it, never could tie that kind without the help of my father’s fingers
Think about destiny
And the definition
Then I remembered
A girl that once loved me
Told me, “You ain’t gonna’ get it,”
Unless you really want it
Then you ain’t gona’ see me in the ending!

[Chorus]
Came in alone
When you realize same way that you gona’ go
Don’t think that saying’s been true this whole time?
Who you think gona’ be there for you?
Who gona’ be there for you?
When all you have is yourself
Can’t depend on nobody else
Bite down on that smile
You see them teeth turn to dust?
Who you think gona’ be there for you?
Who gona’ be there for you?

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
Born alone
Die alone
Spine shivers like a vibraphone
Ants step into my ribosomes
Anne Sexton when she writes a poem
I roam (Rome)
Alone with the sharks
Loan sharks, holding my heart
Pull me apart
I can add up the atoms I'm sad, I'm a soul, living solely to part
A rose (rows)
Grows in the dark
Maybe it's fiction, I'm over that part
Pay me a visit, I'll take the prescription
I promise, make me your victim
Honest
I miss when I would swing for fun so free and callow
Now I'm Frida Khalo swinging from the gallows
Shiver me timbers, these are the frigid Decembers
The blizzards the winters, the winners of temperature drops
The bitter I've been in, the liver that spots, mineral loss
Their cinemas scripted, I've been here before
Having a curse with no visible cause
Since a consensus I've entered the storm
Cause’ that's what occurs when our chemicals cross
I'm up in arms, but not one to worship
Yea, some are serpents
Thousands
Steps to an undercurrent
A thousand deaths not one is current
Underserving, ugly person
Pretty poems, a diversion
Come to terms that I don't really know em’
I don't really owe em’
It's just a surface

[Chorus]
Came in alone
When you realize same way that you gona’ go
Don’t think that saying’s been true this whole time?
Who you think gona’ be there for you?
Who gona’ be there for you?
When all you have is yourself
Can’t depend on nobody else
Bite down on that smile
You see them teeth turn to dust?
Who you think gona’ be there for you?
Who gona’ be there for you?
