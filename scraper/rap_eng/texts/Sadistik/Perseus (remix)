Hook:

Keeping the snakes out of my circle
Keeping the saints out of my virtue
Keeping the strangers out of my personal space
Purseus, Perseus, Perseus, Perseus

Verse 1 (Sadistik):

My DNA’s a double helix
Looking like snakes fighting I can feel it
Bite like a Venus rise like a Phoenix
Reincarnation I die then repeat it
Yahweh I don’t play
Get the fuck out my face
Talk in tongues charm the, snakes
And watch your gods all rot away
Every morning check my garden guarding from the garters
Eat your heart out I’m an artist of the scars semi-auto demigods
Daughters of Darkness or martyrs for the pawns?
I’m a dog I’m appalled pallbearer for the lost
Make your own wave or drown in theirs
Fakes that role play are bound to perish
Fuck devotion with bows & prayers
Cut me open to count the layers
My stomach is always full of bile and wasps
The brain in my skull resembles a pile of asps
The rest of it looks like a pomegranate
Heavy handed both my palms are granite
To touch the throat of the odd & manic
Still cutting cobras like it’s automatic

Verse 2 (Slug Christ):

I just revved up the lawnmower
Snakes in the grass so ima mow it
I keep the Gualla on top of me
Jump in the wallaby, jump in the wallaby yea
Swallow me and you’ll start calling me honestly
I think you got a problem man
Aye I think I got a problem man
Off a couple of them Xans
Off the heroin again
What I’m off the heroin again
Young Slugga Slugga Perseus as fuck
Cut the pussy off like it’s nothing
Yea I got Medusa head on me
No I ain’t wearing no ‘sace
Slugger rounded up off a couple of them beans
Man Iike scream scream scream
Scream when they see me
Young Slugger glow it up
To bling, I’m too bling fuck none of y’all
Can’t fuck with y’all nah fuck y’all
