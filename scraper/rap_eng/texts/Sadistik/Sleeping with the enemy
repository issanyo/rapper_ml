I feel agoraphobic but reluctantly I stay the course
In this maze of thorns cause there's no way that I can circumvent it
It smells like Agent Orange in this place I'm headed
And I may regret it but I gotta do what makes me form
Counterfeited smiles enable me to find my breath
Painted in the fog that was labelled at the time of death
Of a recluse, tangled in a spider web
Why ingest halos when the fables that they write are dead?
Examine all the lines for an indication of the colors that were there inside another anecdote of time
Talons grow inside with these inattentive gazes till it changes from irrational to schizophrenic rages
When you're in a cage you forget how big the world can be
And when you're always bleeding you forget it's an emergency
It's a slow trip that can lose your hold quick
Questioning the purpose that's embedded in your circuitry
And then the water crystallises, it grows inside your chest until your heart’s of sickled ice
The world is an authentic made of artificial ties that were meant to cover gravestones, technicolor rainbows
Letters from an angel are freakin with my memories
Messing with my sheets cause I've been sleeping with the enemy
Under a secretive identity, I try to get away but she’s been leaking methamphetamines
Drip drip, lick lick, infect me with diseases
Feed me all your lies until you get me to believe it
Is this instance a part of lucid dreaming
Or just illusionary and they got you to believe it?
