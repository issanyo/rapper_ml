[Intro]
But now the nuptial bed is made
The dowry has been paid
The toothless, haggard features of...

[Hook]
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
We cut both of our palms and we made a pact
If you wanna know the odds you gotta take a chance
She's a praying mantis chewing on my praying hands
Pray tell, can you cage a man in brain-cells?
If we find our way to Hell we might not make it back
We break our backs till were breaking bad
If I can lose it I can take aback
Pacing back and forth to soothe it
Somehow the bruises always stayed intact
The trees burn together
Smoke plumes are soul food, we search the wreckage
I researched the letters
The love-notes that quote I'll be hers forever
We reach towards the center
Still waters run deep, sea floors a C4 agenda
Explosive, we form vendettas
A slave to the terror I'll be hers forever

[Hook]
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever

[Verse 2: Kno]
Her aura entered my core before I was 18
The sort of sordid disorder bordered in daydreams
The more that she tore at my flesh and bore through my chest
Seashore at my vest in crest via saline
Morbid confessions that seem to atone
Morbid ingestion of pills just to get her to leave me alone
See these feeble feelings seem teasing and easy to own
When those feelings are thrown cause your feet are in stone
I'm pitiful, sipping bourbon in an inner-tube
Trying to drown my sorrows in the shallowest of pity pools
Indeed I need the most minuscule of interludes
But my lungs keep me spun in a centrifuge
I been a sinner but even sinners deserve better
As the hint of her scent enters my nerve center
Independent events render my words tepid
I purge the first letter, I am hers forever

[Hook]
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
Hers forever, hers forever
Hers forever
