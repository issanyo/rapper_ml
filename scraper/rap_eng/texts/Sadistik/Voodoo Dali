[Verse 1]
My polar eyes are icy
They polarize what I see
While they deal lies I idealize
I know that I can die free
I know that we can die too
On any weekend I choose
In a weakened state we pray to him
Then we can state our praise in hymns
They hem and haw amen
Pay the Pentecost for our sins
It's Arsenic mixed with arson lit
Artifice carcasses so artific--
Don’t smite the tongue for you speak in them
Then bite the palm that they feed you with
Are you convinced of the Eucharist?
You can risk it all so the secrets kept, amen

[Verse 2]
Elegy readily telling elegant melodies
Yea my energy is inner chi hell is my enemy
Entities of inner peace appease the devil that entered me
Men are seen as menacing but they end up in entropy
Yea I’d let it be but I'm trapped with the centipedes
Bees in the trap claptrap rap's the revelry
They're wrapped in plaster plastered rapt by rapture
Cast in castor oil and cast beneath the casket soil
Into a mass grave that's what the mass crave
And not amass like a vast weight
Or a mast like a flag-state
More like a mass where they stand with their hands raised
That I pass with a masse
I don't care what the masks say
They all plastic, passive and passé's
Surpass past when I Plath pain, that's the campaign

[Hook]
Show me how all the martyrs did
Poke me now I don't want to live
Broke my crown on the stars
Holy vows a mirage
Know that man's not my father
Hold me down under water

Show me how all the martyrs did
Poke me now I don't want to live
Broke my crown on the stars
Holy vows a mirage
Know that man's not my father
Hold me down under water
