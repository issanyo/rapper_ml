[Verse 1]
I'm out the dark, somebody let some light in here
I light it with a lighter, I bring the fire here
Proceed Prometheus, high as the sky appears
My dog used to say hi right when the light appeared
But then he died... Now only I can hear
Lonely with ire some iron irises eyes are here
They match like, sisters in Shining stairs
Cut with the bicuspids, scissors incisor shears
I kissed her lips and left a blister
Bliss turned into miser-returned into twister
Twister turned to blizzard
Blizzard burned and turned to flood to wash away the winter
And since I've learned to search the mud & walked away the victor
And now so muddy, bloody
I'm nobody, with no buddies
Thorns grow with no budding
There's no sunny, just ho-humming
The low notes in solo, I'm so lone at home with no ghosts

[Hook](2x)
I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark
I'm out the dark, somebody let some light in here
I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark
I'm out the dark, I bring the fire here

[Verse 2]
I'm out the dark, fingers think they're spider limbs
Crawl around her body, sink inside her skin
They place their eggs inside, creating aches & sighs
Don't exorcise my demons make em extra-sized
They say the devil lies in scripture
I say the devil lies in scripture
So picture this image is grim but I can't say it's brightening
Although the lightless days are lightening
But not like light the way light lightning, strike!
More light lighten weight like lightening
I tried to sing imprisoned once, but that thought was for the birds
I wanted to be fly so I thought about the birds
Where will they be heading as they soared through the air?
I watched a beheading swing a sword through the heir
Acquiring the crown is a sordid affair
So I sorted through the fair and found a spark
I'm out of body, out of mind, I'mâ€¦

[Hook](2x)
I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark
I'm out the dark, somebody let some light in here
I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark
I'm out the dark, I bring the fire here
