[Intro:]
Uh
Yeah
Emancipator, yeah
Now follow me on this one
Yo

[Verse 1:]
My head aches, and feels the blunt vice grips
Hanging over my tequila sunrises
Confide and write this to de-scribe a love life
That's feeling love lifeless
I'm the type that'll cherish frozen winters
Stare at snowy blizzards and take it to heart
Then break it apart, I carry hopes and blisters
Cutting heart strings with a pair of broken scissors
I'm still trapped in a middle school slow dance
Stepping on toes in a mistletoe romance
Misanthrope, discomposed who holds hands
With grief...Kissing hope with no chance, but me
I'm just searching for some beautiful
A dream that I can catch And a person who's unusual
When I find her, I'll try to face the tide
Fight the hurricane, and tidal wave, goodbye

[Verse 2:]
And I watch all the spectrums of angels
Choking to death on the septums and halos
Bread crumbs and fables, why change?
I hang at the ends of the pay phone
With no change or number to reach
What blankets the sky I slumber beneath
Under the speech, this song's about hope, joy, love and defeat
All it takes is a peaceful autumn day
For you to be happy and me to call it fate
Even after a fucked up childhood, I'm still trying
To believe in God and grace
I try to get a piece of peace and sit and listen infinitely
Holding onto benefits, and isn't it so innocent?
We try to find another time and underline the cynical
Its pitiful we run and hide and under-mind the innermost
When intervals of miserable will find a figure four
And force the physical and inner soul to find a bitter form
And form another time and place where you can go and be so suitable
When all I wanna do is go and search for something beautiful, in me

[Outro:]
I died once, and I knew it was suitable
I died twice, and I sang it like a musical
I died again when I thought that the noose would hold
Everything I love on the search for some beautiful

I died once, and I knew it was suitable
I died twice, and I sang it like a musical
I died again when I thought that the noose would hold
Everything I love on the search for some beautiful

I'm just searching for some beautiful
Uh
Everything I love on the search for some beautiful
Yeah
Emancipator, uh

I died once, and I knew it was suitable
I died twice, and I sang it like a musical
I died again when I thought that the noose would hold
Everything I love on the search for some beautiful
