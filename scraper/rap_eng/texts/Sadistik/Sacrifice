[Verse 1]
I don't bow down to their idols
I won't kow-tow ’til I'm idle
When they countdown to The Bible
Then they found out that we're rivals
I know Revelations the devil made
Seven angels and seven plagues
Rivers all run red with blood
From hellish sun to Heaven’s Gate
They drink his wine in their processions
Then they sink inside of their own blessings
Guess that holy water wasn't meant for me
No those martyrs aren't dead for me
I told my mamma it’s destiny
We'll soar together and sort through winters
And so in turn it's soars and blisters from leprosy
They fall apart but they never see
Fall so hard just to follow arcs
Bawl so hard can you please remind me?
Why these tears are blinding
I can't see your light these
Peers of mine still think their fears will find me

[Hook]
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
No gods, I know no gods

[Verse 2]
Thirteen years old my soul was saved
I prayed to god the devil goes away
Never go astray when I know the way
Two wings bloomed from my shoulder blades
Too weak to get to hold the blade
And make a sacrifice but I won't obey
My woes can stay my own today
No mitosis psychosis won't let me
Call unto you... (Call unto you)
Hallelujah (Halleluja)
Don't go let that hollow lure you
Don't forget that solitude
They honor you with their presence
Then threaten you with his prescience
They bought all you with their presents
First they thread the needle then press in
Precious present day possessions
All answers no questions
All ants and no lessons
Less it's all hands on decadence
What's next to lend?
I don't wanna kill my next of kin
Or feel their fingers on my neck again
What'd I ex for lent? Your excellence
I'm dead come get it

[Hook]
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
No gods, I know no gods
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you
No gods, I know no gods
