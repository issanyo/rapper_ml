They fake but look real
They fake, they fake, they fake but look real
They fake, they fake, they fake but look real
They fake, they fake, they fake but look real
They fake, they fake, they fake but look real
Cubic zirconia, cubic zirconia, cubic zircon-
They fake but look real
Cubic zirconia, cubic zirconia, cubic zircon-

[Verse 1]
It's not a diamond if you have to flaunt it
Multifaceted, lacks a polish
Puzzled looks, I don’t have to solve them
Future's bright, my past is onyx
Yeah, sad is honest
Ignorance is bliss so, sad is honest
Have no high-notes, I lack the octaves
Turn laughs to cries those, raps to sonnets
I'm a cubic zirconia, such a cubic zirconia
Now I'm catatonic
I had a varnish but that got tarnished

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's not a diamond if it cracks on impact
It's a present to slide past the giftwrap
If it's a seven when dice land, you get craps
Future's high heaven and my past is pitch black
They put my lines and values
Under a microscope to find a value
Kaleidoscopic light astounds you
But won't change the pricetag I amount to
I'm a cubic zirconia, cubic zircone

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My father told me I would grow into a diamond
But since I've lost him, I don't know how to find it
I feel so unpolished, make me blindin'
In a lackluster world where nothing’s shinin'
I’ll rearrange these 26 while demons play a lovely bit
To eat away my ugly ‘til I see the day I love it, this
Is my certificate, my appraisal
If you never drop a gem, I’ll never never praise you
And so I’m thankful there’s nobody I’m chained to
Predators don't prey when there's nobody to pray to
Yeah, and then nobody can change you
Cubic zirconia, nobody can save you

[Hook]
