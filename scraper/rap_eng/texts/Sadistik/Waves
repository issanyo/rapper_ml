[Hook]
Coming in waves
All different colors and shapes up in my face
Flooded with hundreds of planes & none of em gray
Everyone's summer it's strange

[Verse 1]
I am pathetic, cause I'm empathetic
And hide in my head it's so minor
The mind of a skeptic, lights are synthetic
They're everywhere vital and hectic
The highest aesthetics, a life that's systemic
High-lows are leveled in vibrant falsettos
The tidals lack titles but I won't forget it, no I won't forget it
When I go to bed its so psychokinetic
I am antenna, ions and tenors
I'll light up the sky, like the eye of the nexus
Like Roman Polanski, I am The Tenant
To my own unconscious, I am dependent
Depends on perception, the pen can scripts tempests
My temper’s tempestuous, excellent sounds
If I don't swim right the riptide will drift like Virginia’s
I'll give in and then I’ma drown in the...

(Waves)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Animalistic, the phantoms are present
A precious example of tandem dimensions
My hands on a candle to cancel the shadows
That saddled my mental, a sad I'll admit to
A satellite signal emitting it's riveting
Stand at attention, the visuals vicious
My visions distorted this visage contorted
Of course it's a symptom I've been here before
7 billion people, 14 billion faces, I don't want to meet a one
I'd rather sit inside my tomb where I bloom & I ruminate
In a room with 8ths while the meter runs
Meet or run, watch the cumulus accumulate
Feel the rush, funerals accrue the weight
When I’m in a state I hope it's deep enough
When the season comes to pursue the chase
I'll take it there, and wait till they’re coming in waves

[Bridge]
I’m wavy, everything is blurry on the daily
I’m way beyond what they’ve been on
They basic while I’m wavy
