[Verse 1 - Sadistik]
How'd it get go disconcerted?
Why are they so picture perfect?
Maybe I'm just insecure
Or maybe they're just miniature
I'm a minotaur to ministers
My sins occur, I'm sinister
I'll sit and stir in spit and tar
Then forget my parts, it's been a blur
Artificial heart that I fiddled with 'till it ripped apart
It left some scars, scarlets and red
So I hit the spliff 'till I hit the stars...
I'm overhead.  Baby, I'm a galaxy
We're modern slaves, shackles on our hands and feet
Vagabonds on abandoned streets
Put acid on our past and dreams
I'm corroded, loaded, showed it when madness cross with insanity
Now how can it be? They're all cannibals
Who eat each other, like animals
Devoted...

[Hook - Rituals of Mine]
Proper longing, I'll be your devoted girl
The only
Proper longing, I'll be your devoted one
The only
For you
The only
For you

Proper longing, I'll be your devoted body
The only
Proper longing, I'll be your devoted one
The only
For you
The only
For you

But what did I expect
From you?
What did I expect
From you?

[Verse 2 - Kno]
The Lotus opens
I am provoked by the omens
I might have misspoke when I opened my throat & unloaded my motives
But I am devoted
I am the fly in your soup
I am the fire that cries on the roof
I am desire inside of a loop and in spite of my eyes I'm despising the truth
I am the side of your pride that resides in your cries as you writhe in a noose
I am devoted
Though I'm reloaded
The firing pin I slid in has been broken
The sigh from within I pretend to be noticed
The slightest of grins can extend my need's focus
The Siren of Sin you let in has been flirting
Waiting, Hoping, Preying
I cannot sway
Devoted

[Outro - Rituals of Mine]
And no one knows the night
No one knows
And no one knows the night
No one knows
'Cause no one knows the night
No one knows
No one knows the night
No one - no one knows

What did I expect
From you?
What did I expect
From you?
What did I expect
Expect?
Expect?
What did I expect
From you?
