[Verse 1]
First daddy died, then Mikey died
Why am I so dead inside?
Maggots filled this head of mine
My tongueâ€™s fly paper to catch the flies
I spit 'em out towards a wretched sky
Water tastes like insecticide
Watch it take out my sense of pride
It's a genocide of my gentle side
They so surgical with their masks
So I murder all in my path
No merciful in my wrath
I am a monster I can never be altered
Burning the altars
Watch 'em all perch with the vultures
Eating away
One day they'll all turn into sulfur

[Hook]
Dead in the head I was born like this, born like this
Dead in the head I was born like this, born like this
Dead in the head I was born like this, I was born like this
Dead in the head I was born like this

[Verse 2]
When they burned the bodies I smelled the smoke
From the hell below
Where they turned to zombies to sell their souls
To the highest bidder I'm high and bitter
In this crypt of mine no kryptonite
Just cryptic minds
Crimson-like when I draw the lines
A foggy life leaves me mystified
In this dream of mine full of Dramamine
Where I wanna sing but my screams are quiet
And my screams requite
Demons acquired
Deeming the choir all charlatans
Harlots in my audience
Watch the harlequins all get sawed to bits
Deadliness is next to godliness right?

[Hook]
Dead in the head I was born like this, I was born like this
Dead in the head I was born like this
Dead in the head I was born like this, I was born like this
Dead in the head I was born like this

[Verse 3]
Winter in Hell when the wind turns to hail
Hailed when they win, then wince when they fail
The wind in the sails all went to the sales
I'm assailing against them, scaling the fence with
Nails in the wrists, I'm impaled from the sales that they pitch
Which pales in comparison
Sinking again in the stale and the kitsch
Been drinking a fifth watching Tales From the Crypt
Yea I lift the bar
Never star-struck when I hit the stars
Never start something I can't complete
These heavy hearts hung in a gallery
These gallows swing, these gallows swing
They feed us shit like a Salo scene
These gallows swing, these gallows swing
Sparrows sing like they're caroling my god
They're as spooky as ever
More than you could imagine
Beautiful black bruises intact
Tactile abuse induce ipecac
A funeral mass I won't attend
I choose to be absent I don't pretend
And I don't believe in ghosts
But you could be that, yea, yea you could be that

[Outro]
(Spectres) Ghosts of themselves
But they chose it themselves
Made a home for the Hell
Keep my eyes low when I know they're around
(Spectres) Ghosts of themselves
But they chose it themselves
Made a home for the Hell
Keep my eyes low when I know they're around
(Spectres) Ghosts of themselves
But they chose it themselves
Made a home for the Hell
Keep my eyes low when I know they're around
(Spectres) Ghosts of themselves
But they chose it themselves
Made a home for the Hell
Keep my eyes low when I know...

(Dead in the head I was born like this, I was born like this)

Ghosts all around me
Go away
