[Intro]

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
My syllables convey this literal perfection
My physical and mental deliveral of the message
It's just like me, a heart of aggression
I'm stunned by a scene you are my reflection
Your beauty's incomparable, they still try to alter you
But you taught me through you can't stop the truth
When these fake kids spit, it splits my heart in two
I dedicate existence to be a part of you
It's through you I was shown the light
I write poems to you as I close my eyes
Ever since I was a kid I wanted clothes for pride
To represent struggle I have grown in spite
Of all these facades to get your profits
I'll survive with you, we all symbiotic
Your melodies is what I run to
I never loved anything like I love you

[Hook]
Hip Hop, just a new trend for some
Hip Hop, is the place where my script's begun
Hip Hop, when your face is speaking to tape decks (when you begin)
Hip Hop, real shit that can make you break necks
Hip Hop, just a new trend for some
Hip Hop, is the place where my script's begun
Hip Hop, when your face is speaking to tape decks (when you begin)
Hip Hop, real shit that can make you break necks

[Verse 2: PointGame]
Hip Hop changed the rapping game
With gats and language that
Leave people slain for whack
I came to rap, Game is the name to know
So which one of thou good lines will raise and float
Even though people know it was birthed to be
Entertainment, it has more worth to me
Inaccusibly voted by the streets
And chicks having to sneak to watch BET
Uncut, but my blood still pumps for reason
I'm sick of my art being nothing but beefin'
My heart be sore cause it came to love
Music on life support and they trying to yank the plug
Won't let it not happening again
Not as long as my notebook's having a pen
Matter of fact, if the ink drop, the better my memory
It's still Hip Hop because rap's my enemy

[Hook]
Hip Hop, just a new trend for some
Hip Hop, is the place where my script's begun
Hip Hop, when your face is speaking to tape decks (when you begin)
Hip Hop, real shit that can make you break necks
Hip Hop, just a new trend for some
Hip Hop, is the place where my script's begun
Hip Hop, when your face is speaking to tape decks (when you begin)
Hip Hop, real shit that can make you break necks

[Verse 3: Sadistik]
Our words spoken in rhythm, listen and chosen envisioned
I focus on hopelessness I'm holding when I spitting
You're just me but paragraphed in lead
Because the game gets me just like ? said
They can't understand all these passions I hold
Because these melodies are telling me they matching my soul
A blueprint of life, you show me the plan
But these whack-rap cats just don't understand
Adversity that certainly you've been through
No more handling these fallacies the truth is due
The truth can move up through an elevator
You've done all three to me see my love tells of fate
You Hip Hop are the love of my life
I'm gonna recite all your wonderful lines
The dust from my eyes is now removed
And now purpose of life I've found in you

[Hook]
Hip Hop, just a new trend for some
Hip Hop, is the place where my script's begun
Hip Hop, when your face is speaking to tape decks (when you begin)
Hip Hop, real shit that can make you break necks
Hip Hop, just a new trend for some
Hip Hop, is the place where my script's begun
Hip Hop, when your face is speaking to tape decks (when you begin)
Hip Hop, real shit that can make you break necks
