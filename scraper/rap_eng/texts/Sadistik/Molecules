[Verse 1: Sadistik]
The smoke looks like chemtrails every time I exhale
Entrails trail when I'm impaled
There's a red pale moon that I set sail to
Two sides when I lie on the bed nails
There’s bugs in the breadbox blades in my cereal
Trivial these days are arterial
Speak from the heart arterial
Art theory so ethereal star chart dreary
So hear me go so indigo in winter solstice
No Rigmarole just rigor mortis
Mix ‘em all with a warhead
Inner-torment intervals of misfortune
I’m in a different orbit
Bits of the pigeonhole I'm in is gorgeous
Never get into the fortress
Orchestras in my mind play a chorus
Paint a portrait emcee MC Escher
Go hand to hand then draw arms slow
Yea I got my lows I was high & dry
’Til the water rose now I water roses (Watch ‘em grow)
Every god I've known is dead
I walk alone instead
Steady monochrome I'm sketching
Sketchy scenes with no regrets bet
My eyes dialate
I'm leaving soon no dying late
I'm wide awake
To greet the moon with tidal waves
I'm just molecules in motion
A product of explosions in the sky
Find the stardust I'm composed of

[Hook: Terra Lopez]
These waves
Fuck up the unknown
These lines
Fuck up the unknown
Low

[Verse 2: P.O.S.]
I'm just, I'm just molecules in motion
I'm just, I’m just going through the motions
I'm just gliding, I'm just, I'm just flying by
I'm just riding my, homemade, handmade instrument
To guide me through the eye, hope to come out dry
Other Side, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just trying to find the words
Trying to lose 'em in the curves
Trying to prove I'm not trying to prove shit
But that's absurd (true)
Was I trying to cast a spell for love
But tries a stretch
Didn't have the time for the witchy shit
Onto the next, never got a badge for patience, shit
Or really anything they ever make a badge about
But I never ever try to fit their vision
And that's really the only kind of shit I try to brag about

[Hook: Terra Lopez]
These waves
Fuck up the unknown
These lines
Fuck up the unknown
Low
