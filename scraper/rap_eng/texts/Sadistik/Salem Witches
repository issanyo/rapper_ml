[Hook] (x4)
Say it with us
(Burn it down)
Salem witches
(Burn it down)
Say it with us
(Burn it down)

[Verse 1]
You're stealing my high, killing my vibe
I cannot kill what I'm feeling inside
Villain for life, Lord of the Flies
King of the night, kingdom of spite
More of the blind leading the blind
Circle of fire, I'm feasting my eyes
Seek and you'll find, I dream I'm alive
There's gotta be more than this ceiling and blinds
I'm all in my head
But never ahead
So off with their heads
Took a shot in the dark and they offered me lead
Like I’ma make you immolate
On a stake pit of snakes
Watch 'em all disintegrate
Salem witch isn’t it great?

[Hook] (x4)
Say it with us
(Burn it down)
Salem witches
(Burn it down)
Say it with us
(Burn it down)

[Verse 2]
Fire the liars, I'm high off the toxins
Light to a moth, flies to a carcass
These are the parts that I hide in my cartilage
Starter kit to carcinogens
When our religions’s art and sin
Artisan of darkness, a heart with pins
Pick apart our symptoms chart the difference
Char who's different and charge admission
I'm necromancer, high as fuck watching Nekromantik
Cut the lights for the Devils magic
Blood of Christ, let's get romantic
Kept my anger, Kenneth Anger
Anchored down by my bangles drowned in the banks
Ain't heard the angels now
They earned all their urns, I’ma take em out
Like it's eeny-meeny-miney-moe
Feed me any type of dope
Life is cold but I can cope
There’s ice inside my isotopes
So where did all the air go?
Ergo I'm a scarecrow
Heart on my arm compliments my apparel
Lost in the marrow; lock, stock and barrel
Bare all 'till it's off to the Pharaohs
(Rose) Rosemary's baby in blackest of bassinets
(Souls) Souls burried deep in the casket, I asked for it
How many times can a man shake the hand of a mannequin?
Plastic abandon the sacrament
Out of it, adamant, animate, acidic
Any old adjective turn 'em to ash for it

[Hook] (x2)
Say it with us (life from the other side)
(Burn it down)
Salem witches (light can become a fire)
(Burn it down)
Say it with us (like die motherfucker, die)
(In a blind world it's an eye for another eye)
In a blind world it's an eye for another eye
Eye for another eye, eye for another eye
Eye for another eye
In a blind world it's an eye for another eye
Eye for another eye, eye for another eye
Eye for another eye
In a blind world it's an eye for another eye
