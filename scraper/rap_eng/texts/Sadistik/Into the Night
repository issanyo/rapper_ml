[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Cracked ribs from the hugs that you gave me
A sad grin from the love that you’d take
The mask fits so snug and so safely
When I can't live with the sum of mistakes
Somehow, you turn silence to symphonies
Violence to riveting and moments to years
Or so it appears, when the lights of the city gleam
I can do anything
Noah’s Ark, save me from open-heart mania
Going dark slowly like Joan of Arcadia
Maybe the blowing star’s home is my savior
That I sing to through my pulled apart trachea
Fist-fight just to feel the touch
Alcohol doesn't heal the cuts
Needle for the heroin, feel the rush
There's no hero for this heroine
Just... Us
