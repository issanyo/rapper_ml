[Verse 1]
So much to say, don’t know where to start
I bared my heart to the bears
Then buried it in the barracks
In the most barren part I could bare
I'm Baron Blood, Lone Wolf and Cub
Barely inspired by swollen cuts
They'll soak it up I'll sulk in ruts
This attitude just won't adjust
We go for broke cause we're broken
Light hurt my eyes so I sewed em shut
Pearl inside but won't open up
Turpentine in that ocean front
Let's burn alive ’til the smoke erupts
Turn the skies into poems
Once I paint my paper thin vacant skin
And get estranged again
How strange it is how strangers live
Their wrists injected with save-me-quicks
I risked my neck then they strangled it
Irises left in my tangled limbs
Mangled by my state of mind
Dangled by widow's spiderwebs
Anchors tied to my ankle sides
Halos lie where those liars slept
Let's walk to where all the Angels hide
Kill a cherub, call it angelcide
Why sell him a fate, of a lake of fire
I'll self-immolate those flames are mine
They take a tithe, we pay the price
Want my advice? Don't want a vice
Save us from our saviors
When they sanctify the same they curse

[Hook]
They say we're born alone we'll die alone
I say it's worth it for tonight alone
Sometimes I feel like I'm kaleidoscope
Alkalines collide inside I feel like I’m kaleidoscope
