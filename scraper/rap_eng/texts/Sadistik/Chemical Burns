[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Veins like a roadmap, black cold grasp on a throat that
Won’t hold back old habit, Kodak moments go past
I wrote stains on a toe-tag, old man made me so sad
That no taste of the Cognac or Prozac antidote, twist my skull
Off with his head, head like a hole Nine Inch Nails pressed to the bone
Exit alone, try and fail, life inhaled dead to the world
Ethanol on your pedestal, churn chemical burns
Hurt worse than skeletal, so skeptical at first, perfect
Cursive in Hell, sweet silver bells all seem to say "Please go away”
Demons will play, eating away, new young and old, food for the soul-
Less that you know, the less that you feel
I'm cursed with intelligence I can't heal
Kneel, kill, death to the bourgeois, proletariat with the new song
Noose on a bony neck, loneliness, opiate and a bruised jaw
Allah’s not, nobody owns me, no job, robot, no cold feet
No God, only strong no home, no soul sold so-so so long

[Hook: Lotte Kestner]
Watch the paint peel
Slow as the burn you feel
Break the heart you never should've
You can bury anything
In the woods

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
I'm a live wire in a dead world, I'm a good boy, but I'm a better girl
Eyes closed, finger on the trigger, one inch different I'm free
You’re a widow, liquor liver, Suboxone under my tongue
Private numb, one more time for dying young
I had fun, watching father try to run, but he left a black hole inside his son
If we're being Frank, I'm an average Joe, cop shop
Jake and Johnny, Jack and Coke, your tsunami of only
Honestly couldn't even reach the back row
So how do you expect to drown me, dumbfound me or harm me
You and what army, are we clear, I'm here
In a rearview mirror, coming to a theater near you
To steer you away from your fears, stage bound
Usually it's break-a-leg, she told me to break a heart
I didn't know what to say exactly so I walked away
And later thought I should've at least told her thanks
But that's how that goes, where the grass grows
There’s a past in the time capsule, I'm attracted to its shadow
Every last drip 'til I'm flat broke
Let’s make this storm feel clean, coward man war machine
Sour plans, plots and schemes, ripened fruit, rotten dreams
Thoughtlessly, I told a lie, nothing I won't do to save my own behind
I'm a live wire burning dead inside
But I'm not dead, I'm not dead, I'm not dead until I've died

[Outro: Eyedea]
Yeah, cut your wrists on a blade of glass
I can't change my past but I can kiss the now and make it last
Take out the trash, crash, burn, another relapse
Turn, rehash me perhaps
There's an in-between smile and frown behind your mask
