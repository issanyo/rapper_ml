[Verse]
Triple X, disrespect
Inner torment in a internet
Did you ever feel intact?
Did angels belie your villain mask?
Anger inside won’t disaffect
I wonder were those 6’s etched?
Were all the voices incorrect?
20 years old you were still a sketch
With blemishes and all
Devilish of tongue
I was reticent with love
Yet empathize with monsters
No medicine for us
And still I listen to your bluest songs
& wish you could have grew up more
It’s like right when you bloomed your gone
I wish you could have proved us wrong
And instead of checking vitals
They took footage of you
And tagged it for the virals
People put their hand upon the Bible
And swear that they’re your people
This is just a eulogy
For someone I never knew
But I be feeling pain the same
I know that I am empty too
It’s been on my brain today
I hope that you can rest at ease
X’s on our eyes tonight
Bad Vibes Forever rest in peace
