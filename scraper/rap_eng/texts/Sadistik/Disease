(Sadistik):
I feel agoraphobic but reluctantly I stay the course
In this maze of thorns cause there's no way that I can circumvent it
It smells like Agent Orange in this place I'm headed
And I may regret it but I gotta do what makes me form
Counterfeited smiles enable me to find my breath
Painted in the fog that was labelled at the time of death
Of a recluse, tangled in a spider web
Why ingest halos when the fables that they write are dead?
Examine all the lines for an indication of the colors that were there inside another anecdote of time
Talons grow inside with these inattentive gazes till it changes from irrational to schizophrenic rages
When you're in a cage you forget how big the world can be
And when you're always bleeding you forget it's an emergency
It's a slow trip that can lose your hold quick
Questioning the purpose that's embedded in your circuitry
And then the water crystallises, it grows inside your chest until your heart’s of sickled ice
The world is an authentic made of artificial ties that were meant to cover gravestones, technicolor rainbows
Letters from an angel are freakin with my memories
Messing with my sheets cause I've been sleeping with the enemy
Under a secretive identity, I try to get away but she’s been leaking methamphetamines
Drip drip, lick lick, infect me with diseases
Feed me all your lies until you get me to believe it
Is this instance a part of lucid dreaming
Or just illusionary and they got you to believe it?
(KoLyric):
Only enemies leave roses when you die a lost cause
And sing in harmony to give your death a swan song
Another day of coffin shoppin for when your death comes
The bones in my closet will need a couple extra
Just another tune to react to the redrum
Let it serve the senses with a mellowed out possession
Another shallow head rush, the gallows have your heads up
All work and no play gives this blade the best cut
I'm sleeping with a carnivore that breathes on my neck
The skin on her teeth covered by my pieces of flesh
The beast in my head found a season to rest
It's winter again, the cold has grown in my chest
I'm the angel of death, or a loser with a dream
Everything is winding like the pusher trilogy
It's the seamy side of life that portrays the perfect image
Happiness is letter perfect that we never get to see
Dangled between hope and a blind love
By a noose knotted as a bow for my nice tux
I fell to pieces when you split my heart in two
The wound turned to frostbite, but that's the scar tissue
