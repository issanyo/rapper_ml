[Verse 1: Sadistik]
I used to live in static in a dream a cinematic liturgy
Acidic habits that I had were mixed and matched with gritted teeth
See, she's so enigmatic isn't she
I sit and sat esteemed of how her lips could match a guillotine
I feel the sting of her pitter-patter little feet
Dancing on my ribcage kicking patterns to the beat
Beat beat beating on my chest
When I'm sleeping like a baby and you're stealing all my breaths
Kiss me twice I'll do the rest
As the city lights dimming right on cue again
Such a pretty sight is it why you've haunted my skin
With your ruby red lipstick aren't you a gem
Yes diamond cutter eyes like a shutter blind
Fly like butterflies by my stomach
Hi I'm another guy to fall in love with
And they say sky's the limit
We can burn up in the atmosphere while we try to get it like

[Hook: Child Actor]
Like you love me
Don't go
You're coming with me
My baby

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
My head hangs heavy when we exchange heavy blows
Chest pains spreading with her red fangs setting slow
I feel the checkmate getting close
Here's the methane we can let blaze ready go
My room was in my room was in my room was in hell
'til I met up with my queen she was raised out in Brooklyn
I'm amazed by the way that she changed
All the rays from the sun to the flames in her footprints
Sky is a violet grey, lights in a diamond shape
Bright when I'm wide awake, I am a mile away
Eyes are a vibrant jade, cry in a tidal wave
Sides like a spider's legs, try to still hide her face
So if home is where the heart is
You can find me sleeping in between her bones or in her cartilage
And I can break your heart in two
And use the jagged edge that's left to go and take apart the gloom
For my palmreader
