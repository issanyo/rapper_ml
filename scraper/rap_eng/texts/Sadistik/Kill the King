[Verse 1: Sadistik]
I ain’t a killer, but don’t push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy, exorcise the demon’s noise I got inside
Set my sight to “seek/destroy” and watch ‘em die
I’ve yet to find a decent void, to occupy
So I modified my face a bit to get inside this place again
My voice is feeling hoarse—I let it fly and call it Pegasus
So you can take your pick and pick your perk or poison
While I play the prick again to pin your picture perfect ploy on
No—I won’t say I’m getting stronger
‘Cause what doesn’t kill me only makes me wait a little longer
Play the Chupacabra when I take a few more shots of
All the Jamey, booze and vodka ‘til I change into a monster
And somehow, it’s so real to me
Philistine think-patterns that I fight until I bleed
Still I weave dreamcatchers just so I can steal your dreams
Eyedea told me, “Kill the king”—I don’t feel a thing now

[Hook: Deacon the Villain]
I give up everything I’ve ever had
Give up everything I’ll ever be
Throughout my life, I’ve done the illest things
To pay that price, I gotta kill the king
Give up everything you’ve ever had
Give up everything you’ll ever be
Throughout your life, you’ve done the illest things
To pay that price, we gotta kill the king (kill the king)

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
Why am I alone, feeling violent inside my skull?
It’s all golden, the silence that is mine to own
Dianetics, I suppose, side-effects of highs and lows
Ups and downs, come around, spider webs inside my home
I hope you miss me when I leave
And not beautify my path until I’m getting old and weak
In the suicide capital, the city full of grief breeds
Do-or-die passion for the vitriol I speak
Man I love it, come find me mastering the puppets
In a public—confined, I’m laughing at the others
Six million ways to fly, so choose one
I tried to wing it and failed, until I grew some
I’m looking at the world through these rose-colored glasses
And concluded that it’s only full of low-budget actors
With their slow cuts and bad scripts, I’ll play the recluse
Yeah I could probably show you the ropes—in the shape of a noose (so hang in there)
