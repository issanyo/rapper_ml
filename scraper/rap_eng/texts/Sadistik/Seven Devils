[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Somberly I sit alone watching while the city glows
Keeping to myself, walking on my tippy-toes
So silent but locked in with the witty prose
To propose as confident when talking to the pretty folks
And they're so awkward in their videos
Lost within a spinning globe, nauseous and it's getting old
Oh I can see it on their face I don't get a lot of praise
I'll bet I'll posthumously get it though
So I can let it go go I guess
Ninety-nine percent of one-percenters don't exist
I wine and dine with letters as a pleasure opiate
To bring my mind back to the center 'fore the medics open it
So here's another piece of me forgotten and ignored
Another piece I sharpened with a sword
The apple of my eye, she was rotten to the core
So I left her in the trash where she belongs and I've long since ignored
I know there's aphids in my chest to get
The butterflies I'm feeling when I strain to make the best of it
I run and hide to heal again from basic taste of death I'm getting
From the times of dealing with relationship-recklessness
And now I'm hiding in the night
Cause it's a full moon and the lycans tend to bite
There's lighting in between my eyelids and it's frightening when it strikes
And it might get me blinded by the light

It's so quiet in a sense, the silence just reflects
There's a crisis in my head from the vices I possess
And the prices that I set on the diamonds I collect
Well I guess except one cause I hide it in my chest

[Bridge:]
Seven devils in my head saying they're a friend
Seven devils in my head playing their pretend
Seven devils placing bets, seven devils made of flesh
Seven devils in my head craving for attention
Seven devils in my head making their amends
Seven devils in my head waiting for the end
Seven devils made a pledge, seven devils playing dead
Seven devils in my head saying they're a friend

I always believe you why don't you believe me

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
I got a desk full of papers left for the tapeworms
Breath full of Tanqueray left from the anger
Head full of anchors, bed full of strangers
That I think I met I forget what their names were
So i'll smile while I grit my teeth
Dimethyltryptamine high I can get from dreams
Fine, I'll show why I'm a different breed
Jim Morrison tip, I am the lizard king
It's like A Clockwork Orange
Cody DeLarge show me your heart
A star is born okay
Pull me apart I can watch the gore and say
I'm showing your god what scars are for today
I write along right along a dotted line to write a poem
Cause I've been on a higher height of flight to fight the tiresome
I am just uninspired violent fired up
Carcass that's been caught in constant carnage so don't try to run
My eyes adjust in size when the light erupts
I like the touch smell taste and the sight of blood
What I don't think that's what I meant
So here's a snow angel that I'll leave in the cement
Let's take a drink to the secrets that I kept
Just between us and another for the pieces that I left
In a sequence and I hoped that you would read it and it said
That there's one too many of these fucking demons in my head
