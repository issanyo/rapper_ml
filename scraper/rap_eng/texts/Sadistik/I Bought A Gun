[Hook]
I bought a gun
Yea I hide it in my closet
Next to the skeletons quiet when I cock it

[Verse 1: Nemo Achida]
I bought a gun, Sex pistol she was fun
We shot in black & white every day like ancient nuns
Or foreign films or Jordan 1s
Two shots, one for me & one for her
We're dead floating off the bombest lungs
Designer bodybags, my tongue chaotic
Like Jason's tech on the dresser
They be show 9s underneath the guidance of professor
Unschooled, hard knocks love a tall Glock
The big hand or a barrell
When you watch your head on our clock
Cause my block, scars to the face so I rapped a lot
Staying out the way is survival in a nutshell
Cross a brother's path and he make glove compartment nut shells
Nutty motherfuckers move your crust and ask for more bread
Look into the floor of a hustler and it's code red
George pushed the button on these terroristic hacks
Of a soldier that would friendly fire just to gain a rack
It is crazy where we at

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
I'm off that sleep deprivation
Minds a mine field that just keeps detonating
So I keep dead & waiting
There's a gun inside my closet now
Make not a sound, unfired not a round
Just cause you don't believe doesn't mean it's not around
In this haunted house I listen close
Ear against the prison walls, iridescent visuals
I hear morose quotes in morse codes & moreso
There's morsels of more souls around me
Yea they're forceful & hounding
Where im from its storm-soaked & cloudy
It's suicide capital, born-broken county
So count on me to count you out
I'm counterculture roundabout
Witty with the witticisms still I'm iffy if without a crowd
Without a doubt... Doubt, Sinks into the shoulder blades
Captive of the scapulas, I think that I can hold the weight
I cultivated weaponry I'm on the run
And growing paranoid so I bought a gun
