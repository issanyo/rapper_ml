Verse 1:

God kills the best of us
And leaves the rest to bury them
This heart of darkness is charcoal art
Carcas carving marble for seraphims
My chest is pounding like an 808
I get so cloudy I could fade to grey
Aleister Crowley with the razor blades
Spray flames at fakes until they fade away, aye
Any minute ima immolate ‘em
My inner state stays in decay
Their shit is played out, my skin is splayed
24 ribs sit displayed
In a trophy case now
Scripted hit-lists in lowercase
With a Pokerface out
I’ll show em the way down

Verse 2 (Trizz):

I got money so I don’t do much
You niggas be talking’ too much
I go toe-to-toe with myself in a rut
I’m a nut give a fuck mama told me what’s up
These niggas don’t love us they out for the stunt
If there’s funk tell them niggas to meet me out front
For some fame there’s a whole lot of dick they’ll suck
We do nothing but plot and do us
Me and some ghosts in a truck
We lurking for sinners who don’t know the word of the one
I’m a son of a gun that’ll bust if I’m touched
We get ugly and handle our stuff
Type of fight is you down to put up?
If there’s beef call the cops if you ain’t gone pull up
When it’s all about drama be willing to jump
If there’s problems then solve them be willing to dump
