[Hook: Kno]
To be in love, to be in love
To be in love, to be in love
To be in love, to be in love
To be in love
It's just a phase I'm going through

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
I love you, I'm an addict, you're in my attic
The flowers that I grew for you still bloom into the patterns
I listen to the dissonance but all I hear is static
All I see is technicolor, everything is plastic
Man I can get down when the mannequins surround
But you're magic, casting a spell, hell's sporadic
Telepathic, tell me your telling habits
Sell me a single spark & help me up from the ashes
Phoenix-bulimic, the acid-
Rain-dances splatter upon the canvases
I feel ecstatic, you're enigmatic
My Alabama, so we can go wreak some havoc
And I can be your Clarence declaring that we can have it
True Romance, yea it's feast or famine
From Bi-polar to manic, it's my solar dynamics
But you, you are my Mecca, you're my holy sabbatical

[Hook: Kno]
To be in love, to be in love
To be in love
It's just a phase I'm going through

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
I love you, I'm The Devil, you're in my head though
When I met you I knew you were something special
And ever since been reveling in my rebel
I'm falling stars, my god you are celestial
Back from the dead again
That makes you revenant, I'm mental
I meant that I'm detrimental, don't let go
You're my tempo, no you're my temple
I'll decorate you, I'll make you Deco
You're bolder than all the petals
And your words turn boulders into some pebbles
Peddle past... let the levels last & tread slow
Forever 'til the breath goes
Together in the death throes
I'll sing your praises, I'll make it echo
I'll sink my fangs in, I'll drain the vessels
You, you are my Mecca, you're my loneliest headstone

[Hook: Kno]
To be in love, to be in love
To be in love
It's just a phase I'm going through
