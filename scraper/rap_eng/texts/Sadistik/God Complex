[Intro]
(Coughing)
Yeah
Get on my level for real, get on my level
Get on my level for real, get on my level
Yeah

[Verse 1]
The apparitions appear, they're up here
My conditions impaired
Now our positions to peer on our peers
My visions in pairs
Apparently people still think I'm a poet
A freak and I know it
Afraid I'm a fraud, I'm a leech, I'm a rodent
Taking the hearts of the people opposed
Feast or be feasted, it's beating for beats & I know
I'm a beast and it shows, I'ma show 'em my teeth
At least that I know I'm the least
These people are so in between more like social disease
So fuck their retweets & fuck the like
I've come to defeat and cut the ties
I don't vie for dumb, I become divine
Will I sacrifice my sun to shine?

[Hook]
I got a God up here, I got a God up here
What you got up here?
I got a God up here, I got a God up here
What you got?
I got a God up here, I got a God up here
What you got up here?
I got a God up here, I got a God up here
Which you got?

[Verse 2]
I’m the god of gods
All are lost, Holocausts
All accosted for hollow cause
Throw molotovs, don’t call the cops
We’re slowly dying and waterlogged
Don’t baptize me in alcohol
Or choke and tie me, I’m nodding off
Throw tomahawks at those bla bla-blas
Like wooh, yeah I don’t wanna talk to you
Like wooh, and I don’t want a talking to
Since I can’t fit sins in stanzas
I’ll sit in absence and sip the absinthe
My hippocampus can hit the canvases
Is this disenchantment ?
