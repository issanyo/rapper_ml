There's fireants in the bloodstream, wolves in the dining room
Firedance to drum beats I fold at the sight of moons
Moonshine I consume consummates the tomb
Stoned in my room confiding interviews in a muse like [muah]
Purple Urkle herbals venting circles, circumventing hurdles
Hurt'll go away eventually just let it bleed
That's what she says to me, my Everything
And then she dissipates into the seven rings
She said every single one would represent a different sin of mine
In cinematic synergy, a liturgy of bitter highs
Similar to when I find something that I think I love
Just to watch it shrink to dust, or say it hates or isn't mine
Yea, I'm a product of a different time
Walking on a different line
Auction off my God and throw it in a fire
Joan of Arc empathizer, strict attire, all black, victimizer
Sick and tired, don't they frickin' see I fricassee?
Injecting venom when I'm injuring to kill, I'm still a different breed
Ministries are fitting, timpanis are hitting, symphonies are lifting gingerly
You can't hear it, it's in me, it's in my inner-me, inner demons entertain my enemies
The energy I've grown to know's so bittersweet
So kiss the ring around the rosy that I left around your eye for being nosey
I'm unholy, they don't lionize the lonely
With a Dandelion head, wings like an albatross
I'm camoflauge background cannon-fodd
I don't speak with the chatterbox-es
But I can drink 'til I'm cataton-ic-uor-ice stained teeth and lips
Fingers fish like a hook for my weaknesses
Grievances I mistook for sleeplessness
And focusing, sew it seams like seamstresses
Yea, so add it to my catalog
I'm picture perfect, Richard Avedon
Standin' on the thin ice I dance upon
Tap tap, black hat, black cat for bad luck I gamble on
Long-shots I take, Jamal Crawford, cross-over-all awkward
I'm a tag-along, following the fallers and the vagabonds
Yea, that's my grave that you're standing on
I hear the ears against the plaster walls
