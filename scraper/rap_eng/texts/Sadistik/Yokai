[Hook]
Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go
Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go there is snow
Life is so unfair I know
Lady Snowblood bitching at me
I’m unbearable
Like Ivan The Terrible
Both her eyes are peridots
Sometimes I wanna tear em out
They stare into my barren soul
Assuming I’m Asami, Audition
(eerie, eerie, eerie)
Let me put some needles on your skin
(kiri, kiri, kiri)
On that Hara-Kiri feeling Irreversible
Extinguisher to skull
Watch me wrap these fingers around my throat
I say, I say

[Hook]
Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go
Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go

[Verse 2]
Slinking through Shibuya
Singing Hallelujah
Drinking sake
Thoughts are black, I'm all Yakuza
Ichi with the itchy finger
My medullas on Medusa
Twist em up like Kama Sutra
Karma suits you
Onibabas follow me like Onimusha
