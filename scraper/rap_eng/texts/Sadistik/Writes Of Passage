[Vast Aire]
So what you running from?
Oh those cats on the corner they hella dumb
That's why I'm done with Standage
I'll bite your face and make a sandwich
Now you actin' like you don't know
This is just usual, show 'em my judo throw
Oh no, your rap styles finished
How you playing Popeye with E coli spinach?
Ok, lets slow down
Cus you are not prepared for the speed of sound
Don't let the beast run his mouth
When the Aire came through, they skated out
I used to cry out why (why!)
Cus like Scott Summers, I couldn't open my eyes
Cus everyone would die
If I took one peek, everyone would fry

[Sadistik]
My appetites for sitting in cityscapes in black and white
Crackin' light Smittys I'm shitty faced to crash at night
The passive type, who's a lost pathetic dreamer
Terrified to be a victim with a walking dead demeanor
I'm coughing emphysema, caught in coffins in between
A cautious innocence while listening to Andre Nikatina
If you could trace my steps a couple minutes
Huh, if I get crossed you fall like London bridges
I do this for pot heads playing sick as a teen
And insomniacs who still will raise a fist for the dream
For Street Fighter 2 and David Lynchian scenes
For 2Pac Shakur and Rage Against the Machine
I'm a cynical, profitable, raw syllables I'll spit at you
Similar to the kid named Rakim will do
I'm identical to that of Pac's mental too
I rock spiritual without a break or stop interval
I'm from the state where the rain will never stop
Hendrix was from and Cobain perfected rock
A place seagulls land where the space needle stands
And fuck Bush stickers decorate people's vans
I watch the wind blow, leaves caught in limbo
Tiptoe past the season's frosty skin tone
Seeing glossy crystals, I try and catch it
Describe it all inside my Writes of Passage
