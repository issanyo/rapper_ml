This is magic, its tragic, its passion, its me
This is classic romance and its madness, its peace
This is masochists, Catholics, addicts and activists
Blackness and sadness that pacifists see
This is close to me, focusing, ghosts that sing (Axioms!)
Rosary, broken wings holding me (Back-a-wards!)
Followed the path to to to find find find this
And I swallowed the wrath to un-ite my intents-tents-tents
Tensions will build, walls will collapse
Lessons instilled when I saw through the cracks
Cracked smiles repaired, we just crawl in our tracks
Cause we live just to die, we evolve to adapt
To the fast food and the tattoos
Its like I just can't see past the bad news
And I can't bruise, like a statue
But I'm fallin' apart from the shrap-nel
This is casualties, atrophy, mastering (axioms!)
Gravity, gradually, askin' me (back-a-wards!)
Progress make can you when reverse in be why?
Feel I how just that's cus reverse in words speak I
Any and every engaging discussion
Of lovin's engraving a memory in me
Memories in me engraving the lovin'
Of every and any engaging discussion
High high high mid mid mid low low low (Next!)
Why try my wish if this goal I holds (Dead!)
Sooner or later I'll drown in regret
When I'm swimming in circles and holding my breath
