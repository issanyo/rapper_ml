[Intro]
Sippin' on that liquor
Faded like my picture
Faded like my picture
Faded like my picture
Sippin' on that liquor
Faded like my picture
You know I'm in my zone
Faded in the mixture

[Verse 1]
Self-fulfilling not full of myself
I'll show 'em my hell
And when I go I'll pull it myself
December snow all cold that I felt
No coal that I felt could be a diamond
I squeezed and mined it - Inshallah
Gave it a shot, it stayed on my palms
Napalms don't seem to mind it - stigmata
Everything I touch - King Midas
Gold ain't really worth that much it's a crutch be honest
They're colorblind, I see violets
Backwards Bergman's Persona
Everybody humming all the hymns
Homonyms flooding with the fish
Going with the flow, running with the rest
That lowly-lowly-low still drumming on my ribs
Oh no, save me from my life
Take me on a flight
Isn't it interesting, isn't it great?
We disintegrate integrate drift into space
Like cosmic dust I was born a star
A storm that started a wanderlust
My omnibus is a work in progress
’Til posthumous no god I trust

[Hook]
They want us all to get fucked up
Free spirits
Free spirits
Free spirits
They want us all to get fucked up
Free spirits
Free spirits
Free spirits
They want us all to get fucked up
Free spirits
Free spirits
Free spirits
They want us all to get fucked up
Free spirits
Free spirits
Free spirits

[Verse 2]
Fireball shots fire thy blunderbuss
Wounds hide inside wondrous
Knife juggler, sliced jugular
They utter, but I'm subtler
Cognitive summoner
Cognizant front runner
Running up’s not an option I'm opting to run amuck
Not one of Arsenic's stomachers
Let's put the cult in culture
I put the volt to vultures
Electric birds fly over oceans
Open sojourn soaked in sulfur
Those broken bones burn the same
Don't you know we’re to blame
We sold our souls over chosen flames went to search the plains
And maintained hope floats, it won't turn to rain
(So turn up) Nah motherfucker get down
Don't get involved head down
Holes that we all head down, take another shot get rounds
Then chase another shot get rounds
Round here people tattoo to count years
Crocodile tears drown fears
Dirtiest mirrors perfect appearance
Murder each other turn 'em to spirits yea

[Hook]
They want us all to get fucked up

Free spirits
They want us all to get fucked up
Free spirits
Free spirits
Free spirits
They want us all to get fucked up
Free spirits
Free spirits
