[Verse 1: HatePH34R]
I'm drifting and shifting the high
Feeling sublime
Colors that blend in and die
Animalistic feeling sadistic
Kiss and twist the meaning right?
Androids dream of lowly sheep while I'm inside my head so deep
Hills have eyes, they’ve seen the terror hidden beneath my lies
Altered minds, blurred lines
Not body tied, Altered Carbon
Skulking in the fallout shelter
Deal with death, blood to the gutter
4 of hearts, rocky starts
Play my hand you’ll play the victim
Coffin fodder, coughing harder
One more hit I’ll taste the stars

[Chorus]
We are not alone
The truth is somewhere out there


[Bridge: HatePH34R]
Circle the drain, I’ll drain your veins
And melt your brain like Triptocaine
I feel hunger pangs thundering
Nightmare walking in the flesh, bound gagged and marked for death
Angel’s wings for demon’s price, why do you look so surprised?

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
Tell me something I don't know
Foes posing for photos
With fake cash that's faux dough
This train wrecks in slow mo
Off Trainwreck I blow smoke
But never lie, come testify
Even when I'm high I get so low
In a crowd still solo
These voodoo dolls got no soul
Sutures fit me sew-sew
Though future gives me no hope
Abandon that before you enter here
An aftermath of the yesteryears
And after that all the stress appears
Addicts act like the average
Rage & avarice, but we are not alone

[Chorus]
