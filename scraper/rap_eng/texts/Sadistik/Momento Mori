Tip your cups, to the late night writing binge
Of stage fright, another playwright dies again
I reach for great heights and play my violin
On my vocal chords where the great whites hide within
I'm neglectin' broken veins and the ventricles that break
When I'm hiding what I feel in a Texas Hold 'Em face
I better fold that ace, and find a past time
Pride has flat-lined and my pedestal's at stake
Reality's orphan kid, casualty abortion vict'
Journalist of worth, personality contortionist
My claws scrape the granite
Scratchin' pain poems in hallways I'm trapped in
I think of Colepaugh taking his final breath
And the bullets that he lodged in David McDonald's chest
I swear to god that I felt the bullets too
In a homicide, suicide I sing the ocean blues

Hear the sounds, of a thousand broken spirits
A man who wouldn't lie and a crowd who won't endear it
Confessions of a clown that's sounding so sincere when
He always faced the ground, wrote it down in quotes and lyrics
I've got a ghost, but he never stays in touch
Another hole to dig and another grave to love
Another fifth is gone, another day that sucks
Another dream is dead as the summer fades to dusk

I gotta find the time of day when I'm awake and no
I'm not afraid to migrate and hide away alone
And every single song I make is another piece of my
Peace of mind, if I fall in line and swallow pride I'll (choke)
On rum and cokes, I'm runnin' low on beer and weekend booze
Just to ink a song and singalong right here to sing to you
I'm out of love and tired and I'm sounding uninspired
When I'm drinking 'til I puke without a single reason to
With a one one two, when I con-front you
When I do all the things that the fuck ups do
Come to another place, undo lovin' mistakes
When I'm summonin' something abundant I'm lovin' instead of just runnin' away
A-way to look past this is gaze through look glasses
Semantics passions practiced actions and that's it when I catch wind in an-tics

(I wrote this for you Phoenix... listen)

Every single night I pray my letters form a kiss
And it blows through the wind until it rests upon her lips
A metamorphosis that the butterflies imagine
In undecided fashion when weather storms emit
She settles scores with this and I just sit enchanted
As fireflies dance until her wish is granted
I listen frantic to melodies of heartbreak
It feels so temporary but she's telling me it's always
I'd die in hell so my angel's not alone
And I'd swim inside her blood for a fatal drop of hope
Just to prove our engagements are soluble
And dance to the chorus when the rain hits the solitude
And breaks into molecules, that's her
Another piece of me that feels but can't hurt
I stand firm, in this apocalyptic breeze
Until I finally fall apart and then my confidence is breached
And I'm gone... and I'm gone...
