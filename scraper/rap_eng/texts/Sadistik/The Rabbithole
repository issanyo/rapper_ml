[Verse]
How far does this rabbit hole go?
Alice in a Blunderland, flammable soul
Animals roam and the catacomb slows
Searching for capital, searching for hope
Churning the sad into tangible goals
They’re burning their flags to adapt to the cold
Ration control, happiness sold
Eye-for-eye habits, a cannibal cult
They feed me cyanide tablets
They breathe low at the sight of my panic
Heavy-hearted, mind if I stab it?
Depths of my sanity, height of my madness
I’m on prescriptions, Iodine tablets
I don't trust the water, so why would I have it?
Jim Jones with the Kool-Aid, sip slow
Two faces, one slit throat
Animals pile and the ocean’s a medicine
Alcohol files, the Coke and the Mescaline
Antidote style, smoke for adrenaline
And I don't smile, it exposes my skeleton
I got the soul of an elephant
Grieving the lost on a road that’s so desolate
Echoes are still resonant, the ghost of the Oedipus
And Dear God letters that I wrote for the Hell of it
You see the tendencies
For them, it’s to tend and cease, but not me
See, I can attend and get ten degrees
Attention-piqued, to ten ‘til the tenure’s reached, but not me
Increase intensity
I’ll walk 'til the tendons cease, Achilles
I can walk to attend Dead Seas, and drown myself in it
Narcissus did it, give it any minute
I'll admit that I am just an artist that's a part of this equation, huh?
Nah, I’m a part of this aphasia
I fucked myself, I’m so auto-nymphomania
I gotta make-up words, it’s getting harder to explain it but
The particles in my brain erupt
The pace is up, when I’m vulnerable and caught up in the mania
I’m in the cut off that Indica, inner-cuts
Never seem to cease and so I zip it shut
I’m on a 50, a milli, a milli grams
Enough so I’m not a killi, a killing them
I feel a million, I'm the villain I'm
Antagonistic, vicious obsidian
But so purple inspired
Circlin' tired in a circus attire
Bumbling bumble bee, worker for hire
Build prisons to live in, and churches for liars
Perfect environments to purchase desire
Selling their souls for which version is higher
Parents used to listen to that Earth, Wind and Fire
But I like Cohen, bird on a wire
Moral compass is like, "Fuck it, I don’t need it"
If it bleeds, then it can die, and if it dies then I can eat it
That includes my inner demons, platitudes and my secrets that I keep
Atlas with the clavicle, so creep
With me as I crawl through the hood, maniac
Lunatic, or just unimpressed, yeah I've felt a hundred deaths
Facing all the greatest odds, but I’m in the hunt again
Pacing ‘til it makes me lost, swell until I’m puffer fish
Razor in an aching jaw, red all in my upper-lip
Take it with a grain of salt, set it in the cut you left
Painting on the caveman walls, sentences my lover said
I'll chase you down the rabbit hole until I lose my breath
