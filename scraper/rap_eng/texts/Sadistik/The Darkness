[Intro]
Make note to my essence and to me
If I am to retrieve it from darkness
Darkness

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
No survivors, blood in a open bottle
Nosferatu, cutting the throats that grovel
You know the motto, make me a hokum model
Hate me and quote my rivals, lately I'm so bravado
And I suppose I'm broken (oh so broke-in)
Cuts are disinfected in these Isopropyl oceans
Sewers hide the suicides and I support the notion
Look at me look at you, eyes import the poisons
Poised and ready, hoisting heavy choices
Noise is steady from the voices medley
Meddling to appoint their points are petty
Petals falling off the daffodils, I can't appeal
There's never monarchs in this monarchy there's only caterpill
Erstwhile leaving shadows on the moon
Teach me how to drown in the shallowest lagoons
The darkness and the gloom, the parts that we consume in our hearts
Everything is pretty in the dark

[Hook: Kno]
I run
I run into the darkness
Everything is hidden from the sun
I run into the darkness
Everything is hidden from the sun

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
Confide in me, friend says dear diary
Fine with me friend, let's hear why I'm me
Silently lips crack when I try to speak back
Feet standing in the tracks of a giant's feet
I am weak, I'm the violence
I'm defiant to the ring that the choirs sing
I succeed in the former of the fight or flee
People playing hide and seek just to see when I'mma peak
See, it's total dark in the coldest parts
That's what it takes to expose the stars
No sunny brain, and there's no mirage
We numb the pain, when the hope is gone, I know the cost
Yeah, it's the absence of light
Lashes and gashes are captured in spite
The past tense of life is the madness we hide in our hearts
Everything is pretty in the dark

[Hook: Kno]
I run
I run into the darkness
Everything is hidden from the sun
I run into the darkness
Everything is hidden from the sun

[Verse 3: Nacho Picasso]
Run from the darkness, I hold the gauntlet
She a pompous, I told her pop it
For a profit, cause I'm a prophet
These niggas nonsense they truly make me nauseous
