[Verse 1: Joe Horton:]

There’s a big machine in the sky ‘ Some kind of electric snake
Coming straight for us ‘ Flashing a blue fang
Keep a brave face ‘ Victory’s a dead tongue
The boring part is over at least we know what we’re up against
Covet safety when there is none ‘ Unwind the hands of time
Dumb denial ‘ Constant hum
Quit pretending it makes sense
It Didn’t ‘ Doesn’t ‘ Won’t
The story that she told me has got me by the throat
If I could only take a breath ‘ I would never let it go
Damsel in distress ‘ carves an S into my chest
Blows me a kiss ‘ I happily accept it as reality when actually our lips never touch
She just figured out ‘ if she let me wear the cape ‘ I would let her wear the crown
If she taught me how to fly ‘ I would never leave the ground


[Verse 2: Sadistik:]

These ugly features look so auburn in the sun, but so awkward when it’s done
I try to conquer everything, I’m caught up in the hunt
Hunter S. Thompson with a gun, but less often just for fun
If you’re a target then you better keep walking
Cock it with a shrug, shrug it off and then I strut
With a saunter as I wander where the monsters are in love
One author of the glum, chum waters ’til I’m numb
Son, daughter, mom, father, gunpowder on my tongue
Run kitty kitty, black bad luck and filthy
Someone give me pretty back, man up and kill me
Here’s a stupid ballad for the part of me I let go
In fear I’d lose the battle when I’m arguing with echoes
The stress load I get’s so intense I just get low
And XO the leftovers, then I just explode
So get gone, and don’t offer me your help
Cause I am different just like everybody else
