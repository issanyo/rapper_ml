Maybe one day we'll come say "hi"
But right now it's not the right time

-

We'll be on our spaceship flying different places
Waiting for the day when you done with all that fake shit
So many times we tried to help, tried to save you from yourselves
We'll be on our spaceship flying different places
Hoping for the day we done overcome the hatred (yeet)
We came to your planet, but we had to leave

-

..hard together, you look at your screens
Thatâ€™s your problem, how can you be so naive?
People killing others 'cause of they beliefs (wow, wow)
We tried coming down, but we saw no light
