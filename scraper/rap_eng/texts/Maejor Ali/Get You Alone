[Hook: Maejor Ali]
Sex on my mind thinkin' 'bout when I get you alone
You already know it's goin' down when I get you alone
You know what I came here to do when I get you alone
I'ma give it all to you when I get you, when I get you alone

[Verse 1: Maejor Ali]
You know it, you know you in trouble, when I get you alone
Thinking 'bout the places I touch you, when I get you alone
And we can turn the cellphones off baby, when I get you alone
Cause everything you need is right here, right here, right here baby

[Bridge: Maejor Ali]
Cause I'm tryna see what's up with tonight
And I love the way your body looks up underneath these lights
So don't say it's wrong, when it feels right
Cause I'm looking at your apple and I wanna take a bite

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maejor Ali]
Tonight I need some entertainment, when I get you alone
Take all them clothes off let's get naked, when I get you alone
Baby let me kiss you somewhere sacred, when I get you alone
Cause I got what you need and it's right here, right here, right here, right here baby

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Say the hottest topic ain't about your body babe, that's the truth
Pull up in a Rover and all these people tellin' me, that's the crew
If I had you to myself then God damn baby that's a coup
Know you need some peace of mind, them legs up to the ceiling that's the deuce (of peace)
Any time of day you got me, gotta keep it straight up, no juice
I got a cabbana up in Cancun
We can fuck from R. Kelly to Lil Boosie
With yo' bad ass
I'm a fat kid for that fat ass
Cake
Love it how you make a nigga wait
Girl your body got me far from sober
Whenever we get alone, it's over
Yeah, it's over
Only if, if I get you alone
Promise it be alright, when I get you alone
Yeah I know you keep plans and I know you got friends
For once can we get this alone
Promise it be alright, alone
