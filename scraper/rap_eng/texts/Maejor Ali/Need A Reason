To your naval baby lately, lately

You and I haven't been up in ages, ages
This might take a minute thinking, maybe we should cancel dinner reservations
I was up in the club wasn't looking for love when I found you
The way your hips in tune with the bass, I can’t see nobody else around ya
I’ma make you feel like you just hit the lotto
Something like, Yes, Yes, Yes
Yea, I’m saying what’s the point of quickie?
We don’t need a reason, just a place to kick it
You can get it Uh, sing it to me girl

Take care of me, I get you right back
Slow down a little bit, I’m right there

Don’t be afraid, I like it like that
Take care of me, I get you right back
Slow down a little bit, I’m right there
Yes, it’s right there
Stay right there

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Cause I’m in need of love so let’s make it boy (I’m in need of love)
We don’t need no rules so let’s break ‘em, break ‘em (let’s break ‘em)
