[Intro]
So girl
You just be honest with me
I know we can make this work
I love you
I know that you afraid, babe
But you don't need to be saved, babe
You just need someone who understands
And I think I need the same, babe

[Verse 1]
Show me where you at, let's keep it honest
Home is where you at and that's a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you want, I can't believe it
I know that if we make it there's a reason
Sometimes the sun shines, baby
Sometimes it ain't breezy
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
I told you I'mma make it, that commitment
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
Ain't nothing more attractive than ambition

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Bridge]
If I came to your crib, would you open the door?
I don't wanna go down that road, no more
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
You're the only one I wanna be with, yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you
