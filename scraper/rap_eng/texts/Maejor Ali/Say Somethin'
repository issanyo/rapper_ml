[Verse 1]
I see you walk by, extra fly
Baby where you going?
Can I roll? (Is it cool if I come with you, baby?)
(Oh)
Living beach life, feeling right
You're the hottest, everybody knows
(Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Burning up, burning up
Show 'em what you got
Yeah, you got it, baby, let it show
(Oh)
Let's turn it up, turn it up
Let me know what's up
Don't just stand there, girl, I got to know
(Oh)

[Chorus]
Say something, if you're feeling the vibe
Say something, baby, don't be so shy
Say something, 'cause you're all in my head like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Say something, 'cause you are driving me crazy
Say something, 'cause you're driving me wild
Say something, the way you're working it, baby
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
When we talk, girl, fireworks
Something like the Fourth of July
(Oh)
You're super hot, fire hot
Something like the sun in the sky (huh, pretty hot babe)
(Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Burning up, burning up
Show 'em what you got
Yeah, you got it, baby, let it show
(Oh)
Let's turn it up, turn it up
Let me know what's up
Don't just stand there, girl, I got to know
(Oh)

[Chorus]
Say something, if you're feeling the vibe
Say something, baby, don't be so shy
Say something, 'cause you're all in my head like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Say something, 'cause you are driving me crazy
Say something, 'cause you're driving me wild
Say something, the way you're working it, baby
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah
Hey, baby
Tell me something, lady
I gotta know what's up
I gotta know it right now
Hey, baby
Tell me something, lady
I gotta know what's up
I gotta know it right now

[Chorus]
Say something, if you're feeling the vibe
Say something, baby, don't be so shy
Say something, 'cause you're all in my head like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Say something, 'cause you are driving me crazy
Say something, 'cause you're driving me wild
Say something, the way you're working it, baby
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
