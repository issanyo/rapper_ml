[Intro: Maejor Ali]
Ali

[Hook: Maejor Ali]
Theses bottles for me and my team
This table for me and my team
Girl come get up on this couch with me and my team
Tell your girls come have a drink with me and my team
My team got money
My team got a lotta dough
My team, the same team
My team, when I was poor
Now we on top just, me and my team
Now we on top just, me and my team

[Verse 1: Maejor Ali]
Started off with a dollar, got a taste of that power
Now we on plus tape home, they done let my dog off the collar
Me and Bizzle on the charter, Floyd fight so we headed to Nevada
Heat game watchin' Bron throw powder, have you ever seen a champagne shower?
Here come a whole bunch of bottles in a whole bunch of buckets
With a whole bunch of lights on 'em
I got my whole team with me and we all on the couch
I’d give my life for 'em

[Pre-Hook: Maejor Ali]
So, girl you gotta let me know
How you want this night to go
'Cause I’m ready when you are, ain’t nobody else sexy as you are
And girl, I really wanna get you alone, alone

[Hook: Maejor Ali]
Theses bottles for me and my team
This table for me and my team
Girl come get up on this couch with me and my team
Tell your girls come have a drink with me and my team
My team got money
My team got a lotta dough
My team, the same team
My team, when I was poor
Now we on top just, me and my team
Now we on top just, me and my team

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Hopped outta that 'rari
If I hurt your feelings I'm sorry
Six more pulled right behind me
Whole team lookin' like an army
You ain't even gotta worry 'bout you and me
I ain't even gotta tell ya, wait and see
Tap your homie on the shoulder
Say would you die for me?
And if you already know
Say my team will ride for me

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
So, girl you gotta let me know
How you want this night to go
'Cause I’m ready when you is, ain’t nobody else sexy as you is
And I'm tryna get you back to the crib, crib, crib

[Hook: Maejor Ali & Trey Songz]
Theses bottles for me and my team
This table for me and my team
Girl come get up on this couch with me and my team
Tell your girls come have a drink with me and my team
My team got money
My team got a lotta dough
My team, the same team
My team, when I was poor
Now we on top just, me and my team
Now we on top just, me and my team

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
(Whatup Ali?! It’s Kid Ink, ugh)
Said it’s just me myself and the team
With a dream for the F-I-N er things
On the scheme for the green, if you know what I mean
Put your bottles in the air, lemme hear 'em ting, ting
Ching, ching live a rockstar lifestyle, just like Sting
Chick is a rockstar, just like Pink
Talkin' 'bout cake, where the fuck her icin'?
Heard you lookin' for the man, bitch nigga ice him
'Bout to make a play but I'm sittin' on a bench
Yo girl tryna fuck like she fresh out the pen
Not just me but the whole team in it
I'ma take shots but the whole team winnin'
Bucket full of roses, Rose swirl
Blunt full of killa, OG hitta
Bat Gang, that's my nigga, my niggas
Alumni you can see I'm 'bout my buisness
I might took a lil, won't need no help
But I never could've made it here by myself
Never gon' change so day one with 'em
Won't love hoes, somebody tell em

[Hook: Maejor Ali]
Theses bottles for me and my team
