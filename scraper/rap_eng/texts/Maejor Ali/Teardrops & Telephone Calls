[Intro]
Sometimes you never really know who's there for what reason or what purpose
Teardrops and telephone calls
Teardrops and telephone calls

[Verse 1]
He was never really good with girls, nah
He was more into science
He was never really good with words, nah
He was more into silence
Just a young kid, 15 years old
Trying to figure out why this world so cold
And he ain't really had no friends at all
Sometimes he thought about dying
Thinking that's the only way he'll find peace
That was right around the time that he found me
See, I had just put my phone number on the internet to talk to fans
But he called, cause he felt like nobody understands
All his father does is drink, and his momma's in the streets
And sometimes when comes home, there's just nothing left to eat
And he hates it
Told me that he hates his life, he's thinking he should take it
Selecting all the hurt and just erase it
So I talk to him everyday, same time every night
Get to know his name, where he stay, you know, what he like
And even though I found his life really kind of rough
He was smart to computers and that kind of stuff
And one day my phone died and I was kind of scared
Thinking he would trip out, but when I called him he was there
That's my lil homie
He looked up to me, called me his OG
He heard all my songs way before the world did
And next thing you know, he got a little girlfriend
His grades started going up, but his momma's health didn't
So when she passed away, he said he ain't really miss her
Said she hit the road, left him and his little sister
And that's when they were young, so he ain't get to bond with her
I understand
Was kind of cool to watch him grow up to a man
And I started feeling proud
And I know I'm not his dad
But if you know me, you know I write songs and make tracks
Ain't really got time for no or all that
So through this whole thing I learned the craziest lesson
That this kid was actually my unexpected blessing
Spoke to him last week, he said I'm all good now
Check my profile, turned my picture upside down
And well, thanks Maejor

[Outro]
Teardrops and telephone calls
Yeah, you never know
Like the whole time I thought I was supposed to be helping him, but he was really helping me
Anybody who's going through, thinking about they life or anything. Don't
It's not worth it, for real, it could change any minute
Trust God, love yourself, there's people who love you
