[Verse 1: Ludmilla]
(Brasil)
Eu tô na vibe
Vem, tá suave
Solta no baile, solta na pista
Chega chegando
Vai embrazando
Traz a galera, traz a bebida
Mais uma dose
Chega e se envolve
Vai, traz a garrafa que pisca
Mexa essa raba, senta e não para
Vem com a danada da Ludmilla
A gente quica, senta e sobe
Pega e não se envolve
Se ficar de marra, a gente pega e dá um sacode
A gente quica, senta e sobe
Pega e não se envolve
Se ficar de marra, a gente pega e dá um… hm

I wasn't faithful, she wasn't neither
I was just playful, she was a cheater
I was a raiser, she was a bleeder
I was an angel, she was a demon

I took a jet, went out to Sweden
I been so blessed, cut out the scheme and
I was a mess, now I got meanin', uh
