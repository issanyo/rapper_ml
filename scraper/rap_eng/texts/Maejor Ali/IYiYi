Who dat, who dat you think always missin' you?

Okay, I shed a tear or two
On the gri-i-ind
But girl ain't no forgetting you 'cause

[Chorus: Cody Simpson]
Every minute, every second, every hour of the day, iYiYi
Every hour of the day, iYiYi
Everytime that I'm away, iYiYi
Missing you, missing you
Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced, iYiYi
Even if it's for a day, iYiYi
I'mma text yooou up to say, iYiYi
Missing you, missing you

[Verse 1: Cody Simpson]
Oh baby, whenever I'm gone
I'm wishing I was back home
I can feel your heart when we're apart
Girl, I'm on my way, trust every word I say
I can't wait to see your face
And when I said goodbye
I saw the tears in your eyes
As you started to cry
I took your hand and promised I'll be right back
Girl, I'm coming right back to see you smile

[Pre-Chorus: Cody Simpson]
So girl, what I gotta do to make you see?
I mean what I say to you
I'll send you a picture, let you know I miss you
Girl, send me a kiss, I can't wait to see you

[Chorus: Cody Simpson]
Every minute, every second, every hour of the day, iYiYi
Every hour of the day, iYiYi
Everytime that I'm away, iYiYi
Missing you, missing you
Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced, iYiYi
Even if it's for a day, iYiYi
I'mma text you up to say, iYiYi
Missing you, missing you

[Verse 2: Cody Simpson]
Remember when we first met?
I had to tell you that I couldn't live without your love
Baby, I must confess, we were the perfect match
You were a gift sent from above
When you're thinking about me, text 1-4-3
That means I love you, girl
I'll be your everything and all you need
Oh baby, let your heart take the lead, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Cody Simpson]
So girl, what I gotta do to make you see
I mean what I say to you?
I'll send you a picture, let you know I miss you
Girl, send me a kiss, I can't wait to see you

[Chorus: Cody Simpson]
Every minute, every second, every hour of the day, iYiYi
Every hour of the day, iYiYi
Everytime that I'm away, iYiYi
Missing you, missing you
Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced, iYiYi
Even if it's for a day, iYiYi
I'mma text you up to say, iYiYi
Missing you, missing you

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Lil' mama, ain't nobody else, I need you, girl
I-I-I got intentions just to please you, girl
And I try-y-y, lady, that's what you deserve
Super fly-y-y, you're more precious than a pearl
I can't lie-ie-ie, pictures in my living room
When I ri-i-ide, dashboard, digital
To the sky-y-y, so thankful that you're in my world
Do or die-ie-ie, baby, I ain't kidding you
I don't wanna be your distant man
Tellin' me I don't do enough for plans
I really can't afford to let it hit the fan
Girl, every minute I wanna hold your hand
Ain't no limit to the words I'm saying
I don't wanna rock with a brand new band
Just you, lil' mama, that's grand
I've been all over the land and

[Chorus: Cody Simpson]
Every minute, every second, every hour of the day, iYiYi
Every hour of the day, iYiYi
Everytime that I'm away, iYiYi
Missing you, missing you
Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced, iYiYi
Even if it's for a day, iYiYi
I'mma text you up to say, iYiYi
Missing you, missing you

[Outro: Cody Simpson]
Ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, I'm missing you
