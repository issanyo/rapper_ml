[Verse]
I like girls, they are great
Strippers everywhere, I like this place
But I don't like all these fake people runnin' 'round
Pretending they got Benz, all they got is their big mouth
But hey, I don't care
Cause in the end I'm flyin' private and they just Ryanair

[Pre-Hook]
I'm in the club, I don't know what the fuck is going on
Big smile on my face, DJ play my favorite song
And we all here now, we all fuckin' here now
Let's smoke some weed and chase some Flügel shots with beer now, ay

[Hook]
We all fuckin' here now
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na
And we all here now, we all fuckin' here now
Na na na na, na na na na na na

[Post-Hook]
I been drinking Bacardi, I'm tipsy as shit
Turnt up in the party, it's lit in this bitch
Been drinkin' Bacardi, I'm tipsy as shit
Turnt up in the party, it's lit

[Verse]
I like girls, they are great
Strippers everywhere, I like this place
But I don't like all these fake people runnin' 'round
Pretending they got Benz, all they got is their big mouth
But hey, I don't care
Cause in the end I'm flyin' private and they just Ryanair

[Pre-Hook]
I'm in the club, I don't know what the fuck is going on
Big smile on my face, DJ play my favorite song
And we all here now, we all fuckin' here now
Let's smoke some weed and chase some Flügel shots with beer now, ay

[Hook]
And we all here now, we all fuckin' here now
Let's smoke some weed and chase some Flügel shots with beer now, yeah

[Outro]
Na na na na, na na na na na na
We don't give a fuck
Na na na na, na na na na na na, ay
Na na na na, na na na na na na
We don't give a fuck
Na na na na, na na na na na na
