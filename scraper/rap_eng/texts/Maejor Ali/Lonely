[Intro: Trey Songz & Wash]
Ay, girl, ay girl, ay girl
Ay, girl, ay girl, Wash, ay girl
Ay, girl, ay, girl, Trey, ay girl, let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Soon as we get up out this club
Girl, I wanna take you to my bedroom, room
As soon as you get in this car, let your seat back
Girl, I'm gonna zoom, zoom
Girl, you belong to me and I belong to you
Once we leave the club, I got some things we can do
Your body so amazing, got a nigga crazy
So go'n drop it low, baby, I can use the entertainment
Do it slow
You don't know what you do to me
Bring it back some more
You know this turn me on and I can't wait 'til we leave

[Pre-Chorus: Wash]
Club gon' close in a minute, baby, are you rollin'?
Let's take one more shot, baby, I'm goin'
You know I wanna get you in my bed tonight, tonight
Girl, I promise I'ma do your body right

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I don't wanna leave from here lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna sleep lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely
No, not tonight, not tonight
I don't want you to be lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't want you to sleep lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely
No, not tonight, not tonight

[Verse 2: Wash]
When you come over, just step into my room girl, step into my room girl
Got something special just for you girl, special just for you girl
And I really can't wait for you to get it
Just relax, let me end up in this
See I'ma give you what you want, guaranteed to turn you on
No phones will be ringing, no, no
And I promise to do everything that your body desires
Girl, yes I do

[Pre-Chorus: Wash]
Club gon' close in a minute, baby, are you rollin'?
Let's take one more shot, baby, I'm goin'
You know I wanna get you in my bed tonight, tonight
Girl, I promise I'ma do your body right

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I don't wanna leave from here lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna sleep lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely
No, not tonight, not tonight
I don't want you to be lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't want you to sleep lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely
No, not tonight, not tonight, hold it

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
I know what you're thinkin'
I just wanna hit it and quit it, then forget about it
I know what you're feeling
You're turned on but you don't wanna get turned on when you're turned gone
Either you gon' ride or you ain't though
Probably won't need a lie but I can though
I'ma tell you the truth girl, you all I wanna do
I just wanna be with you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I don't wanna leave from here lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna sleep lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely
No, not tonight, not tonight
I don't want you to be lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't want you to sleep lonely, lonely, lonely
I don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely
No, not tonight, not tonight, hold it

[Outro: Trey Sogz]
You looking for your girl and that's where she's gon' be
