[Intro:]
Ghetto, ghetto
Oh lord!
I've been praying for you
Hallelujah

[Hook:]
It is easy as 1, 2, 3
I wanna be what's on TV
And if that's wrong, please don't blame me
Cause where I live we have nothing
In the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

[Verse 1:]
Little kids growing up without no education
Mom's on drugs, cause that's her only medication
Nobody's home, but they ain't on a vacation
But they left the kids alone watching the TV station
What's wrong with the picture, please, someone give me the answers
They be wondering why the girls grow up to be dancers
Then we wonder why the boys grow up to be dealers
And they be angry at the whole world ready to kill us
How do we start to resolve the whole problem
How we let our little children just turn into goblins
Why we got them all killing and stealing and robbing
We need to plan a little seed to prevent the mobbing
Why don't we teach them that science to reach for the stars?
Cause they can beat the fire with the future worst than odds
Don't want them looking in the past and covering scars
They need a path out the ghetto, ghetto, hello!

[Hook:]
It is easy as 1, 2, 3
I wanna be what's on TV
And if that's wrong, please don't blame me
Cause where I live we have nothing
In the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

[Verse 2:]
Little boy had a dream of being a ball player
Cause little homie wanna grow to be a rhyme slayer
Little missy wanna grow to be a model
While the momma at home just drinking out the bottle
How come they don't want to grow to be a councilman?
Senator, a governor, a major politician man
Probably cause the politicians nearly keep on tricking 'em
Promise that they fixing it but they ain't really fixing it
That's why they want to be like me
Like Jigga, like B and Nicky and Ree
Every day in the ghetto is an emergency
But the power that be don't emerge in see
That's why you see killing, that's why you see crimes
That's why you see homies in the prison doing time
That's why you see crack, that's why you see blackstrap
But no access out the ghetto, ghetto

[Hook:]
It is easy as 1, 2, 3
I wanna be what's on TV
And if that's wrong, please don't blame me
Cause where I live we have nothing
In the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

[Outro:]
Ghetto, ghetto
Oh lord!
I've been praying for you
Hallelujah
