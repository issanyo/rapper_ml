[Intro]
Oh-aye-oh-aye, oh-aye-oh-aye, oh-aye-oh-aye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I won't let the night stand in my way
I know what I want, I know what I can, yeah
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is lay down next you

[Chorus]
Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby, give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need tonight

[Verse 2]
See I've made mistakes time after time, time, time
But no, not today
Won't leave 'til I find what I'm looking for
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do
Is dance under the moon

[Chorus]
Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby, give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need tonight

[Bridge]
Your love is like a roller coaster
The way that you take my breath away
It feels like I'm slowly falling
Deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper

[Chorus]
Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby, give it to me
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need tonight
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need
Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need tonight
