[Hook: Maejor]
I can't believe, I can’t believe, I can't believe, I can't believe
What happened last night, I’m barely sober
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need, I think I need
To come back down, the party's over
There were two drunk girls in the bathroom
My boys dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
Can't believe that we going do the same thing tonight

[Verse 1: Saca]
I can't believe what we did last night
We gon' do the same thing tonight
But it could be a little different
Cos' you know I'm always try'na make a difference
We got a lot of time, we ain’t gonna miss it
You came here alone, your boyfriend is missin’
I'm try’na get you home girl that's my mission
And you know we take off like a missile
Let the night go, you ain't gotta race it
Let the night flow, don't be impatient
If there’s a problem you know I'm gonna face it
And this is my life, I wouldn't want to change it

[Hook: Maejor]
I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe
What happened last night, I'm barely sober
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need, I think I need

There were two drunk girls in the bathroom
My boys dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
Can't believe that we going do the same thing tonight

[Verse 2: Maejor]
I hope the weather man call for sunshine
I woke up drunk with my girl on my mind
I only think about her sometimes
I wish that dad would call me son at least one time
Whatever
I take a sip of this dom pizzy and gets busy
I hope this pizza from last night can get me right
I hope my cell phones charged, ah shit its not
I guess i'll wear the same thing, shit, its all I got
Wasted, faded, really shit face-ted
Yeah this is my life and I wouldn't want to change it
We go all out, party till we fall out
If you do the same thing, holla (oh yeah)

[Hook: Maejor]
I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe
What happened last night, I'm barely sober
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need, I think I need

My boys dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
