[Verse 1]
Club night
Drunk as what
Hommies tryna sober up
All my nigga's in this bitch
Pretty girls all in this shit
Shorty go, lights low
Maejor on the radio
She say this her favorite song
I say baby you know what you want
The night is still so young, baby
And when she starts to dance
She leaves me in a trance

[Hook:]
I told her baby I'm so
Mesmerized by you
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take care of you
Cause when the thing go low
I don't know what to do
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take good care of you
Got me mesmerized by you

[Verse 2]
Stop, woah
Where she go?
Where she go?
There she go
Love the way you're workin' yo
Ooh you so professional
Say your from the city
But you come out here to have some fun
Shorty's so sidity
But she pretty
Baby you know what you want
The night is still so young, baby
Every time you start to dance
You leave me in a trance

[Hook:]
I told her baby I'm so
Mesmerized by you
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take care of you
Cause when the things go wrong
I don't know what to do
So I'm a leave out nothing
I'll take good care of you
Got me mesmerized by you

I pulled up in my vico
She looked out the peep-hole
Opened up
Say hurry up
She get on me that she called
She had dinner ready
She are hers already
Pinot Grigio and spaghetti
I looked up next thing you know

Her dress flew over her head
Her bra stayed off of her shoulders
She looked right at me and said
Uh, oh baby come over
Her panties slid down her leg
I couldn't keep my composure
So after it was all over
I just broke down and I told her

[Hook:]
I told her baby I'm so
Mesmerized by you
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take care of you
Cause when the things go wrong
I don't know what to do
So I'm a leave out nothing
I'll take good care of you
Got me mesmerized by you
