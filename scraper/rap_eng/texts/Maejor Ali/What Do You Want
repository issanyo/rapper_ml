[Verse 1]
What are you complaining for, you don't appreciate me, no
You say you do what's hard to tell
I'll give you everything you need, maybe you should be a queen
Or I should be with someone else

[Hook]
So make it clear, first this, everything is fine
Next second, you wanna fight
Baby just make up your mind

[Chorus]
Tell me your problem
Baby be honest
What do you want from me?
Learning you slowly
Need you to show me
What do you want from me?
From me
What do you - want from me?
(What do you want from me?)

[Verse 2]
Always going back and forth, steady tryna ask for more
Tell me where you crossed the line
Baby just say what it is, so I know what I need to fix
So I can make you feel alright

[Hook]
So make it clear, first this, everything is fine
Next second, you wanna fight
Baby just make up your mind

[Chorus]
Tell me your problem
Baby be honest
What do you want from me?
Learning you slowly
Need you to show me
What do you want from me?
From me
What do you - want from me?
(What do you want from me?)

[Bridge]
Oh ey, say what you need, girl, I mean what you say?
Oh ey, I surrender, I don't wanna play no games

[Outro]
Tell me your problem
Baby be honest
What do you want from me?
Learning you slowly
Need you to show me
What do you want from me?
