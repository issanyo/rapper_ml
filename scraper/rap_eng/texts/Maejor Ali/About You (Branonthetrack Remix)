[Intro: Trey Songz]
Ay, this for you, baby
You know who I'm talkin' to

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl, I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names, but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move

[Verse 1: Branonthetrack]
Did this for you, so you know wassup
I ain't really down with games, you're the one I want
Don't really gotta think twice
Take my hand, let me show you what a man like
I ain't like them other dudes, I'm different
Your friends don't like me, so they always start trippin'
I'm missin' you every time I get lonely
Always right there when you text me, "Come, homie"
I, know you the one
So gon' give it to me, I'm the one you trust
Let go of whatever past
I got everything I need to make sure that you're my last
I got everything you want, so baby put it down
Know exactly what to do to make you wanna smile
You know this for you
Stop playin', baby, you know how I do
How I do, how I do

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl, I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names, but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move
Girl, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?
I bet you think this song is about you
Yeah, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?
I bet you think this song is about you

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Call up all your friends on the phone right now
Tell 'em all to come up to the room right now
It's a lot of things we could do right now
'Bout to get another room right now
Front desk calling up, saying, "Turn that down"
Take another puff, baby, burn that now
It's a lot of girls, it's a ton
You know you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]]
Got a room full of fly girls, got a thing for a shy girl
Don't you want to be my girl? It's all about you
Get up on it like you should, girl
'Cause I love it when a hood girl, turn around and be a good girl

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl, I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names, but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move
Girl, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?
I bet you think this song is about you
Yeah, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?
I bet you think this song is about you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl, I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names, but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move
