[Intro]
Ay, this for you, baby, you know who I'm talkin' to

[Chorus]
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl, I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names, but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move

[Verse 1]
Calling all the cuties to the floor right now
It's a lot of booty on the floor right now
Take it to the bus, we can go right now
We can roll right now, right now
It's some pretty titties on the bus right now
Tell the hotel we pulling up right now
Elevator up, take a ride right now
Baby, ride right now, right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a room full of fly girls, got a thing for a shy girl
Don't you want to be my girl? It's all about you
Get up on it like you should, girl
'Cause I love it when a hood girl turn around and be a good girl

[Chorus]
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl, I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names, but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move
Girl, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?
I bet you think this song is about you
Yeah, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?
I bet you think this song is about you

[Verse 2]
Call up all your friends on the phone right now
Tell 'em all to come up to the room right now
It's a lot of things we could do right now
'Bout to get another room right now
Front desk calling up, saying, "Turn that down"
Take another puff, baby, burn that now
It's a lot of girls, it's a ton
You know you're the one

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a room full of fly girls, got a thing for a shy girl
Don't you want to be my girl? It's all about you
Get up on it like you should, girl
'Cause I love it when a hood girl turn around and be a good girl

[Chorus]
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl, I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names, but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move
Girl, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?
I bet you think this song is about you
Yeah, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?
I bet you think this song is about you
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl, I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names, but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move

[Outro]
Girl, you know it's all about you
