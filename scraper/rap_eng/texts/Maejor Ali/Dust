[Verse 1]
Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without my muse
Nothing special, every book in here I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them
But there's no erasing and the best advice I got
Was keep writing, and keep living, and keep loving

[Hook]
And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust

[Verse 2]
Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without your smile
Nothing special, I fell in love with you girl
You let yourself inside with no respect for privacy
You said there's too much on my mind
Then you ripped out a page and set that shit on flame
I quit writing, I kept living, I kept loving

[Hook]
And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust
