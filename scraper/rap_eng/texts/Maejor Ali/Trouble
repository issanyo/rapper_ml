Yeah, invitations in the whirlwind
We both bad at it
Told myself no more hittin’ niggas girlfriends
Thats my old bad habit
Here you go, wearin' that
Already know, what I’m staring at
I mean from top to bottom your body is problem so
Somebody better take care of that
And who
Better than, the nigga in the Letterman
When your man ain't home, you can let him in
Late night Letterman
I ain't gon' tat-a-tale
Damn your ass bad as hell
