[Hook 1: Bow Wow]
Girl I wanna make you sweat
I love the way you do it like that
She a keeper, she keep that pussy wet
She a slurper til it ain't nothing left
The way she drop it on the floor
And baby I know what you want

I’m riding in the ‘gatti with the windows full of steam

[Hook 2 x2: Bow Wow]
Boom let it out now
You're a freak baby, gon’ let it out now

Tell me when you’re coming baby, I’ma come too
You’re a pretty little thing, shawty I can’t even lie
You racking up them sky miles cause you stay fly
You do it so well, you don’t even gotta try
Got a nigga staring out the corner of my eye

And the way her body be banging
I swear you gotta be drinking every bottle in the club
Wake up with a story to tell
I’m just tryna have some fun, and I ain't looking for love

[Hooks 1 & 2: Bow Wow]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Sweating so hard you need three or four towels
Shawty wanna be my boo like showtime at the Apollo
Weezy F, the 'F' for follow, follow me straight to my condo
And get freaky bring you over, hit that ass just like a rhino
I’m from Hollygrove, I still hang with Elz
I make them bitches (HUH), they waiting to exhale
I’m on some gangsta shit, I knock your head off
You bark up my tree, thats a dead dog
Where them hoes at? tell 'em I said wassup

[Hooks 1 & 2: Bow Wow]

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
Say you got friends shawty, you can bring 'em too

Yeah, she got a diva attitude
Fell in love with me when she saw my tattoo
An’ I ain't like these other niggas girl, cause they lame
These niggas ain't ballin’ baby, sub me in the game
Got so drunk shit, I forgot her name
Whippin' that Bugatti while she givin’ me brain

[Bridge: Bow Wow]

Bursting outta them jeans

Cause you killin’ these other hoes
And I dont mean to be mean, but shawty I’m trying to fuhhh...
