[Verse 1]
So here we go with this again, running at them lips again
Yelling in my ear and shit, all I hear is whispering
No matter what it is, she always start to bitching and
Tripping and I almost start to call that girl a bitch again
So I blaze out the house, in a rage out the house
Shawty got a sharp tongue, she spit blades out her mouth
I throw my stunnas on, I chop blades out the house
She get to growling and I'm out, it's like a cage in the house
Phone on silent and I'm wilding 'cause I'm 'bout
Five shots of Henny in, man, I'm making plenty friends
Black, White, Dominican, back right, I break it in
This is the act right, I need to take it in, let's go
I been drinking tryna take my mind up off all the yelling and all the screaming
But all that it's doing is taking me far from your loving
Got this girl in my ear, telling me what I don't need to hear
Sipping what I'm sipping and she 'bout to catch me slipping

[Chorus]
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home

[Verse 2]
Now she's grinding and the way she popping that thang
Dropping that thang, reminds me, it ain't a girl in this world like mines
Wish she come find me, it's gettin heated up, if she keep it up, we gon' be leaving here
Sipping what I'm sipping and she 'bout to catch me slipping

[Chorus]
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home

[Bridge]
Now I look around and all I see is cuties, booties bouncing all around
I'm tryna keep myself from going down
With all the love I give you, all you ever do is frown
Sipping what I'm sipping and she 'bout to catch me slipping

[Chorus]
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
