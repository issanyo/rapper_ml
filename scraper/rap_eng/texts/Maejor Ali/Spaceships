[Intro]
Attention, attention
I warn you
Those guys are amazing

[Chorus]
Dance when the bass hit, dab on the spaceship
Me and all my motherfuckin' homies goin' apeshit
I'm hella high, bruh, I cannot lie, bruh
I got that motherfuckin' look in my eye, bruh
Pull up in that skrrt skrrt
Got yo main thing lookin' at us like "what's up?"
Spending all these bands so these girls, they showin' love
How could I be down? Every day I'm counting up
1, 2, 3, 4 shots, we don't give a fuck

[Refrain]
Just left Miami, I'm going back to Cali
In the club with my family, going hard with my family
I don't need a lot, just a fuckin' few
A few loyal real G's, that's my fuckin' crew
Party 'til the late night, yes, we fuckin' do
Do we need another round? Yes, we fuckin' do
Yes, we fucking do, yes, we fuckin' do
I'm higher than my penthouse with the city view
Party 'til the late night, yes, we fuckin' do
Do we need another round? Yes, we fuckin'

[Chorus]
Dance when the bass hit, dab on the spaceship
Me and all my motherfuckin' homies goin' apeshit
I'm hella high, bruh, I cannot lie, bruh
I got that motherfuckin' look in my eye, bruh
Pull up in that skrrt skrrt
Got yo main thing lookin' at us like "what's up?"
Spending all these bands so these girls, they showin' love
How could I be down? Every day I'm counting up
1, 2, 3, 4 shots, we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck

[Refrain]
Those guys are amazing
I don't need a lot, just a fuckin' few
A few loyal real G's, that's my fuckin' crew
Party 'til the late night, yes, we fuckin' do
Do we need another round? Yes, we fuckin'

[Chorus]
Dance when the bass hit, dab on the spaceship
Me and all my motherfuckin' homies goin' apeshit
I'm hella high, bruh, I cannot lie, bruh

Got yo main thing lookin' at us like "what's up?"
Spending all these bands so these girls, they showin' love
How could I be down? Every day I'm counting up
1, 2, 3, 4 shots, we don't give a f-
