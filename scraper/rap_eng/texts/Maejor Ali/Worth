It's not worth it girl, i see the hurt in your eyes
Tell me why you want to be with a guy
Who hurt you and leave you every single night

No,no don't do it
Take him back than your foolish
Your worth more than gold girl
And you're man so clueless

Just relax and let me ease your mind
I know you been stressing all the time
Loving you the feeling feel so right
Let me, help you, see you, threw my eyes

Hook
He's not worth it
He's not worth it
It's not worth it

I'm not saying that I'm for you
I'm just saying that you need to

I know the love that you have
I know the tears that you shed
I know that you know that nigga should be in the past
He don't got it like that, Oh no

Baby i know
All the time you wasted
You told yourself just be patient
Under he don't love you girl
Under he's busy loving the world

Hook
He's not worth it
He's not worth it
It's not worth it
