I'm so glad you came, don't need to know your name
It doesn't really matter, it doesn't really matter
I'm faded on a low, I don't care where we go
It doesn't really matter, it doesn't really matter

[Verse]
Look at you
You only come around when the bottles out
You only come around when the models out
Where your ass be at when we be at the house?
All this money make people act different
All this money make your friends start trippin'
Funny how the haters start ass kissin'
But never mind it though
We just won't spend bends at the Gucci store

[Pre-Hook]
So you know girl, it might be a good move
You should roll girl, I don't know about you
But I wanna get fucked up, I wanna get fucked up
So I need some, take one or two more
And I need you, need you to do more
Get closer to me, baby
Tonight is amazing
