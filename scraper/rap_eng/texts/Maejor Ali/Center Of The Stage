[Intro: T-Pain & Bei Maejor]
Yeah, shawty, yeah
La, da, da, da
Bei Maejor are you ready? (Uh huh)
Bei Maejor are you ready? (Uh huh)
Do it for the 85 (0)
85 (0)
Let's go
Where she was?

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
She was in the center of the stage, showin' me love
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch
Maybe catch a grub, like it's only us
In the middle of the stage, showin' me love
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch
Maybe get some...

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I swear this girl so fineeee, she move me so fast
Putting creases in my t-shirt with her ass
Baby that's your theme song put it on the glass
I just wanna backstage pass
And you so fly, I just wanna do ya
Get ya to my crib and seduce ya
Shit I'll have you screamin "Hell yeah!", while I'm giving it to ya
Baby we can lay in my cooler?
So let me know, if I can be the one to show
How bad you make a nigga wanna go
To the ATM
And come back with a grand so I can see you

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
On center of the stage, showin' me love
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch
Maybe catch a grub, like it's only us
In the middle of the stage, showin' me love
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch
Maybe get some...

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
I thought I was the center of attraction till
I saw lil mama in action still
Ridiculous, wanna lick her like a liquorice
Tease her till that thang becomes ticklish
Got me throwing all my money on the floor
Cause she the baddest mutha'ucka on the floor
That's even when the lights come on
Not like these other chicks when the lights come on
Just wanna put her in the coupe and take her home
Center of the stage when I get shawty alone
Cause you bending over well, it looks like a car
Drove all the way up north just to see that booty south

[Chorus: Bei Major & R. Kelly]
On center of the stage, showin' me love (love)
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs (Shawty tell me what it is)
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch (touch you)
Maybe catch a grub, like it's only us
In the middle of the stage, showin' me love (middle of the stage, ooh)
I was so amazed, throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch (Baby what it is, touch)
Maybe get some...

[Bridge: T-Pain & R. Kelly]
T-Pain what she do?
She got me trippin, dawg
Shawty butt-naked, just getting off
I gotta deliver there I'm a tip it off
Already got her in club, shawty what it do tryna get in

[Pre-Chorus: Bei Maejor & R. Kelly]
You, you, you, you, you
I spend my chips on you
You, you, you, you, you (Spend my money, spend my money)

[Chorus: Bei Major & R. Kelly]
Once shawty on center of the stage, showin me love
I was so amazed throwin' up dubs (Dubs)
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch (I just wanna touch)
Maybe catch a grub, like it's only us
In the middle of the stage, showin me love (In the middle of the stage)
I was so amazed throwin' up dubs
Baby what it is? I just wanna touch (Baby what it is)
Maybe get some...
