When you're in love
Everything feels like it goes your way
And when you're in love
Everyday feels like the perfect day
And I hope that I feel this way forever
Hope that it's me and you together
And I don't wanna waste another moment
It's just me and you girl
And cupid has done it again

[Hook]
Got my head spinning around and around and around
And again here we go
Got my head spinning around and around and around

I don't know
Where I would be if it wasn't for you
But one thing's for sure
I'm so glad that I don't have to be without you
So I hope that I feel this way forever
And I hope that it's me and you together yeah

And I don't wanna waste another moment
It's just me and you girl
And cupid has done it again

Got my head spinning around and around and around
And again here we go
Got my head spinning around and around and around

Yeah
All around, all around
Got my head spinning round
All around, all around

It's just me and you girl
And cupid has done it again
Got my head spinning around and around and around
And again here we go
Got my head spinning around and around and around
