[Verse 1:]
Baby you're something new
I can confide in you
Baby you're real to me
The missing piece I need

So baby trust in me
And I will trust in you
Nothing is better
Than when we're together

[Pre-Chorus:]
(And) you never tried to bring no drama
You're the type of girl I bring to mamma
Somethings telling me within
To turn my player card back in

[Chorus:]
I'm on my way to your heart
So let me know where to start
You know you light up my dark
So even when we're apart
Show me the way
Show me the way (yeah)
Show me the way
Show me how to love you better
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way (yeah)
Show me the way
Show me how to love you better
Show me the way

[Verse 2:]
Just hear me out

Even when tears come out
Never turn me away
Just say that it will be ok

So baby just take my hand
I swear as long as I'm your man
With heaven above you
To show that I love you

[Pre-Chorus:]
You never tried to bring no drama
You're the type of girl I bring to mamma
Somethings telling me within
To turn my player card back in

[Chorus:]
I'm on my way to your heart
So let me know where to start
You know you light up my dark
So even when we're apart
Show me the way
Show me the way (yeah)
Show me the way
Show me how to love you better
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way (yeah)
Show me the way
Show me how to love you better
Show me the way
