[Intro]
This
This ain't even me

[Hook]
I'm wrong, I know
But when I get lit, I turn cold
I ain't gonna lie, I'm wrong, I know
But when I get faded, I turn cold
I turn cold

[Verse 1]
Come thru boomin' on the late night
Kung Fu kick it with the main guy
I want you, but we know we ain't right
Cause we both got somebody, but I want your body

[Pre-Hook 1]
I been thinkin' 'bout it
Tell me if you're 'bout it
Let me kiss around it
Feels so wet, I'm drowning

[Hook]
I-I-I'm wrong, I know
But when I get lit, I turn cold
I ain't gonna lie, I'm wrong, I know
But when I get faded, I turn cold
I turn cold

[Verse 2]
I only do this when I'm faded
I'm thinkin' 'bout your body naked
Outta everybody, you my favorite
You make it clap, standin' ovation

[Pre-Hook 2]
I been thinkin' 'bout it
Tell me if you're 'bout it
Let me kiss around it
Can your man do this, I doubt it

[Hook]
I-I-I'm wrong, I know
But when I get lit, I turn cold
I ain't gonna lie, I'm wrong, I know
But when I get faded, I turn cold
I turn cold

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Hook]
I-I-I'm wrong, I know
But when I get lit, I turn cold
I ain't gonna lie, I'm wrong, I know
But when I get faded, I turn cold
I turn cold

[Bridge]
Yeah, I think it's
I think it's only right that
I say what i mean
And I mean what I say

[Beat switch]

[Verse 3]
Ironic how the same things that make me feel so good make me act so bad
Ironic how we never really miss the things that we have until it's what we had
And I know it would probably break your heart
I'm under pressures
I don't think you understand
And ever since Adam bit the apple
This is the curse i have to battle, as a man


[Outro]
Just know if you ever need me
I'm always right there for you
Brought something to the table
I pull out the chair for you
Never would level up
Cause no one else above you
You say you hate it when i hang up with no "I love you"...
