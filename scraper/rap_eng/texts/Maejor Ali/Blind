[Verse 1]
He left his heart at the counter, met a stranger in a foreign town
They say the city was pretty, they say what goes around comes back around
And then there's a sound, what's that sound? That, that's panic
A schizophrenic, psychopathic lover

[Chorus]
But through his eyes, she looks so beautiful
But through his eyes, she looks so harmless
And out of the sky, pain starts falling down
And out of the sky, his eyes go blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind

[Verse 2]
He left his face on the table, put his nose smack dead on the line
And you can check at the bar, he's the talk of the town, now, now, now, now
His new love can no longer be found, hey what's that sound?
Listen out for the sound of paramedics, just forget it, he should have seen it

[Chorus]
But through his eyes, she looks so beautiful
But through his eyes, she looks so harmless
And out of the sky, pain starts falling down
And out of the sky, his eyes go blind, blind
But through his eyes, she looks so beautiful
But through his eyes, she looks so harmless
[And out of the sky, pain starts falling down
And there ain't no way to run, ain't no way to hide](6886226
[But through his eyes, she looks so beautiful
But through his eyes, she looks so harmless](6886217)
And out of the sky, pain starts falling down
And out of the sky, his eyes go blind, blind

[Outro]
His eyes go blind, blind, blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind, through his eyes
And out of the sky, pain starts falling down, pain, pain, pain
And out of the sky, his eyes go blind,blind, blind
