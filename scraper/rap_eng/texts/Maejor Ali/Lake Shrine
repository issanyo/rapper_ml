[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been thinking 'bout you
Just wanna make sure you're still okay
And I'm not sure if it's still cool
'Cause every time you want me and I push away

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me who you are when the time's right
Open up my heart when my mind's right
I don't wanna sleep on the wrong side
I don't wanna think that it's alright
Looking for a sign that you're still there
Even when I'm silent, you're still there
I wanna believe that you're out there

[Chorus]
So I keep reaching out to you
I try and try, but I don't know if I'm getting through
Sometimes I wonder, can you hear me calling out your name?
And when I need to talk it's like you're always too far away
I need your love, I need you now

[Verse 2]
Lately, I've been on a new wave
Be lying if I said I don't remember when
I come and see you every Sunday
I kind of miss how it was all so simple then

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking for a sign that you're still there
Even when I'm silent, you're still there
I wanna believe that you're out there

[Chorus]
Can you hear me calling out your name?
And when I need to talk it's like you're always too far away
I need your love, I need you now

[Outro]
I need you now
Love deserves no space for compromise
It is the actions we take to discover the [?]
Not a drop for those seeking externally affirm
But rather within, [?]
