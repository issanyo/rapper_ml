[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I came up in this party, time to twerk
I came up in this party and I'm turnt
I came up in this party, time to twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
South side up in this, east side on the floor
West side throw it up, north side by the pole
Okay, I'm Nascar and I'm moving faster than you've ever seen before
No turning keys, I'm turnt up like ''Push the button, go''
Turn the house to the club, what it's hitting on?
Tell the DJ run it back, have a sing-along
Tell the niggas come through, they can turn up too
Like Rodney King, we can all get along
23's on my feet what I'm sitting on
Gotta walk a straight line, what you tripping on?
Every day in the news tryna start something new
About to find out who they been picking on, Twist

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I'll valet the car, throw me the keys
It's time to go, girl you're coming with me
Girl I've been looking for you for a while now
I would come and talk to you, but it's loud now
Girl, we can take it slow
Don't need nobody to know
Let me see you get out on the floor, girl
We gon' party all night until it's over

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Yeah girl, I can't believe what you do to me
Got a feeling that I'm running out of time
And I really hope that you come closer
Closer, closer, closer, closer

[Verse 3: Lil Twist]
Look, close up on that, hold up on that, Twizzy 'bout to post up on that
Don't waste time we both need, don't regret this day when you leave
Just get sprung off that, don't back off that, once you turn on, you can't turn back
Can't believe what I see, Miley Ray just dropped it on me, twerk

[Chorus]
