[Verse 1]
Because I text you 20 times and got no response, no (cha-cha-cha-cha)
Because you didn't bother callin' me not even once (not even once)
Not one call, forreal? (Cha-cha-cha-cha)
Because I already got more than half the bottle down, down, down, down (cha-cha-cha-cha)
I guess it don't make any sense to stop now, no, still got some issues to drown (cha-cha-cha-cha)

[Chorus]
I'm thinkin' I'm gon' need another one, before I'm completely done
If they got somethin' to say, tell 'em it's my birthday
Tell 'em it's my birthday, I ain't drivin' anyway
I might as well get throwed
I'm tipsy singin', oh, woah, oh
'Cause you don't know my life
And I'm within my right
Man I'm faded singin', oh, woah, oh
Don't talk about it just pour me up
Just pour me up man, yeah
Just pour me up man
I'm not numb yet so just pour me up man (woah, woah, woah, woah)
Yeah, just pour me up man (woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
If I ain't seeing double (seein' double) then I ain't in no trouble
I can still feel the trouble in my head, I need a double
And don't mix mine with nothing, see Iâ€™m runnin from somethin
Sit back and judge like it's just me that's runnin', runnin' to the bar who comin'

[Chorus]
I'm gon' need another one, before I'm completely done
If they got somethin' to say, tell 'em it's my birthday
Tell 'em it's my birthday, I ain't drivin' anyway
I might as well get throwed
I'm tipsy singin', oh, woah, oh
'Cause you don't know my life
And I'm within my right
Man I'm faded singin', oh, woah, oh
Don't talk about it just pour me up (cha-cha-cha-cha)

[Bridge]
I don't know what you been through
But I bet you got problems, we all damn do
In the name of the struggle, I'm raisin' a toast
To forgettin' about, what you stressin' the most tonight
Oh, woah, oh, woah
Man, I'm faded singin'
Oh, woah, oh, woah
Just pour me up
(Pour me up man)

[Chorus]
Tipsy singin', oh, woah, oh
'Cause you don't know my life
And I'm within my right
Man I'm faded singin', oh, woah, oh
Don't talk about it just pour me up
Just pour me up man
