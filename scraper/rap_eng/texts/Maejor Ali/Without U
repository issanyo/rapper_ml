[Intro]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

[Verse 1]
Oh, I might've slept for about an hour
Before reality woke me
Got out of bed, went and took a shower
I did 'em both by my lonely
Put on my clothes and started my day
Yeah, it ain't a daze
Then I realized, that I don't gotta take you to work
I lay back down and close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
What we were, that's all gone
'Cause I've been spending my days alone
Now my home don't feel like home
'Cause I've been spending my days alone
You're still wifey in my phone
But I've been spending my days alone
I just realized I'm not that strong
I've been spendin'

[Chorus]
I don't wanna spend another day without you, girl
I don't wanna spend another day without you, girl
I can't spend another with you in my head
I can't spend another day with you MIA
Pretending I am when I'm not okay
I don't wanna spend another day without you, girl
Without you, girl (oh woah, yeah, oh woah)

[Verse 2]
You got me tripping on somethin'
Where you going? Where you been?
Who you be with it? Who is that?
Which of them niggas is she with and which is yours?
Then it clicks suddenly that you ain't gotta explain shit for me no more, for me me no more
'Cause there ain't no us, there ain't no we no more
'Got me broken down, I got my knees on the floor
My head in my hands, shell of a man, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
What we were, that's all gone
'Cause I've been spending my days alone
Now my home don't feel like home
'Cause I've been spending my days alone
You're still wifey in my phone
But I've been spending my days alone
I just realized I'm not that strong
I've been spendin'

[Chorus]
I don't wanna spend another day without you, girl
I don't wanna spend another day without you, girl
I can't spend another with you in my head
I can't spend another day with you MIA
Pretending I am when I'm not okay
I don't wanna spend another day without you, girl
Without you, girl

[Outro]
Not another day without you
Not another day without you
Not another day without you
Not another day without you
Not another day without you
Not another day without you
Not another day without you
Not another day without you
