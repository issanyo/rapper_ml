The truth is that your girl really loves me
Nails scratchin all on my back when she hugs me
I would let you know but it would get ugly
Jealousy burnin in your eyes when she touch me
Tells me her secrets, begs me to keep em
Calls when your leavin askin me to creep in
You would not believe it I really dont either
She knows that we brothers why she wanna come between us
Ohh, I think you should know the truth...
The truth is that I wish it never happened
Wish I could rewind wish that I could take it back and
Red lipstick places you can not imagine
Cellphone buzzin on the dresser she ain't answere
Know it was a mistake we just couldn't think straight
Left the club mad late pulled in the valet
She was at the bar sippin with her homegirls
And when she winked at me I forgot that it was your girl
Ohh, I think you should know the truth..
The Truth is that I don't know how to say this
The truth is that I know this is gonna sound crazy
Kept it from you so long now I can't take it
So I understand as a man if you hate me
You see we got a problem yea a little problem
See when I hooked up with your girl we never bothered
To reach for protection we made an exception
So we made love no glove in the westin
So the mornin after got the mornin after
Before she took the first pill Told me how she really feel
She wanna have my babies he think im the one
The boy that you think is yours may not be your son
Ohh, I think you should know (im sorry) the truth..
