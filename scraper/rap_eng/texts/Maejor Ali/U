Turn your radio up
Turn your radio up, yeah yeah
Turn your radio up

Ain't no other shawty I've heard of baby
I'd put a million on that, that, that, that
I took my world and gave you half of it baby
I pray you never give it back, back, back, back
I love your style, love your smile
I love your eyes, they look like diamonds to me
So you can have it all, all of it baby
In your favorite store blowing stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks

Because I know
That all my dreams are comin' true, yeah
And I know-ow-ow-ow
I'll never feel the way I feel girl
'Bout anyone but you, oh baby, you yeah you
You, oh baby, you yeah you
You, yeah you

See I'll go up and get a star for you baby
Pick it out and bring it back, back, back, back
Glad you opened up your heart for me baby
And I ain't lyin' it's a fact, fact, fact

I remember us sitting up late in my one bedroom apartment
Memories runnin' through my head, head, head, head
You the only one I want, if you were to leave me, (what?)
I don't know what I would do instead, stead, stead
Cause I love ya, I love ya
Even if I'm tempted
I swear I'd never put on of them others above ya
Hopin' I could get along with ya big brothers
Cause I'm in it for the long haul like truckers
Party in love and them purple labeled kisses
Just give me a minute and I'll be making you my Mrs
We can look exquisite
Trips to the Pacific
Look up to the sky like "look Mema, I did it"

Because I know
That all my dreams are comin' true, yeah
And I know-ow-ow-ow
I'll never feel the way I feel girl
'Bout anyone but you, oh baby, you yeah you
You, oh baby, you yeah you
You, oh baby, you yeah you
You, oh baby, you yeah you
You, yeah you

Turn your radio up
Turn your radio up, yeah yeah
Turn your radio up
Turn your radio up, yeah yeah
Baby throw your hands up
See you throw your hands up, yeah yeah
Let me see them hands up
Let me see them hands up, yeah yeah

Because I know, (without a doubt)
That all my dreams are comin' true, yeah
And I know-ow-ow-ow
I'll never feel the way I feel girl
'Bout anyone but you, oh baby, you yeah you
You, oh baby, you yeah you
You, oh baby, you yeah you
You, oh baby, you yeah you
You, yeah you
