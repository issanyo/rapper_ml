[Verse 1 - Ben J]
How did I end up in this club?
Man I swear I'm goin crazy
And I can not find my phone
And I need to call me baby
If she saw what I was doin
She would probably wanna drop me
But I can not stop right now
Cause-cause right now this party got me feelin goooood
Yeah, let's do it up tonight
Ain't worryin about tomorrow
Man I'm livin life l-l-llike a baller shouuuuld
Yeah tell me we ain't goin hard
This goes out to all of y'all (y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all)

[Hook - Bei Maejor]
Party party party people come say whassup (WHASSUP!)
Yeah baby baby start me up
So a sexy sexy lady's gonna show me love
Yeah baby baby start me up...
Party party people come say whassup (WHASSUP!)
Yeah baby baby start me up

[Verse 2 - Legacy]
I-I ain't on that picture but I be goin HAM
Hella boppers on my gold and some bottles in they hand
I don't see they boyfriend and they guys
That surround 'em when they near
Need a Twitter for my dick
You follow wanna be my guest I'm feelin goooood
Function got me lit
Jealous of our taste, muggin man I wish a nigga wouuuuld
Yeah I call their bluff
If he set for the club, down so start me up-up-up-up

[Hook][x2]

[Outro - Legacy]

Start me up, me up, me up
