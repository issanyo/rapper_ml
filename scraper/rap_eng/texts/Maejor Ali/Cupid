NEW LLOYD!

[Verse 1: Lloyd + (Awesome Jones)]
When you're in love
Everything feels like it goes your way
And when you're in love (sup baby)
Everyday feels like the perfect day

[Hook: Lloyd]
And I hope that I feel this way forever
I hope that it's me and you together
And I don't wanna waste another moment
It's just me and you girl
And Cupid has done it again
Got my head spinning around
Around and around
And again.. Here we go
Got my head spinning around
Around and around

[Verse 2: Lloyd + (Polow da Don)]
I don't know (I don't know baby)
Where I would be if it wasn't for you
And one thing's for sure (come on)
I'm so glad that I don't have to be without you (You girl!)

[Hook: Lloyd + (Polow da Don)]
And I hope that I feel this way forever
I hope that it's me and you together (come on girl)
And I don't wanna waste another moment
It's just me and you girl
And Cupid has done it again
Got my head spinning around
Around and around
And again.. Here we go (Yeah.. Yeah!)
Got my head spinning around
Around and around

[Outro: Lloyd + (Polow da Don)]
