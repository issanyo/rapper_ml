[Intro: Tyga]
Yeah, wait for a minute
Yeah, can you wait for a minute?
Yeah, wait for a minute
Wait for a minute, girl, just a minute

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Well if you walk with me
Well if you take my hand babe
We can go to a place you ain't never seen before (Yeah)
Woah

[Refrain: Justin Bieber & Tyga]
Slow dance in the moonlight (Moonlight)
I'm just tryna set the mood right (Mood right)
I'm just doin' what I do
Do it over and over and over
Quickly, wanna run with me now?
Swiftly just come with me, now
Footsteps go to the beat, now
Over and over and over

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Tyga]
It’s just the way that, the way that
The way that you do it, babe (Yeah)
Well, I can say that, say that, say that I'd behave
But I'd be lyin', babe

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Tyga]
Let's run away for a minute (Wait for a minute)
Away for a minute, babe (Away for a minute)
Let's run away for a minute (Play for a minute)
A dream place for a minute
Place for a minute, baby

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Hol' up, I don't need no luck
I said that with a straight face, baby, that's poker
Feelin' lil sober, gotta mix it in my soda
I clean up good, a ropa dopa
Baby I'm the shh, but that's a good odor
I'm a young star, but my money look Yoda
Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit
You hatin' on the internet, I couldn't even notice
Tickets, no service, we at the top workin'
Pop-pops is lurkin', told her "Don't get nervous"
I don't swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby
Ferarris and horses, I snap like tourist
No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important
I'm all about a dollar, babe, banks call me Georgi
9-5 Rollie, 96 Kobe
Tonight we gon' ball like Ginobili, you know me
I'm just tryna...

[Refrain: Justin Bieber & Tyga]
Slow dance in the moonlight (Yeah)
I'm just tryna set the mood right (Mood right)
I'm just doin' what I do
Do it over and over and over
Quickly, wanna run with me now?
Swiftly just come with me, now
Footsteps go to the beat, now
Over and over and over

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Tyga]
It’s just the way that, the way that
The way that you do it, babe (Yeah, why she do it like that?)
Well, I can say that, say that, say that I'd behave
But I'd be lyin', babe (I'd be lyin', though)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Tyga]
Let's run away for a minute (Wait for a minute)
Away for a minute, babe (Away for a minute)
Let's run away for a minute (Wait for a minute)
A dream place for a minute
Place for a minute, baby

[Outro: Tyga & Justin Bieber]
Wait for a minute, yeah
Can you wait for a minute?
Yeah, wait for a minute
Wait for a minute
Baby girl, just a minute
Wait just a minute
Can you wait just a minute?
Baby girl, just a minute
Wait just a minute
Wait just a minute
Yeah, T-Raww, JB
Too fly, never stop
Know why?
