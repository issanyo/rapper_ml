[Intro]
My love, my love, yeah
My love, my love

[Chorus]
It's always the same
My love will never change
My love always the same
My love, my love

[Verse 1]
So much love for you, every part of you
Deep inside of you, watching over you
These are my thoughts with you, remember I said to you
You're always stressing me, I'm always blessing you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts to see you cry yourself to sleep all night, oh
'Cause I know that we can make it better if we try, oh

[Chorus]
It's always the same
My love will never change
My love always the same
My love, my love
The same
My love will never change
My love always the same
My love, my love

[Verse 2]
Don't even notice me, I'm there protecting you
While you're neglecting me, I keep on blessing you
You know you don't deserve half of what I give you
But it's okay with me 'cause I'm a child to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts to see you cry yourself to sleep at night, at night
'Cause I know that we can make it better if we try, oh

[Chorus]
It's always the same
My love will never change
My love always the same
My love, my love

[Outro]
This society, you are led to believe things are like a straight line
If I do this will I get that?
Life does not work like that, it's not something we buy
But most important it's not something we seek
Seeking is the destruction of our sanity
Almost all relationships are entered before we have taken the time
To discover who we truly are and how we love to love our self with the present moment
