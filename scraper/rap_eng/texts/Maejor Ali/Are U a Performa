[Intro: Trey Songz]
Songz, Songbook baby
Bei Maejor, the Prince is back

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Oh baby, you looking so fantaboulus, oh
You making me wanna chase you for the best though
I'm just a hustler, I make the money double, triple
Let's move some furniture and cause a little trouble
Oh, you know you doing your thing
Look at your body, it bangs
The show you giving me in insane
And I just wanna know one thing, baby

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Are you a performer?
I bet you dance in the mirror
To see your body more clearer
Throw your clothes in the corner
All I wanna know is
Are you a performer?
I bet you dance in the mirror
To see your body more clearer
Throw your clothes in the corner

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Look like a scene from a new video role
Stuffed up in them jeans, is the thing that is so swole
And I can dance on you, like popping on a local
Trick you like a tazer 'cause your body godown so slow
Damn, you know you doing your thing
Queen, can I be your King?
The show you giving is insane
And I just wanna know one thing, baby

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Are you a performer?
I bet you dance in the mirror
To see your body more clearer
Throw your clothes in the corner
All I wanna know is
Are you a performer?
I bet you dance in the mirror
To see your body more clearer
Throw your clothes in the corner
Are you a performer?

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
You know you make me wonder
This what I wanna do shawty
Make it rain, for ya baby
Make it rain, for ya baby
Make it rain, for ya baby
Make it rain, for ya baby

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Now 50 had 21 questions, but I only got one
Are you a performer? Are you that one?
Do your dance in the mirror all by yourself
You could do it, do it 'til you run out of breath
Yeah, she got a arch in her back
Yeah, she know how to throw it back
Yeah, I think I like it like that
Yeah, I'ma spin a couple stacks
Any time she walk by, it seem like we caught eye
Love her sweat, love her style, them shawty talk fly
Then stand on the beach, she make grands on her feet
I gotta see ya once a week, I think shortie on to me
Or could it be she diggin' me? A couple shots of Hennessy
In between the sheets in the suite is where we finna be
Lights off, dress gone, nibble on my neck bone
Sayin' that she love me while she scratchin' with her press ons

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Are you a performer?
I bet you dance in the mirror
To see your body more clearer
Throw your clothes in the corner
All I wanna know is
Are you a performer?
I bet you dance in the mirror
Throw your clothes in the corner
All I wanna know is
Are you a performer?
Are you a performer?
Are you a performer?
Are you a performer?
I bet you dance in the mirror
To see your body more clearer
Throw your clothes in the corner
All I wanna know is
Are you a performer?
I bet you dance in the mirror
Throw your clothes in the corner
