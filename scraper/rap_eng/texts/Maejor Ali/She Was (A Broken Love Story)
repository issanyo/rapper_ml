[Verse]

She was always one of the flyest
All dressed up ahead of her time and
She had a smile that shine like diamonds
With long hair the same colour as almonds
I always wanted to wife it
She the kinda girl you wanna spend your life with
But, I never did get a chance why?
'cuz she always had a man
And he was captain of the football team
The biggest thing around on the football scenes
Yeah
He was the talk of the town
Signing autographs when he's walking around
And I was just the quiet kid in the math class
To say something now 'gain to make the class laugh
And everytime she would look back
I'd damn near have a heart attack
So every year before the summer would start
I'd write a love letter and I'd pour out my heart
But she was so far outta my range
That I never got the courage to deliver the page
So as I saw her walk across the stage
A part of me died on graduation day
'kuz even though we never spoke one time
I thought I lost the only chance to make her mine
A couple years past, College was great
Just got a new job, I'mma move to L.A
The big city lights were always my dream
I'm just hoping that everything is all what it seems
So as I'm packing away
I found my year book, I had circled her name
And even though it may seem wild
Just seeing her face made me smile
Long flight I had just touched down
It felt like all night and I had just touched ground
Walking through the airport hallways
I saw a face that I remember for always
It was the same girl from high school
It's being a couple years, She's probably 22
Or maybe she was 23
That's right, She's a year ahead of me
I almost broke into tears
But I held it all together, Ive being waiting for years
Plus I practice in the mirror every friday
A little speech incase I see her what I might say

So as I saw her walk past
Im thinking I'd be damned if I missed my chance
And as I called her name I was scared
But I had to let my heart overpower my fears
She turned around with her eyes wide
Yeah, I started thinking I'd died
Because she started walking over
Yeah, she started coming closer
I had to check for my heartbeat
'kuz this couldn't be real, hardly
She asked me "have I been cool"?
Because she hasn't seen me since school
And by then I was in love
Because I didn't think she'd know who I was
I asked bout her man, She ain't with him
He went away to college hasnt hit since then
Yes, I never heard news so good
I told her I never thought I would
Be standing face-to-face with my high school love
And she said...yh you so sweet
I always used to think you were the cutest thing
I used to have the biggest crush on you in the tenth grade
She said I used to think about you all the time
I always wondered why you never said hi
(I was scared)
So I just let my crush fade away
So as we sat over coffee in the airport hall
Recited every old letter I could recall
(As I read)
She smiled, she can't believe she didn't see then
So I said, I may be jumping off the deep end
But if your heart's open maybe I could creep in
She said that will be cool
But I'm getting married next weekend
