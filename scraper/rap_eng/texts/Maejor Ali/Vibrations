[Verse 1]
Lately you've been making changes I see you
Maybe you misplacing anger
I need to be committed when I listen
Your heartbeat is the rhythm of religion to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Rolling, rolling, rolling we went on a wave
Living in the moment was the only way

[Chorus]
What goes around comes around
It’s been that way forever
What goes up must come down
Before the pain turns to pleasure
Everything comes in time
Everything comes in time

[Verse 2]
Always chasing inspiration where she go
Holding onto Revelations I need those
So consistent in my vision
The feeling has potential for addiction to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Rolling, rolling, rolling we went on a wave
Running from the devil when we needed faith

[Chorus]
What goes around comes around
It’s been that way forever
What goes up must come down
Before the pain turns to pleasure
Everything comes in time
Everything comes in time

[Bridge]
When your heart don’t look down
Baby release the pressure
When it’s all falling down put yourself together
Everything comes in time
Everything comes in time

[Outro]
