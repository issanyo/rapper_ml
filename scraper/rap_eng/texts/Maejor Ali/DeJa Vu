[Chorus]
Everywhere I look
Everywhere I turn
Everything reminds me of you
There is no escape
I can't get away
Of forever deja vu
Voices say you're near
I'm goin' inside
Never felt a love so cruel
Everywhere I look
Everywhere I turn
Everything reminds me of you

[Verse 1]
Can't get you off of my mind, I try to fight it
Your memory is the loudest when it's quiet
Now that you're gone, you got my full undivided, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm livin' life, but it's not the same
Come back home and I'll make sure you're safe
Deja vu can make you feel the pain
Just wait
And ever since we went different ways
It's really hard for me to be okay
Deja vu can make you feel the pain
Just wait

[Chorus]
Everywhere I look
Everywhere I turn
Everything reminds me of you
There is no escape
I can't get away
Of forever deja vu
Voices say you're near
I'm goin' inside
Never felt a love so cruel
Everywhere I look
Everywhere I turn
Everything reminds me of you

[Verse 2]
When will it end 'cause I can't keep goin' like this?
Get me a sign and I'll find you where you're hiding
Noise in my head, I need a moment of silence, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm livin' life, but it's not the same
Come back home and I'll make sure you're safe
Deja vu can make you feel the pain
Just wait
And ever since we went different ways
It's really hard for me to be okay
Deja vu can make you feel the pain
Just wait

[Chorus]
Everywhere I look
Everywhere I turn
Everything reminds me of you
There is no escape
I can't get away
Of forever deja vu
Voices say you're near
I'm goin' inside
Never felt a love so cruel
Everywhere I look
Everywhere I turn
Everything reminds me of you
