[Verse 1]
I always know
Sometimes I just let it go
I'm watching you, watching you, yeah

Words from the soul
Speak outside of my control
They tell me things
That are true (true)

[Chorus]
I know there's something going on
My intuition is never wrong
(Intuition)
I know there's something going on (Intuition)
My intuition is never wrong

[Verse 2]
I'm listening
To songs that your lips don't sing
They tell me things
About you, yeah

Envisioning
Visions that your eyes can't see
They show me things
That are true, that are true

[Chorus]
I know there's something going on (Intuition, intuition)
My intuition is never wrong (Intuition, intuition)
I know there's something going on (Intuition, intuition)
My intuition is never wrong (Intuition, intuition)
(Intuition, intuition)
(Intuition, intuition)
