[Verse 1: French Montana]
Take her phone and her ID
C-C-Can't post me on IG
Know them thots they be creeping
Tryna catch a selfie while I'm sleeping
Go to far you need a passport
See them shots coming got a glass quart
Thots try to camcord
That's a long shot I'm shootin from half court

[Chorus: Wash]
Can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Verse 2: Wash]
A thot is a girl that look for bottles
As soon as she come in the club
You can find her at my table flirting with the ballers
Tryna go for a cup
Crazy part shorty bad as fuck
Doing squats all day working on her butt
She know that'll make a nigga go nuts
That's what she want

[Bridge: Wash]
She ain't tryna pay for anything if anything
She tryna get a wedding ring
But me and my niggas ain't no cuffing no nothing
And her favorite thing to hear a dude say is
You might get a pair of nice shoes and a bag
Money ain't nothing baby I'll spend it fast on you
Baby I'll spend it fast on you

[Chorus: Wash]
That's when I found out that you can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Verse 3: Wash]
A thot is a girl that look for sparkles
As soon as she come in the club
You can spot her up at the bar until she see them lights
Then she coming on over here with us
Ain't no shame in her game
She bring her friends too and
They be tryna act like they not with her
But they be drinking too

[Bridge: Wash]
She ain't tryna pay for anything if anything
She tryna get a wedding ring
But me and my niggas ain't no cuffing no nothing
And her favorite thing to hear a dude say is
You might get a pair of nice shoes and a bag
Money ain't nothing baby I'll spend it fast on you
Baby I'll spend it fast on you

[Chorus: Wash]
That's when I found out that you can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Verse 4: French Montana]
(Thots be like) I need nice shoes and a bag
Need a dough boy with it bad
(Thots be like) I got the best pussy and the best head
Need my boobs and my ass did
(Thots be like) I know you got smoke and some drink
Tonight I'm goin hard in the paint
(Thots be like) If you love me like he say he did
He'll move me where he say he live

[Chorus: Wash]
You can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Outro]
Can't trust thots
