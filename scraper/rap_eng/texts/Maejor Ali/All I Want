[Verse 1: Evan Ross]
Baby tell me why, why I've gotta try
So hard, you've got me craving your attention
Baby I can't lie, not a day go by
I hope I see my name up in your mention

[Pre-Chorus: Brittany O'Grady]
Boys is calling me but I don't really care
'Cause baby you're all I need
And all I need is what I want
What I want, I want you

[Chorus: Evan Ross, Brittany O'Grady]
They keep on talking but all I want is you
They keep on looking but all I want is you
They give me everything but everything ain't you
I want you, I want you
They keep on talking but all I want is you
They keep on looking but all I want is you
They give me everything but everything ain't you
I want you, I want you

[Verse 2: Brittany O'Grady]
Baby tell the truth, what I gotta do
To get you with your arms around my body
What I gotta lose, lose I'm telling you
How I feel, I'm hoping that you're ready

[Pre-Chorus: Evan Ross]
Voices calling me but I don't really care
'Cause baby you're all I need
And all I need is what I want
What I want, I want you

[Chorus: Evan Ross, Brittany O'Grady]
They keep on talking but all I want is you
They keep on looking but all I want is you
They give me everything but everything ain't you
I want you, I want you
They keep on talking but all I want is you
They keep on looking but all I want is you
They give me everything but everything ain't you
I want you, I want you

[Bridge: Brittany O'Grady, Evan Ross]
Baby tell me, baby, baby, baby tell
Baby tell me, baby, baby, baby tell
Baby tell me, baby, baby, baby tell
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
Baby tell me, baby, baby, baby tell
Baby tell me, baby, baby, baby tell
Baby tell me, baby, baby, baby tell
What I gotta do, what I gotta do

[Chorus: Evan Ross, Brittany O'Grady]
They keep on talking but all I want is you
They keep on looking but all I want is you
They give me everything but everything ain't you
I want you, I want you
They keep on talking but all I want is you
They keep on looking but all I want is you
They give me everything but everything ain't you
I want you, I want you
