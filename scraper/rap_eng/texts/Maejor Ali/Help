[Verse 1: Blackbear]
Lately, I've been thinking 'bout checking myself into rehab, woof
And lately, I've been drinking too much
Sniffing yak out a dimebag
I've been taking these pills
That this doctor prescribed
But they don't get me high
Like they used to
And maybe it's time for divine intervention
But fuck it, I'll die how I want to

[Chorus: Blackbear]
How I want to, how I want to
Get high if I want to
Fly where I want to, I do
What I want to
Take your girl if I want to
Fuck her how you want to
I do, whatever it is I wish to

[Verse 2: Blackbear]
Lately, I've been waking up to these sounds of these sirens and gunshots, woof
And lately, I've been going to sleep with my head fucking pounding, ow
I've been taking my time
With these women around
Cause I don't fucking doubt
They want babies
And maybe it's time to go check myself in
But fuck it, I'll die going crazy

[Pre-Chorus: Blackbear]
How I want to
Like we all do

[Chorus: Blackbear]
How I want to, how I want to
Get high if I want to
Fly where I want to, I do
What I want to
Take your girl if I want to
Fuck her how you want to
I do, whatever it is I wish to

[Bridge: Blackbear]
I, I do, whatever I want to
Oh yeah

[Verse 3: Maejor]
What's up, Bear?
I've been worrying about you lately, man
I was lookin' at some of your pictures
You was lookin' a little crazy, man
Your eyes was hazy, man
And it's cool to have fun
But maybe think for just once
How your girl would feel if she lost her baby, man
You know, we need you 'round for a while
You really make fly music
I used to hide my pain in drugs
I hope that's not what you're doin'
You should maybe try somethin' different
Other than prescriptions
Like findin' religion or designin' a vision
It's your decision

[Chorus: Blackbear and Maejor]
How I want to, how I want to
Get high if I want to
I'm worried about you, Bear
Fly where I want to, I do
What I want to
Take your girl if I want to
Fuck her how you want to
I do, whatever it is I wish to

[Outro: Blackbear]
I, I do, whatever I want to
Oh yeah
