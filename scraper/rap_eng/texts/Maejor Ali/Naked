[Intro]
Come here
Relax
Let me take control
I want to take you on a journey
(Take off, Blast off, Lift off)

[Verse 1]
See girl it's looking like you're ready
And it's obvious that it's all because of the places I kissed on you
You say you wanna give it to me
And you ain't gotta wait no more
I'mma pay you back for the day you've been through
I know everything you like
And you know that's how to make it right for me
When I jump up in that body
Baby bring that ass to me
Girl put on your seatbelt it's gone be a ride

[Hook]
Cause you are so amazing when you're naked
And oh ah these are the sounds that we'll be making
When we take off, blast off, lift off
When we take off, blast off, lift off

[Verse 1]
See I'mma make sure that you feel me
I'mma take you deep, go in between, make love to you
Cause girl it's seeming like you're ready
So I'm about to take you up no parachute yeah
I know everything you like
And you know that's how to make it right for me
When I jump up on that body
Baby bring that ass to me
Girl put on your seatbelt it's gone be a ride

[Hook]
Cause you are so amazing when you're naked
And ooh oh these are the sounds that we'll be making
When we take off, blast off, lift off
When we take off, blast off, lift off

Take off

Cause you are so amazing when you're naked
And ooh oh these are the sounds that we'll be making
When we take off, blast off, lift off
When we take off, blast off, lift off
