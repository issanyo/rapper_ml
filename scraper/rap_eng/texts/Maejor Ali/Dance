[Verse 1]
No hesitation, don't keep me waiting
No reservations, don't fight temptation

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I'm taking the lead, can I trust you to follow?
And if we make it to sleep, will you love me tomorrow?
Before we throw it away, I don't want you to say
I don't want you to say another word, just

[Chorus]
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
When the music feels so right
I want your body next to mine
So dance with me, baby
Just dance with me, baby

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you break all the rules and still feels right, feels nice
This time let's break all the rules and go all night, all night
When you looking for love in the wrong place, what do you find?
When you searching for something that's always been inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so if I'm taking the lead, can I trust you to  follow?
And if we make it to sleep, will you love me tomorrow?
Before we throw it away, I don't want you to say
I don't want you to say another word, just

[Verse 3]
All I want to do is rock, rock, link and pop
Meet me at my crib at dawn
So much love, where do we start?
This shit sound like dirty pop
Pop, pop, listen here
Just make your intentions clear
If you feel what I feel in here
It's clear you need to

[Chorus]
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
When the music feels so right
I want your body next to mine
So dance with me, baby
Just dance with me, baby
When the music feels so right
I want your body next to mine
So dance with me, baby
Just dance with me, baby

[Outro]
When the music feels so right
I want your body next to mine
So dance with me, baby
Just dance with me, baby
