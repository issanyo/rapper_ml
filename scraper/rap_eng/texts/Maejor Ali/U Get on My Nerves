[Intro]
(Jazmine talking on the phone)
Hello?
Ugh....
Why are you calling my phone again?
Look, I told you this was over
I don't want to hear it
Look, there's nothing you can say to change my mind
No, I moved on
What?

[Verse 1: (Ne-Yo)]
Well, I didn't call to have a convo
I just think I've might left some of my clothes over your house
A couple shirts and a hat
So if you didn't burn it, can I get it back?

Now what is you yelling at me for?
I don't give a damn if your with your new boo
You always tryna get loud
That's why we not together now!
Listen, I don't give a damn that you moved on
Cause anything I felt for you, been gone
I was done from the time that you busted my window. (My Window.)
And any time that I think about missing you
I remember the stress that you put me through
The time I lost, how much it cost
So now I want you to know:

[Chorus: (Ne-Yo)]
Oh, and I swear I don't know how we lasted that long
You get on my damn nerves
Damn nerves
Damn nerves
I'm glad we're not together now!

And now I'm all right cause with you everything was all wrong
You get on my damn nerves
My damn nerves
My damn nerves
So glad we're not together now!

(Jazmine):
So glad we're not together now

(Ne-Yo:)
So glad we're not together now

(Jazmine:)
Oh oh oo oo, so glad we're not together now

[Verse 2: (Jazmine)]
I know why you called but it won't work
This ain't bout a watch or a T-shirt
But if that's what you wanna stick with
I can have your shit Fed Exed in the mornin'

So I guess this is finished
I'll get someone to send it
There should be no reason you should ever dial my digits
You should never ever have to call me up pretending
Cause, baby, I know you're pretending!

See I don't wanna fight cause there ain't the point
It's sad that you called just to hear my voice

You should have known I was done
When I busted your window!

You won't say it, but I know that you need me back
And I'm glad I can sing I don't need you back!
I did my part, you broke my heart
But I won't make the same mistakes again!

[Chorus]
Oh, and I swear I don't know how we lasted that long
You get on my damn nerves
Damn nerves
Damn nerves
I'm glad we're not together now!

And now I'm all right cause with you everything was all wrong
You get on my damn nerves
Damn nerves
Damn nerves
So glad we're not together now!

[Bridge: (Ne-Yo)]
I ain't gonna lie
I think about if we could try and make it work one more time
Could we do it?

(Jazmine:)
Could we do it again, babe?

(Jazmine:)
I'll admit it, it cross my mind
If it's something we can handle
Then, something clicks inside

(Both)
I remember I can't stand you

(Jazmine)
No, no!

(Ne-Yo)
Noo

(Both)
No, No
Oh no, no no no!

[Chorus: (Ne-Yo)]
And I swear I don't know how we lasted that long
You get on my damn nerves
Damn nerves
Damn nerves
So glad we're not together now!

(Jazmine:)
And now I'm all right cause with you everything was all wrong
You get on my damn nerves
Damn nerves
Damn nerves
So glad we're not together now!
