Id be so happy if I could find you it'd brighten my day
This lonely heart makes me so blue so
I wrote to Nicky to help me find you find him right away
So I can send my love to you
Ive searched so near and far
And wished on shooting stars
I've crossed my fingers what more can I do
I'd ask cupid to play
But hes to far away
So I hope this christmas brings my lovin true

(chorus)
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Send my love whereever you are
Wherever you are with me I found
Send my love whereever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Send my love whereever you are
Wherever you are with me I found
Send my love whereever you are
Ive been so good this year
And kept my wishes clear
No birthday gifts no clothes no fancy shoes
Dont want expensive things
No cars and diamond rings
Just someone I can love and cherish too
And I'd be so happy if I could find you it'd brighten my day
This lonely heart makes me so blue so
So I've wrote to Nicky to help me find you find you right away
So I can send my love to you

(chorus)
I'd ask cupid to play
But hes to far away
So I hope this christmas brings my lovin true
And I'd be so happy if I could find you it'd brighten my day
This lonely heart makes me so blue so
So I've wrote to Nicky to help me find you find you right away
So I can send my love to you

(chorus)
