[Bridge]
I bet she be in the gym
Working on her fitness
Her body is a crime, I’m a witness
It look like love when she get it
She got us so tight
Damn she could get the bidness

[Hook]
Go head go head, go hard go hard
Now work, and sweat and work, and sweat
And work, and sweat and work, and sweat
Go skinny girl, go skinny girl, go (x4)
Go head go head, go hard go hard (x2)
Now work, and sweat and work, and sweat
Go skinny girl, go skinny girl, go

[Verse 1]
Bet she be in the gym, working on her body
Doing pole dances, knocking on Pilates
Working all day, but when she get home
Go so hard she could fit her old dress on
Stupid high heels with a little dress on
Abs so right, but that ass dead wrong
Shawty Listerine Momma love to feel the burn
Tearing up the treadmill
Sweating out her perm

[Verse 2]
Bet she be in the club, and I ain’t talking dance
Lifetime chance of a lifetime, damn
Every man in his right mind, probably take a glance
Had to do some squats just to get up in her pants
Ah yah, ah man, she got me in a trance
Had a kid then her body snap back rubber band
She always on a diet, homie she don’t really need it
Them other girls jealous of it, she don’t even see it
I’m ma say how I see it don’t mean make you conceited
But girl, you a star, are you related to Venus
Baby girl you a princess, you’re related to Xena
Tryna lock your ass down, do I need a subpoena
