[Verse 1]
Said I can feel it comin' on
My face is numb
And I completely say this without slurrin' all night long
Said I think I'm done but I'd take one more if you pourin' up
And you look just like me (ooh, woo)
Smilin' for nothin', you sippin' somethin', girl, I can tell
Say I don't know what this gon' be
But I'm here for a good time and the bottom line, is just right here

[Chorus]
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the things that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the things that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin', girl

[Bridge]
I'm, gon' say it, say it again
I'm gon' say it again, girl
Say it, say it, say it again
I'm gon' say it again, ayy

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know what your song is (I know what your song is)
When the DJ playin' it, you be in your moment (you be in your moment)
Put it on me, baby, watchin' you whinin' your hips
Wonderin' if, you're goin' home or comin' with me after this, woo
And you look just like me, mmm
You got your eyes closed, we dancin' so slow just like that
Said I don't know what this gon' be
But if you're here for a good time and that's the bottom line, sing this here

[Chorus]
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin', girl
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin'
Girl, I like you
I like the fact that you like to
Do the thing that I like to do
You gon' have one more shot to tell me somethin', girl
