[Hook]
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Go ahead shake what your momma gave you
Girl let me see you on your worst behavior
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Go ahead shake what your momma gave you
Girl let me see you on your worst behavior

[Verse 1]
Okay, shake what you got on the floor
Shake it real good, go and drop it down low
I'm tryna see you bounce to the bass line
Hands on your waist line
'Bout to get it popping here we go
I'm feeling so good, hands up
Aye girl, won't you let me fill your cup?
V.I.P cause we hate lines
Later we can Face Time
Then let's have some play time, what's up?

[Pre-Hook]
I just wanna see you speed it up and slow it down now
I swear that ass is royalty, I'm 'bout to bow down
All these girlies they be pumping up my sound now
So baby, turn it up and crank it
I just wanna see you shake it, shake

[Hook]
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Go ahead shake what your momma gave you
Girl let me see you on your worst behavior
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Go ahead shake what your momma gave you
Girl let me see you on your worst behavior

[Verse 2]
Look, the way you shake it girl, I swear you breaking necks
If you leave with me, you already know what's next
We gonna take it from the club, to the car to the crib to the bed
I'mma make sure this a night you won't forget
And when I saw that ass walk past, almost spilled my drink
And the music's on blast, so I can't even think
We should take another shot, then let's take it to my spot
Bet your clothes gonna be off before you blink

[Pre-Hook]
I just wanna see you speed it up and slow it down now
I swear that ass is royalty, I'm 'bout to bow down
All these girlies they be pumping up my sound now
So baby, turn it up and crank it
I just wanna see you shake it, shake

[Hook]
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Go ahead shake what your momma gave you
Girl let me see you on your worst behavior
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Go ahead shake what your momma gave you
Girl let me see you on your worst behavior

[Bridge]
Stop, let me see your hands up
You looking good baby, let me switch your plans up
Drop, baby show me what you got
What you waiting for? You gonna shake it girl or not
Stop, let me see your hands up
You looking good baby, let me switch your plans up
Drop, baby show me what you got
What you waiting for? You gonna shake it girl or not

[Hook]
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
