[Verse 1]
I was down on my luck one night
Then I saw her face
When she make it wind to the drums
All of my problems erased
Your body is paradise
Tonight I'm escaping
Like a shot of tequila
Her love is intoxicating
Oh the way she put it on me I feel like I owe the girl
If i lost it all I still be the richest man in the world
Cause in my sky you're the only star
It's your song you know who you are

[Chorus]
And I just want to thank you
And I just want to thank you
And I just want to thank you
Just want to thank you
For giving me that work
(Herbal time)
For giving me that work
(Herbal time)
For giving me that work
(Herbal time)
For giving me that work
(Herbal time)
Girl I love it when you
(Wind wind)
Put it on me now

Oh I love it when you
(Wind wind)
Put it on me now
