[Intro]
This is dedicated to..
This, this, this is dedicated to..
Hmm... Well, if you feeling like I'm feeling
This is dedicated to you

[Verse 1]
Well, I've been the super girlfriend
Let you think that nothing bothered me
Like when you go out with your friends
And people bring me back the stories
The stories about them other girls
Bout this one and that one, and those three
So when I ask a simple question (where were you last night?)
You wanna yell and scream and try to flip it on me

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, no (No, no)
Is anybody else just fed up?
If you heard it all before, 'fore, 'fore
Then right where you are just get up, eh

[Chorus]
Somebody say I don't want it anymore (I don't want it anymore)
Somebody say I don't want it anymore (I don't want it anymore)
Because I dried my eyes and I realized, that I deserve somebody
That'll treat me right
Somebody say I don't want it anymore (I don't want it anymore)
Somebody say I don't want it anymore (I don't want it anymore)
Because I know my worth so you can keep that drama
I don't want it anymore. Oh oh oh oh, not anymore

[Verse 2]
Hmm, No more settling for less. I'm looking for that kind of man
That's gonna give his best cause I'm giving my best
A man that wants to cherish this, and know exactly how to move me
Not some silly little boy, who want my goodies cause he took me to the movies

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

Oh, oh, oh, oh not anymore (not anymore)
Oh, oh, oh, oh not anymore (walking out the door)
Oh, oh, oh, oh not anymore (No, not anymore)
Oh, oh, oh, oh not anymore (oooooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh not anymore (noooooo)
Oh, oh, oh, oh not anymore (not no more, not no more, I'm gone)

[Bridge]
This is dedicated to.. (said I'm leaving today)
This, this, this is dedicated to.. (wipe the tears from my face)
Hmmm.. if you feeling like I'm feeling this is dedicated to you
(If you feel when I say)

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh oh, not anymore
