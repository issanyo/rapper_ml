[Intro: Keri Hilson]
One for the paper, two for the money
(My girls get money)
(Oh, we gonna give it to 'em now baby, hey!)

You see this what I like to call - buyou music
Cause you better buy you a car
You better buy you a phone
And you better buy you some where to stay
Or I'ma walk right by you
(Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, go!)

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I don't know what's goin' on baby

Used to take me to dinner
Used to take me shoppin', now you askin' me for my paper

No, you can't use the phone baby
I think you need to get your own

[Pre-Hook: Keri Hilson]
Was lookin' for a man to hold me down
But how'd I end up with you?
Yeah, baby you

Payin' all these bills, the note on my car
So I don't need no broke, broke boo tryna holla (holla)
So baby, shut it up 'til you show me dollars, hey

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, hey, hey, yeeeeeah, Cole World
I see ya, it's hard not to see ya (damn)
Face like Aaliyah and plus a college degree a
Climbin' up the ladder at that full-time job
Tell me how the hell you end up with a full-time slob? (good God)
I mean you been a ride a die for him
Paid for the dinner and the movie and the popcorn
How you figure it's gon' last? He just sit up on his ass
And play that damn Xbox that you copped for him (copped for him)
Buyou, buyou, how much to try you? (hey)
Ain't sayin' you for sale, but baby, let's be for real
Buyou, buyou, shit that I could buy you (hey)
These niggas all the same, either they Ken or Ryu
Stringin' you along, allow me to untie you
Vitamin D supply you, let them little boys walk by you
They frontin' cause they broke, but the numbers don't lie
If they swear they so fly, tell me why they never fly you?
