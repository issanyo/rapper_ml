[Intro: Maejor Ali]
When it all goes down, we still gon' be there
Keep your circle close my nigga
Choose wisely, who you remember, who you forget
You understand?
Everybody flow with you in the yacht
But will they save you when you drown?
They say it's lonely at the top
But I'm too fly to touch the ground

[Verse 1: Maejor Ali]
I lost a lot of people to this music, shit
Man, we don't talk no more
When I think about, it kinda hurts my heart
That we don't talk no more
See I'm blaming you and you blaming me
That we don't talk no more
We don't talk no more
We don't talk no more

[Verse 2: Maejor Ali]
All the different niggas that I went to school with
We don't talk no more
Niggas that I thought I would always be cool with
We don't talk no more
I remember cutting class for my nigga E
Damn we don't talk no more
We don't talk no more
We don't talk no more
We don't talk no more

[Verse 3: Maejor Ali]
Kinda miss my ex, we was real close
But shit we don't talk no more
He was always there when I need him most
But now we don't talk no more
Yeah little Gabrielle who I swore I'd marry
Shit we don't talk no more
We don't talk no more
Even we don't talk no more

[Verse 4: Maejor Ali]
I miss uncle Charlie miss miss auntie [?]
Damn we can't talk no more
God bless your souls, may you rest in peace
Damn, we can't talk no more
And I appreciate the things you taught me
Even tough we don't talk no more
We don't talk no more
We don't talk no more

[Hook: Sonna Rele] (x2)
It's a damn shame
How it all changed
Ain't  like it was before
Know I moved on
Still hold on to the memories
And it's no surprise
We don't realise
What we have until it's gone
Yeah, we don't talk no more
Now, we don't talk no more

[Verse 5: Maejor Ali]
To every pretty girl who ever held me down
I know we don't talk no more
I really understand that it was my fault
That we don't talk no more
See, I was just focused
It's the only reason we don't talk no more
So you know don't take it personal

[Verse 6: Maejor Ali]
And to my old label
I'm kinda glad that we don't talk no more
Since we parted ways I'm going H.A.M
Now that we don't talk no more
A lot of niggas here are lookin' bad
Now that we don't talk no more
We don't talk no more
We don't talk no more

[Verse 7: Maejor Ali]
She said I let the fame get to my head
That's why we don't talk no more
Bitch, I ain't famous yet, quit textin' me
We don't talk no more
A nigga got zero time for drama
That might be why we don't talk no more
If we don't talk no more

[Verse 8: Maejor Ali] (x2)
To everyone you love, make sure you tell 'em
'fore you don't talk no more
You never know, that time can come
When you don't talk no more
And I pray and never see the day
That we don't talk no more
We don't talk no more
We don't talk no more

[Hook]
