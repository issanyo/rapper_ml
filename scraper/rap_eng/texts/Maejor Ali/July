[Verse 1: Drake]
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let 'em all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple "I think that we’re ready"s
Couple "I think that we should we wait"s
Are we actin' like a couple ?I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes
And then

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

[Verse 2: Drake]
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

[Jhene Aiko]
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end
But then the season changed

[Drake]
You were my, you were my, you were my girl
Shoulda made, shoulda made you my world
Shoulda done everything to make you happy, baby
Oh yeah

[Jhene Aiko]
Can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And I’m too fly for this shit
Oh-a wooh
I am Japanese if you please
