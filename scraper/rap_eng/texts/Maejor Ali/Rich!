[Hook x2]
I be with the rich niggas, rich niggas
Ridin’ round with the rich niggas, rich niggas
Fuck with me and let’s get rich, nigga, rich nigga
One day we gone, I’ll be rich, nigga, rich nigga

[Verse]
Fuck with Major, let’s get rich, nigga
Follow me, let’s get some chips, nigga
Came through the hood in that Rarri
Fuck the songs, we make hits, nigga
Used to have a contract with Sony
Used to have a contract with Def Jam
I told ’em I need 2 mill to hold me
Nigga, I can start my own death jam
Throw the money up like a free throw
Throw the money up like a jump shot
200,000 dolla joyroll
Used to drive my nigga Leroy at the dope spot
In my city, I’m that hot boy
Run up on me, you get shot, boy
Pull up on yo bitch like skurt skurt
Bust so hard my fucking ankle hurt

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I’m on the phone with Puff Daddy, talking money
Checking ova, nigga, goddamn, Justin Bieber, more money
Niggas know the score, at the top it’s just us, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we up nigga!
In my Benz bumping 2Pac, made a couple bands off
Got your main thing in my penthouse
All she got on is some tube socks
Throw the money up like a free throw
Throw the money up like a jump shot
Pull up on yo bitch like skeet skeet
Surfboard, surfboard, this a wave, aye!
