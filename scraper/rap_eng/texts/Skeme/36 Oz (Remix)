[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Skeme]
All I ever wanted was some Jordan's and a gold chain
Now I need all 36 Oz out the whole thing
My watch be tellin' me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordan's and a gold chain
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like we don't deserve this
Once we get it started, ain't no way you could reverse this
We do this for real, it ain't no way to rehearse this
You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Helicopters flyin' 'round my house, like fuck 'em (fuck 'em)
You know that 12 stay investigatin', I don't trust 'em (no)
You done drove a long way, only sold you one-eighth
If you talkin' gunplay, niggas got that one way (buck, buck, buck)
Ticket to get stuck in traffic, I pull out then pass it, we drivin' them hearses
And your homies been wearin' your T-shirt, the pastor be speakin' them verses
We do this for real, I ain't got time to see no bird, bitch
I just pop a pill, this codeine got a nigga swervin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Skeme]
All I ever wanted was some Jordan's and a gold chain
Now I need all 36 Oz out the whole thing
My watch be tellin' me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordan's and a gold chain
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like we don't deserve this
Once we get it started, ain't no way you could reverse this
We do this for real, it ain't no way to rehearse this
You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch, yeah, yeah (buck, buck, buck)

[Verse 2: Skeme & (Chris Brown)]
I used to flip them things and get that change up out 'em (woo)
Young nigga done got that change but ain't shit changed about him (woo)
I put my neck down on the line, got 20 chains around it (ow!)
You ain't talkin' 'bout no money, we don't hear about it
Tell all your niggas we don't need the convo, I'ma have 20 hoes twerk at the condo
I been ridin' since the summer of '87, crazy thing, I wasn't born 'til the '9-0
All of them years, we was broke what I shine for, commas separatin' zeros like grown folk
I break a .9 out the motherfuckin' brick with my eyes closed

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Skeme]
All I ever wanted was some Jordan's and a gold chain
Now I need all 36 Oz out the whole thing
My watch be tellin' me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordan's and a gold chain
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like we don't deserve this
Once we get it started, ain't no way you could reverse this
We do this for real, it ain't no way to rehearse this
You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch, yeah, yeah (buck, buck, buck)

[Verse 3: Skeme & (Chris Brown)]
Snitches get stitches, I feel like you niggas some fakes and some bitches (ow! Woo)
These niggas will tell on they partners, just hopin' the judge give a break on the sentence (woo)
Hand on the wheel, I just handle my business and I wish Dolla Bill was livin' a witness (hey)
The way this lil nigga done round up them digits, man, I got that gift like it came with ribbon (hey)
I tell these liberty bitches that I ain't switchin' 'less we talkin' 'bout switchin' positions
I turn the wood to the world for my niggas, I hope that shit did make a difference
They dodge a homie 'cause of codeine I'm sippin', these glasses, homie, gave me Cartier vision
They hatin' on me, fakin' on me, but still I ain't trippin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Skeme]
All I ever wanted was some Jordan's and a gold chain (gold chain)
Now I need all 36 Oz out the whole thing (whole thing)
My watch be tellin' me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordan's and a gold chain
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like we don't deserve this (hey)
Once we get it started, ain't no way you could reverse this (ow!)
We do this for real, it ain't no way to rehearse this (hey)
You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch, yeah, yeah (buck, buck, buck)
