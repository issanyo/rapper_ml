[Intro]
Real niggas no fightin it i hope you die slow

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning call me a trip
Looked in the mirror like dawg i heard you don eh
Counting mah guap that i be winnin and turn on mah deck
Looked on mah fishers and told them it's time to get it
Unless the bank gives a statement a tell em talkin a savings
Pussy go with the payment get mah dick hard as the pavement
Ama motherfucking crazy niggas ain't go rob this steel trap door
Burglar bars on mah back door and am still sippin accto
As a Piss Pour nigga from the hood but i blow
Now am big dawg game sliding down chris shaw
Pedal to the floor european space ship
Pussy ass niggas stay quiet don't say shit

Live and die for this shit death before dishonour
Niggas snitchin bitches home

Holy ghost nigga i rebuke a broke nigga
Go forth and get yo smoke that's just the protocol
I leave you with a broken jordans cause you might a know
Run up on me bet you get how you want it

Hope out mah bed and take the knee and thank the man
And take a piss and wash amh hands

Imagine them in a pair of my new st laurent paris
Got a few facts in mah package that i promise

Young, Rich and Arrogant oh
Ain't comparing it dawg
When it real you get what's fake gotta know that ain't no comparison
Bitch don't compare me with y’all
That's just embarrassing dawg
You get high get you spot i suggest you cherish it dawg
Cause quick as it comes let there be quick as it go
My advice be to focus get dough and then get more
Just give me time to do mine
Watch mah game just evolve
And if it ain't bout progression
Well stress it i ain't involve
There too much for me out here to be playin with y’all
Either pay me whats mine or pay me no mind at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Got the drama chase cops
Live and die for this shit death before dishonour
Niggas snitchin bitches home

She say i'm the realest nigga im already know it
Am already know it
She say i'm the realest nigga i already know
