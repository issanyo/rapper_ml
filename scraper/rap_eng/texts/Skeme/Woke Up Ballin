[Verse 1: Joe Moses]
They said you'll never be shit
That's a mothafuckin' lie
Nigga put it on somethin'
On my mothafuckin' life
Passed on a lick and went so nigga rich
I'm hatin' myself, bitch fuck me wrist
I'm a D-boy rapper fuck the game, get a brick
Still fuck a bitch in my Chucks and shit
Everything red on my 6 6 6, fuck a bitch June 6th bought the ho a new 6
I'm stuntin' like bird get a bird and get down
Tell 'em get down when that chopper spits round
Every nigga 'round kick round Bruce Lee!
Fuck the P.O. and the fuckin' police!
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga?
Got a Hollywood bitch, but fuck Hollywood nigga
I'm so 5 4 got it tatted (5 4!)
And my homies like "keep this shit brackin"

[Hook: Joe Moses]
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Passed on a lick and I went and bought a foreign
A hunned on Guiseppe's I ain't never did Jones cause I went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Went to CK in a mothafuckin' [?]
Nigga I was 10 and my nigga did 10
He told me live life and don't trust no one
Shoot a nigga face in them new Air 1's
How many thots got they pussy on fleek!
And how many rappers put in work for the B!
Daddy [?] a plug, but he still here robbin'
He said treat a bitch like my nigga Bill Cosby

Fly ass eagle got your BM packin'
A town shit will get ugly with the weapon
Nigga I'm from V-A double N-E-S
Slide out west, 20 deep at the GS
Broke bitch [?] wit' yo' bitch ass
Niggas a lie to yo' momma wit' yo snitch ass

[Hook: Joe Moses]
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Passed on a lick and I went and bought a foreign
A hunned on Guiseppe's I ain't never did Jones cause I went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin
Went to sleep broke and I woke up ballin

My dog Joe said it's brackin in that [?] [?] it be
You niggas broke, ain't no love fo' 'em keepin' it G
