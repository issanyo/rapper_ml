[Hook: K. Roosevelt]
Girl ain’t this what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this what you needed, girl?
I’m just a nigga with some money
This what you wanted? You succeeded
Ain't this what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
What you wanted…

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Look, I’m on that drink, I be sippin
And this nigga I be trippin
Soon as money show up
What’s real come up missin
And my Cartier lenses
See they did stole my Benjies
Sippin and dinnin expensive liquors
Lately been doubtin my senses
So I just stays on this tip
Eyes locked on this grip
And the truth is I don’t do no actin but still I’mma stick to the script
We turn these late into great nights spending money that we made
So many dead faces like grave sites
Our main goal is get paid

[Hook:]
Girl ain’t this what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this what you needed, girl?
I’m just a nigga with some money
This what you wanted? You succeeded aye
Is this what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
What you wanted…

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Word! Fast life livin
Wood grain grippin
I been doin my thing lately
My lane ain’t switching
I got one hand on this wheel and the other hand on this business
And if we ain’t talkin bout paper then sorry but that convo ain’t in my interest
I ain’t forgot you
I just remembered just what you aksed for
But now I got it
And you suddenly seem to lack more
And now late nights seem great nights
Up in the same night side wit you
But these dolla sings take all my time
Nigga time this shit be the truth

[Hook:]
Girl ain’t this what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this what you needed, girl?
I’m just a nigga with some money
This what you wanted? You succeeded aye
Is this what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
Girl ain’t this just what you wanted?
What you wanted…

[Bridge x2:]
It used to be me and you
But it ain’t no mo, it ain’t no mo
And fuck yo friends cuz they don’t know, they don’t know
But ain’t this paper more important?
Ain’t this just what you wanted?

[Hook:]
