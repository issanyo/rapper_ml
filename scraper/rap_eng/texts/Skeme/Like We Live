(Intro)
I stay down and pour it up
My gold shinin, I blow it up
I stay down and pour it up
My gold shinin

(Verse)
Word! Chasin down a million fore I turn 25
And if they said I wasn’t shit then go and tell em that they lied
I bang Sace game forever, tell the dep you know that I rep
Took that long road and I’m on now and they wanna trace my steps
Sip that slow down, that screwed up, that Jim Jones that trill
Ask whoever it is you fuckin with and they’ll tell you that I’m real
I got dolla signs on dolla signs on dolla signs on commas
And you know I shit gold, man mo money mo problems word!

(Hook)
I stay down and pour it up
My gold shinin, I blow it up
I ain’t got no patience cus shit here for real
Ridin the fast lane, get fast change, now tell me how you feel
If you did the shit we did you might live like we live
Live like we live, live like we live
And if you did the shit we did you might live like we live
Live like we live, you might live like we live like we

(Verse)
Look niggas savvy in street smarts, I keep my flow on retard
Life moving kinda fast now and I ain’t pressin no restart
My game tidy, no leotard
Can’t be a part of my clique
I know new niggas that wanna be that cus they see now I’m getting rich
I’m a west side nigga with some dark south ways
Pourin 4, rockin gold and no I ain’t got time to play
See I ain’t signed no deal yet and I bet my name ring a bell
And if life is a bitch with me she never kiss and tell

(Hook)
I stay down and pour it up
My gold shinin, I blow it up
I ain’t got no patience cus shit here for real
Ridin the fast lane, get fast change, now tell me how you feel
If you did the shit we did you might live like we live
Live like we live, live like we live
And if you did the shit we did you might live like we live
Live like we live, you might live like we live like we

(Bridge)
I’m ridin, emcee it’s baby bitch and they tellin me wussup
Tellin me wussup, tellin me wussup
I’m ridin, emcee it’s baby bitch and they tellin me wussup
Tellin me wussup, tellin me wussup

(Verse)
Trill ain’t dead, good to see a nigga still livin
Rappers catch yo C’s up and shit a nigga drink but you see I’m still sippin
We gon live livin this until the end of this
Hope to be swimming cus know what the business is
My homies down so we bout this livin
Won’t break up my pivot, I’m grindin and givin
Fo sho

(Hook)
I stay down and pour it up
My gold shinin, I blow it up
I ain’t got no patience cus shit here for real
Ridin the fast lane, get fast change, now tell me how you feel
If you did the shit we did you might live like we live
Live like we live, live like we live
And if you did the shit we did you might live like we live
Live like we live, you might live like we live like we

(Outro)
I stay down and pour it up
My gold shinin, I blow it up
I stay down and pour it up
My gold shinin
