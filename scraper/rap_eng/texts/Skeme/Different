[Hook:]
I say I pull up in that Lamb and turn heads
Bitch I’m on fire, all we do is burn bread
This shit of mine, man it got em going crazy
Top floor, with the view, this shit amazing
Now just take one and look at it, you could tell that shit different
Tell that shit different, you could tell that shit different
Now just take one and look at it, you could tell that shit different
Tell that shit different, you could tell that shit different
Hold up!

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Pull up, hop out
Fuck it, it’s nothing
That money, my convo, don’t try to switch subjects
I got riders with choppas
And bitches with hoes
Stunting forever nigga just like we supposed
Now pour up that drink, laugh straight to that bank
We can’t see no limits like we riding around in that tank aye
You think you know but ain’t got no idea
I’m in that back to the future whip that don't drop till next year

[Hook:]


[Verse 2:]
You don't talk about it? I told it
Nigga say this shit, can you afford it?
These niggas is rats just like rodents
Click clack pow pow they reload it
Bitch I come down sippin potent
Realest nigga and you know it
They say they on with it but something wrong with it if me and my niggas just can’t notice
Nigga we winnin, it ain’t hard to tell that I’m cookin the [?], it ain’t hard to smell it
See bitch I’m a hustler so went to another
You bring it my way and I bet we could sell it
Refer that I to the N to the G
Shit that you talkin ain’t nothing to me
Run up on mine and I’m pullin this line
And I make sure you R to the I to the P
