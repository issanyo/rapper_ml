[Hook]
I ain't with no fraking all my juwels on flex
Every nigga ridin' with me pull up with extras
See I'mma die reppin'
We make money not excuses hope you haters get the message
Homie I ain't with no [?] all my juwels on flex
Every nigga ridin' with me pull up with extras
See I'mma die reppin'
We make money not excuses hope you haters get the message


[Verse 1]
Gold on my neck, gold of my wrist
Keep your hoe in check cause she be on my dick
Brand new hunnids, all blue money
Tell me where you function at, I fall through, stuntin'
[?] you ain't say shit
Young crooked rich, wrist gon' shine in they bitch
Okay, Ingle's on my tatts, [?] my racks
Trapper turned rapper bitch and I ain't goin' back
Nooo


[Hook]


[Verse 2]
Look
S-O-X, rep for my set
VVS ones, float on my neck
Bitch I been ballin', I'm workin' on my left
Five star mills, coversations with the [?]
See I been California, and my way [?]
I'm backseat chillin', top my chauffeur on her shoulder
I get my down dollas, pussy nigga holla
My chain so big I came in pop my collar
Crook!
