I fill my pockets up with green and stunt with my team
I fill my cup up with codeine
Im talking slow on that lean
I pull up on any scene i bought that foreign machine
Im drinkin dirty riding dirty bitch ain't nothin bout me clean
Im drinkin  dirty riding dirty bitch ain't nothin bout me clean
Im drinkin  dirty riding dirty bitch ain't nothin bout me clean
I fill my cup up with codeine
Im talking slow on that lean
Im drinkin dirty riding dirty bitch

[Verse 1]
I sip on that syrup like three six
I won't hit the street with a freak bitch
She always talkin that deep shit
I don't want to give her nothin but deep dick
I can't be blamed for the feeling
I made the world root for the villain
Bad bitches with me ready and willin
I buy the new coop then i tear up the ceiling
She give that pussy to me ima drill it
She know my paper Percy Miller, No Limit
What you callin ballin we call that a scrimmage
Draped in designers, i keep up my image
Too hard on the line for the shit that we shippin
We brought the pills so how you lil niggas trippin
I swear to god bodies ain't nothin but a digit
I have my lil nigga hop out 9 wicked
Father figure to ya niggas, been at em, been sonnin for years
Pull a pistol out on all these pussy niggas, hope you don't think you my peers
Poppin pain pills nigga cause we really  ain't got no time for the tears
Ain't got no time for emotions i poured up that 4 but i never lose focus

I sip on that Pimp and that Bun
Look whatcha lil nigga dun done
You went turn the boy into an animal
45 with the pearl handle gon handle you
Talk bout the keys ima bring a piano through
You know the flashing the majors and minors
We run that powder up, these niggas powered up
How you hate when yo account in the minus?
Guessin this shit got me tensed up
Young nigga just run the bands up
Soon as it drop ima go out and cop me the Benz truck
Ride around with the tints up
These niggas never gon see me
I can't leave the world cuz they need me
Im in this bitch, ain't never leavin, i hope that you niggas  believe me
Yeah i just wanna get the cake and then run through it
Yeah started out from serving, i done got numb to it
Yeah i see an opportunity to run to it
I sip on that ace and i'm lazy but how could you blame me
America, this how you made me

Hey heeey

Beat it up beat it up, she don't want slow mo
Hoppin on the stick like a bogo
I  just met some bitches, let some mo go
I don't chase hoes thats a no no
You be cuffin hoes like the po po
FN in lighter than the iphone it's with me every time i leave my home
Had to flood the Cartier wrist, getting menages with ya bitch
I just throw that money like a pitch
Told you i was gon do it and i got rich
Niggas pillow talkin like a bitch
Talking bout everything but how to get rich
I just gave a molly to ya bitch now she singing my name, karaoke all on my dick
I just spent a Mazi on my wrist
But i won't buy a Mazi cause that car a piece of shit
Smoking OG sippin ac, all these baby bottles in the show we ain't drinking similac
Say i couldn't do it and i did it
Drove it off the floor, this ain't rented, money ain't feed off the midget
Counting all these mufuckin digits
Mindin my own fuckin business, ah
