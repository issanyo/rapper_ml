Still riding with mah dog i was with when i came in nigga
Plus mine played to be the one and just caved in nigga
See i remember  how it was for the younger had his money up
Money up hey seem like everything i was doing weren't enough
As a young nigga i remember spending night with conscious and a door spot
Finger on the trigger before i fell asleep
Had to make sure that the boy don't lie
Had enough to blow out and go back and buy out the whole block
I mean every word i'm saying i don't want niggas think i'm playing i just hope not
Boy don't you know who yah dealing with If you do that lil silly shit
Fraud ass niggas and these bitches be working mah nerves like a motherfucking triple shit The biggest reason me and all these rappers is different

Activist double cup bitch then i drop it all i know
Is the hustle being broke never an option
Get me four in it baby i turn that shit to a nine
Turn that nine to half a key in the hood I'ma shine
But if i whip it whip it hard and i stay on the grind
Then i build a fucking house one brick at a time
Keep me a fo fo nigga that bitch iâ€™ll shoot through a yatch
You wanna show boat nigga we'll take whatever you got
Hit mah jewel melt your shit then it's straight to the lot

These hoes choosing and buying these designer shit for a pimp
Pull up in that benzo limo tinted your bitch break her neck just to see who in it
See ain't been the same ever since i hit it but i slip so deep but it's not my biness
I can feel you fall through the cartier lenses
Don't want to ride several dope out the trenches
I came a long for blocking and hopping the fences
Before i buy another car ama open up a biness
Day one niggas who i came with
Accounts Looking different but we on the same shit
Stacks hanging like a hundred round K clip
S.O.X. Gang bang we gave the gang a face lift
Say give ,my lord, nigga won't you get some
Its watch on me be yo whole year income
Ama gouple with that old nigga and some
Why haters got us niggas laughin like a sitcom
