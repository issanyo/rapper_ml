[Verse]
Now bet ya standing on my own 10 toes
And to my last 24, coutin' bank
And pourn' drank until i dont care about my woes
And as soon as I get some quap
I plot on how to get some more
A rich nigga still slidin' with those killas on the low
No new faces, its too late for them niggas I dont know
It ain't no hoppin on this wave now
Lil bitch you missed the boat
I fell in and out of love
I went from feeling high, then low
I had to get my mind right
And quit trippn about these hoes
Now im workin tripple shifts
Like this shit is all I know
Now im workin tripple shifts
Like this shit is all I know
Workin tripple shifts
Like this shit is all I know
I can take no days off
I'm terrified of going broke, look
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
I got off my ass, got on grind and they both came
Now I just want to nev, to never tell my son though
Cuz' I would do anything for lil' Khalil, lord know
The realest back, all that fraud shit done fore
See I was off the porch
Before them niggas hit the front door
Got it on my homie, what the fuck I need to front for
Especially when I got doper' lawyers with guns blown
Chill ain't dead cuz bitch niggas still livin
The world forever and fuck whoever offended
I just pour to have a pint and saw I have a half empty simply
Now im back, for the first time slime
I know they miss me
All these niggas around me was with me in the trenches
All these niggas around me now put money over bitches
All these niggas around me in the field and with the business
All them niggas around you broke and in they feelings
See I respect realness, dont respect millions
Cuz money never made a nigga real, I hope you hear me
2K for cartie frames on face you see it clearly
PSA if you with all of that fugasi, dont come near me
Who me I came in on my own two feet
I worked too hard to let DAs make me lose sleep
Im missed understood cuz most these niggas minds too sweet
Or too soft to comprehend the shit we saw in these streets
Sheesh
Smell that success coming off me, it reek
Quiet grind and try and sign and I get caught in a sweep
Nothing promised, god just might call me home this week
So im living like tomorrow what I might not see
All my goals I gatta reach, so I might not sleep
For some not days for some not weeks, stay up geeked
All this industry shit be water down and weak
Pardon me but i dont think these niggas cut like me
And bitch im fresh up off the block, the scent is still in my clothes
Im stayin down while these suckas taking deals for their souls
Im a hot boy, ain't no time to chill with these hoes
A millionaire but bitch, I still be in the field with my woes
A boss lives just like a boss cuz thats the life that he know
I feel entitled to the thrown, my nigga rightfully so
Just like I feel like a lazy nigga got the right to be broke
And like I feel a snitch nigga got the right to be smoked
One

[Outro]
Look
Its like
A nigga swtich
I never changed till this changed bruh
Put the city on my back as soon as I came up
