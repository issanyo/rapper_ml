[Hook]
It used to just be me and my niggas
So now when I eat, I only eat with my niggas
If it was up to me, I'd be deletin you niggas
I'm in my lane chilling, ain't they gon' compete with niggas
So now it's just me and my niggas
It's just me and my niggas
It's only me and mine, it's just me and my niggas
Yeah, it's just me and my niggas, it's only me and mine

[Verse 1]
I used to ride down Manchester in that Honda Accord
Counting up my lil' hustle change and plot on some more
Back when I ain't know too much about this game and its flaws
All I could think about was the interest for me and my doggs
Five disc changer with number of T.I. albums in rotation
I'm Serious up to King with constant thoughts how I'm a make it
Pull up at my nigga Jizzle's spot, then roll up a thick one
Google foreign whips and shit, then talk 'bout how we gon' get one
But now, man, things done changed
My whole city on my back, you got tomorrow on my brain
I'm still on that syrup with my right hand on granite
I'm just riding like I'm supposed to
Smashing down my lane and my name big
Niggas I looked up to now salute
I swear I feel like this whole world'll watch my every single move
People that was barely in my past say I'm back to brand new
But my view different now, I ain't that nigga that you knew, dude

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm who they talking about know like I'm new to this shit
The truth is since '07 I've been doing this shit
I state the line and bang mine, there's no confusing the script
And you ain't seen what I seen, the point of view was a bitch
I must be out of touch because I talk money
And what they talking is not enough
You ain't got enough to sit and cry to us
Know some niggas padded up that's down to let it go for me
And put yo' head in a skull for me
I got some money, bring some more to me
Or else I'm taking yo' kids from me
All you'll get's a fucking ransom note from me
Yo' bitch been hanging around, bet I could make her hold for me
Tell her keep her pussy, bring her throat to me
She can say anything but no to me
On this road to the riches
No brakes, my nigga, it's all in gold to me
I'm still that boy, homie, swallow the facts
Until it's over, I'll be eating beats and swallowing acts

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Got a lot on my mind, I stayed on this grind
Just flow on me like wine, just get better with time
These niggas be playing but they ain't playing with mine

[Hook]
