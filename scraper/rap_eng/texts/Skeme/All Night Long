[Verse 1: Mann]

Let me kick my shit
No fuck niggas in my click
My girl ain't innocent
She bad but she militant
Top of the pyramid
Food chain you got to feel this
Inspired by 2Pac's spirit
We popping Peace life we fearless
I might pop up in paris
I might just fly to london
My life, got no limits
Master peace, I'm important
Sparking while Im recording
Chick by my side is gorgeous
Said she like my performance
Had her hooked by the chorus
Monster a dinosaur
Say cali on the flight I board
PeaceLife Fuck all kinds of war
Get money thats what I enjoy
Boss nigga look I employ
A thousand hoes want to be hired
Fuck with me I got that Fire
Up all night like a vampire, yump

[Hook: Mann]

You see what Im drinking
We chief like jamaicans
You know what I'm thinking?
Go hard in the pavement
We going All night long

And my bitch is flawless
We young living lawless
We giving out orders
She bringing back bottles she do it

[Verse 2: Skeme]

Gold all on my neck
Real niggas in my set
Niggas who used to hate show love now but now all y'all niggas is off deck
See its ING LE no cuts bitch and fuck who you fuck with
I ain't never did no fuck shit and thats the reason that I get love bitch
More money more problems but I ain't had a problem I couldn't solve yet

Excuse me if I think these niggas is lame
Hoggin the highway bitch get out my lane
How I spit an 18 put niggas to shame
