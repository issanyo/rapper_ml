[Hook:]
Since I started getting money I’ve been thugging all day
All my haters know it’s middle finger, fuck what yall say
Ain’t even countin, there’s no more, I know they comin always
On the gang I let it bang, we gon' get it our way



[Verse 1: Skeme]
I came straight from the bottom and now this whole world know I’m here
I ain’t no role model, go full throttle, I bang just like my peers
Swear I’m slappin the next nigga tryin to tell me this his year
Got me a Benz for the shis got in out of there
But I got em, I’m platinum on the lip
And my weakness is green, no Superman
I go stupid HAM, young duke the man
Count me a mill with my shootin hand
Eatin steak and lobster, no soup or cans
Do it my way like Sinatra
Sittin in the Phantom, listening to opera
Diamonds on diamonds, all gold on my blocka
Checkin these shots, getting all that like choppas, pow

[Hook:]


[Verse 2:]
At the end of the day I’ll be the same ol' nigga
That’ll pull a pistol out and let it bang on niggas
Yea I hop off in that Benz and switch my lanes on niggas
Hit a lick and go and do it on a chain with my niggas
Mane I’m stuck down on this hustle, getting my paper and such
See I’m still young and I’m still strapped and ain’t giving a fuck
See mane I still pull me a foreign, let it sit in my cup
And if you don’t be on that same shit you can’t kick it with us

[Bridge:]
And I’m still getting to it, my day one
Might change up but I ain’t done
All the hatin with these G niggas
Ain’t got no time of you ain’t one
Got murder money on me, yall niggas ain’t a threat
Only nigga might go platinum, I still kick it in the set


[Hook:]
