[Hook: Skeme]
You ain't from this side, I can see it in your face
It's dope sales and murder, everyday 'round my way
Same niggas say they fam'
Get to plotting
Full of jealousy and hate
That's why the motto's stay dangerous
Not safe (stay dangerous)
Especially with these hustlers and gangsters
You better (stay dangerous)
Cause the devil get busy in the City of Angels
Lil nigga

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Things just ain't the same for gangsters
What a shame I'm too famous now
To pop y'all wangsters
Clown ass rap niggas, claimin' they bangers
But when the reptables around
They quit twistin' they fingers (huh) (you a pussy)
First sign he a fraud
Probably never get accepted by the Loccs or B-Dawg
And if he do, he probably gotta pay 'em off
Same nigga gotta sit when he piss
Just like a broad (you a bitch)
Sermons off always playin like he hard
Type pac warned you 'bout
Ain't shit without a squad (you a hoe)
You know them boys always claimin' they G's
But do the background search
And find out they some geeks
That's why it's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill niggas
And I put this on God, I don't know how fake feel nigga
'Cause ever since day zero, I been a real nigga bitch

[Hook: Skeme]
You ain't from this side, I can see it in your face
It's dope sales and murder, everyday 'round my way
Same niggas say they fam'
Get to plotting
Full of jealousy and hate
That's why the motto's stay dangerous
Not safe (stay dangerous)
Especially with these hustlers and gangsters
You better (stay dangerous)
Cause the devil get busy in the City of Angels
Lil nigga

[Verse 2: Skeme]
It's like everywhere I'm looking
Everywhere I go
I hear these lil niggas tryna steal my flow
But look, it ain't no thing
The homies from the gang
Down to pull up, hop out, and knock on every damn thing
Ask around town, if its fixing a fact
My nigga Deucey got the strap, and get to tripping with that
And I keep an FN on me, you get your issue with that
It's close casket if a nigga get to hit you with that
I'm seeing (?), all the outisders slip and get jacked
Creep up on you with that mac like nigga relax
Quit with all the chitter-chatter cuz that's how niggas get wacked
That's how niggas get clapped
That's how niggas get blapped
Wipe my Cartier's off for the Saint-laurent dark lens
Slidin' in that Benz with the presidential dark tints
Living like the kid, who Nas talked to on the park bench
Shit's fucked up, that's how it is

[Hook: Skeme]
You ain't from this side, I can see it in your face
It's dope sales and murder, everyday 'round my way
Same niggas say they fam'
Get to plotting
Full of jealousy and hate
That's why the motto's stay dangerous
Not safe (stay dangerous)
Especially with these hustlers and gangsters
You better (stay dangerous)
Cause the devil get busy in the City of Angels
Lil nigga
