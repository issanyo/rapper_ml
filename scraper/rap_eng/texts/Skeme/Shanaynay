[Intro: Drakeo the Ruler]
Sheesh
I guess this make number two, huh
Damn
Duse makin' slaps, true

[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Ugh, shit I guess that's me, huh
Got Metro Boomin in the back tryna rip all my seats out
Ugh, now tell me what that beef 'bout
Find your brains in the street, your body by that seaside
Zoom zoom zoom, I had to bleed down the block
Chinky chinky, you smell the stink on my knots
Feds knockin' at my door, they must've found another box
Shananay keep singin', they must've found another Glock
Yeah I just passed another foreign, these lil niggas wanna be me
Type that address in faster if you really wanna see me
I just passed another foreign, these lil niggas wanna be me
Type that address in faster if you really wanna see me

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch sing
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch ring, shit
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch sing
You can meet Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch ring

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Me I'm just Duke, my lil brother Drakeo, that's the rumor
My name on the hall of fame wall with my jeweler
I'm in that Mercedes, don't need hands to maneuver
Lil bitch now I can really be the driver and the shooter
And I'm pissin' on these niggas with this lean on my liver
Postmates pistol, you want your issue, I deliver
Got another nigga missin', suckin' dick and never kissed her
I was all off in her middle when he texted that he missed her
Damn, ain't that shit brazy?
I call that bitch a bitch, you call her baby
That nigga probably mad at the kid but I don't blame him
'Cause if I wasn't me, shit I'd probably hate me, nigga

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch sing
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch ring, shit
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch sing
You can meet Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch ring

[Verse 3: Drakeo the Ruler]
Ralfy you blindin' me, can you turn your teeth down?
Got America's most wanted all on one beat now
You just a clown, it's the Ruler so bow down
In the fifty doin' donuts, lettin' off MAC rounds
Ugh, pussy nigga watch your step
Send my niggas to the county to knock down your mac rep
It's that easy, for a pint of Act you sleepin'
Breezy sleezy, my nickname should be Stevie
I just passed another foreign, these lil niggas wanna be me
Type that address in faster if you really wanna see me
I just passed another foreign, these lil niggas wanna be me
Type that address in faster if you really wanna see me

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch sing
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch ring, shit
Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch sing
You can meet Shanaynay
I had to let that bitch ring
