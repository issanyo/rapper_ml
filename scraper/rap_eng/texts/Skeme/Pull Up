(Intro)
4 Bars at a time my nigga
Load the clip up on these niggas
Turn this shit up one time

(Verse 1)
Look, the (?) know what it is put the best on
Run shit, nigga bet, put a check on
Lil bitch ya need that? put ya neck on
Futuristic nigga sound like i'm next
Stuntin' is a habit
Bitch i'm cryin' like the saddest
Never ever lonely cuz i'm ridin' with the ratchet
I ain't talkin' bout a bitch, but a ratchet with a clip
Catch ya ol' nigga slippin' let that mofucka rip
It go, Fuck them other niggas, cuz I ride for my niggas
Bitch i'm a star i'ma hide from a nigga
Killin' beats better call the mortician
If the rap don't work fuck it slide in the kitchen

(Hook)
Fuck them other niggas cuz I ride for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cuz I ride for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas I ride for my niggas

Pull up, hop out, Fuck, its nothing (x8)

(Verse 2)
Pull up in a coupe, bitches holla "What it do?"
It go fuck them other niggas cuz i'm stuntin' with the crew
Glass of ace, cup of goose, fuckin' bitches by the group
Niggas hatin' on the kid and i'm sceamin' FUCK YOU!
Bust two, shots in the air, money er'ywhere, bitch i'm rare
Said she wanna leave fuck her I don't care
What I wear, new balenciagas 650 a pair
Chain on, lights flash on me, all the bitches stare

All I do is sip and shine, ain't no waistin' time
I'm a upper echelon nigga, I don't wait in line
E'ry bitch I fuck a dime, she keep it if she a nine huh

(Hook)

Run shit, nigga bet, put a check on
