[Intro: Skeme]
Uh, bitch, it's that Westside Ingles shit
It's for the '99 and the 2000s, nigga
I ain't playin' with none of you niggas
The new Cash Money
The gang that don't bang, biatch
Right

[Hook: Skeme]
I got mad flows, mad flows
The shit that got me mad hoes, I get mad more
Nigga, nigga I got mad flows, mad flows
The shit that got me mad dough, I get mad more, motherfucker

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Black Benzes, windows tinted, no, my shit ain't rented (Hol up)
Inglewood or duck, fuck a nigga and his feelings
Hot boy, nigga, make a million while I'm chillin'
I could bet a pretty penny you ain't livin' what you spittin'
Gold grillin, bugs bunny, feed her, carrots when Iâ€™m grinnin'
Montana shit, Medusa head stitched in my linen
Street nigga, no account, your account in my denim
Unless you blind, bitch, it ain't hard to see a nigga winnin'
If I'm talkin' to that ho, then tell that bitch to pay attention (Bitch!)
Big business, I use dollar signs to punctuate a sentence
Fuck the law, do it raw, skip the trial and drop the witness
Bein' broke been a joke, ain't shit funny 'bout my digits?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Strap on, get clapped on, nigga, that just be the facts
They say "Me, I don't rap though", got black, don't trap the trap
Got my chopper on, my stack of Os then came back with the sack
Man, my Roley, that's goldie, my wrist nicknamed "The Mack"
See, your niggas ho-niggas and that shit that be weak
Man, my niggas be killers, give a fuck about rap and beef
See, my bitches got bitches, my pimpin' game is sweet
I just fuck 'em, then duck 'em and get right back in them streets
Bitch, I've been a threat, ghetto intellect, AK and a TEC
Nigga flex, labels sendin' checks, still I'm in a set
Nigga rich, use this Internet, we ain't feel it
Play with me, I'm a play for keeps, all my niggas strapped

[Hook]

[Bridge: Skeme]
This my world little nigga, you just livin' in it
Cause I got frames on my face, made my vision different
By any means necessary, know your nigga get it
He said he got it like we got it, no, you fuckin' didn't
Say, this my world little nigga, you just livin' in it
You get some money, nigga, can I make your vision different?
By any means necessary, know your nigga get it
He said he got it like we got it, no you fuckin' didn't
