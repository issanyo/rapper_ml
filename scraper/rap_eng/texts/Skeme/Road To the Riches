[Verse 1]
Look I never knew a life without a struggle
I never thought the shit i write would bubble
Money come in all of sudden
And I got new cousins now
But i won't circulate it down
With those who wasn't around
My past make it hard to sleep at night
And Cire said this world gonna feel me
If it speak it right
I put my pain on each and every beat
Lock up the block i want my name on each and every street
The niggas around round with me
Boy that was never sweet
And most of these rappers lame
That is probably why we never speak
I used to sell white and crack to make my jordon money
But what fiends did to get that dough was n't important to me
Got to a point where i was use to shitten upto
But knew right from wrong and still was playing dumb too
I saw a way about the hood and started running to it
Was barely getting bread but now a nigga thumbing to it

[Hook ]
I take the losses with the winds
Just trying to make my ends on this road to riches
More dough and less friends
Looking life through it new designer lens
I can't see my hustle ever breaken been
I am on this road to riches
[Son ,I was younger , told was get money straight up]
I am on this road to riches
[Either you gonna standup for some or you gonna fall for everything]
[Choice is your though,you hear me]

[Verse 2]
What's the use to have a bank , but all your niggas broke
What's the use to going hard , if all your niggas won't
I always kept it real even when niggas don't
And that's the reason i am whom all a real nigga coup
Talk about it but really got it how you feel a body
Steady my moves , because lack of focus lead to lack of options
Started this rap to declare my thoughts and then the second profit
Double your grind, double your shine
That's just basic logic
The bullshit on a larger scale be microscopic
If it ain't paper or progression, its off the topic
Its the Malcom and Martin flow
You know that they throw it in gear but never park a flow
If you ain't have no any plan what you started for
The odds stacked up against you gonna make it hard to go
Money, Power and respect that's all we ever want
Been on this road bitch i m staying on it
[Hook ]
[Inglewood though man make this shit happen for the hometown one time]
[Drinking on that drank , right now we still focused]
