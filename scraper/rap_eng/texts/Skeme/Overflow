Walking in this bitch with a knock homie

Spot a bitch that i want it then got her homie

[Verse 2 Billy]

I am a bad bitch like woof woof

Making music on a moving place
Probably had your little sister busting days
Speaks the upper bit, imposed on the pay
Bitch you know I ain't poping, I am respecting the hate
I am so hungry,Bitch I m scraping the plate
Get to what I do and got what it takes
Can't understand me the real criblet
Walking in this hoe-ing and bitch was going
If i stand my fingers ,think a nigga coming
I ain't never had to ask my name
Because the young bitch get lots of money
One thing is hoe-ing that bitch was doing

They can't see with me, these bitches bumming
They can't fuck with me, how many bitches bugging

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Thrash ]
Havana to cashna
Pretty bitch with them back shots
Counting money in my living room
With city viewing in the backdraw
Shooters with me like BlackOps
Young Nigga go get that bankroll
Gotta gotta like i can't ball
I got foreign faces on these bank notes yeah
As just so appear my money is on Lamborghinis
And clearance on the ground like
Seat barriers in barracks on a vanceboro[?]
But supreme on the balance
The supreme What I m wearing
My kicks is the ravest
My spot need pool  with a ocean uterus
My art on the walls that i loft up in paris
Ferraris to whip on me, update like paris
I am the one they know it
It's been a long one and they know it
Whipped a lot in foreign, exotic foreign fabbys on my body
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
