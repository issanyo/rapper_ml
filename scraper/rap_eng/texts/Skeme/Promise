[Intro]
Ay, haters be real
Sometimes you don't need nothing else
Know what I mean?
Ingleworld 2, bitch

[Verse 1]
I hear they talking but I'm wondering what they saying though
Money's still a major issue, fuck you playing for?
I'm in the game but clear to see that I ain't playing, ho
I'm right here with it 'til I get everything I came for
All I want is respect, power and dollars
Screaming "Fuck you" to police, same quote for Your Honor
Ain't no question marks or commas
I come up around piranhas, bears, tigers and lions
Back when I circled the clients
You know how we do, nigga, shoot .223s through niggas
Dressed like a GQ nigga but keep it G too, nigga
I'm in designer shit, won't catch me in no cheap suit, nigga
Let's see you wake up from this (?)
Because you's a see-through, nigga
Now, if you you're scared, little buddy, go to church
They same for all my gangster niggas that be having work
Fuck with me right, you get paper
Fuck with me wrong, you get murked
Put me anywhere on Godâ€™s green Earth
And bet I triple my worth, my nigga

[Hook]
I woke up this morning with the world on my mind
I don't ask much of it, 'cept not to play around with mine
I work too hard not to give it to me honest
And I ain't stopping nothing 'til I got it
That's my motherfucking promise
That's my motherfucking promise
I said I work too hard, not losing ain't an option
I'm a ball on, baby, people watching
That's my motherfucking promise

[Verse 2]
Right, I just turned 25 years old
And now my bank account got six zeros
Woo, nigga, comma, comma, exclamation
That's that dollar sign communication
Long shot but I'll make it, slanging raps to my pages
Backside, she Vegas, she look good but look greater naked
Hold up, bitches all up in my business
D-d-damn, and they feel this
Top back off the VCH, how I'm living, there ain't no limit
I be S-K-E-M-E, hot boy not in that CMB
Pull up, '63 AMG, still screaming "SGODB"
See, this right here, we trill as hell
And all these niggas with me trill as well
And I got niggas hating, bitches waiting
On me to come put in their mouth like Akinyele
And I can tell that niggas ain't hot, for real
Never popped for real, well, they might just fail
Now, without a deal my dollars stack, my pockets fat
And they got them is (?), woo, bitch, I'm hearing shit
Check (?) work off membership
I'm on the trillest shit, I'm stingy, bitch
But you fucked with me, and I'm a lend a clip

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't talk much cause niggas always yip and yap
Acting how they bitches act
See, I don't understand it like some chicken scratch
But I'm bool on these niggas, I be bicking back
And I'm in Saint Laurent,  on the (?), .45, clip attached
Where your niggas at?
And I love the bitty, man, I love the bitty
Since she gave me game, bitch, I just give it back

[Outro]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
