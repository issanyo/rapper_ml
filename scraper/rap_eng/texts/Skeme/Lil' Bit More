[Chorus - FatBoxxx]
Eyes rollin', you can control it
I know you're goin', we keep on pourin' up
She said she want a lil' bit more
She said she want a lil' bit more
She said she want a lil' bit more
She said she want a lil' bit more

[Verse 1 - KayEss]
It's Killa, it's Killa, it's Killa and I'm winnin'
Light up trees like Christmas, shrimp [?] for dinner
I was fuckin' Molly last week, now I'm fuckin' Lindsay
You said you want a lil' more so that's what imma give ya
[?] to the bargain these four bottles of Remi
And imma drink it all until it's empty, really
Run the city no Diddy, me and Smalls no Biggie
And all the hood niggas with me and we go fast like a hemi
So lemme see you take it to the flo'
Basically if you really want a lil' mo'
Yea, it's like Lil' Jo I'm tryna hit the back do'
So stand here and make it clap hoe

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Skeme]
I'll tell her get it right or get left hoe
She ain't heard about me, she a deaf hoe
Got that pure uncut now [?]
And everything out my mouth sick I'm on strep throat
Want some mo', baby tell me no mas
Tell her I ain't fuckin' she ain't got no ass
Her main nigga pissed he ain't got no pot
If she really with the shit baby I'm gon plot
It's Me, SB, KayEss, Fatboxx and
This money 'bout bread I'm stuntin'
Flight on deck get the next one comin'
10 [?] 'round here everything 100 huh!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - sbA1]
California kush and I love it like good pussy
And put money over bitches 'cause bitches ain't shit to me
Got her over here shaking
She ain't doing nothin', told her strip, get naked
We don't fuck with them 'cause them niggas fugazy
Fuckin' with my team leave him splattered on the pavement
I'll be doin' this till my muthafuckin' days end
And we be goin' in from the P to the A.M
Westside native, rollin' up faded
She ain't doing nothin' if that ass ain't shakin'
Put the cup down bitch if you ain't drankin'
Give her this dick, now she passed out plankin'

[Chorus]
