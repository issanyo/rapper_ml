[Intro]
Same old me
Die the way I was born, man
Solo in da muthefucka

[Hook]
Yah tho a walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear nothing except fear itself
No time for these niggas tryna talk with me
On the road to the riches nigga walk with me
Hear that walk with me, walk with me
Hear that walk with me, nigga walk with me, uhh

[Verse 1]
Niggas love talking G shit
But seldom niggas speaking be ain't about that
You see all a these niggas that i be with
Ain't go let you run up on a nigga i doubt that
I fall down and bounce back like two three
And four five
But number eight and two four look who then find a loophole
I got mine on mah two soles with true soul i live without the two souls
Be habbin outta hear mah new shit and said that boy duke cold
Haters mad i won't acknowledge their exist
Since i won't argue but it's hard to tell  who is who from a distance
So  just keep yo opinion you can have it mah nigga
Cause what's nothin for nothin simple subtraction mah nigga
Never knew nervous till mah girl had fake contractions
A lot a talk in these streets but i rather speak through my actions
And i'm still in the hood where opportunity be absent
Brutality fuck a judgment unless they judging my pasion
Young crooked what's up

[Hook]
Yah tho a walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear nothing except fear itself
No time for these niggas tryna talk with me
On the road to the riches nigga walk with me
Hear that walk with me, walk with me
Hear that walk with me, nigga walk with me, uhh

[Verse 2]
Mah vision define all past visions of mine
Always come for reason just give me some time
Hope these niggas that rhyme don't think i'm playing with mine
Tap dancing on money bags new gregory hines
What i think of success it sucks but still i give no fuck
The verses picture  perfect and show out if i need to show up
All you niggas know what S.O.X. gangs forever more
Classic Hublo you know them euro pedals hitting floor
Look what that fame will get you, them use to be yo homies
The dellas taught you quick tho you got all this on you lonely
But this the game you chose don't be scared now
The camera rolling you should be more than prepared, cuz' see
Money make this world go round like gangsters
And i'd rather die rich than famous
But for now am just a nigga livin dangerous
Mixing and mingling with entertainers

[Hook]
Yah tho a walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear nothing except fear itself
No time for these niggas tryna talk with me
On the road to the riches nigga walk with me
Hear that walk with me, walk with me
Hear that walk with me, nigga walk with me, uhh
