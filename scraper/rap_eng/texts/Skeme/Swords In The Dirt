[Sample] Roots Manuva – My gosh

[Verse 1: Roots]
Lungs ah filly
Manuva get milly
Black dat coming like a black sport billy
???, see me with my DV can
Feel my low tech moving your mothers that push prams
And smuggle grams and get grands that feed their babies
Skid valley death traps get more crazy
I’m coolin in my yard now I drinks my Bailey’s
We love rap, tikka view, feeding the poor
Keep them grubalicious gavvers from knocking ya door
It’s x amount of do’s to diss, we stay dat
Swords in the dirt, sonny, show your respect

[Sample] My escapades left your fuckin shit splayed

[Verse 2 : Danny Vicious]
In or lay lay
Outta town but not Hyde
And hundred keys in the dirt and still rising
Big five pop off style and go town in some shiny black loafers
For raving down
Yeah yo
Weekend reach, we spend cash in them wine bars, bashment raves and sound clashes
None of y’all fools dun know where to find me since I buss up the spot and dust the mid nineties
Sword in the mud, still I go on foul
Still sword in the dirt, still poppin’ off work
Dat
Monster guy, king killer eye
Eight hands and eight pies, da octapie
Yo

[Sample] Rodney P ah wah they put me in the mix

[Verse 3: Rodney P]
Yo, you've yet to see the best of 'P'
You believe I smoke too much weed?
It’s guaranteed
I'm a twist trees 'til my eye dem bleed
An' I believe sex is good on Es but that me
The truth will set you free, we nah lie
True I use my third eye, calm and free eye
Jah know
And imma live big
And send requests to my girl cos my girl is my rib
Ya know the flex, ya know the plan
Got my sword in the dirt and my spliff in my hand
And it’s big tings a gwarn to my MC gang
Riddim killa for the girls and the ganja man

[Hook: Niara]
Swords in the dirt
The whole truth hurts
Our posse and crew stand strong and do the worse
Swords in the dirt
The cold truth burns
Whole posse and crew stand strong and do the worse

[Sample] Dr. Evil BLAH inya bludclart

[Blackitude]
Adda real up in a face of a seven worse ting
We live long and never prosperin'
Always regrettin' it
We can’t na fadar folloh
Fashion, you flash bare foolery, coonery
Even your white boy decoys is niggas now
Keep it bloodklart, I’m at home chillin'
Sword inna mud  ?
?
Smack you inna head copper beg your pardon
Hardened fumes tell you gammas nuttin'
We magnetic son ultra
B-boy
North and south polar
Whole lotta minutes soldier
I told you come boulder
Or get flat
My acid tune is rude and jet black

[Sample] P

[Big P]
This is P man
Superheavyweight spangle with the tea man
Top shotta south east man
Streets man
You know I push that work
Hurt anything that’s tryna invade my turf
Imma braveheart
Stickin' my sword in the dirt
I take part
Tings in the boot of the Merc'
Open dat
Push da strap under my shirt
Cos if I have to, I blast you of the face of the earth
And right about now
This is rap revolution
They can try to fight down
But P’s the solution
The world is mine
Frontline kingpin
Keepin' it live for south east 1 5

[Sample] Right now the Skeme

[Skeme]
I got my sword in the dirt on SE8 frontlines
Arms I shot are cyphers
Fire blaze rounds
When I bless wax, ag
Battle rap crimes
All chichi mon fiyah bun one time
I’m a sword swingin' general from your dirty south
Like puffin cable tongue you get super mow
Skeme’s about
Two thousand horror of rap
With the sword in the dirt while I’m stabbing the track
Fassy’s don’t like what us warriors built
But I’m holding down my space with a lancer shield
Black knights of this rap ting, ya skin get peeled
And if I don’t have my sword then the nine’s the deal
And that’s the real

[Outro: Niara]
Don’t you got me on a long ting no
They tried to diss but they can’t stop this flow
X2

Swords in the dirt
The whole truth hurts
Posse and crew stand strong and do the worse
The cold truth burns
Our posse and crew stand strong and do the worse
