The Problem is none of these rappers be real no more
It's hard to feed these niggas when you know
That they ain't in the feel no more
Fuck you, if you is a fake nigga or snake nigga or foe
And you better watch your tongue you talking to the boss
It's Our-side out to the any side
It's I-side out to anyside
Bullshit we are not letting slide
All my youngs go forever slide
All my youngs go forever ride

[ I say ]
Bitch, I made a million of my plug deal

The Pimp back,I am sipping drank stand trill
I am full on them drugs,about high as my bitch heels

A fly nigga with them hoes safe
Niggas acting how the hoes act
That's the main reason,that we no play
Rap nigga from the dope game
Use to piss pieces of the whole thang

I am back back from the flow change
I am back back to my own ways
For the 1999-2000, Hot boy like a old Wayne

Everyone around me got extras
You ain't coming through the struggle oppression
I know that you ain't on my level
