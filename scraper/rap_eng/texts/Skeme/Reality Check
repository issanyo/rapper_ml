[Hook : Skeme]

I had to come up with something new
I had to come up with something
I had to pull my bed, to what I found
Out Niggas, The sun
I got a separate blue & green High A's
Counting this money
I gotta shit on niggas acting
Way too too geek , cause you ain't but nothing
This shit right here is the real thing
Real real real really really real thing
Not so much luck ,but skill a thing
Diamonds dancing on me like a drill team
This shit right here is the real thing
Real real real really really real thing
Triple cupped up trill thing
Fuck chilling we chasing the middle thing

[Verse  : Skeme]
I was on 10 as teen sipping 16
Bitch I don't get sick I sip lean
It is either a lover nigga or you a hater
Because baby ain't no one between
Euro machine pull a murder the scene
How about that bitch clean as whistle
Carbine 15 those you misses
But you go swear up and down
That's what it was when it hits you
Classes,Sessions boy your seat where i sit
You know dissing all the rappers get his dismissals
No days off, I Don't need a substitute you will recognize
Well I am real ,now we ask who the fuck is you ?
You look so unfamiliar not familiar
All I know is gangsta , strip , flocks , dealers
I am different, my sand boxes full of killers
Banana Clipse make a chimp out of gorilla
Trill, ain't the lie script La familia
At this point ,ain't no one body I can feel
Say If ain't no cash in it ,fuck the conversation
I prey on these verses
Touch me i am just waiting
Diamonds twerking on my wrist
I am the shit ain't  no second chances
Once I run through this clip
Young niggas straight from the slums like go Play with you
Nothing like you catch every beat from the drum
