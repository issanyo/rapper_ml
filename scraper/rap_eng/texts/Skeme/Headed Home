[Verse 1]
I heard home is where yo' heart is
Coward where yo' heart at?
Million dollar calls baby doll can't get no call back
In this bitch in all black
Homies roll in strong packs
Inglewood on every song
Boy that's where I got grown at
And I owe that cause that's mine
Bitch I'm on my grind
When I had that time I ain't have no money
Now that I got money man I ain't got time
Speak my mind, make it hard to confuse me with these others
Not a friend in the world
All these niggas with me my brothers yeah
Talk is cheap, broke niggas speak
To the game pay day is 7 days a week
This game bitter but dammit the money sweet
Holla at me when it's G I'm on the top floor sleep

[Hook]
If I don't know nothin' man I know I put on
Been around the map and now I'm headed home
I'm just playin' my position
Cause it's right where I belong
I came to take it all
Now I'm headed home yeah
And nigga if I wasn't rappin' baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Chrome and shinin'sippin' daily
No rest until they pay me
I'm just playin' my position
Cause it's right where I belong
No rest until they pay me
I came to take it all
Now I'm headed home

[Verse 2]
They want me gone, they want me gone
But I keep on I ain't worried bout the bullshit
I'm in my zone
I guess that's why I'm here
And I can't go back home
But guess when I heard that?
When I was back home
I built this on my own nigga
So ain't no hand outs you got to get ya own nigga
101 all these wannabes is clones nigga
Gangsta in the flesh, modern day Capone nigga
You see I grew up a screw up
2 cups got me screwed up

[Hook]


[Outro]
Now I'm home
And it ain't take long
I ain't worried bout shit
Got a O of that strong
While I'm writin' these songs
Nigga look what I did
Do it like Pac or I do it like BIG
Notorious, L, or Pun
Tune in every time that the big homie say look here
Lil' nigga let me tell you somethin'
Know where I'm goin'
Know where I'm headed
Watchin' me win
That's makin' em jealous
This is to you and ain't shit you could tell us
Ain't got to fuck wit' us
Still got to feel it
Livin' the life that these rappers embellish
Boy I'm the shit
I know you can smell
This is groundbreakin' I know that you felt it
And I can get rich off this game that I'm sellin' yeah
