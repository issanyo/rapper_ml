Pistol grip long, for my leather all times
I fuck bitches with that magnum, fuck this game with one run
I’m what these ladies love, plus I stay up in the street
Know I’m riding with some thugs, you talk shit, the talk is cheap
Got these bitches bringing pesos, they love to see me shock
Wash my hands on the curve, now I’m covering up my doubts
A young bg, a hot boy, I changed the grind and my ...team
And now these labels wanan sign me
I be like maine, watch the shit change
Been tryina get some money since whole city was a thing
I came from the harlem tryina hop a better way
So all you whacked ass rappers stay the fuck about my lane
I’m holling out maine
Oh look, I think I’m putting much green in my cup
Ok, I’m coming down and pouring up
Sticking bick up in the...rest in peace to...
We don’t give a fuck
You think ... change you, but I know it’s enough said
...you don’t have a man
You think ... change you, but I know it’s enough said
...you don’t have a man
Pull up, hop out, chain on poppy shit
Kush blowing, tats showing, heavy on my Compton shit
Central laugh, contraband, playing like it’s show time
Cop the shit, box the shit, and have it out in no time
My hoes fine, yes they is, politicking presidents
Killing pussies, killing shit, never leaving, never diss
Thugging with some elegance
Get money...success is the cycle, so my whole squad pedaling heavy as the metal is, establishing relevance
I gotta admit we do our thang for some ghetto kids
It’s that ghetto feel, high as my bitch stiletto heel
Skeme I be on your level as soon as I pop my little pill
Now it’s on, we’re from here to song
Nigga on the charge but he still can get them zones
Catch me in the cut, don’t be hitting up my phone
The shit just might be bugged, volvo
You think ... change you, but I know it’s enough said
...you don’t have a man
You think ... change you, but I know it’s enough said
...you don’t have a man
Ok, keeping my cup in my hand and my bitch in my left
And I’m riding with working and a bag and I’m chasing the stacks
Nigga just spitting the facts, man all of you niggas is whack
Got finger for paper like sure that they coming
I hop bout my ... hop in the booth, you can’t copy the truth
If I get on that just you niggas is dumb
Players wanna play, ballers wanna ball
Sure I got my own, bitch I want it all
3 phones on me, I answer when money call
If I had a hunned magnums, I still wouldn't fuck with y'all
You think ... change you, but I know it’s enough said
...you don’t have a man
You think ... change you, but I know it’s enough said
...you don’t have a man
