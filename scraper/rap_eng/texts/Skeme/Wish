[Hook – Skeme]
I came from the motherfucking ghetto
I came from the motherfucking hood
I got my right foot mashed on the gas pedal
Man I really wish a pussy nigga would
Nigga I’ma leave all ice on me
And bet a nigga still won’t do it
Tell the club put the spotlight on me
And bet them pussies still won’t do it
Nigga I’ma leave all ice on me
And bet a nigga still won’t do it
Tell the club put the spotlight on me
And bet them pussies still won’t do it
Hold up nigga

[Verse 1 – Skeme]
I need 700 percent
I done fucked around and done it again
Talk racks when you talking to the boy, I’m holding about 100 of them
Pussy ass niggas, we ain’t fucking with them
I hit once, I can fuck her again
I can fuck her again
I bet a blind man see that y’all ain’t fucking with him
Drop five in a show then blow one in the wind
Don’t play about the paper, get a gun in your chin
Money tucked off and money to spend
Jump back, I’ll put a shot in every one of your limbs
Neck head, leg arm, arm leg
Either break bread or fake it, that’s the code[?]
Did it and spent it and come back for more
Gold mouth dog when it come to that dough

Nigga I’ma leave all ice on me
And bet a nigga still won’t do it
Tell the club put the spotlight on me
And bet them pussies still won’t do it

[Verse 2 – PeeWee Longway]
[?] bitch, I’m on the stage with the bitches
The club hit the light, I got the pocket monster on me
Brought out all of my jewelry, they VVS, it look like water
Trapping OG, my trap be big beam like the carter
I’m just a little ghetto boy, I be fucking on your daughter
Spotlight on me cause I get that work back down to Georgia
Longway scheming up on them blue M&Ms boy
[?] shoot at your fitted cap boy
Whoever want it, they can get it
Money pounds and ammunition
Longway lieutenant, I [?] bitches
Got good crack cooking in the kitchen
I came from the ghetto but we call it the trenches
Tripping on the red and the yellow, cause extinction
So when I re-up there’s no codefendant
I got my feets kicked up somewhere by Lennox
Longway bitch

[Verse 3 – Skeme]
Fuck with me right or get fucked up for life
That’s just the rules of engagement my nigga
Fuck all that hype we can run that tonight
I pass suits winning trays of [?] to my killers
Pull up in that [?] on the red [?]
Take her deep  into the crib, beat her head in
Man that pussy so good, it’s so white, it’s so tight
That I almost couldn’t fit the third leg in hold up
Water on me, I’ma need a raincoat
True story, ain’t nobody in my lane bro
See my bitch be the baddest bitch, rocking that designer shit
Your ho look like you let her shop at Rainbow
Crazy nigga case be a bastard
Leave a nigga beat in a casket
I don’t be playing with these niggas, we spraying at these niggas
See that right there will get your ass kicked
