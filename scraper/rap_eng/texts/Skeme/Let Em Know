[Intro: Skeme]
DJ Nemo, why this beat so lit

[Hook: AD]
I just gotta let em know (woah)
Been a real nigga, get it for the low
I just gotta let em know (woah)
If you ain't with it, fuck you gotta go
I just gotta let em know (woah woah woah woah)
I just gotta let em know (woah woah woah woah)
I just gotta let em know

[Verse 1: AD]
I just gotta let em know
Been a real nigga, I can get it for the low
Y'all been trippin over pussy, I ain't worried bout a hoe
Give her a couple dimes, bet she work it like a pro
I'm the man when you come to LA
Bitch I'm big time, I got shooters in the bay
I don't do shit
