Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

[Pre-Chorus]
These young niggas around my hood
Boy they some savages
Won't take no shit, just take the chips and chances
You catch anything on my neck, it gon' be dancin'
I let these hoes know off top, I'm not romantic

[Chorus]
10 times out of 10, bitch I'm gon' win (nigga what)
I got money I can burn, no pretend (nigga what)
10 times out of 10, lil' bitch Im'ma win
It didn't take no time to turn that Honda to a Benz (Yo Pi'erre...)

[Verse 1]
I dont want no new friends
I ain't ever need no favors
As long as I got this paper
And a Glock with a red dot lazer
Bitch, hand and my neck full of glaciers
And my benz is as black as a Haitian
Inside so spaceship
Gotta keep the distance from these haters
10 times out of 10, Im'ma be the one to set the trend
Im'ma be the one nigga stand up
Im too different I dont blend
10 times out of 10, Im'ma flex up when the checks in
These rappers gettin' extorted but ain't good til' they check in

[Pre-Chorus]
These young niggas around my hood
Boy they some savages
Won't take no shit, just take the chips and chances
You catch anything on my neck, it gon' be dancin'
I let these hoes know off top, I'm not romantic

[Chorus]
10 times out of 10, bitch I'm gon' win (nigga what)
I got money I can burn, no pretend (nigga what)
10 times out of 10, lil' bitch Im'ma win
It didn't take no time to turn that Honda to a Benz

[Verse 2]
Money come fast like lightning
Boy you not like me
These bitches with me, they dikey
These Saint Laurents, not Nikes
Holdn that purple, shipping that Minnesotan viking
Oh I think she like me, 500 for my white tee
Tell her she could be my bitch, not my wifey
She found out I sip that drank and got dramatic
My lil' nigga gon' let these shots off and run it
Bitch I might just kidnap Ben Frank, no ransom

[Pre-Chorus]
These young niggas around my hood
Boy they some savages
Won't take no shit, just take the chips and chances
You catch anything on my neck, it gon' be dancin'
I let these hoes know off top, I'm not romantic

[Chorus]
10 times out of 10 bitch im gon win
Nigga what
I got money I can burn, no pretend
Nigga what
10 times out of 10 lil' bitch I'm gon' win
It didn't take no time to turn a Honda to a Benz

[Verse 3]
Ain't take no time bitch, I turned up now I'm the man
Lil' bitch my block so hot, you fuck around and get 10
She said she won't bring her friend
Told that hoe the more the merrier
Six wedding bands on my hand, but fuck gettin' married
My nigga
I'm from where the youngin' get murked
My, my nigga
You might end up on a tee shirt, trap boomin'
I get paid today, not just the 1st or 3rd
Young millionaire, poppin' these Addy sippin' that syrup

[Pre-Chorus]
These young niggas around my hood
Boy they some savages
Won't take no shit, just take the chips and chances
You catch anything on my neck, it gon be dancin'
I let these hoes know off top, I'm not romantic

[Chorus]
10 times out of 10 bitch im gon win
Nigga what
I got money I can burn, no pretend
Nigga what
10 times out of 10, lil bitch im gon win
It didn't take no time to turn a Honda to a Benz

[Outro]
10 times out of 10
10 times out of 10
10 times out of 10
10 times out of 10
It didn't take no time to turn a Honda to a Benz
It didn't take no time to turn a Honda to a Benz
10, 10
10, 10
10 times out of 10
10, 10
10, 10
10 times out of 10
10, 10
10, 10
10 times
10 times out of 10
