[Verse: Skeme]
(Right)
I'm just trying to find me a lick (yeah)
Ride around town with a stick (yeah)
Top down on a European whip (yeah)
And I'm getting topped down by your sis (yeah)
Ya'll niggas ain't have no chips
Ya'll little niggas don't belong on the 5th
Ya'll can't afford the shit that I sip
250 on that Activis here
You the type that get plummed by a bitch
I am the type that the same bitch sit
I am a psych keep a gun on my hip
Talk talk get the gun to your lip
You the type that keep talking talking
Talking talking till you get hit
Same nigga keep lying lying
Lying lying tell me like you rich
You need to peel to cheer up
You need to pint to cheer up
I don't need nothing to cheer up
If you push the button then I m trip
You fuck around I'ma double the clip
Let em go till it none in the clip
Since today had so much
I'ma push it up on this shit
I really got broads in Atlanta
Went to Neiman's with some cards and some scanners
I put a 4 in peace, christ
20 hours give a fuck about the fam
All of my niggas some gangstas
Big B's and red bandanas
Lil shawty I fuck on yo whore
And dip dip dip, Juelz Santana
The bitch I'ma truth ain't no doubt about it
My gunner gonna shoot ain't no doubt about it
Gang Gang Gang Gang
You can't it hear around bitch you ain't got about it
If you say money ain't a thang
Then you must ain't had the shit
I came from rag to riches
I got the right to be braggin bitch
I don't know nothing a nigga like me
Can't know nothing a nigga like me
I don't know nothing a nigga like me
Can't know nothing a nigga like me
I don't know nothing a nigga like me
Can't find you nigga like me
I don't know nothing a nigga like me
Cause there ain't one
Bitch I am serious
Yeah, Yeah
