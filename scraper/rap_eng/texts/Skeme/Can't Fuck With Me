[Verse 1]
This your bitch but she fucking me
Cause I am a fucking beast

But I fuck for free
Yeah I know who shot it
But it wasn't me
Might been a nigga under me
G.R.E.A.T. You lil niggas better run from me
And i still pour lean by the 4oz

I used to cop the shit and send it right OT
G.R.E.A.T. Yeah sound good But it still ain't me
But it still ain't me
Cause ain't too many niggas like S.K.E
Straight drop this I.N.G
I put a K in front niggas know who king
Niggas get locked and they still won't sing
I got jamaicans who tell me murder ain't no ting
All i want is green,Niggas gotta feel me like they can't see
We don't know you niggas who you be
And if rap don't work
Then i am a certiest fiend

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You lil niggas can't fuck with me
I said chess not checkers
For the record the king never move
Like a pawn and nigga check it
If life is bitch
Think i like her better neck it
And I just bought a pint
After pop a seal and neck it
Beaten up the Beat
I think I'mma need a medic
Started with a follow
Now we got the bitch undressing
Can't stand niggas
That's why all my shit aggressive
Paper is progression
In my mind that's embedded
Bet niggas thinking that
They own Let them tell it
Got Bread but
Ain't still about the bullshit you be selling
Stand tall in it and the homegirls tell it
And i am cooking up the classic
And let whole world smell it
I was born a real nigga
And i'mma die the same way
West side getting the money
Now we play yay yay
Now we play yay yay
West side getting the money
One time for my nigga getting straight to the loot
Went through some bullshit got straight to the booth
Made a album low budget like fuck it i got it
Now when you in the office
Guess who the trendest topic
Everybody talking like ballers ain't ballin
Niggas hate you when you shining
But your bitch still calling
I am a cold ass nigga but my gun still smoking
We leave a nigga close casket get his mouth open
Still sipping syrup not a pancake[?] in me
Go roll it 2Pac
I live with it
You ain't gotta feel me
But you still getting knocked
I be eating all dirty money
Still ain't got caught
Born a real nigga
And i'ma die the same way
Made a couple 100k
And blow it all in a day
Blow it all in a day
Blow it all in a day
Them the niggas speak for me
I got my own voice
All the shit that i be popping got the hoes moist
Vertile that i rock has to an a rolle royce
Just bought her, no time to kick it with some homeboys
Niggas fake as a prosthetic
Fuck you if not rapping
All i see is the sweet niggas feel i could die better
Speaking like i said it we niggas not getting
Already should made up that be the cosmetic
Get money my objective
Run over the obstacles
Cause i want all of my quarters back
Homie ain't out to auction them
I am here chasing a check
You want a chain on your neck
Here we alive and living
But we gonna die for respect bitch
Can't fuck with me
Can't fuck with me
Can't fuck with me
