I don't need no fake love or no fake friends
Bitch I'd rather run this cake up, grind and make ends
If it don't make money, hoe it don't make sense
I don't need no fake love or no fake friends (hol' up)
I don't need no fake love or no fake friends
Bitch I'd rather run this cake up, grind and make ends
Hustlin' 25, hater round my way we gettin it in
I don't need no fake love or no fake friends (hol' up)

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Big dawg with the ill flow
Yeah I heard about the dangers and the side-effects but a nigga still po'd
Sippin' til' my eyes real low and everything start to move real slow
Rappers lying and they know they lying
Still tryna tell us they the real though
Leanin' heavy, cup muddy muddy like I'm Big Mo
Feelin' like Pimp C back every time I hit you with the trill flow
24 I made my first mill and made a promise Ima get a mill mo'
Til' I reach Gold, I'm in beast mode with the all flex no chill flow
Smile big and let my grill show
Niggas fake hard and they real broke
Yeah they real broke
All that funny money, you the real joke
Flexed up, 4 pockets full of what these niggas down to die and kill and fo'
You ain't gettin' money, nigga tell me what you hear fo'

[Verse 2: Skeme]
You don't know nothin nigga
They ain't done did the shit that I did
Don't live the life that I lived
And took all the right risks to get rich
See this was the plan nigga
Get the money for my kids' kids' kids' kids
I done got chips, now I'm going big
PSA for pussy's all on my dick
I got some fame but I'm still on the same block
Drill showing with the bang-cock
Thick and sweet, you get ya brains popped
Bullets fall on niggas like they rain drops
My nina's a eater, a beast and a creature
She can't wait to meet ya and bon appetite ya
Young, rich and famous like MikeWillIMadeIt
Contrary to predictions from all of my teachers
Boys in the bleachers
Wishin' they get in the gang
The problem is we not switchin' positions cuz this life is not for the lames
Late night ride with the roof back
Eyes bloody red but the coupe black
Rap niggas still they lying to you
I know real niggas glad the truth back

[Verse 3: Skeme]
I said, it's Money over hoes
I been ten-toes in way back from the fade to the 'fro
Now I got the dreads swinging low
Livin' fast, still sippin' slow
Yeah yeah, y'all niggas know
Nowadays all niggas know
SK a dog with a flow
Westside god, got the glow
VVS's on me flexing make it kinda hard to keep it low
Checks comin', still I'm neck huntin'
Try and hit you with the scope
Whole time I been going big
Meanwhile y'all been coming short
I been ballin' on niggas, ain't talkin' 'bout sports
