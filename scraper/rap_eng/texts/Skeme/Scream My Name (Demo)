[Chorus: Chris Brown]
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Baby this shit, getting way too rough
I call your line and hope you pick up for me
Tell me that you with it, with it, with it
Girl, is you really with it, with it, with it
I hope you with it (I hope you with it)
But lately, every woman giving up on me
So I hit your line up, I hope your heart is open up for me
Tell me you get it, tell me that you get it
Im hoping that you get it
So, I’m speeding so you never see my brake lights
I’ve been fiening, going crazy ‘bout you, on my late nights
I need to know

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Thinking you get everything you want
This a relationship, a scholarship, a free ride
Say that you do everything you don't
Remember all the late nights when I cried?
Hate that I’m now *67 on your phone
Calling blocked, I’m all alone
And you know that I can't sleep, baby
Lord knows I've tried
But I hate when you're away from me, baby
Only 'posed to be mine
All mine, on my darkest days

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh
