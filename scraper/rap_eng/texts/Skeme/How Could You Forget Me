[Verse 1]
Girl I heard about your last man
Nigga ain’t even make as much as my trash man
Say you thinking bout going dite, last chance
Well let me tell you how honored I am to have the last dance
See girl I know your routine with all of the old regular aspects
Tryna knock you down so they steady spending they cash with you
I got money to burn but I’d rather spend the time
Take a couple days out the schedule, all to make you mine
Eyes full of ambition, you good in that kitchen
You used to do ballet, I know you got crazy position
I’m tryna come at you different, hope to bring you a smile
Cause I know that you ain’t have one it’s real in a while


[Hook] x 2
How could you forget me, I’m getting money
How could you forget me, you know you love me
How could you forget me, I’m getting money
How could you forget me, you know you love me


[Verse 2]
What get you high, what turn you on?
Can I turn you out to your favorite song
When you on the phone baby do your touching
Cause of how I touch in your private spots
That make you love a young nigga out in public
Giving kisses when we take it slow
Bet you I could make you melt if I take it low
Hell yeah, I play below the belt
Your sex game is A1 baby know yourself
Straight up, I do it best as I can, put the rest in your hands
Cause I want this fucks forever, ain’t no next to my plans
Except the plan B pill girl, that’s if shit get tricky
Don’t let me loose you on this road, girl stick with me
Now is it real babe, tell me is it real babe
Is it really real babe, is it really real
Tell me what’s the deal, babe
Me and you should chill babe
And if it’s really real baby, then we can split this meal, straight up


[Hook] x 2
