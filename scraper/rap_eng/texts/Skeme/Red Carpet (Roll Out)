[Intro]
I'm a street nigga bitch, I probably wooped yo nigga ass
SOX Gang, Inglewood, Ingleworld, we everywhere, international
West Coast, East Coast, Down South
They know about the SOX Gang


[Verse 1:]
Right, links and the chain so heavy
Cold game, throw frame, nigga daddy
Pushing Benz's, growing up we wanted Chevy's
I'm wavy as Max B, still I steer the ship steady, eh
They want a nigga on a cell block, calling home while yo bitch got a [?]
They won't be happy till you're shine stop
But worse they want your ass ridin hearse in a [?] box, hey
But still a nigga risin', no brakes man that boy still ridin'
The hood love it when I get to talkin' fly shit
Play me in a whip and tell whoever this is my shit, bitch
This everything I wanted nigga
Fame and fortune, look at picture, like a bonus nigga
Sight set on whoever say they want it, nigga
Mafioso man, I'm just outchea on the podium, nigga, yeah


[Hook:]
Still in the hood like I ain't got shit
Even though the boy got a whole lot
Red eyes on a PJ, late night
Everywhere I land red carpets gotta roll out
Roll out, everwhere I land red carpets gotta roll out
I'm a hot boy even when it's cold out
Everwhere I'm walkin' red carpets gotta roll


[Verse 2:]
I ain't scared of nuthin' but a early death
Cuz you'll ain't gon' be finished gettin' this work yet
Wait, hating niggas better speak up
I can't hear you when we hollerin', where the work at
OK, a nigga been fly got a bird bag
And choppa loaded tryna hit you where it hurts at
You put the beat inside my 'phones, i'mma merk that
Nigga, you don't even know my era go research that
Bitch, I been ill quit talking outta heard that
Trapper turned rapper, nigga i'mma bring the church back
Bout to park a Lambo in the lobby, where the clerk at
Life is a bitch, I fuckin' nut until it slurp that
And I speak the truth 'til you know I can't reverse that
Real life, I ain't actin', can't rehearse that
You see these niggas all moving like bitches
Boy, where your dress, where you heels and your purse at, goddamn nigga


[Hook]


[Verse 3:]
I been on, been a minute since I got my spit on
Since I was 16 all my sixteens killing contract killer murder what I live on
Wait, Been on, holla at your nigga when you get on
Hop up off the boy dick, that's deserved seat homie only bad bitches get to sit on
Wait, Been on, holla at your nigga when you get on
Wait, Been on, holla at your nigga when you get on
I heard they ain't fuckin' with me, and stop fuckin' with me
This rap game like only pourin' deuces in a 2 litre, moving like it's nuthin' to me, nigga


[Hook]


[Outro:]
