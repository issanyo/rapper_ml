[Hook : Skeme]
This lil bitch act like she know me
Then the bitch act like she want
She still 'bout that action we know she get ratchet
I make her come fuck with my woes
You ho niggas know you don't want
These fuck niggas know we ain't homeless
One time for my troopers and slide with my shooters
And know them head shots be a bonus
Cause this shit get really real, this shit get really real
See this get really real, this how we really feel
My shooters they really kill, these niggas really trill
This shit get really real, and this how I really feel

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Duke flow roll like sushi rolls
Pinky ring on Super Bowl
I tell the chauffeur swerve on groupie hoes
Them blue hunnerds brand new, but I'm used to those
Middle finger to them bitches that we used to know
I pull a ho nigga card no Yu-Gi-Oh
Twenty chains at the crib, got stupid glow
You niggas just not touchin' what I used to blow
Dope boy keep quiet  me I no like them
My BVS yes, no bro like him
I told niggas i'mma get it, whether you like it or not
So if you ain't fuckin' with me it's still alright then
See, I been stuntin' kinda hard on a lately, maybe
It's the cash flow that made a young boy go brazy
I.N.G.L.E. forever that's me, though I rep hard for mine like wherever we be

[Verse 2 : Oktane]
Step out the shower feelin' like the man
Call up Price and we execute the plan
[?]
So don't apologize without 50 grand
Was told I couldn't do it, did it the same day
Went to sleep in pussy, wake up the same way
They really converse there ain't no beat I can't slay
Bitches goin' down need payday for mayday
Quick fast never slow andale no play play
Tell a nigga twice to watch what he say say
Black and white for me you get it to stay grey
Cause Players do fuck up but bitch you ain't day day
Hoes they come through and I say Duke I got you
Girl I can fuck you you and you from the lobby
I pass when they ask so and toss you the barbie
A celebration joint cause I still got it

[Hook : Skeme]

[Verse 3 : Price]
I'm tired of that wack shit, man I had enough
Me and my passport tatted up
I drop my last girl for actin' tough
Plus her ass wasn't fat enough
I ain't got time for my time to be wasted
I don't pay attention unless it's a payement
I state the fact you should know for making statement
That some of you day 1 homie locked in placement
I see through you parodies so please don't come
Near a G
Like [?] if you scare of me
Let my nuts hang like a pair of key
You bitch textin' me for clarity
Pull up on me for that therapy
And you know doctor Dicktor jungle stabbing
If she stick around and that's automatic
The way they flip the pound you think that is magic
If it's four we hit the town with that [?]
My name carries weight like a dodge pickup
Now run my check in on my job nigga
Skeme tell 'em we ready
I don't fuck with them young hoes they be petty
Writing prophecy you smoking that rich
Benjis on benjis on benjis i told you they heavy
Let's get it
