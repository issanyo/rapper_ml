[Verse 1: Kent]
She's addicted to kush and ectasy magnums
After I poked her she rolled over and told me match one
Didn't know what to say, got up tripped over her Jay's
Her hair all over the place, she started licking my face (eww)
She said my flow so amazing, my engineer should pay me
Only hit me up when your girlfriend act crazy
God sent me an angel with no wings, we stay high like a boeing
Smoke out queen we stay blowing, going, going, going ...

[Hook: Amanda]
I don't wanna be your girlfriend, I just wanna keep your blunts rolled (repeat)

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Ugh, yeah, yeah, .... yeah
Look, and she don't wanna be my main thang
She just tryna help a rapper maintain
I touch her soul with this dick she get the holy ghost
My loves a drug she's a fiend tryna overdoz
And we don't roll how them suckas do
In fact the circle that I sit inside is sucka proof
Look, my women wanna do what lovers do
I tell her its a privilege if ever I stop and fuck with you
Cuz its money over broke bitches and if you ain't broke then you should take The time to smoke with us
Now a days girls chasing I ain't saying much
Don't show her love so she tell her friends I'm playing up
If you should leave lady stay in touch
Or you could stay with us, and lay and fuck
She stale facing saying I'm too blatant
My stroke genius til I got no time for picture painting
Naw, I keep it G as I'm supposed to so you notice the fly guy when he Approach you
Don't want no girlfriend, no I don't want no girlfriend
Just ride or die as we get high, girl until the world end

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tube]
You don't wanna be my girlfriend good
Never have, never will, never would
You talking that shit cuz you know you could
But you could get this wood, if you feeling up to par
Slide on through, let me swoop yo car
And I'mma B-R-B-P-E-A-C-E-O-U-T
Cuz I don't love you, even lucky if I like you a whole lot
My mind preoccupied wit hitting the top but as long as I stay hitting the twat
You cool stefani, I'm honored
Being that you push everything aside for me even your morals
You know you come after my partners
Wanna fall in love, girl you so good to me
But I'm supposed to treat a bitch, like a bitch, its just the hood in me
I'mma always keep a chick, with some david blaine lips
Rollin blunts and licking nuts until she feel she gotta dip
(Now lemme do some doubles)

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sleezy]
Sticky situations got my sidepiece saying that she bout done fucking wit me
Man she say that i’m her favorite, can’t explain how much she hates when She hears some messy shit up in the streets
But she understands sleeze
Sorry darling i’m just what I gotta do
Seen them feelings coming so I had to call an audible
Like Favre would do
Always speaking like you leaving but it ain’t nothing stopping you
So while you here lemme feel them tonsils boo
I’m just tryna live my life
Up all night like Dolemite
Blowin mics and marijuana too
I got no time for you
