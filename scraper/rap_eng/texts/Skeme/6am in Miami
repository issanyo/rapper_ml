I'ma lay it up
Wizzo Whadup nigga
South Beach Shit
Miami dance to the
Crooked 4 Life

It's 6AM in miami
I'ma think about timing
I am truncus[?] for life
And the realest boy on the planet
The Niggas out here just getting chip
And Bitches just getting dick
Tell this world i am killing shit
Tell these rappers, quit stealing shit
I am really that nigga now
No question marks and commas
We hitting atlanta next
I set the play up with drama
Presidential my wrist
The yellow gold be obama
Bitch i'ma terrorist threat
They done resurrected osama
I Drop the album for when
My double disk come to summer
These niggas lying, I barely talk
I just speak through my numbers
I don't wash my dirty hands, now
I got shooters to dump you
You get big headed with me
Flachet top, like you my chauffer
I took my dallas to south beach
Ain't too much out of reach
I'm back for my spot so nigga
Just get your ass out of my seat
Don't speak about what i am about to be
I am just practicing what i preach
I rap about what i really live
They just rapping about what they see
This shit here be a SOP
So shout out to this hennesey
Tied to me over mine mix
The more i get this lean
I am I.N.G.L.E forever
No second guessing
S.O.X. until the death
You know the set i am reppin
My niggas ain't the CCW
Use the concealed weapon
We stash rugers in ubers
Even the chauffer feels threatened
All this game i got
I must been a Pimp in my past life
Tell Sosa I'm coming back
I need my one and half my
Who is you to me ?
Because truefully, if it be you or me
All that ever shoots in woop woops
That's how you know skeme
S.G. and O.D.B. for nigga that might go for <3
Charging you what?
I have been duke
That bitch, a hoe for free
Crooked

You bitch, I am on a bus
And Ain't no giving a fuck
Ain't got no shirt on the miami beach
What's happening
Gold on my chest
