Hope ain't take too long...
Believe that

[Verse]
Somebody told me, Tomorrow ain't a promise
But I tell em that it is till somebody does the honors
Tryin to die rich just cause I was born broke
This the only chance given I just pray I don't choke
Eye's full of fire, Lungs full of smoke
Havin visions of water's island hopin of a boat
I ain't never left Inglewood got to keep me
Thinkin if I get to keep on breathin I'll breath deeply
Watchin the game rotate
Know I'm doin something wrong if them niggas don't hate
Contrary to your belief, Money won't wait
So all a nigga know is try and ball no pump fake
Lord please let me in them gates
Cause granny told me that her prayers kept me in your grace (Ha!)
Plus the streets ain't the safest of places
Inglewood lettin death stare us right in our faces, Look
This is nothin new, Shots a hundred proof
Layin with my Southern Boo tryin to see another Coup
To get that money shit I'm jumpin through another loop
Probably get chance and trip like my brothers do
Hopefully rappin don't fail me
Specially since my mother told me that she wouldn't bail me
But yo main bitch probably could
Tellin me, "No" but a nigga like me probably could
Mixtape after mixtape steady grindin till a nigga get to see his big break
And this is how it sounds when you ill
Middle finger up yellin, "Fuck how you feel!"
