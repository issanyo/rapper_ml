[Hook]
I ain't give you none but the real me
I made a lot of money and I'm still me
I know what it is or what it will be
Imma make the whole world feel me
Imma make the whole world feel
Imma make the whole world feel me
I got one goal even if it kills me
I gotta give this to the world

[Verse 1]
Young boss some headed of the game
I keep it real on my exchange just never the same
My point of view his somethin' I could probably never explain
All I say is get that paper through the pleasure or pain
Got so much game, I should've come with a rep
Boyâ€™s givin' me advice you just waistin' your braith
I lost my mind, now the boy retracing my steps
But retracting I rather live with regrets
You know I came from the bottom, came from the gutter
Tell these dollas I don't care about 'em, middle finger fuck 'em
And you know they mention me when talkin' bout the world nowadays
Cause they know that I be reppin like I still should always
All prayers to the most high, who the most fly
I don't see no competition hands over both fives
Young gunner, money can't stop and it won't stop
Pushin' forward and now my ghost ridin' with the doors wide

[Hook]
I ain't give you none but the real me
I made a lot of money and I'm still me
I know what it is or what it will be
Imma make the whole world feel me
Imma make the whole world feel
Imma make the whole world feel me
I got one goal even if it kills me
I gotta give this to the world

[Verse 2]
See how they talk about me I should change my name to the best
Hate that's on my nigga? I come from nothin' my nigga
Unless it's money, I'm wonderin' what we discussin' my nigga
Matter fact if it ain't bout money no discussions my nigga
You playin' russian roulette with a fully loaded revolver
I came in broke as a bitch and then turn myself to a baller
Got no time for these stollers I gotta go out and get it
We know you niggas ain't gangs man who the fuck is you kiddin'?
Tell them non-believers come and visit just to see how we livin'
Put that on me you know I stay the fuck out the kitchen
See my attention get they guap to put my dawg on position
Homie listen ain't nothing but digits in a young niggas position
So bring a pint down and pour it around, let's roll it down
While I keep it workin' overtime, keep the flow around
I just get the check and blow it now, see it's just more line
I'm the trillest if you never knew then you know it now
Aye!

[Hook]
I ain't give you none but the real me
I made a lot of money and I'm still me
I know what it is or what it will be
Imma make the whole world feel me
Imma make the whole world feel
Imma make the whole world feel me
I got one goal even if it kills me
I gotta give this to the world
