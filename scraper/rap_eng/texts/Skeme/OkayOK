[Verse 1: Flip Major]
I'm in the game to be the realest, smoking on the illest
Got my team with me, repping 7th 'til the kill us
Sipping Hennessy, show me some titties please
I, I can make you bust it open, mami, hit the tree
Say shawty fuck with me, I, I got all the cheese
And from the Bay down to L.A, man, they fuck with me
I'm smoking Cali buds, I fuck with Cali thugs
That got tats all on they face, you know they keep it hood
I fuck with Jimmy Lowe, you know a nigga throw
I mix that twenty four and Sprite, it got a nigga on

[Hook : Flip Major]
Okay OK, Okay OK
She told me she go both ways
Okay OK

Okay OK
I sit and watch her bust it open
All day, all day
Okay OK
Okay OK, Okay OK
She told me she go both ways
Okay OK

I sit and watch her bust it open
All day, all day
Okay OK, Okay OK

[Verse 2: Skeme]
I came with a stack and she came with a bitch
I know this lil hoe is the shit
If she say that she came here with Flip
Roc say he doing it major, and he going up with that paper
I heard that a nigga's a hater, but fuck it, that boy just got hit, got a laser
I aim at you with a raygun, we don't be missing with headshots
I put the green out on niggas if ever I find that the motherfuckin' bread stop
I got the game in a leg lock, I got me Ben Frank in a head lock
Squeezing and choking that nigga, now all day my traphouse is open my nigga
Like hey, don't you play with a gangsta, you know that you greedy
Niggas be acting like they ain't got money for me, I'm like "fuck do you mean?"
I paid a rack, fifty G's, a hundred K busting all out of the seams
She say that she ratchet, I hit it and pass it to all of my motherfuckin' team

[Hook : Flip Major]
Okay OK, Okay OK
She told me she go both ways
Okay OK
I gotta have it my way
Okay OK
I sit and watch her bust it open
All day, all day
Okay OK
Okay OK, Okay OK
She told me she go both ways
Okay OK
I gotta have it my way
Okay OK
I sit and watch her bust it open
All day, all day
Okay OK, Okay OK

[Verse 3 : ARoC]
Hi, I am the realest you know
I'm willing to go, above and beyond
And make sure that you niggas is feeling the flow
Oh, you ain't know? I did this a minute ago
And I think that it's fine time that I blow
So I hit up the bro
And told him to pass me that tissue and watch how I shit on you hoes
Killing a show, so I got sick of being bored
Had to start getting that dough now
To the ceiling it goes, then back to the floor now
Nigga, back again, it's safe to say I'm on track to win
You thought you were saucy, better ask again
Reality check, you better cash it in
Okay OK, Okay
I killed this shit, they know I did, like I'm OJ
See I don't fit in with these niggas, I have no place
I told that bitch to bust it open, guess what she say? Guess what she say?

[Hook : Flip Major]
Say K, OK, Okay OK
She told me she go both ways
Okay OK
I gotta have it my way
Okay OK
I sit and watch her bust it open
All day, all day
Okay OK
Okay OK, Okay OK
She told me she go both ways
Okay OK
I gotta have it my way
Okay OK
I sit and watch her bust it open
All day, all day
Okay OK, Okay OK
