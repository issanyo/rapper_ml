[VERSE 1: Kris Kasanova]
You know the story

I met shorty out in Flatbush
Pictures on that MacBook
Met her Friday, hit it Friday
You see how long that took
Say my voice do something major

Fuck with her behavior
I be waking up the neighbors

Work her out, I'm AC Slater
Bout my paper, bout my paper

HUH?!
Ye'en know?

Chips on top of chips, my pockets looking like casino
Shotgun, with Kino
Ballin' out with no chemo
Know I keeps it all kilo

Matter fact, add another zero
We catching waves, they catching feelings
Got yo bottom bitch topless

Legs hittin' the ceiling
Triple X nigga
Living life just like a felon
So when they ask me what I do, this is what I tell 'em

[HOOK]
All I smoke is OG
All I bump is my shit
Ask 'em why they hate on me
Yo bitch be on my dick

Niggas actin funny when I'm back in town
Ask me what I do
I tell 'em shut it down

[VERSE 2: Skeme]
I know killers in California who down for the kid
If I give niggas the word then they gon' tear off yo lid
I got bitches on payroll who do whatever for peso
I get my lean from the pharmacy

Cocaina from Pedro
Living straight from the ghetto
Riding round with that metal

Thuggin' heavy on bitches

I'm strapped and ready for snitches
I make it look like its nothin'

It might be something to you
Only call yo bitch when I get bored that ho just something to do
Pay 600 for shoes
Shits is Louie, they euro
Brand new on all these haters

I just hopped out of that two door
My cup be fulla that purple
This that actin, no Nuvo
They said I'd never make it

Thank the Lord I found me a loophole

Nigga

[HOOK]
All I smoke is OG
All I bump is my shit
Ask 'em why they hating on me
Yo bitch be on my dick

Niggas actin funny when I'm back in town
Ask me what I do
I tell 'em shut it down

[VERSE 3: Jarv Dee]
Got a young Seattle sluey
Badass yellow wit a booty
But she gets no encore, cause its musical chairs when I get moody
See them floozies always choosey
But I swear the always choose me
I just hit 'em and break like wind
Wendy Winston, chick excuse me
Got that garbage pail
Funky smell
Twisted in a cigarill'
Problem? Fuck it
Pop a pill
Or I lean until I'm Texas trill
Texas chainsaw ya chick
Bet he won't, but I bet I will
I'm taking drags from the blunt until I'm dead
Nigga, Emmett Till
Mr. Novocain Vain, I could give a fuck how another nigga feel
Tell him stay in his land or his Mario Kart can get banana peeled
4-5 in the horse Porsche
That's just that bonanza feel
Gold around my neck blowing Olympic O's, that's just how greatness feel

[HOOK]
All I smoke is OG
All I bump is my shit
Ask 'em why they hate on me
Yo bitch be on my dick

Niggas actin' funny when I'm back in town
Ask me what I do
I tell 'em shut it down

Shut em down

Yeah nigga, I shut em down
