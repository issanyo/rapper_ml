[Verse 1: Skeme]
I be on the purple, moving slow I see 'em red wine
Brain so good, I just pray she keep me on her mind
See c-note what I got for her everytime
I like it when she say it's mine even if she lyin'
I ain't mad at you baby girl, do your thing
This good dick make her come back, boomerang
I love the way she drop it down on a real one
She know what's up so when the boy talk, she feel him
Young nigga, long checks, certainly stuntin'
And the word out you heard 'bout he workin' with something
Ass on you make you look like you from Houston
Shades on at night, but I can see you choosin'
Hey!
I know a nigga like my women fire like [?]
Brown skin, bow-legged and it's crazy from behind

[Hook: Skeme]
It's something 'bout you baby, you just do it for me
It's something 'bout you baby, you just do it for me
It's something 'bout you baby, you just do it for me
I don't know what it is, but girl just do it for me

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Pussy wet, I'm just trying to drown in it
Beat it up, hear that bed squeak sound in it
And you know I don't rock with no [?] unless the pound in it
You got a nigga mesmerized how you swing around 'round with it
I know that these niggas won't fuck you like I do
I text you at night and you reply like psycho
And when I pull up on you, know I'm trying to park it all on you
Down bitch, I know if it go there I can call on you
I just want you to put that ass on my lap girl
Girl you and me time, rewind, throw it back girl
All that ass on you make you look like you from Atlanta
And I know you with the business, I might put you in my daily planner

[Hook: Skeme]
It's something 'bout you baby, you just do it for me
It's something 'bout you baby, you just do it for me
It's something 'bout you baby, you just do it for me
I don't know what it is, but girl just do it

[Outro]
Do it, do it for me
Do it, do it, do it for me
Do it for me, do it for me
Do it, do it, do it for me
Show me you can
Show me you can do it for me
Baby can you
Baby can you do it for me
Show me you can
Show me you can do it for me
I don't know what it is, but you do it for me
