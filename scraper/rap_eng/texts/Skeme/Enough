[Chorus:]
I don't know what this is might be loving might be lust
But Everytime we fuck it feel like we can't get enough
I don't know what this is might be loving might be lust
But Everytime we fuck it feel like we can't get enough
Baby i need that mama i need that
I promise i need that you gonna need that

[Verse 1:]
I just want a bad bitch who up on her fast move
Who knows the fucking laws on this state of attraction
Mama i hope you know that i think it's magic how
Them denim skinners oh damn how you fit all that ass in
My choosing love how niggers trying to cuff her
But she promise her sell that pussy niggers won't touch her no
I like your confidence mama you everywhere
And part of my honestness is your pussy desertioness

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Girl you know i think you bad as hell
Take off all your clothes for me girl be yourself
I know you know these niggers got a girl and you got a boy
I ain't worried about these bitches babe don't be so paranoid
This bitch so for real I’m trying to touch your panties right
Grip your hips just like the real pussy
You trip like candy paints and you pass all that purple but i
Can't say to you that i ain't no saint
I am going to fuck you like I’m supposed to
I hope you do the same

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Take it off bitch and roll over let me see
Let me i say take it off and bend over bitch let me see
Let let me see hold up hey
I wanna fuck you
Hold up hey
I wanna fuck you

[Chorus]
