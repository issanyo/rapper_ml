Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas just talking that tough shit
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Ok, I’m riding round with my stacks, and I got my home town on my back
My enemies on my Malcolm X, and my yopper right in my lap
Me, I represent for that Inglewood, with my money right and they know it
On prometesine with that pistol plan, I’m banging out the whole focus
These square niggas so bogus, this jord bright and hoes notice
I’m vibin out and just zonin, I swear that these lame niggas don’t want it
I got this southern drawl in my vocals, I’m bout my mail, ain’t no poster bitch
I’m bizy getting that OT though I got no time to play with no locals
I’m swagging out in these clubs, and I dropped yo rent to stay on that couch
Take about 3 months of that same rent
To pay for that gold in my mouth
Bitch I do this, I do this
This here ain’t just bout no music
I bleed the block and I grinded out
I beat the bass down till I bruise it
My time is now and I got it
Fuck these haters tryna block it
Got that dollar built in my Levi's
And these racks tucked in my pocket
My time is now and I got it
Fuck them haters tryna knock it
Got that Louie built in my Levi's
And that hammer tucked in my pocket
These niggas just out here fronting
These niggas just out here playing
These niggas stay talking that bullshit
I ain’t mad at y’all I’m just saying
These niggas must think they nice
These niggas think they shit tight
Real nigga eryday and night
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas just talking that tough shit
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, nah
Let them hate hate, but my case straight
I’m with a bad bitch and on vacate
So fuck these niggas and nay say
Them niggas more than weak, just like 8 days
We got ak’s that will trouble shoot
You get caught up in a polo bubble goo
See my hoes man, they wouldn’t even fuck with you
You act out, have a shooter see what’s up with you
See I’m down to die for respect homie
Sox my set homie, red bitch to get wet fo me
And tell her toe touch and do a stretch on it
I flex homie, flex homie
Ice cold on my pimp shit
Other rappers on shrimp shit
I’m having red wine with my shrimp dish
Y’all just talking bout getting it
But y’all ain’t real about bidess
I’m grinding out till I’m finished
To drop that period on my sentence
City boy be talking bout getting it
But they ain’t really bout bidness
I’m grinding out till I’m finished
Versace shades all in my vision
These niggas just out here fronting
These niggas just out here playing
These niggas stay talking that bullshit
I ain’t mad at y’all I’m just saying
These niggas must think they nice
These niggas think they shit tight
Real nigga eryday and night
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas just talking that tough shit
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, nah
Any city hero, I rock Camero, watch my spot
Clock in the nearo never been a yeat
4 4 60 shots, nigga just breathe, aim for the face
Nigga fuck your knees
Real gangs nigga fuck peace
I’ve been here, I’ma die here
Live life nigga with no fear
No tattoos just stab wounds
I’ve been a goon, I’ve been a fool
I broke the rules, willing to loose
Say you tough, my mini 14 will call your bluff
Los Angeles hot top just put your hoe on thick
Fuck her good, then go big, hit it with the jig
South central shit
Hundred miles on my cortez, watching for the feds
Don’t die for dough dough boy, baking the bread
She gave me the pussy cause how I said
How I play, you can’t fade it
You roach niggas, you roach hoes
Read it, racks on racks nigga
That’s how I play it, fucker
These niggas just out here fronting
These niggas just out here playing
These niggas stay talking that bullshit
I ain’t mad at y’all I’m just saying
These niggas must think they nice
These niggas think they shit tight
Real nigga eryday and night
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life, y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
Y’all niggas ain’t bout that life
