[Verse 1 : Skeme]
Young OG, straight out the "I"
With the hallelujah Holy Grail flow
Slim nigga, but his pockets thicker than them H-town and ATL hoes
The day that you find someone better than me in this bitch
That's the day that hell froze
I made it this far from Crenshaw and Manchester
Blocks so hot, that's the hell hole (hold up)
OT Lb's of that Cali OG
A.k.a we could send you some L-bows
We don't be selling nuthin' less than QP's
What the fuck you gonna do with that scale bro?
Escobar season, all year round my way
But we get to knock at your tell bro
Chef of extras like I'm Raekwon, Cuban Links
So I'm serving clientele bro
Underground King, like I'm Bun B
Underground King, like I'm Chad Butler
Need it all before I go, gotta have it
Bitch, when we started
We ain't have nuthin' (hold up)
Woke up this mornin', my mind was on money
Been like that for years, every Monday to Sunday
Hustlin' from Monday to Monday, she Tuesday to Tuesday
Still drinkin' that drink, not on Dusse'
Do what I want, give a fuck 'bout what who say?
When I say who say
That mean him, him, and you say
I kick the shit, I mean kick it like Liu Kang
Just hit the A, I might head to the Blue Flame
25K in this bitch, that's just loose change
Bitch that's our money, miss me with that new slang
Hands-free while I'm parking this new thing
Recline the seat and get head out your boo thang' (wait)

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Right....
This shit here be over sick, I'm over shit
Like fuck a bitch, it's over quick
Middle fingers for the cam
Like 'Pac and shit
Show you niggas how to ball
Gregg Popovich
I'm the type of nigga pull up and knock the fifth
You the type of nigga, sit down and squat to piss
Got a Migo, all we talk about is guac and chips
Now hater nigga suck a dick, use lots of spit
I go harder in that paint than Rodman did
I ride 'round the I side with a Glock in the whip
And fuck with any nigga thinkin' I got dollars to get
I've been fucking over checks
You just starting to get
O.k. a nigga been trill, I live in the hills
My hand on the wheel, and got a muthafuckin' license to kill
And bitch my denim expensive, my clip is extended
The cake in my vision
I'm going for it, like its 4th and some inches
Before a nigga fall off, get the sawed off
Call a hearse for these niggas
Get these bodies hauled off
Fat mac on a Slim Thug, Ima boss hog
Got Loaded everything out your nigga mouth raw
Switch up stance, and throw them hooks south paw
West side Ingles, but got a down south drawl
You ain't came across a nigga like me (hell nah)
I could have a hundred hands
And I still wouldn't feel ya'll, nigga....

[Outro]
Dead ass, fuck you niggas talkin' about
Over, over, over
Look Im'ma  start just....
Havin' a class for these little niggas to learn how to rap or something
Serious 'bout that
