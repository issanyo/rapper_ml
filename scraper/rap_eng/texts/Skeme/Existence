[Verse 1]
I give that raw to you straight from the source
Nuttin' saturated
Still I never get congratulated
I graduated, but it seem like niggas mad I made it
Sad to say it, but I had to say it
These boys masquerade, try and mask the hate
It's bool, all these hoes I'm fuckin' havin' pageant phases
When it comes to stackin' faces, I get mad impatient
I can't post when that bag is waiting
All facts
Before rap, man I used to stuff bags weigh em'
Now first class tag every single bag, I bring em'
But ain't it brazy mane
All that change made and it still ain't change him
Same nigga from the gate
I done lost niggas to them cages and the graves
That just wasn't my play
Like my nigga Pat say
Pay attention to this picture I paint
Spit scripture when I'm sippin' this drank
The realest shit that Im'ma say
If god wasn't god in my way
Probably wouldn't be with you today
Realest shit that Im'ma say
If god wasn't god in my way
The SK wouldn't be breathin' today

[Chorus]
Nothing was promised to us
Nothing was given
I spoke all of this into existence
I know you see the life that we livin'
I spoke all of this into existence
All I needed was the set
All I needed was a team
Now them lights, shit they boring
Diamonds just dance
Wasn't nothing promised
Wasn't nothing given
I spoke this shit into existence (yaah)

[Verse 2}
Pop the addy
Pour mud and now my heart, mind racin'
I get wasted all the time
But don't want my time wasted
I got a question for you haters
How you hate on the underdog that made it?
Thats kinda brazy, but fuck it though
Im done dealin' with those small cases
Im'ma business, you know, withdrawal statements
Back to them hinyes, blue strips and small faces
If you play around with those you vanish with all traces
Swear to god man I mean that shit
You internet thugs can screenshot and ping that shit
Those Fat Joe shots I pop will make you lean back quick
You in trouble, the old Skeme back bitch
Im just a millionaire who mindset still set stuck in the field
Young O-G, it been a minute but I'm in it still
I'm a simple man, I just want my guap and my thrills
I'm nothing short of ready, regular and real

[Chorus]
Nothing was promised to us
Nothing was given
I spoke all of this into existence
I know you see the life that we livin'
I spoke all of this into existence
All I needed was the set
All I needed was the team
Now them lights, shit they boring
Diamonds just dance
Wasn't nothing promised
Wasn't nothing given
I spoke this shit into existence (yaah)
