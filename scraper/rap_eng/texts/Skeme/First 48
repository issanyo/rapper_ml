Yeah, you know me Big Crooked
Skeme, right
I guess I'll just murder this shit real quick then
What up Ill Will

[Verse]
Look
Pimpin' ain't dead cause a nigga still living
Sox gang bang bitch and ain't never switch it
Ya man don't touch half the money I'm getting
I'm a stand up guy, but baby all my cars sitting
Move in slow motion off the potion I'm sipping
Double cup stuck, nigga I ain't even tripping
Ice in my ears make it hard for me to listen
And you ain't gotta ask if I'm on, it's a given
Now where the bread at, better yet, where your head at
Money up nigga, yea dat, act like I never said that
Smoking fire, stacks on too tall
Trying to find a bitch with old money and new draws
Girl I'm a killer
Them other niggas buying, girl you're talking to the dealer
Dollar go-getter, wood gold realer
Nigga 8 shots fired split em up like Swishers
What it do, see they don't have a clue
She said she heard I was raw, I said that rumor is true
Sitting in the coupe, trying not to look cooped up
Ice cream paint, bitches die to get scooped up
Shoutout big Dom, ho choose up
If you ain't with it bitch, you can beat it, duece up
Money make a bitch recognize
And if not, bitch, get a better set of eyes
Fly like falcons and high like mountains
My cash stack stupid and we ain't even counting
Champagne on pour like a fountain
You know that Ros√© is no less than two thousand
Sire(?) in this motherfucker with me, too geeked
Got the squad blacked out, boy, too deep
Get your ass stomped trying to run up on me
Cause all my niggas on go and all my bitches on E
Yeah, turn me up and turn me on
You know I'm in my zone, I got kush in my cologne
For LA I'm putting on, bitch this where I belong
I be smoking on that strong, like my women to be grown
Flow so diesel, you are no equal
Number one gunner, other rappers just sequels
Pistols & Palm Trees, boy this here a prequel
Flying in shittin' on them boys, seagulls
No redo, bitch, you know we do
Hit a 3 like them Heat(?) do
