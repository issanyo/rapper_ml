[Hook 1: Skeme]
Was on the outside lookin now we in
And life’s still a bitch but we live
I done kept it G from the beginning
So blur that bullshit and focus on this business

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Look, I’m worth my weight in gold (and that’s fo sho)
Don’t give a fuck, make sure my haters know
Bitch I’m bout this dough
This game I kick, it creeks my paper flow
Every year get a new set, we’s no HBO
Got class in session, bitch start takin notes (let’s make it flow)
The gang forever til the day I go (bitch that’s out to go)
You watched my struggle now just watch me blow (word)
Cuz at this point a loss ain’t optional, no

[Hook 1: Skeme]

[Hook 2: Skeme]
Blur that bullshit and focus on yo business
Blur that bullshit and focus on yo business
You know they sayin money come like it go
So blur that bullshit and focus on yo business

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I’m from Leimert, Skeme from the wood
Drew from the bay, I ball from Venice
Niggas was rapping and getting pussy
And getting money, I didn't invent it
I listen to NNer, true to my word
Doing superb as I have predicted
Back in 06 now we legit
It tasted with shrimp, we can’t get evicted
We gon go hard then we gon shop
Straight to the lot, cars expensive
So what they hoes
Going there with me
They know it’s for real so they don’t be trippin
I don’t do snitches or bitches with cameras
That after we fuck they like to take pictures
My name is Dom, this OPM
Leisure size gang, we all here are winners

[Hook 1 & 2]

[Verse 3: Skeme]
I just keep spittin the shit that I know niggas feelin cuz niggas be feelin like me
And I just got in this industry while you was in the street
Bitch I was out on these streets
Nowadays ballin nice, we was hungry as fuck
I just make sure my niggas gon eat
And for when I couldn’t afford it, my clothing imported, designers from head to my feet
And if you was askin me where I stunt
I remember hittin the porch for free lunch
Got this cash, I’m bout to re-up
Relax, hit back with my both my feet up
SG ODB for life
Tell them niggas we up
Better yet tell em niggas G up
It’s a money marathon tell that hater keep up

[Hook 1 & 2]
