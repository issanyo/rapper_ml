Skeme cruising, create and lead a rich lifestyle
5, 4, 3, 2, liftoff right now
Boy, if you're talking money, this is how you might sound
Stress on no haters, keep my paper long as nightgowns
That money talking, I can't pipe down
I seen a girl I used to hit, and she a wife now
He think she perfect, me, I think that girl a pipehound
Down since day one, so get the fuck right out
Cero, uno, cinco, seis
Liked it while my records play
Me and dough don't separate
I need my dough everyday
Industry, I'm in the streets
Boy, that's where you'll find me at
Riding Euro two-doors, you can't catch me in no Pontiac
You rappers realize boring, so they lie instead
The boys out here be sweeter than Hawaiian bread
Road to the riches, I ain't never seen a light red
All the sights saw me, homie, I'm a need a bobsled
Unless she wifey, I do no cuddling, kissing or hugging
Just hit here with that perfect stroke, no paintbrush
Unless you're talking 'bout this bread, ain't no discussion
You know crooked been a hundred from the get thugin
Woah, don't stop, keep it flowing
All this guap, I got to walk with my Glock lever showing
From the block to the top, that's exactly where we going
Counting cash 'til I here big at six in the morning
