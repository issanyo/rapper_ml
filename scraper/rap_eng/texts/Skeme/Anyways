[Verse 1]
Call me Duke [?]
What's hatnin' ? It's big gangs and them bullets don't scrab me
You get out of pocket I'ma pop till it's jammin'
I'm quick a hollow knives bust back no standing
How you boy is broke, I don't understand it
I'm getting brand cheese like a boring ass sandwich
I keep me a bitch who keep my dick as hard as granite
She blow me like a check on my beater, she need a bandage
A1 since day one I never been a sucker
King  S-K, that's a bad motherfucker
Baby said she heard I ball like itâ€™s something at the Rucker
A pussy got mileage nigga I don't even touch it
Know I check the car facts, I own more paper than a hard back
You ain't call bout cash I don't call back
I been getting to it for a minute, where was y'all at
Fall back!


[Hook]
Fuck them all, fuck them with the minute whack
I can touch a hunned long any day
You ain't getting paid then you in the way
But nigga we gon' get the money anyway
Nigga we gon' get the money anyway
Nigga we gon' get the money anyway
I'm greedy need a couple mills on my dinner plate
Nigga we gon' get this money anyway


[Verse 2]
4 chains on your homie make my neck hurt
Whitey pocket watch his Google and my net worth
Black ties fairly first how to set work
Contract killers lil nigga I'ma an expert
See I done jumped in the game talking double dutch
Money raised first place, never runner up
The strap tucked, I'ma buck on whoever runnin' up
Reason you ain't got it how I got it you ain't done enough
S.O.X. Game who ain't heard of us, we anybody murderers
Promise you won't see it how we see it til you further up
I come through in a Rolls Royce, leave a hoe with no choice
But to hit the back and let me smash with the curtains up

[Bridge]
Fuck the lil nosey ass niggas and bitches
Who always won't be in my bindess
We burn these papers like answers
You know it's no love if you don't t talk digits, nigga


[Hook]
Fuck them all, fuck them with the minute whack
I can touch a hunned long any day
You ain't getting paid then you in the way
But nigga we gon' get the money anyway
Nigga we gon' get the money anyway
Nigga we gon' get the money anyway
I'm greedy need a couple mills on my dinner plate
Nigga we gon' get this money anyway


[Verse 3]
No price we mobbing forever
We can run a check up or raber
Been a runner word and back these niggas ain't special
Laugh at these niggas cause they ain't on my level
My own head preach more money more problems
I look dog dead in his eyes told him none of that
Cause more money when you meet
Put them gunners on they feet
If your G's getting G's where the problem at
Young boy I got a lot of racks, lot of straps
If it's an issue with you we gon' pull up out where you at
Hop out, draw out I paint the picture on the nigga
Smoke one these clowns like a swisher full of killer

[Hook]
Fuck them all, fuck them with the minute whack
I can touch a hunned long any day
You ain't getting paid then you in the way
But nigga we gon' get the money anyway
Nigga we gon' get the money anyway
Nigga we gon' get the money anyway
I'm greedy need a couple mills on my dinner plate
Nigga we gon' get this money anyway
