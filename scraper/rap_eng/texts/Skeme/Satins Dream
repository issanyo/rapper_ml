Verse 1:
I feel lost in this tragic altercation
I need some rest, laid back in this lovely vacation
Possessed in my mind, possessed in the time
Lord forgive me, feed me some of your wine
Im sorry for committing this fuming crime
I wish I can take my soul back in a quick second
Only thing I look forward to is paradise in heaven
Now im raging with all the bullshit, but bullshit is the shit
I tend to not fuck with now im blowing all this piff in the face
Of the devil, I hope I don't become a full time blown out full man rebel
Man I hate this decision on so many levels, don't the "man" below ever temp you
Im telling you like..

Verse 2:
Man below calling my name
Im trying to remain sane
I feel like im being held down
With burning chains'
A brave hearted individual
Feeling so uncharted
Lost ever since the news came
My creator had departed
This planet that we inhibit
As I lay deep in thoughts I hear whispers
Sending chills down my spine
At times I take actions
Which are not mine
I tell myself that were our own gods
No need for a higher power
Man-made towers
Hand planted flowers
Cold showers wash down my sins'
But at times money becomes my fascination
Lost in my own mind
Being held under self-encarceration
