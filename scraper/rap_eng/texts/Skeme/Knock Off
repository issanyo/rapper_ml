Hey ama get mine today cause tomorrow ain't promised at all
You gotta watch these niggas and these bitches nowadays
Everybody wanna find yah flaw
Law they wanna knock you out
They try tah knock you out
When you on top all these niggas love to pray that you fall
And they plot on how to knock you off
They wanna knock you off

[Verse 1]
I used to ask the lord for answers
Now all i ask is he watch me
Only so much is in mah hand
Whatever is out of my reach i hope that he got me
I be grinding for mine every nickel and dime
City sitting on mah shoulders how to make myself a boss
All it took was some time
Lots blood sweat and tears tryin to make sure i shine
Now am worth one million two million three  four
And i refuse to rest till i see a billion more
Niggas know i got em and i'ma get they hating on they boy
But i don't give a fuck about the crushing little noise
Forever loyal till am dormant shining on it
Middle finger fuck my opponent
Bitch how you want it
See my last few years been full a late nights and early morning
Raw facts
I learn to earn a lot while i wait on mah moment  hold up

Hey on this road to the dough i see friends turn fo
And Gs turn fiend what the fuck a nigga mean
Money riding turn these woman into hoes
Fire fuel by the greed they want ends but no means

Grown up with role models never come through
And no one ask the truth
