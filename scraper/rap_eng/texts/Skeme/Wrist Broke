[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Damn it Daniel, I think my wrist broke
Go against the Ruler, see long ropes and pitchforks
Ugh, I guess my lingo really gets to 'em
Ten chains on me, you see me, you do the stiffarm
Lightning brighter than, I ain't even throw my wrist on
My shoes look cleaner, why I need help tryna get on
Niggas big time rappers, why y'all ain't got none of this shit on?
Shit nigga, this shit crazy huh?
Drakeo put the F&N down, you just a maniac
LED lights on my wrist, wish I could turn 'em down
Cooler how I'm coolin', the Ruler, LA just like my sound
Do what I do, I can use this shit in Pakistan
Ugh, I like this shit
At the battle of the Maisons, on morse with lightning sticks
Better watch your bitch when approaching, you might get hit
Just cracked a whole break in the air, I like the scent
Damn it Daniel, I think my wrist broke
Bruce Lee kicks for niggas thinkin' that they Kimbo
I'm him though, shit, I think my wrist froze
Bruce Lee kicks for niggas thinkin' that they Kimbo

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Damn it Daniel, I think my wrist broke
I can see you panhandling, look like your wrist broken
Man let that bitch breathe, I think my wrist broke, shit
Be quiet Daniel, I think my wrist broke

[Verse 2: Skeme]
The Duke and the Ruler, we probably make your bitch a slave for them knots
She a choosy suzy, askin' what I paid for my watch
Blow forty K, fuck out of here what my Rollie say
Rappers lyin' like they bomin', livin' where they homies stay
Clean as a whistle but still ridin' with this throwaway
Silly billies, think a nigga slippin', shit that's your mistake
I'm usually on they necks but if they play I'm on his throat today
We catch a body, bury a body, that shit a frozen case
Sittin' at the top, I'm lookin' 'round like it's a lonely place
Think about this shit again like it's the only place
These niggas claimin' that they kin but we don't know they face
Holy water flooded on my neck, make my soda shake
Weight of the world on my back but keep my shoulders straight
Realest shit that ever been said, that's what I'm known to say
Lil homie come for what's mine, you gettin' blown away
Niggas actin' like they ain't know, I'll make 'em know today

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Damn it Daniel, I think my wrist broke
I can see you panhandling, look like your wrist broken
Man let that bitch breathe, I think my wrist broke, shit
Be quiet Daniel, I think my wrist broke
