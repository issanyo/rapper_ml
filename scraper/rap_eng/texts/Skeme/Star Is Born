[Verse 1]
On this road to riches I done lost young niggas who never grew
So if somebody gotta die tonight it's better you
Real niggas still on top, I'm living proof
The whole world know bout Duke, fuck is you?
Money matter most all I know and ever knew
I frontline and dump nines but mine never spook
Every time I hopped in the booth I spit the truth
Now every time I hop out the coupe it's missing roof

[Bridge]
See what it take for a gangster to get his due for painting pictures so vivid blind niggas get the view
These niggas wanna walk like me but don't fit the shoe
That's why I never mind the bullshit and get the loot (woo)

[Verse 2]
First I found a way I found a purpose
Still a work in progress never claim to be perfect
I'm still hidin' pain with all the shit that's on the surface
This here is gods work I hope you haters pray for mercy
If niggas only knew, the road I took to get here and shit I had to do
I said if niggas only knew, the sacrifices made and the shit that we been through
They'd probably understand why I got to be the man and why I need a hundred grand in my motherfuckin hand
They don't want me to win Mama
I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn
N-no ma'am
I told myself it's your time
No more time for time wasted
Success is so close right now.. you can taste it
Pardon me, pardon my French, pardon my statements And forgive me if I'm wrong for what I'm saying.. but I gotta say it
Fuck the rules and fuck the regulations
According to those.. I wouldn't make it.. but bitch I made it
Fuck the rules and fuck the regulations
Wasn't no handouts, this shit here from dedication
Aggressive bout my payment rather get up off my ass and go chase it instead of waitin
They wonder why I barely get sleep and I'm so impatient
I'm shell shocked; got homies who resting for hesitation

[Outro]
I went from down bad and broke to a rich nigga
I worked too hard to be worried bout these bitch niggas
I went from down bad a broke to a rich nigga
Everyday a star is born now make a wish nigga
Everyday a star is born now make a wish nigga
Everyday a star is born
