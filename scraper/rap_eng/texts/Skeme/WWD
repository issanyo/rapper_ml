[Verse 1 : B Mac]
Last night we had a party at the crib
And I know how I got home, somebody tell we what I did
But shit it's Saturday and what matters today
Is we gon' do it one more again
I call my homies and my gang
I tell my girls, tell their friends
We gon' make a movie, you choosey
So what it doey
A bunch of cuties
And floozies come by the doozies
But who am I to turn it down ?
(I just the best rapper in the world)
(The rest of these hoes be clown)
I wanna see everybody in here boucin'
If not it's better that you bounce
It's dollar signs in here, left to right
And this pocket money just countin'
God damn that's millions on top of billions
Weak niggas I ain't not feelin' them
Laughin' but I am not killing 'em
Y'all selling 'em [?]
Oh y'all pop champagne
[?]
Just don't swerve in my lane
Oh no! Tonight we gettin' to you
That's on me and mines dude
Advise you to not come around if you you turn it


[Hook : B Mac]
See this is how we do it
I call my girls, you call your boys and let's get to it
We smoke this smoke and drink that drinkin' and now we into it
It's who we are the only question is what we doin' ?
Hey what we doin' ?
See this is how we do it
I call my girls, you call your boys and let's get to it
We smoke this smoke and drink that drinkin' and now we into it
It's who we are the only question is what we doin' ?
Hey what we doin' ?


[Verse 2 : Skeme]
Fuck all these rappin' niggas
Catch me in traffic nigga
I ain't no actin' nigga, This here be a actin' nigga
With you she be mild man and
With me she get ratchet nigga
I'm more a team player
Hit that bitch then pass it nigga
I got it don't panic nigga
Hammers for static nigga
Ridin' that european and the roof panoramic nigga
Drivin' my hoes [?] but I'm strapped with that cannon nigga
No I'm gon' show my [?] until the government ban it nigga
Millions to sign a nigga, Must I remind a nigga
The rap don't pay enough to cover loss for designers nigga
No benihana's nigga I rather Kortana's nigga
Rolly the presidential that right there that Obama nigga
We bomb like Ossamas niggas
You best stay from round us nigga
How you claim that you on but
Your account got no commas nigga
My homies piranhas nigga
That's on my momma nigga
[?]
