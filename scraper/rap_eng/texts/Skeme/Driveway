[Intro: DJ Drama]
You know we ain't creating the highway
We just made a new lane
Follow us....

[Verse 1: Skeme]
The rap game, ain't the trap man
No stressin', I'm relaxed man
I've been walking with this world on my shoulders
Still no complaint,[??] bout a back pain
I stayed true, where my profit at
[??] where they find me at
No sleep, young insomniac
It ain't a M on the table, we ain't signing that (Whoooo)
I bought a pint, you know I had to sip
Real nigga trill 'til the casket dip
You could tell that I'm a rebel from the bezel
25 and still alive, where we from that's something special
Crooked crowns for the kings of the underground
Practice patience, everything that goes come around
Money counters counting by the hundred thou's
You ain't speaking on progression
Fuck we talkin' 'bout....

[Hook: Skeme]
What I say, goes [??] like my way
Papers got these haters lookin' sideways
Eyes wide shut on this highway
I'm throwed trying to make it in my driveway
Eyes wide shut on this highway
Praying that I make in my driveway
Jus' praying that I make it (oohh)
I'm praying that I make it (aayyhh)

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Young crooked, sophisticated
Presi rollie, I bought it just to remind me I made it
I'm up bright and early, after working the late shift
Money counter going (gunshot adlib),like I let off a K-clip
I tell all of my hoes, get low as a basement
Then I put that pound on her, dick feel like a basskick
Catch your rhythm in it, I'm talking boom boom clap
This your bloodcot [?]
[?]
S-K
Get it how you want it, press play
And when I pray I only ask him let me see the next day
(Aayy)
I could handle the rest
If life a bitch, young crooked got his hand up her dress..blessed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Hard thuggin', no budgin'
Big check, no budgets
I live fast and pass on past judgement
I don't only like it, nigga I fuckin' love it
I am raw, rough, and rugged when addressing the mass public
My attitude be fuck it, cause muthafuckas love it
All dude talk is cash and he ain't swtchin' the subject
So get a good look at him, that's everything that you wasn't
I be I-N-G-L-E, ain't shit ya'll could tell me
Full clips won't buy all that bullshit you sell me
Crooked bars stunt, while they nickel and dime
They could have whatever left
Bitch the world is mine

[Hook]
