Free all the dawgs

For my niggas I been missin too much

[Verse 1]
Ain't no more free baby dot
They don let dot out (thats my dawg)
As soon as he got out
They locked up my lil' niggas munchkin
And hop out

Man that shit is brazy for real
I swear to god it get too brazy
These streets cold, man they froze
I swear them corners be shady like
Damn

They trying to gather the fam
But really the fam ain't gave no fucks
We just keep countin that guap
Rockin VVs, stayin doped up
Yee ain't even gatta ask if we touchn' cash
Thats a sho-nuff

Sound like we the last of the trill niggas stayin throwed
And pourn' up
Play with the rack like im Venus
Play with the rack like Sarena
This K on me, straight outta Russia
That car pull up, European
Young nigga made it out the slums
Man that nigga a genius
This codeine im sippin'
Got a nigga wide awake and I'm dreamn'
Screamin

[Chorus]
Free all the dawgs

Man free all the dawgs

Man free all the dawgs

Free all of the dawgs

I pour one cup, then two cups
For my niggas I been missin too much
(Shit forever, Shit was crazy, real crazy)

I pour one cup, then two cups
For my niggas I been missin too much

[Verse 2]
I been used to aming through a tech
Screamin', free the real and keep the rest
Neck and my wrist flooded out, VVS

I been used to aming through a tech
Screamin', free the real and keep the rest
Any pussy nigga, get respect or meet the tech
Im 808 on the block
Bitch I got paid on the block
You couldn't even play on the block
Your mama said, stay off the block
Lil nigga move like a bop
He fuck around with them shots
Can fuck with him, he a op
He holdn convo with the cops
(He's a rat, Damn)

Im a go down as a legend
I get to high to be stressn'
Water right on me gon fall to the floor
Watch where you step'n
Im a go down as a legend
I buy that 1 liter, pour me a seven
I just hop outta that foreign as fresh as whoever
Grip'n my muhfuckin weapon

[Chorus]
Free all the dawgs
Free all the dawgs
I got real all behind the wall man
Free all the dawgs

Free all the fam

I got real all niggas thats inside the can man
Free all the fam

Man free all the dawgs
