[Hook]
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Now I need all thirty-six O's out the whole thing
My watch be telling me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Wake up in the morning feeling like we don't deserve this
Once we get it started, ain't no way you could reverse this
We do this for real, it ain't no way to rehearse this
You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch

[Verse 1: Skeme]
I used to flip them things and get that change up out 'em
Young nigga done got that change
But ain't shit changed about him
I put my neck down on the line, got twenty chains around it
You ain't talking 'bout no money, we don't hear about it
Tell all your niggas we don't need the convo
I'm a have twenty hoes twerk at the condo
I been riding since the summer of '87
Crazy thing, I wasn't born till the '9 0
All of them years we was broke what I shine for
Got me separating zeros like grind for
I break a nine out the motherfucking brick with my eyes closed

[Hook]
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Now I need all thirty-six O's out the whole thing
My watch be telling me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Wake up in the morning feeling like we don't deserve this
Once we get it started, ain't no way you could reverse this
We do this for real, it ain't no way to rehearse this
You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Snitches get stitches
I feel like you niggas some fakes and some bitches
These niggas willl tell on they partners
Just hoping the judge give a break on the sentence
Hand on the wheel, I just handle my business
And I wish Dolla Bill was living to witness
The way this lil nigga done round up them digits
Man, I got that gift like it came with ribbon
I tell these liberty bitches that I ain't switching
'Less we talking 'bout switching positions
I turn the wood to the world for my niggas
I hope that shit did make a difference
They dodge a homie cause of codeine I'm sipping
These glasses, homie, gave me Cartier vision
They hating on me, faking on me, but still I ain't tripping

[Hook]
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Now I need all thirty-six O's out the whole thing
My watch be telling me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Wake up in the morning feeling like we don't deserve this
Once we get it started, ain't no way you could reverse this
We do this for real, it ain't no way to rehearse this
You play 'round with mine, I fuck around and get you murked, bitch

[Bridge]
I turn the wood to the world for my niggas
I turn the wood to the world for my niggas
I turn the wood to the world for my
Hope that shit did make a difference

[Hook]
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Now I need all thirty-six O's out the whole thing
My watch be telling me I ain't got time to play with hoes, man
All I ever wanted was some Jordans and a gold chain
Wake up in the morning feeling like we don't deserve this
