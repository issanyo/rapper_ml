[Intro]
Got any drugs or weapons on you?
You niggas, you ain't shit!
Scared now
I like that
Look

[Verse 1: TI]
Murder shoot retaliation: that's all we know
E'ry week another altercation: we trained to go
No retreat and no intimidation: incredible
Instead of full clips I tote revolver
On my mission cause whenever they say miss' in a case it be hard to solve em
Take no shit and I put that shit on my father
I'm turnt to the max ain't no adjustin' my volume
And here's a little message for the robbers: (gunshot)
AY!

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Straight out the set
Where K rounds get sprayed out and lay down ya set
'Less you pressin' yo issue then fuck you lil' pussies and fuck what you rap
I need it all cash no checks I bet de' niggas won'drin what coming next
Pull up in foreign that FN is showing you pussies is already knowing
I fly like [?] he got more heart than Owen
The niggas that's with him is riddin' the bitches that's with me be geeked up and rollin'
Came in with TIP and them niggas with three-quarters worth of a clip for these niggas
So know if it go to them cannons when I let it off ain't no chance of it jammin'

[Verse 3: TI]
Ay
Bet know that I'm strapped when you see me pull up at the light
Mac 10 in my lap and the Carbon 15 to the right
Being polite
50 round drum put this shit in ya life
The end of ya life will begin in tonight
Go to hell take you a friend if you like
?
Promise I'm worth every bit of the hype
See yo shit what pussy ass niggas recite when they partner step up to go get in the fight
Then go get they ass whoop get they chain and shit took
Sucker can call me e'r name in the book but I bet I ain't broke
And I bet I ain't takin no shit from no nigga on sight Imma go (Imma go)
Never no question on how Imma handle it on sight Imma go (nigga go)
Come with the hammers and just get to blammin' on sight Imma go (nigga go)
Nigga bes' miss me with all a that hoe shit on sight Imma go (nigga go)
Play with me 'n' the homie get wrong if you want just know Imma go

[Verse 4: Skeme]
I'on' fuck wit none of these niggas cause I ain't run the bands up with these niggas and I
? None of these bitches cause when the money come I ain't even stuntin these bitches and I
Don't say no to drugs cause a nigga too busy yellin' hell yeah fuckin right
Yep yep bes' bet be the crookedest chef in the kitchen nigga we ain't cookin nothin light
Me and CIRE just talkin shit the other night sayin' that these niggas can't fuck with what I was on
I be in the mirror like all of this designer shit I'm wearin' ain't right unless I got the gun on
Pockets heavy let me get my Big Pun on
Laughin at these niggas who be sided with fun on
Beat stupid let the flow go dumb on
My bitch twin from the tub get a Rev Run on
I had to hustle from the trenches with mine
They prolly wonder how much time was spent on them rhymes
They think I'm writing I'm just such doing, nigga to the exit you a quarter threw ya bus and now I'm finished with mine
I really got hits lil nigga, I'm really bout as big as it gets lil nigga, so
Don't sweat lil nigga all that actin like a hood 'll get you chipped lil nigga
