[Hook: Skeme]
We don't show no love to these bops
Niggas playin too much gon' hear the shots
VVS grade floodin out the watch
Young niggas do it all for the guap
All for the guap
Young niggas do it all for the guap
Slide out, middle fingers for the cops
Young niggas do it all for the guap

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
When it's JuneOnnaBeat, they be playin it back
I just told Davo to make me slap
The hook up outta gucci clutch, we takin it back
I'm finna utilize the dough to pay for a bag
I just got a (?) on me, I just came from the trap
You ain't ever rolled around with a K in ya lap
DM from your BM, makin it clap
Ain't no way I'm finna turn down no haitian in black
(?)
