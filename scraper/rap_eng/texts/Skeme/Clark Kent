[Verse 1: Reason]
Look, niggas spendin' money just to get they feel on
I don't spend a dime (dime), but I look like a million
That pussy, you been fiendin' for, that's my old lady (lady)
I don't pay her no mind, but I make sure she pay me (ha)
No savin', I strap up bitch, no babies
Take that morning-after early, bitch don't tell me you belated
Got two bitches named Mercedes and Alexis, this shit crazy
'Cause Mercedes drive a Lexus and Alexis drive a Mercedes
Look my main bitch, my side bitch 'cause my main bitch ain't fuckin with me
I ain't trippin', I ain't never cuffin', if she want me back, she can come and get me
My weed purple, my money green, tell a bitch that I'm runnin' things
Got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one, I be mockin' Jay like the Hunger Games

[Chorus: Reason]
Bitch I ain’t never savin' (savin'), 'cause bitch I ain’t no hero
I said I ain’t never savin' (savin'), 'cause bitch I ain’t no hero
Look it’s money over bitches (bitches), that’s just how it goes
So much money in my savings, I ain’t got no room for hoes (ha)
Had to tell a bitch I ain’t Clark Kent (Clark Kent)
Had to tell a bitch I ain’t Clark Kent (ha)
No S up on my chest so I ain’t Clark Kent (ha)
No S up on my chest so I ain’t Clark Kent

[Verse 2: Skeme]
I got a S on my ring (woah), but ain't got no S on my chest (woah)
I'ma just fuck it and duck her, I tell this bitch that I treat her just like the next (right)
There's too many fish in the sea (right), there's too many bitches on me (woah)
I been down from Day 1, I ain't switchin' until I hear Swizz on the beat
Hop in that booth and go Clark Kent, pull up in Benzs with dark tint
All of my niggas get money like honey, a hunnid K, that's what we all spent
That money bag, I'm runnin' off with, I'm in Miami, no Dolphins
Everytime that I'm speakin', it feels like preachin'
I feel like I'm rappin' Yung Dolf, shit (preach)
But this is the [?]
Cookin' and robbin' with the Cajuns
Nigga, I'm boutta go buy a redbone
Keep her mouth closed when my case open
You ain't sayin' nothin', I was fuckin' thuggin'
When you fuckin' wasn't, you's a double dutchin'
You's a pussy nigga and I know it, know it
Got my hammer showin', I'ma blow it, blow it

[Chorus: Reason]
Look I ain’t never savin' (savin'), 'cause bitch I ain’t no hero
I said I ain’t never savin' (savin'), 'cause bitch I ain’t no hero
Look it’s money over bitches (bitches), that’s just how it goes
So much money in my savings, I ain’t got no room for hoes (ha)
Had to tell a bitch I ain’t Clark Kent (Clark Kent)
Had to tell a bitch I ain’t Clark Kent (ha)
No S up on my chest so I ain’t Clark Kent (ha)
No S up on my chest so I ain’t Clark Kent

[Verse 3: Reason]
Look, I love pussy but hate hoes, to fuck bitches, I don't give 'em nothin'
But good dick till they satisfied, because I've been back in like they stomach
Focused on gettin' new money, to fuck bitches, I don't give 'em nothin'
'Cause new money, get me new pussy, and old pussy I've been one
New whip, got a slick body, more curves than a big woman
And my new bitch got a slick body, curves on her with a thin stomach (ha)
Chain reaction, you get money and these hoes follow (hoes follow)
Gotta bitch named Champagne from these gold bottles
Generation fucked up, all these hoes swallow
What you expect, when the Kardashians is role models?
She gon' give me head and it's gon' feel amazin'
No S on my chest, I ain't never savin' (Reason)

[Chorus: Reason]
Look I ain’t never savin' (savin'), 'cause bitch I ain’t no hero
I said I ain’t never savin' (savin'), cause bitch I ain’t no hero
Look it’s money over bitches (bitches), that’s just how it goes
So much money in my savings, I ain’t got no room for hoes (ha)
Had to tell a bitch, I ain’t Clark Kent (Clark Kent)
Had to tell a bitch, I ain’t Clark Kent (ha)
No S up on my chest so I ain’t Clark Kent (ha)
No S up on my chest so I ain’t Clark Kent (Clark Kent, Clark Kent)

[Outro: Reason]
No S up on my chest so I ain’t Clark Kent (Clark Kent, Clark Kent)
So much money in my savings, I ain’t got no room for hoes, ha
