[Intro]
It ain't always alright
Fuck is doin' alright anyway? Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm a let you get it how you living
Bitches ain't shit, you know a nigga pimpin'
In conversation, all we talk about is business
Bunch of young niggas winning
Niggas knowing I been on the same tip from the beginning
Took some losses and now we winning
Fuck nigga, let me tell you how I'm feeling
You ain't seen a rapper like me in a minute
Do what I want and never ask for no permission
Respect a nigga vision and ask a lot of shit what finna happen
Now look, everything I spoke come into fruition

[Hook]
All I ever wanted was peace of mind
Still it's always they want a piece of mine
Feeling like it's all moving too quick
In a fast lane flying, I need some time
I done came way too far to quit
And I done been down too long to switch
I done kept it G since day one
Niggas know we was made for all this shit

It's clear to see that I was made for it
It's clear to see that I was made for it
See all the dues, I done paid for it
It's clear to see that I was made for it
It's clear to see that I was made for it
I was made for it

[Verse 2]
Been a little minute but I'm still tippin'
Used to handle business with the white bitch
Ay, look at me and look at you
Shit different, what I am is what you not, nig
Know you worth exactly what they pay you
Knowing every rapper can't fade you
Spent a little time in the streets with your peers
When you know that they're, they're what made you
Slow motion making everything look better
Know the world's your's, where you left at?
Punk-ass pigs want a nigga locked down
And a [??] judge want to throw the Blood gang
Rappers can't copy a G, stop me and knock me
I'm popping them shots at your tee
How much a problem could these niggas possibly be
This ain't nothing, I'm straight out the streets

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm just riding slow with my partner
Ducking low from them coppers
What y'all laid ain't never made me shit
So what y'all on ain't my problem
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, slow motion, slow motion

Now, I've been real from that dough
Still poured on my fo'
Stayed down, I'm on H-Town
Everything around me's slow
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, slow motion, slow motion

[Hook]
