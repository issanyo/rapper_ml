[Verse 1]
Just another day in the life of crooked
Gotta do it big cause I know them haters lookin'
I'm doin' mines, on my grind show-bookin'
Kitchen smellin' good keep a bad bitch cookin'
Ha - This is life as a YG
Cash rules, that's the only thing that I see
Keep nothin' but them real niggas by me
Levi's, white tees, swear that's all a nigga needs
Yeah, can't forget that good weed
Now my eyes red, work to my high heads
I talk to 'em, but can't tell you what God said
Never you mind, just listen to this and nod head
Yeah, in it to win it like Bennett bitch
Fuck ho niggas, no time for censorship
If I feel the need to say it then it's said
I live to see these lame niggas dead
Get bread like -

[Hook]
Don't lose focus
Just keep on rollin'
Go 'head twist that, light that, blow that
Keep on smokin'
See I done been here and back before
So I'm already knowin'
Go 'head twist that, light that, blow that
Keep on smokin'
(Just keep on smokin')

[Verse 2]
Can't stand the rain against my window
Good kush got the youngin' breathin' in slow
Better yet, homie, everything is in slow -
Motion nigga, I'm focused, nigga
It's a pistol near by me if I'm posted, nigga
You could try me if you want - Get toasted, nigga
We get cash on the daily, act like you're all ready
OT I pack light, bitch, ball heavy
Been here, and I keep it real, is y'all ready?
I think not, nigga everything I ink hot
Money money over y'all, that's the mindstate
Get it nine ways, livin' proof that crime pays
On to the road to the riches with diamonds and bitches
Think with that head that's on your shoulders, not in your britches
And keep it real 'till the reaper come pay you a visit
Keep it one-hundred get this money my nigga what is it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga, you know what this is, that bang-bang shoot 'em up
G's hold your Rugers up, fuck is they gon' do with us
Bitches pullin' skirts down just cause niggas movin' up
Hater pull a false move, have his family suited up
Put them hands on him 'till he sway, seein' two of us
Then it's back to baggies, for rollin' and lightin' doobies up
Niggas learn to run their mouth until the toolie buck
You don't wanna play enemy in my mobster movie, bruh
Pourin' out my liquor for niggas no longer present
Purple by the 7's on a stairway up to heaven
Figa life is like a blessing but the little shit be stressin'
Like how is it these niggas don't vision me as the best, when -
I give you what you need, and what you want
Stuntin' for my fam, I know these other niggas won't
What they don't, nigga, that's just what I does
If you hate then bust a shot, if not, then show some love, what's up

[Hook]
