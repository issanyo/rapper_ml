[Hook]
I got the money, blue hunneds, my bros say the same shit
I got this new 40 on me, today I'ma bang with it
I put these bands on slow mo whenever I lane switch
And all of these niggas is thuggin' and boys who I came wit
I be with killers and dealers you know who we came wit
(You know who we came wit nigga)
All of my niggas the realest, you know who I came wit
(You know who I came wit nigga)
You niggas ain't talkin' bout money, ain't speakin' my language
(Nah I can't understand)
We pull out that ladder and take whatever you done came with


[Verse 1]
I keep my mind on my riches
And don't give my mind to these bitches
They just wanna talk bout they feelings
A nigga like me ain't even got time to listen
It's time for yo conversation
A young nigga want conversation
When it come down to that paper
I don't do no way and I get to inflation, nigga
My dollars come in a hurry up
The talk that you doing don't worry us
All of your niggas is borrowers
All of my niggas is warriors
This 40 on me get to sparking up
Who you don't know what you started bruh
We do not do all that talking ain't no way to park it
After we just started a war
I'm on that mud, I got a plug
Middle fingers, fuck a judge
Put that on blush, the quicker the thug
You ridin' Shawty with a slug
No ain't no love, I got no heart in my chest
I don't fuck with you niggas
Otherwise, I'ma be pluggin' you niggas
Pull out these hammers then buck on you niggas
Soon as I step in the office, we put them nails in the coffin
Y'all niggas die by that that money
Put hands on the hunneds, I love 'em some paw prints
Bitch, I'm a god with the flow
We just out here lookin' for offering
You see me with a Noah, I put that D up in it
I give a fuck bout what you offer


[Hook]
I got the money, blue hunneds, my bros say the same shit
I got this new 40 on me, today I'ma bang with it
I put these bands on slow mo whenever I lane switch
And all of these niggas is thuggin' and boys who I came wit
I be with killers and dealers you know who we came wit
(You know who we came wit nigga)
All of my niggas the realest, you know who I came wit
(You know who I came wit nigga)
You niggas ain't talkin' bout money, ain't speakin' my language
We pull out that ladder and take whatever you done came with

[Verse 2]
I'm I-N-G-L-E, ain't shit you could tell me
And I put that dare on my ready
Few rings on my hand I don't wear Makaveli
I'm feeling thuggish like I'm buns and belly
Still I'm sincere with this here
Put that 44 while you here
And I wish we lost the stylish shorter
Niggas talking shit and we get violent on them
Pull that dick out she be ridin' on it
She be wildin' on it, she go island on it
Talking fashion on the flyest homie I go pilot on them
Ain't no stylish form
Counting paper that I'm piling on
That shit talking paper I get silent on
Foreign Features bitch I 'm riding on them
I get high as heaven we just ballin' on them
Still be trillest ,hard to stay up
Talking blessin bitch I'm way up
I really live what I'm rapping my nigga
Ain't none of these lyrics been made up
That money in fact what we made from
That where we put up them cash from
You fuck is you smoking that boy get so wet
In the ocean I all get your wave up
S to the K to the E bitch
Ain't no rapper real as me bitch
Trappin' or rappin' we so bout that action
You know that I got what you need, bitch
I'm balling no time for no injury reserve
Aim from the top though I came from the curve
All of the hustle if it wasn't reimbursed
Put my dick in your ear nigga fuck what you heard


[Hook]
I got the money, blue hunneds, my bros say the same shit

I be with killers and dealers you know who we came wit
(You know who we came wit nigga)
All of my niggas the realest, you know who I came wit
