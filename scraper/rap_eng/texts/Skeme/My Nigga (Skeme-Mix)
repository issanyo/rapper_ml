You know that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin niggas
Lord know I'm down to die for my motherfuckin niggas
I'mma draw the line just so niggas get the picture
If niggas out of line then them pussies dyin' with you
First thing's first, I'm a Inglewood native
Seem like it sound better every time a nigga say it
Me, I handle business, questions aks what do you do?
I be on my money over bitches, word to suwoop
Introduce yo wifey to the gang and run a choo-choo
My adlib even cost, bands for the woo woo
Your pockets on featherweight, mine's on heavyweight
I got new in 0 hunnits, nigga I'm forever straight
And you niggas was never great, say that in whoever face
I don't fear nothing except ending up in 2nd place
These niggas be lying to you, I'mma set the records straight
My motion like chess moves, miss me with the checker play
You on mind stressin, nigga mad shit what you better play
Fuck a hater, I get paper, get this shit whichever way
I can make it rain, I make Mr. Prankme levitate
That get pussy wet, I mean so wet it make her levy break
So it ain't no questions bout it, I'mma make it clear
Behind one of mine, make a nigga disappear
And I ain't repeatin shit, so pussy nigga listen here
Think I'm finna rap, let me get my shit in gear
Pull up down the set, look
Got it on deck, you playin with me you get wet
Nigga we know who the best, if you think that you better stop placin yo bets
I get that flow on a string like a yoyo
I'm strapped with that 44, the 4 when I pop off
Po up like 4 hoes, my homies smoke dodo
I'm out here in London, we chasin the solo
My nigga I'm crazy, you play with the pimps
Said that we done gone loco, I just bought a ocho
My homies bankroll, I'm sippin that soso
I'm ducked to the bullshit, it's right here the soso
Kick it like thugs are my youngin, thugs are my youngin
Flaw me next til like Quan my youngin
Then every second that shit be so good
If you notice you can't beat the genre my youngin, for real
I don't feel these niggas
I hit yo bitch throat, you give, you still kissin
If I dies tonight I'm gon die a trill nigga
Just reserve me a spot next to Dolla Bill nigga
That's for real, yea
I do that for real, yea
And every beat I touch get
I say that's for real
That Ingleworld on the way bitch

YG what up  nigga?
Mustard what's happenin?
Rich Homie think I need 2 hooks, push it anyway
