[Verse 1: Skeme]
Kilo wrapped 'round my neck
Wanted 'round for a check
Hundred bets nigga bet
Money, power and respect
Model bitches with me wet
Fuck her 'till she out of breath
New niggas thinking you gangsta
I fuck around and buy ya set
Still ballin' ain't shit changed
Sitting court side at a Knick game
Did the right thing no Spike Lee
You don't know another nigga like me
THUG-E-S-T to the sight
Cartier cover my eyes
They wanna know what the fuck else could I want
That revenue be my reply

[Hook]
They don't even make 'em like me now days
They don't even make 'em like me now days
I done lost count of all the money I make
They don't even make 'em like me nowdays nigga
They don't even make 'em like me now days
They don't even make 'em like me now days
Bought a new coupe, had to tell a bad bitch with me work
They don't even make 'em like me now days (work)

[Verse 2: Skeme]
BVSs on my wrist
Crooked, too legit to quit
High as a sky scraper screaming, "Hi, haters" crack a seal pint and sip
Hope you niggas ain't forget
I'm the nigga with the hits
Ball on these niggas and bitches I feel like Michael Jordan back in '96 (ball out)
Call me Skeme, call me crooked, call me anything that you want to but broke
Stuntin' homie, money on me looking like I’m meeting papi at the boat
Type of shit that make them alphabet boys look at you like you still selling dope
Its billions of niggas out here in these streets and still I’m the realist you know
