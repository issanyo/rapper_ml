[Hook]
Look what I did
Look how I'm stunting, man, look where I live
Look what I did
Rollie on, that's with no tock and no tick
Look what I did
Came up from nothing, we 'bout to get rich
Look what I did
Only the real get to get it like this

Look what I did, look what I did
Yeah, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Yeah, look what I did
Look what I did, ran up and check my PG ain't switch
Look what I did, I done came up
My niggas gon' leave with your bitch
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Look what I've done
Put my city on my projects right where I'm from
Get what I want
The money alright, here we do what you don't
Look how I maneuver
I ride with subwoofers and full in rugers
Got chauffeurs, no Ubers
And shout out my jewelers, I'm balling on niggas, no (?)
Uh, every bitch with me in trouble
You getting money, I got the solution
Right, four up or blow up, my nigga
You know that them boys don't be pouring no (?)
Uh, boy, you's a pussy
I don't know why you keep that pistol if you ain't gon' shoot it
Uh, all of these niggas be thugging on Internet
Bet them pussies won't come do it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm going on a misison
They coming back with kilo grands that we whip in the kitchens
Multiplication, addition, ain't no subtraction divison
You try me, I'm out your division, I'm killing you
Ain't never my little gun ought to (?) you
I don't care if I'm offending you
I'll put my rifle to the chin of you
I'll kill you before you'd begin to do shit
That would cause me to kill you eventually
I would rather say time is (?) to me
Shoot a witness, now don't you go mentioning me
I'm on another level you'll never be
So don't compromise my integrity
Due respect, you would get chip of the top of the shot
Put it in a pine box dead, here from the cops, nigga

[Hook]
