Yeah bitch
Ain't goin wit none of dat
No games
Put the quick flow out on em!

[Hook: Skeme]
What up bitch, what up hoe
These haters worried bout the kid, bitch I know
What up bitch, what up hoe
That pillow-talking that she doing gotta go (hol' on)
Like shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe
Shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe
Shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe
Shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe (shhhhhhh)

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Keep quiet (keep quiet)
I don't really wanna hear no talking
Gotta run to the money, no jogging
Lean got me with the limp when I'm walking
Dead presidents tucked in my pocket
Had to dig them hoes up out the coffin
Got a big boy chain on my neck right now, you don't even wanna know what it cost me
Still drink on drink no (?)
Still on that gangster shit with no police
Still got that banger on me, use caution
Bitch I'm a bang this shit with no arguing
And I'm so wavy bitches gettin nauseous
Lil Uzi rockstar, bitch I'm awesome
And I'm a greedy nigga, I need more than my portion
Pull up in Lambos and Rari's and Porsches

What up bitch, what up hoe
These haters worried bout the kid, bitch I know
What up bitch, what up hoe
That pillow-talking that she doing gotta go (hol' on)
Like shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe
Shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe
Shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe
Shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe (shhhhhhh)

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Bitch Ima po' po' leave the diamonds showin
Saint laurent sagging with the pistol pokin
Twenty chains swinging, got my neck glowing
Faucet drippin on me with the water flowing
Ima savage and these niggas know it
If they ain't informed nigga now you know it
My whole closet foreign, got my shit imported
You don't sit in the 'vent cuz you ain't important nigga
Sip the potent potion, still I indulge in it
I can't think of sleep when there's more dough to go get
I stretch it flip real, stretch it flip real, stretch it flip it
Make the work do aerobics
I don't do no hoe shit, the hood (?)
That G shit ain't nuthin, you can die how you want
You niggas say you was on, I need proof cuz if that was the truth how the fuck we ain't notice (ahhhhh)

Shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe
Shut up bitch, shut up bitch, shut up hoe (shhhhhhh)
