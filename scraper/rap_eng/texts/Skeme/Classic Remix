[Verse One: Paypa]
Aye yo it’s Payp baby, valedictorian of this rap shit
I school niggas, you class clown, I’m classic
Love, peace and soul, I was trained to never fold
Don Cornelius the way I’m killing off the dome, I promise
That boy Paypa’s cut from a different fabric
I got a full house, I’m feeling like Bob Saget
You know you in your lane when them legends call your phone
And they hopping on your songs, got you feeling like you on
Emilio, I got you, them haters throwing stones
Let’s give ‘em something to rock to, paint the whole block blue
Call it coalition, my crew rocking like U2, the black Bono
Hustle mano a mano, classic like my black Reeboks in 8th grade
Classic like Caprice, I cut him short like capris for fucking with the crew
Nigga R-I-P, get a mask like Hamilton, step back and handle him, Paypa

[Verse Two: Phil Ade]
Bitches get around me and let they hair fall
So unless it’s about money, I don’t hear calls
We on friendship pikes, we don’t get near malls
You niggas have your shot, we yelling air ball
I’m a fucking asshole, won’t settle for less than great
I’m my state’s last hope, addicted to fast dough
Spitting the rap flows, these hoes drunk with love
I tell ‘em my tab closed, my heart stone, you can quit
Trying to figure me, speak up bad now, wait till you see a bigger me
Swagging on everybody that swagged on me
Yelling fuck you if you ain’t loyal fam by me
Man, fuck a Visa, all cash on me and I’m up in Stadium
It’s all ass on me, listening to Rah Gwan off of Dom P
And I’m probably with a car like my name was Don C, P

[Verse Three: Skeme]
Spirit of a fighter, got the heart of a rider
Niggas wanna play to win, never been about them games
Tell her to pour me a cup, tell that ho to fuck
But I get a nut just because the bitch know my name
Got a cup full of Texas, mouth full of Cali
Get my jays before they drop and walk around my house in Bally’s
Got some killers in New York, riding with the hump
Watch how you speaking ‘fore these wreakers have you outlined in chalk
I been doing my shit, know I’m on my tip
Goat nigga, treat her like a handle bar and get a grip
I’m from where it’s going down, you know bloods and the crips
Throwing up that dollar sign straight, no split
S-O-X the game bitch, never on no lame shit
Never talk to lame hoes ‘cause they don’t speak my language
Most these rappers ain’t shit but you know I ain’t trip
‘Cause they never test the gangster bitch, I told her that my aim sick
Fuck a hater with a homo dick and two’s better than one
So now I’m only hitting homo chicks, homie sick
Polo drawers on me, she get Polo dick, hold the clip
See the flash like a fucking photo strip, four to spit
Leaving niggas ducking, screaming holy shit
Murder scene tragic, I’m mafia movie classic

[Verse Four: Emilio Rojas]
I ain’t into no fast, frivolous with my cash, ain’t cheap though
This week alone, I just spent your rent on cabs, ride around in the back
I’m with a girl who steady bobbing and it look like I be dolo
‘Cause she low though, steady slobbing, I’m a classic, I’m in Polo
Jays got Nike logos, women in the back of the photos
Then I’mma get ‘em in the lap when I stroke those
So my flow is a no-so and your flow is all so so-so
If you ask me how I know so, I’mma laugh at you like bozo
Got a low pro and them hoes don’t come around at get togethers
As soon as Summer hit, I tell my bitch it’s mistress weather
Them chicks don’t get to spend a fucking night, they get a day pad
They mad, I look ‘em in the eye and tell ‘em they bad
Laid back in my crib, stay stacking my chips, my white friends
They get tight then ‘cause they mad I’m a spic
And they mad I’m the shit and I’mma get it on my own
Stacking paper like a high interest loan but baby, I’m a classic
