[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
I know I got a problem
I know my money doin' Benihana's
I know I left a trail of smoke from smashin' in the Masi
I know I drink a pint a day, but shit that's not your problem
Shit I know I got a problem
I know I got a problem
I know my money doin' Benihana's
I know I left a trail of smoke from smashin' in the Masi
I know I drink a pint a day, but shit that's not your problem
Shit I know I got a problem

[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
I know I got a problem
I know my money doin Behinaha's
I know I tossed a bottle out the way 'cause it was Qually
I know it's five bands, but in twenties it's a lot of it
Nigga stop stalking me, your baby mama calling me
Think she hit the lottery, bitch I sold a lot of dreams
Thirty-two shots, if he dream about robbin' me
Bitch I been a star, let me teach you some astrology
Zoom zoom, Masi keys, now she Harry Potterin'
Bitch, I need all my uchies
Benjamin Franklin can be my only groupies
Equipped with the kit for these niggas tryna clone me
Judas's get hung, and these snakes get to stoning
The rudest, the Ruler, shit I think they know that
From stock MSMK's to knockin at niggas' doormats
The rudest, the Ruler, shit I think they know that
From stock MSMK's to knockin at niggas' doormats

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
I know I got a problem
I know my money doin' Benihana's
I know I left a trail of smoke from smashin' in the Masi
I know I drink a pint a day, but shit that's not your problem
Shit I know I got a problem
I know I got a problem
I know my money doin' Benihana's
I know I left a trail of smoke from smashin' in the Masi
I know I drink a pint a day, but shit that's not your problem
Shit I know I got a problem

[Verse 2: Skeme]
I know I got a problem
I know I got rich nigga issues
And I keep a military issue for this pistol
I know these rappers fraud, that fa√ßade, I see clear through
And I'm in that Euro with these haters in my rearview
I know I'm a G and all my riders with the shits too
Big dog shit, girl your man's just a shih tzu
Trill, gold grill, VVS's in my tip too
Play with me you and whoever with you getting chipped too
Play a beat for me, bet I slay that shit
Snub shotty in the Masi, bet I spray that shit
Get your address, pull up, then AK that shit
You don't know me, you just know my AKA, that's it
We ain't homies, I done bust down my Rollie
I'm worth 'bout four mil, I got that on my lonely
I know that these bitches on me, they want me
(Blood, how you know that shit?)
'Cause they told me

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
I know I got a problem
I know my money doin' Benihana's
I know I left a trail of smoke from smashin' in the Masi
I know I drink a pint a day, but shit that's not your problem
Shit I know I got a problem
I know I got a problem
I know my money doin' Benihana's
I know I left a trail of smoke from smashin' in the Masi
I know I drink a pint a day, but shit that's not your problem
Shit I know I got a problem
