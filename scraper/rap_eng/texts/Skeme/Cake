[Hook]
Rich young niggas always
All that really matter is the cake
I could take your bitch any day
Cause she know all that matter is the cake
I want the 10 bottles and the ace
All that really matter is the cake
My shooters get to aimin' at your face
Cause they know all that matter is the cake
All that really matter is the cake
All that really matter is the cake
You ain't chasin' down a check get out the way
All that really matter is the cake


[Verse 1]
All that really matter be the guap boy
Rag tied to the front like a Hot Boy
Game colder than the winter in New York boy
Fly nigga, drop tops when it's hot boy
I used to sell the five dollar rocks boy
Now we be the richest in the spot boy
Pull up in a [?] bussin' shots boy
AK on me you don't wanna hear that chop noise
All they know the boy touchin' knots now
European monster shut the block down
I could give a fuck if niggas hate
Cause all that really matter is the cake

[Verse 2]
All that really matter be the Lucci
That money turn your main bitch into a groupie
Tell these hoes call me Crooked Tarantino, huh
Every club we hit now offer sure we make a movie
Any nigga play I'm sendin' shots through em
Haters talkin' bout me keep my stock boomin
Water all over me got me drippin'
Think I ain't got that 40 on me, you trippin'
Drivin' in the pool [?] that Moet
Poppin' P's on some fly shit and got you hoe wet
Show me where the dough at then show me where mo' at
We with all the bullshit, now act like you don't know that
