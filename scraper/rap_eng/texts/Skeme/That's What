I am a pimp in my own,fucking mine
Tell the bitch to shut the fuck up

And she say she wanna fuck me
Tell that bitch to get in line
All the niggas playing around
Go pushing bodies on my nine

While all niggas trippin them fine

Man, Cause none of these hoes mine
Only bad bitches around me
I ain't fucking none less than dime
Street niggas fucking with me out of strength
Bitch I been plating ,car paint the benz
I am laughing at all the niggas wearing fat chains
Still coming, trod on a rim
I am not counting the money that i spend
I just be running doing like a trackme
I give a fuck about rap bitch
While other niggas catch bodies of bag sleep
