[Intro: Skeme]
When it looked like I was finished
I came back to murder nigga's
Just when it looked like I was finished
I came back to murder nigga's
Just when it looked like I was finished
Fuck, fuck all that playin', let's get back to business
Just when it looked like I was finished
I came back to murder nigga's
Fuck all that playin', let's get back to business
Give me space and watch me work, nigga

[Verse 1: Skeme]
It's lookin' like I'm bout' to make it
Thirty thousand in the first class
This rap shit done started payin'
But we still asking, where that work at
They say you can't take it with ya
Well fuck that, bury me with mine
Word around town, you been hatin'
I know it hurt your eye's when a nigga shine
Tell that bitch I'm one baller nigga
She won't fuck no quarrel nigga
Tell that bitch to quit stallin' nigga
Take one trip and she fallin' nigga
Pussy, paper, and passports
With stamps, what more could I ask for
Middle finger straight at taskforce
We in this bitch with no masks, boy
Left for dead and I'm back, boy
Put my set on your map, boy
When it comes to that cash boy
No minus sign just add, boy
Young nigga straight at ya boy
You got to show me love
They say they get paid, I [?] my account
My statements now you be the judge
I was inspired by drug dealers, so I act the way that they act
Walk around with my racks
Ride around with my strap
I don't wanna fake, say facts, nigga
I was sixteen with a gat, nigga
Bring the heat right where you at, nigga
Got enough offers to make racks, nigga
Same nigga used to shoot the straps
Got a plaque for the rat, that there be fact, nigga
(That what?) That there be fact, nigga
(Say what?) That there be fact, nigga
Let the world know that we in this bitch
After that, tell them it's a wrap, nigga
It's a wrap nigga
