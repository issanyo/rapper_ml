[Verse 1]:
I say motherfucker hater I'm an Inglewood native
Stay from round a broke nigga cause I heard that shit contagious
Rep that S.O.X. until the death
La familia, that's my set
If you ever disrespect, they'll get your head knocked off your neck
Rest in peace to Pimp C, I wish I could resurrect
Just to po' up with you once and politick over some blunts, but
Back to what I'm talking about, ladies if you love me
And your trigger fingers at these lames to shoot to kill for me
Boys to the street, niggas round in my vicinity
Got it right now, you ain't dealing with no finna be
N.A.G.B.G.A.N.G. dollar sign T.A
And these lames gon' have you trapped, just like the hustlers out in G.A., we say

[Hook]:
We don't give a fuck, and we ain't never gave one
I say boy I'm making money, you ain't never made none
We don't give a fuck, and we ain't never gave one
I say boy I'm making money, you ain't never made none

On the grind, Money on my line
But that's all the time
On the grind, Money on my line
But that's all the time
On the grind, Money on my mind
But that's all the time
On the grind, Money on my mind

[Verse 2]:
(Hol' Up) I got pockets full of change (Hol' Up), put that on the gang
I do whatever, whenever, ain't too much shit out my lane (Hol' Up)
Future on my brain (Hol' Up), forward motion gang
And it's some broads I never met that's down to tat a nigga name
I say all I want is that money, bruh
Dollars, euros and yen
I say make that and then spend that, and then do it over again
Been the same nigga from the start mane, all I chase down is my ends
And if you ain't riding that Honda bitch, you won't ride in that Benz
I got new hoes to fake friends, tryna to hang on cause I'm in
But I don't trip cause it ain't shit, and I stay down and won't bend
Homie, this the life that I chose
Better yet this the life that chose me
And I sip in 2 cups, and I'm asleep
Tryna to slow it down and keep it G

[Hook]

Pour some bitch!
Everything slow but the money, right?
Wait!
I got some more shit to throw away

[Verse 3]
Tell that bad bitch, no neck, no sex
Two white cups cause I love cold meth
Fuck with the young nigga, S.O.X
And the T.S.2. what I kept on deck
That's that shit, but please don't trip
Cause the more I sip she's slowing down
They ain't coming up, if they ain't you bet they know it now

[Hook]
