[Verse]
You're now in-tuned with the most underrated niggas in rap
Young SK, El hefe, nigga we back
What you thought? Cause I was gon' for a minute
That I wasn't gon' return and try to strong arm this business
I hopped out that Honda Accord into a Benz-y
Throw bands up off in Sin City and cause the frenzy
Can't lie, Most of the rappers, they move gently
But I still leave one in they head and squeeze till it empty
I lost my mind, Big brother just lost a Bentley
Earned stripes while these other rappers all were sayin' get me
The unofficial fifth member of Black Hippy
Interscope showed me interest but them numbers wasn't jiggy
Oh lord, who you came with?
Never been on no lame shit
Ride for my niggas, You won't?
Then watch your lane switch
Me and Wheeze made this million dollar plan
Dressing like Poorer Rich, Just left from Dapper Dan's
Pure dedication, first class, champagne, elevation
I'm knowing that success bring hella' haters
So we steer clear in them [?]
ING uno, illest nigga that you know
When it come to game, I'm kicking it like judo
I really live the shit I spit knowing that you don't
Still feel the ignorant bliss loading that .24
Don't load it if you won't bang it
Or even worse, Don't aim it if you won't bang it
Whip swangin', I'm the realest nigga in it
S-O-X Army bitch, you're locked in with the lieutenant
9 days, it costs nigga racks for shit i've written
So now I feel like every sentence is big business
Good riddens, am I killing or what?
Bury all these bitch niggas, no digging em' up
I'm posted at number one like the digit was stuck
If I bust, my bitch Nina start lickin' em up
Bop bop, drop your top, no pickin' em up
These lil dickhead niggas is fucked
And this is just the intro
Fuck em' all like a nympho
Wasn't brand nothing, like y'all, just check the info
I am Ingleworld, spinning on this axis
I ball like AI, while y'all was talkin' bout practice mothafuckas
