Yo
The drama bound to stun you before the gun do (blaow)
Better have a spot to run to, stash your bundle
Blue and whites come through, lookouts want us
That's wrong how they had they guns drawn when they run up on us
Hearse I'm under, words dem bug us, it's how they search and slug us
For wearin certain colors on the drug strip
Full of duck chick that love chips
Where I live, you get your mug split
For tryin to stunt and pose, in front of hoes
I leave a dozen froze and they cousin closed when I come in shows
Me and my lows rock Wolverine ?, and Timbos
Everyone in my kin knows, my squadron foul
I run with opportunist problem childs
That like the robbin style, pussies that act hard and smile
You better guard your pals, cause I'm 'arnin you
Informin you, Ali Vegas do what he wanna do
And I'mma rep Queens just like I was born to do
What nigga?

Rhymin is fundamental
Peep the game they put the yung'un into
Sprung off a instrumental, holdin guns inside a rental
Rap is 10% lungs, 90% mental
But what I want-a know is who sent you
To get on quick, rock with the team I was born with
A cash hustle, my whole staff tussle
And leave you with a bullet in your calf muscle
(one more thing) My verses crush you
Bring it to Cardan and A+ too
Cause they think they tough Boo
If it go there, I let my staff rush you
But y'all cats better recognize
Ain't nobody seein Ali Vegas, recordwise
My team, we be on ? Duke, your team is butter new
Top talent critics is sayin Waterloo
Ali have the chickens, sayin what a cure bastard
Urban wolves got the game mastered
And everybody on my team is way past sick
Nigga what?

Like this Jamaica Queens pharoah tale
How my life is parallel to them inmates
Livin inside a narrow cell
The drug lords have shootouts on carousels
I done seen it all
The average baby couldn't breathe or crawl
I was watchin fiends and whores screamin brawl
Outside of convenience stores, y'all can't stand it
Half of the fam split, we lost Tash
Keith Dolla Bill, Uncle Pook Seville, and The Bandit
My music bump, on every avenue, boulevard, and Van Wyck
I have to sell my records with a pamphlet
So y'all cats can get the spot and muscle, to find a hustle
We down to tussle, we'll clown and crush you
Mellowed out, but still a sinner down to bust you
Y'all know the code of the streets
Keep a toast when you sleep
Stick up kids be patrollin the streets
And if you fold on your peeps
Wake up slain with holes in your Jeep
Nigga what?
