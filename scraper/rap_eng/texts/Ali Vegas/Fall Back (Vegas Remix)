[Kiely: Verse 1]
What's up with ya
Calling me like
I'm your girlfriend
When I just met ya
The other night
Boy it's not a good look, for you

[Refrain]
Slow down, let it come
To you, don’t push up
To hard, if you just
Do you, do you
I would, more than like it
Want you, even more
So what are you, speeding for
Be cool, be cool

[Chorus]
You gotta know when to fall back
Maybe somebody will call back
Not tryin’ to act like I'm all that
But I like a challenge
If you make me wanna call you
One day I'm gonna fall through
So my question for you is
Are you up for the challenge?

[Kiely: Verse 2]
You're doing to much
Blowin me up
With all these messages
There's nothing sexy bout that
You haven't given me a chance to get back
Cuz you keep callin'

[Refrain]
Slow down, let it come
To you, dont push up
To hard, if you just
Do you, do you
I would, more than like it
Want you, even more
So what are you, speedin' for
Be cool, be cool

[Chorus]
You gotta know when to fall back
Maybe somebody will call back
Not tryna act like I'm all that
But I like a challenge
If you make me wanna call you
One day I'm gonna fall through
So my question for you is
Are you up for the challenge?

[Ali:]
Were the pro’s and the con’s you was thrown from the start
I don’t Know if its the dope that I’m on
Or how many times I go when the trogen is on
But something got you showing your thong
See the ones that like drawn to the dark
See I pass them the cove and the Quan
Or the show and the Sean
Makes a nose 4 they arm
I’m tha Prince I act Like A PIMP
Or a MACK this chick on a jet
Stay hitting me back tellin’ em listen here scrap
You need to relax
Bro man slow jams and I’m twisting it back
Like a man from the shaw
Theres no holding hands shishcabob
You Know we not a couple so that Mobile plan ain't a blah

[Bridge]
I wouldn't have given you my number
If I didn't want you to call
The first few times were cute
But after that you started to turn me off
Started turnin' me off that's why

[Chorus]
You gotta know when to fall back
Maybe somebody will call back
Not tryna act like I'm all that
But I like a challenge
If you make me wanna call you
One day I'm gonna fall through
So my question for you is
Are you up for the challenge?

You gotta know when to fall back
Maybe somebody will call back
Not tryna act like I'm all that
But I like a challenge
If you make me wanna call you
One day I'm gonna fall through
So my question for you is
Are you up for the challenge?
