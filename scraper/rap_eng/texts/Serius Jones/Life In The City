Life in the city is not very pretty
It seems such a waste of your time

This Serius Jones
And this song right here is for the city
Every city, that's space created for millions of lives to reside
From NY to the Chi
LA to the Bay
ATL, Bricks
Everywhere in between
See we all part of the same thing man
It's a soundtrack to our lives
Feel me
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
Now when you raised in the struggle, the pain and the hustle
Keep you caged in, it's a shame, the game don't love you
But, what other ways we know to raise this dough
Kids with death on they brain, y'all know it's crazy though
Them old ladies know what's going on in that hallway
All day that raw yae moving on Broadway
Fuck what the law say, fours spray in broad day
Just look at the right person the wrong way
They got me stressing at a fast pace
I lean my seat back at tapes and blast the bass
And analyze how our lives get trapped in this place
That ain't safe, for this cheese it's like a rat race
And see, they wanna try to make your back break
Castrate the black fate cause our past was great
But wait, they don't know that make us stronger than ever
We storm through the weather, see sometimes stress could make you better

[Hook]
See we forced into criminal life
And yeah I know I ain't living it right, but God help me (Lord)
See it's the bright lights and busy nights
And when you dealing with that city life, it ain't healthy (nah)
Cause it's always stress on our mind (all the time)
And everybody just stuck in the grind (all the time)
You gotta take it one day at a time
We get drunk and high sometimes cause you need that

[Verse 2]
It make it hard to be friendly and smiling
It's survival mind state, watch your enemies prowling
Especially if you live in the housing, it be piled in
And every year thousands get sent to the mountains
(You got) young Italians with Mafia ties
There's cops in disguise that ride by with hate in they eyes
And the lawbreakers is the lawyers with briefcases
That beat cases, teenagers with scarfaces
(And what else?)
Plus, them Green Acres folks come here with dreams
Eventually they lose steam and then turn into fiends
The queens turn into ho's, friends turn into foes
And the good die young, shit you know how it goes
(The city's like) a sick body and The Man is the brain
The people is the blood and the trains, they like veins
The streets, like the skin, and garbage is cologne
For a short time I called this my home, but I know it's real

[Hook]
