[Hook]
How could this be? Look out the window, what do I see?
I see angels and demons at war, what are we hustlin' for?
I wanna be free, sometimes I ask GOD "What about me?"
Why can't I have the life that I dream?
This can't be how it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: Serius Jones]
Just holding down your house is a sprain
All accounts gettin' drained, lifting couches for change
The whole game is a drought and the rain keep drowning your brain
Streets announcing your name
When dreams fall, nightmares come true
And in a heated fight, where's Sun Tzu?
The Art of War is a big picture
It ain't hard to draw blood over a little rock, look at Arkansas
My heart is pure so I pardon yours
I was born in the cores, my only flaw is I absorb it all
I try to stick to the script, follow protocols
Cause even Left Eye died chasin' waterfalls
Where's the glory for the good soldier?
Kush boulder, stretching my mind out; that's hood yoga
Formulating my next mass to move ruthless
Cause it seems like the coolest we lose, I be confuse like...

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock WMG
Pushing nice whips, still gutta, crack a hole on the 10 speed
Still on the block like a D.B
On my grind heavy shittin' on them, where the T.P.?
They ain't like me now but these broads steady swangin' on my wee-wee
Never hit 'em raw, hear them "Ahh" when I beat-beat
Keep it Booya! when I'm moving through the streets
Money, Power, Respect, I'm working with all three
Looking out my window, rolling up that Indo
Thinking about my life and self, what am I here for?
Had a thing for hoopin' but that dream was shattered
Then the bricks, gangbanging, and selling rocks what mattered
Surrounded my angels and demons like Tom Hanks
Who do you trust? Friend or a foe? Your bitch or a ho?
What I'm hustling for? Me and my familia
Come between that - then I'm killin' ya
