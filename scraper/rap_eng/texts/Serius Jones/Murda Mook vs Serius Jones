Round 1: Serius Jones
See I'ma tell yall a true story
As god as my witness see i was chilling in my crib
Minding my business
When i get a phone call private
Im like who the fuck is this
Now i ain't gonna say no names
He was like i called you 3 times you ain't call back
Anyway whats good with my nigga murda mook
Im like who the little big nose nigga who be battling on smack
Well he wanna battle you on smack
Im like why this nigga still even battling his songs wack
This nigga need to record a hot track, get a contract, get off my sack, and fall back
He like nah he wanna battle you cause you the only other nigga good enough
Well you know what i asked him right?
How much guap this nigga talking about putting up
Well he was like its on you
You know this is all true smack you know what this fraud do
See we was soppose to battle on new years but this bitch ass nigga canceled talking bout he caught the flu
Now when i see that im like this niggas a shame
See he can't even get in the game for a slave deal
For a whip and a chain
Cause only time he put ice on his wrist is when it gets sprain
And only time he get his dick wet, is when he piss in the rain
See its a tragedy
You gettinbg burned quicker than a calerie
Aintthat the same shit he played with cassidy(Murda Mook: cassidy see i knew he was gonna say that)
See you see me ryhming
Now you wanna crawl out your rathole and battle me
But see im stacking my grind heavy, im eating meals off these lables checks
This bitch ass nigga been on smack 6 times already, and he still ain't got a deal on the table yet
See you ain't got harlem with chu
Thats cuz none of your bars official
You just over stunt and lie in every rap see that the problem wit yu
How you gonna talk about flippin cakes nigga you softer than a muffin
Even your niggas know you fruntin
Talking about coke
The last time this nigga shaved an onion
He was in his kitchen on thanksgiving making stuffing
See niggas ain't forced you to come clean
Cause they ain't have no dirt on you
But i know yous a schoolboy, you know how i know your a schoolboy, cause i did my homework on you
Cause your government name is jonathan ancrum
You went to ford pelham catholic
Thats a private school
What you didn't think i was gonna find out
Thats why we can't buy none of this gunplay that your trying to shout
Cause you left the violence out your life, played sports, and went the college route
So where you get all these whips, clips, chips, that you ryhme about
Come on dog cut it out with these fictional tales
About digital sclaes
Cause deep down in his sioul i know this nigga is frail
See he lie cause he dont know how to be himself in his raps
So he fabricate punch lines about raps and flippin them packs
But see i speak from the heart thats why niggas feel this shit
Nigga i keep it real, you dont even keep it realistic
So tell the truth dog you ain't doing no crimes
Be you in your rhymes
See you a homo rapper
You probably suck dick for studio time

Round 1: Murda Mook
All right miss jones, i dont wanna be your friend after this
So imma get this out real early, suck my dick
Listen up
He dont wanna see me get the pump, so just rap, or you can end up gift-wrap in my nigga trunk
Lame-fuck, stupid nigga
Ain't got a group of figures, remind me of a useless pitcher
Coulnt get his change-up
See i see whats going on here, you tryna get your fame up
You battled jin you won a ten you hopeing for the same luck
Well guess what your little plan is about to be messed up
You see these lens
I killed a lot of niggas in front of this shit you about to be next-up
This ain't that new movie, you ain't walking the "glory road"
Everybody wanna know so heres how the story go
Smack called me i was getting some head
They said you got a victim and it might involve you getting some bread
I said word i puched the bitch off the bed
Whoever,whenver tell me who hes dead
He said you know money that battle jin up in the fight klub
Then i thought of you my face lit up like a light bulb
I ain't one of those cats you may have battled on stage
That had chest colds and viruses im full blown aids
Listen im like that time niggas said they could guard jordan
Niggas say they could do it tell you in that position ans he make your ass look stupid
The streets had me real curious homes
But we all see your nowhere near serius jones
I smack you leave you delirous homes
Make you bleed like a bitch with her period jones
Now niggas saying he's Zab and I'm mayweather
And weather i may win even though I'm way better
Well if that shit’s possible, and niggas saying he’s Zab , let’s resort to the pads, meet Kostya Tszyu
The word spread quicker about me battling this
But you winning, ripleys wounlt even believ that shit
Your peoples gassed you right like is he that sick
Im the end of the road if you beat me thats it
Wrong! even your own man knows
This wasn't a very smart move for your carrer mister jones
O and i feel bad about the management behind you
Cause after they see this they ain't ghonna want to sign you
And the niggas that behind you they ain't gunna laugh now
But watch this dvd look hard into the crowd
Your gunna see a lot of your niggas not looking very proud
And hes an ac, he dont rap
You a comedian duke
You make niggas laugh, cause well thats the shit comedians do
Im the shit look at my last battles for proof
My bars make niggas go whoo that littl enigga theres the truth
