[Round 1: Respek BA]
You must feel real uneasy being on the British map
Cause your shitty cap says Wolf Style cause you're a bitch when you ain't in your pack
You are weak as fuck, so when I beat you up not even the duct tape holdin' the ceilin' will seal your cuts
So first of all, let's talk about the time that Hoffa socked you
Or the fact that you can't handle your Dose so you just act as though you've got loot
Or that Lush One owed you cash, didn't give you it and then blocked you
What will it take to make you realize that Math isn't your strong suit?
I've watched you, and you've stole money from investors thinkin' you could make a fast buck
But used it, on your shit music and ended up bankrupt
You're a liar, a fake, a fraudulent little wack fuck
I'd chuck you in a pit of snakes but that would only give you backup
So now you're hard up because you've derailed your own gravy train
But even though your chase for fame is aimless you still share traits with some famous names
I mean you got clocked like Flava Flav
From a haymaker like David Hay
They had you levitating like David Blain
And your brain swellin' like Fraiser Crane
You attempted to bring some old left back like Leighton Baines
Then you tried to walk away and stumbled like Macy Gray
Now you ain't the same
Cause right before Math knocked your brain back you shouted "Whoo!" like a big twat
He's the only guy who that gets post traumatic stress disorder watchin' a Ric Flair match
You have no spare cash, so I've decided not to snatch your purse
Your best days are past so I'm havin' to make due with you at your worse
This Yank can't see me; David Attenborough's Planet Earth
You're so gay your battles get protested by the west by the Baptist church
Actin' touch, but he likes goin' with guys, it's that simple
When you see a rainbow in the sky you treat it like the fuckin' Bat signal
You claim you clap pistols and I'm not impressed
Right now I'm steppin' on your chest so hard it feels like you're trapped inside a hydrolic press
I pocket check the Walking Dead
Aimin' the final name I put in the coffin for [?] head
I'll have you shot to death
Then extract the bullet from your brain and write your remainin' family a diss track from the lead

[Round 1: Serius Jones]
I said um, normally I like to build with knowledge
Your skills is polished
But this ain't an all around wake, so pull your skirt down B cause you gotta get kilt, you Scottish
The way I go to war in other countries outnumbered, give you the feelin' of a prophet
So I'ma put long shanks through your Braveheart in front of the whole England cause you Scott's thought William was the Wallace
What's real about you?
I don't see nothin' thrill about you
You look like a zombie in the face
So I should smack ya head to your shoulders twice and knock the Thriller out you
Serius Jones, your name's supposed to respect the energy you tryin' to build around you
Respek BA? How the fuck you gon' to tell us how to feel about you?
I beat damn near every American rapper on this card, so let's talk this please
Cause I'm Gucci, everything cut from my cloth is G's
Yeah I had some battles in awkward leagues that's why y'all start these leagues
But my baby needs some Chanel
So for that European bag I had to cross the seas (C's)
I cross C's like a Blood that used to be Crip
I cross seas like I confiscate jewels on the strip
I cross C's, wait shout out to Big T, matter of fact, that's what he do
But I figured since I'm already dottin' your i's (eyes) I might as well cross T too
Eurgh man, is this your word man?
Bad man vs nerd man?
The shit vs a turd man?
I mean why would we even put the respect on ya name when you a...
I said I'm takin' you bad
You know I put the potato on the barrel, this corn beef over hash
But I'll yolk you up and leave your egg on the dash
What you don't get the translation?
Break fast before I literally make you eat bangers and mash
That's one, just know they said this was 90 seconds, I already got you I can see your mind is reckless
This alright yo, you had to speak off life experience
That's one down in your hometown, nigga life is Serius

[Round 2: Respek BA]
Callin' me a zombie is probably not for the best
Cause when Math boxed your head you did a perfect impersonation of The Walking Dead
So you must feel real cocky havin' the balls to call me "zombie"
When you're the one still talkin' after you've been bodied
So if you're tryin' to prove you're so smart you're gettin' off to a slow start
To track all the money you owe fuck you need a flow chart
And now you claim you want to become a actor but you ain't gettin' cast in no parts
Unless they decide to remake Jaws with a loan shark
You don't compose art, so your career's goin' south
It's like I'm playin' poker now cause I haven't even started yet and I'm still takin' this joker out
All your new bars sounds like you wrote them high on golden brown
Cause Math Hoffa made your brain do a permanent "Slow It Down"
And now you're tryin' to hold it down, but you must be recoverin' slowly
Cause your brain speed ain't exactly 140 when your neighbors need to have down syndrome just to keep up with the Jones
And I know we all heard Pat Stay call you a pimp but there's no way that shit's true
Cause you're desperate for battle money and you take sniff too
So how can you have a pimp cane when the 'cane pimps you?
Let me assist you cause you must've got confused
It doesn't make you a pimp just cause your woman is a prostitute
And even if it was the truth, why would she show respect when it's due
When even she can take a fisting better than you
You'll be tellin' some groupies later your hotel room is five stars
Then take them back to the bench that you're sleepin' on in Hyde Park
You can't even afford food from Aldi or buy clothes at Primark
If I told you to "eat shit and die" you'd only have to do the die part
This try hard grew up lovin' Jay-Z and all of his cash
But you had your chance at fame and fortune and watched all of it pass
When you went to the Def Jam offices Damon probably Dash'ed
So you're only throwin' up the Roc(k) if you had to swallow ya stash
You're gettin' stopped in ya tracks
And the difference is you had the prime and might never stop
So fuck gun bars cause I don't need to get a Glock when his chin is already shot
You get a lot of Learn To Box leaflets in ya letterbox
I guess it's alright to spam you because you never block

[Round 2: Serius Jones]
So last night we was watchin' the fight, right?
And he said, "You can't 3-0 BA cause to many people here like him."
And what I told him was, "Nigga don't think you're the battle rap Jesus cause you're growin' your hair and beard like him."
I mean, so I'm rappin' for 90 second verses which he told me
And you rappin' five minutes
I guess that's what they meant by the time difference
He said, "Bruv, I'm gonna put you on to what's goin' on out here"
I guess that's what you mean by puttin' me on to the real London grime, innit?
Okay, so typical corny angles
You said everything that everyone else was speakin' about
I thought this white nigga wit an attitude was sick as AIDS but you tried to take the Eazy way out
Math, Math, Math, right?
So I was in Miami where the sands tanner (Santana)
He tried to Dip but I set it on ya man
He said, You must've been in the gym (Jim) Jones?" Nah, I just learn to handle business off Cam'
Okay, well you know what? They said you need long rounds to body a nigga
Well that's an innovative thesis
Cause that nigga that'll show you how to kill a nigga in three minutes, that was me shit
Plus that 60 second assassin will make you eliminate your defense
But you know how the .22 bullet?
Well y'all don't know but it you in ya gut and travel to ya leg and kill you when the artery shift
Well the point is sometime these short rounds is the ones that penetrate the deepest
I mean I love white people
But he's so white, if you ate fried chicken you'd prolly break out in a rash
I got that AK with the wood stock
I said if it hit his hip, he'll be laid out in the grass
AK with the Woodstock, hit his hippy he'll be laid out in the grass
I said you look like a dope fiend from Boston named Brad
I said, before you win this battle brah, Farrakhan will eat a ham sandwich
You're see through and you're gonna have a gay son, cause you're trans-parent
I said you look like a dope fiend from Boston named Brad
I'll hit you in ya organ til it leak on the floor and the liquor drool and that's my goal
To keep kickin' until I see Liverpools
So you from Glasgow?
We seen them circles around ya eyes and I sold meth so I know how that glass go
You did Jumpoff? No, we don't care about all that
Years ago you had gigs, [?] don't care about all that
I said I'll treat you like that rock
You try to smoke me, I'll leave you toothless here
Take your teeth for a souvenir
And when you get some new ones, I crack those and come back, make you wanna sue veneers
I said you can't beat me cause you got jokes but I'm too real off life experience
Nigga, you in here playin' wit' ya death, yeah, life is Serius

[Round 3: Respek BA]
Now that that shit round is over, it's time to dead ya legend type
If you see yourself gettin' signed again you need to correct ya sight
So yes I'm white, but just because I'm reflectin' light
Doesn't help the fact that your future isn't lookin' very bright
And that English impersonation was mad novice
I'd do my impersonation of you but I'd have to be layin' on my back for it
If that's your best attempt to try and fool me, you might be high on Molly
Either that or gettin' annihilated in battles is your private hobby
If you ever try and box me
The gloves are comin' off like it's a fight in hocky
And I'll need to pull your teeth out of my knuckles just to identify your body
Try and stop me, I'll prove my words are weapons in a hundred seconds
If I turn my back to you I'm about to do the same move Yoshimitsu does in Tekken
Plus I swear this cunt's forgettin' the Trump election
Cause all that stuff you mentioned about my country's past isn't half as funny as your country's present
It's just depressin'
You obviously can't look into the future well
Cause them gun bars you spit will be pretty fuckin' ironic when you go home and shoot yourself
But guns ain't hardcore enough for me, so fuck takin' shots at you
I'll make you snort a line of gun powder then use a lit Molotov cocktail and bottle you
You used to be a nobody who had a little followin' like Life Of Brian
But now your hype's declinin'
I thought this was about gettin' rich or dyin' tryin'
All them other Smack rappers are paid
Compared to you, look how high they're flyin'
You had to watch everyone else blow up around you like Private Ryan
And now this guy's declinin'
And since you hate Scotland I'ma tie you to the tracks and introduce you to Trainspotting
You got signed by Ludacris, then he told you your music ain't droppin'
So you even got K.O'd when opportunity came knockin'
Ain't it ain't shockin', he was the champion of Fight Klub
A company that closed with no profit counted
So at least the first two rules weren't broken cause obviously nobody was talkin' 'bout it
Hear that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No doubt I'm rappin'
So dope my round doubled in length just due to the crowd reaction

[Serius Jones]
Are you done now?

[Respek BA]
No, I'm not done
Fuck knows where I was
But everybody in London knows I drop heavy
I don't need to finish my shit cause I beat this little bitch already
Make some fuckin' noise!

[Round 3: Serius Jones]
I hear you talkin' tough
But if I snuff you they gon' put that metal to your chest like "clear!"
And you wake up when the doc take control
Electricity vs divinity, now that's Shox vs Soul
Um, in Scarface, we seen Tony vs an arsenal (Arsonal) a while ago
Shoot up a few concerts, now that's how you stop a rap tour (Raptor) with a Calicoe
I'll bust on yo' bitch, naked that bush hairy (Harry) I'll bake her (Baker) with the Clips
No respect (Respek) BA, forensics gon' have to come and Scoop the DNA
So I don't care if you got a presidential Rolex that's real hard
See I don't even want the prezy, just show me where the bills are
I said, now that's how you flip a card
Y'all know I did more for battle rap than you so why you wanna Check Points for (4)?
Now you gettin' stopped and inspected, wait, ain't that what a checkpoint's for?
See I come with this, thunderous, drumness
Just like London Bridge falling down, kill all the trolls hidin' under it
See this is how you rep for a crowd in its home
But you an animal though
An anorexic raccoon with down syndrome
If I call my yardman we pullin' the triggers than we done him
If I'm splittin' ya onion, it ain't a nigga makin' stuffin'
If I'm takin' a piss on you, it ain't a nigga makin' fun of you
The best way I can describe you? A cigarette in London
Fag
You know what though? Check it, my niggas, we are desperate
So if I hear you sellin' tree all reckless
I'm comin' to take your O's and pounds and check you for your queen note, check this
See that door over there? You talkin' 'bout fightin', it can be your deathwish
And I'm a pimp so I'ma take yo' bitch
And if I separate you from ya union that's gon' be (B) our (R) exit
It's all good man I'm just appreciatin' to be here in London
You know honestly this is better
Cause I didn't expect shit from him
But you know if anybody want problems after this, two piece and I done them
But you know what? It's done, I wanted to battle another nigga I ain't even want him
