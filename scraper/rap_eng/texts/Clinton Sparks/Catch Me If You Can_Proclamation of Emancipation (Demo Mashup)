[Intro: Clinton Sparks]
Get familiar! Fall Out Boy featuring Travis from Gym Class Heroes!
Get familiar!
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
Lights and swollen glands
Paris, Tokyo, New New New York, M-M-M-M-Mexico
Get plastic (woah oh)
Stay tragic (woah oh)
Proclamation of emancipation oh dear Lord
Please let me into heaven, for just an afternoon

[Chorus]
No, Sam I am
I can't go to sleep without an ambien
Seen so high they call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me if you can (catch), catch me if you can
No, Sam I am
I can't go to sleep without an ambien
Seen so high they call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me if you can (catch), catch me if you can

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the scene for a minute
I know we ain't been seen in a minute
We left before a minute now we all up in it
Baby boy if you got the big dreams go and get it
Never been the type in tight jeans I won't fit in
When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get in
And I'm living clean now while y'all walk in it
No it's me but I don't give a damn if you all don't get it
So fresh and so clean in my Eugene fitted
While I'm laughing at the baby, y'all crying at the clinic
I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I got my own, the world gotta live with it
Never played basketball, but I could show you how to pivot
Making moves in that black hatchback Honda Civic
Like I did in high school, wish that I could relive it
But I can't so let's go on and get the hook a revisit

[Chorus]
No, Sam I am
I can't go to sleep without an ambien
Seen so high they call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me if you can (catch), catch me if you can
No, Sam I am
I can't go to sleep without an ambien
Seen so high they call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me if you can (catch), catch me if you can
