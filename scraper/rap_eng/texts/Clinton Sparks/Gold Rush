[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
You can have the ho
Got her in my phone no panties on
When she leave me she going to need a perm
Throat lozengers and need a comb (Truuu)
Kick sense in the material
I'm fly, I'm aerial
If you a centerfold I'm like here we go
I pass it to my dog like a give and go really though (Gottem')
I'm bout this paper (I'm bout this paper)
What you been thinking? (What you been thinking)
She like my head the one below my navel (Oohh)

You hating this appearance

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Allright
Dolce Gabbana, Prada, Ralph Violet
No nada won't holler
Going in for my pockets
Gold digging in my wallet
You better holler at Ross
I'm not copping them all, I'm still shopping at Ross
Still tryna spend a little bit of Mark Morrison
Return of the Mack, then break that ass off
Give me some Keith Sweat, ease back go off
Dry humping that kneecap till they scream last call
She starts chugging some vodka
She thinking I'm Ryan Gosling
These type of girls are crazy gotta watch them
Wanted Denzel but ended up fucking Waka
I step out the Eldorado
I know you don't love me you just love my poncho
My girls back at home posted up at the condo
Doesn't mean that we can m√©nage though
Let's go

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Baby you can wear my chain
You can take your picture by my car
All your friends can drop my name
Cuz tonight your going to be a star
(Yes you are)

[Hook]
