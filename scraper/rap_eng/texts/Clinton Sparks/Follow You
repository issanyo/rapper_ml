Excuse me, baby, what's the deal?
Could you tell me, baby, how you feel?
I never try to cross the line
But I stepped on it a couple times

She didn't go, she didn't move
She been lookin' past the bad things that I do
She didn't go, she didn't move
That's why she'll always be the one I cater to

Baby, be the leader, I'm the receiver
And I'll follow you, baby, follow you, baby
Baby, be the leader, I'm the receiver
And I'll follow you, baby, follow you, baby

She stayed with me and she didn't leave
But all the time she didn't go, go, go, go
She stayed with me and she didn't leave
But all the time she didn't go, go, go, go

Baby, yes I know I made mistakes
But I was straight up with you
Yes, I told the truth
The truth about every time
I never was the type to lie

She didn't go, she didn't move
She been lookin' past the bad things that I do
She didn't go, she didn't move
That's why she'll always be the one I cater to

Baby, be the leader, I'm the receiver
And I'll follow you, baby, follow you, baby
Baby, be the leader, I'm the receiver
And I'll follow you, baby, follow you, baby

She stayed with me and she didn't leave
Though all the time she didn't go, go, go, go
She stayed with me and she didn't leave
Though all the time she didn't go, go, go, go

Excuse me, baby, what's the deal?
Could you tell me, baby, how you feel?
I never try to cross the line
But I stepped on it a couple times

Baby, be the leader, I'm the receiver
And I'll follow you, baby, follow you, baby
Baby, be the leader, I'm the receiver
And I'll follow you, baby, follow you, baby

She stayed with me and she didn't leave
Though all the time she didn't go, go, go, go
She stayed with me and she didn't leave
Though all the time she didn't go, go, go, go

Baby, be the leader, I'm the receiver
And I'll follow you, baby, follow you, baby
Baby, be the leader, I'm the receiver
And I'll follow you, baby, follow you, baby
