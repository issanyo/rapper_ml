[Verse:]
Here I am, composing a burlesque
Out of where they rest their necks, sunken in their splintered cradles and ramshackle heads
They asked for it, as a boy
I eat my wishes on golden toothpicks and digested them with wolf intestines

[Chorus:]
I fell from the heavens as a fetish blessed with
An operatic skeleton
And as the stars watch me descend
I crack a family tree and chopped off all of the branches
I fell from the heavens as a fetish blessed with
An operatic skeleton
And as the stars watch me descend
I crack a family tree and chopped off all of the branches
Get familiar
