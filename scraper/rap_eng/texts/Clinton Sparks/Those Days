[Ad-Libs]
Hey Booch
Take it home right now

[Hook]
We never thought it go by so quick
The years go faster than the days
My only wish, is that I like to say
(What's That?)
Is Please take me back to those days
When I used to dream
When I didn't care bout likes or shares
(Likes or shares)
Like when I used to be
Considered with only moving my own feet
Its the changing of the seasons
Don’t believe me look outside
And we keep changing all our reasons
Why we would ever say goodbye
My only wish is that I like to say
Is please take me back to those...

[Verse 1: Trey Coachman]
The days I knew how to act my age
Cause right now I don’t wanna turn the page
Perhaps those days left meaning I might not fully grasp
Maybe the wings I never tried out for a single lap
I ran a lot, but now I gotta face the facts
That when I came back I'm a different person
Is it a Change for the better, that’s my concern
Will one day I’ll cross the line that’s checkered
But at least I've learned
And I don’t wanna regret but rather serve the consequence
Of knowing what it’s like for trying out this ambiguous offense
Cause I don’t know if I picked the path I truly would of liked
Cause I’m flipping throughout out these pictures my lip I bite
Cause of the stupid decisions I have made
I blow way out of proportion
Cause all they remember about me is the big achievements today
I still wanna relive the past in portions
Or the whole thing once again
What the memories to me poses
Like laughing more with my friends
And one new door opens once one closes
I’m not the same person as before
And I'm fine with that
Never quite like the first time
So in a heartbeat I would go back

[Verse 2: Seasonally Sick]
It seems the kids always wanna go to cities
(I'll be in Philly)
While the old folks stay at home
(Mom and Dad I'll visit)
We got the boys chasing after the pretties
(Hell Yeah)
And we didn't spend a night alone
(Ha Don't be silly)
Watching cartoons while the sunrise
(Tom & Jerry!)
Catching fireflies while the sunsets
(Okay!)
We didn't stop to smell the roses
(*sign*)
That’s the only thing I can regret
All the moments we had
I say thank you for those days
(I wanna say to Andre, Phil, Max, Jayson, Corey, ...)
When we had each other’s backs
(...Rachel, Dan, Kobie, Jackie, Josh, Jake, Phoebe, Hugh, ...)
And now I wish
(...Alex, James, Joel, and Jon right here, on the chorus)
I could have stayed in those days
Saying
Days when I used to dream
When I didn't care bout likes or shares
Like when I used to be
Considered with only moving my own feet
My only wished that I’d like to say
Please take me back to those days
