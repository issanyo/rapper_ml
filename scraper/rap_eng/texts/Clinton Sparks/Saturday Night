[Verse 1: Clinton Sparks]
It's always unpredictable, except for how it ends
Somehow we feel invincible and wake up with new friends
I leave my better thinking home and put my caution on the shelf
And when I look back at pictures, I don't recognize myself

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]
And I know it sounds unusual to you
But to me, it's simply another Saturday night
Another Saturday night, another Saturday night
Another Saturday night, another Saturday night

[Verse 2: Joey Bandz]
Gone off that grass Hennessy, yeah we pour it
Let's take the Uber, forgot where we going
We hit the spot like we know we the shit
And my whole team in here getting lit
Been going hard all week, let's take the club captive
To them haters I'm a hazard, yeah yeah, I'm a savage
She pulling up, got her cooking breakfast in the morning
And I'mma roll one while I let her whip the foreign
I'm a loner, but on Saturday nights I'm a zoner
Yeah under them lights
And we going up, oh man, what a life
Wake up looking in the mirror, can't remember last night

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]
And I know it sounds unusual to you
But to me, it's simply another Saturday night
Another Saturday night, another Saturday night
Another Saturday night, another Saturday night

[Bridge: Clinton Sparks]
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
And I know we said we'd leave this place by 2
But to me that means 3 on a Saturday
Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]
I love my Saturday night, another Saturday night
Smoke on a Saturday night, drink on a Saturday night
I love my Saturday night
