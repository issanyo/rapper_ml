[Verse 1: Clinton Sparks]
Hey girl, what you do?
Yeah, you knocked me down to the floor
The way you use your sex appeal
Yeah it makes me keep wanting more

[Pre Chorus: Clinton Sparks]

And the hold you got on me is strong
You control me with your ways
And I know fucking with you is wrong
But I still do it anyway

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]

What can I do?
I’m just so caught up
And I can’t seem to get enough
Nothing I can do
When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love
‘violet love

[Verse 2: Clinton Sparks]

You’re so venomous, how you set me up for the kill (for the kill)
And your sex is dangerous, I’m addicted to how you feel
And I’m so strong I don’t ???? up and I just can’t come down
Yeah you trap me in your web of ??? realise when you’re around


[Pre Chorus: Clinton Sparks]

Cause the hold you got on me is strong
You control me with your ways
And I know fucking with you is wrong
But I still do it anyway

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]

What can I do?
I’m just so caught up
And I can’t seem to get enough
Nothing I can do
When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love
‘violet love

You-u-u-u-u
Got that ultraviolet love
Yeah, You-u-u-u-u
Got that ultraviolet love

[Verse 3: T.I.]

Listen, love
Hoppin’ off in the whip again
Ain't nobody better I should know I've checked
How yo rock them heel’ when you wearin' that dress
Them bitches can't win, they no contest, god bless em
And there’ no place I’d rather be
Than on top of you or between your knees
And I gi’ you my salary
Just to see you smile for me
You like it, I know
How I always up at yo’ do’
And if you cold you can ha’ my coat
I keep her wherever I go
And I go so hard I can't deny
That pussy do ??? like porcupine
If I can take that, throw it up in the sky
That’ll be the very day we see the sun retire

[Chorus: Clinton Sparks]
What can I do? I’m just so caught up
And I can’t seem to get enough
Nothing I can do
When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love
‘violet love
You-u-u-u-u
Got that ultraviolet love
Yeah, You-u-u-u-u
Got that ultraviolet love
