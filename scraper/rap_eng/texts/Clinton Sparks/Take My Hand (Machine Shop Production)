[Verse 1]
Calm your nerves now
And don't worry, just breathe
Are you sure now?
Don't bother packing, let's just leave

[Pre-Chorus]
All of them said they wanted change
I hope that you remained the same
To show that this is not a game
Let's end this tragedy today

[Chorus]
Now, take my hand and we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy?
It's over, it's over, it's over

[Verse 2]
Lay down with me
And let me hold you, baby, just breathe
This is ending
We will get through eventually

[Pre-Chorus]
All of them said they wanted change
I hope that you remained the same
To show that this is not a game
We'll end this tragedy today

[Chorus]
Now, take my hand and we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy?
It's over, it's over, it's over
Now, take my hand and we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy?
It's over, it's over, it's over

[Bridge]
We won't be a part of
We won't be a part of this
We won't be a part of
We won't, we won't

[Chorus]
Take my hand and we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy?
It's over, it's over, it's over
Now, take my hand and we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy?
It's over, it's over, it's over
Now, take my hand and we will run away
Down to this place that I know
How did this night become the enemy?
It's over, it's over, it's over

[Bridge]
We won't be a part of
We won't be a part of this
We won't be a part of
We won't, we won't
