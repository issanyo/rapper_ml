[Verse 1:]
The ink is running toward the page, it’s chasing off the days
Look back at both feet and that winding knee
(Welcome To The New Administration, suckers!)
The ink is running toward the page
(Call me the hip-hop rockstar)
It’s chasing off the days
Look back at both feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me

Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world’s a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

[Chorus 1:]
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don’t you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weather vanes my one and lonely

[Bridge:]
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weather vanes my one and lonely
