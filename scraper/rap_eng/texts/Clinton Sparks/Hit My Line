Riders all know you ain't from me
Imma finna wait a whole summer
I see in your feelings
But baby it's okay
Imma always make sure that you straight
As long as when you hit my line
You ain't on no petty shit
Keep it one thousand
I don't need no basic bitch
And just for me you keep yourself available
You know I keep it hood everywhere that I go
So pack your bags and come on

[Pre-Chorus: Joey Bandz]
My phone dry, your phone dry
I just need to see that light notify
I don't wanna be alone tonight
You should come and chill with a nigga
Baby, hit my line

If it a good one then it's just you and I (you and I)
Was kinda hoping we could spend some time (spend some time)
And if you with it baby hit my line (my line)

I know you working out
Maybe later, I can stretch you out
Put, put you on the couch
Slide them panties down
Order Waffle House, go (go) another round
Anywhere (where), girl you can get it
Bust it down from the shower to the kitchen
Send your body crazy girl when I kiss
Know how to run a play, get money []
Hit my line

I don't wanna be alone tonight
