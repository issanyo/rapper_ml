[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
None of you, nuh, betta look at funny
Nuh, you know my name now -- ODB

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard (sample)]
As I poppppppppppp, shotttttttttttttttttts (we gon' pop these shots!)
As I po-a-opppppppp, shotttttttttttttttttts (we gon' pop these shots!)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
'86 was the year that it started
Crack hit the states, and my hood got to poppin'
Back then, you had to catch it with narcotics
Without a doubt, Brooklyn had the hardest projects
Nowadays, if a nigga say you got it
You be sitting in the county, with like 3 or 4 charges
Young when started, but I had a talent
To get this package off, cuz I took it as a challenge
Til older niggas game me much as I can handle
Cop the eagle, started jackin' with the green New Balance shit
I'm feelin' clean, I was only thirteen
With the heavy starch, on my Bugle Boy Jeans
My name's spelled right on my four finger ring
It was Dirt then, cuz McGirt you ain't seen

[Hook 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Toe to toe, I scrap with the best
If I spit ten rhymes, nigga, nine gon' connect
If you in front of 1 or 2, I respect
Cuz I probably just forgot, and wrote it strictly for my set
Wu-Tang, man I love my set
Niggas comin' up here, this is where the G's at
Look here, more money, more problems, my ass
You'se a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real
That's a trick to try to keep you where you at
All content, while niggas ridin' Bentley's and Maybach
Think I'mma lay back, playa, forget it
First hundred G's, I see, nigga, I'm tryin' to flip it
And that's some real shit, not just a lyric
Drop a couple open cases, not too specific
Niggas out here tryin' to prove whose the realest
It's ok to pop shit, but come a little different

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: cut up samples]
"ODB" - cut it up
"Recognize I'm a fool, and you lovin' me"
