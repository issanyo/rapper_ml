[Hook: Jesse Is Heavyweight]
You can't do it by yourself and that's a fucking fact
But you can't share your belt and that's a fucking fact
I came from the hood where niggas fuck with crack
But I swore to live my life like a new Cadillac
Baby bend a corner in a Cadillac
Baby bend a corner in a Cadillac
I come from the hood, niggas fuck with crack
But I swore to live my life like a new Cadillac

[Verse 1: Jesse Is Heavyweight]
I had to hit the hood, a 100 spokes
But I'm tryna hit the dock, 100 boats
My nigga bought another 100 he my fucking folk
My nigga bought another 100 he my fucking folk
Baby EBT up at the CVS
I'm just BET smoked out a DTS
Get my money up, say fuck Medicaid
I got extra paid
I'm like a Escalade
I took it from the bottom to the tip top
Babygirl yo bottom just like hip hop
Baby know in the bed I'm a Dynamo
Yell Geronimo!
I'm bout to Domino

[Hook: Jesse Is Heavyweight]
You can't do it by yourself and that's a fucking fact
But you can't share your belt and that's a fucking fact
I came from the hood where niggas fuck with crack
But I swore to live my life like a new Cadillac
Baby bend a corner in a Cadillac
Baby bend a corner in a Cadillac
I come from the hood, niggas fuck with crack
Swore to live my life like a new Cadillac (2X)

[Verse 2: Jesse Is Heavyweight]
Damn I'm living right I'm so VSOP
Bitch VH1, I'm MSNBC
All these boppas bop cause I'm on top of thangs
I'm bout my bread I shot my vid in front the Stock Exchange
Gravy Train the nation
Shining Time Station
Got all that class but you still ain't got no education
I got a 100 million bitches by my calculation
At least 300 million bitches no exaggeration
Stack 800 Ms like the fuck the dollar meal
I wreck the DJ, like I was Dolla Bill
Stack 800 Ms like the fuck the dollar meal
I wreck the DJ, like I was Dolla Bill
