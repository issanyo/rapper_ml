Mr. World Wide
Let us watch, while you have a good time
The night is right and the feeling is right
So let's do everything wrong, right?

[Hook: Clinton Sparks]
Can I just watch you? If you don't mind
Can I just watch you? If you don't mind, mind, mind, mind
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Can I just watch you? If you don't mind
Can I just watch you? If you don't mind
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah

[Verse 1: Clinton Sparks]
It's like I'm mesmerized by you
I'm caught up in your spell
I can't take my eyes off you
And what you do so well
It's like the whole world just turned down
Your body's all I hear
Admiring your sound
It plays so loud and clear

[Hook: Clinton Sparks]
So I'll just watch you, if you don't mind
Yeah I'll just watch you, if you don't mind, mind, mind, mind
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I've been watching you and your friends
And all of 'em 9's and 10's
I feel like quarterback, I got options
My chances ain't slim, I'm messing with ya
Here we go again
Who's that chico with them block boys on the benz?
Las Vegas, Sin City
But me, I'm from the home of the sins, Dade County
Baby, you the one that I want
The one that I'm watching, pencil skirt
High heels and stockings and it got me going crazy
Like 'ooh-baby, baby, baby'
It's all on you
And I'm hoping that gonna get down and dirty too
It's way too strong
Leave your friends alone and let's go, come on

[Hook: Clinton Sparks]
Can I just watch you? If you don't mind
Can I just watch you? If you don't mind, mind, mind, mind
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Can I just watch you?
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Can I just watch you? If you don't mind
Yeah-eah-eah-eah, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
