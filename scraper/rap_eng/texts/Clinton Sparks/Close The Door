[Intro: Clinto Sparks Talking]
Ladies and gentelman
My name is Clinton Sparks
His name is Mike Posner
Say hello ladies

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Goodbye to the old me
Goodbye to the minutes n seconds n hours
Hello to the new me
I like how this feels

[Hook: Mike Posner]
So close the door
Close the door(hey)
Close the door
Close the door(hey)

[Interlude: Clinton Sparks Talking]
You know something
You know what feels good
If feels good now a days
When I walk into a store
And the lady comes up to me and says
"Let me show you what's on sell"
And I look at her square in her eyes and I say
"How about you show me what's not on sale?"
Lady this ain't '97 anymore
This the new me
Matter of fact, let me buy you a better looking outfit when you talk to me
This ain't when I used to live in my truck
Trucks live with me now
Look at my house, they hang all around my place"
Oh it feels so good
I wish I could express how great this feels
Talk to 'em Mike

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Goodbye to the old me
Goodbye to the minutes n seconds n hours
Hello to the new me
I like how this feels

[Hook]
