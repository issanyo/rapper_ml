[Intro: Clinton Sparks]
Shouts out to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino

[Verse 1]
Homecoming, I'm coming
My sweet mistake
Summer's over
(Clinton Sparks)
Hope it's not too late
I'm pacing, impatient
Up in my head
Taken back to the sidewalk where we met

[Pre-Chorus]
And carved out our names
Do you remember that?

[Chorus]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart for you

[Outro: Clinton Sparks]
It's Decaydance Records, suckers!
