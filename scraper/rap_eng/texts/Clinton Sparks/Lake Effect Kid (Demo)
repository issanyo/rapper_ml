[Intro: Clinton Sparks]
Clinton Sparks! Fall Out Boy!
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]
Sometimes when I'm in heaven
I get forgetful of the earth, woah
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds
The heat is on, gate's open, the shade is down

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump]
I've got the skyline in my veins
Forget your night times
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
'til Lakeshore Drive goes back into focus
I just wanna come back to life
Spark until you hit or give your woman love

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun, fun

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in (to the city I grew up in)
Again and again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in (to the city I grew up in)
Again and again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
