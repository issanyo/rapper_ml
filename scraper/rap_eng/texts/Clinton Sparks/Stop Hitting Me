[Intro]
I feel on top of the world!

[Verse 1]
I swear to god, the next girl who says she misses me
I'm sending her to management, yeah, I remember you girl
Last time we talked was the first grade, class of Ms Pearl
I let you borrow my blue crayon, that must've meant the world
Listen, I ain't trying to be hurtful but you're a frustrated, dumb basic nutcase, with the mind like a turtle (slow)
These dimes couldn't tell you that a dime is a circle
They date inanimate objects like they were in a Calvin Klein commercial
I get verbal, rappers get quiet when I write this journal
If they stink, I got hygiene like I am Urkel
I told you the only suspender I know was my middle school principal
After I said that his contract didn't get renewed (oops)
I got power now, I can't wait to misuse it
Ace every student who's breaking the rules or breaking the rulers
Everyday someone stupid approaches me like "what's happening?!"
Like we're pals again
But that's what happens when

[Chorus]
Everybody probably heard about you
Everybody heard wrong, but to them it's true
And I'm hearing all these things about myself that I never knew
It goes, one for the money, two for the show
Three for every opinion on one, two, and mo'
Come to your door like "we ain't friends no more, stop hitting me!"

[Verse 2]
To anybody in my proximity, my life as a whole is on airplane mode
I want a Bugatti, just to avoid y'all in a higher speed
I wanna private jet, just for the privacy
I won't even fly that shit, I'll just sit there and I don't care if the stewardess advise that shit
I need some me time
I need some sea wide, reclined, beach side, water with three limes at least time
I don't hang out in public
Ever since some chick asked if I was signed by Wahlburger's I been done wit' it (stupid bitch)
But Marksy, that's my brethren, so don't call me with the envious questions
I'll send him to teach you a lesson
And I say you did it, but he said that I said that you said you did it
But I didn't
He said that you said you did it, but you didn't
He said you did it but you didn't say you did it, did you?
Just an issue when

[Chorus]
Everybody probably heard about you
Everybody heard wrong, but to them it's true and
I'm hearing all these things about myself that i never knew
It goes, one for the money, two for the show
Three for every opinion on one, two, and mo'
Come to your door like "we ain't friends no more, stop hitting me!"

[Verse 3]
And I don't understand you, we used to be friends, why you treat me like a fan dude?
Tell me that you messed up and you just want the homie back
Why every time you hit me it's always 'bout a collab (oh snap)
And now they're wonderin' where Token's at
Well I'll tell you where Token's at!
He's at home tryin' to drop another fraud
His inbox will not recover when he block your number 'cause
Everybody probably heard about you
But when it come back to me homie I promise it never turn out true
Everything circling around hundreds of times
Nerdy critics but no further thinkin' than a burgers sitting with a person flicking their crumbs awry
But it ain't all about the bread man, this shit is my life and I'mma do it 'til I'm dead man
Still I lose my head man, when I get approached like "what's cracking mane?"
Like we actually hang
But that's an average day when

[Chorus]
Everybody probably heard about you
Everybody heard wrong, but to them its true and
I'm hearing all these things about myself that i never knew
It goes, one for the money, two for the show
Three for every opinion on one, two, and mo'
Come to your door like "we ain't friends no more, stop hitting me!"
