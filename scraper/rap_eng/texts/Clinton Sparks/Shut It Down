[Intro: Pitbull & (Akon)]
Mr. 305
I want everybody (Akon)
To get ready
Cause we about to shut down

[Hook: Akon & (Pitbull)]
Oooo-oooo
Can't tell me nothing now baby I know how to fly

(Now watch me, now watch me, watch me shut this thang)

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I hit the jackpot check, check, check, check, check, check, ching
Real chicos do real things on the road to get diamond rings
Moved up from the streets graduated hustla on it's way to an entrepreneur undefeated double shooter
Now baby save me from the game before replacement my life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese
I couldn't care less if you love me or hate me life's a bitch now fuck you pay me

[Bridge: Pitbull (x2)]

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Lose my mind now honey now pay me what you owe me my mens a hurricane you should see the way she glow it
I don't make it rain I speak that global warming this same no biggie ain't ready to dance
Now baby save me from the game before replacement
My life's a movie call me Martin Scorsese
I couldn't care less if you love me or hate me life's a bitch now fuck you pay me

[Bridge: Pitbull (x2)]

[Hook: Akon]
