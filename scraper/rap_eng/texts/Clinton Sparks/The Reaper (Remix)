[Intro: Clinton Sparks]
Nah, nah, nah nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah nah, nah nah

[Verse 1: Clinton Sparks]
This side of Heaven
It got a dollar to my name
Never gave me nothing
I took it all and kept the change
And this broke ass hustlin' bitch sleeping in the streets
Just another misunderstood sucker with these beats

[Pre-Hook: Clinton Sparks]
I'm just a son with no father
Who's got his head on the water

[Hook: Clinton Sparks]
Good Lord have mercy
I know they say there ain't no hope for me
Good Lord have mercy
I'm just a slave till the day I'm free
Good Lord have mercy
I thank God for this angel on my sleeve
Good Lord have mercy
I just need some company
Till the reaper comes
Till the reaper comes
(Nah, nah, nah nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah nah, nah nah)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Cheaper the keeper
Believe me, I'm in my fever
Body bagger, a sleeper
Fill up the green reaper
Keep up what you can keep up
Sneak up when we all creeped up
There be no sequels or equals 'cause this is for my peoples
Now gather around so I can break it down and educate
And tryna elevate, teach you how to bake a cake
Wake up, wake up, see time is running out, no?
You keep a closed mouth, stay on the right row
And take the time out, I come to find out

[Pre-Hook: Clinton Sparks]
I'm just a son with no father
Who's got his head on the water

[Hook: Clinton Sparks]
Good Lord have mercy
I know they say there ain't no hope for me
Good Lord have mercy
I'm just a slave till the day I'm free
Good Lord have mercy
I thank God for this angel on my sleeve
Good Lord have mercy
I just need some company
Till the reaper comes

[Verse 3: Problem]
(Problem, what?)
If you alive, then your dreams ain't dead
They drop heads when I pull up in a drophead
The block said I represent what the block bred
If I fail, then they fail
Coin flip, if I blow then they sell
Heard they yell I sold out
[?] pushing [?] on the regular
The money's calling, bet the devil is creeping in my cellular
But whatever bro, I gotta win, it's clearer than vodka, gin
Heaven's at the end, knowing Jesus ain't forgot a sin
In the [?] praying that I never have to sin again
Renegade, been to fade, go and ask my [?] friends
Fuck it, I'm about to spark the weed up
The white world 'bout get fucking geared up

[Hook: Clinton Sparks and Problem]
Good Lord have mercy
I know they say there ain't no hope for me
Good Lord have mercy
I'm just a slave till the day I'm free
Good Lord have mercy
I thank God for this angel on my sleeve
Good Lord have mercy
I just need some company
Till the reaper comes
(Get Familiar!)
Till the reaper comes
(Nah, nah, nah nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah nah, nah nah)
Good love must stay
(Nah, nah, nah nah, nah nah)
Good love must stay
(Nah, nah, nah nah, nah nah)
I just need some company
Till the reaper comes
