Alright, come on now, here we go;
You know we gotta get Barack and all of his crew
In the White House so they can prove that
In their hearts they know what to do
And that includes Michelle and the kiddies too
Well John McCain and the G.O.P
Well I've got a couple problems with your policy
It's a grand old party but it's not for me
'Cause I don't make a buck or own a station on T.V

[Chorus]
We believe in Barack Obama
He loves you and he loves your mama
We believe in Barack Obama, yeah
With all the change he's building
Gonna bring hope to the children
We believe in Barack Obama, yeah
