It's time to get familiar ("get familiar")

(Cli-Cli-Clinton Sparks)

[Hook: CNN]
I see you lookin like you sizin me up
System on blast when I'm drivin my truck
Hatin on me when I'm up in the club
If you really want a problem with me playa - STAND DA FUCK UP!
Money cars and clothes, homey I seen that
You better off in the club doin the "Lean Back"
Before your whole fuckin wig get clean back
So don't FUCK with me playa I mean that!

[Noreaga]
Pull out the four-fifth, grippin on niggas
(Why's that?) Wet niggas like I'm spittin on niggas
(Whatever!) Cock guns straight flippin on niggas
See me flowin in that Maybach, skippin on niggas

[Capone]
Uh, uh uh, uh, yeah
We still sell coke wet on the corner
(What you say?) You better show some respect on my corner
(I heard that) You could even meet death on my corner (what else)
Cause we do it like do it, we thuggin it rap performers

[Noreaga]
Uh, and you can even get, caught on your steps
You could leave out the club and have your last breath

[Capone]
You could get shot at the light, while you makin a left
Or you could get shot out your Nikes when I put you in check

[Noreaga]
See homes I'm in that Caddy cat, smokin that Manny Stacks
Got twin Glocks that's a match like Penny Pat

Fold that, light that, puff puff, pass that
