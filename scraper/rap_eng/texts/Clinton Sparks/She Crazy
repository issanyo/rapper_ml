[Aaliyah]
Yeahhh mhmm mhmm

[Intro: Rick Ross]
You know sometimes in life shit is so crazy
I wanna smoke one for my nigga peanut
That’s my brother forever nigga I love you nigga
Your son is mine nigga
Let me check this bitch right quick though

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Been through a lot 9.0 times it gets cold
Doing bad had you take dope up the road
Had a situation where she kept it G as fuck
Sometimes realer then the niggas that I trust
Running in banks, walking out stores
Anything that I needed signature she would forge
Fucked up her credit overdue rental cars it was all 50/50 in this lil thing of ours
Girl used to lace me shoplifting at Macy’s
I just loved that fact that she really did embrace me
Then she started dancing really didn't faze me
Started popping pills that's when shit got crazy
Money come and go but the trill will remain
When this rap shit pop I told her that I never change
Have been stacking change and I gotcha a lil' cut
When we meet again girl we can live it up

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
(Ooooh) And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my, (Ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (Ooooh)

(Ooooh) And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my, (Ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (Ooooh)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Smokin' weed looking at your picture on the wall
I remember hittin' licks then we both hit the mall
Talkin' new kicks, Cologne, down to The Drawers
Raised like brothers but this dope game flaw
Things that I saw really made me wanna change
This a shame what 5 dollars do to niggas veins
After graduation best friends parted ways, fuck house parties
Now it’s time to get paid we were movin' white
While my niggas touchin' the H
We were still broke but money was on the way
Shit were goin' great til' my nigga caught a case
DNA matched a homicide back from '98 fucked up plans incarcerated my man
Took his Lexus Jeep Diamond Rings of his hand
Damn, but you can't take a real nigga legacy legends live forever
So my letter reads

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
(Ooooh) And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my, (Ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (Ooooh)

(Ooooh) And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my, (Ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (Ooooh)
