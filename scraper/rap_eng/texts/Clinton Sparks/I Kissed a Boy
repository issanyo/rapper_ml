[Verse 1]
Yo check it out, I've got a plan
Here's my intention
The frat boys in the club are lame
Let's start an altercation
It's just what I'm used to
Just want to fuck shit up
I got my whole damn crew
Come on, what you going to do

[Chorus]
I kissed a boy and they liked it
Got all the honeys in the club excited
I kissed a boy just to start shit
And homeboy was not about it
I know it's wrong, but I don't mind
I'm going to start shit tonight
I kissed a boy just to start shit
Bitches loved it

[Verse 2]
Nah, you don't even know my name
It doesn't matter
Don't even front, you got no game
You're just a sucker
So what now, I clowned you
And I'm stealing your girl too
She wants a secure dude
And that's just not you

[Chorus]
I kissed a boy and they liked it
Got all the honeys in the club excited
I kissed a boy just to start shit
And homeboy was not about it
I know it's wrong, but I don't mind
I'm going to start shit tonight
I kissed a boy just to start shit
Bitches loved it

[Verse 3]
Me and my bros thats how we roll
You'll never know how far we'll go
I'll grab some chump that I don't know
And plant one right on him
You're only here for our
Amusement

[Chorus]
I kissed a boy and they liked it
Got all the honeys in the club excited
I kissed a boy just to start shit
And homeboy was not about it
I know it's wrong, but I don't mind
I'm going to start shit tonight
I kissed a boy just to start shit
Bitches loved it

[Outro: William Beckett]
