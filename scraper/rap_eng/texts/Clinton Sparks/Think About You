[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Getcha money, don't make love that's the motto
Had to take a break from us, hit the lotto
I meditated and I'm medicated, hopin' it would die
We will never make it but I still can break it even when we try

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I think about you when I'm not suppose to
I write about you, anything we go through
You're my Drake song, you my fucking my go to
Even when I'm blacked out I still think about you
I think about you when I'm not suppose to
She got her hands on me, I sill want to hold you
I dream about you, when I'm not around you
Even when I'm blacked out I still think about you

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
Yeah you turn me upside down like a bottle
And the nights are little they turn to tomorrow
I change the station took a vacation try to trip off
I stay away you stay away even when you not around

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I think about you when I'm not suppose to
I write about you, anything we go through
You're my Drake song, you my fucking my go to
Even when I'm blacked out I still think about you
I think about you when I'm not suppose to
She got her hands on me, I sill want to hold you
I dream about you, when I'm not around you
Even when I'm blacked out I still think about you
I think about you when I'm not suppose to
She got her hands on me, I sill want to hold you
I dream about you, when I'm not around you
Even when I'm blacked out I still think about you
