[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Miami's in the house without a doubt
I'm the chico in the club that they yell about
I'm from the city where the women all real
Bodies are great, but they body parts fake
Dilly dally, I run for your mami
And that ass is off the chain
I hit that thing so hard
She called 411 pain, dammit man
Let's go to Jamaica for Sean Paul
Then take it to Tally for T-Pain
Mami move that ass like chitty chitty bang bang
Chitty chitty bang bang
