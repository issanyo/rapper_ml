[Chorus]
Oh Dakota, I know our love is new
I barely know you, I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do that make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?

[Verse 1]
She's got a little bit of money and a little bit of this and it's all she needs to live
I've got a little bit of love and a little bit of that and it's all I have to give
But this time, I'll try not to show that I am not letting go

[Chorus]
Oh Dakota, I know our love is new
I barely know you, I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do that make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?
