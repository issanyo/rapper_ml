Came here to pa-pa-pa-pa-papapa-party !

[Verse 1 : Leaf]
I see you, see you dancin
You see me, see me dancin
Across the room
You make me, make me uh oh
Make my heart, make my heart go
Boom boom boom boom
You're dancin, dancin dirty
And glancin, extra flirty
Can you dance over to me ?
I'm windin, and you're starin
You're grindin, just preparin
Better dance over to me
Dance, dance, dance, dance

[Hook : Leaf]
I can't deny it, 'ny it, I can't deny it, 'ny it
And with the stereo blastin to that techno-tronic
You can't deny it, 'ny it, you can't deny it, 'ny it
And with the stereo blastin to that, let's go!
Came here to party ! Not to hear no bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
Let's get it started ! DJ blast that music, music, music
And now I'm screaming, uhoh, uh oh, uhoh, uh oh, uhoh, uh oh, yeah
Can you feel it, uhoh, uh oh, uhoh, uh oh, uhoh, uh oh, yeah

[Verse 2 : Sky Blu]
I come through in the fleet
Big bad baller, million in a week
Sky Blu baby, that's my name
Stunnin on hoes, that's my game
I'm grindin on you, and I'm simulatin
But I need a drink cause I'm awfully faded
I think we should go cuz your friends are hatin
Now go outside cuz the drivers waitin
I do me, I love how I live
I told you in yes I had a club at the crib
You and your friends, the perfect 10
Let it get freaky, and do it again
I can't deny it, shit is hot, heat I supply it
Great memories, I provide it
Coffee patron, won't you try it ?

[Hook : Leaf]
I can't deny it, 'ny it, I can't deny it, 'ny it
And with the stereo blastin to that techno-tronic
You can't deny it, 'ny it, you can't deny it, 'ny it
And with the stereo blastin to that, let's go!
Came here to party ! Not to hear no bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
Let's get it started ! DJ blast that music, music, music
And now I'm screaming, uhoh, uh oh, uhoh, uh oh, uhoh, uh oh, yeah
Can you feel it, uhoh, uh oh, uhoh, uh oh, uhoh, uh oh, yeah

[Interlude : Leaf]
You got me like uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
That's how we do it on the dancefloor
You got me like uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
That's how we do it on the dancefloor
Floor, floor, floor, floor, floor, floor
Floor, floor, floor, floor, floor, floor
Dancefloor, dancefloor !

[Hook : Leaf]
Came here to party ! Not to hear no bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
Let's get it started ! DJ blast that music, music, music
