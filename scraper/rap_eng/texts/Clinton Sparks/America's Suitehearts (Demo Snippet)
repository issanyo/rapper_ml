[Introduction: Clinton Sparks]
Lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess
(It's called "America's Suitehearts"!)
I'm in love with my own sins
(The album is coming!)

[Verse]
You can bow and pretend that
You don't, don't know you're a legend
