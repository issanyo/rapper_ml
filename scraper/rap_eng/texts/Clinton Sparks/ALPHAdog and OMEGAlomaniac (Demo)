[Intoduction: Clinton Sparks]
Welcome to the new administration!
Clinton Sparks! Fall Out Boy!
Get familiar!

[Verse 1]
Clap until your hands hurt
Standing ovations or boos
Watch until we blur, walk off into the sunset
Tell rock n' roll I'm alone again
I wanna put the mid-west home again
Your time has passed, they say never means never
But so the fast stares won't last but never means forever
Never means forever

[Chorus]
Alpha dog and omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh-oh-megamegalo
Welcome to the new administration
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and omegalomaniac

[Verse 2]
We must have the best coats
Tell the best jokes
We must make it look so easy
Doing something so hard
You must see my way
That's when they look at me
I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a star

[Chorus]
Alpha dog and omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh-oh-megamegalo
Welcome to the new administration
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and omegalomaniac

[Verse 3]
You're not the first or the last
But your possibly the prettiest. Whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand
I'm just fine
Not the first or the last
But your possibly the prettiest. Whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand
I'm just fine

[Chorus]
Alpha dog and omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh-oh-megamegalo
Welcome to the new administration
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and omegalomaniac

[Outro: Pete Wentz & Clinton Sparks]
Sorry, you're gonna have to wait to hear the rest of that
Welcome to the administration!
