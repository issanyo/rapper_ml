Clintonsparks.com, friendsorenemies.com, you are now rocking with the hottest show on radio!
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, tonight is the Welcome To The New Administration edition. It's all about Fall Out Boy, get familiar
And like every week we have rappers, actors, athletes, low self esteem whores on the show.  This week is no different! We got an actor, you may know him from Austin Powers, a lot of movies, he goes by the name of Seth Green, get familiar ladies and gentlemen! He's checking in on the phone line
Now Seth, you go back aways with Fall Out Boy. You've known them for quite some time now, talk to us about how you met them
You know, I met Fall Out Boy maybe, seven years ago when they were playing, ah,  in between [? 0:44-0:46], and I remember being, ah, a little unimpressed with their style but, yeah they just had, a funk [? 0:52], thats all I was really feeling. But I gave them $25 in tips, and that was enough to get their speakers out of [? 0:58] ever since. I never much cared for their music, but they're really good for yardwork, and are always there when I need to get to the airport
Like I said, [? 1:07] as I can say. Thanks guys, thanks a lot!
