[Verse 1]
It's like you moving in slow motion
That's how I see you in my mind
I'll give my lifetime of devotion
A love like yours is hard to find

[Chorus]
And I would drive out through the night
Just to be with you, just to be with you
And I would fight a samurai
Just to be with you, just to be with you
And I would run five hundred miles
Just to be with you, just to be with you
And I don't give a damn right now
Just to be with you, just to be with you
Tonight

[Bridge]
Where would I be without your love?
There is no me without your love
Where would I be without your love?
There is no me without your love
Where would I be without your love?
There is no me without your love

[Chorus]
And I would drive out through the night
Just to be with you, just to be with you
And I would fight a samurai
Just to be with you, just to be with you
And I would run five hundred miles
Just to be with you, just to be with you
And I don't give a damn right now
Just to be with you, just to be with you
Tonight

And I would run five hundred miles
Just to be with you, just to be with you
And I don't give a damn right now
Just to be with you, just to be with you
Tonight
