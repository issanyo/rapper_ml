[Verse 1]
For your love I would swim clear cross the ocean
If I knew I'll die, I'll die trying
Do anything for your hearts devotion
'Cause I see the god in your eyes
And you'll be the sun in my sky
The star that'll guide me at night
Even at times when we fight
It's alright it's alright oh

[Chorus]
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care

[Verse 2]
And your loves my independence
You set me free now I'm flying
Above all I can depend on
And you loving me for all times
And that's what I need in my life
And you make the dullest light bright
We can just agree to disagree tonight
It's alright, it's okay

[Chorus]
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care

[Bridge]
You gotta know
You got a love you can depend on
In me a trust that our love will grow strong
There's no second guessing
Or wondering if the way I feel is for real
'Cause I'll be your shield when your fighting
I'll be your eyes when you're blinded
My love is eternal, so unconditional
From the beginning til the end

[Chorus]
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I'm a tell you like this I'm right here
And I ain't never going nowhere
They can say what they want, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
