[Verse: Remix]
The lips that slip
Are the lips that press
And the lips that leak
Seem to know you best
The lips that slip
The lips that slip
The lips (Clinton Sparks)
The lips (Clinton Sparks)
The li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li
Get familiar

[Verse]
The lips that slip
Are the lips that press
And the lips that leak
Seem to know you best
I put bodies in motion
Keep this skin out in the open
Liars turn me on

[Pre- Chorus]
Bedspread Bandit since '89
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I threw mine to the sky

[Chorus]
Bounce, bounce, baby, bounce back to me
You don't need this
Bounce, bounce, baby, bounce back to me
You don't need this
This is it, call it quits with honesty
You don't need him
Every word is a curse, let loose on me
Your mouth, it moves but fails to speak
And when you use your lips they better be on me
Get familiar
