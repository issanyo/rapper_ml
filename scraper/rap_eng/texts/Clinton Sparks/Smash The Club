[Intro: Lil Jon]
Yeah!
Ladies and Gentlemen! (Hey!)
I'd like to welcome you out
To the club tonight (Welcome!)
Right now
It's time for some madness (yeah!)
Put your fucking drinks up
Clinton Sparks, DJ Snake, Pitbull
Lil Jon, Kardinal
Show the DJ some love
We about to smash, this, club

[Bridge 1: Lil Jon]
Y'all want this party started right
Y'all want this party started now
Y'all want this party started right
Y'all want this party started right now

[Pre-Hook: Clinton Sparks]
Hey girl
I cannot rock you baby
Hit the floor now, cause
We came to smash the club
Now let me show you how
We shut the club down
Whenever we come through
If you don't know, then get familiar
With what we about to do

[Hook: Lil Jon *With Clinton Sparks*]
We came to smash this club
Came to tear it up
We came to smash this club
Came to tear it up
*We came to smash this club*
*Came to tear it up*
*We came to smash this club*
Put your fucking drinks up*

[Post-Hook: Lil Jon]
Turn it back, take another one!
Turn it back, take another one!
Turn it back, take another one!
Turn it back, take another one! (Drinks up!)
Turn it back, take another one!
Turn it back, take another one!
Turn it back, take another one!
We came to tear it up!

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Showtime, as soon as I walk in the club
Girls recognize, showing celebrity love
I'm celebrity faced and on top of the speaker
Drinks up, looking for a celebrity streaker
Let em off, shawty
I'll throw your rings up like Kobe
You an all star, show me
You can never be my one and only
But if you're sexy
I'll make sure you don't go home lonely
Club lights, flash from them bottles
Tryna get lucky like lotto
Give it to you, pass out, that's the motto
Full throttle, just saying
When you ain't looking, I saw you
Don't bother with the I ain't never did this before
This cheap, I've seen you do it all last week
Between this club, at this town
Better get yours before I get mine

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
You can buy the club, but I own it
No more shots for her, cause she's on it
And by the end of the night
Imma have her and her friend
My tongue done be on it
Habla mucho, pero no tiene conjo
What I look like, fighting these mojons
Not me, I'm going to the next country
Getting more more more dough
Pits hit more chicks than you can fathom
You ain't gotta take them, you can have them
I'm a savage, I'm hit em all day
But my tongue is what grabs them
Just imagine this when you get all fat
Prrrrrrr, she came twice, I came last
You know the rest, roll the grass

[Pre-Hook+Hook]

[Bridge 2: Lil Jon]
I know you not sitting down over there (get up)
I see you (get up, get up)
You the only motherfucker doing it (Hey!)
Everybody else with this motherfucker party (Yeahh!)
Turn this motherfucking up (Aha)
Lets go lets go, everybody make some noise
Everybody make some noise!
Turn it up! Hey

[Hook: Lil Jon]

We Smash the club (New York)
