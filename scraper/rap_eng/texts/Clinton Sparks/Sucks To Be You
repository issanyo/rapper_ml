[Verse 1: Clinton Sparks]
Calling up my phone
Showing up at the club
When I tell you to stop
You just keep showing up
Cause you're feeling regret
Now that we are through (through, through, through)
Since the day you've left
Everything's bein' cool
Thought that you were fresh
But the jokes on you
And now what we had
Is all that you'll claim too (too, too)

[Chorus]
I bet it sucks to be you, you, you
I bet it sucks to be you, you, you
Yeah, it sucks to be you, you, you
It must suck to be you, you, you
When you say 'me'

You must of been outta your damn mind (damn mind)
You break my heart and now you wanna cry? (wanna cry)
Mad at yourself, because of me you failed
Cause leaving me, girl, was your epic fail
You lose

[Verse 2: LMFAO]
I see your tweets
On how I'm so sweet
How you miss taking trips abroad
Getting freaky by the tiki on the beach
Uh, but you should do know
That you never should've done me wrong
Now I'm in the club
Singing David Guetta girl
The 'Love is Gone'

You gotta be outta your damn mind (damn mind)
You break my heart and now you wanna cry (wanna cry)
I really wasn't worth that other dude
You slip and slide and say 'bye, bye, you fool'
I'm gone!

[Chorus]
I bet it sucks to be you, you, you
I bet it sucks to be you, you, you
Yeah, it sucks to be you, you, you
It must suck to be you, you, you
When you say 'me'

You must of been outta your damn mind (damn mind)
You break my heart and now you wanna cry? (wanna cry)
Mad at yourself, because of me you failed
Cause leaving me, girl, was your epic fail
You lose

[Verse 3: JoJo]
Stop calling me drunk, when you're stumbling home
Boy, you're shit outta luck
You're going be sleeping alone
Oh and stop telling lies
As if I'm stalking you
You know you'll be crying to my best friend and my mamma too
You're really creeping me out
When will you leave it alone
Don't be surprised when I just go ahead and cut off the phone
And you're so stuck in the past
You need to just let it go

I bet it sucks to be you, you, you
I bet it sucks to be you, you, you
Yeah, it sucks to be you, you, you
It must sucks to be you, you, you
When you say 'me'

[Verse 4: Clinton Sparks]
Man, I ain't tripping on you
I'm just gonna go out and (party)
We gonna hit the club, because tonight we gonna (rock)
So if you happen to run into me, out at this (party)
Don't bother talking, cause you and me ain't gone ever (rock)

Bitch, I'm gone
Bitch, I'm gone
Bitch, I'm gone
You lose
