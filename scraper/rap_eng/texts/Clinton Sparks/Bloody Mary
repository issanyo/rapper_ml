[Intro]
Honey
Oh

[Verse 1]
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

[Chorus]
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See (see), when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary

[Post-Chorus]
Love

[Verse 2]
We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris, cold
Je ne veux pas mourir tout seule

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

[Chorus]
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See (see), when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary

[Post-Chorus]
Love

[Interlude]
Gaga, Gaga

Gaga, Gaga
Gaga, Gaga
Gaga, Gaga

[Breakdown]
Dum dum, da-di-da
Dum dum, da-di-da-dadda-da-di-da
Dum dum, da-di-da
Dum dum, da-di-da
Dum dum, da-di-da-dadda-da-di-da
Dum dum, da-di-da

[Chorus]
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do, do, do
I won't cry for you
See (see), when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary

[Outro]
