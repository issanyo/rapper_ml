[Plies talking:]
I'm lookin' for one female, that I can turn into a spoiled brat
A spoiled brat
I wanna spoil you seven days a week

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
I buy you Gucci and Prada, and fly you all around the world
Because you so much hotter, then all them other girls
So when we rollin' on the eastside, you coolin' wit me
But when you pull up in that new ride, this is all they gon' say
Damn right she got it goooood, hell yeah she got it made
Damn right she got it goooood, hell yeah she got it made

[Verse 1: Plies]
Millionaire life status I can make yours the same
Big crib, nice whips, I can get it all arranged
I can get ya own chauffeur, I can put ya on a plane
Clear stones, nice diamonds I can put 'em in ya ring
Big rocks, flawless ice, I can put it on ya chain
Nice weight, nice hips, I can put it on ya frame
Buy ya stocks, buy ya bonds, I can put 'em in ya name
If you like to ride candy, I can put ya in the paint
If you like top shelf, I can put it in ya drink
If you need a little paper I can put it in ya bank
If you need a little sex, I can drop it in ya tank
If you ever get cold, I can put you in a mink

[Verse 2: Plies]
I can make ya everyday look like a big time model
I can spoil ya everyday and have ya livin' on the water
All 5 star suites, we ain't doin' no Ramada's
You ain't got to cook baby, all you got to do is order
If you ever wit me, you ain't got to spend a quarter
Ya own beautician baby, all you got to do is call her
Got a closet full of purses, every one of 'em I done bought 'em
Got ya a teacup Yorkie just to match wit the Prada
Wanna tear down Bell Harbor, all you got to do is holla
Let ya act a little street, let ya drink out of the bottle
Send ya on vacation wit ya girls and ya mama
Wanna stay a whole month, you can stay long as you wanna
