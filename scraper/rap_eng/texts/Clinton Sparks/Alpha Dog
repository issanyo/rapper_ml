[Verse 1]
Clap until your hands hurt
Standing ovations or (boo-boo-boo) boos
Wa-watch us until we blur
Walk off into the sunset

Tell rock n' roll I'm alone again
I wanna put the Midwest home again
Your time has passed, they say never means never
Solar flare stares won't last, but never means forever
Never means forever

[Chorus]
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh, Omega-megalo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac

[Verse 2]
We must have the best coats
Tell the best jokes
We must make it hard to look so easy
Doing something so hard

You must see my wink
They squint when they look at me
I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a star
Oh, I'm a star

[Chorus]
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh, Omega-megalo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac

[Bridge]
You're not the first or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand, "I'm just fine"

You're not the first or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand

[Chorus]
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh, Omega-mega-lo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac

[Outro]
Whoa, oh, whoa
(Abracadabra)
Whoa, oh, whoa
