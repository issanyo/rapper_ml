[Hook]
Look at us now, look at, look at us now (x4)

[Intro]
We the ones you see up on them billboards
And we the ones that's buying things you can't afford
And I know it fucking kills you, but you gotta get familiar

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Just think of all the times you wasted hating on my grind
You put respect and work into it, but now you're so behind
Look at you, you fucking loser
I'm so awesome, how much did that cost?
Don't worry man, you're future's looking blurry man
You get halfway to where I am, you just better hurry man
Cause I show no signs of slowing down
When I'm in the spot, you know it's going down
Wheels up, about to leave the ground
When I'm in the UK, [?] make sure I get paid in pounds
Hit me when I get back in
Don't want a handout, then what the fuck you asking?
I remember back when you said I was whack and constantly you bashing
But now you know I'm smashing, and you trying to get your ass in
[?], but inside I'm just laughing
You go and talk, but I know the real reason
I got a cold, man, and this is "fuck you" season
Do me a favor: just ignore me when you see me
I ain't handing out no freebies, if you turn on your TV then you can

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Wow, look at me now
Check out my style, look how I get down
Wow, look at your girl, she checking me out when you ain't around
Wow, look at her smile, she talking about dome, I like how that sound
Wow, look at her now, she open her mouth, I watch it go down
Mmm, ah, USDA
That means upside down always
My niggas pull up a whole bunch of Audis, y'all niggas pull up a whole bunch of Hondis
I make the styles, y'all niggas just copy
Mmm, ah, watch 'em just jock me
Knocking 'em out like I'm Rocky
Swallow the lead like Gaddafi
[?], swag like I'm Kriss Kross
Copped the coupe, took the lifts off, dropped the top then dipped off
My girl's foreign like Joan of Arc
Keep two of those, like Noah's Ark
And that's cause I ball like Michael Jordan
You niggas more like George [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
Now go and drop it lower, this is how I get to know her
Got her in the palm of my hand like remote controllers
Running through that green like mowers, throw money like I owe her
She say "what's the hype about?"
I guess I'mma have to show her, yeah
Walk in the spot like we running the town
She drop it low till she's touching the ground
Shaking it for me, I'm throwing this money and making her love me
I'm shutting it down
Mike Stud, yeah that's me ho
Do the breaststroke with your bitch, but we ain't finding Nemo, no
Clinton hit me, now I got Clinton with me
Probably why I got all these pretty bitches sitting with me, getting with me
Giggity, giggity
Now I'mma make history, high as Yosemite, got an epiphany
Let's sippity till we get lit like a Christmas tree
I'm on a roll, ho, moving in slow-mo
My life is crazy, yours like J.D., it's just so-so
Now the things I used to dream about are finally getting realer
And if you ain't know about me, you should probably get familiar

[Hook]
