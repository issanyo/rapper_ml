[Bahamadia]
You're not dealin with the typical
I'm Queen Order in the physical
Original worshippin a little real sense to the art symbol
Keepin you in traditional lacin the listener
With principles like it's medicinal in addition to
Numeral recordables that be sellin me to the pentacle
Of being lucid, so I never come elusive
Truths I get loose with that amuse it then use it
To captivate the youth through my creative juices
Daily come students on my school of thought not ever truant
So enter into language and the oral I speak fluent
Be.. when I shine

"I see my influence still shinin"

Heads out there babblin
Life is a gamble and you've gotta hustle
My methods various ways to cut you
When exercisin my vocal muscle
Give back to my people through song cause I love to
Not just an actor ? capitalizin upon the struggles
Of stringin along the troublesome
Overstate my purpose as bein one who comes to provide a little hope
For them play my position, to the fullest on intuition
Drop a jewel or two but tricks are for whoever wanna listen cause
I can't distort vision of those completely blind
So I keep that in mind, when I shine, knahmsayin?
Teach those who wanna be taught
Craft fluid within the beats y'all

"Stereophonic or mono my lingo tingle topics revolve.."
"I see my influence still shinin"

"Stereophonic or mono my lingo tingle topics revolve.."
"No doubt"

Presentin dark sounds, cause we in some crucial time now
And I'm tryin to leave a mark before they place me in the ground
Holdin it down, much deeper now than before
Mature, rhetoric to even out the score
Detour, what was once considered hardcore
To counteract the efforts of these pseudo-thugs and whores
Armageddon's a brain war, and I command more
Willin to have my frame torn for what I stand for
For, at least for my belief the substance intertwine
Exert from my bloodline, to shine, one more time
At least for my belief the substance intertwine
Exert from my bloodline, to shine

"Stereophonic or mono my lingo tingle topics revolve.."
"I see my influence still shinin"
"No doubt"
