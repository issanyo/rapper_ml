[Black Thought]
Rock on to the break of dawn, freak on to the early morn'
Kadafi and Soufon, you got it goin' on
To my man Big Sean, you got it goin' on
Now, yo, you got The Roots in the house
We also got Bahamadia in the house, representin' lovely
With ya ears, now, proceed
It's flavor you wouldn't believe, as we proceed

[Hook x2: Black Thought]
I shall (I shall), proceed (proceed)
And continue (and continue), to rock the mic (to rock the mic)

[Verse 1: Malik B]
Let's kill all the small talk and just elaborate
The Roots collaborate, I see myself as rather great
How the words generate
Whole crews disintegrate when I penetrate
As if in the course flow with intensive force
You best to go and check your source about my textual chords Simplicit, yo, it sounds complex, you might miss it
But after you critique it, you can kiss it
I'm assistin' fire force that leaves statistics
When I identify, niggas simplify, you'll feel no sympath-i
My lyrics send you on a permanent excursion
I never would decide when your lifespan was submergin'
My style is urban, not suburban when I'm splurgin'
Gosh, these MC's, I wash more than detergent
I can split the Red Sea when deadly
Take heed, Illadelph style while I proceed

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Bahamadia]
Bahamadia hits the melodies mellowly, brand newbie
Funk doobie, choosy with the tactics when I gets Raw
Like Dice, nice with the flavor, Do You Want More?!!!??!
Of the Organix, pure eargasmatic, from Distortion to Statics Automatic, systematic, I'm nasty at it
So, hand me the five microphones like you did Illmatic
One time 4 the mind
Rhymes be comin' from an Illadelph state of mind
The realest, not whole or half time, all the time
And I shall proceed, I'm movin' on, baby, I shall proceed
To remain on point like an infrared beam
Succeed in chasin' out the ultraviolet dreams
No Mas like Shorty, 'cause it's all about me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Black and handsome, holdin' MC's for ransom
Thoughts command some, is this, a phantom?
Crews I mangle, y'all know my anthem ain't the Star Spangled
I hit you from the most bizarre angle
Rectangular visions of papes my mind conceives
Motivatin' me to achieve, thus, I must proceed
When I ride the train, traumatized to maintain
When laid back, the tracks can relax the brain
I got to deal with everythin' on this intelligent plain
Servin' as a killer to the pain, I live a High Life like Miller
Me and the mics mechanized
Respect, recognize, loop mind beyond wise
Limitless, when I bless the mic with speed
Dialect never weak, y'all niggas know Tariq
From 7th, the Snyder Ave. got the flavor you need
For the ingredients, indeed, so to the lead, I shall proceed

[Hook x4]
