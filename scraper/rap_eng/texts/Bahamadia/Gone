[Verse 1: T3]
Uhh, it's the trill man , tell 'em how I feel man
We top like standing on ceiling

Put the dirt right on top they on they tale end
Went for trailing to highest in the sales and
Getting paper down here quicker than mail man
Now the haters going hate us cause they failing

Skip the convo, Back to the drawing board 
How fuck you cut a tree with lawnmower
How the fuck you can't see we on the grind more

[Verse 2: Young RJ]
Young J, Seventh son, crate digger
Mind's portrait masterpiece painting pictures
The weapon and the arsenal the bomb
That make you break your neck that dirty slums
Top shelf Remy VS, no room for the B.S
Be careful cause my niggas will get extra
All you hard soft nigga's need a new texture
Showtime act up I'm a play Dexter
You nigga's mad you can't beat me
Mad cause you can't be me
I'm right in your face but you can't see me
Like Ray or Stevie
Or Jose Feliciano , you're blind baby blind to the facts
I got a battle axe that shatter cataracts
So you can see clear
We ain't them it's SV yeah
Bring the pressure, I'm in the upper echelon
I'm killinh this shit I'm done

[Hook]

[Verse 3:BAHAMADIA]
Through out the stratos, ora dominates the planets, so celestial with it, sky is not the limit
Whole approach angle and quotes, guarantee we winning
Here them sukas on the sidelines , sour like some lemons, they all scrimmage
In the game certified plays, focus on different ways how to monetize everything
My name main stay , make a couple bells ring
No chick attempt to merge in my lane, fucking with the queen
That's on everything, and I'm part time these days
Whenever I engage , pick choice what I do, when it's applicable
Proper protocol how you move when you rule
Surface unexpectedly at the helm and resume , then lay a cause propagating truth
Cause I'm always in tune , to what's true ,salute

[Hook:T3 Kam Corvet Action Figures]
We like gone , gone, gone,gone, gone yeah, yeah, yeah
We like gone, gone, gone, gone, gone yeah, yeah, yeah
Can we ,take things ,further than they seem
And let the choir say (La, La ,LA)
And let the choir say (La, La ,LA) you know we gotta uh, you know we got right
(LA,La,LA,)you know we gotta uh, you know we got right you know we gotta uh, you know we got right
So strap your wings on a cause we ready for flight
