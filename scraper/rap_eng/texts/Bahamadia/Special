[Hook] [Phonte]:
Close your eyes and try to think about
All the things you can't live without
Make you laugh and cry without a doubt
Baby that's what makes it so
(Special for you)
So
(Special for you)
So
(Special for you)
So
(Special for you)

[Verse One] [Phonte]:
Yo, like looking in the eyes of your lady
After both of y'all been looking into the eyes of your baby
Fresh newborn, fresh suit on, all we want is just to thank God for what he done gave me
For helping get a definite, goodbye to your maybes
My last will and testament got excellent makings, of a TV show
Or a full length feature film
Back in the day, they didn't even want to speak to him
So my mentality is sink or swim
You got to wade in the water and stay afloat
Even if your boat cross over to the deeper end
And think that I would ever stop, nigga think again
I thank God for the gift of this music
Hoping He uses songs we write as a weapon of peace
Every time we create it's like a blessing to me
Might mean nothing to you, but it's special to me so feel me

[Hook] [Phonte]:
Close your eyes and try to think about
All the things you can't live without
Make you laugh and cry without a doubt
Baby that's what makes it so
(Special for you)
So
(Special for you)
So
(Special for you)
So
(Special for you)
