Verse One:
Word life boo, I checked you flexin wit' cha crew
Lookin sweet enough to chew wit them saint eyes like tha brew
Roughneck mannerism, fly disposition
Ya live like channel sparkin' like mad-izm
My mission, is gettin into you like a religion
My woman's intuition tells me cupid's arrow's hittin
You're the prince with the glass slipper that my foot could fit in
This feelin that I have is never endin, I'm sendin, my love like
Zhane' up
In a box
With the bow up on the top, cause, for you I got the hots so
Please accept these feelings I posess i'm like a damsel in distress in
Pursuit of happiness, I confess

Chorus: I've been really tryin' baby
Tryin to hold back these feelings for so long
And if you feel, like I feel baby
Come on, ohhh, come on

Verse Two:
Many men wit mass appeal expand across the globe by the mills
But still I picked you like a daffodil
Cause you thrill me like magnetic fields that give my body chills
Perserve my chocolate ties and it's a thrill; I'm sayin
That when you swing my way I, get a sudden rush
That entices me not to keep it on the hush-hush
Boy times girl times lust equals us
And you can count on that like you would an abacus so
Bust the equation, baby cause I'm facin the fact that I only think of
You
On two occasions, but I'ma max once I get this off my chest, and just
Let
Nature do the rest..
I confess
Chorus

Verse Three:
I wanna be down like brandy with you handy for tha duration
Engage in electric relaxation
Build a conversation, probe ya intellect
Put ya manhood to the test, but not just ya physical, ya individual is
What
I'm after
Ya heart I wanna capture, I'm open like a space that NASA explores
Truly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is born
But I could go on and on throwin hints
That I'm tha chick, you should be celebratin life wit
So instead I felt it best if I just
Stood and represented in the flesh
That I confess...
Chorus
