[Verse 1]
Straight outta the metro rhythm central
I'm innovative at the intro, 'cause I go slow mo'
But never slow pulse
But never no joke, dope
But never no coke
Spits the riddles like phlegm
Loose with my lyrics like a double jointed them
Twist and I bend, common episodes past freak modes
The monstrous bass beneath my pace be like morse code
Slash, beep, slash, beep, scanners
Zero in to the system in your jeeps
I'm out there with Kool Keith and Ced-Gee and De La
Inventors of my third seeing eye
The futuristic vision, I'm not among loony nut cakes upon a mission
I gets in where I fit in, 'cause life's too short
So you could all label me weirdo, but yo
I know it's talent

[Hook]
Mad explosive spontaneity

[Verse 2]
At present I speak the new
Beginning when every other trend fell short
So who'll be the shareholder of my kinda thoughts besides the studious
'Cause the gluteus maximus lack ability
To scoop all capabilities of spontaneity within me
Depicted kicked it true
Vibes pops jazz but collaborated with the cool
Known flows, but unfamiliar grooves that soothe
Individuals' moods like soul food for thought

[Hook]
Mad explosive spontaneity

[Verse 3]
Rip here be dizz like everybody's on it
'Cause eternal verbal expansion
Keeps enhancing brainchild's ability to like surpass a swarm of booty
Ass, no grass roots having ass MCs with lukewarm degrees
Trying to get hot like sun rays, but save your jazz for Sun Ra
You know I wanna spar
My skills fill up the outer limits like Mars and you's a little star
I jacked your twinkle when I excelled well
Like Tinkerbell up to higher levels and heights
Cerebral flow takes flight on airborne time
I'm a prime candidate of specimen in your Walkman as you're listening
I make things happen, 'cause I'm the captain, keepin' this great

[Hook]
Mad explosive spontaneity
