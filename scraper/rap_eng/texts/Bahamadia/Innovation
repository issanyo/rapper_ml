[Verse 1]
Flam, combustion
Thrustin' new versions of verses over kids heads like halos
Bendin' their brain cells like indo
Innovation
Definition: different renditions of creations
Sorta like what I'm doin', styles that I be usin'
Wordsmith meets rap fusion
If that's a category fit for Grammy like Source Awards
Then competitors bet-tor look out like Pack Jam once I record
Innovation
The first to influx information no relation to wackness
Instead pedantic - combating prose with passionate passages
Surpassing the realm of gun-toting savages
However, able to serve them like Mr. Belvedere once confronted
They don't ever want it, 'cause I got my Freestyle Fellowship membership
But I will still get fit to ace you alone
I-N-N-O-V-A-tion...

[Verse 2]
Presentation original
Ways of thinking rational
Ready for consumption to each one suckered in
Or rather lured by each lyric
Contoured to the complexity of innovation
I-N-N-O-V-A-tion
Bicoastal vernacular enables one to become, a phenomenon
A sensation accompanying pa-rump-pa-pum-pums
Innovation, innovation, innovation, innovation

[Verse 3]
Finer degrees or shall I say meters of rap and poetry
Combined to make this one topic of discussion
You heard that shit innovation?
Bahamadia must be one of the last pioneers in captivity
Linking vocal tones and microphones to holy matrimony
Each song composed in ritual type ceremonies
For sight exceeds that of modern day prophet Rambonie
I-nn-o-va-tion-nn-o-va-tion, I-nn-o-v-a-tion
