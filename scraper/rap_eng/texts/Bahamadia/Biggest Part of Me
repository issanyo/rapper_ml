[Verse 1: Bahamadia]
Pleasurable acts navigated hearts strings
Steady with the grace of God and formed an entity
Out of puppy love greeted by a choice
Now body employs a bundle of joy
Journey onto motherhood instantly begins
Precious from conception was this little life within
Delicate and special, open arms are welcomin'
Initiative from mommy to secure your innocence
Life centers around you like the rings on Saturn
You make it divine 'cause you're sweet as saccharin
And I'mma shower you with love until infinity
As long as I breathe you get the biggest part of me

[Chorus]
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me

[Verse 2: Bahamadia]
I service and protect, guide and direct
Share quality time with you and never neglect
Any part of you because I have no regrets
Will always be around even if your daddy jets
Providing you with confidence to step out in the world aware
That you could make it 'cause you have someone who cares
On stand by with patience and a smile
God bare my witness, cross my heart and hope to die
Or rest, just in case you haven't guessed
The essence of my presence to insure you have the best
And I just really hope you understand
That for you I'll do everything I can
I'mma shower you with love for infinity
As long as I breathe you get the biggest part of me

[Chorus]
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me

[Verse 3: Bahamadia]
A wonderful addition to the population
Your every waking moment is my inspiration
Truly I am blessed from one day to the next
Life line connects to a positive effect
You've molded all my idle time and gave it purpose
I dedicate the world to you until my final rest
Cradle to the grave I'mma always be in debt
'Cause you're my saving grace and valuable as [?]
So I'mma shower you with love for infinity
As long as I breathe you get the biggest part of me
I'mma shower you with love for infinity
As long as I breathe you get the biggest part of me
For real

[Chorus]
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me
I wanna shower you, I wanna shower you, shower you with love
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me
Forever and ever and ever and ever
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me
Until infinity I wanna shower you with love
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me
My pride and joy baby
As long as I breathe way down deep inside
You're the biggest part of me
