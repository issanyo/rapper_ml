CHORUS [Frankie Ano] {Bahamadia}
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
"For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
"Check it, one time" {Bahamadia}
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
"For Frankie Ano" to drop a gem on mine
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
"Check it, one time" {Bahamadia}

[Bahamadia]
As the clock keeps ticking in this hip hop shit
My main objective is to float way above the average
State of MCing by a thorough thought out elaborate
Speech reaching the multitude standing form of what I believe in
My all races of heaven for the one who's truth seeking
Be the vessel for messages so far without preaching
Before knowledge of self I walk through darkness like a heathen
Had a 3.5 GPA in ???? for teaching
Then my lust of words start giving life new meaning
Strengthen of my inner regions so my aura could be beaming
Fertilise my creation like ovaries to semen
Spit rhyme for reason, clinging to my up bringing
Spirit got to be that when I first pledge allegiance
Thus spawning the lessons in the song I be singing
Thus spawning the lessons in the song I be singing
I got for what I know to help the growth of human beings

CHORUS

[Frankie Ano]
I advertise like a poet, paint a picture when I flow it
Drop a gem on you then, all you party people know it
That I'm not a mere mortal, but extraordinary human
Amazing with the microphone, plus the music I be doing
Is I like, still the finest, like blue note jazz
Your royal highness, king poetic flavour of the rhyme list
I insist you close lips and pay homage
To me, Bahamadia and for the way we drop knowledge
Hot like peppermint, ultraviolet I spit
It's big like the bang theory, or when Adam start to spit
The champion, individually inspired son
Approach me with steady caution like the new millenium
Radiate, I see your eyes lit with grave concern
Recordable like CD-R when the shhh start to burn
Nowhere to run from when words sprung like volcanic ash
So somewhere in the future they can find you in the past

CHORUS

[Bahamadia]
Spit reality rap over this Frankenstein track
Recorded reported facts of an urban inhabitant
This is my, brain on wax, instead of mesculin or smack
Evade the ghetto death traps by using my thinking cap
Then drop, a gem and immortalise it
Any verse I use is a virtual patient
General thoughts so strong they linger on like a fragrance
Relate the folks from many walks of life and all ages
And all places and all stages, when all phases
Lend you a hand if your vision were ever jaded
For as the future cop me as one who try to save it
The impact of this music really ain't nothing to play with

[Frankie Ano]
See, I'm super fly paper, get you stuck on any subject
The hip hop president of this republic
I know you love it, don't fight it
Find peace before it fucks with your head, sort of like the Middle East
I break the lease and get bent on rappers to pay rent
Try to overthrow my government it ain't going to happen
I'm a real brother with a lasting impression
Forcing dedicated rappers to just quit their whole profession
No question on the mission verbal oral expedition
Wise words formulate the deadly verbal lyricism
I'm a Scorpio, but drop a gem on eyes
Stand clear from my dears is what I always advise
Cause

CHORUS
Looking at my Gucci it's about time
To drop a gem on mine
