[Chorus x 2]
When they pumpin' in the jeeps, it's gonna rock right - true
In the streets it's gonna rock right - true
At the shows it's gonna rock right - true
Here we go wit the butters boo u know how we do

[Verse 1: Bahamadia]
Landscapin' mentally shapin'
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Represent my peoples on the Ill-a-del side
Live like my '93 shit, Funk Vibe
I used imagination like HanSoul
Master like vic with the off beat flow
A lady like B in the Ster-Re-Erio-O
Raps way back at the plat with super bad disco
Used to do the freak the Patty Duke and Giggalo
After midnight on the weekend (ho!)
You remember we 3D with Steady B
'Nuff respect go to Yvette Money
P.S.K. Miz on pause, delay
MC Jewel T ride the crossfade
Breeze from the bottom discombobbaboobalate
Cerrone was a Da Break if you was Diggin' in the Crates

[Chorus x 2]
When they pumpin' in the jeeps, it's gonna rock right - true
In the streets it's gonna rock right - true
At the shows it's gonna rock right - true
Here we go wit the butters boo u know how we do

[Verse 2: Bahamadia]
Da Youngstas be makin' Crewz Pop
Divine Beings got the true Sound of Hip-hop
Man called Lux flipped on the boom box
Mad propz to ruggedness lyrical terrorists
Funky rhymin' like E-B-S
Nation with 'em nigs Snooze B and Jazz Fresh
Easin' back and let it hit'cha
Rumbeltown mixture, murder with the hypnotic rude girl
Back to back, Ghetto 'pon the scratch
Battle star galack cosmic abstraxx
The first out the Limo was the nigga Charlie Mack
West Phils represent K-D where's it at
'Cause we not takin' no shorts more
Yuup-Yupp to the rebels to Pan and Dice Raw
