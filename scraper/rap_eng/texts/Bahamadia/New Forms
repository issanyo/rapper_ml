Proper...

[Verse 1: Bahamadia]
Proper introduction
Fluctuation and vocalization at warp speed
Heat style with this style of producing
A little bit purist
You ought to receive screens and encores for high-class tour pleasure
In the form of freestyle in style put it on down
Et cetera, measure the
Contents that can then concoct some new catchy phrases
The outcome of a mind that's ageless while yours is senseless
Kids from the UK to LA through a freakishness that made
Bahamadi-di
Epitome of MC

[Verse 2: Bahamadia]
Melodic. Logic. Types
Limericks to raw forms to form form
New forms of movement into new on-on-on into millenium
Live swing like pendulum
Pure soul m-m-maximum
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
You got me high-high-high-high-high
Best height for the next epic

[Hook: Bahamadia]
Feeling so high, high
Feeling so...
