[Verse 1: Mr. Lif]
Pardon me, so rude to not introduce
My name is Lif, I'm raw and I be gettin' loose
On the M. I. - the "C". is just a sickle I use
To perforate the neck and pop the head with the noose
Beheaded rappers, usually indebted rappers
Factors they miscalculated left them all annihilated
I'm overskilled and understated
Often under rated overlooked because the market's over saturated
I'm fascinated with this fabricated
Reality we're living in, so imprisoning
A far cry from what I was envisioning
They took freedom and made it limited, imminent
Doom awaits, hardships accumulate
Assuming you relate to this glimpse of human fate
Open your eyes, be wise and speak truth
Vivid with expression when you're representing you

[Chorus: Mr. Lif]
Stress levels like you wouldn't believe
Yo I need some relief, everybody just breathe
Stress levels like you wouldn't believe
Yo I need some relief, so I've gotta just breathe
Stress levels like you wouldn't believe
Yo I need some relief, everybody just breathe
Stress levels like you wouldn't believe
Yo I need some relief, everybody

[Verse 2: Bahamadia]
What's good? I'm Baham from the West side of Philly
The woman know for globally transmitting rediculous syllable flipping for the last decade and some change for a living
All about cultivating "A alike" energy and building
Borderline backpack but I still stack cash
I'm an entrepreneur, I don't rap just to rap
Don't get me twisted or confused
With the typical indie artist who be singing the blues
I'm not that shrewd in fact when it pertains to my business
I have paid my dues, I am in this game to win it
All the false humility I've been witnessing is sickening
It clashes with a broad like me
One of the realest most qualified to expose what the deal is
Call it how I see it in a minute
Can't be fearful or timid in a leadership position
Aspire to advance anything other than that is bullshittin'

[Chorus: Bahamadia]
Stress levels like you wouldn't believe
Yo I need some relief, everybody just breathe
Stress levels like you wouldn't believe
Yo I need some relief, so I've gotta just breathe
Stress levels like you wouldn't believe
Yo I need some relief,  everybody just breathe
Stress levels like you wouldn't believe
Yo I need some relief, everybody
