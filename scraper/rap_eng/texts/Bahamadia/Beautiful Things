[Verse 1]
Every time I pick up a paper or turn on the tube a news flash
Another youth passed school ground's a bloodbath
Politicians caught in sex scams
Major sports figures in and out of rehabs
Holy war with Jews and Arabs
Recalls and cutbacks feature story go to those who gay bash
Bulimic and anorexic actors and actresses swapping secrets on their freakiest fetishes
Pedophile predators on the internet
Numerous reports of preteen sex
Thirty second updates on side effects of modern medicine
Rap veteran turned convicted felon
Domestic violence rate excelling
Embezzlement the deficit negligence
More serial killings gang related death still in existence
Mosquitoes dead crows and the viruses that they're inflicted
With road rage incidents it's sickening

[Hook]
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Talk about beautiful things a little bit

[Verse 2]
JonBen√©t Ramsey chaos mayhem
Tragedy Kosovo victims

Phen Phen and Herbalife may not reduce calories
Corporate downsizing cut wages and salaries rich men catching bodies get away on technicality
Collagen injection lyposuction plastic surgery
Organized crime bosses depicted as martyrs
Child care slaying underage baby aborters
Authorities do search and seize without court orders
Unlawful acts caught on camcorders
Pollutants in the water
Suicide manslaughter father preforming incest on his daughters
Drug lords combatting over street corners
Hit and run arson prey on senior citizens
Gossip columnists feed off lies and who be living 'em
Note to commentator while you at the podium
Present us wit some healthy options

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Media slogan we uphold negative promotion
To pigeon hole attention of the weak and the hopeless
Telling lies through vision thinking no one is decoding it
Few who do will get discredited for even noticing
No wonder generation X remains emotionless
Misinformed then entertained on ignorance by hypocrites
Circulating seediness validated by leadership
Whose primary motive is to make the public more obedient
Everybody plays the fool
Sometimes the main ingredient used in ploy confirming what was stated previous
But if the anchor realizes his position is a gift
He'd truly honor what his mission is

[Hook]
