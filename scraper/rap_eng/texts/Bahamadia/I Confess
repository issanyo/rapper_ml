[Verse 1: Bahamadia]
Word life boo, I checked you flexin' wit' cha crew
Lookin' sweet enough to chew with them saint eyes like tha brew
Roughneck mannerism, fly disposition
Ya live like channel sparkin' like mad-izm
My mission is gettin' into you like a religion
My woman's intuition tells me cupid's arrow's hittin'
You're the prince with the glass slipper that my foot could fit in
This feelin' that I have is never endin', I'm sendin'
My love like Zhane' up in a box
With the bow up on the top 'cause for you I got the hots so
Please accept these words that I posess
I'm like a damsel in distress in pursuit of happiness, I confess

[Hook]
I've been really tryin' baby
Tryna hold back these feelings for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Come on, ohhh, come on

[Verse 2: Bahamadia]
Many men with mass appeal expand across the globe by the mills
But still I picked you like a daffodil
'Cause you thrill me like magnetic fields that give my body chills
Perserve my chocolate ties and it's a thrill; I'm sayin'
That when you swing my way I get a sudden rush
That entices me not to keep it on the hush-hush
Boy times girl times lust equals us
And you can count on that like you would an abacus so
Bust the equation, baby 'cause I'm facin' the fact that I only think of you
On two occasions, but I'mma max once I get this off my chest
And just let nature do the rest... I confess

[Hook]
I've been really tryin' baby
Tryna hold back these feelings for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Come on, ohhh, come on

[Verse 3: Bahamadia]
I wanna be down like Brandy with you handy for the duration
Engage in electric relaxation
Build a conversation, probe ya intellect
Put ya manhood to the test, but not just the physical
The individual is what I'm after
Ya heart I wanna capture, I'm open like a space that NASA explores
Truly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is born
But I could go on and on throwin' hints
That I'm tha chick, you should be celebratin' life with
So instead I felt it best if I just
Stood and represented in the flesh that I confess

[Hook]
I've been really tryin' baby
Tryna hold back these feelings for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Come on, ohhh, come on

[Outro]
From the bottom of my heart I wanna confess to you
Let me show you how I feel to let you know that this feeling is real
I wanna confess to you baby, confess to you sugar
