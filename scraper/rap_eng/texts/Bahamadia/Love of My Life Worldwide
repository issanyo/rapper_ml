[Intro]
Don't you give up! Keep goin', keep goin', keep goin', uh
Don't you give up! Keep goin', keep goin', keep goin', uh
If you're not ready, you'd better get yourself together
Funk you up, we gon' funk you up

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
Love of my life!
Ring, ding, dong, ring-a, ding, ding, dong
Ring, ding, dong, ring-a, ding, ding, dong

[Verse 1: Erykah Badu]
Freak, freak, da freak, da funk, funk; separate the good stuff from the junk
And then I bang, bang, the bump, the bump girl
My name is Apples and I rock your world
Worldwide, do your math -30, 26, 36 and a 1/2
I hope that you will realize
I got the hazel eyes that make you nitrified
Step in the back and step to the front
Come alive y'all I'll give you what you want
The rhymes I got plenty; degrees 120
And if you want some then jump the fuck in it

[Hook]
Love of my life!
Ring, ding, dong, ring-a, ding, ding, dong (jump the fuck in it)
Ring, ding, dong, ring-a, ding, ding, dong
Love of my life!
Ring, ding, dong, ring-a, ding, ding, dong
Ring, ding, dong, ring-a, ding, ding, dong

Big girl, big trucks, big whips, whip up

Before I bring you into this zone

Things gotta change up

Can't stop, won't stop, rockin' till I die
As I flip the Hip Hop drops on ya

[Verse 4: Bahamadia]
What's the deal? My name's Bahamadia
Ain't no chick in the game who get it done like me
Huh, I've been chosen by G.O.D
To show the whole world the meaning of MC
Look, I be in dope with a thing called hip hop
People together like b-boy in shell tops
And it don't stop because we can't quit
I wanna getcha, it's built in the up lift
I beat dawgs wit microphone disiss
Soloist with the iller dope accent
A livin' legend, baby throw me on the track and
I'm guaranteed, Bahamadia get it crackin'

[Bridge]
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up
Sit back down!

Funk you right on up
We gon' funk you right on up
