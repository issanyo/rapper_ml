I could paint a pretty picture, of pigment of painted scriptures
Of bitches eyes on your riches
Black tainted love in them mixtures
Ah, it's like Picasso, in this bitch
Female Pac up in this bitch I'll apocalypse your shit
Rejoicing the thoughts of putting these bitches bodies in hearses
My mission embody ambition like Nazi ignition
And body all curses, no shawty's in purses
Cause I keep a couple shooters that will straight John Gotti your purpose
These bitches ain't real, they just real clown bitches
I remember when they used to feel like real down bitches
I'm from a city where respect don't come from currency
And I don't wanna hear what you gonna do, what you done currently?
15, left home to get my money right
All I knew was hustle bitch, you see what my money like?
But I can still smell 'em potent broke memories
Guess that's how God kept me grounded like "Oh, remember these?"
Now it's just me and my nigga, I'm the Bonnie to his Clyde
And I ride for my nigga, oh
And all you snake ass, fake ass, hating ass, hoes
Was just waiting for a bitch to blow
Just to pin point my pivotal pinnacles
From my pitfalls I pity y'all, y'all pity fool
I pity the fool that pic y'all
No question though, I be on that other shit
Like fuck that ho I'm on a mission Joe
You should too, if you knew what this game will do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Been picking through the bullshit I seen through
No Biggie though, I'm on some real shit
So really though, my mother need a new house
Trying to put my brother through college so that shit y'all talk about
I could give a fuck about it
