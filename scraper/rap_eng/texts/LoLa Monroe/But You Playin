[Intro](King Los)
Hey, what up?
Watchu into?
True, True
We-well you know i was trynna see you
Oh alright, you goin out witcha home girls
No doubt, i can dig it


[Mario]
This could be us but you playin
This could be us but you playin
This could be us but you playin

[Lola Monroe]
I still been drinkin the on low, hustling on the low
Acting on the low, catch a flight, fly back, im on the go
I be in for the check like nike i.d
How i dance around the border shit i might be ali
Likely i be out of reach of rookies
Need v.i.p suites and a beach to put me
Funny thinking that a speech can hook me
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
(Queen) i handle these bitches
Being Mary Jane ass Scandalous bitches
Drop bands on these niggas
Tell em rub this pussy, I'll grant em three wishes
Big mamas, skip drama, get commas, grip lamas
In my right hand, only day ones never one night stands
Im put the ice band on your gold rollie
This could be us by you lyin like you dont know me
And you won't know me, if you keep on
Keep doing, your own shit, grown shit
Sincerely yours, the wrong bitch
To sleep on


[Mario]
This could be us but you playin


[Outro](King Los)
So you goin to the club tonight?, or nahh?
