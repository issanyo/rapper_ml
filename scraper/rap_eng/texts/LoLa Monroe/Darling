[Hook: Foo Fighters-Wiz Khalifa edit]

She took me to her castle
And I couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out and Lola started to grind

[Verse 1: Lola Monroe]

Where y'all bitches learn your manners
Bow down this is royalty
Soon to be empire, a dynasty,_______?
Royalty over riches
Business over bitches
__ ____? on the ends
So wash the dishes over ditches
Saved a couple broad
And made bitches, maid bitches
Went from green to green
With envy to shade switches
And the haters can't applaud you
They appalled by success
So dear suckers I vow to forever offend you
The lowest form of life
I could never commend you
Them condescending souls will never ascend through
So I pray for my enemies and only fear God
When Garfield call they'll have 'em prayin' dear God
Bitch I'm bossed up
Check the cash stack
They floss up
Get the stack back
What it cost, huh?
Doubleback that
Everybody wanna be somebody
But never been themselves
I'm beastin' bitches till I body what made 'em deceit themselves

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]

Y'all go make me fuck around and go and get brand new
I mean fuck it (fuck it) the couple brand new
My cash dun' flipped
Now the loop brand new
Buy Versace, Giussepe, _____? it
(can you?)
I be's on that Boss shit, Maybach, talk shit
That I don't gotta ask what the shoe cost shit
Awww shit made her put pussy for auction
Combatin' with my money should never have been a option
I spit in a padded room
My swag escape the mad house
My closet goin' schizo
I see why these bitches bad mouth
Me, in the contrast
You're nothin'(nothin', nothin'...)
___________?
You bluffin'
It's DC till the death of me
Where the fuck the referee
Got "Slip Knot" for these rookies
And some shirts that read "in memory"
Hah, I ain't a illa' bitch alive
They need a bow down when the realer bitch arrive
