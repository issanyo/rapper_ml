[Intro]
Watch out, BMW
Let's go

[Chorus]
Niggas turnin into bitches, turnin into CO's
Turnin on they niggas, got the one in on the D-Lo
Put that money on they head (money on they head)
Money on they head (money money on they head)
[x2]

[Verse 1]
Okay, district of Columbia, burn ya like it's rum in ya
Or that bad bitch who told ya "let me just cum in ya"
I'm in here, harenge
Go over them like Bengay
Streets got these street lords crying to their sensei's
Like dear Lord forget me for sinning
With no fear Lord
I've been pouring this lotto
And they squeal Lord, I get toward it
And out here Lord
They escorting recordings like some real rules
I'm extorting importants at the clear port
So when they witnessing the evidence
You ain't bury a nigga, make that don't carry a figure
'Cause yo nigga getting life
And like you still buried yo nigga

[Chorus]
Niggas turnin into bitches, turnin into CO's
Turnin on they niggas, got the one in on the D-Lo
Put that money on they head (money on they head)
Money on they head (money money on they head)

[Verse 2]
[Juicy J:]
Hope you ain't plan on droppin the top (no sir)
Assassinate the nigga, John FK on the first shot
My little nigga in the cut, he ain't rolling nothing up
He gon take a nigga out right when they roll up
Mafia man, I put that call out on a nigga
Give a nigga one brick and he went out all on a nigga
I got bodies on me nigga and I don't never touch a trigger
Gotta watch where your feet go, my bitch fore you get yo issue
I was standing by yo mama when the hitman hit ya
I was still right there when they was singing we miss ya
Bitch I stay with guns, bitch I got it on me
Ain't no pussy niggas with me, real niggas only

[Chorus]
Niggas turnin into bitches, turnin into CO's
Turnin on they niggas, got the one in on the D-Lo
I got money on they head (money on they head)
Money on they head (money money on they head)
