[Verse 1: Teflon]
[?]

[Chorus 1]
Herba dis' a Herbman Hustling
Bright and Early in the morning

[Bridge 1: Keida]
We light this
We, We light this
Eye's just a bleed from the weed
We light this
We, We light this
Brush off the cherry and re-light it

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Wake up in the morning to the smell of some stacks
I know some hustlers that wake up to the smell of some crack
Cooking and Cooking
Leave them shivering and shooking
Ain't no over looking while we deliver them weapons
Ok now
I'm bout mine, so about mine
I goes hard never been a hoe about mine
Tell them suckers to get off my lolli pop
F&%(#ing with my hustle will get you molly whopped
Pull up in the Porsche get publicized for the public
I'm popping in every plug-in
Your population be bluffing
[?] thuggin
Ain't stopping nothing i'm thuggin
I'm plotting save em' i'm coming
To the top i'm taking their luck and
They gonna need more the a clover
Flat-line they hustle then it's over
I'm just illa
F&%* they killas
Set the new trends
So i stay realer

[Chorus 1]
Herba dis' a Herbman Hustling
Bright and Early in the morning

[Bridge 1: Keida]
We light this
We, We light this
Eye's just a bleed from the weed
We light this
We, We light this
Brush off the cherry and re-light it

[Verse 3: Justin Hibbert [i]]
F$%^ an O
Let's buy a pound
Connect work in any town
Breaking it down
Pass it around
Mike Vick on that down pound
F%^& the publicity
Prince Far i of the city
B$#@$ thick with some ti$%^es
My sh$# that loud
You some midi's
You boy's impatient
Single's sounding like demos
Cut your clones before they ready though
Cheefa the reefa and dro
F^&*$ the informer who told
You said you want weed song
So i went Taylor Gang yo
You n*%$!s some lame hoes
Dressed in plain clothes
Shit we smoking on got them mother f%$^&** knees froze
Knock you out cold, Deebo
It's friday where the rillo's?
Kushed up on some suede pillows
Tasting the rainbow on some skittles
So it's bright and early in the morning
Herbman hustling until we dead, this the mourning
With a G in the ash trey, these new ni%$#s passe
Aye, I got another blunt, who gonna match me?

[Chorus 1]
Herba dis' a Herbman Hustling
Bright and Early in the morning
