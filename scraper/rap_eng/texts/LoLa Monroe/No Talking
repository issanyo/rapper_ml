No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Perry on toast, over Mr. Chow lobsters
Pick a pow rauster, rich endowed postures
This entales monsters, the Chanel mobsters
This my addiction, if you listen I could coach you
I'm in the kitchen with these chicken and a roster
So why you're bitching 'bout bitches who don't approach you?
I got intentions to bitch ya just to provoke ya
Seven thirty savage out the chocha
Damage for the cabbage, I'm a vulture
Real niggas run everything but their mouths
Ya bitch real, she gon teach what king ain't about
I got G's that will stretch you like [?]
[?]
Or the AK, get you JFK, out of JFK
To the ICU, that's a [?] detour

[Chorus]
You already know what it's lookin like, yeah
You already know
I ain't got the time to be trippin'
Why they calling my line?
I don't do no talking
I don't do no talking
I don't do no talking
I don't do no talking

[Verse 2]
Cause see you all in your feelings
I feel like all of these villains
The black Claudia Felix
My niggas already willing
You putting the trust in the vault
Not no trust in the fraud
Cause these niggas be switchin like they be tuckin their balls
They used to duckin the law
[?]
Ain't no [?] so why you suckin them off?
Set on the work, tryna get to the plug
Minor [?] from the mugs, might hit your head with a slug
Get the fade, I ain't faded
When we got raided,  we paid it
It ain't debated, I made it
Dictated, stated, con-faded
I [?] and contained it
[?]
Hmmm heard you the muscle on the block?
Cause you raise heavy arms and be whippin on the pot
Well I be whippin off the lots
[?] dumb enough to double what a nigga gonna cop

[Chorus]
You already know what it's lookin like, yeah
You already know
I ain't got the time to be trippin'
Why they calling my line?
I don't do no talking
I don't do no talking
I don't do no talking
I don't do no talking
