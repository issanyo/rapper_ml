[Intro: Trina]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn the lights on
BITCH!
Matter of fact turn the lights off
Shit might blind you
Trina! Baddest bitch, yeah

[Hook:]
These niggas be actin' up
These niggas be actin' up
These niggas be actin' up
And these hoes be lettin' em
These niggas be actin' up
These niggas be actin' up
These niggas be actin' up
And these hoes be lettin' em

[Trina:]
Yeah, these niggas be actin' up
And y'all hoes been lettin' em
I break your favorite rapper, then replace his ass
Why y'all groupies be sweating him
I'll suppress his face til' he asphyxiate
I'll detonate and I'm taxing them
It's money over everything, fuck these niggas
Imma make 'em spend it all til' the mall close
Supreme bitch
And y'all bum hoes
My mortgage paid
And y'all foreclosed
That nigga in the strip club and he fucking your friends
You in denial, like
What he gotta lie for?
I'm a bad bitch
And my bag sick
And I ain't never, ever fuck a nigga basic
I make him take me to the bank
Pull up in a Bentley
And he never, ever gonna stick
A dick up in me
These niggas be acting up
And y'all hoes need to get tough
See I'm in the ghost
And I'm backin' up
You hoes lame
And I'm smart as fuck
I'm swerving porsches
And giving courses
How to lock that nigga
Know half his corpus
MGC we up in the building
And we leavin' ya'll niggas with no more choices

[Hook:]
(3D Na'Tee: Yo Trina what it is?
They already know what is when i'm in this bitch
The queen Bee, Na'Tee!)

[Verse 2: 3D Na'Tee:]
Boy you fucking with a diva
I don't save these dog ass niggas
Who I look like, PETA?
Get to ya knees like when you're talking to Jesus
Gimme head, when you finish you can get your sneakers
Bye!
My heart Coal like Keyshia
I wouldn't give you a spoon
If you was having a seizure
Only fuck with you on my leisure
Open my legs and get my eggs?
Bitch, this ain't Easter!
I could take a ho man, trust me!
While you chasin' little boys like Sandusky
He trickin' dough, try to knock me off
He got a better chance trying to hit the powerball
Sweepstakes, for Pete sake
Like Diddy bitch, I just want cheesecake
Why you treat fuck niggas like a keepsake
When he call my phone, all he hear is
Please Wait..

[Hook:]

[Lola Monroe:]
How you acting up in the Acura?
My vernaculars speak in stamps only
I pass ports (passports) with them lands on me
This ass gotten (ascot) in France homie
Fuck boy, I mean fuck boys!
I got a boy best friend that fuck boys
And he told me bout the sneaky ones
That like it in the booty
So they turn and do the kiki
Doing anything for Loubies
See, these niggas, be acting up
And ya weak bitches still shacking up
I got deep dishes on that platinum
Land o' lay screaming, begging them
Dick ridin', this wrist brightin' this bitch bitin' and still hypin'
I spit lightnin', they despisin' but despitin' it's inticin'
I'm coming!
If the money was Atheist
I'd still get across (a cross)
Employ these bitches
I still been a boss
Pro!
My league never had a play for a late bitch rookie
And these niggas drier than a fake bitch pussy
A Cup of Rose Maybach chauffeured
I ain't hanging up shit
Unless the rack sold furs
And the black sewed hurr (hair)
I'm a black Nola

[Hook:]
