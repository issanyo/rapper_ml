[Hook]
Band up (x8)
Yeah, I’m a baddie, I’m bout my change
Them bitches dusty, they chasin’ fame
Bossets, bossets, get band up (x2)
(Bum bitches to the left) (x4)
Bitch band up

[Verse 1]
I’m just rubberbanding these hundo’s
Flatscreen so big look like summer jam in my condo
Bitch I’m a star I just stand up and stack shit
I don’t fuck with squares, this ain't Spongebob and Patrick
I said the coupe got a grill like a China man
And all my bitches ball like Juwanna man
Hold up, bum bitches to the left
Somebody need to tell them dumb bitches to the back

[Bridge]
Band up (x8)
Now I might clean yo' man out, you and me we been different
You want a hand out, I hand out ass whippins
Okay, I OD, don’t make me K.O. these bitches
Then go fuck some racks off on some K.O.D. bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From the projects to the Grammy’s
Fix my makeup in a Lamby, sonnin’ bitches, no plan B
Ole free pussy ass bitches, make you fuck all of my dogs
I’m the hardest bitch in rap, fuck off of my balls
Where the heck is my block at? Where the hell is my town at?
Who let all of these clowns in? Where the fuck is my crown at?
Backtrack, backtrack, I done went and had a baby on you niggas
So you know I got that snapback, snapback
Bum bitch, back back, lemme band up

[Bridge + Hook]
