Chorus
[Lola monroe]
You gotta lick it,Before we kick it
You gotta get it soft and wet, so we can kick it
You gotta lick it,before we kick it
You gotta get it soft and wet,so we can kick it
[Kid ink]
I said damn you nasty I like it like that
I said damn you nasty I like it like that
I said damn you nasty I like it like that
I said damn you nasty I like it like that
I said damn you nasty, you nasty, you nasty
[Kid ink]
Ohhh, Ohhh, Damn you nasty(nasty)
Cameras out, flash me,if you don't mind me asking
That ass phat like soul food
And you know I got them collard greens on deck
She said let me see you toss it up
Like Pac n JodeciUnnnn
How many licks does it take to the center of the pussy pop
Eat it from the back , got her on lock
Call me the pussy cop
Leave you screwed up,Twist it all in a pussy knot
Now come and give it girl
Is you ready or not
Get a grip nice and firm
Make yo toes curl like perms
Back to the earth rebirth
You can call me big worm
Mic check 1, 2 boo
Did you like my performance...
Im going in, tongues out Jordan
Chorus
You gotta lick it, before we kick it
You gotta get it soft and wet, so we can kick it
You gotta lick it, before we kick it
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it
(Queen Roe)
I said damn you nasty, I like it like that
I said damn you nasty, I like it like that
I said damn you nasty, I like it like that
I said damn you nasty, I like it like that
I said damn you nasty, you nasty, you nasty
[Lola Monroe]
Getting topped off with the top chopped off
More mouth than a pop off
Eat my rock soft got my rock salt
He don't get the picture get em' cropped off
Yeah the pussy warm, but the head so cold
Fuck around suck the wood,bet the head gone go
Head slow moment
Halo,gone with Versace Cologne
And a pair of Polo's
Godamn, hop on it, in the morning, we boning
Excuse my lil' moaning, Im sooo in
Im gone and Hold a lil moment,cause he lost it
Got mo brain in the salad, but he tossed it
Now run that nigga like a boss bitch
(run that, run that nigga like a boss bitch)
Sex...Sweat...Dance...Euphoria...
Touch...Tease...Trance...Euphoria
(Chorus)
You gotta lick it, before we kick it
You gotta get it soft and wet, so we can kick it
You gotta lick it, before we kick it
You gotta get it soft and wet,so we can kick it
I said damn you nasty,I like it like that
I said damn you nasty,I like it like that
I said damn you nasty, I like it like that
I said damn you nasty, I like it like that
I said damn you nasty, you nasty, you nasty ohhh
