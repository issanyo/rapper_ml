[Verse 1: Lola Monroe]
He told me that he wanted to be
The only one I wanted to see
The way I'm moving it to the beat
Make 'em wanna fall in love with me (with me)
Fall in love with me (with me)
Fall in love with me (with me)
Fall in love with me (with me)
Make 'em wanna fall in love with me
I told him that I don't wanna go
I already been up and down that road
I met a million like you before
But I tell you one thing that we can do (we can do, we can do)
We can do (we can do, we can do)
We can do (we can do, we can do)
We can do (we can do, we can do)
But I tell you one thing that we can do

[Hook: Cassie]
You might have come at the right time
But I need somebody when I'm in the mood
I'm not tryna keep ya for the rest of a lifetime
Cause I need somebody when I'm in the mood
Cause I'm rather nice when I'm all alone
You could be there when I call on the phone
Don't need you to stop, will never recall
I just need somebody when I'm in the mood, yea

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Sorry little daddy I might get on dough
Oh don't get little snotty
But my ears say blow
No shade but these bitches low pay
Said the pussy po and they be used to little green
Tryna calf I'm just tryna be tight
I ain't guessing with that fuck to the brain
Damn now when they get down to be clap
He told me that I might be just
The girl of his dreams and his wife
Told him that can't be right
Cause I'm just gonna fuck up yo life (yo life)
Fuck up yo life (yo life), fuck up yo life (yo life)
That can't be right
Cause I'm just gonna fuck up yo life
Told him that's what I don't need
Just need someone to put on me right
When I tell him come over
And be with me on my lonely nights (lonely nights, lonely nights)
Lonely nights (lonely nights, lonely nights)
Lonely nights (lonely nights, lonely nights)
Lonely nights (lonely nights, lonely nights)
Be with me on my lonely nights

[Hook: Cassie]
You might have come at the right time
But I need somebody when I'm in the mood
I'm not tryna keep ya for the rest of a lifetime
Cause I need somebody when I'm in the mood
Cause I'm rather nice when I'm all alone
You could be there when I call on the phone
Don't need you to stop, will never recall
I just need somebody when I'm in the mood, yea

[Outro: Cassie]
(Yea)
You might have come at the right time
I'm not tryna keep ya
I'm not tryna keep ya
