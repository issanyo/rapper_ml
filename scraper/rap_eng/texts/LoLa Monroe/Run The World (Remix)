Hold up DJ you gon’ wanna run this back
When I run up on the track
Ain’t no Runner running that
I’mma Ray Rice run it baby
Ain’t no running back
It be ring around the Rosee
When I run up on that ass

Ashes and ashes thrown
That’ll be your remains when I dust that ass
That’s just them glasses on
Still see you snakes never trust that grass
Crashes and slashes gon
Hit this game when I ride up on it and bust that glass
Matches that last reason that you bitches finna panic and combust that fast

Need I break it down how I’m bigger than you
Nigga bigger business, need a bigger venue
Plus a bigger menu cause my figures done grew
Slicka, slicka vigor feel like the trigga done blew

I could tell you no biggie but things done changed
So really this a warning ‘fore you go deranged
When I kick in the door it be suicidal thoughts
You be ready to die pro’lly have it arranged

Now you know you dead wrong when you spit yo game
Praying on my downfall now you the bitch choking
Ever hit cocaine that’s what my high’s be like
Sky’s the limit, rise get fights and sizes gimmicks and
I see strikes, size and types of
Bitches with no heart
Vicious with no bark
Fuck was you made for
Like pictures with no art
My bitches is cold shark
Malicious with bold hearts
Pernicious with no thought
Caught all you whores
All you swore I won’t be more
And that was in the hood bitch I’m iller than before
Now you bitches sitting up there trynna build a new report

But no, I just keep it moving
My success is proven
While you niggas sleeping drooling
I’m getting closer to my crown
Who you bitches think you fooling
See the fear from my improving
I be doing some removing
Bitch I’m finna put it down, down, down, down, down

Self made bitch
Self paid bitch
No cosign for this pretty self paid whip
No cosign I done really self made it
And when they don’t salute shit self hatred

Lola Monroe hoe spit on a billi
The shoe game stupid the bag game illy
Cocaine coop in the shit sitting silly
Versace, Gavinchy I need about a trilli
Really my nomination got them tripping
I built this from the bottom, pimping
Only the beginning you ain’t gotta clap for it
Only the beginning bank on it back board
