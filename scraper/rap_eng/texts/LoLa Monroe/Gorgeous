951 Mercury coupe
Pent house embellished with luxury views
And we ain't neva trippin what it cost us
You should come parlay with some bosses
PJ to NY for a Jean George brunch
Valentino for the pump with a Tom Ford clutch
He said gorgeous what yo name is
You’re picture perfectly shining let’s frame this
Givin’ a vanguard i just stepped off
Maison martin margiela's line and just stack cards
If currency’s a concern let’s adjust that thought that's where you go fetch type hoes that must lack bars
Blacked out Maybachs and all white suits
I like um laid back with ball type loot
Don’t get it twisted, i ain't neva trippin’ doe
I’m at Tiffany’s for Breakfast sippin mo’
[Hook]
Gorgeous darling everything gorgeous
Flawless stones and two door Porsches
And we ain't neva trippin’ what it cost us
You are now in the presence of some bosses
Gorgeous x3
Everything gorgeous
Currently parlaying over currency
And it’s all looking gorgeous


Minks minks and more minks
Please send someone over to pour drinks
Cause been currently occupied with these Euros
While they occupations qualify these zeros
It’s money power whole lot of respect
My whole attire whole lot of effects
On rejects who detect the G check then reflect like we slept let's reset and re-step
Gold plated staples for these million dollar contracts
Billion dollar cases you gonna need a smaller compact
Hanging on these hoes and i don’t never call the palm back
My hustle be so historic that they’ll hang my dollars on plaques
Cavalli cavalli, embodied inside thee the watch be Bougatti zanotti this Notti
I ain't neva trippin’ though
I’m at Tiffany’s for breakfast, sippin’ mo’
