Drop top rollin', I'm reclinin' on these bitches
Batteries not included going diamond on these bitches
I done mastered every angle and the timin' on these bitches
Boss bitches world, now I'm shinin' on these bitches

Ok, it's funny how these slackers attackin' me, I pursue it
Maintaining my sanity through the tragedy, I've been through it
They actually go through agony, mad that she got a movement
Imagine me draggin' my feet on batteries not included

Bitches try and get back at me, I'm the factor exactly
Matter of fact you ain't half of me, manufactured and factoried
Plastic, I'm plastic, you playing I'm serious
So if you think I'm playing, just say my name if you curious

Your money varies, I'm very sorry my money various
Dummies squawking, but money talk like a therapist
You're arrogant and I'mma hand you that coffin
They mad I'm upfront, like handicap parkin'
In Austin, I'm lofting, flossin' and bossin'
I'm lost in the laws of a boss bitch, it's awesome
So follow me like the female 'Pac
The quarter crop and McQueens in a seashell drop
Hi hater, got my music, hi hater, can't hear you
Clear view of my future, with my city in the rearview
Stepped around the corner and saw death around the corner
Niggas tried to go left but got left around the corner

And it's real here
So pack ya steel if you're still here
So either ride, or get a ride in a wheelchair
Yea fuck a deal, I just deal with reality
Like what's realer than a meal and a salary
I feel for the casualties, fear for the families
Cause what you thought was real was fueled full of fantasies

Can you see now, everything you could be now
As long as you living and breathing, how the fuck could you be down?
I commend you, as I recruit you
My bossettes across the world, I salute you
Unh, they'll never find a iller broad
So when you see me just give that real nigga nod

Real nigga shit, bitches be mad at me
But nigga who you playin' with?
This is no batteries
