Whole bunch of money in a duffle bag (duffle bag)
Ridin’ on you niggas for the love of cash (love of cash)
Double barrel shotty, she a bad bitch (bad bitch)
Wala, what we got is magic (go)
Shorty said you know I’m down to ride like (go)
Damn baby, you the Bonnie to my Clyde like (go)
We be on it, we be on it all night (go)
Just fuck em baby, when we see em on site

[Verse 1]
How you bitches actin booje in a Honda
My boobie and cabana havin sushi in katana
Makin movies come home and play jacuzzi’s
And designer loubis and a two piece blowin doobies
In a sauna
Lemon mirange guts chrome doomies on the Chevy
Lemon head rollie stones fruity in the beze
Two nickel plated dese’s (desert eagles)
Call them bitches lezi’s (lesbians)
When they lick and then they bust
And leave all you pussys messy (go)
Flyer than a helicopter propeller
We spinnin, takin off
Niggas hatin, bitches jealous
We winning, go take a loss
They just soft, made my way that make me boss
My bitch so made, I’m just so paid
I just don’t wait, I straight go off
I’m just like fuck em, fuck em
She said lets match and we riding
I said we catch em and clashing
After we blast em we sliding
Ain't no actual problems
No need to ask if I got em
Just book the flight after the heist
Bury the cash on the island
And we out

[Verse 2]
Deuce, deuce with the damier grip (work)
And I keep a spare clip behind the hair clip (woah)
Leave your shit bare somewhere where theres bears shit

When you see him you gon see me too

Still fuck with that deniro like a peshy fan (fan)
Ain't too much change like a Pepsi can (can)
I get the drop on a bitch from my right hand (uh)
And put dots on the shit like a Sprite can (work)
Why you copin lamb bags I’m in a white lamb
Settle down my bezel loud, it’s a hypeman (uh)
Serve these bitches like Serena not a rookie
Make these bitches hate a nickel play a nina by the pussy (yeah)
