Queen bosset, that bad bitch
And I hold my zone down
[?] and I ain't talkin bout my home town
Might just pick a boy out and get him fresh up out that mall, fly
I know you want this milkshake, but this ain't for no small fry
Look good in that [?], birthday cake like Rihanna
[?]

[Chorus]
I give you everything that you want
Held you down when it's ugly
Kept you riding on chrome, riding round in that cuddy
Keep on stuntin for more, telling bitches you love me
She said don't worry bout no nigga I cheat on your with this money
I cheat on you with this money
On you with this money
On you with this money
I cheat on you with this money
I cheat on you with this money
Onyou with this money
I cheat on you with this money

[Verse 2]
