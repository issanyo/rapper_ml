[Intro: King Los]
Yo yo
Goat

[Verse 1: King Los]
I seen the lemons you give me the lemons
And I made that lemonade out it, yeah
Kill every nigga that doubted, yeah
Fill every syllable drilling ya mental
Like bitch it's the principle
You look defenseless this niggas invincible probably invisible
How do you visible niggas that rap this shit daily and still suck
I got so much anger built up I don't feel stuff
I-I-I-I catch you snooping dog
And I step out on your building and I kill stuff
Nigga I feel such disrespect the disconnect of the cognitive dissonance
I login I watch this constant persistence
Nonsense of niggas I conquered, their confidence isn't accomplished
I complement this shit
Armed with a ridiculous arsenal also I arson em, awesome
The ultimate, I went off in this bitch
Ya'll finna witness the GOAT tape

[Interlude]
Y'all bout to witness the Queen

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
That my man, Hercules, that my man, Hercules
'Cause I let him count the spinach and he smoke his purple leaf
Tell these bitches I'll adopt them just hop off my ovaries
I'm a vegan but please have my eggs over easy, ooh
He said I got spectacular cat
'Cause I just let him eat the box and he start rappin' like that
I put this venom in him then I blend it in the center
Let him eat the cinnamon, was like a cinnamons
And then I'm finna ride his dick like a dirt bike, beh-na-na-na
Bend it over, pop a wheelie in it, papa really in it
Fuck a milly rock, pop a milly in it, mama silly with it
I'm like hot butter beans, come and get it my nigga
Turn to motorsport, motorboat these titties my nigga
Pussy reserved for the GOAT because you really my nigga
