[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Know a lot niggas run around say they repping the game homie
No, they not like mine
I'm the type of nigga that will go out and spend anything on you
Long as it's not my type
I'm the smoking weed and chilling and living life like a playa
(Uh huh)
I'm the smoking weed and throwing this money all in the air

[Verse 1: Berner]
I'm smokin' and I'm chillin'
I'm drinking and I'm drivin'
I'm partying in Vegas
Until the sun rises, you should try it
I'mma wake up in the mornin'
Break it down and roll it
And let 'em get a bit of this player shit I'm holding
Six in the morning, she don't wanna go home
I rock the 212 with the wood grain on the chrome
I let the money talk for me, I don't answer my phone
It's me and three dancers heading back to my home
I got a shoebox full of cash, new kicks in the bag
I spent twenty-two grand for this shit on my hand
I'm into flexin', I got a yellow bone out in Texas
That loves to send me butt naked pictures
Wassup to my girls in Santa Rosa
My girls in Arizona
Got a girl in Minnesota
She a crazy little stoner
I got three cribs, three big ass houses, kick my shoes off
Flat screens, Italian couches, huh

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
'67 Impala, double seat frames
Figures never a problem and doubles we gain
Them Chanels and sail dead weed
Living with no trippin', so inhale that weed
See a circle divine and squares come in place
Slowly minus all they angles and scale I'm in pace
Balance on these bitches, get my palace on these bitches
And the swag might shock 'em, get my dollas on these switches
That's my nigga Berner, yeah he keep the burner
These hot niggas keep switching, we can feel them squirming
It's shit right here niggas
E.G. all day, line up I'm like your bitches old J's
