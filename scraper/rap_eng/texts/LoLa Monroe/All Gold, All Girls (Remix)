[Intro: Cassie]
Hmmm, hmmmm

Hmmm, hmmmm

[Verse 1: Cassie]
I'on fuck with broke bitches (bitches)
We ain't taking no pictures (no pictures)
Smoke weed and blow kisses (kisses)
Top speed and go missing (go missing)
You should be embarrassed ('barrassed)
Talking about me ('bout me)
Just shopping in Paris (Paris)
Minding my bidness
It's just gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe (just watch)
Yes I'm still shopping like fuck it
Let's get it (let's get it)
Hate, but you love me
You just can't admit it (admit it)

[Hook: Cassie]
It's just gold all in my chain (my chain)

Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe (nigga, nigga, nigga)

[Verse 2: Trina]
Trina
Gold chain, gold ring, gold nails
Stepping out in all gold Chanel
Gold grill, gold yacht, stay fly
Say he wanna fly me round the whole world
DJ, champagne, naw mean
Plus the Phantom came with a chauffeur
Bum bitches, fall back
So whack, plus you hoes ain't put in no work
Why, why, why you talking all that shit?
Honestly I don't give a fuck
You won't catch me with no broke nigga
I ain't taking no pictures (Nope!)
Middle finger to these bitches
Pop, pop, popped a Molly, I'm dancing (woo!)
Overseas me and Cassie (yea)
Fly bitches, get money!

[Hook: Cassie]
It's just gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)

Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe (nigga, nigga, nigga)

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Three bad bitches, but we're matching though
With the top chopped off like Cassie, ho
If your money lame that mean your pussy lame
And my clique Allstars, no rookie game
Versace couture, on my decor
If it screams rich bitch shit I buy galore
24 karats gold is how we going tally hoes
Keep them spinning like a mother fucking Merry Go
Queen Arrow, bring sorrow
Coffee colored Bugatti, a Queen borrowed
Starbucks, cars, trucks
My Queen sip ace, play your cards, slut
Hard top, soft top, that's a tough call
Hundred bottles of Ciroc, that's a Puff call (hello)
Body cold, heart cold
Fuck around and get my haters dipped in all gold

[Hook: Cassie]
It's just gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe (nigga, nigga, nigga)
Gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe (nigga, nigga, nigga)
