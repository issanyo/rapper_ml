Said it must be, cause a bitch up on the source
Mutha fucking right
We got the district on the source
Hold up
Smiles everytime my face is up in the source (man voice)
I hippied on Biggie, Panamera'd on the Porsche
Bang with the game get ya block pop off
I spit bitches swallow till they get locked jaw
I mirrored them figures, that pull statistics like triggers
I move simplistical niggas, I'm just the sickest bitches
Okay now hold up hold up
Fuck they mean I'm colder polar
Best believe my flow' show her, hold a stroller
Hauling ass out my lane, better ask about my slang
I got head shots for these tryna photo copy my frame
She know he know , we know that I fuck around and go Debo
When it smokey up in your ego
Better get all my shots no free-throw
And givenchy with a mojito
Easy for me though how bitches want my swag, I could easily go repo
And snatch my shit back in a black on black vest
Snack attack on that track, run a combat your whack raps
Niggas hotter than when I leave my perm in for to long
And I never gave a fuck about a niggas who on
I'm like one of them I'm my own bitch
Type bitches on rich, white dishes on wrist
Quit vicious, I dislike stitches
They fuck they nigga over cause they pussy at heart
Through you work that prove you bring that quarter back Bret Favre
I've been tryna get these niggas off me
Can't even stack your c-note so your figures off key
OG, at heart keep my shit low key
I just cop me a new royce the perpetual rolley
OD, these bitches fake out more than smokin' mirrors
And my clique read thru gags, so don't get the choking near us
Really though who the fuck illa?
I'll wait til the gang unleash the killa
