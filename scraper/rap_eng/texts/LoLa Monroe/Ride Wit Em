Verse 1:
We got guns like navy seals
Real niggas, can’t wait to kill
In the street, where they work
Tryin’ to fuck hoes and pay some bills
Real shit when it’s beef
We loading up the machines
Wait till you leave the club
Turn the parking lot into Vietnam
Nigga pointing them pistols
Your mama and them gon’ miss you
Put your ass in the coffin, and that t-shirt and your picture
Don’t give a fuck who you say it was
Lay your ass in a pool of blood
Now you wanna talk it out with your home boy, you was super tough
And with that loud talking, nothing but loud and Maui sacks
Pistol in your mouth, show me where them keys at
Acting up for ratchet hoes, keep on showing out
Gone pump the round and wind up like my Chevy, brains blowed out

Chorus:
I got plenty goons and nigga I’ma ride with ‘em
I got plenty guns and nigga I’ma ride with ‘em
Fuck you and whoever that's ridin’ with you
Ride your ass in a hearse and they can ride with you
I got plans and guns and nigga I’ma ride with ‘em
I got plans and guns and nigga I’ma ride with ‘em
Fuck you and whoever is ridin’ with you
Ride your ass in a hearse and they can ride with you

Verse 2: (Lola Monroe)
Know some niggas pulling out choppers
For some niggas singing like operas
All my propositions be toppers
All my block-block-blockin’
I ain’t never been no knocker
Bitch I’m busting down them doors
How you claiming you gonna be right here for me?
When you wasn’t around for yours
Keep these bitches out of wiff
These suckers out of limph
My lessons ain’t never remotely close
Leave impressions that will dent
Royalty we live by, and respect is what we die for
They reflections never mirror real shit
They see pride more
Riding through what you see, Listening to Boosie
Ski mask and Gucci, the Gunplay, the uzi
Hits and commissary cause we real like that
Swimming for them pigs will get you killed like that
