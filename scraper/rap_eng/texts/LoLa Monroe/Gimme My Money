[Chorus]
If it ain’t what I say it is, say it ain't shit at all
Bitch cut the check
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Bitch cut the check
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money, bitch gimme my money

[Verse 1]
Okay, shoppin up in that SoHo
Got a condo up in that NoHo
But that shit ain’t bout nothing
When we live up in that gogo
Still prayin for polo, got my money to blow though
And I’m gunnin yo mojo when I’m sellin dough
Now I’m runnin yo whole show
When you wanted a doughnut
But I’m coming for you next, you done in a low blow
B, that CS, that ED and V
All my killas after you, PT
‘Cause you aren’t kllin me, me ID
Kill mo, it’s ill flow
Rest in paradise to Squil though

[Chorus]
If it ain’t what I say it is, say it ain't shit at all
Bitch cut the check
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Bitch cut the check
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money, bitch gimme my money

[Verse 2]
Okay, all yall niggas be loafin
Fuck is up with that bread
I ain’t the type to be open
Less I’m getting that jet
I’m talkin coppin yo options ain’t equivalent to mine
My private’s private
You just weak from yo ligaments to spine
Cocaine, she make the dope niggas clap
Now shit tighter than a broke nigga pocket
And the broke niggas actin when the bitch getting money
Middle finger up ‘cus a bitch getting money
Gang bring niggas out like Bary Fonse
But I don’t even play less they carry arms
Carry on, come fuck with my ego
Garfield’s is hanging on my t-blow

[Chorus]
If it ain’t what I say then it wasn’t, this shit ain’t all
Bitch cut the check
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Bitch cut the check
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Gimme my money, bitch gimme my money, bitch gimme my money
Bitch cut the check
