Lola Monroe:

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha all these bitches is abolished
They couldn't cum real if it f-cked them
So it's fuck them cuttin in they guts when
The truth get to openin they worlds get to shuttin'

You learned the truth form your parents
That tucked you in for your lullabies, my lullabies
I learned the truth from the gunshots
That played as my lullabies, my lullabies
Like "Hush little baby, never say a word"
You ain't seen what you saw
Let the pressure fade your blurs
Cause while you'll be seeing life
He'll see life times 2."
Leavin' kids f-cked up for a lifetime too
I just got a question
Why these tellin' ass niggas still walkin' Thru the hoods of the same niggas that they told on?
I mean they own niggas
Niggas that they owe 1
The ones that bend over backwards Be the ones that they fold on

[Los:]

These bitches ain't down for you
You better look into they eyes I guarantee that they pray for your demise
These bitches ain't down for you Fuck everything they said They loyalty only go as far as bread
These bitches ain't down for you It's f-cked up when you help them Get the same money they put on your head
These bitches ain't down for you You better look into they eyes I guarantee that they pray for your demise
These bitches ain't down for you

{Lola Monroe:}

Check out the bizarre
Looks on they faces Check out the Audemar
Watch me be the same bitch yesterday or tomorrow'
I was raised to embrace my struggles
No matter, it born a star
G-code, G-code, fuck happened to the G-code?
I just see how's that geekin', C-notes
See O's that secretly we know
Or repo your kilo's an flip it for D-Low
I see the world thru the eyes of the
Mutha f-ckin district
So in the midst of sucks
I'm a mutha f-ckin misfit
Did it, don't mind standing alone
As long as all my grinds is through
No wonder women follow
I've been crowned as hero-ine, zero in
This my shot you wanna burrow in
I air you pussies out, what you came for?
So ain't no takin' from me
That just get you chain sawed
