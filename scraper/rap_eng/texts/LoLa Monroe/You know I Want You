Yeah, so priceless money couldn’t afford her
Spoil her with loyalty and adore her
My love ain't’ motivated by the cash
But her future motivated by her past
Came a diamond from the pressure of struggles that she endured
And the jewels in her faith were the treasure that reassured her
That there was warm love in a cold weather
So when the cold fronts, she know better
She said i need a lover to screen in my winters, and season my taste, prestige in my trace, The reason I’m straight
It’s worth being with someone that knows ya worth so embrace the pain and birth the beauty like your first

Ain't no past love lost when you found the one
Feel every bit of the burn like you downed the rum
Down to gun it down when it hit you like a bullet and the uzzi oozin’ lust while the trigger screamin’ pull it
He said he never met unconditional love, this provisional lust so the transitional trust felt like something out of heaven
I be on two V’s like a seven and left an impression
Never Cross him like intersections or
Judge him like indiscretions
Serve him like at concessions and fuck him with all affection
And still give him space like he from mars and I’m from venus
But I come down on his planet to give him some genius
