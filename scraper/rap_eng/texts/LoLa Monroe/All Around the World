[Hook: Carmen]
I’ve been all around the world and I, I, I, I
Never met a guy as quite as special as you are
But it feels like I’m dreaming
So many options I’ve had
But those relationships went all bad
I said I won’t look back
But I’m waiting, waiting

[Verse 1: Carmen]
Got me waiting patient, just for your love
Got me going crazy, when I’m not in your arms
Feel your kiss
Feel your touch
All the above, make it yours
Feel my love
Feel my lust
Make it yours, make it yours

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Los]
I’m talking black Tom Fords in a ‘74 Challenger
This is the allure, but never before caliber, I
Said she was Day and she said I was Night
So we had a picnic on the Moon
And she said I was bright
I’m talking out-of-this-world shit
How did this girl get out of the projects
And making the projects the product of thorough shit?
Paris, Sunday
London, Monday
Walking tall, like Project Runway
The more I look in your eyes
The less trouble I see
When you let me H-town
You’re SWV
You give me TLC
And it got me silly
It’s a cold world, and if you left
I’d be chilly

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Black Tom Fords
[?] zipper
Boy got drive, like a four door pick-up
Flick up
Paparazzi  up on our penthouse do’
Never could top, it’s like the penthouse flo’
Been around all around the world and I, I, I
Never met a nigga to match my fly
But you take the cake with meticulous taste
And you make the fake a ridiculous waste
‘Cause you the realest shit I ever had
And ain’t a iller bitch, who hella bad
So I’m your perfect fit, like a cork in a bottle
All we go is get it poppin’, Full throttle

[Hook]
