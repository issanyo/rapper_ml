[Verse 1: Lola Monroe]
As I lay me down to sleep, I praying for all my frenemies
They praying for my downfall
I’m praying for they ends to meet
I get it, I get it
They mad I really done did it
Fuck you
Now this song for all the suckers who said, “I ain’t gon’ be shit”
Now I’m shittin’ on you busters
And pissin’ on all your dissin’
You bitchin’
I’m in the kitchen
I’m fixin’ up my next mission
Essential to my ambition, [?] from the ambition
Show for body opposition
Opposing any proposition
Need morticians for all this body baggin’ I been presuming to
My ambitions could build ruins that will ruin you
Assuming you
That I stop my shine
Stop my grind?
You outcho mind
I can fuel my time
And a bitch won’t stop til’ it’s not my prime

[Hook]
You know I got to fly away
Because I can’t stay here
Feel like a bird with no wings
But my dreams is so clear
So even if you’re far away
Someday you’ll be near
‘Cause when I get my wings
We gon’ get the fuck up out of here
(Outta here, outta here, outta here, outta here)
We gon’ get the fuck up out of here
(Outta here, outta here, outta here, outta here)

[Verse 2]
Now these underachievers wanna underrate you
Ain’t built for the game, but wanna play you
Niggas lines played out, like they wanna page you
Now your “Once Upon A Time” bitches wanna fake too
They judge you as a ho, but they don’t even know the half
Hating on your future, they don’t even know your past
When your mother taught you love, but your father ain’t know how to
Niggas took a shot, but you ain’t never let it cloud you
Put the Lord over this money, but it’s business over bitches
Treated as the illest, I put sickness over bitches
Condition through the pressure, I ain’t never tripping though
The pain turn into pleasure
Like a [?] sniffing coke
Falling down is how you grow
Stayin’ down is how you die
Rising from my downfalls
This right here, is how you fly

[Hook]
