[Lola]

What you want me to do?

[Los]

You already know, GET EM!

[Lola]

Let's Go!
Beamer, Benz or Bentley interior decked in Fendi
Grill sittin' pretty, Kimora, Aoki, Ming Lee
Rims pokin' out like some silicon sittin' titties
Drop them grands, they have them sittin' now niggas wanna come get me
Lipstick rims like them wheels spin by a lesi
But its something bout a chevy, when I give him that becky
Keep him bustin like he remy', never petty like a penny
When he want it ain't no "lemme" he just say it and go hammy
He go ape shit on me, fuck me to a coma
Say the pussy taste like henny and it got a sweet aroma
I said "you might need a soda", he said "i dont need a chaser"
Took a shot and then he said "the only thing I chase his paper"
Take a breaker like a raker but I bake it like baker
I be flippin' like my daddy stay up for that fuckin paper, pay her
I am misses blanco I need all that gwapaponzo
Check the beamer, benz or bentley sittin' outside of my condo
Yah!
