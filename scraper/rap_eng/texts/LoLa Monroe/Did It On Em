[Verse]
Monroe in the building, tell them broke bitches sit down
Money Kevin Hart funny man them joke bitches get clowned
Ain't for no gossip, I rather talk up some numbers
On some other shit, extortion a lot to cough up, and [?]
Call me the madam griselda up her the prime
They mad i'm what they can't fathom triumph and I intertwine
See, my cold life, gave me sick bars
And i'm good in the hood like I fix cars
Gone, sayonara, outta here
Looking for your target, ill be laid out on the stratosphere
Givenchy for the shade cost you and your mother rent
Where all my bad boss bitches, need to win another friend
Hop up in this blue bugatti, the roof gone like a tsunami
Hit it and your son gon prolly just flip that shit and just body
All you cunts in the way and yeah you can call me snotty
I got paper to blow through, I can teach you how to potty
Train em, ain um, that's serious babe
Can you blame em? they geekin at a delirious rate
I mean the shoe game, homicidal a bit
I mean could you tame, or even idle a bitch?
Fuck no cause they never go h-a-m
And they never be straight like eight am
They ain't never in the shit they say they in
I'mma just do me till the day they win
Bet I go in, bet I go hard, bet I beast bars
I'mma show these bitches that I ain't they friend
Heard a couple bitches wanna take my spot, good luck motherfucker I don't think they can
All you bitches got me backwards, criss cross
I dont deal with middle men you bitches Chris Bosh
Shouts out to my city (dc)
You can ask my city (bout the gt)
I was whippin Bentley's back when bubbles used to be the new cool
18 in competition with everything that the dudes do
Who's you? them euros i gets buku, when the new coop look coo coo cause the shoes too, big for it
Some bitch shit never been for it to busy bossin bitches
Face of my city my duties is vicious
I snap my fingers my soldiers will go poke holes in them hoes that's opposing my dough
Its nothing to jump in the rose and get low cause i'm ballin just call me misses Lola Monroe
Okay, I take a flick then have a chick sick
Bake enough bread to have a picnic
And this bitch is sick so have a bitch fit
L-O-L-A its a rap for this shit

I mean what more can I say?
