[Hook - King Los][x2]
Uh, Yo
Power is bad
Silence is good
Violence is bad
But balance is good
The world isn’t fair
The challenge is great
It’s bitter and sweet
Just balance the hate
Cause balance is good, balance is good
Like checkin ya bank, and ya balance is good

[Verse 1 - King Los]
We all in the way, too stubborn to move
We try and we fail, we love and we lose
We push and we pull, we come and we go
It’s one and the same, cause it’s one thing I know
Balance is good, balance is good
Prayin' you safe, makin' it out of the hood
Keep chasin' your dreams, get them dollars you should
Cuz balance is good, yeah balance is good
Be a follower never, be a model of clever
And through your sorrow just acknowledge tomorrow is better
You get sun, you get rain
You get fun, you get pain
Just be one with yourself, because it’s one and the same
Cuz balance is good, yeah balance is good
And if they hate they make you better like challenges should
See power is bad, Silence is good
Violence is bad but balance is good
Yeah balance is good, yeah balance is good
See my city is hard, but my leather is soft
I’m a ruler my nigga, faced immeasurable odds
Say I’m out of my mind, cuz I’m flexin this hard
If you question my chain, that’s like questioning God
How dope is my watch, how fresh is my charm
Yeah I make diamonds out of mine when the pressure was on
I just got on my grind with the message of songs
Same sidewalks with the chalk that the sketchers were on
Dead bodies, everybody, looked the other way
When they took your brother away
What the fuck your mother say
Hangin' out in public, hey
Just stay out of troubles way
If God gave you another day
Then baby just appreciate it
Yeah baby, appreciate it
Because, balance is good, yeah balance is good
Yeah power is bad, and silence is good
Violence is bad, but balance is good

[Verse 2 - Lola Monroe]
I want you to live, I want you to breathe
I want you to forgive, I want you to be free
I want you to shine, cause that light in you
It illuminates what you fightin through
I love you through war, I heal you through pain
Matters of faith, I never knew shame
That uphill battle with impeccable views
Now delivering a new multi-dimensional you, uh
I need you to grow, I see you and me
I want you to trust, I want to believe
Your value is vibrant
No venom can emerge through your voyage
And voided in vain, it's invested in virtue
No man curse you, God bless
So when they come for me, I just say God bless
Not stress, progress, it’s a process
So when I process like produce
I produce profit, that’s a promise
I’m timeless
No time to mind, the business of your minus
Fine as the queen, I’m your Highness

[Hook - King Los][x2]
Uh, Yo
Power is bad

Cause balance is good, balance is good
Like checkin ya bank, and ya balance is good
