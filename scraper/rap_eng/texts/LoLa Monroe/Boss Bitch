[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Ey, ey, ey, I need a boss bitch
Fuckin' with me, ey, she gotta be that bitch
And I don't care how you get your chain
As long as you get money, do your damn thing

[Post-Hook: Shawty Lo]
I need a boss bitch, I need a boss bitch
I need a boss bitch, I need a boss bitch
I need a boss bitch, I need a boss bitch
I need a boss bitch, I need a boss bitch

[Verse 1: Tiffany Foxx]
When I walk pass niggas drop their jaws
[?]
[?] bitch with no flaws
Get bill like bu-bu-butter cream
I'm about my cheese
Come and go as I please
And if I decide to spend the night
I'll come and go as I please
No sorry, your dick don't run shit
I am Von Furstenberg type bitch
Diamonds rocky, I let you on my neck
Got the Himalayas on my wrist
Live in the hills like Shaunie O'Neal
I'm not from Bel Air but I'm fresh like Will
Yes, Jeffrey cook me whatever I feel
Got money in banks but my uncle ain't Phil
I see shores in my backyard
[?]
I'm so hood, you EV wallet
EBT next to my back car
Nose in the air, yeah, I got a bad attitude
Shoe game mean and the bags rude
Got clothes all over my living room
For my address GPS latitude

[Verse 2: Jai Jai]
Pussy real good, keep that on the meter
Super bad bitch, better know how to treat her
I'm fun house, niggas know how to eat her
Eat her, eat her, hold up, please her
Come on baby, let me talk to you for a minute
Welcome to the fun house, you get down on a minute
Seen so many bitches mad and into trippin'
If it ain't easy speakin', I ain't need a sippin'
Let me tell you about this life I like
Sleep all day, play all night
Got a bunch of bad bitches and they wanna take flight
You are on dice and I'm all on heis
Gonna be a star than tonight's your night
Carry your dreams, you ain't got to bloom twice
I'm a bad bitch ain't about the bad life
Life, ain't about that life
L.O., please calm me down baby
You can tell the world that the sex came crazy
You can tell the boys that the deal is amazing
You can light 'em up [?]
I'm a fun girl livin' in my fun world
Nasty ass bitches makin' me wanna hurl
You want a boss bitch, then you got a boss bitch
Know I'm a boss bitch 'cause I do boss shit I

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
I been employin' these bitches
And straight extortin' they niggas
Foreign whips man imported
But my export and pay bigger
I'm importin' in Portland, you just local resort
My Aquapulco resort make you act [?]
They be like damn, damn
Why your ego so big?
Found act like I'm a lace
Then my ego gon' trip
They know me in the A
I told her "shawty, drop it low"
'Cause Shawty Lo on the white hang
You know he be poppin' my
Might pull a rack and get rachet
But I be Donald Trump on these hoes
Might just wipe my ass with their savings
I be Donald Trump on these hoes
Both leg in them Giuseppe's
And I ask to light the runway
We act right on the week day
Let 'em taste that like it's Sunday
Boss bitch
