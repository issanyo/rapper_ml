Relax, mothefucka
Real rap uh

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
I used to have dreams of that Q45, not the 2-door
Hatin’ ass niggas, this is way before I knew y’all
Bitch niggas rupaul, 38 screw off
Newest park legend where a nigga learn to shoot ball
All alone, still I kept the G, they knocked my crew off
Work for you, please man, who done made you boss?
Moms plate topless, she was missin’ hella dishes
Always wonder why the coffee pot above the kitchen
They know Biggie kept a semi with a story to tell
Hand to hand they makin’ up they bed, it’s more than they sell
I’m just a call away my nigga, I’m a Taylor you know
We gettin’ money if we say it’s green, know I’mma go

That’s why they hatin’ on me
Cuz I did it on my own
That’s why they hatin’ on me
Cuz I grind it, now I’m shinnin’

That’s why they hatin’ on me
Cuz that money stay on my mind
That’s why they hatin’ on me
Cuz I grind it, now I’m shinnin’, it’s my timin’

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Man, I had to wake up and get it myself
Get my own connect and have my own heat on my belt
So fuck a hand out, I knew to go get it myself
Now the same ones who was hatin’ want to give me help
I just tell ‘em I’m cool, matter fact I don’t rap
Not for you niggas who ain’t help me get where I’m at
I’m just keepin’ it real, let you tell that I’m fake
Cuz I be runnin’ for that money, you ain’t in the race
Yea this ballin’ is necessary, my nigga I can’t lie
You suckers be hitchhiking, labels lookin’ for rides
Let me tell you something, that’s with everything aside
I'll have them niggas at your door, ‘bout this Taylor Gang or die

That’s why they hatin’ on me
Cuz I did it on my own
That’s why they hatin’ on me
Cuz I grind it, now I’m shinnin’

That’s why they hatin’ on me
Cuz that money stay on my mind
That’s why they hatin’ on me
Cuz I grind it, now I’m shinnin’, it’s my timin’
