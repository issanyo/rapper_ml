Last tape i wrote a letter to Lucifer
Now through the venom i can see who bit her
All my credence in the lord
But these demons and these whores
Be the reason i accord with a few killers
And my sayin’ is vengeance that I’ve conjured
I’m just sayin’ I’ve had a couple thoughts thats wondered
Into the midst of the darkness
I’m listed as heartless
My distance goes farthest
I pissed in apartments
With enough dope to build back the projects they tore down
They had enough brokes say the game changed when the pyrex weigh more now
Fuck you want me to do?
My drive was built on times i couldn’t afford a vehicle
Strategical when dealing with these cynical motherfuckers
My pinnacles undercover til they critical slumming suffers
I’m lyrically clinical
All you bitches is dinner
Such a maliciously winning grubber
You viciously thinning sucker
[Chorus]
When nightmares and reality start to blend
No turnin
Awaaah
Ain't no turnin back now x2
Awaaah
Ain't no turnin back now x2


If i wasn’t me then I’d be a lost bitch
Like look at what she been through she really lost it
Instead I’m bossin’ like fuck what it’s costin’
Ass in Stella Mcartney like look at her proportions
I’m just iller
Ain't nobody iller
Cause I came realer
Ain't nobody realer
I could strip me of the pretty show you how the ugly build me
From where niggas plottin ___? and they mugs be lurkin’ gritty
Bumpin’ Beanie Sigel dark tinting through my city
Committing to committees while they dickin’ through some kiddies
I ain't neva been that type my G
I don’t feel right until i swipe my G’s
Shout out to my bitches that use to be my true bitches
Still love you like you my bitches even though your hatred vicious
I put scriptures on your wishes and pray only for your best
And i only know your stress cause you’re a lonely soul at quest
[Chorus]
When nightmares and reality start to blend
No turnin
Awaaah
Ain't no turnin back now x2
Awaaah
Ain't no turnin back now x2
