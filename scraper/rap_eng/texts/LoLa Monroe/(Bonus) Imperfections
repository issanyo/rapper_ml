[Verse 1: Los]
Remember when I told you I needed someone to match my cool?
Stare up at that mansion roof, and ride off in them matching coupes
Then we lit that match and *poof, look at us, the matching proof
You enhanced my status too, this some shit you ain't have to do
Who knew my past had some hazards too? We ain't actin' irrational
All this passion was actual, our attraction was magical
Fuck it, here's the rhetoric, it ain't about the weather switch
It's whether you with someone that you can go through that weather with
And you'll never slip, long as I'm here I promise
Even if a nigga fall, and me fallin' for you is honest
Sun is shinin' upon us, see them little things is necessary
So every day be like the fourteenth of February, yeah
Ha, you got a nigga heart though, this shit is priceless
They can revolve the bar codes, so even if tomorrow
Is painful and full of sorrow, be like yesterday
Just a memory we could borrow... and baby girl

[Hook: Carmen]
Baby you ain't gotta be perfect, or straight out of a magazine
No lights, camera, action... cause I can see behind the scenes
It's not about what you ain't baby, it's everything you hope to be
I'm in love with your imperfections

[Verse 2: Los]
Man my baby got the face of an angel, a walk that could silence rooms
A heart made of gold and a smile that could make a flower bloom
Lips out this world, one kiss is a trip around the moon
Fuck your past, my last name finna be ours' soon
Uh, uh uh uh (x4) Hol' up, I mean
It's been five years if I'm doing the math
Cause four years straight you had me straight spoonin' that ass
Now I'm making toasts and tappin' that spoon on the glass
Announcing my son inside your womb, I assume you would have
I back stroke in your river cause your pearl's sweet
Watch the shooting stars in your eyes whenever our world's meet
Man I'm talking fireworks, but flyer than fireworks
Fire, defying the laws of gravity, never felt higher
Cause when you throw shade at a diamond it keep shining
They can't deny us the sky so fuck 'em, we keep flying

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Ohhhh, you're so full of imperfections, and I love it
You're so full of imperfections, and I love you
Spread your wings and fly away with me
I love you, I love you baby

[Hook: Carmen]
Baby you ain't gotta be perfect, or straight out of a magazine
No lights, camera, action... cause I can see behind the scenes
It's not about what you ain't baby, it's everything you hope to be
I'm in love with your imperfections, they seem so perfect to me

[Eric Bellinger & Carmen]
Baby girl I know I ain't perfect, but somehow you still love me
But I ain't gonna fight you about it, I'ma just let it be
(It's not about what you ain't baby) I know
(It's everything you want to be) I know
(In love with your imperfections, they seem so perfect to me)
I'm perfect to you, yeah, you're perfect to me ohhh
(I'm perfect for you, yeah, you're perfect for me, yeahhh)
