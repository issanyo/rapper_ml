Mack 10 comin' straight outta plain Inglewood
He got the ups on your hoez
Uh, and you know that, and you know that

[Mack 10]
I knew this girl name Wonda that drove a Honda wagon
A bad ass bitch but always braggin
About this, that and the other
It's like every nigga ballin' was her big brother
She knew the 411 on everyone of them
But swore up and down she wasn't fuckin' with none of them
Had niggas on her like decals buyin' her jewells
Cause the ass was like booyah
She was the perfect bitch
Let her tell it but the ho was full of so much bullshit
I could smell it
And I could tell she was a no good ho
Cause she always want to meet the niggas that I know (like who?)
First Cube, K-Dee and I bet
If you let me mention Pooh
Then the bitch I'll get soakin wet
Wantin' to do it just to say she done it
Let him nut on her stomach
Cause he got a five hunnid
Benzo(on Lorenzos) but you know how hoes is
They itchin' fo the chickens and the niggas in show biz
With out the chips no dips or the hotteys
But 10 I'll kick a bitch like he doin' karate
In the body round house to the ribs with the gangsta boots
Man I brakes they ass off to the roots
This H.O.E.K. all muthafuckin day
And wouldn't have it no other way
So lock the door hit the floor
And if you hear any noise
You know is that nigga Mack 10 nuttin up on a ho
