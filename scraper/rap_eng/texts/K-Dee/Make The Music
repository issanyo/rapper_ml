[Intro]
Girl: Is it good? Do you like that?
Barry White sounding dude: Ladies and gentlemen. We have a young lady making her way to the mic with some big ass motherfucking lips. She's gonna sing a song that's gonna blow your socks off. But first...it's that nigga K-Dee. Sho' yo' right

[Verse One]
You make me woo-woo-woo
When you do what you do to me
The K to the Dee
Kissing on my naval
But wait one goddamn second
Do my mic need checking? (Oh yes)
So check one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
My balls are blue, they blue, they blue, they blue
So what you gon' do is take a trip down south
Blow my trumpet as I dump it in your mouth
And you can work me like a Slurpee
Damn, I'm jerking it must be working
Putting on the hits, the best thing since grits
Girl I got the shits fo' ya
Sounding like the 5th Symphony
And I'm glad that you ain't no kin to me
Cause if you was my cousin you'd still be a trick
So get the lick

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
And make the music with your mouth bitch
(K-Dee baby!)
And make the music with your mouth bitch
"The art of sucking dick"
And make the music with your mouth bitch
(K-Dee baby!)
And make the music with your mouth bitch
(Hoe, you can't be his lady)

[Verse Two]
I like when you bob and weave when you bob
I grab your weave
Girl, you can leave
When the job is done
My balls are like Lays
Bet you can't eat just one
You start to hum (hummmmm)
I'm feeling numb
Here I come, here I come, here I kitty come come
Red rum
Ready to tear up shit
While you're looking for a place to spit
Now I appreciate your soup coolers
On the one shot, big black automatic pee shooter
Rolling down the street no matter what the day is
You can blow for Miles like Davis
Ready?
No I won't Wreck like Teddy
Shooting for the stars but watch the parked cars
The radio ain't go nothing on this
Ghetto kisses like this

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
You said you never do it
Blew it for the first time
If I must say it was dope like my first rhyme
You get a nut
I stuff you like a Twinkie
And certainly
You love this smoked beef jerky
The flavor of the month so won't you come and taste me
You want a lick, got more Dick than Tracey
Just make the music, don't come with no cheat note
Just experience my version of deep throat
Get your knees dirty
Fo' about thirty
Minutes or more like Prince I'll adore
Your head in my lap, up and down
Bobbing
Doing a good job and
Slopping on my nogging
Never will admit it
That you done did it
Scared to say you suck dick
Know you straight with it
It's all good cause I know that you a pro with them knees on the flo'
And here we go

[Hook]

Babe you gon' love it {x6}
