[Intro]
"After evaluating all the competition, after many, many years of getting my game right
I finally recognize, and you should, too."

[Verse 1]
Who'd ever thought it would happen?
Got them hands clapping
Laid back rapping
Nigga, what's happening?

It ain't nobody but that undercover down low
Bro
With more dough
Than the average Joe Schmoe

I'm not a G
But gotta be
The Freshest MC in the World
You know I gots to get it, girl

Because I need it
Not conceited
But convinced
Ever since I was a minor
Bumping girls finer
Than Janet

And It
Don't stop
Till
I say it's time to chill
I gots to get a mill
Still the same person, never tripped with my ego
Plus we go way back and homies don't play that

It's not a day that goes by
That I can deny that I'm fly
You gots to ask why
By the way
Butter not Parkay
It's me

[Hook]
(female vocal) "Got to be the freshest MC
Hee Heeeeee"
I'm the freshest MC in the World
(female vocal) "And it has got to be me
Hee Heeeeee"
I'm the freshest MC in the World

[Verse 2]
You heard the rest, the best they all claimed to be
Fame to me ain't nothing
Got'em all fronting

Now who's the baddest?
Be glad it's not K-Dee
Like a baby, that's precious
I'm known to be the freshest

I'm international
Cashing more checks
Than Knicks
With no tricks
Up my sleeve
Why not believe
In me? Cause that's who I got to be
It wouldn't make sense
To represent without confidence

And got more from where that came from
It's a shame some don't know
So that leaves more

Room for me
Soon to be
The talk of your town
Underground
And love it by the pound

So raise your hand if you're sure
Or get in where you fit in
They all want to sit in
On this, cause this is where it's at
In fact
I got to be free
I got to be me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm world wide, well known
For wheeling
And dealing
From the US, I stray up to New Zealand

I must confess, the best is yet to come
Some try to doubt, but now I'm out and set to run
Game like Emmitt Smith
To the limit
With funky ass hits to keep you rolling more spliffs

I can't be kept down
Making niggers step down
Recognize
Eyes open wide as I move inside
The center
Been into the game since 84 Live
Now no more nine to five

I'm too much for the average, can't be touched
With a ten-foot pole, and with more Soul
Than De La
May I continue?
Send you
On a trip with K to the Dee
See
How sweet
This beat it is on
The smooth T. I. P

[Hook X 2]
