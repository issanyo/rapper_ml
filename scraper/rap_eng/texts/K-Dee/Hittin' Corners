[Verse 1]
Anotha Day!
Dolla
Holla if you hear me
Comin with the bumps in my hoop'
As swoo-woop
Here I am
The mack it's clear I am
K-Dee, so baby get with the program
Damn
What's on the menu
It's about 10 to 5
So let me see what the weather's like
Step outside, glide to my ride, hit the button for the alarm 'chirp-chirp-disarm'
Pull the top back, cock the hammer on my Glock back
I ain't trippin, just lettin' 'em know I ain't slippin
Sippin, on some Lipton Iced Tea flossin
Don't trip, it ain't easy, cause it costs to be the boss
And so, I'm on the hunt
Never front with the cash flow
Hittin' Corna's slow on the go so now you know
My tires are Armor-All'd, spit shined wax on
Tank kinda low so I pulls into Exxon
Give me 10 on six, damn look at baby at pump 4
What you doin with all that rump, ho?
She must have endz, rollin in a benz
Could it be her's, or maybe it's her boyfriend's?
Slid me her number
I wonder if you got a man, cause not a man other than me can get you hotter than
Cayenne pepper
Swept her off her feet when I boned her
Catchin bitches hittin Corna's

[Hook]
Diamond in the back
Sunroof Top
Diggin the scene how the players lean
And to the ho's that be out there strollin
You know I'm rollin
Creepin up on ya
Hittin Corners

[Verse 2]
Skip to my Lou, took a sip of my brew
Called up my homies and took a trip with my crew
Down to the spot where the ho's all jock
Twenty-four seven around the motherfuckin clock
Tick-tock as they flock in packs
The macks come around while the other's look for sacks
But I'm lookin for the ones that ain't too proud to beg
When I spots 'em, watch 'em, swing from this third leg
Hittin no switches, but still gettin my clown on
Banked a quick left cause there's more of them down on
Crenshaw and Vernon, watch the curb while I'm turnin
Don't wanna scrape them tires, they ain't no Dayton wires
But I still got 'em feenin, leanin like I'm in the '64
But I'm in this coupe and I'm still lettin these tricks know
I'm from that number 1 crew in yo area
I ain't bullshittin, the corners I be hittin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
One time I was rollin deep, I creep with caution
I'm bone it, cause they want it, I don't sleep that often
Slauson make a right cause they got it blocked off
For 3 corners straight up to 58th street
Detour, be sure they ain't on my tail
Bail, what the hell, they gets smoked on the DL
Just let me ride like Dre, and play my music loud
Steady mobbin', heads a bobbin' as I move through the crowd
Slow down, hit the hazards when I cross the train track
My sounds are bumpin' loud enough to make your brain crack
Bazooka Tubes bumpin Ice Cube, nigga make it rough, make it smooth
Yeah, show yo eyes so act like you know
It's 1994 so let this mack through the door
I'm in like Flynn, there ain't no stoppin
Seen my homie Snope, nigga what's poppin?
Chronic smokin, have yo ass chokin
Just about to blaze, damn we had to raise
Cause 5-0 creep my homie peeps so we jetted
Got my 9, plus no time, to be gettin sweated

[Hook until the song ends]
