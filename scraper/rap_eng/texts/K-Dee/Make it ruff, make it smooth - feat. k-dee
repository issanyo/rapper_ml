Hey yo Cube
Make it ruff
Cube, check it out
Whassup?
Yo this bitch was suckin' my dick
Then I told her?
What?
Make the music with ya mouth bitch
Baby, baby
Ya like that
Make it ruff
Naw, make it smooth
I make niggas say woof 'cause I'm in the coupe with no roof
Ya smell like somethin' 90-proof
'Cause, I'm ruff, and nigga you can buck these nuts
If you comin' with that smooth shit, hardcore rules shit
I make the hoes say hay each and every day
Bitch 'cause I'm the K-Dee, no I'm not a G
Mothafuckin' wannabe mack
But I'm smooth like that
I gots ta buck, you, right on up, punk you lucky that cha livin'
'Cause, I'm the unforgiven, I like power, ain't a damn thing funny
I like pussy and money
And I won't slam like Onyx or never ever stutter
But I'm b-b-butter
Leader of the new school, you hardcore fool
Nigga make it ruff, make it smooth
And I'm here
Make it ruff, naw, make it smooth
You can lick me up and down till I yell stop, damn
Bitch ya missed a drop 'cause I don't play when I sway
It's the quicker picker upper
A pro that moves slow before this hoe
I'm quick to dump her, so eeny-meeny-miney-mo, where's my dough?
I gots ta make a livin', I out ta get mo
Money, and got more nuts for ya honey
So come and break me off, this nigga's walkin' soft
It's the smoothness that make niggas move to this
For you ruffnecks, I'll check you with my tool and shit
Don't sweat 'em, just let 'em play that hardcore role
We still cool but just make it smooth
You know what, it's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under?, I'm chocolate thunder
Ruff as sin, cuts on ya skin
And I blend with the tracks, see I'm black
K-Dee is the mack, matter fact
Niggas hit me up with the C's and B's
But you don't wanna fuck wit these
'Cause, I'll put 'em on ya
And we'll have to wake ya mothafuckin' ass up with ammonia
'Cause hardcore rap is always on the map and it don't stop
Devoid of pop and if I drop another smooth hit
It'll still be hard 'cause I helped start this shit
So make it ruff, naw make it smooth
Make it ruff, make it smooth
Make it ruff, make it smooth
Make it ruff
Naw make it smooth
Make it, make it ruff
Naw make it smooth
I hate when niggas get too fuckin' sexy on the track
I'm pro black, well I'm a pro mack
I like hittin' switches
I love hittin' bitches 'cause I'm a player, hard rhyme sayer
I thought you knew, but ain't no thang, you knew the way I swang
Creepin', ain't no sleepin', ain't a damn thing changed
I hit hoe after hoe with this laid back shit
Fool, I kill at will and still can fade that shit
'Cause, it's the predator
I had it, yes a nigga watch yo step
You in a gang like star, tryina get a rep
It ain't no sweat for me to buck, buck nigga don't give a fuck
You better duck, duck or get your ass stuck, stuck
Don't let the smooth shit fool ya, 'cause I can get it on
'Cause, I be breakin' bones like dragonfly Jones
Quick to put 'em on ya
Don't make me act a fool, nigga, make it ruff
Make it smooth and I'm in here
Make it ruff
Make it ruff, make it smooth
Make, make it, make it ruff
Make it ruff, make it smooth
