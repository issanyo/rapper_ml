[Intro]
{Door bell rings}
Ms. Parker: Oh, hi Darryl
K-Dee: How you doing Ms. Parker?
Ms. Parker: Fine...Ricky's not here
K-Dee: Oh...can I talk to you for a minute?
Ms. Parker: Well...oh, alright. Come on in

[Verse One]
God damn, ma'am
Can I take a bite of the ham-hock?
My cock is like a rock
Your son is like my brother
And with your wrinkled pussy you can be my lover
And I'll smother that shit like a biscuit
And have you sprung with the head of my dilznic
Won't treat you like a hoe on Figueroa
It's K-Dee the American Gigolo
And a nigga know you like what I write
Used to spend the night just to see you in tights
Working out to that bitch Jane Fonda
Ms. Parker may I call you Yolanda?
Cause you can see, I'm all grown up
And I got this player shit all sewn up
You five years from the 5-0, I'm twenty fo'
And I thought you should know

[Hook] {x2}
I'm into you now, into you now
Into you now, into you my black baby

[Verse Two]
You're buck wild like a horse
Divorce
And wanna get back in the mix of course
An old ass freak, trying to play chic
Don't worry about your son cause we can sneak
To the mozzy
To the wozzy
Can I help you with those groceries?
I love the way you cook
I love the way you look
I'm hooked, I feel like a crook
Or a cat burglar
Pussy murderer
Look at look at her
She's what I prefer
I can picture you
With a dick or two
In your mouth
You're from the south
You like it the old fashion way
But Ms. Parker please
Hands and knees
So I can squeeze
These
T.I.T.S
We'z out
I already got the room key
To the cozy spot that's hot where you can do me
To see you naked is a dream come true
So bring your ass over, oooh

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
It was on and I wrecked it
But to tell you the truth it wasn't what I expected
A little too loose from all that abuse from your ex
No more sex
I think I had enough, but we can be friends and stuff
Girl, I know it's rough
And we can have dinner
But you gotta stop blowing up my pager like the World Trade Center
Enter The Dragon, I thinking 'bout tagging
Your daughter, she's younger
And she hungers
For a father figure
My nuts are bigger than any other nigga
She let dick her
I think you should know
I think you a hoe
And, I think I better go
I hope you are stronger
But to tell you the truth I'm no longer

[Hook]

[Outro: K-Dee talking]
Get the fuck out my face. I can't fade you no more. You're too old for me. I can't even fuck with you. Well peep...is your daughter home? Well tell  her to come down stairs. Yeah. Well look...give her my pager number and tell her to page me. Yeah. Tell Ricky I came by
