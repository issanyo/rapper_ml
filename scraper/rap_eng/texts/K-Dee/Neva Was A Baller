[Intro]
You could feel all the tension building up from the convention as the hustlers began to arrive. There must've been 9,000 or more that came through the door, the time was 11:55

[Hook 1]
Baller, baller, baller can you come out to play?
Taking hoes out, always have to pay
I eat and I drink, free load everyday
And get the pussy anyway

[Verse One]
Never was a baller, never was a trick
Still had hoes on the dilznick
24/7
Sneaking dumb bitches in the house
While daddy would sleep on the couch
Had to tip toe, creep real slow
Damn, we made it, now it's time to fade it
She made a lot of noise so listen here buttercup
You're gonna have to shut the fuck up cause
Daddy don't like me fucking in the crib
Cause nine months later the baby needs a bib
For 18 years you'll be in my hair
Now I'm smarter than the average Huggy Bear
So go tell Starsky, go tell Hutch, I'm going dutch
Get these nuts
And if I needed some pussy all I had to do was caller
But no, I never was a baller

[Hook 2]
"I never have I never will" - Snoop Doggy Dogg
"Well I have never"
"See even though I got muscle that ain't my hustle" - Ice Cube 'What Can I Do (Remix)'
Never was a baller
"[?] pimp will slap every last bit of dog shit up out ya nigga"
"See even though I got muscle that ain't my hustle"
(K-Dee baby!)

[Verse Two]
Don't like school came up with a full cough
Can't wait till my moms pull off
Cause Ice Cube is coming over and we're both ditching
Eating cereal in the kitchen
Can't wait for the phone to ring
And bring yo' cousin with the dope ass figure to get with my nigga
So we can parlay in the covers
Back then we didn't have to use rubbers
Just let it fly on the mattress (god damn)
But here comes the bad actress
My ex-girlfriend standing on my lawn, once again it's on
I sing this song
"Why can't we be friends? Why can't we be friends? Why can't we be friend?
Hon. And do a two on one."
Yo I never was a baller
No never, no never
"I never have I never will"
Because I'm much too clever

[Hook 1]

[Verse Three]
Now a baller is the one who flaunts being rich
He flaunts his car, his doe just so he can get a bitch
But no not this kid, this is all I did
Just shoot game and then the boots came
That's how I played 'em as I laid 'em on the flo'
I dick 'em, dick 'em down till scream and scream for mo'
I make my own doe so a hoe could never get mine
Cause see I drove a bucket, they still let me fuck it
Just 18, fresh outta high school
Wasn't thinking about college cause I had street knowledge
Wasn't in a gang, couldn't bang so I didn't
My mouth stayed dry from all the game I was spittin'
To a honeydip till honey stripped to the nude
Then food came up and it fucked up my mood
Talking about a movie and a nice dinner yo
You better pop some popcorn and rent a video
Because I never get done I do the doing on the slimmy
Especially for them hoes that's yelling gimmie gimmie
I kick 'em to the curb, they deserve to be abused
I never was a baller cause ballers get used

"I never have I never will"
"Big baller from around the way"
Never was a baller
"Big baller from around the way"
"Big baller from around the way"
Never was a baller
"Big baller from around the way"

[Hook 1]

"Big baller from around the way"
