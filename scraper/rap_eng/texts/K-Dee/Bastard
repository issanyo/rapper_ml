[HOOK: K-Dee]
Raised as a black lip bastard (skrr skrr)
Sausin on you niggas like mustard (mustard)
Burry you alive in a casket (casket)
Your bitch she a thot and I smashed it (skrr skrr)
Pass her like spliff and puffed it (passed it)
Perky on roll yea I mashed it (mashed it)
Live by the code it's a secret don't mention
My passion for diamonds and cash nigga (cash nigga)
Raised as a black lip bastard (bastard)
Sausin on you niggas like mustard (mustard)
Burry you alive in a casket (thot)
Your bitch she a thot and I smashed it
Pass her like spliff and puffed it (passed it)
Perky on roll yea I mashed it (mashed it)

[Verse 1: Slycology]
Saucing on niggas with mustard
I'm getting my masters
Your bitch she a Thot and I smashed it
I'm working with passion
I don't follow fashion
Like Rambo my story is action
Raised as an orphan got locked up in coffins

And planning on getting the cotten
My niggas are high as the sky
You know  that we floating
Like water we flowing
While this niggas yawning ey

These niggas been sleepin'
These niggas been tripping
These niggas been falling and slipping
Everything niggas they sipping
(Sipping water at the pond)
Actavis niggas been killing
We are the ones that been chilling
We have been taking them numbers
You niggas could never follow everything that we say
And we niggas at 3hc runnin' the city
We here to take your bitch then we will leave you
Bring in the stem and play in this bed
These nights are mad, they don't give a dam and we do the same
