[Intro: Christon Gray]
Some days I feel so close
And some days it seems so far
Surely goodness and mercy
Shall always follow and never return void
Oh
Hallelujah being the highest praise
I’ll give it to you gladly all my days
And I just hope that all my life conveys that I mean every word
Even with evil with me
Jesus...oh Jesus
My Jesus, that's why I love you so

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Yeah man
Feeling good out here today
Yeah, ok

Boy I feel like I'm gliding
Running to make my election sure, Obama-Biden
Every day I'm homiciding
Killing that feeling within me, sometimes it's traumatizing
But bro it's not surprising that it brings me joy when I cling to his Word, I'm promise riding
I promise I been regretting it when I'm not abiding
I been exposed but I'm in Him, sinning, synonym: I’m in hiding
(That's what I feel)
Feel like I got a hole in one
They throwing shade but I'm beaming cause I know the Son
Feel like I'm dreaming with eyes open, my mind's floating
Gliding by sky rises, cloud nine is my ocean
Swimming in that ozone layer, layer hey I'm soaking
But he lit that fire up under my behind, I'm smoking
Can't undermine him, he's higher than us you silly boy
The God who say all that, the same man, I'm feeling joy

[Hook: Elhae]
The way you got me up so high, I don't see me coming down
If you only know what I went through but I'm still standing now
And you know I don't care about no hate, these clouds in my face
I get higher, higher, higher

You don't know what he did for me
You don't know (x5)
Gliding high and I'm feeling free
You don't know (x5)

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Got me feeling like Cleveland when they say that Lebron back Wanna throw parades with streamers and all that
I'm feeling good (I'm feeling good)
And if you read that King James
You can I say "I feeleth good,forgetteth about the rain"
Forget about the clouds over my head
Bro I can't feel the ground, no anchors on my legs
(That's sky high!)
I’m drifting off today without no bed
Feet hanging like some dreads, but don’t twist what I said
When I say I'm floating high as ever
I don't mean that Denver mile-high buzz, I can do better
I don't wile out in them loud night clubs, I got forever
With the Most High I hit jackpots without no lever
Let me be clear: the only God I fear
Dwells in the high and holy place and bro he got me here
My soul got purchased and my sin got kicked off
Won't be no return; prepare for lift off

[Hook: Elhae]
