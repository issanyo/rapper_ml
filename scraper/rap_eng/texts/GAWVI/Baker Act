[Verse 1: Aklesso]
Yeah, I need Jesus, I need peace of mind
Hennessy help me sleep at night
In my dreams, I see when I die
So don't ask me how I’m doing, 'cause I'm dead inside
Where I’ve been, I don't know man
I been wandering, I'm a nomad
I been searching for my purpose
And I'm learning that God's working
I just can't find what my worth is, ahh
Yeah, pour up some lean 'cause I've been falling, man
Get more Gs, I lost my calling, yeah
I’m battling with my mind
I’m battling with my mind
I'm battling with my mind, yeah
Down on my knees, I’ve been calling, yeah
Jehovah-Jireh, I am falling now
I'm battling with my mind
I'm battling with my mind
God, please will you give me a sign?
Yeah

[Verse 2: GAWVI]
I think this is necessary if it ain't right
All my life, I’ve had a fear, how will I die?
Pull up on the skrrt, skrrt, I can see the light
I've been doing skrrt, skrrt, got me going wild
Battery steady on low, I don't know when I go home
I've been all dead inside
Help me go find my soul
Help me go find my soul
Oh anxiety I fight, with all the tears in my eye
Devil, don't go and try
Then tell me bout your crazy life
I've been needing Jesus to save me now
I've been so alone these days, ahh
I feel all this shame, I don't care right now
I need you to save, Jesus save us

[Outro: GAWVI]
Woo-hoo, ooh, ooh
Uh-huh
Woo-hoo
Uh-huh
Woo-hoo
Uh-huh
