[Verse 1]
Boy I told them we cold
Block is hot, but we good
Till it's over we bold
I know we misunderstood
I know they pressing me, they want me sweating, believe me but we never could
So when that weather be heating up bet you'll still see us up under the hood
Ice cold, watch your steps
I'm 'bout to watch my breath
So cold ain't got no threats
Stand firm, arms folded across my chest
So cold, won't settle
Winter time, on schedule
Way low, got our own level
So cold need a cold medal

[Pre-Hook]
Leveled up to 'bout ten thousand
Leveled up to 'bout twenty thousand
Leveled up to 'bout thirty thousand
If they drop us below zero, we ain't moving we too froze

[Hook]
We can't move we too cold
Can't move, too cold
Can't move (Too Cold)
(Repeat)

[Post-Hook]
We gon weather any weather
Won't fall down in no pressure
I want my ego below zero
When I'm humble I'm better
Boy they sick, get stretchers
This cold world will come get you
We still fly with no feathers
They'll pull you down if you let them

[Verse 2]
The clique froze
I don't mean ice on the wrist though
I mean we ain't changing, to get dough
Cold don't mean we ain't lit though
You might be tripping if you see the vision you catch at the clique's shows
Fueled by the risen who's living, while others spit fire we spit snow
One time for my soldiers
Two times for y'all who got that cross on y'all shoulders
We ain't gon let the world mold us man
So cold like the wind hit us
Blue steel, never been stiller
Won't give-in, see them shiver
Grab a chinchilla

[Pre-Hook]
Leveled up to 'bout ten thousand
Leveled up to 'bout twenty thousand
Leveled up to 'bout thirty thousand
If they drop us below zero, we ain't moving we too froze

[Hook]
We can't move we too cold
Can't move, too cold
Can't move (Too Cold)
(Repeat)

[Post-Hook]
We gon weather any weather
Won't fall down in no pressure
I want my ego below zero
When I'm humble I'm better
Boy they sick, get stretchers
This cold world will come get you
We still fly with no feathers
They'll pull you down if you let them
Too cold
Too cold
Too cold
