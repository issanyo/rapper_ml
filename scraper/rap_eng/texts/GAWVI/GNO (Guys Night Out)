[Chorus: Gawvi]
Where we go tonight?
Yeah it's money time
What’re we gonna do?
Like it's Fortnite
Where we go tonight?
Maybe to Shanghai
'Bout to pop off
How we survive
Where we go tonight?
Yeah it’s money time
What're we gonna do?
Like it's Fortnite
Where we go tonight
Maybe to Shanghai
'Bout to pop off
How we survive
I've been down on the low
Got the plug on the phone, ah
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I’m here ’til the mornin', ah

[Verse 1: Aklesso]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Flippin’ it up
Takin' the homies that's up
Oh my God, yeah
I'm in the killin’, I'm like shot
You cannot hate on my bars
Hey that's trippy and we know
Me and my bros we takin' over
Yeah I'm chillin' with my soldiers
Yeah we steady stayin' sober
You can't play me no we grown up
With God's plan in my head, yeah
They were shootin' fast
Shootin' shootin' back
Holy water splash
These are the foolish clones
God protect my friends
From the M-I-As where they do that at

[Chorus: Gawvi]
Where we go tonight?
Yeah it's money time
What're we gonna do?
Like it's Fortnite
Where we go tonight?
Maybe to Shanghai
'Bout to pop off
How we survive
Where we go tonight?
Yeah it's money time
What're we gonna do?
Like it's Fortnite
Where we go tonight
Maybe to Shanghai
'Bout to pop off
How we survive
I've been down on the low
Got the plug on the phone, ah
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm here 'til the mornin', ah

[Verse 2: Gawvi]
Ayy, yeah, I just need a van, yeah
The homies about to flex tonight
Pull up with the check, (skrrt, skrrt) yeah, yeah
They say we too lit
Even without the sip
She said we legit
I'ma still leave a tip
Time fly buyin' quick
We still feel like kids
Run and tell my bros
That's a cold for your sins
We didn't let her die, all alone, with the crew
We didn't let her die, all alone, with the crew

[Chorus: Gawvi]
Where we go tonight?
Yeah it's money time
What're we gonna do?
Like it's Fortnite
Where we go tonight?
Maybe to Shanghai
'Bout to pop off
How we survive
Where we go tonight?
Yeah it's money time
What're we gonna do?
Like it's Fortnite
Where we go tonight
Maybe to Shanghai
'Bout to pop off
How we survive
I've been down on the low
Got the plug on the phone, ah
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm here 'til the mornin', ah
