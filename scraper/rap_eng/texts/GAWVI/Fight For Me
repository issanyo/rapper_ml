[Pre-Chorus: GAWVI]
Yeah, yeah, I need You to fight for me
When I don't know what I believe, hey, hey
Why does everybody leave?
Show me what it's like to dream

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Hey, go, you the best, ah

Hey, yeah, yeah, wave 'em high, side to side
Let 'em know, we gon' rise, we gon' shine (Hey, hey, hey)
I need You to fight for me (Yeah)
I know You're my therapy (Yeah)
I know why we fight
It's just to know we try
Ayy, yeah

[Verse 1: GAWVI]
Eyedrops, how do I start it off?
Pullin' all these hours, trying to keep it all clear
I got way too many thoughts
Fighting these expectations, got me feeling stuck like
Ayy, yeah, think I feel it all the time
Ayy, yeah, did I really miss my prime?
I don't know how to cope when I'm low
But I know that You're close, that You're close
I've been away, yeah, losing my faith, yeah
Hope I'm not late, trying to find grace, yeah
For my mistakes, ayy, I need to pray, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I need to pray, yeah, wake up to the mirror like

I know why we fight
It's just to know we try

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Say you gon' fight, you ain't try, you don't lie right
Send a prayer up, throw a line, you don't find time
Down yeah, homie, down yeah
Pick me up off of the ground, yeah
Almost drown, yeah, pull me out, yeah (Sheesh)
Wasn't in my right mind, yeah, yeah
Reach out for me like a lifeline
I've been with You so long it feel like a lifetime
So connected to You, I could be Your WiFi
Oh, it's a fight
Left hook, right cross, just hit right
Out my weight class, feels too light
Lose my faith, I lose my life
I've been lost and feeling lonely
Tell 'em they can't hold me
Lookin' in the mirror like, when You fighting for me?

[Pre-Chorus: GAWVI]
I need You to fight for me
When I don't know what I believe (Yeah)
Why does everybody leave? (Leave)
Show me what it's like to dream (Dream)

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Hey, go, You the best, ah
Hey, say it with your chest high
Hey, yeah, yeah, wave 'em high, side to side
Let 'em know, we gon' rise, we gon' shine (Hey, hey, hey)
I need You to fight for me, yeah, hey (Yeah)
I know You're my therapy, yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, wave 'em high, side to side
Let 'em know, we gon' rise, we gon' shine
Hey, I need You to fight for me, yeah, yeah (Fight)
I know You're my therapy, yeah, yeah
I know why we fight
It's just to know we try
I need You to fight for me
