[Verse 1: GAWVI]
Locked and loaded, can you take it?
Say a prayer, don't you fake it
Hollywood, blurry faces
They say it's real, it's just faded

[Refrain: GAWVI]
Riding 'round Sunset Boulevard
To have it all would you sell your soul?
All I know is I wouldn't mind
I wouldn't mind

[Pre-Chorus: GAWVI]
Say a prayer, don't you fall for them all
Take the L, walk away for tomorrow
This ain't a game, lose your life, no control
Just to be a slave

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Rock n roll, lights and smoke
Rock n roll, what a show, what a show
Don't you fall for rock and roll
Lights and smoke
Rock n roll, what a show, what a show
Don't you fall for rock n roll
Rock n roll, rock n roll, what a show
Don't you fall for rock n roll
Rock n roll, rock n roll, what a show
Don't you fall for...

[Verse 2: GAWVI]
It's a party, it's a party, oh
You so wasted, tell me you got Grammys
Yeah, you special
Riding 'raris, oh
I seen you crying tears on Rodeo

[Refrain: GAWVI]
Riding 'round Sunset Boulevard
To have it all would you sell your soul?
All I know is I wouldn't mind
I wouldn't mind

[Pre-Chorus: GAWVI]
Say a prayer, don't you fall for them all
Take the L, walk away for tomorrow
This ain't a game, lose your life, no control
Just to be a slave

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Rock n roll, lights and smoke
Rock n roll, what a show, what a show
Don't you fall for rock and roll
Lights and smoke
Rock n roll, what a show, what a show
Don't you fall for rock n roll
Rock n roll, rock n roll, what a show
Don't you fall for rock n roll
Rock n roll, rock n roll, what a show
Don't you fall for...

[Verse 3: Elhae]
I been faded, lookin' crazy
Mind is hazy
This town got me going out of my mind
(This town, this town, this town)
Elevated, mom I made it
Meditating, just tryna filter out all these lies
I can tell you how it feel when it's real
Five star meals in the crib in the Hills
Shorty from London and she wanna chill
Gets to the point where you do it for thrills
It's real, but it's not real life
Don't chase what it look like
Oh, how they wanna be alive
Without it I'm alright

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Rock n roll, lights and smoke
Rock n roll, what a show, what a show
Don't you fall for rock and roll
Lights and smoke
Rock n roll, what a show, what a show
Don't you fall for rock n roll
Rock n roll, rock n roll, what a show
Don't you fall for rock n roll
Rock n roll, rock n roll, what a show
Don't you fall for...
