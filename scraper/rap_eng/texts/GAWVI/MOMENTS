[Chorus]
I see all my favorite photos
When I'm low
Where did all these moments go?
Where they go?
I see my whole life just pass by
When did I die?
I'd do anything to have it
Have it right back
I see all my favorite photos
When I'm low
Where did all these moments go?
Where they go?
I see my whole life just pass by
When did I die?
I'd do anything to have it
Have it right back

[Post-Chorus]
I see all these moments pass, yeah
I see all these moments pass
Waving by
I see all these moments pass, yeah
I see all these moments pass
Waving by
Oh my, waving by

[Verse 1]
I've been feelin so blessed, oh my my
Hundred thousand on the wrist, oh my my (hundred on wrist)
What's the matter you paid whole lotta (guap)
Tell the truth, look at you
You went snooze
It's a vibe, it's a vibe
That's on you, you
Goin home, ride or die
Don't be who
Live today, way too young
That's the truth (truth)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Bridge 1]
All this lately drives me crazy
I've been fading
This ain't daisies, this ain't daisies, nah
All this lately drives me crazy
I've been fading
This ain't daisies, nah

[Chorus]
I see all my favorite photos
When I'm low
Where did all these moments go?
Where they go?
I see my whole life just pass by
When did I die?
I'd do anything to have it
Have it right back
I see all my favorite photos
When I'm low
Where did all these moments go?
Where they go?
I see my whole life just pass by
When did I die?
I'd do anything to have it
Have it right back

[Post-Chorus]
I see all these moments pass, yeah

Waving by
I see all these moments pass, yeah
I see all these moments pass
Waving by
Oh my, waving by

[Verse 2]
I've been feelin so blessed, oh my
Hundred thousand on the wrist, oh my
What's tonight you paid up whole lot
Tell the truth, look at you
You went snooze (night, night)
You just stuck all on your phone (brr, brr)
That's what make you go alone
You just want to be home
Live today, way too young
That's the truth
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm 'bout to die to myself
That's the new meaning of wealth
This is the fight and the bout
Jesus you saved me from hell
Jesus you saved me from hell
I'm 'bout to die to myself
That's the new meaning of wealth
That's the new meaning of wealth

[Bridge 2]
All this lately drives me crazy
I've been fading
This ain't daisies, this ain't daisies, nah
All this lately drives me crazy
I've been fading
This ain't daisies, nah

[Chorus]
I see all my favorite photos
When I'm low
Where did all these moments go?
Where they go?
I see my whole life just pass by
When did I die?
I'd do anything to have it
Have it right back
I see all my favorite photos
When I'm low
Where did all these moments go?
Where they go?
I see my whole life just pass by
When did I die?
I'd do anything to have it
Have it right back

[Post-Chorus]
I see all these moments pass, yeah

Waving by
I see all these moments pass, yeah
I see all these moments pass
Waving by
Oh my, waving by

[Outro]
It's a Florida thing
