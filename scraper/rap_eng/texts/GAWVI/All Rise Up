[Intro]
If we all rise up (oh yeah, oh yeah)
If we all rise up (oh yeah, oh yeah)
(oh yeah, oh yeah) (oh yeah, oh yeah)
If we all rise up (oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Verse 1]
I know I don't deserve to touch the mic bro
But this craft is something that I would fight for
I'm in the lab with this pen and a pad
Knowing I might finish last
That ain't really why I write though
Let's go back in time to '04
I'm in 1-1-6 quickly I was on board
Fast forward four years we on tour
And we ain't notice what He had in store
But now here we are
Ten years later
Flows got greater
Minds got closer
Plus there's more haters
Sayin' we just do it for dough
But they won't break us
'Cause the Lord we serve with the flow
He is so gracious
And if they ask me why I do it
I tell 'em it's the music of a movement
Yeah I'm speaking for my Unashamed crew
That ain't never touched the stage but they walkin' they just doin' this
Rise up

[Hook]
If we all rise up
That'd be my dream
That we should all rise up
And give a standing o for the King
Cuz He's good
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
(oh yeah, oh yeah)(3x)

[Verse 2]
We been from bootleg tours
To high quality shows
From 'Crae making beats
To high quality pros
Ridin' in our cars
To sittin' on planes
To tour bus rides
But the mission ain't changed
More fans in the stands
Don't mean we made it
God ain't more pleased
'Cause radio stations played it
You know I'm prayin'
We stay seekin' his face
So we not disqualified from the race
Race
And my brothers promise me this
If notoriety get the best of me make me quit
Quit
And I promise that I'mma stay
By you and edify you no matter how it gets
And to the fans
Please promise me too
You listen to the words
But leave 'em and go and do
We do it for the Lord
But still we do it for you
They ain't never seen the gospel at work
Show 'em it's true
And rise

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't retired but I thought about it
I feel called to be a pastor; I'm all about it
See His glory in His word and I gotta shout it
So I'm just trying to figure out how I can shout the loudest
Plus, I saw its hard to be pastor
When after the service you gotta get out and rap for the masses
I'm feelin' torn in my heart
I had to pray
My health is making it harder to find a way
But if I ever do leave the game
Gotta leave 'em with something with meaning
I proclaim
It don't matter if my name get deleted what remains
Is the mission that he missin' which is liftin' up His name
I read John's vision and it's plain
Christ reigns so I'm stickin' in my lane
Rap don't need me
Reach don't need me
Christ don't need me
I'm limpin' cuz I'm lame

But I'm carried by the one and only healer
'Bout the transition homie, faith is getting realer
I'm just waiting for my Savior to reveal a
Clearer vision of the only peace, be stiller
I'm filled up in Him
I'm still tucked in Him
Once was lust driven
Now I must trust the Risen
Hey, pray for your brother cuz I know that luck isn't
The way I'mma succed, nothings up to luck is it?
Of course not
Look I ain't done tryna' make a change
I'm just switchin' up the method let me make it plain
Tryna' find my position; I ain't forsake the game
And the win is the glory of the greatest Name
Rise
