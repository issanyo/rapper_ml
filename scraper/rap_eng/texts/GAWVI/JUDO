[Intro: Tree Giants]
In my mind, you taste like a promise
And I'll talk when we're honest
I wear them in my eyes
In my mind, the weapons made to harm her
Are rusting in the armor
And no one should be blind
In my life

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
The first, the last, I got the moves like Jag
I'm cursed with swag, ain't nothin' worse than that
That hurt, that tax, they tryna take like half
Y'all TSA, get your hand up out of my bag
Look, my dad, my dad, I still ain't call him back
My pad, my pad, a pen bought me that
Then I spaz, I spaz, in your comment section, I black
My bad, my bad, my account must've got hacked
Ayy, I know you know you mad, I admit it, ayy
'Cause I ain't text you back but I tweeted, ayy
Yeah, my bro, I know that you had to see it
'Cause you send emoji faces all mad to my DM
Look, your t-shirt got rock 'n' roll
You don't listen to no rock 'n' roll
I'm 'bout peace like adios
My shirt off, that's soccer goals
Run the track, v√°monos
All Adidas on me
Oh, you holier than thou?
Aight, tell Jesus on me

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
Judo chop, judo, judo, judo chopstick, ayy
Judo chop, judo, judo, judo dropkick, ayy
Judo chop, then I judo, judo chopstick, ayy
Judo chop, then I judo, judo chop (chop)

[Verse 2: Wordsplayed]
Ayy, lo-fi, lo-fi, lo-fi, lo-fi, lo-fi (that lo)
Streets of L.A., baby, now you up on SoLa
Johnny, I never ever sold my soul out
Look like Eazy in that low-ride, yeah (skrt, skrt, skrt)
I'm first, I'm last, in Saint John, that mass
My neck, my back, I put 'preme on that (skrt)
My wrist, that wrist, let's make something compact
My tape, my tape, let's turn that to a plaque (okay)
My bape, that bape, I'm goin' ape on this track (keep going)
My wave, my wave, you can't surf on that (keep going)
Behave, behave, boy, don't you know that you black?
Okay, I will, when white Jesus come back
Alright, I took the mark of the hype beast
Mob with my bro like I'm Isley
Chances I quit are unlikely
I leave the mic on a IV
Stood with the league like it's Ivy
Let 'em decide, that's O'Reilly
Up on the five in the five speed
I pull away if they try me

[Chorus: Andy Mineo & Wordsplayed]
Judo chop, judo, judo, judo chopstick, ayy
Judo chop, judo, judo, judo dropkick, ayy
Judo chop, then I judo, judo chopstick, ayy
Ayy, judo, judo chop (chop)

[Interlude: Tree Giants]
In my mind, the weapons made to harm her
Are rusting in the armor
And no one should be blind
In my life

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
They're crazy
Ayy, judo
Judo my chop
Judo chop
Please clap
