[Verse 1]
What'd you do to me?
Baby, baby
You got me going out my mind
It's a mystery, I can't explain it
I never know what I might find

[Pre-Chorus]
We've got the makings of something so beautiful
But I got to be real, oh
Wish I could see inside to everything you desire
You really got me going out

[Chorus]
Got me going out my mind
Wanna feel it all the time

[Verse 2]
What'd you do to me?
Baby, baby
I can see it in your eyes
What it's meant to be eventually
You're gonna come to me in time

[Pre-Chorus]
We've got the makings of something so beautiful
But I got to be real, oh
Wish I could see inside
To everything you desire
You really got me going out

[Chorus]
Got me going out my mind
Wanna feel it all the time
Got me going out my mind
Wanna feel it all the time

[Interlude]
I wanna feel it all the time
What'd you do to me?
I can't explain
And I'm going out my mind
Just you and me, you and me my baby
I can't explain
And I'm going out my mind

[Chorus]
Got me going out my mind
Wanna feel it all the time

[Outro](x6)
Oh, what'd you do to me?
You're too good to believe
Always stay true to me
Oh, you got me going out my mind
