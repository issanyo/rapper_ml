[Chorus: GAWVI]
Never heard about this
Never heard about love
Run away with me tonight
Nobody but us
Cruising round in my city
With my top down, my whole crew with me
Riding 'round, I lockdown
We misfits til we die, yeah
Never heard about this
Never heard about love
Run away with me tonight
Nobody but us
Cruising round in my city
With my top down, my whole crew with me
Riding 'round, I lockdown
We misfits til we die, yeah

[Verse 1: Fern]
I'm a misfit til I die
They just gone have to live with it
Only spit that exquisite
I hope y'all get to experience
And learn something from my experience
Okay, I always stood out
Cause I made it a point to never judge anybody by they exterior
Let God rebuild your interior
His misfit army growing by the today
It's amazing to see where He taking us
And how fast He's done it like right away
Gotta whole generation of misfits behind us
But I gotta give God all the praise
For like all my days
Is something better?
I oughta say, I think not
And I don't care who you think is hot
Cause misfits always against the grain
But we always found up on top
This band of brothers won't stop
Cause the favor of God is upon us
I'm sorry for those that are hoping we'll flop
And that never gone happen so stop
Cause the souls who are mentioned we love on these kids
So they know that our God is faithful
Outcasts and rejects grateful
Destined for life with the savior
And that's major
Cause yesterday one died from a taser
And a life based solely on paper
We done changing the game, embrace us
Fernie, Social

[Bridge: Marty]
Misfit til I die, oh whoa
Misfit til I die, oh whoa
I ain't tryna fight it, oh no, no
This is who I am, oh whoa
Misfit til I die, oh whoa
Misfit til I die, oh whoa
I ain't tryna fight it, oh no, no
This is who I am, yeah

[Verse 2: Marty]
Uh, right
Never had a Plan B
Barely finished high school, still living with my family
All my friends are getting married, asking me when I'm next
Probably when I stop texting these girls in my contacts
You better settle down, that's what my mom said
I haven't met the girl I want to meet my mom yet
And if I'm honest, I haven't brought this to God yet
Too busy turning all these crowds into a mosh pit
The cost of following your dreams
When everyone around you who's following just leaves
I think it’s probably me, I’m still hiding in the leaves
And God is checking on me but I blamed it all on Eve
Yo something's wrong with me
I still thank God every chance I get
Rappers hit us up for features and, I ain't answered yet
Leaders of the New School, it’s like my life is just a test
Misfits what I claim it's in my blood and I ain't never switched
This is me

[Bridge: Marty]
Misfit til I die, oh whoa
Misfit til I die, oh whoa
I ain't tryna fight it, oh no, no
This is who I am, oh whoa
Misfit til I die, oh whoa
Misfit til I die, oh whoa
I ain't tryna fight it, oh no, no
This is who I am, yeah

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Never heard about this
Never heard about love
Run away with me tonight
Nobody but us
Cruising round in my city
With my top down, my whole crew with me
Riding 'round, I lockdown
We misfits til we die, yeah
Never heard about this
Never heard about love
Run away with me tonight
Nobody but us
Cruising round in my city
With my top down, my whole crew with me
Riding 'round, I lockdown
We misfits til we die, yeah
