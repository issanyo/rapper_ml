Nobody can take it from me, sweet victory

[Verse: Trip Lee]
They see me on the stage
They like that boy the man
They hear play on them songs
They clappin' in them stands
They like "I bet you got a lot of them stacks in rubber bands."
So when I say "It's been a few hard years" they think I'm playin'
But you don't know my life boy
You don't know my life boy
You don't know what it's been like on my wife
Don't know my fight boy
Being in the trenches steady tryna' fight my foes
And when I couldn't fight no more it brought me low, low
It brought me low I know can't bet it low

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
I feel thorns where my crown was
I be weak but I'm alive
From the dusk until dawn (yeah)
I'll survive because I got, sweet victory
Nobody can take it from me, sweet victory
Cause I got sweet victory

[Verse 2: Leah Smith & Gawvi]
The crown of thorns
Declares you're King
A scarlet robe can't cloak Your majesty
They nailed Your hands
You mailed our death
From the cross You reigned
Your Kingdom knows no end
Oh, Jesus (Whoa)
You won it all
Oh, Jesus (Whoa)
Victorious
Oh, Jesus (Whoa)
You won it all
Oh, Jesus (Whoa)
Victorious
Oh, Jesus (Whoa)
