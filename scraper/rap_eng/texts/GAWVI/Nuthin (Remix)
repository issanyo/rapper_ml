[Hook - William McDowell & Lecrae]
Here we go again in
Circles, I think I heard it
All, we been here
Before, but we need something
More, something
More, something
More, what you say
I can't hear cause you ain't talking 'bout

Nuthin (ain't talking 'bout nuthin)
(x4)

What you talking 'bout
They be talking 'bout the same old thing
I'm a have to call a foul in the game (what you talking 'bout)
A little money now you all OG
Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me (they ain't talking 'bout)
Nuthin


[Verse 1 - FLO]
Where the real ones at gon' call 'em out
I ain't finna talk about what they talkin' 'bout
Heard it all and it's garbage you know that
But if we talkin' 'bout the bars I could chalk 'em out
Easy money but I don't be stuntin'
From the heart my supporters don't owe me nothin' (not a dime)
I would try to be a star but then I thought if I ain't
Wit Him for the struggle then it won't mean nothin'
Another young boys head getting red dotted
Single mother prostituting by the dead bodies
Child lost now her fathers in despair
I wonder if these deeper rappers even practice how to care
We don't know the drama that a smile cover
On the edge I'm just tryna talk 'em down from it
See there's power in the word of your mouth budget
But if you ain't got love you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Threat]
I need a whistle not a mistletoe
Save the kisses for the misses now I'm finna blow
Sound old and not so original
I can't listen to long while your miserable
And how come every record sound the same now
Prolly cause they got the same script and they lay it down
And meanwhile a kid getting laid down
His best friend ran up on him shooting 80 rounds
Errbody looking like it wasn't me
Tryna keep your hands clean for a couple G's
I don't hang wit these suckas boy I'm sucka free
Getting owned by the man it ain't nothing sweet
I do this for the kids you manipulate
Hoping they escape from the fate of 'em living fake
I thank my Creator that I been awake
I can see that swimming in that lake is a big mistake

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - FLO & (Threat)]
We need more than the lies that we're getting sold
People out here dying and it's getting old
Yeah they give us something shiny but it's never gold
Just let me know if I been trippen ok ready go

(I mean once I'm in the game if you sell a soul
You would bare fruit, he would die, he a vegetable
Word the fool'll put his pride on a pedestal
Then he cry when they fly him under medical)

It's time that we let 'em know, that you living in
Denial if you thinkin' you just die and the credits roll
As far a your idols I'm a little skeptical
Your top 3 not me boy they never FLO

(That's unacceptable, bread is for eleven
Seven messengers from heaven severe heads of the beheaded
It's unethical, bless He in heaven who is merciful
I'm enlisted man so when He comes I'll be first to go)
