[Verse 1]
This ain't a game for me
I hardly ever sleep
'Cause I been trying to find the words
To explain the things that you do to me
I love you so bad that it hurts

[Refrain]
I'll just sing and worship
But that ain't enough, no
That ain't enough, no
Created to your purpose
But that ain't enough, no
That ain't enough

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be better, be better for you
Wish I understood more of your grace
Oh, your love
Yes, your love

[Chorus]
And it never fails
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, and it never fails
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[verse 2]
I never get to see, see the good in things
Oh, I been lonely and left cold
Feeling paralyzed, but now I realize
It wasn't unconditional

[Refrain]
I'll just sing and worship
But that ain't enough, no
That ain't enough, no
Created to your purpose
But that ain't enough, no
That ain't enough

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be better, be better for you
Wish I understood more of your grace
Oh, your love
Yes, your love

[Chorus]
Oh, and it never fails
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, and it never fails
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
You loved me, now I, all I do is love you more
Not gonna love like this, oh, love like this, I need you more
You loved me, now I, all I do is love you more
Not gonna love like this, oh, love like this, I need you more

[Pre-Hook]
I just wanna be better, be better for you
Wish I understood more of your grace
Oh, your love, yes, your love

[Hook]
Oh, and it never fails
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, and it never fails
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
You loved me, now I, all I do is love you more
Not gonna love like this, oh, love like this, I need you more
You loved me, now I, all I do is love you more
Not gonna love like this, oh, love like this, I need you more
