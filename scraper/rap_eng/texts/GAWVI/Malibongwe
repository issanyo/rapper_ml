[Verse 1]
Uh
I told G "Yo G, I feel OG, like I'm an OG, homie
Oh yeah, they know me but they don't know me
You know how that be, homie"
They think it's so sweet
They see my tweets and where I be goin'
They kept my vine every once in a while and figured that rain would be blowin'
I wish they knew it, mama is a widow
Still goin' through it and my step-dad passed
I woulda never knew it
I'm still right here, tryna influence
Work through the pain, give it all to the King
I ain't bein' my thing, man, I'm doin' his plan
I'm grown, grown man with a fam
I'm on, me and the whole clan 'cause

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The foundation's concrete, the jungle's waitin' for me
There's no church in the wild, well here I am for these pagans to see
Yeah, I'm in the jungle humbly rumblin' with the blood of the covenant
From the dead I am comin'
And with the [?]
To the love of the Rock
For the love of the Rock
You can love it or not

[Chorus]
Mali-mali-mali-mali-malibongwe
Mali-mali-mali-mali-malibongwe
That's the sound of them boys in the jungle, uh
They tryna hustle to make it outta the jungle, yeah
Mali-mali-mali-mali-malibongwe
Mali-mali-mali-mali-malibongwe
That's the sound of them boys in the jungle, uh
They tryna rumble 'cause it's a power struggle, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, uh
These days everybody on a power trip
Devour that, devour this
Not a sour lip on my crew
Skyward to earth and we move
Louder than a mountain, cave in that room
From the moon to the tomb we are consumed with dreams
To set the world ablaze all like a lase' and praise You
But how many really know what power is?
'Cause power ain't how a coward lives
Want it quick like Usain Bolt, drunk off the power
When the power's lit
It ain't just actin' faint or actin' a fool with no restraint
So we're movin' on these cats like progress our work in the paint, what?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Evil is alive, alive and I seen it with my eyes, eyes
Still all that I despise, it poised to me, myself and I, I
So I try to turn from these lies
And burn it all like a klepto
Gotta let it loose and just let go
Don't stress though, I'm blessed though

[Chorus]
Mali-mali-mali-mali-malibongwe
Mali-mali-mali-mali-malibongwe
That's the sound of them boys in the jungle, uh
They tryna hustle to make it outta the jungle, yeah
Mali-mali-mali-mali-malibongwe
Mali-mali-mali-mali-malibongwe
That's the sound of them boys in the jungle, uh
They tryna rumble 'cause it's a power struggle, yeah
