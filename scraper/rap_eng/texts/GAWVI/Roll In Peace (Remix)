[Intro]
G Styles on the track!

You ain't the one for me
You ain't got shit I need
Want me to take my time with you
Maybe I'm not your speed
Maybe I'm out your league
You ain't even got no cheese
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Maybe I'm just too street
I can't even roll in peace
Everybody notice me
I can't even go to sleep
I'm rolling on a bean
They tried to give me eight got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece
If you wanna leave just leave
But you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got for me
Ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said that you was gon' ride for me

Tell me again
How we'll be lovers and friends
Tell me again
How we'll be lovers and friends

You used to tell me that you was the one for me but
I just been feeling like this shit ain't for me
I've been all in my feelings man this shit ain't even me
Swore up and down that you love me but you never showing me
You think I'm good 'cause I'm out here in designer baby?
Swear you a joke, you really broke, let's just be honest baby
I really hope that you just get this understood
We ain't compatible baby this shit ain't good
You don't even pick your phone up
Out here picking these hoes up
I got different niggas on my line
Curving different niggas all the time

You ain't showing me the love you say you got for me
Ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said that you was gon' ride for me

Tell me again (just tell me one more time)
How we'll be lovers and friends
Tell me again
How we'll be lovers and friends
