[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I know that you deserve it all and all of me even
When I know I fall, I can't believe I'm gone
And I know that you always show me grace
Even though I run place to place, I love that you found me
I know that you deserve it all and all of me even
When I know I fall, I can't believe I'm gone
And I know that you always show me grace
Even though I run place to place, I love that you found me


[Chorus](x2)
I know that you deserve it all and all of me
When I know I fall, I can't believe I'm gone
And I know that you always show me grace

Even though I run place to place, I love that you found me

[Chorus](x2)
I know that you deserve it all and all of me even
When I know I fall, I can't believe I'm gone
And I know that you always show me grace
Even though I run place to place, I love that you found me

[Outro]
