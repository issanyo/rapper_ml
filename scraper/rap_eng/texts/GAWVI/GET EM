[Intro]
Gawvi blew the speaker
Get 'em!
Gawvi blew the speaker
I got 'em, get 'em, I got 'em

[Chorus: Aklesso]
Hey, oh, huh, gettin' em, yeah
Told you, we gonna go get 'em
You tryna mosh with the squad?
Get 'em, we did what we said, ayy
You cannot stop what is God's
Lethal, we bringin' back bars, ayy
You know we killin' the odds
Bull in the paint, whatchu gon' think?
I'ma drop 50 on y'all, yeah
Whatcha gon' do when we come through?
Lock all you, block all you dogs
Yeah, what?
Lock all you, block all you dogs
Yeah, what?
Lock all you, block all you dogs

[Verse 1: GAWVI]
Got 'em invited, this is a riot
Yeah, we like God, killin' Goliath (Ayy)
Don't need your guidance
I look to God
This ain't performance, more like I'm Jordan
Sick with the game
Don't need your fortune, huh? We got the foreign
Woo, woo
Yeah, climb on the gold (Climb on the gold)
Hittin' the goal (Hittin' the goal)
Off in a boat (Off in a boat, hey)
Run for it, stop snorin'
You know it, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Rhomar Jessy]
Yams, baby, yams, bae
Finna leave the beat purple (Uh)
Since the kids with bifocals (Uh)
I was focused with the vocals (Uh)
Made a name for the locals (Uh)
Made a vow and a promise
Before Annie died, I had to decide
If I'm in it for the long haul, I
Turned a nickel to a dime while
The rest of them nickel-and-diming
Ain't with all the bickering, babe can't
Afford the lights flickering, baking
I got bills to pay, I got meals to eat
I got dreams to chase, and no sheep to count
I just need to map all of these amounts
Into the account 'til the trumpet sound

[Chorus: Aklesso]
Hey, oh, huh, gettin' em, yeah
Told you, we gonna go get 'em
You tryna mosh with the squad?
Get 'em, we did what we said, ayy
You cannot stop what is God's
Lethal, we bringin' back bars, ayy
You know we killin' the odds
Bull in the paint, whatchu gon' think?
I'ma drop 50 on y'all, yeah
Whatcha gon' do when we come through?
Lock all you, block all you dogs
Yeah, what?
Lock all you, block all you dogs
Yeah, what?
Lock all you, block all you dogs

[Verse 3: TROSSTHEGIANT]
It's whitey, the GIANT
I'd plan on retirement
Been bossin' up and it's tirin'
Been in the booth with the finest
I've been perfectin' this science
Passed casts with the mad plaques
Labels passing on me and it's alright
And mad guys tryna call back
And they blame it on they freakin' bad sight
Speakin' to kids and I'm watchin' my tongue
24 hours, a session could run
Spittin' to end you with love
Tough as a mug, you don't want nothin' from us
Bruh, what have you done?
They tryin' to ask me, "Where are you from?"
Give 'em the look like, "Ooh, you done"
Reach in my basket, make him my sun
Baow!

[Verse 4: Aklesso]
Huh? What the goofy wanna say?
I show up, but I bet you won't spray
Show love, but a hater wanna hate
They really wanna see us in the grave
I don't speak no lies, we on a roll
Mama told me that I gotta grow
She in Haiti, fly her to a show
Mes amis, I do it for my zoes
Peter piper done picked apart my flows
Y'all picked me up and placed me on this globe
They need a banger, that Kurt Cobain
The demons thought they had me chained, but now I'm free to boast, like ayy
You're dealin' with the mind of the Most High (Ayy)
You're dealing with a squad that is co-signed
Doctor told me check the prognosis
Rap savior? Y'all know who Jay-Hova is?

[Chorus: Aklesso]
Hey, oh, huh, gettin' em, yeah
Told you, we gonna go get 'em
You tryna mosh with the squad?
Get 'em, we did what we said, ayy
You cannot stop what is God's
Lethal, we bringin' back bars, ayy
You know we killin' the odds
Bull in the paint, whatchu gon' think?
I'ma drop 50 on y'all, yeah
Whatcha gon' do when we come through?
Lock all you, block all you dogs
Yeah, what?
Lock all you, block all you dogs
Yeah, what?
Lock all you, block all you dogs
