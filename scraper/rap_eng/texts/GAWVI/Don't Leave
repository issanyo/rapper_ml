Hey, hey, hey

Andromeda, the stars align
I love how you shine (Hey, hey, hey)
Runnin' away, yeah, hey (Hey, hey, hey)
You got me chasin' (Hey, hey, hey)
And off the top, I know that you fly (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Feelin' like we fight every day (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm feelin' like I'm tired of the games (Oh no)
It's feelin' like we fell out of frame
But I know we'll work it out (Hey)
I've been feelin' like the time has gone all away (All away)
We can get it back, we got it all to stay (Oh no)
We gotta decide if we want that way
But I know I'll go away (Hey, hey)
We got seconds on the clock, uh
'Til we pull it off, I'm steamin' off the top
But I'ma take a break
'Cause I promise I'll stay
Even if we rock bottom, rock bottom
