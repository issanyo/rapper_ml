[Hook: Elhae]
I'm livin' like you should wanna know what I know
Remember this, you will always reap what you sow
Gotta keep it real, hold it down on the low
Never been fearin', nah, nah, nah, nah
So I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know
I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
They say I'm goin' out my head right now
They say I'm gon' fail right now
Maybe you was countin' bands all night
You trappin' out the bando now?
I wouldn't know
You ain't runnin' the streets, you just runnin' your mouth
I don't hear what they speak
I just walk like I talk, got that light to my path
And that lamp to my feet
But the feelin' so sweet, got me feelin' like a beast
A sickness and God as my witness
Boy, the foreign car makin' my pockets pretentious, Lord
Somebody help me
I done seen things I don't wanna see
I'm out runnin' through the streets
Heard somebody callin' me and sayin' we should meet
But I wouldn't know
Yeah, they probably talkin' 'bout me
Probably plenty of 'em sayin' that they doubt me
Keep them folk from  'round me
Father, keep me grounded
I wouldn't know cause I never be around them, no
20, 50, 100's, stuntin', stuntin', stuntin'
Look what we becomin'
Heard that reaper coming but this what you wanted
So I wouldnâ€™t know

[Hook: Elhae]
I'm livin' like you should wanna know what I know
Remember this, you will always reap what you sow
Gotta keep it real, hold it down on the low
Never been fearin', nah, nah, nah, nah
So I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know
I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know

[Verse 2: KB]
Hundred bands, you got a hundred grand, hundred grand
That is easily a scholarship
You'd rather go the club and blow all of it
I don't wanna judge, but you won't get your honor, yeah
We don't care what you did on the 'gram
Boy, you aborted the mission and I got the sonogram
Haven't you, haven't you noticed
Rappers they flex on the place where they come from
They brag that they eatin' while we got no groceries
American dreams
Barely Americans really do dream
That couldn't leave heritage, we marry codeine
Start from the bottom and never do leave, geez
I am for the people, you are for the paper
Breakin' cycles, make disciples that's all that I know
Made it out to make a route
Hate about us makin' clout
Racin' 'bout what faith endowed
See amazin' grace, invading spaces, changin' places
Now

[Hook: Elhae & KB]
I'm livin' like you should wanna know what I know
I know nothing else
Remember this, you will always reap what you sow
Gotta keep it real, hold it down on the low
Never been fearin', nah, nah, nah, nah
So I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know
I wouldn't know, I wouldn't know
