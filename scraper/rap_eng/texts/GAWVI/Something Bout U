[Verse 1]
There's a love, there's a luck
That's creeping up on us
Falling fast, speeding up
Close my eyes and breathe for once
And I'm sorry I was so unsure, unsure
I think maybe I just needed time
Cause the truth is I've been yours

[Pre-Chorus]
And my heart goes thun, thun-thun, thun-thun-thun, thun, thun, thun
Thun, thun-thun-thun, ooh, oh-oh-oh
Thun, thun-thun, like a big explosion
Thun, thun-thun-thun, ooh, oh-oh-oh
Thun, thun-thun, thun-thun-thun, thun, thun, thun
Thun, thun-thun-thun, ooh, oh-oh-oh
Thun, thun-thun, like a big explosion
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
You're blushing, I love it
Oh, oh, oh
Just trust it, it's crazy how it happened to us

[Chorus]
Something 'bout you, something 'bout your love
Oh, love
Nothing matters, nothing else but us
Oh, us
And now that I'm awakened it's a rush
A rush
Oh, now there's no more chasing
Cause your love is enough

[Verse 2]
Make a cheers, make a toast
To never letting go
Take my hand, took my soul
I'm right where I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
And my heart goes thun, thun-thun, thun-thun-thun, thun, thun, thun
Thun, thun-thun-thun, ooh, oh-oh-oh
Thun, thun-thun, like a big explosion
Thun, thun-thun-thun, ooh, oh-oh-oh
Thun, thun-thun, thun-thun-thun, thun, thun, thun
Thun, thun-thun-thun, ooh, oh-oh-oh
Thun, thun-thun, like a big explosion
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
You're blushing, I love it
Oh, oh, oh
Just trust it, it's crazy how it happened to us

[Chorus]
Something 'bout your, something 'bout your love
Oh, love
Nothing matters, nothing else but us
Oh, us
And now that I'm awakened it's a rush
A rush
Oh no, there's no more chasing
Cause your love is enough

[Bridge]
All this time I just been waiting
Now that I got you I won't let go
'Cause I know it's better

[Chorus]
Something 'bout you, something 'bout your love
Oh, love
Nothing matters, nothing else but us
Oh, us

[Outro]
I'm awakened cause your love is enough
