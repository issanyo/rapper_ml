[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
I feel thorns where my crown was
I be weak but I'm alive
From the dusk until dawn (yeah)
I'll survive because I got sweet victory
Nobody can take it from me sweet victory
'Cause I got sweet victory, yeah

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
You see me limpin'
I know you see me limpin'
You can't tell on these CD's but bro I'm knee deep in it
I'm wading in my weakness He made me dependent
I be lyin' through my teeth to say I don't resent it
Even as I write these lines I'm close to tears
Body ain't be workin' right for 7 years
So miss me with that keep your chin up try to smile
Bro I'm 26 I should feel better by a mile
Keep all your anecdotes and cute quotes
I’ll pass on cliches for true hope, it’s too dope

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
I feel thorns where my crown was
I be weak but I'm alive
From the dusk until dawn (yeah)
I'll survive because I got sweet victory
Nobody can take it from me sweet victory
'Cause I got sweet victory, yeah

[Bridge: Trip Lee & Dimitri McDowell]
Toast to the King
Cheers to the ceiling
Feeling good we gon' make it to the finish (sweet victory)
You hear me
Holla if you feel me
Yeah we still runnin' even though we limpin' (sweet victory)
'Cause we winnin', yeah we know we winnin'
Even though we're winded we're still in it (sweet victory)
'Cause we winnin', yeah we know we winnin'
Now we livin' (sweet victory)

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
They see me on the stage
They like that boy the man
They hit play on them songs
They clappin' in them stands
They like "I bet you got a lot of them stacks in rubber bands."
So when I say "It's been a few hard years" they think I'm playin'
But you don't know my life boy
You don't know my life boy
You don't know what it's been like on my wife
Don't know my fight boy
Being in the trenches steady tryna' fight my foes
And when I couldn't fight no more it brought me low, low
It brought me low I know can't bear that load

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
I feel thorns where my crown was
I be weak but I'm alive
From the dusk until dawn (yeah)
I'll survive because I got sweet victory
Nobody can take it from me sweet victory
'Cause I got sweet victory, yeah

[Bridge: Trip Lee & Dimitri McDowell]
Toast to the King
Cheers to the ceiling
Feeling good we gon' make it to the finish (sweet victory)
You hear me
Holla if you feel me
Yeah we still runnin' even though we limpin' (sweet victory)
'Cause we winnin', yeah we know we winnin'
Even though we're winded we're still in it (sweet victory)
'Cause we winnin', yeah we know we winnin'
Now we livin' (sweet victory)

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
They like I hear you talkin' wins but I see your losses
You celebratin' crowns but I see your crosses
That's the paradox that don't fit in your merit box
You might not understand if you walk in this pair of socks
The victor ain't the one that's winnin' seventh inning
Trophies don't go to ones that got a good beginning
When I say I win I don't mean the state I'm in
I mean that day when the gray skies fade out then
I'm winning 'cause I reign with Him

[Outro: Leah Smith]
The crown of thorns
Declares you're King
A scarlet robe can't cloak Your majesty
They nailed Your hands
You nailed our death
From the cross You reigned
Your Kingdom knows no end
Oh, Jesus
You won it all
Oh, Jesus
Victorious
Oh, Jesus
You won it all
Oh, Jesus
Victorious
Oh, Jesus
