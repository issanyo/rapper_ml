When I rewind, replay
All the things that made me who I am today
The good and the bad, the good and the bad
When I rewind, when I rewind
When I rewind, when I rewind

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I grew up in that 'Cuse
315, shawty that's my roots
Northside, ridin' 'round with my crew
Northside, ridin' 'round with my crew!
Before I had the red Lancer with the beat in it
Had the mosh bike, I hit the streets with it
Ride anywhere, I go deep with it
Had pegs for shawty when we visit
That's the backseat
Man, I feel like last week my first rhyme at a rap beat
It was Wu-Tang! Victory!
Rappin' been my passion since my best friend got that Cool Edit
Layed vocals on that computer mic
With a eMachine, became a fool with it
Took two hundred from Christmas
Made myself a wishlist
Build a studio, that's my mission
I ain't quittin' 'til it's finished
Studio time too much to buy
So instead, I D-I-Y-ed it
All them clothes came out my closet
Cause my mic had to go inside
If there's a way then you know I find it
Passion drove me to go all night, and I lost sleep
But I know I'll find it when I'm six deep, and it go all silent
I don't know where I'm going but I'm driven
I got fuel for the journey, let me start at the beginning, boy

All the things that made me who I am today
The good and the bad, the good and the bad
When I rewind, when I rewind
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
When I rewind, when I rewind
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
I moved down to Manhattan after High School for this rappin'
I had plans to make it happen with my passion and this talent
So I went to CCNY
I got rejected on the first try for the program that I aim for
Could have gave up but I said, "Gimme some more"
I was so far from home, and everything that I’ve known
But I got grown in that time alone, and my faith became my own
I was headin' out to Queens to see my favorite rapper, Ambassador
I gave him a CD, hope he call me after
He took my bible and he autographed it
Wrote, "Represent Him well", all inside it
Now I write the same thing when I’m signin', that’s rewindin'
Even though he never called me back
Four years later I was on his track
I got no time from DJ Official
Now look at the tours I played with you
That’s insane, just a few years, everything changed
Now I’m on planes
Goin' out playin' for kids that were just like me
In the cut like me
Tryna make everybody hear they stuff, like me
Probly hearin' people tell 'em shut up, like me
But this ain’t about me
Look what God did, without Him what I be?

All the things that made me who I am today
The good and the bad, the good and the bad
When I rewind, when I rewind
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
When I rewind, when I rewind
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 3: Kam Parker]
People think we’re different
We’re all the same
I got a little drama in my life, you got a little drama in yours
What you do with it, it’s your choice
Cause I’m looking at my past through the rear view mirror
Thanking God I made it through
I said I’m looking at my past in the rear view mirror
Look at that, look at that
