[Hook: Trip Lee]
Hands in the air
Make a little noise in the stands if you there
Brag on the God man if you dare
Only if you dare, that'd be shweet
What if when you brag, it wasn't about the clothes with the tags
That'd be shweet
What if when you brag, it's about Him who's the first and the last
That'd be shweet

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Heard 'em talking like it's hot man
Somebody got 'em gassed up on that octane
Look I hate to tell 'em they ain't better
Better get an umbrella, God reign
Let's go back in time the late 80's
D-Town homie down that's they made me
When I'm backed up I ain't vacay
Feels like I'm home
Thinkin' 'bout staying (I ain't stayin' though)
Already already
Lone Star State bred how can I forget it
But I ain't clappin' 'bout the blue
It's fly how You knit me, I ain't talkin' bout the shoes (shoe)
I got a lot of problems but I'm straight (that's shweet)
I know my God will toss 'em in the lake (that's shweet)
How many times I gotta tell ya He the boss
Under Him anything a piece of cake

[Hook: Trip Lee]
Hands in the air
Make a little noise in the stands if you there
Brag on the God man if you dare
Only if you dare, that'd be shweet
What if when you brag, it wasn't about the clothes with the tags
That'd be shweet
What if when you brag, it's about Him who's the first and the last
That'd be shweet

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Heard 'em talking like they hot man
Somebody got 'em gassed up on that octane
Look I hate to tell 'em they ain't better
Better get an umbrella God reign
I've been in the A a lot this year
Perfecting these songs that I spit here
And ever since 2010, it's been clear
Everybody talking 'bout how you gotta live here (I think they got me now)
Already already
Lone Star State bred how can I forget it
Middle School we was bumping Swishahouse
Had a freestyle sounding like them Swishahouse flows
Saying, man hold up, everybody came down, trunk popped, grippin grain making them stay down
Already, wasn’t talking bout nothin but a pipe dream
Like ‘man, my wrist froze like ice cream
But He opened up my eyes bruh (shweet)
All my people was surprised bruh (shweet)
Cause I used to rap 'bout cash that I never had then I came alive bruh

[Hook: Trip Lee]
Hands in the air

Only if you dare, that'd be shweet
What if when you brag, it wasn't about the clothes with the tags
That'd be shweet
What if when you brag, it's about Him who's the first and the last
That'd be shweet


[Bridge: Trip Lee & Gawvi]
Heard 'em talking like they hot man
Somebody got 'em gassed up on that octane
Look I hate to tell 'em they ain't better
Better get an umbrella God reign, huh
Say they make it hot (make it hot)
But they really only try (only try)
My God is the cap'n, He can really make it happen
He been reigning in the sky (explode)
They say they make it rain (oh what they do)
They really only throwin' cash
But my Lord's running in His own lane
Makes rain fall and the thunder crack
We think we tell time
But we only reading off the clock
My God existed before time and He told it when to start, mouth drop
Say we got it under control
But this really a mirage
My God He can keep the world running while directing all the planets and the stars

[Outro: Trip Lee & Gawvi]
Everybody going back (that's shweet)
Everybody going back (that's shweet)
Everybody going back (that's shweet)
Everybody going back (that's shweet)
That's shweet
Not sweet but shweet
With a 's - h' bro
Yessir
I was built to brag
