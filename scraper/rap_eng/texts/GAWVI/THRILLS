Yeah man, we at the top partner
Yeah man, we talkin' 'bout, we talkin' 'bout the colossal way
Yeah, huh?

[Verse 1]
Hold up, yeah, this ain't right
Where'd they go?
I've been waiting far too long
Timmy said just let it drop
Yeah, buy some drank
Yeah, I don't play
Hold up, yeah, this about to fall
Yeah, bring it back
Take it all
I just made the play, watch me run
I ain't new to this, it's my job
This ain't 'bout that paper
I can't stand your flavor
I just switched the game up
I see cages, I won't slave up

Talkin' 'bout the King Tut way
Talkin' 'bout the real big way man

Hard to top it
This ain't right
You can't stop it
Yeah, the night
It sounded real yeah, yeah
It sounded real
It sounded real yeah, yeah
It sounded real
Do it for the thrills, yeah
Do it for the thrills, yeah
Do it for the thrills, yeah
This ain't fun at all when they see it
Do it for the thrills, yeah
Do it for the thrills, yeah
Do it for the thrills, yeah
This ain't fun at all when they see it
