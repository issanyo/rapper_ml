[Verse]
I need Your energy
I need Your frequency
To take away all the pain
You make a better me
I need You to stay, I just want You to stay
I've been running so far when I need You, oh
Yeah, it’s always so hard when I don't see You, oh
Nothing's the same, swerving in lanes
Only with You is where I feel safe
We dive out in faith, it’s what we all chase, oh

[Chorus]
I feel it now, imperium
I need You now, imperium
You are enough, imperium
You are my love, imperium

[Refrain]
I need Your energy
I need Your frequency
To take away all the pain
You make a better me
I need You to stay, I just want You to stay

[Chorus]
I feel it now, imperium
I need You now, imperium
You are enough, imperium
You are my love, imperium, imperium

[Bridge]
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
All around
It's the moment
We can own it
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
I feel it now, imperium
I need You now, imperium
You are enough, imperium
You are my love, imperium, imperium
I feel it now (I feel it right now)
Imperium (I need you right now)
I need You now (Take me to that place, yeah)
Imperium (I need you right now)
You are enough (I feel it right now)
Imperium (I need you right now)
You are my love (Take me to that place, yeah)
Your Holiness (I feel it now)
I feel it now, ooh, ooh, ooh
