[Intro]
Trip: Money, sex, and power are good
Woman: What? You want me to listen to who?
I don't know. I used to like Trip Lee when he first came out
But I be feeling like he be acting like money is a sin or something
I don't know. What's he talking about now?

[Verse 1]
Let me get this off my chest
I know some folks are gonna be mad
Ain't trying to start no mess
But I know how folks are gonna react
Felt like I got to strive and press
Tell them what I mean until they see that
They think I got a problem with dollars and making green cash
But money really ain't the problem
Every grand is a grant from the Father
When I said, "We can't serve both God and cash,"
Many folks thought I meant, "Don't bother."
But I ain't saying making money ain't right
I'm just saying that your money ain't Christ
So please don't bow down to those greenbacks and let them stacks rule your life
Ain't trying to say we shouldn't get paid
Ain't trying to say that we should stay broke
But money don't mean you got favor
And being broke don't mean that you don't
Money is a gift that's good
Give it to the Father, to the Giver
I've been misunderstood
But I trust in the God who delivers

[Hook]
Please don't miss the problem man
It is not the God who reigns
It is not the gifts he gave
This is what I gotta say, say (What you got to say?)
Don't exalt them over the God of grace
You can't really enjoy them until your heart's in place
The gifts and the Giver are good (Hatred)
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good (He done lost his mind.)
Your heart is where the problem's at
Let's get that understood

[Verse 2]
I got something on my mind, bro
Some folks might not like that
I feel like it's about that time to
Hit them with the truth where the light's at
But still some folks want to fight that
His hand that feeds, want to bite that
Cause they think pleasing is making demons
A vow that he made with us despite that
He grants good gifts like sex
I ain't trying to start no mess
And I don't want to get graphic with all the facts
Cause he gave it so that we could be blessed
Please don't, act like I'm gone
Please don't, just say I'm wrong
Just take a couple looks in the Word
You'll see, this he condones
Sex ain't the problem
It's sinners who just forgot Him
Distorting, corrupt, like Sodom
The gifts, they want them without Him
It's beautiful in it's proper place. (Marriage)
Until we pop it up and turn our footsteps from His face
And then we problem

[Hook]
Please don't miss the problem man
It is not the God who reigns
It is not the gifts he gave
This is what I gotta say, say
Don't exalt them over the God of grace
You can't really enjoy them until your heart's in place
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
Your heart is where the problem's at
Let's get that understood

[Verse 3]
(You got to explain.)
Last verse, still gotta be real
Submit my thoughts under His will
Even if it ain't really what I feel
Got to let him take that, take that wheel
Last thing to talk about
Before end of discussion
I heard power corrupts
No, it just shows our corruption
But power's really a blessing
To men in the resurrection
And wield it to help this mess
Of a world in which we're resting, man
Our heart's the issue so submit it to the good Lord
He will replace it
What do you think we call him good for?

[Hook]
Please don't miss the problem man
It is not the God who reigns
It is not the gifts he gave
This is what I gotta say, say
Don't exalt them over the God of grace
You can't really enjoy them until your heart's in place
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
Your heart is where the problem's at
Let's get that understood

[Outro]
Okay, okay
I think I got it now
It ain't that money, power, or sex that's the problem
Its that something is wrong with my little, my own little heart
I don't know, we'll see
I still think that man's tripping
