[Verse 1]
Break my heart tonight
Tell me what you feel
I wanna know the deepest parts of your heart
I wanna know you more
I wanna know you more
Take me to that place
Surround me by your grace
Wake me up inside and lead my soul
I wanna know you more
I wanna know you more

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know is that, that I'm desperate for you
All you
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know is that, that I'm desperate for you

[Chorus]
Show me your love
Show me your love
Won't you roam my heart tonight?
I know your palms of your open arms
Show me your love
Show me your love
Show me your love
(All I know is that I'm, is that I'm desperate for you)
Show me your love
(All I know is that I'm, is that I'm desperate for you)
Show me your love
(Is that I'm desperate for you)
Show me your love
(Is that I'm desperate for you)
Show me your love
(All I know is that I'm, is that I'm desperate for you)

[Verse 2]
Draw me to your love
And pierce it in my soul
I wanna know the deepest parts of your heart
I wanna know you more
I wanna know you more
Guide me by your word
And open up my eyes
Wake me up inside and lead my soul
I wanna know you more
I wanna know you more

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know is that, that I'm desperate for you
All you
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know is that, that I'm desperate for you

[Chorus]
Show me your love
Show me your love
Won't you roam my heart tonight?
I know your palms of your open arms
Show me your love
Show me your love
Show me your love
(All I know is that I'm, is that I'm desperate for you)
Show me your love
(All I know is that I'm, is that I'm desperate for you)
Show me your love
(Is that I'm desperate for you)
Show me your love
(Is that I'm desperate for you)
Show me your love
(All I know is that I'm, is that I'm desperate for you)
