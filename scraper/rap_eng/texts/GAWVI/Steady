[Verse 1]
I met you here, gave you my all
Heart wide open
Love so close, I'm never alone
You show me what's better

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I know, now I know you leavin' or never
Ever since the day I met you, met you
Ever since the day I met you

[Chorus]
You stayed
Steady, you stayed
You stayed
Steady, you stayed

[Verse 2]
A higher place then where I began
Life from nothing
You're so much more, you're love is worth it all
I'm seeing more clearly

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I know, now I know I'm leavin' or never
Ever since the day I met you, met you
Ever since the day I met you...

[Chorus]
You stayed
Steady, you stayed
You stayed
Steady, you stayed
You stayed
Steady, you stayed
You stayed
Steady, you stayed

[Bridge]
Oh, stay
Hallelujah
So lost
Hallelujah
Come, stay
Hallelujah
Oh, wait
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
You stayed
Steady, you stayed
You stayed
Steady, you stayed
You stayed
Steady, you stayed
You stayed
Steady, you stayed
