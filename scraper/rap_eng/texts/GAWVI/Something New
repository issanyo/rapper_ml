[Intro]
Hold up, hold up, lemme get another one (5x)

Yessir, oh yeah
I like this, G
Here we go, hey

[Verse]
Well you know I got them J's, rock 'em on my feet
Caught up in the craze, my closet ain't complete
You know I got them fives, and I just got the twelves
But you know them boys [?]
So another more clicks on the site 'till I'm feeling just right
Bro I gotta keep my sneaker game tight
If everybody got 'em homie, that ain't what I like
Now everybody wanna be like me instead of Mike
My addiction isn't women or the booze
Sneakerheads anonymous, Iâ€™m itching for some shoes
Put it on my card, I ain't got nothing to lose
Sometimes I wonder what He did [?] to prove
Cause I want something else
What I got, it won't do
I think it's got some kinda flow
Cause I'm addicted to the new

Yeah it got me like...
Hold up, hold up, lemme get another one  (x4)
