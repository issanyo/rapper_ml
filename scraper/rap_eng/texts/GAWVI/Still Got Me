[Verse 1]
Is it your touch giving me life, oh
It's such a rush
Time after time

[Pre-Chorus]
If the sun don't shine no more
You still got me
If the stars don't wanna glow
You still got me

[Chorus]
In all of my love, love
You still got me
All my love, love
You still got me
In all of my love, love
All my love, all my love
All of my love, love
All my love, all my love
All my love

[Verse 2]
All my heart
Baby you still got me
I keep your trust
I hold on tight to no one else but you

[Pre-Chorus]
If the sun don't shine no more
You still got me
If the stars don't wanna glow
You still got me

[Chorus]
In all of my love, love
You still got me
All my love, love
You still got me
In all of my love, love
All my love, all my love
All of my love, love
All my love, all my love
All my love

[Break]
Todo de mi

[Pre-Chorus]
If the sun don't shine no more
You still got me
If the stars don't wanna glow
You still got me

[Chorus]
In all of my love, love
You still got me
All my love, love
You still got me
In all of my love, love
All my love, all my love
All of my love, love
All my love, all my love
All my love
