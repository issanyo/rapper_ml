[Verse 1]
Tell me what's going on
Why is love by the wayside
I don't know ya I don’t know
We are one DNA
Different strands of the same thing
You and I ya you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do we hide ourselves
Inside our different shells?
Live someone else's truth
Sing someone else's tune
Why are we so obsessed
With trying to be perfect?
When will we understand?
When will we understand?

[Chorus]
We belong here, we belong together
We belong here, we belong together
We belong here, we belong together
Don't it feel like we belong?
Don't ever let go
Even when the darkness holds
When we shine like stars in the night
Don't it feel like we belong?
No we won't ever let go
Even when we've lost control
Reaching out, it's never been closer
Don't it feel like we belong

[Verse 2]
Tell me how can we live
Throwing stones, pointing fingers
I don't know ya I don't know
We hide our scars like a shame
When it’s what makes us the same
You and I, yeah, you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do we hide ourselves
Inside our different shells?
Live someone else's truth
Sing someone else's tune
Why are we so obsessed
With trying to be perfect?
When will we understand?
When will we understand?

[Chorus]
We belong here, we belong together
We belong here, we belong together
We belong here, we belong together
Don't it feel like we belong?
Don't ever let go
Even when the darkness holds
When we shine like stars in the night
Don't it feel like we belong?
No we won't ever let go
Even when we've lost control
Reaching out, it's never been closer
Don't it feel like we belong

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do we hide ourselves
Inside our different shells?
Live someone else's truth
Sing someone else's tune
Why are we so obsessed
With trying to be perfect?
When will we understand?
When will we understand?

[Bridge]
Tell me, are things gonna get better?
Maybe if we learn to love ourselves we'll see
In the shadows there is beauty
Just let the change begin

[Outro]
Don't ever let go
Even when the darkness holds
When we shine like stars in the night
Don't it feel like we belong?
No we won't ever let go
Even when we've lost control
Reaching out, it's never been closer
Don't it feel like we belong
