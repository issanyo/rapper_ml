[Chorus]
I get tired of this
I get tired of that (I get tired of that)
So much bullshit flying around
Man I ain't got time for that (ain't got time for that)

Who you fooling
Nah we just cooling
Come chill with a Kool Kid
I show you how to do it (I show you how to do it baby)

'Cause if it ain't about dollars, then it don't make sense
I ain't 'bout to trip
Nah I ain't 'bout to flip
Niggas on my line still wanna book trip
Swear I'm fine don't need your chips

Fuck, who you fooling?
Nah we just cooling
I show you how to it
Come chill with a Kool Kid (come chill with a Kool Kid baby)

[Verse 1]
I must admit I might be colder than your bitch
No disrespect but she be out with the shits
I'm just a youngin' out here trying to get rich
That's why you fuck with me, falling in love with me
Don't need to do all that you ain't even my type
I'm on a different level can't fuck up my vibe
I'm on a mission, swear I'm tryna get it right
Don't get too close to me
No feeling involved with me
Baby just roll up
Go ahead and smoke a little blunt
Let's just get faded baby
I know you waiting baby
I can't give you all of me
But I can give you what you need
Satisfaction guaranteed yeah

[Chorus]
I get tired of this
I get tired of that (I get tired of that)
So much bullshit flying around
Man I ain't got time for that (ain't got time for that)

Who you fooling
Nah we just cooling
Come chill with a Kool Kid
I show you how to do it (I show you how to do it baby)

'Cause if it ain't about dollars, then it don't make sense
I ain't 'bout to trip
Nah I ain't 'bout to flip
Niggas on my line still wanna book trip
Swear I'm fine don't need your chips

Fuck, who you fooling?
Nah we just cooling
I show you how to it
Come chill with a Kool Kid (come chill with a Kool Kid baby)

[Verse 2]
I don't want to feel anything
I don't want to be caught in this emotional game
You ain't even got the juice like that
You always want me baby, please fall back
I know I'm looking exotic
You think you're that motherfucker
But nah, we ain't even cool like that
I ain't your girlfriend so what we doing
Yeah we just chilling
Don't try to love me, that shit can get fatal
I'm doing me I don't do well with labels
And plain black and white man it's so interracial
It ain't got to work like somebody disabled it
Look, that girlfriend boyfriend shit ain't gon' work for me
You tryna climb me like some property
Man, tryna kick you like a soccer team
You just tryna hit it like a lottery
Tryna find my heart is like hide and seek
And one of these days you might find the key
In the friendzone you better find a sear
'Cause everybody else always the tea
So boy no
You ain't got the juice like that
Nah you ain't got the juice like that
I'ma hit you with that run around
You gon' end up in the loop like that
Yeah I'ma put you in the loop like that

[Chorus]
I get tired of this
I get tired of that (I get tired of that)
So much bullshit flying around
Man I ain't got time for that (ain't got time for that)

Who you fooling
Nah we just cooling
Come chill with a Kool Kid
I show you how to do it (just let me show you baby)

'Cause if it ain't about dollars, then it don't make sense
I ain't 'bout to trip
Nah I ain't 'bout to flip
Niggas on my line still wanna book trip
Swear I'm fine don't need your chips

Fuck, who you fooling?
Nah we just cooling
I show you how to it
Come chill with a Kool Kid (come chill with a Kool Kid baby)

[Outro]
Come chill with a Kool Kid baby
Come chill with a Kool Kid baby
Come chill with a Kool Kid baby
Come chill with a Kool Kid baby
