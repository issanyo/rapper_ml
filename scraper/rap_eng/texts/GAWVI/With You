[Intro]
Oh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Runnin' on the sideline, right now
This feel like a lifetime, I doubt
Losing all my patience, somehow
Feelin' the vibrations of you now
Tell me, are you sad, are you sad?
When no one's left to wipe your tears off
I know you feel alone, but I'm right there with you
You, you, you
With you, you, yeah
I'm always there with you, you, you
With you, you, yeah
I'm always here with you

[Verse 1]
Hey, fairytales die down, ooh
I can't even tell north and south, yeah
Try to find a lighthouse, ooh
Losin' sight of why I started
I hear you outside, outside
Sorry I couldn't say goodbye
I can't seem to justify
Why you had to die?
I got funerals
Hard to find a soul
Someone else who knows
Livin' on this road
Pull up for the quick fix
I know it won't fix it
Got me feelin' low
Pullin' for the top like

[Chorus]
Runnin' on the sideline, right now
This feel like a lifetime, I doubt
Losing all my patience, somehow
Feelin' the vibrations of you now
Tell me, are you sad, are you sad?
When no one's left to wipe your tears off
I know you feel alone, but I'm right there with you
You, you, you
With you, you, yeah
I'm always there with you, you, you
With you, you, yeah
I'm always here with you

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm afraid of love, ooh
Happy homes flipped to divorce
Yeah, lonely holidays child, ooh
All I see is tears when it rains down
I can't even lie to satisfy
Drivin' around the city, satellite
Married 'til I die, 'til I die
Baby, hit the road, side by side
Got me coastin', steady focus
Guns N' Roses, for you posers, uh
On my mama, see, I won't fall off
Yeah, God, you catch me when I fall down

[Chorus]
Runnin' on the sideline, right now
This feel like a lifetime, I doubt
Losing all my patience, somehow
Feelin' the vibrations of you now
Tell me, are you sad, are you sad?
When no one's left to wipe your tears off
I know you feel alone, but I'm right there with you
You, you, you
With you, you, yeah
I'm always there with you, you, you
With you, you, yeah
I'm always here with you
