[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Jumpin', jump out of sight
Feeling nauseous, down for the ride
This is nonsense, you got me hype
Yeah, yeah, you got me hype
Jumpin', jump out of sight
Feeling nauseous, down for the ride
This is nonsense, you got me hype
Yeah, yeah, you got me hype
Yeah, you got me hype
Yeah, yeah, you got me hype
Yeah, you got me hyped
Yeah, yeah, you got me hype

[Interlude]
Ayy, woadie
I thought I told you man, it's our time, it's our season
We ain't really playin' out here no more
And don't you be sayin' God's name in vain

[Verse]
Yeah, hey, hey
Call me up for the night (Woo, woo)
Where we go, I don't mind, hey (No)
It's alright, now's the time, yeah (Time)
Kill the dark, bring the light (Du, du, du, du)
Yeah, yeah, call me up for the night, oh-whoa
All the bugs, yeah they bite, uh-huh
There's too many up in here, uh-huh
I got angels you should fear, you should fear
Yeah, angels on me
Everybody countin' on me
Had to get back on my feet
Back on that beat
They want me RIP
Won't even let me breathe
Ride with Daze
This for the MIA
This for the place I stay
TSA already know my name
'Cause I'm too high up in my zone
Only do this for my own, yeah
Gianna and Camila, yeah
Wifey know I'm coming home
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Jumpin', jump out of sight
Feeling nauseous, down for the ride
This is nonsense, you got me hype
Yeah, yeah, you got me hype
Jumpin', jump out of sight
Feeling nauseous, down for the ride
This is nonsense, you got me hype
Yeah, yeah, you got me hype
Yeah, you got me hype
Yeah, yeah, you got me hype
Yeah, you got me hyped
Yeah, yeah, you got me hype
