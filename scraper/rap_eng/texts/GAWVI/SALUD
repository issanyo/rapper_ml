(Ahh, ahh, ahh-ahh)
Ahh, I know how it feel, uh
I hope you one day see it, uh
I know why they fake, they all afraid
Jump out the planes, ahh
Hold on and feel it, ahh
Go and spread your wings, yeah (Ahh)
I am not afraid, I can't contain
Glasses of champagne
Away, way
Ahh, ahh, yeah, yeah, ahh
Ahh, ahh, yeah, yeah, ahh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
