[Verse 1]
All the stars they fade away
Nothing left but endless space
All my senses heightening
Time is fixed on you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Something here is happening
I can feel it in my veins
Electric infinity
Nobody has ever made me feel this way
I'm so high I could levitate
Honestly it's so insane
How you make me

[Chorus]
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way you make me feel it
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way you make me feel it
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You make me feel it
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You make me feel it

[Verse 2]
This is weird 'cause it don't fade
And usually I'm over it
Finally found my saving grace
And I don't ever want to see you go away

[Pre-Chorus]
Something here is happening
I can feel it in my veins
Electric infinity
Nobody has ever made me feel this way
I'm so high I could levitate
Honestly it's so insane
How you make me

[Chorus]
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way you make me feel it
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way you make me feel it
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You make me feel it
(Oh, I like...)
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You make me feel it

[Bridge]
When the skies get dark at night
I can hardly see my way, way
I don't even need no daylight
You ignite a spark in me

[Chorus]
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way you make me feel it
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way
Oh, I like the way you make me feel it
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You make me feel it
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You make me feel it
