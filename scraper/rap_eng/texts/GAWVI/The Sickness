[Verse 1]
Laying down on the edge of my bed
Coming down with a sickness in my head
Always looking for a new validation
And I'm not the only one
Filling my body with some empty affection
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Every time playing a role
So that no one will ever see my soul
Don't let 'em come cause they can't hurt what they don't know
No, oh

[Chorus]
That's just how it is
I hate to admit it, that's just how it is
That's just how it is
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's just how it is
I hate to admit it, that's just how it is
That's just how it is
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Just say you'll never leave me lonely
And promise that you'll follow me for all of time
Paint a portrait so appealing
You'll never know I'm dying on the inside
I've become a master of disguises
Smiling through the darkest times
When did everything become so heartless?
Mmm, mmm
So what's it gonna take to cure this sickness?
Or is it gonna take my life?
Never really getting past the surface
Oh, why?

[Chorus]
That's just how it is
I hate to admit it, that's just how it is
That's just how it is
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's just how it is
I hate to admit it, that's just how it is
That's just how it is
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I've been at odds with myself
'Cause lately nobody's keeping it real
And what's good for my mental health
'Cause I've finally stopped the whole facade
I need you to save me from myself (save me, save me)
I need you to save me from myself
I need you to save me from myself

[Chorus]
That's just how it is
I hate to admit it, that's just how it is
That's just how it is
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's just how it is
I hate to admit it, that's just how it is
That's just how it is
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
