"Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain." I'm deeply grateful to God for bringing this project together. I worked hard on it, but none of that matters unless the Lord is at work. Throughout the album process I was always shocked at how well things were coming together! There's no way I could have orchestrated this thing. Thank you Lord

Thank you to my family. I love you guys so much. You sacrificed a lot for this album to happen. Thank you for letting me spend so much time on it. Jessica, thanks for always giving the best feedback. Your support means the world to me. Q and Selah, thanks for making a cameo!

Thank you to my church family. Thanks for your constant prayers and support. Thanks for letting me split my time between serving you and serving others around the world. Thanks to all my friends for your support and prayers as well

A huge thank you to GAWVI. Bro, this is OUR album. Thank you for working so hard on it, and thank you for making me better. Even if this album only sells 5 copies, we built this together and no one can take that away. The process itself was a gift from God, and I think the end product is what we envisioned. I consider you family, and can't thank you enough for your grind

Thanks to Biz for making every song better, and Carlton for making me sound great. Thanks to Dmitiri, Natalie, and Elhae for your HUGE contributions to this album. Thanks to Lecrae, Andy, Leah, and Thi'sl for the features. Thanks to everyone else who helped out in various ways

Thanks to Reach Records for being the best label around. Thanks to Bradley, Alex, Katie, Kyle and the whole team for all your hard work. Thanks to 40 Deep for being the best management team around. I work with the best team in the world. Let's keep grinding for the King
