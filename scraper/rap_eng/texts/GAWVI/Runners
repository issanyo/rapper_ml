[Intro]
Hey, fellas. Where are the treadmills?
Oh, they right there in the back
Ooooweee! She bad! Oh, that's why I love this gym - that's why I love this gym!
Woo!  Man forget the bench press - today it is a cardio day for your boy! My goodness, she bad!
Holla at yo boy!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I can't lie, I admire beauty  like the next man
I still remember when I used to get my check cashed
Get my hair cut,  I hit the streets with my head gassed
Lookin' out for little mommas with a fat faaasssss
That's what my auntie used to tell me
Girl in my rear view  tryna tell me
Cause she knew wasn't nothing you could tell me
Always on a trail of another female
Well, well they say my papa was a player
So my dishonesty is honest in me baby
Somehow in college greek letters made me cuter
All the time on line I still couldn't compute it
Uh, I pledge girls then it's on to the next girl
My next girl eventually be my ex girl
But its' funny how it all unfolds
I done finally found a woman I ain't never letting go, whoa

[Hook]
Ooh she looking bad (Don't do it)
I wonder if she got a man (Don't do it)
I don't see no wedding band (Don't do it)
I promise you don't wanna go through it (Take it from me)
You don't want no problems (You don't want no problems)
You don't want no problems (You don't want no problems)
You don't want no problems G

[Verse 2]
It ain't nothing like a good woman
If you got you one of those, be good to 'em
Keep it one hundred, love everybody want it
But the lies and the lust keep lying next to us, but
I got past, and now I'm known to pass it
Up from my passion and I ain't here blastin'
Born a sinner just like any man standing
Couldn't keep the standard so God sent a stand-in
If you creepin' when you feel desire creep in
I know another way to win that don't involve cheating
Don't involve another heart broken into pieces
When a girl call you tell you she saw you on Peach Tree
Meet pretty underscore nice features
Had a couple drinks and had yourself a little piece and
Now you feel like the man in the streets pull 'em to the crib
I see your pants in the street, man

[Hook]
Ooh she looking bad (Don't do it)
I wonder if she got a man (Don't do it)
I don't see no wedding band (Don't do it)
I promise you don't wanna go through it (Take it from me)
You don't want no problems (You don't want no problems)
You don't want no problems (You don't want no problems)
You don't want no problems G

[Interlude]
Uh, Lashonda...
Baby, why are all my clothes in the street? It is not were it supposed to me
Oh, you don't know why your pants is in the street?
Hah, yeah, Shiquita told me she seen you on Peach Street
Uh huh, all up in the girl's face - you gotta go!
You see, that's my cousin, that was my sister, like my friend
No, I don't wanna hear it
It's like a friend
Shut up!
Get your stuff and go! Bye!

[Hook]
Ooh she looking bad (Don't do it)

I don't see no wedding band (Don't do it)
I promise you don't wanna go through it (Take it from me)
You don't want no problems (You don't want no problems)
You don't want no problems (You don't want no problems)
You don't want no problems G
