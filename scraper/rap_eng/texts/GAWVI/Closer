[Intro: Julissa Leilani]
I've turned away from you
Too afraid to let my heart show
Like I'm running from my shadow
So I'm here broken
Your arms hold me
And now I see

[Verse 1: Robbie Lee]
No matter how fast I run
You're never far behind
And every time my will begins to break
You lift me up, you lift me up
Even in the midst of my mistakes
Still you love, love me

[Pre-Chrous: Robbie Lee]
Oh, oh, oh
The love I wanna find, the love I wanna find
Oh, oh, oh
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes

[Chorus: Robbie Lee]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I never felt a love like this before
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Draw me closer
To you, to you, to you
Draw me closer
To you, to you, to you

[Verse 2: Robbie Lee]
I'll never understand
Just how you could love me
I'm so undeserving
'Cause every time I think you've had enough
You forgive me, you never leave me
I don't know where I'd be without your love
'Cause it's everything, I need, I need

[Pre-Chrous: Robbie Lee]
Oh, oh, oh
The love I wanna find, the love I wanna find
Oh, oh, oh
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes

[Chorus: Robbie Lee]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I never felt a love like this before
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Draw me closer
To you, to you, to you
Draw me closer
To you, to you, to you
Draw me closer
To you, to you, to you
Draw me closer
To you, to you, to you

[Outro: Julissa Leilani]
I've turned away from you
Too afraid to let my heart show
Like I'm running from my shadow
So I'm here broken
Your arms hold me
And now I see
