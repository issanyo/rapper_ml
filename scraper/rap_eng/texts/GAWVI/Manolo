Got a cabin in manolo (nolo) manolo (nolo) manolo (nolo) manolo
Got a cabin in manolo

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Trying to tell them boys
I never leave da crib alone
Cuz I keep one in my car and I got two at home
They diff'rent kinds but they do the same thing
Double-edged double-barrel (bang bang) Yessuh
I’m out here facin' dragons, I ain’t out my mind (bang bang)
They comin' for my soul so it’s bout that time (bang bang)
Them lies they trying to kill me if you don't believe me
I don't care, I don't care
I can't take it easy
I’m flippin the page, I’m trigga happy a clip in the gauge
Clickin and hittin the stage, hit you with truth thats in every phrase
He cut me deep
I'm Divin' in, Divin' in
When I ride I got that fire fire
I'm alive again
That's right (when I ride I got to)
Come alive again, You know we got it
Come alive again, uh huh
Manolo mayne

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
I be a sheep I'm a dummy
Sometimes it ain't even funny
Them lies are sicker than poison while the truth that is sweeter than honey
And we know that He got us
He is with us can't block us; Ibaka
His word is my weapon
It's going Brrrr-aaat!
