He said his advance seem to lie
I said, "You better let your lawyer know"
His money long, and her skirt was short
Only did it for the double-tap, ooh

[Hook: Gawvi]
Look at you, yeah
Look at you, look at you, ooh
Ooh, Look at you, look at you
Look at you
Long nights, yeah, we seen 'em all
I said look at you, look at you
Look at you, look at you
Look at you, look at you

[Verse: Wordsplayed]
Got two wires on the four door, that's foreign
Look twice at the merchandise, that's Lauren
Pluck it out
I'm as bad as the next guy
Lord knows my right want it
Rest in peace to the Left Eye
Summers in Cali, fell in love with Chiquita
She got that glass by the cooler, with that big quesadilla
We was living la vida
Now she say, "So la Freda"
Gots to love the familia
Shouts to Lude if I see her
Sim simma, who the baddest?
Push to start the automatic
Watching addicts, duck the static
Love my city, hate it's habits
I think he told me play that Sammy Sosa, the other night
Told what its really about, Lord what a sight!
I was running with the red print
Then I seen them white girls with the black tint
Either way, neverland, what the man say
So I'm stepping in the booth, Clark Kinte
Had big eyes on big dollar
Like pop the trunk then pop the collar
Now I'm working off my off-bottoms
Short waist to this nickel-pocket

He said his advance seem to lie
I said, "You better let your lawyer know"
His money long, and his stay was short
Only did it for the double-tap, ooh

[Hook: Gawvi]
Look at you, yeah
Look at you, look at you, ooh
Ooh, look at you, look at you
Look at you
Long nights, yeah, we seen 'em all
I said look at you, look at you
Look at you, look at you
Look at you, look at you
