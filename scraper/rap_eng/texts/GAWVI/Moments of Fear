[Phone Call: GAWVI's mom]
Hi handsome, it’s mom
It's one of those evenings in which I'm reflecting on the power of love
I once read that human beings we’re always operating from a place of love or a place of fear
Operating through a place of fear can paralyze the nation let alone an individual
But when we operate from a place of love, fear has no power over us
Living inside of love, being love itself, we're able to generate experiences that are limitless, harmonious, competent, and empowering
Te amo
