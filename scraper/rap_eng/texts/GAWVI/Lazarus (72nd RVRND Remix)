Verse 1 (DJ DAX):
Sorry if you missed me, man I really had to go
Life is his to take, so sorry, I won't take it slow
Look at me, I'm sleeping, but I'm 'bout to leave this hole
Matthew 27:52, 72 rise, trumpet blow

...hop out of the grave like I'm turning swag
...run out of this cave with no turning back
...I was once a slave, but I'm buddies with the master
(Faster) killing every sin, go ahead and tell the pastor

...death has lost its sting
I heard you die if that happens, what a thing
The irony ironing, straighten it out it, serious
My pen needs a pad, you're mad, bloody good rhymes, period

Vengo del rey, like Lana, rising like the ma√±ana
Bringing the heat like saunas - chopping the beat, katana
I wanted a 81%'s, that's a bad b
But now I got eternal life, listen pharisee

Chorus:
Wake'em! Wake'em up now! (4x)
Hopped up out the grave, good morning!
I been sleeping for too long, I'm yawning
They bury me, black suit, black tie
I'm alive and I woke up looking fly, so from now on
// From now on you can call me Lazarus (3x)
From a dead man, walkin' - Lazarus //

Verse 2 (Trae Perry)

Chorus

Verse 3 (DJ DAX):
Break open the coffin, might be coughing but I'm breathing air
He'll take me to the air, and make us the church his heir
He sits upon his chair, and calls the saints to him
We're giving thanks to him, singing praise and worships hymns

...you want this strict like Columbia
Wasn't for the capital, so no spiritual insomnia
Yeah... crazy, you can't play me, call me Heath Ledger
Forget my old body, I knew I would be better

...Like Penn State... they lion when they
Say money's the master, so do whatever the cents say
...no comprende, a pair of pirate parrots pleaded
Please pace the plank, you punk, slash like Edward Kenway
