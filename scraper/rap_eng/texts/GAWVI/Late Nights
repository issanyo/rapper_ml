[Intro]
Late nights, late nights
In the midnight hour
Late nights, late nights
In the midnight hour

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be right here
And even though you feel so real
Got me up on late nights
But you always saying lies
This gon' be our last time
Cause you know, you know I want you dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh! I don't care what you gon' say!
Oh! I don't care what you gon' say!
In the late night
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the late night hours

[Chorus]
Oh! I don't care what you gon say!
Oh! I don't care what you gon say!
In the late night, late night
Late night, late night, late night
In the late night, in the late night

[Breakdown: GAWVI]

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be right here
And even though you feel so real
Got me up on late nights
But you always saying lies
This gon' be our last time
Cause you know, you know I want you dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh! I don't care what you gon' say!
Oh! I don't care what you gon' say!
In the late night hours
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the late night hours

[Hook]
Oh! I don't care what you gon say!
Oh! I don't care what you gon say!
In the late night, late night
Late night, late night, late night
In the late night, in the late night

[Breakdown: GAWVI]

[Outro]
In the late night, late night
Oh! I don't care what you gon' say!
Oh! I don't care what you gon' say!
In the late night, late night
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the late night hours
