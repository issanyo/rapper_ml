[Hook: KB]
Look up in the sky, ohh I made it
Think I'm gonna lie? Well I tell you I ain't gon' take it
I got hands on the nations, check my reputation
Yeah that scoreboard still 1-0 cause my tomb is vacant
That's why I'm... Undefeated
Turned up
Undefeated
Turn up

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Who do you think that you are?
When I tell y'all that I run things
Y'all better believe me
Spin the earth on my finger like round ball
I'm a globetrotter, its easy
No lie boy y'all got me messed up
Not Buddha, Muhammad and I dang sure ain’t no Yeezus (at all)
Y'all all like I ain't made where you standing
Y'all act like I ain't drown the whole planet
Act like my son ain't died on that cross
Or I ain't gave you my all look here I ain't taking no loss
I love you with all of my heart that's the reason I'm here with my hands open giving my grace
I know that you know that I'm here ignore me if you want but the next time you spit in my face
You better just

[Verse 2: KB]
Undisputed no mistakes or plan B
In the end you’ll all marvel like it's Stan Lee
Don't doubt me but know about me
It don't look like I'm in the lead
But your ignorance don't make you safe
Because the worst punch (is) the one you don't see
Till you don't see that I ain't done yet
Watch all the glory my Son gets
The whole world's been set up
But you backwards, you upset
I was the one that put man on this planet
But I'm manning the planets
And planet by planet I'm planning out history
Spoiler alert I get the victory over your habitat
Matter fact matters a matter act to my exact
If you like it then you should put a ring on it, I told Saturn that

[Hook: KB]
Look up in the sky, ohh I made it
Think I'm gonna lie when I tell you I ain't gon take it
I got hands on the nations, check my reputation
Yeah that scoreboard still 1-0 cause my tomb is vacant
That's why I'm... Undefeated
Turned up
Undefeated
Turn up
Undefeated

[Outro: KB, Derek Minor & Gawvi]
(Never lost no)
No death (never lost no)
No natural disaster (Never lost boy no never ever lost boy)
No new philosophy
Nothing in the past (My people never lose boy never ever lose boy)
No demon
No disease (Never ever lose boy because I never lose boy never ever lose boy)
Always and forever I'm undefeated
Handle it, can you handle it?
I managed the world's  mismanagements
Thousands of years of the worst things (the earth’s curse)
And it hurts me but I got purposes in the hurts of men
If you don’t know it now, you’ll know it then
There’s a greater good, don’t worry friend
Where my glory goes, it reverses it
Amen
Amen
