[Intro]
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no, no, no, no...

[Verse 1]
Ain't gotta boyfren, they so dumb
Marathon men, always on the run
I'ma down chick
Yeah, I'm so fly
Ya' girl to hard to date a soft guy

I need a thug who can do me up right and
Take me to the movies while avoidin' drive-bys and
Take me get my nails done, money fo' my problems
Ain't afraid to visit me in prison when I solve 'em

[Chorus]
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?

Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
They say I'm ghetto 'cause I get low
I'm the main event, you tha' pre-show
My girls say I'm picky, but I gotta be
My ex left a scar, a salt n' battery

Now, I upgrade to ghetto Beyonc√©
Bootylicious, throw dem kisses
All over by my way
All my single ladies letcha' hand do the ring sway
"I am every woman", rest in peace, baby, Whitney

[Chorus]
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?

Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)

[Verse 3]
Uh
Gotta get by, gotta get my nine
Too cool for da' dumb-dumb guys
I neva' gonna try, neva' gonna buy
Neva' even gonna ask why
I'm so hoodie baby
You hate me, that don't phase me
I'ma razor blade away from bein' crazy
And you could say my weave maybe on too tight
'Cuz some these bruddas' make a girl wanna pick a fight
And if I'm gon' fight, you know I'm gon' win
I'm the hood's champ for the hood I'm goin' in
Bring the chorus back

[Chorus]
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?

Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey... no, no, no, no boyfren?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
Honey, why you no, why you no have no boyfren?
