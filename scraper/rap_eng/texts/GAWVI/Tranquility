[Verse 1]
I went to see my pops just the other day
He's sitting in the county, prepping for his court date
I took a seat on that metal and conversate on the phone
Then he blasted a statement that nearly sent me home
He said "Son I don't think the music thing for you
You got a buzz but you ain't got the revenue"
See I don't do it for the money
I do it for my slime
See why he snorting lines, he finding hope up in my lines
And I do it for that girl who make a living on the stroll
I'm the Jesus that they see in the valley with Jordan 4's
With them long dreads and the tattoos
See he'll lose stripes but He that dude
When the block hot, He don't stop
He keeps serving that good news
And you worry rolling like a big shot
I'm in a warzone and you can hear the bodies drop
Yeah, that's when I left the booth
Your family won't understand, that's why He chose you

[Hook] (x2)
Living in the era where you gotta watch your back
Every time I see the news another body laying flat yeah
And we dying in America (dying in America)
So bring peace to the area

[Verse 2]
Sean Bell, Trayvon, Mike and Eric were killed
We can take this thing further and pass it to Emmett Till
I was in downtown Miami, it was looking like the '60's
Black, white and Hispanic's were protesting with hippies
Oh Lord
What a beautiful sight
They saying black lives matter was the song of the night
But I ain't pro-black nor pro-white, I'm pro-human
Shout out to them good cops
Keep doing what you been doing
See I believe in justice but I also preach forgiveness
Everybody falls short of the glory so what's the business
De-activate the violence and respond with understanding
Yeah they did this wrong but our anger can't outlast us
So put down the bricks
I see the pain in your eyes
You're looking tired of this cycle and you're tired of the lies
Well all cops ain't bad
And all blacks ain't hood
And all whites ain't racist
Spread the love like you should
Spread the love like you should

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro]
Living in the era where you gotta watch your back
Another body laying flat
And we dying in America
So bring peace to the area
Gotta watch your back
Another body laying flat
And we dying in America
So Lord bring peace to the area
