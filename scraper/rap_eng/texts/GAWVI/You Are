[Intro]
Who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are

[Verse 1]
Laying here all alone seeing through my reflections
What I long just to see, I can find it here in me
Laying here all alone seeing through my reflections
All you see is the love that you chose to cover me

[Refrain]
Who you are fills all of me
Stubborn love, see you chasing after me

[Chorus 1]
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet

[Verse 2]
Standing here by your side looking at your reflections
I thought I knew but now I know your relentless love for me
I've run away for far too long from who you are
I should've seen but couldn't see that your steps were right with me

[Refrain]
Who you are fills all of me
Stubborn love, see you chasing after me

[Chorus 2]
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
It's who you are, who you are
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
It's who you are, who you are
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet

[Interlude]
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Now I know who you are, who you are
All along your reflection was in me
Now I know who you are, who you are
Now I'm living how this love was meant to be

[Chorus 2]
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
It's who you are, who you are
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
It's who you are, who you are
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet

[Outro]
Who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
Who you are, who you are
Good love knocks me
Knocks me off my feet
