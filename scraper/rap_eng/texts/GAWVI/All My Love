[Intro: Natalie Lauren]
I see you watching
Do you like what you see?
Am I seeing love?
Well, sort of, kind of may be what did you have in mind?
Your face looks familiar, I see you all the time
I can give you company tonight
You ain't gotta tell nobody
Ain't nobody else around watching
You just say the word
You got it, right here, right now

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Jay was lonely, and he's lookin' for love on the net
A man has needs, what' you expect?
He looked through all the pages
When he found her, then he lost his breath, cause it was love at first sight when they met
His heart beating Hard
She was kinda light skin, eyes like he liked them
Can't fight them feelings when they hit you this hard
It's long distance so he's with her online all the time
He's at work but this girl is on his mind all the time, he can't wait to see her
She got them banging features, when they together he don't mind
He gotta pay with Visa
His homies warned him, slow down, that woman can't complete you
But he's in the game of love
He don't wanna stay in them bleachers
Or so he thinks, thinks but I forgot to say Jay is married and his heart supposed to be locked away
I pray he'd break it off but he's weaker within and he'd be lost if he can’t see her again, he's all in

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
Baby come here cause I got what you need and
You want it, you want it
Come see me again, cause I've been waiting for you since morning
And I promise all my love is sitting here waiting for you just come get it, get it
All my love is sitting here waiting for you to just come get it

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
And he ain't never seen a face like hers plus her waist right
Can't fight the urge he always met her at the same site
His boys told him tell his wife cause this ain't right
And he was too afraid, she finally caught him and they fight
Words exchanged she's like, "What's this charge?
Have you been cheating?
Have you been seeing some other broad?"
He's trapped now and so he backs down
He’s feeling like he should spill all the facts now and so he tells about his different lover
And his obsession and hows he's always eyeing pictures of her
Its an addiction its wicked, he wants to fix it but tha
Feeling is in him, he's really drifting, he starts to wonder
Is this worth it cause his wife said he's gotta choose
She's like its her or me, your family you're about to lose
Now Jay got the blue, he wants to scream cause he loves that pretty woman on the screen
She like

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
Baby come here cause I got what you need and
You want it, you want it
Come see me again, cause I've been waiting for you since morning
And I promise all my love is sitting here waiting for you just come get it, get it
All my love is sitting here waiting for you to just come get it

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
My Dude Jay is at a crossroad, he felt he had joy and happiness but lost all
Feels like a lost soul, running down a wrong road
"How did I get here?"
He's at his all time low
And now he's crying out, crying out
Devastated, like "How'd she even find me out?"
Then he remembered that God
He simply can't stomach our wicked sin and
He disciplines the breakers of it
Now it hits in the depths of the heart, he calls
The way he grieve as Lord who hung on that dirty Cross
The way he hurt his wife with his flirts and perverted flaws
He might mess around and lose his family so he pause
He takes his laptop, her pictures on the backdrop
He smashes it with a hammer and takes the trash out
He calls his wife and he's repenting in tears
And says he wants to be committed for years and God hears!
