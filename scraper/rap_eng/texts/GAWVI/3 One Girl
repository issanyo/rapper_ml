[Hook]
Yea I love it, I love it
When you tell 'em you with me girl
Ain't nobody, nobody
Killing it like we kill it girl

[Verse 1]
My diamond girl
I got some things to show ya
Yea, you can have my heart
Here, I wrap it for ya
I want to take your dreams
Make them my everything
And we won't ever have them issues baby, magazines
You're from a different planet
And I'm so glad you landed
All of my atmosphere is clear, I don't know how to manage
You got me floating on top of the world
I got a feeling I love
I, I, I love you babe

[Pre-Hook]
Everything I could ever dream of
You got it like the perfect three one girl
I can't picture my whole life without you
Baby, you got it like the perfect three one girl

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
My diamond girl
I've seen too many lovers
Dying from heart break
Playing games with each other
But baby, I think
You got my everything
We're like a movie, I'm just skipping to my favourite scene
If I could get you anything
I would get you everything
The funny thing is you deserve the very finer things
You got me floating on top of the world
I got a feeling I love
I, I, I love you babe

[Verse 3]
We the perfect team and that's so great
Cause you're so Wade and I'm James
And you so [?] and I'm so [?]
You're so fly and I'm so-so
But they don't know we so in love
They don't just try to break us up
And I know that we won't give up
Cause you [?] when I sold you [?]

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook] (x2)

[Bridge]
Here we go, here we go
To the floor, to the floor
[?]
Tonight
Here we go, here we go
To the floor, to the floor
[?]
Tonight, tonight
Get it baby
Get it baby
Because you're the one to [?] and kill it baby
Get it baby
Get it baby
Tonight
Tonight
