[Verse 1]
I never want to break your heart
'Cause you are everything I've dreamed
I know it always seems I'm gone
But I would rather be with you

[Chorus]
Into your arms is where I fall
Giana Selah, Giana Selah
Into your arms is where I fall
I've been waiting for you, I've been waiting for you

[Verse 2]
Hold me tight and please don't move
I want to study all of you
Your eyes and smile take me places
Oh, I just want to be with you

[Chorus]
Into your arms is where I fall
Giana Selah, Giana Selah
Into your arms is where I fall
I've been waiting for you, I've been waiting for you

[Bridge]
Forever I'll be near you
Forever in your heart
We'll never fall apart
I'll keep you close to me
Forever I'll be near you
Forever in your heart
We'll never fall apart
I'll keep you close to me

[Interlude]
And don't you ever worry 'bout a thing
I, I'm never far
And though I promise you the best of me
I love you, baby

[Chorus]
Into your arms is where I fall
Giana Selah, Giana Selah
Into your arms is where I fall
I've been waiting for you, I've been waiting for you

[Bridge]
Forever I'll be near you
Forever in your heart
We'll never fall apart
I'll keep you close to me
Forever I'll be near you
Forever in your heart
We'll never fall apart
I'll keep you close to me

[Chorus]
Into your arms is where I fall
Giana Selah, Giana Selah
Into your arms is where I fall
I've been waiting for you, I've been waiting for you

[Outro]
Forever I'll be near you
Forever in your heart
We'll never fall apart
I'll keep you close to me
