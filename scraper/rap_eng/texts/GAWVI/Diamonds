[Intro: Gawvi]
GAWVI, get 'em

[Verse 1: Janine Weigel]
I may not wake up feeling flawless
And my emotions can be reckless
Yeah
And I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
Yeah I know I ain't perfect
But I glow, yeah I glow, yeah I glow
You say that I'm worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
Your'e the only one who saw beyond my skin deep
And into my heart completely
You got me cut like a diamond

[Chorus]
All of the stars are aligning
My heart, it beats like a lion
'Cause every time you hold me
And tell me that you love me
You got me cut like a diamond

[Verse 2]
The difference in me is so drastic
From day to night it's automatic
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Who'd I be without ya
But I glow, yeah I glow, yeah I glow
It's not a question

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only one who saw beyond my skin deep
And into my heart completely
You got me cut like a diamond

[Chorus]
All of the stars are aligning
My heart, it beats like a lion
'Cause every time you hold me
And tell me that you love me
You got me cut like a diamond
You got me cut like a diamond
You got me cut like a diamond
'Cause every time you hold me
And tell me that you love me
You got me cut like a diamond

[Bridge]
You're only one who saw beyond my skin deep
And into my heart completely
You're only one who saw beyond my skin deep
And into my heart completely
You got me cut like a diamond

[Chorus]
All of the stars are aligning
My heart, it beats like a lion
'Cause every time you hold me
And tell me that you love me
You got me cut like a diamond
You got me cut like a diamond
You got me cut like a diamond
'Cause every time you hold me
And tell me that you love me
You got me cut like a diamond
