[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ouhh
Listen

[Pre-Chorus]
How you expect me not to eat
When I was starving you ain't feed me
Now I'm just fed up
Yeah this shit real I'm out here broke
And I been sleeping on the floor
When all you say is "keep your head up"

[Chorus]
I'm fed up
I'm fed up, I'm fed up
I'm fed up, I'm fed up
I'm fed up yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Said you don't know the pain I feel
This ain't no game nah, it's fo' real
Plenty of nights there was no lights
I had to watch my mama fight (yeah)
I took the hard way
I still ain't see better days
I'ma put in on the time
I'ma work I'ma grind
The struggle gon' fade away
That struggle gon' fade away
Yeah I'm always gon' be straight
Swear my family gon' be straight
I'm a motherfucking great
Just take one look into my eyes
You will see all the pain that's inside
But it ain't time to cry
Gotta wipe all these tears from my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
How you expect me not to eat
When I was starving you ain't feed me
Now I'm just fed up
Yeah this shit real I'm out here broke
And I been sleeping on the floor
When all you say is "keep your head up"

[Chorus]
I'm fed up
I'm fed up, I'm fed up
I'm fed up, I'm fed up
I'm fed up yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Swear folks so different since I've blown up on they timeline
They reaching out they seeking clout feeding me all lies
But I cut back the snakes yeah
Swear I see pass the hate yeah
This wasn't luck it was fate yeah
Up next first place yeah
I took the hard way yeah, yeah
But you can't take my heart away yeah
Where was you at when the shit it got rough?
Where was you at when the shit it got tough?
Where was you at? yeah (where was you at? yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
How you expect me not to eat
When I was starving you ain't feed me
Now I'm just fed up
Yeah this shit real I'm out here broke
And I been sleeping on the floor
When all you say is "keep your head up"

[Chorus]
