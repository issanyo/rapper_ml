Take a flight and get so high
None ah dem can waste our time
Stay focused, everyday pon' di grind
Mi nah name out, so mi nah fade out
Put down di war and pick up di peace
We nah want see 'em lil yute inna di streets
Mmm, but dem ah walk and dem ah do it

All I wanna be is me, oh ah ah
All I wanna be is free
All I wanna be is free, oh ah

Remember the days me never have it
Couldn't buy a shoes much less a jacket
Trap pon the road

And make everybody knew ah dat ah my - one
Breed wife and take care ah mi yutes them
