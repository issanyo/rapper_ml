Oh yeah, you know I feel it now, ah uh ah

Chillin' wit' the squad and we shinin’ like stars in the sky

Party jumpin', bouncin', get jiggy to the music on the spotlight
And we be movin’ electric style, fa la la la
Hey, hey, you know I can’t contain my smile (Oh yeah, you know you make me smile)
Oh yeah, I hold it for a while (Oh yeah, I hold it for a while)
Let's celebrate the life of Christ (Oh yeah, yeah)
Tryin’ to find a star up in the sky (Ooh)

I wonder where would I be, I be if You never found me when I needed You (Oh)
Hey, hey, you know I can't contain my smile (Oh yeah, you know you make me smile)
