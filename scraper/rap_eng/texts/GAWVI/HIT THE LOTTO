[Verse 1: GAWVI]
I just hit the lotto
When you look at me
Why wait for tomorrow
When we got right now?
Let's just own it, we been waiting long
There's this moment, nothing can go wrong
Free yourself now, this is who we are
Underdog, like let it heal your scars
Ooh, oh-ooh-oh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh-oh, ooh, ooh

[Breakdown: GAWVI]

[Verse 2: GAWVI]
I just hit the lotto
When you look at me
Why wait for tomorrow
When we got right now?
Let's just own it, we been waiting long
There's this moment, nothing can go wrong
Free yourself now, this is who we are
Underdog, let it heal your scars
Ooh, oh-ooh-oh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh-oh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: 1K Phew]
Baby, tell me what you on
And how you lookin' in the mornin'
Kept it solid like a homie
That's a bad tenderoni (she bad)
She ain't worried 'bout the fitted (no way)
'Cause she know's it's on the way (oh ya)
Takin' off if you ready
Just hold on to me, hold on
I just hit the lotto
It feels like it's meant to be
But they want the worst
And hate on you first
Even though it don't matter
When you halfway up that ladder

[Breakdown: GAWVI]

[Outro]
It's a 4 thing
