[Pre-hook: Butta P]
If you wanna go hard
You better get to know me
Don't be afraid of the dark
Get the strobe light going
Put your hands up high
Put your hands up high
No don't stop
If you wanna roll with me
Baby, party sleep repeat, baby

[Hook: Butta P & (K-Nuff)]
Party sleep repeat, baby
Party sleep repeat (ballin', we're so illy, illy, illy, illy)
Party sleep repeat, baby
Party sleep repeat (ballin', we're so illy, illy, illy, illy)

[Verse 1: GAWVI]
On the club scene
On that wolf gang
My clique so large they think we're shooting
Killer bang bang
All [?] I'm speaking llife come take a look
Never seen like this
Swagged out crew with the kids on deck
Social Club [?] add it up those misfits
Misfits all awkward but they taste this
Don't take a spill we ain't cockroach
[?], I'm suited up they cannot kill
But I cannot merc
It's a Monday I'm paid to work
I know you fantasize about the days when I dis Izzy
I'm like really I'm from [?] you got baby [?]
Half o' them ain't real
And half o' them I got 'em
And this ain't ballin'
They fallin'
Like Trip Lee, he called it
See the challenge, they don't have it I'm about it
Let's go

[Pre-hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Butta P]
Hey baby
Welcome to the good life
Let's [?] in an eye
Then tomorrow catch a flight
We rock the show, the crowd be hype
And now I'm cruising down the west side
The crew is looking fresh now
My man's so smooth like a dude in a [?] I might just have to kiss him
Drinks on me
'Course I see
To be fair I keep it clean
Ballin' with my peeps and now I'm shining watch me [?]
Cause when I say I'm ballin', ballin' cause I'm ballin' differently
Yeah, gotta let the lady flow
Chicks in the game, yeah we need some more
Got to represent, hold it down for the God who saved me, came and changed my flow
Yeah I walk a little different
Talk a little different
I'mma go hard cause I'm tryna make a difference
Can I get a witness
If you witness
Every weekend on a roll yeah I'm in this
Might be on the spot, how we glisten
If not just not, listen

[Pre-hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Juanlove]
Yeah the crew with the evening
Ya know it's killing them season
To be so relieving and soothing
We got the people believing
My circle's built for the movement
These squares are thirsty [?] like we own it like what LeBron did in Cleveland
Why out in L.A
Yeah L.A
We don't sell [?] but we pedal dope
We let 'em know, cause you never know
Miami to Marina Del Rey
My crew is illy like for really Philly, Achilles hilly
We are the [?] for that poison like salmonella
Like Kevin Hart they silly silly
We poppin' a wheelie
Got all our hands on the game and they still try to cop a feely
Got a billy club in the trunk, beat the game out of Milly
[?] is in the shop, so we ballin' out after Jilly

[Pre-Hook] & [Hook]

[Verse 4: K-Nuff]
Ayo, a party with Gawvi
So yeah it's me I'm a body
I'mma work and do some Pilates
You know the streets, I'm a bobby
So grab a seat crowd around me
It's time to preach and I'm all about it
I'm all in, all in
And I can go on in, on in
The Wifey I'm so charming
Yeah I know
I wish everybody could feel just the way I do, I do
I do feel like I just won the lotto
Man I'm lovin' my life
Friends and fam' make me feel like the [?] type
At the top of my game like Jordan killin' in '89 right
Yeah, yeah that's me
I live like I got nowhere to be
Even if I ain't got nowhere to sleep
I got a young rich mentality
Yeah cause even with half of Philly for me that ain't nothing really, as long as God is standing with me
I'm ballin' hard
