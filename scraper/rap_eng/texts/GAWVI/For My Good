[Intro: Trip Lee]
You ever felt like stuff just never goes your way?
Like everything's against you?
Well, God never promised He would keep me away from all those trials
If I want perfection I'm a have to wait till later
And I ain't trippin' cause He has promised
That He will work all things together for the good of those who love Him and are called accordin' to His purpose
Let's praise Him for that
Yeah

[Interlude: Trip Lee]
It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about Him
It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about Him
It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about Him
Yeah, yes sir, let's go

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
I know this life may bring, pain and a broken heart
I've shared my share of tears, plus I got lonesome scars
I've had my ups and downs, my rises and my falls
So sometimes people ask me, how I survive it all
I tell 'em 'bout my Lord, let's get it understood
My King controls it all and He does it for my good
My Savior bought me, then gave me new life, this in His name
Now that He got me, I know that He'll bring me through the pain

[Hook: Jai]
For my good, You did it all for my good
You'll never put so much on me
When I couldn't take it, I know I can make it
Cause everything's gon' be ok
Say it's all good, it's all good
It's all good, God You are are so so good
Say it's all good, it's all good
It's all good, cause You know it's for my good

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
He ain't gon' give me nothing, if it ain't good for me
Sometimes I ask for something, that seemin' good to me
But my God is wiser, it's clear He really loves me
Sometimes He tells me "No! ", if not it will be ugly
How I'm gon' question Him? Deny my rest in Him?
He'll give us all things, He gave His son who bled for sin
My Lord is more than good, it's clear that He delights to give
Good gifts to His sons and daughters, all those who in Christ are hid

[Hook: Jai]

[Bridge: Jai]
Through all your problems, give it to Him
You just remember that He's bigger than them
There is a purpose, there is a plan
You'll be much better than you've ever been

[Hook: Jai]
