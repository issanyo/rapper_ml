[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Slippin' with the smoke from the 04
Nice that I feel pretty down low
Fast with the pedal, don't gun slow
Running with no gasoline
Ticket my thought, they speeding
Out of this world, I'm beaming
Feeding this pain, I'm bleeding
Take the wheel, I'm dozing

[Verse 1]
Pull up, skrrt, drop top
I've been doing rock climbs
Hop on the 95
Oh, she's mighty fly
Slow down, slow down
Hey, running outside, lose focus
Gotta hit the brakes, we posers
Uh, uh
Whippin' South Florida
I've been South Florida

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Slippin' with the smoke from the 04
Nice that I feel pretty down low
Fast with the pedal, don't gun slow
Running with no gasoline
Ticket my thought, they speeding
Out of this world, I'm beaming
Feeding this pain, I'm bleeding
Take the wheel, I'm dozing

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Lord knows I'm drained
Woah, too much high stake, yeah, yeah
Might lose my brain today
I need Your saving grace
I need You, to take the pain away, yeah
Late at night I'm driving by the ocean
You know I might drown in my emotions

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Slippin' with the smoke from the 04
Nice that I feel pretty down low
Fast with the pedal, don't gun slow
Running with no gasoline
Ticket my thought, they speeding
Out of this world, I'm beaming
Feeding this pain, I'm bleeding
Take the wheel, I'm dozing
