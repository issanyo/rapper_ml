[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
When you see me I'm in uptown baby
What you know about me oh
Nothing really well let's change that
See I came back I took a break but now I break that
Formerly known yeah I made that
And them car-tunez every Saturday
Eat your breakfast (Tell 'em play that)
Yeah I got lines like bar codes
Yeah I got jokes like Bart Simpson on bar phones (Moe's Tavern)
How you acting dumb on your smartphone
Fishing of men so I stay looking
Casting nets like I'm straight Brooklyn
Oh your life so hard
Why don't you face your problems don't Facebook em'
Satan trying to make the straight crooked
With the porn sites but I ain't looking
I got bands that'll make her dance
That's a wedding ring for my wife, bling
I'mma say that twice, bling
Ladies if you ain't got one
Don't give him none true love is waiting
And you so worth that
I know you heard some bull crap
But if you headed down the wrong path
Go ahead and turn back
You're never too far to be made new
They said you damaged goods but it ain't true
I testify to that I ain't lying Jack
You could check with my whole crew whoop

[Hook]
Y-O-U owe me nothing, no, nothing
Y-O-U owe me nothing, no, nothing
I know you will, I know you will, I know you will, I know you will
I know you will, I know you will, I know you will, I know you will
I know you will, I know you will
Even when they say you won't
I know you will, I know you will, I know you will
Even when they say you can't
I know you will
No there's nothing you can't do
Nothing in this world too big for you
So when they say you can't
I know you will, I know you will
Even when they say you can't
I know you will

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Some say you can't, I say that you will
My sinning cost a grip but Jesus paid the bill
You don't believe in miracles, I show you why they real
Some rappers don't got skill but somehow they got a deal, weird
I'm riding around in this airport, flying around on my skateboard
And my glasses on like a straight dork
Oh, your money tall, but these days short
I love the haters so I pray for 'em
See them hearts we aim for 'em
So I tell the world and we stay touring
And we do it our way, we won't change for 'em
This ain't no fast food, you can't order us
They looking so confused, what's the formula?
We just really want more of God
Nah, we don't really want more of us
Cause He did it we giving Him thanks
Even when they ain't awarding us
And them strip clubs, money drugs
C'mon cous' you boring us
We heard it all before
And I'm still unimpressed with that sort of stuff
We were made for more though
With them award shows and you thank Christ
That lip service don't mean nothing if you ain't about that life

[Hook]
