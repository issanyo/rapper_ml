[Verse 1: MartyMar]
Yeah, should've never let us in
I jumped off stage
I need medicine
Cause I got so high, I think I hit a fan
Now, I hit a fan like a real person
Everybody know where the party at
Hit my phone if you need directions
Wack rappers can get to steppin'
I kicked 'em out of my house like Pam, BAM!
I don't know how we do this
Suburban youth with the turn up music
Party with us and they heard we lose it
Heard the music and they love the movement
What's the trick?
Don't know what we're doing
I love God, I get so into it
So into it, my head explodes
Combover with the hipster clothes
The boys are fighting and they hit my nose
And I tried to stop it, but I think they know us
Somebody screaming, everybody froze
The cops are coming
Everybody go! Everybody go!

[Hook]
Till the cops shut the party down
It's a pizza party, yo!
It's a pizza party, yo!
Till the cops shut the party down
It's a pizza party, yo!
It's a pizza party, yo!
Till the cops shut the party down

[Verse 2: F.E.R.N]
Yeah, they looked to the Social
Them boys who be constantly bringing that quality music
They booked us on flights
And they bring us to shows cause they know that we bringing that powerful movement
Them misfits ridiculous, they know how we do it
Turn up a whole generation with music
It's always a mosh pit at all of our concerts
And after that, IHOP, we're eating like mobsters (eating like mobsters)
This is that proper, that music that makes sense to cop at the after
Everyone else needs to stop, I'm sorry
Not sorry, but we rock the hardest
Independent, no co-sign my brother, we got this
Lord on my side so it's family: adopted
My dog on the block is still playing with choppers
That blakka that clear up your block up like voila!
I told 'em we party, no guns in the building
Even no weapon, we came here to kill it
Dig it, first pick cold ice frigid
Live it, what I tell all ya'll listening?
Live it, what I tell all ya'll listening?
