[Intro]
Nadie me puede parar

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
You can't stop me!
Ayy, Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
We just went gold like a week ago
They wanna know what the secret tho?
When you be up with the ego flow
See what I'm sayin', Vegeta flow
I know Diablo, he creepin' tho
Say adiós, I got Dios, thinking we stop, olvídalo
Aye, wait, they like "you even latino bro?"
Aye, wait, I keep 'em all on a need-to-know
Try to be slick, think I ain't notice
Then I hit them with the Migo flow (hey)
Never Land 2 on the way
I know I know that you needed more
Went to Malecon, got that takeout
I call that con-con, she said pagao
This right here just like everything we prayed 'bout
I need vacay by the lakehouse
It's too late to take that break now, can't stop

[Chorus: Andy Mineo & Marty]
They try to shut us down, and it ain't gon' slide
Only thing I fear is God and He on my side
That's the confidence of God, cause He got me
That's why I really feel like
You can't stop me!
That's all you got?
Come on with it
That's all you got?
You can't stop me!
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
That's all you got?
You can't stop me!

[Verse 2: Messiah El Artista]
(Messiah)
¿Qué lo que, qué lo que, qué lo que? (¿qué lo que?)
I get to the money like ándale
I pray to God, and I work hard
Few are hatin' me, cállate
Nadie puede pararme (no)
Ni mi fuego apagarme (no)
Ahora pide más fuerte
No es caerse, es levantarse (ah)
Qué irónico el destino
Cuando no hay efectivo
Te puede sacar los pies hasta tu mejor amigo
El dinero convierte a mitad 'e mi enemigo'
No necesito a nadie si yo tengo a Dios conmigo (skrt)

[Chorus: Andy Mineo & Marty]
They try to shut us down, and it ain't gon' slide
Only thing I fear is God and He on my side
That's the confidence of God, cause He got me
That's why I really feel like
You can't stop me!
That's all you got?
You can't stop me!
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
That's all you got?
You can't stop me!
