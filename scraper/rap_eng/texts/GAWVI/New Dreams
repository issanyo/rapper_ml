[Intro: Trip Lee]
I was told that living the good life meant getting everything I could but I've been shown a brand new picture of the good life and it's glorious

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Hey I was raised in that lone-star state
Where we go hard, can't do it small at all, cause big things are at  stake
My dreams as a buck was to make a large bank
Daddy told me the best, no one can tell me I can't
Be the best baller, or be the best rapper
Got a little older and went after the latter
Grind till' I shine trying to climb that ladder
Grab a couple girls cause your boy look dapper
At a young age, I saw I had it wrong
Full of drive, but moving in reverse all along
Dreams full of pride, heart full of stone
You know I had to redefine what I grind on
Success is dangerous, if you don't do it right
He gave us everything for pointing to Him right
So toast to the King, who gave me some new dreams
Everything for his name, that's how I do things

[Hook: JR]
Never knew how lost I was till' I found God
Then I couldn't hear His voice, it was drowned out
I was just chasing things, selfish dreams
Now I see what he has for me, it's the good life

[Verse 2: Sho Baraka]
Uh-Huh, I grew up with those dodgers and those angels
Where wings get mangled and they rock a broken halo
Success is an idol from Hollywood to Diego
No Hablo, if you don't speak with the pesos
And there favorite dollar sign is too much more green
More lust, more taste, more touch
I had an appetite that ate from the Devil's power
At every bite to see the rise, I'm kissing my life goodbye
If I find I have a need this world cannot meet
Then I know this life is a place where my hope should not be
I've been chasing those things that are real fake
This is not a real place, this is a dream state
Functional saviors ain't hip, they're a real waste
What's the palace going to offer that a manager can't
Pain, sorrow, and empty treasures
Spite the creator, and deem creation simply better
The world offers a lot of things but it's really lying
And to the Lord, the good life is really dying
I'm the Lord's possession so my heart's in the Heavens
True Religion in my jeans and stop guessing

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
Even the sun goes down, heroes die eventually
Great careers end in the industry
Empires implode, you may go down in history
But everything will go down eventually
Look, you could stack bread, but you can't stop death
And there won't be any comfort offered you in that bed
All get laid out, the games get played out
In a maze headed to the grave and there is no way out
You can't outlast life it fades out fast
Death is coming for us all, everything gon' pass
So look at it from that angle dag
My dreams gotta' be bigger and greater than that
How is it persecuted martyrs in Asia
Were living out there dreams, though they was walking in danger
Their dreams are what lifted up the heart of the Savior
And living in a way to show that's what they wait for
They wasn't stackin' up the cake, but was walking in favor
Living a good life because they want with the maker
My dreams are different, you know that I've been changed now
The good life is the life that's been laid down
