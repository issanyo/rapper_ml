[Intro: J.R. & Lecrae]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Woo! Uh, ha, yeah!
Aw yeah, T.R.U.T.H., come on J.R.!
I'm feelin' it, man

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah, hair, check!
Shoes, check!
A brand new fit lookin' cool, check!
I'm lookin' in the mirror like, "Ooh, yes!"
To cover for an insecure dude, check!
But she won't feel me and they won't like me
If I ain't in them Js or them brand new Nikes
Let's dig deeper inside my psyche
When it's all said and done, even I don't like me
He live in the gym and his hair stay faded
Late model car so they think he made it
He's Christian, he gave his life
But he still ain't satisfied in the Savior Christ
Still finds his identity in looks and cars
If he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard
If he looked in God, it may seem odd
But he'd be so satisfied, he can leave it all, yeah

[Hook: J.R. & Lecrae]
I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no
I'm not the job I work
You, you can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

[Verse 2: Da' T.R.U.T.H.]
Hey, how do I gain success?
Why do I say I'm blessed?
Huh?
Is it the car that I drive?
Or the place that I rest?
Or the way that I dress?
Now, now
Is the cause of my pride
The stage and the set?
Or my face in the press?
Now, now
It's the applause that dies
When the praise is less
If my face is depressed
Then, then
It's 'cause my value and worth's in the volume of the work I produce in the booth, in the booth
It's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the Truth is through, is through
Man, I won't feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more, ha
'Cause they don't like me, like they did in '04, '04, '04
So I swallow my pride empowered by God, I'm complete in Him
He's got peace, God's priest, I'm in
In His presence, weak is strength
Meet His kin
We His brethren
Read this list
Me forgiven
He's dismissed
Guilt and my sin and then I find my worth 'cause I'm Jesus' friend

[Hook: J.R. & Lecrae]
I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no
I'm not the job I work
You, you can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Got her hair done, toes, nails
Is that Her? Well, it's hard to tell
'Cause she's so caked up in all that make up
It's like she tryna make up for what she ain't, but
She's a saint, but so confused
'Cause she's been rejected by all these dudes
That tell her on a scale of ten, she's a two
But that ain't true
If she only knew
In Christ she is loved, she's secure and accepted
Never be rejected by God who's elected her
Her beauty is her godliness
And she ain't gotta flaunt it 'cause it's obvious
Identity is found in the God we trust
Any other identity will self destruct
Identity is found in the God we trust
Any other identity will self destruct
Nowâ€”

By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ
