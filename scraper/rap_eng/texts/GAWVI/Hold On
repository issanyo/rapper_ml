[Verse 1]
I know you're so close
If I could just surrender
And fall to my knees
In the dark, so alone
If I could just remember
All that I need is to feel you in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
May your glory fall around me
As your kingdom comes
I'll stay kneeling at your feet
As your glory falls around me
And your kingdom comes

[Chorus]
I'll hold on
I'll hold on

[Verse 2]
Your voice echoes
Takes me to places unknown
Wrapped in your arms, safe in your heart
I won't let go
Hold onto you forever
Follow your lead and trust completely

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
May your glory fall around me
As your kingdom comes
I'll stay kneeling at your feet
As your glory falls around me
And your kingdom comes

[Chorus]
I'll hold on
I'll hold on
Here I am once again
Reaching out for your hand
I'll hold on, oh-oh
I'll hold on, I'll hold on
As you calm the raging storm
I'll hold on, I'll hold on
Out in faith and far beyond
Here I am once again
Reaching out for your hand
I'll hold on, oh-oh

[Interlude]
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Jesus, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I'll hold on, I'll hold on
As you calm the raging storm
I'll hold on, I'll hold on
Out in faith and far beyond
Here I am once again
Reaching out for your hand
I'll hold on
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
May your glory fall around me
As your kingdom comes
I'll stay kneeling at your feet
As your glory falls around me
And your kingdom comes
