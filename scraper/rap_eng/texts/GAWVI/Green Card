[Chorus: GAWVI]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Papi had to jump the border, trampoline
Did it for the power of the green, card
Can you guess what I mean?
Let me feel blessed, a man can't read (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Andale cipote
Andale cipote
Andale cipote
Andale cipote

[Verse 1: WHATUPRG]
Yo, holy
Daddy had no choice so he had to make a plan, uh
Daddy was a boy, now that boy became a man, uh
Barely 16, living in a foreign land
Now his little boy out here living out his dreams in LA
Back to the A
How these 16s puttin' food up on the plate?
Boy, I knew I had to reach 'fore I even signed my name
Got me thinking 'bout the times when it wasn't all okay
We had to wait the longest
Momma done prayed the hardest
She had to slang tamales
So we could pay the apartment
God Almighty, what up GAWVI
'Bout to hit the tour with 'Crae
Daddy couldn't stick around and now I'm 'round the USA

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Hey, hey, hey
Papi had to jump the border, trampoline
Did it for the power of the green, card
Can you guess what I mean?
Let me feel blessed, a man can't read (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Andale cipote
Andale cipote
Andale cipote
Andale cipote

[Verse 2: GAWVI]
Tell me why you go all insane on us
I've been on the road, ain't a fan discuss
I've been feeling down but they say just trust
How you get around in America?
Southside know my name
They know what I'm sayin'
Papi seen the pain
But he got away
They was shooting them balas
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Daddy seen the kids die, yuh
I'm asking why, hey, hey
Oh Lord, ghosts in El Salvador, yeah
I had to fight through the war, yeah
They still gon' close the door, close the door

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Hey, hey, hey
So, Papi had to jump the border, trampoline
Did it for the power of the green, card
Can you guess what I mean?
Let me feel blessed, a man can't read (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Andale cipote
Andale cipote
Andale cipote
Andale cipote
