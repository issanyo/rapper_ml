[Intro: Gawvi]
Social Club is the best
They're easy goin'

[Intro: Marty]
Yeah
I'm just a screw-up, I got a gang of kids with me
Why they choose us, I've got nothing good in me
It's the music that lets the world connect with me
Feeling the world is ours and I'm only in my twenties

[Hook: Gawvi]
Today I'm gone
Who knows when I'll be home
Turn off the lights
And don't fear
We are the sons of thrones
Tonight we’ll glow (in the dark)
Tonight we’ll glow (in the dark)
In the dark
In the dark

[Verse 1: Marty]
Yeah, okay I'm rolling with a gang of misfits
We getting claustrophobic so we live life with no limits
Renegades with tattoos, they didn't know we Christian
My mind is saying [?], but I don't ever listen
Puerto Rican, half Sicilian
Saluting to the kids bullied in between classes
I know what it is to look for help and everybody just passes
And we the future, don't give up, my life is in His hands
And we be dialin' in for murder if it never goes as planned
And we the broken kids, overlooked by the culture
Plus we gonna make it regardless of what they told us
And we don't really fit in, but I know I'm not supposed to
And misfits in my blood until the day I die a goer

[Hook: Gawvi]
Today I'm gone
Who knows when I'll be home
Turn off the lights
And don't fear
We are the sons of thrones
Tonight we’ll glow (in the dark)
Tonight we’ll glow (in the dark)
In the dark
In the dark

[Verse 2: Fernie]
Fernie
Glow in the dark like a Yeezy soul
Shine in the night like Rhema Soul
Either way we need a blame for the kids getting involved
Jesus saves all day and that's all
The new T's gonna make a new statement
See me with my brother, MartyMar, we the replacement
To the others you've been faced with
Face it
Christ King but that's basic
Gawvi up in the spaceship
We [?] love when that bass hit
Face it
And you hatin' it's what we do
We gonna make it
My misfit gang gonna take it
Where y'all scared to take it
Social Club is that Wolf Pack
Our life for Him while we celebrate
Don't stand there waitin' because life is short
In a second it's gone but until that day
We gonna sing this song for the misfits ay
We gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off
Cause the meals can't stop and the baby say Daddy please
Gotta keep on right
One life on Earth other in paradise I pray y'all know what I'm talkin' about
Fern, I spit my life 'til the day I'm out
Fernie

[Hook: Gawvi]
Today I'm gone
Who knows when I'll be home
Turn off the lights
And don't fear
We are the sons of thrones
Tonight we’ll glow (in the dark)
Tonight we’ll glow (in the dark)
In the dark
In the dark

[Outro: Gawvi]
In the dark (x4)
Yeah
G-Styles on the beat
Gawvi that is
