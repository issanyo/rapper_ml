[Verse 1]
Hanging on for love for you, you
I can't get enough of you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Feel the love?
It's unconditional
Fill it up
Go and fill it up
Fill it up
Something spiritual

[Chorus]
You, you, you know there's something in the water
Something in the water, something in the water
You you you got that flame getting hotter
Flame getting hotter, flame getting hotter
Something in the water, something in the water
You, you, you know there's something in the water
Something in the water
There's something, something in the water
Something in the water, something in the water
Something in the water
Something, something

[Verse 2]
I'm diving in deep into you, you
Everything I need is you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Feel the love?
It's unconditional
Fill it up
Go and fill it up
Fill it up
Something spiritual

[Chorus]
You, you, you know there's something in the water
Something in the water, something in the water
You you you got that flame getting hotter
Flame getting hotter, flame getting hotter
Something in the water, something in the water
You you you know there's something in the water
Something in the water
There's something, something in the water
Something in the water, something in the water
Something in the water
Something, something

[Bridge]
Feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Feel the love?
It's unconditional
Fill it up
Go and fill it up
Fill it up
Something spiritual

[Chorus]
You, you, you know there's something in the water
Something in the water, something in the water
You you you got that flame getting hotter
Flame getting hotter, flame getting hotter
Something in the water, something in the water
You, you, you know there's something in the water
Something in the water
There's something, something in the water
Something in the water, something in the water
Something in the water
Something, something

[Outro]
Something in the water
Something in the water
