[Verse 1: Darrein Saffron]
Lately it's been the same thing
I end up thinking about all the things I've been through
It's so crazy
And I've been just rolling, looking for something
And it's getting to me
I just want to believe...

[Pre-Chorus: Darrein Saffron]
That there's something real
That there's something true
That there's something more than just what's in store
People search the world for what's comfortable
Give your son in mind
If it's wasting time

[Chorus: Darrein Saffron]
And sometimes I feel, and sometimes I feel
And sometimes I feel, and sometimes I feel sorry
But this can't be real
I don't have to feel sorry
I don't have to feel sorry

[Verse 2: Darrein Saffron]
Lately it's been the same thing
But I say I need no help
I just keep it to myself
My OG said love yourself
But eviction doesn't help
These addictions on my health
I'm just trying to tell myself that...

[Pre-Chorus: Darrein Saffron]
That there's something real
That there's something true
That there's something more than just what's in store
People search the world for what's comfortable
Give your son in mind
If it's wasting time

[Chorus: Darrein Saffron]
And sometimes I feel, and sometimes I feel
And sometimes I feel, and sometimes I feel sorry
But this can't be real
I don't have to feel sorry
I don't have to feel sorry

[Verse 3: John Givez]
I hate to say my life is on the line for this
Safe to say I'm going out my mind for this
Self-inflicted wounds of a hustler
I can't help but feel I gave my muscle up
Drinking out the bottle, ain't no message in this bottle
I'm just messy with my idols, I done failed a million times
Sold a million rhymes to a million different souls
Don't give me a million dollars, I ain't got no self-control
And I wonder will I ever make a change, I gotta know
Settle down with wife and kids, stop messing with these (woah!)
Make a honest living, give a tenth of that to God
Open up the heavens, let me beat up on my odds
Cause I don't need no pity up in my party
And I don't see no shame in being honest
And I can only be what I'ma be
And I can only see what I'ma see sometimes

[Chorus: Darrein Saffron]
And sometimes I feel, and sometimes I feel
And sometimes I feel, and sometimes I feel so good
But this can't be real
I don't have to feel sorry
I don't have to feel sorry
