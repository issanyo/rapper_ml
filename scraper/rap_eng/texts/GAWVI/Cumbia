[Intro: GAWVI & Wordsplayed]
Mi amor, quiero presentarte a mi amigo
Él es un poquito loco
Pero tú vas a ver que está heavy
Ay Dios, ahí va, ay sí
Put me over vato flow, you know?
Don Juan to San Juan non-stop, aye

[Hook: Wordsplayed]

[Verse 1: Wordsplayed]
Uh, I'm twenty minutes from the border
Bring your drummer like you're louder
Chatting with ones out in Florida (South)
Texas, California
Never seen black Chavo before (not at all)
WhatsApp when we talk on the phone
Aye, Selena woulda loved this
Ooh, I hit that cumbia pronto
My Dominicanos on Broadway
Mob of Mexicanos down at TJ
I might do Cuba for the vacay
Seen Jenny from the block on the 6 train
Aye, you laughin' at the, "Mi no habla"
Just wait until I hit the salsa
Fall back let me take my time
It's the "bidi" and the "bom bom"

[Hook: Wordsplayed]

Ooh, we 'bout to hit 'em with the (cumbia!)

[Verse 2: Wordsplayed]
One, two, three, four, fifth
May I proceed with
That one two though
Me and G  though man!
It's for the ones in Calexico (turn it up, hey!)
It's for the ones in Calexico (where they at?)
Each verse, I bring the tapatio (where the sauce?)
They just put fries in my burrito (double up!)
What's up? What's up?
Carne on the grill though
Burn up, burn up
Wanna build a wall buddy?
Turn up, turn up all for the republic, huh
Selena woulda loved this
