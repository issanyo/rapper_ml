[Verse 1]
Gawvi, get 'em
I know you scared to let things out this way
Open your heart don't fake
So, hold on, panorama, panorama
Oh, don't you feel the lie screaming out?
I know you want to say what you feel, yeah
So here we go (Here we go)
Panorama (Panorama)
Panorama
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Blast off, watch me, Blast off, watch me
Diamonds dripping down I can say I ain't fall
Blast off, watch me, Blast off, watch me
Pressure made me shine through the thunder and the rain
Blast off, watch me, Blast off, watch me
All my life I had to fight over timing
Blast off, watch me
I made it out
Blast off, watch me
But I had a way
(Get 'em)
