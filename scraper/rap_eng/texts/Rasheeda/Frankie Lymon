Rasheeda, yeah, okay

Okay, all I smell is lie
Walking through the crowd
They know how it is (Rasheeda)
'Cause they see the crown
Niggas on a stray, bought last call
He want a menage, so I hear
Break a piece of that bod', gon take the whole thang
He know I got that sauce
I know he got that brain
Long night with a good pipe
Always get it, take my right
I levitate (sound by), then let him go (green light)

I run it like a relay, flyer than a PJ
Awesome three dozen shit
You can call it Andre
These other brawls just passé
They fuck with me the long way
Can't do shit not now'days, if I sold my swag on eBay

Please pass that rosé, it's been a long day
'Bout to be a long night, and time to get my mind right
So, please pass that rosé, shit it's been a long day
'Bout to be a long night, and time to get my mind right

Ex-ex-ex-cuze me, pour that drink, pour that drink
Wassup man, you blow that Stang, blow that Stang
Leanin' on that Lymon, call it Frank, call it Frank
I'm gone nigga, think I need a shrink, need a shrink

Ex-ex-ex-cuze me, pour that drink, pour that drink
Wassup man, you blow that Stang, blow that Stang
Leanin' on that Lymon, call it Frank, call it Frank
I'm gone nigga, think I need a shrink, need a shrink

Okay, you on winner maybe two
Call that double deuce
Beans got 'em high, think you need a parachute
Bottles back to back (ballin')
Can't stand the strain (ballin')
Another hit on that [?], and the niggas might be (crawlin')
Man, it's just appallin' how these hoes act ballin'
Their shoot game just cray, back game insultin'
If I speak on it I back it, hot [?] on my jacket
Mini dress, no panties, that's why niggas love my flashes
Five inch pumps, stayin' [?] than the clumps
We ballin' at the trumps, so I let him slap my humps
Piece o' rock, no chaser, while I count this paper
Got on so many diamonds they call me Elizabeth Taylor

I don't give two fucks, I told you that befo'
Come right here with that bullshit, now show you to the door
Ya, I don't give two fucks, I told you that befo'
Come 'round here with that bullshit, now show you to the door

Ex-ex-ex-cuze me, pour that drink, pour that drink
Wassup man, you blow that Stang, blow that Stang
Leanin' on that Lymon, call it Frank, call it Frank
I'm gone nigga, think I need a shrink, need a shrink

Ex-ex-ex-cuze me, pour that drink, pour that drink
Wassup man, you blow that Stang, blow that Stang
Leanin' on that Lymon, call it Frank, call it Frank
I'm gone nigga, think I need a shrink, need a shrink
