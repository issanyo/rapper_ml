This shit was all I knew, you and me only, I did it all for you, still you were lonely
If we could have worked it out, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved and that person has it all
And your just stuck standing there...
I'm gon need you to say somethin baby
Say say somethin baby, say somethin baby
Say say somethin baby, say somethin baby
Say somethin baby, heyyy say somethin baby ohh

[Nivea:]
Wish I could pull you out the game, cause it's the thing that made you change
It ain't the money honey, lend me some money honey
Thought I was your heart before your black card
You told the world about me but you forgot about me
Is it somethin you forgot cause I'm makin it my adamas watch
And it's beatin like my heart goin tic toc, tic toc
Baby look what u done done got me singin this song

[Nivea: Hook]

[Rasheeda:]
Yo I been grindin so long tryna reach the top of mount I want it all
Rememberin the days window shoppin at the mall
Now I walk in the store blow the whistle and ball
This ain't the picture I painted this is not a Warhol
You was supposed to ride with me but you so far gone
Used to be my biggest fan when I was comin up
Then when I blew up u act like I ain't do enough (damn)
I know I'm not home every night I'm dream chasin shoes laced up extra tight
If anybody understood probably would be you, told me to sacrifice do what I got to do
I never thought this meant sacrificing you, did all this hard labor thinkin we'd enjoy the fruits
I could move on but you still gotta piece of me, when you gonna realize I did this for you and me
