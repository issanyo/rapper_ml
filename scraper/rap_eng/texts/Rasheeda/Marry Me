Boy you know you wanna put a ring on my finger
This loving so good I should never be single
He love the way I throw it like a pitcher on the mound
Put it on him make him wanna wipe a bitch down

[Verse 1]
I can ride it like a cowgirl
Up down up down such a bad girl
I handle biz in and out the bedroom
It ain't a position that I can't assume
She can't do it like me
After one night he's addicted OXY
Now he's stuck to me like flees
The best he ever had got him down on one knee (Cuz' I)

[Verse 2]
I stay up on my fitness
Put on my genie costume and grant your wishes
When I leave it cause love sickness
So he tie me down and eat it up like brisket
He knock this thang out the park like Arod
Slide into home plate then I applaud

He do all that freaky shit call him lil' Tiger Woods

[Verse 3]
My bunny hop got him giving up carats
Taking days off like Ferris
Ain't no other chick comparing
He want me to his self & he can't imagine sharing
Pull my hair slap my ass let's play ruff
Fun sex got the whip and the handcuffs
Imma' throw it at him like a fast ball
He got his glove on tight hitting every wall
