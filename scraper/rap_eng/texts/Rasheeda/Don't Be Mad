[Intro]
Yeah
You know you have to tell people to just calm down a lil' bit, you know
Tone it all the way, the F down
Here we go

[Hook]
We are not the same, I'm on some other shit
Can't do it like, can't do it like, can't get it like this
Don't be mad (don't be), don't be mad (don't be) , don't be mad (don't be, don't be, don't be)

[Verse 1]
I'm on my mogo, racks at my disposal
You ain't in my lane, ain't fuckin' with my mojo
How we do it over here, everythang jumbo
And nuttin else matters, man, we call that shit a no-go
I'm a star, I shine bright
On the bad days, still have a good night
Maybe that's why they bitches got a lot of spite
Can you ease up up my shit, you bucketload of parasites
Flip 'em off, the middle finger
Bust so big, poke they ass with my stinger
I gotta leave 'em in suspense, and let 'em linger
Might let 'em at to rub my feet, the ringleader
I'm such a diva, don't be mad (don't be mad)
Was that a dab? You're such a fuckin' crab
You need some swag, here you go, you can have it
My style so crazy, gotta wear a straight jacket

[Hook]
We are not the same, I'm on some other shit
Can't do it like, can't do it like, can't get it like this
Don't be mad (don't be), don't be mad (don't be), don't be mad (don't be, don't be, don't be)
Don't be a hater, throw me under the bus
You can see the BBC, don't really give a fuck
So don't be mad (don't be), don't be mad (don't be), don't be mad (don't be, don't be, don't be)

[Verse 2]
Okay, see we go hard
That's just how we do
The chicks in my crew got that stupid revenue
Tryna play "catch it", better get your running shoe
'Cause shawty we big shit, big rows of tissue
Yeah, hold on, Chanel bag swag
You ain't fuckin' with the kid, old glad trash bag
Gotta feed 'em with a long spoon, this why he's so fine-tuned
You faker than a cartoon, I'm hotter than the month of June
Now take that to the bank
You're just insecure that's why you always quick to hate
A real bitch focus on they K
Steppin' shit up, lift my feet, then I plank
They feel me comin' like a bad toothache
Make a bitch regroup, take a long spring break
Yeah, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Don't be mad (don't be mad)
Is you feelin' yo'self, system fake tits and ass

[Hook]
We are not the same, I'm on some other shit
Can't do it like, can't do it like, can't get it like this
Don't be mad (don't be), don't be mad (don't be) , don't be mad (don't be, don't be, don't be)
Don't be a hater, throw me under the bus
You can see the BBC, don't really give a fuck
So don't be mad (don't be), don't be mad (don't be) , don't be mad (don't be, don't be, don't be)

[Outro]
You know you have to tell people to just calm down a lil' bit, you know
Just, tone it all the way, the F down
