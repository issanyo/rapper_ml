(She can deal with the drama im through with you)

[Rasheeda:]
Sometime love feels so good
Sometime love feels so great
Sometime love turns to hate
That's when it's all gone and it's just too late
I thought you was different from them other dudes
I've tried so hard to hold on with you
Yep by a minute I played a fool
I even let you sleep by with a lie or two
See I was your chic I ride for you
If I can't get down to it I ride for you
It took a little time for me to shake you off
Cause night and days I should break you off
Boy pack yo bags, take your game
Go with them lies you ain't gon change
I thought what we had together was so strong
But there are pictures on my phone that prove me so wrong

[Rasheeda:]
Let a slide with the business trips
Got a name of a credit card slip
Man, why you're going out like this
I've never thought I'd have to deal with this
I look back and it all makes sense
Late night hanging out with ya boys
So now you're too drunk to drive home from the club
Why you didn't call me I would scooped you up
But you're sendin out all my calls and voice mails
Where your blackberry at â€“ you get my e-mails
Now you're gonna sit here lie in my face
Shoulda cheated on you and gave you a daze
But I didn't do that I thought real love was better than all that
You the reason women think me ain't shit
You'll never find another real chic like this
