Last time I threw yo shit out the back door (back door)
Everytime I let you back in (in)
Turn around and do the same shit again
When you gon' learn you got a 10
Playin wit those hens you gon' lose your best friend (best friend)

I won't play the fool another day (naw)
You had me though for a minute
And I ain't shamed to say I've been played I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
This opprotunity comes once in a lifetime
Can't believe you wanna blow it on a half a dyme

And the one who gave you the house and key (keys)
Don't make me break ya down to your knees
Any your credit wasn't shit NIGGA PLEASE
Dats what happens when you think you go it going on (on)
When I met ya lame ass you was so alone (so alone)
I knew you wasn't about nothin'
'Ol cheatin, 'ol schemin, 'OL LYIN LIL FUCKA
