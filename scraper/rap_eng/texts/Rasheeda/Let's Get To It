[Verse 1: Ee-De]
See, I've been watching you all night 'cause you so sexy
And I've been contemplating ways to get you next to me
See, It's not usually in my ways just to be so up front
And I got to let you know to do what I want
I'm going out my way to make you V.I.P
To give you a taste of "Southern hospitality"
Five minutes of your time and I guarantee
Instead of leaving by yourself, you'd be chilling with me

[Chorus]
I just wanna' please you, baby
You really got me feeling like I need you, baby
And all you gotta' do is take a walk this way
Put your hand in mine
And baby, let's get to it tonight
(Let's get to it, shawty)

[Verse 2: Ee-De]
So mami, if you want me to just say what
I scoop you up and we can start this 'cause yeah
Got you pumps up in the air
Hold it right there
Henny got me (going all night)
So imagine you and me
Floating on the seas
Skinny dipping in the former down keys
Now I told you we gon' set it off
Guarantee to get you off

[Chorus]
I just wanna' please you, baby
You really got me feeling like I need you, baby
And all you gotta' do is take a walk this way
Put your hand in mine
And baby, let's get to it tonight
(Let's get to it, shawty)

[Verse 3: Rasheeda]
Tipsy off "Bacardi"
Feeling kinda naughty
Let's hit that after-party
And get this thing started
You say you go to bed
Ain't nothing better than a drill to get a chick
Gettin' wild like a taliban
Dip it low, lean back, pop it like a rubber-band
Bottom line, shawty wanna sho' nuf' veteran
Understand he ain't choosing me, boy I'm choosin you
You think you pimping hard, but your ass ain't got a Blues Clues
So hit it, quit it, never last, but I might let you taste it
I'm also super nigga shit
The hell with the basses, face it
Rasheeda gon' get it
This how she gonna' get it
Play your cards, watching my hit
Just when you gonna' get it

[Chorus]
I just wanna' please you, baby
You really got me feeling like I need you, baby
And all you gotta' do is take a walk this way
Put your hand in mine
And baby, let's get to it tonight
(Let's get to it, shawty)

[Hook: Ee-De]
Hey, let's get to it
Let's get to it
Let's get to it, girl
[Rasheeda]
Hey, let's get to it
Let's get to it
Let's get to it, boy
[Ee-De]
Hey, let's get to it

Hey, let's get to it
