Wanna niggas at bitchs, some leave just boots at the threw some broads
Wanna breathe but some gots, nigga with a pen got at a reason sweats
Got a lot of niggas to know but the rides are slow with the pan to joke
Duck in the day, but the rides are fo's, when run to the run hurry time to providing store
Niggas know that stoppin sweat is it where the others store
People say we blunching but them cutchin niggas gotta dough
