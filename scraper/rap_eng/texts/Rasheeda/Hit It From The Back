Yeah
Rasheeda baby
Boss bitch music

Sick heels, bad bitch wheels
Sweet pink pussy, send the motherfucking bill
Somebody call the doctor, 'cause a bitch ill
Yeah, ill
We in the club, smokin' occasion
Boy you learn, nigga bow, we call that Keebler
Nine that hoe some wigga without procedures
Now that's a nine piece, yeah, Nino

I'm so hot fire comin' out my asshole
It's 2012, more money is the main goal
I'm a problem, everywhere I go
The sign on my ass reads "miss me if you broke"

I think I need a cape with my supergirl swag
You can see I'm 'bout my cash, gon' throw it in the bag
Long hair don't care, hangin' right above my ass
And I call him daddy when he hit it from the back
When he hit it from the back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back
When he hit it from the back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back

When he hit it from the back, like a bass drum
He say he hungry, I feed him yum-yum
He licked it out, 'til his tongue numb
Now, now that's what I call chewing bubble gum

Yo, time to set it off
Where the bottles?
Move these lame out the section, quick re-model
Is these hoes hatin' or just menopausal?
'Cause they do it small-er, we do it colossal
Parting my wings, but I'm super fly
You ain't fuckin' with the boss, re-modify
Bye bye bye, high boots and some daisy dukes
So many camera flashin' at me, it's a photo shoot

I think I need a cape with my supergirl swag
You can see I'm 'bout my cash, gon' throw it in the bag
Long hair don't care, hangin' right above my ass
And I call him daddy when he hit it from the back
When he hit it from the back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back
When he hit it from the back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back
When he hit it from the back... (back, back, back, back, back, back, back)
