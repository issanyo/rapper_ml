Hey, that's my baby
You know that's my baby, right?
Hey, that's my baby
You know that's my baby, right?

I hate to see him leave, but I know he will be back soon!
And he gonna put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon
(Put yo legs to the moon, shawty legs to the moon!)
And we gonna do it all night, 'til the sun light, it feel so right
When he put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon
(Put yo legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!)

He never gone long
And when he leaves he calls can't wait to get home!
You know that I'm ready, ready
And on that Patron, ain't got nothing on (ain't got, ain't got nothing on on!)
It's going down, I can't wait
I send him pics to his phone, so he fixate
He call to conversate, now it's getting dirty
How long before you get here
He said be there in a hurry
That swag off the chain, I talk myself, he can get this damn thing
The first time we did, uh, insane
But we got it popping, I ain't talking champagne
No other can replace
The way he do that thing when I put it in his face
He says I'm singing to his tune
When he spread my legs and put 'em up to the moon!

I hate to see him leave, but I know he will be back soon!
And he gonna put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon
(Put yo legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!)
And we gonna do it all night, 'til the sun light, it feel so right
When he put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon
(put yo legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!)

I'm on a drug addicted to love
Addicted to the way he put my legs up above
Now I'm seeing stars
On another planet his love taking me to Mars, Mars!
Work the middle, switch positions
I'm such a boss, but his love makes me so submissive
He takes his time so attentive
I do a new trick just a lil incentive
To keep him on my team, gotta him on some big shit
Holler, it was all a dream!
He know I'm down, I'm down like no other
The classy sexy freaky chick who always keep it gutta
You know, I'm motivated, his my my motivator
And his tounge's amazing, such a stimulator
I'm wetter than a lagoon, and ready
Baby come and put these legs to the moon!

I hate to see him leave, but I know he will be back soon!
And he gonna put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon
(Put yo legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!)
And we gonna do it all night, 'til the sun light, it feel so right
When he put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon
(Put to legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!)

I'm so flexible and he likes to see it
He likes to put my ankles around my neck
Every time he beats it! Bang, bang, bang
And he really turns me on
He drives me crazy
But he goes way too deep, so hard and I can't take it!
Bang, bang, bang
I love it, I love it, I love it I love it I love
How he takes control!
I love it, I love it, I love
Even when it's uncomfortable
So hold my legs up to the sky
Baby, take me for a ride to the moon!

I hate to see him leave, but I know he will be back soon!
And he gonna put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon
(Put to Legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!)
And we gonna do it all night, 'til the sun light, it feel so right
When he put my legs to the moon, legs to the moon
(Put to Legs to the moon, Shawty legs to the moon!)
