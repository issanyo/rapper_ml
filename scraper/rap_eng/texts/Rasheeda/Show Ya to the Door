[Hook]
I ain't nothin like ya ho
I ain't gon cuss ya out I'ma show ya to the door
I ain't nothin like ya ho
I ain't gon cuss ya out I'ma show ya to the door
Show ya to the door, show ya to the door
Show ya to the door, I'ma show ya to the door
I ain't nothin like ya ho
I ain't gon cuss ya out I'ma show ya to the door

[Verse 1]
I ain't pickin up da phone, I ain't answering no emails
You know why and you know the details
Walkin in my door lying in my face
That's why I'm through with ya and you 'bout to be replaced
I asked you about it you act like it was business
But you huggin her and kissin her, walking through Lenox
Yean try to hide it, yean care about my feelings
Game over now its my turn to deal it
No good ass give me all my keys
Don't forget to drop the watch and the chain before you leave (before you leave)
I ain't goin for it see that door now walk
I'll be damned if you leavin in the car that I bought (car that I bought)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't gon fuss, I ain't gon cuss
Imma take ya off my credit cards and burn yo clothes up
Every word out ya mouth be a lie, lie, lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye bye
Let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya
Our only memories gon be a Myspace picture
Cause you erase, your gone, you're dismissed
Understand I'm da wrong one to fuck with
Stop beggin boy it ain't a good look
This chapter here's done, I done closed that book (closed that book)
I hope you happy with dat ho
It won't be long before she show yo ass to the door (HA HA HA HA)

[Hook]

You's a lie, lie lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye, bye (bye bye)

You's a lie, lie, lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye, bye (bye, bye)

[Hook]

You's a lie, lie, lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye, bye (bye, bye)

You's a lie, lie, lie
Now all I gotta say to you is bye, bye, bye (bye, bye)
