Yo, yeah, yeah
Ha, now what y'all wanna do
Ha, yo, Teddy Bishop
Profyle
Like that, right?
You know how it is
When you wanna holla at these girls when you walkin' about
But they ain't never wanna holla at ya back in the day
Ya know?
But when they see you outside in your six
Then they wanna holla at you
Check it out

Girl when I first saw your face
I said to myself
She's like the kind of girl who only looks out for herself
And from the moment you walked up
I peeped your game
Your like the kind of girl who give it up
Because of my name

1 - If you be straight up
About what you want
Maybe we can hook something up
But I ain't gon front

2 - I won't be the one chasin'
No baby
I ain't gon be the on
To fall in love, I can't
I won't be the one slippin', no slippin'
Girl forget it
I won't be the one trickin, no spendin
I ain't the one

Girl when I first heard about you
I said to myself
She'll only hang around
As long as you keep cash on the shelf
She wants to live the glamorous life
But I don't need (a girl like) her in my life

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 (2x)

[Rasheeda]
What? Uh! Check it out
You always talkin' bout
What you gon do, you really don't know
You steady spendin' dough
Now this is how it go
I keep it on the low from your man's and them
Why you beggin' on your knees?
Rasheeda don't leave
You need to get your mind right, your life right
Boy you never knew a love like this aiight
Game tight like a virgin I got some to burn and
That chump change you spend
That's the least of my concern and...

Repeat 2 till end
