(Rasheeda:)
He like the way my pinkie sitting pretty
Underneath my mini I'm ready for a quickie
Give him a quick striptease drop it low
Let him squeeze what my Bs like some double Ds
Only got a few minutes
I can play with
Show him how us ghetto girlz like to get it get it
I ain't pimpin I see your body out of tension
So come and get it 'cause I'm working with a time limit

(Verse 1:)
Give it up give it up quick to me
I gotta run can we make this kinda quick you see
Give me your love like you always do it to me
(I need your love but we gotta rush)
Keep it low shine low not to loud
Do it all make it fast know I like it round
Make me scream like a witness on a murder scene
(Won't you come and break me of right here)

(Pre-Chorus:)
It can be outside on the hood of your truck
It can be how you want it just hurry up
Hit it up put it down till you get enough
Ooh ooh

(Chorus:)
I feenin' for your touch (touch)
I just can't get enough
Come get all of my love
Not tryin' to be nasty

I feenin' for your touch (oh oh)
I just can't get enough
Come get all of my love
Not tryin' to be nasty
I just want a quickie

(Verse 2:)
Makin' love all night sounds good to me
But I just need a little taste of my baby's free
And only you can bring it to me like you need to bring it to me
(I need your love will you take over me)
Make a girl wonder what the hell you put on me
When you pull up know its up I'm so ready
And I don't mind if you say that I'ma get it right
(Let me tell you what I need)

(Pre-Chorus:)
It can be outside on the hood of your truck
It can be how you want it just hurry up
Hit it up put it down till you get enough
Ooh ooh

I just can't get enough
Come get all of my love
Not tryin to be nasty

Come get all of my love (hey)
Not tryin to be nasty

(Verse 3:)
You know what I want and
I can't hide it all from you
Change the way you work it

(Feeling freaky you know what I need)
Got me bout to scream oh

(Rasheeda:)
He always touch me in the right spots
And do the damn things that keep me so hot
Love it when I get up on top
And ride him like 4-54 drop top
Don't matter the time or place
'cause I think I'm sitting in my car but I'm sitting on his face
And I do it all on my lunch break
Quickie a day keep a playa so straight

(Chorus:)
I feenin' for your touch (I'm feenin)
I just can't get enough
Come get all of my love (oh ooh)
Not tryin' to be nasty
I just want a quickie
I feenin' for your touch (for your touch)
I just can't get enough
Come get all of my love
Not tryin to be nasty
I just want a quickie

(Chorus:)
I feenin' for your touch (touch me)
I just can't get enough (baby baby)
Come get all of my love
Not tryin' to be nasty
I just want a quickie
I feenin' for your touch
I just can't get enough
Come get all of my love
Not tryin to be nasty
I just want a quickie
