[Verse 1]
Uh-oh second album out the stable
No worries about the paper, I ain't gettin' raped though
All about his payroll, BME is the label
Hoppin' out the fly shit, we ainâ€™t carin' what they do
[?] full of bitches, [?] glistens
She wanna Orlean hair little niggas
I'm in the lair in the air when she misses
It's the Trice gang, you know we about ta (bang)

[Hook]
OG up in this mafucka
Obie up in this mafucka
We got that heat up in this mafucka
Get up out your lane, just know it's about ta (bang)

[Verse 2]
Got the flame young boy, [?] fired up
Got them things young boy, [?]
I guess the feds ain't got you niggas wired up
Cooperation with them people got you tied up
Literally tied up, vodka in the cup
Me in the club nigga, turning shit up
I spent a few dollars, long as lil mama swallows
After that y'all know what follows (bang)
My niggas [?] against the law: D-boys
Who give a shit we have legitimate decoys
We in this bitch like a fetal position
Don't let the heat come from wishin' when your piece end up missin'
Know that she in submission, on her knees in the kitchen
Forgive me for sinnin' Lord, her man she be kissin'
Put the key in ignition, she believe in my engine
When she speak about leaving him I just turn up the system

[Hook]
OG up in this mafucka
Obie up in this mafucka
We got that heat up in this mafucka
Get up out your lane, just know it's about ta (bang)

[Verse 3]
We ain't worried 'bout money, we gettin' ours up
Trice party of 40, we tear them bars up
When local broads after hours involves us
Y'all can have 'em tomorrow dawg, we all love
The next city she wanna connect with me
Correction: she wanna put stress on her neck simply
Hit me on the text, meet right up at cha' exit
Guess your girls get naked (bang)
You stretch things when dawg puttin' his thing on it
Things keep comin' back, puttin' cream on it
It tastes good cause taste buds cling on it
The American dream: get money
See us comin', face just turned ugly
I don't let it bug me, you're still my lil buddy
Steal if niggas turn ill, [?]
Reveal you are here in [?]

[Hook]
OG up in this mafucka
Obie up in this mafucka
We got that heat up in this mafucka
Get up out your lane, just know it's about ta (bang)
