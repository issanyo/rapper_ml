Reckless

I'll admit I'm fucked up myself
Praying on my knees but it doesn't help
No amount of love could cover up the pain I felt
My worst enemies always been myself
Dark clouds round me people think I'm looking for trouble
If u seem what I've been through you’d understand why I refuse to be subtle
U and me homie aren’t the same man
My wholes goal fuck you & your game plan

Nobody knows how I feel inside
Middle finger out widow when I drive by - fuck you
Drinking in day living reckless living /hell yeah
Strolling through like I got a death wish yeah
Nobody knows troubles I’ve seen - ain't got a clue
Lord & devil fighting to intervene /man
You even know what being a sinner means - nah
I’m up early in morning serving dinner to fiends - ha ha

Born in the ghetto Raised in the ghetto Dabbled in then drugs played with the metal but ah
In and out doubts and tenting on a niggas couch
Tension mixed without So he tend to pay More attention to the negative route
Say he been there , done that Used to bust guns now I busy raps Look bad like retrospect
Know the D native night have needed that Today eating wouldn't believe there was crack up in his jeans
Now it's MTV down to smack DVDs
Where a Nigga come from aunt nothing bout image Obie trice Doug Crawford real name no gimmicks

Nobody knows how I feel inside
Middle finger out widow when I drive by - fuck you
Drinking in day living reckless living /hell yeah
Strolling through like I got a death wish yeah
Nobody knows troubles I’ve seen - ain't got a clue
Lord & devil fighting to intervene /man
You even know what being a sinner means - nah
I’m up early in morning serving dinner to fiends - ha ha

Same day different story if he did the murder 4 me
Will they still hold me in purgatory
Yes I've been sinful in past transgressions
I'm just a man how can u stand there & ask me Questions
Like a clue what I've been threw
Wasn't til rain clouds left that I could see the potential
I feel it's always much better when the rides suspenseful
Ur attempts to take me out r
Inconsequential
Its seems Victory loves triumph
& I make the kind of music that fucking starts riots
Stealing cats 4 lunch Westside Kelowna
Smooth talker with s jail house diploma
Look on whites of eyes coward will warn ya
What's la tat mean stands for California
I said fuck rm All @ started
Over new
Patiently waiting for my moment that's been long over due

Nobody knows how I feel inside
Middle finger out widow when I drive by - fuck you
Drinking in day living reckless living /hell yeah
Strolling through like I got a death wish yeah
Nobody knows troubles I’ve seen - ain't got a clue
Lord & devil fighting to intervene /man
You even know what being a sinner means - nah
I’m up early in morning serving dinner to fiends - ha ha
