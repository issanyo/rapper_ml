[Hook: Estelle]
I know the world wanna see me humble
They want to see me broken down
No matter how they try, they try
I'm staying up way high, way high
Way up in the sky
Cause that's my home

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
They say he wouldn't make it
But that ain't old make-up
Came from servin' fiends flavors
Until I got [?]
Belly all full, nigga ate up
Not just the cheddar I pulled but the haters
Wanna see the raw flesh in the grave, it's dangerous
And I ain't Singapore, I'm a singer bitch
Singular, nina on the hip
Sittin' in the hood home, dreamin' while I flip
I could be anything, include being rich
Take 'em out the ghetto, move 'em to the sticks
Put 'em in the [?], let 'em know
O represented to the fullest
Even if it's foolish or even if jewellery [?]
[?] boy came up from the sewage, bitch

[Hook: Estelle]
I know the world wanna see me humble
They want to see me broken down, but
No matter how they try, they try
I'm staying up way high, way high
Way up in the sky
Cause that's my home

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Cold nights
Trice on the corner, rollin' white
Police wanna put me
In a holding cell after reading rights
They don't know what I received in life
My reason for me to push inebriatin' vice to fiends, it's like
By any means make it easier right?
When we come from dangling from trees at night
Yeah, now it's Ibiza
Stamps on the visa because I'm an emcee
Something a beat does to Obie
I'm from the street [?], you should know me
The boy raised by the OG's, sippin' old E
Now he sold out shows overseas so effortlessly
Eleanor we did it so elegantly
Know you're smiling from heaven on me

[Hook: Estelle]
I know the world wanna see me humble
They want to see me broken down, but
No matter how they try, they try
I'm staying up way high, way high
Way up in the sky
Cause that's my home

[Bridge: Obie Trice]
I'm home but I was starving
I sold yayo now [?]
I used to sling narcotics
Narks used to see me as a target
Now I'm in Bucharest, Budapest
We the arch of the triumph
Obie Trice not retirin', right now I'm hirin'
Long as your mind's inspirin'

[Hook: Estelle]
I know the world wanna see me humble
They want to see me broken down, but
No matter how they try, they try
I'm staying up way high, way high
Way up in the sky
Cause that's my home
I know the world wanna see me humble
They want to see me broken down, but
No matter how they try, they try
I'm staying up way high, way high
Way up in the sky
Cause that's my home

[Outro: Obie Trice]
I'm up in the air baby. You niggas just do whatever you wanna do or say whatever you say about a nigga like me. I'm up in the sky. Yeah
