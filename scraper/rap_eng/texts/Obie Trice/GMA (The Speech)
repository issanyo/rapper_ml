[Intro]
You get more for your money
When you fuck with Mr. Porter

Yeah
Tweak my vocals just a lil bit
Yeah
Turn me up sound man just a lil bit

[Verse 1]
Good morning good evening, good evening good morning
When y'all was yawning, I was performing
When y'all was snoring, Obie was touring
Couple of [?] blowing my horn and
I just like forehead take em back home and
To the motherland, where nigga's belong in
All my belongings, my shit was stolen
Release my shit like a nigga parole it
Now he in the foreign hittin' them corners
Right on Ocean why he so boisterous
America made me this ain't even my culture
If fam weren't a slave nigga I'd be a [?]
Fuck Trice

[Chorus]
Good morning good evening
Good morning good evening
Who they believe in, who they decieving
Good morning good evening
Good evening good morning

[Verse 2]
As Kunta Kinte wasn't sensei roots
That's why modern cocaine is O's truth
Methamphetamine's make friends enemies
When we all tryna chase the same loot
Remember Bob had a noose
But as a kid rocks, pocket my triple fat goose
So who are you to point finger bout his demeanor
Even though you thinking his demons could be cleaner
Now we dream of Goodfellas not Mandela
We are the same colour his acts is so stellar
Drug peddler believin' in what they tellin' us
Hard young blacks on the map has no relevance
President's black that's evident
But crack bring precedence back dead presidents
Pocket's full of opposite what my melon gets
Elephant in the room y'all on some poaching shit

[Chorus]
Good morning good evening
Good morning good evening
Who they believe in, who they deceiving
Good morning good evening
Good evening good morning

[Verse 3]
Landed on this bitch with Columbus, true
With no compass understanding O's roots
Reincarnated like Cordoza I snoop
Inspired by the essence of understanding my truth
Understanding why I brandish a weapon at you
When he resemble I, and we are only few
Why, animosity builds in to a fuel
When the Ruger is spilled and kills another dude
They just watch the tube
Screw us [?] like something in they food how they view us humans
Morning and evening, evening and morning
We all over the news like we part owning
We far gone because we not knowing
We so far from home [?]
[?] boarding up home we was raised in
Well fuck it Imma chase paper then

[Chorus]
Good morning good evening
Good morning good evening
Who they believe in, who they deceiving
Good morning good evening
Good evening good morning
