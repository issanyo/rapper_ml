[Verse 1]
Rolling with my entourage (my entourage)
In my garage (my garage)
On our way to Mariott (Mariott)
Got this little [?] wanna give me massage (massage)
Ménage à trois with a boss like mwah (like me)
Riding like the mafia, leaving the opera (yeah)
He close like binoculars she need me on top of her
Or could it be I'm popular or either I'm opposite of these nigga's that be flocking her
Potting me bruh
Pockets full of profit I'm an oceanographer (swim)
Swimming in women Obie not eating Talopia (hold up)
Not even if she on her knees gobbler
Eating Obie's thermometer
Imma drawn the line, carpenter (that's me)
Monitor her, if she obviously honorary
Imma delete and copy the girl
Find another follower who hair longer than [?]
Who goes by the motto she's a swallower bruh (yessir)

[Verse 2]
Rolling with my rocket launch
For Antwon (Antwon)
Wanna take me out my mind (nigga)
He a lil scary, tryna catch me behind (oh shit)
Blind side, a fly guy like I (like me)
Riding like the mafia, put two in the top of ya
The executioner, I ain't talking the wrestler (ugh ugh)
Oh what a mess for ya, put you in the casket uh
You're wearing a catheter, like it's a new fashion ba
My killers ain't amateur I come for you and your family bruh (that's right)
It never matter when you insist to be challenger
The chopper go clap (clap clap)
Collateral damage you off the planet when we send you out of space
Gallagher
Dropping them tracks while nigga's dropping they soap
That's a life behind bars my nigga's losing they hope
Then they fronting on O, that's mean they need intervention
That's when the Desert Eagle send his soul on a mission, bruh
