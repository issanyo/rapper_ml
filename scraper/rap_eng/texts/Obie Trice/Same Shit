[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie back
Call'em all to my scrotum sack
She know a nigga be holdin' stacks
Rollin' in that Cadillac

Why her nigga be so upset?
I'm cold as shit

Ho ass niggas should know
Ho ain't celibate

Punk ass niggas irrelevant

She never squirted
New skeeter
Need me, cause you beat her
Now she overseas,new visa

[Hook: Obie Trice & Young Zeether]

[Verse 2: Young Zeether]
Spittin' off the loud
I'm going off that liquor
I'm down, I'm so ready girl to fuck ya
Look, I ain't got no rubbers
But she ain't got no problems
Bet I can hit that pussy man and make that ho swallow
Got my dick all in her mouth
While I'm sipping on that bottle
If a man gotta a problem,best believe I'll bust them hallows
She got a fat pussy,that long hair
And that cute face
Girl you the shit
You got a fat pussy,that long hair
And that cute face
Girl you the shit

[Hook: Obie Trice & Young Zeether]

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Baby
We nasty
If I took a look at what her status be
I  bought her paper gradually
Let her suck the dick of a majesty
Put her back on that taxi
Send her home and then after I enjoyed the sex
But I told her no life after
Its BME
We do big's business
Ride around in that hard body
We seize bitches
Lil Kims on their knees whiches yo snitches
You get squeezed niggas
