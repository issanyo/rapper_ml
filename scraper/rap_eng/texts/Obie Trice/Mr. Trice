Yea

Def entertainment bout to take over this shit

Once again, is yall mutha fuckers ready.. yea.. yea

[Verse One]
Mr. Trice, One in a Mil.. Fuck it I'm one in a bill..
Fuck it I'm one in a zill yo
This specimen is rare
A big lip nigga with an ice-cold stare
I cripple infinitely yall dare
Any nigga with steel balls to try to front over here
You get done over here
Leaving niggas touch more than a LD off a blunt over here
Cake niggas be the beat eating
And since I got a sweet tooth I digest weaklings
Mr. Trice been caged for a minute
I hit the stage for a minute mutha fuckers turn timid
It's the T-R-I-C-E can you feel that shit

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Mr. Trice Bodacious with flow
And barbaric in the way I let you niggas know
If blunt too much I still get frank
And if frank scantlis
Wait and see what bold think
We act off instinct nuttin more
Same goes for my dick with a dusty hor
I represent gore
Same reason all that red shits on the fuckin floor
Nigga what you hear for?
You don't want to see me when I'm angry
Too many of yall cats take Mr. Trice too plainly
A Plague disease infested
And I spread it all across your lyrical testaments.. Peasants

[Hook]
You peasant niggas ain't ready
Mutha fucker yall peasant mutha fuckers ain't ready
This was another Moss Production
We live at Napp Entertainment for the new Millennium
Blowin mutha fuckers out the water
Representing from the Mo Town

[Verse Three]
Mr. Trice on this rap shit I got it made
Its nuttin for me to find a spot in rap page
Disperse rep with body parts across stage
The big question is "Obie what's your age?"
Just cause I'm a young nigga
Don't mean you can't get hung nigga
Or stung by a gun trigger
I be amongst viscous figures
Who hear nuttin
Just foot steps when you runnin
Mr. Trice's stunning actious staff
They got out of line I had to axe their ass
Exlax their ass
Italy shitted on it selves when
Mr. Trice brought the fuckin wrath

[Hook]
Hey yo he just brought the mutha fuckin wrath
Napp Entertainment putting their foot up in nigga's ass
You niggas ain't ready for that hot shit
We be droppin for the millennium
