Don't come down things will always work out
Don't come down things will always work out
Don't come down things will always work out
So when you find yourself in pieces
As a child i was fowl
(uh) Ma, I couldn't understand them things that came out ya mouth
You would cuss, fuss till your blood pressure went up, then give up and slouch on the couch and drink ya ------
A hard headed ----- I was quick temper short attention span not attending class (no) what a dummy
I would run over you honey
You confront me and say Obie you no longer have a mommy
Don't use my phone don't even eat my food
Matter a fact, Don't speak and it was just me and you in that house with that mouse and them traps and they ---, waitin on the day when you gon pull the
----- back

[Chorus]
Don't come down things will always work out (I'm sorry)
Don't come down things will always work out (I messed up)
Don't come down things will always work out (Did wrong)
So when you find yourself in peices
You tryin to kill me boy (no)
Is that what you wanna do, kill me? You wanna kill me (kill me)
Ma, You're not feelin me the beepers not that drastic
Its the B blasted, bastard
Your lyin (your lyin)
You took plastic freezer bags with ---- inside of em
She knew, damn but she hated that it was true
I done raised two boys I can do away with you
The locks changed and the nights got colder
Im ----- ---- lookin like the ----- -----
---- it im the osta
Im down for mounds ride by my corner
Like Im not gone cry
Not reek the pain of watchin my youngest man
On the corners ------- ----
I'm callin the cops

[Chorus x2]
Ma even though I left the house alone
I was seventeen years old on my own using these streets as my home
Theres no reason to prolong this beef (yea i love you)
Ms. Eleanor Trice I place no one above you
You the reason when I hustled I knew the stack
The reason when I opened up t mics i knew to rip
The ethnics you instilled on this hectic young brother
Rubbed off after all
Now look at ya boy
When they ask about me now you ain't gon just put ya head down ma
Straighten up ma you can smile now, proud
Everythings kosher with the bosterous oysta
Lets get closer
So the regrets never opposed us

[Chorus x2]
