Intro:
Nigga, Nigga you can't do that nigga you are wrong

Hook:
These motherfuckers wanna kill me!
Probably cause I'm fly as fuck
Only nigga in the club be high like what
They wanna kill me! Probably cause his characters tight
I'm the rapper that they make sure they bitch don't like
They wanna kill me! See they jealous of sale
Cause I'm talented, with his arrogant self
They wanna kill me! Bust him in the hood like whoa
They don't understand I feel like going nuts
Kill me!

1st Verse:
Homeboy you's a fag, you got your momma's traits, you gossip like a bitch
Hate a nigga cause your mans getting rich, I'm from the slums dumb son of a bitch
Sold crack like nino, yep I got a ego, but since they wasn't present them boys don't believe you
This ain't [?], this realistically, OT's history's in the streets
That's why there chemistry between Eminem and me
Cause he recognize the same OG
Ain't nothin change but change, a nigga's nuts still hang the same, since he was a young mane
A nigga slang till the sun came, till the funds gained up enough to put em in the Range
Now these niggas act strange, they wanna blow out Obie Trice's brains

Hook

2nd Verse:
I ain't mad at ya dog, to get money on the streets I get it from billboards
Homie if you subtract the voice, you'd still be giving invoices to fiends for selling them boy
You see Obie is the truth, thank God I'm in this roof, left the same night, Bullets by his brain right?
A couple more inches could have been a night night, but the almighty wasn't ready for O Trice
I'm still here like day and night, you thought I was deceased saw my way to them bright lights
I still manage, nigga my heads damaged, that ain't stop O from getting cabbage faggots (Kill Me!!)
These niggas wanna see me dead, cause the intelligence that flows through my head
Wanna be a sharp shooter better be a fed, cause I ain't going no fuckin where

Hook

3rd Verse:
I'm on my grizzly nigga
O Trice make history nigga
I'm from the hood I pop that trigger
Shady Records till I'm six feet deeper
Put a hole in a nigga tryna creep up
Take your soul make you meet the grim reaper
You's a sleeper, non-believer
That's why you deceased up nigga

Hook
