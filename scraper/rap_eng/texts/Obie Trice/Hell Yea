[Verse 1 - 2X]
They say he lonely, he ain't got big homie
He strayed from Interscope now they don't know me
Only reason he succeeded was reverse E
Or maybe he was nursed by a Doc beat
But Slim and Dre's still in my DNA
("Chka-chka Slim Shady") ("Dr. Dre")

[Bridge]
Consume my body, found a trace of gangsta party
But I don't give a fuck in my artery
It's BME but fam forever part of me

[Hook: Obie Trice]
I'mma have to go on without quote-unquote
(Hell yea) You know the boy Trice dope
Put a few of you niggas through high school
Hyped ya IQ, average man into a psycho
(Obie!) You know I got 'em big homie
This ain't so long, I just had to own me
BME 'til a nigga C.P
I'mma do it for the D (Hell yea)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it broke my heart seein Beans and Hova
As a music listener I know who y'all vote for
But e'rything black's not white, white's not black
That's the music business for ya
But as a consumer 'stead of you gettin a tumor
You opt out for the obvious bloomer
But the least obvious the one that'll do ya
That's learned knowledge from comin up in the sewer
And I ain't wreckin my cap to (Fuze) the gap
I just want (Yoo-hoo), this is the music to adapt
And if that ain't real rap
Obie Trice need to fall back - fuck that

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Through digi' design might lose my mind
So the digits I make won't be a surprise
Eyes wide open, Obie know you're fake
You ain't gotta say a word, I can see through your make
Wait 'til I get in hip-hop I'mma take
Give it to the needy, he who appreciates
No it's not the hustle
But you gotta have some type of love for this culture I grew up to
Muster up somethin for the folks who appreciate vocals
'stead of them duds that make 'em roast you
Who am I to coach as well?
I'mma take a different approach, you niggas pound-sign, fail

[Hook]

[Outro]
OHHHH! BME!, Obie Trice!, Bottoms Up!
