[Intro: Proof]
Yeah, this is DJ Seven Deuce
Of the Motown sounds on W-Down, ha ha
Give a big shout out to Runyan Ave
And them Detroit players, y'knowhatImean?
And we gonna go to the phone lines right now
Caller.. {*BEEP*}

[Rondelle Beene ]
Caller my ass! You know who this is
Look I'm mad as hell
First you got Eminem, this nigga say he gon' get me on his album
No show I didn't get on it
Then he signed these niggas D-12, these lil' punk ass niggas
Then all of a sudden I heard he signed a new motherfucker named

[Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, first I took the underground over
The "Well Known Asshole" brought y'all horror
Then the industry saw interest in me
Now I'm Shady Records like Marshall Mathers LP
Mr. Trice, the name has occured
In your conversation, but the face is a blur
And if you never spoke my name, nigga you heard
Got word, from that mega bitch that stay bootleggin
Underground since the Fu-Schnickens
Or underground since Chi-Ali was fuckin with them stupid bitches
Different species (AHHH!)
Shittin on you punk motherfuckers
With a Dirty Dozen type of feces
