[Intro]

[Obie Trice]
I’ma get rich die trying
I’m gonna get my piece of dough pie
Cause it’s cold out here, it’s cold, it’s cold

30 below, burner underneath the bubble coat
A coke in hand that come hope
Most folks here to mess the holocaust
But most folks didn’t …
Can’t show them the ropes, you gotta wear that loose
Hang themselves, just to be aware the truth
Chasing the root of all evil, the fruits of our egos
Leaving us negros getting in illegal
That’s when the cracks go, from whatever attacks you
Back against the wall, this ain’t what a nigga asked for
What effects of life, smacking dead in the face
You serving up Tudy, she tooting on base
Basically, the paper got me in this race
My neighbors hate me, saying he’s a waste
See it’s not on my mind, not to rely on the grind
I’ma get rich or die trying

I’ma get rich die trying
I’m gonna get my piece of dough pie
Cause it’s cold out here, it’s cold, it’s cold
I’ma get rich die trying
I’m gonna get my piece of dough pie
Cause it’s cold out here, it’s cold, it’s cold

Pushing yayo, the young buck in the game
Trying to get my 50 cents up and a name
Moving G units, getting my banks of the use
…truth is
Other niggas queers, never flip pigs
Living through uncles, peers
Shit I touch, should have been fuck outta here
Yeah this luck like most us out here
Steal your grind, never loose hustle
Paper that it came and went don’t let it fuck with you
You are clutching the gear nigga trust
Never forget struggle
That’s what a nigga nuts for
Speak for those who came upon dough and lost it
Now his brain is no more, he lost it
So he weight the 44, waiting to blaze
Anybody with a cash flow

I’ve been trying road for too long
Digging through empty pockets
Wondering where it all went, all went
It’s so much cash that passed through these hands
So much it won’t believe cause
I got nothing to show …
These trials of life, they only made me stronger
Cause I’ve learned
That’s why I gotta keep on and get rich
Die trying, I’m gonna get my piece of dough pie
Cause it’s cold out here, it’s cold, it’s cold
I’ma get rich die trying
I’m gonna get my piece of dough pie
Cause it’s cold out here, it’s cold, it’s cold
