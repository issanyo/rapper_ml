[Chorus: Drey Skonie]
Not too many understand
They don't hear the truth
Youy think it's all a movie
If you only knew
I'm just making moves, money on my mind
I ain't spending time
Step in to my shoes, only on the grind
And I'm bout to fly, so high-i
So high-i
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Over a decade my debut
Dedicated to the music I could give a F less what they do
Respirator my efforts later, show what time I lose you
That's OK cause I'm courageous I play with time like a fool do
Who knew
I manoeuvre this new school, come from where two's got drew
Bullets let loose, lose someone in your crew
Dude in the lobby wanna shoot your body put him in ICU
Came to point proxy, gotta box your own way out like Rocky nigga
Rest in peace to big Proof I'm on my grind homie
Retribution for you, I keep my mind on it
Can't stop now, gotta see him on top now
Can't get locked now
Cause he on the block pocket full of rock trying to lock up a small town
Never let my guard down, disregard you clowns
Discharge a few rounds y'all giving rich round three pounds
I'm getting rich, verbs and nouns so let me get the itch bird and pounds
It'll be hurricane Obie round this bitch, flood your town Nigga

[Chorus: Drey Skonie]
Not too many understand
They don't hear the truth
Youy think it's all a movie
If you only knew
I'm just making moves, money on my mind
I ain't spending time
Step in to my shoes, only on the grind
And I'm bout to fly, so high-i
So high-i
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Boy really from that bottom
Father leave, family fall, just like it's autumn
Let me be, when you see me turning up that bottle
I just need time to breathe that clear, never got the best of me
My therapy's what's best for me, young nigga looking for clarity
[?]
Apparently I was paralyzed when the pear split no paradise
No fear is given when a thug cry
No mercy nigga when a slug fly
Looking at life through my eye, sobriety nah uh
That's why I stay wide eyed, rare young nigga got a right eye
Fuck a DUI I miss my momma, pa stay high high
Out of options so  I crack the seal intoxicants
I look to the sky intoxicated, no reply, irritated
Look in the mirror and I fear nature the end is near I see you later
We both creators, when I go hiatus
Until then I'm gross paper get a big dose of Obie haters

[Chorus: Drey Skonie]
Not too many understand
They don't hear the truth
Youy think it's all a movie
If you only knew
I'm just making moves, money on my mind
I ain't spending time
Step in to my shoes, only on the grind
And I'm bout to fly, so high-i
So high-i
Yeah
