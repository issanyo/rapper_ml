[Intro]
Making lots of dough (2X)
MTK, just let 'em ride, man

You know what, you ain't even gotta like it
This lease for more excitement
Even though you're wrong dick ride it won't ride it
You're gone with your quants by Obie and White Kid
You have to get my own like Oprah at a high pitch
Which means I win free of all extra fingers
In my income increase whenever Obie give inks
I say I ain't moan when a print licks
When a print licks Obie Trice and BME bee

(Making lots of dough)

(Just tryin' to get it)
Nigga, I'mma murder shit even if it's the chill in circuit
I did all the thorium style as a nigga's purchase
Pay the emmision 'cause Obie Trice just worth it
Meet my destimals back, Obie Trice deserves it
What I don't deserve is your funny ass plugs
See a star person nigga probably shit his trous'
I smell he a fan, but it won't admit it char
Real name no gimmicks I'mma gonna get it bar
Like Whoo Kid

(Making lots of dough, making lots of dough)

Yeah, I know it's been a minute since sir Trice convenience (That's me)
I got my own life outside to see obedience (Fucker)
So talk to the hen like a BME image (Fucker)
Tells 'bout your man ya niggas need to quit it
You know they try to pop out guess I hate my spinach
End it up living had it what they intended
I ain't disappear like a blemish, I'm here
I'm the illest like the iller just that's make this hear clear, BME

(Making lots of dough)

(Ha-hah, yeah)
How hater how ate this is '86 (Hello) I'm back like '86 (Hello)
The champagne bubble over, bezzle buck get the cold shoulder
Show love but get rolled over, O Trice I'm a known soldier
From a city where pushin' boulders what you supposed to (That's sick)
He ain't had my upbringin' on my orah
See they got teeth that's crack head Gloria

(Making lots of though)

Money on my mind that's all Trice designed
Haters on the knees 'fore O Trice to climb
A sucker MC's and no friends of mine
I'm so DMC to the fake niggas I'm blind
But it's cataract show them where the platinum's at
A red catalog stacks niggas can fav from that
They just wanna hold a nigga back
Yeah, I wanna see 'em count stack so obviously whack

(Making lots of dough, making lots of dough)

(This actually gay, I do it 'cause, 'cause it's my tool, no homo)
You know what? I need a whole lot of money
Dig a hole in hoe to a home motherfucking fam love me
I needed hoe, no onions to them po-po hoes
Roll up on an O, try to cuff me
I got a whole lot of foes, point pistols
When I leave a nigga froze, 'cause he getting money
I'm in a hole, I suppose 'cause I live in a burbs
Think like a girl, what you want from me (Why?)
I'm holey, I suppose 'cause I caught bullet holes
And my casket didn't close, you ain't ready for me
My nigga rolls out of hospies, boxes full of dick
Nikes full of toes, bless what me
Did the whole lot of shows, whole lot of dough
Tucked in a hoes in my polo khakis
I'm a whole lot of this, whole lot of that
I'm hold 'em up, that's O actually
It's just me

(Making lots of dough, making lots of dough)
