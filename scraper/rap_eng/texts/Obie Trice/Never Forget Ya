[Verse 1]
Yes I understand I done came a long way
From huggin them corners to appearin on TV
From choppin up nicks like this here feeds me
To makin 'em hits like this shit's easy
But it's not, it's a whole lot of bullshit involved
And truthfully, I'd rather be bullshittin with y'all
But I gotta chase the donuts, Cocoa's growin
And it's like "Oh shit, she was just born"
And now she knowin every song on the radio
If I hear another Bow Wow quotable (Oh no)
Grown as ever, school craft for ever
Recognize real when I stare at ya, my niggas
I'm a hold you down, even when I'm not around
I'm just gone for now, I'll be back in a while
Back in a while, yes (Said I'll be back in a while)

[Hook]
My niggas Koon and G, never forget ya
John Doe, I will never forget ya
Jo Jo, I will never forget ya
P-Funk, how could I ever forget ya?
Terry T, I will never forget ya
My man B, I will never forget ya
Strafmoore, Obie will never forget ya
Lauda, how could I ever forget ya?

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to my chick friends
Never stuck in my dick in friends, just my down ass bitches
You know who you is like you know how
To get a sucker mothafucka's riches, y'all ain't shit
And when I touch back home, nigga, find me a bitch
With a fat ass, and no I ain't down to trick
That's asinine, I'm on the grind and I'm tryin to get rich
All this a mine so y'all got some, get your wigs did
My ridettes from East to West
North to South, stab a bitch for runnin her mouth
Five rugrats, big gun in the house, you run up in
You get stretched up out without a doubt, it's vicious
This go out to all my tataliciouses
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin about

[Hook]
Big homie Creda baby, never forget ya

Keena Johnson, I will never forget ya

[Verse 3]
And now that the album is sold, the story unfolds
Cause I'm probably asleep on your living room flo'
Whether gold or plat, O. Trice
Always knows to go back, pass the Carnac
Crash the Cadillac, nigga ain't shit changed
Just a lot a change, a whole lot a brain
A whole lot a dates, a whole lot a thang
But hey I'm from the D, I got a whole lot a game
And I promise, I'm as thorough as you made me
Detroit living, I'm in thoroughly with Shady
I make moves 'til them fools come engrave me
They crazy, the pistol was cocked, he won't play me, yeah

[Hook]
Rest in peace my nigga Lou Green, I will never forget ya
Little Randy, I will never forget ya
Keith, I will never forget ya

My nigga Shan, never forget ya
All my niggas that's gone, never forget ya
I love ya'll, it's on never forget ya

[Outro]
Yeah, Shady baby! Detroit motherfuckers (313 baby)
That's right, we in here, know what I mean? (Never forget ya)
I've been seein the struggle my nigga
I'm rest to go, the color ain't purple, the color is green
Let's get this money, Hop-o, yeah, momma, right here
