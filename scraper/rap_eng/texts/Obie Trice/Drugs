[Verse 1: Bizarre]
How the fuck Bizarre get this high
Drunk off 75 I lost my right eye
On ecstasy, bitches undress me
Balls in their mouth like dizzy gillespie
Now who the fuck wanna get fucked from behind
I do two lines, put my dick in the bitches spine
Rottweilers, I leave em sedated
My dick so big my dog got his ass spaded
I'm at the airport, police tryin' to get me
Two pounds of coke in my bag, but it belongs to whitney
Bitch, go send Bobby to get me, or get your ass beat the fuck up by Cindy
Obie don't temp me, or I'll rape this bitch and use no fuckin' jimmy
Sniffin coke, pass out on the banister, what the fuck you expect dude strawberry's my manager

[Hook: Bizarre]
Drugs, let the pain run through your body
Drugs, let the pills take control of your soul
Drugs, let the pain run through your body
Drugs, let the pills take control of your soul
Lets get hiiiiiigh

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
The drugs is costin', so alcohol is often
Engulfed in Obie Trice pee more than that THC
Depression get me to drink more, but I did that before even when I wasn't stressin
It's like barley, bacardi stimulate my body to the point I might crash your party
Hungover the next morning, remember the shit hardly
7-up motherfucker don't bother me
At times I get intimate with a bitch and my dick goes limp but I'm still a pimp
Yes, my liver resembles a shrimp, cirrhosis so close while I wild out irish rose
Hold my dick while me and Bizarre pose for them extra fat hoes, gamin' to get us home
Jumped my bones, I was drunk and gone, I gotta leave these wild drugs alone nigga

[Hook: Bizarre]

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I lick clit til' your fuckin' pussy blister
I'm at the Grammys, snortin' coke with Beyonce's little sister
Want beef? I'm more than a rapper
It'll be lights out, like you had the fuckin' clapper
My girl, she don't wanna make love no more
Fuck it that's what they make crackheads for
A pound of weed, I spent about a g
This is America, get your drugs for free

[Verse 4: Obie Trice]
Vodka, Brandy, Whiskey, Brew
Bizarre, Obie Trice, brain cells through
Ecstasy, vicodin hikes up my heart rate
Fuck it being high runs right up my alleyway
I drink like you eat, you don't eat like I drink though, not even fatsos
I guzzle, no sipper, wet my whiskers, get wit' cha
Challenge anybody crushin' liquor nigga
