Babe uh, yeah
Girl, you my only one though aight
You my baby, fuck all that shit
You're the one for me, check it out
Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin' your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
'Cause the vibe you giving me now feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other womens around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house
If I call, you're in route there's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different
You gon' ride for me
Then I'm gon' ride for you
If you put your mouth on me
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do
Any problem we can see it through
Baby if you promise to be true
I will never put my hands on you, come on and think about it
We ain't even got to talk when we see each other
We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin'
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
'Cause I'm namin' him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too ,when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy, this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggas muffin'
You're fucking wit her husband
You gon' ride for me
Then I'm gon' ride for you
If you put your mouth on me
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do
Any problem we can see it through
Baby if you promise to be true
I will never put my hands on you, come on and think about it
Come on and think about it you got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanut butter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her baby father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon' stop up? Nobody, we's that deal
You gon' ride for me
Then I'm gon' ride for you
If you put your mouth on me
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do
Any problem we can see it through
Baby if you promise to be true
I will never put my hands on you, come on and think about it
If you gon' stand by me then
I'm gon' stand by you
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you
But don't you play me for no fool
Bitch 'cause if I put my mouth on you
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new, come on and think about it
Yeah, Obie Trice
Shady, yeah
