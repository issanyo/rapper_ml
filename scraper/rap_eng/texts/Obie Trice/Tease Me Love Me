[Intro]
Yeah, I'm here, Obie Trice
Keep me in your prayers, I ain't going nowhere (Whoo Kid)
That's right

[Hook]
I’m a hustler 'til I’m tucked up in a coffin
To these niggas offer what you got (Keep me baby)
When a dream ain’t popping you don't see a nigga often (Yeah)
Obie off the scene motherfucking sky (Keep me baby)
I swear, I’m here, I’m so sincere (Yeah, love me baby)

[Verse 1]
Nobody quite do it like Trice do
I’m like Mike when it comes to this music
Or Kobe strove to the hole, can’t hold me
Sto goalie, I is good, I is good
Even a snottie knows sno nigga
I rised out of my hood
The odds should have compromised the sliper
Oh shit, the complo mist of Mike
Which means this content is tight
Which means the conscience to anything you write
You gotta (Keep me baby)

[Bridge]
I swear, I’m here, I’m so sincere (Love me baby)

[Verse 2]
From the bottoms up, he ain't an item what
Whoever you idealizing I don't give a fuck
Cause whoever you idealizing, admiring
That nigga that's laying in the cut
Waiting on his turn to burn it up
And when it's his turn and can't touch it
A nigga that earned
The one that put your favorite MC in the earn
Talking out of tourney burn
And I ain't talking about new niggas that got to live and learn
When I return it's Detroit furn, so (Keep me baby)

[Bridge]
