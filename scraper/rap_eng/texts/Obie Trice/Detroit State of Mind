What up
Jokes on us

[Chorus]
Everything in the city ain’t pretty
When you’re looking at the curvy, thick
Trying to make a way to survive
Even though it ain’t right
I’m trying to preach another ghetto hymn
A state that doers be
Hustling to come up all my life
Testify, it’s just a Detroit state of mind

[Verse 1]
Detroit win’er, cold in December
Hustle on the corner, tether on the fibula
N_ wanna stick ‘em up cause O’s getting richerer
That ain’t a word, but birds they speak literature
Literally hood house, semi in the couch
Figuring life out with this last half an ounce
We just trying to defeat the drought, make ends meet
Flous like a motherfucking bous
Slim Thugger Sig Deuce ninety
Drug smuggler, they ain’t got love for us
Cuff us, throw us in jail for being hustlers
We on that knuckle so why would you fuck with us?
[?]
Y’all don't know Pacific
Just to be 'pecific, N_, came out of Michigan
No pot to piss in
Just a few rocks in this pocket for flippin’

[Chorus]
Everything in the city ain’t pretty
When you’re looking at the curvy, thick
Trying to make a way to survive
Even though it ain’t right
I’m trying to preach another ghetto hymn
A state that doers be
Hustling to come up all my life
Testify, it’s just a Detroit state of mind

Turn this shit the fuck up

[Verse 2: J-Nutty]
I come up amongst the monster youngsters
Blazin' ass, wrong facing time
They’ll blow out a N_ state of mind
Real talk, white lines
That’s real chalk, night time we peel off
Through pipelines, we deal raw, real boss
Seen it all through my optical at spots
Aunties and uncles coppin the blow
In areas not many cops can go
If possible, I got a purpose
God put me here on purpose, or worse
[?]
Or am I worthless? I wish life was picture perfect
The feds taking pictures, snitches working
Them dealers lurking, through the traffic
Pushers pushing the package
Neighborhood full of addicts, graveyard full of caskets
They asking, time waits for a dboy
Where the street noise it’s the real deep d voice
Evading the decoy, all shooters on deploy
Fuck the crime rate, my mind state is Detroit

[Chorus]
Everything in the city ain’t pretty
When you’re looking at the curvy, thick
Trying to make a way to survive
Even though it ain’t right
I’m trying to preach another ghetto hymn
A state that doers be
Hustling to come up all my life
Testify, it’s just a Detroit state of mind

Everything in the city ain’t pretty
When you’re looking at the curvy, thick
Trying to make a way to survive
Even though it ain’t right
I’m trying to preach another ghetto hymn
A state that doers be
Hustling to come up all my life
Testify, it’s just a Detroit state of mind
