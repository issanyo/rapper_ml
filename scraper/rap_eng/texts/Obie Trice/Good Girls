[Verse 1]
Graduated U of M, summa cum laude, few of them
Just had her first IUD, ain't tryin' to have birth by Obie T
Louis bag, big as shit, rule area, Borics
Nigga need a cut, nigga need to get trimmed up
She so proper wit' it
Lingo lil' different when I say, "Let's hit that store"
She pronounce them words like she work for white people

[Verse 2]
Magistrate's her mami, but it's more heat though, it's Miami
No beach clothes on her fanny, got a nigga ego so Grammys
I done won an award on the water, she'll never bored, I score
Shoot to the top floor, then record her, she in love wit' a bad boy
It's that Dior or [?], got her feelin' euphoric, bitch
What you think that U for? Perfect time to run through this dick
Say she like my lips, fell in love in licks
Never had it like this, growin' up, it stinks
Body so murderous
It's only right first forty-eight sit on a urban dick
She got on my baedar when I seen that she so cold
She don't care who they are, just as long as wit' O

[Verse 3]
That appearance got them starin', that two dress oval-barin'
Them hips and ass so gifted
Nigga might think he just missed Christmas
I'm a put it on my wish list
Got to give it to the hood like the fellas I witness
I'm a get this, put a little bit of wood on her
Get straight to the business
Nah, it's VIP, KOD, fingerin' her booty hole, you know me
Baby on the pole, young PYT want to be wit' we, makes it three
Bottle-sippin' wit' the model citizens, she probably be a politician
Got to get it out her system 'fore the ballad kicks in
Cause, babe, they'll might go missin'
Just want to follow sister when her bottom's crimson
Body so convincin'
Nigga want to follow sister when her bottom's crimson
Her body so convincin'
