[Intro: Rob Reef]
Obie Trice, let's talk about Obie, uh, what he meant to the label
You know. Detroit born and bred and uh
You know, had sold you know
A couple million albums and really was like the, uh, you know
A really important component of the label

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
"Detroit vs. Everybody", my version
Still keep the clocks workin', thot's twerkin'
Still hold the notch under my Louis Vuitton
I'm certain, I'm still ill, I'm still about mine
Still young sick on his prime
Still call me Pat , way before his crime
Still go to bat for my fellas, call me the young Cabrera
Niggas better crown me three times
Nigga sold crack in this bitch, my nicks like three dimes
Fiends so high, should have charged them three times
Still in the cutty with my lil buddy
He say fuck his medication, he still nutty
And crown hangin', 1911
20th century if you ever mention me, this means history
BME that's the D, that's Obie Trice, that's who I be

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You don't want the walking dead, put you in a coffin yeah
It happens quite often here
Bullets will appear, penetrate your appearance
On your death bed while the doc yellin' clear
You ain't livin' guts over fear
Nigga you nuts, you wanna ruin your career?
In God we trust, no apology, be an autopsy
Niggas don't follow me Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Feeling like Kal-El versus Zod and his entourage
With the armor like [?]
And modification have you on a vacation
Ever invasive over me and my squad
You know the city limits got the illest image
You ought to know a nigga before you come and visit
It's vicious
Them individuals don't give a shit
Cause they been living in this bitch with only government assistance
Flipping prescriptions, injestin' as well
My suggestion to you, is to adjust to hell
It's just like that, hard justice fails
And you just another cat with a slug in his shell
I represent the D till my peeps mournin'
Till I'm 1300, East Warren
You don't feel me, then believe warning
Might not leave performin', who shot 'cha?

[Hook]

[Outro: Eminem]
...There was something about Obie's delivery, it was his voice, it was so strong, it was like, you know, it would fucking cut you. He didn't fuck around, he meant business...

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Yeah, woulda died for the narrator, you know me, I ride on the hater, suicide every collab with a player
Send drive-bys through you lair, later, 1.0, the boy rare
Shady since a nigga 15, spray ya'
Wanna race in the D? What city fucking with we?
Rest in peace to the fucking mayor, P!
