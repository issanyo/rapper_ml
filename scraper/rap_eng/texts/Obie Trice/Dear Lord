[Hook]
Dear Lord, please forgive me, more I live I grow empty
Nothin' in me, point out my enemy I'll put somethin' in him
*Blam* Feelin' like that's the only remedy
Send him on his way when I fuck around his day
("Okay!") Cause to you they wanna send me
And I ain't got the energy, I'll let the clip empty
("Okay! O-o-o-okay-k-kay! Kay-k-kay, kay-kay!")

[Verse 1]
I ain't gotta walk around town with my chest stuck out
A frown up my face when the press come out
Niggas know what it is, one of the best, no doubt
Doubt that, test him and the S's come about
Aggression niggas need without
Too aggressive niggas rest under leaves where the G's hang out
I'm back stronger than ever
D-boy so it's like whatever, however, whenever
I dare ya, pall bearers bury ya
Pardon my, positivity failure
But they ain't tryin to hear ya when niggas'll go and air ya ass out
Send you to the morgue, turn you inside-out
Send you to your momma 'til she pass out
Too many partners in the casket now
These foul bastards, don't appreciate life so fuck 'em
The P-nina-nina stay dumpin' (Stay dumpin')

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now Trice ain't all about runnin' his mouth
He do that for a livin', y'all gotta feel him
In the streets he mute, my nigga autism
Don't confuse this with art-ism
Nigga I refuse to lose, boss in him
Put your people in a pew when the mossberg start spittin'
I'm livin', nigga I'm kiddin' him
Take him from his paradise, Trice on his way to prison
Picture him leavin' his children
I peel 'em, pilgrimage to another region
Them ecstasy pills got niggas schemers
When the weapons spill them same niggas bleedin'
'Fore I leave this world they gon' believe him
O ain't deceivin' these people, that's feedin' 'em
The hood's what he breathin, it's all good
Leave him in that box all wood (Box all wood)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Trice is nice with aim, put a nigga
In a permanent frame, when a nigga's
So determined to bang, cause a nigga's
Switchin' lanes in that European thang
Don't be mad at your boy-boy, handle business
Cause he push the toy-toy, niggas envious
Crutch him up, Jehovah Witnesses
When the semi's start spittin', listen (Listen)

[Hook]

[Outro]
*Blam*
("Okay!")
("Okay! O-o-o-okay-k-kay! Kay-k-kay, kay-kay!")

Dear Lord, please forgive me, more I live I grow empty
Nothin' in me, point out my enemy I'll put somethin' in him *Blam*
