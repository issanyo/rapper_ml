[Intro]
Me and RZA connect, me and RZA connect
BME, OT
Rest in peace, Eleanor Trice!

So sick

[Verse]
Ma, I dedicate this to you, so let the music play
I pray to God you forgave me like a new day
It's hard for me to even try to spew this way
Them last days in the coma induced you layed
Put my hand on the girl come up with the words you deserve
Vitals machine going berserk, I know you heard me
Same breast that nourished me
Got my own Earth beneath the dirt now
Know you wanna see 'em glowing
Keep on, God got an exchange a form
Who thought deeper for loss I had me popping bottle top soft
Celebrating the home goin', I'm alone
So I keep the phone on just to hear your voice tone
With your boy in the zone, mom, I'm in the zone!
I'm in the zone!
