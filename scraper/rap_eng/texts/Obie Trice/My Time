[Intro]
Got money on my mind, no time for nonsense
I'm getting mine, 'bout to shine around here
Lights in the bezel, price up a level
Twenties on the feet, catch him in the street

[Verse 1]
Twenties on the Hemi, nigga made his quota
Nigga still (Shady), even though we over
That don't stop my dollars from rolling over the mower
I'mma put that product out until my casket below us
Obie never slow up, getting it sho' 'nuff
I'mma be a problem 'til the world freezes over
Pistol in this holster, shooting like the Pistons
Bitches on his dick cause they know he about his business
Beating up the block is something very expensive
Ice in his watch, haters paying attention
Trice in the cockpit navigating the engine
Aviators watching for haters trying to stick him
Get money 'til the day I'm a victim
Til I lay beneath the clay all stiff then
But for now I'mma get my rich in
Double that dollar - flipping

[Hook]
Got money on my mind, no time for nonsense
I'm gettin mine, 'bout to shine around here
Lights in the bezel, price up a level
Twenties on the feet, catch him in the street

Bet a nigga like me never catch him on the beat
Get that bet twice, I'mma catch him with the heat
Money on my mind, homie on the grind
Been away a minute but it's my time

[Verse 2]
Jumping out of cars, in and out of broads
Spending, we ain't penny adding, we be getting ours
Show you how to floss, show you buy the bars
Y'all all talk, we notice y'all flaws
Y'all in-laws, we married to the game
Y'all just the mayne, next to the mayne
I been spending change since the dope game
Then he made a name for himself after cocaine
Call him Kwame Kilpatrick, you could try to catch him
Dope I got access, no text messaging
Trice is an asset
Niggas in the trap know his past say he know where the cash at
Louie on his toes, dubs on the vehicle
BME, I see it though
I'mma need it my nigga then repeat it though
D-boy in that two-seater, let's go!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
In and out of jets, him is but a vet
Been around the world, him ain't finished yet
And I don't need London to bloke or be stuntin
I poke out like a bunion in any country I run in
With any culture the code is his ulcer[?]
Thug co-exist in the hood to Nova Scotia
Fists full of dollars, lipstick
On a nigga's collar courtesy of your missus
You don't wanna miss this, misfit
Mr. Michigan, getting this, richness, in
I'm a better me, tell me who 'head of he?
I'm something like veteran using letters over melodies
Trice is still in it
Real name, no gimmick, never fold cause of business
(Business) Bitches (bitches)
I'mma get it for X over, nigga you be the witness

[Hook]
