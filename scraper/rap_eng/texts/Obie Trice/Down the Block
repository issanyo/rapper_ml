[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
BME, trust the truth's in the booth
He don't take a hit to let 'em know I'm bulletproof
Rest in peace Proof, this is no truce
This is hood music brought directly to you
Mac-11 in the Chevy with a nigga or two
Ready for whatever, we cuckoo, loose screw
Used to bungalows juicing up fiends
Just to ride 'round in the new school
Come from basehead rentals, same faces, no dental
Claiming they gon' pay incidentals
Give a fiend a break, he see God all in ya
Then he run game 'till your change all minimal
Pinning them predicaments to live that life
I been spending Benjamins since the early '90s
Now BME is where a nigga can find me
Still on the grind nigga still getting mine
Nigga I don't slip, handle 'em, rap's Rip Hamilton
All in his mansion, gambling
Alls I'm trying to do is match 'em, rapping
Get a couple chicks, I'm rambling, stab 'em

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Everyting is real on this concrete and steel
Niggas peel your cap for a happy meal
I got to deal with this ball of confusion, world of illusions
We ain't losin' playa (never), weez winnin'
Playin' every night when we sendin' paper chasing, grinin'
While you still chasin' women 'round tables no lieutenants
Use your own man grown, (hook it up)
It's Ice Cube and the family stone
Breakin' bread every night in L.A
And I pray, for one more day that's unate (check it)
It's 90 degrees no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall to his knees every night
I'm lovin' every breath like a cold sip of soda
While I'm bankin' down these back streets, thanks for lookin' over
Damn sure nice to know ya, fuck a four leaf clover
And thanks for this range rover
We gets down with this underground gangsta shit
Politians and parents, always havin' a fit
Everybody wanna know "who you with?" "where you from?"
Why you lookin' at me dumb?
Here's a bullet cause you number one

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Soulja boy swag, cold so polar
I got so many cars, Soulja boy motors
Pull up and I’m flexing on rodeo drive
I got 55 racks and my pocket going live
Stacks on deck boys, we all about them plays
I be like hold on homie, you don’t know what we hate
It be hood dre flexing and sod flexing
I be pulling up on pipes 24 and flexing
Everywhere we go you know that we winning
Big bank wrote a letter know that we winning
Everybody know that my whole squad is winning
Stacks on deck, we gonn kill em, we gonn kill em
I’m pulling up and I hurt the haters’ feelings
Everybody know Soulja boy straight grilling
I’m on the hook and it’s a great feeling
Taking over everyday, niggas straight drilling

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Like Iraq, C-4 in backpacks
You can pull straps but you can't match that
Thought you was lord of shit bitch, why you let him snitch?
Put the gun in your hand, now we can settle it
Put it up, to his head, I can't do it for ya
You, be the trigger man, kill your own brother
See, how it feels when he drops, and he bleeds
I handed you heat, it was your op-tion to squeeze
Drop, to your knees, look at me, and believe
There's only one way to get out of this thing
Barrel aimed at your face, cock back, fire straight
Now at least neither one of us'll catch a murder case
Flyin down the 5, flicked out, gettin high
Jump off on Lincoln, roll through, Anaheim
Rush, of a homicide, races, through my mind
Not commit, any crime anywhere, anytime
