[Intro 1]
I'd like to thank you all for purchasing the new Obie Trice album
It's well appreciated
I'd like to thank you all for copping my classic Cheers
The Seconds Round's On Me, it's well appreciated, no doubt
Detroit city stand up

[Verse 1]
They say when a nigga for testing
They say that he stay kept with his Smith & Wesson
Story tells us his accomplishment's a blessing
Now that's what the fuck I call an urban legend
When a verse kept him from serving corrections
Turf he slept in had notorious conditions
All of symptoms that ought to send me to prison
Yet he had a vision
And since then, I've witnessed those visions
An eye witness to put sense into it, you ain't listening
Get it? I hate to keep twisting 'em
My mind ventures, I spit with conviction
Nothing fabricated or based of forcism
Simply kicking what's living in O Trice's system, come on

[Intro 2]
I wanna thank Shady records for backing me up for all those years
Nigga, Eminem, Paul Rosenberg, Riggs Morales, (?)
I wanna thank all my label mates, D12, 50 Cent, G-Unit
Stat Quo, Bobby Creek' and Cashis, it's been one hell of a run

[Verse 2]
Album number truces, found him in a booth nostalging
With Dre pounding the beat machine
O Trice say nothing, deleting them
'Scope couldn't destroy my evening
We are the elite, machine
Niggas is ass backwards, thinking they in the class, as if
And have access to these type of masses
When I seen this, massive
From a black teen with dreams of being this rapper
What happened is that he slipped between the cracks
Brought to your ears all the years that I've captured
Re-appeared after Cheers, the classic
Second Round's On Me showed you O mastered it
Cause Obie not an actor in this shit
Actually, it's action show you know different
I'm ah be a victim on the set that I lived in
'til I die, it's Obie Tri'
Try to understand this psychological span
From serving them grams to inserving them fans
That's right, Obie hurting them, man
