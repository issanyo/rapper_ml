[Hook - Obie Trice] (*echo*)
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Who the fuck gon' tell me shit?
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all niggas can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Motherfucker you can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all cats can't tell me shit

[Verse 1 - Obie Trice]
Yo, I sold dope, watched fiends crave for rock
Watch 'em watchin me put the stash in my sock
Walkie-talk to niggas from the corner when the Feds 'bout to enter
Pumped up blocks, summer to winter
Kerosene heaters by my feet
Takin tops off, just so a nigga can eat lunch meat
Four days, no Z's
From the first to third, end of the month, I'm too excited to get sleep
I bagged up twos
Aggravated by picky crackheads who don't know which rock to choose
Took outta town trips
Two seconds in the son of a bitch, narcs run in, talkin shit
I know about dope, I lost my man Lou to the coke
Pumpin over there off of DeSoto
Any nigga who don't know about this
I hit ya with the Iron Mike quote "that's ludicrous!"
Shittin in the tub, pissin in the tub
Hepatitis B inflicted in a thug
I know about that shit right there (know about that shit right there)

[Hook - Obie Trice] (*echo*)
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all cats can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all niggas can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Motherfucker you can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all cats can't tell me shit

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]
I done had jobs black
Boss man yellin at the top of his lungs about a fuckin Big Mac
He damn near fired
A restaurant manager who can't manage shit from bein stressed out and tired
I'm talkin about blacks
You work all week with Boo and one day your man Boo just collapse
His breakdown's 'caused by his bitch, who dropped the drawers
For a nigga who could really floss
Five twenty-five, it make your mouth leak
And on top of that shit, you get a check every other week
You work a week in the hole, there's thirty motherfuckers on payroll
Shit, you work when they want you to
Equal opportunity? Yeah right
Suburban community check stubs always hella tight
And my shit lookin like this
I got a bitch, a baby and I need a place to piss
Pissed off at check time cause I was skipped
That's when Obie Trice start cockin back his shit (cockin back his shit)

[Hook - Obie Trice] (*echo*)
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all cats can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all niggas can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Motherfucker you can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all cats can't tell me shit

[Verse 3 - Obie Trice]
I done been homeless, no place to sleep
Moms don't wanna hear it, no place to eat
I pass out on my man's couch, just for a week
'Til he get fed up and kick a nigga to the street
Black out from cold, freezin my toes
Snow fuckin over my boots, my Tims' froze
Face turnin blue
Cars ridin by with the little children on the inside pointin at you
You done fucked over folks and they don't wanna see ya
Baby momma gotta new nigga with a Visa
Sleepin in cars, abandoned shit
And while the rats eat the wires, you be prayin and shit
Close to pneumonia, wishin for heat, like damn if only I came up in California
Plottin on a lick like, stickin your mans
Cause damn, you know he got at least a grand in his pants
Face lookin old, despite the fact you only 22 years old
Stuck in the cold, snot drippin profusely
Takin the alley routes, so my ex-cutie won't notice me

[Hook - Obie Trice] (*echo*)
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Y'all cats can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Now who the fuck gon' tell me shit?
Aiyyo, dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Motherfuckers can't tell me shit
Dope, jobs, homeless, I did it all
Motherfucker, I done did it all
