(Verse 1)
I don't fuck with you niggas you're all fake I don't see the point in your heart to ?
Ya you problematic on social media
Apologetic when approached greetin' ya
This is what the culture leadin' to
Yellow backs with jeans squeezin' their penises
And we supposed to receive them as rap geniuses?
Or we supposed to believe in what niggas feedin' us?
When they sweeter than Jujubes, Reese's Pieces

(Chorus)
Candy-coated niggas corroded the G-code
I don't give a damn how much coke that he sold
Cuz on the low look at him gropin' assholes
Am I the only nigga with his eyes closed
Guess so, fuck the rest you plus the dress you came in
Niggas is flamin' and I be steady aimin'
America won't try to bully me and China understanding
Fuck these lames man
I'mma talk truth to power, turn rap ? to flowers
RIP delusional cowards, lions to the youth they swallow us
Nigga talk truth 2 power, whether in the booth or outta
RIP delusional cowards, lions to the youth they swallow us


(Verse 2)
My heart goes out to Orlando
And every man and woman representin' that rainbow
The game I represent we don't switch them lanes though
This is hip hop. This not a flame show
My daughter listenin' while niggas grabbin' the ankles
So subconsciously this might ?
Yeah you can blame it on idiosyncrasies, I know your secrets lead
These sissies wearing it on their sleeves

(Chorus)
Candy-coated niggas corroded the G-code
I don't give a damn how much coke that he sold
Cuz on the low look at him groping assholes
Am I the only nigga with his eyes closed?
Guess so, fuck the rest you plus the dress you came in
Niggas is flamin' and I be steady aimin'
America won't try to bully me and China understanding
Fuck these lames man
I'mma talk truth to power, turn rap ? to flowers
RIP delusional cowards, lions to the youth they swallow us
Nigga talk truth 2 power, whether in the booth or outta
RIP delusional cowards, lions to the youth they swallow us
