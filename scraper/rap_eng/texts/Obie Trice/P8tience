[Verse 1: P8tience]
Keep me in your prayers ‘cause I’ve been drinking Stolis
Riding in a stoley, plotting on a kony
Stomach rumbling, stomach touching, I need to eat
I mean trouble, I’m seeing double, I need to sleep
Living amongst wolves, I’m riding with all demons
I’m just trying to find the way in, no Keenan
If I’m getting armed up, you’re catching it palms up
Chrome squeezing’s an orgy, niggas is all fucked

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
I’m from the gutter, I’m well aware of suffering
Two brothers, one ratchet, stuck hustling
No love for them, the fuzz, they want to cuff ‘em
Got to feed my loved ones, nigga, fuck ‘em
Clutching the sandwich bag, that’s where the candy at
Addicts rolling in wheelchairs, I serve ‘em handy cats
Thought that’s where my answer’s at, heartless and the [?]
Chasing baller dreams ‘til my carcass in that casket *blat*
Die before I open my eye
Nigga holding the pie, holding the soldier’s pride
‘Cause niggas just living ain’t being alive
If you ain’t feeling what I’m spitting then you’re living a lie
Patience, transition, it takes discipline
Decisions, only shit quakes nigga’s position
One day, you’re in the kitchen, the next, your flow’s sickening
I’m a eye witness, my nigga, is you listening?

[Verse 3: P8tience]
See I was broke, no fashion, gloves on the ratchet
When you was saying “cheers”, O, I ain’t had a glass to
Camera shy, the cannons we buy don’t have flashes
The next nigga out the hood trying to get to Mathis
Obie, give me that chance, I’ll kill for it
Feed the kids, put my face on the billboard
And I know you’re still trying to get a feel for it
But these other niggas, they ain’t got the zeal for it

[Verse 4: Obie Trice]
Sometimes, you’re too real for it
I know your frustration, I’ve been casing that for ages
Seems all the fake niggas taking their vacations
While we’re pushing freebase, facing incarceration
We ain’t floss hating, let the boys get paper
Be patient, yours is in the making
Loyalty never forsaken, lay and get your cake up
Prior breakup never turn Trice traitor
I cry ‘bout what life give ya, that’s your make up
Maybelline cover up your nature, cup up
By any means seem is our equation, fuck’s up
Is being mean until we hit it major, nut up

[Verse 5: P8tience]
Niggas see Pai, pay, it’s mayday, AK
SK, HK, put it in their face day
Drop ‘em in the crate day, leave ‘em by the lake day
Point me to your writers, I’m turning this Al-Qaeda
Nine stamps on the passport ‘cause I’m balling
Niggas calling me a bad sport
I got the answer for niggas who [?] making beef
And I’m turning this to mad cow season

[Outro: Obie Trice]
