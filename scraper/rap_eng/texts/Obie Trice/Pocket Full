R.I.P. my nigga B-I-G Notorious Big
Yeah get on my Big shit

US notes is all a nigga really aim for
Flipping coke is how I learned to make the change roll
Momma took my ass to the police for the leak
Too involved with the streets pushing the coca leaf
Chopping up onions in the dungeon
Me and P-Funk only a few niggas Obie roll with
Now I'm on some dumb shit all in South West
2000 dollar sack no burner no vest
Babymama stressed thinking I'm going to die to night
Fuck that, daughter need diapers… baby wipes
Only Kobie knew what her daddy had to do to pay for Air Jordan booties keep her in cute shoes
Nigga might make the news
Jakes steady chasing me
Raided my mom house
My fam can't face me
Saying I disgraced them
Serving up these junkies
Fuck…
I got a pocket full of honkies

[Hook]
5-0 will never catch that nigga O' with a pocket full of honkies
On the road nigga blowing dough I got a pocket full of honkies
Got a few, nigga trying to get more I need a pocket full of honkies
Trying to send a nigga sitting behind closed doors over a pocket full of honkies

How could I be racist
I love Green bills with white faces
Afford them nice places
Taking pictures on retreats
Pictures on the beach
Exotic eats
Lounging in Venice aquatic streets
Done with the partying I'm back up on my bullshit
Burner with the full clip
Niggas want to bullshit
Take a nigga ?Jewish? shit
Erase you with the tool quick
Place me in the ball pen
I'll lay you by the ball pit
Heavy since youth a nigga stayed in fucking trouble
Habitual felon fuck a CCW
Police got to catch him
Piece under the briefs
With a bad bitch sucking my dick named Al Tarees
House for lease
We going to move the fuck in it then
Turn it to the Carter, just like my nigga Nino and them
Assault rifles, banana clips for you monkies
Trying to stop me while I'm hungry
I got a pocket full of honkies!

[Hook]

Out here getting it for real
Coke is moving
We bought a house up on the hill
Party every night
Some homies is off the pill
Keep your head right when Vic's want us to squeal
Homie hit a left when he should of hit a right
When the hook out
Feds put the lights and then his wife stook out

(I just want to see my wife
I know where he get it at
He get a hundred of them things right there on Lauter St
I know where he get it at
I'll tell you everything)

Can't we all just get a mil
Without you niggas snitching like a bitch that copped a deal
Niggas want the life but ain't got the zeal
Nigga chose his wife over money get him killed
Like Frank White Trice jeans stay motherfucking filled
Some wrapped in ??silamil??

[Hook]
