[Verse 1]
Please pull the plug if the drugs are winning
Cause the high will keep your world spinning
Wasted time, thought about the high with fam
True the cash was there, and the stash was there
And I thought that Forever that the Wu was there
Wasted time, on hoes, pussy and clothes
I'm the Don of the rose, it's the life I chose
Baby Mamas are the worst, bitches don't even work
Yet the Coach bag matches with your hat and your skirt
So I slept for no reason, disappeared for seasons
Room may be padded, but damn, it's more easy
Beautiful girls tease me, they see the sleaze in me
But I'mma stay Dirty, accept the snake
No more will I waste the cake, no more will I run from Jake
No more will I make mistakes, no more will I waste the time

[Hook]
No more will you spit in my drink, no more will you poison me
I'mma climb real high, feel free with the thug inside
No more will I run and hide, wastin' time
No more will I taste the drugs, no more will I dodge the slugs
I'mma climb real high, feel free with the thug inside
No more will I run and hide, no more will I run and hide
No more will I waste the time

[Verse 2]
I walk on a dirty trail of cash and L's
Red Rose, you get high when I exhale
Jumped bail cause the judge promised my ass jail
West Coast couldn't hide me, the world's an audience
Passed out from the high like Martin Lawrence
Had me in the room next to Sarah Connor's
But my problem's much greater than any Terminator
Not one visit from fam, just letters from fans
Saying "Dirt keep ya head up and fuck getting wet up"
The Roc told me to sign on the dotted line
"Welcome home, Russell Jones, you've been wasting time
Rocked up a little, bling bling a little
Now every roach in the cracks wanna jump in the Ac
Every cat in the front gotta ride in the back
You freaks in the Ford, I ride a Cadillac
You freaks in the Ford, I ride a Cadillac
At last

[Hook]
