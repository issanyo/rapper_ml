[Intro]
Y'all no nothing 'bout the pimp game
I wanna thank Rick James for letting me do this song, thank you very much

[Verse 1]
Who are you? Girl, who do you belong to?
My point of view is, girl, I think you're hot
If we talk, what words will I describe
There's no dictionary book to explain how you look
Cause I think you're hot (Sexy, sexy, sexy)

[Hook]
Cold blooded!
Girl, I think you're hot (Sexy, sexy, sexy)

[Verse 2]
Who are you? Girl, what's your name and number?
Is it true? Girl, you think I'm hot
If we tried to get to know each other
You might find, you couldn't trade me for another
Cause I think you're so (Sexy, sexy, sexy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sweetheart baby, touch me girl where I wanna be touched
Don't ever complain, got ya in a cobra clutch
Love me tender, love me sweet
I wanna bust this nut in a superfreak
Oh, you're a superfreak, fuck me anywhere
You ain't scared to ever do a do or dare
I wanna undress you, hold your loosie tight
And I won't cum all night!

[Hook]
