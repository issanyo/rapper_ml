[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Dirty, ya'll niggas get the fuck up
I'm out of jail, nigga, I'm out of jail
What more, nigga, Dirty
Go and get the fuck out, I'mma pull
One of your muthafucka's eye, ahh, something
Dirt McGirt, muthafucka

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ya'll know who I am, what?
Dirt McGirt, baby, whose the man?
What part you fools don't understand
Been away now, I'm back by popular demand
Ain't a damn thing changed, nigga, back up
First nigga to act up, get smacked up
Orange suits on hand, Dirty this, Dirty that
Yo, where Dirty at? But now Dirty back
My girl is nasty, her booty is stank
I fucked her all night, until a nigga shoot blanks
Doggystyle, will never spill my drink
Then smoke a blunt, and watch the shit on tape
You can sit on my face, I like the taste
If my P.O. call, tell that bitch to wait
I break ya face, invade your space
Don't make the mistake, tell me who is in the place what?

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yeah, let me see you work something
Slow down, don't hurt nothing
You nasty, ain't ya? You freaky, ain't ya?
Get ya ass over here, shake it like ya just don't care
Now bounce-bounce, move it over here, now
Work, work, move it over here

[Young Chris]
History, I do her, then we split up
Lyon call, whenever, we ready to get up
I ain't never been hit up, with a line that's strong
Have a nigga fuck the shit up, with his love, that's wrong
Got a hell of a body, yeah, I love that tone
And god damn, I love that moan
There's just something about you, make a nigga stay all night long
My undercover freak the shit
It's cool, cuz her peeps was rich
So whatever I want covered, and she got my peeps' pitch right
So when I'm on the road, or a girl play the show
She can respect homebase, she play the codes
Nasty as she wanna be, shaking that ass right in front of me
Can't seem to keep her from up under me
And how I am, try'nna see if chirp gash
Shake it for the Gunnerz and Dirt, shh..

[Hook]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm dirty, just like the dirty south
I talk dirty, wash out my dirty mouth
I'm dirty, just like the dirty south
Talk dirty, wash out my dirty mouth
What, nigga? Why you wanna get me started?
Got me in the club with Tha Alkaholiks
On the down low, like I'm ducking the warrant
Getting head in the back by the bathroom toilet
There's beauty all around, let me see the performance
She down for whatever, you know I'mm all for it
Gotta spark hard, hoppin' sports bar
After this, it's the Marriot courtyard
Gold card, I'mma max it out
Just keep your titties shaking and the apples out
You can, stick around, honey, that's no doubt
Bust a nut, then I'm passing out
