Yo, I drop the single for yuh, yo, I drop the single for yuh

Come on, I want you to abuse me

Did you see me cut my dear (Did you see me bleed?)
And did you see my pain and fear (Taking over me)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Don't let the new shit shut your ass up and feel the uppercut
That'll make you fall to your what? (Kaboom)
Droppin the single on the charts
Lettin ya know, hey, the kid has heart
I never denied myself as being dope
But in my last, damn, niggas slept on my notes
Thought that I was weak? Huh, let me speak
Yo, all you over top (censored), I drop the single for yuh

[Chorus (x6) (with ODB's Single line mixed in)]
