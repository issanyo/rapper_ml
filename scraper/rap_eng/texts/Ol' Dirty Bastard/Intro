[Intro: Russell Jones (RZA)]
Ahh ahh, I never saw so many people tonight
I mean y'all all got it crowded up in here and that's good
I'm glad that y'all givin it up for him, y'all givin it up for him
That's good -- y'all make me want to cry or somethin
Alright ladies and gentleman, tonight is a special night
For one thing let me introduce myself my name is Mr. Russell Jones
Excuse me for that one I had to let that one low ahh-hahhh
And tonight, you're going to see something that you never seen before
Somethin that, that nobody in the history of rap ever set theyself to do
This fuckin guy, that I speak to you about, is somethin' crazy
He's somethin' insane, he's the greatest performer every-since
Uhh, what's the guys name? (Ol' Dirty!!)
Ahh, da, ahh, James Brown, he's bad, and he's a cool guy
And you'll really need him, I mean need to really get to know him
Ladies and gentleman, from all houses, to all towns
From the moons of Pluto, back down to earth
Ladies and gentleman, one more time, give it up for
The Old Dirty Doggy, I mean, the Ol' Dirty Bastard
I love that guy!
(Ol' Dirty!)

[Verse: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yes, how y'all doin' out there?
I wanted y'all to know that tonight is a special night
Cause I'm happy to be living, you know
A nigga tried to shoot me down and shit
You know and, I don't know man it just feel good to be here man
YouknowhatI'msayin?
And I wanna let all y'all know I love you man, I love all y'all
You know, but *sniff* but I really came here tonight *sniff*
For one reason *sniff*, just cause *sniff* I don't mean to cry
I don't mean to cry, dub you can play that shit man, play it man
I'm tired of this shit, remember the time I told y'all
When I got burnt, gonorrhea
Well this bitch, there's a new bitch goddamnit
Ohh, bitch burnt me again with gonorrhea
So I didn't get burnt one time I got burnt actually two times
When you really look at it
Yeah, I love the girl but I had to cut the bitch off
Yeah the bitch died, I killed the bitch
She suffered a long pain
But she had to go, bitch had to go
I I knew the bitch for ten minutes of her life
But the pussy was good! Yes the pussy was good!
I just want you to know girl!
That I dedicated, this song, well this song really was written by Blowfly
And I want all y'all to hear this shit
It's just a poem that I writ for you girl *paper crinkles*

*singing*
The first time, ever you sucked my dick - Thank you thank you!
I felt, the earth tremble, under my balls
Somethin' shot out of me real fast
First time

Nah I'm just kidding witch'all
How y'all feelin, listen to the album cuz it's BANGIN

[Outro: Sample]
We have only thirty-five chambers, there is no thirty-six
I know that, but, I want to create a new chamber
Oh? And what would that be?
