[Intro]
You got to know that she won't love you back
That she won't love you back like I can
She don't understand your body like I can
All she does is hold you back (Okay)

[Verse 1]
Girl, we are not the same
She don't wanna get involved like me
She won't accept the fault
She'll never take the fall
All of a sudden, you're making a change
Can't you tell that she's running that game?
You should know these players gon' play, play, uh huh huh

[Chorus]
You got to know that she won't love you back
That she won't love you back
(Won't love you, won't love you)
You got to know that she won't love you back like I can
(Won't love you, won't love you)
You got to know that I won't love you back
That I won't love you back 'cause I can't
(Won't love you, won't love you)
You don't understand my body like she can
And all you do is hold me back (Hold me back)

[Verse 2]
I'm so over getting over all these fools
That don't value my time
I'm so over getting over all of these losers
That don't nurture my mind
I get tired of the lies
I can see through your eyes, yeah
You can say, you can say what you want
But I still don't want you

[Bridge]
Ayy, I said hey
Baby, don't want your loving
I got me something, I said hey
I don't even want your money
I got my own thing, I said, bae
I'ma be fine without you, don't you worry
Don't you worry no more, no more

[Chorus]
You got to know that I won't love you back, love you back
(Won't love you, won't love you)
You got to know that I won't love you back 'cause I can't
You got to know that she won't love you back, love you back
You got to know that she won't love you back like I can
