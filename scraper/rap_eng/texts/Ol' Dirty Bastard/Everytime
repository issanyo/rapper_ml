[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Jon B.)]
Ooooh, yeah, Just Blaze, Jon B., Dirt McGirt

[Jon B.]
Somebody told me, you was in, major clothes
Or by yourself, so what's holding you back
And we can too be, closing in, cuz I would be
In your bed, oh, what you bringing girl

[Chorus: Jon B.]
You do it everytime, blow my mind
Let me show you why, can love tonight
You do it everytime, see you walk through my mind
Kinda thinking your fine, being a chip off some lies

[Jon B.]
So girl let's keep this going
Cuz I inside, will open wide, and I ain't shy
I'm just letting you know
That we can get it on til six in the morning
And you hottest tease, up in this joint
I'm asking please, girl, let's cut to the point
Is you what's keeping this going
I can feel you body telling me
Something... that's obvious to see, that you and me
Is you, just kiss you, your lips, I can't resist this
Kinda sick... the way that you fuck with my mind

[Chorus]

[Jon B.]
Everytime I see your face
It, really blows my mind
Baby show me, why I came out tonight
Gotta make a jumpoff tonight

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Alicia, Keyshia, Amber or Renee
No strings attached girl, I just wanna play
All y'all look like candy
Make you scream "awww" when I creep in your fantasy
Ain't no shame on a nigga, ain't no game
I'm just buggin' off your figure
Have a little Armadale, girl, take a swigger
You don't have to worry about the cost
When you pop off with the boss
Desires, keep my eyes, extra wide
Suprise, I'm a big boy, recognize
The broad, is what you are, by far
I'm wishing on a star, in my car
Body in the back, all up to the ceiling
Sexual healing, is what I'm feeling
You and me girl, we can rule the world
Or we can jump it off, jump it off!

[Chorus]

[Hook 4X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Get nasty, get crazy
Get nasty and just jump it off
