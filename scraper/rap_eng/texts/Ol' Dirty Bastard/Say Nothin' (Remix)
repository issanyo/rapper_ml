[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Omar)]
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo
No I ain't sayin' nothin' baby
No I ain't sayin' nothin' baby (Baby baby ba ba baby)
No I ain't sayin' nothin' baby
Yes I ain't sayin' nothin' baby
(Yay yay, moo moo..)

[Omar]
What's with you I want to know
Your inner self is starting to show
Speak your mind in the best way
Don't want to waste your time another day
No matter how hard I fall, nothing ever seems to change
Whenever I hear you call, I come running just the same

[Chorus: Omar (background singers) {Ol' Dirty Bastard}
If you say nothin' (Say nothin')
Want nothin' (Want nothin') want nothin' from me
Please Don't waste my time
I said somethin' (Said somethin')
Wanted somethin' (wanted Somethin') for you
Now your wasting my time
If you know cause I wanted {Yo yo yo yo}
Don't put me down cause I want it
Don't put me down cause I need it

[Omar (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
I don't know just what to say
I know my mouths is gonna run away
Can't you please excuse my mood
I ain't gonna go out my way to being rude no, no, no
Eveyday is a day that is wasted trying to make a change yeah
That just like seas trying to change the places with time and space
(Sing this)

[Hook: Omar (background singers) {Ol' Dirty Bastard}]
You say nothing (Say nothin')
Want nothin' (Want Nothin') Want nothin' from me
Please don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
I said somethin' (I said somethin')
Wanted somethin' (I wanted somethin')
I think It's for you to respect me
{Yo Yo Yo Yo}[--Ol' Dirty Bastard
(Don't waste my time no)
{No I ain't sayin' nothin' baby}

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo yo Omar
Check it, CIA told me not to say nothin'
About Biggie and 2Pac, life's a little somethin'
Whenever there's no witnesses
You know the government had to do with this
Eighty six churches got burnt, no witnesses
Guess I'm next on the hitlist
They tried to kill me three times
Same Osirus from the type of God, brought forth the people refined
I'mma start hittin' the schools
Teachin' my children about the devil without the God within
You thought they was dead BIG and Pac lived in me
I know all you sick human families
I mastered all you human lessons kid
Takin' my photograph tryin' to manipulate my negative
The raws and R's will do far, Omar
I'm not sayin' nothin', the black kid is God

[Hook: Omar (background singers)]
You say nothin' (Say nothin')
Want nothin' (Want nothin') Want nothin' from me
Please don't waste my time
I said somethin' (I Said Somethin')
I wanted somethin' (I Wanted somethin') for you
Please don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
You say nothin' (Say nothin')
Want nothin' (Want nothin') from me
Please don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
I said somethin' (I said somethin') Did somethin'
Wanted somethin' (Wanted somethin') for you
I wanted somethin' for you
Please don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
I'm sayin' nothin', wanted nothin' from me
Please don't waste my time
