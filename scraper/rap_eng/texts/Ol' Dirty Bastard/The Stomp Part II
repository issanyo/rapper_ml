[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Dirt, Dirt, Dirt...
Dirt, Dirt, Dirt...
That's what I'm talking about

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Soon as she slurp the mic, here comes the herpes light
People at church be like, friends, at work be like
She is the thirsty type, a nigga McGirt be like
Look, it ain't workin' right, it will convert my life
Now she's an earthly type, pure, and worthy type
Catch her in early nights, smile with pearly whites
Sippin' Bacardi's like, she's back in perverted life
You know how these birds be like, that's why you can't treat them right
My brother he eats it right, cheat, and beat his wife
Ike and Tina fight, this Medina life
The crack and nina like, block and fiending like
Cop subpeona like, giants and beams of light

[Hook: RZA (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Stomp, stomp, stomp! (Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, that's what I'm talking 'bout)
Let, me, see/(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt), you, stomp, stomp, stomp!

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Things ain't the same today, this is the game they play
Dirt, the name, they say, throwin' the blame my way
So they can change my face, take and claim my space
But I remain the ace, always maintain a space
Coke, the 'caine, the base, Henny without the chase
Then it come out to lace, pussy all in my face
You know where the Dirt be at, where the skirts be at
Money and work be at, pull and squirt the mac's
You fake aristocats, where your pistol at?
Weak ballistic caps, I'm firing missiles back

[Hook: RZA (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
(That's what I'm talking 'bout)
Let, me, see/(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt), you, stomp, stomp, stomp! (Dirt, dirt, dirt)
Let, me, see/(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt), you, stomp, stomp, stomp!

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Three years, I'm out the gate, waiting, my clients deflate
(What, what) chain plate, bitch, I'm goin' state to state
Bitch, I sniff them eights, muthafucka, make these papes
Watch that ho get raped, nigga, I'm going ape
This is part two, the Stomp, you niggas in the slump
Uzi's all in my trunk, nigga, you hear the thump
Fill you with holes and lumps, rocks all in my fronts
Cock and feel the Monk, pussy everyday of the month
Do what the fuck I want, bitches, you shake your rump
Niggas you ain't no comp, let me see you jump

[Hook: RZA (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Stomp, stomp, stomp! (Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, that's what I'm talking 'bout)
Let, me, see/(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt), you, stomp, stomp, stomp!
(Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, McGirt) get, the, fuck, off, your, ass, nig-ga!
Stomp, stomp, stomp! (That's what I'm talkin' bout!)
Let, me, see, you, stomp, stomp, stomp!
Get, the, fuck, off, your, ass, nig-ga!
Stomp, stomp, stomp!
