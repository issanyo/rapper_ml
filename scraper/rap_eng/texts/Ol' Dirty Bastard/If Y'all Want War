[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Royal Flush, Dirt McGirt
And we don't give a fuck whose in here tonight
Somebody's gon' get shot, bastards!

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Royal Flush)]
If ya'll want war (ya'll want war?)
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Cuz we don't care (ya'll know we don't care)
Where ya'll from (wherever ya'll from)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, you go one shot, two shot, three shot, four
That's how I'm soundin' when I'm shootin' down your door
Five shot, six shot, seven shot, eight
That's for all them niggas, that I catch at the wait
Nine shot, ten shot, eleven shot, twelve
Them four shots, gonna keep me outta jail
I be, damned if I fail, BK know me well
And take your precint to war, before I take a fall

[Hook 2X: Royal Flush]
Y'all don't really wanna fuck with us
Cuz you know we gon' shoot shit up
Don't waste bullets on your house and truck
Wait til' we see you, then we hit you up

[Hook 2X]

[Royal Flush]
And I ain't got no time, to talk to none of ya'll niggas
You tough, then you get shot, you turn to snitchers
And them niggas that you runnin' with, become your witness
Man, I'm good with my aim, dog, I hit you from a distance
No, look, this is the difference, like special ed., you on a mission
Too eager to glisten, when your mom talked you should of listened
Take out the trash, do the dishes, now she gotta bury a son
Got hit with a gun, just convicted homicide

[Hook]
