Verse:
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodgers, Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang Killerrr Bees on a swarm!
Rain on ya college ass, disco dorm!
When you didn't even touch my skill
You gotta have the one Killer Bee and he ain't gonna kill. Now
Chop that down, pass it all around!
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground!
For any MC in any 52 states
I gets psycho killerrrr Norman Bates!
My producer slam, my flow is like bam!
Jump on stage, and then I dun-daaaah!

[I like the way you come]

Ooh, baby, I like it rawww...
Yeah baby, I like it RAWWW!!!
Ooh, baby, I like it raww...
Yeah baby, I like it RAWWW!!!
