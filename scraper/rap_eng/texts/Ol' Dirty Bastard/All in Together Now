The chamber of this banger, is 36th chamber
Understand Equality Slang, that of Allah's name
Played the rabbit, like you dead
Mork from Ork, first take support see me in The Source
Yo I take the eighty-five percent brain
Cause Black makes what makes rain
Dirty brain is like payday to me
GOD unique baby
Who's the Five Percent of the planet Earth
Tell em Poppa Wu, well it sure ain't Poppa Smurf
Got to check your blood, take you to church
Ministers down with the nerds
Ever since birth
White man always trying to take the Black man's turf
Black man built America
I named you after Asia, you ain't my Momma
Now her name is Erika, Bo Derek-ah
What, you like that slave name
It wasn't 'posed to sound better
New Wu order, New Rule order
For all the maniacs in jail read this letter
Be behind me when I'm making this cheddar
Cause I'mma make it more better for our babies
Cause they play in the same schoolyards everyday
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

You've, got, that WHITE WHITE WHITE WHITE
White man clock on your wall
I'm tired of gettin up goin to work
For that white, white, white, white man y'all
I's got a bad boss
These thoughts was fucking Diana Ross
I ain't no ??, making this money
Nuh, show yourself
Whitey come on, get the money
My Father Allah walk with Gods
Just like the dollar bill walk with God We Trust
And I walk this dog, two-thousand two-hundred miles for you
What, let the ?? know it's done
Hey blackie, yo whitey
It's all, all, all in together now
We getting paid getting dressed for the weather now
All, all, all in together now
We getting paid gettin dressed for the weather now
All, all in together now
Getting paid getting dressed for the weather now
All in together now
We're getting paid getting dressed for the weather now, peace

It's all in together now
New World Order baby, knahmsayin
Y'all recognize it's together
You understand me, it's the Dirt Dog speaking
My word is bond and my bond is life
It's all in together now my niggas and my niggarettes
My peoples don't worry about it
It's all slang from the same gang
I'm black out, and I'm black in
I'm white out, and I'm white in, so what
