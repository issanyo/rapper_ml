[Intro: Ol Dirty Bastard]
"When the east is in the house" Jeru the Damaja (sample) Oh my god! (2X)
Yo East New York in this muthafucka, Blahzay Blah in this muthafucka
Brooklyn in this muthafucka, Dirt Dog in this muthafucka, it's on point
Come on baby let me jump, let me see you body rhythm pump
Come on baby let me see you go, let me see you, like go, go, go

[Outloud]
Aiyo, my timin' is so precise, gangsta all my life
I don't get get robbed, I control the heist
Cold as ice, still mountin' this whole device
Life's a gamble, so I roll the dice
I tamed up, still I'm up and coming
Auto start, put on my sneaks, truck is running
Bad broads, that's beyond Beyonce
Eatin' on my body like a dinner at entree
What ya'll critics gonna say, don't even risk it
Forget Pillsbury, eat this Blah Blah biscuit
Ya'll watered down the game, man, like bar liquor
It's nothin' for me, I just buy the bar quicker
Oh my God, nigga, I'm in the house, and I'm rowdy
He been doin' this since five thousand on an Audi
Remember "Danger!" Yo, ya'll know Blah
This is grown under water, ya'll ain't even in my sonar

[Hook: Outloud (Ol' Dirty Bastard sample)]
The east is in the house like (danger)
About to, turn it out like "Oh My God" (danger)
Put the barrel in your mouth like (danger)
I see the dipper through a blouse, it's "Oh My God" (danger)
Me and Dirty on the floor like (danger)
Me and Dirty pimpin' ho's like "Oh My God"

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
So then you act like you love my little baby
And you know that I act a little crazy
Come on baby let me jump, let me see your body rhythm pump
Come on baby let me see you go, let me see you, like go, go, go
I'm on the streets lingo, spendin' the spingo
Eazy-E lingo, doin' the dango, the vet' don't wear Kangol
I dare pump my shit, at the club, actin' strange, yo
Smack ya'll niggas in the face, yo
Got wiggas in the place, yo, block party in this muthafucka
I'm the only round actin' like sucka, sucka bitch ass puffer
So don't play this muthafucka, or watch you bird clucker
So don't let yourself break yourself
With the sip and tumble, that will take yourself
I move with that heat that smoke you in your head, man
The shit war, time to take, man, take man

[Hook 2/3]

[Outro: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Come on baby let me jump, let me see your body rhythm pump
Come on baby let me see you go, let me see you, like go, go, go
