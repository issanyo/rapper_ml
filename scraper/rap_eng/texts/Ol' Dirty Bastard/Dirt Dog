[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
C'mon, fuck that shit
{*panting hard seven times*}
Yo bitches out there, a-throw your hands in the air
To my niggas out there (out there)
Throw your guns in the air (one two three)
Let me hear you go - Dirt, Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
Let me hear you go - Dirt, Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
(Ahhhhh) Let me hear you go..
NO!

Never been branded, no dough shorthanded
This is why the Dirt Dog landed
And I expanded - from the help of the RZA
Shit that NUH commanded
I'm a project ho, LOVE project ho
Nigguh get BUST, at the front door
(I do) I don't don't don't, I don't don't
I don't got no love for the pro, the prostitute pro
The Brooklyn Zu know, I be like Old Joe
*pbbbbbbbbbbt* See me at the cocaine sto'
Coppin a.. eh ehh ehh.. and coppin mo'
See I'm a real nigga, give a bitch a car
Bitch want a Jeep, give a bitch a star
Bitch wanna sleep, number one..
.. umm, number one, I live in my momma house
Number one, I live in my momma house
This a Ol' Dirty Bastard production, let off SHOTS!
Be hot like I fart from a bitch's twat
I'm just a small boy, well known like Elroy
Well employed
Chest built up like steroids, electra master
Puppeteer motherfuckers
You can't control the black man's God!!!
Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh, bluh, Bed-Stuy
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-Dirtiest place to be
You white Flintstone, bitch
You stickin your dick in my gravel pit
Journey to the center of the Earth
The white woman tryin to slide up in
I'm the Granddaddy Man from the Senegal clan
Got the bite of a pit, keep your afro simmerin
Nigga GUARD YOUR GROUND!
(GUARD YOUR GROUND!)

Ah-throw your hands in the air
To my niggas out there, throw ya guns in the air
Let me hear you go Dirt, Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
Let me hear you go Dirt, Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
Let me hear you go Dirt, Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
Let me hear you go Dirt, Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
Let me hear you go Dirt, Dirt Doooooooog!
(I feel you penetrating through my body)
Dirt, Dirt Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
Let me hear you go Dirt, Doooooooog!
Dirt, Doooooooog!
Let me hear you go..
