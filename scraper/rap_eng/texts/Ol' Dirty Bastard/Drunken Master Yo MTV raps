Drunk as can be
I am the drunken master style
You see nobody can ever touch me
Nobody can ever feel me
Nobody can ever say that he loves me or she loves me
She is a blessing on this earth nigga like the sun. raw
You see sometimes when the lyrics gotta come out
Make the ladies want scream and shout
Thoughts be amazed handcuts is played
Never wore other ?
Stormbrainiac
To the holy ghost taxism dusting ya
Call me your neighborhood ghostbusta
Obviously you know my name by now
Throw stupid parties all through your town unique or live or selected
Panic will erupt you'll be infected I break mc's down into syllables
Hold it back till ya rhymes one syllable ?
