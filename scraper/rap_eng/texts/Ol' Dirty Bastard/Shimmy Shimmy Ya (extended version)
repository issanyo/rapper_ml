Intro:

Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww
Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww

Verse One:

Shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam shimmy ya
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge bom-voyage
Yeah from the home of the doge brooklyn scwad
Wu-Tang killer bee's on a swarm
Rain on your collage ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that downpass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any em-cee in any fifty two states
I get psycho, killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bamm
Jump on stage ah then I dip doown

(I like the way you talk)

Chorus: repeat 2X

Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww
Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww

See, when a nigga say he likes it raw
He means dirty, down to the floor
See my name is the Ol'DB and I'll beat your ass

For the ladies who know me tell them who the fuck I be
For the niggas who know me tell them who the fuck I be
My style comes down on ya'll like rocks

Umm by the flock
By the creak by the flock
Got east coast locked down padlocked
My sulu be all all down by the flock
