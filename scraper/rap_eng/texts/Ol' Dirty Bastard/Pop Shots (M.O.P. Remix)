[Intro: DJ Premier] + (ODB samples)
Rest in peace, Ol' Dirty

"The-the-the-the-the Ol' Dirty Bastard"
"Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang"
"Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella"
"Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang"

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard w/ samples cut]
As I pooooooooooop, shotttttttttttttttttts
As I po-a-oooooop, shotttttttttttttttttts

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Eighty-six was the year that it started
Crack hit the states, and my hood got to poppin
Back then, you had to catch it with narcotics
Without a doubt, Brooklyn had the hardest projects
Nowadays, if a nigga say you got it
You'd be sittin in the county with like 3 or 4 charges
Young I started, but I had a talent
To get this crack cooked, cause I took it as a challenge
So older niggas gave me much as I can handle
Copped the Eagle, started jackin with the green New Balance shit
I'm feelin clean, I was only thirteen
With the heavy starch, on my Bugle Boy Jeans
My name spelled out on my four finger ring
It was Dirt then, cause McGirt you ain't seen

"The Ol' Dirty Bastard"
"Rollin...."

[Hook] - repeat 2X w/ more samples scratched in

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Toe to toe, I scrapped with the best
If I spit ten rhymes, nigga nine gon' connect

[Lil' Fame] + (Ol' Dirty)
Crime time, one-seven-one-eight Marxmen
Chill Dirty I got this (Tell 'em who the fuck Iiii BE!)
F-I, Z, Z-Y
Famesta bitch; duke you ain't heard, you fuckin with
Weird Al Yankovich, Brook-nam bangers
See y'all niggas still boppin to bullshit, that ain't the shit
Shame on a nigga that tried to run game on a nigga
Then, tuck in his chain on a nigga
I thought you used to pop that thang thang on a nigga
And air blocks out like bang bang on a nigga
You pussy! Fuck the shit you talkin duke
Cause everybody can smell it when yo' punk ass walkin duke
Get it right, it's the Ol' Dirty Bastard
With them old dirty bastards, from Brownsville (motherfucker)

"Tell 'em who the fuck I be..."
"The ODB"
"Tell 'em who the fuck I be..."
"The-the-the Ol' Dirty Bastard"

[Hook] - repeat 2X w/ more samples scratched in

"Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang"
"Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella, Roc-a-Fella"
"Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang"
"See my name is the ODB"

[Hook] - repeat to fade w/ more samples scratched in
