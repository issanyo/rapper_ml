[Intro]
My beats are slamming

[Verse 1]
My beats are slamming from the rugged programming
My man Bob Marley hey my man I'm jamming
You could never touch the stamina, while I'm ramming the
Hip-hop crowd makes me rrrah rrrah rrrah
Other MC's got flipped with the ease
Begging me for burnt cigar, stop the music please
No cause I'm a pro, rap to the convo
Make a crowd say ho, at a strip show
Represent, my name is Ason keep calm
Rhyme's too smoky, funky like a stink bomb
Boom, blowing up niggas better than pulling the trigger
So you betta run for cover
Niggas better loosen they ass, felt the glass
A forty ounce bottle, yo yo yo money yo pass
Woooh-woooh-woooh, I sweat it live
Is he gonna live doc?, no the nigga dies
The max-imum of MC's are populating
The min-imum of those MC's are dominating
Now all and together now, to what what who
Rhymes come stinky like a girl's poo-poo

[Hook]
Hippa to da hoppa and you just don't stoppa (2x)

[Verse 2]
Ahh shit, here I go once again
Rhymes get shitty from the time that I spend
I come old like toe fungus mold
Ask my grand-pop pop duke gave my soul
Then I came with that old Al Green shit
Saaa-die, taught me the ballistic
I get you blurry in your eye with a high note
Down, to the Brownsville, oops you got smoked
The shit I'm dropping is stinking up your area
When I shoot it through like a messenger carrier
I keep my breath smelling like shit so I can get
Funky baby I'm not having it

[Hook x4]

[Outro]
The Hellfire style!
(Sound of dragon breathing fire) Dragon Fist!
(Sound of horse neighing and running.) Horse Fist!
Bastard, I didn't know who you were!
