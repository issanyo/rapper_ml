[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby, I'm about to explode...

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
It's Dirty Run, when you see me coming high
Nine times out of ten, don't wonder how
It's Dirty Run, it's Dirty Run, no more vacancies
I'm a minute from feeling no sympathy
When you see me coming high
It's nine times out of ten, you will wonder how
It's Dirty Run, it's Dirty Run -- "Run" --
I'm a minute from feeling no sympathy

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Bitches be actin' like they so damn fine
That's why I fuck 'em at the drop of a dime
Needle dick niggas, go fuck a needle
Before I squash a John Lennon, like a Beetle
Dirt McGirt, Mr. McGirt to the hoes
Stinkin' rich, cover your mouth and your nose
Man of my codes, it's old man, dig it?
Sometimes rockin' went, and Dirty might kick it
Damn, your takers, that's the type to flight
To get any more suck, how niggas dick through a flint
Big pimp, watch the fur drag
A hundred lick, hundred lick, hundred lick fabulous
Bring it like a bus full of travelers
Turn it up so the cops will get mad at us
Swear to God, we're the trouble, you imagine us
Cuz the news only exploit the bad in us
When, turn it down a little
Cuz the ground is startin' to crack a little

[Hook]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Diamond, baby, name the time and place
When your legs get tired, you can sit on my face
And touch me, tease me, feel me, caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go, baby I'm about to explode..
Take that bitch for bite, my name Dirt Dog not cake with ice, bitch
Fuck bitin', when there's so much pussy
If you ain't into ass, then pimp 'em for the cash
Come quick, turn the camera on
So whose that rippin' off your mama's thong?
Dirty, creep out your back door, nigga
With my shoes untied, zippin' up my zipper

[Hook]
