{*car tires squealing, car crashes*}
{*some screams, "ahhhhhhhhhhhh!"*}

[Kool Keith]
Yeah..
Right down the aisle
Kool Keith and the Ol' Dirty for Mankind

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yeah.. yeah..
And this is gonna be done, with everything

[Kool Keith]
2000 texture, rhymin' with Ol' Dirty
With my New York Jets jersey
Left lineman comin' in like Mankind
With diamonds sparklin' around my rhymes
Black Levi suits, skully caps and boots
Wigs with Grecian Formula
Got us warnin' ya
With backslaps, we put on, mack caps
Sit in V.I.P. with blind man lookin like Stevie
We nasty, sittin' next to Regis and Kathie
Front row seats with Blowfly
The crowd is so high
Tickets with popcorn, we rock born
No circus here, just horses and a unicorn
Tuxedos and taxis, we roll with leather maxis
Catch the back breeze
Gypsy cabs burn rubber
Signin' autographs for Danny Glover
Donny Osmond and Dennis Rodman
Up in a empty furniture apartment
With Mexicans maids, rubbin' the spots out the carpet
We move and face our targets

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Punch, kick, fight - bite
Whatever you do, just kick {his fuckin} ass!
Cause I'm much different from, the other MC's
Cause I got the amazin, abilities
I can rock on the mic, so you can have a ball
I can fly through the air - stick to the wall
I can take a punch, or get hit by a car
I can go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact, that's what I wanna talk about
How I went outer space, just to be in the house
Punch, kick, fight - bite!
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round
Punch, kick, fight - bite!
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round
Punch, kick, fight - bite!
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round

[Kool Keith]
With backsprings
Nobody seen the girls pee on the mattress
Who was the actress when we had to take a leak?
I was in the station wagon listenin' to Canibus
We're basketball with glasses
Lookin' like Kurt Rambis
Ridin' the turnpike to Paramus
Drinkin' a box of Tropicanas with this dumb-ass nigga
Drivin' the green Bonneville from Indiana
At a truck stop
The state trooper made me turn down the hip-hop
I got out and vomicked on the ragtop, super eggdrop
UHAHHHH!  Pass me the towel
Was it McDonald's?  I'ma sue Ronald

Punch, kick, fight
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round
Punch, kick, fight
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round
Punch, kick, fight
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round
Punch, kick, fight

[OD] Punch, kick, fight - bite
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round
[OD] Punch, kick, fight - bite
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round
[OD] Punch, kick, fight - BITE!
[KK] Kick his ass downtown - first round
[OD] Punch, kick, fight - BITE!!
[OD] Whatever you do KICK HIS {FUCKIN} ASS!!!
