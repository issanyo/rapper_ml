[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I dedicate this to all the pretty girls
All the pretty girls in the world
And the ugly girls too
‘Cause to me you're pretty anyway, baby

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
You give me your number, I'll call you up
You act like your pussy on interrupt
I don't have no trouble with you fucking me
But I have a little problem with you not fucking me
Baby, you know I'ma take care of you
‘Cause you say you got my baby, and I know it ain't true
Is it a good thing? No it's bad, bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch
So I walk on over with my Cristal
Bitch-ass niggas, put away your pist-als
Dirty won't be having it in this house
‘Cause, bitch, I'll cripple your style!
Now that you heard my charming voice
You couldn't get another nigga, coochie won't get moist
If you wanna look good and not be bummy
Girl, you better give me that money! Aow!

[Hook: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
So I glanced at the girls, girls glanced at me
I whispered in their ear: "Wanna be with me?"
You wanna look pretty though, in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know
Just dance if you caught up in the holy ghost trance
If you stop I'ma put the killer ants in your pants
I'm the O-D-B as you can see
F.B.I., don't you be watching me
I don't want no problems, ‘cause I'll put you down
In the ground where you can not be found
I'm just Dirt Dog trying to make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey!
Radios play this all day, everyday
Recognize I'm a fool and you love me!
None of you, NUH, better look at me funny
NUH, you know my name, now give me my money!

[Hook: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

[Over the hook]
Sing it! Sing it, girls!
Just shake it right now!
If Dirty want his money
I think y'all should give him his money
That's how I like you, girl!

[Verse 3: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Nigga playing in the club like this all night
Bitches put your ass out, let me hold it tight
You looking at my wrist saying "It's so nice!"
The price bitch is diamonds, shining disco light
Well, you better help me solve my problem
Or I'ma get this money and rob them
Lucky Dog when I won the Lotto
Ran up on my car for carrying Rollo
But hold on, you can call me Dirty
And then lift up your skirt
And you want some of this Dirty
God made Dirt and Dirt bust your ass
Stop annoying me! Yeah, I play my music loud
It takes the Bastard – Ol' Dirty – to move the crowd
They say, "He had his dick in his mouth."
Eddie Murphy taught me that back in the house
Now give me my money!

[Hook: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

[Hook: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

[Hook: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

[Hook: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

[Hook: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
Baby, I got your money

[Outro: Kelis]
Hey, Dirty!
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey!
