[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's...
Yeah, check this shit out
Know what I'm sayin'? This is dedicated to all my hoes
Know what I'm sayin'?
All my babies' mothers, know what I'm sayin'?
All my bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Let me tell a motherfucker something
Ya'll motherfuckers want this money, bitch?
You better earn this motherfuckin' money

[Pre-verse]
Bitch, let me show you somethin'
My name Dirt Dog, bitch, ain't no frontin'
Bitch, let me show you somethin'
My name Dirt Dog, bitch, ain't no frontin'
Bitch, let me show you somethin'
My name Dirt Dog, bitch, ain't no frontin'
Aaah!

[Verse 1]
Walkin' down the street, dark, dark night
Saw a pretty girl, bitch caught my sight
Bitch, so fine—fine as can be
Bitch, you know you belong to me
Drove over, said, "How you be?"
Bitch, you know my name Dirt Dog, dirt MC
"Dirt Dog—I know what you about."
"Bitch, get the fuck in the car!" Drove her to my house
Aaaah, to my house
Open the door, take off your clothes
Throw her on the floor, took off my clothes
Showed her my dick, "Bitch, dis somethin' that you'll never forget."
On the first pump she started to scream
On the second pump she thought she had a bad dream
On the third pump she started to cry
"Dirt Dog, I don't wanna die!"
"Just, shut the fuck up!"
Pussy ain't nothin' but the skin of ya bone
You can fuck it, you can suck, you can leave it alone
25 cents is the regular price
50 cent, you can fuck it twice
75 cent, you can fuck it to the bone
And a dollar' worth—leave it alone!
