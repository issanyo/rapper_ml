[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, I got love for you girls
All my Sweet Sugar Pies
This is dedicated to you

[Verse 1: Royal Flush]
Hey baby what's your name? Look at your whole frame
Compliment me on my chain, she bling it so I did the same
Where we goin' from here? Lets smoke and drink in Belvedere
Askin' me about my peers, where I been for all these years
Starin' at my car yeah, notice money round here
Please baby show your speed, nuff talk about me
Where you work? What's your hobby?
Married, or got kids to some bonnie
Famous for karate
What's your number, call you probably
Waited for a week ot two, didn't see what we gon' do
Came through, new car XL on them 22's
Knock and marry, straight to her I wanna hit it badly
Then she startin' barkin', said "first we gotta get married"
I hate this bitch, all I wanna do is hit the nappy
Gassed her head up, tell her anything tha make her happy
Straight to the hotel, she suck dick and fuck well
Asked me for my house number, I gave her Ol' Dirty's cell

[Hook]
When I'm sippin' on the henny, make me wanna fuck
Wanna fuck, wanna fuck
When I'm thinkin' of them bitches I don't fall in
Love, fall in love, fall in love
All I ever do is get high and fuck, bust some nut, bust some nut
ODB and Royal Flush don't give a fuck, bitches what?

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
If a girl is a slut, with a hole in her butt
Who used to be a meaty-bone puppy cow little mutt
Came to my house smellin' like trout
I said, "Doggie doggie get the fuck out!!"
Let me tell you about the rash from the neck
It's enough to put the ring around the collar in check
She's nothin' but a bitch other known as a witch
With an irritating itch from trying to switch
Strung out ass, foggin' up glass
Tellin' all the niggas tell that the bitch first class
Smoke a bag of hash from all the shit she stashed
First she had to play the collar just to made that cash
Pull down her panties then scratch that rat
Tear up the whiff, that appear [?]
Tryna get slayed, got the Tabernacle Prayer
The only thing holy was her shitty underwear

[Hook]
When I'm sippin' on the henny, make me wanna fuck
Wanna fuck, wanna fuck
When I'm thinkin' of them bitches I don't fall in
Love, fall in love, fall in love
All I ever do is get high and fuck, bust some nut, bust some nut
ODB and Royal Flush don't give a fuck, bitches what?

[Verse 3: Royal Flush]
Head anytime I want it, C-O 600
World my state stuttin', girls come in diamond dozen
Fuck hard, niece and cousins, doin' what your niggas wouldn't
Fattin' like the white guttin', 85 I put my foot in
Buck Scotties still pimpin', stay puttin' long dick in
White pussy our commission, hit it while you when out fishin'
Dog I be fuckin' bitches, while you be duckin' stitches
And don't think cause I'm a mack I won't buck at bitches
Mad cause my chain is bigger, rims look a little thicker
Lifetstyle's alot richer, you actin' like low hitchin'
Get a heater on my strippers, maybe y'all gon' hit it
No rhymin', dance in a minute
Cause everybody that I popped tonight at least had 3 E's in it..
3 E's in it

[Hook]
When I'm sippin' on the henny, make me wanna fuck
Wanna fuck, wanna fuck
When I'm thinkin' of them bitches I don't fall in
Love, fall in love, fall in love
All I ever do is get high and fuck, bust some nut, bust some nut
ODB and Royal Flush don't give a fuck, bitches what?
When I'm sippin' on the henny, make me wanna fuck
Wanna fuck, wanna fuck
When I'm thinkin' of them bitches I don't fall in
Love, fall in love, fall in love
All I ever do is get high and fuck, bust some nut, bust some nut
ODB and Royal Flush don't give a fuck, bitches what?
