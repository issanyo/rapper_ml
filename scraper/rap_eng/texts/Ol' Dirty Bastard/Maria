[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (woman)]
(You my Dirty whore, you that Dirty whore)
What else you gonna do to it
But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it
Who else, who else is gonna do it
This is dedicated to all you bitches

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Knew this bitch named Trash, she had a hella fine ass
Can't ask, blew my hope in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhoea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you should have seen her
She had a baby face creamer Purinas, called up talking Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon, I had her walking on the Moon

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
I seen you at the five and dime wasting your time
Oh you shine, I'm looking at your ass from behind
You walked by smelling like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swelling
My nuts start yelling, excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you
Fantasy, after that we can cheat
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat Long stroke smacking, smack it then broke
Nothing can't stop my continuous poke
Compound, porno flick music
Daddy came with it when I wrote it

[Verse 3: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Dirt Dog be bouncing on bitches like frog
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peeping this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy
Dirt Dog ain't choosy, pussy move me
Pretty black dick up in the booty, I like it muddy and swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fucking room me and my momma in my teepee
Blackberry squeeze, bitch you a tease
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese
Now to blow fifty G's overseas
I'm doing the breeze, in my 850

[Verse 4: RZA]
Suicidal, she been in more hotels than bibles
Idol worshipping bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Strung on how the bitch manoeuvred her tongue
From the top of his dick to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick, this wicked bitch was a harlot
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy, fucked for a movie and a loose leaf cigarette
Pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons, big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggas sinning against their women
And enjoyed to watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void
And shameless, her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list
Her obsession caused niggas to get the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had Urinary Tract Infection
I tried to warn 'em and bomb 'em, but she conned em
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

*woman moans* oooooh, ahahhh, ohh

[Outro: '4 Assassins' samples]
You people are all trying to achieve the impossible
That's exactly what we've done
But you'll fail and you'll all die
If we die, the next generation will fight them too
And the one after them for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed
