[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yeah, now we're gonna give a shout out, knowumsayin'?
Def Jam, knowumsayin'?
Niggas like Method Man, Redman
Say all the artists here, knowumsayin'?
Bacon Lot, knowumsayin'?
I don't need no introductions, Cat
Whuuuuut

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm sittin' in my west, I'm analyzin' thoughts
I'm sippin' off a quart that I just had bought
I'm thinkin' of the moment, things soar in that head
I feel assurin' durin', also glad
Yes, feel assured by knowin' I won
Cuz there's no one who can fuck wit A-Sun
I'm not bein' pushy but I'm born to boss
Unique Ason, oh yes, well of course
Don't see the riot, everyone keeps quiet
If you don't believe nigga, get hyper and try it
Yes it is me, a total fresh MC
Yo, I'm born to be, MC history
Rhyming on time because that's the deal
You're only as fresh as your ass feel
Other MCs, you are bound to fall
'Cause your real world is not a world at all

[Hook: Streetlife]
Drunken Master, styles causin' street disaster
Blaze cut faster than a fairy slasher
Tai-chi, Kung Fu fighting, ODB
Hands quick as lightenin', technique too deadly
Iron fist blew the pawn, switch styles like lay long
Let's get it on, heavy chow broke, it's not 'bout
Shadow boxin', better punch, you need oxygen, try again
When you catch the second wind, I'll break you in

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Approach the mic slow, it's about to blow
One foot crow crane, anti-chain movement
Restore the ming, some take this thing for joke
Serious men deep in thought, misunderstood, held the fork
He's too defensive, too mean, you didn't, now it's a scene
These cats over here got Glock holdin' him down
These niggas scheming, I'm seeing everything
Ten steps ahead, on the wall smokin' my
Agent high told best friend of the wine

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Still drunk off a cheap wine
Holdin' front lines, niggas wanna front, fine
Fuck wit me and mine, rain on your sunshine
Swine nigga's come as hard as a pork rind
Can you dig it? Only 5% live it
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it
Now fuck around

[Hook: Streetlife]
Drunken Master, styles causin' street disaster
Blaze cut faster than a fairy slasher
Tai-chi, Kung Fu fighting, ODB
Hands quick as lightenin', technique too deadly
Iron fist blew the pawn, switch styles like lay long
Let's get it on, heavy chow broke, it's not 'bout
Shadow boxin', better punch, you need oxygen, try again
When you catch the second wind, I'll break you in

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Down wit the All In Together Now Crew
The GZA, the RZA, me of course too
The thing I'm analyzing is strickly Hip Hop
That's what's made, well made is on my workshop
You was unable plus earn advance
Just to touch the untouchable kip hop dance
They're sayin' of the utmost, truly I'm the utmost
Have you ever caught the Hip-Hop holy ghost
Man, I mean really, that shit is mad hype
Especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics
I became a wrecker through my amplifier
Break it down base, treble through my dancer
That's one new dance, it's to my Black Magic music
It's not classic, Arabic or basic
It's strickly thickly, dirty and districkly
If not don't you pick me and forget me

Drunken Master, styles causin' street disaster
