[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
This is dedicated, to allllllll you bitch assssssss

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Bury motherfuckers like Dirt?
A Dirty for drama, get's worse
Who can make it happen like Dirt?, tell me

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Standin' over bodies with a shovel
Standin' over bad, til my beef all settle
On another level, cuz I dance with the Devil
Then I slap a bitch in the eye, with the bezzle
Starin' at ice, so my nine stare back
Then I shoot first, so you won't shoot back
Criminal thoughts, sippin' on Similac
If I walk with a limp, then it's pimp tag scrap
On sundown, you gonna eat these rounds
Roll on the bitch ass, with the tops dropped down
Dirty stay focused on the bend, deep nigga
Then I will offend, who offend me, nigga

[Hook 2X]

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Bury motherfuckers like Dirt?
When the cavalry come, and you face these guns
Who can make it happen like Dirt?

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
If you sittin' beside me in the church
One hand on the bible, on hand on your purse
Fuckin' the deacon's wife, like I'm Judas
Y'all thank God, while me and my stank, do this
Had her online like desktop computers
We ran the train, like rush hour commuters
Pack a pussy, like porn stars, yea, ya'll
Who can make it happen, Dirt Dog, the rock star
Bury motherfuckers who come, so stay far
I can send a bullet back to when, ya'll start war
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Who can get it clappin' like Dirt?
Who can make it happen like Dirt?

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Bury motherfuckers like Dirt?
When the cavalry come, and you face these guns
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
