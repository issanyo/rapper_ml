[Intro: Chops]
You listening to a Chops production
And MB's the click, ODB, Dirt McGirt, tell 'em

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yeah, roof is on fire, bitch, put it out
Out of control, flames spinnin' out
When you get real deep, dig it out
When you rollin' up the L, pig it out
Pop the cork, respect, pour it out
White Horse in the house, roll it out
If it's goods on the wood, throw 'em out
I'll be there, pop, you can dig it out

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Dirt Dog, want the red rug, roll it out
You saw the grip, and I ain't ashamed to pull it out
My fault, cuz you said you gonna bring it out
And you know it ain't comin', til I'm singin' out
Oh, don't stop ma, got my legs shakin' here, don't stop ma
You'se a real freak girl, gotta give you props
Cuz I feel the bam bam when my bed rock

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Rollin' on your stair, bitch, pick her out
Out of control, and can't slut her out
Big girls, you can get it, no doubt
You jumpin' off, with the pretty little mouth
Don't expect to trip down south
Uh-uh, and relay in my baby mama house
Let's fuck, girl, time's running out
Mama be home at five, on the dot

[Hook]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Fuckin' up my party, bitch, throw 'em out
Out of control, my name, wide 'em out
Fill the arenas, the Roc, sell 'em out
Get mad shit on the curb, and pout
When I left the Billboards, what drought
Serious thought, for those who wanna doubt
Move with felony niggas, that just came out
And thunders that be spittin' in heavy, like four pounds

[Hook]
