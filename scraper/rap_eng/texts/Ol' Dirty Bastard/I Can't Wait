[Intro]
Yo, Yo Miami

Big Baby Jesus I can't wait
Nigga fuck that! I can't wait!

[Verse 1]
I ain't no actor my shit's for real
Thighmaster
If I don't get paid 2 or 3 million dollars on Monday
I'm a bring on the ARMAGEDDON!(It's Monday)
Fuck that feeling, this fo reeling
Nigga I want my own island
Make it rain, hail, storm and earthquake
UHHHH! That's what I'm saving!
Play that music in your trunk
The cocaine amplifies my funk
Nigga I'm from the ghetto
How many celebrities from the ghetto?
(Dirty your crazy, I'm crazy about your music
Dirty your crazy, you're a nutcase you're a fucking nutcase)

[Chorus] (x4)
Big Baby Jesus I can't wait
Nigga fuck that! I can't wait!

[Verse 2]
AIDS, chickenpox, flu, and night fever
Cancer, herpes, mumps, and seizures
Diabetes, TB if you're against me
You die easier!
Cops don't have a show whatsoever
Ain't no more doctors, ministers
Nurses can't give us searches
There won't be electric, won't be churches
Cause your body go against you
Whether it's a lie or whether it's true
You can't use violent mentalities anymore
It ain't lambskin
You can't use the word napkin
Nigga ya sleeping

[Chorus] (x3)
Big Baby Jesus I can't wait
Nigga fuck that! I can't wait!

[Break]
Hold on Hold on Hold on

[Verse 3]
I'm diplomatic playing pen and pad
Ratatat you're a scaredy-cat
Cause I have a tat put you up like that
You can't stand that, cause you gotta scat
You couldn't even move
Don't know how to groove
BITCH TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES
Stink up the room
Motherfucker you knew!

Dirt Dog don't mean to be rude

[Chorus] (x8)
Big Baby Jesus I can't wait
Nigga fuck that! I can't wait!
