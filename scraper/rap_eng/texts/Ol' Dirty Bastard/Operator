Operator (operator)
Get the police (she's so fine)

Look at that girl (must be a crime)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Met this bitch, by the name of Suzy
She was a bad bitch, she had a big ol' booty
She got me set up, when I went to the projects
Bad ass bitch, she was the one to holla at
Had another bitch by the name of Precilla
You know that bad bitch, she taste like vanilla
In my car, looking good like that
Getting money, making rushes, down with rats
Saying to myself, no one can defeat me
I got my dick out, come on bitch, feed me
Let shit out, go down the throat
Nigga like me, never miss a note
If rain, I got coke, so I can't soaked
Make a nigga go, I takes that dough
Get hot like Superfly
I'm the best at this shit and I don't know why

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Girls with money, drippin' from your ass
I don't give a fuck, I'm smoking grass
You known me from down the block, I'm that good
Sold to your people in your neighborhood
Baby how you want, the period is yummy
The diamonds in my mouth, I'm eatin' gummy
The feet bitch, I'm not lookin' at the corn
The way you farted, smell like them horns
You got enough body, enough to start a fight
Your deep throat, me solo, say all night
I'm movin' on you, screwin' on you
Don't know what I'm doing on you
Ain't your man, but I know I'm chewing on you
You'll be best, when me and you leave the set
Got rubies, how did you get them neck?
How do you feel about that bitch, if the bitch is a fatty
Hit that bitch, now take it from me

[Chorus]

[Hook 4X: Ol' Dirty Bastard (girl)]
If you ain't sweating, there's something wrong, girl
(I am....) Say it louder

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now bitch tell me right now, why you trying to kill me
As if that I like bitches like Eazy-E
You float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Knock that ho out like Muhammad Ali
Spin in my mouth, throw your knees to the floor
Squeel like a pig, I squeel like a whore
Squeel like a motherfucker, do on tour
69 girl, get on all fours
Winter, Spring, Summertime, Fall
When I walk down the street, do a man whore
Black blueberry bitch, stink, girls itch
Forget two G, I'm filthy man rich
Tuesday, Wednesday, I take off
Get it bitch, get it, my dick needs floor
I'm gonna get this CREAM, teen girl, hurt you, fuck laws
Movin' on your broads, fly skit tours

[Chorus 2X]
