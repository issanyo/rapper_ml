[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard {Buddha Monk}]
I was drivin' an Accord, nominated at awards
Back in the days drivin' an Accord
Run-uhhn-uuhhn-uhhn, nominated at awards
Back in the days drivin' an Accord
Everybody rise (Wu-Tang)
(This slang) You know (this rhyme) you came to America
(that's our thang)
(I hang) And took over the black woman (and her reply)
(Is slang) The black woman wanted the Judge
(They runnin' from the cops)
They run, runnin', run, runnin', runnin', runnin'
Here Comes the Judge, here Comes the Judge
Here Comes the Judge, here Comes the Judge
Here Comes the Judge, here Comes the Judge
Here Comes the Judge, here Comes the Judge
Here Comes the Judge, here Comes the Judge
Here Comes the Judge, here Comes the Judge
{Give it to me now}

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard (girl)]
Here comes my Mac

I don't need you to monitor my perimeter (I wanna [?])
Got me Accord, take me to judge

Nominated at awards
Back in the days drivin' Accords
I didn't have nothing to give
I didn't have no life to live

[Verse 2: Buddha Monk]
Yo, start the attack with dirt up cats that's wack
Wants to be a gun blazer but jacks the flavor tracks
I numb out frames, don't blame it on the cocaine
What is sure to be the blame is the bullets of which you obtained
Zoo or Zi Tribe and will live to be trifle
News stands everywhere shows Zoo homicidal
Extra extra read all about it
Dirt Dog's Dirty cousin kills off Franklin and Madison
This Dirty hiphop, tryna stop the raw lights
Zu shoot down on the block, I need beamie of Scotch
Block is mad hot, bad boys want their fuckin hollar
Asked for Information, got it from a bitch named Tmara
Click click, a bloaw bloaw bloaw
Wish y'all woulda crawled with her
Would have killed that bitch off, and fucked her ugly daughter
Hahaahhhahaaa

[Outro: Judge]

No longer will you make a mockery of the justice system
The honorable Judge Pig Meat has spoken
I sentence you to life

I am the Judge, I am the Judge, I am the Judge, I am the Judge
I am the Judge, I am the Judge, I am the Judge, I am the Judge
I am the Judge!
