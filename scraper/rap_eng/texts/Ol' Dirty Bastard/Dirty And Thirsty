[Intro: Thirstin Howl III]
Yeah, this what happens when you dirty and thirsty at the same time

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, It goes one shot, two shot, three shot, four
That's how I'm soundin' when I'm shootin' down your door
Five shot, six shot, seven shot, eight
That's for all them niggas, that I catch at the wait
Nine shot, ten shot, eleven shot, twelve
Them four shots, gonna keep me outta jail
I be, damned if I fail, BK know me well
And take your precint to war, before I take a fall
I'm good with them free throws, like I play ball
When the war is on, it's McGirt that you call
The last man standing, heavy with the cannon
Come through on a bike, with a bulletproof, prancin'
Leave you in your pearl, put you on the porch, dancin'
And leave your brains on the back of a white shirt
While they playin' some old school shit by Al and Bert
I'm not gonna stop til I'm under the dirt

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
If ya'll want war
Let's get it on
Cuz we don't care
Where ya'll from

[Thirstin Howl III]
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
I wear that gold chain that used to be yours
Five shot, six shot, seven shot, eight
Shotgun shells give your face a new shape
Nine shot, ten shot eleven shot, twelve
That last fucking bullet I'ma save it for myself
Speed luger, weed smoking, walking with the pistola
Somebody gotta die for this shit to be over
Brownsville, pull your gold card membership
Rikers Island styling, just courted sentences
You been a bitch since your thing started showing
Glocks down in Moscow, did the jooks out in Poland
Leather trench, villain shit, gutter crime citizen
Show the something hand held with shells to kill you with
My heart's the realest thing to ever fill a clip

[Hook 2X]

[Interlude: Thirstin Howl III]
Yeah yeah, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Roc-A-Fella
Thirstin Howl III, Skillionare Enterprises
Melbeatz, Optic Records
This universal right here, all around the world
Ya know what I mean? This is breaking language barriers righ here
When you dirty and thirsty at the same time, somebody's gon get hurt
