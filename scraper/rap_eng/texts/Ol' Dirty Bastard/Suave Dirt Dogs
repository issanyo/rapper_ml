[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo y'all niggas can't do what I do, straight up
But if you're ready to roll with me
Know what I'm saying
Y'all got to obey Dirt Dog, straight up
It's like that, what! nigga
I'm a fine and attractive handsome young man
Got most pretty girls saying 'Dirty I'm your fan'
I'm intelligent, so excellent
Girls want to talk to me
Bitch I ain't giving you no lip

[Saukrates]
Yo yo yo yo
You never knew Sauk's could rock the keyboard
See me out on the dance floor with three whores
And planning to go back to see the seashore
Sipping Sex on the Beach, but before
I get outta here, I'm hooking three more
Chickens, get with it
Don't be a nuisance, taste the romance
Forget the finance, all I want you ladies to do is dance

[Choclair] (ODB)
Tell me what you know about suave dog thangs
Tell me what you know about dirt dog thangs
It's two buff strokes to shine you belly chain
It feels good like you assed out in the rain (straight up)
Girls hold their eyes on the things I say
'Cause they used to catch, throwing down Gs on it
We be stroking in the cab, breath on it
With the meter still running, 'cause my knees on it
Now you get to push first, put your two lips on it
So call me the long dick brown skin hornet
Ladies jam on it and shake that ass
Suave dogs catch a groove, don't move too fast

"Play with me" *repeated behind ODB*
[ODB]
Don't stop
Look, who that bitch over there?
Who that girl over there dun?
Is she looking at us, she like you dun

CHORUS [ODB] (Saukrates)
If you're ready to roll, roll with me
(Shake your ass girl, shake your thing girl)
(Shake your ass girl, shake your thing girl)
I said, if you're ready to roll, roll with me
(Shake your ass girl, shake your thing girl)
(Shake your ass girl, shake your thing girl)

[ODB]
You ain't tenderising me down with your sob story
I got you under control from army to mob boy
I mastered Tai Chi, you niggas better let me live con-for-tably
Oh goodie, you tooti-fruiti oh goodie
Tooti-fruiti, oh goodie
Ah whap bomb a lou bop a whap bang boom

[Choclair] {ODB}
Now I hope you don't mind if I sneak a touch
And slide in the cut, Sauk's got the record so the needle won't budge
My track pants sag to create a half moon, nigga what
Fellas if you see a fat ass say (what!)
Ladies if you need a long dick say (aah!)
Y'all need this, intricate groove bop shit
{Don't be talking about my sister}
Say my name girl (chizznocklate)
Oh girl, now you got me thinking fast
Your nice thick lips, Marnier in the glass
You approach me, other dudes have to ask
'Cause they mad because they ain't getting none, fuck 'em
It's as simple as this, I do my own thing
Got my own shit and I got my own game
Some dudes suck dick, I get my dick sucked
It's as plain as that, word up
Come on, let's pour the rum in the cup, word up
ODB and me speak words freely
{You don't stop} X4
Saukrates, uh, redrum Chizzy

CHORUS

"Play with me" *repeated in background*
[Saukrates]
All you ladies got to do is dance
All I want you niggas to do is dance
All you ladies got to do is dance
All you niggas got to do is dance
All I want you ladies got to do is dance
All you niggas got to do is dance
All I want you ladies got to do is dance
All you niggas got to do is dance
All you ladies got to do is dance

[ODB]
If you're ready to roll, roll with me, stay dirty X4
Don't go against me

Yo bring it back from the top
