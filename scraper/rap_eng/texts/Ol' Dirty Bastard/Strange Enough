[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
N.A.S.A., Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Toe to toe, I scrap with the best
If I spit 10 rhymes, nigga 9 gon' connect
If you ain't from the 102, I respect
Cause I probably just forgot, I'm rolling strictly for my set (Dirt Dog)
Wu-Tang, man I love my set
Niggas coming up here cause this is where the cheese at
Look here, more money, more problems, my ass
You's a naive cat if you still believe that, for real
That's some shit to try to keep you where you at
All content while niggas driving Bentleys and Maybachs
Think I'mma laid back playa? Forget it
First 100 G's I see nigga I'm tryin to flip it (hell yeah)
And that's some real shit, not just some lyrics
I got a couple open cases, not too specific
Niggas out here tryin to prove who's the realest
It's ok to pop shit, but come a little different

[Chorus: Karen O]
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change

[Interlude]
Ladies and gentleman
Right about now
Let's get ready to rumble [?]

[Verse 2: FatLip]
Wild boy, cow bow, entertainer
Insane Purple Rainer
Musical genius, smoke the greenest
35 trying to survive like I mean this
Amped up with a whole lotta watts
Beat bang like a whole lotta shots
In the gun range, strange as they come
Underground don-da-da number one
Bang this orangutan, jungle funk, trouble funk
Double shot vodka on the rock star drunk
Rock n roll songs belong to blues singers
So peep this song that we sing, ya

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Young and started, but I had a talent
To give this pack a jump, cause I took it as a challenge
So older niggas gave me much as I could handle
Cop the eagle, started jacking with the green New Balance shit
Feeling clean, I was only 13
With the heavy starch on my Bugle Boy jeans
My name spelled out on my 4 finger ring
It was Dirt then, cause McGirt you ain't seen

[Chorus: Karen O]
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change

[Verse 3: FatLip]
Yo, the truth hurts, I'm addicted to shit I don't need
Weed, yayo, nosebleeds
Please don't remind me the hoes that grind me
Strip club, late night, gettin' grimy
Freak show, panty lover
But I'm gettin too old for this like Danny Glover
Nah, bump that, gimme some more, let's go
Ozzy Osbourne when I perform the flow, yo
I'm old school, set in my ways
Set blaze to the track N.A.S.A. made
Ain't lost my touch
Ride 'till the wheels fall with no clutch
Just stick to the script n' dip
Dirt and Lip getting chips like Erik Estrada
Coming with the silent product
It's FatLip and Dirt Dog
And N.A.S.A. for all y'all

[Chorus: Karen O]
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
I'm Deranged enough to change

[Chorus: Karen O]
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change
Don't know why I do these things that hurt me
I'm strange enough to change, y'all use these tools and then pervert me
Deranged enough to change
