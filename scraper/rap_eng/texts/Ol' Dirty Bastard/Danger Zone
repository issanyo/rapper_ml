Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
In the danger zone, in the danger zone
(Say what?
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
Lounge, homeboy, you in the danger zone
In the danger zone, in the danger zone)

From coke to PCP, from Marie to Penelope
I'mma smoke this cocaine, like white boys smoke trees
Can I get that G, autograph me
I feel like a refugee how people run up on me
Pussy is powerful, it feels wonderful
It got me worshipful, money is plentiful
Niggas is full, and plus your bored
Any girl I pull is too wall for war
Power plug on, pussy turned on
I rocked it on, rap colored thong
Weight, I put on, strong like protons
I polly, then I'm gone, my style carries on
It's my party, holdin' too much hotty
Go and dance, and it's a robbery, actin' all snobbery
Real name: Moses, I pantyhose it
To all my hoes, industry, I sow's this

Where the aluminum bats'll give welts
And niggas wear ratchets in they belts
Nah, niggas wear ratchets like belts
Nah, it ain't good, but if you say the wrong thing
In my hood, might as well, say the casket just fell
Collapse from that smell, he dodgin' po-po
Niggas wanna act like they mafioso
All they see is me, when I spark the four-four
With a red dot, bigger than the Target logo
Dudes be superhuman, on some X-Men shit
With fast ways, you the only dead man to live
So act tough, til he see his best man give
Now he pro-black, on some X-Clan shit
For realer, I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge ain't sweet, when a muthafucka pussy
So get loud, get piped, get drunk, get live
Get tough, get hype, go ahead, get smacked, nigga
