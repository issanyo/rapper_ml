[Intro]
Why'd you won't let me love you?
Yeah
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Party people all around the town
It's the ODB kid
Once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time
You gon' love this

[Verse 1]
I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out, I keep MCs looking out
I drop science like girls be dropping babies
Enough to make a (nuh) go crazy
In the G-Building, taking all types of medicines
Cuz you thought you were better than
Ason, I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more sh**
Enough to make you break and shake your ***
As I create rhymes good as a Tastykake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
(nuh) catching headaches, what? What? You need Aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
(What?) 'round, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burning? Well see? now you're learning
How I don't even like your  profile
It's like BLAOW! CH-CH-CH-CH, MAD STYLES!
Last seen and heard, no-one knows
You forget: (nuh) be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole bloodclot lot
You don't wanna get shot
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watched me put you loooooooooooow down
As you can go, below zero
Without a doubt I never been tooken out
By a (nuh), who couldn't figure
Yo by a (nuh), who couldn't figure
Yo by a (nuh), who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)
How to pull a gun trigger
"GET OUTTA HERE!"
(Nuh) wanna get too close, to the utmost
But I got stacks that'll attack any wack host
Introducing - yo **** **** *****'* name
My Hip Hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa! Let me like slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
(Nuh) get up, act like a pig trying to hog sh**
So I take yo *** out quick
The mics, I've had it my *****, you can suck my ****
If you wanna step to my mother******* rep
CH-CH-BLOAW! BLOAW! BLOAW! Blown to death
You got shot cause you knock knock knock
"Who's there?" Another mother******* hardrock
Slacking on your macking cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back

[Hook]
