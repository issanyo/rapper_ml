[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ladies and gentlemen, En Vogue, Osirus
This is dedicated to all my monkeys
Gonna funk you right on up, gonna funk you right on up
Gonna funk you right on up, gonna funk you right on up
Gonna funk you right on up, gonna funk you right on up
Gonna funk you right on up, gonna funk you

[En Vogue 1]
Im loving you too much
Don't take advantage of
My tender heart and everything about me
In giving you my trust
Im giving you my love
So do take care, please be gentle with my heart

[Hook: (En Vogue) En Vogue 1]
(Bum, bum, bum) Everything I do is about you baby
(Bum, bum, bum) Baby I don't wanna give up
I've been loving you from the start
Here's my head, here's my heart
Everything I do is all about you baby

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatever you do, whatever you think
I look in your eyes
You dont know how my heart aches
Whatever you say, whatever could mean
You're breaking my heart

[En Vogue 1]
I want it all the time, I want it every night
I can't stop thinking, can't stop thinking about you
I'm burning with desire, my heart and soul on fire
So do take care, please be careful with my heart

[Hook: (En Vogue) En Vogue 1]
(Bum, bum, bum) Anything you do I crave it baby, baby, baby
(Bum, bum, bum) I can't get you out a my mind
(bum, bum, bum) Loving you I can't deny you're in my heart
Deep inside, everything I do is all about you, baby

[Chorus]

[En Vogue] w/ ODB in the background
I may be a fool for you, baby
Well, I can't help myself
Maybe I'm too in love
What else can I do but go crazy
For your love, boy, I'd give anything

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
On and on, I'm the rap professor
Freaky and alive, the women caressor
Never say I'm freaky or a pervert
But baby, I'm a singer man and I flirt
I'm throwing you some nuh, my foot comes down
When a man has a woman, he can never leave town
She's all on my back, oh, blocking my goals
Same time ho, get off my own

[Chorus 3X]

[Interlude: Sample]
