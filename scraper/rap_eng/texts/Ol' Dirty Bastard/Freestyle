One, two and three through your raps fatigued in this mc word is a minor league/ see when brothas speak they swear it's unique, just a peak physique of an old antique / don't except a project, that's bond to freeze, your hardheaded stiff neck siamese / see i never liked rhymes, that's incomplete then again obsolete, shall i repeat, it's an easy street/ brothas who earn, learn your sojourn then you return, as an intelligent, positive, messenger not an experiment, negative, lucifer, with the tinited gloss of graftedï»¿ skin, not the light spring source of the true origin / who was thor, wizard of war, cave man best friend was a damn dinosaur / no more jungle life living from the blue lagoon / its not an animal house, national lampoon / if you know the what, when, why and how / have you feel into a zen or to disallow / a fresh mc that will knock you down, i get you dizzy spell-bound, like a merry go round quan to u live and raw



I didn't catch everything if you can fix it thanks!!
