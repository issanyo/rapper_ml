[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
This is Dirt McGirt, B. Valentine
Yo, baby, you know one thing
That I always be letting you know, in your heart
You know when I tell you, I love you
And that I care, that I do, darling, come on

[Brooke Valentine] (Ol' Dirty Bastard)
You come to question me (question me)
And bring me on the stairs (uh-huh)
I be like everything (everything)
And nice as, as I can (why you acting like this for?)
You asking 21 questions, you
Ask all the same, it's just
I don't have the answers you need (uh-heh, uh-heh)
So you ask me where I was
Then I say I don't remember, though
You get mad at me (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Brooke Valentine (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Boy, you know I love you
Boy, you know I love you, like
Lah-lah-lah-lah-lah-lah-lah (you know I love you girl!)
But you're always talking
Boy, you're always talk yourself
Like blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
(Blah blah blah, why she keep talking to me this way? Ah yeah!)

[Brooke Valentine] (Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Don't ask me where I've been (Where you going?)
Cuz I never tell the truth (never the truth girl)
You said you won't get mad
If I'm honest with you (why do you wanna leave me?)
You asking 21 questions, you
Ask all the same, it's just
I don't have the answers you need (yeah!)
So you ask me where I was
Then I shy I don't remember, though (why?)
You get mad at me (Talk to me sweetheart!)
You know I love you...

[Chorus: Brooke Valentine (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Boy, you know I love you
Boy, you know I love you, like (uh!)
Lah-lah-lah-lah-lah-lah-lah (lah-lah-lah-lah-lah-lah-lah)
But you're always talking
Boy, you're always talk yourself
Like blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
(Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah)

[Hook: Brooke Valentine] (Ol' Dirty Bastard)
You keep on talking, asking me questions
Driving me crazy, I really don't feel like (why?)
Lah-lah-lah to me (why you wanna leave me?)
You're making me scream, you're making me sick
And I just can't handle it, it's blah-blah-blah to me

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, yo, aiyo, hold on, hold on, hold on, B
Hey listen, listen, all I'm asking you, is just one question
You say you love me girl, but if you really loved me
You wouldn't treat me this way, so where have you been?
This is Ol', this is Ol' Dirt Dog, talking to you sweetheart
Don't give me a blah-blah-blah, cuz I'm not here for it
Just tell me, now you know I'm in love with you
And you know you my sexy... so treat me that way, please!
Why do you treat me this way...

[Chorus 2X: Brooke Valentine w/ Ol' Dirty Bastard]

[Hook]
