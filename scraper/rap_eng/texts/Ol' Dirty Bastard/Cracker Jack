"C'mon baby, c'mon c'mon baby" repeats
In background all throughout the song

"You bitches can't do nothin" repeats
In background through intro

[Intro: ODB]
It's Ol' Dirty Bastard and shit, know'm sayin?
I wanna give a big shout out to my nigga Lou
KnowI'msayin? You know, you know, know
I wanna lock all the bitches down
I wanna lock all the bitches down from the North
To East, to West, to South
KnowI'msayin?
I wanna.. help me put these bitches in my trance
I want y'all to suck my lizard
You bitches wanna fuck me when you smell my under-arms

[ODB]
I'll make yo' dick disappear
I ain't hearin' anymore weird sounds in the air
PSSSSSSS... you can't purr no more
You wanna kneel and suck dick? I'mma keep your throat sore
Bitch you got herpes in ya ass
Every time you fuck a nigga, he dies fast
And you won't last
The pussy break down from a rash
It's hard for you to walk, cuz you stuck up in your ass
Don't ask me for no cash
You better not be tellin' me to give them no cash
Ash, bash, crash, sad ass

[Hook: ODB]
Give me a little of that Cracker Jack
You ain't caramel coated Cracker Jack
Well surprise, bitch you gonna get waxed
That's that shit, you can't do nothin' about

[ODB]
Girls ain't pretty to me anymore
Cuz you ain't bein a real whore
Ooh, you ain't a real whore
*I'm gettin' hot and touchin' myself!*
You can't say, wear nails anymore
You ain't givin a, manicure
Suckin' my dick is gonna be your cure
If you don't, your punishment
You can't get off until you suck my dick
Physically I operate your brain to function
Give me anything, that I want and
ALL GIRLS WANNA FUCK ME EVERYDAY
And give me that, the money
Don't even know it happens naturally
Especially when I'm playin with the chemistry
THE MONEY COMIN TO ME FIRST
You gonna keep dyin til you die from thirst
I WANT A DIFFERENT GIRL EVERYDAY
If you wanna die, you gotta drink my sperm
The other way to die, is eat a can of worms

Chorus 3X

[Outro: ODB]
Give me a little...
Yo, I love you girls cuz you wanna stick your tongue up in my ass
Or you can't taste, smell, touch or hear, or see
I got you in a smash, give me it!

[Instrumental for next 58 seconds]
