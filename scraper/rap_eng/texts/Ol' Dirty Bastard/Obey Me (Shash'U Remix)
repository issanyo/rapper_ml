Yeah! Yeah!

[Chorus]
Bitches better obey me
Because I'm the truth! Truth!
Bitches better obey me
Because I'm the truth! Truth!

Wu-Tang fuck niggas up
Straight up
We talking about how y'all feeling
Killarmy in the place to be

[Verse 1]
Yo yo, [?]
Get up on stage and control your hoes while your hoin'
Don't get it in line, I'm a celebrity
All you chump ass niggas 'round me
You can't get it for free
I break down your whole army
I'm wearing a two-hundred pound vest on
A two-hundred pound ankle bracelet on
A two-hundred pound wrist band on
I'm healthy and I'm strong, fuck it
You pussies are hypnotized
Now get on you pussy and ride
I only do to the bitches my fans
And if you like it we'll do it again and again
You wanna [?] my [?]
Take off your shoes bitch , don't feel bored

[Chorus]
Bitches better obey me
Because I'm the truth! Truth!
Bitches better obey me
Because I'm the truth! Truth!

[Verse 2]
I come to bite your neck
I keep chains around your neck
You'll never stop choking
Around your ankles
I keep a pair of handcuffs round them

[Chorus x2]
Bitches better obey me
Because I'm the truth! Truth!
Bitches better obey me
Because I'm the truth! Truth!
