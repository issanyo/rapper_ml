[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
You want this Dirty long, you want this shit
You want it, you need it
You want this Dirty long, you want this shit
You want it, you need it......

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Don't need muscle, cuz Barry got a gun
Nighttime, still blaze like sun
Book the residence, worry bout none
Chillin' with believer, drinkin' zero proof rum
Darker is better, cuz the dick's well done
Be a good girl, let you taste what I'm from
Baby, I'm the man, with the frame: well hung
Cuz a squirrel, is a squirrel til a squirrel get a nut
Get a butt, like an ashtray, point it out, I eat her
Til the 6, been callin', sayin, "nah, I don't wanna meet her"
In the ass, to some Pendergrass, after smokin' grass
Fuck her fast like a rabbit, I'm a sex fiend addict
I'm a sex fiend addict, I'm a sex fiend addict

[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard (sample) {Black Keith}]
You want this good looking muthafucka
Cuz I'm a good looking muthafucka, girl
You want this Dirty long, you want this shit
You want it, you need it..
(It's so doggone good, it's so doggone good
It's so doggone good, it's so doggone good) 2X {Keep calling me...}
{Pussy keep calling me}

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
If she's layin' in my sheets, she's the freek of the week
Seen it all, done it all, lick my balls with her tongue
Got my toes curled up, like I'm sayin' right on
If you wanna ride home, let me call you a cab
Cuz the next bitch coming, might be coming in the cab
Like licking, you can chill, if you ain't, you can escape
Cuz the friend's coming with her, and she can participate
After Mardi Gras, I meet 'em in titty bars
Take 'em home, and bend 'em, and fill 'em with Dirty long
Cock strong dick diesel, when I stand like an easel
Come sit on Mini Me, and put a smile on Dr. Evil
Got some sunshine, leavin' my girl behind
The kind of pussy that start up a conga line
Pussy callin', I be pickin' it up
Pussy robber, I be stickin' it up
When I leave the ringer off, I be missin' a nut
I be missin' a nut, I be missin' a nut

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (sample) {Black Keith}]
Yo, you get your friends, and I'mma get my friends
And we gonna smoke some shit, and we gonna do this shit
You know what I'm sayin', we gonna go wild like animals and run loose in this
Muthafucka
(It's so doggone good, it's so doggone good
It's so doggone good, it's so doggone good) 2X {Keep calling me...}
Yeah, you like it when I go deep, baby, it's that Dirty long baby
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, come all in that pussy {Pussy keep calling me}
Aiyo, hold on, hold on for a second {pussy keep calling me}

(I wanna keep on, checkin' on you, yeah.... I got to know everything you do
Cuz you're lovely, love that you that, hey hey hey, you so doggone good)
