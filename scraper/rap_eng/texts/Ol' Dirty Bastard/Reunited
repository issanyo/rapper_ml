[Intro]
What what what what what what
You know when the time it is motherfucker

[Hook]
Reunited cause it feels so good
Reunited cause we're understood
There's one perfect thing
And children this one is it
We both we're so excited cause
We're reunited, hey! hey!

[Verse 1]
I'm known on the microphone as the rap professor
Cas-ual dresser, you may dress fresher
The way that I speak this shit is energetic
My physique of meat is quite athletic
Remove all MC's who disapprove
That my funky rhyme article always have the groove
You're jealous over me nigga, you're not a competitor
You're just a donor, I'm the rap editor
Tryin' to rock the mic when you get an appetite
All negative on the mic, I dislike
Try to rock the mic but only will reduce
Try to get loose, you juice as a youth
Not knowin' to yourself that you shall be frozen
I'm the MC warrior, who has been chosen
To rock and shock beats, polite when I recite
Sulfur emcees, you are down right, out right
Tryna be talkative, there's no alternative
Hide until I forgive, this motive
I am unique with the perfected physique
The objective of my rhyme is my own technique

[Hook]
Reunited cause it feels so good
Reunited cause we're understood
There's one perfect thing
And children this one is it
We both we're so excited cause
We're reunited, hey! hey!

[Verse 2]
I maintain the paradise on this Earth
With the shut the fuck up style for what this shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse
Super-hero niggas die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply
You bitches, ya nice guys
Always want bitch, because ya need my bit
I pleased on how I get up on the stage and fuck up the show
Cause nobody can't fuck with me!
Earl!!, from ages, a 100 and down, sacrifice ya baby to the underground
The best kept secret, how does it feel to be
Boxin' in like a skeleton, growin' back ya skin? oaaaaaaaw!
I can't help it if my style is foggy, monster boogie
Get ya high on my patio, all come to see me movie
Bicthes, you're walkin' on my dirt
We ain't sayin nuthin'
I'm in ya ear, make ya blink cold Pert

[Hook]
Reunited cause it feels so good
Reunited cause we're understood
There's one perfect thing
And children this one is it
We both we're so excited cause
We're reunited, hey! hey!
