[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm the Eddie Kane of the Wu-Tang
Osiris with the fire extinguisher slang
Maintain this paradise on this earth
With the shut-the-fuck-up style for what the shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse, superhero niggas die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply

[Verse 2: Prodigal Sunn]
I'm yo' entrepeneur, wisdom sharpshooter, dark colour
The black sire, smack fire out of Goliath
My heart desire: speak truth till I inspire
The clever writer, live wire, never retire
The child teacher, loud speaker, earth seeker
The wind blower, to the seas, I'm like Noah

[Hook: Earth, Wind & Fire] (x2)
You're a shining star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see what you can truly be

[Verse 3: Hell Razah]
Uh, ayo, this masterpiece be exclusive and fascinating
Street knowledge education
Teach the seeds, son, no procrascinatin'
Ghetto learnin', graduatin'
Blessed be the ones with patience from the ancient
God bless the child that could hold his own
Little shorties, don't trust a soul, it's all globe control
Earth, Wind & Fire, Sunz of Man and Wyclef
We connect like "you now next to bring the intellect"
We teach both sex, Brooklyn to Tibet
Male or female: who follow footsteps incorrect?

[Verse 4: 60 Second Assassin]
I'm a shining star, beam of light from out far
Hits like these would burn holes through our reservoir
Espionage, let it be known who take charge
Come hard when we underground like camouflage
Keep it bizarre, mainstream for the young teens
Though, if it don't, be for Clarence the Thirteenth

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 5: Prodigal Sunn]
Escapin' the ghetto using the bass, tempo and treble
In the streets, we carry heavy metal, roll with the Devil
Yo, son, life is reality, reality is life
People livin' trif', the world filled with strife
The gods livin' right in this act, too many lack
Black on black crime, no vest, another victim laid to rest

[Verse 6: 60 Second Assassin]
It's been a long time to be certain
Sunz of Man Mahdees of wall searchin'
The heat is perkin', Earth, Wind & Fire burnin'
Sensation, yearnin' and learnin' situation
Wyclef: platinum hits, beast nation
It's what your life could truly be, anticipation

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 7: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
When I was young, I taught how to produce
The science of babies gettin' loose
I turn white boys to Springsteens, Bruce
Black to school, to the Chinese I gave brews
I can't help it if my style is foggy, worst to boogie
Get ya high on my patio or come to see me movie
Girls, they walking on my dirt, I'm all in ya ear
I'll make your life plain, call Herc, love potion

[Verse 8: Hell Razah]
To all my shining stars from here, to L.A., to Mars
Growin' up in the ghetto where times is hard
No matter where ya are, you a child of God
Born as a king, not a slave for jobs
It's much more to life then to drink in bars
Large bank accounts and these fancy cars
Little King Tuts, they schemin' when they lust
They get handcuffed for diamond ring cuts

[Hook] (x2)
