"Please calm down, the music & everything, everything
(?) I went and bought me an outfit today that costed a lot of money, today
You know what I mean, because I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win
I don't know how y'all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children, we teach the children
You know what I mean, Puffy is good but WU-TANG IS THE BEST!
Okay, I want y'all to know that this is ODB and I LOVE YOU ALL, Peace!"
