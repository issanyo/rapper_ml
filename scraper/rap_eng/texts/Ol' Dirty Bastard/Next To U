[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Peaches, sexy girl, you know you got it going on
Somethin' fine, baby, somethin' fine

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Well, I wanna get next to you
Ooh, I wanna get into you
Baby, I wanna get next to you, girl

[Chorus: Peaches]
Aiy-aiy-ya-aiy-ya, just wanna get next to you, wanna show what I wanna be
Aiy-aiy-ya-aiy-ya, wanna show you what I mean to you

[Peaches]
I got somethin' for you baby, I got a little somethin'
To you, for you, I'm not thinkin' for my baby, to get it in
Here it is, I don't let 'em know, really want to show you
What I mean to you, there's no thing, I really wanna bring, right there
We'll just take it slow and never let it go
Cuz we'll leave all our troubles behind

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Come on talk to the hand, levitate the body to Peach
She's fine, my pace it get sweeter and sweet
The body of a woman is deep
You say deep creep until you're whole heart beat
Let the Dirt Dog fuck it to a freak
From high to low I wanna bone them cheeks
The Indian Cherokee will have babies by the fleet
A rugged Dirty Bastard, tearin' up your street
I wanna get next to you, boo, straight up I'm a freak, heheh

[Peaches]
I really wanna say, I really wanna say, this what I feel right now
Really dont know, how far we'll go, just take it for a ride
Just take it slow, and we'll let it go
Cuz we'll leave all our worries behind

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X: Peaches]
I'm gonna give it you, what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm gonna give it you, what you want, what you want, and when you want it

[Chorus to end]
