[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Why ya'll always be talkin' shit (I'm comin')
You're always talkin' shit (want me I'm come? We coming)
Why ya'll always be talkin' shit (I'm comin')
You're always talkin' shit (want me I'm come? We coming)
Shit (we coming, we coming!)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm the nigga walkin' through the Hill, with the gun out
Lookin' for the big mouth, showin' off in front of bitches
Talk about Dirt, leave you lumped up in stitches
Dig a lotta ditches, for you six feet spitters
Put the barrel in ya mouth, I'm the shell case shitter
Masquerade paid, stay on the front page
Playin' on streets, like streets was arcade
My hand's all sprayed, like Charles blades the gensu
Feel the lucy, and spark up the neptune
Resurrect them, to dawn on, protect 'em
Outside set up, guess who inject them
Walk through zoo, but no Zu, is Brooklyn
Heavy artillery, thug chains in Brooklyn
Strapped in the back of the Ac', Dirty rolls like that
That's a Crooklyn fact, find Dirty
And you find where the cash is at, fuck y'all

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Why ya'll always be talkin' shit (fuck y'all)
Everytime I hear you talkin' shit (fuck y'all)
And anytime I hear you talkin' shit
Will be the last thing that you be talkin', shit (fuck y'all)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Spit fire like a livewire, the messiah
Take you higher than the last hit, mythological
In pussy logic, gynecolagist you can swallow
Cuz it' O.D.B., bitch!
Bring it like the Warriors, on the D Train
Explosive rap game, like a Meth thing
Spit acid, the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Pull like coast, to toast it, while I'm acid
Ten stories up, penthouse, only us
Meanwhile I'mma strain, what I can't crush
Fresh, wild and bold like the Cold Crush
Purple haze keep a nigga with the robut (fuck y'all)
On the major when the bitch slap, giddy up
I'm an ass man, but I tear the titty up
Tear ya whole city up, bring it if you grittier
Dirty ain't so pretty, even when the legs are levetated
Escalated, cuz I'm made of Baby Jesus
Welfare card expired, so I need this
Dirty rolls like that, that's a hood fact
Find Dirty and you'll find where the cash at
