[Dave Chappelle]
Alright y'all, 100 grand says I get it in one take
Thats right baby, one take Dave
One take Dizzle
Here we go

[Hook]
She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever
But it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic

She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever

[Verse 1: Skillz]
Trust me, It's something 'bout the way I touch her
The way that I hold her, the way I clutch her
She move a lot but that ain't shit to me
Man, I need that bitch and that bitch need me
I ain't even talking bout R-A-P
Them other lames be the same
Them don't worry me
Sit back
I spit that shit that
Get better then
Make a veteran sit back
Cruisin', mic check one twosin'
If y'all not us, then that's why y'all losin'
Eight up
No time to wake up
No masquerade nigga move the maker
Just do it
Put the hop in to it
And when you lose it
Don't blame the music
Half y'all fell in love with a whore
The question is if you don't love her
What you fucking her for, nigga

[Hook]
She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yeah, What the fuck's the problem
Y'all it's Lee Marvin
My squad more thicker than some hemoglobin
I scare y'all quicker than a mean ol' goblin
Ain't no bullshit me and my amigos poppin'
Huh?
We get started ain't gon' be no stopping
You gonna jump because it ain't gon' be no option
I'm totally contagious
Black man engaged in language
Black Thought AKA Larry Davis huh?
Got rhymes running off the pages
Tighter than the Bushes with the Saudi Arabians
Darker than an oil well
Sharp as a saber tooth tiger
Lying on a straight edge razor
New York talking on a two-way pager
Till ya main thing getting me the captain saver
I won't backslide cause I'd be a failure to mics
Rip tight like it's my genitalia
Huh?
The hip biatch she
Ain't your D appallin'
And a banana cognac biatch
Coney hair coat, my boots is ostreeotch
Black Inc. back, turn me up another nee-otch
Huh?

[Hook]
She want to know if we can be together

She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever
But it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic

[Verse 3: Truck North]
Yo, young truck
In this fucking game
And what a nigga if he wasn't in the game
I bring pain
Something to sprang
It's the big game
Nigga chick
Make me leave with the gang
You wanna talk a little shit
I make you walk with a cane
Got'em half steppin'
Like they walk the cane
Here I am
R A W raw
Chuck north
Introducing y'all
The way I 'splain things
Make your dame the same
I'm Superman to
Clark Kent to Lois Lane
Off for the paper
Y'all off for the fame
5 left of your 15 minutes of fame
I ain't go no problem causing drama to y'all
You never score
Like a punter
Running with the ball
Squeeze mics
Chuck north the man
With the myth
Signing off, yo
