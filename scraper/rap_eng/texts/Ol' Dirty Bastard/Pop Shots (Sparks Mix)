[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
None of you, nuh, betta look at funny
Nuh, you know my name now -- ODB

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard (sample)]
As I poppppppppppp, shotttttttttttttttttts (we gon' pop these shots!)
As I po-a-opppppppp, shotttttttttttttttttts (we gon' pop these shots!)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
'86 was the year that it started
Crack hit the states, and my hood got to poppin
Back then, you had to catch it with narcotics
Without a doubt, Brooklyn had the hardest projects
Nowadays, if a nigga say you got it
You be sittin in the county, with like 3 or 4 charges
Young when started, but I had a talent
To get this package off, cause I took it as a challenge
So older niggas game me much as I can handle
Copped the eagle, started jackin' with the green New Balance shit
I'm feelin clean, I was only thirteen
With the heavy starch, on my Bugle Boy Jeans
My name spelled out on my four finger ring
It was Dirt then, cause McGirt you ain't seen
(Yeah yeah yeah, alright let's get into it right now)

Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang

[Hook 2X - over "Wu, Tang"]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Toe to toe, I scrap with the best
If I spit ten rhymes, nigga, nine gon' connect
If you in front of one or two, I respect
Cuz I probably just forgot, and wrote it strictly for my set
Wu-Tang, man I love my set
Niggas comin up here, this is where the G's at - look here
More money, more problems, my ass
Youse a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real
That's a trick to try to keep you where you at, all content
While niggas ridin Bentleys and Maybachs
Think I'mma lay back playa, forget it
First hundred G's I see, nigga, I'm tryin' to flip it
And that's some real shit, not just a lyric
Got a couple open cases, not too specific
Niggas out here tryin to prove whose these realest
It's okay to pop shit, but come a little different

Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang

[Hook 2X - over "Wu, Tang"]

[Scratched]
"ODB" - cut it up
"Recognize I'm a fool, and you love me!"

[Repeat 4X]
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Roc-A-Fella Roc-A-Fella Roc-A-Fella Roc-A-Fella
