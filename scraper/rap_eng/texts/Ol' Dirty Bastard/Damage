[Intro]
Peace [peace!]
[Dirty, Ol Dirty Bastard]  Say it again
[The Genius! Genius]
The Genius [The Genius, the Genius]

Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard [GZA in brackets]
I'll grab the mic and I'll damage ya
Cut your whole stamina
Here comes the medical examiner
One verse then you're out for the count
[Bring the ammonia] make sure he sniffs the right amount
Wake him up and then ask him
Why did he attend this --
Competition to get an ass kickin so tremendous
Boy you know you shouldn't bother this
Leave me alone like the [son said G or he'll be fatherless!]
I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco
Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco
And MC's start to vanish
[I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin spanish!
Yo he wasn't from Panama
I asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntanama!
He responded so fast, you made me laugh]
Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH [then I scared-his ass!]
[Kick the hundred strongest rhymes
I brought out the punk in him
Caught him with a strong five deadly venom
Told him enter the Wu-Tang
Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring]
I watch your ass take a big fall, why?!
My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball
And as you step up to bat man [I play the riddler]
You try to do me for a rhyme [then I'll change to Hitler]
Go out like Nazi; you'll be wishin the fuckin ass stayed home and played [Yahtzee!]
Or watchin Happy Days sweatin [Potsie]
With Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and [Chachi]
Wu, who? Me gettin wreck so I'm through
Like a ten and a half foot, gettin in a seven [shoe]
[Now picture THAT with a Minolta]
Have your ass doin some Night Fever shit like John Travolta
I come strong I make knowledge born, I flip the script
And rock on from P.M. [past the fucking Dawn]
Pass the Hammer you're broke down, English grammar what what
Can't understand it here's the panaroma
[A complete view of how I defeat you]
Should've stepped to those fuckin kids who tried to [beat you]
Yeah I bust that ass before
[You ran to Texas and came back but forgot the chainsaw!]
And want to perform a massacre
Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular
Crush the personal vendetta, well you just better
Start stepping to your [raggedy ass jetta]
Put the pedal to the metal
You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle
As I [pass the bone, kicks your every measure]
It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure
[C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensamilli
Rolled up in a] Motown Philly
[I used to write all the time when I smoked
Grab the mic, then I like kinda went for broke
With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps
Lyrically speakin, three to four rhymes a choke
Some think they be harmin this, claimin they be bombin this]
But they still remains anonymous
I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix
Ride more beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks
I teach the truth to the youth, I say, "[hey youth]
Here's the truth, better start wearing [bulletproof]"
Arm yourself with a shield
[Before you get trapped up] just like the Children in the Cornfield
