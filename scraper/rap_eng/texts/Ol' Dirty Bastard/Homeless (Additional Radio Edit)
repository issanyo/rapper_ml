Land of the homeless
(Land of the homeless)
Land of the homeless
(Land of the homeless)

[ Tony D ]
It was late cold night and was walkin down the street
Didn't have a place to go, didn't have a place to sleep
Just creepin, to the sound of the city
God won't you help me, please have pity
For a fellow like me that's down on his luck
Do you have a dime, can you give me a buck?
So I can eat, a little bread or some meat
Gimme anything because my body is weak
You got a cigarette, blanket, it don't even matter
My life goes down as your pockets gettin fatter
Just help me to get the pain off my chest
Cause a fellow like me is homeless

[ Tony D, female singer ]
Oh-ouh
Land of the homeless

[ Ol' Dirty Bastard ]
Yeah
We're homeless, girllllll
Cause we're homeless
We have no place to go!

[ Tony D ]
Where my life is always lonely
(Land of the homeless)

[ Ol' Dirty Bastard ]
Dirt Dog don't got no home
All I got is my dog and my bone
Homeless, that's what I say
It's welfare about every day
Autograph I sign, I work for food
Gimme a coat! I'm in that mood
It's me and my shopping cart!
Fuck that shit, I ain't got no heart
I'm homeleeeeesssss

[ Tony ]
You see, I lost control, now my life is goin down
Ain't none of those so-called friends around
To help me out of the darkness now that I'm homeless
People walkin by don't wanna understand this
How I'm feelin, the way that I'm livin
Every now and then one dollar is given
From a lady, a kid, sometimes a man
I hate to keep beggin, so I hold out my hand
Drop my head to the ground, look down, and frown
I'm livin like a bum and I feel like a clown
Every day with no love is the way that I exist
That's the life of a man who's homeless

[ Tony D ]
Homeleeee-yeah-aa
My sleepless nights

[ female singer ]
Where I live it's cold at night
So I put my clothes real tight
Searchin for a healing light
That's warming me
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
Forgive me God for my mistaaaaaaake

[ Tony D, female singer ]
Oh-oo-oh
Land of the homeless
Why society disown me?
Wouuu, it's the
Land of the homeless
The way my life is always goin
Hoo-oh-oh

[ Ol' Dirty Bastard ]
Would you please let me iiiiiinnnn?
I have nowhere to go-ooooooo
It's cold outsiiiiiide
Babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I was born and raised in a garbage can
