Verse 1:
{Madrox}
When it rains and it pours
People they try to ignore
The storm clouds that forms
Reality, but these renditions they visit from door-to-door
Be it taxes, bills
And transform the caskets and pills
Overdosin' your closest homies
On the verge of a break down
My relatives are relatively on their way now
Flowers and graves, but still we stay down
'til I take a turn to rest and lay down
Next to 'em in the ground
Sunshine take away the pain now
It can't rain all day, all the time, every second
Always gloomy 'round mine, feelin' like I wanna drop it
And plant it up in the ground
And each raindrop is another problem fallin' on down
Still hopin' that the clouds just open
And everything goes from dark to bright
Until then my world's waste deep in water, ain't no sunlight
As it rains all day and all night

Chorus:
{Madrox}
Nothin' but water in my eye
As I look into the sky
It can't rain all the time
I reply as I really don't wanna die! [2x]

Verse 2:
{Monoxide}
I'mma let the rain fall
And I let my eyes become one with the window pane
As I'm riding a crazy train
And I brought a chainsaw
Hopin' to maim all
Hopeless and I'm outta my mind
But besides that we're like exactly the same y'all
And the rain will wash it all away
I keep a look out when I'm not around
But, believe me I'm just a call away
And it ain't my fault if they
Can't hang with the rain I bring
I'll just be part of day
And they can fuck with one less thing

Chorus:
{Twiztid}
Nothin' but water in my eye
As I look into the sky
It can't rain all the time
I reply as I really don't wanna die! [2x]

Verse 3:
{Madchild}
Yeah, I'm spittin' meteor showers, spittin' nuclear showers
Check my nucleus cluster, I got the spookiest powers
I am dark and demented, I'll shoot a nuke at you cowards
And stick my dick in a groupie, and fuckin' puke on ya flowers
Aye, lucky that I didn't overdose, I'm a sober ghost
Madchild slither like a cobra through the coldest snow
I'm claustrophobic but I'm locked up in a lonely room
You can look into my mind and see exploding doom!
See, I am twisted, I'm totally vicious
I'll brain storm, and drain storms, brain in the ditches
Of course I am afraid of death
Do we really lay to rest?
Do we really fly up in the sky?
Feel my jaded breath!

Chorus:
{Twiztid}
Nothin' but water in my eye
As I look into the sky
It can't rain all the time
I reply as I really don't wanna die! [2x]

Verse 4:
{Prevail}
C'mon!
What's immortality?
Does it mean that your battery is never gonna die?
Given a Duracell heavy like everybody
No one's ever ready for the trip to the sky
Why? Am I? No, not quite yet
But, my flow, overflow, over throws your cassette
Intense is just a word that I use
When I serve off crews like a dinner plate
I refuse to lose, cruise interstate
Then I bruise, and abuse, and intimidate
I ain't finna wait that takes too long
My patience is gone, my aim is on
Like an amazon with a boomerang
I'm rulin' this thing, what school is you in?
You ain't from hard rocks, maybe Fort Knox
Old school New York, real hip-hop
New school West coast, we don't shit talk
We just kick off, tip off, play off
You soft dude, so take a day off
Make your move and I'll improve the pay off
Improve the layout, I'm well designed
And I'm ahead of my time, so you should stay up!

Chorus:
{Twiztid}
Nothin' but water in my eye
As I look into the sky
It can't rain all the time
I reply as I really don't wanna die! [2x]
