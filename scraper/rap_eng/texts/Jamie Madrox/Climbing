"Look the history lessons over motherf**kas
You still to learn one thing tho
Man life is a ladder, keep climbing that motherf**ker
Even if there's like 52 thousand rungs
Man don't ever hesitate to get whatever it takes to get the motherf**king job done"

(Blaze)
There is one patch made of gravel and cobblestone
Filled with paying dues and laced with potholes
I'll never quit
Shit, I'll think I'll pull off to the side
With one foot in the game, and the other on the grind
Now my mind's been compared to a darkly lit alleyway
With too many rats and that bitch for you to tally
Now I'm moving on up
It's my timing, coming up short
Not for long, I'm steady climbin'

(Esham)
Climbin', rhymin' with the undying
Filthy, never shining
Always grinding, I made it three feet
And I got three feet to go
Cause been six feet under from a long time ago
Me and Colton Grundy, bloody money
Now I climb from the cemetary dirt under me
From dust till dawn, when the sun be shining
You'll see my hand come from underground
Cause I'm climbing

(Chorus)
I'm climbing, I'm rising, I'm straight to the top
Making blood splatter, don't matter, I ain't gonna stop
And I still got miles to go, and I keep on rising some more
I'm out here climbing, I'm whilin, this hatchet go chop

(Monoxide Child)
Its a constant battle, for me to get to the top
But when the ball drops, I'm going bring the world to a stop
I'm a man on a mission
Wishing everybody would just get up off me
Maybe then I could breath
I'm on my knees again
Waiting for my chance to get away
Hoping I'll be up there one day
I'll never stop trying to climb, so ride my vine
And let me reach for mine
And in time

(Jamie Madrox)
Hand over hand we climb, play the beat, and we rhyme
See us on stage, throwing the f**k you sign
The game is like a chain link fence
So I'm scaling that bitch with catlike reflexes
So I'm saying that, if you ain't got no grip
You need to find some two-way tape and get sticky with it
Cause our shit is like magnets the way that it attracts
They must be something that keeps it coming back
Cause we're the shit

(Chorus)
I'm climbing, I'm rising, I'm straight to the top
Making blood splatter, don't matter, I ain't gonna stop
And I still got miles to go, and I keep on rising some more
I'm out here climbing, I'm whilin, this hatchet go chop

(Repeat 2x)
I'm gonna keep climbing ya'll (climbing ya'll)
Straight to the top, I'm soaring (I'm soaring)
Blood's gonna keep flying ya'll (flying ya'll)

(Violent J)
I get bloody if I have to, pillage and stab you
Leave ya shredded
Like a pack of polar bears done had you
I don't give a shit, who has to die for me to fly
Slice your legs off under your kness, and float by
I'm who everybody hates, so I'm leaving the stakes
And I'm passing through dimensions
On through the pearly gates
I'm from beyond the sun, I come to bomb you some
And I'm the one to get the goddamn job done

(Blaze)
My socks are moving, ain't worried what others doing
Make my own path to the top, and it won't stop
I'm a grown man doing what a grown man does
Taking all you suckas back to school, so pack a lunch
I'm like a scholar, with knowledge too real to collar
Working on my next shit before I count a dollar
Cause when you made it there you don't let go
And don't look down until your in the ear of everyone in town

(Chorus)
I'm climbing, I'm rising, I'm straight to the top
Making blood splatter, don't matter, I ain't gonna stop
And I still got miles to go, and I keep on rising some more
I'm out here climbing, I'm whilin, this hatchet go chop

(Repeat until end)
I'm gonna keep climbing ya'll (climbing ya'll)
Straight to the top, I'm soaring (I'm soaring)
Blood's gonna keep flying ya'll (flying ya'll)
I'm gonna keep climbing ya'll(climbing ya'll)
I'm gonna keep climbing ya'll (climbing ya'll)
Straight to the top, I'm soaring (I'm soaring)
Blood's gonna keep flying ya'll (flying ya'll)
