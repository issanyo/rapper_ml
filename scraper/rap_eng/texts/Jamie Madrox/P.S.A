[Intro]
The following public service announceminet
Is brought to you by Twiztid
Dementing one geration at a time

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I'm a person who killed myself
Had a problem and no one helped
I tried to reach out but no reply
And now I'm gone any you'll never know why

[Hook]
Needed someone to listen
Help me make my decisions
It gets so hard sometimes
That I can't do it alone can't do it alone
It seems that love was missin
All the hate was just too convincing
Its just too much for me
And now I'm ready to go I'm ready to go

Throw that dirt and just (bury me) [x4]

[Verse 2: Madrox]
Look at me now I'm on the news (on the news, on the news)
Family interviews with tv crews (tv crews, tv crews)
Found a cell phone it must be mine (must be mine, must be mine)
Here's the message it read inside (read inside, read inside)

[Bridge: Madrox]
I hate you, you POS, no LOL, bitch I'm serious
And I suggest you KYS and BIH you're worthless

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Madrox & Monoxide]
Let me tell you what I would do
(I would do, I would do)
If they text me like they text you
(They text you, they text you)
Put down the phone and go to their house
(Go to they house, go to they house)
And take them and their whole family out

[Hook]
