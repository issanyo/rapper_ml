[Hook]
Sometimes you stop to just take a breath
You breathe in the air and you get upset
You don't wanna change, I just think you need
A little time alone and away from me
And I'm not the only thing in the world that's in your way
And I know it's hard sometimes
You misunderstand all those things I say

[Madrox]
And I don't need anymore, anything to control me
I've thrown my addictions aside again
And I don't need anymore, anything to provoke me
And wonder why I try again

[Monoxide]
I think that maybe this way that I feel a side effect
From trying to balance my soul, instead I keep dividing it
And hiding it from people who wanna provoke my bad side
And keep it all from bubbling over into a landslide
I'm medicated just hoping that it'll fly by
But sometimes I need to take a breath and I'll be alright
Up all night because all of this is getting to me
I know you probably want to hit me but breathe with me

[Hook]

[Monoxide & Madrox]
I sit so hallowed open while others level off at any cost
I've been depraved of things
That people think are such an awful loss
And I lost the race and picked up the pace
My timing's off, I'm well aware
And I can't believe I say those things I say as if I just don't care

[Hook]

[Madrox]
And I don't want anymore, all the greed is controlling
The hunger never seems to end
And I don't try anymore, so afraid of devoting
And then I die inside again
I think that maybe this way that I feels a side effect
From trying to balance my soul, well I keep dividing it
I try to get back up when I slip on banana peels
Situations develop out the mist of air it kind of feels
Like breathing in exhaust fumes while exhaling the hate
Os so many day gone days gone bad it all seems to fade
And dilute and pollute and contaminate the breathing air
I'm taking breaths in moderation as if I just don't care

[Hook]

[Monoxide & Madrox singing]
Breathe with me as if I just don't care
Would you breathe with me, as if I just don't care
Breathe with me as if I just don't care
Would you breathe with me, as if I just don't care
Breathe with me as if I just don't care
Would you breathe with me, as if I just don't care
