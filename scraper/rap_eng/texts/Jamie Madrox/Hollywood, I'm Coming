Festival of Samhain, what's that you're holdin?
Turn full circle face to face with the omen
When I split ya open I go for your heart
And spit on your soul and slash that weak shit apart
Competition means common and in the way
So all you common mothafuckas better watch what you say
I ain't friendly, bitch and ain't nobody asleep
You're only slept on 'cause your shit is played and weak
Then you slept with the enemy time and again
And now the only people comin' to your shows is friends
Of your sorry ass. I ain't sorry I'm kinda glad
I admit I took your CD back, said it was scratched
Should've broke that shit in half
For your attempt at tryin' and take me
For twenty dollars out of my pocket with no apology
Ordinary, wannabe, fly-by-night, high MCs
They call the one dude Daddy because he's like 53

Burn, black smoke fills the sky
You bring the wicked out of me, your killer is I
[Esham]
I'd love to watch you fall, but you're already gone
[Shaggy]
I'd love to watch you fall, but you're already gone

Quit takin' up shelf space, homie and just pass the weed
And let the mainstream tell you when or when not to breathe
Don't ever fuckin diss me or my crew at our shit
Or we'll feed you to them same fuckin'
Pigs I see you playin' with
Come and get some
Ya really wanna get your frontpiece rattled
All over a rap battle?
It's the fame-game homie, and we don't play that
So, if you diss me I'mma find out where your folks stay at
To say that, sparks may fly, but we don't die
And on the 21st day of July you got your eye full
Get the fuck off the stage and make way
You're like the legendary hoe, here today, gone the next day
It ain't a set-up, it's the truth and you can't deal with it
All because you're sheltered by that Hollywood appeal shit
It makes me sick, I wanna vomit
'Cause the only thing that matters 'bout your album
Is who else you got rappin' on it

Burn, black smoke fills the sky
You bring the wicked out of me, your killer is I
[Anybody Killa]
I'd love to watch you fall, but you're already gone

I'd love to watch you fall, but you're already gone

Burn, black smoke fills the sky
You bring the wicked out of me, your killer is I
[Esham]
I'd love to watch you fall, but you're already gone
