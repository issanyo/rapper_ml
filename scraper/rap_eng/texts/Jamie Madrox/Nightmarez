[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
In the dark of the night
In the midst of a dream or a nightmare
Where nobody can hear you scream
As you find to awake from your sleep
And you shake in your bed
In the dream and the evil is creepin', crawlin'
I keep callin'
Out for some help but I feel like I’m fallin'
Can I get up and shake off the nightmare
But when I look in the mirror it’s in front of me, right there
Starin' at me with those eyes again
Only gettin' harder and harder to try to pretend
Everything is just okay, I’m sad and lonely
Alive with nothin' left to say

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
Why is this happenin' to me again
I’m reachin' for reasons I can never send
Demons to hell where they belong
And all along I’m wanting you to (Help me)
To get up I’m falling back into bed
I reach and the gun is pressed to my head
I’m hesitant and not sure I want this to end
These nightmares, they just want me dead

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I’m an anomaly
And I’m mad as the demons course in my feelin's
In the form of human beings
All sorts of us are kind of a family
While they're dreamin', it’s happenin'
But differ it from the mad, it ain’t insanity
I’m constantly battlin' in the mirror with the chatter
I disappear into a standard misconception
Where they’re really nothin' more than a fraction
(I feel) It ain’t nobody but Twiztid down here
Feel like I’m always livin' in a nightmare
Cause even when I open my eyes the evil is right there
So they say that I’m outta my ample livin'
Unforgiven like a bottle with his chick and motherfuckin' mind

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Darkness surrounds me and terror, it drowns me
I cannot breathe (cannot leave)
Wake me up (let me leave)
Open my eyes, closed, so why won’t they open?
I try but can’t focus cause everything’s hopelessness
Everything’s hopeless and everything’s black
So wake me up, bring me back
Wake me up, bring me back
Everything’s hopeless and everything’s black
So wake me up, bring me back
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up…

[Hook]
Why is this happenin' to me again
I’m reachin' for reasons I can never send
Demons to hell where they belong
And all along I’m wanting you to (Help me…)
