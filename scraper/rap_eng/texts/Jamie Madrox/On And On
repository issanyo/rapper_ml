[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Cause I'm trying to be me and being like them ain't easy
Hoping that someone out there understands
And they all want me to lay down
But I'd rather stand for something, I'm someone
Feel the whole world is in my hands

And it keep me going
On and on, and on and on, and on and on
Until I'm dead
And it keeps on going
On and on, and on and on, and on and on
Until I'm dead

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Sad thing is, is they don't want to hear positive
They'd rather die than to learn to try to live
Take more time to blame than time to forgive
Some lose their ways, others just become too sensitive
Gotta be strong - You see, evil, it love the weak
Put your tongue in a submission hold, make you afraid to speak
Spitting controversy, walking through picket lines
With both middle fingers of mine raised real high
Call it the sign of the times, I'm blessed with the sudden change
Outside the curriculum of my character range
I'm a lot off kilt, so they liken to call me strange
Telling me that if we die the game will never be the same

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
They call Jamie, "Batman"
Then I make any boy wonder
How can we survive on the top
When all this ground is sitting under
Raining without the thunder
Bear and amongst the tundra
And the only answer I can give is we some bad motherfuckers
And I came here to make clear
We're no blurred lines, an assertive time
And I've earned mine like I worked crime
And the first time when I bursted rhyme like a hearse ride
You heard I'm homicide in a verse
Riling and I'm high like a bird's eye
Hear we go with a third try
Rolling like a berzerk diet
With fifty sides on to hurt, find
It's me against the world, I
Walk around and get cursed by
People cause I got the dirt, grime
And I wish a motherfucker wouldn't mind
Whether anybody want to die tonight

[Hook]
