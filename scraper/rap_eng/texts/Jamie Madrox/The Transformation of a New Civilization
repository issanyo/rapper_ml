Mutant genes cross-splice as horrible creatures of the night
Devour and feed on any cowards in sight
Apocalyptic grin, there's a monster coming out from within
Eyes change from white to black and crimson
Sickness pumps through the arteries as hunger starts to take control
And swallows what's left of your soul
Go you feeling like a creep
As you catch a glance of your reflection
In the puddles of blood from beneath your feet
Don't look again cause you might die from fright
You might see something so scary that you block your sight
You can't control your impulses
The hunger is overcoming everything
Nerves are twitching
And your heands are constantly shaking
Follow the herds with hundreds crawling the streets
Feeding for thirst some are hurting so bad they only scream
Like you will when that day comes if you can just stay calm
You might make it through the transformation of civilization

A new civilization has been reborn
The fall out caused man to become deformed
Open sores on our arms and our legs
Looking like they've been infected with a horrible plague

Washed ashore
Face buried in about six inches or more
And my reflection, horrified and inside
I can feel it, it ain't right
And i think i might of died
Just spotted so i raise both hands
And god it would be good if they can help me understand
Running towards me and its all pretty blurry
But i can tell their all coming in a hurry
And i stand up
Ran up a little further so i can get a better look at whatever
It is am i on sedatives
Can't control it so im running like a zombie
People all around me and im thinking
Let the monster out
The sight of me is so disturbinly distorted
That ya conscience can't afford to let it breathe so its aborted
Am i the product of a cloning gone wrong
Created trhough all the breedings of a social crosswalk

A new civilization has been reborn
The fall out caused man to become deformed
Open sores on our amrs and our legs
Looking like theyve been infected with a horrible plague
A new civilization has been reborn
The fall out caused man to become deformed
Eat the living to survive the pain
Because the hunger is the ohly thought inside your brain
