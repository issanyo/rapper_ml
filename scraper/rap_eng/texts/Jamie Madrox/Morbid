[Verse 1: Violent J]
I was eight years old and morbid
Did as I was told, so morbid
Since way back then, I’ve hated cops
I got one in my trunk, now I'm morbid
I sleep in a coffin, morbid
With a dead body in it, more morbid
I make love to this stiff
Her butt, I sniff it
Gettin' high, right out of this orbit

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
That loom in my eyes, now that’s morbid
Kidnap her with knives, so morbid
Cut her into pieces, ahh that’s morbid
Then I’ll make her meat as white, now that’s morbid
I’m not a creature, right, I’m morbid
I can delete your life, now that's morbid
Follow him to speak for awhile, that's morbid
Hit em with the cleaver style, now that's morbid

[Hook x2: Dark Lotus]
My gruesome fascination become
My daily occupation
Which brings us to this situation your
(Morbid murder! Morbid murder!)

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Every thought conceived is morbid
When I stab you, bleed that's morbid
Live by assassins creed, it's morbid
When you don't believe I'll get morbid
The stank on my breath is morbid
Dried blood on my chest, that's morbid
Only bones has left, it’s morbid
I'm the angel of death, I'm morbid

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I collect dead things, that's morbid
Wear their bones as rings, that’s morbid
Bathe in their blood, that's morbid
Do it for the love and that's morbid
I love to kill and that's morbid
Still here to thrill in this morbid
Please no more pills in this morbid
Don't no what's real and it's morbid

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
Super glued my dickhole shut, that's morbid
Razor blade open it back up, still morbid
Piss a blood in a mouth of a slut, now that's morbid
Slit her neck, direct this final cut, hella morbid
Heinous, creepy, deranged, insane, I'm morbid
Coat hanger scratching my metal plate, still morbid
Finger painting "help" on the window pane, that’s morbid
Play with dead bodies like I'm insane, now that's morbid

[Verse 6: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I'm addicted to pain, so morbid
Let's go get the chain, so morbid
I'm dangling again, so morbid
Lotus in black rain, so morbid
Need more body parts, so morbid
Blood splatter is art, so morbid
Diseases starts to spread, it's morbid
Till everyone’s dead, it’s morbid

[Hook x2]
