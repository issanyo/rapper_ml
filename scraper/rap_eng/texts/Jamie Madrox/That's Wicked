"The daring daylight escape of the two convicted murderers, dope pushers, crossed the lines of two prison guards, and surprisingly, the life of a German Shepherd."
"Yeah I've seen guys with their heads cut off, blown up, burnt, shot, stabbed, poisoned, hanged, run over by trains, cars blown off, I mean fucking you name it, I've seen it."

We assumed you wanted our official apologies, along with the body


[Madrox]
Keep it wicked like six witches, five skulls in one kettle
Let it boil till it scorch and burn the instrumental
Fever kill, we the hottest, your temperature has been arised
As we take these microphones and then blacken up both your eyes

[Monoxide]
I got an axe in my hand, bitch, when I don't chatter
From the talking in my head telling me to make the blood splatter
Climbing up a ladder and I hang em on a hook
Diabolical on every life I took

Travel underground in the fire like hellspawn
And possess a motherfucker to murder ya on ya lawn
Pick up a cellphone tell the devil you coming home
But I keep getting disconnected cause my minds on roam
Everybody dies when your fucking with psychos
All alone at midnight, might slice your throat

[Madrox]
Sick and deranged words are irrelevant
Knife cuts clean through the skin to the skeleton
Consistent like residual whores
Like them wicked wannabe's with flyers and bloody corpse
We stay eternal vampiric when you hear it
As it seeping through the speakers, trying to grab hold of your spirit

[Monoxide]
Split tongue, sick one, I'll spit some
Moonlight with shadows of lost souls and victims
Parish in the heart of my darkness
I'm heartless and I don't have a concious to start with
I'm marked with an X as a symbol of greatness
To hate this will only explain all of your fakeness
Watch me blaze this place with the strike of a match
And disappear in the form of a bat

[Madrox]
The wicked's keep it vertigo
Control and the horizontal and vertical
On the path of the pinnacle of my sinister ritiual
I'm dangerous, repetitious like Déjà Vu
Meaning I've been here before and already know what I'mma do
Falling fast, the furious wins
Seeing faces on the wall laced with hideous grins
Eyes blinking at me, lips moving, counting the sins
A million arms at the bottom are waving me all in

THAT'S WICKED
