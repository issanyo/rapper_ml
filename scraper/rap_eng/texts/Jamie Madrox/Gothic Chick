[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I fell in love with a gothic chick
And she gave me everything that she was
So dark just like her clothes
How could I know, I love her and then let her go
Oh no, I fell in love with a gothic chick it was fate you can see
Oh no, I love her but she will never love me

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
She had the Betty Page vibe
Kat Von D tattoos around her eyes with the (real big thighs)
So I'm like I could get it on with a vampire wearin' a thong
Shakin' them titties that you wanna put your mouth on (dammmn)
Suckable, fuckable, lovable, touchable she had piercings in both her nipples
That shit stay hard right? Like me
She bent over I seen her thong had a playboy bunny
I'm like look here honey I'm into Crow and all that shit
I was standing out here watchin' you shoppin at hot topic
I love your style, is you an actress or somethin?
Have you ever been up in films is it up for discussion
I'm in [?], I like to video tape
Hot bitches gettin it horror bound, I love your face
It's cinematic, I'll keep you more prick than a cactus
Let's go to your crib and stain a mattress

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Her pale skin is so white
I'm hypnotized by the sight of her moonlight eyes
Vampire bites are tatted on her right thigh
And a scar on her wrist to remember the suicide try
She's got a 10 gauge in ears and a post in her clit
She likes rough sex and bumpin emo music
Well I'm a rough neck, I got the rep to prove it
There's no less, no way that she could be substited
(But I know) I'm not her type and my mind is so diluted that I'm blind
And if she was heroin I would shoot it
A stop sign at most but for her I'm goin through it
I'm backwards, jumpin through hoops and lookin stupid
Cupid shot an arrow and it pierced my eye
Because I can't help but stare everytime she walk by
One day maybe I'll get the nerve to try
But right now I couldn't handle rejection and she'd die

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jamie Madrox]
She's such a freek
Hey baby why don't you do it to me
Show me how it could be if I roll with you
She's such a creep
Hey baby I don't care what they say
I love you anyway don't go change for me
