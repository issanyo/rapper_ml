Blasted at enemies that walk behind me
An don’t bop line an chalk that’s so costly
It ain’t over if a fat bitch sing
I put two good between her eyes and brain
A red rain from the sky before she take the final look of her life
The next time she’ll let the monsters by
Let the bullet from your guns all fly
Cuz I've been bleeding through this hole in my life for some time
Feeling like I'm needing some rocks to crack pipe
To release my addiction of watchin the whack die
Sittin watchin track like a train pass by
To the spirit that I'm drivin inside I'm that guy
That your neva gonna stop, Why the fuck yall try?
Steady one by one, I'm in all of your lives
I come up like the sun an not a day goes by
That I don’t grab my gun an make my way through life

[Hook x4]
I can't stop
I won't stop
Till I drop
You’re never getting rid of me

I could never be remorseful for crossful actions
Steppin in like a preview it's my common attraction
And take action, no more sittin on the side lines
Review when the guidelines an bitches so blind
I ain't buyin an I see it in the eyes an it ain't need this
A cold ass world if you ain't following the needed decisions
Just like a fork in the road
Dig it up, grab your nuts, an hit the road an never come home
We on a mission the operation is risky
With Twiztid as a factor that option is fifty-fifty
One thing my daddy taught me 'fore he passed away
Was to respect myself an never give a fuck what people say
At what they like or what they hate
Do it cuz you feel it in your heart
An if it's real they gon' feel it from the start
If your dreams fall apart let your memories carry
Into the grave digger will come with the shovel and then burry you

Can we please see hands for those in the path
That wanna meet me in the pits of a blood bath
An outcast to outlast the forecast in the weather
To storm fast an chop an screwed your whole program
Franchise was on your pink slip
An you've been trottin bitches on your way to meetin Jesus
Believe this, retreat is your life now
Bring it all down to the ground an meet your lifestyle
