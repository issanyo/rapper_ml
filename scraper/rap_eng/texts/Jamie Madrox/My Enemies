[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
The devil ain't got no brains
In the form of fury I'mma smash em
Dance with the wicked embrace
Gotta look into his eyes before I blast em
Cuz I'm a lost soul with nowhere to go in the flame
Took me a while to come to conclusions but I made it
Pitchfork, gotta get faster, further away, ain't got no time
Flip to the grip that I just can't slip
Two steps ahead always one behind
Gotta watch your mind up until you die
Gotta prove yourself, never true as I am
Don't be surprised when I pull the knife
On his Adam's apple, gonna take his life

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
(Enemies)
Give this pain to my enemies
I'm back in search of enemies
Can I be saved
Or am I just doomed to fall?
Sick and deranged
Hell bent on killing them all

[Bridge: Jamie Madrox]
Something ain't right in my head today
Searching for words so I can try to explain
Why sometimes I act out in vain
No torturing myself over their shit
I put them deep in their graves
I put them deep in their graves
I put them deep in their graves
I put them deep in their graves
I put them deep in their graves

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I hope to dance with the devil before he's put in the grave
But Jamie got em before I could even blow out a flame
Time that I heard it from me couple of times
Now how could I keep living with myself after they died
I'll try it again, hoping I can fit in with them
But I know it never works, it never does, so not again
Machine-like, not a conscience that you can find
But a dream like the motherfucking killer that's in my mind
Grab an axe and hack away wish it was a holiday
And once a year we get to kill our enemies and celebrate

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
I'm standing here emotionless
I'm just roaming the Earth in search of all your hopelessness
I wouldn't stand too close to this
A quick move will set it off have me going for your throats and shit

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
One by one we'll get you all
And when you fall and yes you will
There's pins and needles everywhere
Throughout me from the thrill kill
Give this hurt and all this pain, it's sharper than the sharpest knives
So stab it in their forehead, in their face, and in their wind pipe

[Hook]
