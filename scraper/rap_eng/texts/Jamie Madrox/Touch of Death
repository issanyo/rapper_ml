(Chorus)
The touch of death is coming, there's nowhere to escape
Your life is slowly fading into your hollow grave
You can not be saved
You can not be saved

(Blaze)
There was once a man that couldn't die
In fact to this day that man is still alive
He lives in the cosmos on the edge of time
Little kids have heard of him, in nursery rhymes (he's the dead)
But he walks among society carrying a sickle and a shotgun
With a touch of death, and death's hands
He's a young, dying, unstoppable, dead man, you'll know

(Chorus)
The touch of death is coming
You'll know
There's nowhere to escape
You'll know
Your life is slowly fading
You'll know
Into your hollow grave
You'll know
You can not be saved
You can not be saved
When death is upon us, come with me right now, and don't be afraid

I've been alive for many centuries
Watched new kings replace old kings
Seen empires overthrown with war
Disease and sickness, for rich or poor
Armies form and prepare to fight
Damn what a battle it lasted twenty nights
19 days, 12 B.C. to think nobody ever heard of me
I'm in the afterlife that's where I grew
Watched a whole lot on a thang or two
Come to find out their afraid of you
If you don't die exactly the way they do
They knew I wasn't right from the start
With jet-black blood to match my black heart
Found out quick that the world was cold
'Fore anyone even had a soul, understand

(Chorus)
The touch of death is coming, understand
There's nowhere to escape, understand
Your life is slowly fading, understand
Into your hollow grave, understand
You can not be saved
You can not be saved
When death is upon us, come with me right now, and don't be afraid

Colton Grundy past life experience
Different time my friend, delirious
All of those memories just blur together
So understand sometimes I don't know no better
But I'm kcab (back)
But I really ain't go nowhere
I sit here surrounded in dark countin' dead
Looking for someone to give this pain too
Looking for someone to feel the way that I do, like me

(Chorus)
The touch of death is coming
Like me
There's nowhere to escape
Like me
Your life is slowly fading
Like me
Into your hollow grave
Like me
You can not be saved
You can not be saved
When death is upon us come with me right now and don't be afraid

Hey man! He done f**ked yo' ride up!
