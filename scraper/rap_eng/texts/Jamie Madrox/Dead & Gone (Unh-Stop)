[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Uh, from the dark side of the night time I'll be creeping
Nocturnal child of the night, day time come I'm asleep then
In the six feet deep holding the Earth literally speaking
I'm underground with the glowing eyes and demon not leaving
My soul right here is not for the eating
These voices are taking the price
Of my life within reach of a butcher knife
You know how to kill them right
Stop asking me questions
If I can get out all the voices and ignoring any suggestions
Sick and I'm about to clean the blood from all the bodies
With nine inch knife, threading needles and [?]
Never one DVD, face paint, kill kill, kill shit
Psychopathic lunatic
Hole in this head of mine
Won't you leave me alone tonight
I ain't looking for a fight
I'm just trying to get high or get drunk
Now somebody dead in the front seat
And the trunk and the side coming of car

[Pre-Hook: Twiztid]
With their blood soaked faces and my hateful glowing eyes
(And just the sight of them can make you feel paralyzed)
When the night turns day
Time to change back to your other disguise
(You hear them echoing, these voices got you hypnotized)

[Hook: Twiztid]
Don't Stop! Telling me to kill them!
Unh-Stop! Showing me the victim!
Why!? Why won't you leave me alone?
If I could kill you then you would be dead and gone
Don't Stop! Telling me to kill them!
Unh-Stop! Showing me the victim!
Why!? Why won't you leave me alone?
If I could kill you then you would be dead and gone

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I got to paint floor, give me the chainsaw
Looking to maim all of people who late call
Laugh when the day falls
I'm not a killer but I'm coming from same cloth
That's any serial killer get name off
Please don't let me out of bedroom tonight
Regardless of what I say or what I sound like
I got a head full of murder and violence I can't control
And a mind full of voice that are telling me where to go
I'll end up in your bedroom with my hand around your throat
And what happens after that, well you know
Bodies obliterated, chopped up, incinerated
Not a single trace, all completly eliminated
Not sure why that happens but the voices are telling me
To keep on chop, hack and stab it
And I really can't believe it
I haven't been caught in the action
I just want it all to leave
It gets worse when you're asking
It's my fatal attraction

[Pre-Hook: Twiztid]
With their blood soaked faces and my hateful glowing eyes
(And just the sight of them can make you feel paralyzed)
When the night turns day time
You change back to your other disguise
(You hear them echoing, these voices got you hypnotized)

[Hook: Twiztid]
Don't Stop! Telling me to kill them!
Unh-Stop! Showing me the victim!
Why!? Why won't you leave me alone?
If I could kill you then you would be dead and gone
Don't Stop! Telling me to kill them!
Unh-Stop! Showing me the victim!
Why!? Why won't you leave me alone?
If I could kill you then you would be dead and gone
