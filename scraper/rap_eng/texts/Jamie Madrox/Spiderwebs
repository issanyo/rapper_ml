[Intro: Monoxide]
She was a type of girl
Get me in so much trouble
Head over heels in this
That' why I love her

[Verse 1: Monoxide (Jamie Madrox)]
(I don't like the way that she talks to me
When she tells me those things that I rather not hear in my ear
But they're comin' out her mouth and they're HD clear)
She don't like the way that I talk when
I'm sayin' that I'm walking out the door
With no remorse for this and now she's pissed
(I don't think she loves me but attraction aside
Of the fact I'm ugly and the look in her eyes when
She takin her clothes off and we're treated
Like a washing machine to drop a load off)
She don't think that I give a fuck to care
But I'd rather die
But the truth of the matter its all a lie
And I can't get her outta my mind I'm so blind

[Hook]
I'm tangled in the spiderwebs and can't get out
It's like you're breakin' my heart when you open your mouth
It's like you're so excited when you're bringin' me down
Bringing me down
Bringing me down
Bringing me down

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox (Monoxide)]
I don't like the way that she flirts
With mini skirts and tight shirts
And we're drinkin' at the local bar
And she givin' everybody the fuck me eyes
(She don't like the way I'm obsessed
And why's she wearing that dress man
Need to cover her breasts and maybe
They'll leave her alone)
I don't like the way she's so care free
Those who knows where don't call me
The condoms in the drawer ain't there
No more so she must be cheating
(She hates when I keep calling her cell phone
Like I got thrown in jail holmes
And all I really want is the four digit number
To her voicemail passcode)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox (Monoxide)]
I don't like the way that she left me
Strung me along and upset me
Broke my heart in two
And like a trophy she kept me
(She don't like the fact that I won't leave
Calling the police on me
Why you actin' so phoney
Like you don't know me baby)

[Hook x2]
