[Monoxide]
See, motherfuckers don't wanna listen
Nobody understands that, without sacrifice, there's nothing worthy
You see what I'm sayin'?
Nobody understands that
They just wanna do what they wanna do

[Random Guy]
Right, Right

[Monoxide]
And um, live their life how they wanna do it
They don't wanna give nothin' up, you know?
Oooh shit, me, I'd give it all up, if it's worth it...
Why you looking at me like that?

[Random Guy]
Motherfucker, I wanna hit that joint

[Monoxide]
OH! My bad, shit I'm just kickin' it to you, here you go

[Random Guy]
Let me get the joint Tommy Chong

[Monoxide]
Tellin' you how I'm feelin

[Random Guy]
I'm just tryin' to get high like you

[Monoxide]
I hear you baby, well there you go, I'm just tryin' to say
That it's getting to a point where mother fuckers gotta do something
Instead of just sitting there, you gotta get off your ass and do something
Don't talk about it, be about it, that's how the fuck I'm feelin'
