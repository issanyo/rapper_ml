Mixed up and I'm so confused
I'm getting aggravated with a really short fuse
And I'm having a conversating to show my cooperation
They drag me to the station
And they ask me about the time and place and
I think they know I did it
The evidence shows I did it
They keep on asking me for the body
But I forget where I hid it
I get these black out spells
And I don't remember much
But I'm always at the police station
Every time that I wake up
They're yelling louder now
The night has turned to dawn
They said if I don't know him
How the fuck did I have his sweater on
They handed me a folder
And told me to look inside
These pictures had me in them
And they put me at the scene of the crime
And when I touched them all
These visions came flashing back
And I can see me standing behind
I'm about to swing an axe
And when he falls
I see my body collapse
And now that's all I remember
I'm just stating the facts

Change me, never wanna hate me
All are gonna pray for the day that our worlds collide
Save me
We like to keep it crazy ruthless 'til it blows your brain
We're not the average and that's why the call us strange
Change me, hate me

[Madrox]
Oh the way the body reacts
Sometimes as if there is no relaxing
See the reaction, feel the impulse
That runs through the body and stumbles across
It crept inside of my head
And a holy man pulled it up out of my mind
Thinking of loving and constantly hating
Consuming us all the time
I'm worse if no better with pages and letters
That change into words and become angel feathers
I past upon broken wings hoping the open
Then giving them wings to fly
Away to the sky for a new piece of mind
A chance to move forward while falling behind
The time to get right, no more just getting by
Do or do not, there's no reason to try
Let it subside, I'm letting you know
That things get mixed up like an antidote
Take control of your body and soul
And swipe it all for miracles
And even if your mind's confused
Then this is what you need to do
You need to get that mixed up feeling
Upside and from out of you
I fell to the earth and got back up
And shook that shit off eagerly
I took a step and jumped to the heavens
But my ups are humanly
Angelie to the center
But surrounded by society
And all the while and everyone
Is watching me so quietly

Considered by many people
To be the equal of the anti-christ
But those are the people of old generations
Filling my life with bad advice
Can he be right
Well I guess I find out when I'm on the mic
Press conference in the pentagon quick
But still can't stop this child of the night
Anonymous like a letter of anthrax
Just to get my point across, I derailed an amtrak
Fine line between genius, going through it
And some one who's just doing it to prove that he's a lunatic
Which one am I
Well I won't know until I die
Won't know until I'm walking on down
Or floating in the sky
Why should I be the same lame game
You're use to
I'd rather say some shit
That'll burn a hole right through you
I'm stranger than a stranger
Knocking on the door
In danger of himself
And he's asking you for help
And of course you turn your back on
Anything a little different
And that's why the aliens you saw
Never exsisted
