[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Are you afraid of the dark and things that only walk at night?
Well if I was only all bark, then you would never fear my bite
I'm pulsating in a strange and erratic fashion, I'm waiting what happens tragic
Events keep on flashing I need to choke someone
My teeth do poke little holes inside your blood vein
Celebrate the life of the dead and call it Samhein

[Verse 2: Madrox]
I got the feeling
Got the craving of an animal
Clothes covered in blood from necks that I sample
I dismantle and rip bodies in half
Vaporize into a bat and slip through cracks where you stay at
You can't escape the fate of deep red
Unleash the blood fountain from decapitated heads
Little children lay awake in bed
In sheer terror and grief
There's a vampire watching from the ceiling when they sleep

[Hook x2]
Nosferatu
Is more than a vampire (Yea)
Shocking my victims
Just like a live wire
Body falls to the ground
Hear the screams of terror and pain
You can call it your life
But I might just take it away

[Verse 3: Madrox]
I got the teeth as sharp as Ginsu's
My species is Nosferatu
I got one eye, it's red like R2d2
I spot you, release my wings through downward sky
Landing in the park, to make the pigeons fly
I don't know why, but some of the times
I feel my status is a curse
Out living mortal life
Condemned roaming the earth for what it's worth
My birthday I turned a thousand-twentysix
Stood before the sun to evade an eclipse
Press your lips to your finger tips
Don't say a word, look into my eyes
See no sesire goes unheard
Got to feed every twenty-four hours to keep my powers
As I sit atop the gothic towers watching cataclysmic showers
Blood is sour, bitter sweet, thick and bland
And when it dries it turns brown beneath the fingers on my hand
My shadow's dense
I scale the cyclone fence
Shadows of the moon light
Make me feel so intense (Ahhhhhhh)
Lash my teeth deep into your veins
Draining your existence until your body's slain
Some call it deranged, it's insane how I got you
I leave two marks in your neck
That's the sign of Nosferatu

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Darkness
It's time to wreck shit
Peep the perspective
Bram Stoker's Dracula can't fuck with Hektik
Inject it, I keep your jugular veins bumping
Making your body sway
As I sit back and relax sipping on DNA
Plasmic, my style is fan-tazi-migroic
Roaming around like a vagabond creeping through forests
Nobody notice, I'm inside when you invite me
You wanna spite me, bring it on somebody try me
Panic zone freezing you up scared as fuck
Now sacrificially I will induct
Go seek and find is what my origin believes
Until you bleed
My hunger thirst just like a seed
Feel my soul, look to roll in out of sight
Nosferatu out of control
Creeping at night!

[Hook x2]
