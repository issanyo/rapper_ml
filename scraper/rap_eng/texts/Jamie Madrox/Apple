[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I'm a product of buck slips and cut wrists
Rambunctious, when I feel like I'm getting fucked with
My wits connecting prophets to a light switch
One flip permanent night bitch
Fuck with me and I can swallow your soul
And watch rap gods grease like green bags of bill folds
All outta control like an addict gotta blow
Tragic, cause the medicine I need I can't afford
Maybe I should pay a visit to his home
Somebody tell the president I'm on his fucking lawn
Too far gone to be fixed I'll and outdated it
Like a trace that I'll open this up to make me feel better

[Hook]
The president loathes me
The government hates me
They taxing me
And they stealing food from the babies
We on a slippy slope but they know we can't afford it, right?
I'm bout to kill a mother fucker tonight
Let me say, your dopeness tolerates influence on your life
And we play it like Adam and Eve
And take the first bite

[Verse 2: Madrox]
So sinful, better believe this
Me and my brother have returned just like Jesus
So peaceful, not a people
We raise hell, so they assume that we're evil
I probably could go out and get an education
If a teacher could hold a job for 15 seconds
In this fucked up economy, stripping me butt naked
Of all the money I make, they be take taking it
But ain't shit better though (Nope, no it's not)
Just a little bit deeper in the debt we done
Just a little bit closer to the ultimate fear
Where you get one phone call to try and post bail

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[Monoxide]
Don't watch society and what it became
If not us than who the pass to blame

[Madrox]
I betcha feel any shame at the thangs that you see on TV

[Monoxide]
Cause your earth bound heaven is still a pipe dream

[Madrox]
What do I have to do
When the plates on the table

[Monoxide]
But plates with no food
While lone ass people gotta go back to school

[Madrox]
Pass the point of working overtime to pay dues
This is your future
See it and behold the life time of debt and enormous work load

[Monoxide]
Past on to you only and it's courtesy of us
Another trigger in the negative in God we trust

[Hook]
