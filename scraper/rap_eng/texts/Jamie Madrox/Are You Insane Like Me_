[Hook]
Tell me are you out of your mind?
Are you really fucking out of your mind?
Tell me are you out of your mind?
(Are you insane like me!?)
Tell me are you out of your mind?
Are you really fucking out of your mind?
Tell me are you out of your mind?
(Are you just like me!?)

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
It's nothing better, we are the bloodlusting soul bearers
That were raised in disugust
And we don't scare we evoke terror
Mayhem's a must, there's ain't no smokebox or hoax mirrors
Turn your life to dust
Like you should have never been born here
I feel like murdering hurts so what I'm certain
Uncontrollable urges keep flirting under my skull
I keep rusty butcher knife and a gun
And when it's squirting I just fall in love again with the blood
Randomly blurred, now these curses are some kind of a talk
There's voodoo in all these verses if you listen close enough
Raw!

[Hook]
Tell me are you out of your mind?
Are you really fucking out of your mind?
Tell me are you out of your mind?
(Are you insane like me!?)
Tell me are you out of your mind?
Are you really fucking out of your mind?
Tell me are you out of your mind?
(Are you just like me!?)

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
My brain is static so I'm like fucking automatic
I'ma grab a fucking butcher knife and cause some real havoc
I got a problem, my thoughts are causing a lot of mess
I probably should be sedated and not upset
There's constant blast of bloodbath and occult witchcraft
Images that blast before my eyes end in trash
You've ever danced with the Devil?
No, but I cut off his head 'till I woke up in my bed
Was wet and covered with red
Sick, psychotic, busting mirrors and broken logic
Now I'm addicted to killing and blood's like a narcotic

[Hook]
Tell me are you out of your mind?
Are you really fucking out of your mind?
Tell me are you out of your mind?
(Are you insane like me!?)
Tell me are you out of your mind?
Are you really fucking out of your mind?
Tell me are you out of your mind?
(Are you just like me!?)

[Bridge]
Sometimes it's all too much
I feel like ripping and cutting
And blood that splatters is easing the pain in my head again
They say that I've lost touch
I push the way in the world
They say I was dead to them
I wish I could die and let them in

Are you crazy just like me?
Are you crazy just like me?
Are you crazy just like me?
Are you crazy just like me?
Are you crazy just like me?

[Hook]
Tell me are you out of your mind?
Are you really fucking out of your mind?
Tell me are you out of your mind?
(Are you insane like me!?)
Tell me are you out of your mind?
Are you really fucking out of your mind?
Tell me are you out of your mind?
(Are you just like me!?)
