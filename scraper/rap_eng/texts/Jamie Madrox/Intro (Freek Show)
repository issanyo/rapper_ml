[Jamie Madrox]
Behind this gate is a place
A damp dark place
Where sunlight does not shine
A place where people who are different
Can call home
And what home would be complete without a family?
A family of hideous abominations
That will cast out of your world
The world that brags and boasts of love
The world didn't love when they branded us freekshows
Ahh yes, the deplorable little name we embraced the night
It was you that turned your back on them
And now their going to rip your soul apart
There's no way out now
The mutation process has already begun
Just like that
Whether you change or decompose is no concern to me now
You've been warned
My job is done
Welcome to the FREEKSHOW.....
