[Jamie Madrox]
When you slip into reality
Hoes wanna straddle me
Player haters wanna battle me
But I shed em' all like calories
Prophecy preacher, lend your ear and I'll reach ya
And if your willing to be taught I'mma teach ya
I'm not a people person, truth is I can't stand too many people
So many fake the funk and perpetrate and call me evil
But evil is a harsh word
Tell the mockingbird that I said it
A man of my word I won't regret it
If I let it get to me like it get to them I'm no better
The same message over and over with different set-up
Player hating is a art of a scandalous and shafty person
Some do it oh so well I'll be damned if they don't rehearse it
Disperse it to people like me and you everyday
And they expect the common man to turn his cheek and walk away
And now I pray for an end of the madness
No more sadness
? to my people that preside to be the baddest
And all that they do and say
But overshadowed by a cloud turning night to day
Its so tremendous that you couldn't even walk away
If you chose to, you even suppose to watch the ones you close  to, now that's insane
Tell me will it change, I'm confused
Not a thing to lose
This shit is far from positive and saddens like the Blues
Paying dues ain't the only part of duties that bestow to the chosen
Spitting lyrics in the microphone and
Dodging player haters till my temper hit the ceiling
And this how they got a nigga feelin
I done fell into reality

[Hook 1x]
My renditions of reality
Call it bad or good
Wrong or Right
Note! Believe in me
Believe in me
And I believe in you
Everything is alright

One day it's goin hit me like a ton of bricks
I'm feeling so sick
One of my dogs passed and shit
I'm feeling like killing 'em all
But whats that solve?
He's still goin be dead in the morning
Why take the fall?
Inside I be so mad I'm finna burst
Instead of Chevy's, my homies rolling in the back of a hearse
You know what's worse?
It's too hard to cope with some days
Murderous ways
Leaving me shaking in a daze
Comatose, completely tore up
Nerves be so bad I wanna throw up
I'm 'bout to blow up
In a rage, I need to talk nobody wanna listen
On the corner, murder mind state condition
Overload, pull the trigger
Stress got the best of suicide, pour out some liquor
Another grave digger gets paid
Digging our grave for senseless ways
Keep to ourselves and stay paid
All of my dogs can't die, I visit the sky
And reminisce when I'm high
I'm never goin lie
I got love for peoples, dead or alive
Or we can smoke out in the ride in my memory

[Hook 1x]
Reality is just a fragment
A fragment inside of my soul
My eyes are closed
My head is spinning
My head is spinning
I swear to god I don't know

[Jamie Madrox]
This is a musical masterpiece dedicated to down riders
Keep it in your clique, fuck the outsiders
People hating on everything and everything's the same
Everybody is a player and life is a silly game
It's a damn shame
Daddy died 11 years today
I wonder if he know I'm doing straight
Could you tell him something if you see my pops before I do?
Let him know that he's remembered by my crew
And everyday, in my mind, anyplace, anytime
Looking in the sky for the seventh sign

[Monoxide Child]
I walk around, nobody knows what I do
Sealin' fates and date rapes
As my body transcends through this portal of life
Smoking blunts, wronging my rights
I live for the night because I melt in the light
Completely outta site
For facts so unknown
So grotesque never stated on microphones
So alone in this fucked up world, it sucks dick
Everybody got a problem with something and you can bet
I be the last one, more like the last dragon
No swords to ever let this world contort
The way you're thinking, it's so essential
It gives us all the potential
To take over the world in our mentals
If I can't live my life the way I wanna live my life
Then why can't I die?
Why can't I die?

My renditions of reality
Bad or good
Wrong or Right
Believe in me, I believe in you
Rendition of reality
Alright, Note

Bad or good, wrong or right
Believe in me and I'll believe in you and everything's tight
Reality is a fragment inside my soul
My eyes are closed, head's spinning and I don't know
It's just reality, bad or good, wrong or right
Believe in me and I'll believe in you and everything's tight
Reality is a fragment inside my soul
My eyes are closed, head's spinning and I don't know
And I don't know...
