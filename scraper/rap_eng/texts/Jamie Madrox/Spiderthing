[Verse 1: Blaze]
It's disgusting when I transform into
Something beyond frightening in the naked eye
Logic you can try transposed
Set my skin and exposed
It through the nature of the being
And the creature that's inclosed
(Don't call me arachnophobic)
Call my Arachnia-insane
I've stolen a couple of arms
Still I maintain
In my brain you're already caught up in my weapon
And your body is prepared for the bloodletting

[Verse 2: The R.O.C.]
I connect when you stick to this
You can't escape the bite of the eight-legged vicious
So fuck you punk bitches I got a new edition
And the seven thorns stanched from my chest makes me the sickest

[Verse 3: Madrox]
I'm a predator none like you've ever seen in your life
More arms, more cutting and choking it feels right
More hands reaching around to strangle out your life
And they wonder why the spider web is wove so tight

[Hook x2]
I'm a spiderthing I'm becoming something
Far from amazing sick and disgusting
You wouldn't want to get caught in my web
You wouldn't want to get caught in the web of a spider

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Walk on eight legs and they keep callin' me freak
I'm always creepin' really low looking for flesh to eat
And I can spin webs they say I'm problematic
Gettin' caught in my arachniatic type static
Tragic how the poison will travel straight to your brain
And will ravel you with the pain that rattles your everything
The gallows are about the pain look at me as I hang
Like suicidalists who couldn't handle being strange

[Verse 5: Madrox]
My fascination is growing exploding into an ocean of dreams
Nothing is ever as it seems
And I believe with the power of arachnid
With the web I could weave no one could ever escape that
In fact I was toying with the notion of becoming
A black widow tarantula spider something
I be cutting at the elbows sewing up my torso
Appendages needle and thread muscle and bone

[Hook x2]

[Verse 6: The R.O.C.]
My legs move faster than yours but still I let you through
My webs they criss they cross
The more you squirm the more energy it costs
My spider senses tell me that you ready to go
I leave too slow poralisis took control
Now you can't move I got you right where I want you to be
Now your mind body and soul belongs to me

[Verse 7: Blaze]
Bite like a white widow
Spew venom to paralyze
And wrap you in my web just like a spider would a fly
Drain your blood until you die and keep your body for a feast
And once I get a taste the cravings only increase

[Verse 8: Monoxide]
(Now) Maintain the preying
Pull up anybody who's running away
Tell them that today is the day
I got sixteen eyes and all of them on you
So move slow is all you motherfuckers want to do

[Hook x3]
