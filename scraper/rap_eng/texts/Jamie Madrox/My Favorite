[Intro: Jamie Madrox]
Man I've been smoking this shit for so long
I done smoke shit you can't even pronounce
Shit like grevillea
You ever smoke grevillea?
You ain't never smoked that shit
That shit is 800 an ounce
My muthafuckin homeboy rollin' up two joints in the back and we gone

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
First time I snatched you up, I took you in my lungs
I sealed you up, I licked you with my tongue
Right then and there I knew you was the one
So I sold my stereo and copped the whole barn yard
Blowin' smoke rings, big money bring nice trees
But my addiction left my pockets lookin' shiesty
I robbed the store, pawn diamonds and gold
Going through my mama's purse like I was 10 years old
Lookin' in the couch for a dollar to aid me on the bag
Some of them bitches had jobs and they lit it like fags
Bitch I'm unemployed and I still brought five
And have a green leaf in the glovebox outside
We can roll it in the crib and then smoke it in the ride
And patrol the city streets just like we the big five
And we don't give a fuck, just as long as we gettin' high
And all through life Mary Jane remains my...

[Hook x2: Twiztid]
Light it up, smoke it up y'all
(You're my favorite)
Puff, puff, pass that shit
(You're my favorite one)

I gotta be with her
Gotta get her
Gotta get high (light it up)
I hit her and quit her
Then I filter up in the sky (pass that)

[Verse 2: DJ Clay]
Each and every day
Dang, always got it around me
Ain't no question about it, my eyes is always on drowsy
We keep it cloudy, stink the club up
Four heads on one blunt and we all on dumb
Purple haze with the bubble gum
No matter what the flavor they're all of my favorite ones
You've been my shit since I was twelve years old
And I've been fuckin' with you 'fore I was fuckin' with hoes
Break out the scissors, got a Swisher, put you in it
I twist it, burn ya, then let everybody hit it
Yeah, hold the gan in my lungs
Fake niggas smoke for the fun, I smoke for the love
See you're my, you're my favorite
And I, I love your aroma in my face
But puff, puff, pass, then you gotta be replaced
Ain't no thing though, I got a bowl for you to blaze

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
How can I tell her when it was love at first sight?
So quickly we took flight
Every morning, noon, and night
And the get right was real tight
Real light so a height meter
Easy for kissin' and hide enough from my moms, right
One night I let the homies have their way with her
Play with her, bang with her, just don't try to break with her
That same window's when it started to change
Like any bad relationship, it slowly crumbled away again
And I spend less time with her every hour in the day
And then just last week I bought a brand new van
Nothing's wrong but something ain't right
I just don't feel the same about her, wanna end it tonight
I wanna end it like a life in a fight
A quick slice and a dice
Like get it done and get the fuck on, right
I gotta think of something fast to say
There's just no other way
I gotta break up with my bong today
