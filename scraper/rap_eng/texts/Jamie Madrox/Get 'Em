[Verse 1]
....a faygo swipe
Kinda shit you hang onto in life like goood advice
And my vice is in my music
And through it i vent
My anger and fear and the love for the shit i represent
Im a self employed and certifiable freak
With the money to hit the studio and stay the whole week
Im sick of candle prescribed medication correct
And so fuck it i accept it im demented its insane
But i know instead of flowers growing
I continue to smoke every last one thats cut and rolled
Im to old for this s***?
But man im just a pup
Fresh out my daddy's nuts, now thats whats up
On point like pencils
Sharpen my skills and mentals
So i can dominate the instrumetals
Im monumental, iconic, and statuesque
With you other silly b****** silly puddy at best


Chorus (2x)
Im glidin and wildin, ridin, floatin, coastin, im bout to catchem
Get em and get em
Im bout to get em and get em
