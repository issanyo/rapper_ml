[Intro Backwards: Jamie Madrox]
This is for anyone who took the time to rewind
Do you understand what I'm saying?
It ain't easy being a Twiztid Serial Killing Juggalo
But me and Monoxide know that you all got love
And that's all that matters

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Blast off, roam in the dark with handsaw
Smoke squares five at a time and won't cough
I like graveyards and beatin' on the voodoo drum
And all you're worried about is where the fuck I'm from
Never existed, grippin' my axe, double-fisted
And if you blinked, you missed it - I'm Twiztid
No love, no hugs, know 'dap
No friends, no light, pitch black
All you ever see is the ground beneath me
Broken wings cursin' on my back, please release me
Livin' hell every day with the vision
That's everybody up on the top but I'm missin'
Listen for that voice in my head to put an end
Or somebody please save my soul and be a friend
Do you really know what it's like to be me, hell no
Cuz if you did, I wouldn't have to tell y'all

[Hook]
Do you really know what it's like?
Like to be me!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
Like to see what I see!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
See another day!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
To be me!!!

[Verse 2: Madrox]
Chained like an animal and locked in a cage
Situations and memories stored in my brain
Strung out, shootin' venom make you bug out
Pay attention as I tell you what I'm all about
I'm a walking comic book with spit for mic screams
Livin' day to day is like a helium dream
I'm seldom seen, walkin' with the dead is time consuming
You know my shit, you know what I'm doing
Now nigga if you took the time
To heed the message and this is more than a rhyme
Maybe you should hit rewind
Silence, is a deadly note
And we all hate the water that kept the boat afloat
It's a sick world
I hate every motherfuckin' body that I see
But I spread it all evenly
You made me how I am
Now you hate who I am
Good God, man

[Hook]

[Bridge: Twiztid]
Take these...
Feelings away from me!!
Strip me of everything!!
See me for who I am
Take these...
Feelings away from me!!
I've shown you everything!!
Now you hate who I am!!
Take these...
Feelings away from me!!
Strip me of everything!!
See me for who I am!!
Take these...
Feelings away from me!!
I've shown you everything!!
Now you hate who I am!!
