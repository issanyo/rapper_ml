[Pre-Hook: Lil Wyte & (Jelly Roll)]
My boss man been trippin lately (I don't give a fuck)
My old lady been trippin lately (I don't give a fuck)
Bill collectors been trippin lately (I don't give a fuck)
Even my mama, she been trippin lately (I don't give a fuck)

[Hook: Jelly Roll & (Lil Wyte)]
It's one of them days that I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
It's one of them days that I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
It's one of them days that I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
It's one of them days that I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
I woke up, I'm out of weed, my lady trippin out on me
Don't wanna go to this warehouse, man this job, I swear I wanna leave
I work my ass off to get a couple of hundred bucks a week
After bills, pills, beer and weed I ain't got money to eat
So I followed my boss right to his house
And I put this pistol in his mouth
Robbed him and told him I'd kill his kids
If he ever made a fuckin sound
Went to work the next day with a smile
Toss some box like up and happen
I don't give a fuck, I'm out this bitch soon as I make it rappin
Don't believe, bitch wait and see
One day you'll be a memory
Every time you see my CD, bitch you will remember me
On that fuckin shit, quit fuckin with you
Scratch it off my bucket list
I'm fuckin pissed, tryin to pop a buck
Calm down, I'm done with this

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
9 o'clock in the morning, I wake up, I'm running late
Tell the boss man I'm on my way, I can't get fired today
Man I'm broke, I'm fucked up, only got a couple dollars
But I'm hungry, I'm hung over, guess I'll go right to MacDonald's
And the line's so long man it pissed me off a little bitch
I wanna McGriddle with some sausage in the middle
I pull out of the drive through, I don't wanna got to work
Really turn this bitch so fuckin hard, juice up on my shirt
Man my boss man is a jerk, my old lady's trippin too
She's always nagging and bitching bout this shit that I don't do
Told me that I'm white trash, now I'll never take out the trash
But the way I feel today â€“ you can kiss my ass!

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Man fuck that bitch, and I told her pack her shit
And get the fuck up out my clique quick but I lost my grip
Don't wanna be around when I flip my wig, hold up
Y'all ain't heard what she did, to her
Put him in the back if I had to
I had to get rid of him and be gone fore the cops show up
Now I'm in the whip and I'm drivin
Life flings by, man I'm 75
And I look in the rear view mirror and all I'm seein is sirens
I'm a product of domestic violence
And I hate that motherfuckin slut
I'm surrounded by 100 cops and I don't give a motherfuck

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
I mean, I got my family and 2 balls that I can grab
Don't wanna come off conceited, too proud
In front of those who really ain't have
Less than nothing, I ain't frontin, suburban country I'm ballin
Bedsheet for curtains and windows and yes I'm an alcoholic
I'm drunk and can barely call 'em, I'm this way most of the time
Good for minding my own
Unless those simple minded men
Get up in it that ass like two-ply
Have no time for that bullshit
But I get on yo stack fore I get up in the track
And I'm lookin for all the paper I can get
Fuck!
