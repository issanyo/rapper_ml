[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I got these feelings that I can do without in my life
All the wrong I see, what can I do to make it right?
I try, I try but I just cannot seem to compromise
So I get discouraged and all these feelings, they multiply

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Tell them all be scared, I’m America’s nightmare
Giving that 'you die tonight' stare
Living every day like the end is right there
I don’t feel like life is letting me fight fair
Out of luck, outta giving a fuck
Tired of living just enough for the minimal stuff
I'm like a truck with rip in the tuck
And a big ass dip just given to front
It's like I'm right back living with Moms
Cuz she just ain't getting enough
Disability from the state
When the job got robbed and she's disputin the fraud
Most of y'all would've given it up

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I got these feelings that I can do without in my life
All the wrong I see, what can I do to make it right?
I try, I try but I just cannot seem to compromise
So I get discouraged and all these feelings, they multiply

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Yo, from broke eating ramen to charms and diamonds
Told me tether to the mountain when I'm finding rhymin'
No, I'm not shining and I'm dull and too small
For these disco balls and things that weave behind Y'all
We're not your curtain call, but we're for certain
That all of y'all in the waiting to sit down before you fall off
Everybody's playing the same game, don't be surprised
You on top of the world, and beneath it on the next day
Fuck what everybody say, everyone has opinions
And that shit right there ain’t ever gonna change
Like the weather, as long as you know you got it together
The rest of the broken frame can fall off like the scabs
Sick and tired of being sad, got no reason being mad
I finally understand that we were meant to everlast
Ain't it funny? Catching feelings made me ugly
I remember once upon a time when you used to love me

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I got these feelings that I can do without in my life
All the wrong I see, what can I do to make it right?
I try, I try but I just cannot seem to compromise
So I get discouraged and all these feelings, they multiply

[Bridge: Jamie Madrox]
Turn me on, turn me down, turn me up and around
Got the feeling that something’s happening
My mind's spinning in a daze pushing everything away
Got the feeling that something’s happening

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I got these feelings that I can do without in my life
All the wrong I see, what can I do to make it right?
I try, I try but I just cannot seem to compromise
So I get discouraged and all these feelings, they multiply
