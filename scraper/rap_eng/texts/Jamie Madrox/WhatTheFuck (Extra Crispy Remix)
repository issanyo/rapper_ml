[Hook - Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
So whatthefuck, whatthefuck yeah
(Increase the deceased, will your body rest in peace?)
So whatthefuck, whatthefuck yeah
(Now that your soul gets released when your body rots)
So whatthefuck, whatthefuck yeah
(In the grave will you have time to pray?)
So whatthefuck, whatthefuck yeah
(Hoping that your soul will be saved)

[Jamie Madrox]
Hey yo, fuck everybody that ain't down with us
Superstars incorporated; label us infamous
Niggas is ridiculous for trying to replicate our contents
No equivalent to my terror, they suffer broke necks
Bitch ass niggas is trying to imitate my real-estate
So me and Monoxide Child we had to migrate
Like ducks in the winter
We sinners with the halos
Left the company in the dust for lack of payroll
Now we stable
On our feet, willing and able
To split you from your groin to your navel
You wanna talk of fables
I turn the tables like the exorcist
Dominate your cerebellum so don't stand next to this
Multiple equation, abrasion to your mind state
Inquisitive minds and eyes dilate
While I dominate on the underground level
I'm not the devil with no horns, pitchforks or shovels
So can you dig it I be Jamie Madrox bleach white like Mr.Clorox
Be cold like Mr.Thomas but I don't be claiming White Sox
My Louisville Slugger, my weapon for bashing brains
Leavin' competition tangled in chains like I was Pinhead
A Cenobite, livin' at night
Afraid of sunlight
Police told to shoot on sight
You think they might?
If they do I'll return fire at rapid speeds
Show them bitches a trick I got up my sleeve
Increase the deceased

[Hook]

[Monoxide]
Tell you the truth it's like this
Everybody can suck my dick
And I could give a fuck less bitch
You ain't shit
And I'mma be the first to tell
I got your family all hostage and they burnin in hell
True, I sold my soul, I never did shit with it
But I could give a fuck about it
So I know that I could live without it
A constant struggle to get to the top
Increase the deceased, let it pop then watch 'em drop
Pressing the button stopping at nothing
You fuck with grown folks, kids
You better think before you say something
All up your crib, what looking for goods
Scream style muthafuckas, with the masks and the hoods
It ain't good remember that
All you suckers on the Internet
Thinking it's cool but we ain't into that
Sitting in my room alone mad depressed
Relieve the stress by sticking pencils in my chest
God bless a bag of weed
So I can get high and get back at you suckers in music
With some shit to make your ears bleed
Proceed to talk that shit, it's all wack
I'm gonna get high and pay the whole world back
Increase the deceased

So whatthefuck, whatthefuck yeah
