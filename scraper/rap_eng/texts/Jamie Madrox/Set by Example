[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
We set by example
But most of my own examples
Are horror shows and me losing control
And flying off the handle
Please help me find my head
We set by example
So I appear to be bigger than life
With my head on straight
I got a new attitude
And a funny outlook on things
These things

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
No, I'm not obsessed
No, I'm not upset
No, I'm not anything at all
No, I won't hurt you
Maybe I'm lying
Have I ever told the truth at all

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Let me tell you what I've been thinking
No one knows what goes on inside of me
Now I'm drinking and self-medicating
Lonely, Growing, a time-bomb of changing
Gotta make a better choice of my time
Gotta find an inner voice to help walk along the very fine line
Spilling my guts to a mirror and you ain't doing nothing
But it's making it worse and its clear I got a problem with you

I'm alive today (You can't kill me)
I'm alive today (You can't kill me)
I'm alive today (You can't kill me)
I'm alive today (You can't kill me)

[Bridge: Jamie Madrox]
We set by example
So they're watching every move that we make
Being critical, giving us new identities, as a criminal
Criminal
Criminal
Criminal
Criminal
We've got nothing left to lose!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Twiztid]
Let me tell you what I've been thinking
You can't kill me
Leave me alone, and don't let no body know
That I just want you (You!)
You (You!)
You (You!)
All I want is just you (You!)
You (You!)
You (You!)
One more time and I'm like
Leave me alone, and don't let no body know
That I just want you (You!)
You (You!)
You (You!)
All I want is just you (You!)
You (You!)
You (You!)
One more time while I'm you (You!)
You (You!)
You (You!)

[Hook]

It's not our intention to leave you infected
It's the way we feel inside, and cannot be corrected
It's not our intention to leave you infected
It's the way we feel inside, and cannot be corrected
It's not our intention to leave you infected
It's the way we feel inside, and cannot be corrected
It's not our intention to leave you infected
It's the way we feel inside, and cannot be corrected
