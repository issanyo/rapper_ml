Let me shave that pussy
I should've knew she was a freak by the way she walked
And when I talked to her it was like she never got caught
To this day she swear to God it wasn't shit
Unless she straight up just tripped and fell up on a fat dick
I know I been around the block a few times
So I really didn't mind that her mouth had some stretch lines
She had me thinking I'm a straight up mack
When in fact I'm just another who can hit it from the back
And attack her intestinal tract and leave a puddle of spat
Down the middle of her pimpled ass crack
And then smack, I had to give that bitch a black eye
Because the pussy just don't feel right, don't know why
I thought I was the shit and had this all on lockdown
Come to find out that my girl's just a cockhound
I couldn't deal with it, I had to bail out quick
Cause that bitch just love sucking strange dick

She said I'm the only one, said I'm the only one
Said I'm the only one, fuck you
She said I'm the only one, said I'm the only one
Said I'm the only one, fuck you

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
What up young freaky freak, tantalizing tender
Ain't seen you in a week and you know I'm on the tether
Whatever, I'm free at 3:45 remember
I'll call you around eight o'clock and we can get together
Damn, now this bitch she should do a thing or two
Grabbed my meat and did the electric boogaloo
Aww shit, what the fuck she did
Had my nuts kick stepping and my wang did the jig
That ain't shit, check it out homey
Pull my wallet out my pocked and check my ID
For sure, just to make sure it's me
And I'm a Michigan and coming straight from the D
We dicked it up, yeah, we dicked it down, yeah
I hit it from the back, she gave me ridges around
But fuck all that, instead I gave her a call
*Pause* ...Paul?

She said I'm the only one, said I'm the only one
Said I'm the only one, fuck you
She said I'm the only one, said I'm the only one
Said I'm the only one, fuck you

Son of a bitch, this bitch got big old
Hickies on her neck and dick on her breath
Trying to kiss me, talking about 'hey boo'
What the fuck's wrong with you, dumb bitch
You coulda brushed your teeth after licking his balls
You coulda had the decency to give me a call
I was worried like a motherfucker hopin' you was straight
While you was sucking and fucking some strange trousersnake
I thought I was the only python in your thong, bitch
That's the same pussy that I put my fuckin' tongue onto it
Exactly how long has this been happening
You going to random men just for action
What am I, some kinda dumb lame fuck
Or just another dick in your butt
Say somethin', were you tryin' to crush my heart just for fun
It was my fault for thinking when I thought I was the only one

She said I'm the only one, said I'm the only one
Said I'm the only one, fuck you
She said I'm the only one, said I'm the only one
Said I'm the only one, fuck you
