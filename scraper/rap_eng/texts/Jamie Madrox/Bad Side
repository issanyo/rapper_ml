[Intro]
At the end of the night when the moon rises to illuminate
What was hidden shadow during the day, a demon with white knuckle rage
Anger and anticipation, hatred and segregation
Murky waters that's infected with blood of the fallen
You might want to hang up the phone in case Heaven come callin'
Until then we walk with the dead, here on the Bad Side

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I was warned when I was baptized
I was born to walk the Bad Side
Nothin' more it's just a fact, I
I was born to walk the Bad Side!
I know that I'm rotten to the core inside my medulla oblongata
And it sort of cause problems like holes in a condom
Bring on that wicked shit, we only want that wicked shit
And it really just so happens that me can't never hold on this
I'm the wrong end of a pistol grip
When in a song of mine you’re listenin'
I'll take it all if you're givin' it
Blood is the life that we're living in!!!
Who made it a problem to be in it for the throne
Anybody wanna like claim to this?
I got another way of makin' this dangerous
Without a wicked flow
This time you fucked with the wrong J-U-double G-A-L-O!
When they know I’m the M to the O-N-O
But you're gonna die in stereo!

[Hook: Twiztid]
I'm walkin' on the Bad Side
Is there anybody wanna walk wit' me?
I'm havin' a bad time
Find my way back to reality

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
There's a place where it survives
The graveyard that lives inside of my mind
It's where all of my feeling's they go to die
I was born to walk the Bad Side!
I know I'm a monster
From the dark of the night
I'm a creature breathin'
A grenade wit' the pin gone
Ready to explode, just gimmie that reason
If these motherfuckers want it like they really said
They want it then they better be prepared to die
Like walkin' on the edge of reality
Until they jump and they swan dive on the Bad Side
I'm the shadows that swoop around you
I'm the feeling you get inside when they doubt you
You're not alone, cause I'm lettin' you know we're out there
The world is cold, who gives a fuck if they don't care!
Sick and demented, ready for greatness
You either love or hate this
Carnival life of ours, double headed axes
Underground freak shows with painted faces
We are the exiles, outcast mutants for the X-Files
Worldwide wicked is a lifestyle
And we psycho skitso with twisted smiles

[Hook 2x]

[Bridge x2: Jamie Madrox]
So shun me, world's been draggin' me down
Now I'm ugly, no beauty to be found
Chuck me somewhere deep in the underground
Bad blood, bad luck, bad sight, bad sound
