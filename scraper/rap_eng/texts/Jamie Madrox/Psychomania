[Intro]
Your insanity is undisputedly complete
What are you doing here? You have no right to...
Of course I have no right, no right to begin

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Go methodical, first born in protocol
Sun Tzu provided my lips
Service of purpose to spit death
To rivals my lyrics produce ominous split that
Inside of my lyrics is like a circle of pain
Ill, ill, illest I got the flu, spittin' sickness
Infecting the world just like a plague do, disease
I got the rabies, I'm rabid, I'm infectious
I got the habit to fuck em all like a rabbit
My middle finger is a magnet
And it attracts the damage, you're done for
Saying that it's over but we have one more score to settle
One more song play, so many shows to rock
Hundreds of lives to save, so every night I pray
If I don't die, then put the motherfucking knife away
I got no time for stabbing myself in the eye today
Cause my mind is a true devil that'll lead me astray
And my body is a new weapon and it needs to play
So let's cut and stab till everybody bleed and scream
And suffer the new nightmare
Afraid to dream or afraid of me or just plain scared to see
Whether I chose a few, shatter the effigy
Embracing the prophecy
Out of control, they wanna kill my life expectancy
Madman, killer apostrophe
I'm a mockery of hypocrisy
Nightbreed, they flock to me

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
Chopping and stabbing and cutting and killing
And leaving a bloody mess everywhere, I don't care
Call me a psycho, a killer, a maniac
I got a knife, a machete a bloody axe
I'm crazy, I'm loony, I'm out of my mind
You run far away but I'm two steps behind
I'm a killer within the woods stalking my prey
There's no choice but to scream cuz there's nothing to say

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
So what?! I'm living in a straight jacket and I'm doped up
Cause I can't hack it and I go nuts
Like I'm missing a brain fragment, oh Fuck!
Got up on the wrong side of the bed
But I never remember going to sleep
Instead I got blood stains all over my seats
And I'm sitting with this freak
Or at least what's left of her head
No rest for the wicked but I blackout
Vicious like a trap hoe
And it don't matter what they ask about
Just to make you pass out
Quicker than any horror flick that you could picture
I don't wanna scare you now, but I'll get you
I don't wanna share ya now, but I'll split you
Put a half in the trunk then walk away
And eat the other half on my dinner
I'm a psychopath when my eyes go black
And I attack and smash till my mind goes back
And I'm the last to laugh and it all is fact to the aftermath
This is a Twiztid track, I'ma BS where I go
Goddamn Myers and I'm Michael
I got all white van and when the light go off
And all you see is my knife hoe
Sick in the head and you're right bro
Living to end your survival
Hoping a friend can maybe help me out
But I shot him in the face with my rifle
Told you all I'm a psycho, still you love me in spite though
Spiteful, you might be right though
Cause I hate everything in my life, so?

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
Chopping and stabbing and cutting and killing
And leaving a bloody mess everywhere, I don't care
Call me a psycho, a killer, a maniac
I got a knife, a machete a bloody axe
I'm crazy, I'm loony, I'm out of my mind
You run far away but I'm two steps behind
I'm a killer within the woods stalking my prey
There's no choice but to scream cuz there's nothing to say
