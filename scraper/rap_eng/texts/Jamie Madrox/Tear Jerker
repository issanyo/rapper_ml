This song right here
Is Dedicated
To my mom, to my pops
To my family
To my daughter
To the people that I know and love to this day

[Jamie Madrox: ]
I was the product of two people the never got along
I was named after a song, they heard the night I was born
I was probably never planned but you know how it go
Pops was strong and had it all under control
Moms was on and bored and couldn't wait to leave
But she was pregnant now and still a mother to be
And because of that fact she stayed and put up with his shit
And took everything that
That motha fucka could dish
Believe it wasn't easy and from what i'm told
Then again I don't remember I was two years old
I was too young to know or see the tears in her eyes
And wonder why every night she would cry and pray to die
That's Some Fucked Up Shit
But I was so care free
Like every other child just livin' a fantasy
Never thought for a second
Considered it wasn't real
If it wasn't should I change the way that I feel

[Chorus][2x]
Just like a parent wanna shield you from all the pain
No matter how much inside that you're suffering
A true Sacrifice like the wings of a dove
And its real because its all love coming again

Moms is tripping
And pops is chilling
Brainstorming trying to come up on a million
Or even a thousand
A few hundred will be right on time
Cause them bills is piling up
And we're fallin' further behind
And dept collect is banging and calling the phone
When they would come to our house, we would pretend we wasn't home
Standing in the wikline
Free honey and cheese
When gratuity baskets from local charities
Its not fresh at all when you going to school
And can't afford to dress just like the cool kids do
So with used text books and last year's shoes
I was destined to never make it to the likes of high school
Time passed and pops got sick and fell ill
And everything went down hill
And when them S.S.I. checks didn't cover the bills not even close
Moms kept the boat afloat as we coast into next year

[Chorus][2x]
Just like a parent wanna shield you from all the pain
No matter how much inside that you're suffering
A True Sacrifice like the wings of a dove
And its real because its all love coming again

I see pops even less than before
But he is living in the same house behind the bedroom door
Its always closed again and he's sleeping no doubt
A rare occasion be a bathroom would bring him out
And I get to see him for a second just to say hey
How you doing
Good to see you awake
Are you ok?
For him no reply
Yea, Jamie I'm Fine
And the same night leave my world without saying goodbye
Can you imagine the rage of pain that I felt
I was too shocked to cry while excepting to change dealt
I went to school and all the kids in my class
Attended a special mass
To acknowledge that he passed
I Wanted to cry but not in front of my peers
And not in front of a priest so I wiped away tears
And swallowed the whole sorrow like a bit of relief
And prayed to god to let me talk to him every night when I sleep

[Chorus][2x]
Just like a parent wanna shield you from all the pain
No matter how much inside that you're suffering
A True Sacrifice like the wings of a dove
And its real because its all love coming again...
