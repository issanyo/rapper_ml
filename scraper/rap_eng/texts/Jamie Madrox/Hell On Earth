[Intro: Jamie Madrox]
Time to make it hot like a chemical burn
We was born for this silly bitches, so when will you learn?
I adore all you silly bitches with anger and spite
Thinking you got it figured out and who knows, you just might

[Hook]
Hey!
I tear my heart into six sins
So I may know why they call me the racist
Hide there whilst they waste and he calls them faceless
Cause it’s Satan they call to
Like, like hell on earth

I will be therefore, I’m the devil
Run quickly before you become me on some level

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Shake it off, we're just getting started
Can we break for a moment and silence for the departed
Can we take take just a moment of violence to bash beef
So motherfuckers got something new to pound in the streets
You can die if you wanted suicide
While others doing everything in they power to survive
But there's another side of the spectrum
Another horror story for the ones that collect them
But there's another side of the spectrum
Another horror story for the ones that collect them

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I'm burnin' like the hots on the top of my cigarette
And causin' panic like I'm handin' out a stimulus check
And with the money maybe you can go and buy some respect
Because the bullshit you pressin' ain't got you a lick up of jack
Outta control and I can spread like a virus
And once infected you'd banished to the island of silence
To really know my stitches dawn sick notes when aggravated
And it's time for you to pay for what I'm contemplatin'
It doesn't matter what they say
Cause we can start the melee
And separate the real from the placates

[Hook x2]
