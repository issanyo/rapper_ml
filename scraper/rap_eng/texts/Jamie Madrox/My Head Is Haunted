[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Everybody's got a skeleton in their closet
But my closet happens to be inside of my head like a pocket
Behind of my eye socket, right in line with my mind
And I'm tryin' to lock it away, but it's comin' back everytime
And I can feel it gettin' stronger, hopin' I live no longer
Choking myself while I'm having visions it's all over but it's not
And I wake up everytime and I'm still haunted in my mind
Listen close you can hear it whispering (die!)

[Verse 2: Violent J]
If you live in a haunted house you can leave it
If you hear ghost stories choose not to believe it
My dilemma's deeper try to perceive it
My head is haunted, can you conceive it?
I'm screaming at random, shit is terrifying
Right, left outta the blue I start crying
I saw an exorcist but he quit the case
I bit off his cheek and then spit it in his face

[Hook: Dark Lotus]
Living in my mind (I'm forever haunted)
Nothing they've defined (Always I am taunted)
Will they ever let me go?
With them I've combined (Beside by the wanted, no)

[Bridge: Violent J]
Fear creeps over me
Pupils dilate
Pale I become now
Face with wild hate
What is it?
Impairing me
Daring me to take another breath
(Come on doc you're scaring me to death!)
Let's get it over
Shit is gettin' colder
Everything I've told her
Lost in the roll up
Story getting older
Call me the corroder
Decaying, laying on the grim reaper's shoulder

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
I close my eyes and I’m face to face with a poltergeist
Not a polar bear but my temperature, it’s cold as ice
I got a head on me, filled up with 50 entities
Summon kinetic energy, shock me with electricity
And I’m haunted just like a host
That’s entertaining a bank with up at least a 100 ghosts
All seen it just like a scene of a massacre
My head is moving
Think that they’re driving and I’m the passenger

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
At least three ghosts occupy my brain
One is the saint, two are insane
They beat down the good ghost and torture is a constant
I thought it might help, moved in to a convent
Now I get nosebleeds and migrane shakes
I drink holy water, snort blessed rice cakes
Whatever it takes but it doesn’t know harm
They takeover, I’m in the corner chewing on my arm!

[Bridge]

[Verse 5: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Is it all in my head? Taunting me, haunting me
Want to see everyone dead simultaneously
Light the match, choke the flame, fire rain is insane
Shadows inside are addicted to pain
Bang my head off the floor
Shove it in between the door
Broke my nose, it don't stop still wanting more
I'm bloody and bruised by my own apparition
This is my life, my unstable condition

[Hook]

Lotus!

(Come on doc, you're scaring me to death)
