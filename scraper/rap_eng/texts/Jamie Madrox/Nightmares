[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Eyes backing, I'm a, nervous wreck and I
Won't sleep, I'm afraid if I slept that
You'll forgive me like the one who just left
And I hope to be known for something more than my death
Bloodletting ressurect me now
All these dreams are gonna probably take me out
Don't wanna leave but I gotta find my way to the crowd
To see another day and hope it ain't too late for me now
So how you feel it?

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
You feel like it's really hard to try to one asleep
When you're having these recurring horrible dreams
It seems they're more like nightmares, than anything else
And in a mere conscious but defensless to tryna help yourself
Out of the river of blood big hands keep pulling you down
How long will you stay awake
Holding your breath before you drown
And in the river at the bottom there's some glowing lights
That wanna seperate your body from life, one of these nights

[Hook x2: Blaze]
Oh please, oh please don't make my try to fall asleep again
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I won't be able to open them
Hoping that my nightmares don't consume me
Assuming that they're even real
And if they're not, why do I feel the way I feel?

[Verse 3: The R.O.C.]
Don't side track now, everything's going black now
See myself from my back now
Somebody please grab ahold of my soul quick
Seems the things falling in and out of my consciousness
In settles of presidence an acts of wars
I'm seeing hooks get birth out I jump some floors
I search some more but I can't find myself
Cause I'm so deep in shit again I'll ask for help
Cause I don't wanna die (But I'm scared to live!)
These nightmares give me joy and pain (dark and that's for real!)
I fight to feel my life
No back was never peace, but these nightmares never sees
Got me on a leash, get off

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Will you go with me? Let me show you what a mind can do
At least see what mine can do when I can freak you out
Like all the other ones were trying to do, guided through
Rain ways and I've been hiding for days, but soon I
Gotta go back to sleep and
The morning started up for me once again
How can I avoid it? I can't tell if it's real
Give me some drugs and little bit of alcohol cause that's how I feel
And I got that bad deal, knew I was fucked from the start
I shoulda known this shit will happen, it's all fallin' apart

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Blaze]
They haunt me, they told me in nightmares they appear
Some say that it's a blessing you can trust me, it ain't fair
Fucked up thoughts that replay day after day up in my dreams
Causing me to reenact some of the horrible things I see
Like guillotine, pleasure in pain, bodies display
Before forlay with rusty blades in your remains
A horde of hooks on swinging chains in the dark of night
They know you're tortured by your dreams
That's why they tell you "sleep tight"

[Verse 6: Jamie Madrox]
When you awake you're sweaty, distraught overcomed with fear
And compelled to go check your apparence off inside the mirror
(But no images cast by)
No way you could be still asleep
(The glass has changed back)
But something is moving beneath you
Look away why you're begin to reaching reveal
And all the while repeating softly
"There's no way this could be real"
Eyelids open and you're awaken lying in bed
But when you close your eyes, they'll be waiting for you again

[Hook x2]
