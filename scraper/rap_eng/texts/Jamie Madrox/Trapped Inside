[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Dark, cold, embryonic liquid
Surrounds me in the valley of decision
I hit the walls and they only bounce back
And my eyes won't open so everything stays black
I kick harder hopin just to break free
Never realizing it can decide to abort me
In here alone in the fleshy confines
Somebody set me free cause I'm feelin I'm trapped inside

[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Written in the scrolls long ago it was foretold
The method in which trapping and binding mortal souls
Passed down the monk's families for generations
The secret rituals and the proper incantations
Circle pentagrams in the corners of the room
And it all becomes clear this is meant to become my tomb
Doomed forever to lead a life of non-existence
I'm trapped inside here by the Pagans this is my penance

[Hook x3]
There must be some way out of this place
How did I get here
What am I doing here?

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I've quit prayin by this time I've let it all go
It's somethin that'll never change I already know
I roll my eyeballs back and take a look at my brain
I realize I'm traumatized, two-thirds insane
I knew name I knew shape to every pill that I swallow
All instructions I follow by my doctor role model
Yet it's still the same goin back in the panic zone
All the lights are on inside, but ain't nobody home

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
He who chose roads that show in slo-mo
Will know when the time comes to let his mind go
And then when you find out that he's a psycho
Then maybe you'll understand how to deal with a lost soul
Push the wounds in, trapped like quicksand
In a mind that's so sick they label him brain dead
But in the same sense if you look through his eyes
Then you see he ain't tryin to hide

[Hook x3]

[Bridge x2: Violent J]
There's no way for me
No way no key
I need for me
I'm trapped inside

[Verse 5: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Slow I.V. drip I'm layin on the table
I can feel them cuttin me, I move but I'm unable
Hot tears pour from my eyes down my cheek
You can hear the beep from my biosigns is gettin weak (beep)
Commotion, they must've removed the wrong organ
I overheard them sayin I'd be dead by the mornin
So now I'm trapped here waitin to die
Make peace with the beyond close my eyes and say goodbye

[Hook x3]

[Outro x2]
There's no escape, no way I can find
This is my time, alive
I'm trapped inside
No wind no rain there's no moon that shines
This is my time, alive
I'm trapped inside
