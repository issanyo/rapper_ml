Hey, man put it down! "It's all right" x2
What the fuck you doing, man? Put the fucking knife down! 2x

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Like a dope head with a fucking blade in his hand
Like a lost soul that exhausted every option that he has
Like an avalanche snowball theory covers his mind
And the white turns to red overtime (overtime)
Yo how can I explain that I'm an addict with a vision
A knife at the exact point it's making it's incision
What's on your mind at the precise point of decision
And the outcome of using intuition, take a listen
To the blood flow, as the streets run red
From the cut throats turning the live folks to dead
And the suites get paid no matter if blood rain
Comes running down the section of their window pane
Promotional campaign, got to spread the word
And the blood now days the only thing that seems to work
In a gore gore world, I'ma turn the redrum up
And see how many bodies it takes for me to come up

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Who the fuck was that demonous witch woman with that trickery
And why'd she grow sick of me, shit it could be
A game she plays, evil is as evil does
Leave me for dead in agony just cause
I'd way rather never have had then to have had
To never have had is only half bad
But the taste, togetherness and all that it's worth
And then return to loneliness is the deepest hurt
I realize all the shit was lies
Our ties, bonds, secrets, promises, goals, our whole lives
Shit canned all that we planned, our miles ran
Super condensed into a one night stand
Five years of my life and soul, sucked out
She had her hands on his balls and his...
Betrayal, betrayed, cut off and played on
For life, I ain't about to drop this knife!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Usually fuck with guns but today I got a blade
Cause it's the only way that I can make it past security
Been working at this place twenty years with no returns
Spend it without pay, my family ain't their concern
The boss got money to burn, and he shows me every day
Copping all the new shit and then flashing it in my face
I'm saying just the other day he had the rollie on the wrist
And now it's two minutes from knocking him out and taking that bitch!
He didn't think I was in the shit, I ain't no square
Get a PED in the pen and then stabbing another player
I have no care except for family and job
And the ladder is no longer that is a 4 to 1 slide
Sitting outside the office with a knife that shines
20 seconds left till I know he goes for lunchtime
Door opens, put it in his neck without regret
Go away for life, but my family gets the pension check
