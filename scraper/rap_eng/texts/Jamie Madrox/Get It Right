[Monoxide]
I'm feeling sacrilegious and I'm so mad at the church I
Can't believe they would inflict so much hurt why
Could you put such a hole in my faith
That I constantly feel like I'm falling from grace
And being chased by
This face that lives inside of the hate that lives
Inside of the way that I always seem to relate cry
For me and if I ever find the answer
I promise I'll spread it quicker than cancer

Now ask yourself are there really things that go bump in the night
Or are we taught as children to have fright for things that might
Live or breath or might not even exist
Cause fear is a son of a bitch of man's myths
And his job is keeping the urban legends alive
By telling stories and enhancing em with devilish lies
So stay afraid of the many beings and strange things
That will live forever in folklore and remain to be seen

[Chorus]
I don't know what to believe anymore I
Feel like I'm falling further and therefore I
Feel like I'm losing my grip and I don't know why
I better get it right this time, you better get it right
I better get it right, you better get it right
I better get it right this time, you better get it right
I better get it right, you better get it right
I better get it right this time

There are so many diseases and so little cures to 'em
My cousin just past from a sickness unbeknownst to him
There's so many reasons we're medicated
Mostly because it's good for the economy
And most of us are related to the illness passed down
>From gene pools of relatives
So if your uncle's crazy I'm saying' there ain't no telling
If it skips a generation or smashes a Y chromosome
Infecting your family tree with paranoial overtones

Now I just woke up and I really don't know what happened
She was laying there bleeding on the mattress
I didn't know she was an actress addicted top every kind of pill
That you can prescribe or imagine
I was sleeping she was grabbing to get her hands
On something sharp to put it to her neck an started jabbing
All the doctors are wrong I can't believe she's gone
And now I'm taking the medicine she was hooked on

[Chorus]


[Monoxide]
Now I can feel the eyeball watching from outer space
And the look on my face is saying it all
I need to find a safe place to call home
Where no one's watching I'm all alone
Put me in a coffin of stone
If I'm hiding it won't matter they keep finding
A hundred and one different ways to keep us dying
You think I'm trying to keep up all the lying
But really I'm just caught in the middle now everybody

[Jamie Madrox]
It's hard to believe in lies from inbreeds with invisible eyes
Incapable to see from a computer screen
Or the station from your Pentium processor
While the satellite is covering your whole circumference
Of the planetary globe watch as the chaos unfolds
As young men and women are growing old and weak
And far too scared to try to speak to the powers that be
So instead they claim peace in the midst of war

[Chorus]
