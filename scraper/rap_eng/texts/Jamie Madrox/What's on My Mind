What's on my mind
Stays on my mind

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
My mind envisions a new scene
Infecting the mainstream, with the Friday the 13th, mixed with Halloween
Spill it on your screen
Let it bump through your speakers
Till you pause mesmerized like a deer up in the high beams
Walkin' through a daydream, maybe you’re asleep
Fuck it I don't think it matters when you're becoming a creep
What's on my mind? Horror, death, blood and violence
Divided by antrum, two moments of silence
Where I sit alone in a room in a chair and I stare
Into a mirror and communicate with a monster that's there
And I'm scared to prepare the harness of death he requests
But it hurt cause he keeps blowing his way inside of my chest
And my mind says “Ah stop, it doesn’t really hurt
Shrug it off, don't be a pussy, go put another shirt"
A few drops of blood that bleed from me all the time
Put down the knife, for now
That’s all my mind says while I’m dying

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I don’t think you’re ready for goin' in my head
Instead you got a better chance of waking up the dead
Or maybe finding a monster living under your bed
Or unlocking the door that you’ve been really afraid to go in
Pop a ouji board on the floor with a friend
And contact the dead and let the questions begin
I’m so much worst than sin
So they keep me all locked up so you’ll never see me again
Feel like I’m always in a battle, it's gettin' harder to handle
Like dripping wax from a candle, all I think about is hurting people
I’m not a hero, but they’re callin' me super evil
So I walk around with a cape and a xanax
Better keep me strapped to the mattress
And hope I never wake up from my dream with a sadness
But all I ever seem to see is a cloud of blackness
And my reality is just a catfish
