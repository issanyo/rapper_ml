[Hook x2]
There's a witch trapped in this song
There's a witch trapped in this song
She'll hex you
She'll haunt you
She'll curse you if she want to

[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
There's a witch trapped in this song
No hate and hear the words of the Lotus marked forbidden
Don't memorize or repeat what I say
Grabbed a pen started writin' then blacked out for days
This crazy ass bitch is out for Juggalo souls
Hauntin' this track and over 200 years old
Think about fast forwardin cause you won't live long
Each word is damned cause there's a witch trapped in this song

[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I get the fire every night burn her at the stake for all to see
Gas all on the evil person weep and final scream
Or so it seems after ashes gone but on the floor
Possession of the listener trapped in this song
Committin to recite what she writes out of spite
To the people who betrayed and slayed her on that fateful night
Kill yourself non-believers are haunted will never end
As long as the blood still flows from the pen

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Violent J]
There's a witch trapped in this song I don't know how
She haunts the rhythm and she won't come out
She made my headphones bloody and blew all my speakers
I can her it playin in the farthest reaches
I can't shake the rhyme out of my mind
It plays all the time repeat rewind
Peek deep you'll find she infects the keys
And bends the melodies any way she please

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
She hides in my mind inside
Rhymed like each word embedded in my mind and keep her
Just like he turned in hell I suddenly blacked out
Awakened by the screams of the witch after passed out
Helpless, feelin left out and selfless
Possessed by the witch who hides like reflection
Rebellious inside of my musical section
Mind connection to the witch's selection

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
There's a witch trapped in this song
Imprisoned in the musical dimension for sins of 40 years long
Caged between the snares of force-fed rythm
And ate all 8 pounds like her heart unforgiven
She can remember her life and ever breath she would take
For 4 decades as she passed through music for wreckin the tape
The compact disk, the digital downloads
Every time you sample the song it's like a piece of her soul

[Hook x2]

[Reversed Message]
Of the Old Gods. And that can mean all sorts of Old Gods
Possession and about Witchcraft goes terribly wrong. You have a fairly explosive sort of combination
Literally trapped in the sky. Nothing between you and the universe
Please join us in our circle tonight, Hail and welcome. Hail and welcome
Practicing witchcraft skybled is a more open form of expression
This incantation is kinda sexual and people dancing around a fire, so therefore they mist have
Been having a great big sexual orgy
