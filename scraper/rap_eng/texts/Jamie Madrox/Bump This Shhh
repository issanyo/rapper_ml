(Blaze)
Everybody got a song that they want you to hear
Spittin' overload of emotion just to get in your ear
Before I listen, you already know what you like
You don't be falling for the flavor of the mainstream hype
He's back, and I don't want your promo tape
And even if it's shrink wrapped, homeboy I'm straight
I'm on my own, a choosy motherf**ker myself
And I don't settle for the first record to fall off the shelf
So don't tell me what to listen to, or tell me what to like
Don't tell me that it's banging off the hook and hella tight
Your opinion matters to you (come again?)
Your opinion matters to you (okay)

(Chorus)
Bump this shit right here
When you're at wit's end and you still don't give a f**k 'cause you love it
Bump this shit right here
When you got fired on your job, on your day off, what the f**k?!?
Bump this shit right here
When you're stuck in a traffic jam, bumper to bumper, for 3 hours
Bump this shit right here
Cause you found out your love, was loving somebody besides you

I don't want your money, I just want your mind and your ear
You don't want to hear my shit well bitch it's fine, give it here
F**k up out my face, let the music bump
All playa haters shut the f**k up
We ain't even got through the intro and someone pissed
Cause this shit don't sound quite exactly how they expected it
Open up your closed mind and you might see
'Cause you care about the music if it set ya soul free
Don't tell me what to listen to, don't tell me what to like
Don't tell me that it's banging off the hook and hella tight
Your opinion matters to you (come again?)
Your opinion matters to you (okay)

(Chorus)
Bump this shit right here
When you're at wit's end and you still don't give a f**k 'cause you love it
Bump this shit right here
When you got fired on your job, on your day off, what the f**k?!?
Bump this shit right here
When you're stuck in a traffic jam, bumper to bumper, for 3 hours
Bump this shit right here
Cause you found out your love, was loving somebody besides you

Bump this shit right here
(Turn it up ya'll)
Bump this shit right here
(Till your windows crack)
Bump this shit right here
(Let me see you jump)
Bump this shit right here
(Up with the bump, bump)
Bump this shit right here
(Turn it up ya'll)
Bump this shit right here
(Let me hear the bass bump)
Bump this shit right here
(Turn it up ya'll)
Bump this shit right here
(Till you're dead and you ain't got no air left in ya lung)
