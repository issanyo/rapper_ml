[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Peek-a-boo, I see you
Aw, what's the matter? You don't love me anymore?
Peek-a-boo niggas, yeah, I see you
Big Krizz Kaliko, baby
Kali baby, Twiztid, Prozak, yeah
Strange Music and Psychopathic holdin' down the underground still
Like this...

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't over when you think it's exonerated, gonna hate it
It's all on sight, and you think I ain't the type, right
And Christmas ain't enough to make Krizz miss
Hit 'em in the middle of em turn em into Swiss Miss, this
Too hard to turn back when it's irreconcilable
Tempers is volatile when you feel you got violence all bottled up
I'mma sum it up, I'mma change my angle from an angel to getting niggas running up
Ain't a gangsta, or soldier but thanks to ignorant niggas
Now I got a chip on my shoulder
It started when the, 80's, baby went, crazy
Maybe been, Hades, but I'm heaven sent
See it on my face I'm a saint, that don't mean I can't
Go real hard in the paint
My mind, at a place but with medicine
I'll be much better in a week or two, if not peek-a-boo

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Peek-a-boo, I see you, tell me what you're gonna do
(PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo, you see me, standing right in front of you
(I SEE YOU!)
Peek-a-boo, I see you. Now it comes right back to you
(PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo, Okay, go, no, I won't let you in for!
(I SEE YOU!)

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Yo, some say my candle burns at both ends
Insanity in my brain stems
I think these are the reasons I have no friends
You begin to choke and, ya blood get soaked in
I'll leave ya dizzy like that bitch Lindsey Lohan
There ain't no hope man, go straight to the throat, damn!
Prozak and Kaliko, Twiztid, here come the horsemen
Always stay renegade, the solo killa
Warfare gorilla, Hitchcock, they call me Prozilla
So peep the promise cause lyrics so diabolical
I'll leave ya brain matter splattered with hair follicles
Behold the prophecies before I am done
I shall leave a wake of destruction and follow the sun
All hail the ominous one, who went to prom with a gun
And now they're screaming and running, but now it's time for the fun
Careful never to cross a man when you don't know what he going through
Prozak, Psychopath, bitch, peek-a-boo

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Peek-a-boo, I see you, tell me what you're gonna do
(PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo, you see me, standing right in front of you
(I SEE YOU!)
Peek-a-boo, I see you. Now it comes right back to you
(PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo, Okay, go, no, I won't let you in for!
(I SEE YOU!)

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
I'm sicker than most folks who say they mind twisted
Like chrome and goatspokes, pop hoes like No Doz
I'm hunting motherfuckers down in nightmares
Prepare for the chance that I'm there and get your life spared
Fight fair? Never, not me, fuck with the wrong cat
Watch the big dog flee
I'm bad news like teen pregnancy
And you know the second you say some shit about me

[Verse 4: Madrox]
No I'm not a bottom feeder (never!)
Bring the Grim Reaper to the nonbeliever
Tell 'em death wanna meet ya
(Here we Go) Ferocious
The Earth die screaming invaded
By cockroaches and screw-fly demons
(I see you)
Homicidal, I'm carving a final draft
Big names with X's through 'em scribbled in my notepad
(Peek-A-BOO)
Cross 'em out and trace 'em like silhouettes
And leave 'em bloodied and dismembered so nobody ever forgets
(I see you)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Peek-a-boo, I see you, tell me what you're gonna do
(PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo, you see me, standing right in front of you
(I SEE YOU!)
Peek-a-boo, I see you. Now it comes right back to you
(PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo, Okay, go, no, I won't let you in for!
(I SEE YOU!)
