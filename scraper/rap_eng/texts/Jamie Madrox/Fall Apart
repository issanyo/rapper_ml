[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
I swallow razor blades and spit up blood
Cut out my heart and gave it to my love
I hung myself with an extension cord
And dangled high above the Ouija board
I heard the wind through the trees and I made me scream
I'm wonderin' if it's real life or just another dream
I need somethin', someone
To help me with my brain because it's fallin' apart
I fall apart

[Hook: Twiztid]
I'm fallin' to pieces and I don't know why
(It's all because) It's all because we're all afraid to die
(And if you think) And if you think about it, it'll eat you
From the inside out 'til you don't know what to do

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
You fall apart!
I'm drinkin' gas, smokin' square after square
I'm lookin' for this place but I don't know where
I'm just a soul in the land of the lost
I feel the blood in my lungs when I cough
I cut my hands off in the dark and just sat there and bled
While the whole world fell apart inside of my head
I need somethin', someone
To help me with my brain because it's fallin' apart
I fall apart

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
I cut my rib cage open with a, butcher knife
And open up the wound to show my life
I'm not the devil but your mama swear we're one and the same
And we didn't make it this way so we're not carryin' the blame
I've been down and out
I know what that's, all about

[Bridge: Monoxide]
I need somethin', someone
Help me wit' my brain, help me wit' my brain
I need somethin', someone
Help me wit' my brain, help me wit' my brain
I need somethin', someone
Help me wit' my brain, help me wit' my brain

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Jumped out a 20 story window today
I got back up and then I walked away
My head was screamin' for a Tylenol
Opened the bottle and I ate 'em all
My head was spinning in a daze and I need to relax
So where's my chainsaw, butcher knife, and motherfucking axe?!?
Somethin', someone
To help me wit' my brain cuz it's fallin' apart
I need somethin', someone
To help me wit' my brain cuz it's fallin' apart
I fall apart

[Hook x2]

[Outro x5: Jamie Madrox]
I keep fallin' apart
I never wanted to die
I keep fallin' apart
