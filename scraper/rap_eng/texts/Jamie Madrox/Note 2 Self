[Madrox]
You know that you can't buy your way into heaven
All those things that you say
With no feelings are you pretending to be
When you try to be like them becoming less of you somehow
And all the while in need of so many friends

[Monoxide]
But it just doesn't seem right, it doesn't feel good inside
Some how you just wanna pause, are people living to die
But it's just all an illusion and it's as real as can be
I'm in a state of confusion, the change is still happening

[Hook]
How can I change my life when all I have is pain
Inside of me for all to see
I'm gonna break my mind and try and smile again
Outside of me for all to see

[Madrox]
The feelings that you feel keep you from being yourself
You've become so wrapped up in your dirty world of
Power and wealth you think you can have it all
If you want it bad enough and that's probably true
That's why there's so much hatred bottled up alive in you

[Monoxide]
But it just doesn't seem right, it doesn't feel good inside
Some how you just wanna pause, are people living to die
But it's just all an illusion and it's as real as can be
I'm in a state of confusion, the change is still happening

[Hook x4]
