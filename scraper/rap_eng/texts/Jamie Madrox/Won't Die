[Monoxide]
Shotgun to the face
Laying on the floor bleeding all over the place
And I can't see, and I can't breath
But fuck it I'm like fuck it so fuck it I'll never leave
I'm probably gonna live to be the oldest MC
To ever grace the stage or lay down sixteen
I've been set on fire and soaked in gasoline
But I still keep on walking like a crack fiend

[Jamie Madrox]
Axe to the neck! Ugh! chop!
Took my arm clean off of my body and it won't stop: bleeding
I tried to block the impact with both arms now I'm only pulling one back
Second blast *gasp* hit me in the ribs
But luckily I shifted all my vital organs
Now the good arm is covering a big hole
Ten inch open wound leaking out my soul

[Hook]
They keep on trying but I won't die
And it hurts so bad
They keep on trying but I won't die
Ain't gonna let go
They keep on trying but I won't die
It hurts so bad
They keep on trying but I won't die
Won't die won't die won't die

[Monoxide]
Lookout, I just got hit by a guy in a pickup
Saying I fucked his bitch
And now I hear him shift it
And he throws it in reverse
And I know he can't kill me
But damn it really hurts
Now my legs are broken
And his truck is coming fast
But Jamie from out of nowhere
Put a bullet in his bitch ass
The truck crashed and I escaped unscathed
A couple a broken legs that'll heal up in a day

[Jamie Madrox]
They chained me to the hood of the car and pushed me into the drink
And I watched as I submerged and started to sink
I took my last good breath
As the water just about reached the tip of my forehead
The more that I seem to descend
The more I can feel the windshield beneath me caving in
Is this how it's gonna end?
As I take a deep breath and inhale two gallons of water in my chest

[Hook]

[Monoxide]
Overdose, so many drugs
So many holes in my arms am my lungs
Dilated zombie like
Pale skin just sitting here waiting to die
Concubine locked inside trying to find the sign to reveal
What's behind the meaning of life
Ninety nine ways to die is just a lie
And I'm still here counting at a hundred and five
Ugh! Ugh!

[Jamie Madrox]
Shove me in the down pouring rain
With a jumper cable hanging form my ear
Tryna fry my brain
I try to yank it off and clean rip my lobe
Now it's hanging and sparkling dangling from my dome
Waiting for the zap to cold stop my heart
But the jumper cables ain't even the worst part
I'm wrapped from head to toe in aluminum foil
Giving off sparks just like a conductor coil

[Hook x2]
