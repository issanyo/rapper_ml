(You dont wanna be like me)
(Monoxide Child)
I can walk on water and freeze it on step one
And then I'll stick my finger in it and melt it like it was hot sun

(Jamie Madrox)
Well I can turn your adam's apple into apple juice
Start to strangle mothafuckas till their face turn blue

(Monoxide Child)
I can be the world's greatest serial killer of all time
And I'll end your fucking life at the drop of a dime

(Jamie Madrox)
I can float above the clouds, way up in the sky
And it's my choice if I live or die

(Monoxide Child)
Or I can be the strange pizza man that always knocks twice
And when you open up your door I give your mothafucking neck a slice

(Jamie Madrox)
I can take a million dollars and just throw it away
Cause it'll never replace a single ounce of my sanity

(Monoxide Child)
I can be the last angel standing on top of the hill
Or the green demon waiting on your window sill

(Jamie Madrox)
And I can become an icon for the oppressed
Cause their hearts still beating in their unforgiven chest

(Chorus x2)
You Don't wanna be like (Me)
Don't wanna be like
You Don't Wanna be like (Me)
Don't wanna be like
And this is the mind of a serial killa

(Jamie Madrox)
I can buy a shotgun from Target with attempts to set it off
I can load that bitch in the parking lot and shoot that shit off

(Monoxide Child)
And I can be the book of the dead, a vampire or a demon
But either way your fucked, cause when I leave your not breathing

(Jamie Madrox)
Well I can part the sea with the wand of a wizard
And turn a hot day into a windy blizzard

(Monoxide Child)
I can be an axe in the backs of people who wanna trash talk
And leave your body slaughtered all over your momma's sidewalk

(Jamie Madrox)
I can disappear into the air like a phantom in the night
And I can die if I'm exposed to excessive sunlight

(Monoxide Child)
And I can show you how to dig a bitches grave in less then 20 seconds
And I'll shove that bitch in there and let her family get to guessing

(Jamie Madrox)
I can grab you out of your world and show you horrible things
And I can show you the terror that curiosity brings

(Monoxide Child)
And I can be the last straw, that puts you over the edge
And leaves eleven at your work place dead

(Chorus x2)
You Don't wanna be like (Me)
Don't wanna be like
You Don't Wanna be like (Me)
Don't wanna be like
And this is the mind of a serial killa

You
Me
You
And this is the mind of a serial killa
You
Me
You
And this is the mind...
