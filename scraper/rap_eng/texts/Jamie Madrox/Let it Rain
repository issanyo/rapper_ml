[Verse 1: Violent J]
Mud, Water, and finally Air
Three stages of the Lotus til' you'll notice we there
The heat from the sun, vanished life into dust
Rain clouds in the sky above us, why don't you bust?
Let it rain cool waters over fields, so bland
Drain down, fillin' up ponds, and the land
Lotus flowers, float upon the waters you give
Come and nourish our souls, we need your gift to live

[Verse 2: Monoxide ]
I sit by the window pane
Waiting for the wind to rain
When will it fall down again?
Make me strong inside and well
Hateful comes along, and I hear the words of this song
And everybody sings along, cause the rain is makin' us strong
And even when it's gone, I can feel it rainin' on me
So let this song be the proof, that the rain is just what we need

[Hook x2: Dark Lotus]
For All
For all of those trying to grow
Let the rain come down [x2]
And then for, those drying in the heat of the sun
Let it rain, let it pour, how bout' a rainstorm [x2]

[Verse 3: Violent J]
The winds from the Heavens guide my sail
The rain colors my pedals, without it I'm pale
[Faith?] in the mud, the stem to the bud
Flowers need rain, to them it's like blood
Without water drops, everything stops
Death to the crops, eco system flops
Therefore, let the winds blow the grey clouds in
Sound of thunder
Let the rain begin x5

[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Let it flow, like the river Jordan
Baptized and renewed in the rain
Like the son and men in John's hands
Bow your head, bow the other Lotus grant
The hope is rain, it's the same roots, deep down, ingrained
Winds on the plains, single change in the sky
From the clouds that form, in the night way up high
Let it rain down, let it saturate the ground
With the gift that brings life to everything around

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Let it rain on the life, in the ponds, so vibrant
With exception to the rain, the night so silent
It's an easy storm, let the Lotus flourish
Rain drops on it's pedals, the food to nourish
When the skies and the land below get along
It's colors are bright and it's stem is strong
Let it rain in the woods, let it rain in town, in the driest deserts
Let the rain come down [x5]

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
Rain clouds are cryin', drops in a form of tears
No umbrellas are needed here, waitin' waste deep
And water was corrosion from a drought
As they withered, waitin' in fear
The first crack of thunder, the lightning appeared clear
Was a sign from the Heavens, more rain would soon be near
Uncontrollable thirst, eyes affixed to the sky
As we wait for the magical rain that'll heal and bring light
Rejunvenatin' through the night, makin' everything right

[Hook]
