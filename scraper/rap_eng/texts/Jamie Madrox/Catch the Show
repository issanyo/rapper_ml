On my way and my face is painted (let's ride)
Annhilated off that faderader
Don't matter what anybody is saying lately
Cause that Twiztids shows tonight and I made it
Trunk banging juggalos hanging
Some smokin' weed and everybody dranking (pass that)
I pull up to the club and spot
About 200 people in the parking lot
I got a fat ass blunt that I spark to start
And a fake ID so I can hit the bar
And even tho it's not me
Cause the contacts and paint got me lookin' like something ya ate
And I see all the homies painted and I'm glad that they came
We get the mosh pit started when they hit the stage
Like someone let a bunch of lions out of they cage
And when it's all said and done I won't sleep for days

I'm going to catch the show
Let's get tore down
Let's loose control
Tonight let's get fucked up at the show let's go
I'm going to catch the show exhibits from the carnival
Exquisit freaks and clowns, oh my

[Madrox]
Hopped in my ride and I head to my homies house
Got two tickets for the show and I'm destined to check it out
I been listening for a minute but never been to a show
So when it come to my neck of the woods hellyeah I'm fittin to go
And I'm ready and as I pull up in front of my homies house
He come out with a fifth of patrone a blunt up in his mouth
And he tell me if I really wanna make it tonight
He know two juggalettes thats going but in need of a ride
So I said hellyeah I'm freaky and lookin to cut
I hope them bitches just as freaky lookin rubbin my butt
And make my toes curl everytime I'm bustin a nut
So when I see a pretty bitch I'm like you sittin up front next to me
She like Twiztid and ICP, boondox and blaze and she's down with the family
She lookin through my cd's and she stops at wicked
And said "baby I forgot my ticket" (DUMB BITCH)

My boss said I gotta work but I don't care
The shows coming to my hood and best believe that I'mma be there
In the front row with my hands held high
Hoping hot bitches with big titties or stagedive
So I can cop a feel as they float right pass
Even candy ain't as sweet as some juggalette ass
I'mma blast on the mothafuckas in the mosh pit
Keep shoving to the Fuckas got blood in their spit

[Monoxide]
Now the shows all done and we come back together
Like weed in blunts and your teeth from uppercuts
Remember party party up in 208
Two lettes makin out killa like sex tape get (wait)
A little more of the greygoose so I can mix up with my gatorade and let loose
Probably won't remember a thang until a day or two
But I know this show is hotter than the flames on a BBQ
