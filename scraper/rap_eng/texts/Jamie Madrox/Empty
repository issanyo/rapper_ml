[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
If you think you can get to me
My minds a door open
Walk right through
I'm deranged that's how it has to be
I never said I was anything like you

[Hook]
You bring me down (let me out)
You bring me down (let me out)

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Sit down beside my ignorance
Nobody loves me like you do
Sick and tired of all the hypocrites
Hate me cause I'm not like you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Make you judge me it's just a satisfy
I got you different right here
You can see all the pain in my eyes
Overflowing with tears

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
My mind is twisted with these thoughts of you
I just can't be alone
A constant blister when I talk to you
Wish you would leave me alone

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
Smokin' cigarettes passin' the time
Somehow I'm lonely again
No one knows I'm feelin' deep inside
Maybe if I had a friend

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Monoxide]
Kept in cage almost all my life
I'm just a shell of a man
Broken hearted from the sacrifice
I'm doing all that I can

[Hook]
