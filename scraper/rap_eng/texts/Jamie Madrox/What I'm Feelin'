[Hook]
The drugs keepin me high
I just wanna eliminate everyone thats in sight
The wicked shits alive in me and it will never die
I just wanna let you know inside what I’m feeling
Feelin endevoured I’m still alive
Killers who cut throats the only ones that survive
The wicked shits alive in me and it will never die
I just wanna let you know inside what I’m feeling

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I’m sick like hotel beds
And getting head in a motel where
My girls in the corner dead
The coroner said it was an overdose
So I cut his throat and left him for dead outside a mobile home
I’m a stoner with his motor blown
And I get high over leaving wack emcees comatose
You ain’t shit, you suck
So weak you got your vowels mixed up
J hand me the bitch so I can pump this shit up like training day
I'm holding the real killers who walk and never run away
Put your fucking gun away
'For I get pissed off then piss on ya like a rainy day
I ain't happy I'm the other way
Staying mad as fuck and always looking to retaliate
So if you wonder why I magigate
Just refer to the real definition of assassinate

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Here we go and were taking 'em back to basics
We make a mark in any marks trying to erase it
We take the number and usually we embrace it
We were born in chaos with carnival faces
How's that for odds
Sent here to eliminate false prophets and demigods of statistics
Media moguls and spreaders of the falseness
With they heads lopped off and bodies tied to crosses
Followers have been exposed
With overactive temperal lobes Up in they dome
No indiviuality more clones on the production line
Manufacture and faximilated rhymes for the twelfth time
Thirteen's synonomous with the oddity's
Stay hungry for flesh like the piranha be
Killer trying to dishonor me
Nothin is sacred in a dead economy
So bury me deep where the haters will never bother me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
They got a problem with us and the way we telling it
Not a statistic refuse to be irrelevent
Disorted in sick shit
Ooze from every element
You can blame it on my soul but the music be compelling it
To do the type to make you feel it when you hear it
Musical ducktape to patch the holes in your spirit
No jump, pump fake
We tomahawk with the lyrics
And stay buzzworthy while your shit's on clearance

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
You're phonier than cinemax porn and bein torn
Between being a label whore
And wishin you were never born
I'm not here to scorn
I'm just sayin that you're nothin more than a pawn on a board in a fake war
And now you fuck with the militia
Whirl with that government issue
Won't miss ya
I ain't gotta spit a line to diss ya
I got a line around the block of folks coming to get ya

[Hook]
