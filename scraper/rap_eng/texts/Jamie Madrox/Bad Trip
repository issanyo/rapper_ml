[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Bite if it energize enemies
Mind, am I filled up with jackal teeth
Surroundin' me, in front of me and back of me
All together they want to laugh at me
I'm paranoid, heart beatin' fast, sweaty, and I feel like faintin'
All at once everything starts meltin' around me
Like a Salvador Dal√≠ painting
It's gotta be, somebody bought a hit - illusion
My sip that had got me sick
Poppin' off at the lip on a real bad trip
Now how much worse could this shit really get?
Talkin' to myself but I don't talk back
Cause I ain't got too much to say
Completely on my biscuit
And bitch it's only quarter till 8
PM, see them starin' at me again
As I'm swattin' away a swarm of flies, they think that I'm pretend
But my hair is made of cotton candy, my pupils big as plates
And I'm ridin' a unicycle while eatin' a birthday cake
How many drinks did I take?
I'm sure it's wet at the bar, fool
Better pop this bottle then float away on this bar stool
Then I wait for the compliments
Your peanuts and popcorn as my luggage
This trip ain't so bad, its like a vacation, I love it

[Hook x2]
Oh shit
Another bad trip
I don't think your brain is even ready for this
It's like oh no
I don't think it's ready for it
Oh no
I don't think you're ready for it

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
She said "wanna smoke?"
And I said "what's the worst- *talking backwards*"
On the bed, she start to roll
And I light it up and I start to choke
And I really wanna hide in the bathroom but don't
Cause my legs wanna move but they won't
And my eyeball feel like a couple of fireballs
And I see bugs coming out of her drawer
Why the fuck you laughing, bitch?
Why the fuck you all up in my face?
She said, "Just so you know that joint I rolled was super laced!"
I said you're crazy, but I like you, but you're crazy
And at first my trip was bad but now it's fuckin' amazing
And I hear what chain let them down
Cause I don't wanna know
Why I feel like I'm stuck to the ceiling, I try to go
But I just came out right back at the beginning, outta control
And now the room is gonna spinning
And I see it's gloomin' me
It's dialin', I'm repentin' my soul
I'll never know because I passed out
In the ground, on the floor
And I woke up naked, shakin', cold, lookin' for clothes
I couldn't land it on that doorway - it's my fault, I should've known

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
So when I'm thinkin' about drinkin' or gettin' high every night
I'mma keep my eye on the shit they put inside
And I watch em creep in and leavin' something deceivin' inside
The drink I'm drinkin' in bar, the end of the evening tonight
They'll be schemin', plottin' something rotten
And it's hard for me to remember, most likely it's been forgotten
So I keep hopin' there's nothing floatin' in my cup to the bottom
And nothing laced up in the weed that I'm smokin' when I got it

[Bridge: Jamie Madrox]
It seems like I'm havin' a bad trip again
And I'm lost and confused and I'm trapped in my head
And I'm so fucking high
And I can drown to fly
And in no need of space at all in it and I don't know why

[Hook x2]
