Never Think Me Wack
If It's Poppin I Got Your Back
If It's Stolen I Got Your Back
If They Beefin Then We Attack
Cause We Rydin And Now In A Position To Define A Mission And Dreams
Focus The Cameras Over Here Homie I'm Speaking
I Radiate A Vibe Thats Kept Many Alive While
While Causin Others To Go Out Of They Mind At The Same Time
I'm Only Human And Doing What Others Do In Life
Runnin A Rat Race While Tryin To Fill A Space
Fill The Place With Heads And Let Em Hear My Shit
Crowd Don't Lie They Let You Know If It's A Hit Or Miss
Unless They Hypocrits You Know Depending On The Weather
Be The Outcome Of Em Saying Your Old Shit Is Better
That's Some Cold Shit But I Prepare For It To Happen
Sometimes An Upgrade And A Drive Will Bring About A Chain Reaction
Evolution Let Em Understand Why I'm Doing This
My Style Ain't Changed Bitch You Need To Mind Your Buisness And Just

Take It For What It Is
Take It For What It Is
Just Take It For What It Is
Take It For What It Is
Just Take It For What It Is And Focus
No Big Head Just Focus
Get Paid Get Right
Your World Your Life
Just Take It For What It Is
Take It For What It Is
Just Take It For What It Is

Never Think Me
If It's On Tell Em Bring It
If It's Off Tell Em Bring It
Cause I Came To Get Wicked
And I'm Bobbin Like A Lunitic Ya Know How I Am
Like The Pale Face Offspring Of Another Demenison
I Blend Like Camloflauge And Pose For Cameras
I Role With An Ontaroge Of People That'll Bary Ya
And My Stamina Keeps Get Stronger With Every Page That I Write
Puttin My Wieght On It Makin Sure That It's Skin Tight
I'm Only Human And Doing What Others Do
And Like Extending The Craft In An Effort To Make Scratch
So What You're Saying Is
I Could Never Compete And Upset A Diabetic Music Industry
I'm Sweet Like Candy And Painted Like Dutch Boy
Stay Afloat Like Raft While Remaining Self Employed
This Ain't No Hobby And I Ain't Never Go Away
And I'ma Be Here For Ever And A Day

And Just Take It For What It Is
Take It For What It Is
Just Take It For What It Is
Take It For What It Is
Just Take It For What It Is And Focus
No Big Head Just Focus
Get Paid Get Right
Your World Your Life
Just Take It For What It Is
Take It For What It Is
Just Take It For What It Is

Never Think Me
Cause I'm Flippin It Like A Script
And I'm Spitting It From My Lips
And I'm Droppin It Like Some Shit
Cause I'm Feelin Like Fuck Em All And I Don't Care What They Think
You See I Wait For Them To Slip And I Attack When They Blink
Because Life Is A Struggle And I'm Caught In A Web
I Got A Lot Of Bullshit Floating Around In My Head And I'm Dead
I'm Only Human And Do What Others Do In Life
Pushing A Product To Everyone Who Ain't Got It
If You Ain't Rydin With This Bump In Your Trunk Then Chances Are
You're Just A Bitch Or A Punk With No Nuts
And My Cuts Are Razor Sharp Like A Samari Sword
They Got The Home Court Advantage But I'm Watchin The Score Board
And It's A Zip And Them In The Lead To Showdown The Underground Vs The Mainstream
And I'm 3 Point From Halfcourt And All Net And You Can Put That On The Rent

Just Take It For What It Is
