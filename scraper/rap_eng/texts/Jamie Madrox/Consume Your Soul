[Monoxide Child]
I turn a dead body inside out
And leave a Lotus cross painted in the middle of your mouth
And I'm goin out to snatch up a soul runnin' the night
So I can fight off all these demons that keep yellin' and screamin' (I'm alright!)
Could somebody say a prayer for me
So I can resurrect the person that keeps hiding 'cause I'm hurtin' 'em free
Now I'm exerting all my energy to feed off the spirts
If I don't I'm dead, Fuck it
I gotta murder

[Anybody Killa]
Like a howl in the night, my stomach's tellin' me something
That I'm tired of the hurtin', I ain't frontin'
Everytime I wake up, I feel sick
My breath smells like Death
And there's a new black mole on the back of my neck
I'm goin' crazy cause I know it's something
I don't wanna face
But I'm feelin' cool there cause it's a comfortable place
It's like the pain that I was feelin'
Kept me under suspicion
But now I know that it's all just part of the tradition

[Chorus]
Round and round
I'll chase you down
I'll consume your soul
(And it consumes your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Gotta consume your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Wanna consume your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Let me consume your soul)

[Jamie Madrox]
Do you see me?
Do you believe me?
And with the petals of the Lotus Pod
You can never defeat me
Now I am the dark (yes)
And we are the way (yes)
Gettin' caught slippin' and your soul
Is straight up gettin' beat
By the Soul Eater
I did that just to keep from you what I like best
A handprint on your chest
And skin and bone is all that's really left
So think about it?
Lookin' for the one you trust?
Now you gettin' stripped of your soul by the likes of us

[Blaze]
The souls I collect I keep inside me
With their evil ways just beggin' to be set free
Sometimes
They rebel and try and take control
But the Lotus won't allow it
No way that you can tell
The plan was layed before me
Everybody's gotta go
Everybody's gotta pay
For that hater shit they say
The red page is started, and it's time to take you out
Now that planets have aligned
And the sun is setting in the South

[Chorus]
Round and round
I'll chase you down
I'll consume your soul
(And it consumes your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Gotta consume your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Wanna consume your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Let me consume your soul)

[Violent J]
HI GUYS!!!
It's me Violent J
I suck the spirit out your mouth and throw your body away
You see me smile on you
You see me wile on you
I cut and chop ya something proper into a pile of you
Cause I don't need your corspe
That's like a car with no engine
I want the soul that controls you
Trapped in my dimension
Add to my collection
With the many, many other lives
That I keep in jars floating and glowing like fireflies
And I swallow 'em

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Go ahead and open up my front door
I ain't playin' no more
I don't kill squirrels no more
Ya don't know I put my shine box away
So don't push my buttons if you wanna see another day
Goddamnit why my nose always bleedin'
And every drop the damn Souls keep mo' feedin' off it
Am I purgatory bound?
What's that sound?
Another herd is slow still chasin' me down

[Chorus]
Round and round
I'll chase you down
I'll consume your soul
(And it consumes your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Gotta consume your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Wanna consume your soul)
I'll consume your soul
(Let me consume your soul)
