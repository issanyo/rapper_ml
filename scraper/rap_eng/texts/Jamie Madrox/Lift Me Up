[Intro]
You got nine dollars? with yourself. You’ve gotta wear that whether you like it or not. You’ve got to choose things. You’ve got to get up and go, through all kinds of change. Whether you want to or not doesn’t matter

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
And I can feel it now
It's more obvious than ever there's a problem
And I better try to figure out
If I'm willing ta solve em
Or ignore em like a middle child
Seems like it's been awhile
Since I had an answer to one of life's riddles, I'm riddled out
And now I'm stuck in this mental house and these four walls
Are driving me crazy and I'm begging em all
To take a different route, somebody save me
All I see is madness on the daily
It's getting out of hand like droppin a baby
All the pills I keep slappin away when they try to medicate me
I'm a danger to my safety and my angers
Got me strapped in a jacket at most times and lately
I re-act to the fact that it's all here to change me
With a middle finger right to the face and stay the same me

[Hook:]
(Lift me up)
In life the pressure so heavy that I feel I fallen to the wayside
If only I can get away from everything
Spread my wings and then fly
(Lift me up)
I know I wasn't born on this earth to become a failure and die
If only I can get away from everything
Spread my wings and then fly
(Lift me up)

[Verse 2: Madrox]
Our life is unclear shed a heavenly tear
For father we still toughen it out down here
In the midst of mankind
Where money's so tight they cuttin' throats
For pennies nickels and dimes
Hard to walk a straight line
When the road curves like a snake
And most leaders are cowards, liars and fakes
Who shall I follow in fear I pose a question
Your response, stay strong son and pick a direction
I'm not sure if I possess the confidence to carry on
I'm only here for today and tomorrow we'll be gone
It's an example of scenarios
Use your time to leave a mark stronger
Than a miracle felt in a soul
To a believer, you don't have to say it twice
To a skeptic, I'm sure no proof will ever suffice
To a sinner, it was over before it ever began
To the lost and lonely, sometimes we only need a friend

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Madrox]
You can't stop greatness
It has a way of shining through any gimmick or fake shit
My aspirations to make it
Don't make it easy for somebody
Trying to do it for real better believe me
Fly with me flap your wings slow
Feel the ground beneath your feet begin to go
Away from me I'm excited with energy
A vision of clarity rise above the storm for solidarity

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
And your popularity is a drop in the Bearing sea
And apparently your nothing but average
I'm a dangerous package
Drown you all in my daydream
I'm laughing like a jackal
As I spread my wings and elevate free
I know you hate me
But in the grand scheme deep in your heart you wanna thank me
Cause we're the same we
All looking for escape from pretty much the same things

[Hook: Blaze]

[Outro]
In the spiritual world is where I live
I exist in places you’ve never even dreamed of
You talk about, you know, just the little physical realm you live in, guilty, and is he in sin?
How’s your courts guilty?
How many people do you think you’ve hung on the ventilators in the nut wards and forced medication on them?
You see what I’m saying? You don’t have any idea what the hell is going on
If you knew what the hell was going on in your own system
Then you’d say, “Now I see what’s creating this
