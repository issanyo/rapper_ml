[Verse 1: ClockworC]
We way past in the day man
Flinchin mane with a whole map of you face
Hand me the blade I be making these incisions
Calling me Castor Troy I'm tickin to
The sound of the round abound inside of my mind
But hands keep skipping
Yeah I'm ripping the head off Medusa making statues of my victims listen
I been speaking guillotine the king of hostile heads are rolling
I paint the roses red with every verse the blood be flowing
Porous summon that raw dawn
I pull the noose and yank it taught
The plot I'm saving the lots
Some trouble lopping off this hawkin twat
Take it Ima fit it and pullin the kung pow
Kung Pao with a chicken in the back of a pound I'm a hound gonna sniff out what I'm all about
Gonna mount me a Minnie Mouse
With a loud mouth gonna pounce
Screamin redrum at a bum I'm a freak off a leash and I'm comin to get some
Wait to come to the reheads, grease necks reflex liver in peace and pieces
I'm Hercules your deemed a Hydra, slicing they heads off while they hissing
Live with hate huddle the rest in the rap game be my bitches y'all fictitious
My kitchen be melting faces
Crack has risen when you listen
You're smokin, your dome explodin, body twitching
Ha

[Hook: ClockworC]
Heads Will Roll
Heads Will Roll
They thought we wouldn't make it, thinkin was at first mistaken
Now I see the heads we taking, yeah we doing God a favor
Heads Will Roll
Heads Will Roll
They thought we wouldn't make it, thinkin was at first mistaken
Now I see the heads we taking, yeah we doing God a favor

[Verse 2: Mr. Grey]
Exquisite execution of people's putrid pollution
Curb stomp bash your brains in the final solution
I ain't gonna hurt ya, I'm just gonna kill ya
Like Matthew Mcconaughey's chainsaw in his rearview mirror
I'll have you beggin and pleading on yo knees
Like I'm Negan, Lucille sees you bleedin and she's real thirsty tonight
Hit em with a buckshot to the face
Fuckin with me is like suicide
So just go and Kurt Cobain
I'm a one-man apocalypse, your a walkin talkin cock with lips
Dickheads get cut down like Lorena Bobbit shit
I swarming this your such a sad sack of shit
A wack ass broken promise as you speak verbal vomit
I'm loppin off they heads like its a new viral trend
I could kill your career but my pay I don't wanna see the sheath of my sword shed
Drove in up in my tool shed are trophies in glass jars
A plethora of pickled heads don't fuck with a ninja star

[Verse 3: Madrox]
Fantasy come to life they say they don't believe anybody who stand alive with a demon deep inside
I got so many heads and within my collection
I can tell this hobby slowly becoming some blood obsession
Cause I'm an ax murderer, headhunter I chop necks
Leavin dead bodies in hotels and apartments
And it sounds like domestic violence or some rough sex
And the blood on every door and the floor lookin suspect
Did I tell you about the time I used the saw
Got so tough when I hit the spine but I gave it more
Halfway through and I carve it clean
Then I hear the body it hits the floor
Blood gon spill just like milk, but I ain't gonna cry
Ima let it pour
Sicken indviduals with a head covered in blood
Like a criminal, headhunter body separator
With a machete I'll cut you just like you were tissue paper
Cause heads are gonna roll and they never kiss their neck and makeup
