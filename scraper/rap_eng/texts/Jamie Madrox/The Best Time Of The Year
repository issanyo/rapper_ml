[Verse 1: Madrox]
Hey there doe, welcome to the motherfucking carnival
Where you can see people like me and paul
Coming from the cages of the freek show
Ready to splatter blood on the wall

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Bright red apple complete for the razor blade
Cut up folks and put em in the suit case
I can hear em talking, even walking by my window
Make it stop, take alot pills and let the sin go

[Verse 3: Madrox]
Black cats and a jack o'lantern's
Word of the way it goes and evil bastards
But witches fly up in the sky
Laughing like the devil with the glowing red eyes

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Demons spawns eat planet through the flame
End it all with a shot to the brain
Celebrate the dead halloweens here
No more hiding invite spirtis to near

[Hook]
Oh it's like the best time of the year
Halloween, we watch the grains growin', spirits float by
Oh it's like the best time of the year
Halloween, we get to Speak with the ones that died

[Verse 5: Monoxide]
Watch it all burn and collapse, like your hopes and dreams
In fact I got it all on tap
Can't wake up to the spirits say so
So I tapped to the ouija, and I let it all go

[Verse 6: Madrox]
Candle light cuts the dark
Will they play with ouija in the trailer park
Demons want your soul and they're ain't afraid to grab it
Staring through the mirror with the medicine cabinet

[Verse 7: Monoxide]
Diabolical, a old school villains
And I can be whatever in the world that I'm feeling
Hanging from the cellin, when I'm talking on the phone
Dial tone letting you know that I'm really gone

[Verse 8: Madrox]
Halloween night taunting the poltergeist
In a haunted house with a tape recored and flashlight
Don't say once anger repeat with response
We're sitting in dark asking what the fuck it wants

[Hook x2]
