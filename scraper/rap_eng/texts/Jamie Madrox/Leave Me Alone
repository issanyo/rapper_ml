[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox & (Monoxide)]
Can't understand your shit, you fucking idiot
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
(Better watch your mouth, before I knock you out)
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck are you lookin' at, give you a fuckin' slap
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
(This ain't no way to live, something has got to give)
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today

[Hook]
Leave me be, let me fall asleep
I might be sufferin' from all this attention
My mind won't give it up
Now I like "what the fuck?" see your world
See my world no connection
(Leave me alone)

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox & (Monoxide)]
See me die for you, watch me cry for you
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
(This ain't no fuckin' style, just cuz you're in denial)
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
I'm no good for you, and you know it too
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
(I know I need some help, can't trust my inner self)
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox & (Monoxide)]
Save your hater shit, for that other bitch
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
(I'm out of cigarettes, somethin' that you'll regret)
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
I don't care no more, what are we livin' for?
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today
(Wrap me in cellophane, to me life's just a game)
Fuck you just leave me alone today
Fuck you just leave me alone today

[Hook]
