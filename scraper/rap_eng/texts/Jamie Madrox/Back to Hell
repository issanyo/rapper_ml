[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
They look for someone to lead 'em
There's so many people lost with no direction
And in need of something to cling to
I can't believe you don't see 'em
So many people are dying, falling apart
It's not only you, me, and him too
They know we're not right in our heads
And lay awake at night when we should be sleeping
Can someone stop all this screaming again
No longer alive, feeling dead
Blood in my eyes, seeing red
So close 'em and come closer
And meet the demons, my friend

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I can't believe that I'm in hell and I feel alive
I'm not sorry, I left you the day that I died
And I just can't seem to get all of this off my mind
So take me to hell, we hope to see you in time

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Heaven has our freedom?
Then hell must be where we from
Trapped is how I feel, some-
Thing has got to be done
Hell-bent on my kingdom
And you leave me to the bestow
What evil haven't I become
Trance - I get a sheep, come
I grew up on the madness
Murder and sadness
So it's really no wonder why my life is
Come and get me, call me tragic
Stuck and I'm stagnant
Like metal on a magnet
I'm causing a traffic jam
Reality snaps like an elastic band
And I can't even tell if I'll ever be back again
But I found a way, now get this shit
They came to come to grips again
They know what's in my hand and I can find it
Here we go, begin
Another day and night of sin
Null medicine invite us until fire is in the eyes, I feel the devil in my heart
And grace is on my face and I can't even stop it if I contemplate
Since it's covered up with faith, nobody can escape mistakes

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]

[Breakdown]
Take away the hell
Take back the hell
Take me back to hell
I'm not sorry
Take her back to hell
Take back the hell
Take me back to hell

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]

[Outro: Jamie Madrox]
I can't believe that I'm in hell and I feel alive
Take me back to hell
And I just can't seem to get all of this off my mind
So take me to hell
So take me to hell
