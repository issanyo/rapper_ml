"Thats the shit
Twiztid, Twiztid givin them wigsplits
Wigslpits, wigsplits
Twiztids givin wigsplits."

[Monoxide Child]
We cracked yo head in half
Wasn't shit funny but we laughed
Twiztid runnin this bitch for 9 dash
A car crash is no equivalent
We far from innocent
Crossin the valley and we is ignorant
Actin belligerent on the daily
When that somebody is somethin, but I guess I'm dead wrong
All by myself
Fuck everyone else im in a hole
And I can't breath my lungs swole
Bad dreams when I'm sleepin
Everybody constantly creepin
Feelin so weak I can't see them
My conscience keeps leavin me fallin in and out
Wakin up in puddles of sweat and cottonmouth
Them down south niggas dont know about this
The niggas on the west side way too pissed
Because these east side niggas talkin hardcore shit
Enough to get the northside hit, WE THE SHIT!
We legit like a motha fucka
Chillin with million dollar peoples
Diggin up graves and actin evil
You lookin for the sequel
More like somethin close to equal
You're wack as ??? and bitches in Toledo

[Hook 4x]
Die!
Die!
Die Motha Fucka
Die Motha Fucka
Die!

[Jamie Madrox]
Smoke too many cigarettes and get high too much
Dont work enough, shit is too rough
I could give a fuck less if the whole world blow up
Or what gang signs niggas throw up
I'm too fed up to keep my head up
So I let it drag
Can't afford a belt so my pants sag
Everybody seems to be a fag or a lesbian
But what the fuck happened?
Is what I'm questionin'
The president is predjudice against you and me
Then he takin half our money
And he chillin tax free
And if you ask me thats another smack in the face
We need to burn the white house and piss in his face
And every judge should do a minimum of twenty to life
If they can dish it, they can take it, tell me that ain't right
And every cop should be beat like Rodney King
Nonstop from the summer till the turn of spring
Shove a doughnut in they mouth and a badge in they ass
Because the pigs dont get no class
They get they wig split

[Hook 4x]

[Monoxide Child]
My life is fallin' to pieces
Fuck you, I hope you die
In a casket where I lie
And burn my body so I won't attract flies
In my eyes a look a terror cold as ice
So what if I slit my wrist once or twice

[Jamie Maddrox]
Now I could split your wig with my aluminum bat
Or I could blow your eardrums with my braindead rap
You could call it this or that
But I sway to the other
Word the Monoxide child my brother
No other represent this
Effervescent, knowledge-full Twiztid education I got the lesson
Bloody textbook
Kill the next motha fucka that look
Always shakin never shook yet
Get your wigsplit bitch and we out
Get your wigsplit bitch and we out
Get your wigsplit bitch and we out
Tell these motha fuckas what we talkin bout!
