Sister , please...this way...do you love me...
Excuse me somebodies in here
Hello?
What happened next is a mystery to me

[The R.O.C.]
So sadistic , she really is the business
Behavioral issues from childhood can't fix it
I might just risk this very life of mine
Impressionistic of womanly losing why my mind so blind
Sever on my friendly ties as we right the night the night sky
Searching aimlessly all through the plains to be one of a kind
Undermine never why she's the might in my spine
She's the light in my darkness on the other side unwind
As i tell you people why with the love that's in my eyes
Could never tell her lies no she saved my life as she's mine
And I'm hurt so many words to describe the times shes saved the worst
For all the assholes that treat me like a jerk
But never understood my work
But she knew from day one kept me on the right track
With the body so fun call her my honey bun
Yes shes frightening to most
Keep her warm like my ghost
Or her name is the host

A ghost
My love the host
A ghost
My love the host

Never mind to properly understand my kind
You must be tangled in the vines when it's choosing for a harvest time
Picked over left behind in a pack to rot and die
With a crows dropped shit from out of crushed velvet sky
Chances are it gets smashed by car driven by teens on Halloween
Doing donuts in a parking patch
Crickets swarming everything
Supposed that i get saved to leave the pumpkin patch and escape
To be worshiped in a circle of sulfur eleven? so pain
Keep the dead from the way I'm in a ghost to be exact
With the track to flesh his scab and his soul turns black
And it's back to garbage can or a compost heat
To become one with a earth and the cycle that repeats
And insects grow close as they continue eat the host
It must be thousands of them and still i never felt more alone
I'm in a laughter of the crows in a cackle from out of trees
In a sense I've been a priest telling me always believe in a host

[Monoxide Child]
I've should have never played alone
But I'm bored so i got to board the plane on my own
And record everything i red fuck who am i kidding you know
I ain't read shit i took it straight to the head
Put it into a circle of glass and first I've seen nothing so i begin to ask
Is there anybody in here give me a sign let me know I'm not alone
And bloodshot to my eyes
[?] ..with demonic it must be something so alive tryin rippin my stomach
And i feel like I'm gonna vomit my ribs just broke
Body in contract looking like we never spoke
I can feel in my throat so i stab a knife in it
Hoping that i can kill whatever life I'm transmitting
What a joke , just kinda layed there and died
After told by something that never wanted me alive

A ghost
My love the host
A ghost
My love the host
A ghost
My love the host
A ghost
My love the host

(Do you love me?)
