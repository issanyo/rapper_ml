[Hook x4: Prozak]
On your headstone, there will be two dates
All that matters is that line in the middle

[Verse 1 : Monoxide of Twiztid]
Now that I've been crossed out
That line in the middle says nothing 'bout the time
Rewind and find issues, that I once would hide
Like a waistline pistol
Now why should I confide in a system when I could kill ya'
La Familia, photolyzed my mind like Sid Samilia
I keep it underground like that black market memorabilia
You lookin' for darkness? Well I'm your dealer
You spit that limelight then I don't feel ya'
I make that little hair stand up when I'm near ya'
My motto is fuck being left there to fear ya'
Even if you can't see yourself in the mirror

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Madrox of Twiztid]
Born on date and expiration
And in between those goals and expectations
My word's across the world in syndication
And products available for purchase in every nation
Listen man I bet a man neither one of them can
Prepare for the drive and wrote that I possessed with any callers
And they call it no window from losers vantage point
But like the core I just teach us we gonn' rock this from detroit
We gonn' sharpen it up to a point and then jam it up in they eye
It ain't about being dead it's what you do before you die
Only get one life to live it could be gone before you blink
Either rise above the situation or close your eyes and sink
To the depths of the dark, beneath the dirt and the ground
Where conversations take place forever without a single sound
No words can be heard just the mold of uncertainty
From the past on the search of the life that used to be

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Prozak]
Life is short you better cherish it, before you perish it
And it's inherited your lungs will have no air in it
So don't be scared of it it's imperative to be carried to the cemetery
By chariot and buried a bit
So make the most of these moments before you coast closer to comatose
And tossed over to death's corner
You feel the hand on your shoulder, that black mask comin' for ya'
It's getting colder and colder here comes the coroner
You'll be hellbound, demons keep you held down
Sins will leave you spellbound, best to keep your head down
Just an empty shell now, nothing's left but hell's hounds
Chasing you through hell's grounds, place you in a cell now
Hands bound
And it is certain the final close of the curtain is lurking
And always looking to submerge you in the dirt
And it's urgent that you reserve a purpose for service
Upon this earth that is worthy and worth a birth
And you will be worthless

[Hook]
