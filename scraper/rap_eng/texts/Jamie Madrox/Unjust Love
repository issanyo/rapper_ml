[Hook: Jamie Madrox, Monoxide & Mickey Avalon]
I'm not a stalker
I follow her around and every day she shootin me down
If I was a stalker
Then why is she alive
And would she love me better if I died?

She don't love me she don't love me like I do her [x5]

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
I want to bathe in her blood, I want to eat both her eyes
I want to rip through her skin until Iâ€™m snapping her spine
I want to play with her guts
You know I'm sicker than shit
And if she's only a corpse
You know that I'll still commit
You know I love her so much that I think of hurting myself
My love is toxic and hazardous to her pretty health
She knows shes better without me
But what the fuck does she know?
But with the tape around her mouth she'll never tell me to GOOOOO!

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
She don't understand what's stressin me or
She wouldn't of had them arrest me for
Tresspassing and leaving my pinky finger
Inside of a box and she found it on top of her panty drawer
Out of my melon and out of my gord
Was I the patient for hatin waiting
So now I'm masturbating on the front room floor
And now I'm sitting in jail
And now they closing the cell door

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
I keep my rubbers with cum in them as an offering
It's like it's Christmas the ornaments on the coffin-in
I grab my penis and balls and boxers with clothes in em
And nail em both to her chest so her heart is close to em
I want to wear her skin like buffalo bill
And suck my own dick with a purse and some high heels
I know I'm better without her but what the fuck do I know?
She makes me feel like a crazy sexual animal

[Hook]

[Bridge: Danny Boone]
You're so beautiful when you're wearing red
Running my dirty fingers through
The hair on top of your pretty little head
You're so beautiful when you're wearing red
