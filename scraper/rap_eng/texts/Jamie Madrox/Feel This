[Intro]
Here we go
Juggalo clap, clap
Juggalo clap, clap
From the front to the back
Juggalo (clap, clap)
Juggalo (clap, clap)
Juggalo clap, clap
Juggalo clap, clap
From the front to the back
Juggalo (clap, clap)
Juggalo (clap, clap)
Juggalo (clap, clap)
From the front to the back
Juggalo (clap, clap)
Clap clap (clap, clap)
From the front to the back

[Jamie Madrox]
Speak to a tone re-adjust ear drums
Highly intelligent for a species labeled dumb
Numb from the neck up zone as I perform
And through the energy we acquire we are re-born
It's intense as we commence to dispense the shit
Spittin' verbal milk while you suckin' a sour tit
Inconsiderate to competitors trying to elevate
Intermixing intermingling with the venomous snakes
Fuck that you can go on and slither away
Simple minded mutha fuckas swiping sugars from our Kool-Aid
Who made the sky red and swallowed the sun
And spoke the word of light to enlighten the mass of everyone
Ummm... I believe that's us
And when the mics are on, and we bust
It like an adrenalin rush
To your dome and mine too and everyone behind you
As long as you keep it Twiztid we'll always be beside you

[Hook x2]
I want you to feel this
This pain, this hate, even if you can't pretend to relate
Feel this
Can you feel this?
Can you, can you feel this?

[Monoxide]
Riding by windows shakin' while I'm passing by
Got a big screen TV in the front for I
With a DVD player playing porno nonstop
I'm so fuckin' high
I don't wanna drive anymore
So I crashed in the back of my ex-girl's 4x4
Can you feel that you bitch?
And matter of fact
You can eat a dick and drink piss
Feel this like you felt my dick all up in your mouth
Like the shit you spit
Nothing but a poisonous snake
Trying to steal my rhythm
So I see em' in the grass and I, get em'
Don't fuck wit em'
Cause he's half a 'port short of a full pack on the attack
Half you bitches just wanna steal my shine
And the other half ain't worth the time

[Hook]

[Jamie Madrox]
Don't spit 'til you see the grit of the mic
Cause when you're in the zone
You don't care if they do or don't like
Your flow and no I don't hold no grudge to those
You stay afloat in this time of no hope
So dance with the spirits on the day of the dead
In the presence of the things that can reside inside of your head
Cause they phony like them silicone bags in stripper's bras
Step one is defining it
And two is cutting it off

[Monoxide]
Spit fire, always for hire
And I'll never stop killing till God retires
I want everybody to feel the wrath of my flow
And if you can't feel this there's the door
Robbing from the rich and poor alike I don't care
Walk into times square and leave a bomb there
Fuck with us and try to come get us
Right here and right now
I'm gonna blow like...

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Juggalo, juggalo
From the front to the back
Juggalo, juggalo, juggalo, juggalo
From the front to the back
Juggalo, juggalo, juggalo
From the front to the back
Juggalo
From the front to the back
