They'll probably tell you he's a drunken asshole
And then say it with such conviction you'll believe them and I know
I sit and listen to all the little drama
All the who's baby mama, who's addicted to blah, blah, blah
Who gives a fuck it's probably all a big lie
A way to get the people talking and walking to get in line
A way to keep the name going but sometimes it backfires
And then everybody but you is nothing more than a liar
You hire lawyers and I watch and read about it for weeks
While the media transforms and digs deep
And you believe the media so much
That your opinion is now a fact regardless of what they told us
The jury's back and everybody's on the edge of their seat
They read the verdict and it says not guilty
And you expect that we believe in what you say
When everything that you been saying is nothing more than a fake

[Hook x2]
The truth will set you free
It's all false to me, things ain't always what they seem to be
The truth will set you free
Take a look around, look on they face, they as confused as me

[Madrox]
We smoke light green when we meditating
Newports when conversating
Asian carpet woce so well it keep us levitating
Like Aladdin but we're stealing souls like a reaper
Look into my eyeball ring we both see you
Dilated and intergrated mixed with the madness
All traps and no cheese creates sadness
And if this is life, am I living in a maze
Feeling like Jimmy Hendrix always seeing purple haze
But what a beautiful color for such a delusion
Government trying to clone suckas with cell fusion
Now tell me what is that, stealing individuality
Beefing up the army all brawn with no mentality
Can you see through the face like cellophane
We're the voice in the back of your brain tucked away
But your sanity is such a lie
Don't believe me mother fucker, open up your eyes
See what's going on

[Hook x2]

You need to check your surroundings it's so commercialized
Got to have the name brand shit to enhance your shine, is it
Civilized
Seems more human than human seeing the mutant alive
Breathing inside the music
And the truth is only what they want you to know
Because they know too much would break control
And cause an overload in your perfect humdrum so predictable
Reality of life where everything is fictional

[Monoxide]
Organized like La Costa Nostra
Bring the truth like Carl the Tooth, it's game over
Slang yola weed and that boy liked to worship satan
The dark arts were like toys
Ouija boards and all kinds of little demons
Being sent into this world from my poisonous semen
If you believe in anything you heard I just said
Then before the song is over everybody will be dead

[Hook x4]
