[Intro]
I've been told that home's where the heart is, love don't live here no more regardless
I still feel this emptiness in me, will there be something that can save me?
I've tried everything no salvation all they do is prescribe more medication
I can't go
No no
I can't go home
I can't go home
I can't go home
I can't go home


[Monoxide: Verse 1]
Feeling unwanted, feeling sick to my stomach
Problems they keep on coming regardless of making money
Hoping someone above me could show them how they should love me
Inside of me's a republic of madness then I'm just stuck in recovery
Looking to sadness, rough and feeling so tragic that every bit of my magic is taking seats in the back
It only comes up when I finally get my hands on a bag, it's like the whole world welcomes me back
It's like every problem I ever had is back from the track, into reality
I fall out when it casually comes falling right back, and then it's over
I'm either living to get high or I'm dying tryna be sober neither bringing me closer
Now I'm sitting in this room detoxing and I'm alone, and all I wanna do is go home
But if I ever get myself up out of this fucking hole this is the only thing I wanted y'all to know, and it goes


[Chorus]
Feelin' lost in a world that's so alone, there's no change in me so take me home
I've been on my own, I've been gone too long, I'm the memory that echoes on
And this song is yours but I'll share it too, because they always question everything we do
And I guess there's just no fixing wrong as your heart bleeds out to the beat of this song


[Madrox: Verse 2]
Do you feel like the level you trying get is
Stuck somewhere between right here and all this stupid bullshit?
You work so hard but it seem just like nothing matters though, this life can make you feel sick and fed up is there an antidote?
To feel better be confident to be okay with the things I cannot change but that's positive and I'm the opposite
In a bottomless pit I'm fallin' my feelings are all around me so many sleepless nights, so many tears enough to drown me
Instead you learn to sleep grab a pillow and work sleep and be like a bird never fall when you can simply ride the wind
Wherever they may and possibly will beat me along my path, will I return to you to see you smile and possibly hear you laugh
When I bet to further, more distance between me and home. As long as you know I'm out there that you're never truly alone
And on my endless journey floating beyond the stars learning life is not eternal but home is wherever you are


[Chorus]
Feeling lost in a world that's so alone, there's no change in me so take me home
I've been on my own, I've been gone too long, I'm the memory that echoes on
And this song is yours but I'll share it too, because they always question everything we do
And I guess there's just no fixing wrong as your heart bleeds out to the beat of this song


[Outro]
I've been told that home's where the heart is, love don't live here no more regardless
I still feel this emptiness in me, will there be something that can save me?
