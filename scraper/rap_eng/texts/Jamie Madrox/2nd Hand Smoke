Free your mind...

[Madrox]
I represent the East side, no peace
Fuck the police
We tell you to increase the deceased at least
A grown man tellin' you something that he believe
Practice to deceive, no more tricks up my sleeve
What the fuck bitch? What bitch?
Why you talkin' shit?
Better duck bitch
Before your dome get hit
This shit is Twiztid deeper than that old French braid
Stickier than jam and jelly face, kick it

[Monoxide]
Everybody else still talkin bout something
What you thought you heard, bitch?
Can it, cause you're frontin
Dead wrong
Dinner table conversations
Leavin' you pistol-whipped in the corner with abrasions
Call it a contamination of mind state
Sleep in a dream, hopin' it's gone when I awake
Mama think I'm a flake (Corn Flake serial killa!)
Froot Loop bitin' my mind like Godzilla
We survive like caterpillars in cocoons in caskets
Stretch the industry like elastic
So fantastic, like the Newport cigarette that I smoke
Hit the mothafucka till I choke
I brag and I boast about nothin'
Death, dying, and hoes fuckin'

[Madrox]
So understand that he's saying somethin'

[Monoxide]
Never be heard I'm underground with the dirt and grime
Smashin' heads be my reason for rhyme
I'm on time like a mothafucka
Leavin you hangin in the forest
Standin in some comfortable shits like Chuck Morris
Check the chorus
Second hand smoke when you breathe
Remember what I told you always believe
You relieve I'm the Monoxide Child, I'm wild
Travel the world on nine cloud screaming loud

[Hook]
Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke

[Madrox]
You phony bitches wanna shut me down
Pullin' plugs on the microphones
Hatin' on the individual handle Mr.Bones
Hope your speakers 8 ohms or they dead blown
If they are, turn this mothafucka up and mash on
As we blast past bitch ass niggas at fast rates
Growin' at a fast pace made my heart race
Lookin' death in the face and I don't even shudder
If my woman starts cheatin, motherfuck her, bitch
I'm out for self, free weed, fame and wealth
So take your hopes and dreams
And put that shit back on the shelf
Cause we rollin' in a ride far from stolen
Cigarette lighters, power windows, wood grain, motors and
Takin' curbs with ease, blowin' trees, lookin' Chinese
Hopin' that the cops ain't tailin' me
Tryin' to violate the glass house
Nigga pass the blunt before you pass out
Cause now it's on, pushin' hubcaps
Patrollin' the hood, so fuck that
Heard the shit and the shit is all wack
Plannin' the attack, cause we move when it's dark at night
Believe the rumors, cause they probably all right
Outta sight like concealed weapons and drug trades
Barricading your door for the raid
And in the shade is a sawed off double-barreled pump
Lookin' for mothafuckas who wanna jump
Cause I got 13 bullets in my pocket I'm a mad man
My trigger finger turnin' suckers to sand

[Hook]

[Monoxide]
Distraught from head trauma
You can't even see the drama
I get the persona from marijuana
At night I lay stressed with no place to go
All by my lonely screamin' out fuck that show
Cigarettes, blunt smoke I love the smell
Player hate me cause I smoke, burn in hell
This shit ain't for everybody
I live to sever bodies, so melancholy
Suicide is just a folly and I'm out

Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke (what, what)
Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke (what)
Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke
Second hand smoke, second hand smoke, What
Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke (yeah)
Free your mind
Breath it in, second hand smoke (right)
Free your mind
Breath it in
