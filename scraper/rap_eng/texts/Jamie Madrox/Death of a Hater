[Verse 1: Boondox]
Give up my soul to hell, and tell heaven I did my best
One love for family, the juggalos and fuck the rest
I'm tired of all these snakes and demon leeches on the vein
I've bled enough and now these bitches 'bout to feel my pain
You know you name the haters bitter with a point of view
Pussy motherfuckers talking shit but never had a clue
Come with your attitude, cocksucker fuck your life
I tie you to a chair and make you watch me fuck your wife
I'm just the type to catch you slippin' like a bar of soap
I catch you while you're sleeping fast and then I slit your throat
I watch you bleed and gargle, choking for your last breath
Then close the wound apply some pressure to delay your death
See what it means? Your whole existance don't mean shit to me
It ain't nothing but time to kill to make you history
And all you had to do was keep your fucking trap closed
But now your got your hands folded, clutched onto a single rose

[Hook x2: Boondox]
Just close your eyes
Say your last good byes
Get down on your knees
Dry them eyes bitch and make your peace

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Jamie not a hater, if I was it ain't no killing me
I live forever, never die, surviving off the infamy
Miss me with that everybody wants me dead same ol'
And switch my hatchet to a target hanging off my cable
If you criticize my fashion, you a faggot like Tim Gunn
I'm a juggalo scrub, established since day one
So kill the hater, replicator, dissing with a foul tongue
Take my magic marker and blacken his fucking left lung
With my box-cutter I'm'a cut his eyes wide
And put broken pieces of mirror replacing both his eyes
Got a demon inside, that's been along for the ride
Since the release of my first LP back in '95
Ever since that day, I've been embracing the hate
And basically not giving a fuck, what none of y'all say
So fuck y'all bitches, black flowers up on your casket
You get what you deserve, burn in hell hating bastard

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Boondox]
I see the shit ya pulling, looking like a trailer hitch
Come to your hood with goons and snatch you out your trailer bitch
Put on your knees, and close your eyes wait for the execution
Some call this first degree, but I call it my retribution
You had your chance to keep the sun and now you're in the rain
I be the scarecrow, but you the one who's missing brains
I put the barrel to the bone and now you're skull fucked
Two times eleven to your dome and now you're out of luck
So many times I spit just dwelling thinking of the day
Up to the point I sit for hours thinking of a way
To make you suffer, make your blood spill like a wine
Six feet up underneath the ground, have you smelling pine
It's how we do a punk bitch with a frosted mouth
Lost in the woods till you discovered by a boy scout
Stupid little mother fucker, what was you thinking
Now your body in the bushes like this rotting and stinking

[Hook x2]

I take your life, out here tonight you wanna try, die!
I take your life, out here tonight, you wanna try, die!
