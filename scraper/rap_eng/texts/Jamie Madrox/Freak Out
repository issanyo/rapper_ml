You ever been about to fuck a bitch
And before you take her pants off you can smell her pussy in the air?

What about the hotels dawg?
Everybody been to the hotel, got in the room
There's shit in the toilet
Dick hair on the seat
And somebody blood on the towel

Well this shit here for you!

(Jamie Madrox)
Carbonation and puss bubbles in open wounds
Hospitals and old men that
Chew stuff and spit chew
Old bitches that smell like a fish hut
They sit up at the mall on they break ache butt
Butt crust and scabs
Even secretions too
There's a lot of weird people that live in the world we do
They jack off in they rides, while watchin' the ladies walk by
They go in the store and touch every product inside
I say nobody sees it
And they act like its a long shot
Is there a pubic hair floatin' in my pop
Is there a toe nail in the coleslaw again
From them sick bitches workin' up at Kentucky Fried Chicken
The mother fuckers hate me and I know that they do
Because they have to get to work when my ass come through
And if you
Spit in my food Imma kill you dude
I know it might seem harsh
But I'm Feelin' a strange mood to

(Chorus)(4x)
They keep on freakin' me out
They keep on freakin' me out
They keep on freakin' me out
(???) freaks me out

(Jamie Madrox)
Runnin' bumper to bumper in rush hour traffic
Ain't got no hood ornament, I got an asshole magnet
And it attracts every half ass and dead beat
Who wanna pump they breaks like they want they trunk in they back seat

And who is this tryin' to commit suicide
You a grown ass man and you ridin' a fuckin' bike at night
With dark clothes like you got a death wish
Get your punk ass on the sidewalk broke bitch
And this motherfucker crossing the street is takin' forever
Like he tryin' to figure out which side of the street that he likes better
Better pick fast if I press the gas
And plus I'm goin' so fast
That Imma swerve and clip his ass
And this cop is in my rear view pullin' me over
And if I roll the window down he gonna smell the aroma
He's out there reachin' for his gun
I put my hands on the hood
Anyway you paint it
The situation is no good

(Chorus)(4x)
They keep on freakin' me out
They keep on freakin' me out
They keep on freakin' me out
(???) freaks me out

(Jamie Madrox)
Psychiatrist and doctors in hotel beds
Bitches who hit blunts after they give head
Sick fucks are the ones I hate the worst
Lookin' at young bitches while stroking their coin purse
Nursin' a cup of coffee that's black and ice cold
It was hot when he bought it three hours ago though
He got a dish plate size nut stain on his pants
And he roaming a single column in search of finding some ass
And the motherfuckers sit at home behind computer screens
And discuss dirty sex wit a kid that's only thirteen
You Sick Bitch!
I hope I never catch you right
Imma slit your throat wit the jagged edge of a survival knife
It's fucks like this that make me worry tough
And have every parent in the world ready to handcuff
They kid
And keep em' on a short leash and near
But ain't no place safe cause sick fucks are everywhere

(Chorus)(4x)
They keep on freakin' me out
They keep on freakin' me out
They keep on freakin' me out
(???) freaks me out
