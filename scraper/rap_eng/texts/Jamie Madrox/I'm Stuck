[Verse 1: Madrox]
What'll make him mad
Give him five back
Give him new reason to get lost
Inside a hide track
Everybody lost now
They need an anthem to choose
And decide which side of the fence
Better understand them at random
They pop lips and pride attack
Better stand ground
Straighten up your posture
Backs waiting for more
No jellyfish in this business
Guppies never survive when sharks make their decisions
You betta listen
Everybody talkin' bout the same pretty plate
In my personal opinion
You need to find you somethin separate you from the rest
Somethin different than the side of an actress

[Hook]
I wanna get up
But it won't let me
So I feel like I am stuck
Hopin that one day
I'll get set free
Cause I'm so ready
Can someone help me?
(Someone help me, someone help me, someone help me)
I'm so ready
Can someone help me?

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I feel like I am going out of my mind
Like a gunshot victim who took a couple in the back of the head from behind
And when I tried to rewind all I could find
Was hysterical blindness
My eyelids, shutter like the wings of a fly
And it's somethin I've been keepin inside
But it's been really eatin me up alive
And my conscience won't allow me to leave
I try to stop this, beat me down, like a drop kick and I feel like I'm not shit
I don't wanna feel like this anymore
Feel outta place like a blunt humidor
But if that ain't the case than why the strange look on ya face
Being a Juggalo's the way that cha ain't
I keep it in the paint
Like Olajuwon the great
Tried to medicate, but they were just too late
So everyday I'm lookin to find another way
Outta the gray shades of my brain
So I say

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Madrox]
How come everytime I try to do a little righty
Take a left turn on me like I knew it just might
Be the reason that I'm sleeping with an axe at arms reach
And at the same time in the conversation like peace
When die mutha fucka die is a slogan
And ain't to hard to see the direction it's going
Fuck, it ain't our fault we can't fix it
Truly is what they're thinkin and say we got it Twiztid!

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Give me one more chance to fly where the clouds all collide
And I ride away from the strong hold tonight
All I hear is the bad news from youtube to tv
God, I'm supposed to be happy
But I wake up every morning and I'm feelin so crappy
That Jamie just wants to slap me
You can bet that I'm happy but it was long gone, you know?
You can put that on the fiend of a coke like child support

[Hook x2]
