[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Tappin' tombstones, sit in cemeteries impatiently
You await, you need your Ouija board to communicate
Some say a seance, a summoner summon the spirits
Others say only psychic powers are needed for you to hear it
In fear, in the disenchanted voices of beyond
In an effort to conversating with 'em, tell 'em they're gone
They're no longer in this plane of existence
Trapped in purgatory, still adjusting to the afterlife conditions
Or in search of the light to move to the next phase
Or continue with haunting the living, playing the game
Some reliving the same day, same way that they died
Confused and couldn't move along if they tried
Some were never alive, not in this world, were told
Demonic spirits in search are possessing souls
So ask the lord to mend you with the white light
As we reach out on the other side, spirit talking at night

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
Join hands, gather 'round
Feel the table leave the ground
To the spirits we are bound
(I hear voices all around)
So nobody make a sound
(I said not to make a sound)
Hear the voices all around
(To the spirits we are bound)
Are you with us now?
(Are you with us now?)

"There's no escape... There's no escape from this house."

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Gather 'round a table and join hands
Complete the circle and let the sanction begin
There's only a couple of guidelines that you should follow
No video, no pics, no cups, or bottles
On top of my conduit
No tricks, I'll swallow this liquid
And I get life from the breath I borrow
From different victims who come here
And some want to get a little bit closer
Probably looking for closure
Something a little bolder
Grab something and throw it across the room
The evil consume my very soul to control it
I got the feeling of doom when I envoke it
Something so ominous, through certain eyes, I provoke it
Chance to the die ever single time that I woke it
But I'm willing to try, so I keep drinking the potion
My eyes floating inside of my mind
Focused on making some kind of contact
With anything that I notice and fire back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Total darkness, pitch black
An open invitation for conversation
Now I'm hoping they talk back
Hold hands, don't break the circle of unity
Don't want 'em to think they can possess the likes of you and me
Are you with us right now?
If you are, make a sound, tell us your name
Can you make the Ouija move around?
Don't be afraid, we just want to help you out
We've been told you've been haunting folks, what's that all about?
Do you got something to say, a message of some sorts?
Well we're about to break the circle and lay our hands on the Ouija board...
