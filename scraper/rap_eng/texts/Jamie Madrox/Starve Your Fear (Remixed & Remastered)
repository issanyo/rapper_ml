[Madrox]
Uplifting, uprooting the veins of the tree
So many branches have withered and dieing so slowly
And only confusion and common delusion
Can be the result of the path that you're choosing
To walk or to run under the moon or the sun
Taking of space, being a star or trying to become one
We're undone meaning that we're yet to finish
We got many more albums before our title's diminished or
Relinquished
On to the game for the young cats to eat up
Until then we're holding it down throwing the east up
Piece up what's left of my so called mind
And put my pen to the paper and rhyme
Oh shit, no shit
You ain't got a notion for that shit
We're under water and wondering how wet we can get
We're soaking to the point that we're out spoken
Now I think I got your mind open, can we come in

[Hook x2]
Starve your fear, feed your life
You'll find that you might
Be completely different all together
And then you'll decide which one you like better

[Monoxide]
I'm not afraid I'ma go to work with a gauge
And with the help of a barricade I'ma make the front page
I'm not afraid but when the TV keeps playing
I can see faces of people and the voices keep saying
Starve your fear, feed your life
Let me see you mother fuckers deal with that shit every night
I wanna see one of you walking in my shoes
And in less than six seconds you'll be begging
To take them off and be you
I'm never alone and clone drones that look like me
But to follow every move that I make is not likely
Don't take it lightly
This shit is heavy like a gang of fat bitches
Who love to wear their clothes tightly
I'm more afraid of myself than anything else
This world can hurdle at me
Disease, war and slap me if I'm going in another direction
I can't help it when I get to disecting I get infected

[Hook x3]

Starve your fear, feed your life
You'll find that you might
Be completely different all together
