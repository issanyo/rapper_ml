[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
They the exact opposite from you ignorant, counterfeit
Normal motherfuckers so proud of the innocence
For ever in this bitch, fuckin' with the dead
With invisible X's in the middle of our foreheads
(What would you call us?) Actin' like you don't know
In the midst of the Twiztid Serial Killin' Juggalos
We stay different, I guess different minds think alike
We the children of the night
You don't wanna fight (that's right)
Cuz if it gets to swingin'
There's goin' be more than feelin's hurt up in here tonight
That's what it's like when you're fuckin' with us
And then you get fucked up and shit is, Oh, so serious
Don't even speak on us
Now I know, that everyone got their own personal reason for hatin' us
But I don't care bitch, shut the fuck up
Try strange, deranged, divine, and different

[Hook x2]
I'm DIFFERENT
I'm not like you
I'm DIFFERENT
I like fuckin' with voodoo
I'm DIFFERENT
I come from the darkside
I'm DIFFERENT
I've seen the dead come alive

[Verse 2: Monoxid]
Treated different by the rest of the world, cuz of my axe
The tripped out raps, and the bugged ass contacts
Not normal, nothin' in comparison
So stop frontin' bitch, you's embarrisin' (HOE)
Seperated from the rest at birth
And the blood in my viens is cursed
I'm leavin' the Earth, represented by killas and juggalos
And all that don't know should die like some dumb hoes
My contagious mind state spreads quicker
Than the cold in most states
And I hope you both hate (HATER)
Can't stop what you can't see
I'm slippin' in through your backdoor, tyin' up your family
Unexpected, and unexplained
I'm underground, and I'm INSAAAAANE
People gonna talk the talk, but I'mma walk the walk
And leave ya drawn in chalk, bitch

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
I'm different like I never exsisted
Different like that 50 pack, smokin' bud toker from Twiztid
I'm DIFFERENT, like I'm segregated
No, hold up, fuck that, a better word is "Player Hated"
DIFFERENT, cuz it's so for real
And if you come with weak shit, the axe I'll wield
I said DIFFERENT, you can see it in my soul
I'm different cuz I'm Twiztid for life wit' juggalos

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
We walk through walls, sleep with the bats
Been to Heaven and Hell and still can't relax
I'm DIFFERENT, at least my mama called my strange
Said that I would be dangerous if I was given a brain
I'm a serial killa, that's what I amounted to be
And there's more than a thin line between you and me
I live behind the mirror and I'm every bad dream
So believe what you heard and see, because I'm different

[Hook x3]
