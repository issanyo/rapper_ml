All obsessed with the taste of flesh
(same thing said backwards)
All obsessed with the taste of flesh
(same thing said backwards)

Even though you think your alone they're always everywhere
(pushing me, pulling me, helping me, guiding me)
I must be insane, no they're always everywhere
(guiding me, helping me, pulling me, pushing me)
Further everyday yeah they're always everywhere

Would you feel like
(your left alone)
Would you get high
(and try to find a zone)
Its alright
(you're not alone)
Dont even cry
(because you're not alone)

("all obsessed with the taste of flesh..." backwards)

Even though you think you're alone they're always everywhere
(pushing me, pulling me, helping me, guiding me)
I must be insane, no they're always everywhere
(guiding me, helping me, pulling me, pushing me)
Further everyday yeahhhhh their always everywhere

Sleeping to dream
(it feels like home)
Come to sleep here
(still we're not alone)
My soul is mine
(that's all I own)
Don't want to wait
(don't wanna be alone...)

("all obsessed with the taste of flesh..." backwards)

Even though you think you're alone they're always everywhere
(pushing me, pulling me, helping me, guiding me)
I must be insane, no they're always everywhere
(guiding me, helping me, pulling me, pushing me)
Further everyday yeah they're always everywhere

And you don't give a shit
(I'm seeing them every day)
If they were here with you now
(and not so far away)
But now they live in a realm
(where everything is black)
And when they're gone they're gone
(they're never coming back)

Even though you think you're alone they're always everywhere
(pushing me, pulling me, helping me, guiding me)
I must be insane, no they're always everywhere
(guiding me, helping me, pulling me, pushing me)
Futher everyday yeah they're always everywhere
