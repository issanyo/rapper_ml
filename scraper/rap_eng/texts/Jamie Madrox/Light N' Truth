(Jamie Madrox)
You expect me to be young and dumb 'cause of my appearance
I'm walking with the dead, and talking to the spirits
Open is a ear when a nigga broadcast
Hidden between the channels the remote pass
You don't have to ask, I understand you're scared
Sitting at the table you so eagerly prepared
Are you ready?
Here's the world in a nutshell
Evil is everywhere, everybody got a place in Hell
And Heaven's gates are tall and strong
And the Father is forgiving for however you wrong
If you think
Life is a game of chance
Be prepared to throw down when it's time to dance
If you're young enjoy it, cause your youth is gold
Never waste time, every single day you grow old
Written is a page in the Book for you
And hard times and bad luck to see what you would do

(Chorus)
Now we look to the sky for the light and truth
I'll see you again in the morning
Now we look to the sky for the light and truth
I'll see you again in the morning

You're a machine
That's not really what I mean
What I mean is if you're programmed tight
Ya might not malfunction
Taught to be militant, given education so never be an idiot
If ya never wanna be a nothing forever
Ya better stop all that talk and get your shit together
Ya gotta think
And take into consideration all the people
All the problems that they facing
You don't understand what your own life about
So how the f**k you supposed to help
Another mothaf**ka out?

Ya got bills piling up a mile high, got a card in the mail says some family died
And now you're stressed
Pressure is a bitch, you can go on like a sucker
Stay and be victorious
Written is a page in the Book for you
And hard times and bad luck to see what you would do

(Chorus)
Now we look to the sky for the light and truth
I'll see you again in the morning
Now we look to the sky for the light and truth
I'll see you again in the morning

Raging is a way to escape
But I remind you that when you come back
It's still gonna be the same way
It's up to you
Now what you gonna do?
You can cry to the world and tell them
You played the fool
But nobody cares
We all got problems of our own, man
And you're so crazy that's it's hard to hold it down, and some of us break and fall apart
And some of us just pause and we need to restart
Thinking
Process of a man to evolve and create
And conquer what he can
Living in a world where the elevated live well
The population double daily in Hell
And having all that gotta weigh the soul
Gotta have a mothaf**ka wanna lose control
Written in the Book is a page for you
And hard times and bad luck to see what you would do

(Chorus)
Now we look to the sky for the light and truth
I'll see you again in the morning
Now we look to the sky for the light and truth
I'll see you again in the morning
