"What Ya Really Want"
[Monoxide]
Alright its time to change the mood up a little bit
This one right here
This is the one that you play when your trying to let her know that it goes no longer than tonight
Just that one special night, no strings attached
Just me an you, or actually you an whoever you may be trying to kick it to, thats this one

[Chorus]
Stop! Oh tell me what you really want, you be lookin at me like you're interested
Gone crazy when you tell me what you really want gimme half a second an we be undressing
(Ohhh) rejection I cannot deal with hearts have been broken
(Ohhh) aggression building inside me soaked in emotion

[Verse 1 - Madrox]
You so selfish probably want me all to yourself tied up and helpless
Did I make your wish-list, still look interested an not pissed
Sprung you like a jack in the box, when I was handling my business
Now its back up, so many skanked asses indecent proposals and formal advances
Many mixed drinks looking like fishing hooks wit bait on the end hoping that she don't wanna be friends
If she do than I move onto the next one
Hoping her pink fund got a little room for my love gun
Ya know that I'm loaded an I never shoot blanks so spend the night wit me an in the mornin you'll be thankful

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Monoxide]
All I really wanna do to you lock up in a hotel room
Get a bit of that good weed, an fuck till we both can't move
Don't matter who you came wit, even if you his main bitch
I just wanna get a little bit freaky, an hopefully you on the same shit
Wonder how we make it so you boyfriend will never know
Housekeeping ya mouth closed like ya used to do wit yo legs
(Ohh) gotta lift something like windows, tellin all of her kinfolk
All of that I had I got the word right back to the reason that your hear for
Ever heard of the thing in the hood that the real is callin low low
But thats somebody cuzin for ya in to rollin solo
Just want to let ya know for the turn of all the lights
Its ya last chance to roll with the player of my caliber of my likeness

[Chorus]
