My style is evident I adapt to formats
And metamorph combat like a battle rap
My mouse a gat and im clapping it off
U get hit with a slug u better die shake it off
I never freestyle, fuck a free rhyme till
Im paid like puffy u gonna have to pay for mine
I'm steady on the grind and I don't care
Who u rep or who u roll with
I make dough and focus on my own shit
U hating bitches worry on the next man
I never pay attention when I'm focus on the game plan
My shit is heavy it'll hold its own weight but I
Brought some duct tape just in case shit breaks
'Cause u know how shit go some times
When u flip the script
And it blow somebody's mind but I keep on doing
What I do like they told me and never let the stress and bullshit fold me

Keep on doing what you do
Nod your head if u hears and feeling it too
Keep on doing what you do
Can't stop, can't quit, won't stop man fuck you
Never going to stop doing this
Never going to quit doing this
If it don't bang it ain't knocking
As long as the mic on imma continue to rock

They call me one of the newest and truest to
Extend digits and wrap em around a mic
When there not letting u punk bitchesâ€¦
I'm vicious like a dog with rabid jaws
So if I lock on its gonna be hard to shake me off
If it bleeds it can be killed and so on
Raise up,get gone or get sprayed like krylon
I'm an artist and depending on the tool that I use
I can swiss cheese you and you dudes from the living room
That ain't me I don't even roll like that and to keep
It completely real I don't hold a gat but I know cat with
Rap sheets long as your arm that'll put u in the ground if u meaning me harm
U ain't hard, u the same as me, both having a dream trying
To make it a reality but I keep on doing what I do
Like they told me and never let the stress
Or bushit fold me

Keep on doing what you do
Nod your head if u hears and feeling it too
Keep on doing what you do
Can't stop, can't quit, won't stop man fuck you
Never going to stop doing this
Never going to quit doing this
If it don't bang it ain't knocking
As long as the mic on imma continue to rock

Everybody spits rhymes but yours are not like mine
Mine are colored green and shaped like stop signs
My mind so advanced it competes with itself
I got a need to believe I can achieve more
That wealth health and dental im in it
To win it and then some, rubbing on my
Balls looking like im fittin to cum
Nope, nope, splash
Im not the ultimate but im heaven sent
And hell bent to drop shit like
An ill poet with no books or scripture
That soothe the mind in me is like an elixir
Can u picture do u lack in the talent
To walk tightrope with just an umbrella to keep balance
Tip the skills, lock tip drills go deep in they pocket
For silicone and highheels but I keep on doing what I do
Like they told me and never let the stress
Or bushit fold me
