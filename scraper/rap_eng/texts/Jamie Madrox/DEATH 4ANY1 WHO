[Verse 1: Mr. Bones]
Its Mista Mista Mista
Do you remember the skeleton that came to get ya
Do you remember the bloody knife the painted picture
Pumpkin masks on the faces, killas are babysitter
Which is Samhain, random people up and away die in pain
Cause its crazy to remain awake
Blood in my liking opportunist
Sharp object right place right times
Vines telling me to do this
And drag em right back to the pumpkin patch
Bury em 6 deep
Without a shovel using their hands and dig to the deep
Blood up in underneath the fingernails again
Pumpkin cycle is feeding the children
Dirty chill by my otherworld forces
Deeper than blood causing timetable to change forces
Feed time sleep while I raise a pumpkin feast
Nosferatu told the line

[Hook]:
Death for anyone who
Opens this casket
Opens this casket
Goddamn rest in peace
Death for anyone who
Opens this casket
Opens this casket
Goddamn rest in peace

[Verse 2: The R.O.C]
Nighttime dark rhymes rewind old school
We the new mind but still murderous
HOK now faceless pumpkin mask
Circa 1993 this may be ya last
Season of breathing Hektic Mr. Bones
And R.O.C. the dirty trio peep again we're home
Sweet homes streets we still breathe the breath
A frightened little child ran with nowhere to run
We're still in minds of many outbreed we on
Trauma to the head's evolution we been gone
Them caskets we cut to make you run tuck
The bodies set em burn the rich
Now I scream on wax gives what
No we won't go away not today
As the BUK HOK ROC in this space
So throw your hands in the air
The style is still plasmic
So hold it but you can't help but respect it check it

[Hook]:
Death for anyone who
Opens this casket
Opens this casket
Goddamn rest in peace
Death for anyone who
Opens this casket
Opens this casket
Goddamn rest in peace

[Verse 3: Hektic]
Starstruck with bloodlust
Contaminated in the brain the eve was upon us
And we gon let the moonlight and when they want us
Cause I can feel the murderer inside of me grow stronger
I don't wanna sit here sedated any longer
I wanna get back to putting people in comas
Wanna cut heads off I get it bring em home
Hang em on the wall like high school diplomas
Evil's in me like Carson Newman I supposed
You haven't noticed while your throats been raised and opened
Cause you never wear like a bunch of seven hoses
Underground better take notice
We ain't here to make friends
Us three together is murderous mayhem
HOK are the letters to say when
You see the facemask just know we at it again

[Hook]:
Death for anyone who
Opens this casket
Opens this casket
Goddamn rest in peace
Death for anyone who
Opens this casket
Opens this casket
Goddamn rest in peace
