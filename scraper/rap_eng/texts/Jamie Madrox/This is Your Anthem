[Hook]
This is your anthem
This is your saving grace
Turn up your music
Welcome to a brand new hate
This is your anthem
Time to take your life back
Turn up your music
This is your life's soundtrack

[Madrox]
Look into the eyes of a people who'd rather die
Than to live long enough to fall victim to suicide
They've been stripped of all but pride
In a shell of they former self
Become captive to the weakness
Too afraid to ask for help
Out of reach, no one hears their opinion, they never speak
They persist to treat the world like a dream as if they're asleep
They're convinced that everyone is above and ridin' it beneath
Is where they belong and always were and will remain to be
Never believe, their eyes are too closed to ever see
Like cataracts, all they see is silhouettes of reality
You never known cause you've never been
On the inside, always outside lookin' in
And that's fakin' to pretend that you're knowin' just how it feels
Cause it's always the phony ones that's tellin' you keep it real
And it's always the lonely ones that's beggin' you not to go
But life is too fast to live that shit slow

[Hook]

[Monoxide]
I'm disgraceful and hateful
Spreading evil like wings of an angel
The second coming of a saved soul
And I got problems by the payload
I swear to God, I must be related to Failing and Betrayal
You want a change, I got a faceful!
But mister so afraid of anything that ain't the same, so...
I get so mad I wanna strangle
I've had enough of the same-old
The industry is nothing but a rerun of a gameshow
I refrain from entertaining the lame folk
But if your looking for something different, I'm what you came for
I'm like pressure on your brain, go insane
Like Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope were in my veins
I can't help it if everybody around me
Is building it from the ground and we rollin' in like an army
With the strength of a million Juggalos standing beside me
And you really gotta look in the darkness to find me

[Hook]
