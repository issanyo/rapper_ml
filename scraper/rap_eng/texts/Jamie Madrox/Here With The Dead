[Verse 1: Madrox]
Far from the place that I feel that I'm more Jason
And some of the spaces that I'm facing better views of amazing great
So I pace myself and I'm patient
Humble and laying gracious like invasive with determination
But I'm frustrated
Cause everything is faded, am I the one to be king jaded
Somewhere in the mist of this shit is so beyond complicated
Cause life is abrasive and full of hatred
So my grit thick and my shit contagious
Amping up my expectation
To fast-forward to destinations
Choosing locations inside my mind
Alive and ecstatic between the situation
But short period of time, allowed to shine
Like I'm sacred they cannot take it
If I stop, is it back to basics
Persuasion in games, karma screaming in their faces
Making sure the world knows it'll never replace us
I'm blasted, who's asking to ride quick
And fuck fake love, where real homies died for this
I'm old school like DL status up on my wrist
From the days that I wrote on the papyrus

[Hook: Madrox & Monoxide]
Now let me try just again
I'm tryna deal with the situation
And every day it gets harder for me to understand
Seems like I need a solution to all the problems
Plaguing me and taking over again
But I can't see in your way
Cause most of your eyes are closed
And you'll never see it my way
They'll say I'm dead and ain't got no soul
That's bad, bad, bad, bad
Too bad for me and you're probably right
Bad, so bad, you'll cry for me, I'll be fine
Here with the dead

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I'm the evil incarnate, writing in cars with humanity's vomit
Feeling lethargic, hiding in bars
Cause I no longer wanted to keep you feeling bizarre
Like I'm a circus performer
The buzzard flies from other guys that are not important
Cause I'm the shit that all of the maggots, they tried to board in
You must be snorting, I rap crammed and you egg norton's
The honeymoon is over at least for the rap portion
Fuck the smoke, I bring the Terrordome like P.E
Gave me every single word that I wrote on a CD
I'm giving pink slips to dick lips who think this
It's just some internet talk and we don't really eat this
Cause all that beef shit was facetious
Facilitated by ignorant pieces of human faces
Or is it feces who deeds these hypocritical lies
From people wanted to beat me
But could never fit in my shoe size

[Hook: Madrox & Monoxide]
Now let me try just again
I'm tryna deal with the situation
And every day it gets harder for me to understand
Seems like I need a solution to all the problems
Plaguing me and taking over again
But I can't see in your way
Cause most of your eyes are closed
And you'll never see it my way
They'll say I'm dead and ain't got no soul
That's bad, bad, bad, bad
Too bad for me and you're probably right
Bad, so bad, you'll cry for me, I'll be fine
Here with the dead

[Outro]
Here with the dead
Here with the dead
Here with the dead
