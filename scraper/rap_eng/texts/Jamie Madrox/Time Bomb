[Verse 1: Monoxide]
We got it all up on our shoulders and we know that
So we keep throwing boulders while they throw their little stones back
I come from the city where you stay bad and alone then
And if you bitches don't then we gon have to pull it long back
I been turning tough-talkers into moonwalkers
Watch em slide awake before the crew slaughters
Had it up to there so here we welcome the new order
Let the tickin' be the new wall and you say separation I call it a purge
Let them bitches fall off cause that's what they deserve
We should get a refund on everything they serve
And I should leave em leaking like water at every turn
I'm just sick and tired of speaking to people who never learn
So I treat em like the wicker light em up and let em burn
And I'm concerned that we're the only people living in this world
That give a fuck about the music so we're bringing up the hurt

[Hook: Madrox]
Sick of seeing the same shit everywhere that I go
Another day, another song, another video
Like everything slow and then outta control
Sick of feeling like my wick is burning low like a
Time bomb, my god, right now, y'all thought
Cause I'm bout to explode (explode)
I'm bout to go lights out, right now, my god, my minds fried
And I'm outta control
So here we go

[Verse 2: Madrox]
When I climb the rungs of the ladders and stackers
I remember those who laughed at us
I recall those who took advantage
Had it all in their grips but they couldn't manage
For some fans and money and then the fake vanished
Fuck life, gimme savage and now you damaged
Fuck you beyond anything I could imagine
I was just trying to get my wicked expansion
Don't blame me cause it ain't my fault
Cause you keep on trying no one cares at all
You're a pepper shaking out when birth your soul
Fire in the air for fucked in the interval
Some folks don't get it in their thick skulls
Talk alot of shit like they got big balls
Tell myself don't listen and be calm
They don't want none of this here time bomb
I'm cold mind pelvis swirls in a circular motion
And I'm thick with grind sick to the pay
Im drunk inside with spit in your mouth and lick your eyes
No not hypnotized that sound like a sound mind
When you close your eyes you pretend you're blind
It was the shit in reverse and you act like you see him for the first time
Which is worse, light or dark, death for the alive and half a heart
And I'm still glad that I don't know the answer to any of them shits for the most part
And I'm still mad and I'm too pissed exploding over no stupid shit
You know how it happenin' and how it get
If you lose one wick then you blown to bits

[Outro: Madrox]
Sick of seeing the same shit everywhere that I go
Another day, another song, another video
Like everything slow and then outta control
Sick of feeling like my wick is burning low like a
Time bomb, my god, right now, y'all thought
Cause I'm bout to explode (explode)
I'm bout to go lights out, right now, my god, my minds fried
And I'm outta control
So here we go
Sick of seeing the same shit everywhere that I go
Another day, another song, another video
Like everything slow and then outta control
Sick of feeling like my wick is burning low like a
Time bomb, my god, right now, y'all thought
Cause I'm bout to explode (explode)
I'm bout to go lights out, right now, my god, my minds fried
And I'm outta control
So here we go
