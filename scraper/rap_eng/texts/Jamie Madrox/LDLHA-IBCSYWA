[Verse 1: Madrox]
They tend to misunderstand
The paper man with scissor hands
Who watches the hourglass for grains of sand
To fall and fall again, as he pretends
That everything he lays his hands on doesn’t turn to shreds
But why oh why does he persist to hide
When they insist he try to come outside
From the shell he lives inside
Now he's been hypnotized
And despite the lies, he sits and waits to die
Cause he can’t find the words to explain the rain
All his emotions are transformed and now become pain
He’s alive in a black hole, empty in space
And he sits in front of the mirror and he’s face to face
With the sadness, confusion
His patience, he’s losing
He’s substance abusing
He’s one with the music
And he needs a little something to dial it all back
Cause he’s running in a race but he’s not on track

[Hook]
Love don’t live here anymore
It’s been cold since you went away
Now I’ve been trying to get myself together
Is there something I could say that’ll make you stay
Love don’t live here anymore
It’s been cold since you went away
I’ve been trying to get my head together
But things just don’t seem to go my way

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
All is see when I’m looking at you is me
And everyday gets a little bit harder
Like a piece of my life's puzzle
Has been slipped under the carpet
And until this day, I’m feeling like I’m never gonna find it
I smoke a cigarette and hope for the best
But sometimes, that cigarette is just smoke in the chest
And I lay in bed but it's nothing to do with getting rest
Instead I use it as an escape from all the mess
Nothing seems to matter
I’m only getting sadder and sadder
Cause I’m not even sure what I’m after
I know my life’s a disaster and I better straighten it out
And stand tall or fall victim of getting caught in
A spiraling downfall of emotion that I call
Devotion and destruction of everything and it’s my fault
I’m hoping to try more, let’s open up my door
And let em know that I’m bringing me back like an encore

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
I’m an example of a bad example
And as ample as it may seem, a sample
Of this poisonous apple'll maybe rattle a daydream
But I’m giving you reality checks
And if you get it then it’s properly spent
If you can’t handle it yet, gimme a sec
I'll make ya proud of me instead of surrounding me
Totally hounding me, expecting me to be like all the rest
And I gotta be honest, I’m not sure
Who the fuck I am on a constant basis
So many faceless faces that are faced with
"Who the fuck am I?" What a shame, and it's
Not so much the lies, I'm just lost in my mind
Trying to find what it is that makes me feel right inside
And I’m submerged by the urge to make it my day and night
I’m in the struggle looking to fight for the right
To be more than just alright...
And I’m looking for more light
So I can see what they got in store for my life

[Hook]
