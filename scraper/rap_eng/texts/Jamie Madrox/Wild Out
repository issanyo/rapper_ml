[Intro]
I'm drunk, high
Lookin' for a bitch
Just wanna dance

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Bend the curb, spark that herb
Gettin' this drunk is so unheard of
Got a little piece in my system so I can mellow out
Order another round, go ahead and help a brother out
Can't see straight, call me intoxicated
Self remedy to deal with the two-faces
Even drunk I'm ahead of the sober ones
Come ready to stike the neck like a shogun
I'm a legend even if I don't admit it
And your song ain't a hit if my four way did it
An hour song ain't a hit if you're askin' for a deal
I will not have a hand in no shit I don't feel
Brush it off like the big dogs do
As I man up, lean with my shoulder, and pound through
So many bottles that I think I lost count
Cause we up in the muthafucka ready to wile out

[Hook]
Turn that shit up
Everybody get up
Pour another drink, come on we gettin' lit up
(Make ya go boom, let it do what it do)
Split that shit up
Twist that shit up
5-0 come in the club, they gettin' hit up
(Make ya go boom, let it do what it do)

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Keep it going, get us another round
I got a feeling I'm gonna be here for a while
We got the free style
It don't matter if I listen or not
Cause you're just wantin' me [?]
("Hey, yo, yo, yo, my shit is hot!")
Fuck you and the bitch you look at
We already said everything that you're to write
Jager bomb, everything moves slow
Now it's out to the parking lot to smoke hydro
Back in the club now to find my ho
She's right there waitin' by the door, for sure
All over nothin' but I'll get the whole club spinnin'
In a circle like a pit
Get your muthafuckin' head split
There they go with them looks and mean mugs
In house thugs like the game at the club
But ain't gonna do nothin' but push comes to shove
And all along they wanna show me some love

[Hook]

[Verse 3: R.O.C]
My kicks is new, clothes so clean
Walk up on the scene with a lean so speed
Security grimmin' me, tryin' to stop my inner G
Niggas can't fuck with me
("Who is you?") R.O.C
Yeah they recognize, part like the sea was red
Bust your head make way for the dead
Club is packed, bodies like sardines swimmin'
Bitches by the pound, fuck that, I'm with it
A couple shots of Patron, vodka with that redbull
Pull every bitch in this muthafucka, I plan to
Gone till they make more, smellin' that weed smoke
Niggas ain't no joke, do it like us now
I two step through these cock blockin' niggas with ease
Girls starin', all eyes on me
While they lean and rock I replace that spot
Got these hoes on lock, not a nigga can stop this

[Hook]
