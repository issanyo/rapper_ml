[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Something's happenin'
Can't explain what I'm imaginin'
Coagulatin' inside of my abdomen
It only happens when the lights talk to me
I can feel it walk through me, unholy and unruly
Clothes rippin' and it hurts feelin' my bones break
Teeth are fallin' out and I got fangs sharp as saw blades
My face extends another six inches
And my eyes can only tell you a story that's so vicious
Ears pointed and my hands are now paws
With claws sharper than razors that you use to cut across your arms
I'm at a lost when in the dark
Transformer like a Descepticon, destroy you like an Autobot
All that I got is a spot waiting in hell
With a curse until I get there, with this story to tell
And a verse so deranged you put your house up for sale
And get the fuck outta town
Cause there's a werewolf around

[Hook]
You know you don't want me
I'll go right through
When it gets dark
You know you don't want me
What I'm gonna do
When it gets dark

[Verse 2: The R.O.C.]
In my world its the right time, ain't no lights on
Panic soon will set in, who's in their right mind?
Not me, me head runs spiral like loose leaves
Cause as the night air seeps my mentals give me the creeps
Little kids laugh and play
As I seek the deepest, darkest corners to contort and hide away
As the sun starts to set I'm 'bout to murder 'em all
In attempts to bury their planet to unleash the killas
Fearless, fuck yeah we got the muscle right?
See us, fuck nah we working dead night
Street lights don't exist, I'm on your world like Myers
When it's bright I retract shit like vampires
Buy it, ain't no need to, it's automatic
Sadness, cause your girl's body done went spastic
Stash it in my cave for my sick ways
Many days of terror in these words I say

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prozak]
In search of sanctuary, it hasn't come yet
I pray to god I'll never see another sunset
For when it gets dark I bare the mark three sixes
Surrounded by candlesticks, beads, and crucifixes
Demons levitate while poltergeists is haunting me
While my conscious is constantly taunting me
Padded cells, my life's a living hell
I'm hearing church bells when I open up the crawlspace and the body smells
Eyes roll back, I speak in tongues, bleed from gums
It's time to hit the streets with guns
Plus the seven shots laughing as the people run
Plead to be freed from these evil deeds I've done
Internal pain coincides with my violence and agony
The humanity, why does he keep stabbing me?!
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds
Prozak and Samhein, the end is coming soon

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
The sun fell downwards from out the sky
Bringing dark to the land just like closing your eyelids
And my, this blanket of night hath the power
To conjure the other side precisely at the witching hour
Portals in the fabric of time
Water splashed on the mirror while reciting in reverse just like a nursery rhyme:
"am I what fear not will I"
Everybody wants heaven but nobody wants to die
Nobody wants hell but through it they seem enticed
Till it's pitch black, all alone and clinging to your life
My advice is to hold tight to whatever you call safe
Cause in the dark they all patiently await
For you to slip and trip and take the wrong path
On a downward spiral, to your own aftermath
Leaving you at the heart of onyx of evil men
Till the sun falls in, it all happens again and again

[Hook]
