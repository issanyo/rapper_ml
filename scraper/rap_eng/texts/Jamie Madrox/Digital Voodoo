[Intro]
1, 1, 1
Be ready for voodoo (1)
Manifestation of digital minds
From him, spirit dare twos
And guard the creator of the universe
Act as one, him, like Lohas, like amaurosis
Fire, water, R.O.C

[Verse 1]:
Lyrically digitally I'm a virus
Pushing through they wanna kill me like Cyrus
Not misguided The R.O.C. I'm a tyrant
My tyrannical reign remains violent
When it comes to beats and rhymes, path of the zone is on auto
Darkness is the day, that means your doom now tomorrow
Ill never follow
Check the track record everyone that's ran with me dipped
Cause I'm a bull in a china shop no one could ever tip
Toe around my evil kill my own ego that's why I never had one
Ain't no equal
So hit your keystrokes I'm surfing that shit
Fuck you and your internet diss bitch check it

[Hook]:
I'm turning against the world evil
Leaving curses on the caster
While I put a spell on you not sure how long it will last
Now ima stomp you wreaking certain digital discourage
Not fictional method no criminals spike your surfing so below
You've encouraged by the rhythm and the rhymes
And its a little time before you all become mine
Then I'm sending out emails at em
Chance and pinnacles will do that's digital
21st-century killa im good with ya
I'm back at your homie while everyone's cursed
I'm back at your homie while everyone's cursed
I'm back at your homie while everyone's cursed
I'm back at your homie while everyone's cursed

[Verse 2]:
My digital spit blast
Get stored in levels with technical data
Invade your playbacks format
Be prepared to cross paths for your headphones
To roam through zones no sight to see
I'm all up in your wombs
Never disappear on my flight has now affected
Section to section where rhyme is resurrected
So all MC's can get they heads ripped
Clean off and I drink your blood
Refurbished your purpose to transform you to simply what it was
I give the most love so I don't need your whores
My floors are slippery when wet
From all the sweat that's leaking out your pores
It's too late to intercept your death, it's imminent
My sentiments exact, you have no defense

[Hook]:
I'm turning against the world evil
Leaving curses on the caster
While I put a spell on you not sure how long it will last
Now ima stomp you wreaking certain digital discourage
Not fictional method no criminals spike your surfing so below
You've encouraged by the rhythm and the rhymes
And its a little time before you all become mine
Then I'm sending out emails at em
Chance and pinnacles will do that's digital
21st-century killa im good with ya
I'm back at your homie while everyone's cursed
I'm back at your homie while everyone's cursed
I'm back at your homie while everyone's cursed
I'm back at your homie while everyone's cursed

[Verse 3]:
I have returned my god has sent me to rid the planet
No humans will ever dodge my ball is six
Planets widespread no share of the sun bleeds
My rhymes feed through currents
Deferring the channel me
So tune in and zoom in, hit so hard you see twins
Stereo beats I'm seeping, hit ghostly I'm creeping
No exist I'm heathens or M1s I speaking
I've trapped you no reason
For escape or pleading
Physical activity place all in captivity
Digital is my energy
Voodoo for enemies
Killing all your tendencies
To spew hate on my feeds
Sitting in the dark
I been sieged
Your mentals won't proceed

[Hook]:
