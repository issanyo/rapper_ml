I just wanna see
(everybody bleed)
Can you envision my
(darkest fantasy)
Come come with me, won't you run to the middle of my mind and see
(how fucked up it can be)

[Monoxide:]
Ya don't poke or provoke me when I'm smokin'
Razor blade outta my coat and slit ya throat clean
Drive you out on a boat an' now your fish feed
All because of my wicked addition to make a bitch bleed
Since a kid I've been in all kinds of counseling
They tell my mama that an evil lives inside of him
I'm dangerous and can bust at any second
My wick's lit and if I explode, clear the wreckage
Car crash and I did that shit on purpose
Had a hooker with me and she's in need of medical service
Coulda took her with me but instead I left her for dead
And now they lookin' for me so I been hidin' out in the shed
I been in here for a week now
And I been fiendin' just to get somebody bleedin'
But in the meanwhile
I lay low unless the bleedin' won't stop
I got bored and cut off my hand with one chop

[Bridge]
Say hey
I don't think I like it anyway
But you not gonna tell me what to play
Cause I got a flavor that's so addictive
I know you'll dig it, ok
Come on now, we can play a game
Grab yourself a shovel, dig a grave
Promise not to die
It's so addictive
I know you'll dig it, ok

[Madrox:]
Sometimes brain waves get scrambled
I go blank and fly off the handle
More hot air for the birthday candle
Celebratin' another year off in the gamble
So thankful
So apologetic
So not what I expected and it's borderline pathetic
But who am I to judge?
I don't hold a grudge
Hold a gat to my dome and pray the trigger don't budge
Love in the chamber and I aim to kill
The man in the mirror for a change of feel
Switch the pace up, paint his face up with bloodstains
And redecorate the bathroom with most of his brains

I just wanna see
