Intro
“I don’t know about you but when it comes to me. I’m over and through with all the bullshit. I don’t care an-Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit.”

Verse 1 Young Wicked
I’m a cut above it Y’all know I don’t give a mother fuck
Living underground and selling records out the trunk
Killa Hustle motherfucker we ain’t never giving up
I been rocking the dead ever since I was a pup
I’m kicking it wicked and you can feel it in ya gut
And the family is with it cuz they know it ain’t a front
A lot of industry devils don’t ever want to pay it up
Still, I made it outta the gutta even if they hated us
I ain’t never gonna back down
Walking on the stage with an axe and a ninja in the background
I’m a Raw motherfucker and you a Smackdown
Killin’em all when the slaughter coming back round
I’m living life and never tap out
And you know I keep the studio booming like a trap house
They don’t wanna see me winning but they know I’m finna to get it
Who you kidding I’m killin’em when I snap now
I get on another kinda level when I’m hella under pressure
Never let up when I’m murdering the mic
Tell me what I gotta do to prove that I’m a beast
And tell me who I gotta murder I can do it by tonight
Everything that led up to this moment is the evidence
That killing shit is probably the reason I’m Alive
Mobbing through the city like a demon of the night
Coming for the crown and you can see it in my eye
Ain’t nobody stopping the apocalypse I got'em sending everybody fleeing for they life (yeah)
Nothing like the feeling of another body bleeding when I greet them with a smile and a knife (what)
Bury me alive and like the spirit of my family I be coming out the darkness in our eyes (unh)
Sticking to it like a die cut digging in your nightmares cuz you know that’s where you’re gonna find us

Chorus
You want me to fade away
But I’m burning brighter anyway
It ain’t no peace in the hollows
So, if they seeking out the sorrow
(Then I’m a cut em up) cut em up up cut em up
(I’m a cut em up) cut em up [ain’t nobody in this mother fucker really want it with me]
(Then I’m a cut em up) cut em up up cut em up
(I’m a cut em up) cut em up I’m a killer

Verse2 Jamie Madrox
Dedicated to crushing the scene what a mess they say the best prevents success
So, Young Wicked shine harder than you ever shined I don’t care if they tripping
Fuck’em let it ride they ain’t seen shit yet everyone that start here never forget
We on that MNE shit and it’s time to represent ain’t No need for an ego we equal to the people
That tell us to keep it wicked we ridding the world of the evil
Like it’s a god complex they done met everybody
All they did was make enemies While I was building an army
Guess what mother fucker now we’re the underground
And all the rodents and washed up opponents need to sit down
Before I cut them up like a sous chef with a few scoops left
Knife skills on point so who’s left and who want what with whoever in my squad
Better be prepared to Kill us killa
Ain’t nobody killing it the way we be killing it
We take the energy from the family and we be embracing it
The enemy is dead to us there’ll never be an end to us
We only getting started and motherfuckers is jealous
They don’t’ understand the story it’s a changing of the times
Wanna leave me for dead but bitch you know I survive
Got the heart the want the drive and now I’m alive
I need every ear in the world to open they free mind
Take a listen to ninjas takin over everything everywhere
Even your playlist MNE Young Wicked and Twiztid
And guess what your favorite rapper he’s a bitch
I ain’t the hardest motherfucker or the smartest motherfucker
But I know this shit right here we are the underground
Now and forever mother fucker want to make that crystal clear

Chorus
You want me to fade away
But I’m burning brighter anyway
It ain’t no peace in the hollows
So, if they seeking out the sorrow
(Then I’m a cut em up) cut em up up cut em up
(I’m a cut em up) cut em up [ain’t nobody in this mother fucker really want it with me]
(Then I’m a cut em up) cut em up up cut em up
(I’m a cut em up) cut em up I’m a killer



Verse 3 Monoxide
Get off our dick bitch and keep our name up outta your mouth
Oh, wait you can’t cuz if you ain’t talking bout us ain’t nobody coming round
Fuck you and them misfits buncha pedophiles and misprints
No wonder why you’re like look kids just don’t let them next to your infants
I’m through with the just be cool let them do whatever they gonna do
Let them say whatever they gonna say about us to the fam and goddamn we gotta take that too
We can make it whatever they wanna make it
I can take another record, believe me, I got the make up
I can bring it in the booth or I can hit you with the change up
I’m just giving you the truth I ain’t fucking with the fables
It don’t matter what you do it ain’t fucking with the make up
I ain’t talking bout the paint get your weight up
Caught the hater with the finger hand me another plate of rap singers
I’m gonna eat it like pussy that’s what I call dinner
What they don’t call Y'all​ is winner more like worse than beginners
Pour another glass of that bitter
Everybody raise your cup and celebrate the death of the crew of the biggest of bullshitters
Had em all fooled jack tripper except for these mic rippers
I’m a take a step back kiss myself before they turn a ninja back into a killer

Chorus
You want me to fade away
But I’m burning brighter anyway
It ain’t no peace in the hollows
So, if they seeking out the sorrow
(Then I’m a cut em up) cut em up up cut em up
(I’m a cut em up) cut em up [ain’t nobody in this mother fucker really want it with me]
(Then I’m a cut em up) cut em up up cut em up
(I’m a cut em up) cut em up I’m a killer
