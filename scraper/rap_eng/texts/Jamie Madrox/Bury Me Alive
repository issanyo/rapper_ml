[Monoxide Child]
I dont give a fuck, right!
Dead face with the eyes white
Intimidate you with my eyesight
Im trying to hide from the average
Everyday we startin static
Livin with the maggots
Masters of the black magic
My shits for killas with the twiztid tats on they backs
My shits for killas who walk around with the ax
My shits for killas screamin I would rather die
Then see you motha fuckas doin MTV live
You can keep the mainstream life and all the ho's
I'm steady cussin in video's
For Juggalos
I'm underground where the dead don't sleep
Keep us a secret to the world and watch the posse increase
So if you feel me why don't you bury me alive?

[Chorus 2x]
Bury me Alive(Bury me Alive)
Run with the Psychopathic Hatchet
Then hide!
Bury me Alive(Bury me Alive)
Keep it in yo clique, fuck the outside

[Jamie Maddrox]
Strictly for the juggalos, bitch I thought you knew
Cause we sealin up the mainstream ears with krazy glue
So they can't hear a word we say
We stay Twiztid, spit the voodoo them bitches wouldn't understand it, anyway
Walk with an axe when the sun falls
Talkin to the Ouija board for predictions of the Holocaust
Give a fuck less about a video or airplay
We stay unedited and scream till the head break
This is your shit it was made for you
Don't let the radio influence you
And tell you what to listen to
And everyone at MTV can suck my dick
Tellin me we'd be the shit if they labeled us a buzz clip
Man fuck that!
We be beneath the ground
We rose with the hatchet, you can hear the wicked sound
In your eardrums, don't let the others get a taste
And if they start bump it, go on and smack them in the face
Then bury me alive

[Chorus 1x]

"With a fury of buckshots
God Damn they ruthless." 2x

[Monoxide Child]
This ain't no club shit, so ain't nobody dancin'
I only fuck with the dead and my motha fuckin advances
Chances are, you outta luck when you fuckin' with the killas
Psychopathic, fuck it we be the illest
Keep it the realist
Like everybody else doin that
I'm in the back in black, chillin with the bloody ax
When we attack
We have your whole crew shook
You fake ho's know, Twiztid wrote the god damn book

[Jamie Maddrox]
And I dont give a fuck
Perpetrators you can suck my nuts
Say you bought the album, but dont know a single cut
You's a bandwagon rida givin juggalo's a bad name
We'll fuck you up for that, bitch this ain't no fuckin game
Fuck all that shit that the print wrote
Magazines is toilet paper, glorified for the assholes
Fuck Publication
Syndication
Music Segregation
Cause we run beneath the nation
So bury me alive

[Chorus 1x]

"With a fury of buckshots
God Damn they ruthless." 2x
