Welcome to the first phase of the third day of the killing stage
In a strange way, you won't feel pain, if you feel pain, well I'm sorry but I'm angry
And our anguish is a catalyst for all of this, and all of that, and everything in between
Every nightmare and dream
Every stab, every scream
So they'll be total blood, mix it in, make it clean
By any means, if it means that you'll die
We'll certainly try to put you in graves, dead or alive, so pray to be safe
We'll certainly try to put you in graves, dead or alive, so pray to be safe
We'll certainly try to put you in graves, dead or alive, so pray to be safe

I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO GOOO!!!

Don't kill me now, then I'm gonna kill you. [x4]
If you don't kill me now, then I'm gonna kill you. [x6]
