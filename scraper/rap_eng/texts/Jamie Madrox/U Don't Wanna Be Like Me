[Monoxide]
I can walk on water and freeze it on step one
And then I'll stick my finger in it and melt it like it was hot sun

[Madrox]
Well I can turn your adam's apple into apple juice
Start to strangle muthafuckas 'til their face turn blue

[Monoxide]
I can be the world's greatest serial killer of all time
And I'll end your life at the drop of a dime

[Madrox]
I can float above the clouds, way up in the sky
And it's my choice if I live or die

[Monoxide]
Or I can be the strange pizza man that always knocks twice
And when you open up your door I give your muthafuckin' neck a slice

[Madrox]
I can take a million dollars and just throw it away
Cause it'll never replace a single ounce of my sanity

[Monoxide]
I can be the last angel standing ontop of the hill
Or the green demon waiting on your window sill

[Madrox]
And I can become an icon for the oppressed
Cause their hearts still beating in their unforgiven chest

[Hook: repeat 2X]
(You!) don't wanna be like (Me!)
(You!) don't wanna be like (Me!)
And this is the mind of a serial killa

[Madrox]
I can buy a shotgun from Target with attempts to set it off
I can load that bitch in the parking lot and shoot that shit off

[Monoxide]
And I can be the book of the dead, a Vampire or a demon
But either way your fucked, cause when I leave your not breathin'

[Madrox]
Well I can part the sea with the wand of a wizard
And turn a hot day into a windy blizzard

[Monoxide]
I can be an axe in the backs of people who wanna trash talk
And leave your body slaughtered all over your momma's sidewalk

[Madrox]
I can disappear into the air like a phantom in the night
And I can die if I'm exposed to excessive sunlight

[Monoxide]
And I can show you how to dig a bitches grave in less then 20 seconds
And I'll shove that bitch in there and let her family start to guessin

[Madrox]
I can grab you out of your world and show you horrible things
And I can show you the terror that curiosity brings

[Monoxide]
And I can be the last straw, that puts you over the edge
And leaves 11 at your work place dead

[Hook]
