[Verse 1: Monoxide]
How can I save myself?
When the path that I’ve been walking leads straight to hell
Is there something for sale?
Can you convince me that it ain’t just another walk in the park?
And the road that I’ve been walkin’ up from the start is my heart
And I can wear it on my sleeve until they rip it apart
And continue on my journey to try to get to the top
And it’ll never stop and I refuse to believe
That immortals only measured by selling a CD
Not enough from me, give me the keys to my cemetery gates
And I’ll picture your fate that I can make it
Shine a little light if you can
Cause on the trip where I’m headed, it’s never gonna end

[Hook: Twiztid]
Whether you climb a mountain on your journey to be here
(There’s a long road just ahead what if it leads to nowhere?)
What if it leads to nowhere? x3

[Verse 2: Madrox]
They say to live your life and make your decisions
And twist your perception and everybody’s changin’ but you
Everybody’s patient but who got the reason
Or the passion to do it just like you do?
If it wasn’t for mistakes, you wouldn’t have made a thing
In a heartbeat, I’d bet you’d do it all over again
In a wind’s age, took you ages
To come full circle as you progress
Through fast at many paces
Growing pains and stages, been there done that
On to bigger things now and ain’t no turning back
Got your shit on track and forward destination
But you don’t know where you’re going so you call it a vacation

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Eighty-five on the side street floating
Wondering why me, I’ve got the underground going
And the mainstream hoping that money will be the root of my evil
And people only believing until the sequel
That something equal will come along and try to defeat ya
In the end I’ll be standing on the top like a beacon
Spitting that evil, get ya hyped like a wiccan
Now that’s some shit to believe in

[Verse 4: Madrox]
They say I’m lost but then I find myself
In the middle of nowhere what does it cost
To purchase piece of mind, my sanity’s crumbling
I’m under the raincloud with lighting, thundering
Stumbling, fumbling, far from perfection
Without wicked words they'll withered like an infection
Can we be the medicine to save you once again
You might be lost but you’re surrounded by family and friends

[Hook]
