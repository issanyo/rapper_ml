[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Abused and ridiculed
Iâ€™ll admit that I played the fool
I was bullied when I attended school
I toughed it out and did what I had to do
Thick skin makes it harder to cut them deep wounds
Unless there's already scar tissue covered with attitudes
Emotion is an ocean, it's easy to drown in undertow
It's natural to fight for air and so much harder to let it go
So now I'm broken, incomplete like missing puzzle piece
The darkness overbearing, I'm wondering will it ever cease

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
When I'm watching raindrops fall against the concrete
Like my feet, when I beat the pavement
When I walk away from the hatred
But it follows me, like I make it
Forsaken me cause I take it
Could change it, but nonetheless
I'd rather be myself I guess
Unless the whole day goes by
And I don't feel like I'm gonna fucking die
Wrong or right, be it day or night
That's how I feel and I can't help it
But I can't tell if it's all a dream
Cause this here don't feel right to me
I can't be who I wanna be
But you, you're just like everything that we see

[Hook 1: Jamie Madrox]
Tell me it's over
I need the closure
You was supposed to
Make it all go away
Can you make it all go away {x4}

What is the purpose
I don't deserve this
Under the surface
Can you take it away
Can you make it all go away {x4}

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Sometimes it's hard just to fit in
Be it your size, your shape, or the tone and color of skin
Maybe deformity, abnormally, I'm different
But why are they so superior and I've been insignificant
I'm like a painting of confused brush strokes
A whipping post and just another face for them cruel jokes
I wear it all like a horrible suit of shame
I'm damaged already, and no, I'll never be the same

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Not the norm, won't conform
Against the grain from the day he was born
Please just treat him like a monster, or
Evermore declare war on a misfit
That's what I get for being different
Anybody want to walk in my kicks?
Please do so, cause I know
That anybody wanting to get into my soul
Has a long, dark road to toll
When your all alone with no one to help
Feel lost, just walking in circles
Well that's just how my life has felt
Can't believe that being me
Can make some narcs so angrily
So I just keep it Twiztid and represent for the family

[Hook 2: Jamie Madrox]
Tell me it's over
I need the closure
You was supposed to
Make it all go away
Can you make it all go away {x4}

[Verse 5: Monoxide]
Everyday with that same dream
Yelling about the same thing
Telling her what you gonna do
Bunch of mights and maybes
Complaints and fake schemes
Out of your mouth on the daily
But you follow through, want everything else
It's just as weak as your daydreams
And I'm stuck here in this nightmare
Well aware that you don't care
If I took my last breath of air
And just like that, I disappear

[Verse 6: Jamie Madrox]
So insecure, my line between fantasy and reality
To me, is nothing more than blurred
My confidence is gone
And all I got going for me is that I'm breathing
And these words to this fucking song
Could it be possible that someone feels like I
Someone to tell me that it's over, there's really no need to cry
So I'm bending knees, I'm looking up to the sky
Please make it go away, make it stop or just let me die

[Hook 1]
