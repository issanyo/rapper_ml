[Jamie Madrox]
Yo Fritz, put on a motherfucking beat
That we can shake our motherfucking rolls to
Yo, fat kidz are ya with me?
Put your motherfucking hands high in the air, let me see your little chubby digits
It's about to get sweaty in here ya'll, you might want to bring a fan
It ain't easy, being about 250, when you're 15 years old
That's what real life's about

Hey yo, fat people are hard to kidnap
So if you're fat and you're all in this bitch, then grab your nutsack
Fat bitches, don't feel left out
Cause you can grab one of these skinny bitches, and knock her ass out
Chubby love, show a ninja some
Cause this fat motherfucker stay ready however they come
A hungry rapper, cannibal lyricist
I got hunks of MC's like you inside my shit
Standing poolside with a t-shirt on
Unless I'm showering or fucking, my clothes stay on
I got double cheeseburgers chasing me in my sleep
And fine hoes checking me out but scared to speak
Off the chain, off the scale, I ain't watching no weight
I'm at the barbecue high ass hell fixing a plate
XX to the X-L, hit me 3 times
Come correct with my burger and fries, the king sized

King Kong Bundy, Fat Joe, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Fat Albert
