[Intro]
Every man has a breaking point
No matter who they are
And nothing seems to push a man to his breaking point
Faster than the one (one) woman (woman)
Right now you're gonna hear about three individual man
The dealer, the player and the addict
And how a woman drove them to their breaking point
Out of line? Out of mind? You decide

[Madrox Intro]
Hey I'm just callin' you again for like 85th time
I got my test results back the other day
And they said shit ain't lookin' good for me
Turns out some dumb fucking bitch got me marked
And guess what? Guess who's fucking house I'm coming to right now bitch?
You better lock your fucking doors

[Verse 1: Madrox]
I fucked this one bitch raw, like porno flicks
She was working my dick like my shit was a joystick
Now I didn't love her at all, but the pussy was irreplaceable
Piping out in her parkin lot, on the kitchen table
I'm able to bust up in her, she said that she's on the pill
And fucking without no rubber always enhances the feel
I started dripping like lava man from my third eye
And the clinics started asking me questions 'bout my sex life
Do I share needles with heroin heads, how many bitches Have I had
In and outta my fucking bed, giving me head
Visons of tearing her up, cuttin' her up
Ghost like, gaspin' for air, choking with her throat cut
I'm waiting on the results, diggin' her grave plot
But I'll pay this bitch back in space for whatever I got
I tried to get back at her, but the word on the street
Must've least changed another and then that bitch creeped

[Hook x2]
Sex, drugs, money and murder
Should be the last one that you ever heard of
Should be the last one making me nervous
I love sex, drugs, money and murder

[Verse 2: Shoestring]
Money yack and murder, when I catch the bitch I hurt her
Bust you in your titty, you gonna die, bitch, you deserter
Sleep in the bucker, till I grab my dick like fuck it
Talk and set me up bustin' that Lisa ass in public
She snitched on my brother, I'm searchin' for no other
Lisa ass gone somewhere they won't discover
In the bottem of a pit, puttin' holes in the fit
I chained her to a tub so her body gotta sit
Had a tutu and a bra, but I broke the bitches jaw
I'm a pimping these bitches, Don't you cross me cause I'm raw
Shoestring that be my name, Dayton family on my chain
I whoop a dude's ass, I be murdering in the rain
Fucking around with Twiztid, sippin on the mystic
Murder on the scene, all they found was some lipstick
I ain't gonna tell you shit, I ain't saying nothing never heard of
I love sex, drugs, money and murder

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Bootleg]
Sex, drugs, money and murder not for all folk
This bitch Tammy pulled a whammy, got away with all my dope
But when I catch her, I'm gonna stretch her, she will only fuck
Posted outside of ther door, just like a comcast truck
Fun and chains, play no games, I'll put one in your brains
Your outta your league, like highschoolers playing Lebron James
I guess that bitches eyes closed, she can clearly see
She bout to D.I.E. for fucking with my money tree
B double O.T.L.E.G. bitch I'm gonna straight OG
I burn your house down, lyrical bombs floating outisde the derbis
Fuck with my cash, that's yo ass, I'm an armed granade
About to explode on you hoes, until everything get's paid
This is more than the name of a crew, bitch don't get it Twiztid
Have your momma at the cemetery playing you visits
Run off with mine and they gonna find your bitch ass in the gutterr
Fucking with Twiztid and The Family is another murder

[Hook x2]
