[Hook: Jamie Madrox] {x2}
They say that
Those in hell won't come back
Eternally in pits of darkness
It's the hardest thing to break someone free

[Bridge: Jamie Madrox] {x2}
(Come save me) I don't wanna be here
(Don't leave me) By myself, no one is here
In darkness alone

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Wanna hear about the night when Jamie Madrox died?
And I had to get him out of hell, and to my surprise
He had every serial killa standin' side by side
And they were all singin' along to "We don't die"
And the fire was burnin' strong, using heads for his bongs
He was the king of everything wrong
And he didn't wanna come back home
But I told him, everything down here would disappear
When I make that clear, it's all a ploy to keep you near
And he just looked and gave a sneer, and said:
I'm not the Devil, but I'm bad as him
And that motherfucker, he left as soon as I walked in
And I'm the reason when you're breathing
All you're smelling is sin
So when I died, I came to the place that I best fit in
And I place shackles on the demon, I watch, souls are tied
Like a couple of nooses, now there's no more excuses
Why I cannot be ruling everything he was doing
Instead he left and I guess he meant
That hell got bent on the day he went, "nah"

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Once upon a time, when Monoxide died
Had to get him out of hell, to my surprise
Closed my eyes and I journeyed to the other side
The night, the void of all light, hope everything goes right
Got an axe and a piece of a map, it's a one way trip
Ain't nobody comin' back but I am comin' back
And I'm bringin' Monoxide back with me
Hell better know about that
Swing, chop, mowin' down everything that's in my way
And the angels, they say
The demons they know are keeping him close
And demons don't play
Clean move away, I'm cuttin' heads off
No time for small talk, across the catwalk
Wait a minute, I see, never must've been, hear me
Surrounded by eleven and they all look grim
Butcher aprons with blood stains
Faces are pigs with people brains
All their sorts in wicked things, chained and summoning
Trying to put the spirit of the Devil in my brother
Must be outta your mind motherfucker
I'm standing right here with a double headed axe
Ready to fade to black, we gonna kill one another
Three of the pig face demons, they lunge toward me
Waving their blades in my face tryin' to sword me
All I can think is saving my brother
Bringing him back to the world, it's about to get gory
Three dead demons as seven still stand here
Blood on my body, my axe, and my hand, and
All of the sudden they start eating his soul
And he starts to scream and I lose control
Chopping down demons, still screaming at red eyes
And demons are all turning him black
Then I break through the shackles, both wrists and ankles
Grab Monoxide and I climb right back

Come save me, don't leave me, in darkness alone {x2}
