[Verse 1: Monoxide]:
Goddamnit can't stand it
Won't have it fake rappers can't hack it
With the axe and both slaps
Backstabbers don't matter just cheddar
Like swing batter batter swing batter batter
Havin lot of beef in the battle through your dreams
And it seems that it'll hit you'll never be better MNE rather
It'll be scattered when the breathe batter
Like I'm the batter
Fuck it just what I'm seeing with a green hammer
Leaving it all to me and ima remedy your gene path
Fuck it let the beef happen

[Verse 2: Madrox]:
Feeling anti-hero
Ima let the hold in the soul hit zero
All the glitters and gold is it in your window
You been lookin in a cracked mirror not a clear window
And thought that too many times ive been the victim and lost
And my mindsets ready to win no matter cost
And I might get lost in the maze of life these days and the hurdles I continue to come across keep prayin
You could be that strong, you could have that strength, you could move them lives
You can sing them songs
People know your shit
Heads here and there in line
Lines of cokeheads attendin focus
And love and respect to those who take notice
Beat down and hopeless
Left to drown in an ocean we part like moses
That's the power of the passion of poets
When the limelights on here hell yeah better go bitch
We the ninjas in the mopeds
We the dopest in the showbiz
Y'all better know this

[Hook]:
I see em smilin when they hatin me
Now I'm breaking away from everything
I watch my dreams turn to dust
People turnin their backs on us
And now we don't know who to trust now
I see em smilin when they hatin me
Now I'm breaking away from everything
I watch my dreams turn to dust
People turnin their backs on us
And now we don't know who to trust now

[Interlude: Monoxide]:
You don't wanna fuck with us
You don't fuck with us
Come get it
You don't wanna fuck with us
You don't fuck with us
Goddamnit
You don't wanna fuck with us
You don't fuck with us
Goddamnit
You don't wanna fuck with us
You don't fuck with us

[Verse 3: The R.O.C.]:
Always last in your thoughts of course
Rarely seen in the scheme shown off
No not me not the R.O.C
In the vast of seas while I roughly breathe
Social merge the purge
And my music's absurd
Tryna have the nerve
To wanna see my urge
Eatin up my word
Faceplant this verse
Never stop the hurt
Words all on earth
Them shit stain
No dream of nightmare
Compare the revenant appear but you ain't comin back
That's no threat but facts
Who's in the back of the back
Lurkin adrenaline black
Bitch me R.O.C
You still dont see its cool with me
Ain't no need to try to touch
Because we scream don't fuck with us
Then you gone bitch

[Hook]:
I see em smilin when they hatin me
Now I'm breaking away from everything
I watch my dreams turn to dust
People turnin their backs on us
And now we don't know who to trust now
I see em smilin when they hatin me
Now I'm breaking away from everything
I watch my dreams turn to dust
People turnin their backs on us
And now we don't know who to trust now

[Verse 4: Lex The Hex Master]:
My heart my soul my passion
My work my hustle my grind
Tunnel vision and I keep goin mashin
Never stop since the day i been signed
On a thin line tryna get mine
I combine to a lace so I'm speeding up mine
Now I'm eating off rounds
You're repeating all lines from the death of my mind
I'm a whole different kind I know
When I'm on stage and screamin out go
You feel a rush I feel when I flow
MNE bitch and if you ain't know
I'm still here show to show with my bros
Deep roll and I move like a dozer
To the top and its only getting closer
Fuck money, fuck fame, fuck hoes
We gonna tear down till the whole shows over

[Verse 5: ClockworC]
Got a bitch runnin below and cock your lady
Got a meltdown then I catch master the baby
I don't trust myself in a world unjust
Gotta tip scales sound so in my hell that I fell
In a nightmare riggin gorillaville feeling just strange
Both legs got pegs then I ran uphill
Got a roundhouse take your teeth out
Blow your house down cryin out
Wildin when you let the inner beast out
You go and hide behind your Cheshire smile
We ask doctors gonna get turned and high
I'm surgical when I murderply
Y'all lost in the bottom of my turning tide
I been bred to be the one that sees your mind and give the fucks so redefine
You need to cut and fillin my cup in this offer rises blood for blood

[Hook]:
I see em smilin when they hatin me
Now I'm breaking away from everything
I watch my dreams turn to dust
People turnin their backs on us
And now we don't know who to trust now
I see em smilin when they hatin me
Now I'm breaking away from everything
I watch my dreams turn to dust
People turnin their backs on us
And now we don't know who to trust now
