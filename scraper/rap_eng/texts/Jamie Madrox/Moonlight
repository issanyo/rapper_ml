[Verse 1: Monoxide]
All alone in my
Little world and I
Love being different than everyone, go outside
Just take a look and you'll realize
Hope you don't think that I'm...
Just being a dick or a douche
I'm only here to bring you the truth
Fuckin' with the Diabolical Duo
Make you hate being you
Keep you in the house like a curfew

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Understand you can never take anything we have
Cause it's not ours to steal
Now what's keepin' it real?
Cause real's keepin' it kept
Willing to push boundaries
No matter who get upset
True love or music
True fakes and perpetrators runnin' the same course
All beatin' the same dead horse
Like a drum but no rhythm
So what else could I expect
I get tired of repetition and I often disconnect

[Hook]
Look at me, I'm alive
You can see my breath tonight
All of the stars are in the sky
Under the moonlight
Under the moon, tonight
Never got a chance to say goodbye
I'm always wrong, you're always right
Under the moonlight

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
I don't mean no disrespect
So don't take it personal
RÃ ule 5: stick in booth, keep it versatile
Rule 12: In this underground hell manuel I quote
Atlantis never cracked so the bubble is still afloat
And the bigger the pie piece the better that it tastes
So I bother, cuttin' it up, smashin' in the face
[Bare pick?] with a full tongue, surrounded by glass jaws
Who with one hit fall straight to the asphalt

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Always cloned, never replicated
Made it point to get the world aggravated
Outrageous, don't like famous
So we keep the contacts and face stay painted
Y'all shit's tainted and we're poisonous
I'm a venomous snakebite and you're all
Dangerous like a condom with a rip
Still chainsmokin', so keep your cigarettes lit

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Monoxide]
Moved down to the 'burbs now
I can still spit that trap, just use different words; how?
Well never call weed that chicken
Cause out in the suburbs the police listen
Windows tinted, they stare even more
That's just enough reason for them to come up to your door
Nothin' more, nothin' less
And they watch me out here like a dime in her dress
Put your eyeballs to rest and quit wastin' my time
Tearin' up the inside of my ride
Hope you find what you're lookin' for
You're searchin' real hard ("found the marijuana")
Bitch, I got a weed card
I love to get high but I wanna be a star
And I ain't tryin' to live behind bars
So I had to get
The legal weed script
Now when they catch me with a bag they can't say shit

[Hook]
