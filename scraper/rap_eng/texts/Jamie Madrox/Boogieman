[Hook: Twiztid]
I bring that boogie, man
That boogieman is wicked
Only the boogie can
Make the dead wake up and get it
Boogieman, boogie, boogie
Make the people lose their shit wit
Boogieman, boogie, boogie
Make the people lose their shit wit

From every cemetery
To every mausoleum
We bring the boogieman
Everyone is about to see him
Boogieman, boogie, boogie
Make the people lose their shit wit
Boogieman, boogie, boogie
Make the people lose their shit wit

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Pitch black like shadows
Hanging out like gallows
Locked him with them shallows
Evils and ferals
I rock the dead like apparel
Speaking the words of the tarot
I'm locked in with the pharaoh
Like an arrow aimed at your face, got a pair on
Not here for the accolades
So I sit here and I pack grenades
Inside words and I hurl away
Until the world becomes my cemetery
This ain't no Child's Play
Charles Lee Ray can't stop me
I'm made up of demon's blood and I rock with them zombies
I live in the darkness
Death is what I encompass
Brought back by the musical voodoo in which I come with
Witchcraft - I run shit
In graveyards, I'll come get
Enough souls to mosh pit
And just start to rock shit
Anybody got a tombstone?
Watch as I get it grooved on
You probably better move on
Or become part of my group home
New song, move along
And I'm gone just like that
You belong in a place just like that
Just hold your breath and I'll be right back
Just like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Gonna make you dance
Whether or not, you want to
Skeleton hands everywhere surround you
Cemeteries, zombies are hungry and need food
And hoping to eat you, you're a dancing fool
Better come to boogie cause it's starting to rain
More like a lightning storm, as we perform
You're gonna fall in the grave
Better glue your ass onto the dancefloor
Pass more bodies to the morgue
Gather outside the mausoleum door
Turn the base so we can fit them all
Mosh pit shoving, whatchu fighting for?
Thunder and lightning, I was gonna pour
Dancing on graves cause we rotten to the core
Finish on the creature dance, I'm the boogieman
Jumping like I'm dunking a hoop through a backboard
I tried to tango with a torso and I let go
They dance too slow, not funky enough
And bitch I came to boogie ho
Gotta get your two left feet and feel the beat
So you can shake them tats
The boogieman don't care less
If you got one arm, no legs, or half a face
You feel the rain in the dark
You're bleedin', sweatin', it's fine
It's to get chicks into shakin' their hips
Emerge for the darkness on the grind
On ya, whether alive or whether you're dead
When that boogieman is breathin' it's easy to lose your head

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Itâ€™s like a rave in a cemetery
Bodies everywhere, see the dead here, see the dead there
Ain't nobody scared
And compared to the prom, this shit's the bomb
And I'm fucked up, finna get my boogie on
Get a dance like I know I can
Ain't nobody bragging, shit I know I'm sweet
And me and M-O-N-O, we came to be
Cause we're dancing with Majik Ninja feet
To the vampire, to the werewolf
Till the boogieman comes we fucking grind
Do this shit every day of my life
To the moon in the sky each and every night
Bring the boogieman everywhere we go
Every song in the studio, every video
Every show when you know that we go loco
When we rep the dead yo and that's fosho

[Hook]
