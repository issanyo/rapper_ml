[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I'm up to the ceiling with feelin
They caught him dealin with this, people concealin their real fears
Now they got me reelin and spinnin a million circles of whirlwind
It's out of control and I can't believe that I just won't let it go
I'm bout to explode or corrode from this road that I've chosen
Who knows if it goes to the heart of the soul of a friend or a foe
Is it light, Is it dark, Is it real, is it for?
You're a monster hiding in sight of a black cloud
Shrouded in self-loathing, backstabbing the crowd
And you hate me for where I'm from
And I'm never goin back down
You're just goin through the emotions, yellin shit to be loud
I'm too focused on the potion to be concerned with all that now
So please do us all a favor and quit hovering over our's
We're all too focused on the potion to be concerned with all that now
So please do us all a favor and quit hovering...

[Hook: Madrox]
Turn up the madness
And make everything fall away
Fall a victim to sadness
And it's all goin crazy for me

[Bridge: Monoxide]
Break these black clouds in half for me

[Verse 2: Madrox]
Whenever the world gets [beat/me] down, I feel beat down
Need a release now, they've got me inner [peace/beast] out
I try to rebound, everything goes down
Feel like I'm diseased, how can they get the cold out?
I took my soul out and put it back in
And said If I'm not a loser then why do I never win?

[Hook: Madrox]
Turn up the madness
And make everything fall away
Fall a victim to sadness
And it's all goin crazy for me

[Bridge: Monoxide]
Break these black clouds in half for me
