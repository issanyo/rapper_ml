Daddy I'm high as a cloud floating looking to touch
Anything soft enough I can bust my nuts on
Like them average ass titties of yours
Now I done seen many, many pairs of titties before
But them titties right there look suckable to me
With the nipple in the middle where the sucker supposed to be
She got a kinda banging booty, kinda more not than so
If I don't drop this load, my nuts are gonna explode

[Monoxide]
Now I'm stone sober in a room full of ugly
All I want to do is get some ass tonight
And if I, play my cards right and smoke this weed
Then I'll be swimming in some ass like the tsunami
And it won't matter if she, kinda looks like a he
Cause as long as I stay high they're all dimes to me
Bumping Ron Isley in the truck with the tree
Getting high hoping this ugly bitch will fuck me

[Hook]
Now you look like Madonna with a splash of J-Lo
Mixed with Halle Berry and some Anna Nicole
Cause when I'm smoking every girl I see seems to be
So off the chain
A little Gwen Stefani and some Fergie and Brittney
Charlise Thereon with some Angelina Jolie
Cause when I'm smoking every girl I see seems to be
So off the chain

[Monoxide]
Sometimes we would get high in the back
And there'd always be this girl with a super nipple rack
And I, wouldn't hit it with a bat if I'm not stoned
But fuck it since I'm high little ugly got boned
I'm in the zone I'm high kinda trippin off of this
Everywhere that I look's a fine bitch
Goddamnit, I love this weed
Cause every last bitch looks good to me

[Jamie Madrox]
Beauty is skin deep, and ugly is to the bone
Ain't no reason that banging ass need to be having pants on
I like that upside down heart that lives inside you g-string
Packed to the max with needful things
Like coochie and butt watch it jiggle and such
As she walks by with that run way strut
I'm mesmerized on how much ass calf n' thighs
You managed to stuff inside them Levi's

[Hook]
You look like Jenna Jameson and Vivica Foxy
With a splash Viva Guerra and Beyonce
Cause when I'm smoking every girl I see seems to be
So off the chain
A little Paris Hilton and some Gretchen Wilson
With a splash of Ashlee n' Jessica Simpson
Cause when I'm smoking every girl I see seems to be
So off the chain

[Jamie Madrox]
Your lips are just so soft and supple
I'm willing to bet the farm she got a tight moose knuckle
I'm seeing so many turkeys that I wouldn't mind stuffing
Like that one right here, I bet she like it rough and hard
And if she wanna cuddle right quick
Turn an indoor ho into an outdoor trick
Let her suck your dick in a public bathroom
While there's other people on the side of you taking a dune

[Monoxide]
Now I'm walking through the mall
And I'm high as the sun
And I swear this bitch's ass is looking like a cinna-bun
And then I go and get a pretzels from aunt Annie's
Then I fell in love with her flabby fanny
I'm getting outta here before my penis gets hard
And I get thrown out by the security guards
Feeling like a retard, I'm horny and high
But I'm almost outta weed so I'm saying goodbye
