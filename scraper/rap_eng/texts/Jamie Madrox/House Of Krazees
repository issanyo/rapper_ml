Killa real muthafuka, ask, who's next
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat nine bullets in yo fuking chest
Im a night Stalker
Told ya about my black magic
Im a Psychopathic
The nigga that let your family feeling tragic
Known as a hoe
Still I take no shorts
I roll up on the sceen and smoke yo ass like a Newport
The Krazy Klan was just a figmint of my existance
Now it's time for me to show these hoes who dis is bitch
Im just another lunatic
Trying to get paid off, some lyrics, some locs, and additude
And a fucking gague
But if some silly ass mark try to talk shit
E.X.P will clock his motherfucking gat and say fuck it
No One Can Do It Better
House of Krazees
No One Can Do It Better
House of Krazees
No One Can Do It Better
House of Krazees
No One Can Do It Better
House of Krazees
Looney Toons, Floating Rooms, Witches Outta the East Bitch
You'll find me chillin in the belly in the beast bitch
Psychopath feel the wrath, asylum in the house yo
Crush yo fucking skull with a god damn cue ball
Blood and guts you silly sluts
No mercy for the hoes
Leave ya stinking while im banking braking in da door
Shakey muthafucka have you screaming bloody murder
Rub the fire my desire is to torture and to burn ya
666 my lucky numbers when im rolling
Full of rigamortis so the bodies all swollin
Find them in the basement in the celler to the left
He was slipping, I was trippin so I beat his ass to death
93' is here, its the season of the witch
Show me you belong, Sew yo eyes shut with a stich
My mind was playing trick on me
They said I couldn't handle it
So they took my size for a brand new straight jacket
Commiting suicide
Kill yourself it don't amaze me
Cuz Im locked in
