[Hook: Monoxide]
We put our hands in the air
And celebrate like we don't care
Prey for me (hell yeah) [Nobody preys with us (in Madrox part)]
Got you screamin' at the top of your lungs

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
I could really use help right now
My world keeps fallin' down
Downward spiral notebook
Don’t drink that milk from a tainted cow
Don't need no SWAT pig or police to leave us the fuck alone
Don't welcome wannabe thugs
It's the underground that we call our home
Don't need no politicians or revolutions to light our path
Your opinion is irrelevant and so is ours, so why the fuck they ask
Don't need no institutions or false predictions to lead the way
All you gotta do is put your hands together
And close your eyes and commits the prey

[Hook x3]

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Feel like I'm tangled up in... spiderwebs or somethin'
Look like you found or lost it, I can't get away from nothin'
Don't look like you don't know
That you're the reason I wrote the flows
Damn shame, yes I'm hopeless
And I maintain to keep you focus
Hate the game, flow with Lotus
Got hopes to change, hope to get noticed
Hope but don’t explode the boat
That will carefully go like floatin'
(Bow down) You've been blest by the ghost of us
Find the faith in the strangers place
And they say it’s all who you trust

[Hook]

(Look like you found or lost it, I can't get away from nothin')
(Don't need no institutions or false predictions)
(Don't look like you don't know
That you're the reason I wrote the flows)
(All you gotta do is put your hands together
And close your eyes and commits the prey)
