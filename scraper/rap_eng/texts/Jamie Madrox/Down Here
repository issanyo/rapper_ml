[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Your world embraces beauty while shunning ugly
My kind remains beneath you while your world remains above me
Feeling I'm on pause - my mind state, yo it shoves me
Hate me or love me, I feel like I'm back in recovery
Time to stand up, man up from sad state
And walk like an animal amongst the primates
And talk like a cannibal ready to eat those
Who stand in the way of the new maze in the end days

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I come from a place where the dark hides
While you starve for the light like illuminated apartheid
We are the wicked, check the archives
Spread like sickness, I don't need a fix
It's another something creeping up into all minds
Please forgive us, we tend to gather in dark times
Can I get a witness too, it's been falling from my eyes
Just wanna die when the lights shines

[Hook: Twiztid] {x2}
Down here
This is the only life that we know
Down here
We tell 'em everywhere that we go
Down here
You know we bring the darkness to life
Down here

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
To the psychos, skitzos, freek shows, and creeps
We bring the underground back to life and give it heartbeat
Reason to be strong, last long, and hold on
While other motherfuckers who claim it, they came and passed on
We the original, pedigree, thoroughbred
OG, diemuthafuckadie, rock the dead
Siamese twins, crimson guard, new elite
Ready for war, nocturnal
Bitches, we don't sleep

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
We took the roads that are less traveled
And unraveled the code
They want lock and it load, like it's a gun battle
It showed everyone I suppose
Exactly how to get here and survive down below
But instead most of those chose to find the light
And I suppose it'd be alright if they were standing here tonight
But they ain't want to listen like I had static on the mic
But that was just a sign of their spite
I had to sit and think about betrayal and I died
At least a little piece of me was twisted up inside
And I don't mean Twiztid up like contacts and knives
I mean twisted, like damn, all that was a lie?
Like damn, no more homies by my side?
No more happenings of anything, and I broke down despite
I know I said it was forever until the day that we died
But I never thought you'd be the reason we'd have to fight to survive
But everybody gathered, and they all stood by our side
And that's the reason we're never leaving what they've designed
Something even greater than anything you can find
And down here is the only place it survives

[Hook] {x2}

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
Down here we sing of dark things, the other side of normal
Dressed for death in suit and ties - bitches, keep it formal
Sleep the night away in caskets and graves
And awaken from their slumber each
And every time the song plays
You see us crawling from the ground like a Romero flick
Contaminating up the top side, we stay sick
There is no cure or vaccine so they quarantine
Our inner being and label each and all of us the enemy

[Hook] {x2}
