Hallow
You are hallow like a well with no water and everyone's thirsty
Above all now adays everyone's confused and distraught and everything's so promising
Let down just stand on ur feet if you fall and have courage to walk again

[Hook]
Tomorrow we will talk about yesterday
Right now I got nothin' to say honestly
Feel betrayed like my love was ripped outta me
The cycle it's all too fimiliar to me
The cycle it's all too fimiliar to me

[Monoxide]
Long day
Feeling like i'm the only one running from someone
I Can't seem to get away
Trapped now
Hiding away from the world with eye's closed and pretending I'm dead today
Shadows
Shadows scarpe across the floor as I wait for the sun to return to me

[Hook]

[Monoxide & Madrox]
My eye's don't see... nothing but greed ur life Your hate!
Broken, thrown away my eye's still glow these feeling's come and go your life jealousy these things
Should cease to be my apologese when you think of me will you over look all that
I've come to be we can find a way we can make it trough can we shake this pain that has this hold on you!?
Hold on you
Hold on you

[Hook]
