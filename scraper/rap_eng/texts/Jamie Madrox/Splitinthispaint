[Intro: Jamie Madrox]
Cause I'm a monster
And the whole world wants to bury me in a grave so deep
But you don't have what it takes to put a split in this paint so you gon have to deal with me
But I'm a monster
And the whole world wants to bury me in a grave so deep
But I've been away for like a century and now I'm awake
And the rest of the world fast asleep

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Pictures being painted by people's interpretations
Or what they wanna hear in all of my situations
I ain't come here for a chance at imitation
But you makin' it clear that that's exactly what I'm facing
Fuckin' family is all but disintegrated on the brink of eliminated
Hope we can see where all the cancer isn't eliminated
We'll find the answer together like we were meant to make it badder than ever
Wish it was a lever that I could pull and take it over forever
Not to be inundated by the fiendish and clever several of times
I can see it from the look in your eyes
Its getting hard for you to living a lie but your pride has got you totally blind
I'm not the monster in the seed
I'm the monster that can eat you in your sleep but represent you to the E N from the T
Here to reinvigorate everything you believe and middle fingers to everyone thats in between

[Hook]
But I'm a monster
And the whole world wants to bury me in a grave so deep
But I been away for like a century and now I'm awake
And the rest of the world fast asleep

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
I'm a lunatic who been doing this shit throughout time
Like an indentured servant the wicked rhymes several times
To the top of the pyramid scheme
Who promises of big dreams, dollar signs and everything in between
Honestly believed in this shit for a while though
Constantly belittled played daily maliciously multiple mind jokes
My folks counted on me like they always do
I'm barefoot backward and hell for each and all you
While me and Paul are doing me and Paul are doing it in life and followed you and kept the business something you would never do
We expected you to take the revenue and I don't need it
You prove us right instead of showing some sorta better you
You put a target on the hearts we hold dear in an attempt to show you have no fear
Now you see, crying grown man tears, telling me about peace
Fuck you and the police I see yo ass up in the streets

[Outro]
Cause I'm a monster
And the whole world wants to bury me in a grave so deep
But you don't have what it takes to put a split in this paint so you gon have to deal with me
But I'm a monster
And the whole world wants to bury me in a grave so deep
But I've been away for like a century and I'm awake
And the rest of the world fast asleep
