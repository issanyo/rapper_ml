[Intro]
For the next 24 hours
Any and all murder, madness, and mayhem
Will be legal in all states across our glorious America
We can only hope that the bloodshed will help to cleanse
Each and every one of your wretched souls
So join us, as we pledge our allegiance to the violence
And we commence the first annual Death Day

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
It's been a century or two
They tried to erase the fool
Raised on what he will and what he won’t do
Mask of a killa that wait to stalk you
In a parking lot with a butcher knife
So true to the original
Ten or more points on the mouth line
Two eye holes, mostly orange on the outside
Black Hole Sun Soundgarden feeling outshined
Underneath the straight line on the lower south side
Home knife catch moonlight bred
Swipe left, up and down, in and out, dead
Couple dead bodies, no hands, no head
You could see the flies gathering the work shed
I ain't even work yet, car vape rhymes in the dermis
High boys keep it ice cold like a thermos
Dirty wilin' out and we don’t need a purpose
To infect you with the rhymes and we service, you nervous
These birds are just killing it, hug it like the original
Kneel in the presence of the candle lit vigil
Throw whatever blessings and ceremony or rituals
Your impressions are still invisible
And we indivisble, skin so crazy, unpredictable
Exorcism in the lyrical, shit is far from spiritual
And we bringin' death like a funeral
Keep these crazy motherfuckers turnin' up and here we go

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
Only got 24 hours to purge out the system
To make a better person with the hate and the wisdom
Do you pledge your allegiance to the violence?
You right with the mutants and monsters beside us
Kill, kill, let em live till they die, die, die
Find a place to hide, run, run, hope they don't find you
Too late the killas are behind you

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Blood, there was so much blood
No telling what the fuck this was
You could hear it squishing through the rug
There was so much blood, so much blood
Make sure there's no one left
Burn it down and then on to the next
Fuck this town, I ain't done yet
The purge is coming, I'm about to set it on fire
Bring the gusto, it ain't none yo, but if you must know
They call me a maniac, I’m more like a psycho
What’s the difference? how the fuck should I know
I just want to purge tonight
Face painted got the urge and might
Now make it to the early light
Don't take it like a scared and fight
Just know about that murderer life

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
Only got 24 hours to purge out the system
To make a better person with the hate and the wisdom
Do you pledge your allegiance to the violence?
You right with the mutants and monsters beside us
Kill, kill, let em live till they die, die, die
Find a place to hide, run, run, hope they don’t find you
Too late the killas are behind you

[Outro: Jamie Madrox]
Kill, kill, let em live till they die, die, die
Find a place to hide, run, run, hope they don't find you
Too late the killas are behind you, death
Kill, kill, die, die, run, run, too late the killas are behind you
