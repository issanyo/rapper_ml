[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I'm the problem, not the answer
And I'm eatin' up your pussy rappers like I was a cervical cancer
I keep slaughterin' emcees and feedin' to the beast with their carcass
And ain't a motherfucker alive who could finish off what we started
Broke hearted in bullet till I black hearted it fully
Ready to end somebody's life off bein' someone prematurely
The reaper's comin' early, in the form of the twins
We're bringin' the darkness like we stitched up both of your eyelids
And the minions, they just want us to keep feedin' the beast
Screamin', "Gimme blood, gimme souls, gimme a rapper to eat!"
I've been unleashed, like a pitbull who ain't been fed in a week
Roamin' the streets I'm gland pressure like I'm stoppin' a leak
And I give a fuck about a daydream cause it's done when I speak
And the last thing on my motherfucking mind is some sleep
And I'm designed to be unkind to the ones who find that I'm not blind
And I see everything you doing, bitch, welcome to my food line

[Hook]
(So feed the beast)
When you eject light
(Feedin' to the beast)
You have embraced darkness
(So feed the beast)
All that's left
(Feedin' to the beast)
Is we steal the show
We stole the show
We stole the show

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Time to bless 'em with A game, cracks in my frame
Look like broken glasses, still he methodic, rockin' some new frames
We not no name of fifty chains or fifteen saves of our throw play
Sick of honorin', one style's the same
Know me and Monoxide killin' it
They salt like water, me and my ninja, a couple villians
One of a kind, not one of a billion
Flow so sick, got a round and pill in
Great way to talk, throw it up, that motherfucker versus us
That's exactly the way they envision you gettin' done
Did killed by the man and I press restart, no time
(Game is over player one)
We number two, that mean that we the shit
Recovers till live performances to the way we spit
And just like Hammer, you probably cannot touch this
Probably shouldn't, we ain't no shit you wanna fuck with
So feed the beast, give it something at least
Give it war, give it peace
Spiritualism moment, increasing the deceased
Let it know that we're adding slack to the leash
And the monster, when it devours, on Parkinson's it will feast
(There's a demon) alive and breathing inside, better call a priest
They're no longer wanting for darkness till bringing slaughter to see

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Face the facts, your shit is wacker than wack
Wacker than a wagoon in the back with a handful of thumbtacks
You're like some fuckin' corny wrestling act
When I come back you're like an entree
Terror then in the face of a fat ass
Andre the giant defiant, I'm a rebel, I'm sprung shade
Feeding the people like I was a Gandhi
The wicked shit, I'm not, hey
I'm just a kid from the bow down
Not a sumo, kunane
From my believes (sold out)
