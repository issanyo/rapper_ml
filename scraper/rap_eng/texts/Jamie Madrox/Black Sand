[Violent J]
A black sand storm is approaching the metropolis
Sucking up sunlight it moves on top of us
Beaches of black sand are littered with dead fish
Black sand deserts grow blood red cactus
Dust devils twist human bodies in half
Black sands down the hourglass that's our ass
This ain't the past that we live in we're not forgiven
It's death at the hands of the lands we've been given

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
A murdering sense feel the essence of the black sand
The sight alone cause trauma to a mortal man
Smoke starts rising and images appear
My next victim's death replays over in the mirror
Grains of black sand the coming of your end
All you ever loved is now a barren wasteland
Lost forever and still you will descend
You're caught between light and dark within the black sand

[Hook x2]
Black sand blowing in the sky
Close your eyes
Funnels whipping by, it surrounds you
(Don't look or you'll turn to stone)

[Jamie Madrox]
In the black sand I draw a diagram
A mythical imaginary wondrous land
Where pharaohs once inhabited and pyramids abashed
Till the sky ate the sun turning everything to black
Night was eternal no more shadow of the Sphinx
RA the sun God then became extinct
Millions withered and died and turned to dust
Till the lightning hit the pyramids and everyone was crushed

[Monoxide Child]
Black sand mortal's end
Time for the Lotus to claim reign again
Cross legged I sit surrounded
Cops around them who plot the worlds end
Shots fired at my direction
But I'm protected by the black sands within
Now watch me disappear in the air so thin
As I now begin the end of all men

[Hook x2]

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
In your face black sand thrown
Then my knife rips you open from your balls to your dome
Lotus roots planted deep down in this shit
When the petals bloom that's when wigs get flipped
A world where the darkness consuming your soul
Sand leaking out your ass, nose, eyes and ear holes
Now you on your knees praying for your life
Too bad for your bitch ass, you're just another sacrifice

[Hook x2]

Close your eyes
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
Close your eyes
Don't look or you'll turn to stone

Voices drive my conscience, and I fight
To keep them sane...
