[Hook: Wrekonize]
They call us strange, they call us Twiztid
But we remain among the misfits
Bringing the pain, so you can just get down with us, down with us
They call us strange, they call us twiztid
But we remain among the misfits
Bringing the pain, so you can just get down with us, down with us
Woe woe

[Verse 1: Madrox]
Temporary pain and everlasting images
Just like tattoos that cover my appendages
Practices and scrimmages
Stay sharp rehearsing lines and sentences
To kill the man in the mirror my own personal nemesis
Pen is out of ink and no paper, now that’s a casualty”
I spit dextrose my mouth is full of cavities
You minor outta your league, you besta call the cavalry
Terrestrial bodies fall Toward the center of gravity
Meaning your fall if you battle me, too tight to rattle me
Spill ya blood on the canvas and hang it in ya gallery
Full of substance so many empty like their calories
Allergic to fake bitches the doctor call my allergies and
Pencil an appointment accustomed to disappointment
We be doing our own thang and gained some new enjoyment
It's a brand new nightmare, bloody and unclear
To infinity and beyond roll like Woody and Lightyear

[Hook: Wrekonize]

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
You said I put the "I" in evil
Well let me put a needle in your eye
And call it a peek hole into your mind
And I've decided to eat ya
And I dont give a fuck if you come looking for peace
Fam to me we all beefin'
And a pair of J's with a meat cleaver
Quick to clear the block with a chalk
Call it ya street sweeper fuck a cop
He just wanted to kill a creature
Who was fuckin his daughter in a pair of some sweet sneakers
Tell me, who gives it how you want it when ya need it
When the rest of em retreated to pleated and even turned their backs
On the people who really needed I'm just stating facts
You needa watch the shit you tatt on your back
And me and Jamie we ain't a couple of hacks
Roaming the industry lookin' for fat checks
We're the dopest of what we be the wicked abstract
And we never going out like that
(hell yeah!)

[Hook: Wrekonize]
They call us strange, they call us twiztid
But we remain I'm with the misfits
Bringing the pain, so you can just get down with us, down with us
They call us strange, they call us twiztid
But we remain among the misfits
Bringing the pain, so you can just get down with us, down with us
Woe woe

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Better get yo hands together,
Grab a chainsaw, axe, whatever
It's show time but I'm much worse than
Dexter and Hannibal Lecter
Can you handle the pressure
When you channel and fester the evil professor
Leave you looking like a pez dispenser
Tied up in the road with a pentagram in the center
Evil lose like the number one contender
Say goodbye to your champ as I consume the pretender

[Bridge: Twiztid]
Brought your butcher knives, axes, and wicked shit
We got blood soaked microphones and we won't quit
They want drugs, bitches, and a skull to crush
And all of them are down with us
We got them knives who love to use
Their on each and everyone of you
You might even find a gun or two
Just know that we do it all for you

[Hook: Wrekonize]
