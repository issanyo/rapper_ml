[Intro]
This old time radio program was originally aired live
Long before the advent of high fidelity
As a result you may detect an occasional
Surface noise or volume drop
Due to transmission problems so common to old radio
We hope however that any variance in audio quality
Will not take away from your pleasure in listening to this
One of the all time favorites....

[Chorus 1x]
How does it feel to be you?
How does it feel to feel the way you do?
It's so decisive
And I don't care if you like or you hate me
I know you motherfuckers bound to underrate me

[Madrox]
Looking through the window as a thunder bolt strikes the ground
Wind blowing through the trees makin irritating sound
Like the voice in the back of my head but I'm immune
To the confines of Dracula's tomb
Nightbreed man-made Nosferat-ay
Child of the night sending shocks through your body
Fatter than Poveratti
Speak softly or back up off me
Feline before I gaze in your eyes and blow your mind
Sickness what I depicted is ordered and evicted
Frequently described as being Twiztid or wicked
Predicted many sights seen happening to lives
Perform on the daily in disguise
Sinister, tell the minister to bless my soul
Momma made me mind broken and went outta control
Smash the remote control through television screen
Blame it on the movie or a dream, it's all the same
Mind games, leavin prodigies paralyzed
Swollen little brain mesmerized
Then he dies , left alone in a world full of hate
Body rots away while his mind incubates

[Chorus 1x]

[Monoxide Child]
You label me a paranoid schizophrenic
Known on this planet for 2 things
Talkin shit and automatic
Mind gets tragic on little walks through the woods
Bury you alive if I could
Mobbin' through the hood with a body in the trunk
Unidentified because he's known as a chump
I hear him keep talking junk in my ear
But nobody else can hear
I look around and I'm feeling weird
Palms are sweaty I'm about to black out
Last chance but nothing could stop this Twiztid sprout
I'm all about mad cussing
Fuck you and the red Martian
Me and Madrox are skull crushing
Turning bitches to dust and when I recite you folks die
Like I creep in the night, I let your soul fly
So high that I never touch ground
Make it so your bodies never found
Another Unsolved Mystery
Looking for some nobody
Every single night on TV
Try to get me to see
My eyes closed and rolled back
Holdin a thought deep in my mind about a carjack
Another great found in the middle of the street
People just kept moving their feet
Treated like a freak, so how am I suppose to act?
So when you see me mother fucker be prepared for the axe

[Chorus 1x]

[Madrox]
We're going vampire huntin with a 9 millimeter
Our souls our blessed by Mary Magdalene and Saint Peter
Eat a bit of flesh but I call it the host
Am I dead, alive, or just a ghost
Comatose midrange, 2 dollars and some change
Hoping, picturing sanity but I'm feeling so insane
Got a migraine headache, my stomach hurts...
