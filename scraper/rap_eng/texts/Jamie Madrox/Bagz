[Intro]
Mad bagz of weed (mixed up)

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
If it ain't green it ain't us, your parents hate us
Because we smell like cannabis and remind 'em of the incubus
Another freek of the night
With excessable roach clips, bongs and weed pipes

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
We comin wit the straight 28, a full oz
Only fuckin wit the weed you can keep the nose bleed
Mash on you haters, actin' like you know me?
Twiztid motherfucker, what you got on my trees?

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
I smoke it down to the ash
Burning lips and finger tips
On for helly shit and take no bullet and passin' it
Right to the ashtray where it belongs
From the bag to the J to the tray to the bong

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Smoke alotta weed, cloud nine
Space flying, people try to front like I don't
But I can see inside 'em
Put the flame on the end of the weed and start the session
And I'mma smoke it all up quick without question

[Hook: Twiztid]
I hope you brought the papers
You know I brought the trees
So roll another joint
And hand that bitch to me
We do this everyday
So come get high with me
No matter what they tell us this is reality

[Verse 5: Monoxide]
Eyes blue, out red - I'm lookin' faded
Clothes stank like bud
And my finger tips is always resonated
We burnin' ganja with the windows up
I got a q.p. of good green rolled, ready to puff

[Verse 6: Jamie Madrox]
We smokin' entirely to much trees for average folks
But I never said that I was average
I like to smoke mad bags of weed
No stems, no seeds
All I really want and all I really need

[Verse 7: Monoxide]
I gotta tell you bitches
It ain't no smokin' for free
If you ain't fuckin' with me
Don't put your lips up on my muthafuckin' tree
Wrap your surroundings, like a zig zag
Light your whole block with a flame and take a big drag

[Verse 8: Jamie Madrox]
We blaze trees on the highways, in the driveways
In the casket I keep an axe and a fat sack with the zig zags
For the 2 blunt trademark trees
Every studio session we gettin' sparked

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Jamie Madrox]
We smoke weed everyday
Regardless what you say
And every single night with the get right
You need to get up and shut up with all that pride
And all you non smokin' niggas get the fuck outside

[Verse 10: Monoxide]
Only weed smokers up in this bitch tonight
Thick clouds of weed smoke, green like Kryptonite
I don't drink, shoot-up, or take X
Only three loves in life is bud, death, and sex

[Verse 11: Jamie Madrox]
Gimme gimme green leafs laced up with hashish
When your ridin' dirty, watch for police
Listen and learn cuz I would never steer you wrong
Knowledge is accumulated like resins in bongs

[Hook x2]
