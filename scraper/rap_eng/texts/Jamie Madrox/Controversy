[Intro]
They got this plan to hurt me
Spoon feed me controversy
They fill my head with thoughts
Until they hear us beg for mercy
Because they want me to die
Believe in all their lies
But I see it in their eyes
They're just as evil as this planet

[Monoxide]
Sip blood spit with the wicked
Never in the mood to kick it, I'm an asshole
I've been prescripted and prescribed
And probably until I die enough pills to keep me high on
I'm looking for Zion, lost in space
And that's the only place I really feel safe
The government's chasing me to go and fight some war
And I can't front, I don't have a clue what they fighting for
Lies galore from Lincoln to Al Gore
Now we hide under a Bush and I can't take it anymore
I want to try to find a way to understand
Besides the good weed, what the fuck's in Afghanistan?
Can't trust 'em chuck said it best
And Imma take it till I finally rest
Now I got an X on my head
Like I'm supposed to fear
I'm just a target but bitch I'm still here

[Hook]

Discover the secrets behind the magical realm
Look in the sky clouds are stitches of time
The visual evolution of the after glow
You have to know
There's more to a hero than a thunder bolt
Will it strike in the same place, same time
Blowing off appendages like land mines
Behind the disguise lies identity with vital stats
Borderline maniacs and aristocrats
Prognosticators, foretelling the outcome
Environmental movement up rise the sun
Cataclysmic anomaly will mutate the family
With radiation sickness recorded on photography
Time life magazine interview with Nostradamus
Written in quatrains the dark days are upon us
Being honest had a feeling that it would come to pass
Then in '79 the ozone started to crack, and we're still here

[Hook]

[Jamie Madrox]
And with the atmosphere pressure see the insects swarming
90 degrees in winter time, global warming
The asteroids keep falling from outer space
Is it alien life forms trying to communicate?
Better rope off the area and quarantine the flock
Vaccinate for chemical scars and chicken pox
Everyone is infected as the panic sets in
And the president's on every channel answering questions

[Monoxide]
Anticipated like a UFO
And everybody's standing hillside waiting to go
And for all that we know we could've just been sold
By the government to aliens for god only knows
I can't help it that I'm feeling like this
If I an think it, it can happen
And I can think of some crazy shit
I try to keep in control
I'm going outta my skull
All I can do is sit and watch it unfold

[Hook x2]
