With the heart and grace of Florida Evans
As a family we will rise the fuck up and ride on all
You bitch ass tricks
You motherfucker ain't safe
You motherfucker ain't safe
You motherfucker ain't safe (not at all)
Because we grind in '06 and infinity

[verse 1:]
Bitch you ain't gotta like my shit
My shit is so real sometimes that its downright ridiculous
Fictional sometimes when telling the tale
What can I say? Drama sells
You don't like it? Go to hell - Ummm
I try to tell them but they just don't listen
Ya see, they be knowin' the words
It's the message they missin'
But its cool
You can go and bump it till you get your fill
And I'mma keep on working up on this spiel

Bitch I represent the underground like a sewer grate motherfucker
And with my motherfuckin' fam on my side..you can't see me!

You motherfuckers ain't safe
You motherfuckers ain't safe (not at all)
You motherfuckers ain't safe
You motherfuckers ain't safe (not at all)

[verse 2:]
You can jack this beat and you can jack these rhymes
And you can jack this dick 3 or 4 good times
But its cool
You don't really want no beef
And all them nights tossing and turning
And losing all that sleep
If I like your shit
Then I'm jockin' too much
And if I hate your shit
I'm cockblockin' and such
I'm just being me and you should just be being you
And not worried about what the fuck I'm about to do

You motherfuckers ain't safe
You motherfuckers ain't safe (not at all)
You motherfuckers ain't safe
You motherfuckers ain't safe (not at all)

I pledge my allegiance to the motherfucking fam
From the first day to the motherfucking end
And all you mainstream bitches better cover your dome
Because I'm comin'

[verse 3:]
The fuck u think I'm stupid?
I'm serious, ho
I'm innovative walking the footsteps of my big bro
And don't let nobody shake me
From what I wanna bring
Call it having heart in the product your distributin'
They say we polluting the eardrums of some
I say fuck em, we got a job
Best believe we gonna get it done
Weak bitches this is not for you
Turn it down, turn it off
Copycats you too!

If you down with the underground
Lemme see your hands up
(tell them other motherfuckers
Shut the fuck up) lemme see your hands up
If you down with the underground
Lemme see your hands up
(tell them other motherfuckers
Shut the fuck up) lemme see your hands up
If you down with the underground
Lemme see your hands up
(tell them other motherfuckers
Shut the fuck up) lemme see your hands up
If you down with the underground
Lemme see your hands up
(tell them other motherfuckers
Shut the fuck up) lemme see your hands up

If you're down
