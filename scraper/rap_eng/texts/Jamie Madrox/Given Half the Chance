[Hook: Twiztid]
Given half the chance
To do it all again
From start to the finish
And change how it ends
Question: what would you do, huh?
What would you do?
If given half the chance
To change whatever you wanted to?

[Verse 1: Blaze]
What if I never died?
What if I survived?
To see the age of 25
No more creepin' in the dark sleepin' under trees
Park bench with a blanket with some leaves, please
People scream at the sight of a man that'll melt sunlight
Aight! Now if I was given a chance to change it all
I would at least gave my homies a call, I miss y'all

[Verse 2: Violent J]
If I could change anything, it would be the mirror
When I look into a mirror, I don't see me there
I can't fix my hair or check my clothes
I can't even see it if there's a booger hangin' out my nose
I'm a hologram, but check it, I'ma feed em' back
On my bathroom floor, stuck deep within a tile crack
What am I? Who am I? Where?
If I could change anything, I would be here

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
If I ever had the chance, I know I'd be a ghost
I'd be that monster in the dark and scare the shit outta folks
I'd be that bumpin' in the night zone
I'd be that reason every time you go to sleep
You need some mothafuckin' lights on
I'd be that ruler of the spirit land
Conjuring demons and gargoyles, hidin' all your contraband
You can have em' come and bless the house
But if I get the chance, then ain't nobody gettin' out

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
Don't nobody care that I'm trapped in a pine box
Smooth with the buttoned up shirt and the dress socks
It's getting harder to breathe, hello, I'm dying
The air is getting thinner, I'm past the point of cryin'
Okay, the joke is over, I'm rollin' over on my back
To free myself from the casket
Given half the chance to live again and be alive
I could reside in heaven or hell and never have to die

[Hook x2]

[Bridge: Violent J]
If I could change anything, I'd clip the devil's wings
So everybody in the world could hear it when the angel sings
Queens and Kings bring things for children
Everybody's warm, nobody's soul's frozen
Nobody's chosen for heaven or hell
Everybody moves well, it's no souls for sell
There is no evil, there is no sorrow
If I could change anything, this would be tomorrow

[Verse 5: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Gimme just one chance, just one
Guaranteed 5 seconds and the job's done
Noah bank helly from out the Lotus Pod
With your vampire hands in my pocket's on my bank card
Bitch, now how the fuck you gon' try and tell me no
Can't see my babies today, that's why you gotta go
Babies mama, shit, why I call you that
Ain't n'thin' to me, been self-attained a hood rat

[Hook x3]
