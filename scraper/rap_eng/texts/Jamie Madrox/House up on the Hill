[Hook]
House up on the hill

[Verse 1: R.O.C]
Running, bury me six feet deep and skip the autopsy
Killed the paretic pathologist cause he tried to stop me
Tried to examine my brain, all in my head
The projectile, a 32 caliber revolver lead
Me to my death
They said I was a good boy but jealous of
Cause wanted me dead cause I'm ruling this
But now I roam the streets, trying to piece the scary puzzle
I hear the Rottweiler's bark and I need a muzzle
I got to stop these bad men that ruined my life
Now I'm in my afterlife, on a mission to kill

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hektic]
Back on the streets until nightfall
Somebody keeps calling my name
Am I insane in this dead man's game?
Thought you could fade? My blade will crash your skin
Leave you for dead in an alley and since my final sin
I doubted, screamed and shouted, one more on my list
This first time was your time, your ass is mine bitch
I look for guidance but nobody will lend a hand
Stopped in the name of the law as I take my stand
We bought your corner with your boys, I hear you gloat
Your time is up as I laugh and slice your throat

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr. Bones]
Once again, I'm bringing you down, I'm taking you down
They put me down into the ground
So hear the sound and brother don't turn [?]
I bring the dead back to life with the touch of my hand
I walk alongst the way cause I'm a product of the wasteland
They breathe the breath of life into this rotten corpse of mine
Giving me the chance to take revenge up in a dark side
I roam the night like a predator looking for my prey
Caught the suckas that condemned me to my dirty grave
Strung they ass up from the tree in front of my house
Stick they ass with my blade as they scream and shout
