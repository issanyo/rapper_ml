[Verse 1: The R.O.C.]
If the people never wanna see me again
Will never disappear quickly
Maybe I never existed
Intentional resist me will truly vent me
Going closer to God I'm the outcast
I'm the Lord's angel spacial distortion within humanity
Mission aborting contorting my angle
Its most high no lie
Think about the ones lost oh why I cry scream
Let the deep dark sky shell I try
Hell yea get up off my ass
Second to life its all love to my people to the death
Praying that we meet again holding on yeah
The human existence is nothing more than a fantasy
Headed towards destruction since day 1, what an ugly atrophy
Kill or be killed extinction is prevalent skip the analogies
Nowhere to run but into ourselves so true to life tragedy

[Hook: Britney Stoney & The R.O.C.]
I know a life itself can be confusing
You don't belong always lost so throw all your wrongs
You'll never find me out
I've paid my price and I still owe my life
Many moons taking flight through your darkest of nights
And your sickness I fight and my zone is twilight
Never break me or lies
I'm disgusted and why

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Please take another look at the record label
I can fable it don't even sound real
Turn the table now I feel like I'm able to do something the underground feels
And the crowds still get alive when I'm out here repping east side
Can't see why people wanna put a bullet through the middle of a fucking peace sign
We feeling like a food line disgusted
And I can say I'm too tired but fuck it
Of me don't wanna let you be too high
While you listen to the boo high
Listen you could see it through my two eyes
I ain't fucking with you fruit flies
Flew the cooper got a new high
Time to prove it to the brew hive

[Verse 3: Madrox]
My dreams are like the catalyst to my soul and body
Battle for bliss I'm feeling far from fabulous
But I been adamant about attacking it so call it passionate
While I channel my inner magic I'm leaving the planet
Damaging everything that we touch
Savage we ravage and what the fuck I'm with the victory
Ain't no time for bubble guts
They say we need a hero
Someone to believe in
Shame it's not insane
Another pain and he the bitter exceed the powers so great
That it translate into the world when i'm speakin
Now that's another feeling when you believing the things that you believe in
You feel it in your heart and you don't need a reason
Your disgusted tear the world apart and leave em bleak

[Hook: Britney Stoney & The R.O.C.]

[Verse 4: The R.O.C.]
Humanity's on the run break lines
Change will never come incline
Piss on all the old hate crimes
Bite the world with my canines
Spit my verbiage till they take mines
Do it to death to reason them flint line
Never defined the so much spine
Cross my heart can never resign
No parlay not today
Gotta keep fighting
No delay
The fuck can your hate do to me
Im disgusted but im free
Never stoppin till i see the sight
The darkest night
So have them run see their errors
Judgement comes in many forms to form
Too late to waltz along
You be the planet's pallbearers
