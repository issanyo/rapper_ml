[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Can't get a job anymore cuz I'm a gangbanging Juggalo
According to the cop's report
Just wanted in and out of this store
Had to return couple of things
I've purchased from there before
Clerk giving me hard time like I committed a crime
Onto the line
Hand 'em the proof of the purchase
But the kid won't tell and the manager laughs
And I'm a thief and I stole it
Receipt and I showed it
Went down to a deeper emotion
To keep me from going up out of my mind
So I decided to leave 'em behind
But when I try, police have arrived
I'm leaving outside like "wonderful guy"
Put in a rack and I'm riding
I'm thinkin' that "this is the way that I'm treated"
I cannot believe it, I'm humble but weakened
Sitting inside a precinct
Finally, I can see them, talking and kinda kickin'
Speaking about my tattoos, classified as a cashew-I'm nutty
Cuz a I'm a Juggalo, gang member and bloody
The main center arrived
"Brought you here to let you know: it's nothing more than a factor, you being a Juggalo"

[Hook: Twiztid]
Life has a weight trying to wear me down
And it gets worse every time I turn around
(They keep me treating like nothing
I feel like I'm drowning and I'm barely surviving)
I don't like the way the world looks right now
Wanna leave it all behind but I don't know how
([?] and down
And I'm just hoping that one day I can figure it out)

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Fuck their opinions and oversights of our living
I'm hoping amongst the hatred we find some sense of forgiving
I’m hoping that just by taking the first steps of living, we’re reshaping what was deformed at birth, a new beginning, so singing the song of us sinners
So many Y'all know the words
When they tryna to be overly righteous, that's feeling absurd
Man I'm so tired of all this fighting, shit is wearing me down
To the point, I no longer care for "hi"/"hey" out of their mouth
I'm depressed on the verge of giving up, but I know no cred
I'm just blowing up something lost in the moment and talking shit
I wanna leave it all behind but in my mind all I find
That I'm alive, and that that means I'm more insane over time
Serpent sign, but I'm outta time as they keep passing me by
Say they don't want my head and my hands emotionally tired
If they die another day put my hands together and pray
There he don't give me nothing I can't handle, please take it away
Give me strength for goodness' sake to
Take the lack of tears and swallowin' fears
And the power to move minds put me on the level ahead

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Heavenly Father, I'm down on my knees
Thinking "why even bother?"
Can't change what they think, stalking above them
I'm alone as I can be and I feel like a hostage
To everything you believe

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
Anger always seems to get me down
I just can't take it any longer
Life keeps on pausing and insanity's calling
And reality falling away from me
Can somebody help me?
Say a prayer, whoever cares, and kill me

You got the weight of the World on your shoulders
And you ready to ride or die
Don't let anybody convince you how you live it or how you're living your life
