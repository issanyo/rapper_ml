Gather we will each in search of a thrill
A reason for feeling the needing to kill
To stop what's happening, to silence the screams
To not be afraid to sleep and dream
To feel in control and to take it all back
To fall into into pieces as the sky turns to black
Hope you got what you wanted, this wonderful wish
To kill everyday until nothing exists
In the world but you, you're the last one alive
But with no conflict to confront, will there be a reason to survive?
Will the anger just die or will you kill that as well?
As you sit all alone in your personal hell

WELCOME TO THE WICKED

To Wish I Could Kill Everyday
