[Hook: Madrox]
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Jack-o'-lanterns, pumpkin pales, yelling trick or treat
Trick or treat, trick or treat, trick or treat
Million monsters and costumes coming to fill the streets
If we don’t get what we want
We killing everybody and we're killing everybody on the spot
If we don't get what we want
We gon’ start stabbing everybody and we ain't gon' stop

[Verse 1: Madrox]
And we ain't gon' quit uh, tell 'em who the shit uh
When November 1st come, full candy bars never bubblegum
Neighbors say we troublesome but they never talk much
Without their tongue, mumble some, listen son
Anyone say they got a problem with it
I'ma use a double-headed ax and take your head and split it
Say they wanna come and get it
I'ma pop you open like a picked over pumpkin
Left in the patch, bleeding, I’ma laugh at your ass

[Bridge: Madrox]
We been looking for that good shit
Nothing but the good shit
Don’t be coming with that off-brand shit
With the name brand shit stupid off-brand hoe
Off-brand hoe, off off-brand hoe
We been looking for that good shit
Nothing but the good shit
Don't be coming with that off-brand shit
With the name brand shit stupid off-brand hoe
Off-brand hoe, off off-brand hoe

[Hook: Madrox]
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Jack-o’-lanterns, pumpkin pales, yelling trick or treat
Trick or treat, trick or treat, trick or treat
Million monsters and costumes coming to fill the streets
If we don't get what we want
We killing everybody and we're killing everybody on the spot
If we don't get what we want
We gon’ start stabbing everybody and we ain't gon' stop

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Look at me, look at me, look at me
Carving in blood again for Halloween
Shouldn't we, should we, should we
Celebrate with a murder spree
How about soliloquy's from the pits of me
Shouted out like it's killing me
Why the coldass blunt was so whiskily
Here to make your arm hair stand up all prickly
Bring out the Ouija board live in the mystery
The shadows calling, are you listening?
On Hallow's Eve for the victory
Grab a butcher knife, plunge it into me
I'm feeling woozy like the kid from Scream
Still bring the nightmares to your Elm Streets
You see them right there, that's my killer team
Another Halloween, we get to killing things

[Bridge: Madrox]
We been looking for that good shit
Nothing but the good shit
Don't be coming with that off-brand shit
With the name brand shit stupid off-brand hoe
Off-brand hoe, off off-brand hoe
We been looking for that good shit
Nothing but the good shit
Don't be coming with that off-brand shit
With the name brand shit stupid off-brand hoe
Off-brand hoe, off off-brand hoe
