[Intro]
From out of the East, timeless beast, still ill
Hey, don't fall into hate
It can get the best of the better man at any time
[??]
(Tell me what you believe in)
Never forget it
Then turn the other cheek, there're a lot of cheeks to turn
At that point you have no choice but to make them both learn a lesson
Never forget [??]
And their hate get the best of them
They were all dead, boaked to the end

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I don't even feel like I'm loved until I'm hated
Makin' a situation more complicated
How'd you make it
Payin' to break the playlist
Label payin' in stages now its back to minimum wages
It ain't outrageous cause its probably the truth
And now you're nameless
(Skill and a mill and a half on recruit)
Find ya brainless 
And now your sound skin starts to shoot
And you're famous
Layin' in your funeral suit

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Man if it's one thing I hate, it's all the ignorance
Changing the basis of the worldwide premise
And like some chemists we perfected an antidote
To smother the anti hope and pressure on your cantalope
Somewhere 'tween the music notes our souls will never die
And its like we're resurrected evertime you're gettin' high
Got your favorite shit bumpin' loud enough for all to hear
Catchin' mean mugs, realize that one thing's clear and that's

[Hook x2]
I know that you all hate me
(That's how they got me feelin')
You can't release or despise the prodigy
(Tell me what you believe in)
Hide behind your facade but I see
(I've had it up to the ceiling)
You're wastin' your time hatin' me just like me
(Tell me what you believe in)

[Verse 3:Jamie Madrox]
It's interesting, everybody's against us
Chicken heads tempt us, cops want to arrest us
Enemies wanna knock the hustle and lay us down
Smilin' in our face when we come around
More hate than love, we push and shove
Like mosh pits through the world
Just tryin' to get a piece of it
Before we're forced to leave it
Converted to go
And destined to stay afloat in the twilight zone
Supernatural, becomin' what we became
Visionaries capable of seein' outside of the frame
Strange enough to acquire shitty looks
Equal to that of a criminal or crook
So go and look but don't stare
That shit is bad for your health
Like dissin' somebody to feel better about yourself
When you pull it all down it's still hard to see 
Cause you're dissin' the muthafucka that you're tryin' to be 

[Bridge]
That's how they got me feelin'
Tell me what you believe in
I've had it up to the ceiling
Tell me what you believe in

(I know that you all hate me)
That's how they got me feelin'
Tell me what you believe in
(Hide behind your facade but I see) I've had it up to the ceiling
Tell me what you believe in

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
All I know is everytime I go to look up
There's somebody standin' out on the stage wearin' my hook up
And they think it's cool cause all they been listenin' to is you
But see really you're just a rip off of somebody in the crew
You ain't the greatest, just the latest in long lines 
Of people who'd been rippin' me off now for a long time 
You're chalk lines in the crack default line 
A couple short nickles fuckin' around with a long dime
Rewind mine a couple of times 
And analyze me word for every word and decide I'm 
Just like you, from the top to the bottom 
And then decide that we'll both rot in the field of forgotten 

[Hook x2]
