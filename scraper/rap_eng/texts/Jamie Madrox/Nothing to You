[Intro: Monoxide]
Tell me we're not the same x3

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Chemicals in your brain
Power trip when you fall insane
You're trying to be something you're not
Instead of being the thing
You got looking at you in the mirror now

(Tell me we're not the same x2)

[Hook: Monoxide]
I'm falling into pieces and breaking like mirror
The world's got me coming unglued
And making a noose again
Your life is an ocean, don't drown if you can
I'm sure that means nothing to you, nothing to you

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
You said you're feeling ashamed
Tell me 'bout it everyone feels the same
Difference is this time around we're not backing down
We got nothing else left to (lose!)

(Tell me we're not the same x2)

And all my life I feel like I've died

[Hook: Monoxide]
I'm falling into pieces and breaking like mirror
The world's got me coming unglued
And making a noose again
Your life is an ocean, don't drown if you can
I'm sure that means nothing to you, nothing to you

[Instrumental Hook]

[Hook: Monoxide x2]
I'm falling into pieces and breaking like mirror
The world's got me coming unglued
And making a noose again
Your life is an ocean, don't drown if you can
I'm sure that means nothing to you, nothing to you

(Tell me we're not the same x2)
