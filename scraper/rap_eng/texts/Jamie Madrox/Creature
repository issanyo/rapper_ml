This ain't beastmode boy I’m a creature
You can hear the animal that is coming thru the speakers
Track with the wild out break bone features
Trunk slam earthquake trunk shake seizure (x2)

This ain't beastmode boy I’m a creature (creature)
Boy I’m a creature (x4)

(Liquid Assassin)
I said ride any track the moment they let the beat go
Hit you with something that’ll rock ya frame
I feel like an animal surrounded by a freakshow
Ready to jump when im out the cage
If they can find shoot em down like a free throw
But let me tell ya this is not a game
You probably say this here sound a lot like beastmode
But let me tell ya this is not the same

It’s the liquid assassin I bring the vision and snappin everybody knows im original and still get it crackin
Quick to give u a visual if the feeling is absent it won't be a subliminal when I deliver the packages
Ya said You won't get the message the minute the steps leak cuz every track hit like the speakers getting they ass kicked
I mash shit, turn it down land to a casket, kill the fucking game till its giving me access

Im an extreme with 16s and split spleens over a hot 12 the hook fiends like nicotine its in our nigga genes
The rhythm bleed I spit E (still ill) still the real gorilla killing machine
Show no love ya must be outta ya mind if you think you got what it takes to put this mother fucking creature to sleep

That’s right you? catching bullets? With ya teeth? Nigga Please!

I am beast released creature
Least to retreat ya
Ain't a bone in my body that’s weak I bleed ether
Lone with nobody but me and a heat fever
Say you got a problem and beef with meat clever
Everybody spit up on the mic I throw up
Niggas say they hardest in the streets, well so what?
Im the hardest on the mother fucking mic I go nuts
Tear the stage down every night that I show up

And for ya fake and cokey eaters, you haters are non believers
They tried to knock bottle liquid up like a aquafina
Constant feed from cock blockin me rock ya speakers
Ima rock the beat till its hittin kickin like soccer FIFA
When I fight feelin the fire ignite lyrics
Might lyricist word types and light spirits
Vice gearance, squeeze light till I site weakness
Fight fearless strike light for my life means this
Ya I be the definition of beast and mode
Tear the club down till the speakers blown
Get up on stage and release the flow
To make mother fuckers bounce till they knees explode
I cripple, come to my show and I earn with you
Killing everything with a urn to burn venues
Mother fucking animal unleash the gold
Hear to show em how to really go creature mode

(Hook)

(Madrox)
Sick as ever was sick, venom up in my spit, let me breathe a little bit
And focus so I can hear my talking, like ya retarded, a creature im cold blooded
And cold hearted, our features coming alive in the casket
Living dead with jumper cables for the departed
Upset in my head, im an animal gritty all I can get stay hungry
My teeth stay bloody, scum of the earth, and im ugly like I stop really damning out what im worth
I got whole bunch of 0’s we heros, the underdogs in the ground, to the coy you can hear it up in our songs
You can ride with it get rolled on and sing along stay infected and doing this till the day the worlds gone
We ain't stopping for nothing mother fucker so be aware
If you a creature betta put ya middle finger in the air
And if ya ain't ya better lay down act like ya scared
Cuz liquid and twiztid pissed in this bitch and we don’t care

(Monoxide)
Now it really don’t matter what anybody is bringing from the stable
Im a creature and im willing and able
Kill em all with a shotty that I got duct tapped to the bottom of a table
Han solo with ya neck wrapped up in 4ft of mic cable
While you coming with debatable flavor
Cuz im bringing the craze slow to ya front row
Put ya life in jeopardy then im calling it a game show
Yall don’t wanna start this
In the darkness
Im the most heartless regardless
Like a precinct everybody walk and count this
And just like these fam we ain't even drop shit
Like coke im prone to rock shit
And im so gone alone im in the middle of mosh pit
Getting it on
And I don’t a fuck if you into my twilight zone

(Hook)

(Rittz)
I’m a creature
"Fuck Swag" up on my t-shirt
Back in school I never listened to my teacher
Cheap herb
Reeking of some reefer
Skip PE just to finga some prick beneath the bleacher
Cut the pussy like im Michael myers with a clever
Skeet skeet squirt I don’t wanna see you tweak twork
Booty twork pop ya booty down to where your feet were
Let me stop playing bloody murder when i beat hurt
Im boppin on the street word of mouth is that im ether
Turn a hater into a believer
Now eat your words its absurd kick a people read a knee work
A rebirth and I don’t need to revert or be heard
A leet upper eschalon
Skill is still the reason that im signed fresh design mother fucking fuck these leprochan
I don’t need no mahov wheno when I hear ya shit again
Bout to fuck a sexy blonde bitch she got a lesbian
When will a bantam in a gain and you a bitch
And then maybe you begin so there wouldn’t ever been
Better doin something else instead of rappin
Carrying a vin that I hating on adens that  a win
Ever you want a track it you offers you bitches made
Killing em like billy bob in Dwight government sling blade
Its Rittz and liquid assassin you messed with the pin game
A creature on the beat and im untamed we won't do a deal
