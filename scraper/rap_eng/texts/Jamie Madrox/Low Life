[Intro]
Klick-Klack!

[Verse 1: Young Wicked]
Shoot a motherfucker in the face (yuh)
Everybody tough until they break (yuh)
Mentally I'm living in a cage (yuh)
I ain't really looking to escape (nah)
Happy when I'm crazy, can't nobody save me
Bet I'm getting pussy that's why all your homies hate me
Bet I'm getting money selling records out the basement
Fuck you lil pussy bet you never gonna say shit (bet)
I ain't have to take an L yet (bet)
Getting jiggy with it, Will Smith (bet)
Cause your woman want a real dick (bet)
Fucking you and shit, you don't feel shit (nyet)
Ain't nothing I just had to say something stay fronting
One day you gon end up in a grave from a
Roll another one and a cookie and bake something
Somebody turn the base up and I ain't gotta change nothing
Bitch I have been dope, sharp like Ginsu
Mean motherfucker and all my kin folk
Hoes I pimp those, flow I kick those
Sick I spit so suck my dick hoe
Shining underneath the stage lights (aight)
And my bitches pussy stay tight (aight)
MNE the Family and I (right)
Bet I be a magic samurai (hi-yah!)

[Hook]
You can call me a lowlife
Ima still go get paid (Ima get paid)
Gunsmoke in a cold night
You ain't tryna run no fade (you ain't want no smoke)
Lunatic in my soul right
Don't you ever come my way (westside, eastside)
Or I have to dig another hole like
This is where your body gon stay (fuck it)

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Now you call me a lowlife
But your perception of me really isn't important to what I am
I been a lunatic understand gotta a lot of responsibilities
Kill em all I think again
I been really thinking if I did away with everybody
All up and away I can run yay like a marathon
Lemme carry on like a free bird from the C word
On the D head call me out by my name again
And I put em in the back like light over a cast
But you won't last in the bad side die fast
I'm a Killa with an attitude and an axe that'll splatter you
Tell me who to bring the battle to

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Pull up, pull up, all I ever say it pull up
And if you pull up, the motherfuckers wanna spill a
Blood full of wise and why not you got team and block cause they said that you said and I watch
You can ask and my moms and my pops
I didn't even think you'd care
What I thought when you said to bring it in a brawl (yeah)
50 people sitting on your loft (yeah)
Should've just left us alone (yeah)
Now you bitches can't leave it off (yeah)
I don't think you really understand
The kinda people that you're bringing out the evil in
Maybe you'll believe it when a demon standing on your ceiling swinging like a ceiling fan
You ain't feeling what I'm feeling fam
Believe me you couldn't handle what I'm dealing with
So quit thugging on the internet
'Fore I put an end to your crooked in a cigarette

Don't you know all I do is level up (up, up)
I'm gonna see my light shine bright tho, Miko
Take a fucking blade and make a cut (cut, cut)
And I'm gonna get payback (Batman)
If you woke up today and you still got your face
Mean you didn't catch a motherfucking fade no way
Cut some shit you just did just lie
Don't got no motherfucking alibi
So when the fucking fire

Backhand motherfuckers getting slapped
Got a bitch chilling up in my lap
