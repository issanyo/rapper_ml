[Verse:1 Monoxide]
Fuck you and your platinum chains
I'd rather rip out your intestines and wear it on my neck just the same
Makin' a charm outta your brain and havin' the gall to give it away
To your moms and pops in the box marked 'Remains'
Blood stains these veins in a way that I can only explain as insane
The world's gonna celebrate when I hang
And I just hope that it's on TV like Saddam Hussein
And I just hope that you could be me for just one day
Then you would get a better sense of what the fuck I say
I said: Bitches ain't shit, God bless the dead
And fuck every last bitch that won't give up some head
I smoke 15 packs in a day and I'm getting worried now
Cause every time I cough my hearing is getting blown
I ain't a hater, player; just ain't no suckas allowed
And you and that bitch that was dancing are just way out of bounds

[Hook]
It came with the dark, where most were fast asleep
Creeping, looking for blood down in the neighborhood streets
If you get caught in the gaze of his evil eyes
You will know true horror, as your body slowly dies

[Verse 2: Madrox]
Yo, black magic, devil horns
Wake the dead when we perform
We'll weigh more bodies and dead by dawn
Ill child, Black Label Society
We Zack Wylde on you bitches so live in fear of the enemy
My conscious told me "Let it be"
But fingers had a remedy
To kill 'em all and split up they atoms just like it's chemistry
Extract skin from your face like a plastic surgeon
And leave you twitching in pain, screaming behind the curtain
I'm for certain, with a look like bloody face uncle Frank
Most of these home grown killas claiming that they dank
When they shit ready to sink, water log like marsh lagoons
While we're mid transformation, alive inside the cocoons
Nursing them wounds of many battles, turn cities to tombs
Growing close to the end, so what the fuck we got to lose?
Straight killas with enough ammunition to take the planet to war
Most of these villains don't even know what they're dying for

(I can't stop it)

[Verse 3: Madrox]
Sight of the blood makes me wicked
Takes me to another place
Falling in love, can't be controlled
But I know that it's bound to change
All of my life and all of the times
The chemicals are a friend to me
Can't be controlled, in search of result
The monster's got the best of me
And I will choke and stab and separate the feelings from me
(Until they're all gone, like none of them ever belonged)
As I continue to change in search of the things I really want to be
(Although the journey's long, I keep repeating this song)

[Outro]
It's not a fear, the monster is alive and in me
But I pray, I pray to the lord every night I go to sleep
It's not a fear, but if I should die before I awake
But I pray, I pray to the lord my soul be afraid
