Hey phatty phat phat
Phatty phat phat
What you got for us
Hey phatty phat phat
Phatty phat phat
What you got for us

I'm sick eating Jell-O mix straight up out the packet
While wearin a brown leather Indiana Jones jacket
I'm not the run of the mill or flash in the pan
Keyed up like Jim Hellwig with tight wristbands
I'm like a mix of Zartan, Batman and Hobgoblin
The Multiple Man metamorphosisin and transformin
Abuse a mic like a junkie would do a drug
As I smack my head against the wall and catch me a buzz
No sound sounds like this does here
And if you're quiet you can hear the music crawlin in my ears
I'll split your melon with a mallet like I'm Gallagher's brother
And if it wasn't for talent we'd be some broke mother fuckers
I'm a cannibal I'm salted and twisted while eatin pretzels
Screaming eat beef stabbin you with dinner utensils
I'm under pressure like a paper weight
Sick minds are curved so we have a hard time getting things straight

Hey phatty phat phat (oh)
Phatty phat phat (what)
What you got for us (I'm phat they call me phatso)
Hey phatty phat phat (oh)
Phatty phat phat (what?)
What you got for us (straight up asshole)

Yo I'm a giant like a said and hold my subliminal visuals
In the shape of and individual pissed off
And lookin to lift off the rocket launch and blast off
Into outer space where the stars be at
I'm phat they call me phatso straight up asshole
Save my Big Mac boxes could build my mack ass a castle
A sick son of a bitch and dirty bastard
My product is toxic so they label it bio hazard
Hasn't it been a while since you wanted to crank the dial to ten plus
And bust the speakers and rip the cones
Blown like the minds of those
Who been exposed to the frigid and frosty flows
Fillin a hole in the soul feelin out of control
Enough to wanna wrap your ride around a phone pole
I'm loco and grande like a luchador
Pullin aerial maneuvers at three hundred pounds or more
