[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
I wanna be Batman
'Cause everybody really ain't shit to me
My super hero picture me if I was Batman
Studios and shows
Utility belt with a compartment for the free rolls
Smokin' mad bud off in the Batcave
Jamie Madrox [?]
Gothom really don't look shit like Detroit
But I think these motherfuckers get the point
Listen, word on the street about the Arkham break
Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, Cat Woman, Two Face
All try to kill me before the nightfall
But I got a bad surprise for each one of y'all
Scarecrow try it with me when I'm up in Lakeside
Blast the Bat-a-rang, watch the bitch nigga hide

[Interlude]
Hold up
I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about
You ain't Batman, fuck you, I'm Batman

I don't know who he was
I met this motherfucker in the flea market
He was sellin' 8-10 glossies with his autograph on
I got the gloves, I got the belt, I got the boots
What? Lemme walk in the closet for a sec
Help! Help! I got a bat dick
Help! Help!
You wanna see my dick bitch?
Ahaha....
