"Keys To My Mind"
Their tellin me it's my fault my grass isn't green enough
And when they hit the store it's not my cd that they pickin up
Maybe I'm too wicked for em Maybe they don't like me
Maybe they beneath me like the soles on my Nikes

Maybe they wanna do it all just to spite me
It might be, the reason that they're hating me nightly
Flight we, take off to an alternate light beam
So I seem, so hidden and outta eye beam

Maybe I'm above em like a leer jet soarin
Cuttin through clouds like a butterknife, better life
But it's not best, feel it in my chest
Like my heart poundin loud enough to split my fuckin flesh

Maybe it's the way that I been keepin it (underground)
People ain't really feelin it, and hope for that (Puffy sound)
Now all I can reveal is it is what it is
We keep it horrorcore always, but it comes with a twist

And I'm alive all like a bible, I blaze in this bitch
And I can burn a piece of paper like I write for the bitch
You could be the first and the last it's whatever it is
And it really wouldn't matter because I'm killin the shit

Tell me is it better
Tell me everythang he met her
Ain't the start of the situation gettin all ugged up
I don't give a fuck what anybody trippin'
Got a map in my pocket and I'm steady on a mission
Got my back on the carpet and I'm starin at the ceilin
Thinkin how can I explode and no one would catch feelins
But some wishes will never come true
But for the moment I'ma grab a hold of those that really do

My mission is to flip it and make a person think
While you're steady missin a beat, kinda like I blink
Even up in the streets, if I have to I got heat
In the trunk or on lined sheets, guns are fuckin rhyme schemes
Try me so I can make an example and put a hole in you
Either with a knife or a pencil
They use me like a stencil of greatness
But their fakeness prevails and it drown in the abyss

I'm gone and hot headed when rage gets the best of me
I'm falling to pieces so you can blame it on the rest of me
My heart and soul especially
They got the keys to my mind as we ride over drive into destiny

I'm gone and hot headed when rage gets the best of me
I'm falling to pieces so you can blame it on the rest of me
My heart and soul especially
They got the keys to my mind as we ride over drive into destiny
