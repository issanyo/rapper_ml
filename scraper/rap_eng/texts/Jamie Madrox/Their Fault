Madrox

They say when you live a life that's full
It's the one thing you'll see me do
You never have time for no worries no issues
Going on around you
Conserve you attention Conserve your aggression
You gotta want to fight gotta want to fight
And be ready not everyone loves you
I know it cuts you what am I to do
Hey hey hey hey
Look at us now we been outta control ready to crash
Do I look like got enough room to pray I'm not killin em
But I'm not okay and it all goes black

Chorus
It's all their fault they never listen to me
Never gave me a chance to be who I want to be
Wanna kill the radio murder everything on tv
Lockout the world until it understands me

Young Wicked

They don't understand me some say I could
Live a life that's good and for once I wish I could
I never have time for peace I'm living proof it cuts like ginsu
Conserve my aggression save the ammo and the weapon
It's all what a fight the dark of the night
You can't make everybody love you
Don't let it crush you tell them devils fuck you
Hey show me the way
Take over the day take over the game
They know where my bang ain't no way they taint it
How can I really explain it
Anger they never listen They just hate
That's why I gotta scream it in they face
And it all goes black

Chorus
It's all their fault they never listen to me
Never gave me a chance to be who I want to be
Wanna kill the radio murder everything on tv
Lockout the world  until it understands me
