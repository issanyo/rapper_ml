When I get to hell!

[Jamie Madrox]
I'm sure that I'll know everybody
From the likes of David Berkowitz to Allister Crowley
Couple bible thumpers here and there, praise the lord
If ya didn't in your soul, then you're destined to get yours

[Monoxide]
When I get to hell
I'll be sure to head for the throne
And all alone relieve the devil of his dome in his home
When I get to hell
I'm looking for Heath Ledger
I'll see if I can get all the shit he left on his dresser

[Jamie Madrox]
When I get to hell
I'ma start a new resistance
The first act, killing fifty of the devil's minions
No hell nor their total terror
In pure happiness people dance
As the devil was greener than me habit

[Monoxide]
When I get to hell
All the evil will line up
And celebrate my death by drinking cups of my blood
When I get to hell
I'm changing from skin to skeleton
My arms spread like wings of demons once again

[Hook]
I'm goin' to hell so who'll come with me?
(I'm going to hell so will you come with me?)
The devil stabbed me with a pitchfork, come get me
(The devil stabbed me with the pitchfork, come get me)
I'm goin' to hell so who'll come with me?
(I'm going to hell so will you come with me?)
The devil stabbed me with a pitchfork, come get me
(The devil stabbed me with the pitchfork, come get me)

Hell hell hell hell
Hell hell hell hell

[Jamie Madrox]
When I get to hell
I'm gonna crucify Hitler
As Napoleon watches from the front row and takes pictures
All the heads rolling makes the audience pop
Another demon dead, I'ma kill my way to the top

[Monoxide]
When I get to hell
I'll be swimming in a lake of blue flames
Skinnydipping in puddles of blood stains
Where everything is everything
And many bring anything that you need
From coke to murder sprees
Spreading like a disease

[Jamie Madrox]
When I get to hell
I'm fucking Marylin Monroe
Doggystyle in a fire pit with a gun to her dome
Flip the dress like the Seven Year engine
Pulling on the trigger as I bust like fuck that bitch

[Monoxide]
When I get to hell
I discombobulate and shake
'Til my bones break and separate like skin from a snake
When I get to hell
I roll like a sick force
Penetrate your skin like the horns on my pitchfork

[Hook]

[Jamie Madrox]
When I get to hell
They gonna eat my eyes first
Then run my ass over with an all black hearse
Scrape the leftovers up and shovel it in a bucket
And dump it on the orgies of demons as they was fucking
Gauze our pieces to chunks and sew it all up
Push me in the line waiting for the elevator up
To vacuum the soul right up out the host
So you can't haunt nobody
You're not even a ghost

[Hook x2]
