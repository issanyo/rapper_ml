Shaggy...
Shaggy...

[Violent J]
I can get naked, right here
I'd look like a eight pound polar bear
Then I'd have to atttack
Fuck you up like that
Psychopachics hatchet chops
Slappin ninjas on their hiding spots

(CRANK HIS SHANK SHOOGA BOOGA BAW)
(Juggalo Nations In The House)

[Violent J]
To the left, to the right
Over here! There! We're everywhere...
Always underground down with the bottom
(Bottom-Bottom-B-B-Bottom)
Censorin from the radio list
FUCK Y'ALL {BI*****...} Miss! (hahaha!)
Well, I guess we'll never be a radio star
Wouldn't work anyway, way too Bizzar...

Chorus: Shaggy 2 Dope

ANYBODY HERE??? (EVERYBODY HERE)
WE GOT THE GEAR??? (PSYCHO RIGHT HERE)
ANYBODY CARE??? (DONT NOBODY CARE)
JOKER (JOKER)
JOKER (JOKER)

ANYBODY HERE??? (EVERYBODY HERE)
WE GOT THE GEAR??? (PSYCHO RIGHT HERE)
ANYBODY CARE??? (DONT NOBODY CARE)
(WHAT?) WHAT?
(WHAT?) WHAT?
(WHAT?) WHAT?

[Violent J]
Sshhh it's a dead body in my trunk wanna see it? (Uhh..)
Fuck around and you'll be it! (bitch!)
Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child! (WE GET WILD)
Give it to me.. Give it to me...

[Twiztid]
I've been waggling my dick since the 7th Grade
Freek show, Grabbin my balls, and get paid
Ask Mom Dukes bitch, we don't play
Hair wigged out, and my eyes all gray

[Violent J]
No more rappin, no more shows
I'm going back to school, and working at Kinko's..
I wanna ride on campus on a mountain bike all day
HEY.. I got the right way
Stab shoot chop cut drill, I JUST WANNA KILL
No matter where you go motherfucker
Dark carnival ain't FAR, and it's way Bizzar..

[Esham]
Yo, this is Esham the Unholy, East Side, Hoes And Money
And right now, your enjoying a trip thats complete out your atmosphere
A little stroll into the wicked realm that is Insane Clown Posse
A journey into the Bizzar

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
If you a juggalo and you won't sell out say:
Fuck everybody on the dance floor
If you ever Had to fuck a fat bitch in the mouth say:
Fuck everybody on the dance floor
If you want a little Faygo and you want it fast say:
Fuck everybody on the dance floor
If you like feeling up on your homeboys' ass say:
Oh, uh, shit

[Violent J]
These killas dont dance, we boogy
We boogy woogy woo, that's all we do
(See ya, see ya, see ya)
(I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back)
Dark Lotus theme for your colon
Only team you on, Sunday bowling
{yloH si htxiS ehT}
Play that backwards for secret info
Hold up a minute, damn, couldn't wait man
All done, now if only I could choke someone
Redrum, I root for stalkers, slap old ladies up off thier walkers
Take my hand bitch, come along, it ain't that far
Welcome to the Bizzar!

(Chorus 2X)
