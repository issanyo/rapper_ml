There's a demon inside my soul
(And he always wants to kick it with me)
There's a human in there I know
(But he ain't never acting right)

[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
I'm higher than God on methamphetamines
I'm higher than Jesus on opium den on ketamine
I'm higher than Buddha if he said fuck Zen
I'ma hire Roto-Rooter then Iâ€™ll flush it in the end
I'm a shooter not a looter and I'm always in voodoo using words
Like toodles I don't give a flying fuck
Everybody buying I am the prime suppliant I am a drug
And nobody can be trying it
Ridiculing you for keeping you off a that Ritalin
This is a side of me I will forever regret within that bothers me
Looking for dope and another bottle of gin
With permanent devilish grin and my list of sins
I'mma fucking addict and I hurry to panic
Tnd this tragedy practically had to be eradicated
Radically medicated, shit I don't want it not more
Maybe my persona is stuck in the art form

[Verse 2: Monoxide of Twiztid]
Outta my mind, you'll find that I'm intertwined
With a long line a fucked up twines
That grind and try to align and hoping that I can never find another way to make it out alive
But, really I just wanna be crazy
Blame it on mind fucks I get on a daily
Look for the time, fuck, stuck in a daydream
But I don't wanna single person tryna save me, no safety

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox of Twiztid]
There's a demon in my head again
I probably need another dose of Ritalin
Or something like a sedative, I'm a lunatic in many ways
I'm the type of motherfucker looking for a better days
Standing in the rain with a sad face and the demon in my mind
I'mma take it at a fast pace, slow it down at the same time
And the fan base, don't I wanna be on my grind?
Living with the madness and I'm outta my mind's eye

The evil calms me down

[Verse 4: Kung Fu Vampire]
This is just one more thing to eliminate
People out of my life never to discriminate
The hating on my highlights, sipping on the salty lemonade
I'm eating creme brulee in a different city everyday
They try to get inside my head and hurt my family and friends
But I'm already bleeding from the inside
Out of place to think that it's erased for a title roll
But I just mind my business, dodging all of these federal
This is real, not a metaphor, on the floorboards
Got the blood of these bitches claiming that they are horrorcore
The metamorphosis corpses at an abortion orphanage
Contortion is the most important factor that I can escape
Now the eye in the sky was built to destruct and catch my lies
Feeling fresh to death tryna stay alive
Once out of my brain then left to die
