I'll disconnect you like SBC
Then reinvent your whole style for free
Suicide's even a better choice to me
So you really need to think about the shit you call beef
Don't come trying to explain a bit
Cause you really starting to sound like that same lame bitch
Yeah that same lame bitch who used to suck my dick
Who I see you tongue kiss who you all in love with
Tell me don't she fuck and suck the dick right
I hope you don't think she learned all that shit overnight
Now you stand there looking with the kill a man attitude
Should've been showing me some gratitude
The truth hurts like a semi truck
Just came outta nowhere and crashed
And fucked your whole world up
Don't like it then don't ask
I won't say shit
Cause I ain't the one you wanna come and get

[Hook x2]
Get ready for the fight of your life
I'm gonna end it tonight
Come get me if you wanna die
Just come outside meet me in the moonlight

[Violent J]
I'm drunk in this bitch don't tell me to calm down
I coming over there dropping the bomb down
Kicking in the front door, what you front for?
You screaming oh no I'm beaming the four-four
Don't tell me fuck you on the telephone
And think it's okay, muthafucka no way!
Don't flip me off and get caught at a red light
Cause I'll beat your skull with a lead pipe
You and your buddy's having funerals next week
More gonna be busy if I'm throwing a hissy
I be the bam-bam juggalo 44 clappa
Bitch slappa, I shit talk, Crip walk
Rich rapper, chick tapper, kidnapper
Get crunk, hit blunts, clip punks
Come and get this
And as soon as you miss
I blow holes in your lungs
Hear it whistle and hiss
As you, slowly die

[Hook x2]

[Jamie Madrox]
Oh what now I'm supposed to be scared of you
Cause you wanna talk and act like them big boys do?
Shootin dirty looks like you got some hate on your mind
You ain't the first you can gone wait your turn in line
Everybody wants some but look how when they get done
Tuck they tail between they legs and run just like a bitch
Fuckin' with a lunatic on the wrong day
With a hole where their throat usta be
Usually I don't persist with bull shit
But today I'm quite pissed, and looking to start shit
And if you want beef I got a whole cow off on the trunk
So be prepared for the drama you bitches and punks
Yea that's what's up ever ready just like a battery
Slicing through cartilage and punching in your anatomy
Over beef don't sleep
Cause you might not wake back up again
On the ground and just bleeding

[Hook]
