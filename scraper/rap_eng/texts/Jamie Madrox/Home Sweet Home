Home sweet home, the place where the lunatics roam
'Bout to peel a cop wit my chrome

Drop the dues and now you know me, but who knows me
Sown up they fucking eyes so they can't see

Niggas know me for being fake but then I step to em
And give 'em a plate just for old times sake

Never been a bitch, don't wanna be one
Any nigga can talk shit, when packing a gun
But the mack always stays true to the self
And you need to put your wack shit back up on the shelf

'Cause I'm a mad man, nothing but the mad man
Fuck the mad man, lunatic, psycho, Son of Sam
Niggas think that they mack because they diss
Anymore more niggas diss, I'ma get pissed
And drop a voodoo hex on that ass
Feel my wrath, burning suckers with the glass
Let the black magic get me by
I make the evil rain fall from the bright sunny sky

Know as a fucker, but please don't test
Fuck around and catch two to ya fucking chest
Now it's time for me to be lazy
When chilling out in the home in the House Of Krazees

Home sweet home
The place where the lunatics roam
Lunatics roam

Home sweet home
The place where the lunatics roam
'Bout to peel a cop wit my chrome

Packing the chrome, to ya dome, the only way out
Just a matter of time before the bullshit will play out
Ride the wave of a new breed
You suckers should take heed, I'm belting like a stampede
No need for mask magicians, the shit is all real
Never thought it'd be done to you, how's it feel
Taking the lives of men, women and child
You try to stop me, what, it wouldn't be worth while
My cork is popped like a bottle of champagne
On the loose man like a run away freight train

No one to be fucked with especially on no dumb shit
I rolled you and I smoked you like a motherfucking blunt bitch
Pack ya bags cause I'm coming for ya
Can't find ya now, so your brother be subbing for ya
I'm going get mine, like you going get yours
Blood stains in the halls, dead men on the floors

Peek through a window with broke glass
My time has come, at last to stick your motha fucking ass
Bury me six feet, and I will still creep
And raise the hell that put you in a dead sleep
So when you're asleep, I creep inside your dome
And let you know about my home sweet home

Home sweet home
The place where the lunatics roam
Lunatics roam

Home sweet home
The place where the lunatics roam
'Bout to peel a cop wit my chrome

Run hurry run quick
I got 'em on tha go
Don't move too slow
'Cause I'll make your head role

Born first time
Cause I'm havin' them side lines
Evil like a kenival
I'm a dead devil in drag

(?)
I saw so many bodies
I saw swanson outta buisness, yall

Nigga's that try to loot my home sweet home
I'll make click, I click, and stick
Untill they known, they fuckin' gone
And the House Of Krazees race it a sale room

That's where we hold all the unborn deadly ghouls
And for you fools that don't believe me
You gonna be seein' nightmare from this kick
You betta be scared bitch

And in my bedroom is my domain
Where I fix my brain
To bring you all this hella style
Of dope pain

Off (?), off tracks, all heads ya dead
Treasure my hard ass home until my death is red
Schitzofrania runs through my viens
Havin' memory lapses, I might kill my nigga's
That's how I aim

They watch me like a hawk
In my home sweet home
If I get outta line
They shoot me 'til I'm gone, I'm gone

There's no livin' room, bedrooms
Caskets are spread
Kitchen is killer like Jeffery Dahmer
He tracks his dead

On the day I was born my eyes were blush of red
Dead bodies now run me like Jordan
That's what I said

But don't come knockin' at my door
And run your throat
To be locked down in my home sweet home

Home sweet home, the place where the lunatics roam
Lunatics roam

Home sweet home, the place where the lunatics roam
'Bout to peel a cop wit my chrome

Home sweet home, the place where the lunatics roam
Lunatics roam

Home sweet home, the place where the lunatics roam
'Bout to peel a cop wit my chrome
