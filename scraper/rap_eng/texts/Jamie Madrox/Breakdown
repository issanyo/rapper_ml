[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Sometimes it could be much harder
When you feel like you’re becoming a target
Gotta embrace the bullseye and
Let em all know that they're looking in a mind of a monster
Looking for anybody who wanna regard this
I don't want any money I wanna leave em heartless
I just wanna tell them if I had it my way
You'd never have a motherfucking heart to start with
Let's go! Can anybody show me the way to my soul
Keeping it wicked in every way that I know
But I get lost, like a missed toss, and the ball goes out the window
Not a motherfucking role model
"We don't die" it'll be the only motto
'Bout to break down everyone of you ho's
I make sure the world knows who's weak and hollow
I'm a beast to follow, let it all looking for a beat to swallow
It'll be 52 weeks tomorrow, since I started
My killin' the weak shit embargo
Hid em all in precious cargo, ego killer, wanna sleep like all go
Maybe I'll save the world tomorrow
But right now your time is borrowed

[Hook x2: Madrox & Monoxide]
Breakdown!
(I can hear em callin' I can't stop from fallin')
Someone save me now!
(I'm just so confused now, feeling used and let down)

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Feel it real in your heart, like it's ride or die shit
It's a cold ass world, better pack an ice pick
And bring it down to the depths of this
Over shadow respecting this
Expecting this to be conceited and heavenless
But never live, never settle again, any better when
Life's weighing my patience, making me feel heaven
And if I have any real feelings, that’s relevant
Blessed to never forget like an elephant
Don’t fit like shotgun shells up in the derringer
Amongst the square pegs feeling more like a cylinder
Swing to the symphony, metridone
And the musical gravitation are pullin' ya
Close for microphones and earholes are fitted with zeros
Or forked tongues waking the dead
Makin' some new foes, a simple stain
And permament pain on a mission to take the clear throat
Y'all know this attractin' hope
But the lack there of be the true scope but no rope
Scapegoats in sailboats soon become
Sinking ships with escape rafts for cutthroats
Stay afloat cause we back again, and we destined to crack heads
We defying the top ten, the rest can drop dead
There’s no stopping when the twins are infectin'
With Twiztid to the end

[Hook x2]
