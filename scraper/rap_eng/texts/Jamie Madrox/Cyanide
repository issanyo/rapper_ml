[Monoxide]
I'm so addicted to this but my love it's too cold
Like ice cream and dip my dipstick in there
It's meltin again, so she gonna have shake on her chin
When I'm feeling to bust

[Madrox]
And you can trust I been know to paint them hoes
Like Pablo Picasso with no brush
Don't rush cause I'm comin' along
And I can supersoak the hole by the end of the song

[Bridge]
Don't help me
Don't touch me
Don't love me

[Monoxide]
She likes when I do what I do, when I do what I do so erotically
Treat a box like a tooth and I kill it to the root
Like I'm drillin for a cavity

[Madrox]
15 more pumps in me left
And I'm spent like the red pricetags on the clothes in the closet
Class A ho what you call it
Daddy was a junkie and mom's an alcoholic

[Hook x2]
Your love's like cyanide
The more that I drink
I feel sick inside
I just wanna free my mind and
(f-f-fuck you till I come then I'm done)

[Monoxide]
She works at Denny's and drives a Nova
Likes to get naked when she comes over
Then I get butt naked and I eventually bone her
Smokin a whole pack till I'm in a coma

[Madrox]
But I ain't got much to say
'Cept stir it like a mixin bowl and hallotick crates
When I hit her from the back and I'm pullin on her waist
And I take it to the front
Bout to paint her pretty face

[Monoxide]
She like it though, rubbein her rump down
And pullin' my eggroll and my egg dropps soup and hits the floor
It's ravanous bitch I got's to go!

[Bridge]

[Madrox and Monoxide]
Musa Medusa
Come soak me down with cyanide
The cut throat kinda game
I'm immune and I'm used to
The typical trouser
Most'll call it psychotic but

[Hook x2]
