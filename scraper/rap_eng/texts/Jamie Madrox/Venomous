[Verse 1: Lee Carver]

[Hook: Jamie Madrox & (Billy Obey)]
Kingdom come we ain't done yet
Joey Black, Billy Obey, Lee Carver, Monoxide plus I
Venomous five!
(Tell me who will survive?!)
Venomous five!
The cut the head of a snake, ain't no serpent alive
That can come face to face with a venomous five
(Tell me who will survive?!)
Dead or alive, you're in the midst of the venmous five

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Highly addicted to shit I shouldn't be
Like sneaking up in the parking stressed like I'm security
Hawking out through your emergency exits
Making sure my gateaway's clean, I'm getting restless
OCD with the checklist
My methods been tried, trued and tested
All the time in my mind invested in high crimes
Suggest that I hide inside of a maniacal transgression
Pick a lock on a first door, I'm a [?]
Let myself in, no lights on and I'm right on the money
Your life's gone, it's funny how I hide in plain sight
Just acting like I'm making shit everything is alright
And I don't need any invites
See you all in mindnight with a big knife
Cutting through your windpipe
Bitch I'm a sasquatch of the sick life

[Verse 5: Billy Obey]
My mind racing try to find meaning
Meanwhile the voice inside screaming
And your death; it's life streaming
Beheaded at the request of the audience
The peoples are applauding it
The sky is falling and I'm trapped underneath it
I feel the howling that I need to relinquish
Force feed my demons to the squeamish
Every evening...
Always heard of a heaven but never seen it
Just dream it, relax and nap it into pieces
I feel dismembered corpse and ohh
I didn't clean it after intercourse
Of course you're getting ate by a steak knife and dinner fork
This Head Of Horns ( [?] )
Not of this world, my human form an uniform
Truly torn, I'll burry the bodies and shoot a porn
Truth is your camp weak and we've only begun
You've summoned one hundred percent
Evil preach with a black tongue man
