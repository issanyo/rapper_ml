[Intro: Demon]
Built in 1803 by pagan settlers, Krossroads Inn has been responsible for over ten thousand untimely deaths. Rated the number one haunted location in the world, according to the spirit guides. Rumor has it, that the consequences of spending one night at the Krossroads Inn will result in death or even worse

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Got there in amazement, first haunted place
That I've ever stayed in all night
Up to this point was just chicken feet, this the real deal
Welcome to the big leagues
Thrill seeker with a video cam in hand
I'll be damned if miss a shot of the century on the count
Of I was unprepared with video photography
So I would be a little bit dumb
If I didn't come with state of the art for the hunt
There's a curse that whoever signs the ledger with full name
Will never be aloud to return from whence they came
So to prove it all wrong, I jotted mine down fast
Put my middle initial between my first and my last
Sign my curse, so I laughed, sign it like an autograph
Even though thereâ€™s no way to detect the time stamp
Who am I to believe that she could real
As the camera rolls and records what I feel

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
This is where my problem begins
After just one night at the Krossroads Inn
Cuz you can't check out after you check in
After just one night at the Krossroads Inn
I've got to live it up
Even the the deads around
I've got to live it up
Screamin crawlin out of the ground
I've got to live it up
Even though the darks so scare
I've got to live it up
Twist and spin around in the air
I've got to live it up

[Interlude: Demon]
Signing the hotel ledger registry will prove what seems to be a funny hoax after all still what lies ahead just up them winding stairs is sure to be solid proof to any skeptical man

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Up the stairs and I'm climbin it quickly
Hopin' the camera catches everything in between
(I've reached the top now)
I'm in the hallway walkin' and I whip around quick
Cause I swear I heard talkin
And my camera drops and the house, it goes black
All of a sudden I feel a hand on my back
Lights come on, I'm freakin out
I can hear the people walkin on the top of the house
Room flickers with blue light and catchin my attention
I can see the reflection of someone standing there
I got the cam and I'm holdin' it steady
And I'm thinkin I got the pictures of whatever
And I'm outta here
Door opens to an empty room
And consume my inhibition to explore the moon
Was the flickerin light, then I seen in the crack of the door
Alright I gotta make it to the end of the night

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
This is where my problem begins
After just one night at the Krossroads Inn
Cuz you can't check out after you check in
After just one night at the Krossroads Inn
I've got to live it up
Even the the deads around
I've got to live it up
Screamin crawlin out of the ground
I've got to live it up
Even though the darks so scare
I've got to live it up
Twist and spin around in the air
I've got to live it up

[Interlude 2: Demon]
In the center of night left in the [?] morning. We've found two thrilling secrets now unwinded to this unholy structure. In reality they believe they're still alone. We're attempt to continue to break free from the destiny that cannot be changed

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Covered in shards of glass jumped through the window
And ended up in the lobby hit the floor on my ass
(I got up and brushed off)
Now I'm sort of confused
I'mma break every window with an effort to get through
Every door locked shut with a skeleton key
As apperisions re-appear, dissapear in front of me
(I'm goin outta my mind)
As the camcorder batteries start to die
I'm the only one in here that's still alive
There's a lady in all white floatin' down the hall
And says "welcome home sweety" as her head falls off
That has turned the ghost spell home to me
But I'm trapped in krossroads and unable to leave

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
This is where my problem begins
