[Hook]
I said we been livin' at the bottom for too long
And we celebratin’ ourselves
I said we been livin' at the bottom for too long
And we celebratin' ourselves
I got a new life and this hold up
No stars splashing that cold duck
We celebrating like a motherfucker
Y’all brought it back like sho nuff
We celebrating ourself, self, self
We celebrating ourself, self, self

[Verse 1: Madrox]
Now you can give back just like a masseuse
We been immersing the abuse and continue to treat family like an excuse for the way that we were treated, misleaded
In an attempt to belittle and repeat it, the cannon defended
That's probably the reason we're independent
No new friends without a question
It's like a metal, it has poken sins, like who's to live by
Once a homie now you can give a fuck if he live or die
One foot in the casket, the other foot in the real world
I know it sounds drastic, but I'm telling you how I feel girl
Life's a bitch with an attitude on the rag, always mad at you
Coming down like a storm, you do what you have to do

[Hook]
I said we been livin' at the bottom for too long
And we celebratin’ ourselves
I said we been livin’ at the bottom for too long
And we celebratin' ourselves
I got a new life and this hold up
No stars splashing that cold duck
We celebrating like a motherfucker
Y’all brought it back like sho nuff
We celebrating ourself, self, self
We celebrating ourself, self, self

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
It ain't about who's right, it's who’s first
Lies calling and the truth hurts
Misled is the new church
Put that on God like a new shirt
I'm sick and tired of
Feeling like I am
Keep biting my tongue while they get all their lies spun
Just want them to die son
Stand out on the right son
For me to oblige none (think this all the lies)
Come for me and imma be that killa
You don't have to wait for that killa, diction
RIP Mac Miller, listen
Wish you wish weren't in his position
The world's I got in my vision
Everybody duckin' now that I'm spittin'
Up to kicks with boots for a makin'
Little pussy, who you think you gettin'
Send the cowards to do your biddin'
Watch 'em scour but you keep that hidden
Devour you in a New York minute
If you talkin', my names unbidden

[Hook]
I said we been livin' at the bottom for too long
And we celebratin' ourselves
I said we been livin' at the bottom for too long
And we celebratin' ourselves
I got a new life and this hold up
No stars splashing that cold duck
We celebrating like a motherfucker
Y'all brought it back like sho nuff
We celebrating ourself, self, self
We celebrating ourself, self, self

[Outro]
We celebrating ourself
We celebrating ourself
We celebrating ourself
And we celebrating ourselves
