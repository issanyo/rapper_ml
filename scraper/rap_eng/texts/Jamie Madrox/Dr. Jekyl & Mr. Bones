Perhaps we can make a deal....

Who is it? Dr. Jekyl or Mr. Bones?
Come quick cuz I'm still, I'm chillin' at they fuckin' door
But wait a minute, could you unlock the door?
You're in my jam
'Cause I can do it man, I know I can
But is it me or Mr. Bones rappin'?
Tombstone tappin'
Voices laughin'
When we castin'
Many spells or many hexes, you can't even tell
So go and help 'fore your brain swells
Part of being a sick man is tryin' to keep my sanity
Label my tapes explicitely because of the profanity
But wait a minute, I'm the fuckin' killa
I'll hang yo' ass up like Michael Myers in the cellar
A dweller
I'm on the display, it's sad but true
But, uh....fuck you
'Cause I ain't got shit to prove

All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man

Verse 2, I'm still psycho-trippin'
I'm on the hunt for a bitch that I can stick my dick in
But if she give me some shit
Mr. Bones, or hell, anybody, it's a guaranteed wig split
With an axe to the dome
Fuck the chrome
Because I'd rather get my bone on
And get my bone on is what I must
I'm leavin' niggas three-six degrees, turnin' suckas to dust
But when I bust
Never felt no tragedy
The roads that I walk are filled with dirt so feel no panic
Still broke
I'm the funky brother named Bones
And I'm always on the run, let the skin stone
But the biotridy is comin' quickly
And if you step in my path, I'm gettin' with thee
So if you try to take me on
Never come alone
Or you'll feel the wrath of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Bones

All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man
All my friends say I'm a cool young man
