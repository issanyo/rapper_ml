[Intro]
Cuz I just really wanna get high
Cuz I just really wanna get high

[Hook]
Cuz I just really wanna get high
To the sky, I just wanna fly
Come on let’s get high
I feel faded, elevated
That’s how I'm livin my life
X2

Hello, you with me now
Up in them clouds, not coming down

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I'm rollin up this caviar in a cone
And I’ll eat this candy bar
And zone like I'm on them xanny bars
And the best moon rock this side of Mars
I got T-A-B’s full of T-H-C
And a buncha different bottles we can P-O-P
Stay high like Snoop, D-O-double-G
Smoke down on that sour, P and G-D-P’s
From the 3-1-3 to the 4-15
I'm going platinum with the Larry
And I keep my kush: O-G
Super silver with my haze, take a jet fuel to my face
And I’ll leave without a trace if your weed is a disgrace
And I like to lace it up with wax and a little bit of crazy stuff
Hash, a little bit of oil, until my face is stuck
And I got a big bag of keef, and I'm loadin up the zone
Liberation by Outkast, my favorite smokin song
Thinkin all I want to do is be up in the sky
And I can’t make no excuse

[Hook]
Cuz I just really wanna get high
To the sky, I just wanna fly
Come on let’s get high
I feel faded, elevated
That’s how I'm livin my life

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
I may never get enough of that good, here
Never can get too high, pill spear
But the ladder never got enough rungs in it
Every time, to the top, on my tippy toes, tryna touch heaven
With my arms stretched out, but I still can't fucks wit it
I'm a overachiever, and I’ll admit it
Keep it, Ringo, let’s get it, and rock shit like a brand new fitted
Right back, hittin that sweet leaf
Put a little ease on that stress and grief
Slow motion, sink in my seat
I'm chinky-eyed and look tore down and half (asleep)
My brain feels like cat food
My body feels like fat dude
I'm a little bit drunk, with an attitude
But I'm smooth like Vidal Sassoon
Drivin sloss long of us pass you
In a minute wit the bathroom
Fallin over in the stall, excuse me do you have room?
Pardon me if a little bit splash you
Yes, I'm white trash with tattoos
Let’s get tore down when I pass through
I’ll walk by blood too
I'm high, I'm gone, I'm snafu
Inhale, exhale, I need food
To the taco bell around or near you
My vision’s startin to blur too
But the night’s still early
We still got the rest of this bag
Right here, to work through
Yes, this concerns you
You may never smoked a hundred joints
I just really learned to

[Hook x2]
Cuz I just really wanna get high
To the sky, I just wanna fly
Come on let’s get high
I feel faded, elevated
That’s how I'm livin my life
