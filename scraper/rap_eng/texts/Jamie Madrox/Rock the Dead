Why don't you go play with your friends?
They're all dead...

[Hook]
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Come on

[Jamie Madrox]
Space and beyond
Mind of an idiot
I stole your headstone from your grave plot
Conscious and confused
See tomorrow's dreams on tonight's news
Fallin' through a hole in the sky
Will I die?
You know the time multiplied with this life, love, and lies
Steppin' in the darkness
Walkin' through my conscience
Like an android I remain heartless
Underground, and mental know me well
Bring it to the white lights of the depths of Hell
Walk through the time flux hand in hand with clear minds
Thoughts are harmonious like the rhythm of wind chimes
Peel back the rind and examine the fruit
Rotten to the core buried in they best suits
Maggots crawling out they face
Eyes sunk in they head
Throw your fuckin' arms up and rock the dead

[Hook]
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Come on
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to 10
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts runnin' all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead

[Monoxide]
Screamin' like AAH!
I can't even take it no more
Release the straps on my jacket and let me go
Ill medication got my whole body shakin'
Thinkin' escaping
But they gonna keep on chasing
I'm facing off with the world and the planet
Dig a hole
Buried alive like good goddammit
It ain't a living thing
It's a no fuck giving thing
Bring the pain
And I'mma bleed with the rain
Insane when I leave this bitch
I got the whole world screaming out
YOU AIN'T SHIT!
They'll be the wrong ones you can bet
I don't know why you hide your face
Cause I'm coming for your neck
Get hot on the plot
What you got?
Should I cut your head off on the spot?
A whole pile of dead bodies I'm on top
Me and my man rockin' the dead like UHH non-stop

[Hook]
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Come on
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to 10
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts runnin' all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to 10
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts runnin' all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead

[Jami Madrox]
Think about it a hundred years from now
It was all different people livin on the planet
Now they dead
200 years ago it was a whole 'nother posse
Now they dead
The dead probably out number the living 10, 000 to 1
A hundred years from now we'll be dead
So fuck that! I'mma run with the mutha fuckin' dead

[Monoxide]
Got my vision on you point blank range
Strange look coming cause I'm in all black
And I'll be rockin with an axe
Everyday life how I'm livin'
Cemetery walks, and grave diggin'
Sacrifice another victim
You can hear me screaming through the trees and the woods
Hang myself on a higher branch if I could
Gotta get em out
Gotta get these sick thoughts outta my head
So I be rockin the dead

[Jamie Madrox]
Some of my best friends are dead
If you include Monoxide, Violent J, Shaggy, and Evil Ed
Serial killas from the West and the East
And all the dead mutha fuckas from here to Greene street
Fuck it if you're missing some limbs and patches of hair
Nod your bald head and throw your nubs in the air
I wanna see zombies jumpin', screamin' loud
And kill every live mutha fucka in the crowd

[Hook]
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Take it
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to 10
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts runnin' all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to 10
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts runnin' all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise
Wake up, moons in the sky
Bring the wicked shit and the dead will arise(Rock the dead! )
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to 10
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts runnin all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to 10
And all we wanna do is rock the dead
So many thoughts runnin all through my head
But the only one that's clear is rock the dead
Got me a mic and a PA cranked to 10
