[Verse 1: Madrox]
Blood, guts, infected cuts cover most or all of my soul
Blinking Morse code when blood splashes in the eye
Stab a couple hundred times
Shit, I'm being generous, I saved all the rage for you
You deserve the benefits
Stab a couple more times
Your body's like a blood sponge
Break the rib cage and cartilage, and puncture both your lungs
Take a deep breath for me
Gurgle, filling up with blood
Choking while you're tryin' to breathe, put that on my crimson love
Shiny red latex gloves
They say I be fearing it
But then again you're bleeding like a pussy on its period
Stab a couple million times
This time in the face I will, watch the blade get stuck in skull
Really accentuate the kill
They say that your graveyard should never leave your head
Or corpse alive, so I'll keep stabbing 'til your body's fit and dead
Of course I've saved all this pain for you, every ounce of anger
Now I'm pincushionin' a voodoo doll, laughing while you're bleedin' out

[Hook]
(Blood)
All I'm looking for
(Blood)
All I want is your
(Blood)
When I feel like I'm finally at my breaking point
(Blood)
When I'm thinking like "what the fuck am I stopping for?
I should not be stopping for anything but your spinal cord"
I'll just put another cut on you
'til the blood's all gone and the knife runs through
When I pull it back out and I'll put it back in
And that'll be the way til everybody's gonna end

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Just wanna get a knife and go STAB, STAB, STAB, STAB
Don't know when it might be, though
Cause I might be so in a frightening zone
All I wanna put in you is holes, anytime I'm losing control
Just gotta find a better way to put a blade inside you, that's the shit I'm on
Gotta keep going 'til I feel bone and I ain't talkin' thuggish and ruggish
But I wanna get crazy, number one enemy of the public
Juggalo and I keep it scrubby, put a nick up in your tummy
When I'm on a date with something lovely, gotta decapitate you honey
Gotta get my hands on something sharp and shiny
Gotta take my chance and try to stab in a trailer park behind me
But I wait for dark that's when the racist remarks start to flying
Out of their mouths, I'm bout to invoke a race riot
Well I'm about to do my part and erase white
In the rest of this crowd like a chalkboard
And I got more knives than any store you can think of got stock for
And a lock is not gonna make me stop I'm thinking about that noise that I just heard and I
[Gunshot]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Madrox]
Impale, exhale, entrails everywhere
Stab me too, if you can 'fore you die
Make it fair
What am I, a masochist? So what if I love pain
Stab a couple hundred times
Sharpen knives and play the game
Blood splattered everywhere, must have cut a vital one
Blood loss, turning pale, tell me - are we having fun?
I ain't close to being done, I've still got some blood in me
Standin' there dripping 'til I run my life's expectancy

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
And expecting me to be anything less than a lunacy I see
Is like holding your breath and then hoping you still breathe
It's not gonna happen, I give my life to the stabbin'
And like a flame to a dragon I like to burn everything
That I've captured
But I've stabbed so many holes in your body that the burning
It doesn't matter, I'm a human disaster
And all I wanna do is take a knife and go right through your back, sir

[Hook]
