[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
I feel her touch like a cold breeze tickled my neck
She here to show me more ways in the dark
I would expect her to know by now
I won't bend or be afraid
Of anything she shows me or anything she say
She wants me to be scared cause she feeds on fear
And shows me horrible things so I don't see so clear
My vision is so distorted and covered with new eyes
That show me people covered in blood and ready to die
I'm afraid of my own self
And it won't help me none
To get a gun and put it to my dome
I know that you're alone and I figured that we could talk
If she don't get out of my head then I'm blowing my shit off

[Hook: Madrox]
She keeps calling on me every night
She's scratching the walls to keep me afraid, everyday
She keeps tearing at my sanity
Unbearing how it's become so mundane
Becoming insane, I won't be afraid

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
She didn't know that I was used to it
Flashbacks trigger my brain
And shoot through it like fireworks, again and again
And if I'm going insane, then I'm taking somebody with me
Out the window of the glass house you've been living in
And then if I'm just another page
That you can turn and get away from
Then please do me a favor and turn it before the day comes
And hopefully it's sooner then later
Cause I'm feeling my patience growing thin in this relationship
And the greater you intergrate
All the hate into my mind state
There's only one way to retaliate, grab the thirty eight
And hold it to my temple, waiting on the word
And now it all seems so simple, it's obsurd
Maybe it'll stop when she sees me holding the gun
I was suicidal, this is what I'm gonna become
I'm hoping you can learn from my past and what I've done
And on a long run maybe you gonna have to use a gun

[Bridge 1: Monoxide and Madrox]
She keeps calling me (always calling me) again
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
She keeps calling me (always calling me) again
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid

[Verse 3: Madrox]
What if wizards were wicked, would I sing of evil spells
And hidden incantations to open the gates of hell
Would if style were wicked, would I wear human skin
With magic conflicts in a cane that's made of skeleton
What if hell were heaven, in heaven we're in reverse
Would it really change the balance here on Earth
Care to think about it? I don't
Got too many problems of my own
Insanity, it's a grip that I'm trying to keep a hold on

[Brdige 2: Monoxide]
I just want to be left alone
So everybody please just go away
Inside of my mind is where she calls home
And I just can't take another word she say

[Verse 4: Madrox]
What if a rose was wicked, would it have teeth?
Would it bite all who smell it, leave new holes in their cheeks?
What if love was wicked, would it make me want to bite?
Till I drew blood, staining my teeth like fist fight
What if art was wicked, would I paint with blood?
Would I sculpt with guts?
Would I mount human heads to the wall with love?
Probably all of the above and then some
Spend a little time, only the streets help

[Bridge 1]
