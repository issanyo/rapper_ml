[Intro: Monoxide]
The scene is gruesome. Blood and people scattered everywhere. We don't know what to do, we've never had a massacre of this proportion. All of 'em with their heads chopped off...

(Everybody, everybody's dead)

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
It was an ordinary Halloween night
When we came upon a street and didn't see a single porch light
It must be where the goodie-goodies live
Thinkin' that they too good to give candy to little kids
I'm not little or a child by any means
But I brought my pillowcase and I'm down for the trick or treats
No treats means tricks for y'all
I got an axe in the bag that'll shatter your skull
Hopin' I'mma be more precise with mine
Still thinkin' "Underneath the jaw, take em at the neck line"
One good swing, with a thug to follow
Leave em Ebeneezer Crane, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow
That's a lot of blood, you gonna want to get a towel
Then wrap it around your neck like a makeshift cowl
Blood clots up in three minutes flat
You done wasted two of them lying dead on your back

[Hook: Madrox & Monoxide]
Knock knock
Open up the door
'Fore we kick that bitch in, leave you dead on the floor
I'mma flying skull
I'mma take that bitch home
And put a candle up his nose and watch that shit glow
Come on, knock knock
The window works too
We gon' slip right through and be standing behind you
I'mma cut her dome off
And watch her head roll off
And sit with the body till it turn blue like your love

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
First house I'm hittin' is next door
Call the cops cause of the weed I grow
Up the porch and through the front window
I'mma hide in the closet where nobody know
Pop out so fast that I'm toast
But my hand connects to his throat and I'm ghost
Next house is right behind me
Had the nerve to sell me a fake bag of tree
Up the porch and down his chimney
Like Santa, except I got a big machete
It's like Christmas when I kill on Halloween
But my bag's full of heads of people who cross me
Father let us in over a bunch of candy
I call use em all for pumpkins like J and Shaggy
I'm bad news like All Hallow's Eve
And when the two mix, it's over with for my enemy

[Hook: Madrox & Monoxide]
