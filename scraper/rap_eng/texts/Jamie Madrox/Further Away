Farther and farther away [x4]

[Violent J:]
My compass spins outta control
Which way do I go to get outta this hole
I've come so far that I've lost my way
Gone in a world full of yesterdays
The sun and the moon have become my tomb
Morphed into one as my time comsumes me
No direction no reception nothing but a godless life extension

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Gone out the skull on a dropped off ball
In the death valley desert with peyote in my jaw
My head is pounding my vision is clouded
Barely see the shadows of the people who surround me
Nothing astuonding This is man at his lowest point
And I'm shaping up the bottle and merely lacing up a joint
The brought me back to earth now everythings in focus
The only reason I'm still breathing is only thrugh dark lotus

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
It's a never ending story I'm like a tread
Get away from the nothingness that consumes me
Floating on a log barely see the land
Back in the day I was basking in the sand
I don't see no hope I don't see no trying the
Only way out this shit is... MAN FUCK DYING!
THE FARTHER I GET THE CLOSER I COME TO SOMETHING else
And that's murder slug nothing more nothing less

Farther and farther away [x4]

[Monoxide:]
Where the fuck am I going don't know and don't care
DL up in the air you know I'll be there
Ain't no spare time better beware the line is drawn
In your blood like a nightmarish flood
No hugs no thugs spit wikid shit
When the time come quick I'll be waiting by the spaceship
Face this fat bitch at bat with a whole new reason for unleashing the attack

[Jamie Madrox:]
No sence of direction strayed from the path
Even GPS can't find my ass
Lowjack got an indicater can't locate me
Guess I'm lost better pray that they find me
Alive or dead maybe buried in the woods
Chopped up in the trunk in the back of the hood
Assimilate the team when death is the goal
Put the pedals back together the flower becomes whole

[Violent J:]
The sun and the moon have become my tomb
Morphed into one as my time comsumes me(can't locate me)

[Blaze:]
My head is pounding my vision is clouded
Barely see the shadows of the people who surround me (can't locate me)

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
THE FARTHER I GET THE CLOSER I COME TO SOMETHING else
And that's murder slug nothing more nothing less(can't locate me)

[Monoxide:]
No hugs no thugs spit wikid shit

[Jamie Madrox:]
Lowjack got an indicater can't locate me

Farther away [x4]
