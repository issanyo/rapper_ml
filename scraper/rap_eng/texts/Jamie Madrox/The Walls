[Shaggy]
I sit up at night, it's at least 3 or 4
Blood drippin out my knuckles
From knocking skin on drywall
I see a face like flashlights on they chins
The more I blink the more it happens again, damn
Victims, from like '89
Floating their faces on the wall like it's the last time
I'm gonna see them again
The same time every night
The wall gets bigger with every flash of day light

[Madrox]
Are they like venting on me
Walls confining me, inside of me
There's an emptiness that won't go away
I never said that I was right inside of my mind
But I'm sure over time I'll learn to climb the walls
I'm sure that over time I'll learn to right all of my wrongs
Sure it's right, four walls reflecting my life
Every night that I sit and watch the replay

[Chorus]
Surrounding me (surrounding me)
These walls ain't holding me back (holding me back)
They can't tell me where we at (me where we at)
I'm uncontainable (uncontainable)
Surrounding me (surrounding me)
These walls ain't holding me back (holding me back)
They can't tell me where we at (me where we at)
I remain in control (in control)

[Monoxide]
Tell 'em
I can feel them looking at me
I can even hear them talking when I'm tryin to sleep
Sometimes they start spinnin or just closing in
And it's just too much to be, I can't win
Don't grin, it ain't funny
I just set it ablaze
I had to burn a whole ounce to escape that maze
I was burned from my neck to my feet
But it was worth it until I went back
I didn't even hurt it

[Violent J]
One wall surrounds me, no roof, no floor
I started falling as soon as I stepped through the door
Plain walls, don't let me see a crack in the paint
Where I'm focusing in and focused I ain't
Clang bang, I bloody the walls
I leave stains
So the next man falling at least can see things
I think of my life, reliving every memory
Starring into the walls of my epitome, falling

[Blaze (x2)]
Nothing but walls, but its all right
My back to the room in the corner all night
(Even in the darkness)
Nothing but walls, but its all right
My back to the room in the corner all night
(These walls keep watching me)

[ABK]
I always catch myself starring into a dark day
Same place, new age
Hoes punch with rage
If they could talk, they probably wouldn't say much
Because I always keep myself looked away in such
Such a sheltered life being wasted away
Like four walls on a casket being put in a grave
So many hours spent looking at nothing
But I keep on glaring steadily hoping for something

[Blaze]
I stare into space through my cell gate
For 80 years I've been known as inmate 14278
Walls can't confine me, on the noose every week
And when the guards take me for my shock treatment
I be leaving out the space in my head
To control the minds and unearth the undead
The problem is, I'm only out for two days
And I return to my coma and these walls and bars around me

[Chorus]
Surrounding me
These walls ain't holding me back
They can't tell me where we at
I'm uncontainable
Surrounding me
These walls ain't holding me back
They can't tell me where we at
I remain in control

Surrounding me
These walls ain't holding me back
They can't tell me where we at
I remain in control
Surrounding me
These walls ain't holding me back
They can't tell me where we at
I remain in control

Surrounding me
Holding me back
Holding me back
In control

Surrounding me (surrounding me)
These walls ain't holding me back (holding me back)
They can't tell me where we at (me where we at)
I'm uncontainable (uncontainable)
Surrounding me (surrounding me)
These walls ain't holding me back (holding me back)
They can't tell me where we at (me where we at)
I remain in control (in control)
