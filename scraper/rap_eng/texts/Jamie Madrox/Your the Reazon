We havnt come to the end of our journey
This is just the begining
The begining of what you ask?
The begining of Forever
Through the eyes of many we are judged daily
And although their hatred for use may seem great
It will never surpass the love we pledge to each and every one of yall

Show me the reazon why...
(we do the things that we do)
Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)
Show me the reazon why...
(we represent the underground always have always will now)
Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)

You're the reazon why I can express myself freely
And give the finger to those who try hate but wanna be me
You're the reazon why I won't do 20 to life
You shed some light up on the might be able to change the world for all of us
You're the reazon my heart is still pumpin
And I ain't out on the corner dumpin or shootin somthin
You're the reazon we representin the twiztid sound
Fuck the mainstream, the life fo me is the underground
You're the reazon why the hotlines are updated
And the website is always bein upgraded
You're the reazon why im glad to be a juggalo
And bring the wicked shit to ever town now everybody go
You're the reazon I be kissin the clouds
And walk through the curtain and captivate the whole crowd
You're the reazon ive exsisted all along
You're the reazon for this song...

Show me the reazon why...
(we do the things that we do)
Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)
Show me the reazon why...
(we represent the underground always have always will now)
Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)

You're the reazon why I get no sleep
Somtimes its just a couple days
On the tops its weeks and weeks
You're the reazon why I still got heart
For my los and lettes
And BIG KIDS for the most part
You're the reazon why the season never change
If we paste our problems together
We all can re-arrange and stand strong
Yours the reazon why we been here so long
And representin you for the beats taht we flow on
You're the reason why we do whut we do
If you see use puttin it down we representin you
You're the reazon why I want to cry
Ya see we love ya muh fuckas so much we dedicate our lives
Family, unity, wit diversity and individuality so fuck popularity
You're the reazon why we sing this song
And stay high till the break of dawn
Hit the bong and come along

Show me the reazon why...
(we do the things that we do)
Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)
Show me the reazon why...
(we represent the underground always have always will now)
Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)

You're the reazon why I can walk on top of water
And represent your sons a daughters
You're the reazon why I float below the ground
And when the lights go im still alight
Cuz im livin off of sound
You're the reazon why I put my life into this shit
I swear to god if you dont feel me im just as real as counter-fit
You're the reazon why ive been chosen, selected
With the juggalos im connected

You're the reazon why I stop to give a (can't make out this word) shake
A hand n hug the honeys
And tag a twiztid autograph
You're the reazon why crows fly
You're the reazon we scream DieMuthaFuckaDie to the outside
And everybody who ain't rappin this
You're the reazon why the Carnival is blessin this
You're the reazon why I act like a ninjalo
You're the reazon why mutha facko I think ya know

Show me the reazon why...
(we do the things that we do)
Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)
Show me the reazon why...
(we represent the underground always have always will now)
Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)

I won't let you down...
I won't let you down...
I won't let you down...
I won't let you down...

Show me the reazon why...

Show me the reazon why...

Show me the reazon why...

Show me the reazon why...
(take a chance with me I won't let you down)

Show me the reazon why...
