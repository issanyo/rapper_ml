(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Galacto Inspector do you read me?
Yes Captain
Status?
Completed
Your mission was to land on the Dirtball and explore it thoroughly
You were to monitor the activities of a common life on the Dirtball
And study peoples life styles
Their general habits of living in their strange society
Yes
Have you done that Galacto Inspector?
Yes I have Captain
Very well, may we have your report?

A strange place this Dirtball is
A lot of guns a lot of rich folks spitting on bums
A lot of hoodlums
These are just the bums that are really pissed off
Why? Probably cuz they been ripped off by the system
Cops, they ride around in little cars
And throw folks behind bars, like little jars
They supposed be there just to serve and protect
But they just punch faces a lot, and choke necks
Then they got the higher ups they call judges, and they rule the land
This I don't understand
First of all they like to dress this bitch up in a robe
On top of all that, "What?" he's mad old
And he hates anybody that looks different then he did back when he was a kid
But that shit was like 400 years ago
Captain "Yes Galacto" I just don't know
And the kid that was going to jail. Yeah?
He looked me dead in the face and said "Stale."
Then my cloaking device must of went dead. Why?
Cause the old ass judge looked at me and said

(Chorus x2)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out

(Twiztid)
Very interesting, thank you Galacto Inspector
Now probes Data (Day-ta) and Data (Da-ta), do your read me?
Yes, here sir
What information were you able to gather for us on your recent voyage to the
Dirtball?

This is professor Data
My transmission signal is weak and my communication is shattered
We came in contact with several different specimens of life
Everything has got a price even if it's wrong or right
Upon sight people judge and stereotype
Their forms of government and religion are glorified
Purified as the waters that are now polluted
Members of the flock recruited for duty, locked up, or instituted
This is doctor Data I phase with the planet to see how they medicate her
She's high off that cane
Depending how you slang you can get most anything
From a nickel bag of grain to a lucy worth of cane
Maintain communication Data here again
Their leader is determined by the vote of many men
Although he's only human and slightly over weight
He control's and manipulates their whole United States
I call to the white castle
Secret service on the phone giving me a hassle
He said the information I requested was denied
Before he hung up the phone he took a deep breath, stopped, and replied

(Chorus x2)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out

(Violent J)
Judging from the information so far collected
The Dirtball may not be the ideal place to land our craft
After receiving Fleek's information we'll make our final judgment
Fleek are you there?
I'm here, but hold up captain cause this ain't good
I'm getting chased by some fat rednecks in white hoods
I think there trying to kill me "Well what do you mean?"
It seems they got a problem with the fact that I'm green
I guess on the Dirtball they all hate each other
If it ain't were your from, it's your skin color
Let me get my phase-a-tron out, hold up (buzz)
"What was that?"
I smoked 'em
But what really fuckin turns my tentacles is their relationships
They swell each other's lips
I see men that ain't shit in their daily life
So they come home drunk and beat they wife
She forgives him when he say's he didn't mean it
You ask me they can both suck my glippy glip
I give up captain beam me back to Zelaloovy
Another thing they love to watch horror movies
But your not allowed to be scary on a CD
They tried to ban this one group ICP
I went to see 'em in concert J grabbed me by the head
And then he took his microphone and said

(Chorus x6)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out

(Chorus x4)
Get the fuck out
So get the fuck out
