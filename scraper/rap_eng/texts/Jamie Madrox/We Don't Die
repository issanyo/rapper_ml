[Verse 1: Madrox]
We ain't underground by accident
Theres only a select few that can handle this
FREEK SHIT, apparation of a poltergiest
Blessed with a heart but it's cold as ice and broken twice
Now I walk with an axe
Dressed in all jet black with contacts
Straight maniac, warlock, Samhain and Salem's Lot
Sand through the hour glass tickin of the clock

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
If you dont know by now its too late
We the most serious thing on the market since date rape
We the dead, we don't explain or feel pain BEZERKo
Keep it underground and maintain
Bitch you better check nuts
I'm doin voodoo, leave ya 66 for 6 months
Ridin' in a decked out hearse with gold spokes
Puffin on a two ton blunt with dead folks
And it's like that

[Hook]
AXE MURDERERS!!
WE DON'T DIE!!!!!!!
SERIAL KILLERS!!
WE DON'T DIE!!!!!!!
FREEKS OF THE NIGHT!!
WE DON'T DIE!!!!!!!
WE GET HIGH!!
WE DON'T DIE!!!!!!!

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Comin up outta the ground, from the underground tunnel I dug
To keep away from the mainstream love
Just want somebody to move and get hurt
Got ya hole dug deep in the dirt
Can't work with ya Bitch mother fuckers
Makin love to the press
With a bitch named tatted on your chest
Me and muhfuckin' Madrox, haunting the joint
Bringing death to the people that don't get the point
We don't die...

[Verse 4: Madrox]
Uh Huh, we unreal
Just like a 7 dollar bill
Voice my opinion regardless of how you feel
Freek Shit
It ain't about being rich
It's about juggalos and runnin with lunatics
As long as ya'll rock this we won't quit
We do it all for y'all
I mean that shit
Everyone of y'all means everything to me
We bleed for Y'all thats why we call it family

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Madrox]
It's hard to explain the element of my
Self inflicted pain
We're not positive, and upliftin'
Fuck you, walk a mile in our shoes
Experience hard times and payin' helly dues
Freak shit
What I live what I breath
Cast out Mutant X like his disease
Still they try to ban our sound
Cause supposedly it be resurrecting
The dead from under hallowed ground

[Verse 6: Monoxide]
You in the dead zone, 10 points for us
Smellin' cigarette smoke right before your lungs bust
Plus, you can't trust him
But I can bust him in half
And sit back and laugh at all the shit I did
Can you do that?
Could you school that?
Better yet, I'm a wigged out serial killer
Type war vet
Freakshow, different from the rest
But I, love it though
Put you to the test

[Hook]
