[Jamie Madrox]
Sweet silence will bestow upon me soon
Alone, I sit, writing this in my bedroom
Candles flicker as the wind blows steady
With shaky hands my heart weighs heavy
Run it over in my mind and tell myself that
I'm ready to upgrade the situation from calm to deadly
Grab the blade and put it to my neck
Start to push it in, nope, not ready yet
Need another second to deliberate another way to go
Something way more artistic and a lot more painful
Sleeping pills, no that's wack
They can pump your stomach and you'll come right back
Have you sitting in a group with other suicide arrests
Reminiscing every minute and brush with death's kiss
Not for me, I'ma never go back
You will see a blast of light as I fade to black

[Hook]
Now that you know that it's time to go (die)
Whatcha gonna write in your death note (suicide)
If you tell me how the story unfolds (die)
Tell me what's to cause your let go (and they say)
You never learned nothing
I never learned a thing
You never learned nothing
I never learned a thing

[Monoxide]
Don't look out the window before you jump
And pump the shotgun before you *shot*
Place the poison inside of that cup and drink up
Now do us a favor when you end it all
Make no mistakes and don't make a phone call
Just write your last words in blood on the wall
And we can read it all aloud when the curtain falls

[Jamie Madrox]
Can't turn somebody who wants to die
Into somebody who wants to live a lie
And if living a lie is such a bad bad thing
Why the goody goody's always got a cynical grin?
Why they worried about us and our dark dark ways
The preacher got a Superbowl ring, he getting paid for sure
Spend it on a hooker and blow
And blow his own brains out on the hotel floor

[Hook]

[Monoxide]
Trigger happy, I never was too good with aim
So I always missed my brain
And I can always be fixed again
So I will try to begin the end from inside
Deep inside my mind and I tried
Crashing into friends with my ride
But in the end they all died and I'm still alive
Now I cut and chop every organ that I got
And I hung myself twice and it still couldn't stop
This beating in my chest going boom boom boom
And I'm hoping that it's over real soon
I did a balloon the size of a basketball
Full of amphenol fumes, it was like perfume
As I'm writing this letter I'm thinking it'll be better
If I let 'em remember the reason I'm returning to sender

[Hook]
