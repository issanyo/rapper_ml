[Intro: Eric North/MISOGI/Cxrpse/Hush]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse: Eric North/MISOGI & Hush & Cxrpse]
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
It's ridiculous
It's been months
And for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this
(Enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you

[Hook: Chris Vayle/MISOGI & Eric North]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Verse 2: Hush & MISOGI]
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason

[Hook: Chris Vayle/MISOGI & Eric North]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Bridge: Eric North/Hush/Cxrpse/MISOGI]
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

[Hook: MISOGI & Eric North]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Outro: Eric North/MISOGI/Cxrpse/Hush]
So why can't I turn off the radio?
So why can't I turn off the radio?
So why can't I turn off the radio?
So why can't I turn off the radio?
So why can't I turn off the radio?
So why can't I turn off the radio?
So why can't I turn off the radio?
So why can't I turn off the radio?
