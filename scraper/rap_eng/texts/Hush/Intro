[Intro: B.G.]
Its bout dat time, believe it

Oh yeah, we bout to do it.. its bout dat time
Its bout dat time, look I went back in V.L
With my dawg Ziggly, you heard me?
And we ??? down like real niggas exposely down, check it

[Verse 1: B.G.]
In 93 I hit the scene first album True Story
I was psyched off geto boys no nuts no glory
Then I bounced back wit the classic Chopper City
Had every nigga in new orleans rolling with me
Then I shook back with that fuckin Volume One
Real street niggas was respeccin how it come
Then I doubled back with that fuckin Volume Two
You know the name of em it was All On U
A minute after that was Chopper City In The Ghetto
I could'a came harder i kept it a lil' mello
I went to jail came home dropped Checkmate
And made it official B.Gizzle ain't fake
Left Cash Money hit em upp wit Livin Legend
Had to bust a move baby was doin to much reppin
Now im back again ain't a damn thing funny
This album number eight Life After Cash Money
