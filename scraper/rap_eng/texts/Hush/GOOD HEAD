[Chorus]
Na-na-na, you got a good head on your shoulders
You got a good head, you got a good head

[Verse 1]
I saw heaven when you were on top of me
You were riding so good, the climax ain't stopping me
Do you remember when you said I wasn't your type?
Now it's regular that you hit me late night
I'm here for a while before I'm headed home
All my real people hit my phone
By the ocean breeze is where I stay
I need these trees to make it through my day
So what you tryna do?
What you tryna do?
It's just me and you, and you got a good head on your shoulders
What you tryna do?
So what you tryna do?
It's just me and you, and you got a good head on your shoulders
You got a good head on your shoulders
You got a good head on your shoulders
You got a good head, got a good head
Here we go
You can link up with me after my show
I can take you wherever you wanna go
I know there is a lot you wanna know
You know I'm low-key, I don't boast
But first we gonna smoke on this dro
Cruising through the hills, we ride slow
No, I ain't never, ever worry 'bout a hoe

[Chorus]
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like no, no, no
Na-na-na-na-na, you got a good head on your shoulders
You got a good head on your shoulders
Na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
I just got a new phone
What's your number?
I'll call you up
I seen you out here working
Making paper, that's what's up
I know you're feeling good
You got that henny in your cup
It's late, I gotta chill
I'm 'bout to roll another blunt
She always all up on me
Every time I come around
She then gets on her knees
And she proceeds to hold it down
I'm here for the night
You better catch me while I'm in town
Then I flipped the rover
And I hit it on the ground

[Outro]
You got a good head
You got a good head (you got a good head)
You got a good head on your shoulders
I don't know why you would mess with a guy like me
I'm about to make you wifey
You got a good head on your shoulders
You got a good head (you got a good head)
You got a good head
You got a good head
You got a good head
I'm going to make you wifey
