[Chorus]
Mon amie, mon amie, mon amie
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie
She wanted me, wanted me, wanted me
Huh mon amie
Mon amie, mon amie, mon amie
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie
She wanted me, wanted me, wanted me

[Verse 1]
All my homies riding, we never gon' [?] up
We just making digits, we counting that cheese up
You were never really with her, you were rolling the weed up
Now you claim your mans are hard, but you gon' never meet up
I just want the money, the power and all that
Moving on my ones 'cause you niggas are all whack
I won't quit it 'till I get it, your mandems should fall back
Now she tryna call me, but she ain't getting no call back
Yeah, try me
I was looking for you but you were right behind me
Now I think I might get you right beside me
All my diamonds cheer you up because they shiny

[Harmonizing]

[Chorus]
Mon amie
Mon amie, mon amie, mon amie
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie
She wanted me, wanted me, wanted me

[Verse 2]
She Madonna
I won't tell you switch the henny for the water
I can slide, maybe kick it if you wanna
I think I know you're kinda down, down, down
She Madonna
I won't tell you switch the henny for the water
I can slide, maybe kick it if you wanna
I won't lie, I think I know you're kinda down, down, down, down
Now I'm gone
And I never even touched marijuana
I heard that the block is getting like a sauna
I'm a king maybe you can be my crown, now, now, now
I heard that you getting on the wave
Pull up to my house [?]
You won't know what to say
I know that I make you feel a way
Come here I want you right now

[Chorus]
Mon amie, mon amie, mon amie
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie
She wanted me, wanted me, wanted me (come here I want you right now)
Mon amie, mon amie, mon amie
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie
She wanted me, wanted me, wanted me (come here I want you right now)

[Outro]
Mon amie, mon amie, mon amie
She wanted me, wanted me, wanted me
Mon amie
C'est la vie, c'est la vie, c'est la vie
She wanted me, wanted me, wanted me (come here I want you right now)
