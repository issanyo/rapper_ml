Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it

{Verse 1]
Check it all I need is a second to wreck it
I'mma going to give you what you want
I'mma promise I won't front
I got the funkiest flavour, that'll be fat man forever
With the range of a guage in the hands of a nigga
I'm strapped with the funk of a forty year old diaper
Tha niggas nationwide so if you move my skills will snipe your
I bomb on MC's as they exit the womb
I'm the evil man so call me Dr Doom

{Hook]
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
All I need is a second to wreck it
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it

[Verse 2]
When it comes to being true to hip hop I'm the most down
And who the hell is saying mo-town is a ghost town
If thats the case I'm just a ghost bitch flying around
I ain't dying physically I ain't dying of sound
You represent it. Till it can't be represented no more
So step aside. and let a real rapper represent us you hoe
You throw your fists up while I straight up knock it out the park
So many rhymes on my brain I have the stretch marks
You be hitting home runs like you buntin
And while you be test buntin I won't stab you in your back
I go straight for your neck hunt
This country only loose so let me go collect it
You bitch ass disrespect it
You bitch ass nigga check it

{Hook]
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
So check, check it, check it, check it
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
So check, check it, check it, check it
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
Mic check one, two. Mic Check one two
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
Mic check one, two

{Verse 3]
Mic check one two
The Hush is like a ride on the rapture I capture
Raw like the real, you rough like a seal
Rivalry on wax for tracks you can't steal
Enter wax crews prove whack I fly you head like batman
I'll return and burn butter till it melts
Pain to your gut like kaopectate
If traitor track slay demonstrated with the ill mate
Live it like dirt, squeeze mikes till they hurt
Leave your fame crew like burnt
Hey you Champ grab the stiletto
The fellas with ill flow and raw ass raps snaps
Like tie straps, that will go through your chest like caps
Time lapse I got grasp but you got to grab a little bit more
Once my foot's in you door, the more I feel sore
From fake shit going flowing on
Like marty puting rotting to the core

Yeah and it don't stop
Straitjacket records
Representing hip hop
Yeah and it won't stop
I said Yeah and you don't quit
Cause Champtown and Hush kick the real shit

{Hook]
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
So check, check it, check it, check it
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
So check, check it, check it, check it
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
Mic check one, two. Mic Check one two
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
Mic check one, two
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
So check, check it, check it, check it
Check it, all I need is a second to wreck it
So check, check it, check it, check it

Hwah!
