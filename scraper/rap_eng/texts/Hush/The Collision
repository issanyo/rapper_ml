[Intro: Hush]
Ladies and gentlemen
Put your hands together
Shut the fuck up
For the dopest 17-year-olds to grace the hip hop scene
Ever


[Verse 1: Leo]
At this minute in time
I be spittin' this rhyme
From the slime, seven four, fifty plus five
Legitimate I'm, the child of gold
With no relation to Midas though
I'm ought to go
Harder than iron ore or diamonds
With these rhymes kid, its only right that I acquire dough
Cause really I pack the nicest flow
Ice as cold, Freeze...
No really, my lyrics tight as those
On the torso's of ballet folks
And round they go, like the merry go
Its a scary thought
My flow causes floods similar to when the levee broke
Grab a boat, and a coat infact
Cause L-E-O's colder than an eskimo's habitat


[Verse 2: Hush]
I'm hot, hot, I'm a burning furnace
Self proclaimed anti-lame know you gotta learn this
I burn this straight out of Satan's own burn list
They know I've got that drive they couldn't get past their learner's
For certain its daredevil
Devil wouldn't dare
I could swear I been everywhere you ain't never there
Nigga why would I ever care?
Never fair, I'm a burning stove you a polar bear
Warning: listening causes heat rash
Please repeat that to the devil
Michael Jackson couldn't beat that
Bring the streets back
Know they need that
I'm in here for a while darling kick your feet back
Blow. That's what I'm bout to do
Plus they know on a certain goal
Cause its Hush, Sahara Desert flow
Fuck you if you don't like this
Internalised degrees, you know its Hush and Leonidas


[Hook: Hush & Leo]
Ayo warm air rising, cold air sinking
This is what happens when warm and cold air's mixed kid
Cyclones terrorising the mic'phone
And leave your mind blown, like the horns


[Verse 3: Hush]
I'm cold, cold, colder than a winter's breeze
Reason behind sore throats reason why the winter freeze
Been a fiend
Around me, boy the heat's lost
Rappers rapping about ice I put bitches on defrost
I'm the reason Mobb Deep released Shook Ones
I'm the reason [?] Order more shook son
I'm the reason fake weaves singing confusion
Got that fuck you attitude you just prostitution
Rebel, a snow man couldn't get on my level
I tell them, bitch I'm where dead souls travel
Misfits, reason behind them, humans exist
Colder than finding out that Santa doesn't exist
Its Hush, you know that, Iceland flow
I'm a disaster, what's that? Ice man flow
You know, we bout to blow, fuck you if you don't like that
So its L-E-O boy show 'em that its like that


[Verse 4: Leo]
Yo, this ain't no circus act but fact is I'm the fire spitter
Spyro's bigger, brother hover above the city when I'm lifted
Pissed? Shit, inferno out my nostrils
Bitch I'm the dragon
Challenging me might cost you
You'll get burnt in a manner far worst than putting your hands on a hot stove
Mama should have told you so
I spit that molten gold flow
Far from your Average Joe blow
But close to dope though
Smoke? No, you'll fuck around and O.D only on the vocals
Or your, brain won't adapt to such hot rap on a track you'll collapse


[Hook: Hush & Leo]
Ayo warm air rising, cold air sinking
This is what happens when warm and cold air's mixed kid
Cyclones terrorising the mic'phone
And leave your mind blown, like the horns
