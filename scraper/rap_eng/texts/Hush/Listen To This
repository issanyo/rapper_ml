{Verse 1]
Born and raised in Fairport east side of Detroit
Just so you other city's out their get my point
I'm from Motown where the city that be making the moters
Where the hardest of the hardest, gotta watch over their shoulders
I'm from the westside, the fresh side, the best side
Bugs be bugging being taking out by the pesticide
I got partners that be lounging out on Jefferson
Death on the trigger and Iv never been deafer sense
And sense I'm from Detroit I got to represent my city right
The hustler's the hijacker's and the pistol packers
We don't stop, we dont quit, we out for them ends n shit
Ooohhhh We don't stop
I say aaahhhhh we don't quit
Ooohhhh We don't stop
I say aaahhhhh we don't quit

(Verse 2)
I recall when I was younger I had the hunger for being a ball player
Became just a player, small time hustler, don't trust you
I'll stand up crush you, I'll bum rush you when it comes to my money
Ain't too much funny, now I be rock it out the socket for fat pockets
We be slaming in your face and your tallest man can't block it
So stop it, at ten I was causing crew damages
With see through paper freestyle's on I gave you free sandwich's
He shine n bust a beat box and I bust a flow
He crate me paper's through your town for my nigga's show
I said ooohhhh and it don't stop
I say aaahhhhh and it don't quit
