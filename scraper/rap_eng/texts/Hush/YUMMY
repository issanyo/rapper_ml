[Chorus: HUSH]
Smart girl, but that booty going dummy
Out here throwing kiwi, green money
Looking at me like she wanna love me
Looking at me like she want that honey

[Verse 1: Ollie Joseph]

She ain't a dancer
But I threw a couple hunnid
She threw it back
Impact caused concussion
It’s too fat
Suffocation my comeuppance
Stuff that booty in them pants
Like you reloading a musket
Girl you fire
I might have to come bust
See the racks, make her blush
She in love, I had a hunch
If you wan' be treated right, I'm the plug
Jewelry jumpin, Jackie Chan with the stunt, yeah
Smart girl, acing all them classes
Good too, not naked on camera (yuh)

Saw you from the captains lounge of the cruise ship
Like, "who dis?"
I need you to be my new chick (ollie)

[Chorus: HUSH]
Smart girl, but that booty going dummy
Out here throwing kiwi, green money
Looking at me like she wanna love me

Say you play the field but we both know that won't last
Can you please just stop the tape (OOoo!)

Get you a cake now and another cake too
All around the world where I wanna take you
Ain't got a lot of money but I gotta make do
Life bittersweet but it's good with you
Ima take you on my tours
Champagne bottles of course
Insta models get ignored
I ain't ever gettin bored
You a cutie pie

Fuck all of their haters life is sweet when it's just you and I
A bite of you a day
Gonna keep them docs away
You give it like a buffet
And it goes all damn day
