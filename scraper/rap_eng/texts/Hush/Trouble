[Verse]
I poured it back until I couldn't stand
I put a hundred on the bed and a drink in my hand
Twenty to one, I win a couple grand
I’m puttin' food upon the table like fuckin' man

I poured it back until I couldn’t stand
I put a hundred on the bed and a drink in my hand
Twenty to one, I win a couple grand
I'm puttin' food upon the table like fuckin' man

[Buildup]
And here we go, taking all the ball
Take it off, I'm the commander
It's time to roll
The clocks strike, it's our time, let's get it

[Drop]
Switch
Let’s go
Switch

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Buildup]
And here we go, taking all the ball
Take it off, I’m the commander
It's time to roll
Let’s fucking go

[Drop]
Here we go
Let's go
