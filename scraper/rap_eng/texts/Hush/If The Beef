[Intro]
(Last night I went to sleep in detriot city)

[Verse 1]

Yo yo ahh
Have your guns drawn, biting my shit like wonton
You think your gone like carying boxs of calgon
Like I wet a lawn you soak up my flows like tampons
Phenomenons, five fingers of deaths like pentagons
Don corleone like the john or teflon an ex con
I'm blowing up spots like pipe bombs
A python I'm striking like snakes in amazons
Prank calling telethons saying my name is Bill Bonds
I like to lay a princess like the one from alderaan
Get a record deal and when my brothers are out I put em on
Whack MC's need to cut it out like coupons
Or get hit with criminals in stretch car yukon's
You like the way I hit you with my special lexicon
Everybody sing along if you know in unison
You know I can't stop cause I only just begun
Try to bite my style but their is no comparison
Like the meat call venison or the one on skeleton
Till my flavors on a roll like the on called Cinnabon
Had some extra baggage so I had too jetson
Know I hope my label treats me like a foster son
Got so many styles upon on the track like marathons
Trying to stack chips like the road to Babylon
You can't compete I feel for you like Chaka Khan
Infrared got on your head like cyclones
Peeping toms get rid of bullets like Washington

{Hook]
(If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
If the beef between us, we can settle it
If the beef between us, we can settle it
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
If the beef between us, we can settle it)

[Verse 2]
See me catching wrecks like accidents on autobahn
Avoiding whack MC's at any cost like pylons
Fake rappers stretching the truth like nylons
I'm sick of people rapping about clothes or write signs
I wish I had enough to keep the lights on
I'm an icon I'm bucking the ear off like Tyson
Da Rucks steals the pain like the drug called darvon
?????????????????????????????????????????
Their skating on thin ice like Michelle Kwan
They need to get a job like ????????????
A foul section 8 unemployed like a bagabonds
A liaison united Detroit like ??????????
An angry DJ breaking records with Lynn Swann
Picking up fresh in a whip Cadillac ????????
Tinted out switch yourself out ???????????
Better then the rest so you can say I'm a more on
Battle anyone at any port like Huron

{Hook]
(If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
If the beef between us, we can settle it
If the beef between us, we can settle it
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
If the beef between us, we can settle it)

[Verse 3]
You grab a badge and the gun
Drink the beer and crush the can
Be nervous cross the point
You still wouldent be the man
Dont waste you breath trying to slam jams
My lyrics are foul mother fuck the chosen one
I'm the golden child you whack as fuck
You must be part of ????????
The only MC you going to eat was in alphabet soup
Your whole style is encased in a bomb shelter
So why bother showing up your never going to blow up
You said some shit that people thought was so amazing
When asked to do it again you act dried up like a razor
I'm going rip shit so hot I'm going to stand beside a tailor
Then beat all of you all like Shaq on track trailer
Bring on superman and three ???????????????????
I got a kryptonite watch dyed yellow and gun to freeze gas
Peace to all MC"s and hip hop singers
Diss and we gunna ball like guest on Jerry Springer
You talk shit and I'mma blast you kid
Then I'm going to pose like my substitute did
You rugged you rugged as a babys boot
Take me out please you better ????? like Judy
You hard? You hard as Ross Simons you rival me
Your hard as ??????????????
Fuck you bitch call the cops while you mumbling
The only reason I stuck the store up I was try help you get open
Kill that noise I'm going to have you all upon the muzzle
I'm going to rip the stage to pieces and have you hoes puzzled
I'm not an alcoholic but I still rocking with the best
Stupid MC's I'll snatch the S off your chest
I'm a rhyme writer not a freestyler I got you stressed

[Hook-Outro]
(If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
If the beef between us, we can settle it
If the beef between us, we can settle it
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
If the beef between us, we can settle it)
