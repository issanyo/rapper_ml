(B.G. Talking)

[Verse 1]
I was born 1980 September 3rd
Thats the day checks come out and vics gets served
So you know I got the blood of a hustla in my vain
My daddy had 3 brother that all gave me some game
They was raised in the projects I was born in the hood
I was raised on the block my mom did what she could
Always got what I need sometimes I got a lil mo
But I grew up watching g's on the set gettin dough
I made b's n c's up in to 5th grade
It went to d's n f's cuz I didn't want to behave
I was the class clown Christopher raise hell
I show my dick to them hoes and I get expelled
Yeah I get punished I was supposed to be inside
I snuck out the back round the school fo lunch time
The police spotted me id break out and run
Make em run behind me that was my way of having fun
Somewhere in 87 might of been 88
I knew of Baby and Slim we was from round the same way
They moved a lot of weight but I ain't gone tell it all *shhh*
I'm a cut this part short cause my mom's was involved...

[Verse 2]
You can put it together it was what it wasn't
Not cakes to be baked, but she had cakes in the oven
She told me if I touch it that id fuck it up
If I knew what I know now i would of took it n cut it up
92 roll round thats when it got real
My daddy got set up kidnapped robbed and killed
Cash Money Records was started that same year
Thats when my thuggin started I was gettin it how I live
My moma needed help I was outta control
The streets took me under I was on a dead end row
The hood barber stand knew Baby and hit him up
Told him I had skills he needed to peep me up
He did that snatch me him Slim and Fresh was feelin me
Took me to studio from that we made history

[Verse 3]
In the mid east of that I was doin my thang
And I met this four foot hustla they called him Lil Wayne
That was my lil nigga called my lil brotha
Baby drew a cross between us but I still love him
Universal up to deal we went to get mills
Thats when nigga decided to not keep it real
I had a idea I didn't want to believe it
I wouldn't thought of it in a million years he'll do that to Geezy
I had a dope habit
That monkey was on my back
So he turned his back but look how I shookback
You know how it go you get up when you fall
The streets all over they rooted for the underdog
I got Kizzle I got Snipe I got Gar on my team
And I got click of niggas ready for war on my team
From Detroit to Atlanta Texas and Nashville
Play if you want and you see how the gat feel
That was all in my past L.T. dog I miss ya
Its Uptown 4 life Chopper City Records the official
