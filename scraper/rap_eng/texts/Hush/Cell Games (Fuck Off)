[Verse 1: Kidd Solo]
Realest nigga
I'm factually bout that action killa
Jack The Ripper
Terrorizing strippers
Never tip em
Come and get her
Stumbling over verses
Topsy turvy lyricism
Ponochio rappers
Take this truth serum
Lemme hear em
I'ma make you fear it
Ain't no super hero
This ain't movie shit
Ain't no Rob DiNero
Off the green
I'm smoking shego
She gone tell a nigga that she love me
Word
That's a good one

[Verse 2: Kidd Solo]
Illest for a minute
My sickness demented
Tools of destruction invented
Fire from heavens of dead men
Walk on the surface relentless
Fearless came for a purpose
Who sent them
Different
Village dementors
Swallow your mentors
Kill off the room in a sentence
Get them
Send off a message
We came for blood who'll address us
Pills and a tool on the dresser
Sorry for those who might tempt me test us
Leave no succesors
Charge into battle
Saddled up on a throne of ashes
Ample warriors with me get trampled
Handle business you get dismantled uh
Catch a destructo disc
Flip shit bitch stay off my list
I need some heat on my hip
I need a beam in my fist
Gimme a reason to live
That's like lean and a spliff
