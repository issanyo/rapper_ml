[Intro]
(From the bottom to the top. From the bottom to the top
From the bottom, x4
From the bottom to the top, I rise to the top. x7
I'm the cream of the crop I rise to the top.)

[Verse 1 ] [Champtown]
From the bottom to the top
From the top not a pop
But a hop could shock a german giffer
Like myy ohh, IIIII gooo
Three peep black
Then my breathing go myy ohh
I practice this. I'm mack at this
Your whack at this, so back off this
Your on team with the giffer
If he ever try to lift'er, out in the end bust a rib
We got the skills that are sharp as a tack to an ass
Got more guts than a fool like fighting glass
And glass will cut your ass
An boy I will cut you worse
Than glass will cut the Brady loose
Cause we messed up the last hill
You know were not mad still
But yo I got  mad skill
If it wasn't for me you'd ask still
The top starten to weaken so we keep on at em
And soon the top wll fall to the bottom

[Hook]
(From the bottom to the top, I rise to the top. x7
I'm the cream of the crop I rise to the top)

[Verse 2] Champtown
From the bottom to the tip of the top
My record is the ship to the top
If we go pop we still be straight up hip hop
See pop is for the pop-alar that is a abbreviation
I got much love for my radio and tv stations
Just because they play mine, they don't give you no crop
Dont go call me a sell out bitch
Turn on a man and you better be looking out
Straight up hip hop and supostu mean you flop when you sell
If you sell your a sell out then i'm sellin well
What do that make me cause thats crazy
What do you think you could say to break me
No matter what you sayin you messed up my props son
The payings just the ask to me, you got one I got one

[Uncle Ill]
I'm feeling funky and let me on the mic and let me get it kicking
The illest need no home to relive with picking
Nah not chicken I never run from a turkey
You step off with problems your liable for more

[Champtown]
Were giving hard time for sucker mc's
Cause they don't make sauce like D's

[Hook]
(From the bottom to the top, I rise to the top. x7
I'm the cream of the crop I rise to the top)

[Verse 3] [Uncle Ill]
Now I don't smoke this weed blunt
But come blunt don't front or loose front
Faggot leave you ripped and ragged

[Champtown]
We be ripping your ass like it's supostu be ripped up
You tryna tip a strippa, your ass in encrypted

[Uncle Ill]
I'm hip cause I hop to the bop
To the tour, see the fog from the boom
Leave and linger like perfume
I'm pumping call me rocky cocky rocky
I'm a take your job and knock you off your block see

[Champtown]
Well your just another rapper out of the rap
With all the other rappers that rap
You talk about pealing caps
Boy you neck get snapped
Eastside of Detroit thats where I represent
Like I cut a tree your ass get left to sticks

[Uncle Ill]
Well when the going gets tough yo I scuff with the ruff
Hit em hard with my stuff make there mouths get stuffed

[Champtown]
You need a medical alert, like the radio and tv "I'm falling

[Champtown/Uncle Ill]
And you ain't getting up

[Hook]
(From the bottom to the top, I rise to the top. x7
I'm the cream of the crop I rise to the top)

[Verse 4] [Champtown]
Its the public access so if you records all that
Now if you rap like you rap I want you act like you yaks
Not a critic or groupie have no not telling at all
Thats actin like a bitch hoping we take a downfall
Yall I'm the fallen not the fallen down
So if you followed us before
You know this record is all around
We started from the bottom and made it to the top
So we staying in the top and we never hitting the bottom

[Hook-Outro]
(From the bottom to the top, I rise to the top. x7
I'm the cream of the crop I rise to the top)
