[Verse 1; Doctur Dot]
Niggas out here worried bout the wrong shit
Bitches out here worried bout the wrong niggas
Hit your baby mama with the long dick
Got you asking questions bout your own children
Why you always gotta fuck the vibe up
Then you wonder why nobody fuck with you
Used to fuck a girl in Carolina
Boy her life was fucking up my own vision
Revolution coming, you can bet that
Crooked cop bout to get they neck snapped
Look at God wonder where the prayers at
Look alive nigga where yo head at
Bitches love a nigga when he dang smart
Got it from my mama I can't help that
Money come with problems just the cost of doing business
I ain't worried bout it really, I expect that

[Verse 2: L$M11]
Cold world nigga bundle up
South beach in my tommy trunks
Blue pits, chevy trucks
You see the mac and you will probably duck
Said heâ€™s got Gucci brah
They ain't got no muscle cuz
They can't approach us
My money won't fold up
To all of these bitches hey wassup
Fucks with my nines if you fuck with us
Throw it up, poppin pills niggas throwing up
Poppin seals niggas pouring up
Now I got my bounce back
Head in the bathroom
Tryna make her jaw crack

[Hook]
Me and my brother like K-C and Jojo
Take you a photo, your fuck with the MOJO
Don't retweet me then I come to the show though
When you see me better act like you know though
Act like you know though
When you see me better act like you know though
Act like you know though
Take a photo if you fuck with the MOJO
When you see me better act like you know though

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
Tryina put the whole hood on the acrobatics
See a nigga living good and it's automatic
Gotta crash it make sure that he feel the static
Know can be coming around here, tryina up your status
You know you no better than maker death
So over-zealous DNA and need him pay himself over struggle genetics
When the money in my hand man its so kinetic
All this power coming from my pen I gotta be the [?]
Waking up to the same old cycles
Same key, same tune, same old high notes
I'm a young pyro on the low
So you know a nigga only need a reason not to
4-5 kids and a Monte Carlo
Backseat jumping like [?]
Seats crack burning up my naps hoe
Early looking right for the taking of your favorite side hoe
All I ever had was inhale-exhale
Now it's 15 for the haiku
13 shots not just same disciples
Rise on the ifs so that leaves the rifle

[Hook]
Me and my brother like K-C and Jojo
Take you a photo, you fuck with the MOJO
Don't retweet me then I come to the show though
When you see me better act like you know though
Act like you know though
When you see me better act like you know though
Act like you know though
Take a photo if you fuck with the MOJO
When you see me better act like you know though

[Outro]
Why you always gotta fuck the vibe up?
Why you always gotta fuck the vibe up?
Why you always gotta fuck the vibe up?
Why you always gotta fuck the vibe up?
