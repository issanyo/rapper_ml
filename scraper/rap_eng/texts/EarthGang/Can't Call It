[Refrain: EarthGang]
Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Miseducated, unemployed
Get deployed in a week
Them snatch my body and my soul was exploited for free
Now occupations getting sold, shipped and sold overseas
Can't trust nobody like at all, to make sure I'm gone eat
All I see is distractions, distractions
My life just keep flashing and I'm flashing
Blue lights get behind you and your little blood pressure start to climate up
My niggas be speaking in spirit, schooling me on timing (heh)
I went to sleep thinking them caves with spiders on my eyelids
So, so so-...so what you know 'bout shining? (heh)
Lord I've been dancing for days, hell I'm still shaking off slave
Beneath and dipped in diamonds
She claim I be so zoned and I can't leave her for one moment (heh)
Really I be so floated, carrier of these components
Of life and I still be trying to make sense of that jibber jabber
You right, I can tie this 'round my neck, floating up that corporate ladder (uh)
Whether the levels matter or realistic I'd rather be a misfit
We get it crackin', we sip, mechanic actions
But I can't call it

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

[Verse 2: Bas]
Heavy duty, Hell on Earth
We've been feeling Heavens duties
Even with these demons on us
Journey deep into atonement
Through the edges of my mind
I cannot give you my mind state
That shit like going on blind dates
I don't know how that bitch look
I could've been took
I'm keeping divine fate
Follow the lines straight, and narrow
Never been one of my fine traits
I just been living the road, I don't got no home
I cannot define safe, 'rounding the bases I live in the times
Few of my niggas is running it with me
We've been surviving and keeping alive
Thankin' you God, God's great
Give me a pond, now lakes upon us
Look at the water inside your eyes
You have been stuck in a blind state
Most of us out here just nickel and dime
Cook up a trip of the crime rate
But that's by design and we never snooze
Now I'm so awake, come step in my shoes, nigga

[Refrain: EarthGang]
Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I can see the future that we're heading (can't call it, can't call it)
I would say it's better not to tell (I never came from deep pockets)
If it's anything like this in Heaven (why can't I make a deposit?)
Maybe I'd be better off in hell (I can't call it, uh! I can't call it)
(Better off in hell)

[Interlude: Earthgang & J. Cole]
Let me get that last, that last
Let me get that last, that last
Can't call it, can't call
Can't call it, can't call
Can't call it, can't call

[Verse 3: J.I.D.]
Uh, so far I done, uh, yeah, so far I done
Okay, so far I done managed to take advantage
I set a goal and of course it ain't take off like how I planned it
Granted I want the globe and the planet where my hands is
Granted, I'm on my toes and I'm sick of standing
Sick of the bicker back and forth
The lifted pitch inside your voice
Cause I can't afford a picket fence and a porch
If I get in a pickle, I pull the pistol out my shorts
Payback on a pussy boy, so give me mines and give me yours
Give me time and let me finish to design the method
Enemy, the line, I stepped it
Point me in the wrong direction, digging in the mind connecting
Everything I ever seen, ever done, never was trying to set the gas to the fire
I prepped it
Walking in shit that I stepped in

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

[Verse 4: Doctur Dot]
Activated (Activated, activated, aw man)
Native language, middle finger
How ironic? (How ironic, how ironic, aw man)
What it take to get it when you know you got it?
How you operating when you know your calling?
Glad he raised me 'cause I know my papa wasn't sober often
I ain't judging, woo, I get high
Now I'm the best to break out and lead 285
Sticking my chest out, putting my deuce up
Losing respect for the one's you like
Back in Georgia we whip it slow
Get pulled over and you could die
Fuck the bullshit, fuck the cool shit
Grab the burner, let's use our rights
Let's get rid of these fools tonight
What a decision, what a commitment, what are the limits when you decide
Pop the moon-roof, ain't your voodoo
Hit the crib, get danky coo coo
Certified I could lead the new school
Word to Tribe, whole team is Zulu

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying (can't call it, can't call it)
Oh, I had so many days of pain (I never came from deep pockets)
Have you ever been as sad as I am? (why can't I make a deposit?)
Lord, I ask if anything would change? (I can't call it, uh! I can't call it)
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)
