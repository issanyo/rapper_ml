[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
I'm the latest phenomenon you should be hip to
Bandwagon seats goin' extinct
Don't give a fuck, don't judge if you hoein' for free
Came out the mud wink wink if you know what I mean
Inside jokes is only for the loneliest folks
Windpipe close, I know that ho, she love to get choked
Headlights can hose, bucks and doe
Before the thud and you bleedin' on the side of the road
I need to see the receipt, I need to see the receipt
I need proof, I ain't stupid but believin' in dreams
First time I ate some pussy, I knew evil was sweet
First time for you to call, I'ma dead let it ring
Leave me be, might as well take one for the team
Hot as hell on the block, scrambled eggs on the street
Good genes, whole family keep they hair and they teeth
I ain't playin' nigga, this is not the fantasy league
I'm just here to highlight my life
Fuck a gas pack, NASDAQ, get the price high
Where the cash at? tell the broke days bye bye
You's a Milhouse, you's a real sap, nice guy
Finish last, back of the traffic on the turnpike
I was a Xan addict like you 'til the last time
Now I'm expandin' how I move like the sunrise
In the tundra, no shade, hope you go blind

[Chorus]
Bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
I'm just livin' life for a living (I just do what I'm here for, you know)
I just ask God for forgiveness
Since a nigga died in the pictures
He deceased in the ride through the wilderness
Will Smith with the killswitch
I'm just gettin' lost in the melodies
Music for my niggas with the felonies
And fellas with some fellas who done left the scene
And strippers with asses, all hella queens
Ladies in corporate inhalin' green
See when it's a shortage they bet on me
And quiet time, babe that's the remedy
It's a new road I ain't been down
Mama said can't keep honest with your chin down
Couple shows for a couple pennies
But I know that they fuckin' with me
Headed home with a hell of a feelin'
And an empty stomach but I don't eat nothin'
Top Ramen to the top of the billing
Rain dance on the top of the building
Down the rabbit hole, now we go
Dog [?] castle of yogi gold
Should've stopped him but y'all couldn't kill him
Universe said I got me a real one

[Chorus]
Bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah, bah bah bah
Bah bah bah
