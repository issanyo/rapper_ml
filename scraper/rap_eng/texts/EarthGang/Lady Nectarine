Verse 1 (EarthGang)
I’m the worse kinda, kinda thing
I’m alert
Ima light
I’m alone
I was birth loud as fuck in a church
Kinda, kinda thing
Jesus Christ
I’m alive
I’m at large
I’m at risk
Ima moving target
Kinda, kinda king
Tippy toes tall
Living in the valley
In the moonlight searching for the peace
You gonna pile them up 7 in the ally
And we out here gunning, searching for the weaks
Throw a couple c’s by the creek damn
Rolling up a couple trees by the creek
Oh I think them c’s about to leak
Apathy running rampant like the plague threw streets
Who would think that I would be questioning if I should own a piece
Caught a flat
Well a niggas headed to the bank at least
I think they got me too man
A nigga scared to speak
Home is temporary and the soul is everything

Pre- Chorus (Earthgang & Marian Mereba)
I just wanna take a break from southside up to my own all means
Don’t know how to appreciate what you have placed if you miss me
Sorry If it came up salivating or chasing finer things
But I’m trying to make my way cause greater pages ain't the scene

Verse 2 (Marian Mereba)
I seen fruit flies flying over head
The shit was sweet like a honeysuckle drip drip, dripping down my leg
I know you caught it
Baby you the one the equation has been done
I saw down the plane fly back from my tour out in France
No longer a question if I’m feeling you
My hands on your chest
One thing is clear
Orange slices, my tightness, your lightness
I’m ISIS, you’re my Osiris
Hardly ever share a climate
What time zone when you draw your own horizon
Once some crazy shit comes out into my psyche
You know ima kinda cute I drop bombs like the time in Nagasaki
My intellect find equivalent plus success can make a honest women start repentin’
Shit
Never finish shit like a spoiled brat
Ima replenish yeah I wanna another sip
Like a cast, I want another grip yeah
A cast I want another grip
Mhm

Chorus (EarthGang & Marian Mereba)
I’m down you down
Let’s bounce this whatever
Ohhh
I been hella patient so tell me baby (baby)
What’s it gonna be please
I’m high you high
Thank God for the fearless
Say you tired of waiting baby
Let me taste you baby
Lady nectarine (nectarine)

Verse 3 (EarthGang)
And I ain’t scared to admit
You make my thoughts think twice and forget
Soundbites like what Tyson would spit
Ricocheted threw my mind but the vibe from my grip
I’m usually aloof, loafing
No doubt smoking windows to my soul are broken
Self-destructive but no explosion
Macaulay Culkin but my hulk is Hogan
You don’t like me when I’m angry
And you don’t like to see me creeping
And I don’t like to see you weepin
But I sees what sees cause I bes what I bes
But I A for the D’s and I O for the P’s and Q’s
You won’t believe what a dream can do
Put a feen in leisure suit
Try to cling to truth
Pretty fucking hard thing to do when the truth don’t agree with you
All I know, all I know
All I known are the bitter sweet goodbyes and filberry lows
Hey let me take a sip of your soul
Let me wet my whistle  I’ve been traveling for miles
Be a lil tipsy if you’re down
Maybe have me dripping out your mouth
Maybe have me lifting up your blouse
Maybe make a baby name him pronto and have him eating grits at my mom & ‘em house
Its whatever

I’m down you down
Let’s bounce this whatever (it whatever )
Ohhh
I been hella patient so tell me baby (baby)
What’s it gonna be


I’m down you down
Let’s bounce this whatever
Ohhh
I been hella patient so tell me baby (baby)
What’s it gonna be please
I’m high you high
Thank God for the fearless
Say you tired of waiting baby
Let me taste you baby
