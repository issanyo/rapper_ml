[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Now in me solitude
Be that Kapiti dude
Wrapping Kapiti kush
Look like Kapiti flutes
Me not to be confused
Your screws is merely loose
I send the stampede to vanish the chicken's coupe
As a young genie stressing 'bout a inner-tube
I developed inner me's
To channel up my inner blues
My big dog's life was shorter than an interlude
Still the sweetest track
I play it when I'm in the mood
Passion people be prepared to catch them 22's
And be perpetually addressed
As if you dressed up in the nude
But what a beastly nigga like me supposed to do?
And how you follow rules
And hold on to your scrotum too?

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot +  Johnny Venus ]
Man I need redemption
Nah fuck that I only need fallatio
She better keep the cadence
On what's playing on the radio
These raging hormones
Make these hoes wanna Rave Simone
Whip appeal, pistol whip ya
Peel ya skin and take ya bones
And how you suppose to lose
When they know you're overdue
You was born to wake the savage city
With these soulful tunes
What's the recipe for pleasure?
Pot of holy water boiling
Sprinkle in the devil
Drink it with the reverend

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
Standing at the edge of my dream's lap
Limitation's what we wake up to and leave the scraps
Y'all gone need an hail marry or a screen perhaps
Got the fire to fuck shit up
Silent, pilot somewhere in him
The fire to take a bullet can't be far from that feeling
It's awful of course
It's par for the course
It's par for the willing
It's all for the best
To risk all that you're given
The facts of life, more or less
When you come up where I'm living
When you come up with your cousins
A couple doors from them killers
Niggas ain't knocking for sugar
I'm staring at burning embers
My jacket full of that dank
My pockets full of them papers
These women want my lineage
I just give them a headache

[Verse 4: Doctur Dot]
It's the gospel
It's the gospel
Nigga spread the good news
What's survival
If your obstacles is harder than you?
Bitches holler better swallow or you not be the move
Mona Scott keep sucking dick
So what's the problem with you?
Honestly I done lost all of my marbles
Off of them colleges so them rap nigga politics
I ain't even apart of it
Can't believe in no nigga screaming
He smoking that loud and shit
Man Sativa or Indica
Nigga know what your product is
I don't know what went wrong
I don't know what went wrong
I used to know hella people
But know I only see clones
I used to look up at the stars
And hear them calling me home
Like what's inside me will provide me
What technology won't
Screaming fuck them other niggas
Cause we down
Spillage Village is the town that we live in
Grand wizard who is I
Who was gifted as a child
With ability to make a weeping willow crack a smile
Like why is she choosing or she down?
