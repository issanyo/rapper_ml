[Intro: Samm Henshaw]
Oh yeah, ah

[Verse 1: Samm Henshaw]
Mama said we in the church
You best believe this ain't no hotel
Rocking your halo like a snapback
'Cause you hang with ghetto angels
She told me they won’t catch you when you fall
You know this ain't gon end well
Heard somebody shot the sheriff
If its you, I ain't gon' pay bail

[Pre-Chorus: Samm]
She says, "Good morning, wake up, wake"
"Good morning, wake up, wake"
"Good morning, wake up, wake"
"Wake up, wake"

[Chorus: Samm Henshaw]
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wake up, wake up, wish I could hear you right now
Somebody come and tell this lady cool down
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Samm Henshaw]
Papa said to be a man
Best keep your word until the final days
Said if you sign up you’ll be covered
See, my church don’t take no holidays
He said I’ll drop my anchor in the storm
Until your tears leave the waves
Don’t walk these streets looking for beef
'Cause Hell's an oven with a cold flame

[Pre-Chorus: Samm Henshaw]
She says, "Good morning, wake up, wake"
"Good morning, wake up, wake"
"Good morning, wake up, wake"
"Wake up, wake"

[Chorus: Samm Henshaw]
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wake up, wake up, wish I could hear you right now
Somebody come and tell this lady cool down
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
Yeah
Granny told me when you get ya blessings
Church want 10 percent
They had ya back when you was down, don't forget
Hold up, wait
Holy Ghost bullet ricochet, we took some time to pray
When I'm in the streets today, make the devil stay away
(Stay away, away, away, away, away)
Ain't gotta fake
But you blockin' all your blessings when you lyin' bout your age
I can feel the spirit moving when I'm lighting up the stage
Who listening when you pray? It just depend on your taste

[Verse 4: Johnny Venus]
She said
Tell me where you running
When that kitty ain't as warm as it was
I don't care who you praying to
I just pray you believe in you
See what you seek is underneath
That kingdom coming, make them scream
Amen from the congregation, I need a spray tan for my **** Jesus
And when they ask me where I'm headed, Hell or Heaven
Seat belts fastened, straight to Mars, look at God!

[Pre-Chorus: Samm Henshaw]
She says, "Good morning, wake up, wake"
"Good morning, wake up, wake"
She says, "Good morning, wake up, wake"
"Wake up"

[Chorus: Samm Henshaw]
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I don’t want to wake up)
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I don’t want to wake up)
Wake up, wake up, wish I could hear you right now
Somebody come and tell this lady cool down
Wake up and get yourself to church
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
