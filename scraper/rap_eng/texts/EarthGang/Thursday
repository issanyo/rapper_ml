[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Okay, shout out to my nig' Robin Williams
Out there mobbin’, I wish I was robbin’ with ya’
Kama-kama-kamkazi copy up your picture with me
I know I know y’all can’t stop me, keep a copy copy nigga
Sitting at the kitchen table cutting copies for a living
Don’t get caught meditating when they coming up the building
Kundalini lovin’ [?] chopping up the ceiling
Promised I won’t go there but what a wonderful feeling
My comfort zone surrounded by lions, bound with temptation
While I’m sitting idle, I rule all you idols and blunts and then face ‘em
Pussy hanging out the edge of my face
Off the ledge, legs swangin', drug induced serenades
She probably drown off her own freaky thoughts in one day
If I ain’t call out her name, girl ain’t you due for a race?
I took a bite out her forbidden juicy juicy, now it’s drippin’ down her petals
Threw my head back cause I’m due for some rain

[Hook (x4)]
So delightful, so delightful
I can see the whole world with my eyes closed

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
Pull a trigger, kill a nigga, he a hero
'Pac told me that when I was 7 years old
And I ain’t like you rappers tryna be the sequel
I’m tryna put a child of mine in God’s vagina
Honestly I’m like the urban dalai lama floatin’ through the city
With a zipper some exotic, yeah I’m privy to the prophecy
I chuckle in my stomach, I'mma make you niggas vomit
I'mma make the whole planet reconsider where the sun is
J.I.D. in the back if you wonder where the blunt is
Squids on attack, they just wrap you up for nothing
Appetite on a hunnid’ and I’m feeding off my hunger
Don’t you ever call me conscious, bitch I’m always in pyjamas
I despise when a nigga show himself to be a coward
I be fried, but I never be the one to be devoured
Shorty sweared to god she loved me, til I toss her ass a towel
Like the ubers outside, wash your face before you bounce bitch

[Hook (x4)]

[Outro]
Somebody out there creeping
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Somebody out there lurking

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Somebody out there creeping

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Somebody out there lurking

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
I'm tryna keep my freedom

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Somebody out there lurking

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Somebody out there creeping

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Y'all looking way too nervous

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
I'm tryna keep my freedom

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Somebody out there lurking

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Somebody out there creeping

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Y'all looking way too nervous

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
I'm tryna keep my freedom
