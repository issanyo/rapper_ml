[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Don’t blink
I need you focused
Patterns of your mind are designed like them clouds in the sky
Fine like them Ethiopians
No matter how I try, just can’t seem to get a hold of you
Met her in the darkness, palms stretched
Pitch black tryna find our way back
Hit that, then a shiny light appeared
Sounds from the city started rising
Woke up in a flat on 135 and
Yo ass, got a nigga vibin'
Watching old movies
Do me
Fuck me
Make me feel good
Never felt like this, don’t really think I should
It’s funny how you never listen to me
Hard-headed, Well until you’re in my bed
Then that’s a different story
I'mma hit it till the universe cracks and the stars start pouring
Teach you how to make a couple bullets out of that
Then leave you with my gat
Cause I know they all boring
I’m just a dream in the flesh
God’s little mess, a cosmic address
Truth is a nigga hard to impress
It’s gone take a lot more than red bottoms and a dress
An ankh around your neck hanging down to your breast and you hollerin’
Talking bout how much you love to smoke sess
Arrest that man he fresh, put him on the spot
Elliot Ness that man, put him on the clock
Two ticks left and they done threw that man the rock
Now watch the beat drop

[Hook: Marian Mereba]
Who are you outside knocking on my door, what you knocking for
I was floating high now you share my skies, orbiting my mind
And now I see you, and I can’t shake you, can’t erase you at all
Ooooooh, thoughts are racing, can’t escape them no how
Ooooooh, in time and space you've got me chasing your love
Ooooooh, up here’s no gravity, feel free to follow me
And now I see you, and I can’t shake you, can’t erase you at all
Ooooooh, thoughts are racing, can’t escape them no how
Ooooooh, in time and space you've got me chasing your love
Ooooooh, up here’s no gravity, feel free to follow me

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
For the longest, I thought you wasn't real
I thought my mind finally snapped
So many bitches living just to fuck with a nigga
Figure my mind made you up just so I can relax
And then you spoke
And my imaginary friends can’t talk so uh
Lucy boo you got some ‘splainin' to do
Won't you bring that Juicy Fruit and get to banging the boots
And we ain't even speaking English, body language will do
Punchanella and shoe
Need umbrella for you
Let’s play a game, try to make a hurricane in yo cooch
Hard to contain
Contain me when I’m hard and I’ll take apart your brains, pussy throbbing
Blood rushing through your arteries and veins
Now ain't that peachy now ain't that grapey
Let’s get some leafey and get to baking like Egyptians
Hieroglyphic lifted
Don’t believe in science fiction
But you see the pyramids so you believe somebody built them
I’m known for leaving stable women tilted
And I ain't eating in between her legs gefilte fishing
Nah really i’m just being silly
That’s what she like about a nigga though
Opera house, Figaro
You at the point in ya life
You realize, you've been lying to yourself, lying with the wrong guys
All these lions in the den got you looking at the sky
Like God why these lip lickers only looking at my thighs
Probably cause you on the internets, looking for some likes
What a waste of life
And I ain't here to judge
But what a waste of life
You do this all because you ain't getting enough love from your guy
But I...I...I..I can tell
There’s a lot more to you than them bathroom photo shoots
So...So...So..So.So gimme yo bones and I can give you my bones
And we can all turn to juice

[Repeat Hook]

[Outro]

Unless you’re asking for it
I don't wanna hurt you baby, unless you’re asking for it
I don't wanna hurt you baby, unless you’re asking for it
I don’t wanna hurt you baby, unless you’re asking for it
