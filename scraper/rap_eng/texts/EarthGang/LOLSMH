[Intro]
PM
LOLSMH, here we go again
Hahahahaha

[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
Come to think of it, I've never been on sinking ship
When they hear this shit they feel like it's just me and them
Elementary, my dear, don't over think this shit
My intentions always clear when I'm here
Black magic, keep the stick, make yo ass disappear
Nigga missed the mark, but hit somebody you hold dear
Make a t-shirt, every funeral we jump up the price for the feature
Shit, heaven or hell, you never know where I see ya
I'm wit whoever got the better speakers, speak up
These drugs make it hard to listen, re-up
I do my best to show you love from a distance
And if I didn't you probably wasn't worth my attention
Politicians is the gangstas and the gangstas is the artists
And the artists is the politicians, everybody switching, real nigga shit
It's been hard to tell the difference for a minute, so we don't
Cause it's either you gon' get it or you won't
Hold you down like the do-rag
Twist it round your dome
Or the code to keep your girl from seeing bitches in your phone
I pissed away some golden opportunities from living wrong
Put a pin in that, wait, hold up, hold up, lemme pin it down
Plenty hoes make me old, but independence make me wild
Flow sicker than the nigga telling Bobby Whitney "drown"
Off the block with niggas to a label, office table
Office got you talking different, hate it all, the shit be rubbin off on niggas, y'all suspiscious

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
LOLSMH, here we go again
LOLSMH, here we go again
LOLSMH, here we go again
Even when it's said and done, it's never over with
LOLSMH, here we go again
LOLSMH, here we go again
LOLSMH, here we go again
Even when it's said and done, it's never over with

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
Smoke session with the chick, I like to call my sister
We never fucked or did no business but she check a nigga
That's what I need though
We taco 'bout the guac and chop the pico
And how I was a hostage to my ego
Tied up in that basement, forgetting names and faces
Ass 'n titties on my phone save the contact by location
If I save it at all, walk in the room
Seen the oxygen escaping from Charles
Wait, what the fuck happened?
Wait, what the fuck, cancer?
Wait, what the fuck Campbellton, what the fucking Atlanta
What the fuck with all this tragedy while I was asking?
Wait, did I really do all this damage with double standards?
Wait, why I'm I allowing these distractions?
Wait, what the fuck matters? It all depend on who you asking
Niggas' fantasies can turn them into natural disasters
Ain't no FEMA check, ain't no telethon, ain't no telling dawg
I'm bout to burn it down until I lose my skeleton

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
LOLSMH, here we go again
LOLSMH, here we go again
LOLSMH, here we go again
Even when it's said and done, it's never over with
LOLSMH, here we go again
LOLSMH, here we go again
LOLSMH, here we go again
Even when it's said and done, it's never over with

[Outro: Johnny Venus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You said you need to
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You said you need to
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You said you need to let it go, let it go, let it go
You ain't got to carry enough, no
You ain't got to carry enough, no
I said you need to let it go, let it go, let it go
You ain't got to carry it, no, no
You ain't got to carry it, no, no
I think you better let it go, let it go, let it go
Cause you ain't got to carry it, no, no
You ain't got to carry it, no, no
I think you better let it go, let it go, let it go
Put your feet back in the water, get some more
See, he gon' tell you now
Tell me what you here for
She gon' bless you now
Careful what you wishin' for
See, I been giving recompense for my decision
And I'm gon' give it all
And I've been living with the fire down within
Fighting for my inner child
And it tastes so sweet
Hearts get broken and souls get weak
Joy gon' come to those who seek
Said, hearts get broken and souls get weak
Joy gon' come to those who seek
Hearts get broken and souls get weak
Joy gon' come to those who seek
Hearts get broken and souls get weak
Joy gon' come to those who seek
Hearts get broken and souls get weak
Joy gon' come to those who seek
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
