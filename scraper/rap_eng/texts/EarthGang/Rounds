[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Can't let the past go
Crazy baby hold on for a nigga
You so optimistic guessin' that's what's wrong with a nigga
Girl no matter how they twist it I've been known for a minute
Moving strong for a million visits longer
Been dodging all this bullshit stuck inside a transit
Survival is my dance and I travel with my antics
Therefore had to pull, had to hold, had a handle
Telling you my mans when my soul was for ransom
Sitting in the darkness to squeezie up my channel
They tell you it's real, never hold up a candle
Two right to your head thats a wonder bread tandem
They said they were scared make you hold up your hand though
Shout the Boogeyman that's my only other phantom
Hundred niggas on the block man huntin' for answers
Can't tell if he count 'em
If he sign them off at random
Cause God bless the child with the hand full

[Hook: Johnny Venus] x2
Yup yup yup yup
Making my rounds that's for damn sure
Making mines count that for damn sure
Make a sound out make a dance off...
Ain't no time outs get your bands up

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
Cool under pressure my presence reflect heaven
Hope is where I'm headed, hope now twenty-seven
Mula, the motivation grew into obsession
Home is in my heart but the residence is restless
Would you rather have a soul or a necklace?
I really need both it's just expected
I really be close to my records
These my babies don't you ever disrespect them
We could go for days
Talking about originators and thieves
Only thing you should remember is your idols could bleed
No surprise if it ain't what it seem
Fuck my bitch no goodbyes catch a plane while she sleep
It's the nature of the biz
The freak of nature is me
It's safe to say we accelerating, yeah but patience is key
Erase away the fear and shame then you're basically free
I've been out making my rounds while you just waiting on me

[Hook: Johnny Venus] x2
Yup yup yup yup
Making my rounds that's for damn sure
Making mines count that for damn sure
Make a sound out make a dance off...
Ain't no time outs get your bands up

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
Making my rounds, making my rounds
Making mines count that's for damn sure
Making my rounds making my rounds
Making mines an example
Making my rounds making my rounds
Making mines count that's for damn sure
Making my rounds my rounds
Making mine in Atlanta
