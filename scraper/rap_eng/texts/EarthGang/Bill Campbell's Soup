[Intro: Doctur Dot]
See I'm nothing but trouble
But boo don't be alarmed
I'm just trying to make your palms reach the ceiling
Now I've been travelling back and forth across this world for too long
And your body got me feeling I ain't been here

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Paying bitches in quotes
Paying niggas with jokes
Baby girl that's just a half
It's ok if you choke
Your mama love me anyway sent me a plate with her vote
She told you "baby that's the devil, better grab him don't let him go"
See he a bad man but the angel ain't never go
And he gon' treat you right
But these hoes he gon' let em' know
Now go ahead hit the floor
And show me why they know your whole name round the world
Silhouette, pretty girl
Probably thinking
Why he sitting over there barely speaking
Staring through my soul at my ass barely peaking
A year ago, you and your girls were barely leaking
Now it's spilling in my lap
Pussy well, very beat
So I understand when you see the man
It's like Peter Pan
Niggas get some courage, try to skip across the median
Please stick to your side
Bragging about your shoes and your little YouTube views
Nigga, God ain't got no eyes

[Hook: Doctur Dot]
See I'm nothing but trouble
But boo don't be alarmed
I'm just trying to make your palms reach the ceiling
Now I've been travelling back and forth across this world for too long
And your body got me feeling I ain't been here
Now I got you here standing naked
Plus your arms swaying
You gon' make me take it
How long I've been waiting
Turn around, show me why that ass is the greatest
Imma beat it t'ill I hear the last song on the playlist

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
My intestines are a buzz [?]
It seems my hunger making way to much just not enough, 'nough
Fuck the D.A. and the Judge
The Grand Wizard spill it in your spirit and your blood
Hard to find reality on planet three
For these answers we sending out satellites
And for these dancers we handing out stacks of green
With a mind full of nasty things like an ashy teen
But with a enough elbow grease to put a whale through a shoelace
We working for a new day, to scenes from a movie
Dexter told me Bruh your time is coming just be cool wait
Spark the joint like juicy, mazel tov like jews say
I'm from a long line of lost causes
Who found the light like the fridge at night
Only to realize there ain't a smidge to bite
So we turn to cannibals hide your kids and wife

[Hook: Doctur Dot]
See I'm nothing but trouble
But boo don't be alarmed
I'm just trying to make your palms reach the ceiling
Now I've been travelling back and forth across this world for too long
And your body got me feeling I ain't been here
Now I got you here standing naked
Plus your arms swaying
You gon' make me take it
How long I've been waiting
Turn around, show me why that ass is the greatest
Imma beat it t'ill I hear the last song on the playlist

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
You won't need a dictionary
Just a couple pre-requisites to deal with the shit I'm carrying
Down from the mountain top
Really not the marrying type
But I love you for the rest of my life though
Jump into that icy water swim to that life boat
Oops my bad baby, you real bad baby
I would of chose but my minds been on the globe lately
So my faiths a little shaky, couldn't blame you if you hate me

[Verse 4: Doctur Dot]
Faster than the speed of an eagle with a diesel tank
Swoop down on unsuspecting prey
Now you amazon texting like each and every day
T'ill I see you face to face you've got nothing else to say
Oooh girl you make me shiver, Oooh I'm 'bout to get ya
So intoxicating, lord protect my liver uhh
But you so beautiful
With your bright skin
And your "Whats up"
And your "Alright then"

[Repeat Hook x2: Doctur Dot]
See I'm nothing but trouble
But boo don't be alarmed
I'm just trying to make your palms reach the ceiling
Now I've been travelling back and forth across this world for too long
And your body got me feeling I ain't been here
Now I got you here standing naked
Plus your arms swaying
You gon' make me take it
How long I've been waiting
Turn around, show me why that ass is the greatest
Imma beat it t'ill I hear the last song on the playlist
