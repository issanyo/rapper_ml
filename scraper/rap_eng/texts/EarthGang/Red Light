Child of the city
Oh, they knocking with me
Oh, they rocking with me
Know they fucking with me
Know they fucking with me
Red light, green light
Headlights, speed by

Child of the city
Oh, they knocking with me
Oh, they rocking with me
Know they fucking with me
Know they fucking with me

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
You know what?
I done fucked up a couple dollars too, ain't have much
All I had was the Hallelujah from Grandmama
I was ten years old, I was flippin' through the mags
I ain't never look back
Sneaking off into the store, couldn't bought it so I grabbed
Running off with the pamper stash, off the porch with just my ass
Kiss me, I'm teething
Mr. Bohemian, Missy done taught me the signature
When it get misty and through the storm
When I get tipsy and step on water
Seventeen, I thought I was God
Nineteen, I could do no wrong
Twenty-three, when I met me
Lot a work I had to do from home
Lot of naps, nigga had to snap
Broke a couple cones and couple phones
Couple rules and a couple course
Guess they had to use a different tone 'cause who the kids gon' listen to
When they, when they mama love em, diss 'em too
When they, when they daddy did a bid or two
Middle finger never get the mood
Iâ€™m a product of residual
Now I'm working out the mystical

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
[?], no prediction
Manifested, bitch you guessed it
No prescription, but the medicine is heavier than ever
Got brothers that ain't livin' to see 2011
Let alone how far we made it, but they knew where we was heading
But you know what?
Thinking back when a backwood roach came in clutch
All or nothing, all it ever was
Pass life still keep in touch, way past the point of no return
Overlooking what you overheard, I'm just feelin' out the temperature
Built the floor sleeping on the floor
What you know about taking everything you ever owned everywhere you ever go
Every stop, cutting something loose
Found my auntie brother knocked out, picked him out the pavement after school
Every casualty casual, never really matter who you matter to
