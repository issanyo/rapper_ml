[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Let me tell y’all what this must be
A couple keys wrapped under the Christmas tree
A few pan handling, black Mandarins
One off a Candler and the others off a Campbellton
Eye level they wanna see us
But it’s hard to chop a sequoia to a tree stump, with a butter knife
That shit would take an eon
I was riding down E Ponce de Leon with my nigga Keeyan
A fly girl in some Yves Saint Laurent’s
I was like ooh girl you Beyoncé, you could be my fiancée
What’s your name? She said Dion
Cool that’s unisex, I’m thinking how I can get me and you to sex
Lil jokey joke, jiddy jid, mardy mar
Never had an Audemar and never drove a foreign car
I’m just a gifted ass Georgia boy
There's a difference between gifts and talent so peep the balance
Nigga been working until his hand get calluses
Tryna eat something fatter than DJ Khaled is
Mind scrabble, dibble dabble, slam the gavel on
Travel roads, fucking hoes, probably won’t get on til I’m fucking old

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
I ripped the teeth out from under your brain, these drums is insane
I’m out of my space time continuum frame
And I had to throw my hands up, rock your head like the ninja
You couldn’t fit on this if it was wide as the pacific
I’m tired of tussling with ya’, I’m tired of bussing with ya’
Dog it’s been nuts since we was taking little rusty pictures
Fuck you niggas, step on, step on up
Take your ass right back to school now with a million paper cuts
Wake the dead up out their sleep with a message, I don’t mess
As I’m caught up in the embrace of her dreamy labias
And them freaky flow of patterns trippin’ and clappin’ at us
Really we get to act up
And we strapped up, high like NASA, so I suggest you back up
If I fell out of my head
Suspended in the lap of a real goddess
She look down while canoeing through that silver lining
Would you still try me?
With that safety on, darling would you still eye me?
Feel like the type to loan pearls out, interest Steady climbing, hide me
She gon’ have to rotate now, I miss steady shining
Yes I hit the game like Kanye head did
Heads up where the big clutch [?]
Really trying God not to miss my window
Blind sniper in the dark of the night
Back spasms for the nights you napped on
Back cracking, black boner, all up in the backbone
Stop acting, shed that skin
Pop the capsule, leave your body back home
Then bankhead bounce to the other side of life, I get my naps on
Badass shit
My skin’s a target, hard to compare that shit
If it look good on you, then they gon’ hate in a bit
Wear that shit, rule a thumb
Cowards scared as fuck to do what ain't been done
I’m just scared as fuck to show up to God with the “I ain’t done”
Look on my face I ain’t one to run in place
Trying not to pull a Drake cos it’s my first time in here
Really caught me at the fucking worst time in here
West side, so you know it’s hearse time in here

[Hook 1: J.I.D ]
So don’t you dare act like we never been here before
And your principal office been suspended before
Put some acid on your tongue, I recommended it bro
Earth, wind, fire, air bending these hoes

[Hook 2: Doctur Dot]
And don’t you dare act like we never been here before
Momma watched me, wondered where the fuck my energy go
Probably the same place where my memories go
To infinity bro, you ain’t feeling me though

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
From the land of red clay and lottery worship
Where all of these murders is definitely probably on purpose
And all the colicky children getting put out in the churches
The preacher mean, mug your momma like, swallowing words bitch
What makes a prodigy worthless?
How about taking a shitty job cause economy hurting
When you see the face of God, you ain’t gotta be nervous
Especially if in your life you tried to follow your purpose
You could’ve been a serial killer with the coolest symbol
Three razor cuts in a forehead, of a fifth victim
Illuminati, numerology, triangular prism
Pendulum swinging, maybe later I’ll be banging some bitches
Ain’t gotta explain to you niggas, we all know danger’s appealing
We all know pain’s the realest way to try to say what you feeling
It’s amazing, got malaise from my illness
And that’s a double entendre, but I don’t expect y’all to feel this
Not from the dreamy bohemian or the loopiest nubian
Got the gluteus maximus then we making a movie
Doctor D’s the definition of a perfect lunatic
That means I’ll probably fucking lose it if I catch the moon a bit
Ben Hill, southwest, where my fucking goonies live
They all a murk you from my baby brother if you fool with him
And I’m the lamest nigga in the squad and I’m like superman
So it probably would behoove you to try to be cool with them
My umbilical was cut by the horses bite
Cause I was born in a manger on the darkest night
I was born in the danger, I was forced to fight
Forced to learn the force before the night that Obi-Wan could die
A lot of dilated eyes claim to see the light
But all they ever see is seeds and saplings die
So who’s a victim, look inside
Ight

[Hook 3: Johnny Venus]
And don’t you dare act like we never been here before
Red carpet on my toes, [?] on the coal
And you can stare like a nigga never been here before
We’ll be wringing out your soul when the filling your soul

[Hook 1: J.I.D ]
So don’t you dare act like we never been here before
And your principal office been suspended before
Put some acid on your tongue, I recommended it bro
Earth, wind, fire, air bending these hoes

[Hook 2: Doctur Dot]
And don’t you dare act like we never been here before
Momma watched me, wondered where the fuck my energy go
Probably the same place where my memories go
To infinity bro, you ain’t feeling me though
And don’t you dare act like we never been here before
Momma watched me, wondered where the fuck my energy go
Probably the same place where my memories go
To infinity bro, you ain’t feeling me though
