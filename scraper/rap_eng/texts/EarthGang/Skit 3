[Skit: DC Young Fly]
Damn, I'm feelin' funny, man I'm feelin' funny as hell. Why the tree's smilin' at me? Y'all see that? Oh maybe I'm drunk. The tree's smilin' at me..  the fuck.. I don't like that bitch over there she got three titties and I don't like her.. she has three titties. I don't know.. It's starting to look pretty sexy, I like those big titties. Matter fact I don't want nobody but the bitch over there with the three titties. EarthGang!, I appreciate y'all for gettin' in my mothafuckin' car man, life is different. But I do got to tell y'all, I got a question. Am, Am I dead?
