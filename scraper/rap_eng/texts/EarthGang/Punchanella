Hopefully this is one the ones that makes Strays
Doctor Dot and Johnny Venus, we just making hella songs so yall give us a tour, whatever man whatever, just learn this shit, learn this shit

Doctor Doc:
Aw man, Punchanella in the shoe
I know hella niggas who
Lie and never tell the truth
I'm a diamond, try to bite me, you forever missing tooth
Cool as ice until I slide in then I'm melting igloo
Aw man, aw man, Punchanella in the shoe
Punch your supervisors nose
When he tell you what to do
Fuck this shit, bitch I quit
I got better shit to do
How you think this is elementary
I should be making moves

Aw man aw man, Punchanella in the shoe
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI
THC lift up my mood
Fever just hit 102
Sick as fuck, sit the fuck down my dude
Hell naw if I don't work now
Then I can't eat tonight
And the rent been past due
Aw man, aw man, Punchanella in the shoe
Make incredible the regular with everything I do
Rocking city after city
I fuck bitches by the few
It's futile so don't go against me
My energy never lose

Chorus (x4):
Aw man
Aw man
Punchanella in the shoe


Johnny Venus:
Oh my my, I can't focus I just wanna fuck and write
Oh my mind, that bitch open
Played the villain my whole life
Let's get high, punchanella
Show the beggars how to fly
Oh my my, Punchanella
Full regalia on tonight
Boy I'm glowing, I'm the shit
Lord I know you sat on this
I'm so on, I'm so on
Gravel roads to come to grips
I got problems, can't control me
Conjure them hoes up at night
Call all them hoes up at night
Ooh lawd them hoes gon' act right
All starring roles ain't that right?
Ain't that wrong. I mean really we all guilty
Don't act like, 's'ain't your song
Sing it with me, Punchanella
Scary skeletons gon' tell you bout yourself
Why you up so fucking early?
I can't lie, girl I can't rest
I'm gon' set this ho on fire
Like the letters from my ex
I ain't bitter Matthew Henson
Just almost froze while I slept
I had to think on my toes
And go toe to toe with death
Calendula for my sips
Little order for my steps

Refrain
Aw man aw man
Punchanella in the shoe
Aw man aw man
Punchanella you gon' do
Helicopters come to catch us
Punchanella tell the truth
Punchanella parachute
I'll be waitin here for you
Aw man aw man
Punchanella in the shoe
Aw man aw man
Punchanella You gon' do
Can't curtail us Punchanella
They can't tame us tell the truth
What you scared of? Punchanella
No one better than the youth
