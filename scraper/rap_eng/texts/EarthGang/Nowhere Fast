Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Hey
Ain't this a damn shame?
I look down and see my phone ring, it's my pops and I ain't even tryna answer
"What's up my, son? I ain't even wantin' that much
But how you doin', oh, tell me how you been holdin' up
Fragile contents rolling, how life been handling ya?"
Bands stand, agile movements increase your stamina
I crack a smile just to stay inside parameters
Shit, I hope he picking up the love inside my inflections
Cause lately life done got my spirit on a bench press
A ten strip a strength test, a journey to within quest
I pray to God that all the particles I ingest
Keep the heartless and charlatans out from where I get dressed
But still I keep it all together like corn tortillas or Ving Rhames leathers
From big ass galaxies to Terrio sweaters
Our fleet too familiar with stormy weathers so gon' and redirect us

[Hook: Childish Major]
Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast

[Verse 2: DocturDot]
I been in the trenches
Bottom dollar tryna turn that bitch Olympic gymnasts
When you on the come up ain't no coming to your senses
Young and struggling, ruthless and relentless
I been this for more than a minute
Unfortunately, really I'm more nigga than citizen
Love hoes with cake, she give a fork when you stick it in
Can't fade, raw diggity in my city, it's sickening on the literal sense
Killed the mood real quick
See, my life seen plenty deaths so I always feel protected
No weapon fond of projectin' will perform like you expect it
Cut off all my local hoes, I'm tryna get God pregnant
Cause all dogs go to Heaven
Pussy niggas get rejected over this way
The ghost of Rick James on mixtapes by the lame a mile away
We ain't cut from the same Kinte
Making arrangements that pay for when my kid's kids lay
Grass hoppers and senseis gather round for the big bang

[Hook: Childish Major]
Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast
Going nowhere fast

[Outro: DC Young Fly]
