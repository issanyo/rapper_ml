[Intro]
The purpose of our organization of Afro-American unity, which has the same aim and objective to fight whoever gets in our way. And bring about the freedom of these people by any means necessary

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Yeah, new Malcolm X, by any means
I learned from what I seen, had a dream
'Til it turned to a nightmare, Martin Luther the king
Without a queen, nah mean?

[Verse 1: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Nah mean, nah mean?
Still shining in front of the hood like highbeams, yah mean?
It seems, I'm as great as a god
They say I'm the bomb, I got a date with Saddam
As-salamu alaykum, wa'alaykumu as-salam
Cookin' turkey bacon but I don't pray to Allah, nah
Die for it all or live for something
Shit can get disgustin' within this discussion
Fuck it, would you risk your life for what you believe in?
The world is cold, at least you wasn't anemic
They wanna kill me mid-speech, afraid of my truth
A few real niggas left, they hate that I'm proof
My value on demand, niggas can't ignore it
And if you can't buy it twice then you can't afford it
See I'm the man of all this real shit these niggas is claimin'
They physically free, mentally livin' in cages, pray for 'em, yeah

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
New Malcolm X, by any means
I learned from what I seen, had a dream
'Til it turned to a nightmare, Martin Luther the king
Without a queen, nah mean?

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
By any means, yaddadimean?
In the coupe, my Miss Coretta Scott thing
And I swear I had a dream, I had a dream
But it was nothin' like Dr. King
I know that life is pie, I'm a tiger, I'm pissin' on you clowns
Swim in the piscine, drunk, pray to God I don't drown
I'm Mister One Dollar, ain't got a dollar in my pocket
Pick a coin out the rubble, long travel roads, I suppose
I expose myself through the music, talkin' execution
Moves I do, kick dumb flips, sommersault
Mastermind, winter killed spring then summer 'sault
Summer assault, mash words, mumble talk
I don't fumble y'all, look at me ramblin' as usual
You don't know what sixteen gunshots will do to you
Two handguns, shotgun user like
Blucka, blucka, blucka, wasn't none I could do
I was focused on the movement, wan' kill me then do it like
We can be the start and the spark of the revolution
Televised through some rebel eyes, hella uncivilized
Dangerous capable individuals and odds, uh
Man, just bring in the pallbearers
All y'all thought we stole from y'all eras
Love them people you call home, equip 'em with long feathers
And make sure they stalk my steps wherever I walk, yeah
I'm Malcolm X on the X pill
Dr. King on the jet going to Russia to go see Svetla
Hope they don't check us at the customs and the connectors
Or whatever, hope they don't check us at the customs

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
A lot of guys just overstate the obvious
Cliche niggas from colleges, ramblin' about their consciousness
If you ask me, that's exactly what the problem is
Politics and probably want a cracker' nigga startin' shit
I never beg for pardons, it's the part of lion's mafia
The horrifyin' rottin' writin' revolution army, bruh
It's a skruggle with a C or a K
Social worker on the way, you children better behave
And all the Christians want to know if I'm 5 percentin'
And 5 percenters want to know if I'm rockin' with 'em
And the Hindus want to know which past life is the beginnin'
And I'm just shruggin' my shoulders like, "My nigga, what's the difference?"
Still mass murder, I'm Nat Turner on Nat Geo
Who's lyin'? Kill a lion, wear his body like a Snuggie
Hot fresh hemoglobin warm the skin of a druggie
And all these fuckin' fakes around me all pretendin' they love me
Still any means necessary, even if it means gettin' buried
Even if it means gettin' carried by your closest friends, rockin' gloves at the cemetary
It's gon' get ugly, uh

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
New Malcolm X, by any means
I learned from what I seen, had a dream
'Til it turned to a nightmare, Martin Luther the king
Without a queen, nah mean?

[Verse 4: Johnny Venus]
Inspiration lyin' naked somewhere on vacation
Your whole crew zombies, no denominations
It's strictly observation, so why bait you?
Inflate you with my nature, put seas and extends like the makers
Won't have to primate your height and states emergencies
Against the wall, head in your knees, somehow we reached this
I know I was walking eager, something awful lies between us
Probably a siren screamer, sky was fallin' through my fingers
But you see all of these bombs playin' hopscotch so close next to you and me
It kinda got me thinkin' what is life but chuggin' ether
And lovin' people and I know that's hard for you to see
When I say you, I'm scared, I'm really just talkin' to me
I'd rather change the subject, holidays enough sweats
And great sex caused the cardiac arrest
And to make it this far we done hobbled and stepped
I done lost a few queens for these here rap checks
You follow impressed, I'm in the jungles with hacksaws
Pushin' the caravan inland for actuals
Holdin' my nuts on the cavernous as a lantern
Scramblin' for the light inside your eyes with the fist of mud
Spend my little yearly earnings on a trip to the Nile
[?] and we're searchin' for the real plug
Pray extension cord extend to Adamsville
Well shit 'bout as solid as a willow in the wind storm
Mannin' the cannons, handin' 'em deaf slips lord
Way before my time, feeling like a stillborn
Under pressure like Freddy and god bless you
If you find yourself sleepwalkin' in on our session
Or find yourself late sneakin' in on God's lesson
Like you got your homework, couldn't get the last question

[Interlude: Johnny Venus]
Excuse me, excuse me miss?
So you, you got your homework?
Couldn't crack the last question
Ma'am, ma'am
Said you did your homework, I couldn't get the last question
Damn, ma'am, please, please
Please help me out

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
New Malcolm X, by any means
I learned from what I seen, had a dream
'Til it turned to a nightmare, Martin Luther the king
Without a queen, nah mean?
