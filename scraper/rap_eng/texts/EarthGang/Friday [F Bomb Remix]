[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
When I was nearly just a yearling
Pop Pop hit me with that music
"You only get one of these, son
So be careful how you use it
And these two come with the crew
So be mindful not to bruise em'
That ego might get you through
But might not quite get through to them"
You can take a pic
Illuminati or the all-seeing Goodyear blimp
I really don't trust nobody, ain't that about a bitch
And black bodies getting bodied, arguing about a bitch
Nah it ain't 'bout a bit, and let me smoke my shit
Cause if I pass you and any of the Audis then I'm that nig
Really you can trade that in, go ahead let the trash man get it
Go ahead and pop that pussy girl
Put it in [?]
And JB, this boom shit you flipped
Man you can go ash that shit
Man, and it's funny, y'all
That pull out couch somehow fertilized my dreams
On one the gods heartbroken nights, I was scribbled on the scene
And my eyes be runny now
From the smoke I smoke and the shit my eyes done seen
It seems from somewhere in my wild hood child
Mother nature popped a bean
No telling what I'm gon' do
No telling when I'm gon' lose it
No telling who I might shoot
Be my brother, my foe or Judas
Cross my heart with the truth, so I can finally see who who is
Cross my heart with the truth, so I can finally see who you is, singin'

[Hook]
I don’t give a fuck about who
Give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face
Leave 'em looking
I don’t give a fuck about who give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face, leave em looking
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
One-hit wonder
Now it's numbers on the board, the equation kinda jumbled
You mumbled, I must've missed it
Bitch, I heard a snake hiss, coming to give them the noise
Catching homies with my boys
F bomb three times, one time for the Lord
Certainly see me hurting, I'm perching purchasing the silver
Way before the Vine had the city on tip
All that built, all that shit
Your strong report, that shit free as mine like the mental chips
Using time to see mistakes I made
And it's so much given, yeah so much gained
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, it's a daily saying
When I think you hurt, don't start complaining
Plenty hit it, perfect aiming
No it's people say they hate me
No it's crazy, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
Picking roses while they pushing daisies
Ain’t stretching yams, Benz, no Mercedes
Control the game, who the fuck’ll play me?
I don’t give a fuck, I wasn’t using luck
I don’t give a fuck, I wasn’t using luck
Bitch, I got my pistol tucked
I don't give a FUCK

[Hook]
I don’t give a fuck about who
Give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face
Leave 'em looking
I don’t give a fuck about who give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face, leave em looking
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
See, I came here with a dangerous attitude
Like a dragon mood
You can run, you can hide, but the plan is doomed
All my camera views be the action news
Couldn't defuse with granddaddy's tools
I done overcame but they ain't came up
The world is chock-filled with lame suckers
I could spot a fuck nigga at the introduction
God gave me this gift
I can see souls, I can smell fear
I can see past all the smoke and the mirrors
When the fog get thickens, I move like it's clear
Fuck the bullshit, nigga
What's a revolution if it gotta be approved by the who's who?
Too soon but I'm fresh out of fucks to give
I made lusty bitches put tongues and lips to good use
Who's the victim, that's a liar
Where's the witness, ain't it fire
Tired of these bitch ass fly-guy niggas
Can't change a tire 'til they change attire
I'm a jack rabbit, I'm a multiplier
Niggas mad that it's cold, but ignore the fire
So what you really saying, you don't do anything if it ain't on the flier
Dog, you lame as hell
Exclusive shit, what I aim to sell
Hell on Earth what I aim to be
I'm different, you different, him, her, they different
Man, all you fuck niggas is the same to me
Just let the bass bump and your nasal passage got you running in place
Got you playing it backwards, finna run out of patience
Before it came the pastor
When I die, fornicate in the casket, motherfucker

[Hook]
I don’t give a fuck about who
Give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face
Leave 'em looking
I don’t give a fuck about who give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face, leave em looking
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
