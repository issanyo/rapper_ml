[Intro: J.I.D]
(Lay, sleep, wake up, lay... down, sleep
Uh, wake up
Cry, eat, sleep, world...)
Everybody—uh
Everybody—uh

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Okay, everybody wanna be a nigga, but nobody wanna be a nigga when it's time to be a nigga
If you thinkin' it, then say it, when you see a nigga; please be clear, I rhyme, I do not mind read
I ride the beat then have your girl ride the C-train to me to ride the D
And give me brain, and you can see the stains I place upon the sheet—oh, you gon' come for me?
Well, my nigga, you better have an army at least—more than a gun for me
I'm more than a man, not a God, but the boy is a man, we ignore all the noise from the outlandish
Standout with the cannon, outstandin' south bandit, don't panic, please, 'cause if I get nervous we get un-sturdy and we start to squeeze

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
Okay, niggadom
Nigga from nigga slum
Blue tongue, red tongue
Nigga flavors, go 'head, son, get you some
Nigga got a lot of gifts
But package store was always open
Jail house don't ever close
And my world view was always shut
Trap spot was always bunkin'
Neighborhood was always crunk
See I was outside riskin' snakes eyes
With my life chances, stakes high
Only outlet was the moon walk
Michael Jackson dances, so shuck and jive, nigga, bust a nine
Shoot behind the line, my only advances
USA eat me like a cancer
UK eat me like a cancer
Gettin' money and they tag the crib
Ask King James, "what's the fucking answer?"
Still a nigga out in Calabasas
Still a nigga when I greet the masses
Oval office, presidential grasses
When I fuck my white girl and I meet her daddy
I know deep down inside, man, he hate that shit
Plotting for the perfect time to bury me
Nigga, please, show 'em the green like a caddy
Verena, Serena them daddy
But that shit don't change my appearance
Asians like, "That's my nigga"
Latins like, "That's my nigga"
White folks like, "That's my nigga"
'Til it's time to die, bye, bye, nigga
Now don't get offended, I was just giving you hard time
Come to your block, give you hard line
My, did I come at the wrong time?
But see I sent comets to the Earth
Me, I was humming at your birth
I put colors on the spectrum
I let you assign them worth

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
I be looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you, ooh
Looking for peace when I stare at you

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
You know I'm here for the nigga shit
Whole life been nigga rich
Since my momma let a project nigga hit
Set it up so when I meet the reaper
Let my son reap the benefits
Nigga shit on social media
Get a nigga pinched, end up in the pen
Surrender your independence 'til the sentence finished
Even with no pot you got a cup to piss in
Burning bridges with my tunnel vision
Bitches leave niggas for cunnilingus
Fuck me like her nigga non-existent
No negativity, niggativity
Why you being silly fucking with me
Giggity giggity
When I'm in the city
They like, Doc you litty
Not as lit as I'm finna be
I just wake up and do shit differently
I can never say they doubted my ability
Along the way some niggas just wasn't feeling me
Niggas lost faith and quit on me
I just tuck 'em in the back of my memory
One monkey don't stop no show, my niggas got goals and responsibilities
So you know by any means, really mean any and everything to the team
Nothing off limits nigga, ain't gon' keep shit clean
Me and my niggas them niggas that they should've never let go free
Niggas got me talking through my teeth like I'm 50 Cent in '03
Ain't no Kunta Kinte, nigga Toby what they told me
"What it's gon' be?"

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
I be looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you, ooh
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
I be looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you, ooh
Looking for peace when I stare at you

[Outro: DC Young Fly]
Lift them titties up, thank you
Oh let go then, AY
Finna pick these niggas up
Aye man get the fuck out my way boy this the lyft driver
Yuh, boy I shoot your ass

Smoking in the car ain't got no gun fuck the police ay
Cool me up with this shit, eat this shit

I do need to work though so I ain't going to cancel it
Come on man, yall niggas come on man
