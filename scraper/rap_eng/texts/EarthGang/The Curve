[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
Yeah
So my ex called to tell me
Me and her was grand finale-ing
And she was 'bout to go Italian
Meanwhile, a call from Cali saying
Look, you and Venus, y'all are awesome dawg
Who the fuck's in charge of y'all
You could be the poster child
For underdogs and culture shock
Catch me in them overalls
And still provoking thought
How the fuck you pull that off
Riddle me that, riddle me that
Catapulting all these sad emotions
Overdosing, hope I be immortal
When my casket closing
Cataclysmic actions only happen when you master focus
Passion of the Christ is like a porno if you ask me bro
I'm the reason casualties are actually casual
And if [?] is cool then I see murders all on Channel 2
Ask your news
Stuff an eggplant in her passionfruit
And if she die, that's cool
That's a cadaver science class can use
Nothing goes to waste
Get y'all the sweetest haste
Y'all don't wash your hands
So I can tell you're digging shallow graves
Like shoop shooby do bop
[?]
Type of dude to turn your girl's vagina to a tube sock
[?], I'll fox the criminal justice system
Just in time to make the crowd rock

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
I would say it's way too early
To be cruising with you hooligans
The Metamucil crew again
With tasty [?], yeah
I see y'all set up decorations
But the floor's still dirtier
Than two teens a priest relay racing masturbation
To the latest diva playlist
I wonder if they let Tay here
I don't know who y'all thought we was
We the [?] just party animals
And brought everybody out 'cause we moving in
Watch your fucking shin
[?]
Flee to the mountains, practice zen
With a bunch of bougie fans
Come back with a twin
Been there for reaping, tweaking, geeking
And then [?]
Racing off the deepest end
Fuck them feeble frequencies
Fuck you mean, I ain't gotta say shit
I know, I know, it might seem light
But check the fucking packaging
And the police gon' start acting right
When the freezer endures heat
And a nigga [?] wings
So they trying to end us, meat
I just hopped off the jet, I'm back from Borneo
And all this bullet biting got me back in holy mode
Ayo, my mans, my mans, you listen to so and so?
And I like multiple
But it's still fuck the globe
Like I'm in horses heat stuck so
I called the phone

[Verse 3: J.I.D]
OK, your call has been forwarded
To an automatic voice message
Her ringtone is me, she just listen
Her best friend assisted with the hatred
Told her don't pick up the phone
That nigga fake and don't see how you take it
Shaking her head
And I can't trip because she means well [?]
But how you plural taking single advice?
That shit, that shit, that shit could have you singular, right
I rent a doghouse, 'bout to eat with the mice
And all these [?] talking, talking, talking
I think we could suffice
Only rappers with bars, and classy
On time with some decency
Cops looking for her but the weed is in the eateries
Or arteries, we ate it, digested it, enjoyed it
You looking for it?
In an hour meet me by the toilet
The Lord has blessed us with scientific intelligence
To connect and for you to ignore my call, well
You kinda disrespect me
You'll probably go to hell and shit
But that shit is irrelevant
Trying to be a player
But you're not the bitch thrilling me
I'm 'bout to catch a felony
Because I called the, called the, called the
Called the phone
It rings and rings and rings
