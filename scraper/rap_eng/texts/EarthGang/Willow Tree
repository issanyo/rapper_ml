[Hook: J.I.D]
Knowing what I know, I got to pray, I got to hope, I got to say I'm gonna make it out, yeah
Going with the flow, I got a plant inside my hands, I'm on my knees, I got to pray to God, yeah
And I don't see no other way, I gotta make it out, yeah
Can't live like this another day, I gotta make it out
Knowing what I know, I got to pray, I got to hope, I got to say I'm gonna make it out, yeah
Going with the flow, I got a plant inside my hands, I'm on my knees, I got to pray to God, yeah
And I don't see no other way, I gotta make it out, yeah
Can't live like this another day

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
My people know, perception is a clever disguise
Steady we roll, steady we navigate through the skies
Always been told "you better hurry, get out alive"
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to run to protect your hide
What if you hold, crumbled and cracked on a couple lies
It was still gone
Now you wonderin' where you fit in the file, better press on
Better hope that double click save your life
Gotta make it out
Shedding my skin, preparing to die
Gotta make it out

[Refrain: Doctur Dot]
Here we go, here we go
We already know life can get difficult
Shake my head at you, headed for typical
Breaking bread with my niggas from years ago, years ago
Here we go, here we go
You already know life can get difficult
Shake my head at you, headed for typical
Breaking bread with my niggas from years ago, years ago

[Verse 2: Jordxn Bryant & Hollywood JB]
Bleeding led us cop the tone, now I'm sleeping better
Mama calling on the phone, I forget to text her
Lose sleep, cry week, biweekly
I talk to God, I don't see him, but I need him
I've been running out of road for a minute
I watch this dirt turn to gold in a minute
I grab a sow and it's written
Sit and wish and top it, just hope for a nigga
I'm feeling low, I'ma blow a whole O for my niggas

[Hook: J.I.D] x2
Knowing what I know, I got to pray, I got to hope, I got to say I'm gonna make it out, yeah
Going with the flow, I got a plant inside my hands, I'm on my knees, I got to pray to God, yeah
And I don't see no other way, I gotta make it out, yeah
Can't live like this another day, I gotta make it out

[Refrain: Johnny Venus]
Here we go, here we go
We already know life can get difficult
Shake my head at you, headed for typical
Breaking bread with my niggas from years ago, years ago
Here we go, here we go
You already know life can get difficult
Shake my head at you, headed for typical
Breaking bread with my niggas from years ago, years ago
