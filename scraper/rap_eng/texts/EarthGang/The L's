[Intro]
Alright, turn it up in the headphones
You know it's crazy, I'm recording this by my dad's stuff
Tell him I said
I need to charge my phone
You get it? You get it? Cause you get it, get it?
Cause it's true to invoke ya
You need to, you need to get you light together and go to Everest
Alright

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
I can't even tell you how the fuck I'm still survivin'
All I know I'm runnin' out of dollars
Ridin' with a squad of coyotes and the master
Pull up on Kasim office, hold that nigga hostage
Most of y'all won't dream of it, y'all some fucking cowards
But how you claim to be the plug when you scared of power
She suck me when she fuck me, I can only hears devours
Tryna talk with stuffed throat, yo mama failed cause she allowed it
Whore from in London, not the Atlanta music community
My cousin probably sold you dope
While my auntie taught you to read
Granddaddy kept a machete, my momma got her degree
My papa never bite his tongue, he unpopular when he speak
I ain't caught up in all the hoopla
That just serve to defeat the whole purpose
Of what I do when I'm doing me
A loopy Nubian maneuver through opportunity
Then come back and feed my fam like I'm good, it's for you to eat
Unruly

[Hook]
You already know my shit
It's the one I don't drive
Floating out here in these streets
Catching all the new insides
25 in the dirt they come all lice and dirty
25 in the dirt they come all lice and dirty

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
Is it misty here? Did you miss me dear?
Might've missed the up face with all the balling and the cheers
But man this crisis mode, this black fan, this a rare rap
It's scrambled eggs on the wave caps
And red dots that wave back for you devils
They talking levels, just trebles that trade back
If I die tomorrow, promise you hit that 1-2 wave back
I know y'all don't want none, us over 21
Life outgrows in those suns, a late night with four nuns
Apologies but you can get the fuck if you ain't digging us
There's bigger fish to gut, around by '96
I had to sort my shit and so I used to sit and miss the bus
Now I'm dug in them stick 'em ups
And stuffin' and bussin' in the truck
Like I'm smuggling is this anybody
Not really but really buddy
You talkin' Shangri-La well I'll show you my city buddy
You talkin' genocide well I'll show you my city buddy
Now the baby's walking around like how y'all left us in these buddies

[Hook]
You already know my shit
It's the one I don't drive
Floating out here in these streets
Catching all the new insides
25 in the dirt they come all lice and dirty
25 in the dirt they come all lice and dirty

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Bitches goin' here hot boy but I know he broke
Till I go into my sock drawer where I hold that dope
I just order me a house and car combo with some fries
Told the realtor hold the door, on the real, I'm focused bro
Rolling dope up in bible paper blow, holy smokes
I am so high, I'm seeing doubles, I'm in serious trouble
That's if it's against the law to clone The Pope, monster flow
Find a hole inside the beat, watch me go, tone and poke
So it's only so, long so and so can go, he got it so
Body shits a hobby, I do more than soap
Phonies seem to want me dead
You and I know you corn
You and I know I was born
You and I que you eat like a horn on a pony head
You ain't watching movies, you are now viewing I
Like a optician, who is not, you a op
Like the opposition going public with my sickness
Like I'm trying to drop the stock on my physician

[Hook]
You already know my shit
It's the one I don't drive
Floating out here in these streets
Catching all the new insides
25 in the dirt they come all lice and dirty
25 in the dirt they come all lice and dirty
