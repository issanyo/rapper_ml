[Intro]
"You gotta work for greatness, man, you gotta work
You gotta work hard just to be good
Fuck being great, so imagine greatness, we gon' be great."

[Intro: Johnny Venus]
I told that bitch to get with me cause I'll be 21 forever
Skippin' cross the globe, baby girl, what the fuck is bad weather?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
He jumped up out the hood, what, you thought he ain't wan' go?
I told the motherland I'll be back, you ain't know?

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Skate, open the drapes
Silhouette, not a face approaches
With a plate full of crepes, grapes with the blunt to chase
Teeth paste, lay waste, lay pipe
Say grace, regular George would say that's dynamite
JJ damn kids, Bebe, damn J.I.D
Ate the whole state, put the straw in the great lakes
Fuck these steaks, tryna get overseas
Talking shit over trees, bumping Maurice king's treason
Thieves in the night if you readin' it right
We breed kings and knights, I'm still peepin' the sights, huh
Flabbergasted over the lights
Seen these niggas swagger jackin' over the night
That old shit you keep, but this time won't be nice
You hit me one time, second time gon' be like
The worst death since Michael, shots say Columbine
Shoppin' at boutiques in Niece, I gotta find
The dopest unique that speaks what's on my mind
Feelin' like I left my cleats, I gotta climb in 'em blind
Please show me how to get to, or maybe where to find, oh gladly
My London gal call me her American daddy
Reflex, no gaggy
She fuck with the mind, the tattoos and the swaggy
I gladly give her the whole bone like Lassie
But if she fuck another fella, she dead like old yeller
She deader than Helen Keller
I kill her, I really kill her
I'm chillin', I'm really feelin' myself and I'm really spillin'
I'm spillin' the whole cup, tell me, have you rolled up?
J.I.D got the alligator grip on your whole butt
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
No, bruh, I'm ready to get this money
I need more with these White girls who snort lines like they don't need noses
Spill' Ville billboard's posters
Need notice, notification of bosses
Like Maya Lanskey, you fancy pants fans can't stand me
J-I-D, baby, in the eyes for eye candy
Y'all don't understand me
This is for my niggas who say "Fuck understanding!"
Standing under rain with my toes in the sand
Lightning playin', this shit sound like Coltrane
You gotta snatch this mic from my cold dead hands
And probably still have to fight the old dead man

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
I told that bitch to get with me cause I'll be 21 forever
Skippin' cross the globe, baby girl, what the fuck is bad weather?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
He jumped up out the hood, what, you thought he ain't wan' go?
I told the motherland I'll be back, you ain't know?
Now usually I don't do this
Usually, I be tucked off in the corner looking foolish
Have everybody saying "Man, who, who, who, who this?"
Tryna' stick to myself like some praying hands
Or some crashed aliens
And I dance it like Zendaya dance
Woo, holy ghost don' got me shiverin'
Tilted with the top with just a little off his rocker
He tryna paint his life, his future brighter than his father's
Crazy, how could they start him?
JFK with the pardon
Listen, I play it often, it whistles on through the dark
See, we be def starring your clan, missing the mark
I be waiting on ya early like I'm 'posed to play the organ

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
Cleaner than a rubber duck, what the fuck?
Mommy suck, daddy yelled "Please, oh, please! Please, oh please!"
So we can find it, and it's hard to stay with us
We just bleed, we just bleed out the eyeball radius
The crimson tears of growing up
I'm super lifted off that Eucalyptus
Watching all my foolish visions come into fruition
While you losin' business, you stupid nigga
Them copy-cat maneuvers ain’t conducive to your movement, nigga
Eating cooch for dinner while she do the dishes
Direct a choir in my sex attire
Look at your neighbor, tell your neighbor "Pull her dress up higher"
Just like Elijah when I profit, ain't no bush on fire
Still ain't believing what he's leaving [?]
Is he a 5 percenter? Kinda hard to Identify when he’s high, spittin' and his eyes flicker
Then the sky opened up and that lightning hit him
I'm like "Damn, I might actually sound alright on this one"
We camping realer than a jungle in the night on this one
And I’m just chillin', imagine me off of my prescriptions
Bring your camera, your brain might deny your business
Said bring your camera, your brain might deny your visions
Spillage Village! I have no life

[Outro: J.I.D]
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
