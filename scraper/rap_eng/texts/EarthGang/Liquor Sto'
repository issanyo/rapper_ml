[Intro]
Just me
Just me
I wanna say just..
I wanna say just..
Ju-ju-ju-ju

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
This that might see 25
The name I see for my partners
Now I ain't so sure they died
That I hope this smoke dry my eyes
But kinfolk right outside with the rental
Binto, limo, zimbo, titty flow, wind storm, stage coach, wormhole, 64', long with this shit, go I don't mind
Breakfast for dinner
Pussy for Breakfast
I bought the bando
You bought the necklace
That's where we separate
Fucking with Marshall
Well that's the connection
Well that shit gon' cost ya
Well that's an investment
Just passing through sir
Still got arrested
Fucking with Marshall
Will teach you a lesson
Girl I was just asking
Cause your ass can get it
Girl your ass impressive
But your ass a blessing
But your ass keep acting
Exactly to toss that shit back like vital signs
Coming out that box Chevy
20 Million 20 year olds
Trying to keep it together
Trying to sweep they confetti
Trying to sleep like Coretta
Top up with our Mom's spaghetti
Ready, cause if they catch me with this
My face gon' hit them front pictures
Y'all go head and hit them switches
Y'all go head and hit them swishers
Smoke breaks, take them mid ditches
Your position is poor precision
Hold up bitch you blocking my vision

[Chorus: Mereba & EARTHGANG]
Baby, lay off
Might see Jesus before I see my next day off
Bitch you reaching for my lighter like it's my next pay off
Let's make this run right quick to the liquor sto'
Then we can run some more
Cause freedom can be so fun
Way off, lay off
Might see Jesus before I see my next day off
Bitch you reaching for my lighter like it's my next pay off
Let's make this run right quick to the liquor sto'
Then we can run some more
Cause freedom can be so fun

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
I ain't even tripping no more
Tired trying shake niggas out they sleep
There's a feast on the table and my dogs knock it over
Off the spill I bet everybody eat
Trying to make the fucking best of god giving ability
You can tell it's storm on the way
Hope the bitch niggas smell it
Only truth, I'm aloof to the shit you telling
Linking up with better plugs got a nigga disconnected
So we aren't fucking with the bar
We ain't fucking up the club tonight
Bitches in my cellular device
Call 'em up to smoke and fuck tonight
Taking shots for bros we lost when we was young
That really ain't deserve to die
I remember everyone that told me no
But nowadays they can't deny
I don't hold grudges
No no no no
Those are for bitches with nothing to do
I'd rather give niggas nothing but juice
Live life like there's nothing to lose
Oh shit, my bad, my bad
Where are my manners man
Please allow me to reintroduce
It's Doctur
The loopiest Nubian you ever knew
Pray to god everyday for some new revenue
Revenue, revenue, revenue, revenue
Revenue, revenue, revenue, revenue
Revenue, revenue, revenue, revenue
Revenue, revenue, revenue, revenue

[Chorus: Mereba & EARTHGANG]
Baby, lay off
Might see Jesus before I see my next day off
Bitch you reaching for my lighter like it's my next pay off
Let's make this run right quick to the liquor sto'
Then we can run some more
Cause freedom can be so fun
Way off, lay off
Might see Jesus before I see my next day off
Bitch you reaching for my lighter like it's my next pay off
Let's make this run right quick to the liquor sto'
Then we can run some more
Cause freedom can be so fun

[Bridge: Mereba & EARTHGANG]
Go 'head n put it in motion
We'll have to take off alone
Better to be in devotion
Say that to be in control
Go 'head n put it in motion
We'll have to take off alone
Better to be in devotion
Say that to be in control
Go 'head n put it in motion

[Chorus: Mereba & EARTHGANG]
Lay off, might see Jesus before I see-
Bitch you reaching for my lighter like it's-
Let's make this run right quick to the liquor sto'
Then we can run some more
Cause freedom can be so fun
Way off
