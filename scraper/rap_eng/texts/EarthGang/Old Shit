Yo. Oh. Yea. Uh uh
She can have the dick
She, she can have all the dick

I don't interfere with God
Baby that's my old shit
Baby that's my ol' bird
She done had all of it
We be in the darkest hour
Especially when the shots finished
She don't want a a rival
She know I ain't playin wit cha
Meet me where the roads cross
She gon' leave me cross the fields
Meet me where the roads cross
I know she got that iron wit her
Meet me where the roads cross
She gone let you know the feeling
Meet me where the roads cross
Top down, fly nigga!

Shout out to my lost niggas

Still dealing with the consequences
Got no power, got no lights, give me fourty days, I could read my mind, I could bottle up ???????

I don't interfere with God
Baby that's my old shit

Especially when the shots finished
She don't want a a rival
She know I ain't playin wit cha
Meet me where the roads cross
She gon' meet me cross the fields
Meet me where the roads cross
I know she got that iron wit her
Meet me where the roads cross
