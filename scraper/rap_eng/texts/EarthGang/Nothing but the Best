[Intro: Ari Lennox & Doctur Dot]
Ayy yeah (aight)
Ayy yeah (yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Nothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind
I ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?
I think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind
What did you do expect? Nothin' but the best
Nothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind
I ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?
I think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind
What did you do expect? Nothin' but the best

[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
Uh-oh, you let the blood spill fuck up your flow
All my local rastas totin' yoppers
Rollin' ganja then I slide in vagina you sponsor
How that nine to five workin' out?
I used to be just like you, keep in mind we do this shit for the freeski
Me, Johnny V, J-I-Deesky, mixtape Weezy made it look easy
Lil did we know 'bout all the politics and meetings
And these old ass pussy niggas caught up in they feelings
Rat race is everlastin', I'm an eagle to it
Only swoopin' when I need to do it
Earned my stripes, bitch I'm Beetlejuice-in'
Burnin' lights, I want to see you movin'
Fertilize even though I don't believe in shootin', hey
Take it easy my nigga
Shit get greezy every minute that you let the skillet sit
Hands free, don't say shit to me about the penmanship
Have the backwood rolled before I finish this, still it's

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Nothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind
I ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?
I think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind
What did you do expect? Nothin' but the best
Nothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind
I ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?
I think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind
What did you do expect? Nothin' but the best

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
Huh, got to be (got to be)
More careful with nostalgia
Tacklin' (my issues), my issues in them Valiums
You like if Sade and Juicy J had a child, well
Honey if, you brave then, maybe you should pick the style-yum
Ridin' on the leaves through the lightning though
Fallin' on my knees, what you like to know
I whip the feast, I put the heat while under microscopes
Now stream all the reasons to syphon the flow
Say though I gotta keep it easy, dragon fly with the reezy
Bat an eye at the pastor then catapult to the precinct
Naturally check the balance and negatively decreasin'
No ration for tiger passion, abundantly me releasin'

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Nothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind
I ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?
I think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind
What did you do expect? Nothin' but the best
Nothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind
I ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?
I think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind
What did you do expect? Nothin' but the best
