[Intro]
This is a song... that was written—

[Chorus]
Pain killers, brain fillers filling up the street
Run and tell the priest
Why you freaky than a beast?
Pain killers, brain fillers filling up the street
Run and tell the priest
Why you freaky than a beast?

[Verse 1]
Reefer snatcher
Leave a sack of sticky sod in the corner
Pray to God momma smoke
She such a hard working woman
Pitbulls chase my father
Nightmares chase my uncle
White hairs every generation
Salt and peppered younger
Cotton mouth from adderall and small piñatas full of Indica
Light it up and pass it like a physical
Oh, I need some trim
I met a thicky finna hit her up and hopefully her phone don’t wake her nigga up
I’m the type of guy that hates when niggas tell the type of guy they is
Save it for your wife, my nig
I only think in hieroglyphs
The sound of lighter sparking make my heart as light as Michael’s kids
Often wonder if the dead still swap survival tips

[Verse 2]
OK, I hate the back and froth
We so Serena and Venus
Guess she just want the Marcus and Neiman’s
She wanna turn gay but can’t spell happiness without penis
Carpet munchy mommy
Roll up my weed with some tenderness
Pinch that bud, lil nug cost me a Benjamin
Nigga the plug in Europe pushing a pendleton
Oh god girl, you still with a damn Wimbledon
Stop playing, you know what I’m saying?
Just roll my grams

[Chorus]
Pain killers, brain fillers filling up the street
Run and tell the priest
Why you freaky than a beast?
Pain killers, brain fillers filling up the street
Run and tell the priest
Why you freaky than a beast?

[Verse 3]
Don't let them in the living room
They gone see my baby pictures
Give Nana 50 kisses when you get this
Tell her I really miss her
Might not make it home this Christmas
Can I make it on somebody's Wishlist?
I can make it on somebody's Wishlist?
Why are you all alone amongst the fixings?
Fix your face before they get it
Stop your knees from shaking and spinning
Shadows sprinting across the kitchen
Terrified of my latest visions
I got them burglar bars put in last night
I'm taking precautions
Can't take no close calls on my cellular phone device
The devil wrapped all over me twice
Can't scratch the surface now
I'm out in all the wrong places
Lifting up skirts and searching for insight
I'm stumbling following 3 mice
One said you get out what you put in
So if you fall in mid flight, don’t you try and fault the mid wife
That Oxygen get in you ad now your head getting light
I'd rather save a sinner, than save a hoe any night
Suggest you pack your wings tight
Your emergency piece
I, I mean whatever you might need to travel, including light

[Chorus]
Pain killers, brain fillers filling up the street
Run and tell the priest
Why you freaky than a beast?
Pain killers, brain fillers filling up the street
Run and tell the priest
Why you freaky than a beast?
