[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Grandma always told me not to worry
Keep your weapons sharp, practice fighting after dark
Not to rush and don’t you hurry
Smile when the rain come cause the pain gets buried
And ain't no girl good enough for you until you 30
So, make that money son
I know we come from, humble means
Tore up jeans, dusty shacks, lima beans
See the world gone need a double dose of you, show you true
Kiss her cheek
Hit the door
Make them scream, Monsters Inc
See I done came a long way from a sheet
In a closet with a beat, ceiling pockets with a leak
And tryna get this off me by the middle of the week
I hear them talking shit but they ain't talking to me, so discrete
They say I gotta, anger problem I gotta, thinking problem
I try to, solve it often but nada
Motivation, I mixed that with some pussy and some vodka
Destinations, I spin the globe and tell you pick a spotta
You faker than them Pradas, I take it you’s a scholar
Yo life been a whole roll that you picked up from shottas
You selling that oh no
I got that pookie product
So the next time that you blow my dick be sure to use bravado
My bad I know my accent, hard for you to swallow, but your girlfriend she do fine
Man man she blow my mind
And since I’m from Atlanta expectations start to pile up of me pushing some Impala, clubbing weekly till i fall out
But ma’am ion do that shit
And on my route to Bentley coups I shift through that shit
These niggas threw me for a loop I brought the drum pad in
Now I’m sitting up front
I can’t quit laughing and steady blunt passing

[Chorus]

Used to roll them zig-zags, now I just boil it
Do this so my mama never have to wash them toilets
Life is full of bullshit, you should press record then
Keep the script up off the table they gone try to spoil it

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
Uh whole fucking generation is abortion survivors
Porn oriented minds that was born in the 90s
Filled, to the brim with testosterone and lightening
But I supposed the critics still gone manage to deny it
Fuck it, I don't trip they ass lick and sniff they upper lip
That’s probably why them fuckers struggle recognizing real shit
Hey Mr. where you headed
I’m just tryna' pay these bills kid
And find a bitch that think I’m fucking good enough to live with
Though, shacking up is not an option for me
Unless I got the option to leave
I guess I’m paradoxing, and the problem could be possibly me
I earned my doctorate in knocking daddy’s girls to they knees
I guess, I’m just another american embarrassment
With a freak bitch giggling tryna' tongue-twist a cherry stem
B.O.B. is cool but Doc and Venus yeah we scared of them
Cause they might drop the truth on these niggas without preparing them
Like mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble beg ya pardon
General reaction whenever the doctor’s talking
At a crux house party standing round feeling awkward
We just posted on the wall forever the underdogs
I thought it was rather odd when she sucked my cock and balls
She kept the semen in her mouth and spit it in a jar, eeeew
Save it for a rainy day I guess
Unless the forecast claim the clouds will come tomorrow
How 'bout it

[Chorus]
