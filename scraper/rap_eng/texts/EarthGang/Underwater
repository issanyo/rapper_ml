[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Last night, night, night, night, night
I dreamt of the wildest
Say last night, night, night, night, night
I kept to my self, shit, I checked on my health, shit
I finished the bottle, I slept with my conscious
I did the unthought of, I cut off my phone, see
I walked in the crowd then I stopped for a picture
I felt so alone
And last night, I wrote what I want in life
And last night, I swallowed my own advice
I called up my backups, told 'em to back up
And worked on my manhood, the pussy was damn good
I pray to my God, I walk with the people
I loaded my weapon, she told me to ease up

[Hook: Sir]
Crowded faces I put on
To be seen is all we want
All these freaks come out these holes
Just to be or not belong
When it's darkest before dark
If it's quiet, not for long
Tell the Sun I'm on my way
Right to see what I become

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
And last night, I dreamt of my past life
Woke up with the morning wood
Forever misunderstood
Walk up to the corner store knowing I ain't want nothing
I cop a lighter and bust a move
Always got too much to do, always on the way somewhere
Outerspace is the face I wear
Take the bullshit away somewhere
Spot the imposter, my patients thinner than angel hair
Don't touch the ashtray, I put the last of my faith in there
And last night, yeah, while my body was home allow my mind to me gone
Couple texts from my exes and I still ain't respond
Never feelin' the pressure to be up pressin' no buttons
Always facing my death, tell the reaper to run it
If you don't know why you here, then R.I.P won't mean nothing
I done seen too much, watch the queen turn junkie
Like Billie Jean try to fix a broken heart with a broken rubber

[Hook: Sir]
Crowded faces I put on
To be seen is all we want
All these freaks come out these holes
Just to be or not belong
When it's darkest before dark
If it's quiet, not for long
Tell the Sun I'm on my way
Right to see what I become
