(Intro: J.I.D)
Please Please Please
Please, Wait

(Verse 1: J.I.D)
Please don't try to compare us to another mad little fad
Make you feel mad little fast
Stress make a nigga grab mad little bags of the gas
High pain, niggas laughing, we ash then we pass
Father protect my 40 and my Deuce Deuce
Never know what I got in my little Deuce Coupe
Shawty wild trippin tryna throw the coo coo
I gave it to my dog, that a alley oop- oop
I heard someone said something about a six eye
With all respect, bro we cool on the dick rise
If I can make that shit grow then ima kill it
Only point my gun at the guy in the mirror, Russian Roulette
I'm just aware, it was a dare
You be the scaredest, buried and jerried imperialist
You should be very embarrassed, I dare a nigga to test
This rap inside my intestines, I'm fully built with a blessing

(Hook: J.I.D)
But you my little Deuce Coupe you don't know what I got
I gotta little Deuce Deuce put a hole in your hat
You need to chill you don't know where you at
Dawg, you don't know where you at
I'm in my little Deuce Coupe, know what I got
22, put a hole in your hat
Shit, you better chill you don't know where you at
Dawg, you don't know where you at
But you don't know where you at

(Verse 2: Johhny Venus)
I guess she could have left a deal when they cut up the spades
Keep quiet, keep quiet, this the bustin' brigade
Or they gon lock your ass up and they gon run with the cage
I had to buy it cause I got it just to shit on the pain
The competition really nadda they just caught in the rain
They just caught up like you, Deuce Deuce to the brain
But you know, I don't really fuck with none of these roads
I don't really fuck with none of these roads
No no, I don't really fuck with none, none of these thangs
Trusts em as a far as I could pop a lil' slug, it's probably because
My name hold weight like it's caught in the mud
You see my dad and my momma be the cause of the blood
They tell me "freedom
Be the cost of my blood
Now what you need son?
I know your problems by name
Now is it treason?
By what they offered to us
The semi auto to your torso in the hemisphere
That said, the sad, I made mistakes
I'm better now, see baby cakes
I'm sheltered now, can't blame the snakes
Don't let me out, they round the way
Yeah lord I know, the judges tongue gon burn today
Cause he don't know what he be talkin any way it goes
Deuce deuce on the playground, like
Gon head get down, like
Child, said gon head get down!

(Hook: J.I.D)
But you my little Deuce Coupe you don't know what I got
I gotta little Deuce Deuce put a hole in your hat
You need to chill you don't know where you at
Dawg, you don't know where you at
I'm in my little Deuce Coupe, know what I got
22, put a hole in your hat
Shit, you better chill you don't know where you at
Dawg, you don't know where you at
But you don't know where you at

(Verse 3: Doctor Dot)
Sandwiched in between death and birth
I'm a young kielbasa with the works
Lip lockin with a young pill popper
And I'm certain the cotton mouth, wanna fake the squirt (Oh No)
Only one way to test, Holy Moly impressed
Only fumes of the medical occupying my chest
I've been eating my vegetables, I've been getting my rest
The kingdom is coming now is the time to invest
Fair warning pardon me it's the petty me, telling me
That I should call every ex and try to fuck'em as an X list celebrity
Just don't let me choke you cause I doubt if Imma let you breathe
Hard to believe I connect the dot on felonies
Huh, I'm a better me now
Me and my two niggas, 'Oh brother where art thou?'
While minding my own business, like officer calm down
We all got camera's on our phone, you about to get called out
Now my little deuce coupe you don't know what I got
Can't catch me, they'll throw at the cop
You need to chill you don't know where you at
You don't know where you at
You got my little deuce coupe, know what I got
Big chew, put a hole in your mouth
You need to chill, you don't know where you at
You don't know where you at, you don't know where you at

(Hook: J.I.D)
But you my little Deuce Coupe you don't know what I got
I gotta little Deuce Deuce put a hole in your hat
You need to chill you don't know where you at
Dawg, you don't know where you at
I'm in my little Deuce Coupe, know what I got
22, put a hole in your hat
Shit, you better chill you don't know where you at
Dawg, you don't know where you at
But you don't know where you at
