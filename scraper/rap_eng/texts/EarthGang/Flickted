[Chorus]
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, yea

[Hook]
What's your addiction?
Is it money? Is it hoes? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted
Not one, not two, but all three
What's your addiction?
I've been afflicted

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Life's a bitch with pretty eyes
So in between them I guess I'll get high
Mama asked me for a song, well I've been an artist my whole damn life
Ooh la-la-la, it's the way I feel when I can't fuck this feelin' out me
Ooh la-la-la, it's the fool on the hill take the sun make a peel out of
You always was working, I believed in perfect
I would cheat to try to fill my emptiness with them legs
See I was loosey goosey girl oh ho ho ho
I was flippin' through the city tryna poke somethin'
I knew cuddling was God's leverage
I knew weed was the gateway to the gates of heaven
Tell you I was trying to fuck, fuck it out of me
Into me, feenin' for your portal and that outer space make sense to me
But two minutes, two hours, two millenniums later
The comedown was greater
I found myself sayin' I ain't really feelin' this
I'm barely feeling myself
All this medicated bliss, I'm barely healin' myself
Raise your hand if you addicted
Double shot or double tap it, what's the difference

[Hook]
What's your addiction?
Is it money? Is it hoes? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted
Not one, not two, but all three
What's your addiction?
I've been afflicted

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
They holla ? and back
That dog be like where I go
My mama say makossa, ke-mo sah-bee what you know?
OG told me one thing bout ownership it's about control
Another coke thats crushin shit up my nose, fiendin' for more
Show up late, pussy cream in the crotch of my clothes
Do what I want, I shoulda died a long time ago
Picture me, rolling Uber X with your ex on oxycontin
I ain't serve it to her and I don't condone it
We just brick it till we blow it
We just building and destroyin'
Throwin' up and missing toilets
Don't give me side-eye, we all know what you be doin'
We all bleed, we all need what we need when it's necessary
I'm starin' at glassy eyes, keepin' diamonds in my
Post a nigga postin' up, it's the sign of the times
Oh wait, wait, big shit when the camera roll
Bitchy dot never hoe
Nothing even really matter though
Lauryn Hill and D'Angelo
If you ain't got no money, take your broke ass home

[Hook]
What's your addiction?
Is it money? Is it hoes? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted
Not one, not two, but all three
What's your addiction?
I've been afflicted

[Chorus]
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, do it for me, take the edge off
This gon' do it for me, yea
