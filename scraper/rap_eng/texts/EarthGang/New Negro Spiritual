Riddle me this, where to begin
Who you call family
Who you call friend
What’s causing damage under your skin
Riddle me this, where is your faith
What you believe nigga
How do you pray
Do you ever fell like god just get in the way
Riddle me this, what makes you real
Is it your reputation
Or is it you skills
Is it people you safe or who your willing to kill
(Alright my nigga we get it)
Riddle me this
I bet you don’t know
How good it feels to have a soul thats unsold
I cash my own checks
I fuck my own hoes
I can’t catch my breath
The end seems so close

Be a man, be a man, be a man
Be a man, be a man, be a man
Be a man, be a man, be a man
Be a man, be a man, be a man
