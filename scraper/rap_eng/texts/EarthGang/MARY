[Johnny Venus]

Leanin' (x6)
(Eh!) Leanin' leanin'

[Hook: Johnny Venus]
They got me leanin'
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
I'm just trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
Chaka Khan can't climb like this

They got me leanin'
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
I'm just trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
(Yea Yea)Then you should learn to mind yo business


[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Ain't hard to tell I need peace
Floating like a jackal out of hell through these streets
Kickin' doors in for loans
Wrappin' bones in the sheets
See it won't be long for the meek to snatchin' those oceans and peaks
I can't deny them baby pacs(?) about to pop through the creases
That's on my momma, my poppa, my boy and this holy season
They yellin' Big Pun back!
Well I did that with two tweasers
That's why my wrists were gone snap
I'm thinkin' that was too easy
Su Lee(?) said Hey that's enough
Best to get back to the singing
Tell Lucifer belly up
'Cause I got Hell on my fingers
Ain't have to held on to nina
Just a hellish demeanor
My momma popped into my (??) when I helped at the scene
She screamed out cash rule everything around but the dream
Girl I'm lactose anyway so I can't fuck with the cream
And America so crazy I can't fuck with the scheme
Yea and I know baby I know 'bout that I know what this gone bring (tryin' to find my center!)

[Hook: Johnny Venus]
They got me leanin'
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
I'm just trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
Chaka Khan can't climb like this

They got me leanin'
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
I'm just trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]

(Woo!)
(Uh huh)
(Yea)

Wakin' up, open eyes
So surprised, still alive
Should've died plenty times (oh shit!)
Dogs taught me move in silence
Good advice
Black stallion in the night
Black Power the style now
Spill was out here the whole time
Been here to my old grounds
Actin' scared make 'em draw down
Make the best of a small amount
Good sex at your momma house
Lookin' up at the sky
All the stars single file
Juvenile takin' over for the '99
You ain't floatin' you just watered down
You ain't wavy you just on the beach
You ain't crazy as you wanna be
You play a role for the industry
I leave my soul all in the beat
To infinity got a ten to see
To get really really really geeked
Good gas better hit a G
More teddy bears in the street than I ever seen
It's the devil's dream
Aw man aw shit
That was woke that was deep
Nah man I just spoke what I seen
Blessed with the sauce bon appetite
Rumble young man, rumble
I'm so fuckin' tired of being humble
Lost my fuckin' mind in the jungle(woo!)

Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
I'm just trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
Leanin' trying to find my center (trying to find my center!)
