[Intro: Doctur Dot]
See I came here with a dangerous attitude and I stayed here
Hand me luffa' I bathe here
Scrubbing up your woman’s butt
Bubbles come from under us
All the strength that I could mus-ter couldn't make that thunder hush

[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
(I don’t give a fuck)
Bout a blogger or a critic
Who be talking all the shit with all the typing and the clickin'
(I don’t give a fuck)
'Bout a model slash actress
Or whatever you thinking you practice
You don’t matter as much as your ass does
(I don’t give a fuck)
'Bout a house wife or a ball wife
Why don’t you watch your own life
I guess cause you got no life
(I don’t give a fuck)
'Bout a cosign or a high five or a thumbs up
You’re a dumb fuck
In my eyes so don’t try
(I don’t give a fuck)
'Bout a meatloaf or a rap beef
Put it like this, if you ain't finna' take my life then don’t attack me
(I don’t give a fuck)
'Bout your so-called sour diesel
I’ll chief you
Under the table if I was to meet you
(I don’t give a fuck)
'Bout a nigga views on YouTube
You’re too stu-p-i-d
To ID what I do
(I don’t give a fuck)
Bout the coolness or that hot shit
Monkey see monkey do motherfuckers
Man I’ll drown you motherfuckers in a mosh pit

[Hook: Doctur Dot]
I don’t give a fuck about who
Give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face
Leave em looking
I don’t give a fuck about who give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face, leave em looking
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
6 AM and I’m up on a mission
Brains washed up all in my kitchen
Clothes falling apart
Not to mention
I ain't had shit to eat in a minute
So i’m scratching and so I’m itching
Hands ashy, looking for an innocent bystander to bypass me
Take yo shit and take off dashing
Take yo bitch and take off laughing
Tell her take that shit off naturally
I’m chilling in back with the cough syrup
Sick than a motherfucker yeah you heard me
I wish I could ride around with the top dropped down
But the government too concerned with me
Who he learning with what he reading from
Oh he feeding dumb niggas that shit
Hey baby I, I think you look x, y, z, a-mazing
Gotta find out where they made ya
Gotta have that mufucka raided
Like two in the front
Eight in the back
Anybody move let them go blat
Like two in the front, eight in the back
Anybody move, bet they go blat
Them boys went crazy
Now they back, and naw they don’t drive no Cadillac
And ya’ll niggas out here looking for a pat on the back or a cosign
Nigga fuck that o the stupid hoes and the videos
And to everything that goes into making you watch them TV shows
And your mind just numb
And numb and you rolling rolling well

[Hook: Doctur Dot]
I don’t give a fuck about who
Give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face
Leave em looking
I don’t give a fuck about who give a fuck about us
Got them shook about face, leave em looking
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck

[Outro: Doctur Dot]
