[Verse 1]
Nigga, take a tyga, Ty Dolla $ign, the creator
I dub this whole disc a hold up
Wake up, it's a stick up
Fill that bag with thirty million dollars worth of nickels
Feel like George Clinton in Bill Clinton position
Fuck *slurs* he don't listen
Unity is cool, uniformity is missing
The whole point, old niggas in the city diggin' for gold coins
There's diamonds everywhere, look around, nigga

[Hook]
Look around, nigga, look around, nigga
Look around, nigga, look around, nigga
Look around, nigga, look around, nigga
There's diamonds everywhere, look around, nigga

[Verse 2]

Shoot it right between you camouflage ass niggas

Get it in on the benz from the start ass niggas
Ivy coast with the scars ass niggas
Fuck the law
We ain’t did shit for y’all ass niggas
Old guard ass niggas
Wanna ball ass niggas
Pray to god I’ll never be like one of y’all ass niggas

[Hook]
Look around, nigga, look around, nigga
Look around, nigga, look around, nigga
Look around, nigga, look around, nigga
There's diamonds everywhere, look around, nigga
