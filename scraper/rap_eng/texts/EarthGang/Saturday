[Hook] x2
You ain't got shit on a nigga
Jackpot for the shot
Tell me what's the going bid on a nigga
We done made it in America?
Who the fuck is "we" then, my nigga?
Swear the trees and leaves talk to me
Is you knowing is you sawing?
What's the difference?
Is you going? Is you with it?

[Verse 1]
Just another journey
Just adjust the picture
Persecution Nation
Pay the perfect witness
Find the foolish nigga
Show him superficial
Show up where he living, zoo among'st the buildings
Who amongst here gathered got affinities for killing?
Really who among'st here gathered still remember people stealing People cheering
People screaming, teacher's lying through veneers
They can't really have you knowing
What they're capable of seeding
They gone force feed you maneuver till you can't help but quit breathing
Tell me lord! Tell me I'm a ship sitting cross sand
Born as a fugitive in a lost land
Born with the mind round my neck
With the staff in my left and the Glock nine in my right hand
Young nigga, you don't know, you don't know
What  the world got in store for the 4AM skin type
Admiration at the shows, at the shows
Stadiums and the domes but it's hell on a nigga flight

[Hook] x2
You ain't got shit on a nigga
Jackpot for the shot
Tell me what's the going bid on a nigga
We done made it in America?
Who the fuck is "we" then, my nigga?
Swear the trees and leaves talk to me
Is you knowing is you sawing?
What's the difference?
Is you going? Is you with it?

[Verse 2]
Bill collectors calling
I don't answer numbers I don't recognize
Life is crazy at the moment, I'll admit it
I'm authentic
Everything these cookie cutter rappers missing
Hit the genetic lottery, I was blessed and born with it
I love watermelon and the melanin thats in my skin
Fuck you think nigga?
I ain't never been shamed of neither one
Take a minute to consider who among you is the realest
If he claim he killing snitches he probably the main one
Who the fuck you think you is???
To judge another nigga's living
Mothafucker you ain't God
HALLELUJAH
Mind your mothafucking business
Respect is only earned when you snatch it off they finger tips
Addicted to victory, Psychedelics and the leaky shit
You slimy with the cheddar but
You pretty with the greasiness
I came to fuck the world hit it raw, bust and leave it in

[Hook] x2
You ain't got shit on a nigga
Jackpot for the shot
Tell me what's the going bid on a nigga
We done made it in America?
Who the fuck is "we" then, my nigga?
Swear the trees and leaves talk to me
Is you knowing is you sawing?
What's the difference?
Is you going? Is you with it?
