[Hook: Doctur Dot]
What the fuck is wrong with me?
Maybe I'm just a machine
Lately, I just don't feel anything
This used to feel like a dream
Now I'm thrown out by your energy
Nigga just wanna be seen
Nobody fuckin with listening (whoa)
Still don't know what's wrong with me
Maybe I'm just a machine
Lately, I just don't feel anything
This used to feel like a dream
Now I'm thrown out by your energy
Everything ain't what it seems
Still I can't let that shit get to me no

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
Rain down on me
Shoo-be-doo-doo up on me
Shoo-be-doo-doo up on me
Rain down on me
I got all these bitches on me
So why do I feel so lonely?

[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
No more bad karma
Can't forget the day I got it tatted on me with Selena, homie
Out in Southern California bumping Tony Toni Tone
Checkered past got you jumping to conclusion, you don't never ask, you just be assuming, down bad
I was really going through it, farely music, nothing else mattered to me
And I ain't perfect, never claimed to be
That surface shit is worthless, no stranger to murder after church service
Life be throwing me curves
She had me thinking perverted, there's no worries
I light the blunt at four-twenty and save the world by four-thirty
So many did your boy dirty, but I ain't trippin' or hurtin'
Thanks to this vision and purpose
I seldom scribble shit, forgettin' shit
Like fuck it, just keep swimmin' like Dory, transformin'
From the best-kept secret to something fuckin' historic
But still

[Hook: Doctur Dot]
What the fuck is wrong with me?
Maybe I'm just a machine
Lately, I just don't feel anything
This used to feel like a dream
Now I'm thrown out by your energy
Nigga just wanna be seen
Nobody fuckin with listening (whoa)
Still don't know what's wrong with me
Maybe I'm just a machine
Lately, I just don't feel anything
This used to feel like a dream
Now I'm thrown out by your energy
Everything ain't what it seems
Still I can't let that shit get to me, no

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
Rain down on me
Shoo-be-doo-doo up on me
Shoo-be-doo-doo up on me
Rain down on me
I got all these bitches on me
So why do I feel so lonely?

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
Ok, where do I begin, connect the circuits
See, I'm tryna find a way, shit, in my defense
All that I was taught and known for I was grown was hate
"Boys don't show emotion"
Only feel those 808s, come blow on my cartridge
All we got is games to play
Keepin' ancient secrets locked beneath us lost in P.E
Missin sex and fucking teachers in our T-shirts on our hardwood
Bet her knee hurts on the real though
Me an expert on the physical exertion
My compassion never worked until today
She said "Where's your empathy"
I don't know
Guess they got the best of me
Hope it ain't so
I was such a fresh pre-teen
And as a baby cub, a little flashy fiend
But I can
Life's a whole lot more, I admit it
Biting nipples, pushing buttons
Young West African girl
You too busy twerkin' in the motherland
Got the energy in me, so I was wondering
Could you help me, Could you tell me

[Hook: Doctur Dot]
What the fuck is wrong with me?
Maybe I'm just a machine
Lately, I just don't feel anything
This used to feel like a dream
Now I'm thrown out by your energy
Nigga just wanna be seen
Nobody fuckin with listening (whoa)
Still don't know what's wrong with me
Maybe I'm just a machine
Lately, I just don't feel anything
This used to feel like a dream
Now I'm thrown out by your energy
Everything ain't what it seems
Still I can't let that shit get to me, no

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
Rain down on me
Shoo-be-doo-doo up on me
Shoo-be-doo-doo up on me
Rain down on me
I got all these bitches on me
So why do I feel so lonely?
