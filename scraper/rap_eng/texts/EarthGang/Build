[Intro]
I need to turn off my phone
Let's do this, let's do this right
Fuck everything!

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
Just yesterday, I had everything
Everything was nothing, but I ain't complain
Just yesterday, we was everybody
We was all in the trenches, no one ever doubted
Just yesterday, had to remind myself
The internet's a crazy place and so much of that shit is fake
I'm a nineties baby, so I'll probably look you in the face
And tell you I don't give a fuck, 'bout whatever you tryna say

[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
Before I reply, I supply the silence
Comin' up seen alot of violence
Stay high through the struggle, I'm a fighter pilot
Shawty ass so fat, wanna die behind it
How that boy from the darkest side of life
Become a marvel of modern science
Really I go harder than all these artist
Who dick you ridin'
Why waste your time? You don't get that back
You D.K. what I suffer through
What did life put my muscles through?
Made that boy indestructible
Why you can't tell me shit like a substitute
Might pull up and just dump on you
Keep it G in my element
All my P's and Q's come away with the W

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
Just yesterday, I had everything
Everything was nothing, but I ain't complain
Just yesterday, we was everybody
We was all in the trenches, no one ever doubted
Just yesterday, had to remind myself
The internet's a crazy place and so much of that shit is fake
I'm a nineties baby, so I'll probably look you in the face
And tell you I don't give a fuck 'bout whatever you tryna say

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
These applications ain't fit to lie on
Some of y'all know me, but mostly, y'all dead wrong
Label me criminal, rap sheet a mile long
I coulda been like you, but I had to grab my own
See I was in the west end, flexin', gettin' fitted for my rhinestones
Starin' at the mirrors in the ceiling, reflectin' on my life, homes
Tellin' you we got our choppers, we don't need your fly over
If you need one man, I could call Tom and he'll be right over
See some of my niggas package up whatever and sell it to make a cent
Put a shirt on and pull up to Sprint
Put in work but they makin' no better and so they quit
Blessings in disguise, I know what you were thinkin'
That nigga dance crazy, singin' at graduation
Them niggas ain't gon' make it
Who wrote this anyway? I did
That's how you whip up the story and cook it to life, kids
You should try it, ooh, you might even be amazed
You might even be the face of some generation
That's fuckin' the system for inspiration
Gun to the head like masturbation

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
Just yesterday, I had everything
Everything was nothing, but I ain't complain
Just yesterday, we was everybody
We was all in the trenches, no one ever doubted
Just yesterday, had to remind myself
The internet's a crazy place and so much of that shit is fake
I'm a nineties baby, so I'll probably look you in the face
And tell you I don't give a fuck 'bout whatever you tryna say
