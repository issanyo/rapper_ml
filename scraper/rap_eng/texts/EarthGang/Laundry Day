[Verse 1]
It was possibly impossible for me to be here
I close my eyes and float right back to days and nights and heart attacks
And nights my heart went pat-pat-pat
Nigga don't you stop why don't look back
And we was out (?) he has himself to come back
And my bloodstain just made contact
I'm alone so i'm trying not to nap
The dopeboys dreamin of a trap
Baby don't look at me like that
And help me fade to black, and back to blue
A scar or two, without a drip, the carpet ruined, well that's my shit, well maybe I should dip
And kiss my fate against that asphalt
It's dark as fuck but the birds still up like I can hear them laugh as I walk
Sittin in a field, just cursing, screaming, worse as he blast off
But you can't win, child
Better off this nigga win child
Better off coppin from your friends child
Fuck a nigga lookin for a man's child
So when I'm all tied up out of the centile
Then I was told to get wild cause life's know to get (?)
(?) that my maker
I look down and see my fellas hold around my ankles
Shit, I got it-

[Hook]
They tell me, yeah they tell me once upon a time like the ending of every story
Scary story, and I'll be there with you very shortly
Shit, piss, I'm just marking my territory
Territory oh
Check the stats, they ain't ready for me now
It's summer, dolla dolla, shot and I'm a day late
Still waiting on my fucking pay raise
You can take Shondra
I'm a fucking (?)
Break a day when the day break

[Verse 2]
Truth or dare
Naturally I took the double dog option
Hit this bubbling bong
A little syrup for coughing
And I ain't sick or nothing
I just like this (?) when I'm talking
Bless I hate industry meetings with these urban imposters
Just tryna feed my fam like a bird when she nauseous
So if I'm flyin why you tryin conversation just be patient
Aloof not far from institution, not incarceration, word of cause (?) when homicide keep you the safest
Thots are just catching me arches
Even though she know she supposed to be at home, vacuuming and watching porno
That's not funny, why you say that
Is you kidding or sarcastic
Tripping cause I'm walking backwards
Kicking up man the fanatics
Fuck the world
Keep your balance by your balance imbalance
Eyin channels of heaven, writing the candid advancements
Real secrets empty quick
Cashing is the only fashion
My whole tribe's nomadic and no god could match it

[Hook]
