[Intro - J.I.D]
Spillage Village taking over for the 20-9-9 and the 2900's or whatever or somethin'

[Verse 1 - J.I.D]
Yeah, as you been whippin' that benz uh
Ye ain't' taking that shit nigga so make amends
I been that nigga, you can't touch me
Set hut, nigga touch down
Get your fucking face out the mud now, uh
I'm feeling so i-goddamn-relevent
You don't know me dog, I'm a loner, I'm a loner
But I know your type, you the solo type
Get shook up fast, explode
But left flat
And I already know, yous a killa, a hustla, true religion customs
Nigga came from nothing
Blah, Blah, Blah
You's a fuckin' busta
Bust in your crib and take everything but the mustard
And a roll of tissue, nigga ain't' gonna bullshit you dog
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
25 bitches on my dick like it's Christmas
Oh shit, what is this?
Give it to you raw, what the privilege
You ain't' got to take it serious, you inferior pawn, nigga
With robotic arms, follow along
And we've seen it all before
I've seen who dreams deflate
Seven feet, sell and wait
On the block like she daring the paint
Going hard with the eight in ball, call it the same thing
Nah, thats a different world
We just, we just in a jungle
Lions, Orangutans, and the Bangabangs
I'm just getting the hang of things

[Hook - EarthGang]
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit

[Verse 2 - Doctor Dot]
Didn't have a pot to piss in
I pissed in the parking lot
Put my dick in the tightest twat
Leave a victim in God's garage
The definitive intersection where heaven and hell collide
Purgatory, not a story
This really where I reside
So you better just pay your tithes
Better just prey that I don't develop a taste for flesh with engage and my appetite
Sorry Mrs. Parker, but your baby boys a mutant
And he belongs in the sewer with Turanga Leila folk
Put this poison in his system now he wouldn't even know
And then they tried to prick my skin, and then the fucking heater broke
So now I'm a Chupacabara fuckin' wildebeests at every show
Feel the need to lose control
Feel that neep off in my soul
Dump that dick off, dome that hoe
Feel like Hoperounds in the fold before he had that single that just fucking killed the radio
Now niggas hustle 'ustle just to try and fuck a hust of fo'
I'm that dreamy bohemian, still I get them out their clothes
Got em' screamin' and screamin' whenever I provide the stroke
And I be scheming with DJ and selling these just to get this dough
Rest in peace my nigga Dro, rest in peace that Allan watch
Hit the East like every week and then run up the mountain side
Who's that peeping in my window?
Shut the fuck up, close the blinds
"He's a genius! He's a genius!" But I don't believe these guys
All these demons in my skull, every time I close my eyes
I can keep it intosoective, you won't keep me in your life

[Hook - EarthGang]
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin' shit
Ye ain't' talkin', Ye ain't' talkin' shit

[Verse 3 - Johnny Venus]
Spitting bottles rippin' by the ceiling fan
Drifting out is so appealing when you drowning for the millions
Put myself together with the beat piece by piece
Hit the bank, real sheik
