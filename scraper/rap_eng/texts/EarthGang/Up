[Intro: Johnny Venus]
Just another day in these filthy sweet Atlanta streets
Back on a greenback hunt

[Bridge: Johnny Venus]
One for the money and two for the loot
You want to run with boo best tie your shoe
I make all your dreams and nightmares come true
I've got all that I want, now I've got you

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
To get back on your feet like giraffe, elephant, a kangaroo
Can't come through with these puppets
'Less you cool, 'less you know the who's who
You're in my world now, I make the rules
I say who lives, I say who die, I save the kids
I push the button, delete the crew
Call me John Q, call me Olu

[Bridge: Johnny Venus]
Bitches I've arrived, oh
Wait for the motherfuckin' gang

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus + Johnny Venus & Doctur Dot]
See I go loco for my freedom
It's the only thing that's real these days
No fear, no shame, matter fact let's get this straight
That ain't no rapper (nooo)
See triumph comes from dyin'
Sometime joy comes from cryin'
Sometime healing come from killin'
Rich shit, nigga shit, climb on up, die for
Rich shit, nigga shit, climb on up, never fold
Rich shit, nigga shit, climb on up, die for
Rich shit, nigga shit, climb on up, never fold

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Yeah I'm up
You pussies thought that I was down, no, no, no
Yeah I'm up
I gotta gotta, I gotta gotta, I gotta gotta
Gotta say that I'm up
Said I'm up

[Bridge: Doctur Dot]
Okay, rollin' dice, baby needed new pair of shoes
Famous overnight
Nigga these people don't care 'bout you
Came up in the jungle
Gotta bail my partners out the zoo
What's the price of love?
Can't think about that, Mike Tyson, do it
Rolling dice, baby needed new pair of shoes
Famous overnight
Nigga these people don't care 'bout you
Came up in the jungle
Gotta bail my partners out the zoo
What's the price of love?

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
Okay look, paid dues, no more fake news
I'ma do everything that they said that I can't do
Miss me with that artificial
Baby I ain't fooled by the filters or the angles
You don't know yourself, when you come into some wealth
You the type to let it change you
I say make money don't let money make you
Mothafucka let her talk about all he ever wanted like he ever met her
While the house sit back and collect the debt up
Oh I bet you thought your ass was educated
Oh I bet you thought that you escaped the message
Lyin' to yourself, you the greatest actor
Round of applause, round of applause
Geminis, two-faced, Cancer, I got claws
Life is a cartoon I did not draw
Take a hiatus put in their palm
I always had a certain je ne sais quoi
Pull up on your bitch like, "Excuse my French"
Fuck what you thought
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Ce-soir, take no days off
Ain't no problem that I can't solve what you made off with

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Yeah I'm up
You pussies thought that I was down, no no no
Yeah I'm up
I gotta gotta, I gotta gotta, I gotta gotta
Gotta say that I'm up
Said I'm up
