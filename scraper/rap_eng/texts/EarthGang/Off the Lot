[Chorus: EarthGang]
I went out and bought the best car my money could buy
Asked yo baby mama if she ready to ride
Swervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai
Please don't run up on it unless you ready to die
I went out and bought the best car my money could buy
Asked yo baby mama if she ready to ride (Is she ready? Is she ready?)
Swervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai
Please don't run up on it unless you ready to die

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Poverty stricken, hot wings was kickin'
Grew up with God and grew up with nada
Ain't that a bitch? So I married her too
Spiritual folks don't eat good
Clearin' my throat as I bless the food
Almighty God, how the fuck you help these killers boss up?
Make they bread while our neighborhood filmin' Walkin' Dead
Bow our heads shit, we split a P between all us
We was in them church buildings, they was robbin' us silly
Came home, only thing they left us was the ceilings
Quick reminder, the finer things in life are the hideous inside
My nigga that's a lie, that's a mind fuck
That's a brain rape
Sellin' waters for a dolla', hope my niggas don't see us
Speak about it at the school, watch how quick I bust a lip
Red light, catch me outside 28's and up
I just wanna be that nigga that they look up to for once

[Chorus: EarthGang]
I went out and bought the best car my money could buy
Asked yo baby mama if she ready to ride
Swervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai
Please don't run up on it unless you ready to die

[Bridge: Mereba]
I'm in a dope boy game, oh, in a dope boy lane, oh
Rockin' dope boy frames, oh, boy your dope don't change
In a dope boy game, oh, in a dope boy lane, oh
Rockin' dope boy frames, oh, boy your dope don't change

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
I only got five in the tank
Two slow leaks on the right side
Key scratches on the paint, stick shift on the fritz
I'm like fuck this whip, can't bag no hoes like this
I'm on my Go Go Gadget, movin' through jungle traffic
I was a hoodrat magnet, I had to drop old habits
My cousin went to war at nineteen
He started a family whippin' that truck
He got attacked, we just glad he made it back
First thing that nigga did scooped that E-Class Benz
Turn a humble family function to another event
And we been neck and neck since we was kids, you know what that meant
After we signed to the 'ville, right to the auction I went
So what would you rather get nigga, a car or a crib?
Got released from them leases, never again payin' rent
We all suffer through struggle, you never know the extent
Catch me on Old Nat' and Godby, never forget where I been

[Chorus: EarthGang]
I went out and bought the best car my money could buy
Asked yo baby mama if she ready to ride
Swervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai
Please don't run up on it unless you ready to die
I went out and bought the best car my money could buy
Asked yo baby mama if she ready to ride
Swervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai
Please don't run up on it unless you ready to die
