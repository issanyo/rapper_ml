[Intro: Roxy]
Yas, Helen Keller!

[Verse 1: Manila Luzon]
I got ProNails on my toenails
With the weave cut down to my coat tails
When the boat sails, get ready
Line up the eyeliner, steady
Where's my foundation? I'm impatient
My rice gets sticky when my man's on probation
I give him yellow fever, a believer
Hand on the stick of my pink two-seater
He can't get enough of this siamese kitty cat
He can't stick into an itty bitty Jimmy hat
He's my Bruce Lee, don't stop me
Get the fuck off me, brew me some coffee
Let the bygones be bygones, queen of Saigon
McQueen nylons, face by Kryolan
Don't try me, honey
I go to jail, I got bail money

[Hook: Cazwell]
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her
I don't see her, Helen Keller

[Verse 2: Cazwell]
Someone call Candy Finnigan
My addiction's about to begin again
Got my balls slappin' on your chin again
For longer than Gone With The Wind again, then again
Called it quits, chopped your head
Zipped you up in a Space Bag under my bed
Now I know where you are when I need you
Break out the braille, Helen Keller gonna read you (ooh!)
I don't see her, I don't hear her either
I disappear toward the sun in Ibiza
Layin' outside where the tall palm trees are
Givin' y'all more dark marks where your knees are
You went from my Green Room to the steam room
Kicked your ass out the house cause I need room
Now I got that bitch locked in the cellar
That's why I don't see her, Helen Keller

[Hook: Roxy]
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her
I don't see her, Helen Keller

[Verse 3: Manila Luzon]
Fuck It Gets Better, it gets gorgeous
Patience thin, heart enormous
My girls in the club, can't ignore us
Track just dropped, learn the chorus
Champagne for effervescence
F train under bright fluroscents
Lipstick, fuck anti-depressants
Wash my hair with Herbal Essence
Don't see me? Out of luck, boss
Layer this beat, extra duck sauce
Sip that lovin', spread that muffin
Heat that bun in a Easy-Bake Oven
Boys on my mind, coins on my mind
Annoyed by my grind, I'm one of a kind
Eye of the tiger, Leo my sign
Wanna sip this cider? Get in line, bitch

[Verse 4: Cazwell]
Rewind, bitch, my time, bitch
See me on Twitter, Instagram and Vine, bitch
Fuck with me? That's a hella nope
You couldn't see me with a telescope
The only Dial you'll be getting is some yellow soap
To wash that ratchet ass twice, I know I'm nice (listen)
I admit I'm a bit vain
That's cause I'm the shit, you a shit stain
Cheat twice then split, ain't shit changed
Cut the crap like that, ain't shit strange?
All I need is my name, I don't wanna clear it
All you want is fame, but ain't nowhere near it
Wanna play a love game, I don't wanna hear it
Plus you dead to me now, and I don't talk to spirits
Still trill, ill will, fresh on kilter
Picture that, #nofilter

[Hook: Cazwell]
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her
I don't see her, Helen Keller

[Outro: Roxy]
We're done. I don't see you, I don't hear you
We're through. I've Helen Kellered your ass
Buh-bye!
