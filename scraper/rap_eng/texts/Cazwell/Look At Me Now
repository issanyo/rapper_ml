I used to get thrown on the ground
I used to walk with my head down
I used to be afraid of making a sound
But look at me now, look at me now

Never was considered cool
Got beat up, dropped out of school
Where I went, I was made the fool
But look at me now, look at me now

You don't get me
But you don't need to
You can read me
'Cause I don't see you
All I know is my future's bright
And I gotta get ready to go out tonight

Look at me now
I'm feeling much better than fine
You can get behind me
Look at me now
Ain't nothin' gonna get me down
You can't get me down
Look at me now
Got the wind up against my back
You can't hold me back
Look at me now
I'm the queen of the universe
Yeah, you heard it first

High heels on, got my hair done
High heels on, got my hair...
High heels on, got my hair done
Got my new dress
And my nails lookin' flawless
You could say that I'm hard to match
I gotta cute day look
And a plane to catch
I must say that I look better than ever
Don't wish that I'm out of the weather
I'm not the same girl I was before
I'm a brand new woman that you adore

You can't knock me, so don't try it
When this track drops, you'll go buy it
Stand strong, and I'm only getting stronger
Take a picture cause it will last longer

Look at me now
I'm feeling much better than fine
You can get behind me
Look at me now
Ain't nothin' gonna get me down
You can't get me down
Look at me now
Got the wind up against my back
You can't hold me back
Look at me now
I'm the queen of the universe
Yeah, you heard it first

(2x)
And now I walk with my head up
I got no time to get fed up
I got no worries, I got no plans
Don't need no man
Cause I got my friends

(2x)
Look at me now
I'm feeling much better than fine
You can get behind me
Look at me now
Ain't nothin' gonna get me down
You can't get me down

Look at me now
Got the wind up against my back
You can't hold me back
Look at me now
I'm the queen of the universe
Yeah, you heard it first

Look at me now
I'm feeling much better than fine
You can get behind me
Look at me now
Ain't nothin' gonna get me down
You can't get me down
Got the wind up against my back
You can't hold me back
Look at me now
I'm the queen of the universe
Yeah, you heard it first.
