Watch my mouth
Read my lips
Shake that ass
And move your hips
Watch my mouth
Read my lips
Watch my mouth, watch my mouth

Watch my mouth
Do you see what I'm sayin'?
Watch my mouth
You know we ain't playin'
Watch my mouth
Your booty's obeying
Watch my mouth, watch my mouth

Let's get the party started
On the floor
'Cos if ya paid the cover
That's what ya came for
Shake that asset
Move your feet
And watch me get it started
To the west end beat
If you like it
Lick it
Slurb it
Slide it
Shake it
Bake it
Stir it
Fry it
Scream my name out
As you ride it
(I'm so excited and I just can't hide it)

DJ drop the needle and (turn it up)
Jump on the dance floor and (stir it up)
Just take what is down and (work it up)
(Honey 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

Watch my mouth
Read my lips

And move your hips
Watch my mouth
Read my lips
Watch my mouth, watch my mouth

Watch my mouth
Do you see what I'm sayin'?
Watch my mouth
You know we ain't playin'
Watch my mouth
Your booty's obeying
Watch my mouth

Watch my mouth
See what I'm talking about
From another small town
To the dirty south
From the east coast playa's
Who are drinkin' wine
To the west coast playa's
Workin' on their tan line
That's party on
The kids are gone
Rolled up
Passed out
On your
Mamma's lawn
Not even your folks
Would get up in this
Let's get busy
Like it's no ones business

DJ drop the needle and (turn it up)
Jump on the dance floor and (stir it up)
Just take what is down and (work it up)
(Honey 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

Watch my mouth
You know we ain't playin'
Watch my mouth
Your booty's obeying
Watch my mouth, watch my mouth

Shake that asset
Move your feet
And keep on
Stepping to the beat (alright!)
Let's get loose
Up down
Down down
Move your arms
Over your feet
And spin around

Shake that asset
Move your feet
And keep on
Stepping to the beat (get down, down)
Let's get loose
Up down
Down down
Move your arms
Over your feet
And spin around
