Give me tonight
Then if you don't want to stay
Girl I'll just forget you

You'll see I'm right
You won't get to do away
Love ain't gonna let you

Give me tonight

I'm gonna write you a love song
A long one
A super strong one
You're gonna fall in love with me
You'll find out
Wait and see

I'm gonna keep you in my reach
Hold your hand walking on the beach
Whisper in your ear
Tell you you're the one
Sit back, lay down, in the sun

[:: Chorus ::]
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna hold you
You're gonna want me too
I'm gonna be your night and day
Hang on to every word you say

I'm gonna be your Superman
Convince you with my super plan
I've got to keep you in my sites
Baby, just give me one more night

[:: Chorus ::]
Can't eat and I
Can't sleep at night
Count sheeps sweatin' in the sheets
I got cold feet sweaty palms
My cell on vibrate with the volume on
Up till dawn, nights gone
Drive by your place
Lights on
When I see your face
I'm gone
I wrote a love poem should I recite one

I used to be the guy that you adored
Now I'm startin' to feel slightly ignored
I know you see me on the caller ID when I call at 3 with no place to be
You get my emails and my pages too
And the note is stuck on your door with crazy glue
If I knew that you called without a thing to do
Without leavin' a clue you'd be crazy too

[:: Chorus ::]
