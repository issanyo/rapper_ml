Manila Luzon:
Yaaaaaassssss
Helen Keller!

I got pro nails
On my toe nails
With a weave cut down
To my coat tails
When the boat sails
Get ready
Line up the eyeliner
Steady

Where's my foundation?
I'm impatient
My rice gets sticky
When my man's on probation
I give him yellow fever
A believer
Hand on the stick
Of my pink
Two-seater

He can't get enough
Of this siamese
Kitty cat
He can't stick into an
Itty bitty jimmy hat
He's my Bruce Lee
Don't stop me
Get the fuck off me
Brew me
Some coffee

Let the by gones
Be my gones
Queen of Siagon
McQueen nylons
Face by Kryolan
Don't try me hunny
I'll go to jail
I got rail money

Cazwell:
I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her
Helen Keller

I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her
Helen Keller

Someone call Candy Finigan
My addictions
About to begin again
Got my balls slapin'
On your chin again

For longer than
Gone with the wind again
Then
Again

Called it quits
Chopped your head
Zipped you up in a space bag
Under my bed
Now I know
Where you are
When I need you
Break out the brail
Helen Keller
Gonna read you

I don't see her
I don't hear her either
I disapeared to the sun in Abiza
Layin' outside
Where
The tall palm trees
Are

Givin' y'all more
Dark marks
Where your knees are
Ya went from my green room
To the steam room
Kicked your ass
Out the house
'Cuz I need room

Now I got that bitch
Locked in the cellar
That's why I don't see her
Helen Keller

I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her
Helen Keller

I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her
Helen Keller

Manila Luzon:
Fuck it gets better
It gets gorgeous
Patience thin
Heart enormous
My girls in the club
Can't ignore us
Track just dropped
Learn the chorus

Champagne
For effervescence
F train
Under bright flourescents
Lipstick fuck anti depresents
Wash my hair with Herbal Essence

Don't see me
Outta luck boss
Layer this beat
Extra duck sauce
Get that lovin'
Spread that muffin
Heat the run
In an easy bake oven

Boys on my mind, coins on my mind
Annoyed by my grind
I'm one of a kind
Eye of the tiger
Leo my sign
Wanna sip this cider?
Get in line bitch!

Cazwell:
Rewind bitch
My time bitch
See me on twitter
Instagram and vine, bitch

Fuck with me?
That's a hella nope
You couldn't see me
With a telescope

The only dial you'll be gettin'
Is some yellow soap
To wash that rachet ass twice
I know I'm nice
(Listen)
I admit I'm a bit vain
That's 'cuz I'm in the shit
You a shit stain
Cheat twice then split
Ain't she changed
Caught the clap like that
Ain't shit strange

All I need is my name
I don't wanna clear it
All you want is fame
But ain't no where near it

Wanna play a love game
I don't wanna hear it
Plus you dead to me now
And I don't talk to spirits

Still trill
Ill will
Fresh on kilter
Picture that
Hashtag
No filter

I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her
Helen Keller

I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her
Helen Keller
I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her
Helen Keller

[Manila Luzon:]
We're done
I don't see you
I don't hear you
We're through
I've helen kellered
Your ass
Buh-by!
