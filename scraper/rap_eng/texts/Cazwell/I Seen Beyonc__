I seen Beyonce at Burger King
She ordered two cheeseburgers with onion rings
She got a chocolate shake, and a side of fries
Chicken strips, with apple pies
Yeah, I seen Beyonce at Burger King
She ordered two cheeseburgers with onion rings
She got a chocolate shake, and a side of fries
And she looked dead in my eyes and she says
"Can I borrow ten dollars? I left my purse in the car
In the car
It's parked three blocks away and baby that's just too far
Too far"
"Okay, but you gotta pay me back if you borrow
And have my ten dollars when I see you tomorrow
No acting funny"
Said "Caz, would I lie to you?"
Then smiled, then snatched my money and said

I seen Beyonce at JC Penney
She rolled up in a '94 Chevy
She screeched up in the handicap
Applying chapstick with her B-phone on her lap
She says "Can you watch my car?
I gotta run in to buy a quick something
For me and my man"
I said "I can, but you still owe me ten ducket"
She rolled her eyes and said "fuck it", I said

[Cazwell:]
I seen Beyonce at the liquor store
She completely ignored me walking through the door
She had her Freakum Dress on
From the House of Dereon
And was patting her weave ladies with her palm
She was looking around for some customer service
I walked up to her and made security nervous
She says "How much for a case of beer?"
I says "Girl, are you drunk? I don't work here!"
