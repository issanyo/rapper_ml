[Verse 1: Debbie D.]
The Latin explosion ain't new to me
I've been into foreskin since puberty
I want an uncut latino with a libido the size of Reno
Nevada to bang me 'till my bladder splatters
A dick fatter than a beer can
Lay down, stand, or in the back of his van
He sports Tommy, Adidas, FUBU, Timberland
Pinky ring on his hand
His wish is my command
I'll suck his dick on the can or on the Puerto Rican sand
That's my man with the nice clean fade
And when he gets paid, I get paid
And when I get laid, I'm glad he stayed
Cuz there's nothin' I like more than foreskin
I drop my chin so I can fit it all in
And then he eats my ass like he eats rice and beans
Until the plate's clean
You know what I mean?

[Verse 2: Cazwell]
Yes I do
Just the other day I got a blowjob from a ho job with no job
Seen him at the bar battin' his eyelashes
Show me where your cash is, I'll show where my stash is
His ass is on my bed
Head board hit his head 'till his head turned red
In and out was the motion
KY was the lotion
And that's the way it goes, girl
When you fuck until your toes curl
I rocked his world with mad stamina
Hot like panama
Shot like an enema
I'm sending your ass back to the store to get some rubbers
So I can change the covers

[Chorus:Avenue D]
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need

[Verse 3: Daphne D. and (Cazwell)]
Well it won't be long before he takes off my thong
(But it wasn't a thong until you put it on)
Shut the fuck up! I'm the one getting laid here
He's back from the bodega with a case of beer
And a bag of weed
So I'm on my knees
Pulling out the seeds
He wants to squeeze
My 34Bs
Until I can't breathe
Someone pass the poppers and a bottle of lube
Before he bangs me from the back with that rough rider attitude
The routine, we fuck on the rug so his sheets stay clean
Damn
My man is heaven sent
He got me horny like the ex-president
Just thinking of my man's big dick in my face
And then he comes in my face
And then runs out of the place
I don't care, he'll be back
Cuz he loves this ass
And when he's done
His friends'll be over fast
You got a problem with me?
You should get your ass off of Avenue D

[Verse 4: Cazwell and (Avenue D)]
See you like the type of guy that works at the pizza place
Sweat on his face
Moustache above his lips
Open shirt, gold chain, and a cruxifix
I like the type of guy that's the East Vil style
Chill for a while if he's versatile
But the bottom direction
Give me his ass and give me affection
Did I happen to mention
(No I don't think you did)
Well I like to keep my man in the 718
Cuz I'm in 212 and got things to do
(Like what?)
Like whatever
Wanna leave this with no shame behind me
But all I see is his name on my caller ID
Which reminds me
Of the time we
Took three ecstacy
You know one thing leads to another
I see him on the weekends
(What about the weekdays?)
That's when I'm busy messin' with his brother

[Chorus:Avenue D]
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need

[Chorus:Avenue D]
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
