I wake up everyday between 2:00 and 3:00
I roll out of bed between 3:00 and 4:00
I stare in the mirror from 4:00 to 5:00
And from 5:00 to 5:30 I thank god I'm alive
I put on my lipstick, my makeup, my hair up, my shadow and blush
Tease my hair with a brush
I spray my perfume from head to toe
Grab my purse and sunglasses and I'm ready to go

And you might think I'm crazy
But you don't even know me
And if you think I'm crazy, Well then I'm crazy, Well then I'm crazy
But I'm doin' my way, I'm doin' it my way, My way, my way, my way, my way, I'm doing it my way, I'm doin' it my way
That's the only way I do it, there I did it, now it's done

I drink champagne, eat caviar
In the back of a car, like a movie star
Gotta catch my plane and then I'm gone
To London, Paris, France, Milan
That's how it goes, my stylist sews
I wear the clothes to fashion shows
I got a man to my left, got a man to my right
And I live like a goddamn socialite

But I'm doin' my way, I'm doin' it my way, My way, my way, my way, my way, I'm doing it my way, I'm doin' it my way
That's the only way I do it, there I did it, now it's done

I'm doin' it and doin' it and doin' it...

Yeah, I'm doin' it my way, gonna say my thing
If you want it your way go to Burger King
'Cause I live my way, or I'll die my way
In a pink Cadillac flyin' down the highway
And I walk my way, and I talk my way
Put my boyfriend's parents in shock my way
And I'll sink my way or I'll swim my way
High heels when I work out at the gym my way

I'm doin' my way, I'm doin' it my way, My way, my way, my way, my way, I'm doin' my way, I'm doin' it my way, My way, my way, my way, my way

I'm doin' it and doin' it and doin' it...

That's the only way I do it, there I did it, now it's done
