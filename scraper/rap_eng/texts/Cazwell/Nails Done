All I wanna do is get my nails done
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do
All I wanna do is get my nails done, hun
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do

All I wanna do is get my nails done
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do
All I wanna do is get my nails done, hun
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do

It's sunday afternoon I got one thing on my mind
Manicure, pedicure, my nails lookin' fine
Luscious berry on my fingertips
Nail polish and brush i come equipped
My favorite colors lined up in a row
Nail polish on my fingers and toes
After I get my press ons pressed on
Put my nails in the dryer and then I'm gone

All I wanna do is get my nails done
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do
All I wanna do is get my nails done, hun
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do

All I wanna do is get my nails done
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do
All I wanna do is get my nails done, hun
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do

Brush from the cutical to the tips
Less is more so it don't drip
Blow on then lightly not too hard
Don't want them to chip my credit card
I like my nails strong and glossy
So they don't break when i push the boys off me
I'm a red nails kind of girl
Watch my fingers curl
Goddamn,I'm takin' over the world

This is how it sounds when I'm impatient
You don't want to keep this lady waiting
This is how it sounds when I'm impatient
You don't want to keep this lady waiting

Girl you know you got it goin' on
Like you just stepped out of a salon
Times are gettin' hard
You were lookin' all that butch
Stole my credit card
Got your nails done in flat bush
The boys ain't callin' back to boot
Chew you up spit you out like juicy fruit
Just keep it cute and I'll do the same
You got eight credit cards not one in your name
A Brooklyn girl in a material world
Nails did, brows waxed and your hair in curls
Lookin' like a fly chick, keepin' your thighs thick
Reach in your hand bag and pull out your sidekick
Things to do, places to be
You know who's who, got people to see
Your real real hard to keep it fresh and pretty
On the JMZ train into the city.

[Roxy Cottontail]
Looking this good don't come for free
We pimp empires like a PhD
Naomi Yasuda, the yakuza of pretty
Number one nail artist up in New York City
So many boys wanna touch these hands
Kiss these rings, tryna make plans
The diva dawn daughters of the New York scene
Amanda and Roxy, official party queens
Hold cold in the club at night
Sparkle all day, we always keep it tight
Pink work golds on them fingertips
Swarovski crystals, read our lips
All we're gonna do is get our nails done tight
Longer and stronger, bigger and bright
The Cottontail's nails never fails
Gotta keep it cute down to the toenails.

All I wanna do is get my nails done
Nails done, nails done, nails done, nails done
All I wanna do is get my nails done
Nails done, nails done, nails done, nails done.
