I love that you don't care
What people think about me
I love that you don't care
What people think about you
I could care less as long as we are together
I'm gonna be wrapped around your finger forever

I gave him my number, and he called me back
I left a long message, and he called me back
When he calls me right back
You know he comes right over
I'm gonna see him every day over and over
I finally met this guy
And he understands me
He's soft and he's sweet like cotton candy
Like cotton candy, cotton candy

I met his mother and his brother
And his sister and his father
And his aunts and his uncles
And his cousin's best friend
They're gonna come see me play
At Madison Square Garden
They're gonna lift their glasses
Say a toast for me and

I gave him my number, and he called me back
I left a long message, and he called me back
When he calls me right back
You know he comes right over
I'm gonna see him every day over and over
I finally met this guy
And he understands me
He's soft and he's sweet like cotton candy
Like cotton candy, cotton candy

You know, I remember the first time
I laid eyes on you
And you laid eyes on me
And we could both tell
Something major was about to happen
And thank God it did

I gave him my number
And then he called me back
And then I gave him my number
And then he called me back
Then he called me back

And I finally met this guy
And he understands me
And he's soft and he's sweet like cotton candy
He's really, really sweet, and he's not demanding
He's soft and he's sweet like cotton candy
Like cotton candy, cotton candy
Cotton candy, cotton candy
