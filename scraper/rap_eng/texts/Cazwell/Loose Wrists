[Intro]
Uuh, daddy
Uhh, daddy
Uhh, daddy
Uhh

[Chorus]
Loose wrists, pink Timbs
Gold teeth, low brims
Heavy chain, thick skin
Foreskin, five men
All slay, all femme
Pretty boy, M&M
Candy coated M&M's
We're about to make America femme again

[Verse 1]
It's a new year, onto major things
Bring that heat, flame some things
Hit the White House, rearrange some things
Smack 'em in a new dimension, Stranger Things
Open my mouth, always offend 'em
Give me ten rules and I always bend them
My record label don't like a thing I send 'em
Got me thinking I should go independent
I'm a big boss, big balls on a phone call
With a big bite, strong jaws, I'm a pitbull
(I'm a big boss, big balls on a phone call
With a big bite, strong jaws, I'm a pitbull)

[Pre-chrous]
Uuh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, yeah

[Chorus]
Loose wrists, pink Timbs
Gold teeth, low brims
Heavy chain, thick skin
Foreskin, five men
All slay, all femme
Pretty boy, M&M
Candy coated M&M's
We're about to make America femme again

[Verse 2]
I broke the mould, I cracked the code
I went against everything I've been told
I hear, "Hey Cazwell, you're a fucking star!"
Said damn, you don't even know how right you are
Got a few bones to pick, operation
You fuckboys need a job application
Stunt queens in my DMs, listen
If you new to year old, then you catfishin'
If we've already met, I must have amnesia
He's on my front door like a ordered a pizza
Got a condom on my dick, nuclear code
Then I blow up that ass like I got nuclear codes
Imma dust ya, mop ya, wipe up the crew
Yeah I got the house work watchu, watchu, watchu gon' do?
Imma dust ya, mop ya, wipe up the crew
(Yeah I got the house work watchu, watchu, watchu gon' do?)

[Chorus]
Loose wrists, pink Timbs
Gold teeth, low brims
Heavy chain, thick skin
Foreskin, five men
All slay, all femme
Pretty boy, M&M
Candy coated M&M's
We're about to make America femme again

Uuh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, yeah
Uuh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, daddy (What's up, baby?)
Uhh, yeah

[Outro]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, daddy
Uhh, yeah
