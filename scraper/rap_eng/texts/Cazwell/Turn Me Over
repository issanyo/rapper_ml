[Music Video Intro: Amanda Lepore]
You know, being a diva
I get to travel all around the world
And I meet the most handsome men
But nobody, nobody
Turns me on like Brasil.

I seen him at the club
He was lookin' real nice
Real nice, real nice, real nice
He smelled real good, was he wearin' Old Spice?
Hell no. Hell no. Hell no.
He came up to me
And he asked for my name
And he asked for my number
I hope you don't mind
But I got a lover, and I'd like another

(2x)
Turn me on, turn me over,
My boyfriend's gone so come on over,
Turn me on, turn me over
My boyfriend's gone, let's get it on

Turn me on, turn me over (2x)

Once we got into my place
My place, my place, my place
My lipstick was all over his face
All over his face
I knew what he wanted
He wanted to push it
Push it, push
He was all over me like an octopus
Like an octopus

(2x)
Turn me on, Turn me over,
My boyfriend's gone, so come on over,
Turn me on, Turn me over
My boyfriend's gone, let's get it on

Turn me on, turn me over (2x)

Yeah like that, yeah like that
Yeah like that
Like that, like that, like that

Yeah baby
I like it when you keep doing things like that
Just keep doing things this way
Now I want you to work with me
Are you ready?
At the count of three
I want you to do it my way, all right?
Are you paying attention? Are you with me?
1-2.. 1-2-3 OK.

(4x)
Lick it, stick it
Flip it, bang it
Rub it, fuck it
Turn me on.
Lick it, stick it
Flip it, bang it
Rub it, fuck it
Turn me over.
