Take me to your mama's for dinner
Take me to your mama's for rice and beans
Take me to your mama's for dinner
When I show up twice she'll know what that means

Hola, Amigo
Pollo con sofrito
Blowin' up my libido
Explodin' my torpedo
Take me to 191 & St. Nicholas
You got it ridiculous
*laughs* Watch out, I'm ticklish

Toss your ensalada
Stuff your empinada
I like a big umbrella on my Pina Colada
With Jorge, Ricardo, Cesar, Eduardo
Let's make the sweat drip on el piso majado

Take me to your mama's for dinner
Take me to your mama's for rice and beans
Take me to your mama's for dinner
When I show up twice she'll know what that means

Take me to your mama's for dinner

When I show up twice she'll know what that means

Hola, Amigo
Pollo son soy frio
Blowin' up my libido
Explodin' my torpedo
If I knew how to get you out of those jeans
We'd be ripping the seams
From Spanish Harlem to Queens
Bass drums, I got it
Condoms, I brought it
My *groans*, I shot it
You're the host
With the most
We got dos platanos
We're spreading muslos
Like it's butter on toast

Take me to your mama's for dinner
(Alright, I'm ready)
Take me to your mama's for rices and beans
(Know what I mean)
Take me to your mama's for dinner
(Alright, I'm ready)
When I show up twice she'll know what that means
(So what's it mean?)
