I don't know much about clothes, but my hair looks fierce!

I don't know much about
Much about
Much about
Much about
Much about clothes and things
I just talk about
Talk about
Talk about
Talkin to my friends when my cell phone rings
I don't care about this that
This that
This that
The other, what you talkin about?
I just show up
All done up
Dance
Do my thing
Get paid and i'm out!

I don't know much about clothes but my hair looks fierce!

When you talk all i hear is wasay blah blah
Wasay blah blah blah
Take me to my car!
Got a 50 foot stretch limousine
Color creme
Jocelyn wildenstein at my minibar
I got friends in high places with plastic faces
Boys in braces wanna change their races
I can't stop
Cuz i won't stop
The party starts as soon as my dress drops!

(4x)
I don't know much about clothes but my hair looks fierce!

Cazwell:
We are live in hollywood on the red carpet with amanda lepore
Can you tell us amanda, who made your dress?

Amanda:
Some mexican children in an la sweatshop
Who work nonstop until their heads drop
They weren't allowed food or water to drink
But they still did a fierce job don't you think?

Cazwell:
Yes i do

Amanda:
Thank you!

Cazwell:
Now about that dress

Amanda:
Forget the dress let's talk about my breasts!

Cazwell:
Speaking of breast implants, what did paris hilton do?

Amanda:
Paris who?

Cazwell:
It's cazwell with amanda lepore being seen
Inbetween david lachapelle on her cell
With peir amanda's thing got her story to tell
Page 6 you know the routine
It's all about the breast
Its the point done up in a heatherette dress
I call off the attitude till the drinks get closer
Yo hold orange juice and mama mosa
I get closer to the body by the minute na minute ma bumpa dong ding
At this joint you can't quit it cuz me and main chick are never alone
Cuz i split through two blades of silicone
We drink champagne
Give your kids the beers
Me and my cats swing from the chandalliers
All i here is ching ching
And my ears are ring ring
And this year this beat is all on yall sucka too it
