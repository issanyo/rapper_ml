Yeah, you got my lips and you got my eyes
And you still got my cellphone
No surprise
And you got your own key to my hotel room
And you just quit your job on 7th Avenue

But hey
We're gonna make it anyway
But hey
We're gonna make it anyway
And if anyone tries to come between us
Just jump in my spaceship
We're gonna fly to Venus, yeah

I'm gonna love you down (8x)

You own half of my head
Half of my twin bed
Let's call the drug dealers
Stay in and play dead
I'm gonna try on all my of my dresses
You can tell me which one you think the best is

But hey
We're gonna make it anyway
But hey
We're gonna make it anyway
And if I catch you with some other chick
I'm gonna watch you'll get my name tattooed on your dick, yeah

I'm gonna love you down (8x)

Yeah
I'm gonna love you down (8x)
