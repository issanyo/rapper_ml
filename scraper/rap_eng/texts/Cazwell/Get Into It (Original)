[Amanda Lepore:]
Get into it, get into it, get into it...
Get into it, get into it, get into it...
Get into it, get into it, get into it...

[Cazwell:]
Yeah, all the fresh kids know my name by now
I'm the C.A.Z , W.E., whatever
This beat is clever
I'm a freak forever
My wallets getting fat
But you already knew that
Some of you love me
And some of you hate me
Some wanna date me
Some wanna date rape me
I'm trashy and flashy and feelin' fine
Hittin' in the K holes in 99
Just press rewind
To see what I'm seein'
I get a kiss on both cheeks European (ooh)
Black, white, Puertorican, interracial
Manicure, pedicure, aim for my facial
I stretch my rhymes like an elastic
And I clean for kicks is fantastic
This club scene drama I'm past it
You're a trend about to end
I'm classic

[Cazwell:]
It's club scene drama
It's club scene drama
It's club scene drama
It's club scene drama

[Amanda Lepore:]
Get into it, Get into it
(You want it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Get on it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Flawless baby)
Get into it, into it
Into it, into it

Get into it, Get into it
(You want it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Get on it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Flawless baby)
Get into it, into it
Into it, into it

[Cazwell:]
We went from vaiders to DVD players
Shootin' space invaders eliquant tomb raiders
Clipon pagers to motorola razors
All these pre interpratators
Callin' teasin' aligators
All these haters
Are just impersonators
If you can't rock the mic
Without ducking from teenaders
We come familiar to your face turns blue
Only 2 times 2 like your under my shoe
This track played out like a tribal tattoo
On 8th avenue
Sad but true
I'm newer than new
And nower than now
And if you wanna get into what I'm talking about
I said it before
When I walked through the door
From Amandaliere to Amanda Lepore

[Together:]
Get into it, Get into it
(You want it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Get on it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Flawless baby)
Get into it, into it
Into it, into it

Get into it, Get into it
(You want it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Get on it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Flawless baby)
Get into it, into it
Into it, into it

[Amanda Lepore:]
Get into these lips
Get into these hips
I get into my champagne (sip by sip)
You sit next to me
And you ask for my number
The clubs I work and how much is the cover
I'm a blonde nuematic with one thing on my mind
My hair piece (so do not touch the hair please)
I'd like a chair please
It's time to perch
I rock on the go go box but it hurts
Here's how it works
You heard of me
Drag queen stands to me in Germany
I got major fans in Amsterdam
Club hits in Japan, know who I am
I'm the number one transsexual on the planet
And you can't stand it
Goddamn it
Respect I demand, and my two best friends
With my Christian Louboutin's 110's

[Amanda Lepore:]
Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt...

[Together:]
Get into it, Get into it
(You want it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Get on it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Flawless baby)
Get into it, into it
Into it, into it

Get into it, Get into it
(You want it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Get on it baby)
Get into it, Get into it
(Flawless baby)
Get into it, into it
Into it, into it...
(Into It, into It)

[Cazwell:]
You want it baby
Uh-huh, right there
Yeah, uh-huh
Take that
Uh-huh
