[Intro: Amanda Lepore & M.Y.A.]
Are you gonna go my way?
(Are you gonna go my way?)
Are you going downtown?
(You can paint my town)
If you're going my way
(If you're going my way)
There's no turning around
(Unless you mess up my gown)

[Chorus]
Do you want to ride in my convertible?
Vertical
Go forward or reversible
'Cause you're going my way
Do you want to ride in my convertible?
Workable
The back seat is preferable
Bang my bumper today (hello, hello)

[Post-Chorus]
Are you gonna go my way?
(Are you gonna go my way?)
Are you going downtown?
(You can paint my town)
If you're going my way
(If you're going my way)
There's no turning around
(Unless you mess up my gown)

[Verse 1: M.Y.A.]
Top down on this candy paint
Interior Red, Exterior Pink
You can be my personal Mr. Miyagi
Boy wax on, wax off then get off me
Time to get it revved up
12 cylinders in my engine
I can throw it back like Atari
Speed it up like Ferrari, hot like safari
You know you want this
Better drive it like you own it
Semi automatic either way you could have it
But a stick shift is a bonus
I'm a show, don't do recitals
Like my doors I'm suicidal
If you don't pack a bigger rifle
We'll just be friends, I don't do titles

[Chorus]
Do you want to ride in my convertible?
Vertical
Go forward or reversible
'Cause you're going my way
Do you want to ride in my convertible?
Workable
The back seat is preferable
Bang my bumper today

[Post-Chorus]
Are you gonna go my way?
(Hello, hello)
Are you going downtown?
(Let's go, let's go)
If you're going my way
(Hello, hello)
There's no turning around
(Unless you're turning me around)

[Bridge: M.Y.A.]
Oh my God, Amanda, ha!
Do you see what I see?
To your left, exactly
Ring ring, ching ching (hello, hello)
I wonder how much he costs (let's go, let's gp)
Let's get him!

[Chorus]
Do you want to ride in my convertible?
Vertical
Go forward or reversible
'Cause you're going my way
Do you want to ride in my convertible?
Workable
The back seat is preferable
Bang my bumper today

[Post-Chorus]
Are you gonna go my way?
(Hello, hello)
Are you going downtown?
(Let's go, let's go)
If you're going my way
(Hello, hello)
There's no turning around
(Unless you're turning me around)

Are you gonna go my way?
(Are you gonna go my way?)
Are you going downtown?
(You can paint my town)
If you're going my way
(If you're going my way)
There's no turning around
(Unless you mess up my gown)
