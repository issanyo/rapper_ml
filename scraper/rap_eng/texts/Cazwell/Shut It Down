[Intro: Cazwell & Tatianna]
Yo Tatianna, where you at?
I'm walking out the door right now
Your fan are asking when you hit the stage, they're real impatient
Show starts in fifteen
Fifteen? I'll be there in five

[Verse 1]
How dare you
Come for me looking the way that you do
The most erotic, creature, feature outta of all your crew
Don't even try to argue 'cause you know it's true
(You know it's true)
'Cause I'll be the bitch that keeps it tight
I'll be the bitch that rides all night
I look good even in the light (in the light)
Yeah you know that's right
I don't have a lot of fancy cars
I be rubbing elbows with the stars
I be getting good work with [?]
Out of this world bitch sittin' on Mars
Like damn
I just, shut it down

[Verse 2]
I do me (yup)
Not worried bout what other people think or see
I bring all of this and I know that it came for free
So back up and give me a little room to breathe
All I'm saying please
'Cause I'll be the bitch that keeps it cute
Chilling on deck but ready to shoot
[?] of it tight to keep it mute
It's not how I do
I be the chick to make a scene
Always on point looking so pristine
Upbringing these hoes in a Tati theme
Try and read me, trick, in your dreams
I just, shut it down

[Tatianna]
Cazwell

[Verse 3: Cazwell]
I'm so damn cold
Dripping all rose gold
And I must be [?] that I hit up a man that I [?][?]
And I come for the right price
Just set up a [?] with the right flight
Let me check my itinerary
Do I come [?][?][?] yeah I just might
I don't wanna talk feelings
I wanna stock up all the [?] stacked to the ceiling
I'm on my way up to D.C
My man [?][?][?]
Listen, fuck you and your comments
Stay salty, bowl of ramen
Ask if I'm focused on the kill I say "no doubt"
Me and Tatianna shut it down
Lights out

[Outro: Tatianna]
I just, shut it down
I just, shut it-
