Call

[Hook]
Is it all over my face?
Come heart me love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing
Is it all over my face?
You caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

[Verse 1]
Passed out in a shady hotel room
With a hooker faced down in the restroom
The cockroaches in hypnosis
Sipping what's left of spilled Mimosas
That hotel was so cheap
I should've brought my own sheets
He wanted it and I wanted to
What's left to do, I paid for the room
I'm greasy, grimy, two-timey, butt-sniffing animal
And if I want it I get it, I eat that ass like a cannibal
I don't care If you think I'm dirty, I am dirty, learn me
I masturbated 'til my KY faded...I'm exhausticated

[Chorus]
It's all over your face
Tell me how does it taste?
When the lights go off and your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste
Go to town now
It's all over your face
Tell me baby how does it taste?
When the lights go off and your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Baby, its all over your face
Looks like you've been eating paste
I came too close in your direction
DNA on your complexion
I don't care if you scream
My neighbors are all asleep
My thong on the floor when I close the door
But I left open the screen
Your exact words were rock me
And so I did some bukkake, don't stop me
Lock your legs in that position
Duct tape on your mouth so listen
Ease on out and then I want in
If you didn't why'd you flaunt it
You got me under your skin
On your skin, I could come again

[Chorus]

[Hook w/variations]
Is it all over my face? (it's all over your face)
Come heart me love dancing
Is it all over my face? (tell me how does it taste)
I'm in love dancing
Is it all over my face? (it's all over your face)
You've caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face? (tell me how does it taste)
I'm in love dancing

[Outro]
Call....my face
Why'd you flaunt it
My face, it's all over your face
Call, my face
My face
