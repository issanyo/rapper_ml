Meet me at the ice cream truck
I'll buy you an ice cream
I'll whip out my drumstick
That will make your eyes gleam
Lick it up quick before it melts on the floor
I got it!
Uno-dos-tres-quatro gimme some more OK!
Meet me at the ice cream truck
I'll buy you an ice cream
I can test out my luck
You can play on my team
Let's do the banana split
On the dance floor Got it!
Uno-dos-tres-quatro gimme some more OK!

I met him at the school yard 'round quarter to three
We went out for cheeseburgers with extra cheese
I get my french fries crispy ketchup on the side
And when it comes to dessert this is how i ride I said

Meet me at the ice cream truck

[Verse 2]

You know where to find me from May to July
I'm on the sidewalk chillin lookin' all kinds of fly
Sometimes I get low sometimes I get high
I like rainbow sprinkles on my ice cream pie
