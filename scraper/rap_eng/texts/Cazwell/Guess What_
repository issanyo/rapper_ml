Cazwell:
Stick um up, up, up
More vodka in my cup, cup, cup
Half the internet like whut, whut, whut
In the butt on Craig's list
Stamp on my wrist
69 on my guest list
Guess this
Luciana this chick
Hot like a wick
On the rise like bisquik
Mydick thick
I'm so narcissistic
Brand new trick, hit me up in my district

Cazwell:
Riiiiing
That's me calling
Here's a posish you might find apauling
Won't let lose the juice I'm stalling
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it
Believe me, I'm easy
Just blow me like it's breezy
Don't stop you pop my teepee
On drop I'm pop my seedlings, huh?

Luciana:
You do things to me
(Like what?)
That I cannot pronunce
(Ooh that!)
I'm takin' scores
Kissin' raw
See me rubbin' out
You want it good
Bet you wish you could
I'm buring rubber
With a love boy
And boy he's good

Cazwell:
Drop click and drag me
Want but you can't have me
Take a picture, tag me, tag me, tag me
Drop click and drag me
Want but you can't have me
Take a picture, tag me, tag me, tag me

Cazwell:
Stop!
Drop that roll I'm ready
Hot and sweary
Pop the confetti
Gas like getty
I'm sittin' pretty
Roll about 20 deep with my own committee
Got my name blowin' up all around the city
Sippin' perrier while another major bid me
Right thru security concealing um
And you must feel dirty your feelin' up
Stuck back in the baggy and seelin' um
So high in the sky like helium
The same bank heads that come at me bitter
Are the same snake heads that follow me on twitter
Yeah, I shine so much you think I shit out glitter
Rabies got bit by the babysitter
Still the last of the litter and a mystery
Oops, time for me to clear my history!
