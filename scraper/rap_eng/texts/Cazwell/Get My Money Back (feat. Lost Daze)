(If you came to party, throw your hands up
It's saturday night, time to shake that ass...)

Oh my God!
How do you get this track on your iPod?
How do you get the sweat stain out of my Izod?
Watch it playa'
I'm comin' through you can say a prayer
Hummin' all night and all day'a
With the CD playa's
It's time for the perculator
Don't believe me? Ask the hater
Da maya', whos' headin' down to clubs on the escalator

Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
(Get my money back
Get my money back
Get my money back
Get my money back)

I'm going down, da, da, da down
Below the Canal Street side of town
With the fake old chains, gin in my veins
Got a porno movie settin' on my brain
Wha'
Don't act like you didn't know
Got a hole in my crotch when I start the show
I know the crowd saw me pick my nose
I got a monkey in my pants, watch how it grows

Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
(Get my money back)

I can't be, and I won't be stopped
We pop it off till the big beats drop
And I can't be, and I won't be stopped
Bitch don't try it, try it, try it
Can't be, and I won't be stopped
We pop it off till the big beats drop
And I can't be, and I won't be stopped
You can't buy it, buy it, buy it

Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
(Get my money back)

Ya'll so stupid
All you gotta do is find this beat and loop it
Put it in the backpack of some cute kid
Who gave it to the DJ, to just reboot it
Made a gun, two fingers and a thumb
To get my money back, get my money back
Took a bite, from a cool Big Mac
Don't try me jack
Give you and your crew an anxiety attack

Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
Get my money back, get my money back
(Get my money back
Get my money back
Get my money back
Get my money back)

I wanna know can get my money back
