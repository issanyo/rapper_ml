Kickin' in yo' door, you would think I was a punter

Oh man god damn
Dexter
Ha, ha, ooh
Wait, what

[Chorus]
Diamonds hot like the summer, huh
Kickin' in yo' door, you would think I was a punter
Cuffin' on that bitch, boy I know you was a sucka
Yeah, fuck that bitch the other day, I pass her to my brother
Ooh, yeah, huh (I did what)
I'm a lucky motherfucker, huh
AP on my wrist, I'm a lucky motherfucker
Ooh, diamonds on my neck, I'm a lucky motherfucker
Smokin' cookie out the oven, yeah, you'd think it was disgusting
Ooh, ha, what (Dexter, yeah, what)

[Verse 1]
Smokin' cookie out the oven, I'm a lucky motherfucker
And your boyfriend is a sucker, huh (he lame)
Run up on his ass, you would think I was a trucker
And I'm gettin' money, what, yeah, motherfucker
Ooh, huh, yeah, coolin' with Justin, that's my brother
Ooh, coolin' with Andy, yeah, that's my other brother
I can't trust these hoes, yeah, they so undercover
Motherfucker, undercover, uh, fuck on top of covers, ooh
Yeah, drawin' on my pants 'cause I can, ooh
And I love Vans and bands in my pants, huh
Fuck her friend, she jealous, then I fuck her other friend
Then I pass her to my homie, I don't care about that bitch, ooh
Yeah, huh

[Chorus]
Diamonds hot like the summer, huh
Kickin' in yo' door, you would think I was a punter
Cuffin' on that bitch, boy I know you was a sucka
Yeah, fuck that bitch the other day, I pass her to my brother
Ooh, yeah, huh (yeah, Dexter)
I'm a lucky motherfucker, huh
AP on my wrist, I'm a lucky motherfucker
Ooh, diamonds on my neck, I'm a lucky motherfucker
Smokin' cookie out the oven, yeah, you'd think it was disgusting
Ooh, huh

[Verse 2]
Smokin' cookie out the oven, you would think it was disgusting
But I got it from the bae, yeah, I got it from my plugger
Saw a nasty lil bitch, she a sexy motherfucker
And she talmbout havin' baby, but I had a rubber, ooh, huh
I ain't on that shit, ooh, I can't want that bitch, huh
I can't wife that bitch, uh, I get money quick, ooh
You a stupid bitch, what (ha, what)
I just wanna get all my bands up, yeah, huh (yeah, Dexter)

[Chorus]
Diamonds hot like the summer, huh
Kickin' in yo' door, you would think I was a punter
Cuffin' on that bitch, boy I know you was a sucka
Yeah, fuck that bitch the other day, I pass her to my brother
Ooh, yeah, huh (yeah, a what, Dexter)
I'm a lucky motherfucker, huh
AP on my wrist, I'm a lucky motherfucker
Ooh, diamonds on my neck, I'm a lucky motherfucker
Smokin' cookie out the oven, yeah, you'd think it was disgusting

[Outro]
Ooh, what, yuh
Diamonds on my wrist, you'd think it was a puddle, what
Drippin', puddle, puddle, puddle
Had to leave a puddle
I'm a crazy motherfucker, Dexter
Know what I'm sayin'
Smokin' cookie out the oven, you would think it was disgusting
But I got from the bae, yeah, I got it from my plugger
Fuck your bitch, she dead, yeah, she stupid, motherfucker
Yeah, Dexter
Huh
