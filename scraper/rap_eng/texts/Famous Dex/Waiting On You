Told me that you wanted to get cuffed
I'll send down your ear then switch it out
Laughing nigga doing backflips in a row
Breakin' things, I thought you were my momma
Now you callin' me sayin' nigga you're all the time drunk
Open your ears, my baby, hear me out
Cause I've still been waiting on you in an Orwo truck
I really wanna love you, baby
But can I really trust you, baby
If I wouldn't have the cash
Would you be still here with me
