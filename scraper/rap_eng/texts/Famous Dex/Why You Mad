[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Why you so mad, why you just hatin
I get that money, I'm straight
Go right to the cake, just bought me a wraith
Why you so mad, why you so mad
Why you so mad, fuck on your bitch, I just bought her a bag

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Why you so mad, fuck your lil bitch, just bought her a bag
I ain't even gotta brag, you can just tell from my bands
30 on me and it's rair, run up on me, and you end up in a bag
I ain't even mad, just go right to the cash
Bad bitches hit me right when the jet land
I'm feelin good, like Batman
And you know I got my gang, man
Run up on me, and you a dead man
Why you so mad, why you hate
I got that money, I'm straight
Fuck your lil bitch in her face, I bust on her face

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Why you so mad, why you just hatin
I get that money, I'm straight
Go right to the cake, just bought me a wraith
Why you so mad, why you so mad
Why you so mad, fuck on your bitch, I just bought her a bag

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
I know they mad, they mad they ain't havin no cash
I'm in a new papertag, and you know it's back in black
I know they mad cause I fuckin they hoe
I know they mad cause they broke, and they have to get drove
Smokin on cookie, and smokin on dro
If your bitch ain't bad, then she gotta go
Fly nigga, yeah, they askin where my wings at
2 bitches askin where the strings at
Rich round 2, that's where the bling at
I been havin pain, I ain't askin where the Lean at
Niggas mad, but I ain't really give a fuck
Cause I'm out here runnin up, and these hoes wanna fuck

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Why you so mad, why you just hatin
I get that money, I'm straight
Go right to the cake, just bought me a wraith
Why you so mad, why you so mad
Why you so mad, fuck on your bitch, I just bought her a bag
