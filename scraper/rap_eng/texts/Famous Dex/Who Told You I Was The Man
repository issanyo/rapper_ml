[Verse]
Who told you I was the man?
Who told you I was the man?
You fuckin' that bitch for a hand
I'm fuckin' that bitch for some bands
You fuckin' that bitch for some Xans
I'm fuckin' that bitch in my van
They say, "What you do for the money?"
I say, "What you do for the 'Gram?"
Them hollows they comin' your way
You try me, boy, you gon' get sprayed
I'm feelin' so fresh today, I'm golfing like I'm Jason Day
So please don't play with my cake!
Them young boys'll come to your place
They put the K to your face, they tell your ass: "Open the safe!"
"Lil baby, where is your man?"
Matter fact, stick to the plan!
I swear, I'm gone off them Xans
I ain't trippin' 'cause I got them bands
Your girl on my dick she a fan, she knowin' that I am the man
Who told you I was the man?
Who told you I was the man?

[Chorus]
Who told you I was the man? (Woo)
Who told you I was the man, who told you I was the man?
(Woo-hoo)
Who told you I was the man? (Woo)
Who told you I was the man, who told you I was the man?
(Woo-hoo)
Who told you I was the man? (Woo)
Who told you I was the man, who told you I was the man?
(Woo-hoo)
Who told you I was the man? (Woo)
Who told you I was the man, who told you I was the man?
(Woo-hoo)
