Bitches like tooth fairy
You a rat like Tom & Jerry

Sippin' that Wock, goin' straight to the top
Don't want your lil' bitch, she a thot
Bust on that bitch, you think I'm a Glock

Ride with me, know I ain't havin' it
Thirty on me got the beam

Might run to the money, I'm married, yeah
Run to the money, I'm married
Run to the money, I'm married, yeah
