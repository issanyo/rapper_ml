(Zaytoven)

[Hook: Diego Money]
Pull up in drop top, so Imma speed
Down in L.A wit' my niggas smokin' trees
One phone call nigga tell me what you need
No I'm not a rat but I run straight to the cheese
What you got inside your pocket, a couple G's
Bad bitches with me, and they all got triple D's
Run me up a check, did that shit wit' no degree
Pull up in a Vet, everybody knows me

[Bridge: Famous Dex]
Know what I'm saying, Dexter
Ooh, what, know what I'm saying, ya know what I'm sayin'
Money, ya dig
AP wrist on froze, know what I'm sayin'
Duke, Dexter, Diego
Diego, Duke, and Dexter
Ha, Ion give a fuck what ya say
Woah, yeah!

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Ooh, ooh, I just came up on a pint
Say you get money, you ain't
Diamonds shinin' like a light
Ooh, what, .30 on me I don't fight
Kill a lil' boy up on sight
Bad bitch, pussy pink
Wait, riding 'round it's just me and Duke
Smokin' on the ooh countin' up my blues
You know Diego wit' me too
Wave brothers bitch yeah we the crew

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
I'm tryna' stay in the mix
Young nigga stay with the shit
Put a little dope on my wrist
Get you a 50 gon' cost you a brick
I used to trap in the spot wit' the stick
And I be wit' Dexter just like I'm Rich
I keep a bad bitch, she sucking my dick
I'm in the Lambo, I speedracin'
We drankin' straight we don't need chasers
These niggas broke, and they need paper
We wit the shit, we the creators
Typical bih' ain't got lot of flavor
They know that I shine, got a lot of haters
Just took a private jet outta Vegas
I'ma get money, my obligation
Pull up with the top down, got all these bitches watchin'
Watch these fake ass hoes, all these bitches wishing-washing
I'm just cruising in my own lane, bitch I'm steady bossin'
And they know me like a Celtic I got shooters out in Boston
Bitch I used to be broke, ain't no nigga try to cross me
Then I ran down on they ass, and I hit 'em with them choppers
Will somebody call the ambulance them boys gon' need a doctor
We finna' get them, but they know we proper
Don't answer questions, we answerin' problems
