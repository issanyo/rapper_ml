I made that bands lil bitch
I do my dance lil bitch
I am the man lil bitch
I don't do Xans lil bitch (lil bitch)
I'm the man lil bitch
I got them bands lil bitch
I ain't even mad lil bitch
Run up on me [?] lil bitch

[Verse]:
Fuck your lil bitch for some bands, lil bitch
I didn't even trust the bitch
But I gave her the dick
[?] is the shit
Ballin so hard like I play for the Cavs
I fuck his bitch, now he mad
I gave 100 now she grab
Then she got me on on the gram
I could block a bitch spam
I don't even do the gram
A .30 on me now play up
I had to get up off the jam
