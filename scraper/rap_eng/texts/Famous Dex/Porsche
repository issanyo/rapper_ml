Two bitches, they fuck me, that's double dutch
Had to pour me up a double cup
My money long like a horse
I just pulled up in a Porsche
All these bitches tryna lamp
They tryna put me on the Gram
Uh, baby girl, where your man?

Two bitches, they fuck me, that's double dutch
Had to pour me up a double cup
My money long like a horse
I just pulled up in a Porsche
All these bitches tryna lamp
They tryna put me on the Gram
Uh, baby girl, where your man?
I get head then I scram

Yeah, I get it then beat like a criminal
All this Bape like an animal
