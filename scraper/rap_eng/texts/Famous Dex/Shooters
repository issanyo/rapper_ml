[Hook]
Yo say your a shooter, boy I got them shooters
We run in yo store, call us the removers
And all of us strapped, them Glocks and rugers
You say you a shooter, boy I got them shooters
Yea I got them shooters, I got them shooters
Boy I got them shooters, I got them shooters
We kick in yo door, call us the removers
Boy I got them shooters, Yeah I got them shooters

[Verse]
Boy I got them shooters, Yea I got them shooters
You better be cool or that 30 will do you
My niggas off pills, I swear they will screw you
If you smoking that hookah, you get put in the sewer
But I really don't give a fuck, we shoot like the bulls
And Martin so crazy he kickin in stools
So you better be cool, you win or you lose
My youngins they shoot, don't get put on the news
No I am no Ali, I float like a butterfly stuck like a bumble bee
I just brought this 30, shooting like curry
You know that bitch MVP
How you going to injure me, boy I got them shooters
We run in yo store call us the removers

[Hook]
Yo say your a shooter, boy I got them shooters
We run in yo store, call us the removers
And all of us strapped, them Glocks and rugers
You say you a shooter, boy I got them shooters
Yea I got them shooters, I got them shooters
Boy I got them shooters, I got them shooters
We kick in yo door, call us the removers
Boy I got them shooters, Yeah I got them shooters
