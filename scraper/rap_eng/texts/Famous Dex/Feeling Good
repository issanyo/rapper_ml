[Hook]
What? I'm feeling good, woah, I'm feeling good
Yeah, I'm feeling good, woah, I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm smoking all these fuckin' woods
I'm gettin' money, wish you could
What? I'm feeling good, woah, I'm feeling good
Yeah, I'm feeling good, woah, I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm smoking all these fuckin' woods

[Verse]
I'm feelin' good
I got Maaly Raw on the beat
Yeezys on my feet
I'm fuckin' bitches every week
The diamonds on me luxury
Feelin' good, smellin' good
I'm from the hood, woah
I swear to God white bitches go
They sniffin' shit up in they nose
Back in the days I ain't have a lot
But now I got diamonds in my Apple Watch
I'm all these bitches wanna stalk
I'm ballin' hard, Tony Hawk
And everybody lookin' screamin' "oh shit Dex linked with Maaly Raw"
We do some shit you never saw
I just pulled off in the Ghost
Oh woah, a Dexter, I'm feelin' good

[Hook]
What? I'm feeling good, woah, I'm feeling good
Yeah, I'm feeling good, woah, I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm smoking all these fuckin' woods
I'm gettin' money, wish you could
What? I'm feeling good, woah, I'm feeling good
Yeah, I'm feeling good, woah, I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
I'm smoking all these fuckin' woods
I'm gettin' money, wish you could
