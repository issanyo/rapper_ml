[Hook]
I'm energy'd up like a battery
I fuck your bitch on my balcony
I'm sipping lean, it's emergency
My diamonds on me I need surgery
I can't never trust the hoes
I be cooling with the bros
My 30 on me, I can't go
You run up on me, get exposed
I'm energy'd up like a battery
I fuck your bitch on my balcony
I'm sipping lean, it's emergency
My diamonds on me I need surgery
I can't never trust the hoes
I be cooling with the bros
My 30 on me, I can't go
You run up on me, get exposed

[Verse]
Yeah, energy up like a battery
I fuck your bitch on my balcony
I'm sipping lean, I can't think
All these bitches wearing pink
I'm geeking right at my shows
I be talking pills, voice inside of me
My 30 right on me
You run up on me, surgery
Yeah, what?
I went from broke to riches
Yeah, what?
I got your bitch up in my kitchen
Yeah, what?
I swear that bitch is washing dishes
Yeah, what?
She sucking dick without kissing

[Hook]
I'm energy'd up like a battery
I fuck your bitch on my balcony
I'm sipping lean, it's emergency
My diamonds on me I need surgery
I can't never trust the hoes
I be cooling with the bros
My 30 on me, I can't go
You run up on me, get exposed
I'm energy'd up like a battery
I fuck your bitch on my balcony
I'm sipping lean, it's emergency
My diamonds on me I need surgery
I can't never trust the hoes
I be cooling with the bros
My 30 on me, I can't go
You run up on me, get exposed
