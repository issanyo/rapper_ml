Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Famous Dex]
Ha
You know what I'm sayin'?
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Wassup, Critch? (Yuh, ha, what, yah, hah)
How we doin'? (Yuh)
Ohh man god damn, what?

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Bad bitch, suck on my dick, huh
I just pulled wit' a stick, huh
Yeah, I'm sippin' on lean
I'm drinkin' that [?], I'm feelin' like Critch
Hey, fuck yo' lil' bitch everyday
She [?] give me that face
Baby [?], just give me brain, [?]
I be doing money, you a dummy
Swear to god, I put dick right in her tummy
You niggas so bummy
I can't talk 'cause you a dummy
Fiend, sippin' on all this lean
Too much money on me
[?] machines, ha

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Yeah, I got it
Run up on me with a rocket, swear he ain't got shit, huh
Yeah, I pop [?]
Got a big lil' bitch, swear to god she will suck dick, huh
Ooh, yuh, baby girl, suck on that dick though
And I get mad, and I get mad
Gettin' money, gettin' money, yeah, big doors, bitch

[Verse: Jay Critch]
I walked in with a bad bitch, they don't want static
I made Givenchy, my fabric
My diamonds flashin', givin' 'em static
You still have bands in the mattress
Look at the bag, how it's [?]
Look at my 30s pull up like "What happened?"
Slime scorin', he plays for the Magic
In the foreign, she said she needs chapstick
Boy, you ain't got money, it's tragic
Put the dick in her mouth, now she gaggin'
I woke up to some money, fantastic
Niggas just like Fantastic 4
Pussy, what you rappin' for?
[?] but I have to score
I'm too high, I almost crashed the Porsche
Butterfly, had to catch the doors
That prolly went over your head
Shorty [?] it up for the head
I be runnin' up four pints for the med
She goin', she tried to stay in my bed
But I'm kickin' her out, yeah, pronto
I'm ballin' like Harden, you ballin' like Lonzo
Smokin' that cookie and paper and Fronto
Nine to your back like a nigga named Bronco
'Cause I'm getting this green like its Boston, flossin'
If he get synced up, its gon' cost him
I get my white girl to [?], she say "Awesome"
If you ain't talkin' no money, you lost 'em
Hood fame, bitch, I'm all about dividends
That money comin' around like a ceiling fan
Someone need a boss and these niggas the miniman
[?] talkin' the money, lets get it then

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Run up on me with a rocket, swear he ain't got shit, huh
Yeah, I pop [?]
Got a big lil' bitch, swear to god she will suck dick, huh
Ooh, yuh, baby girl, suck on that dick though
And I get mad, and I get mad
Gettin' money, gettin' money, yeah, big doors, bitch, huh
