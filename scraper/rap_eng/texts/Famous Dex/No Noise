[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
You niggas not makin' no noise
I wanted the Rari, no Porsche
Jumped right off the porch
I was trappin', had to make it a sport
I'm back on the court
Dexter rich forever, pass him the torch
Takin' that bitch if she yours
You niggas ain't makin' no noise
You niggas not makin' no noise
I wanted the Rari, no Porsche
Jumped right off the porch
I was trappin', had to make it a sport
I'm back on the court
Dexter rich forever, pass him the torch
Takin' that bitch if she yours
You niggas ain't makin' no noise

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
You niggas ain't making no noise
Hop in the Maybach, ain't talkin' no Porsche
I ain't goin' back and forth
Taking your bitch, yeah she used to be yours
Whip up the bowl, that's another wrist
Run up on me, got my stick
Broke as hell, now I'm rich
All these bitches on my dick
Wait, hop in the Lam, I'm straight
I'm going real fast, I don't know why
I got two bitches, they bi
Run up on me, lose your life
Lil bro in the cut with the thirty
You lookin' so nervous, you chap me like fries
Off the percs, I'm hella high
My diamonds they shopping, no lie
You niggas ain't making no noise
Riding a rental, we know it ain't yours
Look at your grill, all foil
Red bottom my bitch, she spoiled
Rich Forever, we together
Two little bitches, they licking each other
I get the money whatever
Drink out the pint, it make me feel better

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
You niggas not makin' no noise
I wanted the Rari, no Porsche
Jumped right off the porch
I was trappin', had to make it a sport
I'm back on the court
Dexter rich forever, pass him the torch
Takin' that bitch if she yours
You niggas ain't makin' no noise
You niggas not makin' no noise
I wanted the Rari, no Porsche
Jumped right off the porch
I was trappin', had to make it a sport
I'm back on the court
Dexter rich forever, pass him the torch
Takin' that bitch if she yours
You niggas ain't makin' no noise

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Trappin' mama, I just wanted some Forces
Put some red bottoms on her, she gorgeous
Fuck her one time and ignore her
You niggas ain't making no noise
Don't pass me that cup, it ain't lean in it
Hop in the coupe with like three bitches
Me and young Dexter from rags to riches
Straight off the porch had to get a Bentley
Gotta thank God for my blessings
Your diamonds ain't real you flexing
Kick her out in the morning
Smoking cookies while I'm pouring
The plug don't talk on the phone
I had to Gucci the coat
I wanna fuck on her throat
Lil bitch don't love me no more
Broke nigga shut up
They was hating on the come up
Need some more soda
I put your bitch on a poster
You can keep her, she a eater, I don't need her
Oh she boring, my bitch foreign, need a visa

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
You niggas not makin' no noise
I wanted the Rari, no Porsche
Jumped right off the porch
I was trappin', had to make it a sport
I'm back on the court
Dexter rich forever, pass him the torch
Takin' that bitch if she yours
You niggas ain't makin' no noise
You niggas not makin' no noise
I wanted the Rari, no Porsche
Jumped right off the porch
I was trappin', had to make it a sport
I'm back on the court
Dexter rich forever, pass him the torch
Takin' that bitch if she yours
You niggas ain't makin' no noise
