[Intro]
This for you Mom

[Verse]
When I ain't had shit, I was out here tryna take it
But I'ma make it to the top, I swear to God Mom I'ma make it
Yea, I'ma make it
When I ain't had shit, I was out here tryna take it
But I'ma make it to the top, I swear to God Mom I'ma make it
Yea, I'm gone make it
My family, we gone be good
I'm tryna get us out the hood
My family, we gone be good
I'm tryna get us out the hood
When I was on the corner, I was out here tryna get it
2 for 5, 3 for 10, hell yea you know I'm winning
All the bitches on my dick, I swear to God I'll get up in it
I know you want my money, baby girl I'm not silly
No I'm not silly
My mama said "Son you the greatest"
And just stay away from any haters
They say they your friends but they fakers
And you can't [?] on the neighbors
