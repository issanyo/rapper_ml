[Verse 1: Diego Money]
We don't need no body this the wave brothers shit
Bitches on my dick yeah, you better know this shit
Ice around my neck, I'ma make you notice me
Young Diego Money ain't no body cold as him
I just might Jump in the Mazzi
Chain on my neck, diamonds kick like karate
Smoking on kush and it come from the island
Looking for treasure, {the girl} like a pirate
Smoking gas got me high out of sight
Fuck with us and get hit with the pipe
Young nigga ball like mike
Your bitch she riding me just like a bike
