[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Jay Critch]
Bitch I be ballin' like KD
I fuck a bitch and her friends
I think we did it again
I been walkin' with them bands
Hey, moon walkin' off a xan
Ayy, fucked a girl, she a fan
She let me hit it on video
My circle small like a cheerio
Bitch I be ballin' like KD
I fuck your bitch off the gram
Pull up in a Rari like damn
Foreign ho from Japan
Ayy, bitch I stick to the plan
Remember I was juggin' for the grams
Ayy, then we ran off with your pack
Young nigga ran up a sack

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid & Jay Critch]
Run it up, run it up
Nasty bitch, fuck her right on the furniture
Paris ride in a Rari, foreigner
Fuck a model bitch and I'm recording her
She wanna fuck 'cause I'm comin up
Pull up in Rari's, no Hummer truck
Ayy, bitch I be ballin' like Mike and 'em
I got the bands, now she likin' him
Yeah, took your bitch no pardon me, sorry
Skateboard bitches callin' me gnarly
Diamonds flash like the paparazzi, yeah
Big thirty, now them boys don't want problems
Stepback, now that boy look like Harden
Rich Forever, now my chain look like water, yeah

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Jay Critch]
Bitch I be ballin' like KD
I fuck a bitch and her friends

Young nigga ran up a sack

[Verse 2: Famous Dex, Jay Critch, & Rich The Kid]
Ah-Dexter, look
Bitch I be ballin' like KD
Blockin' bitches off the gram
Naw I do not do no xans
I like to draw on my pants
Ice on my neck, colosseum
Come get your girl, she be all in my DMs
Sixteen, I was whippin' that BM
She fuckin' on me 'cause her man wanna be him
I just might make her my BM
Foreign bitch, she Korean
I let her stay for the weekend
Fifty K on a backend
I get the money, them M&Ms
I fuck your bitch, she ain't in to him
I'm ballin' hard above the rim
Run up on me, put the blood on your Timbs
Donâ€™t run up on me, got the gun on my hip
She suckin' me up, I'm gon' cum on her lips
Big choppers, I got guns like I'm Tip
Ran off with that pack, hit the block, make it flip
Big choppers like I'm Tip
I might just nut on her lips
Oh shit, she got milk
My homies be blood, and some of 'em crip

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Jay Critch]
Bitch I be ballin' like KD

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid & Jay Critch]
Yeah, diamonds on me and they wet, splash
Trap nigga, birds takin' a bath
Whip a brick then I'm buying a Jag
Hey, zip 'em up like Bathin' Ape
Whip it up like we bakin' cakes
Chop-chop it up, yeah shavin' weight
We was broke, now we rich forever
Too many diamonds, might break the bezel
We got the money, might flex together
She suck my dick on the dresser
She give me brain like professors
I'm a professional flexer
And I ball, Michael Vick
We was broke, now we rich
Trap phone, hangin' up on the plug
Rich nigga with a cup full of mud
Xans on me, I been takin' the drugs
Bad bitch wanna fuck with a thug
Come too close, catch a couple of slugs
Chain shining on me, now she fallin' in love
You ain't grinding homie, you ain't gettin' no bucks
Maserati, used to ride on the bus

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Jay Critch]
Bitch I be ballin' like KD
I fuck a bitch and her friends
I think we did it again
