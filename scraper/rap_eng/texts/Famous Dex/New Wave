[Intro]
Yuh! Trap!

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
They tryna copy the wave
Too many chains like a slave
Rich Forever getting paid
Money machine might break
Whoa wait, they tryna copy the style
Watch how I jump in the crowd
Reach for my chain, boy how
30 on me, swear to God, I'll burn you down (Hold up, hold up)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
They tryna copy the wave
Rich Forever getting paid
Broke rappers in here, feeling the hate (wait)
Real diamonds on me, buying them straight (look)
All these rappers turning fu
They just wanna learn the moves
I got them hunnids they blue
I spent a grip on my shoes
He got signed, but that nigga got dropped
Audemar, that's a house on my watch
Came from nothing, now they want me to stop
Rings on me, I had holes in my socks
Wait, I remember in them days
Young used to have them braids
Swear to god I jump a gate
30 yea, right down my waste, might just catch a case

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
They tryna copy the wave
Too many chains like a slave
Rich Forever getting paid
Money machine might break
Whoa wait, they tryna copy the style
Watch how I jump in the crowd
Reach for my chain, boy how
30 on my me, swear to God, I'll bring him down

[Verse 2: Famous Dex & Rich The Kid]
I walk right in the party
Red bottoms on, how you do that? Wait
Lemme call up Rozay
Huh, yea, "Bro where Rich at?"
Haha, these broke niggas keep talking
Yo bitch keep on stalking
Diamonds on me, put 'em in a coffin' (hold on)
Green money like Boston (wait)
I know you wanna join the wave
Wait, cool off, hey
Fuckin' yo bitch, pull her braids
Can't fuck with them man they talk to the jakes (Oh man god Damn)
Blue money like the wave
Goyard on me, I'm paid
I leave a mess on her face
New foreign on the escalade
I'ma just fuck on her friend
Young nigga, we setting trends
Rich forever, yea we win
Pull up in the Mas', nigga fuck a Benz
She want a bag, I can buy that
Break her off like a Kit-Kat
Got a lay her down, Maserati was black
Try to ride the wave, get hit with a mac

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
They tryna copy the wave
Too many chains like a slave
Rich Forever getting paid
Money machine might break
Whoa wait, they tryna copy the style
Watch how I jump in the crowd
Reach for my chain, boy how
30 on my me, swear to God, I'll bring him down
