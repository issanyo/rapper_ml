(Hook)(X2)
I'm busting so hard, i'm the man
No i ain't talking them xans
Your bitch on my dick with no hands
She follow me on the Gram
She like the way that i dance
They like the way that i dance
She like the way that i dance
They like the way that i dance

(Verse)
Your bitch on my dick with no hands
She like the way that i dance
She follow me right on the gram
Lil baby where is you mans
I only get head then i scram
Then i go right to them bands
Then [X] pull off in a foreign
Then we get high and we land
Finessing the plug for a week
Then i turn up on the beat
Margiela's they right on my feet
I pay 600 a piece
These bitches they all up on me
My bankrolls i keep em on me
So please don't run up on me
Cause flash is shooting for me
He shooting for free
I'm busting so hard, i'm the man
No i ain't talking them xans
Your bitch on my dick wanna dance
Who told you i was the man?
I know lil baby a fan
So i sit back and sip 2 times
Who told you i was the man?
Who told you i was the man?

I'm busting so hard, i'm the man

Your bitch on my dick with no hands
She follow me on the Gram
She like the way that i dance
They like the way that i dance
She like the way that i dance
They like the way that i dance
