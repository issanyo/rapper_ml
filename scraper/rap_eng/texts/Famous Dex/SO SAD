[Hook: Warhol]
I can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch, I can't go out sad
They gon' throw a fit, 'bout that bitch, he forever mad
Fifteen on my wrist, wit' the Bent, boy gon' double dash
YSL my fit, Nike kicks, I count double cash
I can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch, I can't go out sad
They gon' throw a fit, 'bout that bitch, he forever mad
Fifteen on my wrist, wit' the Bent, boy gon' double dash
YSL my fit, Nike kicks, I count double cash

[Verse: Dex & Warhol]
I don't give no fucks 'bout yo bitch, he gon' bawl and cry
.40 wit' the drum, extra stick, he can't go outside
Eighty on my wrist, sippin' lean, shit I'm extra tired
Ha, that's your bitch she bi, ha off them pills I'm high
And I don't know why, niggas be hatin' they bitchin'
Pullin' out all of yo extensions, hit from the back and she flinchin'
Warhol love the cake, I just might dirty the kitchen
See that little nigga be sayin' it, Warhol be stuntin' this way
Send in my shooters he missin', five bitches yeah I'm poppin'
Don't gotta talk just listen, I used to whip in the kitchen
Got Givenchy all up on my tag, ha
Call up Warhol fuck your sister got these niggas mad
All this shit so simple, pop a nigga like a pimple
Bad hoe wit' the dimples, fuck that hoe til' she crippled
Walked in wit' the gang wit' me and we all strapped wit' the missiles
Two Tec's I got bad rep better not test so we eager
Five hoes doin' coke whole time these bitches really simple
She wanna suck on my missiles, now I have to ride for my woe
Nah nigga you can't hang wit' me, smokin' the Woods no pencil
Hop in the foreign, no rental, coppin' the wave I knew you were mental
Bag it, bag it up, I get that money and add it up
Camel toe, she ain't bad enough, we can not diss her wit' it no taxin' us
Aye, pull up and pass, eatin' that chicken Gladys
Aye, headed to Roscoe's, suckin' yo bitch she the badest
Ooh, I don't want your bitch, she so slick, she gon' go inside
Run into a bag, you so mad, you so extra mad
Pop up and I'm glad, hunnid' thousand right up on my tag
Ha, Goyard on my bag, got these boys so extra mad

[Hook: Warhol]
I can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch, I can't go out sad
They gon' throw a fit, 'bout that bitch, he forever mad
Fifteen on my wrist, wit' the Bent, boy gon' double dash
YSL my fit, Nike kicks, I count double cash
I can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch, I can't go out sad
They gon' throw a fit, 'bout that bitch, he forever mad
Fifteen on my wrist, wit' the Bent, boy gon' double dash
YSL my fit, Nike kicks, I count double cash

[Outro: Warhol]
Yeah ooh, aye whoa

Speed up we don't crash, aye whoa
