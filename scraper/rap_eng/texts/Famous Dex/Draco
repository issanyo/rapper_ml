[Verse 1 : Soulja Boy]
Me and Dex, fucking up a check
God damn all these broke ass niggas starin' at a nigga neck
Fuck on your bitch, she givin' me neck
I'm grippin' the Draco
I'm grippin' the TEC
Shoot a pussy nigga all in his neck
Nigga I'm making it rain, you know that she wet
Smokin' Gelato,  I'm high in the space
Call up my lawyer he beat me the case
150 bricks in the Goyard
Hop in the whip with Givenchy sittin' on my shoe lace
Smokin' on dope and I'm takin' your bitch out the denim
Hit the private jet, me and Kylie Jenner
Draco extended clip and they sprintin'
75 000 diamonds they winter

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Draco, Draco
Don't make me spray with the Draco
Shooters they pull up, you shoot when I say so
Call up lil' Soulja, I ball like Diego
Draco (x23)

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I never leave with no Draco
My shooters do what I say so
I hit a stain when I lay low
Can't fuck that bitch, swear on God she a fake hoe
(Draco, Draco, yeah, I move with the Draco)
Swear to God boom with that Draco
You run up on me swear to God got my drank on
Ballin' run right to the pesos
Yeah I'm so clean, yeah
Can't fuck these bitches, just scream
Ballin' so hard with no ring, just look at my rings
Look at the diamonds, yeah, all of them shining
Diamonds they dance in the dark
Used to serve right at the park, I trap at the park
A young nigga starved, used to have food but I starved
Bend down that old then I lurk in the dark
Move like I catch you then young nigga bark
(Wait)
Draco, Draco
Boy don't let me call Uno
You know, you know
He'll shoot your ass down with the Draco, yeah!

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Draco, Draco
Don't make me spray with the Draco
Shooters they pull up, you shoot when I say so
Call up lil' Soulja, I ball like Diego
Draco (x23)
