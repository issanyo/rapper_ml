(Intro: Famous Dex)
Bring it back, bring it back
Ha, you dig?
Nato you on live?
Who wrote this?
Man max
Pour me up 2 a rocket
I'm in LA smoking cookie, ha
I'm in La smoking cookie
Look at your boyfriend we know he a rookie
Ha, Dexter

(Chorus x2: Famous Dex)
Yea, what?
These Niggas some rookies
They talking about copying the wave, well nigga I took it
I'm in LA smoking cookie
I got these bitches they looking
These niggas they active
Stack up the money, don't matter
Hate on me after
30 coming to your bladder
Money coming, count it faster

(Verse 1: Lite Fortunato)
They wanna be on the wave
They wanna be on the wave
Oh, they all want the wave
Oh, they all want the wave
They might drown in the wave
They might survive in the wave
They wanna be on the wave
Uh
Shit, they wanna copy the wave
They wanna be in the wave, but it's okay
Fuck on that bitch she get slayed
Fuck on that bitch I tell her she got to go and get big
Shit
I be with Dex, we pouring lean in a 8
Uh

They looking so pretty no makeup

(Bridge: Lite Fortunato)
They wanna copy the wave
Oh, They wanna copy the wave
Oh, They wanna copy the wave
Oh, They wanna copy the wave
(yuh, yuh!)

(Chorus x2: Famous Dex)
Yea, what?
These Niggas some rookies
They talking about copying the wave, well nigga I took it
I'm in LA smoking cookie
I got these bitches they looking
These niggas they active
Stack up the money, don't matter
Hate on me after
30 coming to your bladder
Money coming, count it faster

[Pause]

(Chorus x2: Famous Dex)
Yea, what?
These Niggas some rookies
They talking about copying the wave, well nigga I took it
I'm in LA smoking cookie
I got these bitches they looking
These niggas they active
Stack up the money, don't matter
Hate on me after
30 coming to your bladder
Money coming, count it faster
