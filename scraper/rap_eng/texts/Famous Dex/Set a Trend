[Hook: Famous Dex]
I had to roll them bands
I got the holes in my pants
I do not told the friends
A young nigga set a trend
I had to roll them bands
I got the holes in my pants
A young nigga rocking vans
I just set me up a trend
A trend, a trend
A young nigga set a trend
I just run me up them bands
A young nigga rocking vans
A trend, a trend
I had to run me up them bands
I got the holes in my pants
A young nigga rocking vans

[Part 1: Famous Dex]
I just set me trend
I got the holes in my pants
A young nigga rocking vans
I block that bitch off the gramm
I just pull up in a masi
I got that lil bitch, she's a hottie
I know that bitch want some money
I'm looking at her like she's sorry
I been start gigging a party
I'm sippin' lean or bacardi
I got hundred bands on me
These bitches try to dance on me
I make her look like a doctor
I said to the boy: "Where's your father"
I put the pills upon his father
I swear to god it's getting hotter
I look at my niggas, so froze
I look at my wrist, it's so froze
I fuck your lil bitch and you know
She pullin' shit up on her own
A young nigga rocking vans
I got the holes in my pants
Oh shit i'm settin' trends
Dex back at it again

Von den Hits hab' ich ein'n Kater dog

In meinem Umfeld, Mind ist solar
Wir sind oben, Sterne funkeln unterm Sofa
Echigoya und Go-Karts
Kidd kifft sich ins Koma, oh Mann
Ich geb' den Ton an
Porsche, ich fahr' bald Donuts
