[Intro]
Dexter
This my year right here, know what I'm sayin'?
Shon what's up bro?

[Chorus]
What, ooh, told 'em sit back it's my year
Fucked the lil bitch, I don't care
Celine all on the gear
Ooh, wait, pop a lil perc from the hulk
Money comin' out the vault
Your boyfriend ain't got it, we know that's a loss
What, ooh, told 'em sit back it's my year
Fucked the lil bitch, I don't care
Celine all on the gear
Ooh, wait, pop a lil perc from the hulk
Money comin' out the vault
Your boyfriend ain't got it, we know that's a loss

[Verse]
Celine all on the gear
My 30 on me, you know I don't care
I should be running for mayor
Diamonds cold, polar bear
I had to run up a check
Don't want that bitch, she's depressed
Diego with me so we flex
She fuckin' for fame, I just want the sex
Baby girl give me the neck
Max come in at your neck
Smokin' dope, never stress
Pullin' up mob in a jet
Look at my body, Celine
I was broke, I had a dream
Now I'm having everything
Hop in the Masi, you know it's so clean

[Chorus]
What, ooh, told 'em sit back it's my year
Fucked the lil bitch, I don't care
Celine all on the gear
Ooh, wait, pop a lil perc from the hulk
Money comin' out the vault
Your boyfriend ain't got it, we know that's a loss
What, ooh, told 'em sit back it's my year
Fucked the lil bitch, I don't care
Celine all on the gear
Ooh, wait, pop a lil perc from the hulk
Money comin' out the vault
Your boyfriend ain't got it, we know that's a loss
