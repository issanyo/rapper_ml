[Intro]
OhmanGodDamn
DJ Shon let's get it

Remember days I was broke
Sleepin' on the floor
Dexter

[Chorus]
Remember days I was broke
I ain't had no money, I was sleepin' on the floor
But now I got that money, yea I want some more
I had to thank God I was sellin' out the shows
Remember sleeping on the floor
I ain't had no money, yea I was really broke
I had to thank God yea I want some mo'
I'm runnin' to the money but I want some more

[Verse]
Remember days on the floor
But now I got that money, yea I'm sellin' out the shows
I'm sippin' on lean, man I need a four
Can't fuck with these niggas man they really broke, yea
Remember I ain't have a thing
But now I'm lookin fresh and ballin' out in magazines
Yo bitch all up on me, man she want a ring
Big head up on me, you can't have a thing
Bentley Coupe, I got that
I got it baby so I had to drop the top back
Niggas braggin, boy you know you need to stop that
I'll send my shooters to yo door, where yo mop at?
Yea, oh where yo mop at?
Remember days I was broke
And now I'm sellin' out the shows
An I ain't going back, I ain't never broke
I swear ain't going back to days of broke

[Chorus]
Remember days I was broke
I ain't had no money, I was sleepin' on the floor
But now I got that money, yea I want some more
I had to thank God I was sellin' out the shows
Remember sleeping on the floor
I ain't had no money, yea I was really broke
I had to thank God yea I want some mo'
I'm runnin' to the money but I want some more

[Outro]
Remember days I was broke (I was broke)
Remember days I was broke
My bad bitch, yea she do coke
Were gonna pop four xans (uh dexter)
Remember days I was broke
I got a bad bitch, yea she love to do the coke
She love to sniff shit all up in her nose
You might have a threesome that's the way it goes yea
Dexter, Dexter
