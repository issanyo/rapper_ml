[Hook: Pachino]
She said, she said, she said
She said “wooh, I make it drip for a milli"
And she want to hang with the gang, I say, “bitch, I’m in Philly”
And she want to come to the studio, bitch, is you silly?
And what is you thinkin’ that’s alcohol, not at all
Lean what I’m sippin’, lean what I’m sippin’
Lean what I’m sippin’, lean what I’m sippin'
Codeine what I’m sippin’, Codeine what I’m sippin’
Yeah, Codeine what I’m sippin’
Lean what I’m sippin’, lean what I’m sippin’
Lean what I’m sippin’
That shit got ‘em dippin’
My man poppin’ pills, my man poppin’ pills
That shit got him dippin’

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
She say “ooh”, she make it drop for a nigga
She make it pop for a nigga
Fly with no wing, helicopt’ with a nigga
Pull up on opps and do shots with a nigga
Never rat out and tell cops on a nigga
Money come in and she shop with a nigga
And when times get hard, man, she [?] for a nigga
I get the drip for my niggas
I get the drip for my woes
All these bitches wanna stalk
Got damn, I can’t talk
Got damn, watch me walk
Got damn, watch me ball
My money [?] they won’t fall
I'm startin' to get good, got it all

Lean what I’m sippin’, lean what I’m sippin'
Codeine what I’m sippin’, Codeine what I’m sippin’
Yeah, Codeine what I’m sippin’
That lean what I’m sippin’, lean what I’m sippin’
Lean what I’m sippin’
My man poppin’ pills, my man poppin’ pills
That shit got him dippin’

[Verse 2: Pachino]
My man poppin’ pills, just scored it and ate it
That high tech shit got me "slur slur"
And as soon as he walk in the club this nigga like “her, her”
I ain’t worry about bitches, I need them bands
Soon as I get ‘em I pull up like “skurr skurr”
And save you that Rolex, that “burr burr”
That’s my bad bitch, I do the shit for her
All that shit that I’m doing, I might get wrapped up, I need a lawyer
It’s alright ‘cause she see me on Worldstar, and see that I’m hot like a baller
See these little bitches in their purses and they take out their phone and they started recordin’
My pops just had my little sister, she two, I swear to God feel like my daughter
Pull the Ford up, now I’m dippin’
Hops in the whips so I’m dippin’
It's a lay up, get them chips in
I ain’t fuckin’ with them bitches
My pops is locked up, so I’m focused on riches
Homies come home in Rovers and stitches
Cats got them up so you now that I miss ‘em
But I still get it in in that motherfuckin’ kitchen
