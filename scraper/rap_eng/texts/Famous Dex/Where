[Intro]
I got you yayo
Little Famous Dex and
So you niggas tell me get some money out here, huh
And we the young niggas takin' over the year
I don't give a fuck, where your money at?

[Hook: Famous Dex]
Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where?
Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where?
These bitches, they all in my hair
My diamonds they shine, chandelier
I'm sippin' on lean, got no beer
You say you get money, nigga where?
Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where?
Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where?
These bitches, they all in my hair
My diamonds they shine, chandelier
I'm sippin' on lean, got no beer
You say you get money, nigga where?

[Verse 1: Go Yayo]
You say you get money, nigga where?
Your bitch see me, stop and stare
Fuck on your bitch, pull her hair
I'm slammin' that bitch, like Ric Flair
Ain't no cuffin' that bitch, we gon' share
She came with her friends, so you know thatâ€™s a pair
So many thooka boy, this shit ain't fair
We aimin' at you, we don't shoot in the air
Diamonds on me so cold
Keepin' the chopper as long as a fishin' pole
Run in your spot, make you hit the floor
Lay his ass down for the good dope
Good dope, good dope, all the work gotta go
Nothin' but 100's bitch I made the honor roll
I remember servin' J's at the Conoco
Bring that work right to your door like a domino


[Hook: Famous Dex]
Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where?
Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where?

I'm sippin' on lean, got no beer
You say you get money, nigga where?
Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where?
Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where? Ah-where?
These bitches, they all in my hair
My diamonds they shine, chandelier

You say you get money, nigga where?

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Oh wait, yeah

I'm ballin', I'm runnin' from here
I'm fuckin' your bitch and I'm pullin' her hair
But nah I'm rich, this stupid ass bitch want a pic
