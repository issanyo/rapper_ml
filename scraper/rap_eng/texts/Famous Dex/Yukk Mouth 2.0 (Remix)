Can't talk with a broke jaw
Slut bitch suck my dick 'til it's lock jaw
In the street so long got a cold heart
Never seen Jordan 11's with the goyard
You never seen 100 clip on the AR
Never seen Inf beams on ya' face dog
Never seen 3 beams with the radar
Throwing bullets at ya' pussy like I'm Brett Farve
Might spazz on a bitch with the four pipe
Might spazz on a bitch like I'm Kanye
Might spazz on a bitch drinking Bombay
Might spazz on the judge at my court date, bitch
