[Intro]
Everybody be askin' me this
Everybody be askin' me that
Why do they be questionin' me?
Like "Dex, where you from, bro?" (Y'all know where the fuck I am from, man)
You know where the fuck I'm from (haha, let's get it, man)
Woo, esketit (DDB shit, man)

[Verse 1]
I'm smokin' on Woods (woo), I'm sippin' on lean 'fore I'm switchin' lanes (drank)
I'm bussin' so hard, I need me a water, I can't feel my brain (I'm brainless)
These bitches they on me, they want them some money, they can't get a thing (at all)
But baby, I want me some brain (that brain), she know I got fame, she know I'm the thing (esketit)
My .30 on me, you know I can't lie, got .40s on beams (on beams, woo)
You run up on me, my .40 go boom, I send him a dream (bang bang, bang bang)
We kick in yo' door like Mike with masks, you think Halloween (Halloween)
But bitch, this ain't Halloween (woo), I just want the money (esketit), I feel like a fiend (esketit)
Hello, they callin' my phone, oh shit, I gotta finesse (I gotta finesse, woo)
They say they want weed, but shit, I told 'em molly's the best (molly's the best, esketit)
They start some fu shit, guess what? You know I'm uppin' my TEC (I'm uppin' my TEC)
I hope I don't up my TEC, if I up my TEC, I send him to rest (esketit, esketit)

[Chorus]
These bitches on me, I told her I don't need her (I don't need her, esketit)
I'm smokin' on weed, you know it's that reefer (it's that reefer, oh)
You try some fu shit, I'm uppin' my [?] (uppin' my [?])
My .40 go [?]
My .30 go bang (woo), my choppa go slang, my .40 go [?] (esketit)
And 'fore I'm switchin' lanes, I'm smokin' that thing (woo), you know it's that reefer (woo)
These bitches they on me, I told her I don't need her, you know I don't need ya (I don't need ya)
Bitch, I don't need ya (I don't need ya)
Bitch I don't need ya (I don't need ya), hoe I don't need ya

[Verse 2]
I'm still cookin' work, it's gettin' real late, I need me a duece (where the drank? Where the drank?)
I call up Fly Shaun, I call up my twin, you know that's the crew (my homies, my boys)
I'd die for my homies, I'd kill for my homies, I ain't talkin' no fu (no fu)
But boy, what you talkin' is fu, you ain't talkin' no green (no guap), conversation is blue (esketit)
These hoes in KOD shakin', it's gettin' wet (gettin' wet, esketit)
I call up my broski Shane and told him bring me some stacks (big bro, bring guap)
I see thirsty niggas, I hope they don't rob, I hope they don't snatch (don't snatch)
'Cause boy if you do try to snatch, lil' bro in the back, and he came with the strap (esketit, esketit)

[Chorus]
These bitches on me, I told her I don't need her (I don't need her, esketit)
I'm smokin' on weed, you know it's that reefer (it's that reefer, oh)
You try some fu shit, I'm uppin' my [?] (uppin' my [?])
My .40 go [?]
My .30 go bang (woo), my choppa go slang, my .40 go [?] (esketit)
And 'fore I'm switchin' lanes, I'm smokin' that thing (woo), you know it's that reefer (woo)
These bitches they on me, I told her I don't need her, you know I don't need ya (I don't need ya)
Bitch, I don't need ya (I don't need ya)
Bitch I don't need ya (I don't need ya), hoe I don't need ya
