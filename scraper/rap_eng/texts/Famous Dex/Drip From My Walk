[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody keep asking me
How I get the drip
How I get drip, this
How I get drippy, that
How I get drip this
How I be fly, this
How I be fucking bitches, that
They say, How I get all the drip
But look

[Hook]
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
(Drippy, Drippy)
I get the drip from my walk

[Verse]
I get the drip from my walk, my baby she come from up north
My money, it come from the vault
Im smoking on dope like Young Dolph
We touch the plug down for the cough
Im sippin' on lean till I fall
My diamonds they shine, they Rick Ross
I hop in the foreign, get lost
(Oh Man Goddamn)
2 bitches they calling me drippy
I fuck them and then we get drippy
My 30, it shoot, Scottie Pippen
Im sippin' on lean till I'm sleepy
I pop me 2 pills I get geeky
I got a lil bitch her name Kiki
I think that lil bitch Puerto Rican
She chill at my crib for the weekend
3 grams in my Wood like a boss
My diamonds they shine with a floss
My foreign it float like a ghost
I hop in that bitch and get lost
My money is starting to get tall
I walk in the mall buy it all
My drippy it came in the sauce
I get the drip from my walk

[Hook]
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
(Drippy, Drippy)
I get the drip from my walk
