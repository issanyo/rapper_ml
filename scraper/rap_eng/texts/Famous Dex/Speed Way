[Intro: Lite Fortunato]
Park the Audi, park the Audi, park the Audi on the one way, park the Audi on the one way
Bank accounts talkin' gun play
Ay, real DDB shit, ya dig?
Dexter and Nato shit, ya dig?
Woo
Ay Dex

[Verse 1: Lite Fortunato]
Park the Audi on the one way
Fake accounts talkin' gun play
We ain't really in the neck goons
Four niggas get your car pulled
This ain't nothin' you ain't ever heard
Countin' up flippin' every birds
Fuckin' bitches make them hit the curb
And duck the laws like my name is Larry
Bitches told me that they newly married
But I fuck 'em later in a 'Yota Camry
Shawty want me, come and meet the family
'Cause her baby father pockets on Stanley
Super savage like I am Randy
But my cousin Randy really come in handy
I could make your auntie pop her pussy
40 gang no lil bih Tiffany

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I throw niggas in the Cadillac
I'm pushin' pack like a jumping jack
Baby girl wanna fuck me, suck me
I know I ain't feelin' that
Me and Nato in New York
All these bitches really dorks
I ride around in an Audi
Oh shit, I bought me a sport
My real name is Dexter
I fuck that bitch Raven, but they callin me Baxter
My 30 might get ya
Lil boy is so mustard, I told him to catch up
Your lil boy better watch his mouth
Diamonds in my mouth like I'm down South
Yeah, I'm runnin' 'round the house
All these bitches in my house
It was me and Nato
Around in New York, you know how that go
All these bitches in the studio
I'm poppin' pills everywhere I go
Now I can't feel my face
Baby girl soo nice like mase
Run up on me I'mma spray
Have a fuckin' nice day
Dexter!

[Outro: Famous Dex]
I-I don't really fuckin' do this shit
I'm not a rapper
Nato's weird
I'm crazy, ahh!
Uh Dexter, uh woah
Oh man god damn!
