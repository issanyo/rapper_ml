[Chorus]
All these niggas turning fool, they some bitches
Pull up with the draco, pussy nigga making wishes
Run around town, always trapping, doing dishes
I ain't give a fuck, mama had to use the fucking dishes
Always keep my bitch on me though
I'm riding with that instant to go
Got a bad bitch, she love do the coke
Do the molly, yeah she love to do both

[Verse 1]
All this trapping, speeding, doin' it for no reason
Got a bad bitch, [?] fuck her for no reason
On the man, hoe
Run up on me, swear that draco get to spraying though
I don't give no fuck, I'll fuck her, then she gotta go
Fuck her, then she gotta go
Look at my chain, that bitch is glow
Look at my ring, you know it gold

[Bridge]
Fuck that bitch, she doing the most
Fuck that bitch, she doing the most
Stars coming with the ghost
Stars coming with the ghost

[Verse 2]
I got money, niggas hate on me, why?
I got shooters, send your ass to the sky
Sipping wok, you know that shit it keep me high
Percs keep me high, percs keep me fly
Percs keep me high, percs keep me fly
Fuck bitch, riding to the bank
I don't want the bitch, because I swear to god it stank
Fendi on my body, running to the bank
Fendi on my body, running to the bank
Jumping out the Wraith, huh, stars
Jumping out the Wraith, huh, stars
Pop me a perc, I'm on Mars
