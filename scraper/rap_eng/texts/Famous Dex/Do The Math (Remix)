[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Huh
The diamond Way
Know what Iâ€™m sayin'?
Haha
She with the shit though

[Hook: Rich The Kid (2x)]
I know she with the shits
I got a diamond wrist
White McDonald bricks
And it might blind ya bitch
I look at your diamonds and laugh
I need a Rihanna, muhfucka she bad
I just be doin' the math
I just be doin' the dash

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
New designer shit
Diamonds on me might blind the bitch (Hey!)
Now you can't find your bitch, suckin' me up I'm like sign the bitch (Damn)
I need one that's on the wrist that's super cold, shit look like a glacier (ice)
I put one on my bitch, I hit it twice, fuck around and erase her
Niggas sittin' on the bench, Rich Forever ball out like the the Pacers
I got a new bitch, then replace her
Lotta purple, nigga play for the Lakers
You a lame Urkel, boy go get your cake up
Bad bitch, Imma fuck up her makeup
Bad bitch, she just came from Jamaica
For that cash clique, have you meeting your maker
Hey, new designer shit
Red bottoms, when I step on the gas
Fetty monster, got these bitches mad
Fuck Instagram, getting instant cash
Hey, Hood Fav, had to hop in my bag
Was on the block, had to hop in the lab
Rode the bus, had to hop in the jag

[Hook: Rich The Kid (2X)]
I know she with the shits
I got a diamond wrist
White McDonald bricks
And it might blind ya bitch
I look at your diamonds and laugh
I need a Rihanna, muhfucka she bad
I just be doin' the math
I just be doin' the dash

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I'm in the back
More cash, fuck a price tag
Give me top in a oupe
2 foreigns, gotta lift up the roof
Fuck what they think
They was sleeping, I was all in the bank
I might make her faint
Still eating, all the pints of the drank
She with the shit, I fuck her sister
Suck on my dick and you kissed her
Boy you a shrimp
Bought the Mazi, dropped the top like a temp
Diamond wrist now, I might take your bitch now
Hollywood, I hold my wrist out the whip now
Gotta bolt, this a ghost
My bitch Say I do the most
Keep the money extra close
They only hating cause they broke
I might take her to the trap again
My diamonds they straight from the Africans
She look like Rihanna, she with the shit
I'm flexing around with the baddest bitch

[Hook: Rich The Kid (2X) & (Famous Dex)]
