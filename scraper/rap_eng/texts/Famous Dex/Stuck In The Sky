[Intro]
Hello there people
How you doin' today?
Well, I'm boutta give y'all a little taste of what I got
Come here lil' big sis'

[Verse 1]
Baby girl what's your name?
I'm fly as hell like a plane
I was smoking is mary jane
I'm sippin' lean with my brain
(Oh shit what brain? I lost it)
I'm gettin' money that's a thing
Bitch I'm runnin' to the bank
All the hundreds make me flank
Fuck a car I want a tank
Fuck a opp tell 'em Link
Bullets sinking like Tink
Touch a nigga like some ink
I used to fall out the ring
But now I fall up in the bank
Young nigga doin' great
I'm doing well eatin' steak
Balenciagas how I keep it
I'll ask a bitch for the digits
Ain't even take a minute
Fuck the bitch I want her sister
Young nigga really pimpin'
All these bitches call me Drippy
If she ain't fucking get it steppin'
I ain't really tryna kick it

[Hook]
Bitch I be fly I'm so high
Bitch I be fly I'm so high

Bitch I be fly I'm so high

[Verse 2]
Bitch I be fly I'm so high
I'm stuck like a kite
Got two bitches they bi
They just wanna ride on my bike
Took the lil' bitch for a ride
Abracadabra no mic
They wanna sing on my mic
Got these hoes messing, they fight
Oh my god, why they fight?
I'm just gettin' high
Diamonds on, now I'm hype
Call up ghost bring the sprite
Bro bring the sprite
But I got up out the jam
Duckin' bitches like a spam
I keep a shooter like man
Throwin' bullet like Cam
Irv please roll some woods
I'm fly as hell bitch I'm good
I'm understood in the hood
I'm fly as hell wish you would
