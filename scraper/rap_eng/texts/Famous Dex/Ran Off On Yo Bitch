[Hook]
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
16 hundred for the kicks, all these diamonds on my wrist
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
16 hundred for the kicks, all these diamonds on my wrist

[Verse 1]
Watch her go run up a check
I just pull up in a ‘Vette
And you know I got your bitch
You kiss her, she be sucking dick
Watch her go run up a check
Watch her go juug and finesse
Watch her go run up a check
Watch her go juug and finesse
Watch her go hit me a lick
It’s 16 hundred for the kicks
Lil Boat just scored on a pint
Oh my god, what a drank
Oh my god it made me faint
All this money make me think
You shooting bullets, man they blank
I’m poppin’ pills, what you think?
I used to fall up in the Rink
But now I fall up in the bank
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your ho
I made the bitch snort blow
I got my dick up in her throat
You cuffed that bitch, man you slow
I put that bitch up in a row
I can never cuff a hoe
You know how this shit goes
I don’t give a shit, I don’t cuff the bitch

[Hook]
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
16 hundred for the kicks, all these diamonds on my wrist
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
I just ran off with your bitch
16 hundred for the kicks, all these diamonds on my wrist
