[Intro]
Hey I'm- shit
I can keep- I can keep goin' over and over
And over, you know what I'm saying?
Like I don't really care what
Stop talking to me
What's up D?
Dexter
Ah-yeah, ah-why?

[Bridge]
Diamonds go live like Periscope
Fuck your lil bitch she a silly ho
Put this dick right in her little throat
Red in my hair, people callin' me Lil Boat

[Interlude]
Like, I don't really think you understand
But like I say, I'm not a rapper, I'm an entertainer
I'm sayin' what, ah-Dexter, look

[Verse]
Diamonds go live like Periscope
Fuck your lil bitch she a silly ho
Put this dick right in her little throat
Red in my hair, people callin' me Lil Boat
No no, that's my bro bro
Two bitches with me, that's a ho ho
I get that money, you so so
30 in my hand, people calling me Mojo
I get that money, you late
Fuck a lil bitch then I bust on her face
Huh, baby girl tastin' taste
Huh, baby girl out of taste
Wait, I can just thirty my waist
You run up on me, shoot you right in your face
I was broke up in the days
Now I'm getting money, swear I gotta be paid
I fuck your bitch with her braids
You wifing her, that's my slave
Lil boy you ain't brave
Jump in that water, I swear I can save
Yeah I be stuck in my ways
That bitch conceited, she stuck in her ways
Sippin' lean, I'm in a daze
Look at my diamonds, I swear you get dazed
Wait, ride with my dawgs like Scooby Doo
I'm getting money, boy who is you?
Your bitch she ain't in to you
Trappin' so hard, been trappin' since middle school
I'm getting money my physical
I'm sipping lean my physical
My diamonds like swimming pool
Diamonds so frosty you think it's invisible

[Hook]
Huh? huh? huh? huh?
Huh? huh? huh? huh?
My 30 on me, he like huh?
I run up on him, he like huh?
I'm sipping on lean, look like huh?
I'm poppin' pills, they like huh?
Huh? huh? huh? huh?
I run up on him, he like huh?
I run up on him, he like huh?
Huh? huh? huh? huh?
My 30 on me, they like huh?
I run up on him, he like huh?
