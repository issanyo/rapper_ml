Girl, you look cute on Instragram, but that's too digital
To keep it real wit' you, girl, I wanna get physical
You so different from these hoes, they so different from you

I wanna feel on you baby, fuck that digital shit

I stay 10 toes on the cement, but I'm fallin' for you
No I don't want no other bitch, unless you want her too
If you wit it I'm wit it, lets get it
I'mma hit it til it drip, then I dip, make you miss it
Damn, damn, damn, you soo materialistic
But I seen you in no clothes, and baby don't forget it
Online shoppin', what you want, I got digital guap

Fuck 12, but you too bad, I might cuff like a cop
Fuck 12, but you too bad, I might cuff like a cop
