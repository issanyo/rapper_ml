[Hook: Famous Dex]
I just pull up in a straight
I had to pour me a eight
I took your bitch, you was late
Then I bust up on her face
All my diamonds they ain't fake
My money on me yea I'm great
Flash get 'em out the way
My plug name is rozay
I just pull up in a straight
I had to pour me a eight
I took your bitch, you was late
Then I bust up on her face
All my diamonds they ain't fake
My money on me yea I'm great
Flash get 'em out the way
My plug name is rozay

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
My plug name is Rozay
He just scored on an eighth
We ridin' around in a straight
Flash get 'em out the way
Balmains on my jeans
All these fucking diamonds rings
And bitches want wedding rings
But she can't get a thing
I'm ridin' around with the crew
Carl Phresh, what it do
My boy crazy like the zoo
He ballin' like he got the flu
These bitches slimey like some soup
I kick her out now she through
They going around like the loop
My money on me and it's blue
Lets get it!

[Verse 2: Carl Phresh]
Getting money every day
Flexing hard every way
Got your bitch, thats my bae
She gon fuck me every way
Getting money thats the habit
Bitches hopping like a rabbit
All my niggas getting cabbage
Most of my homies be savage
Most of my niggas need money
These niggas broke and they bummy
You laughing, boy this ain't funny
Most of these bitches be scummy
I don't fuck with these little hoes
Through the damn section with my woes
We whipping white with that snow
My wrist too icy it's froze
