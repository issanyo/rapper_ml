[Verse 1: Warhol.ss]
Steppin' out this bitch I'm smellin' like some money
Pockets full of Fetti, I ain't never fold a hunnid'
Bet them niggas worried bout' it check for Twitter
Fuck that shit, I'm worried about that check for real' though
Big body Benz, Forgiato Rims, Tan Molly Timbs
I was in the gym
Workout with this shit, you know I go for 10
I can tell who real so I don't need a friend
I can see who fake I got some better lens
Call that picture perfect
Feelin' like the man
Tell that bitch that I don't need her
Better call her man
If he tripping' we gon' slump em' like a fuckin' xan
Rubber band baby need my hunnids' blue
Told dat' talk I send these lions straight up out the Zoo
I can't hate on no one that's not what I do
He be bitchin', we got' turn him to some fuckin' food

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Try 'em, try 'em

I know this lil' boy is mine
Run up on him with the nine

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Try 'em, try 'em
I know this lil' boy is fake
Matter fact cause he's a snake
I put the K to his face
Try 'em, try 'em
Jump in the water don't drown
Boy don't go outta bounds
I am a king and that is my crown
Sippin' that Wock til' the top
I used to trap on the block
Wait, put dope in my sock
Fuckin' bitches in my sock
Wait, that bitch she a thot
I never talk to the cops
Yeah, new check gotta fox
Bad bitch and a fox
Run up on him drop a dime
Run up on him never lyin'
And you know I got my iron
Bad bitch she a dime
I might just bust on her face
I get the money you late
Pullin' off in a skraight
Pour a six to the face
I just might chill wit' your boo
I get them hunnids' they blue
Yeah, used to trap out the school
Nigga never knew the rules
Woah, I just might run up on him
Huh, I just might run up on him
Huh, put the .30 up on him
Huh, I just might run up on him

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Try 'em, try 'em
I know that lil' boy is lyin'
I know that lil' boy is mine
Run up on him got my iron
Try 'em, try 'em
Run up on him then I try 'em
Run up on him then I try 'em
Run up on him then I try 'em
Try 'em, try 'em
I know this lil' boy is lyin'
Run up on him with the nine
Run up on him got my iron
Try 'em, try 'em

I know this lil' boy is mine
Run up on him with the nine
