[Chorus: Famous Dex]
12 just kick in the spot
You know that ain't stoppin' up
I used to trap on the block
Aye yeah, I had to get money up
Bust on that bitch like a Glock
Aye yeah, you know that ain't double dutch
I just pour a six in my pops
Aye yeah now I feel hella stuck
I had to go get my money up
I had to go get my money up
I had to go get my money up
I had to, I had to, I had to, I had to
I had to go get my money up
I had to go get my money up
I had to go get my money up

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
These niggas tryna take my bread, l'eego my eggo
Blue stip on my hunnid yeah, whoa whoa
Big bankroll, got a big bank roll, I do not know what to do with it
She got ass like whoa, but I know what to do with it
Bust on that bitch like a Glock, dexter coutin' the guap
I used to be on that hot shit, now I'm coolin' with a hot bitch
If I scuff my Airs, I'm gonna get another pair
She clean and cute, eat on that pussy like pear
I had to go get my money, put my dick in your bitch tummy
Ooh, bih you is soo lucky, hella bitches wanna fuck me
Back in the day I was bummy, I had to go get my money
I had to go get my money, I had to go get my money

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
12 just kick in the spot
You know that ain't stoppin' up
I used to trap on the block
Aye yeah, I had to get money up
Bust on that bitch like a Glock
Aye yeah, you know that ain't double dutch
I just pour a six in my pops
Aye yeah now I feel hella stuck
I had to go get my money up
I had to go get my money up
I had to go get my money up
I had to, I had to, I had to, I had to
I had to go get my money up
I had to go get my money up
I had to go get my money up
