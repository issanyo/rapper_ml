[Verse]
There's a lot of niggas out here actin phony
Talking like you real, but I know you phony
If you ain't talking money, that's the shit that blow me
Pop 4 xans fuck around and OD
Flash run up on em' if a nigga owe me
If you ain't DDB, boy you dont know me
Smoking wood i'm like damn where the hoes be
And i'm fly as hell, where the fucking sun be
Wait, your bitch she a thottie
She just wants to kick it, I don't know karate
The pussy so good, the head is so great
Guess what? Her neck off her body
I'm bustin' off molly's
I don't wear versace
I'm ballin' like scotty
Pull off in that audi
That bitch wanna hang, I told that bitch audi

[Outro]
Haha
That bitch wanna hang I told that bitch audi
You know how I'm rockin' man
Duhh Dummyy
DDB shit

Let's get it
Oh yeah, all you fuckboys listen
Don't believe that media shit (Please don't)
That shit all fu, you know how I'm rocking' man I'm always in Chicago man
Woo
Let's get it, let's get it
