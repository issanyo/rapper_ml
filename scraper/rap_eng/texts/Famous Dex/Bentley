[Verse 1]
Finesse a plug out some pounds cause we know he was a goofy
Run up on me I'ma shoot Man my thirty is a movie
Who the fuck is fooly? I don't even know fooly
Man that boy is goofy I pop some pills now I'm stupid
I'm ridin round in a hover I took ya bitch you a loser
Now I got you lookin' stupid ha ha you lookin stupid
Try to rob me a toolie hell yea I got my toolie
Man you know I can't never lack man this shit ain't Suzy
Man I gotta get some bands oh shit where my fans
I just popped four xans I took off to Japan
Baby girl where ya man? Now she got me on the gram
I ain't even wanna take a pic now I gotta block her spam

[Hook]
Man I want me a Bentley (x2)
You know my pockets ain't empty
You know a nigga ain't stingy
Man I want me a Bentley (x2)
You know my pockets ain't empty
You know that money I spend it
Man I want me a Bentley (x6)
You know my pockets ain't empty that money I know how to spend it
