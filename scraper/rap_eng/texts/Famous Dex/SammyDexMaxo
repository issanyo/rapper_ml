[Intro: Famous Dex & Maxo Kream]
Mixing lean like gumbo We don't fuck with fat hoes
I just left Houston
With 4 little bitches it's time for a movie
Yeah ah Dexter, yeah ah what, Maxo
Yeah I'm next ho, I'm trill
I'm next ho, Trill Sammy
Ah yeah, oh man God damn

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
I just left Houston
With 4 little bitches it's time for a movie
My diamonds so fuedy
You run up on me turn you right into sushi
It's me and Sammy, me and Maxo
We balling hard in the studio
And we ain't even hit the lotto
They followed us everywhere we go

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Sammy, Dexter, Maxo
Quarterbacks, we pass hoes
Mixing lean like gumbo
We don't fuck with fat hoes
On the block, Dikembe
Dropping bricks like sensei
New change in the dang it's a bust down
Run train on your main chick, she a bust down

[Bridge: Trill Sammy]
Yeah Trill Sammy keep a bad bitch
Spending hella racks up in Saks Fifth
Walk up in the club, lights on me
Big old Rollie sitting on my wrist, diamonds freeze

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Look my diamonds so cold
Run up on me, get exposed
Want 5 for a show
Had to go pour me a four, woah
Yeah I fuck on your ho
Yeah I just bought me a Ferrari
100 tats on my body
I fuck your bitch now you sorry
I'm geeking right up in the party, yeah

[Verse 3: Maxo Kream]
Macarena, diamonds dancing
Tropicana, codeine, Fanta
Cocaine, Dracos, Arm & Hammer
In your living room like Santa
Stashio go nuts like planters
30 choppers, Blue bandanas
Monkeyness, my clips bananas
Molly, pill, Hannah Montana

[Verse 4: Trill Sammy]
Want five for a show
Balenci' my toes
Bape on my clothes
Been rocking these shows
From city to city, been rocking these shows
I'm blocking these hoes
They counting that paper, I think I need more
No time for a ho
I'm riding with dex and I pour me a four
You know this for sho'

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Sammy, Dexter, Maxo
Quarterbacks, we pass hoes
Mixing lean like gumbo
We don't fuck with fat hoes
On the block, Dikembe
Dropping bricks like sensei
New change in the dang it's a bust down
Run train on your main chick, she a bust down
Sammy, Dexter, Maxo
Quarterbacks, we pass hoes
Mixing lean like gumbo
We don't fuck with fat hoes
On the block, Dikembe
Dropping bricks like sensei
New change in the dang it's a bust down
Run train on your main chick, she a bust down
