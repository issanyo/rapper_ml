[Chorus]
Kickin' bitches out the trap like Robbie Gould
I'm all about a play like Robbie Gould
I be getting to the gwap like Robbie Gould
I'm all about a play like Robbie Gould
Robbie Gould, I think I'm Robbie Gould
I be getting to the gwap like Robbie Gould
Robbie Gould, I think I'm Robbie Gould
Kickin' bitches out the trap like Robbie Gould

[Verse 1]
Kickin' bitches out the trap like Robbie Gould
If you ain't talkin' pesos, girl you got to go
I'm like a leprechaun, bitch where my gold?
You talkin' 'bout you want some money, baby no
Your boyfriend wearin' fufu, girl he so broke
I'm bustin' off a pill, I need to pour a four
Fucked your bitch about two times
Then she call me on my new line
I kick her out on the green line
Robbie Gould Junior, bitch punting

[Chorus]
Kickin' bitches out the trap like Robbie Gould
I'm all about a play like Robbie Gould
I be getting to the gwap like Robbie Gould
I'm all about a play like Robbie Gould
Robbie Gould, I think I'm Robbie Gould
I be getting to the gwap like Robbie Gould
Robbie Gould, I think I'm Robbie Gould
Kickin' bitches out the trap like Robbie Gould

[Verse 2]
And I'm all about a play like Robbie Gould
You be talking to the 12, boy you a ho
I heard you got the pound for the low
We found out where you live, boy we gon' scope
Kicking bitches out the trap like Robbie Gould
I can't trust a bitch 'cause she gon' go
And I'm all about my gwap, stay on my toes
And I'm all about a play like Robbie Gould

[Chorus]
Kickin' bitches out the trap like Robbie Gould
I'm all about a play like Robbie Gould
I be getting to the gwap like Robbie Gould
I'm all about a play like Robbie Gould
Robbie Gould, I think I'm Robbie Gould
I be getting to the gwap like Robbie Gould
Robbie Gould, I think I'm Robbie Gould
Kickin' bitches out the trap like Robbie Gould
