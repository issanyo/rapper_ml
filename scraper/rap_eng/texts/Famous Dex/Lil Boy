[Intro]
That lil boy
That lil boy ain't up on shit
That lil boy ain't up on shit, run up on him with the stick

[Hook]
That lil boy ain't up on shit (x7)
Smokin' my weed out the crib, run up on him with the stick
That lil boy ain't up on shit (x4)
Talking like he got the stick, I just wanna fuck his bitch

[Verse 1]
That lil boy ain't up on shit
That lil boy ain't up on shit
Always knew you was a hoe, shooters kick right in your door lay right on the floor
Then we put dick in your bitch
Then we put dick in your bitch
Shoot a nigga, fuck the stick
Like a blow, he on the fix
Don't talk to me now, thought you be scoopin' around you fuck with the clowns
Choppa nigga, fuck arounds
Choppa nigga, fuck arounds
Who the fuck is this lil boy?
I don't know this lil boy
My choppa on me get destroyed, put his body in the foil
Like i'm enjoy, I get that money no war
Look at me I am the boy
I get the money like last year, I get the bricks then they disappear
Tattoos everywhere, dreads all up in my hair
Lil boy why you stare?

[Hook]
That lil boy (x2)
That lil boy ain't up on shit (x7)
Smokin' my weed out the crib, run up on him with the stick
That lil boy ain't up on shit (x4)
Talking like he got the stick, I just wanna fuck his bitch

[Outro]
That lil boy ain't up on shit (x2), run up on him with the stick
Better watch out for the dicks (x3), Rozay pull up real quick
