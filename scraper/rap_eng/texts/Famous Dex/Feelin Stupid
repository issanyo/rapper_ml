[Hook]
Parking lot, pimpin'
Cooling with the hoes
Pour a four
Where the coke
Watch her shove it up her nose
She booty feeling stupid
Feeling right up on her booty give me coochie
Bae you give me coochie
Bae that bitch she stupid

[Verse]
Fuckin' that bitch last year
I got them diamonds, my ear
Sipping lean like it's beer
Run up on him shoot him just like a deer
Run up on him shoot him just like a deer
I get the money, no wear
I was broke like last year
I'm getting that cash
I hop in a lamb I go fast
Watch it go fast
I'm going to Dex
It's twelve right on my ass
Tense on my face, I'm a master
Thirty on me, yeah I rob you
All this money, yeah I'm a goblin
Suck on my dick, watch you swallow
Hit up my follow
Watchin' these niggas they falling
Bullets they soon in they howling
Used to play ball up at Ogden
Used to jump niggas at Odgen
Nah I be getting this money
Diamonds on me and it's sunny
I fuck your bitch cause she funny
Follow that bitch then I squirt on these brains
I fuck your bitch cause she funny
Follow that bitch and I swear they be bunnies
That lil' boy ain't got no money
That lil' boy ain't got no money
Dexter
