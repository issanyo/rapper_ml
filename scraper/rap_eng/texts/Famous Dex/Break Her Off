[Pre-Hook: 12TilDee]
Girl put your hands on your knees
Like you done run out of breath
Climb down that pole
Lil' mama don't need no help
She fuckin' with me 'cuz she know that I'm breaking her off
(I'm breaking her off)
Broke nigga throwin' no cash, you runnin' your mouth

[Hook: 12TilDee (Dexter)]
Break her off (break her off)
Break her off (break her off)
Break her off (break her off)
Break her off (break her off)
Break that ass off like a kickhat
I just throw the money, she could run it back
Fuck around a ton, that bitch a hundred stacks
We'll don't do no talkin', where your money at?
Break her off (break her off)
Break her off (break her off)
Break her off (break her off)
Break her off (break her off)
Break that ass off like a KitKat
I just throw the money, she could run it back
Fuck around a ton, that bitch a hundred stacks
We'll don't do no talkin', where your money at?

[Verse 1: 12TilDee]
I know lil' mama, she gon' come and flirt
I'm the reason why she comin' to work
I show a dub, she show me love
She pop it for pimp and she fuckin' it up, fuckin' it up
She fuck with a balla, lil' boy stop playin'
You tryin' to wife her, she really can't hear what you sayin'
Why is you cuffin' them bands? Throw this shit up make it land
Watch me switch hands, she do my favorite lil' dance
I make it rain like Rihanna and she go to work
Trained to get the money first, Franklin make her go berserk

[Pre-Hook: 12TilDee]
Bitch put your hands on your knees, like you done run out of breath

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Break her off, I get that money, I break her off
Brooker so hard, I break her off
Runnin' for me, I'mma set it off
I just pull up in my Jeep
I pull in the Masi
All of these stacks on my body
Lookin' for me, a lil' hardy
Suck me like Dolliez (Dexter)
Break her hand, break her so hard, that break a friend, what
I'll break the man
Lookin' so good man, I think they twins, oh what
That's the end of the story, huh
Fuck a lil' bitch, she want mor√©, what
This bitch she want money
Put my dick up in her tummy (Dexter)

[Pre-Hook: 12TilDee (Dexter)]
