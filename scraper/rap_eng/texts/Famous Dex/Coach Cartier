[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Your bitch gon' die for the dick
She spend mad time with the kid
Rainbow shot my wrist
She make them titties twitch
Adidas done gave me the check
Go to Tourneau and cop Rolex
Your bitch obsessed
Thumb in her butt, yes!
Come and just fuck with the set
And we're buckin' the TEC, with my niggas it's facts
They be protecting your neck
Ice bucket challenge with Dex
Those are not Margiela
Hol' up, I'll do you one better
Rainbow shot my wrist
Watch them diamonds glist
