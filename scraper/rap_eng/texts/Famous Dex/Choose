They choose, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
She look at my wrist and say ooh
They look at my necklace, say ooh
That bitch on my dick, she say ooh

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
They look at my money, say ooh
They look at my wrist and say ooh
They look at my foreign and say ooh
Ooh, Ooh

[Verse 1]
Ooh, Ooh
I’m smoking on dope, who is you?
I’m riding ‘round in the coupe
A baby suck me like some soup
Ooh, Ooh ,  a 30 on me, watch I shoot
I call Flash, what it do
I swear my boy, go shoot
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
I be flexing after school
I be cappin’ with the crew
My money on me and it’s blue
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
MOE, what it do?
Mack Mane man what it do?
Alpo what it do?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Supreme , all Balmain clothes
I can’t really trust these hoes
Let me pour me up a four
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
I swear your girlfriend, Givenchy shoes
I got her sucking on her knees
I make that bitch sing the blues

[Hook]
They choose, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
She look at my wrist and say ooh
They look at my necklace, say ooh
That bitch on my dick, she say ooh
Ooh, Ooh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
They look at my money, say ooh
They look at my wrist and say ooh
They look at my foreign and say ooh
Ooh, Ooh
