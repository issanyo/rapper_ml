She wanna boot up on Molly (Geek!)
I just might boot up on Molly (Molly!)
She want a xan in her body (Xan!)
Anything she want I got it (Got It!)
Don’t be afraid lil bitch
She fell in love with narcotics

I just narcotic her body
She geeked up she booted up

[Verse 1] : UnoTheActivist
I just narcotic her body
Told her slow down I ain't started yet
She said molly and xan with her starter pack
I’m like [?] bitches that started that
She just told me she liked to get wasted
Not with it you'd rather not start with that
I’m gon put one in your starter cap
I’ma leave you dead man where you started at
And I heard that you love to get geeked
And that molly turn you to a freak
And you know that I’m smoking OG
Try to run up that chopper on me
So you never try run up on me
And never try to get one up on me
I fucked the lil bitch and she sleaze
She pop a perc and gon geek
