[Intro: Famous Dex]
Nothin'
I, Haha
I like be like this
Dice what up bro?
Ha, Dexter
Hmm

[Hook: Famous Dex & Dice Soho]
Remember them days when I was broke
Told my self no I ain’t going back
Nowadays shit i’m on the road
Say you got money, where your foreign at?
Check the time on the wrist watch
Flexin' got these haters pissed off
Smokin' gas about to lift off
She want to kick it with a big boss
Everybody wanna get groovy
Pop a lil Xan, lets hop in the jacuzzi
I just might feel on her coochie
She want to shoot a lil movie
Check the time on the wrist watch
Flexin' got these haters pissed off
Smokin' gas about to lift off
She want to kick it with a big boss

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Look at my diamonds got hang time
Walk in the bank yea that’s bank time
Got a lil bitch she a dime
Done with that bitch now I’m switchin' lanes now

[Verse 2: Dice Soho]
Diamonds wet like a jacuzzi
All my bitches bad and boujie
I put my bitches in gucci
No I do not want that hoe she a groupie

[Verse 3: Famous Dex]
I know your boyfriend a goofy
He is so broke, just look at his jewelry
Wait don’t copy the wave
Lookin' at me I know you just took it

[Verse 4: Dice Soho]
I’m out of purple
Lean got me moving in circles
I feel like a turtle
And the ice on my neck wetter than Squirtle
