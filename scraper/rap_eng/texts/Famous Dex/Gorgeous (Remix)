[Intro: Famous Dex & Rich the Kid]
Yeah
Hop in a motherfuckin' Benz, huh
Hop in a motherfuckin' Benz
Pull up on her got... a Xan', what?
Fuck her one time 'cause she gorgeous, ayy
This the remix, huh
This the remix, yeah
This the remix, what? Yeah

[Chorus: Thouxanbandfauni]
Counting some blue while I'm adding this green
I had lost count off a bean
Old girl still in the hood
My new girl in Vogue magazine
I fuse a clip with a 40
Darth Vader red beam
VVS, I think it's gorgeous
Diamonds reflect in the lean
Counting some blue while I'm adding this green
I had lost count off a bean
My old girl she still in the hood
My new ho in Vogue magazine
I fuse a clip with a 40
Darth Vader red beam
VVS, I think it's gorgeous
Diamonds reflect in the lean
Counting some blue while I'm adding this green
I had lost count off a bean
My old girl she still in the hood
My new ho in Vogue magazine
I fuse a clip with a 40
Darth Vader red beam
VVS, I think it's gorgeous
Diamonds reflect in the lean
Counting some blue while I'm adding this green
I had lost count off a bean
My old girl she still in the hood
My new ho in Vogue magazine
I fuse a clip with a 40
Darth Vader red beam
VVS, I think it's gorgeous
Diamonds reflect in the lean

[Verse 1: Thouxanbandfauni]
Ragin' like Majin Vegeta
My playbunny mansion, the Easter
Go'n park the Benz by the meter
I ain't mean to scratch up the Beamer
I dropped that boy on his keister
Give a white girl jungle fever
Since a jit I been grippin' on heaters
Big homie said leave it to Beaver
Fuckin' that ho 'til she seizure
Gang full of Grim Reapers
I keep my balance like Libras
I like my woman conceited
Give me your ho for a feature
Swerve off and shit on my teacher
Don't keep my side bitch a secret
Keep one in my chamber, no secret
Retrograde got 'em tweakin'
See that ho next weekend
Fucked her that same evening
I knew that lil' bitch tweaking
Really the lil' bitch is fiendin'
I need that purple I'm leanin'
I want that purple I'm leanin'
I want that purple I'm leanin'

[Chorus: Thouxanbandfauni]
Counting some blue while I'm adding this green
I lost my count off a bean
My old girl still in the hood
My new ho in Vogue magazine
I fuse a clip with a 40
Darth Vader red beam
VVS, I think it's gorgeous
Diamonds reflect in the lean
Diamonds reflect in the lean
Diamonds reflect in the lean
Counting some blue while I'm adding this green
I lost my count off a bean
My old girl still in the hood
My new ho in Vogue magazine
I fuse a clip with a 40
Darth Vader red beam
VVS, I think it's gorgeous
Diamonds reflect in the lean

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Fuck her one time 'cause she perfect
She get Chanel and she squirtin'
I put them racks in your Birkin
The Rari, the Wraith, no suburban
I get the money, that blue cheese
Me and Dexter ride the Maybach like a limousine
Niggas they wanted to be me
Done Guccied my bitch and the LV
Gorgeous, pinky ring, that's your mortgage
Fuck her one time then I hope she important
Rich Forever on the Forbes List
My niggas ain't nothin' but bosses
Ooh, she a freak for Instagram
Bitch, I woke up with them bands
I need a ho with a visa
Look at my wrist, that's a new freezer
We get the money, it's easy
She think I love her but she geekin'
Pull up on her, now she fiendin'
I need that hundred a feature
Actavis sippin', I'm leanin'
Pour out the pint then I'm sleeping
Magazine model, I hope that she swallow
I'm kicking her out for no reason

[Chorus: Thouxanbandfauni & Famous Dex]
Counting some blue while I'm adding this green
I lost my count off a bean
My old girl still in the hood

[Verse 3: Famous Dex]
I be so high off the lean, huh
I be so fly, magazine, huh
I get them birds, make 'em sing
Fucking your bitch, yeah, she want a ring (Dexter)
VVS, I think it's gorgeous
Run up on me, get the beam
Rich Forever be my team
I be so high off the bean
I just pulled up in a Wraith, huh
I get that money, you late, huh
Finessin' the plug, I'm straight
Can't fuck with them, man, they talk to the jakes (Dexter)
I got them diamonds, they all in my ring
Lil' boy, you ain't on a thing
Diamonds all in my teeth
Bankroll in my jeans

[Chorus: Thouxanbandfauni]
