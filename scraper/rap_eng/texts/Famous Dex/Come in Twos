[Intro: Kodie Shane]
Man, this beat so hard
Yeah, yeah
I know, I know, I know
Big roll, I roll
Stack up
I know, I know, I know
Run up, on me
[?]

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
If you come then come in twos
I know it's cliché but it's rules
She wanna break all my rules
She wanna wear all my jewels
Drive the Chevy like a foreign
My bitch could never be borin'
My bitch, she foreign, she [?]
I put my old bitch in storage

[Verse 1: Kodie Shane]
For the hot weather, got a cool bitch
My diamonds wet like a pool pit
This ain't in stores, it's some new shit
I don't know her, that's a new bitch
I get so high that I feel like a moon man
If it's not right then improve it
She wanna fuck with my movement
Really, she wanna just use me (okay)
Baby hot like a jacuzzi
Think I'm 'bout to make a movie
Baby, watch me like a movie (yeah)
Think I'm bout to go stupid
My brother crazy, he go stupid
And they let him bring his tool in (yeah)

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
If you come then come in twos
I know it's cliché but it's rules
She wanna break all my rules
She wanna wear all my jewels
Drive the Chevy like a foreign
My bitch could never be borin'
My bitch she foreign, she [?]
I put my old bitch in storage

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I put my old bitch in storage
I just copped me a new foreign
Bad bitch, and they goin'
I get that molly, she glowin', wait
And baby girl, you are geekin'
I don't know you are freaky, hmm, yeah
I don't even wanna meet ya
My lil' bitch, she foreign
She suckin' the dick in the mornin'
I'm kickin' her out in the mornin', yeah
And "bye bye" to you haters
Hi, I fucked your bitch in the night, yeah
In the night, ooh
I can't stand all these haters
They laugh in your face 'cause you a moneymaker
But it's Dexter and Kodie Shane, yeah
Your money ain't gonna never [?] name, yeah

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
If you come then come in twos
I know it's cliché but it's rules
She wanna break all my rules
She wanna wear all my jewels
Drive the Chevy like a foreign
My bitch could never be borin'
My bitch, she foreign, she [?]
I put my old bitch in storage
If you come then come in twos
I know it's cliché but it's rules
She wanna break all my rules
She wanna wear all my jewels
Drive the Chevy like a foreign
My bitch could never be borin'
My bitch, she foreign, she [?]
I put my old bitch in storage
