[Hook]
Put Three grams up in my Wood, now a nigga feeling good
Tryna rob me I wish a nigga would, bitch I'm a boss like suge
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, never seen a Young nigga jug
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, never seen a Young nigga jug
Put Three grams up in my Wood, now a nigga feeling good
Tryna rob me I wish a nigga would, bitch I'm a boss like suge
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, never seen a Young nigga jug
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, never seen a Young nigga jug

[Verse]
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, bitch I had to get it out the mud
Put Three grams off in my Wood bitch I'm a boss like suge
Run on me wish a nigga would flash yeah leave him like ugh
Wrap you up then we put you in the Woods now you dont bout where its good
Flash sean got the xans for the low, finnesing yo bitch for some dope
Can't trust lil bitch cause she go said she wants Money thats a no
Call lean man tell him bring a 4 these boys ain't got it man they broke
DDB thats the movement, you ain't know? if you ain't with it then you slow
Peso, I'm all about peso
I'm fucking yo bitch, and then I go lay low
I'm stacking my blocks up no lego
She all on my dick tell her let go
I'm smoking on blunts that is A 1
I'm smoking on Woods that is A roll

[Hook]
Put Three grams up in my Wood, now a nigga feeling good
Tryna rob me I wish a nigga would, bitch I'm a boss like suge
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, never seen a Young nigga jug
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, never seen a Young nigga jug
Put Three grams up in my Wood, now a nigga feeling good
Tryna rob me I wish a nigga would, bitch I'm a boss like suge
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, never seen a Young nigga jug
You ain't never seen a Young nigga jug, never seen a Young nigga jug
