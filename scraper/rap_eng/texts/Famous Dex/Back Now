Pull in your block with the Macs out
We tryna take off blow your back out
No nick cannon boy but I wild out
I get off them pills then I wild out
I get off the Henny then I spazz out
I fuck your lil bitch and she pass out
I used to be broke but I'm back now
I walk in the mall then I cash out
I used to be broke but I'm back now
I used to be broke but I'm back now
I used to be broke but I'm back now
I used to be broke but I'm back now
I used to be broke but I'm back now
I used to be broke but I'm back now
I walk in the mall then I cash out
I fuck your lil bitch and she pass out

[Verse: Famous Dex]
I fuck your lil bitch then she pass out
I walk in the mall then I cash out
I call up Guwop when the stacks out
The moves comin' in on a Greyhound
I'm smokin' on dope 'till I pass out
I'm sippin' on lean 'till I pass out
I caught me a stain bring the masks out
Put one in his dome then I ride out
The bitches they likin' my swag
I think they likin' the dab
No I didn't make up the dab
I do it two times and they mad
These bitches they see me they glad
Lil' baby where is your man?
Baby I'm focused on bands
They sleepin' on me like a xan
I went from nothin' to sumthin'
Now I'm gettin' that money
Bitch I be flexin like Bubble
My big homie he got the onions
Bitch I ain't playin' no games
You try me boy you'll get change
Me and you not the same
Boy better stay in your lane

[Verse: Famous Irv]
I used to be broke but I'm back now
Don't want the lil' bitch cause she wack now
Grabbed us a few pounds bust that pack down
Grabbed us a few wish then I rap now
You should see my bankroll this bitch growin' on me
My pockets so fat got them rolls on me
Don't fuck with fu niggas they so phony
Just got a new move with the scope on it
I keep some blue hundreds that "Blue cheese"
Got your bitch on my dick and she on her knees
Finessed her for top her pussy weak
Then I kick that bitch out like I'm Jet Li
Flash smokin' we ain't DDB
Fuck that nigga he ain't none to me
Just another dead opp in my weed
3 grams on my woods I'm so high I can't breathe
