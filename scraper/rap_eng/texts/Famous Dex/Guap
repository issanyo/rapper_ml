[Intro: Famous Dex]
Ooh, cool with your bitch smoking sherbert, ooh
Hold on, you makin' me, ooh
Know what I'm sayin', baby girl, you makin' me nervous, baby
Relax, just relax a lil bit
House shoes on my feet, and they Gucci too
Dexter
Daytrip took it to 10
Ooh, huh, yeah

[Verse 1: KILLY]
What? Yeezy sent me Yeezy's (yeah, what)
50 Gs in these jeans (what)
KILLY collectin' the keys (what)
Hit the scene, limousine (me)
Foreign police, had to leave
Too many brand new faces
I count up these dead faces
Never let go, stop lurkin'
Do it for the bands, show me what your worth is (yeah)

[Chorus: KILLY]
I got guap, guap, guap (bands), got that guap on me (guap)
Hey, call me Guapanese (yeah), smoke that cheddar cheese (yes)
Hey, drink that Hennessy, it give me energy (what)
I can't roll in peace, please just let me be
Couple bands on me, I'm the band man
Pray I never crash, made that grandma bread
200 on the dash, I got jet lag
I got big bags, and that's a big fact

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Uh, yeah, uh, what, uh, Dexter
Cool with your bitch smokin' sherbert
Lil baby, you makin' me nervous
Bust in your hood , yeah, I'm purgin'
Hop in the Lamb, yeah, I'm swervin'
Huh, wait, walk in the mall and I spent 50 Gs
Bankrolls all up on me
Rich Forever be my team
All these niggas wannabes
Hop in the Lamb, you know that I'm swervin'
Go to your hood, yeah, I'm purgin'
Mask on my face, can't be nervous
I'm never lackin' or lurkin'
Wait, walk in the mall and I spent 50 Gs
I fell in love with the cheese (I did)
I got your bitch on her knees
Boy, you don't wanna beef
AP, it shine in the light
Ooh, I mix Ciroc with the ice
I got two bitches, they bi
Feed 'em Percs, now they high
But that bitch makin' me nervous
Ballin' hard, Julius Erving
I came a long way from servin'
I'm smokin' on dope, mix that cookie with sherbert

[Chorus: KILLY]
Guap, guap, guap (bands), got that guap on me (guap)
Hey, call me Guapanese (yeah), smoke that cheddar cheese (yes)
Hey, drink that Hennessy, it give me energy (what)
I can't roll in peace, please just let me be
Couple bands on me, I'm the band man
Pray I never crash, made that grandma bread
200 on the dash, I got jet lag
I got big bags, and that's a big fact

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Yeah, what
I drop 50 on a charm, bought that bitch a whole salon
New freezer on my arm, fuck a bitch 'cause we ballin'
Niggas, they love to hate, [?] a fan of Jakes
Killin' rappers, on a rampage, my diamonds cut you, get a Band-Aid
Yeah, we gotta hear you niggas, pull out the brand new Bentley
Dexter, he met Dex, I throw you the lighter, we lit
Diamonds bright like a pit, pint, we pour up 6
Gucci on my dick, flexin' 'cause I'm rich

[Chorus: KILLY]
I got guap, guap, guap (bands), got that guap on me (guap)
Hey, call me Guapanese (yeah), smoke that cheddar cheese (yes)
Hey, drink that Hennessy, it give me energy (what)
I can't roll in peace, please just let me be
Couple bands on me, I'm the band man
Pray I never crash, made that grandma bread
200 on the dash, I got jet lag
I got big bags, and that's a big fact

[Outro: KILLY]
