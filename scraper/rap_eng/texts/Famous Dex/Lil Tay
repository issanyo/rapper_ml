[Intro: Lil Tay]
A message to all y'all broke ass haters. Y'all ain't doing nothing like Lil Tay. I'm only 9 years old. I don't got no license but I still drive this sports car bitch. Your favorite rapper ain't even doing it like Lil Tay

[Hook]
Flex up like Lil Tay
If that nigga talking down he gon' get hit out with that K
Flex up like Lil Tay
[?] down my arm, a nigga laughing to the bank
Flex up like Lil Tay
If that nigga talking down [?] gon' hit him from long range
Send them shooters to his house and now that boy be MIA
Why they hating on the boy?
Swear it's cause I'm getting cake

[Verse 1]
Is it because I'm making [?]
Shipping mollies [?] state

Gold chains, gold Range, nigga gold things
Got some bitches, got some propane

[Verse 2]
Flexing so hard you think I'm Lil Tay
