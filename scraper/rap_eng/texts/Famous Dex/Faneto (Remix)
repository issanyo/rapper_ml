[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
I'm DDB, Bitch you know about me
I hang in these streets
50 deep
No talk to police
Feds they shoot for me
OMG, I just killed this beat
Put it in disease
In these streets
You ain't in these streets
Boy I'm in these streets, Let's get it!
Apples are good
You can get these bitches boy 2 fo' 4 nigga
You can get it from the window or the door
Try some fu' shit my bro gone blow (for the low)

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Talkin' like you got it boy you will get poked
7 dudes with me who want some
Green Glock, it's on go
Jimmy run up on em', shoot em' in his nose
I'm ridin' with my Tec

This bitch all up on me I want neck
She just want the fame that shit ain't shit
Aye lil' bro let's do a hit

Chop his fuckin' body, put it in a ditch (Let's get it!)
