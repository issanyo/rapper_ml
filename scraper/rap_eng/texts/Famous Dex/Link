[Intro]
Look like I'm tellin' like last year I was confusin', you know what I’m saying
Playing Xbox 360 not the Xbox One
This year ballin' (cha ching)
Doing Maaly Raw beats
Uh woah
Oh man god damn

[Hook]
I had to go set me a trend
Young nigga rockin' them vans
Fuckin' yo bitch in my van
I don’t even do the xans I’m just runnin' to the bands
A young nigga flex alot
I used to be up on the block
Pull in the double R inside
Fuckin' different bitches make my heart stop

[Verse]
A young nigga just like the Beatles
I fuck yo lil bitch, just eat her
I swear to god I delete her
Diamonds on me like I'm Bieber
A big boy house got 5
Runners wit me like I'm servin' Easter
Look at my cup it be Easter
I came from (?)
All my dreads be red
Everybody talkin' down, man I don't give fuck
I had to put Forgies on the Bentley truck
You run up on me I'm shootin' stuff
