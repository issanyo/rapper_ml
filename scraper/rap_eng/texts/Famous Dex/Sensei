[Intro: Artist Noir & Famous Dex]
Oh man God Damn
God Dan-God Damn
Yeah

[Intro: Artist Noir]
Karate Chop (Sattttt)
Sensei I whip up a block
(I do)
I don’t even like selling rocks (no-no)
I'd just like me a drop
Karate Chop (Satttt)
Sensei I whip up a block
I don’t even like selling rocks
I just like me a drop

[Verse 1: Artist Noir]
Drophead looking like Stevie
(what-yeah)
The hairline chopped off
I made the hard out the soft
Butter the seats tuck the toast
Burn rubbers in roasters, rub shoulders with mobsters
If I’m being honest been fucking these models that model designer
No Panda
She like the car but she don’t know the model
She like the gram but she love the grotto
She needs some grands she don’t need a follow
Bottles on bottles on bottles on bottles on bottles her motto

[Hook: Artist Noir]
Karate Chop (Satttt)
Sensei I whip up a block
I don’t even like selling rocks
I'd just like me a drop
Body shots (stop)
If she got good pussy I pop
If you on that bullshit get shot
Sorry we don’t fuck with opps

[Verse 2: Artist Noir]
Sorry don’t fuck with the cops
Show em’ my heckle and koch
I keep it cocked by my cock
Hate when this block get so hot
I should go back to the burbs and cool off in a drop with my pops
I don’t need no ice on the watch. I need thick thighs on a thot
Fuck what you thought black, my roots say I’m God, Jack
No roof on the car, check
Dykes that minage, check
Noir is a Lord, Lord of the war
Lord knows I been poor, pouring up four, going in raw, hoes leaving em sore, hoe leave me alone
Karate chop
The dope make that body rock
Karate chop
Split up a brick in my ad-di-das
No nine to nine
I do not work on clocks
Taliban, my niggas don’t work with Glocks

[Verse 3: Famous Dex]
Body shots
I fuck your bitch get a lot lot lot
I fuck your bitch get a lot of top
You run up on me get a lot of shots
Karate chop (Wait)
I get them bricks then karate chop
I’m sipping on lean yeah that hard Wock
I pour a six then my heart stop
They trying to copy the wave
You already know
I put this dick in yo hoe
My shooters down to kick a door
I got this dope in my sock
I trap on the block
I growed up was selling rocks
Run up on me get karate chopped

[Verse 4: Artist Noir]
Talk that blah blah blah
You’ll get shots shots shots
That’s on God God God
We on top top top
I need top top top
Please don’t stop stop stop
That’s on Jah God God
Get that block and then chop chop chop

[Hook: Artist Noir]
Karate Chop (Satttt)
Sensei I whip up a block
I don’t even like selling rocks
I'd just like me a drop
Body shots (stop)
If she got good pussy I pop
If you on that bullshit get shot
