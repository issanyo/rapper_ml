Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody keep asking me how I get the drip. How I get drip this? How I get drippy that? How I get drip that? How I be fly this? How I be fucking bitches that? They say how I got all the drip? But look

[Hook: Famous Dex]
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
(Drippy, Drippy)
I get the drip from my walk

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
I get the drip from my walk
My baby she come from up north
My money, it come from the vault
I'm smoking on dope like Young Dolph
We touch the plug down for the cough
Im sippin' on lean till I fall
My diamonds they shine, they Rick Ross
I hop in the foreign, get lost
(Oh Man Goddamn)
2 bitches they calling me drippy
I fuck them and then we get drippy
My 30, it shoot, Scottie Pippen
Im sippin' on lean till I'm sleepy
I pop me 2 pills I get geeky
I got a lil bitch her name Kiki
I think that lil bitch Puerto Rican
She chill at my crib for the weekend
3 grams in my Wood like a boss
My diamonds they shine with a floss
My foreign it float like a ghost
I hop in that bitch and get lost
My money is starting to get tall
I walk in the mall buy it all
My drippy it came in the sauce
I get the drip from my walk

[Hook: Famous Dex]
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
(Drippy, Drippy)
I get the drip from my walk

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Run Ricky
Straight neck, I don't do the hickeys
Nigga stupid if he try to stick me
Leave a pussy nigga drippy-drippy
Aw man, fuck it up
All my young niggas they run it up
Can't leave the room till we add it up
Bag it up, I get that drip from my sister
I get that speed from the fisker
Old heads lookin' at Boat like the sinister
Young niggas look at Lil Boat like the minister
Just made a 30 while fucking on Jennifer
Dex and Lil Boat, we go way back
Niggas where fools go A-Track
If I bring you a four I need eight back, drippy-drippy
Boat so young she had to hit up Ricky
Dripping sauce, feel it in your kidneys
Young nigga had a real epiphany
Before a nigga had a mili
And I ball like a player
Got a Benz in my lair
These niggas want me to flip flop
In her throat like a cough drop

[Hook: Famous Dex]
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
I get the drip from my walk
(Oh Man Goddamn)
A bad bitch, live up north
I'm smoking dope till I exhaust
Money coming from the vault
(Drippy, Drippy)
I get the drip from my walk
