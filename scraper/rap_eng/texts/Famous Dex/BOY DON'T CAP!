[Chorus: Comethazine]
Boy, don't cap

[Verse 1: Comethazine]
Boy don't cap
Niggas be cappin' like hats
Shoot a fuckboy in his stomach (boom)
Bullets come out through the back
Bag that I'm rockin, it's BAW$KEE

Big Lambo, got it matte
Big AK, let 'em have it

Only smokin' on the OG
Fuckin' bad hoes only
All gold like a trophy

Fuck around, let the trigger squeeze (boom)
Gang, BAW$KEE
