[Pre-Hook]
These bitches want my money
But she can't get nothing from me
She wanna fuck my homie
She think I'm stupid, but bitch I'm not no dummy

[Hook]
I'm not no dummy, I'm not no dummy
I'm not no dummy, I'm not no dummy
She think I'm stupid, ain't gettin' non' from me
I'm not no dummy, I'm not no dummy

[Verse]
I took his bitch, and didn't say sorry
I flew right past him, I'm in that Rari
I'm rolliing rolling, sumtin' like a Harley
I'm smoking gas, you smoking garbage
I'm off the Xans, I cannot stand
You try some fu shit, my twin go Blam
Oh thats your bitch? I took your bitch
She on my dick, my chico stick
She want some money, ain't give her shit
I'm filthy rich, and love your bitch
This bitch thought I was a dummy
But bitch can't get none of my money
