Aye FatDad what they got them xans for bro?
They got 'em for 10 dollars bro, they got 'em for 10 dollars
For 10 dollars? They got 'em for 10 dollars bro bro
Man that shit too high bro, I got xans for the low
Bars let's get it

[Hook]
I got xans, 2 for 4
You can get them through the backdoor
If you want it, call my phone bro

Aye for the low, aye for the low
Aye for the low, aye for the low
You can get a whole thing

[Verse]
I got xans, yeah I'm that boy
He want footballs but I got bars
He want 2 pills but I got jaws
Dont try that fu shit, my twin will spark
I can't stand, I'm off the xans
I'm off that lean, I cannot dance
No rubber bands, but I got bands
Don't run up on me, my gun will blam
These hoes they on me, they think I'm funny
Can't have my money, you ain't my honey
You lil bitch, a lil duh dummy
You think it funny but ain't shit funny

[Hook]

You can get them through the backdoor

Aye for the low, aye for the low
Aye for the low, aye for the low
You can get a whole thing
Uh 2 for 4, I got xans, for the low
