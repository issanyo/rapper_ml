[Intro]
Ooh, yea
DexterDiego like what
DexterDiego like what (wait)
You know what I'm saying
I got my shit, you know
(Up and away)
(Up and away)
(Up and away)
(Up and away, yeah, what)

[Verse 1 - Famous Dex]
Go up and away
Send my shooter out where you stay
You know I don't play (huh)
Cookies comin' from the bay (It is! huh)
I fuck your bitch that's your bae (what, huh)
Move it and count it, I bless it
I pull out that chopper
You know we don't play
Wait, I count up my legos
Oh shit, go Diego (what)


[Verse 2 - Diego Money]
Stickin' my money like legos
Young Diego don't chase hoes
Young nigga, I'm all about pesos
You niggas wearin' the fake gold
Shoot up your spot, the case closed
Shooters i got them on payroll
Niggas, they know I got bankroll
Might catch me a flight to Barbados

[Verse 3 - Famous Dex]
I just might fly to Barbados
Bitches hot like they nachos
Stop little boy it's nacho
The 30 right at your top though
Then they run to the cape
I bust a nut on her face
Bad bitches regulate
I want the money, you late

[Outro]
I just go up and away
I just go up and away
Ooh, yeah, what, ooh
I just go up and away
The money go up and away
Dexter
I just go up and away
The money go up and away
I just go up and away
I just go up and away
Fuck a bitch up in her face
I get the money you lame
DexterDiego like what
DexterDiego like what
