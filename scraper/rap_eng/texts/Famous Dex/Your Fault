[Intro]
Let's get it!
Cut me up, sis!
I mean all the way up
I don't wanna hear these fuck niggas, man

[Verse]
I wish a nigga would try to try me
I'll run up on his ass, put the 30 in his skin like a I.V
What you thought?
Hell yeah, it's your fault
I'm getting money out the vault
On the rush, getting money like Bush
Pour a four in the Crush, you ain't getting no money
Lil' nigga, you a dummy
Poppin' pills, yeah, I'm scummy
You'll think this shit funny
Put the 30 to his tummy
Wrap his like a mummy, chew him up like some gummis
Spit him out, now he bloody
Feed him back to his mother, I'm a stupid motherfucker
I'm getting money like a trucker
Smokin' Wood, woodpecker, and Sci Fi on the beat
Red bottoms on my feet
I fucked the bitch last week, man, that lil' pussy cheap
Her head good, pussy weak
I put the bitch on the street, now she can't get a thing
I'm ballin' hard, six rings, and I ain't even on the team
Chris stole my Robin jeans
Young nigga got green
I'm poppin' pills like a fiend (Let's get it!)
I'm killin' shit, that's my hobby
I fuck your bitch in the lobby
She love giving sloppy toppy
I kick her out, no karate
Don't tweak when you walk in the party
D.D.B. when I walk in the party
Don't say nothin' to me when I walk in the party
Fat Daddy with me when I walk in the party
.44, yeah, nigga, bitch, get back
I'll spit your ass up like a Kit Kat
Or lil' bro'll smoke his ass like a cigarette
Or put his in the freezer like a six-pack
What's crackin'?
You think you tough, boy, you lackin'
I never leave without that ratchet
You run up on me, I'ma show you what's crackin'

[Outro]
Let's get it!
