[Hook: Famous Dex & Swoosh]
Now I was looking at you while you was looking at me
I know you wanted to come my way
Why you always
Wanna play
Why won't you
Just stay
I've got a
Nice little place
Where we could
Lay up all day

Check my phone I've got all kinda games
I hopped on the jet 'cause I got bored of the planes

[Verse 1: Famous Dex & Swoosh]
(wait)
I got Dexter on the chain
They do it for the fame all these goofy niggas lame
Got tattoos on my face people say that I'm going insane
I was going through the struggle but a nigga overcame
He keep calling you ignoring know I love that
Sound like stirring mac and cheese when I hit it from the back
Had to record it one time for the Snap
She keep asking me to eat it out well I'm not into that
Baby girl you know you is a (?)
Callin my phone with that chit chat (dexter)
Fuck your ex block his number he a non factor
You the bomb imma light you like a fire cracker
