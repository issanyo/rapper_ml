Pull up with that lame shit
I ain't wit that same shit
You can get your name sent
You can get your flesh twitched
You can get yourself ditched
You can get your bitch hit
Come get your whole team bitch
Don't make me make a scene here
Don't make us make a scene there
I swear the air all clear there
On god n' them I don't care
Beware our .30, don't care
I'll put you here, then leave you there
Whole squad be everywhere
Pull up on you derriere
No rest to him, was all a blur

[Verse 1: Xavier]
Was this his chick? I give no shit, I got this bitch here with us
And we holdin' dat' hoe ransom, he said okay how much
Million pounds of the gas or you won't hear shit from her
I give no fucks 'bout none of you niggas I caught 'em crying for what
He caught her cheatin thru her uber, he in her recent trips
Tryna see where da fuck she was at at 4 am droppin 'nem
I ain't phased by none of you haters treat you like ugly shrimp
I turn my key, car go hadouken, like ryo and lil ken
I prolly still dish it even if we was kin
I cum again, & make her cum again, & then cum again
I hit it so good she left me ice cream in da fridge
Left some cream on her lips
I Smash and smoke then i dip, pussy

Pull up drop top me and wood
Flexin' on your bitch
Got them racks stacked up like some books

Heard he talkin' shit, pull up on him now that nigga shook
Got them shooters at your neck

Young Diego run through checks
Ice diamonds 'round my neck

Pass her to my nigga Dex
Smoking strong, gas pack
Got me higher than a jet
