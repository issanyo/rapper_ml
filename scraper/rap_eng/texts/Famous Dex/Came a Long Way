Ah-yeah ah-what

[Hook]
Sit back you riding that Bentley (Skrt)
You boyfriend pockets so empty (It is)
I used to ride in that hammy (You-what)
Now I pull up in Givenchy (Dexter)

I pop a pill and get real higher
Diamonds not real you lair (You lair)
Bitches they biting like a spider (what)
The money you got, you can't buy her (Dexter)
