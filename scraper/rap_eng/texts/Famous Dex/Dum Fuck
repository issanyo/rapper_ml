[Intro: Famous Dex & Lite Fortunato]
I pay the bitch, then she fucking suck me
Smoking dope, yea that shit is musty
Baby girl you so ugly
Baby girl, yea that shit is musty
Baby girl you so ugly
Baby girl you so dusty
Woah!
Green Nato, no secondary
Young genius, so legendary
Val Venis might just fuck my bestie
I pop a perc just to recollect me....
Nato, Dexter. Dexter, Nato
Aye Dex, what up brodie?
You got a nigga in Cali now, you dig?
I'm bout to go surfing and shit

[Verse 1: Lite Fortunato]
Home boy what is the issue?
Must be official
I got to get a new whistle
Break the packs right through the bristle
Raining no drizzle
You cannot hang with my peripheral (yea!)
Came along way from them tissues (uh Dexter!)
Crying, them issues
Now they all bang with them pistols

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Uh look
I ain't come right for no drama
I got my llama
I will whack your baby mama
Put that shit right on my mama
If you want karma, blowing shit up like Osama

[Verse 3: Lite Fortunato]
I need me a comma
Presidential like my name is Obama
Busting that bitch fit, now she feel trauma
I can get you spin like DJ Drama
Oh, woah
Green Nato, no secondary
Young genius, so legendary
Val Venis might just fuck my bestie
I pop a perc just to recollect me
Kicking bitches like I'm Lionel Messi
Cause she acting like she never necked me
Make your mama get grown an sexy
Better charge her to fucking sex me

[Verse 4: Famous Dex]
Paid a bitch then she fucking suck me
Smoking dope yea that shit is musty
Baby girl you so ugly
Baby girl you so dusty
If you ain't talking shit, suck my dick
Kick her out if she ain't talking money
Riding round with a stick, full clip
I'll put it to your tummy
Oh wait
I'll put it to your tummy!

[Outro: Lite Fortunato]
Aye, we going crazy motherfucker
Weird versus Crazy nigga
Dexter, Dexter, Dexter!
Nato, Nato, Nato!
Yah Dig!
That way nigga!
