Hop in the back of the back
Run up on him and I swear he a lack (swear he a what?)
Smokin' dope like it's crack
Sippin' that lean, man I can't feel my back (yeah)
Don't want that Rollie, you wearin' is whack (is what?)

Lookin' at me so I took her, wait (hold on)

Seven lil' bitches, they right on my dick (yeah)
Ooh, feed 'em coke, now they lick (you what?)
Get 'em off pills, they hearin' shit
Stack up that money, no pyramid (what?)

Lurk through the dark (Dexter), you think I'm a demon (yeah, what, Dexter)

Gettin' money, money maker (what? Yeah)
Hop in my Lamb' and I'm skatin' (what?)
Ballin' so hard like I play for the Lakers (yeah)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa & Famous Dex]
Movies what I'm makin', new jacuzzi's what I bathe in
Jewelry, all it's paid for, new whip fully automated
Born a hater, chances are you that won't die the same
Make a couple million, I suggest you buy some change
Major cake is what I make, that's why they envy me
I make the plays that win the game, so I'm the MVP
Smokin' chemistry, they ain't who they pretend to be
Strictly business, ain't no feelings in this industry
Smokin' on some KK I just grew myself
Never send someone for shit I wouldn't do myself
Used to trip on all my niggas when the weed's gone
Now I ain't stressin' 'cause I got my own weed farm (a-yeah, a-what?)

[Chorus: Famous Dex & Wiz Khalifa]
Ooh, huh, yeah, huh (hahaha, what?)
Get your lil' bitch 'fore I take her (get your lil' bitch 'fore I take her, huh)
Ooh, huh, yeah, huh (a-what?)
Ice on my wrist like a skater (Ice on my wrist like a skater, ooh)
I can not fuck with these haters (I can not fuck with these haters, huh)
Gettin' money, money maker (what? Yeah)
Hop in my Lamb' and I'm skatin' (what?)
Ballin' so hard like I play for the Lakers (yeah)
Ooh, huh, yeah, huh (a-Dexter)
Get your lil' bitch 'fore I take her (get your lil' bitch 'fore I take her, huh)
Ooh, huh, yeah, huh (a-what?)
Ice on my wrist like a skater (Ice on my wrist like a what?)
I can not fuck with these haters (I can not fuck with these haters)
Gettin' money, money maker (gettin' money, money maker)
Hop in my Lamb' and I'm skatin' (what?)
Ballin' so hard like I play for the Lakers (yeah, Dexter)
