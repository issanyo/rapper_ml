[Hook]
We run in your house
Got guns with the beam, uh
My niggas thirsty
I swear they some demons
I swear they some demons, I swear they some demons
I swear they some demons, I swear they some demons
We run in your house
I swear that we mean it
My niggas thirsty
I swear they some demons
I swear they some demons, I swear they some demons
I swear they some demons, I swear they some demons
