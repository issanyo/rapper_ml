[Intro: DDG]
Tre on the beat, yuh
I put the racks in the mattress
I put the Rollie in safe
I bought a Beamer to race
I shoulda bought me a Wraith
These niggas be broke, so they hate
Appointment for money, I'll never be late
All night I been thumbin' through cake
Di-diamonds splash, put my neck in a lake

[Chorus: DDG]
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce, ayy
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce, ayy

[Verse 1: DDG]
Pockets be lettuce like green
Blue hunnids, stuffed it all in my jeans
Take one like we shootin' a scene
Rich boy and I'm only a teen
I can never go broke
Cali weather, I can't fuck with no coat
Call yo bitch, tell her I'm tryna poke
Neck wet and my wrist on soak
I hit with no date
If she make me bored, I'm gon' skate
Penthouse and an i8
For the pussy, I won’t wait
I cannot starve
Ten bands open tab at the bar
Too lit, I can’t hop in the car
Zero speed, dash lookin like par
She fell in love with my bank
Green like weed but my money don’t stink
Hybrid whip with no gas in the tank
I’m gettin money, nigga, fuck what you think

[Chorus: DDG]
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce, ayy
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce, ayy

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I put them racks in the mattress, huh
I tell my bitch she can have it, huh
Matter fact she gotta bag it
Countin' the hunnids and baby, don’t hide it
Huh, ooh, okay, yeah
Flexin, I bought me a Wraith, ooh
Yeah, yeah, a day, ooh
Fuck yo lil bitch everyday, ooh
Wait, bust on her face, ooh
She callin' me Dex everyday, ooh
Yeah, hangin' with DDG
The money, I keep it on me
Wait, huh, bankroll is all in my teeth
Ooh, money is all in my teeth
Hah, diamonds is all in my teeth
Look at my watch, I got an AP, a what
Yeah, ooh, huh, fuck yo lil bitch on the way
Huh, I got my Glock on my waist
Huh, sippin that wop to the face, yeah

[Chorus: DDG]
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce, ayy
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce, ayy

[Verse 3: DDG]
Chase statement, hunnid bands
Bust Rollie, got more rocks than the sand
Why these hoes keep on actin', they playin'
Stop boostin', bitch you know I’m the man
I do not care for these hoes
Bust a nut and it land on her nose
Kick her out, let her put on her clothes
Slut walk, nigga, that’s Amber Rose
I made a hunnid in 30, but I need a hunnid a day
Young nigga steady pavin' the way
Big money, I’m increasin' my pay
This one girl said I’m ugly
I just thought the shit was funny
Bet bread that she fucked me
When she see me get money
My life real, no effects
Direct deposit, I can’t fuck with no checks
She not fuckin' so I boot her in text
This Beamer mine, I do not have to flex

[Chorus: DDG]
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce, ayy
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce
Pockets be lookin' like lettuce, ayy

[Outro: DDG & Famous Dex]
Pockets be lookin like lettuce
Pockets be lookin like lettuce
Ayy (Yeah, a what, Dexter)
