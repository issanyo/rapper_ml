[Verse 1]
Fuck on that bitch for some money, this ain't yo honey
I'm a neighborhood junkie, dick in her mouth like a donkey
I don't want money, bitch I'm coming for your tummy
Woah!
Dexter, Dexter, Dexter, Dexter
They keep sending me these letters
Wait, I don't really give a fuck
I'm balling like the fucking Bucks
Wait, eyes rolling back like The Undertaker
Fuck your lil bitch, I'm the mask maker
Middle finger to the world, yes I will fuck your girl
All on my dick like a skirl, I fuck your bitch, you make her pearl
Oh shit they can't find me, Yeezys on, he should sign me
Remember sittin' right in detention, I ain't have bitches
Now I'm whippin' in the kitchen, ballin' so hard, no permission
32 Griffin, run up on me shootin' Pippen
You a lil boy, boy you lame as fuck
You a lil broke boy, you lame as fuck
Yeah I'm balling like the Bucks, you run up on me shootin' stuff

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm so high off a molly, all in my jolly
Fucking bitches on the trolley, all these tats on my body
Wait, hold on!
Bitch I'm so high off a molly, all in my jolly
Fucking bitches on the trolley
Yeah, Dexter!
Bitch I'm so high off a molly, all in my jolly
Fucking bitches on the trolley, all these tats on my body
Geekin' off molly, turning up in the lobby
Yeah!
Water, water, water, water
Get your bitch 'fore I spoil her
I will never do her wrong, and she be twerking to my songs
I ride with my fam like the Brady Bunch, stop all that hate get some Hater Punch
Yeah a nigga on his grind, two rings and they shine
I can't fuck with them, they on other stuff
Wait, Fat Daddy wrap 'em up
Then we throw him in the trash, a young nigga got his bag
