[Intro]
Hold on wait wait

[Hook] (x18)
How could you do it like that?
How could you do it like that?
How could you do it like that?

[Verse 1]
How could you do it like that?
I'm smokin on woods like that
I get the drip from my walk
Irv say do it like that
Flash don't do 'em like that
He make the news like that
He in the sewer like that feed the nigga to some rats
I swear to god I go Ape I spend some bands on BAPE
This lil bitch up on me want date
Baby girl beat ya feet I pop some pills now I'm geek
I pour a six now I'm sleep
How could you do it like that?
I spend some bands on a Jeep

[Hook] (x18)
How could you do it like that?
How could you do it like that?
How could you do it like that?
How could you do it like that?
How could you do it like that?
