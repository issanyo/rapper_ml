[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
(Maxo, Maxo, Maxo)
Sip, hide TEC by the coffin
Sip, hide TEC, no coffin
Walk hard, got a nigga nauseous
No, who you go, this bullshit
Hole in ya' head like a dolphin
316, no Austin (what?)
Neck like a stone cold stunner
Bullet proof my Hummer
Tools like Bob the Builder
Keep 3 Ks, ain't Hitler
[?] fly through with the curve
Throw a nigga back like a jersey
Clue, drop out, like a dumb kid
MJ shoot'n with the 450
I keep my desert eagle
It's bigger than Bautista
These rap niggas scared
They play dare, 'fore they play with us
Mixin' up the walk
In the red, with a yellow tux
Call me Maxo Waka Flocka
AK Baby Choppa'
I pull-up to your casa
And send shots to your mama

[Chorus: Rocket Da Goon]
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
You know it'll cost ya, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Yellow tape, flatline
Chocolate mouth, white line
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
You know it'll cost ya, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Yellow tape, flatline
Chocolate mouth, white line

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Better be cautious, nigga
My [?] ain't often, nigga
Talkin' 'bout white line
I got that bitch, she a dime
I get that head, she spread
Don't want that bitch
Well she ain't marryin'
I used to walk on with wine
8p, for the time
Clueing with rocky
You know he's my brother
I cannot hang with you suckers
30 on me
Oh, I'll bust ya'
I'mma still [?]
I like to run to the bag
I got a lil' bitch
I swear I can't trust her
[?] if you fuck her
Swear to god, you a sucka'

[Chorus: Rocket Da Goon]
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
You know it'll cost ya, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Yellow tape, flatline
Chocolate mouth, white line
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
You know it'll cost ya, nigga
Better be cautious, nigga
Yellow tape, flatline
Chocolate mouth, white line
