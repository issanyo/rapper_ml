[Verse 1: Nick Jordan]
One time for the money
Two for the shows
Three salty exes standing the front row
Four for the motherfuckin dreamers out there
Always plotting out and hustling and dreaming out there yeah
And thanks to my real friends
They sticking with me,  ride or die until it all ends
They dedicated this for all of them
The days get shorter
The nights get longer
We ain't sleeping
She outta her mind
I think I lost mine
No Rhyme or Reason

[Hook: Nick Jordan]
Where is my head?
I don't know I must have lost mind
Where is my head?
Cause I keep losing track of time
Where is my head?
I don't know I must have lost mind
Where is my head?
Cause I keep losing track of time

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Dexter, yeah
One time for the money
Two for the hoes
Jose got the lean, let me pour up a four
I'm doing drugs and I'm doing what I wanna do
I got a bad bitch and she comfortable
I see the haters over there and they watchin'
I must got the girl thats why they keep blocking
But who give a damn? Not me
You run up on me? I got my stick on me

I popped two pills to the face, what's going on?
I popped three more, shared with a bitch, then I took her home

[Hook: Nick Jordan]
Where is my head?
I don't know I must have lost mind
Where is my head?
Cause I keep losing track of time
Where is my head?
I don't know I must have lost mind
Where is my head?
Cause I keep losing track of time
