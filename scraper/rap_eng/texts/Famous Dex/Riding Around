Riding around in my city
Gold on like I'm Diddy
All these bitches call me drippy

If she ain't fucking get to stepping
I ain't really trying to kick it
I'm smoking dope it's delicious
All these bitches yeah they missing

[Verse]
I'm riding round in my city, gold on like I'm Diddy
I'm smoking dope it's delicious, all these bitches wanna kick it
Margiela boy how I kick it, I'm riding round in a Bentley
Yeah I got me foreign car, Man you know it ain't rented
I just scored on a 8, all these bitches wanna date
Baby girl pump yo brakes, I'm doing good eating steak
I see a opp everyday, but he know we don't play
Cause he know I got that 30 on me, Flash get him out the way
All these bitches call me drippy, five bitches yeah I'm pimping
Six bitches yeah I'm pimping, I call Irv then we flip it
I'm smoking dope it's delicious, I'm riding around in this Bentley
Gold chain like I'm Diddy
