[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Tell her pop out to da pull up
This year like pull up
And I ball, Chauncey Billups
Big shots, you can't hit us
Tell her pull up to the function
My niggas smokin' that strong shit
My niggas juggin' them onions
My niggas shoot no discussion
Real front niggas will drum ya
When its drama time you can't be runnin'
I went down so I had to start juggin'
Hittin' licks till I make it
Ain't go down for the shit I was doin'
No face, no cake shit
So I only went far as the [?]
I thank god everyday
But thats enough about me
Thinkin' that she my new favorite
Shawty anything but basic
Girl you ain't stupid, but that cake is
Put Burberry on my main shit
Burberry be a fragrance
Burberry around my waist
Bitches know they can't replace it
We done run in basement
We done run on the stages
Now shawty wanna a conversation
Told her I don't do no dating
But my shawty flexing like pull-ups
Baby pop out to da pull up
Pour you a cup of that good stuff
The Hennessy give me good love

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I gotchu Jay, ah Dexter
I might just pull on shawty (I do!)
I might just hop out the 'Rari
Tell that lil bitch I want Mari
All of my niggas stay into the story
I might just pull on shawty
Rich Forever be the story
All these rappers stupid boring
You copy the way, don't get hit with the 30
Wait, Ya, me and Jay get all the money (ooh)
Fuck your lil bitch, I swear she a dummy
I put my dick up in her tummy
I put my dick up in her tummy
I get all the money, I get all the money
Dexter!
