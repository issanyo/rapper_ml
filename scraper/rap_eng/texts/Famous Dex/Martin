[Verse 1: Camjae]
I stay with Gina like a Martin
But I don't sweat her like I'm callin'
Nigga shootin' I need Jays like a Morris
I don't bend for nothing not even a pardon
I ain't gotta will her movin' she a scooter
Bitchin' to her friend I passed her hallelujah
I ain't lyin' Simba [?] and I'm a buddha
As we leave my club I ask it "what's it to ya?"
She givin like a gangster email I sent it to the crib
Futurama I'm a Bender
Oh shit motherfucker how's ya mom

Hold on nigga little like Kim
Talking bangers out your [?] like some Tims
Keep the cannon on me caught me in my [?]
City on my back I carry call me Jim
Run, run [?] boolin' at the south park like I'm Timmy
Go get in [?] 'fore I'm out for the lease keep the peace like a hippy
Bitches they on me I promise they won't get a thing

She will not get a ring
Swag

Famous Dex up in the party
She want to ride me like a Harley
Whole time she a Barbie

Put three grams of my wood
Run up on me wish you would
Flash put 'em in the mud
My niggers marching like the bud
Fuck a deal bitch I'm good
