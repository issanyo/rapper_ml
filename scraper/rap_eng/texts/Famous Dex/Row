[Hook: Lil Breeze]
I woke up this morning and capped it up
I grabbed me an O then I rolled my bowl
Benjamin told me to stack it up
And never ever go back to broke
My style and my flow so immaculate
They hiding the shit so I gotta hunt
Ain't never had shit so I gotta stunt
I cap it up then I just roll my bowl

[Verse 1: Lil Breeze]
I came a long way from the trenches
Dodging cops and hopping fences
Had to learn to pay attention
That I'm the center of attention
To get myself up out them trenches
And ball all four seasons
These niggas hate for no reason
I think these niggas policing
I cap it up then I roll roll
She up and down like a pogo
Trip on a thot, that's a no no
Diamonds in the rock, that's the logo
When we show up it's a movie scene
I grab me a whore then I do my thing
Hundred band, hundred band in my jeans
I'm rollin' so high that I broke my spleen
She say she love the way I cap it up
I say I love the way she back it up
Benji hit me up the other day
And told me lil nigga stack it up
She say she love the way I cap it up
I say I love the way she back it up
Benji hit me up the other day
And told me lil nigga stack it up

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Ain't never had shit so I had to stunt
I'm smoking on 'woods, man you smoking blunts
I be cooling with Lil Boat
I'm fucking bitches on a boat
15 hundred for the coat
I don't know these niggas, man they make me broke
But me and Breezy smoking dope
We high as hell, watch us float
Disrespect me, call Trel
He wrap your ass like a rope
I woke up this morning and fucked it up
I spent some bands at the store
DDB never broke
Rich Forever never broke
Me and Breezy in a Masi
Hell yeah, watch us go
