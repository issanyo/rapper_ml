[Intro]
Cut me up, sis!
I mean, I used to tell my mom, like:
"Ay, mom, I ain't never seen it coming
One day, I'ma get you outta here!"
Now look at me now
Let's get it

[Verse]
I swear to God, man, I ain't never seen it coming
Now these bitches on my dick 'cause a nigga tryna get a little money
Baby girl, you funny
Poppin' pills, yeah, I'm scummy
Sean got the trap jumping, like some bunnies
We was tryna get some money
Baby girl, I ain't no dummy
Everybody know me, I used to live down the street
I ain't never had a thing, used to wear bogus jeans
I was tryna chase my dreams, I ain't never had a thing
Used to kill 'em on the scene
Mixin' Xan with the lean, now I'm feelin' like a fiend
I was tryna get green
Stackin' money, Yao Ming
I'm stackin' money, Yao Ming
Remember when I ain't have shit?
Now I'm lookin' at 'em like: "Fuck nigga, I made it!"
And if a nigga playing with my chips, I'ma run up on him then I hit him with the laser
30 on me, so they think a nigga crazy
All these bitches on me, wanna have my baby
Where was you when I was going through the matrix?
Where was you when I was going through the matrix?

[Hook]
I ain't never seen it coming, man, I never seen it coming
I swear, I never seen it coming, man, I never seen it coming
Man, I never seen it coming
Lil' me, tryna get a little money
Ridin' foreign, yeah, a young nigga stuntin'
Ridin' foreign, yeah, a young nigga stuntin'
Ridin' foreign, yeah, a young nigga stuntin'

[Outro]
I swear to God, boy
On Folks 'nem, I ain't never this coming, bruh
I be tweetin' all my friends, like:
"Ay, Folks 'nem, my time coming, bruh"
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it!
