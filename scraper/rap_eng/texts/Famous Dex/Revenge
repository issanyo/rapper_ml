[Intro]
Bando shit
Got extendo with a Glock
Shooter with a mop
Bitches sucking on my cock, yeah, bitch
What? Yeah, Dexter!
Huh, yeah, what
Run up on me, you get shot, yeah
Got me a Glock with extendo and a mop, bitch
Run up on me, you get shot (know what I'm saying)
Yeah, ooh, hah, yeah

[Hook]
Got a beam on my Glock
And I got a chopper, yeah, I keep extra shots
This boy a goofy, man, I know he a flop
You ain't never had nothing, you weren't trapping on the block

[Post-Hook]
Ooh, yeah, Dexter, I was trapping on the block
I was running from the cops
Putting dope in my socks
I got a bad bitch, she like doing cock (she do)
But baby got to stop
Or run into a knot, ooh, huh, ooh, huh

[Verse]
Hold up
Diamonds shining, froze up
Make your bitch hold up
Now that bitch stuck up, ooh
Stuck with me, now she smoking all my weed
Had to kick her out, "Baby, please", baby wanna eat, ooh
I can't go, huh
Yeah, you a hoe
Sniffing on the coke, put it up her nose, what
Yeah, trap, trap, trap, ooh, huh
I don't even rap, rap, rap, wait, yeah
I'm in from the slums with the bums
And I keep the 50 'cause niggas think I'm dumb
Run up on me, shoot your ass down for fun, yeah
Shoot you down for fun, yeah, what
Gun, yeah, bitch

[Hook]
Got a beam on my Glock
And I got a chopper, yeah, I keep extra shots
This boy a goofy, man, I know he a flop
You ain't never had nothing, you weren't trapping on the block

[Post-Hook]
Ooh, yeah, Dexter, I was trapping on the block
I was running from the cops
Putting dope in my socks
I got a bad bitch, she like doing cock
But baby got to stop
Or run into a knot, ooh, huh, ooh, huh

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, run into a knot
What, boom, bad bitch, she on my cock, ooh

Getting all this money, swear to God it never stop
Ooh, yeah, bad, bad

Frames all on the shades
Fuck your bitch, I swear to God I pull her braids
Huh, Dexter
