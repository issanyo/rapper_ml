[Verse]
Bitch I came back from the grave, follow my ways
Whipping bitches like a slave
Paid in full, I am so paid, used to jump gates
Now I'm geeking on the stage
Now don't look at me, I'm not human
My 30 on me, I'll do it
You run up on me, I'll shoot ya
I'll put you right up in the sewer
Me and Big E on the beat
Yeezy right all on my feet
Diamonds they dancing on me
Please don't bark up this tree
Fat daddy shooting for me, wait
Fat daddy shooting for us, yeah
Used to ride on the bus, yeah
Now a nigga getting bucks, yeah
Run up on me try your luck
Wait, hold on, I'm fucking your bitch and she go home
She sucking my dick, that's your back bone
Aye Big E, I don't think they heard me, yah, I say...
Wait, hold on, I'm fucking your bitch and she gone
She sucking my dick, that's your back bone
Ah-Yeah, oh man god damn
I pull up in a Porsche
All these bitches dorks, I just want to pour
Pour me up some more
Pour me up a six, now I'm on the floor
Oh wait, these niggas they fake and they hatin'
I sip on that lean like a patient
My diamonds white like a racist
Oh wait, yeah
Naw, for real
Naw, I say
Diamonds biting, biting, biting, huh
Diamonds biting, biting, biting, yah
Diamonds biting like Mike Tyson right now
This what the fuck going on, man
Ah-Dexter, oh man god damn
