(Verse 1: Derrick Milano)
If you my dog, you my dog
But I can't fuck with snakes
Woke up this morning, a beautiful day
All of my bitches on fleek and they slay
If it ain't bout the money then fuck out my face
All, All of my hoes know I'm cocky as shit
She left lipstick on the top of my dick
It ain't no secret I'm fucking yo bitch
While you blowing her phone up she sucking my dick

(Verse 2: Famous Dex)
All of niggas gone get to the cake
Most of my bitches be stupid and gay
Minnie chop a nigga, call me a stake
Put the fucking red beam on your face
I was 13 on my first jugg
I put 3 grams on a backwood
Run up on me, wish you would
Uh yea, I got it out the mud

(Verse 3: Derrick Milano)
She said, "Ooo, ooo Derrick give me some more"
Yea I'm addicted to dicking down whores
My dick is priceless can't cop it in stores
Only my bitch, and her bitch can afford
All of these hoes I should get an award
Now we in foreigns and whipping the [?]
Don't hit my phone, you'll get quick, click ignored
This shit a hit without using a chorus

(Verse 4: Famous Dex)
Oh my God, I just bought me a new Porsche
Sipping on lean yea I feel like a dork
Fucking your bitch yea I need an award
Catch me an op, then I swear that I'm scoring
A nigga getting money, I don't give a damn
I'm blocking bad bitches off of instagram
Uh, yea I treat it like a spam
Run up on me then I blam

(Verse 5: Derrick Milano)
I'm super hot like I'm fresh out the oven
Super bad bitches they call me McLovin'
If she ain't gone fuck me the other one's coming
If I see that bag Imma run to the money
Now that I'm hot people look at me funny
All of a sudden them groupie hoes want me
I got the juice, Imma go like the bunny
So if that hoe fucks me I guess that she lucky

(Verse 6: Famous Dex)
I got the juice so the bitch wanna fuck me
Hop on my dick her shit hop like a bunny
Abracadabra my diamonds be sunny
But I don't give a fuck, yea I run to the money
A nigga balling hard like Curry
I got you little bitch on one knee
Her pussy wet like the sea
My diamonds hurting surgery

(Verse 7: Derrick Milano)
I know the bitch is a fan and she know it
Dick in her mouth, Imma tell her to blow it
Hand full of knives what me run it and throw it
Now that I'm hot I guess everyone notice
Boy, Boy them foamposites you got on is bogus
You don't got all of that money you posting
All of that instagram flexing is dope
But we only gone look at you ass like a joke

(Verse 8: Famous Dex)
You ain't got none of that money you posted
Run in your house and I swear I'll poke her
Makeup my face, bitch I feel like the joker
My 30 on me bitch, I feel like a toaster
A 40 on me shooting boomerang
I be getting money more than anything
You better stay up in your lane
