[Hook: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
I'm in the back of that Maybach
Me and your bitch, we go way back
Ain't doing no flexing, this straight facts
Me and Young Dexter blow more racks (hold on Rich)
You run up on me, push your shit back
Count up the money, need more stacks
Wait, I do the drugs and I'm healing
Diamonds on me cost a building

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
AP got her skating
Run to the money, we racing
She a freak, swallow children
New foreign cost a building
Don't trap where you stay, man they come in your building
Bad bitch look a million
She wanna suck on my children
All of this money I'm feeling
Dug in the pussy and make her feel it
Fuck nigga thought I wouldn't make a milly

Sucking dick, I just met her
You run up on me, you get way up
Diamonds my neck, you think I got hiccups, yeah

Sipping that syrup, pull up her skirt
Put this money in her purse

Balmains so tight I'ma Jerk

You got your Rollie off eBay
Finessing your bitch, have a threeway
Hop in that Lamb, have a speed race
Yeah, Rich Forever on the map
Run up on me, blow your back
