I'm all about a bag, I don't brag
I walk up in the mall don't check a tag
I'm a DDB boy and I just swag
I walk up in the mall don't check a tag
I just swag
Baby watch me swag
I walk up in the mall watch me swag
I just swag
Baby I just swag
I'm DDB boy I'm bout a bag

[Verse]
I walk up in the mall don't check a tag (I ain't gotta brag)
I'm DDB boy I check a bag
Smoke ten woods and flex in Jags
I pulled off boy watch my bad
All these bitches staring why they mad?
Baby girl I know you want a bag
If I catch a opp you know I call Flash
Won't hesitate to get up on your ass
I just swag up on my Hoovo with my Hoover
Your boyfriend he's a loser he's a loser
Lil baby you so stupid you so stupid
You try me you so foolish you so foolish
But I been running to the money all the time
You ain't never seen a nigga double dab
I'm a young fly nigga on my grind
And all these bitches on my dick since hoes mad

[Hook]
I'm all about a bag, I don't brag
I walk up in the mall don't check a tag
I'm a DDB boy and I just swag
I walk up in the mall don't check a tag
I just swag
Baby watch me swag
I walk up in the mall watch me swag
I just swag
Baby I just swag
I'm DDB boy I'm bout a bag
