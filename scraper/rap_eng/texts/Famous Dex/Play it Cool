[Verse 1: Flexx Lugar]
Ay, babe my guns from Russia
Fucking yo bitch she love it
Come to my crib for comfort
Taking a trip out the country
Flying her way out to Sicily
Buying her Gucci in Italy
Bitch too tight it's not fitting me
I don't know what you been dealing with
I never been out to France, Balmain the pants, dope in the pants
I am not holding your hand
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta uh
I gotta run up the bands
Watch for the feds in the van
I think they know who I am

[Chorus: Flexx Lugar] x2
I'ma play it cool, you know what I do
I'ma break the rules, that ain't nothing new
I'ma count these bands, Ima come through there
I'ma ice my hand, that ain't nothing new

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
(what) I run through the money need more (ooh)
Baby girl love me everytime how she fuck me
My baby girl you know she a whore (she is)
I ran through the money I'm countin the bands (ooh)
The pint you know I just scored (I did)
AP 80K (it's what?)
I fucked your bitch ya you late
Wait, bustin up right on her face (Dexter)
Bobbin nigga beat the case (the what?)
Getting money every day (huh), sippin lean to the face
I get the money I swear it's no break (Dexter)
Pullin Lambo flex (go flex), Diamonds right up on my neck
Hold up, I get that lil pussy wet
I got that money I bought me a jet

[Chorus: Flexx Lugar] x2
I'ma play it cool, you know what I do
I'ma break the rules, that ain't nothing new
I'ma count these bands, Ima come through there
I'ma ice my hand, that ain't nothing new

[Verse 3: Flexx Lugar]
You cannot hang in this area
Even though I was just fucking your girl
You could go head and go marry her
We do not stay at the Marriot
Trappin in Saudi Arabia
Diamonds they lookin so crazy, ya
I don't know what I'ma say to ya
You should just stay out my radius
I just went whippin' the bowl, flipping them 0s, fucking them hoes
I got some blood on my clothes
[?] that shot me a foe
I just be pourin a four
Then I be poppin a xan
While I be poppin my bands, damn

[Chorus: Flexx Lugar] x2
I'ma play it cool, you know what I do
I'ma break the rules, that ain't nothing new
I'ma count these bands, Ima come through there
I'ma ice my hand, that ain't nothing new
