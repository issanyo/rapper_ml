[Intro]
Only hang around bosses (skrr skrr), I ain't got time for that drama (I do what)
Yeah, Dexter, what, huh
Had to gun 'em down, had to gun 'em down (what, yeah)
Know what I'm sayin' (you ain't got no money)
My real name is Dexter (ooh, Dexter)
Haha, Dexter (ooh, huh)

[Chorus]
All that hating, need to stop it (it do)
You ain't got no money, just look up in your wallet (look up in your wallet, yeah)
Running to the bands, yeah I got it, never count it
Only hang around bosses, I ain't got time for that drama (I do what)
All that hating, need to stop it (stop)
You ain't got no money, just look up in your wallet (your wallet)
Running to the bands, yeah I got it, never count it (skrr skrr)
Only hang around bosses (know what I'm sayin'), I ain't got time for that drama (ooh, huh)

[Verse]
I ain't got time for that drama (I don't)
Running to the bands, you just look up at these commas
Try to rob me, I swear to God I got llama (bow, bow)
Doing hits up at the [?], then I go to the Bahamas (skrr skrr skrr skrr)
Ooh, huh, I don't want your ass, lil mama (lil mama)
Huh, ooh, ain't got time for that, lil mama (lil mama)
Ooh, huh, on my back 'cause she a llama
Baby bad back had to hit her with a comma (Dexter)
I don't want that bitch, I told her go
Baby sniff the coke, yeah she sniff it up her nose
Had to pour four, now all my feelings go (what)
If you talkin' to the feds, I swear to God, I'll cut your throat (yeah, Dexter)

[Chorus]
All that hating, need to stop it (it do)
You ain't got no money, just look up in your wallet (look up in your wallet, yeah)
Running to the bands (skrr skrr), yeah I got it, never count it
Only hang around bosses, I ain't got time for that drama (I do what)
All that hating, need to stop it (stop)
You ain't got no money, just look up in your wallet (your wallet)
Running to the bands (skrr skrr), yeah I got it, never count it
Only hang around bosses (Dexter), I ain't got time for that drama (ooh, huh)
