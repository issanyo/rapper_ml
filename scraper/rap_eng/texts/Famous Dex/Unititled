[Verse 2: NBA Youngboy]
VVSs on my chain
4 the pointers on my ring
I pulled up with the gang
And we hop out with that thang
You know that we play with them Ks
Lil nigga, don't get in my way
Fuck around and get shot in your face
If you try to stop me from gettin' paid
Tell him run up on me, boy, I dare him
All this money got these bitches starin'
Niggas hate and I ain't carin'
Try to rob me, I'ma slay him
I tell ‘em everything sell
I know that they hate, I prevail
Pussy I'd never fail
I'm still screamin' fuck 12 (yeah)
Yeah, I know you smell the smell
Me and Dex takin' over the year
They ain't want us on XXL
But we still runnin' 'round, causin' hell
NBA all over the gear
Rich Forever, nigga, that's what it is
You ain't with it, nigga, you'll go tell
Whole lotta money, nigga, flexin' for real

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
All this money, I might hide it in the bank
