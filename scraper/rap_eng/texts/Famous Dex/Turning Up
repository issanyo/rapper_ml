[Bridge]
All these bad hoes want to do me
They treat me like a film, they see a movie
But these bitches know I’m DDB
If she ain’t sucking dick, bitch you can beat your feet

[Hook]
Bitch I been turning up, bitch I been turning up
You got some dope roll it up, you got some dope smoke it up
You got some pills pop it up, you got some drink pour it up
They got me turning up, yeah we be turning up

[Post-Hook]
Bitch I been turning up, bitch I been turning up
Bitch I been turning up
Bitch yeah we turning up, bitch yeah we turning up
Bitch yeah we turning up
Bitch I been turning up, yeah I been turning up
Bitch I been turning up
You got some pills pop it up, you got some drink pour it up
You got some dope roll it up

[Bridge]
All these bad hoes want to do me
They treat me like a film, they see a movie
But these bitches know I’m DDB
If she ain’t sucking dick, bitch you can beat your feet

[Verse 1]
You know I’m 10-0 [?], got to keep it on me
I can’t trust a fool nigga, not my homies
Chasing money like a rat, I need some blue cheese
And yes I got no Mike’s, these ain’t no Gucci’s
You been chasing that lil bitch for some coochie
I been fucked that bitch, her name Lucy
I kicked her out, swear to god she was a goofy
All I know is money, man I need a [?]

[Bridge]
All these bad hoes want to do me

[Hook]
Bitch I been turning up, bitch I been turning up
You got some dope roll it up, you got some dope smoke it up
You got some pills pop it up, you got some drink pour it up

[Verse 2]
Everybody doing drugs, we ain’t no Christians
I got two bitches, man they kissing
You know I had to get ‘em off the liquor
They try some fool shit, swear to god my bro dismiss ‘em
I’m smoking fruity dope, loud as a whistle
I’m popping all these pills, man a nigga tripping
Who the fuck this dude, I think he tripping
That 40 hit his back, now they yelling Ricky
A fifty on that forty like a biscuit
If you a school boy I’ll knock you out your Dickie’s
But I been turning up, I’m drunk as fuck
I need more weed, please pass me a blunt

[Bridge]
All these bad hoes want to do me

Bitch I been turning up, bitch I been turning up
You got some dope roll it up, you got some dope smoke it up
You got some pills pop it up, you got some drink pour it up
