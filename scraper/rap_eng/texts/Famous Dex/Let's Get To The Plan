[Verse]
I'm off two xans, yeah I'm the man
Finessing the plug, I need me some bands
Oh that is your bitch, I think she a fan
I gave her my number, she all on my van
I call my twin, she got her a friend
Now we had a party, we needed me some xans
I wanna fuck, but she wanted to dance
Stop all that bitching shit, let's get to the plan
Let's get to the plan, let's get to the plan
Let's get to the plan, let's get to the plan
I ain't with all that simple shit, let's get to the plan
Let's get to the plan, let's get to the plan
Let's get to the plan, let's get to the plan
Let's get to the plan, let's get to the plan
I ain't with all that simple shit, let's get to the plan
Let's get to the plan, let's get to the plan
Let's get to the plan, let's get to the plan
