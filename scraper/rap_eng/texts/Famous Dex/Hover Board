[Hook]
I been counting money on my Hoover (board)
I just fucked this bitch, hallelujah
I know these boys so fake, I see straight through ya
But I been getting money on my Hoover (board)
I’m on my Hoover, I’m on my Hoover (board)
I be flexing on my Hoover, I’m on my Hoover
I’m on my Hoover, I’m on my Hoover (board)
I just fucked his main bitch, and that’s on my Hoover

[Verse]
I just fucked his main bitch, hallelujah
I know this boy some food, I see straight through ya
You try to rob me, boy shot will do ya
You put that thirty to his top, meet his medula
I be flexin’ all day on my Hoover (board)
I can fuck your main bitch on my Hoover
Your boyfriend a lame, he’s a fucking loser
I’m riding on a Hoover, he be riding on a scooter
I be smoking woods, shit that’s every day
They say calm down lil bro, you need a break
Who the fuck is you? You talking to the jakes
And I can’t trust a soul ‘cause everybody fake
But I been counting money on my Hoover (board)
Bitch I been counting money on that Hoover
Official counting money on that Hoover
If that’s your bitch I fucked that bitch, hallelujah

[Hook]
I been counting money on my Hoover (board)
I just fucked this bitch, hallelujah
I know these boys so fake, I see straight through ya
But I been getting money on my Hoover (board)
I’m on my Hoover, I’m on my Hoover (board)
I be flexing on my Hoover, I’m on my Hoover
I’m on my Hoover, I’m on my Hoover (board)
I just fucked his main bitch, and that’s on my Hoover
