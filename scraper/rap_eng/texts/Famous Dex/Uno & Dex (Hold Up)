[Hook: UnoTheActivist & Famous Dex]
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Broke niggas make me sick I throw up
Rich nigga, I'ma beat the bowl up
Choppa hit him make a nigga fold over
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, diamonds my bitch
Half a million, put that shit on my wrist
30 on me and you know I don't miss
Run up on me, turn that boy into piss
Hol' up, hol' up had to get off my ass
Broke nigga, I was thinking bout cash
Life fast had to move in slow-mo
Why these niggas try to take my mojo?
40 on me boy you know I'm no hoe
Big dick put it right in her throat
[?] why I got off the flow
My diamonds invisible but I need hope

[Verse:  UnoTheActivist & Famous Dex]
And I get it out the mud, and you know that I be sippin' on mud
40 hit him I ain't showin' no love
I show that lil' bitch a dove, she suck my dick in the tub
You know I show her no love, kickin' her out man I don't want no hugs
Hol' on, drip, I don't got swag I drip
You know I move like a pimp
40 hit him and it makin' him flip
Run up on him he a shrimp, big 30 on my hip
Draco make him limp, I call up Rozay cause you know I don't flip
Draco hit a fake hoe, now the case closed so I dip
Bankrolls lookin' thick, left and it came back with a grip
Pesos make fake hoes do all type of stupid shit
I cannot trust in no bitch, I just might pull out my stick

Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
