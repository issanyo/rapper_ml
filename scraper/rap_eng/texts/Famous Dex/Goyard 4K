[Intro: Diego Money]
I'm ugly
Aye, aye, aye, aye, yeah

[Verse 1: Diego Money]
Young Diego Money, I can show you what the pack do
Yam with the flex, I can show you what the straps do
Runnin' through a check, I can show you what the cash do
Shawty give me brain, suck me up like a vacuum
Got what you want, I don't know you, I'ma tax you
One phone call, call my shooters, they'll clap you
Smokin' gas pack, got me stuck like a statue
Rockstar life, doin' shit that you can't do
Nigga play with me, light him up like a candle
Gucci on my shirt and Gucci on my sandals
Countin' up checks, but I don't know Sam, you
Brand new jacket and it's made out of camel
Don't trust me, pussy nigga, I'll scam you
Don't trust bitches, 'cause these hoes, they'll trap you
Young rich nigga, show my ass like a baboon
Got a bad bitch look like she came from Cancun
Black and white coupe, same colour as Shamu
Hit 'em with the stick, I ain't talkin' 'bout Bamboo
Diamonds shinin' bright, all white like shampoo
Wanna be Ice, you ain't Ice 'til I stamp you
Diamonds on my wrist, all yellow like Pikachu
You ain't talkin' money, pussy nigga, can't speak with you

[Hook: Diego Money]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goyard cost $4K, aye
Diamonds in your face, yeah
Pulled up in the Wraith, yeah
Aye, yeah, aye, go
Goyard cost $4K, aye
Diamonds in your face, aye
I just copped the Wraith, aye, yeah, aye
