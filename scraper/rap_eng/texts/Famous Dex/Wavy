[Intro - Famous Dex]
Dexter, Dexter
You know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1 - Famous Dex]
I got a bitch named Sanny
Lick me like candy
She join with her panties
Other bitch named Fanny
She like to ball in Miami
Baby, I get all the money
I'm looking so good you think it's a Grammy
Thirty on me never handy
Used to my cup like Trill Sammy

Look at my diamonds they dancing then
Then my bitch looking so fancy
Know that I'm balling like Randy
Run through that money I know they can't stand me
I know you can see that we wavy
Sippin' on lean got me lazy
Can't fuck with these niggas, they shady
You loving that bitch and I'm fucking your lady
Balling so hard feel like Tracy McGrady
Pull up and hop out the blacked out Mercedes
Came up from nothing, I had to go take it
Smoking that gas, I feel like a Jamaican

[Bridge - Famous Dex]
Flexin' so hard they can't take me
My diamonds white like a racist
Sippin' on lean like a patient
I know your bitch wanna date me
Diamonds on me cost eighty
Stick to yo bitch like Lil Tracy

[Hook - Diego Money]
Now that you see that we wavy (x8)

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Now that you see we wavy
You copying the wave get hit with the eighty
Bad bitch that my baby
I know you heard I was crazy
Sippin' that Wock
Sippin' that Wock, go right to the top
Used to have to dope in my sock
I used to trap on the block

[Verse 3 - Diego Money]
The hop on the run like a cruise ship
Pockets they fit with them blue strips
My whip it look like a spaceship
My diamonds are white like Cool Whip
I put the racks in the safe
Stealin' my swag how that taste
Driving the whip like a race
You wish you can get with the wave

[Bridge - Famous Dex]
Flexin' so hard they can't take me
My diamonds white like a racist
Sippin' on lean like a patient
I know your bitch want a daily
Diamonds on me cost eighty
Stick to yo bitch like Lil Tracy

[Hook - Diego Money]
Now that you see that we wavy (x8)

[Outro: Famous Dex]
Copping the wave with the 80
Copping the wave with the 80
Bad bitches that my baby
Dexter
Dexter Diego like what
Dexter Diego like what
