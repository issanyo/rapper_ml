[Intro]
Nah for real
You see where I’m from
Now you see why the world against me
Where we gon’ stop, how we gon’ stop
Nah for real
My Energy

[Hook]
Two bitches they into me
I thinking they feeling me
They gone off my energy
My swag they took all my energy
My energy, my energy
I’m pumpin’ my energy
I take all my energy
Two bitches I swear they kissing me
My energy, my energy
I’m turnt off my energy
I’m pumpin’ my energy
I swear they feelin’ my energy
My energy, My energy
Two bitches they kissing me
I thinking they feeling me
They go in the club and take all my energy

[Verse]
Two bitches they into me
I thinking they feeling me
My swag, my geek
I know they digging me
I walk in the party
I sipping on lean, not no Hennessy
They bitches want wedding rings
I’m married so much so it ain’t a thing
I swear your boyfriend a dork
I’m ballin’ in and out the court
And getting money is a hobby
I fuck your bitch in the lobby
I swear I do it
Don’t make me get foolish
And 50 bands on the clippage
I’m riding around acting stupid
I took bitch, man you stupid
Aha you looking stupid

[Hook]
Two bitches they into me
I thinking they feeling me
They gone off my energy
My swag they took all my energy
My energy, my energy
I’m pumpin’ my energy
I take all my energy
Two bitches I swear they kissing me
My energy, my energy
I’m talking bout energy
I’m pumpin’ my energy
I swear they feelin’ my energy
My energy, My energy
Two bitches they kissing me
I thinking they feeling me
They go in the club and take all my energy
