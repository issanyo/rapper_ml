[Hook]
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody

[Verse 1]
We sippin' lean, do all the drugs
She for me and I'm not for her
We all off molly, so she know what's up
And less talking girl I'm down to fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean never call D
I'm down to make a movie
And tattoos all on my body

[Hook]
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody

[Verse 2]
We bussin' hard so its round two
It's getting late what you wanna do
She want some money but that shit is foo
You just a bitch girl your not my boo
I don't need no wifey
I'm lookin to fuck me a barbie
To smoke dope and do mollys
And I ain't gone tell nobody

[Hook]
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
We sippin' lean, doing molly
We ain't bothering, nobody
