[Intro: Rich The Kid]
New level, ya dig
Elevation way, the money way
(TheLabCook)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
New six, broke wrist
I put the racks in the mattress
Niggas fake, let 'em have it
Pull out the chopper and do magic
She want a purse
She want a Birkin
Fuck her, she squirting
Countin' racks in the back of suburban
Rich Forever get the cheddar
Two bitches, got 'em kissing together
Thick bitch, let it drip on the leather
She wanna fuck with a boss
Maserati, we was chopping it off
Switcharoo, fuck her, passing her off
Now I'm rich but I took a loss
Bought that bitch Gucci, Birkin, and Off

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Ice on my neck like new skates
She wanna fuck, now it's too late
Pull up on you like Tomb Raider
Balenciagas, got a new flavor
Fifteen, I was ballin', Vince Carter
Hood Fave, money blue like the water
Young boy, in the hood I'm the man
KD, I ran off with them bands
Gotta ride 'round with a fan
Niggas plottin', keep two Glocks
New year, getting new guap
She all on my dick sayin', "boo stop"
Put double G's on her belt
Swim in your bitch, Michael Phelps
Rich Forever gettin' more bands
I just pull up in a foreign, damn

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Check Up
I put that bitch on a stretcher
Scraping the bowl for the extras
Pockets they stuffed with the extras
We got the paper like too many lectures
I'm the professor
Rich Forever gettin' more bands
I just pulled up in a foreign
Check Up
I put that bitch on a stretcher
Scraping the bowl for the extras
Pockets they stuffed with the extras
We got the paper like too many lectures
I'm the professor
Rich Forever gettin' more bands
I just pulled up in a foreign

[Verse 3: Famous Dex]
Ice on my grill, it's a new smile
She wanna fuck on your boo, wow
I'm getting money, yeah it's blue now
Rich Forever be my crew now
Last year I was broke as a joke
Jugging niggas, yeah I used to sell soap
Bad bitch, yeah I watch her do coke
I want the money, I swear I need more
I dropped the racks in the booger
Lookin' at me so I took her
The thirty on me, don't get shook up
I look at my plaques and I'm good up
Wait, I got the money on me
Eighty-thousand AP
Off the flex, I don't do no xans
Fifty-thousand for a show in Japan

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
