[Intro]
My diamonds are shining and your girlfriend will find me
(oh man got damn!)
I think they are blinding

[Hook]
I think I'm lost in the sea (x4)
I pop a pill now I'm geeked
I been rollin' for a week
These bitches text me man I'm sleep
I think I'm lost in the sea (x5)
I pop a flat now I'm geeked
I been rollin' for a week
These bitches text me man I'm sleep
I think I'm lost in the sea (x2)

[Verse]
Gold thangs on my teeth
These bitches text me man I'm sleep
I been rollin' for a week
But I got up out the jam 30 on me bet I blam
Bitch all up on me, want a pic thank you ma'am
I just went off on this beat
I bought me a jet not a jeep
These bitches they see me they speak
Baby girl wanna freak but I got nun but bands
Baby girl where ya man took off to Japan

[Hook]
I think I'm lost in the sea (x4)
I pop a pill now I'm geeked
I been rollin' for a week
These bitches text me man I'm sleep
I think I'm lost in the sea (x4)
I pop a flat now I'm geeked
I been rollin' for a week
These bitches text me man I'm sleep
I think I'm lost in the sea (x2)
