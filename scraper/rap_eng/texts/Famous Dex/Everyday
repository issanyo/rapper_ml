[Hook: Ayoo Kd]
Everyday I flex like its nothing
Counting all these bands money coming
I made it from the bottom into something
This man bitch all on me cause I'm stunting
Everyday I flex like its nothing
Counting all these bands money coming
I made it from the bottom into something
This man bitch all on me cause I'm stunting

[Verse 1: Ayoo Kd]
Everyday I flex I know you like that
Got top the first day so I can't wife that
Choose my girls wisely I don't like that
Speaker knockerz flow yeah I know you like that
In the field this is real this is Chiraq
Riding round stunting cause I got a pack
Smoking on that loud yeah that stinky pack
Cop a bankroll, watch how she react
Spend a whole rack watch me get it back
Her ex man man now he want her back
Took her from her lane cause he ain't on jack
And she addicted to me like she on crack

[Hook: Ayoo Kd]
Everyday I flex like its nothing
Counting all these bands money coming
I made it from the bottom into something
This man bitch all on me cause I'm stunting
Everyday I flex like its nothing
Counting all these bands money coming
I made it from the bottom into something
This man bitch all on me cause I'm stunting

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Everywhere I go hoes adore me
They see my tattos its like a  story
I don't want your bitch man she boring
She keep calling my phone well I'm ignoring
Bands on me but bitch you knew that
I'm flyer than a bitch now where my jackpot
I can't trust a thot see I'm getting racks
Bandz a make her dance but I won't give her that

[Hook: Ayoo Kd]
Everyday I flex like its nothing
Counting all these bands money coming

This man bitch all on me cause I'm stunting
Everyday I flex like its nothing
Counting all these bands money coming
I made it from the bottom into something
This man bitch all on me cause I'm stunting
