[Hook: Warhol.SS]
Pimp shit
Bring that shit up need a new brick
Fit got a cuff and a new wrist
Niggas ain’t shit tryna act slick
Got your hoe on deck pop this shit
White teeth blowing on good gas
Cash in cash out do that shit fast
Big fifty round blast at your bitch ass
Bitch
Big stand don’t pop clips
Kickstand blowing on jit
Load up the clip
50 round hide in the zipper
Told your lil hoe nigga get up
Nobody fucking your bitch up
I’m that boy you can’t get rid of

[Verse 1:Famous Dex]
Ooh wait
I’m the one who you get rid of
30 shot right in my pillow
Huh run up on him you get hit up
Pop me a perc and I lose it
Fuck a lil bitch in jacuzzi
Feeling on coochie
Baby girl give me the booty
Like we is shooting a movie
Hollup wait
Warhol meets and we shoot
Diamonds colored like some fruit
That bitch she high like some soup
Bitch I’m an animal ain’t in the zoo
Diamonds they all in my teeth
That boy don’t want no beef
Eat him up like some meat
That boy he laying [?] in the street
Dexter

[Verse 2: Diego Money]
Money I keep me a bag
Hit him up with a laser
Fuck that bitch can’t save her
I’m a young money chaser
Pull out the choppa turn that boy to an angel
Fucking your bitch to her I am no stranger
Sipping on lean ain’t no need for a chaser
Hop in the Masi like I am a racer
Young nigga ballin’ like I am a Pacer
Pull up on you with the sig
Aim it at your fucking wig
Check out a lifestyle that a young nigga live
Chain on my neck cost the same as your crib
Smoking on gas I ain’t smoking no mid
Fuck 12 I can’t fuck with no pig
Call me pops cause these niggas my kids
Getting money since I was a jit
