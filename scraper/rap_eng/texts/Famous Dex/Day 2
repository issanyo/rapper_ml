[Intro]
Know they laugh
Know what I'm sayin'?
Like, like, this year
I-I'm really doin' what the fuck I wanna do
2017, wave bro's shit (huh)
Dexter, ooh (what)

[Chorus]
AP
I drip them racks in a  booger (I drip them racks in a  booger)
Lookin' at me so I took her
I'm in LA smokin' cookie (yeah)
Balmain's, they right on my ass (what)
I was broke, know they laugh (they did)
.30 on me get 'em passed
I was so broke had to get me a bag (yeah)

[Verse]
AP (huh, what)
Look at my diamonds, they dance (look at my diamonds, they dance)
I had to run to the bands
Up in New York, yeah, I'm coolin' with Gram (what)
I send a shot yo' mans (I did)
50 shots, yeah, they ran (what)
Wait, I dropped my pants
I be so high but I don't do the Xans
Money so long like a sleeve
I got yo' bitch on her knees
AP, 80 G
Don't want the Rollie, man, it is so make believe
Bitch, I be flexin' like Hercules (you what?)
Yeah, and you do that
Pillowtalk on a jet (what, what)
I got that lil pussy wet (Dexter)

[Chorus]
AP (AP)
I drip them racks in a  booger (I drip them racks in a  booger)
Lookin' at me so I took her (what)
I'm in LA smokin' cookie (I am)
Balmain's, they right on my ass
I was broke, know they laugh (they did)
.30 on me get 'em passed
I was so broke had to get me a bag (what, ooh)

[Outro]
80K, right on my wrist (huh)
