[Chorus]
I just pulled up in a Range with your bitch, yeah
Gimme brain, some wind on that thing, real quick, yeah
Switchin' lanes, can't fuck with these lanes
There's some goofies here, yeah
Blow your head, yeah, blow your brains, what?
I'm just looking good, Gucci on my wallet, ha
Honey in my pocket, ballin' hard is a hobby
Pull up on me, fuck a Glock, I got a shorty, ooo
Catch a body, I might just kill somebody, wait

[Verse 1]
Busting off a pill, name is [?]
Fucking on this bitch, she just want me jealous
And she do what I tell her
Baby girl, just let her
I tell that bitch 'don't let her'
Throw one door to the face, wait
I can't feel my face
I'm popping the [?]
I need me a break
And these niggas really fake
And these niggas really snakes
I might just pull out my cake
And I'll shoot this bitch up, I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
I just pulled up in a Range with your bitch, yeah
Gimme brain, some wind on that thing, real quick, yeah
Switchin' lanes, can't fuck with these lanes
There's some goofies here, yeah
Blow your head, yeah, blow your brains, what?
I'm just looking good, Gucci on my wallet, ha
Honey in my pocket, ballin' hard is a hobby
Pull up on me, fuck a Glock, I got a shorty, ooo
Catch a body, I might just kill somebody, wait
And I might catch a body
And I might catch a body

I just pulled up in a Range with your bitch, yeah
Gimme brain, some wind on that thing, real quick, yeah
Switchin' lanes, can't fuck with these lanes
There's some goofies here, yeah
Blow your head, yeah, blow your brains, what?
I'm just looking good, Gucci on my wallet, ha
Honey in my pocket, ballin' hard is a hobby, ooo
Pull up on me, fuck a Glock, I got a shorty, ooo
Catch a body, I might just kill somebody, wait
