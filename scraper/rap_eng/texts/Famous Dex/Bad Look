[Hook: Famous Dex]
Close a nigga like a mac book
Run up on him now he shook
Talking to the feds he a crook
And I pop five pills man that's a Bad look
Close a nigga like a mac book
Run up on him now he shook
Talking to the feds he a crook
And I pop five pills man that's a Bad look

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
I just popped five pills
I'm rolling like a ferris wheel
I don't need a damn deal
Getting all this blue cheese
Boy that's my damn meal
Getting money that's my hobby
I fuck ya bitch in the lobby
Yea i give her ricky bobby
Then i kick ya bitch out
Now she texting me sorry
Close a nigga like a mac book
Talking to the feds he a crook
Getting money all the damn [?]
Had to call up flash
Run up on him it's a Bad look

[Hook: Famous Dex]
Close a nigga like a mac book
Run up on him now he shook
Talking to the feds he a crook
And I pop five pills man that's a Bad look
Close a nigga like a mac book
Run up on him now he shook
Talking to the feds he a crook
And I pop five pills man that's a Bad look

[Verse 2: BBNB Arod]
Got the mac like a laptop
Ten pounds at the stash spot
Fuck your bitch gave her back shots
Smash a thot till she can't walk
Five xans and i can't talk
Man these rats got the trap hot
Get dumb in the man's [?]
Masked up like a mascot
This is BBNB sipping lean
Fire pack of that gasoline
Hit the trap back
And sell the P's
And i keep a bad bitch on me

And I pop five pills man that's a Bad look
