[ Intro ]
I got you lil' bro
( Your diamonds ain't real, put the chain up )
16 I told you, you got one
Uh what, yeah, wait

[ Hook: Famous Dex ]
Your diamonds ain't real put the chain up
Can't fuck with fake niggas man they change up
Bad bitch watch me change her
And she finna brain yea that bitch is brainless
Your diamonds ain't real put the chain up
Can't fuck with fake niggas man they change up
Bad bitch watch me change her
And she finna brain yea that bitch is brainless

[ Verse: Famous Dex ]
I don't want you baby girl you a slut
16 on the beat so you know we turning up
Got this dirty sprite right up in my cup
30 bound my gut
Pussy nigga try your luck
I want asap benz in New York
All these niggas
Man these niggas really dorks
Balling out, eating up the court
Gucci on [?]
Want money, I need more
I don't want you baby girl you's a whore
Sipping on this coke but she know's she wants some more
16 on the beat
Vans on my feet
I got diamonds on my teeth

[ Hook: Famous Dex ]

Your diamonds ain't real put the chain up
