[Verse 1: Asian Doll]
Gang in this bitch, Asian bitch trending
I'm spilling these bitches, got brain for a six
I need blue hundreds and fifties
The youngin i'm spilling these bitches I came from the bricks
Been getting this money I'm flexing they calling me female, I did it my doll from Cuba
My pussy it drip, he gave me some brain, with lean on his lips
He fuck for a zip, finessing no stressing my barbie impressing
Just bought a new Tesla bitch!
