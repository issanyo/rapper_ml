[Verse]
I'm hot like some lava, these bitches they suck me they give me saliva
I'm all about commas, they say you a gangsta, bitch you ask my father
R.I.P to my mother, I can't trust a soul but I love my brothers
Shoot like Danny Glover, pull up on a opp, do hits out the hummer
Why you jealous? You go get you some money
My trap jump like bunnies, these bitches they on me, they just want my money
They can't get a thing, 'cause I'm balling like Kobe
I shoot like Gin√≥bili, ain't taking no trust but a pya if you owe me
My head high, like I'm feeling a nose bleed
I pull up on forgies, I'm laughing the money, I feel like The Cosby's
My cup is so muddy, 2 bitches they with me, I don't care if they buddies
I think they want money, I look at them bitches like girl I'm no dummy
I'm DDB, yeah I love my brothers
Can't hang around suckers, can't trust all these niggas they switch up like colors
I'm flexing like bumba, I know that you're jealous boy you don't know nothing
So quit all the stunting, if I up on my shanty I get the thumping

[Outro]
