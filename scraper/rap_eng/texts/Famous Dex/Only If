[Chorus: Pachino & Famous Dex]
Studio, the studio, we break night (we do)
Fuck a one stop, I took a straight flight (nyoom)
Straight to LA, I got my cake right (yeah)
Bad lil bitch, she got her shape right (yeah, what)
Only want the top, baby, you can't spend the night (can't what)
Give her a couple bands only if that pussy right (Dexter)
If she actin' dumb, put that bitch up on a flight (huh)
Tell her, "baby, bye," (what) tell her, "get a life" (what)
Studio, the studio, we break night (stack, stack, stack, stack)
Fuck a one stop, I took a straight flight (one stop)
Straight to LA, I got my cake right (yeah)
Bad lil bitch, she got her shape right (yeah, what)
Only want the top, baby, you can't spend the night (can't spend the night)
Give her a couple bands only if that pussy right (that pussy right)
If she actin' dumb, put that bitch up on a flight (huh, Dexter)
Tell her, "baby, bye," (what) tell her, "get a life" (yeah)

[Verse: Pachino & Famous Dex]
I'm from NY, uh, so we Milly Rock (yeah)

Talkin' M.I.A. in the Bentley drop (skrr)
Ooh, huh, right with four bitches doin' the dash, fuck the cops (skrr skrr)

Ooh, huh, wanna fuck me for my neck (for my what)
Smokin' dope, ain't stressin', want some money, you can't get it (you can't get it)
Wait, your boyfriend is a wannabe (what)
Got them diamonds on my teeth, he ain't on to me (he ain't on to me, Dexter)

[Chorus: Pachino & Famous Dex]
Studio, the studio, we break night (we do)
Fuck a one stop, I took a straight flight (nyoom)
Straight to LA, I got my cake right (I landed)
Bad lil bitch, she got her shape right (yeah, what)
Only want the top (ooh), baby, you can't spend the night (ooh, what)
