[Verse]
I call my twin FatDaddy
You know he blowin' shit down for me, my brodie
What I'mma do without my twin g, my brodie
These hoes on me they stingy, get off me

Make the wrong move they upping 30, that's on me
Canâ€™t keep no fufu nigga around me
One phone call I swear they down for me

I'm gone leave yo ass six feet deep, that's on me
