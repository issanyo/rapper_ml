Shit, huh, who made this beat? Denzel?
Huh, D on the beat, okay
Okay, I really like this beat, know what I'm sayin’?

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Baby in this bitch lit
Whole lot of money, rich forever
Like I went and signed a deal with Rich
Only stop the Lamb at a red light
And made the top do a trick
I ain't goin' back and forth with him
If he send a diss, he get hit
They let me out with my 30
Your watch only costed a 30
Don't wear ‘em again, don't care if they dirty
Play with me, we do ‘em dirty
I'm from Atlanta, where we play with birdies
Move a lil different, I'm makin ‘em nervous
They just tryna figure which one I'm workin'
Take me a sip then I throw back the Perky

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Cool with your bitch smokin' sherbert (I am)
Lil baby, you makin' me nervous, uh (lil baby, you makin' me nervous)
Go to your hood, yeah, I'm purgin', huh (ooh)

Huh, wait, walk in the mall and I spent 50 Gs (what)
Bankrolls all up on me (what)

All these niggas wannabes (yeah, Dexter)
Cool with your bitch smokin' sherbert (I am)
Lil baby, you makin' me nervous, uh (lil baby, you makin' me nervous)
Go to your hood, yeah, I'm purgin', huh (ooh)
Hop in the Lamb, yeah, I'm swervin' (skrt, skrt)

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Your bitch wanna take a lick
When I pull up, she like “Hold up”
That's that boy Jay Critch
I ain't wastin' time, I been on my grind
Like a nigga doin' skate tricks
And that nigga shine, if you cross the line
Then the bullets fly, Matrix
She makin' me nervous
Hopped in my bag and I hopped in my Birkin
All of this money, I'm flexin' on purpose
I know they hatin', but that shit ain't workin'
Hit a stain like detergent
I'ma go get me that Bentley and swerve it
Cut her off, now that bitch steady lurkin'
I cut ‘em off ‘cause these bitches ain't worth it

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Cool with your bitch smokin' sherbert (I am)
Lil baby, you makin' me nervous, uh (lil baby, you makin' me nervous)

[Verse 3: Famous Dex]
Hop in the Lamb, you know that I'm swervin'
Go to your hood, yeah, I'm purgin'
Mask on my face, can't be nervous
I'm never lackin' or lurkin'
Wait, walk in the mall and I spent 50 Gs
I fell in love with the cheese (I did)
I got your bitch on her knees
Boy, you a wanna be
AP, it shine in the light
Ooh, I mix Ciroc with the ice
I got two bitches, they bi
Feed 'em Percs, now they high
But that bitch makin' me nervous
Ballin' hard, Julius Erving
I came a long way from servin'
Smokin' on dope, mix that cookie with sherbert, Dexter

[Verse 4: Rich The Kid]
Yeah, what, I drop 50 on a charm
Bought that bitch a whole salon
New freezer on my arm
Fuck a bitch 'cause we ballin'
Niggas, they love to hate
He be a fan of Jakes
Killin' rappers, on a rampage
My diamonds cut you, get a Band-Aid
Yeah, we gotta hear you niggas
Pull out the brand new Bentley
Dexter, he met Dex
I throw you the lighter, we lit
Diamonds bright like a pit
Pint, we pour up the 6
Gucci on my dick
Flexin' 'cause I'm rich

Cool with your bitch smokin' sherbert (I am)
