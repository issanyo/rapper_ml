[Intro]
I do not fuck with nobody
I brought my gun in the party
So you pro'ly gettin' shot in the party
Pull up, flexin' in that what-cha-ma-call-it
If we got problem, my niggas solve it
Say you got it, but we know you ain't got it
Say you 'bout it, but we know you ain't 'bout it
Pray to god, keep the fake from around me

[Chorus]
'Cause them niggas never was with me
I got aim shoot, long range
And I pro'ly catch me a body
People talk like they really know me
But I do not fuck with nobody
I finessed him out of all his racks
Somebody tell him that I'm sorry
I was juggin' since a youngin'
Them niggas never was with me
I got aim shoot, long range
And I pro'ly catch me a body
People talk like they really know me
But I do not fuck with nobody
I finessed him out of all his racks
Somebody tell him that I'm sorry
I was juggin' since a youngin'

[Verse 1]
I was juggin' since a youngin'
Turned nothing into something
Niggas laughed, that was back then
Now I got it, they be asking
How you get it, I don't know
I done did shit that you don't know
I done been places you can't go
Got bad hoes and I need love
Like LL with the Kangol
Got a shooter shoot when I say so
'Cause I'm walkin' 'round with a bankroll
If you run up on me, that's case closed
Ain't playin' round, better get low
Have them young niggas at your front door
Ain't playin' round, I need pesos
Got the .40 on me, I let go

[Chorus]
'Cause them niggas never was with me
I got aim shoot, long range
And I pro'ly catch me a body
People talk like they really know me
But I do not fuck with nobody
I finessed him out of all his racks
Somebody tell him that I'm sorry
I was juggin' since a youngin'
Them niggas never was with me
I got aim shoot, long range
And I pro'ly catch me a body
People talk like they really know me
But I do not fuck with nobody
I finessed him out of all his racks
Somebody tell him that I'm sorry
I was juggin' since a youngin'

[Verse 2]
I was juggin' since a youngin'
Pussy nigga, you don't want it
Doing shit that you don't like
Smoking gas, all these damn lights
Baby girl, give me one night
It's some better things I can show you
Let you ride around in that new coupe
I can push a button, now it's no roof
I don't trust niggas, 'cause they' phony
I be ridin' 'round with it on me
He don't act right, shoot his snapback
I can fuck it up and get it right back
Niggas mad, oh, did I do that?
Try'na get it, but I'm watching my back
Niggas hatin', I can never do that
Counting up, try'na get to them racks

[Chorus]
'Cause them niggas never was with me
I got aim shoot, long range
And I pro'ly catch me a body
People talk like they really know me
But I do not fuck with nobody
I finessed him out of all his racks
Somebody tell him that I'm sorry
I was juggin' since a youngin'
Them niggas never was with me
I got aim shoot, long range
And I pro'ly catch me a body
People talk like they really know me
But I do not fuck with nobody
I finessed him out of all his racks
Somebody tell him that I'm sorry
I was juggin' since a youngin'
