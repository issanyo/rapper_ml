[Hook: Rich The Kid] (x2)
I got too many rings it's a championship
I'm in Hollywood boy, I'm finna' break a bitch
Cut a hunnid' bands on a bad day
I could put you in the game like 2K
Most of you niggas ain't loyal
I bought her new Louis she spoiled
Then another 150 for the lawyer
Had to get out mud the money like oil

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Most of these niggas ain't loyal
My diamonds on me that's spoiled
And 5k for the grill
Your shit it's looking like foil
And lil' bro just scored on the drank
Oh God, made me faint
I almost broke it I can't think
And now I run up in the bank
I roll it like a Ferris wheel
Oh shit, I'm geeking off the pills
You run up on me, you get killed
And you ain't really in the field
And Rich Forever on the map
You run up on me, blow you back
I'm smoking dope I relax
I'm popping pills I can't relax

[Hook: Rich The Kid] (x2)
I got too many rings it's a championship
I'm in Hollywood boy, I'm finna' break a bitch
Cut a hunnid' bands on a bad day
I could put you in the game like 2K
Most of you niggas ain't loyal
I bought her new Louis she spoiled
Then another 150 for the lawyer
Had to get out mud the money like oil

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Rich Forever got out the mud
Why you hating on me got a grudge
Money too old got spoiled
150 for the case, two lawyers
Told my nigga Dex we Rich forever
Now he [?] bigger diamonds on the bezel
He done bought a new coupe, new level
Same bitch choosing me to do it better
Now I'm balling in the game like it's basketball
Nothing big pop a pill like it's Adderall
All of my niggas one hunnnid'
I came in this bitch for the money
Fuck you ho, no love
I might kill em' with the gloves
I got a check just to fuck it up
Louboutins, murder scene, tape it up

[Hook: Rich The Kid] (x2)
I got too many rings it's a championship
I'm in Hollywood boy, I'm finna' break a bitch
Cut a hunnid' bands on a bad day
I could put you in the game like 2K
Most of you niggas ain't loyal
I bought her new Louis she spoiled
Then another 150 for the lawyer
Had to get out mud the money like oil
