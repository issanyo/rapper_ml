[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Sci Fi on the beat
Turn me up sis
Yeah, away, yeah

[Hook]
Yeah, (why) Adidas on me like I'm DMC
Yeah, (why) your bitch wanna hang with me
She wanna smoke dank with me
She wanna bust jugs and ride in the Range with me
Yeah, why, but bitch so glad to see
I run to the money
That bitch is so dumb, that bitch actin' scummy
And what is so funny?
I'm juugin' so hard she think it was funny
My Rolex cost 40
These bitches so dizzy she thought it was seventy
Now check this out honey
I get to the money, I get to the money

[Verse]
I'm catchin' plays like a quarterback
Had to run me up a sack
I was broke but now I'm back
You run up on me? Blow your back
And shoutout to my broski Mac
I ain't talkin' fast, rollin' off a flat
I wanna leave but they at
Yellow bitch is where it's at
All this Bape like a fuckin' monkey
I fuck your bitch, she a fuckin' junkie
I put the dick up in her tummy
And now these bitches lookin' scummy
Your man, he fuckin' bummy
You ain't talkin' shit you ain't talkin' money
I be runnin' to the hundreds
I swear to God they blue hundreds

[Hook]
Yeah, why, Adidas on me like I'm DMC
Yeah, why, your bitch wanna hang with me
She wanna smoke dank with me
She wanna bust juugs and ride in the Range with me
Yeah, why, but bitch so glad to see
I run to the money
That bitch is so dumb, that bitch actin' scummy
And what is so funny?
I'm juugin' so hard she think it was funny
My Rolex cost 40
These bitches so dizzy she thought it was seventy
Now check this out honey
I get to the money, I get to the money
