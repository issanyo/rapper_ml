[Intro: Famous Dex]
Know what I'm saying
This is Chicago shit, know what I'm saying
We came from nothing to something, know what I'm saying
Went from Inglewood to Hollywood, you know what the fuck we doing, yadigg
Kick back, step, woo
Huh, huh, uh Dexter, huh

[Dex]
Wait, sit back never relax
Shooters on me, big mix match
My 30 on me, got the kick back
Run up on 'em, get your shit snatched

[Lucki]
Okay like, blue dream, white lies
