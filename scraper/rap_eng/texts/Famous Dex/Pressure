[Intro: Famous Dex]
(What, I really, I like this beat)
(I just really, I love this beat)
Uh woah

Oh man god damn

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
I'm whippin' that bitch like I'm spanky
I'm in New York like a Yankee
All of my bitches they hate me
Most of my bitches they date me
I put them diamonds on my pinky
I put them diamonds on my chest
You run up on me get the vest
You run up on me get the TEC
Hell yeah, I doesn't respect

[Interlude 1: Famous Dex]

He used to sleep with them hane's tees
Now we pull up in Givenchy
I don't even care what they call me
You could call me a Nato
I'm chillin' with my big bro Dexter
We are some professional flexers
You baby mother, bet I don't text her
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Look at my dresser man look at my clothes
And just look at my handle, I'm ballin' like Paul
And I'm shootin' on him and I'm dunkin' like Georgia State
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Dex from Chicago like Cubs, ah
Dex from Chicago like Sox, ah
I'm from New York, get it, go!

[Interlude 2: Lite Fortunato]

We in different brackets, y'all niggas wanna be ...
Where we speak, we speak from the heart, ya dig?
Uh Dexter, Uh Nato
