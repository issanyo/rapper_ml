[Intro: Lil Yachty and Sean Kingston]
Whoaaa
Whoaaa
Oh yeahhh
Lil boat, Sean Kingston, Famous Dex

[Pre Hook: Sean Kingston and Lil Yachty]
My teacher said "Son, you ain't gon' be shit" (Ain't gonna be shit)
But now I got 40 thousand on my wrist
It's funny, now I'm laughing, life is a bitch (Oh life is a bitch)
Started from the bottom, now I'm on in this shit (I'm all in this shit)
Woah, damn

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
I can't slow down, no
Never slow down, no
I'm on the road now, whoa
I'm on the honor roll now

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
(Yeah)
I be selling out the shows
Puttin' bitches on the road
My 30 on me never fold
I love a count about dough
Me and Kingston in the Masi
Two bitches in the lobby
I know they wanna give us sloppy
Kids come out, baby sorry
DJ Twinz called
Hold a whole pint, so a nigga feeling sloppy
Oh I can't feel my body
A stick on me like it's hockey
But I'm countin' up my bands
Fucking bitches on the gram
I took off to Japan
I could pop four xans, yeah

[Pre Hook: Sean Kingston and Lil Yachty]
My teacher said "Son, you ain't gon' be shit" (Ain't gonna be shit)
But now I got 40 thousand on my wrist
It's funny, now I'm laughing, life is a bitch (Oh life is a bitch)
Started from the bottom, now I'm on in this shit (I'm all in this shit)
Woah, damn

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
I can't slow down, no
Never slow down, no
I'm on the road now, woah
I'm on a honor roll now

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Woah, damn
Life ain't the same
Used to tell them I made music, and they thought it was a game
Now when my shit come on they all sing
To the top of they lungs
I really ran up my funds
I got hoes from the A to Notre Dame
All these bitches tryna fuck me for the fame
I remember people used to talk down on my name
Now a nigga up, they say I'm stuck up
But I don't give a fuck

Woah, damn
