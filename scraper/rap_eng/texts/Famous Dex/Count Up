[Hook] x2
I count up
I count up
I count up
I count up
This money I get it
It's the hustler baby
You know that I'm with it
I count up
I count up
I count up
I count up
You know that I'm spending
Then get back to the money
You know that I'm with it

[Verse 1]
I count up
I count up
I count up
I count up
You know I'm spending
I just bought a Porsche
You know it ain't rented
Wasn't (?) so we get it tinted
Run up on me
You know that I'm with it
Woah
Bad bitches give me throat
I can't fuck her man she's slow
15 hundred for my clothes
All this red in my hair
Diamonds all up in my ear
I'm getting money man everywhere
I'm taking ubers man everywhere
Oh wait
I can't take you on a date
My diamonds real, they ain't fake
I'm running to the money
I swear I'm in a race
I'm getting this money, yeah everyday
Getting this money, yeah everyday
Yeah, I run to the race
I'm getting this money, yeah everyday
Yeah
