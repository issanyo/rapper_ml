[Intro: Famous Dex]
Know what I'm saying, like
I love you, you know what I'm saying?
You're like, like you’re my fucking bro, yo
New wave shit, doin' it
We trendin' this shit
We doin' this shit, you know, man
Rich forever shit, know what I'm sayin'?
Shout out to my motherfuckin' brother Gramz
Ooh, Dexter! Wait, YA!

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Ooh, I'm ballin' in Fendi (you ain't)
I put my bitch in Celine
I get that money, ain't a thing (ooh)
Run up on me, swear to God, get the beam (what?)
Wait, bankroll my jeans
I smoke that dope like a fiend
I get them birds, make them sing
Run up me, swear to God, surgery (what?)
Look at my chain, I got AC (what?)
All these niggas wanna be me
Huh, I get the money, no maybe
Fuckin' that bitch, man, she want have my baby
Wait, people they calling me crazy (you ain't)
Strapped up like the navy (huh)
My new bitch, she calling me shady
Copy the wave, don't get hit with the 80, yeah

[Verse 2: Reggie Mills]
I just cashed out on some Ricky
I can't fuck your hoe, I'm so picky
I just did 12 nights, 6 cities
I just poured lean on her titties
Your bitch just gave me a hickie
On my dickie, dickie, dickie
Play with the money take you out like Ricky
My weed OG cookie be sticky
Shorty she bounce on my dick I say, "Giddie"
I need 4 pints of the tech, I get drippie
Reggie pop LSD tabs like a hippie
Feel like I'm Jimi, beat up the kitty
I fuck that bih from the back call her piggie (yeah)
She my lil miss piggie
Rich Forever Uniiqz Global committee
Diamonds they shine like a star, it's so pretty

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Oou, I'm ballin' in Fendi (you ain't)
I put my bitch in Celine
I get that money, ain't a thing (ooh)
Run up on me, swear to God, get the beam (what?)
Wait, bankroll my jeans
I smoke that dope like a fiend
I get them birds, make them sing
Run up me, swear to God, surgery (what?)
Look at my chain, I got AC (what?)
All these niggas wanna be me
Huh, I get the money, no maybe
Fuckin' that bitch, man, she want have my baby
Wait, people they calling me crazy (you ain't)
Strapped up like the navy (huh)
My new bitch, she calling me shady
Copy the wave, don't get hit with the 80, yeah

[Verse 3: Sfera Ebbasta]
Porto la tua tipa da Fendi
Vuole il mio dolcetto, il mio candy
Sto moltiplicando stipendi
Sto solo volando, ci credi?
Scarpe pulite, fra', il suolo non tocca i miei piedi, no
Sto sulla base con Famous e Reggie
Parlano male della gang
Presto gli tornerà contro
La tua tipa si fa la gang
Devi infilare due condom
Sto in alto, mi sento un Concorde
Tu sei uno stupido condor
Mi riempo la vita di comfort
Occhi rossi dietro alle lenti Tom Ford

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Oou, I'm ballin' in Fendi (you ain't)
I put my bitch in Celine
I get that money, ain't a thing (ooh)
Run up on me, swear to God, get the beam (what?)
Wait, bankroll my jeans
I smoke that dope like a fiend
I get them birds, make them sing
Run up me, swear to God, surgery (what?)
Look at my chain, I got AC (what?)
All these niggas wanna be me
Huh, I get the money, no maybe
Fuckin' that bitch, man, she want have my baby
Wait, people they calling me crazy (you ain't)
Strapped up like the navy (huh)
My new bitch, she calling me shady
Copy the wave, don't get hit with the 80, yeah
