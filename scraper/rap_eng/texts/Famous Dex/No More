[Verse]
I don't want it no more
Baby girl you is a whore (I don't want it)
Fuck on the floor
Sneaking niggas through the door
We used to shop at them stores (I don't want it)
Come on man
And now I'm doing my own thing
Balling hard no magazine (I don't want it)
So fresh on the scene
Mixing molly with that lean
Oh my God what happened to me, I'm rolling (I don't want it)
A 30 on me swear a nigga on it
All these stupid bitches going phony (I don't want it)
Baby girl I don't really want ya
Swear to God
I don't want it
