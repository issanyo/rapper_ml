[Hook: Deligur]
Ridin’, cruisin’ with the windows down
Just copped a pound, it’s getting loud
Hopped on a plane, now I’m on a cloud
Flyin’ in style
Kush smoke blowing everywhere
You know it’s a green affair
And I don’t walk anywhere
I’m flyin’ in style
Ridin’, cruisin’ with the windows down
Just copped a pound, it’s getting loud
Hopped on a plane, now I’m on a cloud
Flyin’ in style
Kush smoke blowing everywhere
You know it’s a green affair
And I don’t walk anywhere
I’m flyin’ in style

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Ridin’, cruisin’ with the windows down
Just copped me a half a pound
I catch an opp, man I blow him down
Flash and me move him around
All these bitches, man they digging me
I guess they know that I’m Diddy B
All up on me, want my money
Bitch better move ‘em around
Put three grams in my backwood
Pop two Xans, now I’m sleeping good
These bitches texting me, I wish I could
Baby I got to lay down
But fuck that, man I’m back up
You know I had to get my check up
You try me, bet I blam bruh
You know I’m not no clown

[Hook: Deligur]
Ridin’, cruisin’ with the windows down
Just copped a pound, it’s getting loud
Hopped on a plane, now I’m on a cloud
Flyin’ in style
Kush smoke blowing everywhere
You know it’s a green affair
And I don’t walk anywhere
I’m flyin’ in style
Ridin’, cruisin’ with the windows down
Just copped a pound, it’s getting loud
Hopped on a plane, now I’m on a cloud
Flyin’ in style
Kush smoke blowing everywhere
You know it’s a green affair
And I don’t walk anywhere
I’m flyin’ in style

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
All these bitches know that I’m the man
I’m fly as hell, bitch no Peter Pan
They follow me up on Instagram
They know that I am up now
They say I smoke that expensive weed
Now they want to hang with me
They want to smoke thang with me
Who spreading rumors around?
She dance up on me in my foreign car
Lil baby a porn star
I see where it’s going far
Shit is ‘bout to go down
We pull up over in the driveway
Don’t care what the neighbors say
We fuck and we take a break
But let that music stay loud
