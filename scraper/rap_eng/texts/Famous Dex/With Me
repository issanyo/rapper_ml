[Hook: Fauni]
Why would you fuck with me
How did you fuck with me?
Why do you fuck with me?
Don't want you company
I want the bands, I want the guap, I want the luxury
Makin' 'em hurt for me
Movin' that work for me
Pushin' that dirt for me
Nobody murk for free
My nigga don't murk for free
Baby, just twerk on me
Shawty, wan' lurk me me
She down to hurt with me
Nobody surf with me
I don't run away, you can surf with me

[Verse 1: Fauni]
Why would you fuck with me?
These niggas can't fuck with me
Shawty wan' fuck on me
She gonna fuck for free
These niggas be payin' for P
I do not pay for no P
I just be smashin' the V
While I be throwin' the D
Shawty wan' sleep with me
Then I'm gon' pass her the team
Know I be keepin' a dot
Know I be keepin' a beam
I got your hoe off of bean
While I be off of the lean
Shawty gon' spend the night
All of the bands in my jeans
Lil boy, what did you mean?
You can see me in the street
Don't at me in a tweet
Jug and finesse, how I eat
All of these niggas is beat
All of these niggas is beat
I got you lil niggas beat
I got you lil niggas beat

[Hook: Fauni]
Why would you fuck with me
How did you fuck with me?
Why do you fuck with me?
Don't want you company
I want the bands, I want the guap, I want the luxury
Makin' 'em hurt for me
Movin' that work for me
Pushin' that dirt for me
Nobody murk for free
My nigga don't murk for free
Baby, just twerk on me
Shawty, wan' lurk me me
She down to hurt with me
Nobody surf with me
I don't run away, you can surf with me

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Nobody surf with me
Nobody hurt for me
My shooters, they shootin' for free
My shooters run up in a tree
I'm ballin' hard John Stockton
I rob the plug, I'mma sock it
I wack his bitch if she watchin'
My .30 on me who gon' stop me
I'm gettin' this money
Ridin' 'round town me and Fauni
Diamonds soo sunny
All of these bitches want money
Baby girl, can't get nothin' put dick up in her tummy
Whoa, why would you fuck with me?
Diamonds on surgery
Bitches they screamin' on me, huh
Bitches they fuckin' on me, yeah

[Hook: Fauni]
Why would you fuck with me
How did you fuck with me?
Why do you fuck with me?
Don't want you company
I want the bands, I want the guap, I want the luxury
Makin' 'em hurt for me
Movin' that work for me
Pushin' that dirt for me
Nobody murk for free
My nigga don't murk for free
Baby, just twerk on me
Shawty, wan' lurk me me
She down to hurt with me
Nobody surf with me
