I'm a brand new girl
It's lost it's meaning
If i come back right now
I'll tear at the seams
On a brand new ocean
That i haven't destroyed

With a beautiful voice
You said
I do
You'd rather melt
I'd rather scream
Can you hear me through the trees
The deer in headlights
Yes a barren new life
I still love you the same

You can keep the feelings at bay
We can practice our rituals
Let me tie up my hair
Its a seven
Seven
Seven

Seven

I've figured out how to not take up space
You're fucking me sober at your place
Your reflection is taking up my head
Dancing, singing
Disowned by my home
I love you and i don't
Thinks i'm disgusting
I'm burning alive

No you're not a liar
Think you're just confused
Wasn't your intention
But you shouldn't assume
No you're not a liar
Think you're just confused
Wasn't your intention
But you shouldn't assume
No you're not a liar
Smart and free
No one's obligated
No one's strong
If you're human at all
Then you should see i'm trying
