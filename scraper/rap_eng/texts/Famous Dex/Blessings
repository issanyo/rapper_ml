[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
It's a world full of thots all these hoes choosin' me I'm never cuffin'
And you say you gettin' money boy you playin' poker 'cause you always bluffin'
Everybody sayin' this, always sayin' that please quit the frontin'

Fuck all that bustin' and shit, me I just caught me a whip, it came with a kick
Ey bros now all screamin' y'all rich, I'll bet as your bitch, oh nah 'cause she all on my dick
She want me to give her a kiss, go run her a kiss, the stupidest bitches you sit
