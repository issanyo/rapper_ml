And my niggas cutthroat, huh, yeah, huh

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Remember them days I was broke
People was callin' me dirty, huh

Run up on me, swear to god I ain't worried, huh

[Verse 2: Black Jezuss]
Used to be so broke
And no [?] I ain't goin' back
Just copped a fifty pack, outta state sendin' that
Doin' that, doin' that, doin' that, doin' that
Like why is you doin' that?
My .40 I'm blowin' that (blaow)
Pull up with foreign whips (skrrt)
No talkin', that's sealed lips
My outfit, I killed that
Like Bibby I kill shit
Yo' bitch let me kill that
I used to be regular
But now I'm not regular (no)
They callin' me hood rich (rich)
Shout out bro Hoodrich (Pablo)
I'm used to this hood shit
My diamonds like blaowie (blaow)
I just bought a Audi (skrrt)
Fuck 'em who doubt me
You niggas so regular
I hit 'em, run 'em up (brrt)
He drippy like Famous Dex (Dex)
And shout out bro Famous Dex (Dex)
These diamonds all on my neck
Jezuss

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Remember them days I was broke

Run up on me, swear to god I ain't worried, huh
I get that money, ain't worried, huh

.30 on me like I'm Curry
Run up on me, put it right to your jersey
Remember them days I was broke
People was callin' me dirty, huh
