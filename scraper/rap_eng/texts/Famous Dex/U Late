[Verse 2: Pachino]
I wasn’t trapping out the bando
I was trapping out my grandmas
At the time I couldn’t stand her
But I love her, that’s my grandma
She the reason that I came up
We don’t do it for the fame bruh
You a pussy, tuck your chain bruh
Rolex ticking so you late bruh
In the mansion out in Cali
Rocking Balmain with the valleys
Chasing double M like Stalley
My niggas get it popping, acne
Out in Bel Air like I’m Jazzy
Roll your own ones, I ain’t passing
In the west, they in my accent
New York nigga, I ain’t acting
They got my parts’ up in the feds
Said he copping out the [?]
I told my nigga hold his head
He coming home to all this bread
With a Rolex and a Benz
He can see it through the lense
But they can’t see me through the tints
If you owe me then I’m coming for my ends

[Hook: Famous Dex]
You late, you late, you late, you late
You late, you late, you late, you late

You late, you late, you late, you late
You late, you late, you late, you late

You taking that bitch on a date
I’m getting this money, I’m great
Diamonds on a nigga, cut like a Boosie fade

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
The Rolex is cut like a Boosie fade
I started trapping in seventh grade
You taking that bitch on a date
I’m fucking your ho and I skate
All of my niggas they rich forever
Hundred bands on a bezel
Maserati peanut butter
I fell asleep on the muddy trouble
Sleeping on me, they was late
I was running up the cake
She sucking my dick and I’m making her wet
I’m just tryna get the neck
Thanking god for the blessings
Pockets salad, extra dressing
Dexter got the Smith and Wesson
You'll get hit in one second
Hit a bitch on the way to the jet
I was late, had to make it to the check
All my niggas gon’ shine with me
Hollywood, now I’m living
I had to hustle, I was straight
I won’t take you on a date
13, caught a case
Fuck school, I was late

[Hook: Famous Dex]
You late, you late, you late, you late
You late, you late, you late, you late
I fucked your lil bitch then I skate
You taking that bitch on a date
I’m getting this money, I’m great
Diamonds on a nigga, cut like a Boosie fade
You late, you late, you late, you late
You late, you late, you late, you late
I fucked your lil bitch then I skate

Diamonds on a nigga, cut like a Boosie fade
