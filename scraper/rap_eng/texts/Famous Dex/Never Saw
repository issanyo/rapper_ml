[Chorus]
Yeah
I swear to god, all for Chicago
Winter, still pop pills in Chicago
Do deal like I see in Chicago
I bought a condo in Chicago
I'mma real no live city
When a young nigga run to sell fifties
Gold on like P Diddy
Run home, swear to god, shootin' fifty

[Interlude]
Nah, for real
Like when I say that I'm from Chicago
I really mean that shit
Rozay, what's up, big bro?
Means I got you, big bro, nah, for real
Cut me up, big sis
Nah, for real
Young nigga get money
I went from nothin' to somethin'
Oh man goddamn
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'mma real no live city
When a young nigga run to sell fifties
Gold on like P Diddy
Run home, swear to god, shootin' fifty
And it's like that
Englewood niggas throwed where the hype's at
Lil nigga ride around with a bitch strapped
The other shit out the backpack, oh whoa
I swear to god, you ain't really know
Used to steal, used to steal out the store
I swear to god, you ain't really know
Used to steal, used to steal out the store
I swear to god, you ain't really know
Used to steal, used to steal out the store
Rozay got the lean poured 4
I'm just runnin' to the money I need more

[Chorus]
I swear to god, all for Chicago
Winter, still pop pills in Chicago
Do deal like I see in Chicago
I bought a condo in Chicago

[Verse 2]
Shootin' dice right behind the school
Fuck a teacher, I ain't ever know the rules
I been gettin' money stay cool
I'm winnin' look what God do
I lost my mama to breast cancer
I'm on my knees, God gave me the answer
Be cool, stop livin' life faster
I'm preachin' to ya like a pastor

[Outro]
Nah, I'm for real, though, man, you know
You gotta stay in your lane, and say, look, man
When you live life fast
You die fast, you know what I'm sayin'?
You gotta slow down, stay in your lane, you're livin' life too fast out here, ya dig?
Word to ya boy, Famous Dex
Uh, yeah (Dexter)
