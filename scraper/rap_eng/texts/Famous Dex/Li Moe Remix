[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Ya, I need some mo', lil' mo'
Ya, I need some talkin' on my wrist
Ya, Lil Boat, this the remix, ya, woah, ey
This the remix

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Woosh different colors, just like a Fago
Oeh, ya, I cop it early, just like Fandango
Oeh yaya, I'm on her mind like her Papa Kango's
I do not waste time I hit from all angles
Said this shit not real, right the shit a jingle
Bitch come lick my sack until it tingle
I call up my mom, say "let's go take a trip"
If you talk 'bout my mom, I pop you in yo' lip
Oeh yayaya, ay I glod up to the tenth power
My new bitch got my old lookin' sour (yes she did)
Turned down his price, watch him call back in an hour
Niggas sneak dissin', all these pussy rappers cowards

[Hook: Swaghollywood]
I keep the watch you know what I pay fo'
She's hella swy, yo' pockets they stay swole
He's bad like my eyes, I swear that shit stay frooze
I need some mo', lil' mo'
(Ay)
I need some mo', lil' mo'
(Woah)
I need some mo', a lil' mo'
(Woo)
I need dat' guap, ooh I like those pesos
(This the remix)
She's hella swy, yeah yo' pockets they stay swole

[Verse 2: Swaghollywood]
I gotta glow ya right now
I gotta gotta put some ice up in my mouth
Right now ay oh
My bank count large, your bank account not
I keep a lil bitch at my spot
Ay she can make my shit high
I got two cribs, I'm ballin' I feel like I'm Jordan
Speed race, Gordon, my name, lil swag, I'm portin'

[Hook: Swaghollywood]
I keep the watch you know what I pay fo'
She's hella swy, yo' pockets they stay swole
He's bad like my eyes, I swear that shit stay frooze
I need some mo', lil' mo'
(Ay)
I need some mo', lil' mo'
(Woah)
I need some mo', a lil' mo'
(Woo)

(Ooh)
She's hella swy, yo' pockets they stay swole

[Verse 3: Famous Dex]
Ay, painted my hair, you might think I'm Lil Boat, yeah
I fuck your bitch, put dick in her lil' throat
They copy me, man, you know how that go
Why copy me, so I put on a show
Ride around in an Uber, smookin' Cookie
I give a fuck a damn, 'cause they know he's a rookie
Ya, I run to 'em, yeah I need them Pesos
But.. I fuck this bitch, that lil' ho

[Hook: Swaghollywood]
I keep the watch you know what I pay fo'
She's hella swy, yo' pockets they stay swole
He's bad like my eyes, I swear shit stay frooze
I need some mo', lil' mo'
