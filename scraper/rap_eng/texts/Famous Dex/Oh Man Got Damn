Blockin bitches off the gram
I had to treat 'em like a spam
Doing hits up out the van
I just popped another xan
Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
Blockin bitches off the gram
I had to treat 'em like a spam
Doing hits up out the van
I just popped another xan
Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn

[Verse]
Blockin' bitches off the 'Gram
I had to treat 'em like a spam
Baby girl I don't wanna fuck her
I just wanna get some bands
Baby girl where ya man
Baby girl where ya man
Took off to Japan, popped like 4 xans
I just wanna get a Bentley coupe
Flash doing hits up out the roof
Run up on me then I'ma shoot
I swear to god boy, I will shoot
Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
30 make a nigga scram, get ya ass up out the jam
Everybody screamin' Famous Dex
They said the kid, man he up next
Makin' rumors saying this and that, talm 'bout boy he got a check
But I ain't even got a deal
I just want a half a mil'
I just want a half a tril'
I'm rollin' like a Ferris Wheel

Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
Blockin bitches off the gram
I had to treat 'em like a spam
Doing hits up out the van

Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
Oh man got damn
