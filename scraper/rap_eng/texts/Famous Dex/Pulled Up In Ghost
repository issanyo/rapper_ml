[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
I might pull up in a wraith
Wonâ€™t take a hoe on a date
Tell the hoe get out my face
I'm gonna fuckin' erase
I just be smokin' on ganja
Don't go boy, we straight out the jungle
I ride wit venge, ensemble
We got them racks in the bongas
I run wit the sack don't fumble
Hit his ass wit a lawnmower
If a nigga want drama, send a letter to his momma
I'm sippin' on lean, no liquor
I made it on Texas tha hitta
Ice cold like december
We catch snot, no rentals
