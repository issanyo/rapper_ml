[Verse]
I just bought a porshe
Two bitches with me ride me like a horse
But these bitches dorks
I can't trust a bitch, I took that bitch to court
I'm ballin like the court
I had to call my twin, he just bought a Benz
Flash with him too
Ohhh shit Flash don't shoot
I'm ridin round in the city
I'm ballin hard like I'm Diddy
Gold on like I'm Diddy
All these bitches man they dig me
I copped a couple in LA
I'm ridin round in LA
All these bitches hey
I'm ballin hard Marvin Gaye
I'm from Chicago like Dreezy
I wear designer like Yeezy
I'm fucking these bitches so speedy
All these bitches I don't need em
All these bitches I just treat em
All these bitches I just delete em
I call Irv then we freak em
I swear to God, then we treat em
