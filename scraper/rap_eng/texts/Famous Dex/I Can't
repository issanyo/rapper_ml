Ooh Marie got friends with her, ooh i send my friends on them

[Verse 1: P.Rico]
I cannot fuck with these niggas they snitchin', thats what im not tryna kick it
I just be handling my business, Just came from doin' a sentence
I got on silver and black, the same color as my smith and wesson
I was just flying out western
Just made 5K in 2 seconds

[Verse 2: Flyy Shaun]

If he try to try me knock off his fitted
Niggas be flexin' and flaugin and stuntin' they lying, they really not really not wit' it
A bad bitch up in the kitchen, Wippin' the work and she doin' the dishes

[Verse 3: $wagg Dinero]

Yea nigga i know that im different, ridin' round with more steel then yo neighborhood dentist

Pull up audi truck, bankroll rock wit' us

[Hook x2]
These niggas they talking ain't wit' it they bitches
I send my shooters ya kitchen
I fuck your bitch no permission
I used to trap at the trenches
Marie got friends with her, ooh I send my friends on them
Ooh Marie got friends with her, ooh i send my friends on them
