[Verse 1]
Pull up in lamb no Jeep
I got these diamonds on my teeth
What?
Your bitch she a freak, she dancing on me
Smoking on woods, no leaf
Smoking on woods, no leaf
What?
I'm sipping on lean, I feel dizzy
Second grade, I been riding since the checkmate
Rozay, got the 30 please don't tempt me
People be calling me psycho
I get the money, no Geico
Put dick in you bitch, she all in your bio
Huh, they copy the wave, so watch me just follow
Draco got the hollows
Swear to God they'll swallow
Fucking your bitch tomorrow
I get the money tomorrow
They call me tomorrow
Wait
And you know they wanna follow me
Get it since the second grade
Yeah the checkmate

Fuck your bitch then I pull her braids
I was broke back in the days
Now a nigga get stupid paid
