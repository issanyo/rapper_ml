[Hook]
My mama wanted me to be a baller but I ball a different way
I look at my Rolex, say it's time to get this cake
I throw all this money but it never fade away
Uh, hoop dreams

[Verse 1]
I used to shoot the rock until my nigga sold the rock
They try to block my shot, I'm taking rollies out the box
I used to go to practice just to work on my defence
Red and white jersey, red and white mean hit the fence
I was outside, tryna make another way
To cut the water off that soap shit that the NBA won't play
I'm tryna see a cheque tack back, let it stack
'Cause it's a long time before I see a contract
Mama, I can't help it, shit is getting real now
I know you want me in a jersey but we got these bills now
I know you want me on the court and not to visit me in court
I got you girl, just be a good sport

[Hook]
My mama wanted me to be a baller but I ball a different way
I look at my Rolex, say it's time to get this cake
I throw all this money but it never fade away
Uh, hoop dreams

What the fuck I look like going bassline with this forty on my waste line?
What the fuck I look like going bassline with this forty on my waste line?
Shorty at my phone all the time, tryna fuck me, that's a waste of time
Shorty at my phone all the time, tryna fuck me, that's a waste of time

[Verse 2: Yhung T.O.]
Sometimes I still feel like a hooper, how I ball on niggas
Talking summertime to winter and to fall on niggas
I remember back when I couldn't even call on niggas
So tell me how I'm really 'posed to feel
What the fuck I look like wasting all my time?
I got money on my line
[?]
I make forty in the day so I need eighty by my side
She ain't a dime
What the fuck I look like talking to a nine?
I've been in and out my mind but I'm back up on my shit
Tryna get some niggas past us but they back up on my list
Mama, look what I cup, she always knew that I'd be rich
Now I rap and don't play ball but I'm still balling in this bitch

[Hook]
My mama wanted me to be a baller but I ball a different way
I look at my Rolex, say it's time to get this cake
I throw all this money but it never fade away
Uh, hoop dreams

What the fuck I look like going bassline with this forty on my waste line?
What the fuck I look like going bassline with this forty on my waste line?
Shorty at my phone all the time, tryna fuck me, that's a waste of time
Shorty at my phone all the time, tryna fuck me, that's a waste of time
