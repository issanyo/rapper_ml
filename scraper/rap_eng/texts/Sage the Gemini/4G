[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I know you ain't love me from the start, see
You only love me 'cause my car is a Ferrari
You used to be so young and innocent like a Barbie
Now you knot your hair, your skin into an Ari'
Ayy, ayy, ayy, pipe down bitch
Only time that I'm regular when's this mic down, bitch
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth 'cause I thought I might sound rich
Ayy, if you wanna fuck, then it's on your count, trick (yup)
We just fuck and then it's done, don't bring your nightgown, bitch
Yeah, don't bring your nightgown, bitch
We just fuckin', then it's done, don't bring your nightgown, bitch (whoa)

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy

[Verse 2]
Big Forgis on my motherfucking truck (yeah my truck)
She let me fuck, now she can't ever get enough (can't get enough)
She hit my phone tryna be all in my business (whoa)
You need a hobby, bitch, can I get a witness? (yup)
You got options, 'member when you told me that? (you told me that)
Things changed when I hit it from the back (oh yeah, I did)
You used to leave when I say "I want you back" (I used to love you)
Now I just fuck and make you pack (hey bitch get out)
I wasted time on you, goddamn I need that back (I need that back)
You started entertaining niggas for the cash (oh yeah, oh yeah)
You was with me, I was broke, I admit that (you was there)
Now it's closets in my pocket, all these racks (oh yeah, I must)

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you might sound sick
I put diamonds in my mouth
'Cause I thought I might sound rich, ayy
