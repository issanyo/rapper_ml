[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
You gon' be moanin' 'til the morning if I can get your ass up out this club
I know that's what you came here for, for real
Yeah, your body's callin', we can call it a night right after we make sweet love
Ain't tryna make you fall in love, for real

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Girl, I won't know how you feel inside
'Til you feel me way deep inside

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
It's just something like a double entendre, double entendre
Read between the lines
That's how I let you know that I want you, know that I want you
These ain't pickup lines, girl
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, said it's double entendre

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
You can play innocent but ain't nothin' innocent about what we gon' do
You gon' be breakin' all your rules tonight
Yeah, you on your bottom while I'm strokin' on your bottom until you triangle
Baby, I'm tryna try angles left to right

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Girl, I won't know how you feel inside
'Til you feel me way deep inside

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
It's just something like a double entendre, double entendre
Read between the lines
That's how I let you know that I want you, know that I want you
These ain't pickup lines, girl
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, said it's double entendre

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
Talkin' like it's double entendre, messin' up yo makeup
Grabbon' on yo booty and I'm hopin' that it make up
Swing at it like tennis but I promise I won't play her
I just crush a lot but I promise I'm the playa
Let them legs hear about me, word of mouth
Watch me catch your ex, said I'm goin' down south
We're goin' longer than it take to fly down south
Pick it up, lay it down, watch you fall out

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
It's just something like a double entendre, double entendre
Read between the lines
That's how I let you know that I want you, know that I want you
These ain't pickup lines, girl
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, said it's double entendre
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, said it's double entendre
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, say ay ay
Say ay ay, said it's double entendre
