[Chorus]
Red on my clothes, [?] I had to go
When you wearing gold, everybody wanna know
Have you seen him? Yeah, have you seen him?

[Verse]
Yeah, I know that they want me off my level
Take my place and get my medals
Take my mind, use me as vessel
Make your head nod, yeah, you playing with the devil
This that heavy metal, you get pot for playing kettle
I got black wings with no soul, I might might just run up
On my nightstand is a .40, I don't cock it 'cause it's one up
Got me fucking [?] falling luggage, catching cases
I might run around your corner, look like greyhounds racing
I'ma run into your mama place
Disrespectful, wave it in your mama face
Broke a sprinkler, ha, I let it spray
He ain't got a face, we ain't got a case
Banana clip got me apeshit, I don't make a nigga dayshift
He was almost 40, he ain't make it 'cause I was on my 38 shit

[Chorus]
Red on my clothes, [?] I had to go
When you wearing gold, everybody wanna know
Have you seen him? Yeah, have you seen him?
