[Hook: Sage the Gemini]
Slow down, grab the wall, wiggle like you trying to make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all, now speed up, gas pedal
Gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I put my foot down yeah that's the way it is
It's looking good now what you see is what you get
Neighbourhood's hella jealous when they see the wheels
Pull up in the gun metal 'rari with a fresh fit
Gas pedal, gas pedal
Trying to keep up like adderall
I ain't even stressing no a-at all
So presidential I'm federal

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
I'm tryna get there, so when I get there
I'mma make sure you won't forget babe
So hold on, don't sweat it babe
I saw the writing on your ass and yeah I read it babe
So hold on, you won't forget it babe
Yeah you know I'm ready if you ready baby
Gotta take the short route
Pedal to the floor watch me peel out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
Now I'm responsible, I'm killing hoes, deactivate her
Dry niggas need Sheen, no Neutron say "Activate her‚Äù
It's going up, no explaining the escalator
I'm trying to keep this here alive, the Bay's respirator
Let 'em see me shine
They call me one hit wonder, now I'm at 3 times
I'm seeing big things now they want me blind
I'm in your girl phone, you ain't even check archives, huh?
Kelly boy, HBK, I make songs
Like it's my last name I must be Trey
Ballin' like Dave Chappelle, playing Princeton, we shoot the J
Fairfield where I stay, I just seen Mrs. M pay
More money for the Bay, and no, we ain't gon' pass the ball
Haters die slow and get your caskets tossed
Audi S7 sport pass 'em all
Speed up, gas pedal

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Uh, I'm the bomb, you can't disarm me
I need multiple cuts like a Swiss army
And I hope that she ain't looking for no Prince Charming
Charm yo ass in the cab on the next morning
Tell the driver, gas pedal
Young Suzy, I got cash to blow
Follow the leader, in high school I was a
Under-achiever, made haters believers
Or Beliebers, look at me, sir
Went from nobodies to 20k for a feature
Eat your heart out, used to take the BART out
To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out
When you walk in the building, the bitches run out
I should be already platinum before it come out
We do it major, look in the eyes of my haters, they say
