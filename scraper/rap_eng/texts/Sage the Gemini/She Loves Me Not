[Intro]
H-h-h-h-holy shh

[Chorus]
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
'Cause I don't feel like waitin'
Get me the answer girl, you know I'm im-patient
You know my tongue when I taste you
I used to kiss you, you would shake like I tased you
Your heart here, you ain't pick it up yet (not yet)
You should come and talk, I know you upset (upset)
You got the power through your phone
'Cause face-to-face you know that bullshit gone (gone)
It's something 'bout a real connection
Act like we cool but both of us flexin'
She like, "I ain't finna text him"
Her partner like, "Yeah right, bitch, text him"

[Chorus]
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not

[Verse 2]
We got our mind playin' Tetris
Our life a movie, we just ain't lookin' for extras
Do you love me or not? (not)
I guess the last rose petal got the answers
You know I'm romantic
The bathtub so big, you can dance in it
Under the bubbles, let me touch it
I'm about it 'cause you love it
Ayy, woah, I was feelin' like the man in it
Ayy, girl, you know I got some plans in it
Ayy, I'ma hit it, under stands in it
Ayy, give me that pool, I'ma stand in it (ayy)

[Chorus]
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not

[Interlude]
H-h-h-h-holy shh

[Chorus]
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
Or do you love me not
Do you love me
