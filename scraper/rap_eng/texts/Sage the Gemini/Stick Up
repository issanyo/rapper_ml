[Intro: Sage the Gemini]
Hands up, man down, we ain't playin' round
Hands up, man down, we ain't playin' round

[Verse 1: Lucky Daye]
Huh, hands up in the air boy freeze
Everyone drop to yo knees
Listen up very closely
Please no false move, cause I promise I'll squeeze
This is now property of Double G
Tell me who 'round here been hatin' on me
Cause boy I'm the sickest to ever do it
Since they came with the fluid
I thought you knew it
Who the fuck is foolin'
I got 'em droolin'
I'm gettin' money like I'm Jewish
These boys pussy got estrogen in your fluids
Any problem arise, like new edition, I cool it
The game changed, no brains, I'm insane
No lames In my gang, can't hang where I hang
And you knowin' that I'm with it
Yeah, you knowin' imma' finish
On the stove and I'm whippin'
First I cook it then I flip it

[Hook x2: Sage the Gemini]
Who the fuck said I ain't gon' pull up?
Who the fuck said this ain't no stick up?
Hands up, man down, we ain't playin' round here
Hands up, man down, we ain't playin' round here

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
I pull up and let go, like I'm indecisive
All black, Batman and they robbin', I don't even need a sidekick
You know who you say you is
I can tell you don't know who you playin' wit'
The type to skin a nigga face on the elevator
Press the top floor, here I'm giving out face lifts

[Verse 3: Lucky Daye]
No middle man, split a man down the middle
Niggas think I'm joking 'til I give that ass a riddle
Show up on your TV with two swivels in my dibbles
If you don't get any time, imma' mu'fukin kill 'em
Start roasting niggas, for running with pigs
Show up to your funeral like yeah look what I did
Proud of myself, don't fuck with the quite kid
I took it there, you took me there
Like that once on my idea

[Hook x2: Sage the Gemini]
Who the fuck said I ain't gon' pull up?
Who the fuck said this ain't no stick up?
Hands up, man down, we ain't playin' round here
Hands up, man down, we ain't playin' round here
