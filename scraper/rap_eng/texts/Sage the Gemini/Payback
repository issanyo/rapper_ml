[Intro: Sage The Gemini]
I know something you don't, that's me coming for you
You want war, we got war, we just wanna warn you
I know something you don't, that's me coming for you
You want war, we got war, we just wanna warn you

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
War for war, bodies that hit the ground
You ready for us, 'cause it's 'bout to go down
Push 'em to the left, push 'em to the right
Load them choppers up, hit 'em on sight, ugh
Never turning back, I've done been in hell and back
Me running out of guns? Nah, never heard of that
I ain't never ran from a gunfight
This is you and me
Mano y mano, you're damn right

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Respiratory begging for relief, I don't let 'em breathe
Goin' hard I'm my own boss, many ain't believe
A feeling, not an item, appearing up out of thin air
Conquer everything that's in front of me
Now they under me
Rush to lead and respond, they strayed away how a tunnel be
Took a leap of faith
Bungee cord about to give out
Now-a-days, whatever you say you gotta live out
Altitude, havin' parachute failure, we got a problem!
Grow a set of wings or die when you hit the bottom
Never prayed to God, but never too late to try him
Shots fired, Allen Iverson in the league
They say I ball hog and I'm not a part of the team
Breadwinner with these winners, built the regime
Taliban weapon in hand, kill everything
Amphetamines all for the state of a better means
I'm beautiful, but known for the dope like Medellin

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

[Verse 3: Future]
Dressin' all black like a funeral
Murder, homicide wanna ride get residuals
Living on fire for residuals
365 when I grind for residuals
45 magnum in the van with 'em
Ratta tatta tat, I let the blam hit 'em
I say, "fuck the whole world" and put a bomb in it
Finger on the trigger 'til I put my whole arm in it
I just want revenge
I just want revenge
We get it poppin' everyday
They took away my happiness, they tryna take my head away
You walk at night, you walk at Glam
I'm bound to 'cause some problems with it

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
