[Intro: Sage The Gemini]
You know Lucci on some other shit

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
I Got Cash in these skinny jeans (Wow damn wow)
Lil' bitch, you ain't a friend of me (But you know dat doe, wow)
Moon-walking on my haters like I'm Billy Jeans (Wow)
I got cash in these skinny jeans (Wow shit)

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Eyy, I pull up and Lucci got the other rock
How you got a attitude and you are just a 5
My girl a apple , you a dell
That's why I'm only sayin hello from the other side
You know me, I'm the motherfuking shit
Shoot your tongue out your mouth, watch me hit a fucking lick
Next up, zero in my muhfucking wrist
Your girl round me, I'm ramming in this bitch
Pull like I'm postal yeah, Confused where we throw 'em at
[??] rover at, my niggas gon crack it back
I never told them that and we cannot hold 'em back
Blam, to the back of the bus where they want Rosa parks at
I know you see me, you sending shot - I ignore that
I'm flexing  in this bitch and your girlfriend adore that
You tryna play this game and get your girlfriend took
You can have  her if you can get the bish to look
I ain't tripping lil' nigga

[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
I pull out the car with the cash in these jeans
Young, hot nigga, I'm like hundred degrees
Got rid of the Bentley 'cus I wasn't really feeling it
I'ma buy a Ghost or a BM for Halloween
I ain't seen my backyard ever since I bought the place
I want to shop, these clothes, I just contact your palce
Got paid for 30k, I don't care bout the check
I just want my front cleared, that's my damn parking space
I'm driving on the road like a ass-hole
I'm from here, I don't need no map hoe
My car black on black tho, so black it should have a name in a Afro
Holla at your muhfucking boy when you see him
Black white, ying yang , Twins BM BM
And she know, when I call, it's for the check
Collect, when I call, it's to collect, yeah
