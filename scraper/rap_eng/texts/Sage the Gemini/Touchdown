[Intro: Mishon]
Look, when you gon' stop playin' games, girl?
Throw it to me, I'mma catch it

[Verse 1: Mishon]
Lil momma, she afraid
She takin' it the front and the back seat
Wake up outta sleep
I see the coobie, itâ€™s the bomb, baby go deep
She a winner, it's merely cuz she fuckin' with the right team And I be playin' sinner, yeah, keep her dress hiking

[Pre-Hook: Mishon]
And she don't talk sports since we at the car dealer (or nah, or nah)
She ain't watchin' the game unless she's talkin' 'bout a sitcom, oh no
Got the next doll, they must think I'm a ball player, yeah
And if you ain't know, you prolly think the same, by the way shit's on

[Hook: Mishon]
She holla touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
She said, boy I love the way you touchdown, touchdown
I be all up in that end-zone while she yellin' touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
She yellin', boy I love the way you touchdown, touchdown, touchdown baby

[Verse 2: Mishon]
She quit the runnerback, yeah
And run to a nigga, where ya at?
And good in the sac, on the take-down
Yeah, she with that all-contact
No beginner, don't be tryin' playin' like a rookie
Got a temper, when we go about her beauty, no

[Pre-Hook: Mishon]
And she don't talk sports since we at the car dealer (or nah, or nah)
She ain't watchin' the game unless she's talkin' 'bout a sitcom, oh no
Got the next doll, they must think I'm a ball player, yeah
And if you ain't know, you prolly think the same, by the way shit's on

[Hook: Mishon]
She holla touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
She said, boy I love the way you touchdown, touchdown
I be all up in that end-zone while she yellin' touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
She yellin', boy I love the way you touchdown, touchdown, touchdown baby
(And y'all already know me)

[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
Uh, all she know is money, fuck the bus now, yea
That's my front, I'm in the Audi and we touchdown
When I met her she got every guard up, she knew the deal when I put 100 yards in her guts now
She can't get enough, she think she want more
I'm a baller, credit card made from indi-aye floor
100 racks in the safe drawer, almost everything payed for
Mishon told me "You're a winner" how you got me sayin' "Oh my God, and you the big sinner!"
You got that frame tell me with the picture
You got friends cuz my cousin sayin' "Bring 'em with ya"
If I leave ya I bet you still miss it
I made you say my name, one of Mike Jone is still tippin'
If I leave ya I bet you still miss it
I made you say my name, one of Mike Jone is still tippin'

[Hook: Mishon]
Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
She said, boy I love the way you touchdown, touchdown
I be all up in that end-zone while she yellin' touchdown, touchdown, touchdown
She yellin', boy I love the way you touchdown, touchdown, touchdown baby
