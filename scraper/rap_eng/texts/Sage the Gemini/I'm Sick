[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
Bitch, try this, AOB, buy this
Racks on racks in my closet
Throw a party in your mouth
Come home with no deposit
School of Hard Knox hoe, I'm a top scholar
It's black money cause Obama on the next dollar
Needles on the iPhone if you try to call her
Your mama's shirts got my ID on the collar
Stationed on the west side, you don't know me
And I don't play with my station, no Sony
I be balling like Kobe
And I wiggle in your sister like a lizard, that's a Sobee
OD, mac day, tell 'em scream that
Rimming, bet the hoe I need that
Give her money, hoes waiting to get her dream at
Swerve, all my niggas been on her

[Hook]
I'm sick
Bad hoes wanna blow my, sick
Everybody know me, I'm sick
Say you on racks, better show me
If you say you know me, then you owe me
When they ask me what it feel like
When they ask me what it feel like, I tell 'em that it feel nice
When they ask me what it feel like
When they ask me what it feel like, I tell 'em I go cause I'm sick

[Verse 2]
I got girls kissing girls, onto kissing cousins
Smash her in Crenshaw, call the thug loving
My girl super bad, McLovin
It ain't Thanksgiving but I give her stuffing
I stay in the zone, I ain't talking true
If my niggas got them pounds, you can keep them noodles too
Pull up in the whip, make your bitch say ooh wee
All my niggas shooting better than Ginobli
We all new, got your girl getting through
Tattoo, you know I had to, half of my niggas smash too
On the last 2, yeah we past through, you ain't that dude
I'm the shit nigga, where the fuck the bathroom?
We going dumb like a nigga dropped outta school
Your girl Snapchatted me a couple other nudes
Middle finger's up, fuck the rules
I stick with ratchets, I ain't talking 'bout the game too

[Hook]
I'm sick
Bad hoes wanna blow my, sick
Everybody know me, I'm sick
Say you on racks, better show me
If you say you know me, then you owe me
When they ask me what it feel like
When they ask me what it feel like, I tell 'em that it feel nice
When they ask me what it feel like
When they ask me what it feel like, I tell 'em I go cause I'm sick
