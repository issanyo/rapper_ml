[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
You ain't fuck with me in school, but you do now, like it's all cool, but I knew that
You flaked on me for old dude, now he on rap facts and it's cool 'cause I knew that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Hear this and hit the playback
Bounce to Fairfield in a Maybach
And tell them niggas who said that I wasn't where I said I was from, oh wait, they ain't say that
AK SQ , yeah my home dawg
I was in the field like I was looking for a home run
Old haters, let the new ones hold some
Your new freak, that's my old stuff
I got old beef that just rolls up
Face to face, they 'ont know nut'in'
Feel like I'm speakin' loud with Elsa, how you froze up
Focused on the yeast, get your dough up

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
You ain't fuck with me in school, but you do now, like it's all cool, but I knew that (but I knew)
You flaked on me for old dude, now he on rap facts and it's cool 'cause I knew that. (ee-yeah)
And now , all a sudden you a bird 'cause you see me in a Coupe , but it's cool 'cause I knew that (whoa)
And now you want to wait until you lost, saw yo' ass just to come, double back, but you blew that (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
I'm on the phone with Steve B right now
I only rock with olda' niggas, bring the heat down
I'm on the the line with Colleine right now, he said "calm down, leave it up to us to hold the streets down
You do this rap shit and don't fucking fail"
Free Turtle, he gon' show you how you shouldn't tell
I know the block dreaming 'bout you coming home on bail
To show these young niggas how they really frail
I'm so good in the hood, new nigga, you should get it understood, yeah yeah yeah
And if you really ain't new, then it's part of the song shouldn't change yo' mood, yeah yeah yeah

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
You ain't fuck with me in school, but you do now, like it's all cool, but I knew that (but I knew)
You flaked on me for old dude, now he on rap facts and its cool 'cause I knew that (ee-yeah)
And now , all a sudden you a bird 'cause you see me in a Coupe , but it's cool 'cause I knew that (whoa)
And now you want to wait until you lost, saw your ass just to come, double back, but you blew that (yeah yeah yeah)
