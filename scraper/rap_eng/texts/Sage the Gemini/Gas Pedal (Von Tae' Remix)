Holy shit!
Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal [x5], now
Speed up, gas pedal [x3]


(Verse 1)
Nigga ballin' like the muh' fuckin NBA
Schoolin’ these niggas like a GED
All day everyday I’m getting paid
I’m hotter than Miami and I ain't talkin' bout' D Wade
Gon head make it bounce like Spalding
Make it rain on it like dominoes falling
One hundred, two hundred, three hundred, four
Pockets like a bakery, I’m rolling in the dough
Gon head and make that  ass pop for me
Move that ass like hands on a clock for me
Shake it, don’t break it and just don’t stop for me
Make that booty jump, gon' head and make it drop for me

Ass so phat you could be a stripper
Throw that ass right and I might tip ya
Whisper in your ear while you on the wall
Gon head and meet me in the bathroom stall

(Chorus)
Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal [x5], now
Speed up, gas pedal [x3]
