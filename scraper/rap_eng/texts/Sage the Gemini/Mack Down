(Baby can't leave me alone, she been tryna' get me home)
(Now she wants the number to my phone, guess I really turned her on)

Ok she down to taste it, get down, face it

She ain't never hit the strip but she quick to strip naked
I got a girl from the city, she be on a roll
Uh, good brains, give me honor roll
Whoa, and don't be taking too long
Wasting time and shit, you better take me home
