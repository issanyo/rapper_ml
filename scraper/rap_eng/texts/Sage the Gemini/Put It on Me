[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
I don't wanna leave here without ya, I just want you to know
All night I've been thinking about ya, so if you ready to go
Baby come on my way, I can tell by the look that's all on your face
You want it too

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
When you came around me, you don't know what you started
You know what I need, a night alone with your body
Put it on me, p-put it on me, p-put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me, p-put it on me, p-put it on me

[Verse 2: Austin Mahone]
Can't help myself, girl I wanna feel on it, back it up on me
And you can tell how bad I want it, I wanna like you on me
Baby come on my way, I can tell by the look that's all on your face
You want me too

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
When you came around me, you don't know what you started
You know what I need, a night alone with your body
Put it on me, p-put it on me, p-put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me, p-put it on me, p-put it on me

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
Ya already know me, S-A-G-E
I feel like it's time already (yea)
I feel like you made up your mind already
Your ex feeding you lies, got you fed up (fed up)
Time to cross him out like the sign on Chevy
Me and you in the Coupe, I feel like all leather
I bring sand to the beach cause my sand better
You ex tryna joke cause we pull up on floss
Last time somebody jump, I had Kris get Kross'ed
Where I'm from, kinda scared to have it
I be tryna get the number and forget I have it
That's a shame, I don't wanna do the games
You the one, I couldn't call you the main, hey!

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
When you came around me, you don't know what you started
You know what I need, a night alone with your body
Put it on me, p-put it on me, p-put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me, p-put it on me, p-put it on me
