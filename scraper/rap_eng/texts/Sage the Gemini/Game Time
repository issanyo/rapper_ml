[Chorus: Flo Rida]
It's about to go down in a minute
Let me touchdown, I'mma get it
Cause I, I, I been waiting all night
To make it go from the friend zone to the end zone
Tryna take it to the house, baby, let's go
Cause I, I, I been waiting all night
It's game time

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I'mma hustler, baby, why you think they pay me?
Let me know when you're ready to roll
Do 180 in the gray Mercedes
South Beach where they love me the most
And you know they gon' watch me ballin' like I'm Michael Jordan
And always win like he did in the fourth
When the shots is falling and the phone's recordin'
Yeah, you know that we doing the most

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
We gon' make it rain, rain, rain
Like we won the championship game
We gon' need some more champagne to take it all the way

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
It's about to go down in a minute
Let me touchdown, I'mma get it
Cause I, I, I been waiting all night
To make it go from the friend zone to the end zone
Tryna take it to the house, baby, let's go
Cause I, I, I been waiting all night
It's game time

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
I'mma let you shop until your fingers sore
I'mma ball the credit card made from
Me, Mi-yayo flow
It's game time and I'm in the post
Nah, me and your ex can't have the same score
Tryna hit the end zone 'fore the friend zone
And maybe bring friends to the end zone
It's up to you when we in Syracuse
Get you hot and cool you down, I got the damn flu

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
We gon' make it rain, rain, rain
Like we won the championship game
We gon' need some more champagne to take it all the way

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
It's about to go down in a minute
Let me touchdown, I'mma get it
Cause I, I, I been waiting all night
To make it go from the friend zone to the end zone
Tryna take it to the house, baby, let's go
Cause I, I, I been waiting all night
It's game time

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
Step back, hit 'em with the shake
Cross over, going hard in the paint
Hit that, money in the bank
All star, watch me do it all day
Step back, hit 'em with the shake
Cross over, going hard in the green
Hit that, money in the bank
All star, going hard

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
It's about to go down in a minute
Let me touchdown, I'mma get it
Cause I, I, I been waiting all night
To make it go from the friend zone to the end zone
Tryna take it to the house, baby, let's go
Cause I, I, I been waiting all night
It's game time
