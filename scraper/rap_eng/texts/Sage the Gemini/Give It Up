Money cars clothes bars blow
Bunch of drug money stuffed in my car
Go, high when I let baby for the skin
All my girls sleep with many many men
Give me ends

How I'm so on and I'm underground
Why these pretty ass bitches give me money now
Just to come around lay it down yeah 100 round
I'm talking about cash yeah you know me
I was shipping OG, OT in '03
Rollie on my wrist sit on chrome feet
I'm FedEx Berner I got my own trees
We ain't love no bopper
We just stash gram bags of Parada in our locker
My shoe game proper, they call me big papa
If I knock her I'ma take her for every single dollar
Give it up
