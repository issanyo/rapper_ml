Pussy coming, Pussy going
I only fuck if she's looking foreign
I only drive if the whip imported
Money be coming from different sources
Bitches be on me they say I'm gorgeous
I do not fuck with you fake informants
I be with niggas who stay extorting
I be in places you play to dome in [?]
Hood nigga with expensive taste
Balenciaga, Alexander Wang
Free all my homies and fuck the jakes
Norman [?], I got bucks for days
Run and my shooters gone bust a day
That's a final shoot you I'm a fucking ape
Don't confuse me with niggas you heard about
I don't gossip and I don't do word of mouth nigga

[Chorus]
Aayy
Watch what you say, watch how you say it
Talk about me, better
Watch what you say, watch how you say it
Watch what you saying

[Verse 2, Sage the Gemini]
Pull up, I'm going mental schizo
Tell the choppa what to do, like i'm his mentor
Hot when they change the temp in december
On the tip of her tongue like she almost remember
I'm not the type to address the hate
No you can not chill with us, this ain't section 8
Bag if she work, you need resume
I'm sporting 18k, I just got 8 and 8 - top and bottoms
All these models, No IQ or a plan to follow
In they bio, aspiring model
Hit the club and see them carry bottles but i know you stressing
Woah
Rocking YSL you looking like he a blessing
He a blessing
Yeah

[Chorus]
Aayy
Watch what you say, watch how you say it
Talk about me, better
Watch what you say, watch how you say it
Watch what you saying

[Verse 3]
Niggas talking like a bunch of bitches
Walk up on them and they run like bitches
Used to hustle just to fund the business
Pumping packs, punk it's nothing different
Try and play me, watch they come up missing
Bitches love me, cause they just love the vision
I don't love them, I just fuck and ditch them
I be focused on the fucking mission
Semi-auto got 100 rounds
I be up when the sun is down
Sleeping on me get you killed quick
I got better shit to deal with

[Chorus]
Aayy
Watch what you say, watch how you say it
Talk about me, better
Watch what you say, watch how you say it
Watch what you saying
