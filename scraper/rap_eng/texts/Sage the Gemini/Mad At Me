[Chorus: Jay Ant & Sage the Gemini]
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt
All I want (They like hey!)
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
I've been on my job since birth
I'll let you hate, if you tell me what it's worth
Living good, but you will get murked
I like blank tees, I don't want you on the shirt, uh
But it ain't gotta be like that
We can all stunt together, we can all get stacks
If you don't like me I'ma still aim fat
If you don't like me, I'ma still give back
I'ma stunt, I'ma floss, yeah all dat
Roll up, Coupe, with the top back
If you mad, change your face, tell the Shmop pack
That's Kool John bruh, you should cop dat
Niggas, you mad cause I got far
So much ice on the left, rolls the right arm
Six girls on the left and the right arm
Take them to bed, say good night y'all

[Chorus: Jay Ant & Sage the Gemini]
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt
All I want (They like hey!)
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
These nigga keep playin' me, I tell them game on
Something like the fridge uh, I stay on
On the opposite of what they on, yea'
She on the nuts, still hang on
Bottoms of a Baghdad, cause is stink on it yea'
Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pound, that shit you like, I create the sound
Fake friends wanna run their mouth
They didn't get it then, understand it now

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
If I don't have a Benz, I'm gon' get it now
I don't have a thing, but I'm gone hand it out
I don't message these chicks, cause they run their mouth
Now a young nigga rich, I'ma say it loud
(I don't message these chicks, cause they run their mouth
Now a young nigga rich, I'ma say it loud)

[Chorus: Jay Ant & Sage the Gemini]
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt, I'm gone stunt
All I want (They like hey!)
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me
Niggas gon' have to be mad at me
