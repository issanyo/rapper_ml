[Verse 1: Chrishan]
Don’t ya know these hoes be unfaithful?
All the booties straight to the table
Talkin’ 'bout Tiffany and Lisa ooh
Can I dip? Girls want a VISA ooh
Girl, ya know that I keep 'em
Two more and we could have a threesome, ooh
Your friends keep lookin’, cook it down
They only hate us cause they ain’t us

[Pre-Hook: Chrishan]
Ooh, hop on it, 2 am, you know she horny
I know she got a man but she want it
You know I’m not judgin’

[Hook: Chrishan]
Don’t you know these hoes be unfaithful
All the booties straight to the table
Unfaithful (oh yeah)
Unfaithful (oh yeah)
Don’t you know these hoes be unfaithful
All the booties straight to the table

[Verse 2: Chrishan]
Woah, oh shit look what I did
Bitin’ on your ear like Tyson
What about your man? Now she wanna be an item
It’s time to go, she says she wanna stay
She says she want to taste my DNA

[Pre-Hook: Chrishan]
Ooh, hop on it, 2 am, you know she horny
I know she got a man but she want it
You know I’m not judgin’

[Hook: Chrishan]
Don’t you know these hoes be unfaithful
All the booties straight to the table
Unfaithful (they so unfaithful)
Unfaithful (you know)
Don’t you know these hoes be unfaithful
All the booties straight to the table

[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
Tonight the Conga room
Tomorrow morning, the emergency room
Money made a few things change, break up different girls
Tellin’ me their legs need space, uh
Nowadays they be likin’ to look
Niggas be trippin’, got a council of crooks
I be so geared, drivin’ em crazy with no steer
Paint flip and livin’ color out in Greer, yuh

[Hook: Chrishan]
Don’t you know these hoes be unfaithful
All the booties straight to the table
Unfaithful, unfaithful
Don’t you know these hoes be unfaithful
All the booties straight to the table
