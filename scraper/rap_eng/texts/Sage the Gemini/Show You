[Intro: Justin Credible]
Yeah! LA Leakers leaks of the industry baby!
Let's take it to the bay one time
Shout out to our homies P-Lo and Sage The Gemini!

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Spanish girls call me chinito
[?] gone easy like free throws
You know it's me on the beat though
After the club yeah I beat those
Then I probably wake up in it
You a punk, you probably put your face up in it
I ain't even gotta ask in the club
Always gripping on her ass

[Hook: P-Lo]
Girl go ahead and bend the shit
You're gon' make a real one wanna spend that shit
I know what you need, what you like
Got a boyfriend but he don't do it right
I can show you how a real one do (x3)

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
And I still go
Your girl tell me it's good, like a field goal
When she trying to get me sprung she go real slow
When she trying to get me sprung she go real slow
But girl you can't play a real one
Been a young boss and you know I'm still one
Don't bring your girl around cause you know I'll steal her
When she wear leggings you know I pill her
Living like a young Mac
Tell a bitch throw it back
20k for a track
Might pull up in the Benz
All the hoes want sin
Got your bitch in my den
And I rep that HBK shit
No patience, fuck around get replaced then
I ain't playing no games
Got your girl screaming my name

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
I'm the realest that's first things first
My biscuits ain't limp but shoutout Fred Durst
No homo, let's get one thing clear
My hands probably touch more purses than yours
This hoes sick, I bet I have cure
A real nigga does his thing and it's pure
He said he ball like me, and he said it sincere
I laugh and say cop iamSu!'s Sincerely Yours
Imma show you how a real one do
I'm a fly Young Thug skywalking no Luke
Making all my girls have a dispute
Eating on them hoes too full I might puke
Walking tall with my big boy lines
And I ain't talking to you hoes without a big boy prize
Cause all ya'll do is waste time
But that ain't gonna work this time

[Hook (x3)]
