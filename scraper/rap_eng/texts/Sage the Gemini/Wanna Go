[Intro]
(League of Starz)
Tran, what up
(Tran on the beat)

[Sage the Gemini]
Step up in the club you remember me
Bottle service VIP but I don't drink
Club packed and it's filled with some super freaks
Freaks yeah freaks and they on me
I left my girl at home, ran into a trap
Hood-rats but they bad trying to kidnap
They trying to take me home but I'm faithful
They doing all these tricks but I can't go
Gotta look out, get my money and book out
All this mean here, this ain't a club it's a cook out
It's like the army, bringing the big guns out
They know I'm balling, so they lining up in the dug out
All this ass make a nigga bite his fist off
And I'ma leave the club all pissed off
Get home to my girl clothes ripped off
And I'ma make her do it until I get soft

[Hook]
You trying to take me home
But I'm trying to be faithful
You wear [?]
Girl you wanna make me go like
(Ohh wow, Goddamn)
You make me wanna go
(Ohh wow, Goddamn)
You make me wanna go
