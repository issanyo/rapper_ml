[Intro]
A bad girl don't just mean good sex, get weed, V.I.P
I need a bad girl who done caught the good way going for her PHD

[Verse 1]
You gon' try to end up with that one rapper
Club time, hit up a nigga tell they after
You know the promoter you don't stand in line
Parachute pants, make a nigga want that hammer time
It's easy, yeah you see it's easy
Hit up the list in the party where the rest of the freaks be
Dressed to the nine catch a nigga with gre-een
Want niggas to drop money up on three T's
I know what type of girl you are
Got famous cause you pregnant, you a new star
Child support got you a car, but your baby still hungry like oooo ahhhh

[Hook]
A bad girl don't just mean good sex, get weed, V.I.P
I need a bad girl who done caught the good way going for her PHD
I want a bad girl x3
Get at me bad girl
I want a bad girl x3
Get at me bad girl

[Verse 2]
See me in that new whip going crazy
Top write of the papers, she gon' wanna date me
I'm from where they made that shit up
Trying to gang me, we gon' break that shit up
And if you fell we gone hang that shit up
Before I fuck and make you leave, rake that shit up
Explosive young nigga with a lot of dollars if we was back in high school would you wanna holler?
Gucci, Louis shirts everything collared
And you look beauty till you hit the parlor
You like y'all niggas getting fade but you are not the barber
Most of these ballers you be picking don't even be starters

[Hook]
