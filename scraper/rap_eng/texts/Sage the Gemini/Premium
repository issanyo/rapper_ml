[Intro]
Ho-ho-ho-ho-holy shit

[Chorus]
I'm not the one you mad at
Put that and your ex in the trash bag
He don't hit it good 'til I'm past that
Please don't make me pay for your Snapchat
Tonight ain't your night, they throwin' off
I seen it for myself and now I'm gall as much
I'm not the one you mad at
Please don't make me pay for your Snapchat

[Verse 1]
Run up a check and go get my own damn cash
She told me tell her ex kiss her motherfucking ass
You don't let the world so cold
I would warm you up but my wrist so froze
Niggas ain't shit, I know
The only way we talk is CamSoda
Just know, I'm not the one you mad it
Please don't make me pay for your Snapchat
You gon' make me work, I got my hard hat
Attitudes, mood swings, all that
Tryna get you in this heart like I'm senile
And I tried to add your Snap but it's premium

[Chorus]
I'm not the one you mad at
Put that and your ex in the trash bag
He don't hit it good 'til I'm past that
Please don't make me pay for your Snapchat
Tonight ain't your night, they throwin' off
I seen it for myself and now I'm gall as much
I'm not the one you mad at
Please don't make me pay for your Snapchat

[Verse 2]
Don't take it out on me 'cause your ex nigga broke
Car black rims, black vehicle, whoa
Last girl act like you, I hit and broke
Last time I chased one of you, I went broke (broke)
I'm tryna know the real you (you)
Not the youg soul but they healed you (you)
Showered you with patience and some real food
Felt like a setup, you felt like I was tryna kill you
All these years, you learned how to make your shield better
Takin' niggas money 'cause you think it make you feel better (nope)
Mentally giving you real weather (yup)
All your secrets in my sealed letter

[Chorus]
I'm not the one you mad at
Put that and your ex in the trash bag
He don't hit it good 'til I'm past that
Please don't make me pay for your Snapchat
Tonight ain't your night, they throwin' off
I seen it for myself and now I'm gall as much
I'm not the one you mad at
Please don't make me pay for your Snapchat
