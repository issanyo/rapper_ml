All up in my ear, yeah she on me

You know I can't here with my crew
But I'm tryna leave with you
You know I'm tryna leave with you

[Hook: Ryan Stylez]
Ohh, I'm feeling on your body like
Ohh, And I can see it in your eyes

[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
She wanna be down, meet the standards
She like my Bentley and cameras
Car black, you're white like a panda
Desiigner, I must have broads in Atlanta
I want a girl who go to work at the mall
Regular clothes and all, curly hair that fall
She be playing and my partner, be like, bruh, move on
There's bigger fish in the sea but she damn near Jaws
I'm like hey
I know you don't need fancy
I'm Jamie, you Fancy
Keep your heart and don't mind me
And I know how to get to smile
Wait, I'm in town, one question

[Hook: Ryan Stylez]
You wanna be down, come through
It's just me and you
You wanna be down, come through
Know a couple things we can do
She wanna be down, oh, down
She wanna be down, oh, down
She wanna be down, oh, down
She wanna be down, oh, down
She wanna be down
