[Hook: IamSu!]
Always see me stunt with something new
Always see me stunt with something new
More than a little, little, little
More than a little, little, little
Always see me stunt with something new
Always see me stunt with something new
More than a little, little, little
More than a little
I don’t front for nobody
I don’t front for nobody
Always see me stunt with something new

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
I know you see me, know you see me all the time
It’s a, list of people trying to get you with sali
She independent, got to get it on the grind
But I’m going to get it, I can’t get it off my mind
93 octane, that’s what a car takes
She want to put a Bandaid over the heartbreak
Swaging out all day
The one like a ball fade
Soaking up all game
Your boy on a campaign
Me and Kiki smoking tree-tree
I’m going to pull up on her bumper like beep-beep
I know you haters can’t beat me
Make your girlfriend leave you and keep me

[Hook: IamSu!]
Always see me stunt with something new
Always see me stunt with something new
More than a little, little, little
More than a little, little, little
Always see me stunt with something new
Always see me stunt with something new
More than a little, little, little
More than a little
I don’t front for nobody
I don’t front for nobody
Always see me stunt with something new

[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
Since you think you famous, you’re going to get it
And since you think you famous, you’re going to hit it, huh?
She talkin' 'bout, "Let me remind you"
I’m like "Shut the hell up, I want your partner behind you"
Missed out, now you act all sour
Your friend in the car that do 200 miles per hour
You trying to block because fiend for power
Crib 10,000 square feet, she like "I’m fine without her"
I ain’t flexing, I just live a different lifestyle
I pack a Magnum and your ex be using LifeStyles
Your ex ain't live like me, huh?
Well, how are you still adjusting to my lifestyle?

[Hook: IamSu!]
Always see me stunt with something new
Always see me stunt with something new
More than a little, little, little
More than a little, little, little
Always see me stunt with something new
Always see me stunt with something new
More than a little, little, little
More than a little
I don’t front for nobody
I don’t front for nobody
Always see me stunt with something new
