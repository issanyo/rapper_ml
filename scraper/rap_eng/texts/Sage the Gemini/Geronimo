[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, aw, aw
Somebody tell the club owner he don’t need no mop tonight
‘Cause you about to make it drop tonight
‘Cause everytime that you dance
Every thing that’s on the floor end up on your pants
Cause you be getting low (low)
You be getting low (low)
You be getting low (low)
You be getting low (low)
Sh-Shawty getting low (low)
You be getting low (low)
You be getting low (low)
You be getting low (low)
Sh-Shawty getting low (low)
It’s going down, Geronimo
Geronimo
It’s going down, Geronimo
Mo-mo-mo-mo-mo
Mo-mo-mo-mo-mo
It’s going down, Geronimo

[Verse: Ty Dolla $ign]
I told her drop it down, take it low (take it low)
She know what she doing, she professional (professional)
Said she want more, there’s levels though (stairs)
Fucked her in the living room, she never seen my room
I give her long dick, nothing else (nothing else)
Her mama think it’s something else (something else)
She give me dome on the highway (highway)
Getting ho ass sex in the driveway (woo)
I sound like domino (domino)
They used to call us ratchet now we popping off
She get low then she get lower (get lower)
I ain’t got nothing but dick for her
I fuck her from the back then forward
This a Rolex, not Michael Kors
This pushing ain't the label man it's Taylor gang
She let me hit it ‘cause I got a song with T-Pain

[Verse: Sage The Gemini]
It's going down Geronimo (Geronimo)
After I'm done , you gotta go
She moving I'm losing all of my money
And the way she make clap she can damn near
Take it all from me
I tell her drop it like a bad employee
The way she moving I be swearing that the lady know me
And this is why I do not do strip clubs
Cause when I leave that shit I be swearing that them girls owe me
One cheek, Two cheek, both cheeks
Tear it up it's illegal to not show cheeks
Take it off the ground, use no feet
Round of applause like the crowds on the show be
Drop it down on a nigga do damage
I see a few panoramic
Yeah, private party no cameras
Make them all lose they panties
