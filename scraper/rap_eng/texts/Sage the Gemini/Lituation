[Chorus]
If this gon' be your first time
It should be with me, it should be with me
One time for the one time
Yeah, we gon' see, yeah, we gon' see
You should let me take control of the situation
Girl, I bet tonight is gonna be a lituation

[Verse 1]
You too fine to only wanna love me
You too fine to only wanna touch me
You'll be saying please don't put no one above me
You already here still yelling that I'm coming
You got a man, but still want me on the d-low
That's not what I do, not really my steelo
If the tables turn, you'll be smoking like a steamboat
Screaming, "Fuck you" like Cee-Lo
I am not gon' lie, you the baddest thing
Red bottoms click the floor like before Michael Ian
I heard you got that, put it on me
Let me get your math, let your hotline bling

[Chorus]
If this gon' be your first time
It should be with me, it should be with me
One time for the one time
Yeah, we gon' see, yeah, we gon' see
You should let me take control of the situation
Girl, I bet tonight is gonna be a lituation

[Verse 2]
You should let me be what you want
You should let me do what he don't, yeah
Guarantee they cutting me off
Those your panties? Yeah, I'm taking these off
When you come back, you gon' feel a little different
I ain't dissing on your man, but we just built a little different
Yeah, I'm charged up, my Mophie got some more percentage
I'ma far up from the couch to the kitchen
Ok, which side is your best side?
Is it this side? Is it that side?
Call me Big Papa like we out in Bed-Stuy
You can be my drug, you the best high

[Chorus]
If this gon' be your first time
It should be with me, it should be with me
One time for the one time
Yeah, we gon' see, yeah, we gon' see
You should let me take control of the situation
Girl, I bet tonight is gonna be a lituation
