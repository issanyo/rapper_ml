Heard you got the plug ASAP

[Pre-Hook: Milla]
Awww, what y’all wanna do?
Wanna be ballin', poppin' bottles till you fallin'
Poppin’ mollies till you pass out (Hell Yeah)
What happen here, stay here, betta’ cash out

[Hook: Milla x2]
This is sin city
Sin sin sin city
City, sin sin sin city
Sin city
Blowin’, blowin’ all these stacks, don't know how to act
Throwin’, throwin’ all these stacks stacks
This is sin city

[Verse 1: Milla]
Bunch of bad bitches all gettin’ rich (Hell Yeah)
Better throw bands at 'em (huh)
Ball out when I step in this bitch
Buy a hundred bottles throw grands at 'em (skurt)
Grey, Grey Goose make the booty loose (booty loose)
Moet make the pussy wet
Write a check, I'ma place a bet, bitches come in sets
Groupie hoes wanna see the suite, all kinda sex
Black card, need no bodyguard got my goons with me
Act hard, fix a bitch nigga got my tools with me
EPA niggas act a fool with me (fool with me)
And by the end of the night, got thirty bitches in the room with me (ride)
Wake up in the morning gotta thank God
Just bought a Benz with a multi-colored paint job (skirt)
I don't wanna sin, I don't wanna go to hell
But if fuckin' her a crime, I'ma go to jail

[Pre-Hook & Hook: Milla]

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
Step in this ho like what I need a bitch for
I'ma start a riot with a pitchfork
Throw this money she gon' open like a rich door
Hoes thristy I'm lookin' like a big gulp
Commas on my checks but I don't take a breath
Pull up in the val like a dog take me to the vet
Walkin' in your hood without a vest, I don't get in checked
Nigga test, sex no condom, I'ma make a mess (ugh)
Next best up like I got sick off of Spike Lee equipment I'm throwin' sets up
MOB mob hoe, bring them checks up
9/11 under your neck, I blow your chest up
Spend money till the president nauseous, yeah caution
All you niggas teeth and I’m flossin'
Got to go eat bosses, tiger hand you pausing
Like blow job Betty LOL you jawsin' yeah

[Bridge: Milla x4]
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, roll 'em
Put the money up, don't fold 'em
