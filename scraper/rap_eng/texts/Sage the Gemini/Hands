[Verse 1]
One for the Money, yeah
Two for the Show, yeah
Three to get you home
Bitch, you can not use your phone
I be in my zone
Just don't talk to me, I'm busy
Riding in a Rafe
Counting one hundreds and fifties
I dress like a dealer
But I don't got drugs with me
She [?] until it hit me
She text me like, "Come get me"
But I do not do lames
You don't drive, you can miss me
That mean you being lazy
Just forget you hit me
You not worth my gas
Even out with some cash
Two thou, I wipe my ass
Three thou, I just been last
Your man, we different class
He broke, that's why we clash
All I make is smash
Go Platinum, he get mad
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I pull up in foreign
It ain't, it must be boring
The girls, they run they lips
They kids at home, they hungry
You sound super crazy
Tryna hurt one who seen millions
I'm tryna touch that billion
My swag, it touch a trillion
I'm at the galleria
I'm buying what I'm seeing
She hatin' and she choosin'
I think she's overthinkin'
I tell her calm down
Should I leave her?
Do ya need me?
She ask me for the math
I kept it lit like B.I.C. did
I just ain't seen the flame
Hate hoes who play the game
I'm tryna get this change
I wish you'd do the same
I'm ridin' in the Bentley
I don't think she can offend me
Of course, she think this rented
She can only afford renting
Aye
