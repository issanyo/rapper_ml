[Hook: Sage]
Bad women in my VIP, my suit and T-I-E
Money greener than my eyes
Leave a nigga like me [?]
God you're soaking, let me see
You're moving like you know me
Fill your cup up, shut up (x3)
Shout out to the DJ (x4)

[Verse 1: Dmac]
Shout out to the DJ, turn up
My record main cought up in traffic
Booty moving like it's switching lanes
Shout out to the DJ, turn up
My record main crowd look like it's on opposite of riddeling
Intercept you girl like a cornerback I'm Finnegan
Hit it once let it go, now I'm fin' again
Call me the winner man
I get her all the dividends
If it's good at nothing you know I might hit again
Better watch your girl, I'm her man crush Monday
She in my room, we play football every Sunday
Bend it over hike, then I rush right
Yelling touchdown we at it all night!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Milla]
Ball out, bitch Tom Ford, Hood Lord
To your girl, you a bore
So she called Thor
Put the hammer down
Real dick, no hand-me-down
She twerk it on the wall
Drop it down, pass that ass around
Bad women in my VIP, can I CID?
If she wanna be with me I need that COD
Sat her on my lap, said she wanna drink
Shut up! I bought every bottle at the bar
Get the club wetter
Everybody know that I'm a star
Cause my stack gain
Milla used to balling all day
That's a black game
100 rack thing that I drive on my day-to-day
And my shit lean on [?]

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jmaine]
Woah girl, let me see you do that
Upside down let me see that booty clap

[Hook]
