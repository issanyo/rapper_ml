[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
And y'all already know me
Bay Area in nigga I'm six figures
In these jeans I walk in those chippers
Shout out to the hoes that [?]
But now I'm Biggie to my mouth, in my car they go 'member
Snatchin niggas shit like yup, they don't need that
If he fed up he get fed, But I won't give feedback
I look like a movie I know niggas seen that
Sharper than a needle I'm feeling like Sea-Tac
Pull up to the club in the front like don't want move [?]
