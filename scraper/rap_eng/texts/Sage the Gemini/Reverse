[Intro]
Throw it in reverse
Throw it in reverse

[Verse 1]
Low-key wanna wife her
In jeans with the rikers
Every girl wanna fight her
She make the light get brighter
Tryna get her to the right spot
White fur got her white hot
Like I only got one shot
Walk through and like why not

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been watching you, all night
I need your body, tonight

[Chorus]
Wait now, let me get it first
Going down to your back, muscles hurt
Ayy, throw it in reverse
Ayy, throw it in reverse
Go up, down to the dirt
Take a lil' 'til your back muscles hurt
Ayy, throw it in reverse
Ayy, throw it in reverse

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she was pulling my steelo
I got green like Cee-Lo
Yeah, she see me balling like the D-League
Ayy, her ex-man was on the D-Low
Wow, I walked straight into the action
Step in it, treat me like I'm Michael Jackson
In VIP, looking like I went platinum
It's still keep the bread under the mattress
And she right from her head to her heels
I'm on her mind like she forgot to pay her bills
And you can ride if you keep it, real
She want the pickle 'cause she know the dill (whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been watching you, all night
I need your body, tonight

[Chorus]
Wait now, let me get it first
Going down to your back, muscles hurt
Ayy, throw it in reverse
Ayy, throw it in reverse
Go up, down to the dirt
Take a lil' 'til your back muscles hurt
Ayy, throw it in reverse
Ayy, throw it in reverse

[Verse 3]
I know you see me with the ice on
I want to see you with the light the lights on
She tryna wiggle in my section
You go hard when it's my song
I know these dudes be all in your face
Spin a check, tryna get you to their place
Moving fast like they tryna win a race
And that's cool but I ain't down for the chase
I got big bills, phone calls to make deals
Playing your cards right, just wait 'til I deal
And you do what you want when you copping
I would chase but I got too many options

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been watching you, all night
I need your body, tonight

[Chorus]
Wait now, let me get it first
Going down to your back, muscles hurt
Eyy, throw it in reverse
Eyy, throw it in reverse
Go up, down to the dirt
Take a lil' 'til your back muscles hurt
Eyy, throw it in reverse
Eyy, throw it in reverse

[Outro]
She only like me for the diamond on my wrist
Diamonds on my neck, six diamonds on the check (On the check)
She only like for the diamond on my wrist
Diamonds on my neck, six diamonds on the check (On the check)
She only riding for the diamond on my wrist
Diamonds on my neck, six diamonds on the check (On the check)
She only like me for the diamond on my wrist
Diamonds on my neck, six diamonds on the check (On the check)
