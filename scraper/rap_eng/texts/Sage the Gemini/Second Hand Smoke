[Intro]
Oh, it's a cold world
Don't let yourself be corrupted!
Be yourself! Life's second hand smoke!

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Huh, life's second hand smoke, thoughts of being a criminal
Far from being a doctor, my opera is singing kill these fools
Around here it's just me, buddy Ricky and Cameron
Man, we ain't wanna hurt nobody, if anything scare them
Eleven, by the street code, outside of the screen doors
Where all the niggas sell pounds, next week riding in three lows
Carrying two hundred, not dollars, thousands
No time for restrooms, use the side of the houses
Bring a pack to big homie, sit down, let's count it
Aw there, go by something for your housing
Don't spend it up, live it up, somebody rob you, just give it up
Don't be selfish, appoint your niggas
Find something to split it up!

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Ain't even got to smoke to get faded
You ain't gotta drink to say you made it
Oh na na, second hand smoke
No I don't want no second hand smoke!
I ain't worried about you, I'm a do what I like
My niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life
Ain't fucking with that second hand smoke
Ain't no time for the second hand smoke

[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
Yeah, yeah, life's a second hand smoke, thoughts of being a criminal
Money needs, I should find a few girls and start pimping them
How should I ask, when I do will they handle it
Never mind, I go to jail like pimping and pondering, uh!
And I can’t do the pen unless it’s record deals
I made a hit at 18 and it’s the record still
Follow up, the real hits be bottled up!
Used to sneak soda in McDonald's cups
And still never got enough, huh!

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Ain't even got to smoke to get faded
You ain't gotta drink to say you made it
Oh na na, second hand smoke
No I don't want no second hand smoke!
I ain't worried about you, I'm a do what I like
My niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life
Ain't thinking with the second hand smoke
Ain't no time for the second hand smoke
Ain't even got to smoke to get faded
You ain't gotta drink to say you made it
Oh na na, second hand smoke
No I don't want no second hand smoke!
I ain't worried about you, I'm a do what I like
My niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life
Ain't thinking with the second hand smoke
Ain't no time for the second hand smoke
Na na na
