[Chorus: Trevor Jackson]
I'm not tryna pressure you
I'm just tryna get with you
Tell me what you doing later
Maybe I can fall through
First, I gotta know your name (your name)
First, I gotta know your name (your name)

[Verse 1: Trevor Jackson]
That's bae, that's bae
She don't know it yet, but that's bae
Tryna get it cut like a first aid
Feeling on the booty like I'm thirsty
Her man couldn't see me on my worst day
Her girls, Hatin' on me but they on me
Pulling up like what you on for the night
I know we young, but we grown for the night

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
I want you all in my system
You a good girl but we can be bad baby
You know I just tryna get you
I just wanna be the best that you had baby

[Chorus: Trevor Jackson]
I'm not tryna pressure you
I'm just tryna get with you
Tell me what you doing later
Maybe I can fall through
First, I gotta know your name (your name)
First, I gotta know your name (your name)

[Verse 2: Trevor Jackson]
Know we just meeting for the first time
But baby don't be scared 'cause I don't bite
Not unless you tell me that the ish you like
Mami, tell me what you got up for tonight
I'm really thinking me and you should get together
We ain't got to force it, we can do whatever
I'm hoping that you ain't got a man, yeah
I'm tryna take this to another level

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
I want you all in my system
You a good girl but we can be bad baby
You know I just tryna get you
I just wanna be the best that you had baby

[Chorus: Trevor Jackson]
I'm not tryna pressure you
I'm just tryna get with you
Tell me what you doing later
Maybe I can fall through
First, I gotta know your name (your name)
First, I gotta know your name (your name)

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
Man, you already know me
SAGE, yeah
I feel like all that other stuff out the window
Bring your fine ass overseas and buy everything in that window
You been on my mind, yeah my mental
Type to drive a nigga mental
Your ex is driving them rentals, yeah
Now why he treats you like a Honda?
Always driving you crazy, when really you're a Bentley
You don't take down payments
If wanting you is a crime, let me write down statements
Uh, let me get to know you
And have something to show for it
I plant a seed for the future, do something to grow towards it
And all the girls that call, I'll let you forward them

[Outro: Trevor Jackson]
First, I gotta know your name, your name
First, I gotta know your name, your name
I just wanna know your name
Can you tell me?
I wanna show you a few things
If you let me, but
First, I gotta know your name, oh yeah
I gotta know your name, ooh ooh
