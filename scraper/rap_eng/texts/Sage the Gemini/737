(Intro- Sage The Gemini)

Yeah you already know me S-A-G-E
Yeah we gon start it off right
Me and Sean Sahand rocking off white
Pull up and all the cars off white
Kick ya man to the left and its alright

Verse 1- Sean Sahand


LA or London I can take you all around the world right now
Passport just run it
Swag on airport might touchdown
And since we landed in the party
You the type of girl to get naughty
Girl you know we get sunk right now
Drink this up getting drunk right now

Chorus- Sean Sahand

Baby we could turn it up
I clear the rest of my day
We don't gotta be in love
Enjoy the ride Babe
Where you wanna go
Baby we could get it in
Cruise control
Come and ride me like a plane
Like I'm 737
Baby come and ride 737 like
Like I'm 737
Baby come and ride 737 like

Verse 2- Sage The Gemini

I know I don't call you like I say I should
But I'm glad you don't judge me by the cellular
But I promise to make you happy
I know you fine like wine from never valley
You da type I can drive to from far away
Drive back and still feel you from a far way
Got me listening to whatever my aunt say
She don't care about the fame
We do car days

Chorus- Sean Sahand

Baby we could turn it up
I clear the rest of my day
We don't gotta be in love
Enjoy the ride Babe
Where you wanna go
Baby we could get it in
Cruise control
Come and ride me like a plane
Like I'm 737
Baby come and ride 737 like
Like I'm 737
Baby come and ride 737 like

Verse 3- Sean Sahand

Money call up in hunnits
Must be good luck cause I'm up right now
Just grab what you want babe
Go and lit it up I'll show you how
When the light off its a movie
Ain't no telling what you do to me
Girl you know we get sunk right now
Drink this up getting drunk right now


Chorus- Sean Sahand

Baby we could turn it up
I clear the rest of my day
We don't gotta be in love
Enjoy the ride Babe
Where you wanna go
Baby we could get it in
Criuse control
Come and ride me like a plane
Like I'm 737
Baby come and ride 737 like
Like I'm 737
Baby come and ride 737 like

Chorus- Sean Sahand

Baby we could turn it up
