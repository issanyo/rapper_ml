[ Musical Interlude]

[Intro]
Uh...Yeah...

HBK yeay, you know how we play
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cardo...(produced by)

Right right right, uh

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Put my city on is my life's wish
Shotgun on the 1-0-1 as I write this
Bathing Ape and BBC'd up as I record this
Thinking back at the time I couldn't afford this
The lesson there is keep your focus
And keep your mouth shut because the loudest are the brokest
Don't trip off these this people their opinions don't make no sense
Even if they worked as a plumber, they wouldn't know shit
I don't like the term being slept on
Ain't no love in the bay, but obviously I'm making the exception
Learning life lessons of who to trust
Started relatively unknown then maneuvered up
Sitting in my bedroom plotting, watchin' never no options brought up
Run like hell until I caught up and then accelerate
From that put the pedal downward, exposing these lames in these clowns first
Uh, uh, yeah

[Hook: IamSu1 & P-Lo]
Quickly steppin my grind up
Lookin for some money, you're gonna find us yeah
And I'm sauced up, always bossed up
Paid like white folks, smoke like rastas
Uh, quickly steppin my grind up
Lookin for some money, you're gonna find us
Yeah I'm sauced up, always bossed up
Paid like white folks, smoke like rastas

[Verse 2: P-LO]
I've been that young rich Philipino
We'll be on the road stacking C-notes
Suzy my brother ain't no other shit we can agree on
Chain shining bright up in the club like a Neon
They be hatin, cus im young and getting it
I will never answer if they act talking dividends blowin' on strong
Couple freaks just to kick it with
Lot of rappers talking 'bout that life, but I'm living it
I got a bitch, but she don't even smoke
Nigga wet?, she gonna need a boat
Too much game, shorty coulda got lost in it
This ain't free, shorty now it's gonna cost a bit
Everything I have in my life, it was never given
We putting on for our city, that's the only mission
We iconic but we used to get laughed at
But we first to the mic, where you last at, huh

[Hook]
