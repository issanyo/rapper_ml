[Chorus]
It ain't even like that
When I leave, I'm coming right back
And sometimes she don't like that
I don't even fight back
All she want me to do is pay attention
'Cause we know young niggas don't listen
It ain't my fault, sometimes it's these bitches
When a young nigga on, they listen
They just love me for the shine and the glisten
But hey, I already know... (Ayy, uh)

[Verse 1]
When I pull up, niggas already hating
Women love me, it's like Paid in Full in the '80s
Only difference, Forgiatos, not Daytons
They want my money, they all like, "Fuck dating"
They're playing innocent until I catch 'em all, ayy
That's why the next girl never feeling low-key
That's why I grew up a damn soldier
And I ain't got no limits, thought I told ya

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I ride around, everything clean
Playing guapali? Closer to my dreams
Then it dawned on me, I'm a damn king
And when I get home, she gon' question me but

[Chorus]
It ain't even like that
When I leave, I'm coming right back
And sometimes she don't like that
I don't even fight back
All she want me to do is pay attention
'Cause we know young niggas don't listen
It ain't my fault, sometimes it's these bitches
When a young nigga on, they listen
They just love me for the shine and the glisten
But hey, I already know...

[Verse 2]
You ain't got to be so insecure (Okay)
'Cause losing you also my biggest fear (Okay)
You call me, you crying, I'm switching gears (Okay)
When I hit it, we shaking the chandelier (Hey)
Fuck these other hoes, they ain't shit, you don't hear me though (You don't)
I'd drop them all for you, you don't feel me though (You don't)
You more like Paul Martin's, they get Rubio's
When you call, I don't pick up, I'm at the studio

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I ride around, everything clean
Playing guapali? Closer to my dreams
Then it dawned on me, I'm a damn king
And when I get home, she gon' question me but

[Chorus]
It ain't even like that
When I leave, I'm coming right back
And sometimes she don't like that
I don't even fight back
All she want me to do is pay attention
'Cause we know young niggas don't listen
It ain't my fault, sometimes it's these bitches
When a young nigga on, they listen
They just love me for the shine and the glisten
But hey, I already know...

[Bridge]
Aww yeah!
Got your own car
Two jobs, work hard, you a bad broad
Aww yeah!
Got your own car
Two jobs, work hard, you a bad broad
Aww yeah!
Got your own car
Two jobs, work hard, you a bad broad
Aww yeah!
Got your own car
Two jobs, work hard, you a bad broad

[Chorus]
It ain't even like that
When I leave, I'm coming right back
And sometimes she don't like that
I don't even fight back
All she want me to do is pay attention
'Cause we know young niggas don't listen
It ain't my fault, sometimes it's these bitches
When a young nigga on, they listen
They just love me for the shine and the glisten
But hey, I already know, hey
