[Verse 1: E-40]
Ugh, cranberry and Ciroc, fucked up
See ya bitch choosin', turnt up
My niggas got the cookies, burn up
Pull up to the function in a Porsche truck
Water get to it, don't play games
Get in a bitch brain like a migraine
Beat the thing up and beat it out the frame
Legs spread open like a chicken wing (40!)

[Verse 2: Eric Statz]
Me and my niggas all up in the function, gettin' turnt up
Lot of bad bitches poppin' that ass, gettin' fucked up
Saw a bad bitch, had to get up on it
Had a couple friends smokin' on some marijuana
The way she poppin' that pussy, I think she really want it
You don't need a credit check, I'll be your lawyer

[Hook: Eric Statz]
Ay-oh! Poppin' that ass like you ain't had no dick in a long time
I'll show you what it feel like when I penetrate!
All up in the function, all my niggas fucked up
And shawty caught up in the moment cause she too turnt up
Penetrate (x4)

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
Uh, I step in this ho like "what's that about?"
You think this a game? I'mma wreck her out
She say that my ice look like Bow Wow
I said "practice, exceed, you go down South", uh!
I'm lookin' like ya girlfriend pimp
I do not walk with limp cause my new coupe a six
Speed, please, I cannot give you a ring
No marriage, I'm Kevin Ware, I do not get on my knee

[Hook]

[Verse 4: IamSu! & (Eric Statz)]
Back at it, never left, straight A with it, no F
Blowin' killin', I'm stressed, get it then make a mess
Then clean them jeans, make her knock, fiend (oh yeah-yeah)
Walk in regular, leave not neat (oh yeah-yeah)
Suzy 6 Speed gas on 'em, top speed
Gettin' green like broccoli, how could I not be
The one these ladies trippin' off? (oh yeah-yeah)
Mm, bet ya girl wanna get involved, come on!

[Hook]
