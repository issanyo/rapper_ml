[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Light and shade, light and shade
When did I get so afraid?
And I’m tryna find a silver lining
All I see is grey
Light and shade, light and shade
I’m just tryna find my way
Oh, sweet Jesus, I’m so tired
I need some help today

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Woke up this morning gotta thank God
Cause yesterday seemed kinda odd
I asked myself, like how you wake up tired?
Did your motivation expire? And are you even inspired?
Find me in places I don’t fit nor I don’t wanna be either
Used to be following, kicking the back of the leader
The world throw a [?] and I was always receiver
Got in the habit of being life’s golden retriever

[Pre-Chorus: Sage The Gemini]
Now we are the newest trend’s most wanted
But I am my kid’s most wanted
The devil is a salesman, I don’t want it
The devil is a salesman, I don’t want it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
In the mind’s jail with no bail
On the road, airplanes and hotels
And all this time to myself, got me thinking like
What if I was here by myself?
That’s what it seems like, social media make you lose life
You on your phone from sun up to the moonlight
And when you fed up, you finally put your head up
Achieve things you believe in, feel free when the [?]

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian]
I’m walking on my own
And I’m so far from home
And I’m tryna find the road that I should take
And though the sun is gone
Still I’m holding on
Cause I know it’s gonna shine for me again

The devil is a salesman, I don’t want it
Yea he’s a salesman, I don’t want it
The devil is a salesman, I don’t want it
Yea he’s a salesman, I don’t want it
