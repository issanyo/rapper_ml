[Intro: Sage the Gemini]
Dan's countin' all his fuckin' money

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
One time, for the low (for the low)
Two time, here we go (here we go)
Fuck her good, on the low (yeah, on the low)
And if it's good, do it once more (they get it, they get it)
In the suite hotel (tell)
My hoes don't tell (tell)
You hate, you fell (fell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I could tell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I noticed)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I could tell)
You hate, you fell (you fell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (shit)

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
I'm still goin' hard (hard)
Diamonds dancin' with the stars (damn)
And I love foreign cars (yup)
European, my garage (hey, hey)
One click, you a fraud (no)
I just want your bra (come here)
Take her home with me (yeah)
Make a round of applause (woo, woo)
All I know is money
I know she want to front me
I get her wet, Dasani
She still don't get it from me
Tellin' me she love me (no)
You don't even know me (woah)
She just wanna ride so I play genuine pony
I hop out the coupe, I got my shit straight (I got it straight, straight)
I see a new nigga handin' out his mixtape (woah)
She wanna feel entitled, I'm like "Bitch, wait" (hold on)
I kick you out quick, what's your release date? (hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
One time, for the low (for the low)
Two time, here we go (here we go)
Fuck her good, on the low (yeah, on the low)
And if it's good, do it once more (they get it, they get it)
In the suite hotel (tell)
My hoes don't tell (tell)
You hate, you fell (fell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I could tell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I noticed)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I could tell)
You hate, you fell (you fell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (shit)

[Verse 2: Show Banga]
Big suite hotel (hotel)
Peg doin' so well
Dan, they want me, Brodell (woah)
I keep movin' uphill
Pockets full of big bills
Eatin' good, big meals (woah)
Miles kissin', don't tell (mwah)
And they bustin' so well
I'ma big deal like O'Neal (ahh)
Squad only, that real (huh)
Fakes don't know how that feel (they don't)
We grind, you chill (we grind)
Steady movin', you still (skrt skrt)
Skrt skrt on weak hoes (skrt skrt)
Stackin' guap, Lord knows
Chased it all on that glow (that glow)
Pay Phil, 1-4 (oh)
That's enough of that, no (oh)
For this grisha GoPro (bro)
I'm a star, you know (you know)
Streets online like Migos
Fly niggas with egos
Stee should believe though (woah)
Hoes tryna find me like Nemo, ooh, ooh (yeah)

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
One time, for the low (for the low)
Two time, here we go (here we go)
Fuck her good, on the low (yeah, on the low)
And if it's good, do it once more (they get it, they get it)
In the suite hotel (tell)
My hoes don't tell (tell)
You hate, you fell (you fell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I could tell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I noticed)
Oh yeah, I could tell (I could tell)
You hate, you fell (you fell)
Oh yeah, I could tell (shit, damn)
