[Intro]
But the gag is that you don't know what you gon' know

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of my friends done warned me 'bout you
You the type of nigga hating on what I do
I pull up in Bentleys and the shoes 22
I'm like bitch, hop out wearing fucking Jimmy Choos

[Verse 1]
If I can avoid Uber, then I will
Unless it's for a girl that let me be like Mike Will
I'm swimming in this bitch like I got gills
It started with a picture, now she think it's not real

[Chorus]
Whoa, I be with my dogs every day
I think I'ma pull up on your broad today
He say I can't get up in her drawers, no way
But the gag is she ain't wore none anyway

[Post-Chorus]
(Rep, rep, rep, rep) Represent
(Rep, rep, rep, rep) Represent
(Rep, rep, rep, rep) Represent
(Rep, rep, rep, rep) Represent
But the gag is that you don't know what you gon' know
But the gag is that you don't know what you gon' know

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of my friends done warned me 'bout you
You the type of nigga hating on what I do
I pull up in Bentleys and the shoes 22
I'm like bitch, hop out wearing fucking Jimmy Choos

[Verse 2]
I feel like the motherfucking man
I'm always driving foreign but was taught in trans-ams
She knows me from MTV Jams
She the type you take home to your mom to meet the fam

[Chorus]
Whoa, I be with my dogs every day
I think I'ma pull up on your broad today
He say I can't get up in her drawers, no way
But the gag is she ain't wore none anyway

[Post-Chorus]
(Rep, rep, rep, rep) Represent
(Rep, rep, rep, rep) Represent
(Rep, rep, rep, rep) Represent
(Rep, rep, rep, rep) Represent
But the gag is that you don't know what you gon' know
But the gag is that you don't know what you gon' know

[Verse 3]
In front the club with the batting action
Tryna find what the hell we packing
But the gag is they got through the back
This here was just a distraction
Think we trouble, push the line backwards
Can't get in with our hats
One side, one straight, two snap
Fuck that, you know key is backwards
Bad dog, she let me hit it just 'cause my chain glisten
She say her man got one
But it shine for a sec, his chain all timid
You know we don't got the same cash
You know we don't got the same pass
Your girlfriend want a Roc-A-Fella
She seen the whip, you seen your dame dash
(Rep, rep, rep, rep)
