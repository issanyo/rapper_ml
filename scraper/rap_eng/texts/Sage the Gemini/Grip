[Chorus: Kent Jones & Sage the Gemini]
My baby say she got that grip tight
She got that grip, I got her dripping all night
She got that grip tight
She got that grip, I got her dripping all night
I might get the Balmain on you
It's so good, might put my name on you
You got that grip (Grip it, baby) tight (She grip it tight)
You got that grip (Grip it, baby)
Got you dripping all night

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goddamn, goddamn, I might see something
Grip good, grip good, I might clean something
Drop my girls an ATM, the rest don't mean nothing
Snatch they chains, they like
"Give it back 'cause it means something"
Drop top, roll with me, cruise, cruise, cruise
Might cop you a whip for good swimming, that's that carpool
Keep it quiet, you know other bitches hate
You don't talk much, but you got that Ricky Lake
I let you drive the whip, but you got your own shit
You so independent, you could flood your own wrists
She love a nigga who don't want her 'cause she spend
And I don't trip on who she with

[Chorus: Kent Jones & Sage the Gemini]
My baby say she got that grip tight
She got that grip, I got her dripping all night
She got that grip tight
She got that grip, I got her dripping all night
I might get the Balmain on you
It's so good, might put my name on you
You got that grip (Grip it, baby) tight (She grip it tight)
You got that grip (Grip it, baby)
Got you dripping all night

[Verse 2: Kent Jones]
I'm on call time, but ain't got time to call
My baby tried to walk before she tried to call
I think her name was Tyler, I told Tyler, "No"
And she know my head cold, that pussy diet
All I do is put my lips to hers, I call that dialogue
You still ain't good with all that effort, I don't try at all
You still be talking 'bout what you gon' do, I tried 'em all
Stiff at the end of the bed like you gon' die a log
She grip it, baby, yeah, she grip it tight
I called her my snow bunny and she gave me frostbite
You tripping, baby, won't pay your flight
My second single, bitch don't mind, it's alright

[Chorus: Kent Jones & Sage the Gemini]
My baby say she got that grip tight
She got that grip, I got her dripping all night
My baby say she got that grip tight
She got that grip, I got her dripping all night
I might get the Balmain on you
It's so good, might put my name on you
You got that grip (Grip it, baby) tight (She grip it tight)
You got that grip (Grip it, baby)
Got you dripping all night
