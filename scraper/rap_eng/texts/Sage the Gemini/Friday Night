[spoken intro]
[Verse 1: Teenear]
Tonight I'm doin' me
I can't do no better
My friends keep calling me
I'm down for whatever
Double-double clicking on my pictures
You thinking 'bout me
I ain't thinking 'bout you (nah nah)
I bet you mad that you let me go

[Pre-Chorus: Teenear]
Tell that new chick keep ya'
Swear I wouldn't wanna be her
I ain't mad I'm just lovin' myself
But you mad cause I really don't need ya'
Just know we're never
Getting back together
You can call, you can text
I ain't never gon' answer (ohhh no)

[Chorus: Teenear]
It's Friday night
And it's me you missin'
Ain't worried 'bout nun
'Bouta kick it with my friends
Bet you get jealous when you see me
Lookin' at my pictures on IG
It's Friday night
And it's me you missin'

[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
Okay, swag on a million
Now what he ain't finna do is tryna count my swag
Can't nobody count a million
Now what he ain't finna do is let you drive that coupe
I'm in the passenger chilling
Okay don't nobody do it quite just like me
He thirsty avi give that man 2 CC's
All these niggas tryna find you, you found me
I give you shoes with the bottom like a crime scene
Red bottoms, broke boys who cares about 'em?
Back to the house, doors closed i tell you out 'em ugh)
And if your man want beef for peep sakes
Make that phone call, let him know i sweep stakes
And give you those keys for keepsakes
What he won't do is let it go if we date!

[Chorus: Teenear]
It's Friday night
And it's me you missin'
Ain't worried 'bout nun
'Bouta kick it with my friends
Bet you get jealous when you see me
Lookin' at my pictures on IG
It's Friday night
And it's me you missin'

[Verse 2: Teenear]
I bet you wish that we were still together
You thought that I'd be weak
I'm doing better
I didn't fit into your picture
It was all about you
Wasn't worried 'bout me (nah nah)
And that's exactly what got you here (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Teenear]
Tell that new chick keep ya'
Swear I wouldn't wanna be her
I ain't mad I'm just lovin' myself
But you mad cause I really don't need ya'
Just know we're never
Getting back together
You can call, you can text
I ain't never gon' answer (ohhh no)

[Chorus: Teenear]
It's Friday night
And it's me you missin'
Ain't worried 'bout nun
'Bouta kick it with my friends
Bet you get jealous when you see me
Lookin' at my pictures on IG
It's Friday night
And it's me you missin'
Hey.......
