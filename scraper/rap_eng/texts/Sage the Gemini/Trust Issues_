[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It will be hard for me (give it)
To give you all of me (yeah, yeah)
You hold it down for me
You keep this crown for me, woah
Yeah, yeah and now usually, cause it's new to me
Why do you think I'm still here?
Oh but I got, Trust issues
Trust issues, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini & Chris Brown]
He can't love you, like I love you
He can't fuck you, like I fuck you
Whoever he is, can't handle you
No, spendin' money ain't a thing
I do it baby, on that Gucci purse
And them shoes....

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It will be hard for me (give it)
To give you all of me (yeah, yeah)
You hold it down for me
You keep this crown for me, woah
Yeah, yeah and now usually, cause it's new to me
Why do you think I'm still here?
Oh but I got, Trust issues
Trust issues, yeah, yeah
