[Iamsu]
Shawty it’s yo birthday, I got a earthy boot thing from Berkeley
And you the one of the winners, girl you in first place
And I’ll take you to dinner but don’t desert me
I’m with them heartbreak gangbangers like all day
In city Man The Flash what they call me
Huh, these rappers lousy
I’m at the car lot test drivin Audi’s
And I’mma do my thing if she let me
She 2 steppin, brand new Giuseppes
I’m like damn damn you look sexy
She like slow down, you can’t catch me
I told er something real sick and made her ass settle
I’m with my young nigga Sage he Mr Gas Pedal
And I’m a hustler, a grinder, the cash getter
But when it comes to this game I picks the last river

[Hook]

(P-lo)
Go Shawty, it’s yo birthday
Uh, I don’t really care though
Young Mac, I got spare hoes
Every time I’m with yo girl, she don’t wear clothes
She a freak bitch
Got caught up in the wave, now she sea sick
Then I get up in that pussy I go deep in
Uh, got a freaky Puerto Rican, only fuck you on the weekend
Better leave a pussy leakin uh
She don’t never say shit
Been mac’in since a youngin, this base shit
I don’t fuck with broke hoes, that’s basic
If she fuckin with me she bring the cake in
Turn around, I’mma hit it from the back
They bringin up my name, only talkin bout a Mac
Need about 10 K when they talkin bout the track
When they talkin bout today me ain’t worried bout that

[Hook]

(Sage The Gemini)
I got money, you don’t even know it
I be basketballin, you don’t joke, you know it yuh
I’m a movie, got the most scene showin
Set the vibe on the record and ho you ain’t even broke it yea
Gassin' like Texaco, border Mexico
Next to blow, next to go on the stage and blow a blab
I so wanted money go and treason
I’m inside up in it, I’mma share like a bunch of likes if that’s where I be set actin in jail
HBK the gang yea I rep though
And I don’t fuck wit you, that’s a step back
I’m flyin no plane, just a jetpack
I spit crackin like I run my wrists in knife sex
I gave it back like a refund yuh
Run to yo girl now let’s all rewind yea
It’s television if you own one yea
Bad hoes, yea, all the time yea

[Hook]
