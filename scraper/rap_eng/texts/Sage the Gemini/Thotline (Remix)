[Intro: Maurice Moore]
Shawty you can hit my...

[Verse 1: Maurice Moore]
Pack a bag cause we going on a trip
I hope Bianca your real name cause that's what I'm going with
Ahem, I can't believe you went so extreme
Looks like you already met the team
You know Capri you met Dimitrios
They all call you baby - no fetus
Tell the truth, tell the truth
Same as them you want me too, ah
I'ma tell the truth cause I do it how I do it, yeah
Tell the truth, tell the truth
Feeling blue without a clue
Don't go telling lies cause that shit just killed my mood (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Maurice Moore]
It's about time that you take my number baby
So if you ever need to reach me (yeah!)

[Chorus: Maurice Moore]
Shawty you can hit my thotline, thotline, thotline
Shawty you can hit my thotline, thotline, thotline
Yeah you hit my thotline when it go up
Every time I turn it up you be blowing me up
(Yeah, aye, and you already know me S-A-G-E)
Shawty you can hit my thotline, thotline, thotline
(Yeah, aye, aye, let's get it)

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
I'm tired of this telephone
Can only talk for so long
I'm tryna show you I can't tell a vision
Remote control you, turn you on
Why am I talkin' about TV's?
You got me actin' different
But if you was a TV you'd be the one with the back on it
And I'd be tryin' to put my plasma in it
Tell the truth, tell the truth
You know I think you edible
Lookin' like sweet nanus
Now you raisin' decibels
Smile for me right quick
You scrolled on, here to do it
Like that, like that
Goodness gracious I'ma lose it

[Pre-Chorus: Maurice Moore]
It's about time that your take my number baby
So if you ever need to reach me, reach me

[Chorus: Maurice Moore]
Shawty you can hit my thotline, thotline, thotline
Shawty you can hit my thotline, thotline, thotline
Yeah you hit my thotline when it go up
Every time I turn it on you be blowing me up
Shawty you can hit my thotline, thotline, thotline

[Outro: Maurice Moore]
See y'all, my word, I actually have the keys to a perfect summer
First off, what's the lottery lookin' like?
You can't start the season without draft picks
For real though, you gotta know who you gonna build the franchise around 'cause a team is only as strong as its weakest player
Secondly, be aware of that August trade deadline
Don't mess around with the team's chemistry over a sundress fam
My third and final key to a perfect summer:
Just go out there and have fun
