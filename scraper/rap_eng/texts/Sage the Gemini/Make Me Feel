[Intro]
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah (I'm that nigga)
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
All these bills, I just might spend on you
Spend it on you, yeah

[Chorus]
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Ayy, pussy so good, might have me slip up, ayy
Ayy, make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I might hit it from the back and take you shopping
Gucci, Louis, oh, you got options
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Git it from the back and turn my cash in
Red bottoms like I'm Michael Jackson
Few bands for your dress
Do they got your size 'cause it might just happen
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
All this ice on my arm, wrist, think it might snow today
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'ma put it on you cold, it's a night day in the ayy
But it's nighttime in this rose
Nighttime in my rose
Two tennis chains, is it hers, one gold, one rose
Ayy, if I get you the shoes, you might as well get the coat

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit it from the back just like that
Take you shopping, make you call
Spend a bag, spend a bag, ayy
And if I don't take you shopping, you don't nag, you don't nag
Got your arms, spend that bag, spend my bag

[Chorus]
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Ayy, pussy so good, might have me slip up, ayy
Ayy, make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I might hit it from the back and take you shopping
Gucci, Louis, oh, you got options
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Be careful, these diamonds are cold, ayy
Balenciaga, the toes, ayy
Your money spending on money
I can't blame you for not knowing, ayy
She think I'm sighing nigga
But that's how you supposed to make your side bitch feel
I buy her a fitch, she tell me you whine
Nigga, I'm like "side bitch, chill"
Ayy, no honey, ain't no room for you to act funny
Stop telling bitches that you feel special
We was ten toes, this is your money
Just bought a Benz with no money
I been on the road getting gold money
Spend it like I'm tryna get to know money
How you even get to spend my show money?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit it from the back just like that
Take you shopping, make you call
Spend a bag, spend a bag, ayy
And if I don't take you shopping, you don't nag, you don't nag
Got your arms, spend that bag, spend my bag

[Chorus]
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Ayy, pussy so good, might have me slip up, ayy
Ayy, make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I might hit it from the back and take you shopping
Gucci, Louis, oh, you got options
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah
Make me feel like I'm that nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah
