[Intro]
June on a beat, June on a beat

[Hook: Show Banga]
Huh, quit actin' like you don't know
(Quit actin' like you don't know)
Quit actin' like you don't know
(Quit actin' like you don't know)
Quit actin' like you don't know
Quit actin' like you don't know
Quit actin' like you don't know
I been that, I been that, I been that nigga (x3)
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
Huh

[Verse 1: Show Banga]

I been that nigga since way back
Sucka shit, homie I don't play that
Your girl at the crib, make her taste that
Swear it's my time, you better face that
Quit actin' like you don't know that I'm nice
These haters they wanna be me like Mike
Flows be colder than colder, no ice
Want you a shawty versus a suprise
Lights camera action, know I'm taxin'
I ain't gotta worry, I be just relaxin'
I don't wait around, gotta make it happen
I just love the money cause it's so attractive
No time for that play play
I need that on way pay
This year 'round it's way way
And I'm from that Bay Bay
If you hear my voice then you know it's gon' mean it

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
Uh, I feel like most of ya'll hate me
Fly nigga, ya'll can keep the skatin'
As gettin' older takin' bitches really nothin'
I said it cause I'm young
While she give the that filet mignon
Over the water, the money taught her
I'm with a problem, and you don't gotta solve her
I'm in the game committin' manslaughter
How many times I gotta say I ball before I can convince Carter?
Machine gun, no Kelly
You a fail
Shut up Felly
Just shop, stop lookin' at the price
Shot out Kelly, new telly every weekend
And I got the baddest girl, we don't need friends
Been that nigga, I ain't stoppin' now
I'm so nigga, buy pills and leave the Cottonelle
Hop off the jet and leave the pilot there
Ya'll visit and take Uber, while my pilot there

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Show Banga]
I'm way too Kool like my nigga John
I been a damn king, never won a prom
I'm that motherfucka, you can ask your mom
I always get played like a CD ROM
You ain't talkin' cash, homie leave me alone
Everyday damn day, fully, we be on
Haters starin' at me like the tv on
I come thru, rag and my deezy on
I feel way too flawless
Show busy, I call it, be ballin'
Floodin' the streets like New Orleans
I'm from the block but be tourin'
Bein' in one place is too borin'
Been that guy since a little guy
Boy I do it large, you a little fry
I'm the one, you the middle guy
Show Easy  bangin', you know I'm certified

[Hook]
