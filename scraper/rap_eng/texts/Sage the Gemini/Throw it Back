[Verse 1 : Marko Penn]
Wait, wait for a second
Is that you, tell me I'm trippin'
Booty got it's on universe
Mathematics girl, I wanna learn all your curves
Cash, I might just blow it
You've got a gift and you don't even know it
Don't even know it and I just can't believe it (belive it)


[Hook : Marko Penn]
Theres a reason, you got an ass like that
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Acting like you've never done this before
Girl you a liar
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
I want you girl
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back

[Verse 2 : Marko Penn]
Wait, this could be amazing
Lift it up, bust it open for me baby'
Both livin' in a moment
It's all yours, girl time for you to own it
Cash, I might just blow it
You've got tricks and you don't even know it
Don't even know it, but I really don't believe that shit


[Hook : Marko Penn]
Theres a reason, you got an ass like that
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Acting like you've never done this before

Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back

Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back



[Verse 3 : Sage The Gemino]
Yeah, get it wet, yeah, clean up on Isle five
And we gon' do the same next dal'
I know positions that should've been on X-Files
And we gon' get it going to the next dal
Ain't fuckin' with a nigga cause I'm cashed out
Now tell your ex man don't get x'ed out
Got this on the floor when I flash out
Knees on one but you're running to the next couch
I'm a mac like the [?] world
I keep it on the low, yeah I thought you heard
Driftin' it in the bed, how I grip them curves
See with an ass like that, I need a safety word
(Sage stop)



[Hook : Marko Penn]
Theres a reason, you got an ass like that
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Acting like you've never done this before
Girl you a liar
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
I want you girl
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
Go ahead and throw it back
