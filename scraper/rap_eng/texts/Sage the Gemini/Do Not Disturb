Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb
My phone on Do Not Disturb
My phone on Do Not Disturb
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb

[Verse 1]
Hop out the coupe like a bird, scratching my rims on the curb
They be like, "Hey, what's the word?"
I'm like, the bird is the word
I look like I'm the one serving, serving the fiends with a purpose
My Bentley looking like jewelry, I'mma hurt 'em
Wait, I am still tippin' like Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Slim Thugger
DMX, yeah, all my dogs, they are all for more mo' fucker
Whip on Forgi's, jeans like 4 Gs
My car got Wi-Fi, I don't need 4Gs
She say she want me, ay, I say she full of shit
She really want my green, but I only carry blue strips
Pull up to the front, you all know you gon' learn
Niggas know it's my turn
This how they flock on me, specially watching me

[Hook]
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb
My phone on Do Not Disturb
My phone on Do Not Disturb
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb
My phone on Do Not Disturb
My phone on Do Not Disturb
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb

[Verse 2]
I hop out the coupe, you complain I do the money dance
All I wanna do is put the cash in the rubber band
If I spend this shit, gon' put it in my other hand
In my other hand, yeah
Got a lot of commas, my posse 'round us
They gon' shoot 'til they last number
With 30 rounds, they just tryna round up
Money didn't change us, we just counted louder
I used to make seven bucks an hour
Me and bad bitches didn't get along
Now I ride around, heater stay on
I know it's summertime but my chains cold
Please don't hear my phone, please don't hear my phone
Please don't hear my phone, please don't hear my phone
Now you know I'm on, now you know I'm on
I thought you heard, my phone on Do Not Disturb
Watch me

[Hook]
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb
My phone on Do Not Disturb
My phone on Do Not Disturb
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
Hop out the coupe like a bird
My phone on Do Not Disturb

[Outro]
Hop out the couple like a bird
