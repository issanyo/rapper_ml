[Intro]
99 Percent

[Verse 1: 99 Percent]
Sunny day in LA, we was bumping Nelly
Had her at my crib, she was touching on my belly
Ignoring all my calls, not looking at my celly
Knock on the door, my girl gonna kill me

[Pre-Chorus: 99 Percent]
I blame it on the shape of that ass in that sundress
Blame it on the pic that she sent, she was undressed
Blame it on that IG she look just like Kylie
You've seen her for yourself, can't blame nothing on me

[Chorus: 99 Percent]
Caught me banging on the sofa (I'm sorry)
Had her singing in the shower (I'm sorry)
I thought that you was working (you home early)
Walked in when she was twerking (I'm so sorry)
Caught me banging on the sofa (I'm sorry)
Had her singing in the shower (I'm sorry)
I thought that you was working (you home early)
Walked in when she was twerking (I'm so sorry)

[Verse 2: 99 Percent]
Rainy day in Cali, got me bumping Drizzy
My girl said don't call, don't text, don't at me
She posted up a vid, told my homies and my family
Her mom just called, said she's gonna kill me

[Pre-Chorus: 99 Percent]
I blame it on the shape of that ass in that sundress
Blame it on the pic that she sent, she was undressed
Blame it on that IG she look just like Kylie
You've seen her for yourself, can't blame nothing on me

[Chorus: 99 Percent]
Caught me banging on the sofa (I'm sorry)
Had her singing in the shower (I'm sorry)
I thought that you was working (you home early)
Walked in when she was twerking (I'm so sorry)
Caught me banging on the sofa (I'm sorry)
Had her singing in the shower (I'm sorry)
I thought that you was working (you home early)
Walked in when she was twerking (I'm so sorry)

[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
Ayy, it's not what it look like (look like)
When she came in, I was asleep (I was asleep!)
It's not what it look like (look like)
I ain't even know she was a freak (yup!)
I ain't seen the tat on her left eye (no!)
I mean, I ain't even get to see her left eye, wait
I don't even know she had a left eye?
She just needed TLC like left eye
And she serenaded me with the best lines
You know I can't even front with that behind
You know dogs always chasing a feline
Look honey shoulda' never took the beehive
Thinking to myself like it's working isn't it
My girl like, "Boy, you must be kidding me"
Oh, my hand is still on her butt isn't it
Damn

[Chorus: 99 Percent]
Caught me banging on the sofa (I'm sorry)
Had her singing in the shower (I'm sorry)
I thought that you was working (you home early)
Walked in when she was twerking (I'm so sorry)
Caught me banging on the sofa (I'm sorry)
Had her singing in the shower (I'm sorry)
I thought that you was working (you home early)
Walked in when she was twerking (I'm so sorry)

[Outro]
