[Intro]
H-h-h-holy shhh

[Chorus]
All the clips never fit the gun
I pull up, you know what's goin' on
Let my dogs loose off the chains
Oh Lord, here we go again

[Verse]
Pull up all in all red like Larry the Lobster
Fuck up your posture with this inuyasha
Yeah, I just wanna make money and spend flame
You're a Dragonballs and gold cooler than I came
Okay, Westside ma', fingers rest up, Jack
Wheels 'pposed to get billings, ride 'em both back to back
Man, it's real complicated
Can't believe that I made it
You know the big homie stretch, but me, I'm from the pavement
Owe that nigga my loyalty, rags to fuckin' royalty
Platinum records, I'ma buy him a house off of the royalties, woo
And fuck 'em all, get rich
You fuckin' up the plan, you a bitch
GGT

[Chorus]
All the clips never fit the gun
I pull up, you know what's goin' on
Let my dogs loose off the chains
Oh Lord, here we go again

[Outro]
Let my dogs loose off the chains
Oh Lord, here we go again
