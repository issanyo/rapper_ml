P-P-P-Lo, time to bring the bass back

[Verse 1]
Got a call on my cell phone
Heard you in the 5-1-0

L.A. face with a Oakland booty
So you know that's fat
I try to get the number, she like catch me outside
I'm like "how 'bout dat"
Party at the hotel
Things seem to be goin' well
Walking past money on the floor
Please don't go

I know you want me, but you're indecisive

I know you want me, but you're indecisive
Head in the clouds, you captain, I'll be pilot

Walking past money on the floor
Please don't go

[Chorus]
I know you want me, but you're indecisive
Head in the clouds, you captain, I'll be pilot
I know you want me, but you're indecisive
Head in the clouds, you captain, I'll be pilot
