[Chorus]
I know that you, you want it
Tell me how you, you want it
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
In my drop-top backseat
She don't want it from nobody but me
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you

[Post-Chorus]
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one

[Verse 1]
Hands up, put your hands up
I like your face down with your ass up, yeah, your ass up
I'm in love with a stripper, better put my cash up
Came back from a private dance, they like, "You ain't last long"
Let me know, yeah, girl, let me know if you wanna go
Forgiatos under Bentley coupes, those my friends and all
Crazy bucks, I make crazy bucks, ain't that all you want?
You can't like me for my thoughts, foreign cars is all you saw

[Chorus]
I know that you, you want it
Tell me how you, you want it
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
In my drop-top backseat
She don't want it from nobody but me
Because I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you

[Post-Chorus]
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one

[Verse 2]
Why she wanna start pursuing me?
I look like a opportunity
Diamonds look like a community
Mansions and gated communities
Young men don't like how I stare at you
Walk in this bitch just to tear it up
She tryna find out my scent, I smell like Bank of America
I pull up putting the top down
Fuck I look like turning top down
I am balling, pass the rock down
I am balling, pass the rock down
This the only aisle I walk down when I'm married to the game
Gimme money, keep the fame, you should stay in your lane

[Chorus]
I know that you, you want it
Tell me how you, you want it
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
In my drop-top backseat
She don't want it from nobody but me
Because I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you, I'ma give it to you

[Post-Chorus]
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one
All this time I knew you was the one
