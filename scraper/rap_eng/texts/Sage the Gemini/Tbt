[Hook x2: Kool John]
I see you shaking come and put it on my lap
Bend it over look back look back
TBT, this bitch threw it back
Look back look back throw it back

[Verse 1: Kool John]
I need a blunt and a bad bitch
With an ass so big it stop traffic
And she threw it at a nigga I got access
I took her back to the house and let her have it
One hand on my blunt, the other hand on her booty
I be hitting  from the back, and I play with the coochie
I ain't talking Toy Story when I say I got woody
I fucked a nigga bitch and he saying "How could he?"
I ain't from Houston but I rap a lot
No luggage but my bitch say I pack a lot
HBK we the hottest in America
I'm in a fast whip looking like a miracle
She gave me butt and head, no Beavis
I done walked through, looking like the cleanest
She threw it back and she asked for some penis
Bitch this dick ain't free what you mean bitch, bitch!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
Make that ass jump so I know it's real
Pull out the steel, she don't duck, I give her a bill
Tell her don't say shit just like dada
No squares, no hopscotch
In her mouth like pop rocks
Knock knock who is it, it ain't Chamillion
Air, no hair, Nair having good civilian
I'm chilling, saying anything but
Forgive me this beat is mainey and it's hypey as fuck
I'm going dumb, make the opposite shake tail til it's numb
Now let me find out you a bum
Think your girlfriend chew me like Bubble Yum
Take ahold of her check she don't pay me in gum
Yuh, look back like you ain't ready for future
Kama sutra I'ma beat it, beat it I'm your producer
Seducer include the ruler, large meat in your throat
Make that ass sound like three cars in your spokes, huh

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Show Banga]
Look back look back throw it back huh
Let a Shmop boy hit it blow your back huh
I go round in that kitty run a lap huh
That nigga that you with he can't do jack huh
We'll come and party with a party animal
Eat that thing alive like I'm Hannibal
And I like it sweet like a cantaloupe
I got that good good it's that antidote
Tell her switch it up i give it up man they cannot get rid of us
In the thing like it's ten of us got the hoes like owow
Running shit like a principal bounce that ass for these winners girl
Might just throw you some figures girl let me see you
Slow down, and grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
I'ma hit it, then pass it off
Cuff a trick, never me, or nah
