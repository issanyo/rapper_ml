[Hook]
Real nigga with this shit
Every bitch here wanna suck my dick (hell yeah)
And the niggas wanna fuck my bitch
They be saying "That motherfucker there, that's a badd motherfucker"
Badd, that motherfucker there, that's a bad motherfucker
Badd, that motherfucker there, that's a bad motherfucker
Hell yeah, bad motherfucker, hell yeah
Hell yeah, bad motherfucker, hell yeah, badd

[Verse 1: Sage]
Uhhhhh, I heard you was looking for me
Well, you found me biotch
Talking shit i'll take your girlfriend home
Slap my nigga on the hand and tell my nigga "let's swiotch"
Pretty nigga, bad boy no P. Diddy
Got a problem, got a piece that'll free cities (badd)
If you ain't starve with me you don't eat with me
Niggas always buggin' only real niggas leave with me, ugh
On the mob it's a job, once a rot now i'm hot
I'm on top, boy i'm wet, where the mop? You a knock
Knock-knock door locked
Bitch you ain't coming in if a girl coming out it

[Hook]

[Bridge: Milla]
Hello, hello, hello
Where you at?
How you on it if your name ain't in it?
How you winning if your game ain't in it?
Send a message with your name straight in it
Cause a message ain't a message if Sage ain't in it

[Verse 2: Sage]
I'm with my brother Smoovy looking like a movie
Couple dimes tryna' do me and they don't know me (badd)
They listen to my tunes and they go loony
Start going ape-shit like they stole a zoo key
On the mob it's a job, once a rot now i'm hot
I'm on top, boy i'm wet, where the mop? You a knock
Knock-knock door locked
Bitch you ain't coming in if a girl coming out it
