[Intro: Sage the Gemini]
Bet you can't do it like me, no
Bet you can't do it like me, no

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
Women, money, I be on it
You ain't like me, I'm just honest
Park the Bentley, then I locked it
Hell, I thought I was bein' modest

[Pre-Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
I'm a rebel, I don't settle
You ain't on my level, bass and treble
Hit the gas, you pedal
My next soul metal is
Came with diamonds, shinin' yellow, ayy

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini & Kelis]
I bet you can't do it like me, no
I bet you can't do it overseas
Take your girl then do it OG
I bet you can't do it like me
I bet you can't do it like me, no
I bet you can't do it overseas
Take your man and do it OG
I bet you can't do it like me

[Drop: TCTS]

[Post-Chorus: Kelis]
Icy feet
Icy feet
Icy feet
Icy feet
Icy feet

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
Ayy, throwin' money like a cannon
Foreign ladies, got 'em faintin'
Pull up in a Bentley Phantom
Swingin' lane to lane like I'm faintin'

[Pre-Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
I'm a rebel, I don't settle
You ain't on my level, bass and treble
Hit the gas, you pedal
My next soul metal is
Came with diamonds, shinin' yellow, ayy

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini & Kelis]
I bet you can't do it like me, no
I bet you can't do it overseas
Take your girl then do it OG
I bet you can't do it like me
I bet you can't do it like me, no
I bet you can't do it overseas
Take your man and do it OG
I bet you can't do it like me

[Bridge: Kelis]
Alright, I'm going out tonight, baby
Looking right, can't wait to get inside, baby
It's alright, I'm 'bout to catch a vibe
Now get us inside, dancing all night, baby

[Drop: TCTS]

[Post-Chorus: Kelis]
Icy feet
Icy feet
Icy feet
Icy feet
Icy feet

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini & Kelis]
I bet you can't do it like me, no
I bet you can't do it overseas
Take your girl then do it OG
I bet you can't do it like me
I bet you can't do it like me, no
I bet you can't do it overseas
Take your man and do it OG
I bet you can't do it like me
I bet you can't do it like me, no
I bet you can't do it overseas
Take your girl then do it OG
I bet you can't do it like me
I bet you can't do it like me, no
I bet you can't do it overseas
Take your man and do it OG
I bet you can't do it like me

[Post-Chorus: Kelis]
Icy feet
Icy feet
Icy feet
Icy feet
