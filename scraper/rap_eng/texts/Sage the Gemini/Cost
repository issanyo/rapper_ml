Notice ain't no new phone, I just did not save your number
Plus, I just got a new ho and her brain keep getting dumber
I don't need your kudos, I'ma take over the summer
I hit up Sage, and he got the play
I'm tryna get paid, 'cause we on the same page
And I've been up for five days tryna get deposit
And for that love like dage, I go Bobby Boujee
My jury cost (cost)
My time it cost (cost cost)
Your career washed (washed washed)
You might as well hush (you might as well hush)
Tell 'em what it hang, I'm just sayin'
This ain't Hanes, it just sane
I just left out a blue flame just to get some chicken wing (yeah yeah)
