[Intro]
(It's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
I-I-I want it)
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
Right now!

[Verse 1]
I'm turnt up in this bitch
Drunk off that liquor
I can't trust these hoes
But you look so different girl
You... You got your girls, I got my niggas
So you... should tell yo girls to come fuck with us

[Pre-Hook]
Come live in the fast lane
Bottles every night, whatever you like
Coz I do things
And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side
Coz a nigga wanna act strange
But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you
And I ain't just running game
I ain't running game

[Hook]
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl
H-H-Hop on this girl
I know you're horny girl
I-I-I want it girl
I want it girl
Said it's 2AM
I-I-I want it girl

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
Yeah, neck frozen, wrist too
They ain't never seen a California igloo
My dude, on the magazine, for the issue
You better off tryin' to kick it like jujitsu
Its 2AM and I'm tryin' to get in there
Say "X marks the spot"
But your ex not in here
My momma, I ain't for the drama
From the seb, no beef, we're just tryna' get the commas

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My niggas pull off in this whip
Full speed to my after-hours
Take a couple more sips
Girl you know I'll be good for hours
You, you say it's real and I can feel on it - ah
You know the deal, we in the moment

[Pre-Hook]
