Tell 'em drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop, drop, drop
Dr-drop 'em
Drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop, drop, drop
Dr-drop 'em, see

I can see the college niggas stepping to this
I can see the college girls stepping to this
(x2)

[Verse 1 - Sage the Gemini]
She came through stunting, red-hair ruckus
And she don't do the black, I thank her Uncle Ruckus
She got hella back and she don't get her friend
She love attention, thirsty niggas always in the sun
She hold up that sign to let a nigga know
She don't do broke -- rich niggas, new coach
She just make a phone call and get some new dough
(BRRR-BRRR)
Bitch nigga, that's new clothes!
Sneak in a girl dorm, hide in her clothes
She from the step team, you know I'm into those
Workout booty, yeah, there ain't nothing silicone
Give her the vitamins, but she don't get minerals
All my niggas stepping, repping fraternities
All my girls stepping, repping sororities
Tell that girl you don't rep more than me
Tell that nigga you don't rep more than me!

[Verse 2 - Kool John]
(BEH BEH BEH)
Beat it like the drummer, man
West Side, The $hmop, where's the turn-up, man?
Pulled her to the party, got her quaking on me
$hmop Boy, bitch, I'm into money-makin'
And I need a gold trophy, however you playing this
Nigga, I ain't the fakin' bitch
Keep my chain, swing a bitch
You ain't tryna bone, you in the friend zone
I'mma get gone, skrrt, and move yo ass along, uh
And my people here, escort me to the front
Security ain't gon' do shit when I light my blunt
I be sipping bubbly, yeah
All these bitches love me, yeah
I hit it from the back, give her booty chubby
And it's c'mon, boo, you gotta suck before you fuck me, yeah
I'm a star, bitch
You lucky if you fuck me
If this one 7-inch nigga would be groovy, bitch
Get wang, girl, see if you with the boosie shit
