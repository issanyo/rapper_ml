[Verse 1]
Girl, you dance like you're bi-lingual
Little 'bout me, now I'm single
Really go and makin' that spot tingle
Girl, turn the heat up for me
You know you a real bad one, uno
Biggest booty in this club, kudos
Came in with the crew, 'bout to leave (with you though)
Girl, turn the heat up for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sixty-seven outside
It's got a switch to hit the low ride (hey)
So we can bounce until the sunrise (woah)
I wanna see your craziest side (hey)

[Chorus]
Let me watchachacha
Let me watchachacha
Let me watchachacha
Watch you drop it down south for the bulla, baby
Let me watchachacha (ven aquí, ven aquí)
Let me watchachacha (come to me, come to me)
Let me watchachacha (let me see, let me see)
Watch you drop it down south for the bulla, baby

[Verse 2]
Watchu doin' after, let's all meet up
Let me get your number before I leave ya
Girl, you hot like July, I need ya
Girl, turn the heat up for me
Got me watchin' you like I'm watchin' cable
Get you to the room and you don't mind, girl Raina
Droppin' rose petals and lightin' candles
Girl, turn the heat up for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sixty-seven outside
It's got a switch to hit the low ride
So we can bounce until the sunrise
I wanna see your craziest side

[Chorus]
Let me watchachacha
Let me watchachacha
Let me watchachacha
Watch you drop it down south for the bulla, baby
Let me watchachacha (ven aquí, ven aquí)
Let me watchachacha (come to me, come to me)
Let me watchachacha (let me see, let me see)
Watch you drop it down south for the bulla, baby

[Verse 3]
Ven aquí, por favor
Mi amor, dame peso, give me more, give me more, yeah (woah)
Your friend's knockin' at the window (at the window)
I say "Uno momento" (momento)
I can't fake it 'til I make it (no)
I got a room and the sign say vacant (yup)
If you give it to me, I'ma take it (yup)
Treat you like my fears, I'ma face it (hey)

[Chorus]
Let me watchachacha
Let me watchachacha
Let me watchachacha
Watch you drop it down south for the bulla, baby
Let me watchachacha (ven aquí, ven aquí)
Let me watchachacha (come to me, come to me)
Let me watchachacha (let me see, let me see)
Watch you drop it down south for the bulla, baby
