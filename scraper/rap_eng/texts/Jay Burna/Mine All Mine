Verse 1 - Jay Burna


I was like ay momma whoa now
She always wanna roll out
Got me on this potion
Always stuck when she go down
She Mine all Mine
I hit the lotto
She so wet
I need goggles
It’s magic when I’m with her
Feeling like a wizard
Drop top in the city
And the titties come with it
Treat her like a princess
Work her like fitness
So god damn fine
Can I get a witness

Chorus - A. Star

Yeah you know She bad
Yeah you she know fine
Yeah she came with me
Nah don’t waste your time
Yeah you know she bad
So bad you got to stare
But she coming to krib with me

Cause that putty cat mine all mine

Verse 2 - Jay Burna

You a diamond in the rough
I’m a let it shine
Yeah I hit my gold mine
One in a million
She oh so fine
Like top models
My fast car

Body so cold
That’s why I chill with her
Dynamite love
We have good times
She drunk off my love
I’m like moon shine
