Chorus

I been waiting for so long
We been feeling so wrong
Now the game is so strong
And we on we on
Welcome to my Paradise
Staring in your beautiful eyes
She rolling like a pair of dice
And we we on

Verse 1

The game is so mental
Its so far from simple
This fresh off the temple
Cause every line I rhyme
Remind me of the grind
Tryna chill with the Lakers
And live life like the bakers
Getting to the bread
No stopping
Getting cheese like a topping
Failing not a option
Selling tix like Boston
In my Red Sox
With a red dot
Aiming for the top
Like who you know fresher than Burna
Riddle me that
Getting high while I'm killing the raps
I been had the strap
When we was running the trap
Sixteen with sixteens
Little kid with big dreams
The theme is to stack cream
So I snuck on the scene
With these stacks in my jeans

Chorus

I been waiting for so long
We been feeling so wrong
Now the game is so strong
And we on we on
Welcome to my Paradise
Staring in your beautiful eyes
She rolling like a pair of dice
And we we on

Verse 2

Them Porches got horses
My Benz is still tinted
My life is still gifed
Grinding like fitness
You now get to witness
Greatness at it finest
We came to change the climate
Music bigger than riots
Flights with two pilots
And they still private
I light it
I write it
To get the world so excited
Black kings black kings
Make room for Black Congress
Loyalty royalty respect
The new black kings

I light it
I write it
To get the world so excited
Black kings black kings
Make room for Black Congress
Loyalty royalty respect
The new black kings

Chorus

I been waiting for so long
We been feeling so wrong
Now the game is so strong
And we on we on
Welcome to my Paradise
Staring in your beautiful eyes
She rolling like a pair of dice
And we we on
