Get this feeling

Yeah yeah


In the club with my cup
I ain't seeing so clear
Cause I'm buzz
It's plenty women in here I wanna fuck
Man even your bih
That's my mood
Nobody can't tell me nothing
I'm balling like a athlete
That's my mood
I'm bout to blow my rent
Who cares
What they say
That's my mood
Soon as I walk in the building
I'm hurting feelings
Thats my mood
Middle Fingers up
Who cares
What they say
That's my mood


Nigga that's my mood
We standing on the couch
Screaming
Like fuck ya crew
Bitches think I got a attitude
But I ain't tripping on ya
Baby that's my mood
Oooooh ha
I got a hookah and hoe right mow
Look at my shoooes
I got my black eleven js right now

Roll roll roll your blunt
Take a puff of weed
Da fuck
You ain't put in on this
Nigga tell that bitch to have a seat
Do that pussy like el chapo
Baby Let's get missing
So many hoes up in here
Bitch You  won the competition

Drive you home
When we finish
If You lucky baby
You gon be shopping up in Lennox
That's my mood

In the club with my cup
I ain't seeing so clear
Cause I'm buzz
It's plenty women in here I wanna fuck
Man even your bih
That's my mood
Nobody can't tell me nothing

That's my mood
I'm bout to blow my rent
Who cares
What they say
That's my mood
Soon as I walk in the building
I'm hurting feelings
Thats my mood
Middle Fingers up
Who cares
What they say
That's my mood



Bouncing around the room
With a bottle
Looking for a model that's gon swallow
Aayyaya
I can get you wetter than regattas
Aqua Fina out the shower
That's whole lotta water
I'm the man
You can tell it
How they yell it
12 plays like
R kelly
Tryna get up in your belly
High grade in my swisha
Milking your frame
Say cheese and take a picture
Yeah yeah yeah


Roll roll roll your blunt
Take a puff of weed
Da fuck
You ain't put in on this
Nigga tell that bitch to have a seat
Do that pussy like el chapo
Baby Let's get missing
