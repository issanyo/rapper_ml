[Chorus]

I'm gon' keep it player
I'm gon' change the game
Ladies gon' say my name
Fellas gon' stack that change
You can't count me out
Cause I go  I go in
No you can't count me out
Cause I go I go in
I go in

[ Verse 1: Jay Burna]

I can't front
I'm back on the strip with that thing on the hip
The beast is back
My hustle is grand
Like I'm riding with tip
That Houston sound
We screwed off that Og
Its still more to flip
Like who in town
Burna the king
And I'm chasing my dreams
I'm wu tang down
I'm chasing this cream
Like cookies and things
She wetting the ring
And still came to sing
I let the bell ring
Oh you wanna' minaj
I'm bringing more girls
I'm just doing job
And I'm rocking your world

[ Chorus]

I'm gon' keep it player
I'm gon' change the game
Ladies gon' say my name
Fellas gon' stack that change
You can't count me out
Cause I go  I go in
I go in
No you can't count me out
Cause I go I go in
I go in
I'm gon' keep it player
I'm gon' change the game
Ladies gon' say my name
Fellas gon' stack that change
You can't count me out
Cause I go  I go in
I go in
No you can't count me out
Cause I go I go in
I go in

[ Verse 2: Jay Burna]

I came with 2 phones
Separate For family and business
If I'm coming for you
Just know that Your turn is now finish
We hearing the records
They coming up missing
Your lies is not sticking
Your time is now clicking
The movie we making
Now Come get your tickets
Travolta in grease
Black jackets and jeans with no crease
I came with the army
I'm repping BC
I'm out of your league
Respect the code
It's locked by a G
The suspect is me
The subject is grind
My homework is done
I'm planting my seeds

[ Chorus]

I'm gon' keep it player
I'm gon' change the game
Ladies gon' say my name
Fellas gon' stack that change
You can't count me out
Cause I go  I go in
I go in
No you can't count me out
Cause I go I go in
I go in
I'm gon' keep it player
I'm gon' change the game
Ladies gon' say my name
Fellas gon' stack that change
You can't count me out
Cause I go  I go in
No you can't count me out
Cause I go I go in
I go in

[Bridge]

Late nights in ATL
You can't tell me nothing
Can't tell me nothing
She dancing for real
You can't tell her nothing
Can't tell her nothing
Me & C note putting on
You can't tell me nothing
Can't tell me nothing
Late nights in ATL
You can't tell me nothing
Can't tell me nothing

[ Chorus]

I'm gon' keep it player
I'm gon' change the game
Ladies gon' say my name
Fellas gon' stack that change
You can't count me out
Cause I go  I go in
No you can't count me out
Cause I go I go in
I go in
I'm gon' keep it player
I'm gon' change the game
Ladies gon' say my name
Fellas gon' stack that change
You can't count me out
Cause I go  I go in
No you can't count me out
Cause I go I go in
I go in
