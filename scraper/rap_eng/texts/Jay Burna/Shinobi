Sipping sake like

(Hook: Ali Coyote)
Feel like superman, OMG
God damn, look at me
I'm in my zone, I'm with my team
Dressed in all black like Shinobi
I might fuck that bitch cause she sexy (yeah)
Shawty bussed it open when she met me (yeah)
In my zone, In my zone
In my zone, In my zone

(Verse 1: Maine Event)
Pull up in all black attire
Tell them bring them hoes out my niggas on fire
Deep like the army my niggas all riders
Who else getting this shit jumping besides us
Mobb deep like we from Queens
We nah run from bwoy, them bwoy deh know we run tings
Y'all gon fuck around and make this shit easy for me
Don't see none of yall niggas all we see is money
Quarterback in the field the way I scramble
Your bitch got that mm mmm good like she Campbell
She with the clique getting lit, scented candles
She let me ride her hump like she a camel
Shake something like AI with the handles
Feeling like there ain't nothing that I can't do
Speak to me as you speaking to a god
Like this beat all I know is go hard, yah

(Bridge: Ali Coyote)
2 bottles of patron
Got me in my zone
What I'm smoking on strong
Pack loud, King Kong
Little momma ass
Baby girl do you dance
I'll be gone in the morning
So tonight make it last

(Verse 2: Jay Burna)
I'm like LeAnn and Busta with the rhymes
Run up with bags like I was shopping in line
While you clocking my time, my dockers got thousands that climb
Steaks high like I'm all in my prime
My Karrueche realer than half you fuck niggas
My extendo pull in just like a truck nigga
I stay there and chill but fuck trump nigga
No Hov on the plane, ya jigs up nigga
The king in the flesh, you better pray or sneeze bless
God body the high topic, bout to head out to foreign tropics
No time for politics, I hate the fake shit
Nobody can take splits unless she bows on the dick
Now that's olympics
I got points on the board, I'm so offensive
I'm like green lantern, keep the green
Dressed in all black like the omen
