(1st verse )

Got my top down
Radio on
And they playing my song
Cruising through the city
Feeling like diddy
So I'm about to go hard
What you mean
What you love
What you see
Can't get enough
Oooowee
The hustle been the lane for a nigga
They still pop thangs for a nigga
Whips still tinted
And it ain't rented
A nigga really winning
The crib on fie
Foreign my ride
Bad bi**h on my side
Yeah I'm living that life
Shawty wanna put a nigga on the ring tone
She say wanna go and bring the kid home
Bump and grind is her theme song
And I wanna sing along
But I gotta get my g on
All my gs throwing b's up
Gd up
From the feet up
Benihana
With a Mona Lisa
We get it on
Every time I see her
Need her
Ahahaha
Long hair don't care
And Her body so rare
When we out
Everybody wan stare
Play the game
Cause it ain't fair

Yeah yeah yeah

(Bridge )

It's seven o'clock on the dot
I got my drop top
Cruisin the streets
I got a pretty little thang
Uptown just waiting for me

(Chorus )

I got money on the floor
I got money on these hoes
X4

Are you ready
Tell me are ready
Tell me are you ready girl
Are you ready
Tell me are you ready
Tell me are you ready girl
Are you ready
Tell me are you are ready
Tell me are you ready girl
Are your ready
Tell me are you ready girl
Tell me are you ready girl
Are you ready

(2nd verse)
Lights off
Still kept my nikes
The right song
Make her take her tights off
Short breath
Loving all night long
She wild
Till I hit her with the python
Caress her body as she climb on
The pressure of her life
Made her a diamond
Rhyming
Got her blowing up my iPhone
Boom
Smoke in the room
We on
We see the sunrise
But we been sexing since the moon though
To some Marvin Gaye tunes
Make her fold up
When she get the vacuum
Set off the Westin
With out a question
And she say the pussy mine
Ahaa
And I know she lying
Ahaa
Every time I come around
She wanna dance for a nigga like me
Every time I lay it down
Spend the night with a nigga like me
Every time I show her round
She got dreams of being being wifey
Yeah yeah yeah

It's seven o'clock on the dot
I got my drop top
Cruisin the streets
I got a pretty little thang
Uptown just waiting for me

Chorus

Are you ready
Tell me are ready
Tell me are you ready girl
Are you ready
Tell me are you ready
Tell me are you ready girl
Are you ready
Tell me are you are ready
Tell me are you ready girl
Are your ready
Tell me are you ready girl
Tell me are you ready girl
Are you ready
