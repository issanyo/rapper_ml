[Verse One: E Devious]
Straight up out the backyard of Hell, I'm coming through
Leaving floods of blood, no clue but the residue
Ain't nothing new I keeps One In The Chamber
(Why?)
They said the R was a Clear And Present Danger
Non stop (pop pop)
They wanna stop (hold up)
You tried to roll up
And got your fat mouth stole up
Another chapter in the math that's after
When provoked, we gon' do what we have to
E the arsonist with the gas and a lighter
It won't be long before I burn me a writer
I stalking in the dark with the (flash, waiting for Satan
So we can start the reincarnating)
The mack devil
Be the soul that'll deviant
Mad mischievous, you best believe me it's
Only one way out, surrounded by fire
And barb wire
And straits that's dire
Cursed with a brain Fahrenheit 212 degrees
I can't chill, my mind's too hot to freeze

[Hook: E Devious]
You never know when the shell got your name on it
Who's getting fame on it, who got the claim on it
The ambush is gonna shoot ya down
And we ain't scared to handle beef on neutral ground

[E Devious]
Word
You ain't falling
You already fell down
Suit up kid, for what you're did you're going hellbound

[Hook]
You never know when the shell's got your name on it
Who's getting fame on it, who got the claim on it
The ambush is gonna shoot ya down
And we ain't scared to handle beef on neutral ground
You won't know when the scope got your head on it
Hollow point lead on it with the infrared on it
The R.S.O.'s spreading [?] around
Bodies are found cause we be living hellbound

[Verse Two: Tony Rhome]
Still fed up
I'm going head up with my conscious
I'm finding myself in the situation too often
Pockets are low and I know one way to fill them again
Drug dealing again
Hook up with Smiles and start illing again
It's fair to say I got this feeling again
So I'ma set up shop when I wake up I be breaking up rock in 'em
Reading to make a killing in front of this girl's crib
As I flip from one o.z. to two o.z. for the same price
I'm getting 63, it's no mystery
Things don't really change from the things I used to see
Ain't trying to be no big time hustler
Plus the, cops got many snitches, leary suckers turn to busters
So how long will it last or past
Sure mean nothing last forever
However
The Rhome is much more clever
So whenever it goes down I won't sweat it cause I found
I'm hellbound

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Benzino]
Yo give me the strap so I can let this little punk know
He's gonna die cause he tried to fuck the R.S.O
I'm getting fed up with these suckers always fronting like they're real
Showing off in front of their boys because they got a record deal
So what you gonna say with a mouth full of Glock?
The Most Beautifulest Thing is your ass in a wooden box
I guess you just don't understand what we're going through
Or what we've been through
So now we getting you

[Mad Lion]

[Benzino]
Ayo Big Hurse I need a blintz so I can ease up all the stress
I hope my brain busts
The Jackel is kicking up much dust
I'm representing L.O.D. and everywhere I'm hellbound
Kid I'll see you when I get there

[Mad Lion]
