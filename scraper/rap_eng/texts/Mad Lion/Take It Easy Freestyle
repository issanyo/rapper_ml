[Verse 1: Rocky]
Used to call me Push ‘cause I pushed by the quarter
Used to push keys ‘til the D's pushed harder
Push “start” – push buttons, start the car up
Push me, push your wig back like barbers
Off with your toupee, I boss hog like two lanes
Fuck red dots but my bullets come in Blu-ray
Pussy-ass niggas and they sweet like Kool-Aid
Married to the game, tell them niggas catch the bouquet
Don’t fuck with hoes, sometimes I’d rather beat off
My kicks so fire, burn the skin up on my feet off
Tell ‘em turn the heat down, they tell me my mink off
She’s so abusive, the boy she wanna skeet off

[Verse 2: Ferg]
Fancy, fancy, met her on Delancey
Pum-pum so good I eat her through her panties
Every Jamaican bitch always trippin’ off of Xanny
Wine Slow, so I give her gold like Santi
Bapes on my feet make the cypher complete
Margielas by the week, say my style is unique
Picking bitches by their teeth, for my bitches be heat
Put the pussy on lock, I remind 'em of sheiks
Cuttin’ niggas with my lines like a barber with Zekes
Burnin’ niggas with my rhymes, let the arsonist speak
I’m tryna have a Nicki Minaj every week
And fuck makin’ her cum, Imma fuck her ‘til she pee
And if she was a midget, I would fuck her on my knees
‘Cause that ass fat, I will fuck her ‘til she sleep
It’s Trap Lord Sunday every day of the week
A-S-A-P ‘til I D-I-E, ma’fucka
