If you got an itch to catch some havoc
There's mayhem in the plastic
City of La La, I mean the land of holy Zsa Zsa
The wood is hot and you can spot the flocks
Of people like sheep, those with dredlocks
To jocks with Reeboks, fleeing hard rocks
A la caf', Bambatta flashy fashion
Imagine crashing bashes with bitches
That be bad and wishing for the fame
And recognition
They're on a mission for self, baby
We're like the twelve, my tribe is crazy deep
We got the beats that are hot
We're like clinique
Foundation resonates when I speak
And if by chance, you catch it
Then listen, the wisdom
Epic, open hitting, choking up
You've done it now and woken up
The giant scientist of hits
That make you jump like a lunatic
On pogo sticks, waving your fists
So, if you're catching a fit
I don't really know but you better scram
Hurry in a double

CHORUS:
It goes on
On and on and on
Hell raising Hollywood
Welcome to Babylon
On and on and on and on
The party don't stop 'til the
Mystery's gone
I've seen it all, I'll see it again
I shake a lot of hands
But I don't got a lot of friends
It goes on. On and on and on
Hell raising Hollywood
Welcome to Babylon

Live from the city of lights
Sunny days and late nights
Dope, designer drugs, porn stars
And bar fights
I drop. Makes the bells rock
I'm Mr. Shifty Shellshock
Call me the man of the hour
In the land of the lost
Taking the money and the power
CXT, we hold our own
All eyes on us
Crazy rise rain like brimstone
Kicking up dust
I grab the mic with a firm hold
In a world of shattered goals
Pot holes, broke folks and
Bank roll
Pole position
Daddy rolling, rolling causing Havoc
So, ready set
I'm more than set
Like Morissette, to Maverick
Got a, she's got to have it, habit
Sick, I leave them stuck
I'm getting high for a living
Not giving a fuck

CHORUS

I'm screaming out the call of the wild
I'm speaking in tongues
I am the child of the sun
The power of one
I beat the drums
Of the Crazy Town click
It's the third eye sitting on the tip
Of the pyramid flipped
Now I see a little shotty
Illuminatti front
Dead bodies in my trunk
Unraveling the source
I travel into self
You gauge my wage
And then you try to debate my wealth
The consequences linger
And I'm fingering the perpetrators
Hey yo, my nature was bred
On the cross fader
It's the 7th house
Armageddon trudger
Ready for death

It's the brimstone slugger

CHORUS
