[Intro]
Run, run, run, run...
Will you stay or will you run
When you looking at this

[Chorus]
I know you young but are you looking at this
I know you got dumb but are you looking at this
Your day is gonna come when you looking at this
Will you stay or will you run when you looking at this

[Verse 1]
You cannot see we now free, we get cassette back
So everytime I get the microphone I gotta bless that
Everytime I speak the truth they hopin' you forget that
9/11 truth got proof, you know we rep that
The war was started on a lie - did you forget that?
Politics is all about money and we accept that
Voting is like joking with rights we'll never get back
This a different type of rap of what you might've guessed eh?
Fresh rap - put it on your tongue, man, test that
People always askin' and passin' where KRS at
I be teachin', preachin' and speakin' a little less rap
Educators, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 2]
Too many rappers talkin' 'bout now they the best at
While KRS-One is at levels they'll never get at
Beat bitin', fakin' the funk - dudes respect that?
All these lies hitting your head, right where you rest at
They take your mind off the truth and put it where the sex at
Now these rappers doing R&B - forget that
In the game I'm bright, I'm skipped twice, they left that
Cash - I don't stress that, the stage is where I'm fresh at
Cats want cars but don't know where East or West at
Steering themselves right into where the stress at
Their own words got 'em sick and right there where the mess at
Talking like demons but wanting God to bless that
Take a minute, step that
Think a minute, digest that
It's not every day a teacher speaks and you get that
Down goes the devil - ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
The American presidency is for sale and you can check that
You think one man, one vote really elects that
News with views? Where's the free press at
Don't let 'em take your mind and put it where the rest at
Edutainers, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that

[Chorus]
