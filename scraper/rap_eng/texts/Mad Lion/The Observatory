[Intro: Rakaa]
Nah man, sometimes I just vibe out, right?
Get lost, just to find a new way home or something
Nah, sometimes I just like to cruise up top, where I go
Get a good perspective on everything
And I see it all like...

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
I’ve seen the first black, first fam, After M.O.P
I’ve seen Tony Hawk skate the White House, roam free
I’ve seen idealist expectations
And raw racism in the age of misinformation
I’ve seen how delicately the world spins
Political tightrope, slip, the world ends
I’ve seen Barack’s balance, I’ve seen the flocks worship him
But when they get practical, it slowly starts to hurt again
They ask me if I support, I say that I’m a reporter
I’m under no illusion, yes I know they’re under orders
I’ve seen a politician’s hate to feed a thin veil
A few stretch their arm out straight and inhale
The water is all set for Tea Party service, boiling
The government makes free markets nervous
Historic bills, Biden called a “Big Fucking Deal”
Healthcare, but schools are sick, kids suffer still

[Hook: Mad Lion]
With the alignment of the stars, I even seen the fall
From my observatory, I focus and I see it all
(Alignment of the stars, I even see it fall
From my observatory I focus and see it all.)

[Verse 2: Rakaa]
I’ve seen nature show the Golden Ratio, in the ocean
DNA plants galaxies in heavenly motion
To the base of creation, the prime
To the life lived in between modern measured units of time
I’ve seen my line go back to Nine Ether Divine
Heirloom genetics helped, when that pure light shines
The Sekam, the Naiyama, The Chiqui, the Pirhana
Solar Cycle put the extra energy on ‘em
Mitochondria DNA from the Nile
To Henrietta Lacks, ride full circle back to black
The original dynasty to reunite you lambs
Five rulers from Nubia, Kushites advance
Restore order, my diaspora is in everything
Common denominator links bloodlines in every king
I’ve seen Egypt get effects, make-up and editing
For the screen, the Hollywood propaganda machine

[Hook: Mad Lion]

[Verse 3: Rakaa]
I’ve seen Blackwater become XE
They sold parties for the GOP, RNC
Hellraisers connect, VIP Fundraisers for checks
I’ve seen my face on a traitor card deck
I’ve seen few things in my life as irresponsible as that
I broke down the big business of war, it’s a fact
Retail artillery, civilians will be shelled
Collateral, the media flips the details
I’ve seen Halliburton spin-off to KBR
Control power, plus modern slavery for a charge
Oil money so slick, Dick Cheney retired
CEO, the Texas company moved to Dubai
The World Bank is the church, I see worshippers of currency
Then I’ve seen millions turn to billions in emergency
Arms dealing, war profiteering, racketeering by the same ones
Malcom would have called out the hearings

[Hook: Mad Lion]

[Outro: Mad Lion]
Mad Lion, you see me!
Open your third eye vision, don’t listen to the “Tell-Lie-Vision”
Ya see me, them the soldiers in Gideon
Stay focused, we it ain't hopeless, you know this
Ya see me, Dilated Peoples
