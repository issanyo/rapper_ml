[Hook]
Whatever might go down, we gon' survive that
Food, clothes and shelter, we gon' find that
When you hear this sound, you know that I’m back
Hey, it’s where I put your mind at

[Main Verse]
When that disaster hit, don’t you get trapped in it
You must always stay prepared with your disaster kit
In the club you might be drunk and you may laugh a bit
But when you sober up you know it hits what you have to get
Stay prepared, never be fear for no evil scared
These natural disaster, cannot be compared
So rise and realize you will survive
In the mean time prepare yourself with these supplies
Get coils of rope and coils of wire, in a water proof container
Put all your fire, like matches and candles, and don’t wear sandals
Get some hard boots and work gloves to handle
The situation, cause when disaster hits the nation
You and your family gonn need your medication
Antibiotics, aspirins, don chronic
Even health foods like vitamins and garlic
Pain relievers, inhalers and breathes
And make sure you got something that can take down a fever
A spray bottle of water, with 10% bleach
So you can disinfect the objects you reach
And speaking of bleach, here’s what I teach
Don’t think that you can drink the water from the beach
You gonn have to drink that water from your hood
And purify the water to make sure it’s all good
Put things in order
Put 8 drops of pure unscented liquid bleach
Into the water, use only 8 drops for every 1 gallon you working
You’ll need about 5 gallons a person
With no water, things could get lethal
It’s dehydration, not starvation that kills people
So look for the water first, don’t be robbing and looting and stealing and killing
That will only make things worse
Be smart, plan ahead, save some cash, a radio, some gas
And some blow up beds
Keep your disaster kits high on the shelf
With your weapons, you might have to defend yourself
Get a flash light, chemical light sticks and whole that
A compass, some dry food, maybe a road map
Don’t forget things like peroxide, listerine, bandages and antihistamines like Bendadryl
So when things get ill, you will survive
Cause you really got skill
You opened your eyes
After you got through your list of supplies
Check your attitude, know that you gonna survive
