Money, power, respect nigga
Believe that nigga
Way of life
Yeah
Aye!

[Hook]

I'm doing Migo numbers
I'm selling Miley Cyrus
Got Nino clientele
The trap house like The Carter

Money and the power
Got money and the power

I got real shooters
I got road runners
I can buy a case
Keep a fye lawyer

Money and the power
Got money and the power

[Doe B Verse]

Pull up in something ruthless
Got respect like Tookie
Because I got real shooters
And everything is moving
Got Nino clientele
But this is not a movie
Wrist game stupid
Ain't no way I'm losing
Fishscale booming
Thousand bail booming
Uhaul backed in
But ain't nobody moving
Ain't nothing but chickens in them
Ain't nothing but midgets in them
Like Nicholas Cage, nigga I'll have them gone in 60 seconds
Touchdown shawty
I have no interceptions
30 rounds shawty
All we toting is extensions
I got real hitters
Bet you'll end up missing

Whole brick on your head bet you'll end up missing

[Hook]

I'm doing Migo numbers
I'm selling Miley Cyrus
Got Nino clientele
The trap house like The Carter

Money and the power
Got money and the power

I got real shooters
I got road runners
I can buy a case
Keep a fye lawyer

Money and the power
Got money and the power
