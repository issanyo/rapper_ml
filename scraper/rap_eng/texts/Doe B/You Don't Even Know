[Chorus:]
You don’t even know it
Damn you so bad girl, the way you bounce that ass girl
Coming down that pole
Make a nigga spend his last girl
Oh I got to have you
[?]
Buy you anything you want girl, you can bring your home girl
I’m about this dough
You don’t even know you’re worth girl, you deserve the earth girl
You don’t even know it

[Verse 1:]
Yea, I blow the check I’m honest
She so cool, she’s a true God honest
Think I met the baddest bitch to ever walk this planet
Five Five brown eyes, she look like Janet
[?}
I’m so charged, I can’t wait to put my hands on you
I got your birthday cake, i’m gonna blow [?}
Yea the whole ass is fake, you been shaking it since school
Now I ain’t saying bae a gold digger
But she ain’t got no business with no broke nigga
With a body like that all that mali, shake that ass
What I wanna do to you girl
You don’t even know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Sex filled shopping spree
Hair and your nails did
All i do is spoil her, she know i can’t help it
Baby just my type, she the type you spen yo life with
Got me feeling strange, got me thinking I might wife it
I don’t do the dirt man cause i’m all triflin
Might go on vacation, invite all my white friends
Babygirl my running back, more like my tight end
Up and down the interstate riding with a life [?]
She know that [?] Junior you the man
Come back running catch me if you can
Just stan in front of me and do yo dance
You ain’t even know that you might get a man

[Chorus]
