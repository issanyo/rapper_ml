[Chorus:]
Quarter halves an wholes [x8]

[Verse 1:]
Got a whole pack of Advil, biz an tons a X
Got a bitch loaded up an she give me turtle neck
When I ride a griffin, nigga that's a quarteback
Can I lift one liff of dowey this is muscle pass
We strong boys, fuck with us we homeboy
Get your cells off my phone, this a cell phone, boy
Hit my nigga Junior up I need a beer, homeboy
Jerry 10 I ran through it before 12 homeboy
Got a plate full of ace timers, that’s a heavy block
Nigga hurry up and buy really you don't have a shot
Clientele off the charts, run you niggas off the block
Bitch they droppin out yo pockets while my pockets got the mop

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Gotta reel in d drought got a Quarter halves an wholes
Trap goin ham so that white can't stall
Lames talking shit, talking bout they rabbit hole
His not with the flicks, now he's acting like a stove
Ran out wit yo pack, I don’t owe a nigga shit
If a nigga seem sweet, damn right I pull a trick
Can catch me on that D, Forgiatos on d whip
All my niggas dope b, pullin up a half of brick
I sit tall on the bottom, on the top I see no bitch
I ain't gotta do a hit, just a damn remix
Nigga know M.O.B., money ova any bitch
Ol bredda OG, break it down anotha sift

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Quarter halves an wholes the whole team came an vibin in
Lil started dis an saw d chick now he stretchin it
Whoop d back, work d fort, now I’m set grindin up
Meet a man that got only a ounce out of a whole hup
He got all week to pluck an he got a needle from a corner store
I told him to give me the money first an he did so I was gone though
Laughin up outta d bank doe, I got d doe swag
He jay runnin in an out, ma truck full bankin
When we go hold d rifle while Junior go whip a miracle
A nigga beef wit me walkin on d street that’s a miracle
Got James Bond jury dese niggas they weigh an pay to go
40 quarter roll out in headquarter ass wholes

[Chorus]
