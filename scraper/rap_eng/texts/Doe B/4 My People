[Intro]
I do that shit for my people x4

[Verse 1]
Yeah, long nights on that block, I remember, nigga
I'm in the heat, trying to make a million [?]
Man, I'm in my nigga, rest in peace my nigga
All the shit I sacrifice to try to be that nigga
I just want a plug, all those trips I took
Money I fucked up, did it for the hood
My first trip was my [?] trip, I ain't make it back
Then I tried the mail, and [?] got me jail
I do that for my fam, I don't do this shit for nothing
Scrambling with them ground, just trying to make me something
Tito facing ten, and he still kept it real
When you call home and I got that mil, just know you got a Benz

[Hook]
We not hustling for zero, we do this shit for a reason
Taking chances with kilos, and many bales of reefer
Conversations with [?], just to feed my people
I do this shit for my people, cause nigga these my people

[Verse 2]
I do that for my fam
I do this shit for my sister, brothers, and mom, and them
And she so [?],'wait 'til they free my unc and them
One in the state, one in the fed
Two are dead, all the tears them nigga's shed
I deal with so much stress, that's why I [?]
Too much time, many rhymes to get this shit off my chest
And granted you know I'm blessed, I just wish that you could see me
In a million years who overthrow the [?] will be on T.V
And everything I got not really did come easy
That's why I'm a go even harder for my daughters know they need me
[?] them boys stay in school, I'll make sure they dress nicely
