[Hook: X10]
Whenever, wherever, whoever, however

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Whenever I catch you downback
Just know that your ass
And the red light is a green light
On sight, toe tag
My hood don't go pass
'Round here you have no pass
Don't forget, take a pic'
Write it down on your notepad
Don't call my phone cause we ain't squashing shit
I'mma show your niggers we ain't 'bout that shit
My phone calling you at this bitch
Don't play with me cause I'm not your kid
As you can see I'm on my macho shit
I'mma show your niggers I got real muscles
And ya'll niggers should've been killed
Because right now I'm gettin' real money
I could get you touched for a lil' night
Them niggas too while they ill hustle
That bitch too while she pillow talking
Tell that ho go pick a coffin
Telescope, I see you walking
Hit your ass thousand miles away
Heard the news while I was ballin'
Cashing out with a smiley face
Anywhere any time of the day
Pick a place, it ain't matter
Broadday Frank Lucas style
Just say the words 'his shit Splatter'
Your lil' niggas in big trouble
Got two big for them small bridges
Is whenever, however, CBM we all with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
How promise you tell 'em whenever, wherever

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spodee]
Whenever, wherever
I come from the slum where is hot as the devil
Then come with this girl and we're leaving together
Gucci's are decent, but these are Margelia (Yaa)
[?] gifted for leading norwegian or leading some rebels
I came from the bottom, I leave with the middels
Still walking the streets, smoking weed with the fellas
Leather and wood, my interior's handled
Gon' call back the motor
Ey, where the fuck are the drugs
Cause I don't really like functioning sober
I wanna play but my bitch want to rover
I can't explain, my ambitions took over
To her right now, but I used to ride over
But in it they better than marshals and soldiers
Thousands of people believing in Spodee
I lead from the show, where they treating my holy
Niggas I'm winning, classics and [?]
I keep on stacking my chick in the [?]
Whenever, wherever, whoever, however
I thought niggers wanted it
Please I will be coming with guns
Somebody be my opponent, yeah
