[Verse]
Started out with peanuts, young street dreamer
Feeling like Ace Boogie when he first quit the cleaners
Almost shocked the world, Muhammad Ali
I’m back stabbing, Calvin ass niggas tryna team up
Back watching my nigga because I’m watching for niggas
Who wanna stop me my nigga but trust me I’mma get richer
By any means, like macking with that thing in that picture
I ain't ringing like a iPhone, niggas wanna leave me cause
When you get money, trouble tend to come your way
If you play, raise my gun like my son in your face
I bust it like a nut, made me cum on your face
I go off like a bomb, think Saddam in this place
A lot of niggas in the way, still in a turtle race
But you know it ain’t no fun when the rabbit got the cake
I go hard like a pallet in yo place
And I ain’t spraying like Proactive in your face, you niggas at me to the streets
I can’t believe niggas believe niggas
Bet, you could check my background
Yea, I was gone for a minute but I’m back now
And you little niggas, summer’s over, fallback now
I done fell down a couple times, crawl back now
Hoes ain’t used to answer for me, now they call back now
I ain’t used to be shit, they think I’m all that now
Niggas hollering beef shit back to me, y'all on cow  worse
Yea, and these is words of a real nigga
No matter where, hand you a Dolce got a deal with it
And how I feel is how I feel, there’s no feel niggas
Cause fake niggas paralyze real niggas
Back when I was little loved to idolize real niggas
And see how much it says really do kill niggas
They ain’t gon' feel you til they kill you
I’m top five dead or alive,  one of the realest
Just the ordinary life of a G
I can’t believe these niggas want stripes off of me
Niggas I grew up with, I can’t even fuck with
He can’t look you in the eyes, then a nigga suspect
That’s the reason I can’t trust shit
But my vision colorful as TrukFit
I could see the future
I could see the winners and the loser
Copping Versace, I feel like Medusa
Snakes around my head, snakes around my bed
Snakes all in the yard, damn, gotta cut the grass
Niggas I give my last, they don’t even wanna see me last
Take the good with the bad but damn this shit bad
Get money, don’t get mad
I said get money, don’t get married
Only wife of mine just this life of crime
When I started fronting with Duck I almost got fired
I remember hearing shots fired in the hospital dog
Said he thrown apart, can’t recognize
I’m up nine, mane backin' down
It’s trap life til my casket down
This my city, you can ask around
And if I’m lying in that case, a fish can drown
My god, we ain’t no motherfuckin biscuit town
Yall can keep all that bullshit, just don’t forget the crown
King shit
