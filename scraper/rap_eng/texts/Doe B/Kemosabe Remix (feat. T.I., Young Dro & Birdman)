Woa Kemosabe, woa, woa

Woa Kemosabe, woa, woa

I said woa Kemosabe, woa, woa

Woa Kemosabe, woa, woa

I blow the check in Follies

I coulda bought a 'Rari

Pull up in the big body

Valet had to double park it

I'm covered in Versace

I'm Fresh prince, these niggas Carlton

Flexin' through the projects

Them bitches think I'm 'luminati

My nigga say fuck a Bugatti

Buy him a Box Chevy on 30's

Straight out the dutty, drink muddy, bitches slutty

Get head so long, she fuck around, caught a concussion

Top off on a foreign

Ballin' like Amar'e

2 bitches and they barbies

1 on lean and 1 on mollies

50 hoes in the lobby

Chain gold and it's Versace

I'm like woa Kemosabe

Big ballin' is my hobby

Top off on that foreign, G4 Jet that boring

Pass me the ball I'm scorin'

Fuck yo bitch she whorin'

Got 23 bitches on the T-Bird

3 plus 3, that's 6 birds

24 cups, 21 that's 4-5

That's what I keep on my side

If a nigga tryna run up in my house

I'mma blow his ass back outside

And even if the fuck nigga look wrong

I'mma knock the pussy nigga cock eye

Me and Doe B show 'em how to rock out

This verse so hot I'm finna hop out

Ey Bob, man I'm finna go beast mode

Dominating here, getting knocked out

I'mma stop now slow it up

Rolled on on my 30's

Ask that bitch, I fucked all her buddies

That ho be lookin' dusty

I bet her pussy musty

I'm like "whoah Kemosabe"

I started this shit cos that's my hobby

Big Tymer that's my name ho

Versaces on my frame ho

All gold everything

I put that shit on everything

Got a ring on every finger nigga

Diamonds flooded in this bitch like it's raining nigga

Bitch on my arm like a singer nigga

Hah, she might just be a singer nigga

I do what the fuck I want

And I buy what the fuck I want

Bottle poppin' with my possy, we ballin like the Cosbys

Ballin's in my bloodline, casa de mi patri

Young god is the prophet, young playa stackin' profit

I made a quarter million and I never went to college

Say the flow out here is solid, smoking hydroponics

Even in Japan boy, I get plenty sake

I'm all about the dollar, bitches wanna holler

Bet yo girl got more inside her mouth than just in gossips

And this life is all that I know

Ain't after that, I didn't miss it

And we go hard, these niggas lip but them ventriloquists whisper

From band hitters on 6, niggas would kill to get rich

And this Doe B, B.o.B, G.D.O.D, we rich nigga

Top off on a foreign

Ballin like Amar'e

2 bitches and they barbies

1 on lean and 1 on mollies

I got foreign whips in my garage

Top down in that SB

I got plane gas in my cigar

And I match a clique in my ashy

And Hustle Gang we about that action

And all them other pussy niggas just actin

And yo gang play, cocaine pay

For everything I got like 30K

I'm still a drug dealer, how you love that?

Love a real nigga, den you love me!

Catch me in the spot, where they sellin' drugs at

Come with 50-60, you can get you 2 or 3

Bending corners in Ferrari Californias

(Ay who you with?) Fuckin' with a bitch in California

(Ay what you doin'?) Smokin' shit you get from California

Bitch get wrong she gon' get left in California
