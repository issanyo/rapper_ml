[Hook – Doe B]
I’ll never forget
All my niggas who was with me when I was fucked up
And I’ll never forget
All the bitches who stuck with me when I had nothing
And I’ll never forget
All the shit that we went through when we were growing up
Even if I move to another planet tomorrow
I’ll never forget where I come from

[Verse 1 – Scotty ATL]
I’ll never forget
All my niggas that came up with me and didn’t switch up
Did dirt together and never snitched on me
Man I’ll never forget
My main girl take a sack to work for the low low
My customer, that clockwork
Man I’ll never forget, we robbing shit
Young nigga not giving fucks, we mobbing shit
Hit the circle on Marble road and need a fan break
Trap jumping, man just locked that shit
Head hurting, my first tape they was bobbing shit
Can’t forget my nigga Dante, boy we had them hoop dreams
Now I’m fighting off groupie bitches with short hair and hoop rings
Life is simple then things change, got to change with it or get left out
Only bout 2, 3 niggas been in the circle, never stepped out
I’ll never forget

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Scotty ATL]
Can’t forget that one time that I was down and out and didn’t have shit
[?] let me stay there, we was getting money paper bag shit
Can’t forget these fuck niggas be claiming down, they so fake
Can’t forget my down chick, my ride or die, my soul mate
I was stuck at the fourway, Glock came, can’t forget that
Sometimes my eyes water when I think about it, got to sit back
Can’t forget my nigga Lil Dre, you gone man but you taught me
Go harder on the hating niggas, these pussy niggas can’t stop me
Can’t forget my nigga Doe B, miss my nigga, that’s real shit
Died over some BS, now a nigga got to live with it
Can’t forget them real niggas in the hood now while I’m in New York
Jesus piece with real gold for my lost ones and my kin folk
I’ll never forgot

[Hook]

[Bridge – Scotty ATL]
Never forget where I’m from, never forgetting my hood
Throwing my E to the sky
Never forgetting it’s real, never forgetting the life
Never forgetting these niggas don’t like me cause I’m special
Real niggas don’t die
Never forgetting I’m winning, man fuck being tied
Never forgetting I came out the mud

[Hook + Bridge]
