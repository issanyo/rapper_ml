[HOOK X2]
Trashbag money, please don't get me started
Nothing but racks up in this bag this ain't no garbage
Shoebox money, please don't get me started
Fill to the top with 100's ain't no jordans

[VERSE 1: Doe B]
Trashbags money talking Glass backs money
Remix everything this ain't never swag money
Momma said boy you act like you ain't never had money
Birdman money I'm talking cash money
And when I grow up I wanna be a millionaire
Shoebox money man I got about 50 pair
Fill those with 100s ain't no 20's, ain't no 50's
And my client√®le jumping cause my 20's look like (fishes?)
Sold a diamond to a dummy then I cash that on a bricky
Remix I brought a quarter bag like Robert Griffin
Walking with them trash bags like I am working for the city
Nigga check that shoe box them ain't no motherfuckin Timberlands

[VERSE 2: Jr Boss]
Counting all this damn money, man my hand hurt
Grand daddy purp, got my next tail chirping
Bring it to your front door call it curb serving
Put me in the hall of fame, a young George Gervin
All this shit I sold, I should have been a pharmacist
Just make sure your money straight or I can front ya shit
Ever seen a trap nigga do a magic trick
Me with it strong 18 to a 36
I got swipers that turn regret to a hoodlum
Nigga playing with that work, he gonna have problems
Nigga mad about his bitch because she swaller
(Thawing food?) situation what we call her
Trashbag money please don't get me started
That's the main reason why I tote this forty
Two bad bitches and they both foreign
Around the world touring but I am not a artist

[VERSE 3: Perry Boi]
Nothing but hustler around me, that's just how we do it
I smoke nothing but Irene, don't pass me that boojy
Perry Boi, Solid hood, nigga the streets were my influence
Post it up, lil harver circle K all the way to stuart
Got a little girl in this world, no time for the bullshit
Thinking I ain't gonna fuck you over, boy that ludacris
I'ma pull your car nigga and fuck your broad nigga
And take your soul from ya because you ain't got no heart nigga
I was 16 when I touched something hard nigga
And I was 17 when I caught that charge nigga
I knew you was a bitch-made that why I won't fuck wit ya
CBM, we got it out the mud gutter nigga yep
