[Intro]
Turn up music
Yeah, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up on a nigga, I flex up on them hoes
I turn up on them niggas, I flex up on them hoes

[Hook]
Everywhere I be and everywhere I go
Them bitches know it’s me
I flex up on them hoes
I turn up on them niggas
I flex up on them hoes
I turn up on them niggas
I flex up on them hoes
Bottles in V.I.P, before I rock the show
Them niggas knows it’s me
I flex up on them hoes
I turn up on them niggas
I flex up on them hoes
I turn up on them niggas
I flex up on them hoes

[Verse 1]
I hit em’ with the flex, I hit em’ with the flex
Them niggas talking fire, I hit them with the tech
Nigga I got stripes like a motherfucking ref
Nigga I got ice round my motherfucking neck
Yeah, ladies said turn up
I'm throwin' cash like quarterbacks I kick it like a punter
These niggas all clowns, man I see 'em looking funny
They like the CD man, I got my motherfucking butter
Mario Chalmers, bitch I'm shootin' [?], why are you retarded?
Bitch I got a dumb name, bank roll Shorty
You can’t fool Loney
I'm flexin with no muscles, they say I’m acting cocky

[Hook]

I pull up flexin’, hop out flexin’
Them kids like Mike, he got a car for a necklace
Yeah, yeah, baby it’s a star in your presence
Walk in the club, bought the bar for a second
Made it rain 20, made it rain 30
Made it rain, early
Balled in that bitch like a young James Worthy
Fucked up 50, Lord knows I ain’t perfect
Get it right back, I fuck up sex
I fuck up Minnies, then we fuck up sex
Walking kind of funny, cause I’m walking with them racks
Bands in my pants look like football pads
I throw a football pass, nigga

[Hook]
