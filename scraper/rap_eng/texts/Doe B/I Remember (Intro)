[Verse 1]
I remember it was winter time, 2008
In December round Christmas time, I couldn’t cop the J’s
Mama facing prison time, barely had a place to stay
Look myself in the mirror and said I’d rather be in the grave
Thats why 'till this very day I still scream fuck the state
Fuck the feds, fuck the judge, he hold a grudge against my race
17 years old with a quarter ounce of yay
Cut that shit up so bad they said it need a band-aid
Live for the first and fifth, nigga that’s a bad date
We don’t know nothing else that’s how we get our rent paid
I was working like a slave, call me Kunta Kinte
Caught the chain in the whip and went and got my shit sprayed
When you ride candy paint the hoes  fuck the first day
So much crack in the sink I thought we had an earthquake
Hit that bitch with the yank then smoke a set on first plate
Plug sent so many chickens went and bought a bird cage
My nigga waiting on the bond now he got a murder case
Bet this rap shit ain’t fun now they let me in the game
All these pussy niggas done now, stick a fork in 'em
Just got finished eating my lunch now tell me what’s for dinner
Lord forgive me, I’m a sinner, fuck them niggas and who with them
If you ain’t with me, you against me, ain’t no monkey in the middle
And its CBM, choppers, bricks, money, we official
Still with the same niggas and they dumping off the glizzy
Hold up, them niggas ain’t ready to die
