[Verse]
I was 12 years old, trapping out mama house
Sell them 50 for a O, 900 for a pound
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

We was posted on the corner, standing with that llama out
Ready to show a pussy nigga what that drama about
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

I had whole pound fair back when I was 13
My country boy was getting them bitches for me dirty cheap
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

I’m talkin parking lot action, stunting at the front street
Cuz it’s prime down on 4, flexing hard with lil fee
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

Way before these niggas even started talking bout finessing
Bitch I was on the team tricking niggas for lil nicks
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

Way back I wouldn't give my hand, had that bitch going H.A.M
Prefer to hit the town, 50 dollar for a ground
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

Back when me and Lil Goony used to be in Buckingham
Talking razorblade action, selling never 100 slams
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

Thousand dollar dice games, bet a 100, shoot a 100
At the same time those swinging cellphones jumping
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

In a way we were straight, what if they’re blowing money?
Paint wet, motor runnin, Ace on the Porsche cutless
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

I remember back when (?) was on (?)
Rest in peace to Chevy D, one time for Willy Park
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

I done seen Lil Daddy do some numbers on that south
And a nigga still at it, my little nigga J got out
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

Circle came straight, that bitch still doing numbers
And we got what you need, lil G just here, pull up on 'em
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

300 stacked fat, 3-6 figure Z
I’ma get money off of rap when your car on that heat
Nigga, that's Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

Tell 'em free my nigga Tito, boy you took one for the team
When your car home I got ya and I put that shit on it
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

Told my man "easy, take it easy, best believe God got ya"
And motherfuck the feds, tell them bitches free my uncle
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga

Told Huck I wasn’t gon get him out the streets when I first met him
For what them niggas talkin? Homie you a real nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
This that Trap Muzik, nigga
