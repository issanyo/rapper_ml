Doe B [#RIPDOEB]

(Hook)
We countin' money, where the drugs? I just paid the plug
Throwin' money in the club, I just paid the plug
Banging those ratchet girls, I just paid the plug
Bought that bitch what she love, I just paid the plug
Another day, another job, I just paid the plug
Sippin' champagne in the tub, I just paid the plug
Now the feds in the hood, I just paid the plug
Bitch I’m ballin' I don’t give a fuck, I just paid the plug

(Verse)
I just cashed out, poppin foreigns, smashed out
Poppin' in my trap, all my niggas say I’m spazzin' out
I don’t give a fuck, nigga I just paid the plug
Shit that newly cut, I got 18 women trust
Pulling out like Ray forever
Plugged in, we both got tether
Feds don’t know what I’m sellin'
Trap life will cause my 40
Dollar check watch and Bentley
This a movie, roll the credits
Bitch I’m Gucci copastatik
Keep my shooters Kobe ready
Bitch and I got more time
Yo hoe a bill no one
She’s only a groupie girl forgot
Cost so much money, feel like I got all the rocks

(Verse)
I just cashed out, the plug straight
Couple hunned in the hood, the thugs straight
Activist in my cup, yuh my mud great
Purple flowers at yo funeral, we love hate
Send them bitches upstate, yea that’s how a nigga ain’t
Show me, just party ain’t
Kush come in, got a low low weight
Niggas I love don’t know Jose
Ace of spades, no more Rose
Bitch I’m ballin like I’m great
2 on scooper for mo ace
I just paid the plug nigga, I just paid the plug
Bitch just said don’t give me look like you just made a chug
I said bitches you know me then you should know that’s what I does
Cos I’m in all white birds and they after it like doves
