(Intro)
Yea
Turn the beat up a little
I like the way you playin the guitar in that motherfucker
Yea
Yea
You know I don’t play the motherfuckin radio with these bitches

(Verse)
Right before most I’m a motherfuckin mac
Ain’t dealin with no hoe ‘less she got motherfuckin stacks
Watch me work, I keep that, what you motherfuckin bangin?
Free the beak and bubblegum
Send that in and not the bangers
When it come to these hoes, boy the kid got rank
Ain’t no bitch I can’t score, feel like Lebron James
I go hard on the sleigh like a real ass nigga
She can hate my fuckin guts but she lovin pimpin
Got my other hoes trippin, tell em I don’t call er
Lost yo job last week, bitch and I need koala
Ain’t got nothing but bad boss bitches on my lobster
She might be fine in yo eyes but all I see is dollars

(Hook)
I go hard, I go on a hoe (the mac back)
I’m a mac nigga, you ain’t know (the mac back)
Turn yo back and I’ll take yo hoe (the mac back)
I might hit er, try to break a hoe (the mac back)
And I still hustle on the low (the mac back)
I’d be damned if I’d go for broke (the mac back)
So bitch don’t you play with dough (the mac back)
Bring that money, homie play yo role (the mac back)

(Verse)
I keep all my hoes in line like a motherfuckin clinic
And I stay in they mouth like a motherfuckin dentist
When it come to this pimpin ain’t no motherfuckin limit
Poppin pills, lean sippin, still fuckin on my kidney
I got hoes all in Texas, I got hoes all in Memphis
Miami and Atlanta, I got hoes all in Philly
And they all got connects on that tough so mix some chickens
Got my bitch out there in Cali
And if she say no let’s damn 50
Got it before with them taxes, every year she make a killing
Love to take a nigga shoppin, spending racks in the limits
My lil bitch up in Virginia, all she do is look pretty
Say she hate my fuckin guts but she lovin my pimpin

(Hook)
I go hard, I go on a hoe (the mac back)
I’m a mac nigga, you ain’t know (the mac back)
Turn yo back and I’ll take yo hoe (the mac back)
I might hit er, try to break a hoe (the mac back)
And I still hustle on the low (the mac back)
I’d be damned if I’d go for broke (the mac back)
So bitch don’t you play with dough (the mac back)
Bring that money, homie play yo role (the mac back)
