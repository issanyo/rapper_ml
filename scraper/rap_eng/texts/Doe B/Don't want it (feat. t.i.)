(Intro)
Every day we sacrifice for the motherfuckin streets
But they still come with adversity
And we embrace that

So I woke up this morning and I thought to myself
These pussy niggas don’t it, let go they all off the shelf
Call upon all my niggas and keep my head to the left
Lookin to lyrics that I never turn, I bring home my cheddar
Where they thought like the better, words might stretch like a river
Hear these niggas talkin fowl, they deserve what they took
Smoke a nigga like Snoop and lighter strike in your lip
Push my blunt on the crew boys, don’t move like Luke in this bitch
That choppa hot as the lava, they don’t call this yo friend
I hear you weird niggas talkin, don’t mean to pull with your friends

And she say nobody feels you
You need nobody until somebody kills you
So all these niggas all wanna be famous
Will I paint the picture until I paint it
Talkin bout crazy like a R&B singer
Like I go up for a week like a brand new Chrysler
Better keep a eye, mean this a ranger
Niggas got a problem, I suggest you get a handle
Don’t light it up, you don’t wanna know what up
This shit I got for you will be better for yo health

(Pre-Hook)
I swear to God you don’t want it
I swear to God you don’t want it
Real talk, you don’t want it
Real talk, you don’t want it

(Hook)
But real niggas don’t fuck wit yall
They don’t fuck wit yall, they don’t fuck wit yall
Real niggas don’t fuck wit yall
They don’t fuck wit yall, they don’t fuck wit yall
Real bitches don’t fuck wit yall
They don’t fuck wit yall, they don’t fuck wit yall
Them bitches don’t fuck wit yall
They don’t fuck wit yall, they don’t fuck wit yall

Okay little niggas here in my clique
And bad bitches on my dick
I’ll be a stand up guy til I die
And give a fuck who don’t like this shit
The flavor I keep, ain’t nobody right here
In a new drop big with hand white bitch
Poor black kid, ain’t nobody like you
Feel 4-5 brick when they blow to AC
Bolt up, might catch yo body like clique
Shoot them in the head, feed yo body to the fish
And goddamn B let em now we got the blow still purr on the low
Shawty ye ain’t even know
I can give a damn bout whoever hatin on me
Got some playin kid niggas and a few that can’t hold me
Got some Alabama niggas, say you really don’t want it
Remind them bad bitches always on it
Anybody know me know I used to sell the G for a silent OZ
But yo brain freeze 3, you can get a whole key
But for a nigga on the roll you can cago leap
One trip and where they at? Where they at? Less they call you
Cameras all in it, bitch want 1-40
If it ain’t 100 cash in the bag I ain’t going to the club
Fuck a little nigga, take him but they selling drugs

So from Rio De Janeiro to Chicago we ain’t hear em
Went missin my cheddar, Louie hella we appear
Every time you see me I got 2 freaks with a new uzzi and the S I take
Girl ya bad behavior, I suggest yall behave
My niggas tryna rob me for the automatic riddle
Nigga go, God bless yall niggas
I arrest yall niggas and be just that my niggas

(Pre-Hook)
I swear to God you don’t want it
I swear to God you don’t want it
Real talk, you don’t want it
Real talk, you don’t want it

(Hook)
