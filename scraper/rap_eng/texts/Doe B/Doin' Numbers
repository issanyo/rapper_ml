Hoodrich!

Dj Frank White!!!


(Chorus)

Bi-bi-bi-bi-bitch my trap spot doin numbers(doin' numbers!)
Mine round the way around the corner(around the corner!!)
Cocaine bales and marijuana 
Main thing is don't fumble (×2)


(Verse 1)
(Doe B)

M-m-my trap doin' numbers, i think this bitch is haunted
All these dead presidents bustin' out my robins
Got the whole hood howlin' 3 for the 40
OG Fee man said im fuckin' up the market
Bales on bargain, numbers always target
Pull up in a Masi', skrapped up wit a mausi'
My motor supercharger, runnin' like a faucet
Papi sent so many bricks, i could've built a project
Lying around the corner, we like waitin' masters
Trapper of the year, my whole team trappers
Benihana shawty, i got fish scale samples
Its chef boy Doe B and i am not a rapper!

(Chorus ×2)


(Verse 2)
(El Dorado)

Trap doin' numbers, everythang workin'
Fork in the pie, move around in circles
Trap doin' numbers, mine around the corner
Me and Doe B , strong boys marijuana
Kush, crack, and pills, yeah its doin' numbers
J's at my door got it hotter than a sauna
Bales of marijuana, lying 'round the corner
You could have girl friend dawg i don't want her
Im in love wit' money, im in love wit' hundreds
Im in love wit traffickin', im in love wit' junkies
Rerock pumpin', or base pumpin'
New name on the block, fish scale shawty

(Chorus ×2
