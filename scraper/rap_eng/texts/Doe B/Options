Options, options, nigga I got options
Pull up with a bad bitch
Looks like she from the island
Options, options, nigga I got options
Old school to foreign
Both them bitches top less
Options, options, nigga I got options
Gucci, Louis, Robin, True and Dolce & Gabbana
Options, options, nigga I got options
Cocaine meal weigh strong with the molly

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Shouts out to my coconut
Salute to my meal plug
One time for the molly man
Whatup with my whipboys
Pull up in that oldschool
Or might up in my [?]
Mazi in a Mazi whoever try me man I feel for
Shouts out to the Dustin feets
One time for the dirt bag
But all us fuckas quarter pieces
You know all my hoes bad
Hop out and I killed the scene
You know we got toe tag
Designer shoes, designer jeans
Gucci belt to hold em back
I just popped 'bout 4 oz
And now I'm in a different world
Never knew who my hoes is
I stay with a different gurl
Hit it then I swish em up
Dish her to my patna
But she so bad I might just keep a quarter [?]
