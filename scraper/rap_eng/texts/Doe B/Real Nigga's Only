Now where my bad bitches to help?
Baby don’t be scared, shake that ass for the camera
Showing he ain’t planned
Niggas do it for the real niggas only

Cause you’re a bad mama jama
Baby don’t be scared, shake that ass for the camera
Showing he ain’t planned
Bitch you do it for the real niggas only
You gotta do it for the real niggas only

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Real niggas in the building
You know how it goes
Money falling from the ceiling
Bitches on the pole
Eenie meenie miney moe
How [?] gonna take her home
Cause if you a real nigga then you can fuck with your wom
Thirty plus on the dough
Sinning like a ball player
Diamonds around my arm
And you know they’re all real
Making storm, call here
Bad bitches love me
Nigga, she say fuck you
But she wanna fuck me
And this shit must-see
You know I made a movie
She ain’t wanna turn up
The molly made her do it
And V.I.P. cut up
Under the influence
On [?] that you girl nigga’s around the world

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I. ]

Looking see you drop that down then lift it up
Puss lip telling me peek-a-boo
You do it right, might get fifty plus
Ya I paint just like one of my feature do
You got a nigga thinking about keeping you
But I do that ass, I’m leaving you
Shit, thoughts can’t be unreasonable
I train [?] like clothing seasonable
Only need to pull two to three girls. Some convo, and some refer
She don’t suck dick, you keep her
She eating pussy, we need her
Who drinking? Not me sir
If you can’t see, I got it
G3 her, that’s fly shit
She leave you, she on my dick
Hold up, stop that drop that pad and drop ten grams around where you standing
And my that ass so soft, shit throw me out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.O.B.]

Yeah, she a major bet
Pop that pussy like I take a set
Your momma made it in nine months
But I’m going to kill it in a day or less
I ain’t got no time to waste
I break it down, I don’t break a sweat, your lady next
I hit the road for about eighty days
Hmm, what’s that eighty checks?
They ain’t got no flavour
No Genre, that’s my label
Rather have a bad bitch with no makeup
Than a bad bitch with no paper
I wrap it up
If she ratchet, I strap it up
Like a loaded dock
Bitch back it up
Bitch so good, she dap me up
That bull that’s so stupid
But their face ain’t the cutest
I don’t call her no stripper
She a professional nudist
I can tell if it’s real
I can tell if it’s fake
But you don’t know how to shake that ass?
That’s you biggest mistake
Bam!
