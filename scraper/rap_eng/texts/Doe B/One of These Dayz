[Intro: Doe B]
Yea, yea, ‘ey
You know, one of the days, my n*gga (can’t wait)
Whatever you waitin’ on gon' eventually happen (can’t wait, can’t wait for that)
Yea, p*ssy


[Verse 1: Doe B]
One of these days man, a p*ssy gonna play
That’s why I put them hundred round drums on them Ks
AKs, SKs, fifty when the tech spray (what up?)
Hit you up, hit your girl, on to the next state
I got fifty shots n*gga (fifty!), hundred shots n*gga (drums!)
F*ck it, I’ll spray your whole block n*gga (tap, tap, tap, tap!)
Oil machine, spray your whole top n*gga
Candy paint, spray your whole car n*gga (wet ‘em up)
In these streets I’m Godzilla, you a small fry n*gga
When Lil’ Daddy come home we gonna ball, my n*gga (free Lil’ Daddy!)
And one of these days we gonna all die n*gga (for real)
That’s why every day I go hard for all my n*ggas (CBM!)
I got bitches callin’ me private (what else?), n*ggas talkin’ implied {?} (say what?)
Public enemy number one, I feel like McLyin’ (damn!)
And one of these days, I know these n*ggas gonna try me (come on!)
That’s why all my n*ggas wide receivers, ready to catch a body


[Hook: Doe B]
One of these days man, a p*ssy gon’ play (one of these days)
One of these days they gon’ let my n*ggas free (free the real n*ggas)
One of these days (yea!) x4
One of these days n*gga, we gon’ get some money (we gon’ get a check!)
One of these days man, the whole clique stuntin’ (the whole clique flexin’!)
One of these days (yea!) x4
‘Ey, take off


[Verse 2: Doe B]
One of these days they gon’ free the real n*ggas
One of these days they gon’ make me kill a n*gga
One of these days they gon’ feel a real n*gga (they gon’ feel me!)
One of these days I’m gon’ get that deal n*gga
One of these days you ain’t gon’ have your steel wit’ ya
A n*gga run up on you, catch you sleepin’, leave you drippin’
I’ve been having Lamborghini dreams man, I think I’m trippin’ (vroom!)
Now one these days man, y’all n*ggas gon’ see me in it (Lambo!)
And one of these days n*gga, I’m ‘a fuck Christina Millian
First million, one day I’m ‘a get it (mil!)
And one of these days I’m ‘a finesse your whole city (finesse!)
And turn right around and bless my whole city (the best!)
And one of these days, I’ll fuck up a whole ticket (damn!)
It don’t matter cause in one day, I can jugg a whole sixty (jugg!)
And one of these days man, a n*gga gon’ come and get me
It don’t matter, death before dishonor, rest in peace to snitches (brrat!)
