[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
Yeah yeah yeah, federal
Ayy RIP my nigga Doe B, you know what I mean
Wish I would've got a chance to meet you nigga
Super Nard what's up?

[Chorus: Super Nard]
Invisible, invisible
I'm somethin' you niggas ain't seein', man I'm invisible
Invisible, invisible
I'm like where my roof went? is it invisible?
Invisible, invisible
I'm known to make 'em disappear like they invisible
Invisible, invisible
And all my diamonds crystal clear like they invisible

[Verse 1: Super Nard]
It's Young Sup', make your ho turn invisible
Try to beef with me, I make your ass look pitiful
Say you gettin' money, that shit fictional
'Cause your trap in bad condition, that shit critical
My plug just like FedEx, he drop the load off
And I'm just like my money nigga, I never fold dog
Nigga hit my line, I told him you pay the whole cost
Pulled up, served him rabbit food, then I just drove off
I'm gettin' money, this shit is visible
You rappin' 'bout your flooded Rollie, that shit invisble
You niggas hold your nuts on Super like it's a physical
I spray two hundred out the streets, it ain't no miracle
You never missed a run on them J's, that's typical
I got on five chains and I feel like a criminal
When you in the streets, it's all about principle
Took tan in Magic City, this shit turned invisible

[Chorus: Super Nard]
Invisible, invisible
I'm somethin' you niggas ain't seein', man I'm invisible
Invisible, invisible
I'm like where my roof went? is it invisible?
Invisible, invisible
I'm known to make 'em disappear like they invisible
Invisible, invisible
And all my diamonds crystal clear like they invisible

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
To my haters I'm invisible, niggas ain't seein' me with a telescope
Pumpin' gas, Texaco, spittin' dumb bars, radio
I be runnin' with thugs
Shooters who wet a nigga like a flood, yeah
I'm ballin', lil boy you a scrub
You can't see me, I'm up here with dubs
Yeah, I'm stuntin', I'm stuntin', I'm stuntin', yeah
They ain't see this shit comin', nah
Last year I was broke, yeah
Now a nigga get money, hey
Aston Martin, watch it take off
I'm in a foreign coupe with my shirt off
I put that work in the hood, watch it get off, yeah
Playin' with me, you can get took off, yeah
Name ringing like some bells
I'm dope like I'm fresh off a scale
My Rollie is glistening, my chain is pissing
My cars, they shittin', I'm just a street nigga with an image
You not a street nigga, you a gimmick
Bread Gang, I'm the lieutenant, yeah

[Chorus: Super Nard]
Invisible, invisible
I'm somethin' you niggas ain't seein', man I'm invisible
Invisible, invisible
I'm like where my roof went? is it invisible?
Invisible, invisible
I'm known to make 'em disappear like they invisible
Invisible, invisible
And all my diamonds crystal clear like they invisible

[Verse 3: Doe B]
Boy it's young Doe, AKA mister invisible
I'm know to break them bitches down like they syllables
Give a fuck how much he sold, I made a million juggs
Electronic wire house, I got so many plugs
I'm known to make 'em disappear like they Houdini nigga
The plug just say he dropped them off, I'm like who seen 'em nigga?
A hundred cars pullin' up, my hood like Phoenix nigga
Hot as fuck, come try your luck, we shootin' like Phoenix nigga
Steve Nash with that pack, on your point guard
Responsible for all that traffic on that boulevard
A hundred shots will send a nigga's car to pull apart
My car ain't got no fuckin' top like it got pulled apart
These tattletale ass niggas tryna end me
You Hellen Keller ass niggas ain't seein' me
I'm Roger Federer lil nigga, you can't compete with me
Niggas with ambition, NWA, rest in peace Eazy E

[Chorus: Super Nard]
Invisible, invisible
I'm somethin' you niggas ain't seein', man I'm invisible
Invisible, invisible
I'm like where my roof went? is it invisible?
Invisible, invisible
I'm known to make 'em disappear like they invisible
Invisible, invisible
And all my diamonds crystal clear like they invisible
