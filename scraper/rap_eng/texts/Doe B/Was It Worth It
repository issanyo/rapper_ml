[Verse 1: Doe B]
Aye, How you been doin girl, I'm just checkin on ya
And I ain't calling just to call, I got some questions for ya
I know my lifestyle right now, a little too extra for ya
Rather see you blessed than see you stressed, that shit ain't healthy for ya
That's too much pressure on ya, baby [?]
All we did was fuss, fight 'til you screamed fuck life
Separate all day, make up and fuck at night
I ain't gon' lie, that pussy fire cause you so motion tight
And yeah it's more than life than bright lights, cars and clothes
But how can I complain, it's the life I chose
Shit'll never be the same cause I'm far too gone
Why every time I said "I love you", you said you loved me more(cause you deserve [?] more)

[Hook: Doe B]
Ayeeee, I rather leave you 'fore I hurt you girl
You ever need me, just come search, you girl
But through it all was it worth it girl?
Tell me, was it worth it girl?
Ayeeee, we make mistakes, ain't no one perfect girl
You can do better, you deserve the world
But through it all was it worth it girl?
Tell me, Was it worth it girl?
Ayeeee

[Verse 2: Doe B]
And you were clothing me just like my mama, clothing me just like my sister
And ever since we been apart, I can't lie, I miss you
But like the candy in the [?], [?] be with ya
But I done upgraded my screen, I see the bigger picture
Cause you deserve much more than a hood nigga
I just hit you up to really see what's good with ya
Like how yo family doin'? How yo kids? How yo parents doin'?
Matter of fact, shit, how yo man doin'?
Immature on my behalf but i'm still growin'
Lookin' at what I could've had and you still gorgeous
I just hope he treat you right, eat you right
You know I can't wait until I see you right

[Hook: Doe B]
Ayeeee, I rather leave you 'fore I hurt you girl
You ever need me, just come search, you girl
But through it all was it worth it girl?
Tell me, was it worth it girl?
Ayeeee, we make mistakes, ain't no one perfect girl
You can do better, you deserve the world
But through it all was it worth it girl?
Tell me, Was it worth it girl?
Ayeeee
