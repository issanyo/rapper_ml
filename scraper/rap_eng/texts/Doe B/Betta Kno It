[Intro]
Amp me up, little nigga
Real recognize real, money recognize money
And if you gain money nigga, you know money when you see it nigga
You betta know it, nigga
See me on Hustle Gang, you know what it is nigga

[Hook x2]
I'm a young nigga getting money, better know it
Bank roll full of them a hundred, better know it
Watch costs a car I ain't frontin', better know it
Imma walk in a star, that's nothin', better know it
Brand new yacht with a honey, better know it
Them niggas just talkin', they don't want it, better know it
Sparkles on the bottle keep 'em comin', better know it
Blow a hundred thousand it ain't nothin', better know it

[Verse 1]
I'm a dead man walkin'
Cause I keep a lot of dead presidents on me
I ain't rich, homie, but I'm gettin' rich, homie
S550, AMG kit on me
Your whip should have been foreign
Your bitch ain't she should have been foreign
She like girls, I like girls, we got a lot in common
She only fuck with me cause I get a lot of money
But if you got it, ain't tricki
Lil' nigga, I got it, I ain't trippin'
One show, get it back, thirty minutes
Do a show, blow the rest, thirty minutes
Fuckin' with the big booty hoes
In the strip club, throwing money to her clothes
Cuban link around my collar, I'm a big dawg
Nigga listen to seattle, what the fuck are those?
Imma take a trip out to Mexico
Tell Pablo I'm back to sellin' dope
Imma pour a four can't catch a cold
And I'm iced up like an Eskimo
Real diamonds on my wrist, look!
This this type of shit that get yo' bitch took
Thousand dollar frame D cutter (yeaaaaah)
And if he do the same he a hunter too

[Hook x2]

[Verse]
I'm a young nigga with a check
I'm a young nigga with respect
A hard head leave a pussy wet
Shoot this bitch up like Durant
For 0's in his back like an Audi
Whole brick on your head, that's a bounty
My nigga won't spend a night in the county
Keep a fine lawyer like Jenny Corry
Self made nigga, no co-signs
Fifty racks on the AP, no dimes
I ain't frontin' baby don't goes right
Cause the plug throwin' balls like an old lime
Mixin' purple with the yellow like a Laker, nigga
The Nelson Mandella, I ain't bassin' nigga
AK47 with no safety nigga
Aimin' at your head like a safety nigga
Love the white girl, I ain't wristin' nigga
All you dead white, I need a cemetery
Blowin' money like a crazy nigga
I just spent 80 racks and I ain't finished
Ridin' clean, but I'm slippin' dirty
I got caught up with tha whole pint
Got a little nigga livin' careless
Wanna know what your ho think ?
