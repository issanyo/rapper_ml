[Intro: Doe B]
Make sure you have heart 'fore you stab it in a fight

[Hook: Doe B]
Ye' ain't 'bout where you from, nigga's 'bout you back
Make sure you have heart 'fore you stab it in a fight
Give a young nigga a gun, he going to shoot or get shot
Dawg and all these nigga's crunk, won't be able to get got

It's an eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
[x2]

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Yeah, welcome to the concrete jungle
What tomorrow ain't promise
And nigga's shoot choppa's like jumpa's
Well, if you fake you get ate like lasagna
Nigga, these the streets that controlled by us youngsters
Twenty-five and under
In the great words of Sunny Cash, "Respect your minors."
If ye' ain't 'bout that life, it don't take a scientist
To figure out you need to take a different route
Can't wait 'til that day that they let my nigga's out
Real nigga's out
Sometimes you get put in a lose-lose situation
Kill or be killed, gray yard or probation

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trenacote Shawty]
Eye for an eye, brother got shot
Long night, cold days, thugging on the block
[?] got to keep a Glock
Yes, weigh my dough, if you really want to shop
Remember, I had none, bitches wouldn't stop
Now I'm on top, bitches coming by the flock
Me and Doe Beezy got the streets on lock
Don't play with them young'uns, they'll set you on fire
Nigga, I don't lie, and numbers don't lie
Before I was rapping, I was living that life
Couple nigga's left me, and these bitches ain't right
Got to watch these haters, cause they living so sheisty

[Hook]
