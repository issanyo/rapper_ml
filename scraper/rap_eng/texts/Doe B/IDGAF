(Intro)
Bolo and I don’t give a fuck my nigga
I’mma go in on you, shit my nigga
I don’t give a fuck how you feel about it my nigga
Real talk

(Verse)
I don’t give a fuck
I come straight out of Montgomery, they label us as country
I bet before next summer hit, I bet I'm in some foreign shit
I hear you niggas mumbling cos you niggas ain’t talk bout shit
And don’t think you got away my nigga cos you still on my list
100 shots, 2 empty clips will make a nigga corner flip
You niggas in training camp, yo boy talkin on the shit
You niggas is dreamin, that’s yo boy tryna own this ship
80 carats in this watch got the feds on to him
Causing pandemonium
Going crazy with them racks
No, ain’t no controlling him
Bags of petroleum, that’s gas for you slower niggas
Pull up, I don’t know where this bitch and I act like I don’t know the nigga
When they see you on yo shit they actin like you owe a nigga
They don’t owe you niggas shit but 4 words – I told you, nigga
Yea, I don’t give a fuck
White fuck, why you rub your fore yo bitch give her up, boy?

(Hook)
I just blow the whole check and I don’t give a fuck
Hit the club and made a mess and I don’t give a fuck
On my wrist a whole brick and I don’t give a fuck
I’m still fuckin up the chick and I don’t give a fuck
I hear some niggas wanted with me, I don’t give a fuck
I got 100 niggas with me, man don’t give a fuck
If I go you comin with me, I don’t give a fuck
So if you want me come and get me, I don’t give a fuck

(Verse)
I don’t give a fuck my nigga
All that pillow talkin nigga
And I’m on right now, it ain’t shit to off you nigga
Play I let them killers loose, the K will knock your engine loose
You know money and murder go together like gin and juice
The difference between me and you
You’re not about it, I’m all about it
Chop up bricks and run the CD on, you know who run Montgomery
Everything shoot 100, nigga clear the whole set
Give yo bitch a orgasm, even leave yo hoe wet
Give a fuck if you’re rich, turn yo ghost to a holy ghost
Took so many shots, I swear to God I probably overdosed
Took so many shots cos nigga should have a portfolio
Now smile for yo picture
And if I want ya I could get ya nigga

(Hook)
I just blow the whole check and I don’t give a fuck
Hit the club and made a mess and I don’t give a fuck
On my wrist a whole brick and I don’t give a fuck
I’m still fuckin up the chick and I don’t give a fuck
I hear some niggas wanted with me, I don’t give a fuck
I got 100 niggas with me, man don’t give a fuck
If I go you comin with me, I don’t give a fuck
So if you want me come and get me, I don’t give a fuck
