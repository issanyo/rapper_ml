[Verse 1: Doe B]
Aye, I know drug lords, I know kingpins
Only time we conversate is when them things in
If I text you, we like [?] then I need ten
I came from a small city but I dream big
Now European, that's what we in
And yesterday I made a play, over at the sleep-in
A hundred days in a daze, watch yo money do some shit so amazing, you wouldn't believe it
A bitch can give me nothin' but head, I call her Beavis
I pledge allegiance, play with me, I'll call a shooter
Hear so many gunshots, you think we playin' that Call Of Duty
And that money keep on callin' me, shit, I feel like Pookie
Bigger than Nino, bigger than Pacino
Bigger than Tony Montana, nigga, I'm the el negro
I'm Dan Marino with a kilo bag in the 80's
OJ Simpson bloodline, born white girl crazy
Pushin' the Mercedes with a bitch named Kaylie
A whole brick of smack in her bag, this is base, before Dre Beats
From MIA to the AZ, I'm paid in full like I'm Acey
And tell Calvin don't play me, I'll shoot this bitch up like KD
Okay, see, I told ya, woke 'em up like Folgers
If you ain't gon' use 'em nigga, what's the use of havin' soldiers
Got the real on my shoulder, I went from [?] boulders
And one night, I took flight, like a young Kobe, sellin' Lamar Odom
In the hood, I got stripes, like I'm barcoded and these niggas all roguish so
Watch your clique, watch your bitch, watch the dice
Watch your mouth, say the wrong thing on the phone and get life
My watch gon' get me deathrow, I think I'm Suge Knight
I'm Baby Jesus, ever seen a nigga cook ice
If gettin' money wrong baby, I don't even look right
If hatin' was a crime, you niggas should get booked twice
