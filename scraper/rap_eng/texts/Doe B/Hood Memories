[Verse 1]
I’m still that lil nigga from Cloverland
All I wanted was to know the man
Seen fiends smoking out the soda can
Seen niggas fuck about 400 band
Ridin in ridgecrest it ain't never safe
If you from Circle K, then you forever straight
I woke up told my mom, we gone see better days
She say she heard that same shit yesterday
Man I’mma keep going hard for my daughter’s sake
Every first of the month for me's a holiday
I told my teacher fuck a job I’m selling that rock today
I’m in the streets with no breaks, ain’t no stopping me
And all the real niggas round the world gone vouch for me
Sometimes I feel like somebody watching me
That why I can’t go nowhere without this Glock on me?
If I die tonight just bury me with G’s on top of me

[Hook]
And these is all my hood memories
Since a little man I’ve been a G
Tonight if the lord so happen send for me
Just cover me in Gucci bury me a G
I know some niggas still out here hatin on me
But I’mma get this money, I can’t let em get to me
And the day I leave the world they gon remember me
Just cover me in Gucci bury me a G

[Verse 2]
And I’m still the same nigga
Trying to numb my feelings popping pain killers
Going through so much, you'll go insane nigga
Nigga all these bigger targets, fuck the fame nigga
Fuck the fame
I live the real life
Boy ain’t nobody untouchable
You'll get killed tonight
I’ve been through so much and man I got real stripes
You niggas wouldn’t know what sacrifice would even feel like
What it feel like
I went from rag to riches
From fuckin hood rats to fuckin the baddest bitches
Put the city on my back and started evidently
Man I ain’t lookin for recognition, I woundn't recommend it
I’m tryin to catch a million
Cause I got bigger problems
Streets talkin, niggas plottin
My own nigga robbed me
Shit real on my side
But if I shoot you on brainless
If you shoot me you famous
Just separate the real from fake and you will see who remained

[Hook]
And these is all my hood memories
Since a little man I’ve been a G
Tonight if the lord so happen send for me
Just cover me in Gucci bury me a G
I know some niggas still out here hatin on me
But I’mma get this money, I can’t let em get to me
And the day I leave leave this world they gon remember me
Just cover me in Gucci bury me a G
