[Hook: Doe B]
Burglar bar doors on a brick house
All the shit I've sold, I should be in a big house
Don't I put you in the mind of a trapper?
Don't I put you in the mind of a trapper?
Dropped out of school, said, "Fuck class, how much a split cost?"
Give me sixth cost and a [?] how much a brick cost?
Don't I put you in the mind of a trapper?
Don't I put you in the mind of a trapper?

[Verse 1: Doe B]
They say never say never
But I never told, never fold
Never lie to these niggas [?]
If I said best believe I either been around, seen it, or done it
So believe me when I say you don't want it
Just being honest, one of the realest that done it
Got these streets now, mission accomplished
Cars, clothes, dope, bitches, and money
Thousand grand around my neck, solid gold medallions
Don't I put you in the mind of a trapper?
First of the month, trap jumping like it's Kris Kross
The first time I hit the road, I took a big loss
And it wasn't even my dope, I just had big balls
I swear I thought a nigga told, I was like shit, dawg
Lost everything I had, down on my dick, dawg
Bought a [?] like Vic [?]
Small thing to a giant, I'm a big dog
And if I'm lying, shh, my momma a bitch, yo

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 2: Super Nard]
I've been trapping
I've been trapping, trapping
I've been trapping, trapping
Told Doe to give me twenty minutes
He say that what happened
I've been smoking, police pull up on me
They going to snatch it, snatch it
They go from thirty through your piece
[?]
Don't I put you in the mind of a trapper?
'Migos in the pack, we bust it out the wrapper
Real street nigga, I am not an actor
I hear you nigga hate but you are not a factor
You smell that? We sell that
Doe B, where the scale at?
I ain't talking tacos, when I ask you where them bales at
Super gnawed in the kitchen, whipping three stoves
All the clientele got me working three phones
