[Hook]
Maserati coupe, I'm the truth
Also with no roof, I'm the truth
These fake ass rappers know I'm the truth
In and out the booth, I'm the truth
Yeah, you can tell the way I'm shining, I'm the truth
Nigga, these real diamonds, I'm the truth
Everything on me designer, I'm the truth
These other niggas lying, I'm the truth

[Verse 1]
I'm truth like [?]
Not a bootlegger, but I got to keep a burner
You play, I'm shooting at you like a motherfucking backboard
Y'all niggas asked for it, doing the whole dash, boy
Screaming, "Fuck the task force"
Fuck the DEA, fuck the MPD
I'm Derrick Rose in the rose bowl, I'm MVP
Got more bottles than a new born, choppers we got two on
[?]
Y'all niggas lukewarm, I'm fire hot
My knees are sky high, too low on my side
Squares like an iPod, connect it like WiFi
So lil' nigga, why try? You can't stop my shine
The motherfucking truth

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the truth like Paul Pierce
[?]
My bitch all real, you niggas not at all real
The truth don't tell lies, you niggas is lies
[?] eighty-five just to kill time
Real ice in my watches, real ice in my necklace
I put so many chains on bitches thought I was [?]
And I got real road runners, and I am the mailman
All my pass touchdowns, I have no interceptions
You smell it we sell it, kush come from Cali'
And Sacramento, I know where them bales at
Niggas jealous, yeah cause we [?]
[?] now get your whole career wiped out

[Hook]
