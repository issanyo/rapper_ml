[Verse 1:Doe B]
I come straight up out the bottom
Have 50 with dope fiends and robbers
Every nigga on my team got a choppa
Screamin for fuck the coppas, head bustin and fed duckin
All we know, all we know
30 round, LA shit, that’s all we know
Play, we get seen about
Take in a SK in the Sweeney house
50 pounds in the backyard, watching out for the jack boys
Jump in the task force
I’d like to welcome yall to ridgecrest
And those old niggas round me still there
Its Cote Block to my very last breath
When my granny died, I think that’s when I shed my last tear nigga
You don’t feel how I feel cos you don’t live how I live nigga
And I got hundrin in my blood uh
Got bricks all in my crib nigga(Free my uncle)
Wut you know bout having bricks in your crib nigga
Talking so many you can build a crib nigga
Lil nigga

[Hook]
Hustling baby is all we know
Blinded by these cars and clothes
These streets got me caught up in this place
Tryna make it out and maintain

[Verse 2: Trenacote Shawty]
Everyday trap house
Trenacote, got them pounds in the masc
Can’t serve without a get go
I bought that murda nawf back out
We was standing in the hallways
Duckin feds, servin Js
R.I.P Lil Mike, they had to take that boy away
Then why everytime you see my people throw away?
Posted in the cut with the cut always
And I am a Murk nigga, rest in peace Jerry
I know these niggas wanna see me on the T-shirt
They wanna see me fall, but I land feet first
Don’t wanna see me ball bitch but I get work
Circle K gas station, we don't smoke purp
All I blow is OG, kush and sip syrup
Trenacote Shawty, thee project baby
Prodigal of my environment, cause the bricks made me

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Doe B]
Caught up in the game like a maze
Come out first thing, bought a chain and a case so a nigga start hatin
Go get em out the way, 81 lawyers
So forget about the case and we can keep thuggin
There’s a pistol on your waist
Let 'em know that mister don’t play and mister don’t miss
Cause case don’t jail, real niggas don’t snitch
With the fully automatic, wiping out yo whole key yea
I know niggas on the road on a very long trip
I know niggas sold they soul homie just to look rich
If it ain’t bout money then you know it’s bullshit
When them shoes get ugly that when niggas pull tricks
I’ve been round niggas thuggin ever since I was a legit
Since a juvenile I’ve been getting it how I live
When father get a job, nigga I will pay bills
You can say a couple raw boys, see me shootin real
I need to wrap it, nigga

[Hook]

The streets is so hot
The streets is so hot
We tryna make it out there
We tryna make it out there
But hustling is all we know
Blinded by the cars and clothes
