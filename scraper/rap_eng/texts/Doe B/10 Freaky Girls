[Omar Benson Miller]
Ten freaky girls, inside The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me, you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimping ain't easy
Anything goes, when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin, when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me girl, say what up doe
Ten freaky girls, ten, ten, ten freaky girls

[Intro: Doe B]
Ten freaky girls, and they all goin' hammer
Ten freaky girls, we recordin'?
I got ten freak girls
Ten freaky girls

[Hook: Doe B]
I got ten freaky girls, and they all on molly
[?]
I got ten freak girls, outside in the lobby
Ten freaky girls, ten freaky girls
I got ten freaky girls, poppin' pills, goin' gnarly
And they love to twerk, they the life of the party
I got ten freaky girls, takin' shots, pussy poppin'
Ten freaky girls, ten freaky girls

[Verse 1: Doe B]
I got ten freaky girls, and they all goin' hammer
Especially Lil Ebony, can't forget about Samantha
And Lil Ashley keep exting me, cause she's a party animal
Love a young nigga, cause a kid got stamina
Morgan she so gorgeous, and she go to Morgan State
And whenever I'm at Morgan State, the kid get more than eight
And Tory got a porsche, and my lil' shorty, she get cake
And she so freaky, she just love to see me skeet and porsche her face
And Letici is so freaky, she want dick, when she say feed me
And LaToya pussy game water, man, I call her Fiji
Peaches keep that pussy skeetin', got to see it to believe it
And my lil' [?] she's a nympho and a teacher

[Hook]

[Verse 2: OG Phee]
You know I'm fresh as hell, when I step up in the party
And my name ain't deez, bitches know that I get money
We got bottles over here, tell the waitress keep 'em coming
I got ten freaky girls, dancing like they working on it
I got ten freaky girls, they the life of the party
I got ten freaky girls, shakin' ass and pussy poppin'
If they want to go to that world, I'm a put 'em on that molly
Probably sniffing on the low, that's how they pay they way through college
I got ten freaky girls, with tattoos all on they body
I got ten freaky girls, and they down to get it poppin'
I got ten freaky girls, got enough for eveybody
It ain't trickin' if you got it, pass on to my nigga, Johnny
