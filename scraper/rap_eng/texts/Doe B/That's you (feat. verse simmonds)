The baddest bitch up in the club right now, that's you
Come in here, catchin eyes, ain't no lookin past you
If I'd be other hoes I swear I'd be mad too
The way you climbin up that pole and how you make that ass move
Sexy face, narrow waist, long hair, tattoo
Got me falling for your love, think I need a parachute
Will you be my Cinderella, girl you with it, that's you
The baddest bitch up in the club right now, that's you

(Verse)
I met this chick over in Flinders, said her name was Foxy
Drive a Maserati, got a bangin body
The way she climbin up that pole just like she know karate
She know I'm makin profit, the way she pussy poppin
And starving ain't a option, bitch go take this molly
With me on my island girl, you should be a model
Gotta be my main bitch, you can't be my side hoe
So why do I feel my brain shake, Shawty up in my mind going through

(Hook)
The baddest bitch up in the club right now, that's you
Come in here, catchin eyes, ain't no lookin past you
If I'd be other hoes I swear I'd be mad too
The way you climbin up that pole and how you make that ass move
Sexy face, narrow waist, long hair, tattoo
Got me falling for your love, think I need a parachute
Will you be my Cinderella, girl you with it, that's you
The baddest bitch up in the club right now, that's you

(Verse)
I met this bitch over at Magic's, say her name was Jasmin
Classics but she nasty, I love she be splashin
Uh she so flexible like she took gymnastics
She sexy and she edible, I eat er like she candy
She snatch it and she grab it, beat it til I skeet it
Then she catch it like she ran, she don't need no practice
Down there baby ratchet, I can't lie I love er
The baddest bitch up in the club and putting on hoes bubble

(Hook)
The baddest bitch up in the club right now, that's you
Come in here, catchin eyes, ain't no lookin past you
If I'd be other hoes I swear I'd be mad too
The way you climbin up that pole and how you make that ass move
Sexy face, narrow waist, long hair, tattoo
Got me falling for your love, think I need a parachute
Will you be my Cinderella, girl you with it, that's you
The baddest bitch up in the club right now, that's you

(Verse)
I wonder if those ass shots
They don't really matter
All I speak is moola, I don't need Rosetta
I could fuck you better, hop into my Jaguar
Fuck me in the backseat (na na na na)
Man I got that smoke, all I need now is a light
And you got a man but you fuckin me tonight
And I don't usually do this but it's double cup and Sprite
She say she don't usually do this but we cut the first night

(Hook)
The baddest bitch up in the club right now, that's you
Come in here, catchin eyes, ain't no lookin past you
If I'd be other hoes I swear I'd be mad too
The way you climbin up that pole and how you make that ass move
Sexy face, narrow waist, long hair, tattoo
Got me falling for your love, think I need a parachute
Will you be my Cinderella, girl you with it, that's you
The baddest bitch up in the club right now, that's you
