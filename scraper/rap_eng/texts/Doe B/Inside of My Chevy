[Intro: Doe B]
Ran up all them numbers
Got the kid a trap scholarship
Wanna feel some hollow tips
I suggest you not to trip
Not with us Irene Kush
I serve many pounds of it

[Verse 1:Ether]
Police charges I be dodging
I leave challengers starving
Sunrock worth more than ya mercury
Alabama niggas bleed burgundy
State of emergency get this currency
It ain’t safe to let your girl see, insecurities
In a box Chevy like Malvo
Rifle on me and a bad hoe
Fuel you up like gasco
Niggas talk but they mad broke
I say less and I get mo’
Talk ya bitch out a bank roll
Name a hood where I can’t go
I don’t think you niggas slang dope
I’m the real deal Holyfield
You can tell how I hold the steel
Never did no drive-by
Hopping out with the iron out
We got problems I’m a iron em’out
You hating nigga, let me find out
Signed to the streets until the
Day a nigga sign out
Rap nigga need a A&R
Street nigga keep a AR
Can tell I’m out here it ain’t hard
I don’t know about y’all
Respect in this rap shit
Ether my name
But in the trap bitch
I’m still big daddy kane

[Chorus: Ether]
Still moving fish scales
Still riding Chevrolet
Still putting Ether on the scale
Making hella’ plays
Like the Chevy emblem
I’m just adding up
It’s a plus my nigga
I’m still adding up
Still moving fish scales
Still riding Chevrolet
Still putting Ether on the scale
Making hella’ plays
I’m still adding up
I’m still adding up

[Verse 2: Doe B]
(Yeah, what’s happening Ether)
Walking like a baller
Coogi pockets filled with guala
Dropped 650 got a
Thing for them pradas
Shit what you expect hoe
I came from the bottom
Used to hang in them projects
Serving caine got me profits
Guala on my mind dog
I think I need counseling
Gotta weigh it on the scale
Ain’t no need a’ countin’ it
They say money talk
So I tell them look around me
DUB floaters got em askin’
Where the ground went
Box Chevy mounted up
Franklin Jackson count em up
All I talk is numbers and yo’
Conversation not enough
Like my pockets left a Tyson
Fight they way the knotted up
That way got me Prada’d up
And I keep the 40 tucked
Mathematic nerd what
The fuck I need college for
Ran up all them numbers
Got the kid a trap scholarship
Wanna feel some hollow tips
I suggest you not to trip
Not with us Irene Kush
I serve many pounds of it


[Chorus: Ether]
Still moving fish scales
Still riding Chevrolet
Still putting Ether on the scale
Making hella’ plays
Like the Chevy emblem
I’m just adding up
It’s a plus my nigga
I’m still adding up
Still moving fish scales
Still riding Chevrolet
Still putting Ether on the scale
Making hella’ plays
I’m still adding up
I’m still adding up
