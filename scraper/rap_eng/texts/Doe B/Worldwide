(Verse 1, Scotty ATL)
Started out as a local, I got my eyes on the top, they tried to count me out, push da game to the limit, I was flat broke so I got on my business, coupe is spaghetti the guts is cheese, I need dat Parmesan on da daily, if it's bout family nigga or my money, den I suggest that a nigga not play me, I got an affinity for no roof, kno how dem young niggas do, rocking a car note a shoe, hoping the cops don't shoot, get u some popcorn foo, I done went Scotty Spielberg, I needa bank full of birds, I cannot wait until the first, all of dem junkies gone get served, ask around nigga certified, Popeyes wit the dirty rice, wat u said nigga clarify it, beat the block nigga for a milly, I get cheap numbers  on the ticket, for I stick it babygirl lick it, now the groupies wanna smoke n kick it... 

(Hook)

I look into my lil girls eyes, provide for them that mean the world now, they never tell u bout the downside, back stabbing friends I'm in my zone now, I smoke my own shit by the zone, so many fake friends they hit my phone now, feel like I'm never at my home now, chasing dat bag I'm on the road now, 
Fill up that sack again, cloud IX by the p, big biz nigga see, ran the play to a tee, u gone twenty yards u gone slant, bitches be itching kicking off they pants, she ain't let me finish rolling tree, they ain't even let me finish being me, they tried to slow me down bitch I'm worldwide
