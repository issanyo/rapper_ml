[Intro]
Shawty just hit my phone, said he tryna cop a chicken
Like I own a farm, man I say this nigga trippin
Talkin too wreckless hell, just tell me what you spendin
Hope it ain't less than 30 cuz I really want Scotty Pippen nigga

33, a 33
But I'll take a shit cuz you fuck with ne
Consistant clientele , pyrex pots and scales
Serve you like you Taco Bell, yea but we got block of bails
Yo plug cannot compare, I got Walmart numbers
Cutless in the air, stand up like a Hummer
I just killed the summer, bout to kill the winter
30 bricks goin for 30 a piece wrapped up in the sprinter

[Hook]
I just bought a cutless and I sat that bitch on 30
Diamonds in my necklace and this Rollie cost me 30
Shawty I ain’t flexin, for protection we tote 30's
If you wanna brick it then the ticket gon be 30 piece
30 piece, 30 piece (I’m talkin 30 piece)
30 piece, 30 piece (I’m talkin 30 piece)
Bricks go for 30
Chevy sittin on 30's
All we tote is 30’s
Brand new Rollie 30

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, still tired and yawnin
Somebody rung my doorbell, with bails on my doorstep
That’s what I call a doorbell
30 minutes they were out of here

Ran threw 1000 bails
Like dat shit was nine holmes
I know 30 mexicans and I got 30 cellphones
Feds tryna peep a nigga map spot
But they can't connect the dots cos I got 30 trap spots
I got 30 missed calls
Damn, that coulda been bout 30 bricks gone

Bet that round on my hip bone
Play with me and less than 30 seconds the whole clip gone


[Hook]
I just bought a cutless and I sat that bitch on 30
Diamonds in my necklace and this Rollie cost me 30
Shawty I ain’t flexin, for protection we tote 30's
If you wanna brick it then the ticket gon be 30 piece
30 piece, 30 piece (I’m talkin 30 piece)
30 piece, 30 piece (I’m talkin 30 piece)
Bricks go for 30
Chevy sittin on 30's
All we tote is 30’s
Brand new Rollie 30
