[Intro: DJ Scream]
As long as DJ Scream right here
As long as Bigga Rankin right here
Frank White
The whole world needs to know
Doe B gon’ live forever


[Verse 1: Doe B]
Hey
I’m talkin’ half time
H-Town, half a brick sh*t
Remix, in the drought
Get you rich sh*t
Who got it? They got it, we yellin’
That hit a lick sh*t
Show a monkey ass n*gga
How a banana splits sh*t
Fifty rounds, hundred rounds
That’s that drum sh*t
Band practice
F*ck around and get your dome hit
By starin’ at me
I’m paranoid like I’m on it
Sold so many bricks, I f*ck around
And make your home flip
Real estate
F*ck where you’re from, I’m from a realer state
Fish fillet, fish scale
Boy, that’s killer yay
Weigh your white
Then pull up on you with a pillowcase
And sell you some
You getting’ money, nigga tell me something


[Interlude: Doe B]
Hey, ya’ll n*ggas gettin’ money out there or what n*gga?
(N*ggas not gettin’ no money, man)
Huh? Let me know somethin’, boy
(I don’t believe these n*ggas, brah)
Hey, I see you n*ggas
(Real talk!)
Hahaha! You seem on sh*t for real though, n*gga (for real!)
On Ma!


[Verse 2: Doe B]
I’m talkin’ Circle K
Been straight, n*gga Court Street
Irene, sour Dees, n*gga O.G
Shop with me
All the real n*ggas know me
They f*ck with me
Ask about me, boy I got the streets
Stupid clientele got my name ringin’ bells
Got a Cali plug for real
Say the word, he’s breakin’ bails
I got birds, I got squares
Pull up on ya with some sh*t
Get caught with this, you gettin’ an L
If you’re scared, say you’re scared
Every night I say my prayers
Cross my heart, hope they don’t tell
If you catch the wrong cell
You might end up in a cell
Cocaine paraphernal’
Get your ass some long years
B*tch n*ggas never graduated
Get more money than a mil

B*tch it’s trap life!
What you n*ggas know about it?
Yea, act like it
These n*ggas ain’t ‘bout no violence
Talkin’ ‘bout them killers
These n*ggas ain’t catchin’ no bodies
Boy, you get your issue
I ain’t talkin’ magazines either
A hundred pages
I ain’t talkin’ magazines neither
That AK sh*t
Everything we tote illegal
That mayday sh*t
Let’s call it quits, these n*ggas evil
Cold turkey
I’ll turn this b*tch to Thanksgiving
Back with no mercy
Hot sh*t straight out the kitchen
Let it burn like Hershel
And that choppa got rhythm
It don’t skip a beat
You laid up in a hospital
‘Till your sh*t go bee-eee-p

F*ck n*gga, trick or treat!
In your house with the mask
Like it’s time to eat
Come on hurry with them bags
My lil’ n*ggas starvin’
And they’re preyin’ on a body
With no holy water
God damn, these n*ggas violent (sh*t!)


[Outro: Doe B]
Yea
Come up off that, my n*gga
(Let me get that)
We have to take what’s ours, n*gga (huh?)
So whoever says they’ve got the street (who got the streets, n*gga?)
You know what I mean?
You need that, right now, A.S.A.P., n*gga (pronto!)
See me on television getting’ money, n*gga

This sh*t right here (haha!)
They ain’t gon’ like this sh*t
(On my life?), n*gga
Hey!
