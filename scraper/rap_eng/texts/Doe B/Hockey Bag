[Hook: Doe B]
A half a million dollars in a hockey bag
Your bitch want me 'cause I got a lot of cash
Forgiato wheels got me ice skatin'
Why you niggas spend yo' whole life hatin'?
A half a million dollars in a hockey bag
Got your bitch pussy popping on a handstand
Blue ray clear diamonds got my ice skatin'
Then why you niggas spend yo whole life hatin'?

[Verse 1: Doe B]
I walked in the spot like I’m Wayne Gretzky
Hockey bag filled up with dead prezzies (presidents)
Blow so much money got the feds guessing
Wipe my face with a hundred like my head’s sweatin'
Blow my nose with a 20, it ain’t nothing to me
Nothing but G’s on my mind like a Gucci scully
This a hockey bag baby, this ain’t Louis nothing
Your whole wardrobe fugazy
That ain’t Louis nothing
And if them diamonds ain’t dancing you ain’t doin' nothing
I’m going Patrick Swayze crazy, VVSs busting
If all the cash ain’t fit we gon turkey stuffin'
And call that shit Thanksgiving when we throw that (throw that shit)

[Hook x2

[Verse 2: DJ Scream]
Got hoes like Tom Brady
Got cash like rainy baby
That hockey bag, no pesos
Bankroll, smackin' hoes like Wayne Brady
Rolls gold, that Mercedes skatin'
Hulk Hogan, my swisha blazin'
My swisha blazin', I’m kickin' flavor
No champagne but I’m ace of spadin' like that (like that)
But why you niggas spend yo' whole life mad?
You stay popping feelings, we stay popping price tags
A couple zips to me is really just a light pack
If you feeling how I'm feelin', nigga, where yo lighters at?
On that fire gas if you light a match it might kill ya
Michael Myers mash, you should fire back
I’m that nigga
Yeah she check my swag, she and me hopping pads on that liquor
'Cause we sure ain’t no average niggas
Leave out the show with a half a million
