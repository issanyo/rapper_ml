[Chorus:]
I got a molly house
A men house
Exotic house
A brick house
And all four numbers
I got a molly house
A men house
Exotic house
A brick house
My cell phone jumpin
I got a molly house
A men house
Exotic house
A brick house
My door man jockin
I got a molly house
A men house
Exotic house
A brick house
And all four numbers

[Verse 1:]
I got four traps on one street
With candle lit like my aunty
Them blood niggas at the stop sign they watching out for the jump street
Get a job, don’t speak
Silent niggas remain concrete
One basement one key, turn thirty thousand into a hundred G’s
Ever seen them brick a mine, ever seen umbrella kush
Have you ever seen a eighteens with a truck pull up in the hood
With a hundred thousand LBs yo we call em elbows
Tell me when you ever seen a Colombian with a negro
An he don’t speak no English all he talking Euros
An I don’t speak Spanish either all I talk is dineros, clero per coat
Cocaine in my coke house
Only time we drink pepsi is when it’s a drought, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Got four houses ya’ll gettin any them
[?] for Parliament
Falling out for a pile a gas
Little niggas, what you trying to think
I’m in the brick ya’ll cooking up
Every boy having fun ya’ll
Trust doing a number
[?]
They big booming like the boulevard
Got big booming on the boulevard
Try shit [?]
Got a [?] pile for the county boy
Got the good pile pumping like it’s hard
Better watch out for the [?]
Son can’t be screaming, we got a few more spots nigga
Got a men house, got a mali house, got a brick house, got a gas house
Matter fact we got five houses
Can’t forget about the stash house
They come in they cash out
Don’t pass in don’t pass out
I don’t get dope in the mali house
Bitch I might just pass out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Pull up to the greenhouse
Where I keep the money, in the room like a bank
On the walls fulla honies
Crack house down the street, jumpin doin numbers
Gotta get it how you live in concrete jungle
Eyes never fold, devil vote
Got a house in Tijuana
Three storey lounge house with the elevator
Every floor different flavours
I got guards I got papers
Pull up to the mali house, erybody
House full of quarter pieces, everybody freaky
CB and my team, nigga you know we eattin
Boomin at the house
Trappin like
