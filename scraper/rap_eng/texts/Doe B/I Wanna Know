[Intro: Raekwon]
Real niggas in the house
You already know
Niggas sit down and play pool and shit
Relax
What niggas don't know inside the muthafucking
Pool balls is nothing but blow
We gettin' money nigga. You already know boy
Toast off nigga lets go man c'mon

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Raised off a knucklehead block, you know the pattern
Black Reeboks all day, let's be it captain
Posing in ostrich, woolrich Galoshes
Clear gazelles crush diamonds in the boxes
Wave game spiral, sneaker game rival
Front on me, see twenty-four Caligos
Drug niggas I hang with, hold up let me change shit
Feds is listening, calicoes rang quick
Thugs blow alcohol, white bitches, tap'em all
So fuck the ass or something, yup pass it off
Icy in the ass mints, so much dough it's elastic
Fuck with the Jews, Crews, and black bits
Might break a man, the heart that'll shake a man
Smack the bones out of ya skin, wake up fam
We the veterans, so many little niggas feather skin
One corny dub, drown you in your letter kid
Necks look thirsty, whats the word, reimburse me
Two techs on his neck, burst sweet he check writing liars
Pull the gold out of your mouth with rusty pliers
Take down the flyers nigga

[Intermission: Raekwon]
Yo, yo, you already know what is nigga
This is not a game, this is not televised
This some shit that happened on a train nigga
Most powerful of them all nigga
Don't make me snatch your heart out your champion shirt nigga

[Verse 2: Doe B]
Hey, I'm from the home of the cop killers
Raised to be a rotten nigga
Rob nigga, shot ninja
You know I got that small in me
"Real Deal" Holyfield, they not authentic
Nah, these niggas half-baked crab cakes
Bitch is baby Jesus, I could sneeze and make a ground shake
Show no pity, charging city niggas out-of-town rate
While you little niggas sending wayne on an ounce plate
I'm in my house shoes, making major boss moves
Dead alone, make the wrong move it'll cost you
Old cats want they corner back, you know how Moss do
They trying to keep up with him
You starve and eat dust nigga
I'm starting to heat up nigga
Then shout "what up nigga"
What's for dinner? This is Chess not Checkers
Real finesse, a nigga trying to molest the system
Black Mamba in jungle possessed with venom
D farmer and I stalk the rest is history

[Verse 3: T.I.]
We from a small house, dropping off an eight ball
To a big deal, thirty-six mil up in my escrow
You walk up with your chest swoll, make it deflate
Been getting keys since we were wearing a Enyce
Now cool what we do, thirty-eight special in my boot
I shoot you from my shoe nigga
My wife say it's a shame how I do niggas
I say "you want me to starve them out"
She say "nah boo, get'em"
So that why I'm a handle all you niggas
Like the bitch that you are
Don't make me get you out that car and get to going in that shit
While you poppin' off? At point you knowing with this shit
We roll up slow and get you hit, pull up in morning with this shit
Or wherever, know that's not where you better be at
Or else, tell your momma pick the casket herself
Hope it make her feel better, you were dead the first year
He ain't suffer but he still a dead muthafucka
Ain't no bullets in the gun, you know you scared muthafucka
And I'm still a Bankhead muthafucka
With the plum for the low, for the bread muthafucka
I said I'm still a Bankhead muthafucka
With the plum for the low, for the bread muthafucka

[Outro: T.I.]
They say Yo B
Hustle Gang G.D.O.D
Raekwon the chef
T.I.P the King
We cold to cold with this shit man
East Coast, West Coast, Midwest
Mid-Alantic, North East, Down South
Patna I got the boy cold
Come seem me
Fatality
