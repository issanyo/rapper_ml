[Intro]
Shout to the big homie Tip, salute Hustle Gang
Shouts to my whole Hood Rich fam
Doe B, wussup nigga?

[Verse 1]
You can call me anything but fucked up
And them lame niggas who hatin, they fucked up
And that little bitch, whoever he wit I fucked her
We talkin money, it don't make no sense so shut the fuck up
I'm ballin on these niggas like I'm Westbrook
Ok see these niggas, man I'm flexed up
I came from the bottom, ran my check up
Now I'm in the high riser, getting my dick sucked
And no lame braggin, I'm just speakin facts
Them NYC niggas said I'm speakin crack
Them hoes said I think I'm too much, and I ain't nobody
And they say nobody's perfect so I guess I'm 1000
Geek'd up on that money, turn up on a fuck nigga
Only thing I'm turning down is these punk bitches

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't neva had shit
Fucked up every check, came through the cribs nigga 6-0-6
3-6 nigga
I ain't neva had shit
All I wanted was some money
You know?
Show you niggas I done come from nothing
Yea I did that
Yea!

[Hook]
Money cars and clothes, I ain't neva had shit
Man that's all we know, I ain't neva had shit
Designer head to toe, I ain't neva had shit
Turn up on these hoes, I ain't neva had shit
You can hate me all you want, I ain't neva had shit
Call me anything but broke, I ain't neva had shit
I fucked the baddest bitches, I ain't neva had shit
I went from rap to riches, I ain't neva had shit

[Verse 2]
And you can call me anything but broke, boy
I've been on my grind since the go boy
Know how to make the Jacksons like Joe boy
And all you crunks together, still can't make a low boy
I'm ballin on these niggas like I'm D Wade
Yo bitch went MIA in MIA for 3 days
Got you runnin round town like have you seen she?
I fucked that hoe so many times I call her clich√©
You get it? Yeah I got it
Magician in that kitchen with them pies like Harry Potter
Did so many numbers that I think I'm being followed
In my room, tell this talking ghost, "I need a enchilada"
No problem, get it to you by tomorrow
It's so lonely at the top and I came from the bottom
Jesus pieces round my collar, please protect me heavenly Father
They don't wanna see me prosper and I ain't neva had nothing

[Break]
I ain't neva had nothing man
I came from the bottom, man shit
You know how this shit go man
It's lonely up there man
I see you lil niggas though

[Hook]
