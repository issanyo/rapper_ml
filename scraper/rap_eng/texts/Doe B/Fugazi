(Hook)
I’m the realest nigga out, these other niggas Fugazi
Walkin in this nigga trap and you know who they playin
Bad hoes at my shows, man you know I ain’t playin
I’m the one the streets chose, the only one that can save em
Baby Jesus in this bitch, man you know who they praisin
Baby Jesus round my neck to protect me from Satan
Dirty shots, nine less to protect me from haters
I’m the realest nigga out, these other niggas Fugazi

(Bridge)
Said bitch, bitch bitch, bitch bitch
Said I like bricks, bricks bricks, bricks bricks
Said talkin fish, fish fish, fish fish
I hit licks, licks licks, hold up man

(Verse)
I hit licks like a guitar, they gon cashout on the car
Out that bitch so fuckin tough, ain’t even park in a garage
Pull up on you wit yo boy, and this light out the dark
I ball, passin hard, make you wanna press recharge
Shoot a movie, press record
Slide yo bitch credit card
Life’s a bitch, so is yours
You lil niggas ain’t got no heart
I’m the realest nigga out since Martin (since Martin Luther), leader Martin
Need my own day like MLK (trap on!)

(Hook)
I’m the realest nigga out, these other niggas Fugazi
Walkin in this nigga trap and you know who they playin
Bad hoes at my shows, man you know I ain’t playin
I’m the one the streets chose, the only one that can save em
Baby Jesus in this bitch, man you know who they praisin
Baby Jesus round my neck to protect me from Satan
Dirty shots, nine less to protect me from haters
I’m the realest nigga out, these other niggas Fugazi

(Verse)
I’m the realest nigga out right now
And every nigga trap right now
Mary coughin down yo block, I’m in yo bitch house right now
Fish scale, straight drop right now
Fresh up out the part right now
In a new car with a boob job
Them titties showin, no top ring man
On Forgiato Squad right now
Scurr scurr, I feel like Red now
Niggas thinkin I stopped juggin, got a phonecall for a block right now
How the fuck am I going broke when my phone won’t stop ringing?
The streets calling me everyday
They begging for it, they need it
Said a lot of these niggas fake as fuck, doing anything
Niggas shine like
They say Doe you wanna hear your story? These other niggas in line
The realest nigga out Central Park, streets said I shoulda bench the park
Now these niggas want my spot
Take ya best shot, I’ve been shot

(Hook)
I’m the realest nigga out, these other niggas Fugazi
Walkin in this nigga trap and you know who they playin
Bad hoes at my shows, man you know I ain’t playin
I’m the one the streets chose, the only one that can save em
Baby Jesus in this bitch, man you know who they praisin
Baby Jesus round my neck to protect me from Satan
Dirty shots, nine less to protect me from haters
I’m the realest nigga out, these other niggas Fugazi
