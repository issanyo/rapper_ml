[Chorus:]
Eighty karats in my charm, lord forgive me
When they see what’s on my arm, they gon kill me
[?]
Bad bitches scream, niggas they feel me
Hundred hoes one day I’m Wilt Chamberlain bitch
We sling chains like slaves, i’m gon hang me a nigga
Three chopper KKK, i’m gon sling me a nigga
Put you on the front pages, make you famous little nigga

[Verse 1:]
Pull up in some foreign, gettin on with some foreign
You know a nigga armed, mus gon see what’s on my arm
Niggas wanna be famous, throwing bricks [?]
Take that same brick put it on his head
By tomorrow her be gone
Your life ain’t worth a auto, stretch off in a Rari
Shoppin spree in NYC, i’m ballin like i’m Stoudamire
Niggas talking yadaya, till I let that yamaha
Turn all a you pussy niggas to ghostes like a R’n’R
Rolls Royce, no choice
Put you on the news tomorrow
If you [?], if you famous
Turn you into a fallin star
Smoke you like a Mardi Gras
Rest in peace to Bob nigga
Rep the show and killed yo hoe
Rest in peace yo [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
If you don’t wanna fuck
Bitch i’m from the slum
Ain't neva had shit these niggas hate me you get some
I spent some stack, I went and cashed out on a auto
He doing bad I know cause he got mad as soon as he saw it
I push them niggas hard, my wrist shining so hard
All these racks on my arm got niggas wanna do me harm
These niggas hate me, bitches fake man everybody frost
But we ain’t go play it, ain't no way bitch we go get you [?]
Cause this ain’t what you want, no this ain’t what you want
I’m making plays you got that cake bitch i got what you want
I’ll make you famous put you in the paper on the front
You see these diamonds Patrick Swayze
Eighty karats in my charm

[Chorus]
