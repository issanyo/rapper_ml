(Hook)
Bags pressing on my jeans like they bypass
Got yo bitch fuckin on me like a iPad
No caffeine but I got star bucks
Whole city king in that bitch, star struck
This for the members only, this for the stripers only
This for the smokers only, this for the sippers only
(Only, only)
This for the members only
(Only, only)

(Verse)
No caffeine but I got star bucks
Whole city king in that bitch, star struck
I’m God’s gift to earth, I can walk on water
I’m God’s gift to bitches, nigga all I fuck is quarters
I got 10-15 inside my Styrofoam
Smoking keish, shit so strong
Got a iPhone full of nothing but yellow bones
Then got my android full of nothing droppin hoes
YSL on my belt, YSL on my jeans
I’m in Manarilla, Rose in those bottles
I’m oh Lord tell em on lean
I met a 12 nigga on the top floor with bout 12 hoes he can’t keep
You can suck me up until I’m numb but don’t get nothing on me
Cos I’m making movies like Tyler Perry
Pacin on you like eye candy
Every time yo bitch with me is the 14th of February
I’m all in in a bag of chips
Nacho cheese with the extra dip
40 karat with the entry clip
A nigga fuck with me you getting extra killed

Down suckers, you gon raid the bar
Every night I stay in
Can’t even pronounce the name of my car
Pull up game like re-up
Know I keep that heat with me
Choppas, we got 3 on
Niggas throw the hair, Chief Keef with me
Only heard what’s free huh?
Shots nigga, I just bust a nigga
On the brain on this block no nigga
To me you’re like a Nate Ralphie nigga, hit you with the thong but he boppin nigga
Took this bitch, pressed charges nigga
Wondered off, don’t worry nigga
Cos speed none and moly with me
That threesomes and ménages with me
All in, yo whole playstation
And as soon as I press start
She start playin on my joystick
Got now that on with yo X Box
Slightly bit like a fresh baller
I made a call, meet Brett Farve
And you know I’m a private nigga
Don’t believe me? go ask a nigga
No comedian, no actin nigga
Doe B, yo number 1 trapper nigga
Started off with a uzzi
Now a nigga got a whole key
Bands make it look like I got full me
You wanna hld something, you can hold these
