[Hook]
I got chickens in the coupe
I got chickens in the coupe
I got chickens in the coupe
I got chickens in the coupe
Maserati with no roof
Maserati with no roof
Maserati with no roof
Maserati with no roof
Ten chains on I got the juice
They say Doe B got the juice
They say Doe B got the juice
They say Doe B got the juice
I got that Rick Flair it go like woo!
Ho's see me they like woo!
Bitches see me they like woo!
Niggas know I got that woo!

[VERSE 1]
I got chickens in the coupe
Pull up on her she like woo!
Actavis in my mountain dew
Handy man I keep the tool
Play with me boy you's a fool
Drop the bands on you like bloop
Make you disappear like poof

Then I smash off in my Lamborghini
Think my top pulled a Houdini
Bad bitch I dream of Jeanie
And she do not speak no English
And my watch a pot of gold
And my ears are Aquafin'n
I got ten chains on
Yeah I'm on my Mr.T shit
Shades so dark I can't see shit
Poppin' bars on some geek'd shit
Every time yo bitch see me
She like woo! leave her speechless
I got chickens in the coupe
Juggs on both of my lines
Throwing money out the roof
Screaming how the summer's mine
[Hook]

[VERSE 2:]
I got chickens in a foreigner
With a bad bitch look like a porn star
And I'm covered in designer
100 dollar line-up
When I pull up you better get ya bitch and hide her
She treat me like Messiah
She know you's a jiver
If hatin' was a job I swear to God I'll hire ya
Bricks look like Mariah, off white tan
And that same bitch you admire nigga she's my driver
I make plays like Tyler
Lil' nigga you can't size up
Giant like a lion
Fly like a pilot
