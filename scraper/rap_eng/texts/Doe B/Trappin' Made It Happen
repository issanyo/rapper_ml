[Verse 1]
They like how you get the money Doe
Bitch it came from ass and hoes
No no no was like a porno
Boomin like a corner store
I just made the honor roll
Yea, these all hundreds ho
Cooking like I work and Benihanas ho, I'm jumping ho
And I ain't got no jumper ho
Got blocks like mutumbo though
Trappin out my condo and I sold more man I can't go broke
I take your bitch that ain't your ho
She saw them 30 inches flow
Them Dubs I send you keys don't pay me and I cut your throat
What the fuck you hustling for?
When you niggas trap so slow
Hurt your wrist ain't talking about shit
And I got quarters, halves, and wholes
Dub sales and weed sales whatever I'm still catching those
And I still got Quan stacks, bitch I'm always uppin

[Hook]
They like how you get the money Doe
Trappin made it happen
30 inch a sack is all
Trapping made it happen
They like how you get the bitches Doe
Trappin made it happen
I went from rags to riches ho
Trappin made it happen
They like how you get your name Doe
Trappin made it happen
Got the kush and cocaine ho
Trappin made it happen
They like how you get the streets Doe
Trappin made it happen
Everybody know me ho
Trappin made it happen

[Verse 2]
30 inch shot shots, just to let my nigga stunt
He ain't got a wife or connection better get you one
Got locked up for hit and run
Fucked her and I never call her
Niggas wait on me retire
Tell them hop off of a baller
Came up off of eighty dollars
Went and caught the tray freezing
Uncut straight ether
I went serving 8 people
Clientele increasing had to get a new spot
6 choppers 2 Glocks, rob 2 take what
Headshot, faceshot, lawyer fees, case dropped
Judge threw the case out, the victim family face dropped
Back to serving straight drop, yea that's what money do
Clientele off the charts, any time a 100 come through

[Hook]
