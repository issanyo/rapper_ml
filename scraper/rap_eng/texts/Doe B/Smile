[Intro]
Salute to the streets
Smile my nigga
Yeah, Bolo
Another street classic
This nigga down for it
Just wanna see you smile my nigga
Doe B, Baby Jesus
DJ Scream signing out

[Verse 1]
For all the ones that hated
I still got love for 'em
I don’t wish nothing bad on 'em, just got tough love for 'em
Guess all the love that I was showin'
It wasn’t enough for 'em
But I wish you all the best
Just gon' kill you with success
Cause I know it hurts you nigga eyes when you see me shine
I know you niggas wish you were blind when you see me shine
Man I ain’t tryin' to hurt you, I don’t wanna see you dead
I wanna see your family perfect
Wanna see you take care of your kids
I wanna see you and you see me pull up in that foreign shit
I wanna see you saluting a kid like don’t stay on yo shit
But instead you wanna go against this shit
This is history in the making
I don’t wanna see you miss this shit

[Hook]
I just wanna see you smile
I just wanna see you happy
I’m just tryna make you proud
Just wanna hear you say you love me
And I don’t wanna see you down
No, I don’t wanna see you struggling
I’m just tryna see you smile
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you smile

[Verse 2]
I’mma say this out to my mama who put away all my drama
200 and 52 months, that’s 21 summers
I never should attempt, you such a strong one
You went to marry both the whole world, that’s why I owe you
And you deserve it even though nobody’s perfect
In God eyes is a fully round circle in my eyes
Shit, but I ain’t satisfied, see you got that house baby
See you deserve a mansion, hoping the times will change this
Bet you done took and keep a nigga belly full
The flies close on my back, you the reason why I’m so cool
You the reason why where I’m bad
I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you
And you know I love you for that, I want for that

[Hook]
