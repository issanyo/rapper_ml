[Hook: Playboi Carti]
My life a gamble, just like rolling dice
And this life so fast, you can die tonight
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
I pulled in a foreign
My old hoe so boring
Got another foreign

[Verse 1: Father]
Fake as fuck  motion pictures
I'm for gimmicks, all my niggas toting semis
Automatic weapon, I'm the wrong nigga to threaten
Jet Li with a lethal weapon
Ice mane, Guadalupe on my chain
Meltycanon just saved the game
These niggas need to stay in they lanes
Been in drugs, Imma stay in your veins
Xannies and codeine used to fuel all my flames
Hit 'em with that chopper, call that shit hot lava
Your daughter call me father, your daddy call me a crook
Do everything off the books
Fuck these niggas' good looks
Look at me and that's a look
My girl that's a look
Your bitch can get took, yeah
I'm the king of the hooks, yeah
All you niggas just pawns, ay
All my niggas is rooks, ay

[Hook: Playboi Carti and (Father)]
My life a gamble, just like rolling dice (like rolling dice)
And this life so fast (so fast) you can die tonight (you can die tonight)
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
I pulled in a foreign
My old hoe so boring
Got another foreign

[Hook: Playboi Carti and (Father)]
My life a gamble, just like rolling dice (like rolling dice)
And this life so fast (so fast) you can die tonight (you can die tonight)
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
I pulled in a foreign
My old hoe so boring
Got another foreign
