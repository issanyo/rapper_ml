[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
Tell me what you've gotta do now (Yeah)
Can you break it down for me since it's been a while (Break it down)
Bein' really 'bout it, shorty, don't act like a child
When I'm here with all my niggas, you should know we gettin' wild
Yeah, from the southside to the lakeside (Ooh)
Hop-hop-hoppin' out the Range, or the Benz, or the Mazi (Skrrt)
I'ma bop lil' shawty in the lobby
She came through, I hit her, kamikaze
Just fuck me, don't play with my heart
Pressin' on her clit like the whip she gon' start up (Skrrt)

[Chorus: Roy Woods & Playboi Carti]
I been in the streets so long
What's going on (What's going on)
I been in the streets so long
What's going on (Yeah, what's going on)

What's going on (Oh, what's going on)

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti & Roy Woods]
I'm on a lick with my brothers (With my brothers)
Hit a lick with my brothers (With my brothers)
I count it up with my brothers (With my brothers)
We ain't no colors, we bang with our brothers (When you hang)
In the trap doin' number
Sellin' remix 'cause we dubbin'
Fuckin' your bitch 'cause you dubbin'
Spray down your clique 'cause y'all dubbin'
Fuckin' your bitch with no condom
I keep that .9 like I'm Rondo
Hell no, no problem
Doin' tricks with the bottle
She doin' tricks with my bottle
Doin' tricks with the bottle (With the bottle)
Top me off, girl, swallow (Top me off)
Top me off, hoe, swallow (Ohh, yah)

[Chorus: Roy Woods & Playboi Carti]
I been in the streets so long
