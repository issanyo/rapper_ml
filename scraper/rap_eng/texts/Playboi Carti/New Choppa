[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
New choppa, new choppa it came with the beam
Actavis pouring up lean
Got Flacko, yeah Rocky, he pass me the beam
I shoot like a king
All of these knots on my jeans, Alexander of McQueen
Diamonds they lookin' like ice, I whip the hoe like I'm Ike
Stack up my cash I got height, take advantage of the Sprite
Take the bando bring the hype
We just go hard in the kitchen
Had to catch up with my bitches
They know that young nigga be living

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I ain't hearing what you say, I ain't listening what you say
Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I roll up an L in the lobby
My partner's got wops and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy
From H to the E double hockey sticks
Keep a chopper chop you if you try me bitch
Let's see who next on my homi' list
Carti like, "Rocky you bodied this", that's my prerogative
Shit on them, that's on my potty list
Accused of being bougie by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us, hope they as fast as my Adidas
She say I'm special, that's obvious
Rich 'cause my ideas run up the racks, for the most part
"I rap," when they ask what my hobby is
Run it up, not one of them
Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up
Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus
It's A$AP and I ain't wanna rush

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I ain't hearing what you say, I ain't listening what you say
Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
