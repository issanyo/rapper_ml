[Chorus]
I fell in love, I fell in love
But that's okay, 'cause we in love
Oh my God, I fell in love
I fell in love, with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in, for the love
Just show me love, just show me love
I fell in love, I fell in love
And that's okay, 'cause I'm in love

[Verse]
I'm off the lean, I'm off the pills
I'm off the issue, I'm on a drill
I wanna see you right now, where you at?
I wanna beat it right now from the back
I wanna beat it right now, off the act'
I wanna beat it right now, make it splat

Bad bih, and her name "Tanya"
Fuck around, yeah, I fuck her all the time, ya'
Fuck around, yeah, we fucking all the time, ya'
Ooh, I dressed down, yeah, she fly, all the time ya'
Ooh, fly her out, yeah, I fuck her outta town ya'
Ooh, young nigga, happy, yeah, that he found ya'
Ooh, young nigga, happy, yeah, that he found ya'
Diamond blingin' on you girl, yeah, I got ya', ooh

[Chorus]
I fell in love, I fell in love
But that's okay, 'cause we in love
Oh my God, I fell in love
I fell in love, with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in, for the love
Just show me love, just show me love

And that's okay, 'cause I'm in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
But that's okay, 'cause we in love
