[Intro: Playboi Carti]
Oh my God, Ramriddlz and Cash Carti
What the fuck is she talkin' about, nigga?
It's Cash Carti, nigga, I spend bands on err'

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Damn my life the shit, damn your life a bitch
Hope, that's not your bitch, yeah, swear she be on dick, yeah
She be with the shits, yeah, they be with the shits, yeah
All these hoes up in my trap, man I just take a pic, yeah
Ballin' like my middle name Spalding
She know I'm ballin', that's why all these hoes callin'
They just wanna fuck me for my cash, fuck me for my racks
Bend the bitch back, she gon' give me that
I'm in Toronto fuckin' bitches I just met
Bitches I just met, aye, we blowin' gas
Blowin' dank Cali, bought my hoe some Bally
Only shrimp and salad, only 'bout that salad

[Chorus: Ramriddlz]
I don't know what you see in me
I'm too slumped off this lean and green
That's why I got bitches callin'
That's why I got bitches callin'
I don't know what you see in me
I'm too drunk off this Hennessy
That's why all them bitches callin'
That's why I got your bitch callin'

[Verse 2: Ramriddlz]
She callin' my phone
Give me FaceTime, no iPhone
Wrap around my python
Fuck me with the lights on, to my song
Rum-b-b-bum all night long
You be playin' games too much
See me, I don't say too much
Good weed and I'm satisfied
And them thighs and I’m satisfied
Call me like ring ring
Devil of a ting on my ding-ling
Rub on the thong-thong-thong
She love me long-long-long
Holy hell, babes just wanna Ramriddlz and chill
Give her holy wood in hell
Give her hell in the city of angels
Eating good, call me Uncle Phil
She catch a still, and now she catchin' feels
Poppin' pills for the way it feels
Beat the box up like ding ding ding
Then it's bye bye bye like NSYNC

[Chorus: Ramriddlz]
I don't know what you see in me
I'm too slumped off this lean and green
That's why I got bitches callin'
That's why I got bitches callin'
I don't know what you see in me
I'm too drunk off this Hennessy
That's why all them bitches callin'
That's why all them bitches callin'

[Verse 3: Ramriddlz]
Every time I pick a fit, she just take a pic
Every time I'm off the 5th I just dick a bitch
I'm in ATL, cuttin' peaches I just picked
Everyting halal so no pepperoni nips
I got a Guata-thotta-malan callin'
Guacamole, jalapeño body
She just wanna party with Riddlz and Carti
Said her name's Sally, say she from the Valley
We breakin' backs, break her back in Cali

[Chorus: Ramriddlz]
I don't know what you see in me
But I'm crushin' on that punani
That's why I got bitches callin'
That's why I got bitches callin'
I don't know what you see in me
But I'm crushin' on that punani
That's why all them bitches callin'
That's why I got your bitch callin'
