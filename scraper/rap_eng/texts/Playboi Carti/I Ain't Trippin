[Chorus]
I ain't trippin'
Just cashin' out, I ain't trippin'
These niggas mad at me how a young nigga livin'

[Verse]
Aye, Carti walked in
They ain't seen me in a minute
Been trappin out the hotel since they let me out on bail
They let me out of hell
And pour up to this shit 'cause real niggas don't tell
This new gun that I got
It don't even leave shells, aye
Keep a white bitch
Fat ass, long hair, aye
Sucked the soul out me
Man, that whore left me pale
Damn, I might as well
Might just spend it all on this bitch
I might as well, aye, damn
I feel like I'm the reason why these niggas tryna get it
Pulled up in a foreign, man, I told that hoe get in
I told her I ain't trippin'
I feel like I'm the reason why these niggas tryna get it

[Chorus]
I ain't trippin'
Just cashin' out, I ain't trippin'
These niggas mad at me how a young nigga livin'

[Outro]
Let me get him outcha way
Let me get him outcha way
Let me get him out your face
If you got it like you say you got it
Let me come your way
Please don't bring nobody
Please don't bring nobody
Boy, don't bring nobody
Please don't bring nobody, okay
Please don't bring nobody
Please don't bring nobody
Boy, don't bring nobody
Please don't bring nobody
