[Refrain]
They got me trying all these clothes
They got me trying all these clothes

[Chorus]
I swear to god I'd never wear a dress, nigga
I don't give a fuck, I don't impress a nigga
They got me trying all these clothes (Woah)

[Verse]
[?] a nigga
Bet they wonder how I met that nigga
Young nigga, you don't want the nigga
I was brought up with some killers, nigga
On some fashion shit, yeah, my Glock smash a nigga
It's a movie clip, lights, cameras, action, nigga
