Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I'ma die in moshpit
Yeah, yeah, yeah
10K legit
Just love a lil’ Prada
Spent a bag on a bitch
Got a pound, no cap
We gon' handle that shit
Got a [?] for the [?]
In a brand new Bentley

[Verse 2: NgeeYL]
Pull up wit' choppers
I’m flyer than a bitch (Bow bow)
I got a Glock
Ayy, play with that shit, boy, yo' ass get hit
Model bitch, she exquisite
Fuck from the back, she be lovin' that shit
Keep a 30 in them dracos
762 boys, know we shootin' them shits
[?], we gon' gun you down
Fly your hoe to my show out of town
Slide in yo' bitch, [?]
Got a whole hunnit, [?]
I gotta make our ass out of the trenches
Swear to God, I'm in love with that draco
[?]

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I'ma ride like this
I’ma die like this
I’ma die like this
I'ma ride like this
