[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]

Black boy white boy swag, black hoe, white hoe, oreo
Real player shit boy I always keep the pole
Aye, I came up like a dick
Countin' up them big bankrolls
R.I.P. Bankroll, aye, R.I.P. my woe, ooh

And we blow on a bag everyday we kickin' shit
Show after show, still on road
Talk my shit at Interscope, aye, I need a hunnid more

[Verse 2: ThouxanbandFauni]
Ay, Gucci, Gosha, Polo
All summer sixteen, hoe, you know how it go
I got Goyard on my waist, aye, it keep my .30 though
I got Goyard in my wallet, aye, it hold my gold though
You know
Give that boy your jacket cause he jackin' swag, it's cold
Write my name in blood before I write my name in bold
You call her your new hoe, I call her my old hoe
Niggas wanna get close just to turn into foes
Trust me, I could never fold
All these niggas with me, now these niggas want it most
Yeah, my niggas do the most, my niggas want it more
Aye, so kick the door, aye, copy 10-4
Then I break the window just to go and get the dough
Baggies, baggies, dough aye, baggies, baggies, dough, aye
Why I did that fuck shit? Cause I need them baggies though
And I said fuck being broke
All these hoes used to laugh but they ain't laughin' no more
Niggas want to know, my niggas want to know
If you was really 'bout it cause we really on go

Go, go, goo, goo
