[Hook: Playboi Carti]
We can touch the water, bitch I walk
Walk on top of water, slime

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
Fade on me like I'm Boosie, bitch she popping her coochie
My girl she look like a stripper
Codeine in a Kool-Aid pitcher
Put diamonds on my sister
Put Prada on my mama
Eating Benihana's, filled up off the lobster
Pasta like a mobster, reds got me poppin' (yeah)
On a tropic island (yeah) TMZ watching

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
I'm a money man, I got her running away
Come up off that pussy, make some money today
Fetti provolone, she fell in love with the guap
Leave your man at home, and I'ma make you a star
Take you round the world, you can't pronounce where we are
I just robbed a little nigga, and I'm takin' his broad

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
Big bang, Nasty in this hoe, man
I might fuck around and fuck a little nigga's hoe, man
You know how the game go, you know that shit for sure, man
Fuck yo bitch one night, she blow the next, they just like propane
Spend a lil' shopping money on a lil' Dolce
Prada and that Gucci plus Chanel, she love the clothes game
Told her if she fuck me right, she could get what she wanted
It ain't nothin' to me, I just call up my accountant
Guap

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
You see me on water, walking on it like Jesus
Margiela on my collar, remember they used to tease us
I need Obama daughter, yeah, I really need her
Hundred racks froze in water, I bought that new freezer
Jump with the Mac in the back of the Jeep
Sweep them niggas clean (roo!)
Hit em with a magazine
Make your sneakers lean (roo!)
Cadillac diamond the back of that old school
When I'm with my team
Don't wanna fuck with the team
Don't do that, know what I mean? (Alright!)
She wanna fuck with a king, diamonds all bling
Hood Pope doing his thing
She wanna ride with the team, by any means
Taking the bitch of your dreams
Now that bitch my little queen, got her from Queens
Might come in raw, with a G
Gucci and Prada on her feet, designer her sheets
A dollar sign A P
