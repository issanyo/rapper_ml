[Verse 1]
I'm still counting, aye, aye, aye
Nigga I'm still counting, nigga mad at me
Ya I'm still counting
Had to drop that bitch at home oh

Threw the chains on for doing it, the shades on

Damn lil bro come get your hoe, bitch come get your hoe
Damn lil bro come get your hoe, bitch come get your hoe
Dirty mix my Styrofoam, this my Styrofoam
