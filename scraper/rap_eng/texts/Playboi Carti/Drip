[Chorus]
Bitches complain 'cause I love to play
Diamonds on skate, diamonds rollerblade
Shawty in love, shawty wanna skate
Shawty in love, shawty wanna date
A mil' on me, two mil' on me
Three mil' on me, ten mil' on me
How you drip on me, how you drip on me
Drip on me, how you drip on me

[Verse 1]
Goofy bitch, just decline
Buy a Weston, bitch I'm shootin' 'round
F&N, leave a nigga down
Waterboy, pass the towel
I got drip, Carti go too wild
Nick Cannon, find your style
I got swag, go too well
Made my momma proud, platinum now
I ain't broke, I can see you
Hit 'em with that stick then leave him out
I'm from the south, I'm from the south
South Atlanta, where the fuck was you?
I'm with them reds, I can't fuck with blue
But shout-out blue because they keep it true
I fucked the Sprite up, can't fuck with dude
I fucked that bih' yeah, can't fuck with dude

[Chorus]
Bitches complain 'cause I love to play
Diamonds on skate, diamonds rollerblade
Shawty in love, shawty wanna skate
Shawty in love, shawty wanna date
A mil' on me, two mil' on me
Three mil' on me, ten mil' on me
How you drip on me, how you drip on me
Drip on me, how you drip on me

[Verse 2]
That's what I do bitch, check that resume
Play ya' bitch 'cause I love to play
Play ya' bitches 'cause we love to play
That's what I do bih', fuck that resume
Gucci on my sweater, Coogie on my sweater
Boy, you can do better, you got nothin' on that
Never on that level, I got bricks in the sensor
That nigga don't want no pressure
That nigga don't want no pressure
I squeeze him like a gusher
These niggas out here pussy, y'all niggas don't want no pressure
I freestyle on the track, I do this shit so low
Bald head bitch and my bro got the K
Bad bitch suck the dick, yeah, my diamonds skate
Rollerblade, I got Bathing Ape
80k just to hit the stage
Let 'em know, gotta let 'em know

[Chorus]
Bitches complain 'cause I love to play
Diamonds on skate, diamonds rollerblade
Shawty in love, shawty wanna skate
Shawty in love, shawty wanna date
A mil' on me, two mil' on me
Three mil' on me, ten mil' on me
How you drip on me, how you drip on me
Drip on me, how you drip on me
