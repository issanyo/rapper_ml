Money got longer, i feel like Uzi, come in with groupies
Walk in with groupies, all of these hoes

I feel like Uzi money got longer, walk in with groupies
Bitches they shooting, shooting on groupies

[Verse 1: 4ourScars}

Dont know what the buiness
Run up the digits
Flexin no fitness
Shittin on niggas i feel like a piegeon
Fucked her in different postions
Got coke in the kitchen
Yo bitch doing dishes
She taste delicsous
The neighbors suspicious
Turned into snitches
Eneded up in the ditches

So many bitches i cannot choose
Hit the bitch once pass her to the crew
100 round clip turn his ass to beef stew
This ain't cambles you get canned to
You might die soon
Diamnds on wirst they gliss like ooh

Yeah i keep a tool
I bool i cool
Fucking you bitch she wet liek a pool
Play with that pussy play pick a boo
You can't pick and choose
You is a lil fool

Demons inside me they can't take my flow
Smoking on dope slowly burning my soul
Run up a check
Sippion on act came from the trap
Catch me with a tool
In Istanbul that's where i cool


[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Money got longer, i feel like Uzi, come in with groupies
Walk in with groupies, all of these hoes
All thees hoes choosing, i got you bitch
What (x3)
I feel like Uzi money got longer, walk in with groupies
Bitches they shooting, shooting on groupies
How can you do it, you know how im bool
I keep a tool (x2)
You niggas can shoot
Shooting for free, shooting for me
Count up the bands
Running a check up
Fucking a check up
Fucking her head up
Money got bigger
I get hte cheddar
Diamnds lil ?
Niggas some ?
400 degress
Im feeling like ?
All in the move
Shooting at ooh
