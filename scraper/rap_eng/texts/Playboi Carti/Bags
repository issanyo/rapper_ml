[Verse]
I got all these bags (ouu, yuh)
I got all these bags (ouu, yuh)
She just want the bag, aye
That bitch too damn bad, aye
Take her to the hotel, spend that bitch, one bag aye
She just give me neck, aye
She don't disrespect, aye
Goyard on my waist, aye
And I got the tag, aye
Then its out the door, aye
And she love the dome. aye
Couldn't take her home, aye
Bring her to my rows, aye
I got all these bags (ouu, yuh)
I got all these bags (ouu, yuh)
She just want the bag, aye
That bitch too damn bad, aye
Take her to the hotel, spend that bitch, one bag aye
She just give me neck, aye
She don't disrespect, aye
Goyard on my waist, aye
And I got the tag, aye
Then its out the door, aye
And she love the dome. aye
Couldn't take her home, aye
Bring her to my rows, aye
