[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
Bet I'll tell that bitch suck my dick rub on your clit
Benzo all white lookin' like a bowl of grits (goddamn)
Fans at my shows wylin' out, startin' mosh pits (goddamn)
Pourin' up everyday, connected to the pharmacist (whoo)
Might pop another pill, might sip some more lean (go!)
Wu-Tang forever, keepin' licks and I got the cream (uh)
My future been bright, see the motherfuckin' gleam
Put on for my city and I always put on for my team (whoa)
Skyhook on the competition like I'm Kareem(mm)
Twin to the 50s (50s), (?) to them 100s (100s)
Fuck niggas that fronted (fronted)
Cause I done did it (done did it)
Like the turd I shitted (Like the turd I shitted)
These niggas don't want it (Don't want it, don't want it)
But I fuck your bitch (But I fuck your bitch)
With the gold Daytons (Gold daytons)
With the candy paint (skrrrt)
I'm rollin' that stank (goddamn)
I'm sippin' that lean (goddamn)
And I'm off that molly (goddamn)
On them psychedelics (goddamn goddamn)
Like I'm John Lennon

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Aye, so much money I need a money counter
Money counter, fuck a bank, that's how I feel about it
I keep the peace but I keep the piece so we gon' get real violent
In my field it get real, what you know about it?
I keep the pole like a streetlight and I won't leave without it
I pour a 4 up in my Sprite cause I ain't me without it
Zooted and booted
Zooted and booted, just like Cash Carti
Zooted and booted
Zooted and booted, gave you ho some molly
Just the other day, goddamn, you wasn't feelin' me
Now I'm in VIP, lookin' like I'm VIP
Fuck a nigga
RIP don't trust no nigga
RIP just bust a nigga
RIP straight bust a nigga
RIP
Niggas say they on my team but ain't on my team
Niggas watchin', niggas plottin', that don't phase me
I'm in the Benz with the beans ho, what you need?
Triple C's, molly beans, I got what you need

Thumbin' through the motherfuckin' damn hundreds
So much money I need a money counter
