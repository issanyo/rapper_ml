[Intro: Playboi Carti]
You already know, you already know
(Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
You already know
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Verse: Playboi Carti]
I ain't gotta lie, you already know
He can't kill our vibe, girl you ain't his hoe
I swear this bitch she gon' ride, she won't tell a soul
I got fam up in jail ready to come home
I got it on that scale, and know it off the dome
I swear I get it off, like I get it on
Girl that's why I'm on, tell me what you on
Come and pop this Perc, and you won't feel it all
Come and sip this drink, and you won't feel it, yo
Tell me what you think, and let's get with it on

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
I ain't gotta lie, you already know
He can't kill our vibe, girl you ain't his hoe
You already know girl, you already know
You already know girl, you already know
He can't kill our vibe, he can't kill our vibe
He can't kill our vibe, no he can't
(She won't tell a, she won't tell a soul)
(Yeah, you already know, you already know)
