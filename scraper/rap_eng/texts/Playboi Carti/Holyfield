[Intro]
Got my 9 tucked, take it up, off his feet for what?
Cause he talking shit, took his bitch, with my fuckin wrist
Betty Crocker mix, mix the work, make it bottle up [DJ Fade Out] (Bring that shit back nigga, 2 phones Carti nigga... Fuck wrong with y'all niggas... Squad nigga...)

[Hook]
Cautious, cautious, you better stay cautious
The feds out here watchin, tryna get our profit
Got my 9 tucked, take it up, off his feet for what?
Cause he talking shit, took his bitch, with my fuckin wrist
Betty Crocker mix, mix the work, make it bottle up
Niggas say me, he ain't Carti, he ain't with the shits
Gotta brick in, got some more evicting, build a house with it
Got a bitch, then got another bitch that like to fuck and shit (glass breaks)
Cautious, cautious, you better stay cautious
The feds out here watchin, tryna get our profit
Got my 9 tucked, take it up, off his feet for what?
Cause he talking shit, took his bitch, with my fuckin wrist
Betty Crocker mix, mix the work, make it bottle up
Niggas say me, he ain't Carti, he ain't with the shits
Gotta brick in, got some more evicting, build a house with it
Got a bitch, then got another bitch that like to fuck and shit

[Verse]
I don't tongue wrestle, with a nigga bitch I pop it off
Watch his body fall, pick him up, then we drop him off
Fuck em all, with my team, I ball, know they second aw
Fuck with me, I fuck with you, I put you on a plug or two
In the streets, they know bout me
I keep the lean I keep the heat
In the Audi, Fendi on my body, feelin' on ya shawty
Purple drank, blowin purple dank, nigga the fuck you think?
Shout out to my niggas Scoob, and shout out to my nigga Nae
Shout out to my nigga La Flare, and all these thirsty hoes out here
Flat bed, straight from hell, young nigga, can't you tell?
Enemies, who is them? Blow money, Holyfield
Enemies, who is them? Blow money... Blow money
Blow money, call me Holyfield
I throw money, call me Holyfield
I show money, call me Holyfield
I blow money, call me Holyfield
Flat bed, straight from hell, young nigga, can't you tell?
Enemies, who is them? Blow money, Holyfield
Enemies, who is them? Blow money... Holyfield
Holyfield... Holyfield... Holyfield
I blow money, call me Holyfield
I throw money, call me Holyfield
