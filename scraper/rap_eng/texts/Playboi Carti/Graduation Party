Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Dropped out then the come up
I dropped out then I came up

[Chorus]
I dropped out then I came up
I went out and then I got up
Dropped it on a Hummer
On the block 'til the sun up
Told my bitch "Don't wait up"
I get home then kill her
I go Bryson Tiller
Shawty want a dealer
I'm a drug dealer

[Verse]
Got more gas than a dealer
Pop more pills than a killer
Michael Jackson, Thriller
Take her out then I kill her
Shawty want a nigga with them racks, I'm that nigga
I'm a lil' boy with that guap
I'm a lil' boy with that cash
I'm a lil' boy with that guap
I'm a lil' boy with that cash
They don't wanna see me on top
They don't wanna see me, I'm bad
They don't wanna see me on top
They don't wanna see me, I'm bad
They don't wanna see me, I'm bad
Shawty get left
I'm on the top of the goats
I'm on the top of the coochie
I'm on the top of the goats
I'm on the top of the coochie
Yeah, Carti smellin'
Smoking vanilla
Yo' bitch put a spell on me
She gave me some melody
Gave me some melody
Gave me some melody
T-I-T-I-B, bitch
Just like a spelling bee
You went through the check
Bitch be telling me
You can't pull my thot
Thanks for tellin' me
I ain't fuck with opps
She know they be tellin' it
