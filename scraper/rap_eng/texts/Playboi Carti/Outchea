[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Where the bad hoes from Tokyo?
With they bape on and they hair short
But my money long I don’t say shit
I just pull up and they escort
Fuck a passport roll that Kush blunt
Get you higher than before
See the whole world with your eyes low
And your mouth closed you speechless (yeah)
She bend it back with no attitude
If this your girl then she creeping (damn)
Burn one and she gone (gone)
Burn two and I’m thrown (thrown)
Test drive that new whip (skrt)
Pull up too high in this bitch (bitch)
These white hoes love this pimp (this pimp)
They pops say stay from that nigga
Aye I’m sipping on this tea, getting lit (gettin' lit)
Chiefing on this tree (this tree), getting hit (gettin' hit)
Fuck all the cash I spend (all the cash)
I’m plotting on niggas tryna plot on my riches (ay)
I’m ducking from the bitches while I’m chasing these millions (ay)
Teenage dreams nigga hold on my feelings (Carti)
Fast life bitch, Nascar chilling

[Bridge: Playboi Carti] - 2x
Catch me with my clique with a forty and a knit
With a Cannon on record cuz I’m doing this shit
Aye doing this shit, outchea straight doing this shit

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
678 (ay)
Shrimp on my plate
But the bread on the way, freshly baked (ay)
I’ve been waiting all day (ay)
Now the clouds all grey
From blowing this haze (ay)
Niggas gon’ hate
That’s cool with me
I’m a flossy nigga
Cuz talk is cheap and you a salty nigga
I can smell you B

You can’t fuck with me
Check my wrist bruh
Like what time it be
