[Verse  1: Playboi Carti]
Walk up in that bitch, ooh, yah, and I kick shit
And I got some bitches, ooh, and I switch shit
And I got these millions, ooh, on my dick quick
And they know I'm in here, ooh, in the ceiling

Remember I was down, bet these niggas thought I'd lose
So when I pull up now I'm acting brand new

Butterfly coupe with my boo, drop the roof, aye

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
Butterfly coupe with my boo, drop the roof
The lil bitch wanna hit my cup, I pour a six in minus two, aye
Good gas bag, broke niggas smoking boof
In the booth with the boof, wake up early, bust a move, aye
Smoking on some fruit, bitch, I been gassing like a jew
Niggas say we having pressure, pussy nigga, who is you? Aye
Press a pussy nigga if he tryna take this loot
I ain't worried 'bout no bitch 'cause either way these bitches choose

Got my nina on me while I'm smashing on yo thot
Smashing on yo thot
