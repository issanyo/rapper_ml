[Intro: Playboi Carti]
I got too many hoes callin me, you know I'm sayin?
Real street shit man
I don't even fuck with niggas, you know, on some street shit, you feel me?
I can't trust these niggas
Uno!
Cash!
You already know nigga
Money bags nigga
Money bags nigga

[Hook: UnoTheActivist]
No, we cannot hang if you a stain
What you want, the re-rock, or you want the whole thang?
Can't fuck with Johnny Dang, he charge me a whole thang
Said she want a bag and she want my whole name
Nah, they can't contain, all my niggas throwin' sets up
I ain't with the flex, all my niggas holdin' TECs up
No, we don't let up, pussy don't get wet up
Fuckin' on your momma like nigga don't get wet, don't be set up

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Fuck nigga know what's good
Fuck nigga know what's good
Don't be runnin' up in my hood if none of y'all face card good
Nine boy on gas, boy ya'll blowin' Backwoods
All of my niggas grown boy, all of them tote semi-automatic too

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
I whip that white, that Kurt Cobain, I can't feel my face
A designer belt my waist, bitch pick up your face
Bitch come give me faith, diamonds prancin' on me
All my diamonds dimmed the place
Told that bitch to give me face, yeah
Pull up in my Bentley Coupe, cause I needed more space
Fucked her in my Bentley Coupe and came all on her face
Xan my lemonade, now feel like I'm in space
Yeah, I feel like I'm in space

[Verse 3: UnoTheActivist]
My Tommy Hilfigers, Burberry my linen
Got these bitches switchin' on they nigga for this nigga
They hate for no reason, Ruger leave a nigga breathless
Bitch I carry shells by the box like some Adidas
Say you know this nigga, I don't know this nigga
I pull up on this nigga, get to bussin' on this nigga
Said I'm up, up on this nigga, aye, tough love for my nigga, aye
Boof pack burn my finger, damn and that's my trigger finger

[Hook: UnoTheActivist]
No, we cannot hang if you a stain
What you want, the re-rock, or you want the whole thang?
Can't fuck with Johnny Dang, he charge me a whole thang
Said she want a bag and she want my whole name
Nah, they can't contain, all my niggas throwin' sets up
I ain't with the flex, all my niggas holdin' TECs up
No, we don't let up, pussy don't get wet up
Fuckin' on your momma like nigga don't get wet, don't be set up

[Verse 4: Maxo Kream]
Frilly niggas, y'all can't hang
Eleven-trey-seven I claim
XD with the beam for the aim
Mossberg rearrange your whole frame
My young niggas O-Dog insane
Leave your ass how The Crips did Caine
Tryna rob me, you done lost your damn mind
Got a better chance fightin' lions in the wild
Put a hole in your heart like you smokin' black and milds, worked up
Pop a couple Xans then crack a smile
No piece treaty, I don't never squash beef
My gun got extensions like a black girl's weave
Hit Johnny Dang and my teeth full of chief
I'm with Johnny Cage, gym kicks on my feet
Speed bump like poles, niggas in streets better call, got [?] diamonds with me
Heard this nigga snitchin', yeah this nigga snitchin'
He got caught with them pigeons and he got out  no convictions
Uno go and get 'em, people with 'em, then we kill 'em
Two bricks on my for my grill, I went and flooded out my wisdom
You don't know me nigga, I don't look familiar
He heard I got that work, well nigga how you figure?
I'm Maxo Kream to you, but in the SWAT I'm Trigga
And when I move the work, I do it like Matilda

[Hook: UnoTheActivist]
No, we cannot hang if you a stain
What you want, the re-rock, or you want the whole thang?
Can't fuck with Johnny Dang, he charge me a whole thang
Said she want a bag and she want my whole name
Nah, they can't contain, all my niggas throwin' sets up
I ain't with the flex, all my niggas holdin' TECs up
No, we don't let up, pussy don't get wet up
Fuckin' on your momma like nigga don't get wet, don't be set up
