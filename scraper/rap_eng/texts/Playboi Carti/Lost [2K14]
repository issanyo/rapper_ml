[Intro]
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost
I wrap them up, I ship them off, I'm like a boss
Can you see the cloud that I'm on
Got a bad ass bitch from New York

[Verse 1]
Smoke kush I can't fuck with Newports
In a foreign coupe, killing niggas no insurance
I'm the realest I can show you how to do this
Smoking, drinking penicillin deadest nigga living
Bitch you know I'm in it
Mercedes Benz got lady friends
They adore a nigga
They some whores nigga
I let my boys in them
Feeling like that nigga
I feel like that nigga
Nigga tried to jack my swag I'm feeling this nigga
But bitches know you ain't young Carti I'm telling you nigga
Damn

[Bridge]
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost
Bad ass bitch from New York
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost
Can you see the cloud that I'm on
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost

[Verse 2]
Hundred thousand bitches boy you know we get it
You stalking all these hoes, we pay no attention
I'm counting C-notes
Can't smoke no rillo cuz' I'm different
I'm working my wrists
Filet mignon with your bitch
I'll pipe her down with the dick
She calm me down with the head when I'm sitting at work
My phone chirping like a bitch
I spilled lean on my shirt
I'm out here grinding shawty while your niggas pockets are hurt
Before my hoe says Carti she better say sir
It's money to be made
Can't a nigga face
All she do is face
Yellow diamonds keep a hoe thirsty like lemonade
It's money to be made
Getting top up in the coupe
She loose
My sprite mixed up with goop
I'm loose
You fucked that bitch, me too
