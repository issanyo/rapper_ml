[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In makin' me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lies and black beaches

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe (What? What? What? What? What?)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky, Playboi Carti & Lana Del Rey]
Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted (what?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (What? Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (Ooh, what?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But bankin' like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hatin' (Yeah)
What? (what? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Boppin'  (What?)
Milly Rockin' (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real (for real, for real)
I might fuck with her all summer for real (for real, for real)
They better not holla if I cuff her for real (for real, for real)
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe (What? What? What? What? What?)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Lana Del Rey]
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real (for real, for real)
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
High tops in the summer
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer, babe
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer
Hop out (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe (What? What? What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe
