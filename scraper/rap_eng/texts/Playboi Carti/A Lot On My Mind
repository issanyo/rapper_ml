[Intro]
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind, yeah

[Chorus]
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
She got a lot on her mind
She got a lot on her mind
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
Sixteen in that hoe, and that two nine, nine
I got AK with the scopes and 9s, 9s
Undercover jeans and (N)umber (N)ine, (N)ine
Sixteen in that bih, and that two nine, nine
You think that she loyal but she lyin', lyin'
I be fuckin' that bih like she mine, mine
All my jewelry wet and they mine, mine
Diamonds wet like seal, wet like lake, pond

[Verse 1]
Bad bih wanna fuck, come and lay on mine
Smashin' on the couch, on the floor, dime
I got these hoes, I got these hoes
I got these hoes fo' sho'
I'm on the top like a goat
I'm on the block with the pole
I'm on the block with a coupe
I'm in Miami with Coach
Nigga, we move like a cult
We on our block like a cult
I got Moncler, I got Margiela
I got this mofuckin' jewelry
Lil' boy still rockin' that Fendi
Got my lil' shit from Little Italy
Yeah, I fuck with the dealer
Spend a lil' check with my dentist
Got a lil' bitch, she cool with my bitch
Yeah, she gave me a limit
Ooh, yeah, gave me a limit
Ooh, yeah, gave me a minute
Bentley coupe, Bentley coupe tinted
2900 lieutenant (Bentley coupe)
I'm in the trap like a building
I'm in the trap like a building
Bih' gon' be fly like a ceilin'
Baby girl give me the feelin'

[Chorus]
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
She got a lot on her mind
She got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
Sixteen in that hoe, and that two nine, nine
I got AK with the scopes and 9s, 9s
Undercover jeans and (N)umber (N)ine, (N)ine
Sixteen in that bih, and that two nine, nine
You think that she love you but she lyin', lyin'
I be fuckin' that bih like she mine, mine
All my jewelry wet and they mine, mine
Diamonds wet like seal, wet like lake, pond
