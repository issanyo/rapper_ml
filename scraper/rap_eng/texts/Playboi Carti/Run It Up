[Intro]
You gotta turn me up some more, turn the beat up
Turn the—turn the—
Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

[Chorus]
Big boss, Rick Ross
I just made bond
I shoot like Bond
007 on y'all
Fucked up that bitch
Fucked up her shit
Fucked up the Raf
Fucked up the trap

[Post-Chorus]
Add it up, add it up (Add it up)
Count it up, count it up, count it up
I need 19 then I run it up
I do not do it, I run it up
Shootin' my shit in the club
Shootin' that shit in the club
Shootin' that shit in the club
Fuckin' the bih in the club

[Verse 1]
I'm on the phone with plug
All of these hoes they dumb
All of these niggas they dumb
We shootin' the shit in the club
Trickin' yo bih, throwin' some cash I'm throwin'
Trickin' yo bih, puttin' my dick in her tongue
Fuckin' yo bih, foolin' that bih and she doin'
All of this kush in my lung
Rockin' that Louis Vuitton
Put my light dreads in a bun
Callin' my plug, I need tons
Fuckin' that bih, for fun
I do this shit, for fun
All in the show, know I'm rockin' the show
All of these niggas they lookin' like hoes
Call up the pole 'cause you a lil' hoe
Fuckin' yo bih, I kick her out the door
Yeah, hit a lil' bih with the stick
Hit a lil' bih with the bag
I don't give a fuck about the bag
I just go lean on the track

[Chorus]
Big boss, Rick Ross
I just made bond
I shoot like Bond
007 on y'all
Fucked up that bitch
Fucked up her shit
Fucked up the Raf
Fucked up the trap

[Post-Chorus]
Add it up, add it up (Add it up)
Count it up, count it up, count it up
I need 19 then I run it up
I do not do it, I run it up
Shootin' my shit in the club
Shootin' that shit in the club
Shootin' that shit in the club
Fuckin' the bih in the club
