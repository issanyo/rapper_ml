[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Louis, Gucci, Prada, just designer, aye
I just mixed the lean with the Fanta, aye
Mixin' up that dope, Arm & Hammer, aye
Free my niggas locked up in the slammer, aye
Zone 3, young Carti go harder
Came a long way from ridin' on the motherfuckin' MARTA
Now I'm ridin' shotgun, puffin' dank with your daughter
On my momma, I'm a pretty young nigga like my momma, uh
(Carti! Carti! Carti! Carti!)
Niggas plottin', trust nobody, uh, catch a body
Off the bean, uh, doin' donuts, uh, in the lobby
On my partner, I got thotties, Silkk The Shocker
Got the hoes knockin', tryna fuck me, uh
Bout this money, white bitches, snow bunny, yeah
Easter pink in my cup, off the mud
I fucked that bitch, yeah, off the mud, nigga what's good?
On the block, got the Glock, sell rerock, fuck an opp
Young Carti can't stop, nah, call carti on
Smokin' that strong, sellin' that strong, all day long
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Hook]
I mixed the lean with the Fanta, uh
I mixed the lean with the Fanta, uh
I'ma mix that dope, Arm & Hammer, aye, aye
I'ma mix that dope, Arm & Hammer, uh
I mixed the lean with the Fanta, uh
I mixed the lean with the Fanta, uh
I'ma mix that dope, Arm & Hammer, aye, aye
I'ma mix that dope, Arm & Hammer, uh

[Verse 2: Cultie]
Lil' LSD on the tab
Me and Yachty high talkin' bout a mansion
Back then niggas couldn't stand us
Now we high fivin' high rollers, wave high to the camera
Goddamn bitch, feelin' like the man
Bout to board the flight back to Atlanta
678 till the day a nigga rest
Used to tote cannons, now they shoot us with a camera
I couldn't never lie, I would never try
Take a dab, hold it in, now it's colors all around you
Backpack got a couple pounds too, soundproof
Silencer equipped when they pound you, now who
Lookin' like the man, Cartier probably on the Xan
What a nigga gotta do to get a muthafuckin' space on the sand
Rollin' blunts till a nigga crampin' in the hand, shit
My companion be the Bandz, Bape on my body
4-5 layin' beside me
Momma said the road ain't easy, ate a lil' ramen
Now it's steak, sushi and wasabi
Bitches used to laugh at a nigga, never came around
Now they wish they was layin' beside me
Said we want all the money now, passport stamps from Atlanta to Dubai with Mauis, where the molly at?
