[Verse 1]
I started up ? and pimpin'
I said bitches i'm a fat cat
So much ? with the digits
I count my ? up to ?
Last count, I need to come back
Figures to figure
I ? i'm ? now
Sniffed out the snort in my ? filled like ?
Kings and queens ?
White powder cover nose hurts sore
Reality hurts more
Reality's a big boy
I get high like the swing of trees
Fine swans and killing bees
Cuz i'm into hunnies, I could put my ? to create
Love the ones I meet
Still rocking, still plotting
Emcee guts ? chopping
? ability ? wrist
? can't fuck with me
Let's get ? like a landslide to your dome
? that he ? be the home to it
To all the fat cats ?
? to say this in songs
? that nobody ?
To ? properly, the ? zombie

And i'm just rolling with my crew
Tryna burn a lil somethin' nigga what you tryna do, yeah
And i'm just chillin' (i'm just chillin'), yeah
And i'm just chillin' (real ?)
Ain't no question asked
Just making a ?
With a girl and a bag ? up that ?
Bitches at my party gettin' higher than a ?, yeah
Zombie gang, rep it to the death

[Verse 2]
I'm with my niggas and some females
Holding things down
A ?, ? one
Burning a three down, hold up, wait, uh

[Hook]
Yeah
And i'm just rolling with my crew
Tryna burn a lil somethin' nigga what you tryna do, yeah
And i'm just chillin' (i'm just chillin'), yeah
And i'm just chillin' (real ?)
Ain't no question asked
Just making a ?
With a girl and a bag ? up that ?
Bitches at my party gettin' higher than a ?, yeah
