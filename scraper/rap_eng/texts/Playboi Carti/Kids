[Chorus]
Turn that shit up, mmm
I like your swag, boy, I like your swag
You look like dad, look just like your dad
You like dad, you look just like your dad
Boy, I like your swag, man I love your swag
You look like dad, you look just like your dad
You look like dad, you look just like your dad
All these kids, I'm they dad

[Verse 1]
Baby momma, where you at
Bring a mop, diamonds wet
Drive these Hummers, and Corvettes
You waking up, find the check
We got kids, put them kids in check
I got kids, put them kids in rest
I got kids, Carti blessed

[Chorus]
Turn that shit up, mmm
I like your swag, boy, I like your swag
You look like dad, look just like your dad
You like dad, you look just like your dad
Boy, I like your swag, man I love your swag
You look like dad, you look just like your dad
You look like dad, you look just like your dad
All these kids, I'm they dad

[Verse 2]
She couldn't make it, she was far
From SoundCloud, to them charts
From the lean, from them bars
I start to float, gave 'em birth
I'm on drill, drill time
We shootin' shit, film time
Get in line, bitch, get in line
Put them kids, shit, in a line

[Chorus]
Turn that shit up, mmm
I like your swag, boy, I like your swag
You look like dad, look just like your dad
You like dad, you look just like your dad
Boy, I like your swag, man I love your swag
You look like dad, you look just like your dad
You look like dad, you look just like your dad
All these kids, I'm they dad
