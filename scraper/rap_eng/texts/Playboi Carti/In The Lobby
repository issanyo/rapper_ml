[Chorus: Sosamann]
I got five hoes chillin' in the lobby
I got bitches watchin' me like Hachi Tachi
I tote choppers, got a partner, hit your noggin
Met a bitch in LA but she work in Follies

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Shawty wanna fuck, she fuck the party
With my partner 'nem, we rollinâ€™ off the molly
I'm with shawty 'dem, we bout to fuck in Follies
All my partner 'nem, I keep them goons around me
All my partner 'nem, I keep them goons around me
Pull up on your block, I keep that glocky (all my partner 'nem)
Diamonds on me skatin', perfect timing (ice, ice)
Shawty wanna fuck me, she gon' top me

[Chorus: Sosamann]
I got five hoes chillin' in the lobby
I got bitches watchin' me like Hachi Tachi
I tote choppers, got a partner, hit your noggin
Met a bitch in LA but she work in Follies

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
All these niggas wanna hit, this bitch a bonnie
Ill money, I'ma hit that bunny
Kill that nigga boy, like a bandit
Call my ex with a kick for the bonnet
For that bonnet, it get tired

All these niggas, all these niggas, fightin' Rocky

[Chorus: Sosamann]
I got five hoes chillin' in the lobby
I got bitches watchin' me like Hachi Tachi
I tote choppers, got a partner, hit your noggin
Met a bitch in LA but she work in Follies
