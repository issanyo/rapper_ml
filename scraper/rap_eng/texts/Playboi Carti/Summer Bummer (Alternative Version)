[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-Hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In making me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lies and black beaches

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins (yeah, yeah)
You can't escape my affection (yah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Wrap you up in my daisy chains (What? What? What? What?)
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, um (What? What? What? What? What?)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky, Playboi Carti & Lana Del Rey]
Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted (what?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (What? Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (Ooh, what?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But bankin' like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hatin' (Yeah)
What? (what? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Boppin'  (What?)
Milly Rockin' (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real (for real)
I might fuck with her all summer for real (your summer love for real boy)
They better not holla if I cuff her for real (when you're into your affliction)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Wrap you up in my daisy chains (What? What? What? What?)
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, um (What? What? What? What? What?)

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky,  Lana Del Rey & Playboi Carti]
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal (Hmm, hmm, hmm)
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real  (Hmm, hmm, hmm) (for real)
Truthfully between you and me I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey & A$AP Rocky]
High tops in the summer (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer, babe (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (babe)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, um (What? What? What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe
