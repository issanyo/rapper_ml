Might shoot up ya party (yeah)
Bitches they on me
Real street shit nigga
Zone 3
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Hook: Pollari and Playboi Carti] x2
Pollari and Carti (Pollari and Carti)
Might shoot up you party (Might shoot up ya party)
Might take all these bitches
They on me, they on me
They on me, they on me
I go high from the blunt
I can't play with these hoes
These niggas they know
These bitches they know

[Verse: Pollari]
From london to [?]
These bitches be tweakin
(Someone resume the rest of the lyrics)
