[Intro]
Ooh, plug!
This is how I'm rocking, no guitar
This is how I'm rocking, no guitar
Turn me up

[Verse]
She fell in love with lean so we're sipping in the stars
She fell in love with me, well so we fucking in the car
Why you mad, Lil Carti?
'Cause he fucking on your broad?
Nigga hating on me so we left him in the yard
All my niggas clout it up, mount it up
Give no fucks, turning
Ay, we turning up, we burning up
Gang with us, all we trust
Fucking up the check just to let 'em know whats up

[Chorus]
Steph Curry shoot the way I'm balling on you niggas
Then I pull up on you niggas, shooting triggers on you, nigga
And I keep the bean on me
Red light, red light
Pussy nigga, you can't see
I got money, I got lots of guap
Told me stop, huh, stop
