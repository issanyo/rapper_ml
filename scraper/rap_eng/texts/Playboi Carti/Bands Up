[Verse 1: Pi'erre Bourne]
Yeah, all on the web like tarantula
I took your bitch like it's ransom
She compliment, say I'm handsome
I got these bands like an anthem
These niggas fishy like salmon
Don't want no kids, want no tantrums
SossHouse the realest they mention
FaceTime your hoe 'cause you Samsung
Smoke so much dope got no damn lungs

Prescription, Pi'erre, she needs some
