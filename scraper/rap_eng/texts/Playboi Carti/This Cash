Carti

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
They ain't about this cash like I am
Girl you need to check your nigga
I'm just gon’ get rich with my fam
I don't really see no niggas
I'm in the shade, sipping on wine recline
Getting paid, Armani, shades, I'm blazed
Girl I'm not trynna fuck get out my face, my face
Get out my face, my face

[Verse 1: Cultie]
We fucked on a cloud
Her head still wet except when she on lot
Till her phone die
My Oakland city Folk wild
He on trial
Molly man, coke jock
Got the bandz god ????????
She tells me the pool is open goddamn I nose dive
Still 4 , 4 down got gold rounds they fly
Young nigga stay five deep I creep
Pull on scene nobody gon' try me four five when they see my heat
Still pour pimp on the low, gotta limp on a hoe
Making sure that the hookers see my steez
88 ready couldn't seen my teeth, R.I.P Papi
Still gotta place every night when I see my dreams
Pull up, not deep I see
Still bump Radiohead proudly muthafucka
I come thru gutbucket
Never gave a fuck
Cuz the way a nigga was raised in the east Atlanta six
I give my dick to a bad bitch and a
That's the way a nigga living
Carti ??? no Trippin

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
They ain't about this cash like I am
Girl you need to check your nigga
I'm just gon’ get rich with my fam
I don't really see no niggas
I'm in the shade, sipping on wine recline
Getting paid, Armani, shades, I'm blazed
Girl I'm not trynna fuck get out my face, my face
Get out my face, my face

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
I'm sipping recline with a freak
Diamonds all on my teeth
You can tell I'm cold when I speak
I ain't no terry dell; shoot for free
I got bitches all up on me
I'on steal keys nigga these are me
I'm smoking and choking with bitch thas foreign
Cartier that nigga I be
That's that pay shit

My patience is bad
I'on like to talk, nigga I like cash
Fuck bad shit, all of that
Bad bitches with ass
Gas all in my blunt
Trap on the cunts come, fuck some let me nut one
Get the fuck off I'm a boss
