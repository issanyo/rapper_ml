You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Verse: Playboi Carti]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause it get cold like Minnesota
Pour it in my soda
Bought my little sister some new Prada
Cause she gettin' a little older
I was posted down the boulder
And I fuck with rollies
Shady pop to the flat
Southside bloods never foldin'
I remember in the night
Around summertime
Hittin' licks on 25
Cause I know the world is mine
I was posted with my 5
Trapping packs or the lines
Got some new dope in my trap
Watch that boy hit your spine
I just fucked that nigga bitch
Bentley coupe shit
Got them stars in my roof so she know I'm with the shits
I'ma fuck her in the whip, fuck her in the whip
I'ma fuck her in the whip,  got her waitin' in the whip
