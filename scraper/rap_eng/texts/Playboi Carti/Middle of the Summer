[Intro: Playboi Carti]
Hold up
You know what I'm saying?
You know I seen Kesha and them back there
Yeah, Kesha
Got muhfuckin' Redd in this bitch
You know what I'm saying?
Know what I'm saying, real playa shit
Me and my bitch, nigga
Yeah, me and my hoe, nigga
We do this shit with real big, nigga
I said we do this shit for a big boy Patek
Walk in that shit, take over that thing

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I'm in the hood with niggas, don't bother me (check it out)
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan (check it out)
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me (check it out)
Shawty gon' get on top of me (what, what, what)
All of this ice in the summertime
Ain't no boy fucking with Carti, nah!

[Verse: Redd Coldhearted and Playboi Carti]
I'm in this bitch with young Carti (Carti)
Riding 'round with the top down
All of these bitches so naughty (What?)
They tryna fuck on us right now (Uh)
If Carti with it, then I'm ridin'
Got a hunnid on the neck
Ain't no stopping, bitch, I'm poppin'
You see this Rollie and this chain (Chain)
Bitch, I'm so icy, I'm cocky (Cocky)
Just dropped a fifty on my jeweler (Jeweler)
And told him, "Make sure it's shiny!" (Shiny)
It's Coldhearted and she got a stick
Right beside me, I'ma let it hit
I ain't really with the sucker shit
These niggas around me, you know they with it, yeah
These niggas around me you know they with it, yeah
They toting the Glocks and the dirty sticks, yeah
About Coldhearted they gon' pull up quick, yeah
They ready for war, yeah, you know they with it, yeah

[Bridge: Playboi Carti]
Me and my bitch lit, yeah, me and my homie
We do this shit with my hitman
You know what I'm saying?
I can't really complain about shit, man
(I said we do this shit for a big boy Patek)
Everything good, you know what I'm saying?
(Walk in that shit with my bih Red)
(Sippin' red drink nigga!)
Don't give a fuck what it look like

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I'm in the hood with niggas, don't bother me (check it out)
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan (check it out)
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me (check it out)
Shawty gon' get on top of me (what, what, what)
All of this ice in the summertime
Ain't no boy fucking with Carti, nah!
I'm in the hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me
Shawty gon' get on top of me
I'm in the hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me
Shawty gon' get on top of me
I'm in the hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me
Shawty gon' get on top of me
