Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Bad bitches wanna get us
And the model bitches, done did 'em
Big blunt, taste Skittles
You a little boy, yeah, you little
I'm on the Southside, where the bros at?
Get my Becky, get your hoe back
All the junkies knocking on the door asking Carti where the dope at

[Verse]
And I'm outside with that big shit on me
Yeah, where your coat at?
Take a pic of this drip
Better go grab your Kodak
I poured a whole four in that lemonade
Why you act like you ain't know that?
I'm on the xans for real
I'm on the percs, I'm on the molly
