[Intro]
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?

[Verse 1]
Money got longer
I feel like Uzi
Coming with groupies, walking with groupies
All of these hoes, ayy, all the hoes choosy
I got a bih
Ayy, what?
What?
What?
I feel like ooh
Money got long
Walking with groupies, bitches they choosy
Choosing no groupie
Acting your dog, these know how I'm booling
I give it to her
I keep it toted
Niggas is showing
But you afraid, ayy
Show off for me

[Verse 2]
I climb outta the--
Running a check
Fucking a check
Go fuck on her head though
Money get better
I get the check though
Diamonds look cheap
Niggas'll beef
Four hundred degrees
I'm feeling like jewels
All in the move
Shooting that ooh

[Outro]
Uzi
Shooting that ooh
