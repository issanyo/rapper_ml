[Hook: Playboi Carti]
I get the guap and I run it

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
I get the guap then I flip it, aye
Ice on my wrist, sick like syphilis
Nigga mad Boat fucked his mistress
India Love on my wish list
Sawed off shotty for the bodies
If I see Purpp that's a homi
That's on my soul, that's on God (Fuck Purpp)
For all my brothers I ride, ride
Run off the wheels on that five
I need that honey that, hive
Pull up on 'em, five guys
I ain't talkin' burgers, fries
I slapped the stack on her thighs
I give a fuck bout the bread
Fuck up that fuck up for pleasure
Box full of jewelry like treasure (Lil Boat!)

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap, guap, guap
I get the guap, guap, guap
I get the guap, guap, guap
I get the guap, guap, guap
I get the guap and I run it
I get the guap and I run it
