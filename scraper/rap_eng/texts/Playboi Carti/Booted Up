[Intro]
Kingston
Turn up

[Hook]
Diamonds blue, okay cool now
She don't go, I make her jump off the roof now
Ya I need a cup, too much juice now
Call your little ho, and she be up and down
Booted up, ya-ya, made her hold that down
Booted up, ya-ya, she be up and down
I'm booted up, ya-ya, made her turn around
She came through, ya-ya, just to fuck around

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti + Sean Kingston]
Diamonds blue, okay cool now, aye
Tat my whole neck cause I'm up now, ya
Throwin' hell guap, we ain't up and down
If I call your little ho, she be up and down
She up and downMile after mile of sayin' "Kingston I'm so freaky now"
Pussy wetter than the ocean so I might drown
How deep is your loving
She gone off that molly, gone off the drank
Till they call about 100 grey cash, what these haters might say
Cause I'm up now
And they know I'm up, woah-yeah

[Hook]
Diamonds blue, okay cool now
She don't go, I make her jump off the roof now
Ya I need a cup, too much juice now
Try your little ho, and see me up and out
Booted up, ya-ya, made her hold that down
Booted up, ya-ya, she be up and down
I'm booted up, ya-ya, made her turn around
She came through, ya-ya, just to fuck around

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
She came through just to fuck around
In Cali I'll smoke a pound
Sippin' on that Bobby Brown
Whitney Houston I be now
Switch up the flow, been gettin' dough
Top down, I'm on sunset, now I'm shinin' on you hoes
You was hatin', said I would never make it
Wish a nigga try to take it
Run up on me, you can hate fit
Run up on me you get shaked like bacon
And I ain't talkin' about the seasoning
Niggas be hatin' for no reason
Ball all day they play no defense
Ah feel like I'm Steph Curry
See that money in my face so I gotta run to it, ah
Ain't no talkin', ain't no playin' time is money
ENT, that's the gang that I'm reppin', ah

[Hook]
Diamonds blue, okay cool now
She don't go, I make her jump off the roof now
Ya I need a cup, too much juice now
Try your little ho, and see me up and out
Booted up, ya-ya, made her hold that down
Booted up, ya-ya, she be up and down
I'm booted up, ya-ya, made her turn around
She came through, ya-ya, just to fuck around
