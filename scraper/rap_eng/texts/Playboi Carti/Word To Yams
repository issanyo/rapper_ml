[Verse: J.R. Donato]
...

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I ain't worried bout no bitch
Thumbin' through the check
Boi, money got me sick
My Ex done got me sick
Aye, cash cash
My car go fast fast
Nigga, Ferrari smash
Money bags, Aye
Yeah, she all on my dick
I might just smash
Pass her to my clique
Then I hit her last
I ain't worried bout no bitch
Boi I'm off this gas, yeah
My phone blowin' up
I think they need some gas

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I ain't worried bout no bitch
Boi I'm off this gas
My phone blowin' up
I think they need some gas
Aye, these cops on my ass
Dirty kitchen, Dirty cash
Cash Carti, Money Bag$$
Yeah, hoe I keep a sack
Got a car filled with act
I'm a real ass nigga
40 clip with the strap
Blow a nigga off the map
Blowin' backwards in the trap, aye
Nigga talkin' down, boy my niggas spray

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I ain't worried bout no bitch
Thumbin' through the check
Boi, money got me sick
My Ex done got me sick
Aye, cash cash
My car go fast fast
Nigga, Ferrari smash
Money Bag$$, Aye
Yeah, she all on my dick
I might just smash
Pass her to my clique
Then I hit her last
I ain't worried bout no bitch
Boi I'm off this gas, yeah
My phone blowin' up
I think they need some gas

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
She a scene hoe

Pull down my pants, oh
Don't use yo hands, wow

You heard about me too
You heard I got them bands

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I ain't worried bout no bitch
Thumbin' through the check
Boi, money got me sick
My Ex done got me sick
Aye, cash cash
My car go fast fast
Nigga, Ferrari smash
Money bags, Aye
Yeah, she all on my dick
I might just smash
Pass her to my clique
Then I hit her last
I ain't worried bout no bitch
Boi I'm off this gas, yeah
My phone blowin' up
I think they need some gas
