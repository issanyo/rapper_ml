[Hook Playboi Carti]
I woke up with my jewelry on and sleeping with my .9 (woah)
Bitches on my phone, I ain't seen it in some time (hoe)
Walk inside Phipps and I spend a lil' time (hoe)
Designer frames, Gucci on my collar like a slime (hoe)
And I got a lot of tools, fuck you niggas (fuck parole)
I just turned the porch into a fucking stove (where we at)
I just turned a virgin bitch into a hoe (what what)
Designer steppin', baby we just countin' dough

[Verse Playboi Carti]
I was in Bankhead now I'm in Buckhead
Bitches want my cheese, want my bread, come get fed
Used to rock with Jess, used to rock with Glenn
Used to rock with Kiki, now I'll smash her friend
Running up the check
Hoe I like to eat eat
I'm countin' up again
All my hoes a fefe might just smash a twin
Came out the pen with 100 in my pants

Persona steppin', baby we just countin' though

[Verse 2 Unotheactivist]
I just pulled up on Lennox
Feelin' all my swag all these hoes need to back back
Used to be the partner with the belly that was bad bad
Fuckin' all the hoes we been had yall can have that
Steppin' out of Phipps with a mink
Inside cup dirty same color easter pink
Red dot on the beam for your blink
Put the nine under my pillow ever night go to sleep
