[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
JC
JC
I'm just, I'm just (makin')
Dead hoes, now wait
Hustle and aesthetic based
When the golden boys hit the corner
Scavengers surround the place
Even when I was saying grace they did that shit for satans sake
Thinking he can help, seen my niggas sent to heavens gates
Never heard of AK
Never had the time to play until the neighbors leave
Trans fool bitch it's time to skate
Tram to the devil it's the only time life makes sense
Fuck with the zombie you'll get redder than a white bitch
It's like my world is the residence
Life can be so pleasant when you living that shit reckless
Living that shit reckless

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Corduroys on a golden boy
Supreme team with gold blings
Signatures on they wings
Parachute bags, brass knuckles and knick knacks
Pockets full of cheddar and empty dime bags
Rollin up the hash with the fellas
Higher than ever
I dead 'em all where's the shovel?
Zombie gang to the other
Thats my brother JC
Just raised from another
Thats my nigga though we bringing bitches to the condo
I think they kinda shy though
It's still all good though
They say they from Toronto
I would have thought Chicago
They say they tryna smoke some
I say, "Bitch shake that ass though"
Weed got me fucked up
Can you please try to take it slow?
Hold up, you grab my pants try to see what your working with
You do too much
I'm just trying to fuck so whatchu sayin'?
Dont be playin'
I dont like to be upset too much
You blowin my high you tryna chill or what? (What)
