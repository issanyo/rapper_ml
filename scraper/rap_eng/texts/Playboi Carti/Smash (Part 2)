[Verse]
Juggin' and finessin', fuck that bitch, leave her abandoned
Trap house be abandoned, posted with my bandits
Lame niggas can't stand me, diamonds on me dancin'
Tell me who the man is, tell me who the man is
Bricks on the floor, cameras in the room
Two cups, styrofoam, bitch I'm on the moon
Keep the chopper on me, when I'm on the move
Money in my trues, and these bitches on me choosin'
I been on my shit, you can ask your bitch
I been on my shit, you can ask your bitch
All these hoes you wanna fuck, they been on my dick
All these hoes you wanna fuck, they been on this shit
Word around town, young Carti on his shit
I had to jugg that nigga cuz' he wasn't with the shits
Niggas talkin' drugs, he ain't never seen them bricks
I'm probably in South Fulton keeping that muhfucka lit
Cops come, track meet, we all split
If a nigga get caught, I don't know shit
I can't tell a soul, I'm on my own shit
Ya buddy unfamiliar, I don't know him
