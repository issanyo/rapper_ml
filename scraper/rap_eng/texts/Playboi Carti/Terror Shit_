[Verse 1]

South girl give me head while her nigga count his bread
And when i leave out this spot, don't let nobody in my crib
I got some shit up in that room
Some shit they don't assume
Some shit thats hard to consume
I don't mean digest by that
Got mid, got loud, got crack
Got pumps, AKs, and techs
These hoes haven't seen me flex
Drive around in an all white Lex
Nigga this ain't mine, this my ex
Yo new bitch, i guess
Yeah, she still tryna' have sex
Yeah, she still tryna have sex

Hook
Man i done gave up on these hoes
And now i count this dough
And now i sell this dope
Got no time for these hoes (x4)

[Verse 2]

We never been on the same page
We never been bout' the same thing
I cubied a campaign
(?)... got my old damn gang
These fuck niggas so damn lame
Tell these fuck niggas, "stay in they lane"
And you might want to check your main
Before he catch this fade
If you flop too much success
We puttin' work right in ya chest
Fuck nigga, you know wassup
Fuck nigga, yo hoe wanna' fuck
Damn, I told yo chick, fuck her plug
I got some drugs bitch, what you want

[Hook] (4)
Man i done gave up on these hoes
And now i count this dough
And now i sell this dope
Got no time for these hoes
