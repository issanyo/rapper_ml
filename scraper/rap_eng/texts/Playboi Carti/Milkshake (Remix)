[Verse 1: BOOTYCHAAAIN]
Tell me, who am I competin'?
Do I really need a reason?
Caddy you can never beat me
Bitch I'm so conceited
You is not a leader
You always in your feelings
I'm higher than the ceilin'
You is gonna need me
Hotter than a heater
Bitch you need me in the winter
Bitch you out outta season
That's not why I'm fuckin' with you
Alaways solo so I lay low
Like Glen Coco I'm a no show
Skip my own show, hit the art show
With my bro, bro and we all glo
Cause we both know
And we gotta see the same hoe
In the same clothes
You an angel
Can't say no to the yayo
You a gay hoe
Keep your nose closed
No, no

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Tell me, who is my opponent?
If it's Carti then they on it
Tell me, who the fuck I owe
I was smashin' niggas ho's
At the backdoor
Goin' out the backdoor
That's your main ho
That's my "Where you at ho?"
In the block though
Had it in my bag though
Broke up with my classy bitch and got a rap ho
Ayy girl I did this shit for you
Come count some real bands ho
Young Carti, bitch I ball like it's my last though
Early mornin'
Bitch I'm stonin' rollin' (stonin' uh)
Made it out the mud, I drink mud and I start zonin'
On my swag I go, I'ma need that bag though
Oh you rap though
Give rap for racks though
Ho's keep callin'
Free my jackals
I ain't on it
Come get on it
