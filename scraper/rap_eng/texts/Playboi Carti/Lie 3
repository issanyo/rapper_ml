[Intro]
This is a Dolan Beats production

[Verse 1]
Bitches got tight when I got some ice (ice, what?)
Matter of fact, fuck, we ain't even tight (okay, okay)
Left them in the dark, get yo' bitches right
Fuckin' on that hoe, he wasn't hittin' right (okay, what?)
Grippin' on my shit, like, who I'm hittin' tonight? (what?)
Margelia madman, baby, I'm the shit tonight
Call up the man, tell him get the ticket right
10 bands for Carti, baby, I ain't tryna lie
I ain't ask for it, I was chosen right (I was chosen right)
Two doors on it, I ain't even try to drive (I ain't tryna drive)
I'm off the lean, I'm off the percs for real (I'm off the percs for real)
I'm off them drugs, I'm off them drugs for real (the drugs for real)

[Chorus]
I ain't even lie, I can't even drive
I ain't even lie, I can't even drive
I ain't even lie, I can't even drive
I ain't even lie, I can't even drive

[Verse 2]
See those girls inside, see these guns inside?
Baby let's go ride, let's go ride or die
Look me in my eye, you the shit tonight (okay)
Look me in my eye, you the shit tonight (okay)
Everything was on me
Everything was on me
Put everything on me
Shawty, shawty, you can come and lean on me

[Chorus]
I can't even lie
I can't even drive, I can't even lie
I can't even drive, I can't even drive

[Verse 3]
Bitches got tight when I got some ice
Niggas got tight when I got some ice
Matter of fact, fuck all niggas, we ain't even tight
Left that nigga in the dark, fix yo' vision right
Fuckin' on his bitch, he weren't here right
Grippin' on my shit, like, who the fuck I'm hittin' tonight?
Margelia madman, baby, I'm the shit tonight
[?] promoted get the ticket right
Ten bands for it, I'ma set tonight
I ain't ask for it, I was chosen right
Two doors on it, I ain't tryna drive
Top off, open, see the girls inside
See the hoes inside
See guns inside, baby, let's go ride
Let's go ride or die, look me in my eye
Look me in my eye, okay, baby, you the shit tonight
We gon' do this shit tonight, girl tonight (what?)
Look me in my eye
We gon' do this shit tonight
Look me in my eye, do this shit tonight
