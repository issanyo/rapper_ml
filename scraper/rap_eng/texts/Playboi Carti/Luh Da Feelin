[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
It's been a minute since I been up in this bitch
Looking like a fucking walking lick
All this jewelry on me got me sick
She done fell in love with my wrist
I done fell in love with the pack
Ferragamo waist and a strap
Dread head nigga don't need no hat
Knock a pussy nigga off the map
They like Carti be that nigga I should try to fuck with him
Get a song with him
You a fuck nigga
I can't fuck with ya
Im a fuck nigga
I might try a nigga
I might mug a nigga
Boy that extendo work will kill ya
I been 'round some real thug niggas
Slugga slugga yeah that's my brotha'
On these pussy niggas man they undercover
I had to kill em with the sticks i had to kill em
Blowing down a pound boy it's no reggie miller
Bring your bitch around nigga I might just steal
Hoe I got them bands i cannot kiss
All my diamonds dancing on me nigga
Got them stripper bitches dancing on me nigga
Watch me stuff these racks all up in my denim
Nigga nigga nigga

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
I can't trust a bitch hoe just wait a minute
Pull up in foreign I took off the ceiling

[Verse 2: Slug Christ]

Better watch the way I lift the llama

Double cup is all i'm feelin
Bought a new gucci wearin' gucci
With the bitch like a whip da whoopdy whoopdy loopy
You don't fuck with me then you don't know me
None these bitches don't fuckin' on me

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
I can't trust a bitch hoe just wait a minute
Pull up in foreign I took off the ceiling

She just wanna fuck cuz i'm worth a million
