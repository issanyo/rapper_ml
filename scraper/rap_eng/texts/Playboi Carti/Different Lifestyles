[Chorus]
A different lifestyle now
Shine of money make the girls fall in love
Make the girls wild up
A different lifestyle now
Shine of money make the girls fall in love
Make the girls wild up

[Verse]
White boy, white boy (hol up)
White boy Abercrombie, I got that crack
I'm in the trap right now, so call me back
I'm with my slatt right now, we count them racks
I spent like twenty thou', thats just on gas
And ain't no coming back, if you won't last
All my niggas blatt (Blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt)
I was a jit smoking gas, I was on my ass
I'ma make out this list, I was on they ass

[Chorus]
A different lifestyle now
Shine of money make the girls fall in love
Make the girls wild up
A different lifestyle now
Shine of money make the girls fall in love
Make the girls wild up

[Outro]
A different lifestyle now
Shine of money make the girls fall in love
Make the girls wild up
A different lifestyle now
Shine of money make the girls fall in love
Make the girls wild up
