(Hook: Yamine)
Where you from homie?
Where you from? (where)
Where you from homie?
Where you from? (tell me)
I'm riding around town with a drum (with the drum)
I'm riding around town to your mum (you liar)
Where you from homie?
Where you from? (where)
Where you from homie?
Where you from? (tell me)
If you messing with me then your done (your done)
I'm from riding with the beef where you run (you run)

(Verse 1: Yamine)
Where you from homie? (homie)
I don't know (i don't know)
Cuz your starting to make me mad
It's time to go (yeah bro)
So broke no loose, Mangolia
I'm like a goose
I'm on that Smokepurpp shit and I got the proof
Niggas wildin' out here
Planting fires out here (yup)
Burning up some bushes
And having no fear (nope)
Come around my block
I'll have you shedding in tears (waaahhhh)
Playboi Carti is the type of nigga
That'll shoot you like a deer (POW)
Niggas don't play when it comes to that bread
And we definitely don't play around bitches..... no head (nope)
I'm just trying to fuck
But she playing around (stop playing)
Now I grab the truck
And start fucking you now! (in the back)

If you messing with me then your done (your done)
I'm from Pontiac Street where you run (you run)

(Verse 2)
I've been in and out of the tuck, tuck, tuck
If you messin around with me, you go, duck. duck, duck
Ride or die my nigga love, love, love
Ride or die my nigga dove, dove, dove
My young DJ shot running in these streets
Selling dope off to niggas
And messing with the beef
Nigga pulled the fucking trigger
Now he paralyzed for weeks
Momma told him he from 38th, but he was roamin' Zone 3
Niggas tryna give advice, but they don't listen
Niggas tryna roll some dice, but they too broke to pay attention
Losing all them bets, (where Drake at?) he ain't spendin
My younging retired too early, now there's Lil Uzi intervention
