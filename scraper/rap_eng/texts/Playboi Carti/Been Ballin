[Verse 1]
I got more chains than La Flare (what, what, La Flare)
I got more guns than TIP (what, what, than TIP)
I fuck the hoe like a pimp (pimp, what, what?)
She feelin' my swag, she feelin' my drip (drip, drip, what, drip)
I walk with the bag, I walk with a limp
I walk with the bag, walk with a limp
You talkin' to Cash, you talkin' a pimp
You talkin' to Cash, you talkin' a pimp
These niggas so weak, that nigga a simp
You niggas so weak, that nigga a simp
I hop in the Lamb, she leave in a lyft
I hop in that what, what?
I came with the swag, came with a gift (what, what?)
I hop in the Porsche, she hop in the kick (what, what?)
I'm sippin' that TEC, I'm sippin' that drip (what, what?)
All in a bag, I'm all in a [?]
