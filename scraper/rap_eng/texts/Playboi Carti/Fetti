[Intro: Playboi Carti]
Gas in my blunt
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Lean in my cup, what the fuck?
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready, fetti on fetti
Money bags, yeah, uh
Money bags, nigga, uh
Fetti on fetti on fetti
Fetti on fetti on fetti
Fetti on fetti on fetti (yah, yah)

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I'm still pouring up
I can see in his face, designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face, that ho give me faith
Damn, that ho give me faves
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready, I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready, fetti on fetti on fetti
I can’t go in, I ain’t ready, I can’t go in, I ain’t ready
Fetti on fetti

[Post-Hook: Da$H]
I can't go in, I ain’t ready
I can't go in, I ain’t ready, that drank on me heavy
I can't go in, I ain’t ready
I can't go in, I ain’t ready, them pills kicking heavy
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready, that 40 too heavy
I can't go in I ain’t ready
I can't go in, I ain’t ready, just count up my fetti

[Verse 1: Da$H]
So
Yeah, So
Mr. Never Lacking, bust a package
Bills can get paid off of rappin', still I keep to trappin'
Used to hunnid sack it, now I fuck an actress
Shit, I'm just thinkin' how it happened
Had to get explicit, had to make 'em listen
Moving out them pounds, niggas started snitchin'
Loading up them rounds, niggas started missin'
Move it out of town, and Tommy Cruise the mission
Converse with my addictions, don't talk I just listen
Five drugs that I'm mixin', money only thing on my vision
Infatuated with them semi's and 'matics
All of my niggas is thugs with some habits
Like grandma TV, we been with the static
I fuck on this bitch and she say she from Memphis
Opiated so I'm demonstratin' my emotion less
Got some real niggas quotin' this, got yo' main bitch hoein shit
Lost a few things as of recent, life is anything but decent
Blow the re-up on my teeth
It's the only time you catch me cheesin'
It's Dolla

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I’m still pouring up
I can see in his face, designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face, that ho give me faith
Damn, that ho give me faves
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready, I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready, fetti on fetti on fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready, I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on fetti

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Shipping a pack and it's vacuum sealed
30 on 40, keep that concealed
Just bought a pint, I'm a crack the seal
Strap on my side like a Navy SEAL
Three in the morning, we trapping still
Matte black on rover, the Batmobile
Don’t trust that nigga cause he gon squeal
Not buying shit if the pack not sealed
I'm faded, I’m faded, off xannies I’m wasted
My bitches they nasty, they suck it and taste it
I’m short on my patience, I’m serving my patient
I’m very impatient, little bitch come get naked
Pack coming in but I don’t need to weigh it
Choppa en route, I shoot once and you spraying
Can’t come in my trap, the front door is gated
My prices inflated, my plug name is David
Dripping through the city got a little bitch in Babee'Os
Fucked me on the spot cause she heard me on the radio
3 bitches, one of me, that's a perfect ratio
Don’t wanna fuck the ho, I just want fellatio
Let her play with the nut, put it in her booty hole
Pop a couple pills and I beat it like a stereo
Stuffed cup, backwoods, riding 'round, merry-go
Cup need a oil change, Actavis I love to po'
Hit a stain, hogging lanes, gripping grain, getting throwed
Leave you brains in the grain, you another John Doe
No holds barred when you see me, Imma let it go
No mo' 'gars so we rolling up the fronto
No mo 'gars cause we rollin out the fronto
I'm in H-town, nigga, and I can never go

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I’m still pouring up
I can see in his face, designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face, that ho give me faith
Damn, that ho give me faves
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can’t go in, I ain't ready, I can’t go in, I ain't ready
I can’t go in, I ain't ready, fetti on fetti on fetti
I can’t go in, I ain't ready, I can’t go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on fetti
