[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
It's never too late to be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
It's never too late to leave if you wanna leave
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby, I got a feelin' in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
Uh, her sophistication make you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted (what?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (What?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But bankin' like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hatin' (Yeah)
What? (what? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Boppin'  (What?)
Milly Rockin' (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real
I might fuck with her all summer for real
They better not holla if I cuff her for real
Niggas better run for cover for real
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey]
White lies and black beaches, miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me, "Have patience"
Baby, I need this, white lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches and blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons in makin' me crazy
But you've got your reason, white lies and black beaches

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Don't be a bummer
Don't be a

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
Don't be a bummer, babe
