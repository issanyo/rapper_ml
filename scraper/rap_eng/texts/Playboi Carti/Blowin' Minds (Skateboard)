[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Man, always bout some petty shit
That shit blowin' off
I'ma come clean

[Chorus: Chief Keef & Playboi Carti]
All new watch, that bitch blow minds (beep)
When we show up, you know it's showtime (what?)
I don't skateboard, but I'm on my grind (beep)
Hundred thousand, all hundreds, it'll blow a bitch mind

[Post-Chorus: Chief Keef & Playboi Carti]
When I was in the jungle we was blowin' 9s (straight up)
Just hit a nigga bitch for the second time (straight up)
And you know I gotta cross the finish line (woah)
You can't stand me bitch? Sit it down

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
When we in the field, it's a touchdown (gang)
And you know your bitch is a bustdown (gang)
She gon' turn around and get turnt out (gang)
Hopped up in a foreign car, then I burnt out (yeah)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I don't waste time on the FaceTime (nah)
R.I.P the pussy, leave it face down (yah)
Two best friends at the same time (woo, woo)
Two best friends at the same time (woo, woo)
Flava Flav clock by my waist line (tik, tok)
I find it funny how she blow time (tik, tok)
Forward lil mama cause she hold it down (shh, quiet)
Nickname her Karma 'cause she go around (that's right)
When she come around, better not fuck around (mhmm)
Write a couple bars, I bet I blow your mind
Deadly with the pins, I don't bowl around
Mercedes Benz, I roll around
Like 80 bands, when I walk around (yah)

[Chorus: Chief Keef & Playboi Carti]
All new watch, that bitch blow minds (beep)
When we show up, you know it's showtime (what?)
I don't skateboard, but I'm on my grind (beep)
Hundred thousand, all hundreds, it'll blow a bitch mind

[Post-Chorus: Chief Keef & Playboi Carti]
When I was in the jungle we was blowin' 9s (straight up)
Just hit a nigga bitch for the second time (straight up)
And you know I gotta cross the finish line (what?)
You can't stand me bitch? Sit it down

[Verse 3: Playboi Carti]
In the Hellcat, yeah, burning out (ooh, ooh)
Let the window down, yeah, air it out (ooh, what?)
Lay a nigga down, ooh, lay him down (ooh, what?)
I'ma hit that bih with a hundred rounds! (ooh, ooh)
All my bitches bad, and they poking out (ooh, bad)
Pull up with them knots, yeah, I'm ashin' out (ooh, cash)
Aston Martin coupe, yeah, cashing out (ooh, ooh)
All black Rollie, yeah, bust down (ooh, what?)

[Chorus: Chief Keef & Playboi Carti]
All new watch, that bitch blow minds (beep)
When we show up, you know it's showtime (what?)
I don't skateboard, but I'm on my grind (beep)
Hundred thousands, all hundreds, it'll blow a bitch mind

[Verse 4: A$AP Nast & A$AP Rocky]
What’s the word?
I just saw your hoe up on the strip and she look thirsty
Gave that hoe my number, told her call me up for certain
Yeah, I know what’s it’s worth
Give that pussy up, and if it’s wet, I’ll buy a purse
(I don’t be trickin') Ridin' in my Murc'
Seat way back, bumpin' new Lil Uzi Vert, aye
Diamonds dance like Carlton
You can see them through my shirt, aye
Flexin’ on these niggas, know they see me and it hurt
(Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex)
Flexin’ on these niggas, I be with them geeks
But make one phone call, you get hit up
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, blatt!)

[Chorus: Chief Keef & Playboi Carti]
All new watch, that bitch blow minds (beep)
When we show up, you know it's showtime (what?)
I don't skateboard, but I'm on my grind (beep)
Hundred thousands, all hundreds, it'll blow a bitch mind

[Post-Chorus: Chief Keef & Playboi Carti]
When I was in the jungle we was blowin' 9s (straight up)
Just hit a nigga bitch for the second time (straight up)
And you know I gotta cross the finish line (what?)
You can't stand me bitch? Sit it down
