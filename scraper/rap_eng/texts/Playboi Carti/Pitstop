[Hook]
Feel like Tupac
Niggas wanna play
Get like two glocks
I been winning all day I need a pitstop

[Verse]
Blew that shit, but I kept the band
Blew that shit (Yuh, ooh)
And I only fuck wit thick hoes
I'm a skinny nigga, I wear tight clothes
I got jammed up but never twice though
I got band up and bought some ice hoe
Yea these nigga wanna be me, he got my flow
That's aight doe, I'm like Mike hoe
I'm on top doe, fuck yo height hoe
You a dyke hoe, sike hoe
I'm like crack, like the white, shit is sour note

[Hook]
Feel like Tupac
Niggas wanna play
Get like two glocks
I been winning all day I need a pitstop
