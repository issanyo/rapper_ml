[Intro]
Let's go overseas
Yo, turn my autotune off? Just put the reverb on
Yo, turn me up, yuh

[Verse]
Lets go overseas
What you need? I can feed
In that Beamer coupe, blow the steam
Shawty turned off her phone, shawty T'd
Aye, uh
What the fuck you mean, lil boy?
Flexing like you me, lil boy
Diamonds in my teeth, lil boy
You just want to be the boy
Treat the broad like she my boy
'Cause I dont really need a boy
I dont wanna see her boy
Aye, aye
Like fuck that shit, boy
Fuck a bitch, boy
Go get that guap, boy
This shit don't stop, boy
Shit don't stop, boy
