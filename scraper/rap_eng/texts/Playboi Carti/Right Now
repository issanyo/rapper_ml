[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, now
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I let her count it
Too much to balance
I can't even balance
Got a bitch in my palace
And she work at Palace
And a bih at Magic
And she let me have it
She let me smash it, she let me pet it
Baby no cap (baby no cappin')
I'm on the block I got the Glock
I want the static
I got the bitch all on the pipe, just like a addict
I got the bih all on the pipe calling me daddy
I'm with the stick, I'm in the 6, I'm in the wagon
I'm in the bitch, I'm in the bricks, I'm in the ashes
I got that white I got that dope, I got that ashy
Sellin' that soap, sellin' that soap, selling that nasty
I'm on the block, just like a po', fuckin' a bandit
I'm on the block, I got them Rolls, I got them Benjis
We gotta go, we gotta go, hop in the Ghost
Then I go ghost
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now

[Verse 2: Pi'erre Bourne]
Back then to right now, hey
Back to the future, hey
Did it all off computers, hey
Bill Gates, aye
All my bills paid, aye
For real
Got that good gas, for real
Put you on your ass, for real
Got that good gas, for real
Put you on your ass, for real
Yeah I flex for real
Yeah they mad for real
I got cash, for real
Hunnid dollar bills
Yeah, these all blue bills
Yeah, motherfuck how you feel
I'm not Dr. Phil, fresh to death where my will
She just got called to get killed
And she say I'm skilled
And she call me Dolittle
Yeah I'm talking to my dogs

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now, ooh, ooh
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now, right now (right now)
Now

[Bridge: Playboi Carti]
I got bitches wanna see Pi'erre right now
I got bitches wanna see Carti right now
All these diamonds in my teeth, I had to smile
Right now, right now
Told that bitch to get down right now
Touch your toes, bend it over right now
All this money, all this guap, it's in the pad

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Right now, right now
Now, right now
Now, right now
Now, right now
