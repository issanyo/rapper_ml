[Intro]
Buzz 'em in, buzz 'em in
Buzz 'em in, buzz 'em in
Buzz 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in, let 'em in (Yuh, yuh)
Okay, aight
Y'all niggas shut the fuck up
Nigga, this a lot
I'm finna go up this bih now, hol 'up

[Chorus]
Got some bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me
Bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me, ayy
Bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me
Buzz 'em in, buzz 'em in
Buzz 'em in, buzz 'em in
Buzz 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in, let 'em in

[Verse]
Yuh, stamina, I fuck that bih all night
Bitch, you better not marry her 'cause she in love with pipe
Pass it to the squad, pass it to the right
Pass it to the left, did it by myself
I keep a pole like a dyke
My hoe like to do the white
I spent a hunnit bands, that's spike
Niggas mad 'cause I'm right
I'm rockin' Gucci with the spikes, rockin' Gucci to the floor
I crack a seal and need some ice
My diamonds blingin' with no light
The bitch is choosin' all the price
They wanna fuck me by the night
If niggas say they got a problem, we can do this shit on sight
Got a .4 bullet, coolin' with my nigga Bloody Mike
I hit L.A. and tell my jeweller, "Get young Carti super icy"
(Ayy, what, what, what)

[Chorus]
Got some bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me
Bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me, ayy
Bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me
Buzz 'em in, buzz 'em in
Buzz 'em in, buzz 'em in
Buzz 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in, let 'em in, yuh

[Chorus]
Got some bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me
Bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me, ayy
Bitches, they callin'
They said they tryna pull up on me
Buzz 'em in, buzz 'em in
Buzz 'em in, buzz 'em in
Buzz 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in, let 'em in (Yuh, yuh)
