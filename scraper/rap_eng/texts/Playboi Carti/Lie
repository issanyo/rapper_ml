[Verse 1]
Bitches got tight when I got some ice
Matter of fact, fuck, we ain't even tight
Left them in the dark, get yo' vision right
Fuckin' on his hoe, he wasn't hittin' right
Grippin' on my shit, like, who I'm hittin' tonight?
Margelia madman, baby, I'm the shit tonight
Call up the man, tell him get the ticket right
10 bands for Carti, baby, I ain't tryna lie
I ain't ask for it, I was chosen right
Two doors on it, I ain't even try to drive
I'm off the lean, I'm off the percs for real
I'm off them drugs, I'm off them drugs for real

[Chorus]
I ain't even lie, I can't even drive
I ain't even lie, I can't even drive
I ain't even lie, I can't even drive
I ain't even lie, I can't even drive

[Verse 2]
See those girls inside, see these guns inside?
Baby let's go ride, let's go ride or die
Look me in my eye, you the shit tonight
Look me in my eye, you the shit tonight
Everything was on me
Everything was on me
Put everything on me
Shawty, shawty, you can come and lean on me

[Chorus]
I can't even lie
I can't even drive, I can't even lie
I can't even drive, I can't even drive

[Secret Verse 3]
Bitches got tight when I got some ice
Niggas got tight when I got some ice
Matter of fact, fuck them niggas, we ain't even tight
Left that nigga in the dark, fix yo' vision right
Fuckin' on his bitch, he wasn't here right
Grippin' on my shit, like, who the fuck I'm hittin' tonight?
Margelia madman, baby, I'm the shit tonight
Call the promoter get the ticket right
Ten bands for it, I'ma sit tonight
I ain't ask for it, I was chosen right
Two doors on it, I ain't tryna drive
Top off, open, see the girls inside
See the hoes inside
See the guns inside, baby, let's go ride
Let's go ride or die, look me in my eye
Look me in my eye, okay, baby, you the shit tonight
We gon' do this shit tonight, girl tonight
Look me in my eye
You the shit tonight, tonight
Do that shit tonight, okay
Look me in my eye, do this shit tonight
