[Intro]
Who got? Who got
Who got beef with me
Who got? Who got
Who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Who got beef with me

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I got niggas in the streets do 70 years for me
Kill for me, R.I.P
Got a hoe all in my bed, she gon' freak for me
I spend a bag and get it back, I flex like Hercules
AK with the beam for who got beef with me
I talk that guapanese, she tryin' rock wit me
And pop a ox wit me, I ball like Barkley
Just bought some Robin jeans, she can't stop topping me
That's why he plot on me, that's why he jock on me
Cuz I get on the beat and answer like it's callin' me
Cuz I get on your hoe and shh, 'cause she callin' me

[Hook]
Who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Man who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Beef with me
Who got beef with me
Man who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Got beef with me
Man I keep that heat up off for who got beef with me
Man I keep that heat up off for who got beef with me
Man I keep that shh up on me for who got beef with me

[Verse 2: Ethereal]
Beef with me? Who got beef with E?
All these niggas free, that's why they hate on me
Cash Carti and Yung Eazy, pull up kill the scene
You movin' backwards if you thinkin' you got beef with me
They said you tried to sneak diss but I did not see
Got boys that hit for me, shh, R.I.P
I been in the streets, let them sleep on me
You let em' steal yo swag, they can't steal shit from me
You niggas small range, making small change
Yung Eazy like the interstate, I got 6 lanes
Call me cream corn nigga I been running thangs
Your whole clique lame, I can't feel yo pain
Told Lil Carti man we taking off like planes
Boy we in the paint, you ain't in the game
Lookin' at the goal, I can't see yo face
Now I'm back on go bitch you in my way

[Hook]
Who got beef with me

Man who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Got beef with me
Man I keep that heat up off for who got beef with me
Man I keep that heat up off for who got beef with me
Man I keep that shh up on me for who got beef with me
