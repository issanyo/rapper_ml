[Hook: Carti]
All I have is faith, all I have is faith
Kitchen in the stove, trap real estate
Damn, I sold my soul to this fuckin' weight, forwhat?
Two Glocks on me and a throwaway
All I have is faith, All I have is faith
Kitchen in the stove, trap real estate
Damn I sold my soul to this fuckin' weight
Two Glocks on me and a throwaway

[Verse: JuiceDaSavage]
All I have is faith, boy the house movin' weight
Had to keep my mask on, I can never show my face
Gotta watch out for the snakes, watch out for the Jakes
I can never trust a bitch, since a youngin' that's how I play
I'm all about my hundreds, boy get the fuck up out my face
Young nigga on the money, huh runnin' in one place
Got that money in my hand, motherfucka' I don't dance
Throw some racks in your bitch face just show her I'm the man
Me and Cash Carti [?] out
We be fuckin' up bands
From Chiraq, to the eight
Bitches know we the man

[Hook: Carti]
All I have is faith, all I have is faith
Kitchen in the stove, trap real estate
Damn, I sold my soul to this fuckin' weight, forwhat?
Two Glocks on me and a throwaway
All I have is faith, all I have is faith
Kitchen in the stove, trap real estate
Damn I sold my soul to this fuckin' weight
Two Glocks on me and a throwaway
