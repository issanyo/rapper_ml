Pipe up, pipe up

[Intro]
Sauce em' up like Melo
Sauce em' up like Melo
She can't even come over unless she bring a friend no fellow
Sauce em' up like Melo
She can't even come over unless she bring a friend or fellow

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Young Carti, young Creflo
Countin' up like Creflo
Shootas on my front porch
Serve you at the front door
Goons, thugs, cutthroats
Pipe up
How could I front those?
Them blocks, them blocks, them blocks
Yeah we run those
My chain, my watch, my watch
Yeah I'm so cold
Niggas talkin' fashion, bout that action
I went Nino
Movin' in a rover
Movin' with a odor
Ziploc then I go up
Yo bitch made me throwup
Diamonds do the holdup
Make a play then po' up
Diamonds do the holdup
Make a play then

[Hook: Playboi Carti]

That bitch ain't fuckin' we gon' kick her out the room
She say y'all niggas be the truth we say true
Countin' up, fillin' up them Tru's
She ain't gotta ask me what I do
Thumbin' through the check with my crew
She gon' fuck on me then my crew
She gon' fuck on me then my crew
She gon' fuck on me then my crew

[Verse 2: Lucki Eck$]
Yah, yah, yah
Five green monsters
10 percs for my bitch grandmama
Aye, aye, aye
She just fuck with me for my views
Aye, aye, aye
Servin' purp n' lean, don't drink booze
Aye, aye, aye
Think you robbin' me, dude is boozed n' confused
On some skinny jeans, but you see this move on me too what a fool
Aye, aye
Carti got a stain in play
Hit that first then pass that ye off right to twin I'm Ray J
Scoop me on a payday
She gon' catch me off of Snapchat
She just copped my re-up, I let my plug tax now
Least that I back down, boy check my background
I been crappin' niggas points since the backgrounds
