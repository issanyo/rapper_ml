[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)

The sunshine (yuh, yuh)

Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)
And we grind (yuh, yuh)
To that light (yuh, yuh)

[Verse 1: $onoma]
Twenty-nine million different grinds money all the time
Ruby bitch always hit my line when they see me shine
Twirl that little bitch, she give me face, then they give me space
Smoke a blunt, now I'm outer space, diamonds like a lake
I don’t give a fuck about a pussy boy nigga tryin' hate
I just give a fuck about my weed and counting up this cake
See you chillin' kissin’ all your bitches see you tryin' cake
I'm just laughing cause I hit that bitch and nutted on her face
Choppa' put a nigga in his place, need her on my waist
And she leave you wet just like a pussy, come and get a taste
I ain't playin' with no pussy nigga I might catch a case
And I'mma beat that shit, but if I don't i’m gonna do the race

[Chorus Playboi Carti]
Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)
And we grind (yuh, yuh)
To that light (yuh, yuh)
The sunshine (yuh, yuh)

Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)
And we grind (yuh, yuh)
To that light (yuh, yuh)
The sunshine (yuh, yuh)

Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)
And we grind (yuh, yuh)
To that light (yuh, yuh)
The sunshine (yuh, yuh)

Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)
And we grind (yuh, yuh)
To that light (yuh, yuh)
The sunshine (yuh, yuh)

[Verse 2: Demotus]
Nigga real shit, molly ketamine-min
I’mma numb her up, I'll blow you up
Million dollar face felling numb
Steal your bitch now you feeling dumb
Only fuck with the old you
Cause the new bitch a lame, you a stain
Yeah that little bitch a thot
I’ve been sippin' on wat
Yeah I've been fallin' down, kinda high
I knew you wanna [?] self
Why should I give a fuck about you (about you yeah)
You can cut it out bring it back put it in
I was born to win put the [?]
Tryin’ rub her down, numb the pain
With the bud, fuck the pain
Pedal to the floor just a bit
And i'm [?] here

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)
And we grind (yuh, yuh)
To that light (yuh, yuh)
The sunshine (yuh, yuh)

Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)
And we grind (yuh, yuh)
To that light (yuh, yuh)
The sunshine (yuh, yuh)

Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)
And we grind (yuh, yuh)
To that light (yuh, yuh)

Twenty-nine (aye, yuh)

To that light (yuh, yuh)
The sunshine (yuh, yuh)
