Yeah, what, diamonds all on my teeth

Foreign, foreign whip it, yeah, what is it called
Pull up in that shit lil' bitch, yeah, like a boss
Had a lil' bitch from down south, yeah, put that shit all in her mouth, ay
Eatin' on veggies and salmon, ay, no I'm not eatin' no trout
Boy you a bitch, boy you a snitch, heard you gon' bring them cops out
Talkin' that shit, you ain't on shit, really you ain't gon' pop out
Gettin' money that's why they hate on me, still on that paper route

Hoe I got lean I got bars, ooh, hoe I got lean I got bars, ooh
Hoe I fuck her 'cause I'm hard, ooh

[Bridge: Lil Uzi Vert]
Choppa that's full auto, kickflip bitch, Otto
Dressed in all black, sharp as a tack
Cut that bitch off, Zoro

[Verse 3: Offset]
(Offset!)
I took your bitch, yeah you lost, told her come fuck with some bosses
Invited that bitch to my loft, hold on bitch, take your shoes off
The sauce I been drippin', the sauce I been drippin'
No, I'm not trustin' these bitches
No, I don't fuck with these snitches, no
Uzi got choppas, extensions
How come Iâ€™m all in her mentions, ay, and my Rollie three dimensional
Bitches dangerous like Mystikal, these niggas clone you, get your chemicals
Twin choppers they identical, my hands in everything, got tentacles
Poppin' Percys like the minerals, fuck you my hand on my genitals
When on the stage I got adrenaline, bout' to flex up on my enemies
I don't need negative energy, these niggas not who they pretend to be

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Uhm, she shake it fast
Yeah, she drop it slow
Huh, what, yeah
Neck on froze
