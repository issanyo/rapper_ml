Bitch I got it
If you need it, get to speeding
Like andale, andale, andale
Andale, andale, andale
Andale

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I ain't gotta lie, you already know
He can't kill our vibe girl you ain't his hoe
I swear this bitch was riding, still won't tell a soul
Only one night and I was in that hoe
Red light, green light, stay on go
I got fam up in jail bitch, ready to come home
I got it on the scale and I know it off the dome
I swear I get it off
Young Carti get it on
Tell me what you want
Come and pop this Perc
You won't feel it tho
I say, come and sip this drink
You won't feel it tho

Henny con Cranberry
I'm feeling so wavy
She said venga papi
She think she my baby
Mira mira, ven aqui
Dame beso, dame cheecha
She always let me beat
Said she love all of my features
I hit it every week
Love her boca use no teeth
Sometimes she bring her friend
That's my boo she's such a leader
She bonita
Popping pills and rolling refer
Phone is filled with option so I hit and go hit and go
Run around the country hitting different hoes in different code
Keeping it together getting difficult, switch my phones
Hustling for days and I ain't switch my clothes
Bitch you know I got it
But I want some more
Hit me for the quote
Splashing on these hoes
Carti and the rose

[Hook: Justin Rose] x2
Bitch I got it
If you need it, get to speeding
Like andale, andale, andale
Andale, andale, andale
Andale
