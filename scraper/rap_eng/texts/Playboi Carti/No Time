[Intro: Playboi Carti]
(Yeah)
Wake up in the mornin' know I gotta do this shit
Ay let's do it
(Cannon)
Yeah, hey, heyo, hey, hey, yeah

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
Clear my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She in diamonds (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
Clear my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She a Dime (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Four, five, six, seven bitches keep callin' my line
Ya cap like Mitchell and Ness lil' nigga stop lyin'
Chop that top in my lamb I'm livin' my life
Chopped up chicken and shrimp cut in my rice
Spanish bitch call me Papi I can make her my wife (My wife)
She want new Versace, put Medusa on her eyes
Me and Cash Carti got them sisters 'bouta put 'em on a flight (Put 'em on a flight)
Diamonds in my Cartier lens
You can see 'em at night (See 'em at night)
Call Balmain, ask 'em why my jeans so tight (jeans so tight)
Trippin' off lanes, I don't think you really wanna ride
Guns don't want mine on you, you not my kind
5, 6, 7, 8.. so many watches ain't wastin' my time

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
Clear my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She in diamonds (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
Clear my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She in diamonds (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
My bitch fine
You ain't lyin'
My big bank
These niggas been biting
But my diamonds keep bitin'
These hoes be bitin'
These niggas be bitin'
Bitch I'm the bomb, Bin Laden
Got a bitch on the line right now
Say she got Molly, yeah
Sorry, I don't do sour
OG you know me
Cold outside I need a long sleeve
Yeah, ballin' on yo' hoe like Kobe
Dunkin' on yo' hoe like no D
Bald head like Gin√≥bili
Piru, watch my nose bleed
That boy dead
Arm and leg
Getting checks
Turnin' your head, take yo bag

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
Clear my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She in diamonds (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
Clear my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She in diamonds (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'
