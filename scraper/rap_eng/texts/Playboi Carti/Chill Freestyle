[Hook]
Tell these niggas chill man (tell these niggas chill)
They gon' want beef, I always keep the steel
Hatin' on my music (uh) or my sex appeal
You know I got them ho's, can't take no ho for real (can't take no ho for real)
Money make the world go (money make the world go)
Money make them panties go (money make them panties go)
I'm off them Xannies though (Xannies ho)
Carti, I got many ho's

[Verse]
Old money, new hundreds, nigga pray for me
Young shooter, twin pistols, nigga pray for 'em
All my life I been this way, nigga stop mocking me
For them beats come shop with me man, I can't do no lease (hell nah)
Like real shit, nigga hatin' on me, nigga on my dick
Know I'm out here gettin' rich, I'm with my clique
Your bitch choosin' me, she want this shit
When I woke up, and I had to get my swag
Gained off the flips and I spend a couple racks
And I'm on this lean so, I can't feel my face
And I got this bad bitch, she gon' give me face

[Hook]
Tell these niggas chill man (tell these niggas chill)
They gon' want beef, I always keep the steel
Hatin' on my music (uh) or my sex appeal
You know I got them ho's, can't take no ho for real (can't take no ho for real)
Money make the world go (money make the world go)
Money make them panties go (money make them panties go)
I'm off them Xannies tho (Xannies ho)
Carti, I got many ho's (damn)

[Outro]
(Old money, new hundreds, nigga pray for me)
Splur, Splur, Ayy, Damn
