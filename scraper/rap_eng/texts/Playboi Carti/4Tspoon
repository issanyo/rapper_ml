[Intro: Yung Bans]
25-8, 6, 7, 8, (Bans)
I just asked my good lord for another day (thank God)
Got my niggas in the bay, shooters in L.A
Keep some hitters in Atlanta, boolin every-
Stop that, bring it back
This shit is hot, this is a certified hood classic
(Four tablespoons, four tablespoons)
Damn son, where'd you find this?
(Four tablespoons, four tablespoons)
