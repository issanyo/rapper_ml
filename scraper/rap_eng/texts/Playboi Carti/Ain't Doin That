[Intro: Young Sizzle]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
2 AM shit, you know what I'm sayin'
Yeah

[Verse 1: Young Sizzle]
Hated on the Rollie and I still ain't got time
Geekin' on the lean while them hoes snorting lines
Nah I'm still the same nigga, no wait by the line
Walking in, strap on me, I don't do a pat down
Even when I'm getting sucked off, know a strap round
Know a nigga faking, we ain't never seen his background
Spend a little quarter mil just to ride your bitch 'round
Nigga seeing chandeliers when I wave my wrist 'round
Please quit the talking ho, you might make me miss count
Say that ho faithful, I'ma show you what your bitch 'bout
Sprayin' like a wildfire, niggas can't put it out
Steady burning money, niggas mad that I ain't running out
Youngin super with it, talk about us and they gun him down
I just bought a ring and that fucker worth a hundred pounds
Swear I'm on the right path, I'll never turn around
I just bought a chain and that fucker worth a hundred pounds
Key! done taught me never trust a nigga or a bitch, hey
They ain't talking money, man that shit ain't making sense
Three choppers on me, nigga swerve with the tint
'Bout to take the whole house out and hop the fence
Rollie really dripping like this fucker had a rinse
Suck a nigga dick and I might pay a bitch rent
Praying to the lord for my sins, I repent
Screaming fuck 'em all and they know that's what I meant

[Chorus: Young Sizzle & Playboi Carti]
Falling off nigga, never never, we ain't doin' that
Hundred mil strong, fuck a ho, I'm pursuing that
Molly with the perc get you right, ho I'm chewing that
You can have that powder shit, baby I ain't doing that
Spending guap on a thot thot, I ain't doing that
Sipping on the Wock in the drop, yeah I'm doing that
Pull up on an opp in the block, yeah I'm doing that
Shooting at that nigga, don't stop, I ain't doing that
I don't give a fuck 'bout a bitch, I ain't doing that
Fucking on your bitch, she your bitch, yeah I'm doing that
I'm counting them rolls, young nigga been doing that
Pouring them fours, young nigga been doing that

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Your ho stay calling, don't know why she doing that
Callin' my phone, I hate when she doing that
Been on my VLONE, my nigga been doing that
I fuck your bitch, yeah I been doing it
I'm on my shit, yeah I been doing it
Hop on a beat, yeah I influenced
All of my nigg, yeah they get to it
All of my bitches, they are into it
All of my nigg, they gettin' to it
All of my bitches, they are into it, ooh, yeah
I got your bitch, and that bitch movin'
I got your bitch, and that bitch movin'
I got your bitch, let's get into it
Follow me bitch, let's make a movie
Pockets so thick, all in my Ksubi
Pockets so thick, they wanna sue me
Ooh, uh, let's get into it
Ooh, what, what, yeah, what, uh, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Young Sizzle & Playboi Carti]
Falling off nigga, never never, we ain't doin' that
Hundred mil strong, fuck a ho, I'm pursuing that
Molly with the perc get you right, ho I'm chewing that
You can have that powder shit, baby I ain't doing that
Spending guap on a thot thot, I ain't doing that
Sipping on the Wock in the drop, yeah I'm doing that
Pull up on an opp in the block, yeah I'm doing that
Shooting at that nigga, don't stop, I ain't doing that
I don't give a fuck 'bout a bitch, I ain't doing that
Fucking on your bitch, she your bitch, yeah I'm doing that
I'm counting them rolls, young nigga been doing that
Pouring them fours, young nigga been doing that
