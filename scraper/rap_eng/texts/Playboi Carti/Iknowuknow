[Verse 1: Ethereal]
All my niggas in this bitch, all my niggas in this bitch
Who is E? He run the shit
Who got funk? I can't smell it
On the porch my 9 on spit
Got a torch I'll fye' that bit'
Been too trill I can't een' chill
Play E real loud and swang' yo' shit
I smoke a spliff and take a shit
You flaw niggas is lookin' limp
These scene niggas is not wit' it
They just wanna be seen and shit
Damn, hit the bump, now I'm on it better watch yo' bitch
Put me in the trunk, understand that I'ma pop yo' shit
I hit the spliff, wait I just smoked mane
Young nigga been had the smoke mane
You niggas can come get smoked mane
Bring yo' crew and come get choked mane
Yo' girl came thru' and got yoked mane

Damn, I'm so cold boy, how the fuck I get so froze mane
Ran in the yo', hit the dro' and dropped a crazy flow mane

And now they at my throat mane
So I'll stay on my toes mane
And keep firin' this propane

Money on the floor, this ain't from no shows
I just fucked that hoe until she had to go
I got a bag a dro, Hi-Tech down her throat
My shit hella dope, my shit hella dope
I bought a flight to Paris just to see a hoe
Got plenty dough spend many dough, that Fendi store I'm in it thou' (I'm winnin' thou)
My crib so fat I'm like "Shit let's shoot a video"
Let's put up all these hoes up in my video
Young nigga ballin' swish been a pro
This nigga watchin' me, he ain't gettin' doe'
I mix the Preme with the Polo
All my niggas rockin' dolo
I got the 9 Tec hold it doe' (pew pew)
Have a nigga breathin' slow
Chillin' wit' my nigga Savage
Countin' money, young niggas livin' lavish
