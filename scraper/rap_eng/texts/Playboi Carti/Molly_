Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Look at these diamonds, they shinin'
Look at these bitches, they lyin'
Baby, these diamonds ain't Johnny
I just called up Avianne
I don't got no stylist
All my planes are privates
Percies on the privates
We don't fuck with molly

[Post-Chorus]
We had to lay back on them pills
I just fucked the pint up
I fuckin' said I'm eating seals
Get slimed lil' bitch, I know you not real
I'm spendin' my money on guns and pills
In Atlanta with a bitch and the bitch so bad
I'm on the the lean, lil' bitch
Kick the bitch out, I don't need the bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm from the Flat, lil nigga (Ooh)
I started trappin' (Ooh)
Then started rappin', nigga (Ooh)
These all black diamonds, nigga (Ooh)
I hang out with robbers, nigga (Ooh)
Whatchu know about robbin' niggas? (Ooh)
Whatchu know about TECs? (Ooh)
Whatchu know about mobbing, nigga? (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Look at these diamonds, they shinin'
Look at these bitches, they lyin'
Baby, these diamonds ain't Johnny
I just called up Avianne
I don't got no stylist
All my planes are privates
Percies on the privates
We don't fuck with molly

[Post-Chorus]
We had to lay back on them pills
I just fucked the pint up
I fuckin' said I'm eating seals
Get slimed lil' bitch, I know you not real
I'm spendin' my money on guns and pills
In Atlanta with a bitch and the bitch so bad
I'm on the the lean, lil' bitch
Kick the bitch out, I don't need the bitch
