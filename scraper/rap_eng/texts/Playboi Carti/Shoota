[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah
Now, now is my time
Now is my time
Tha-tha-tha-tha-that be Maaly Raw

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score, like I made the touch-down
Swervin' in that Lambo doors go up, not on the bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walking with a bust down
Pull up and I'm flooded with an iced out watch
Whip it look like butter, baby, pecan drop
Pecan drop, put that four in some drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot
Suicide, 1600, that's the block
Hit your girl that's check free
She ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me
She keep tryna neck me
I got' tell my bestie, someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie, link up make a check bleed
You know that I'm smoking dope, I'll be high til' next week
Know I had to let her go, 'cause she can't arrest me

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Woke up with my toolie, what it do? (Uh)
Meet me in the alley with the troops (Uh)
I got red shooters, I got blue (Yeah)
Let that thing down then point at you (Uh)
Bentley or that Rari, hoe, let's choose (Ooh)
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot (Uh, uh)
We gon' take these boys back to school
Money on the floor just like some shoes (Uh)

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Money on the floor just like some shoes (Yeah)
I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop (Yeah)
I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop
Yeah, and I love my goons
Yeah, and I love my tool (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, and I love my loot (What)
Yeah, fuck with me and you gon' lose (What)
Don't talk to me just talk to my lil' dude (Doot)
Don't talk to me just talk to my lil' dude

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Woke up with my toolie, what it do? (Uh)
Meet me in the alley with the troops (Uh)
I got red shooters, I got blue (Yeah)
Let that thing down then point at you (Uh)
Bentley or a Rari, hoe, let's choose (Ooh)
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot (Uh, uh)
We gon' take these boys back to school
Money on the floor just like some shoes
