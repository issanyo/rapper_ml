[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I fell in love, I fell in love
But that's okay, 'cause we in love
Oh my God, I fell in love
I fell in love, with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in, for the love
Just show me love, just show me love
I fell in love, I fell in love
And that's okay, 'cause I'm in love

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
We in that bed, give me head
I want that, just a stick
Close your eyes, don't shed no tears
Keep it dark, close the shades
I'm off the pills, you on that lean
You fuck me slow, girl do your thing
Let's take some pics, let's take some scenes
Playboy magazine
She got her panties down, with no tee
She got her titties out, she want a tee
She tatted up now, I see you see
I know you see, I know you see I see
You know I want that bih, I wanna eat her
I wanna lick it up, I wanna fuck and eat (aye)
I want to freeze you up, I want them diamonds blingin'
I want it all on you, I want you all on me
Ooh

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I fell in love, fell in love
But that's okay, 'cause we in love
Oh my God, fell in love
Fell in love, with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in, for the love
Just show me love, just show me love

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Lil' ma fly, she gotta fly now
Got a squad now, got a drop now
She club hoppin', jewelry shoppin'
Girl you shinin', girl you finin'
Yeah, you fine as wine, frozen like diamonds (dime piece)
I treat you like my last dime
Go broke, no joke
I cut these hoes off, I kill the roll call
I put the doors up, she like to show off
Them bitches sleepy, them bitches dozed off
I put a ring on it, it ain't got a ring to it
On my knees for you, watch me do how he ain't do it
I cannot speak for you, but I know that he ain't fluent
I speak your language, he don't tell you things do he?
Like "Girl, you dangerous"
Girl I ain't seen beauty, not 'til I seen you
Don't you cheat like Queen do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me sing to you, let this be the theme music

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I fell in love, I fell in love
But that's okay, 'cause we in love
Oh my God, I fell in love
I fell in love, with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in, for the love
Just show me love, just show me love
I fell in love, I fell in love
And that's okay, 'cause I'm in love
