Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?

[Verse 1: Pi'erre Bourne]
Better watch that nigga, he gon' criss-cross
Yeah, yeah, he gon' switch style
Ayy, yeah, I tried to warn you, I tried to tell you
Yeah, I can't take no more L's, I can't take no more L's, ayy
Man my life been hell, ayy, but lately I been doin' fuckin' well
Yeah, I can't take no more L's, I can't take no more L's, ayy
Man my life been hell, ayy, but lately I been doin' fuckin' well
Hey, hands all to my fuckin' self
She say congratulations, she say congratulations
Yeah, I'm goin' up baby, till I'm blowin' up baby
Ayy, she say congratulations, she say congratulations
Cause now I'm gettin' paper, now I'm gettin' paper
'Til I'm blowin' up baby

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Old money, new flow (Flow, what?)
Bad bitch, love the pole (What?)
Sip the four, Actavis (Woah)
Sip it slow, kickin' shit (Lean, woah)
Oh Pi'erre, come in here
Got some hoes, they upstairs (They upstairs)
I need two hoes, need two pair (What? What?)
My chain too cold, chandelier
Pretty boy, huh, manicure
You need a code, just to come in here
