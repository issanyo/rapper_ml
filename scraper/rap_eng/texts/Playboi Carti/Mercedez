[Intro]
Cash Carti

[Verse]
I came off the porch with a duffle bag
Trap house, bathroom filled with cash
And my loud blunts pressure pack, flippin' gas
Easter pink, sippin' slow my life too fast (my life too fast)
My life a gamble, just like rolling dice
And this life so fast, you can die tonight
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt I pulled in a foreign
My old hoe so boring
Got another foreign
Pints and OZs
Ain't scared of no police
I say these niggas don't know me
These niggas they owe me
I ball like Ginobili
I won't cop no Rollie
Loadin' my forty
We takin' his forty
