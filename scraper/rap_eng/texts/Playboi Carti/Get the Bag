Uh, yeah, yeah (it's a new day)
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah (it's a new day)
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh (it's a new day)
Uh, uh, uh (it's a new day)

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant & A$AP TyT]
Gucci, that Prada, that Fendi
Ice Cube, all about the Benjis
Spend ten bands in Fendi
A$AP, my niggas with me
Niggas be talking that bullshit
Your main bitch said I look gorgeous
What I spent on my chain, that's your mortgage (cash out)
Brand new Porsche came with some horses (it's a new day)
Sipping that purple like Prince
.40 my tool, that's my wrench
Ballin' like J-Kidd, assist
Shootin that three like a swish

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy & A$AP TyT]
Aye, moving in silence, I need me some guidance
I'm wildin', there's money and violence
Come out the projects, I want it, I got it
Margiela just running through college (it's a new day)
Fresh out the Porsche, tech in my shorts
Best from the west to the north
Catching some rec with my thots, aye
Getting a check for my thoughts, aye
Dripping in jelly, I trap off a celly
I look like I'm rich in the 80's
Droop with the grippy, I cruise through the bity (uhhhh!)
I'm buggin out crazy, no brazy

[Verse 3: Smooky MarGielaa & A$AP TyT]
Ski mask on me so them niggas can't trace me
Car is so fast, when I skrt, they can't chase me
Margiela, Marino, now she wanna date me
She see the money, now she tryna play me
Hop out the Rari, go vroom
I never lack, I stay with goons, thugs
And you know Gucci my shoes
Breaking the rules, stay on the news
And you know my shot go swish
Shoot from a three point, boy I won’t miss, aye
Smooky just caught a new lick
Diamonds don't drip, don’t front, you get hit (it's a new day)

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky & A$AP TyT]
Funny vibes, I can sense
Something different in the air, it's like a weight being lifted
Taste the hatred, oh I get it
Really trippin' cause you broke and you in your feelings
Let her go, she in her feelings
Niggas can't tell you shit, man, don't know the difference
When you're in your twenties making parents livid
Cause you making millions
Make 'em wanna live it then you make a living
Over what you spending, making poor decisions
Music for the children, hope they make it major
Even independent, free them out the penni' (it's a new day)
Keep him out the prison, writing freedom with the pen and pencil
MTV about a Interstitial
Fuck with me because it's beneficial (it's a new day)
Unsuspected like an incidental

[Verse 5: A$AP TyY]
Chasing that bag (it's a new day)

Looking like a nigga dad (it's a new day)
Foreign bitches, pull up
Type of bitch a nigga wish he had (it's a new day)
Looking in the mirror, vision getting clearer (uhhhhh)
I see why you mad
Chickens coming in, they gotta go
She ain't fucking then she gotta go (new day)
Wanna see me drown, I gotta float
Best believe I get it by the boat (new day)
Thirsty bitch, she wanna sit up in it

Car so big she wanna get up in it
Tell the bitch to chill but she still catching feelings (it's a new day)

Bunch of indie niggas with me repping Philly (it's a new day)
