[Intro]
Dolla bill
Yeah
Music, from the soul y'all
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I tell my niggas we gotta chase the bills
Thousands, a couple mills
Vanilla skies, nice crib
Dependin' on the weather how I choose my 'mobile
Cruise through the strip just to cop a zip
Bad chick tatted underneath her lip
Get a lift, guarantee I'm gonna hit
She love the shit I wear, sponsored by the time of year
Always prepared, dutch master
In her ear, get plastered
My crew members get hazard
Skateboardin' fashion Nascar drivin
Your hoe love my adlibs
Dolla bill
(Dope)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Hook]
Bitch I gotta get the cash (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
All my niggas skate, all you niggas hate
This Fendi on my waist
Your chick gave me that "I can't feel my face"
I can't feel my face
I got a foreign car, foreign broad
Good head, pornstar
Cash first, fuck y'all
Creamtoppers I gotta ball
Outfit come from Montreal, make a scene when I'm in the mall
Freeze, hold up
Your girl, she gon' run up

[Hook]
Bitch I gotta get the cash (yeah yeah)
