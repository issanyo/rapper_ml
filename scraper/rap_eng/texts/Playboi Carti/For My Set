[Verse]
My cup filled like over blow
I might overdose on these bars
I might pass out in my loft
Wake up next to your broad
I sell her coke then she carry off
For a bitch, nigga i ain't partial
I'm marc jacobs two hoes
No makeup, get ya cake up
Banana boat filled with kilos
That's a lot of dope
I'm on cruise mode with my shades on
My top off what you hiding for?
I Got goons on the roof where the yoppers doe
Sending shots til the cops show
Bodies fall then I reload (bitch)

[Pre-Hook]
Matter fact I need 10 more
Fuck a record deal I can make a mil straight juggin'

[Hook]
Fuck the rest nigga this is on my set
I'ma keep chasin' this money
So my team can have whats best
Diamonds on my neck
Four digits be the check
Two hoes in my bed
I got Two loads in the shed
I got designers in my hand
I got this kush smoke in my chest
Vanilla skies my quest
The green long that red band
No swimming pool but she wet
That bad bitch get long dick
She been waitin' on it for the longest

[Outro]
Cash over the bullshit
Cash over the bullshit
Cash over the bullshit
