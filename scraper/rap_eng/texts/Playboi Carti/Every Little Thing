[Intro]
That's my cutthroat bitch, aye little cutthroat, that's my cutthroat bitch

[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Every little thing that we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Should be between me and you
When you see me out here flexing in my coupe
Nigga I'm flexin' up on you
Probably be flexin' with my crew
Like we ain't got shit to do baby

[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
She gon fuck the whole gang if i ask her to
She ain't worried about it girl, this between me and you
Had to buy an Audi because a nigga crashed the coupe
So tell me if you bout it because a nigga sliding thru
Always coolin' never bollin you know how I move
All this gold on my body gotta keep a tool
Ride his dick like a Ducati in the pussy oh
And she never say a word, that's why I fuck with you

[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Every little thing that we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Should be between me and you
When you see me out here flexing in my coupe
Nigga I'm flexin' up on you
Probably be flexin' with my crew
Like we ain't got shit to do baby

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Imma keep it true, I ain't gassin' another bih
Hoe top me off in my whip, hoe sick
3 chains on, still ain't buy that hoe shit
I'm a real nigga, you a little bitch
I be on my guap, smoking on that jit
She gone have a fit when she see my new bih
Please gon have a fit when he see my new whip
That hoe ain't tryna leave when she see the new crib
That hoe ain't tryna leave when she see who's in the stash
Money bags shawty might just give you a whole bag
