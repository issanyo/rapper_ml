[Intro]
Blowin' on it by myself! I'm by myself, I'm by myself
Man you talking like you know

[Hook]
By my fuckin' self (By my fuckin’ self)
I don't need no help (Bitch I don’t need no help)
I did this shit by myself
Woke up in the morning said I don't need no help
I fucked that bitch by myself
Blowin’ on it by myself, I’m by myself, I’m by myself
Man you talking like you know

[Verse]
I need them racks before the show
Money get a nigga where he going
After this I'm in yo' bitch, then the studio
Double cup Actavis still sippin' dope
Bad bitch super thick and she mix dope
This yo' main bitch but she always at my door
This your main bitch but she stay smokin’ my dope
You can see the steeze from across the street
7 days a week I want nothin' but cheese
200 for these jeans I just ripped these jeans
Where the triple beam? You ain't seen me
On my team, What’s Love?

[Outro]
By my fuckin' self (By my fuckin’ self)
I don't need no help (Bitch I don’t need no help)
I did this shit by myself
Woke up in the morning said I don't need no help
I fucked that bitch by myself
Blowin' on it by myself, I'm by myself, I’m by myself
