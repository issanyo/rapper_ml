[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I cannot fuck with these people
I just be flexing these people
I Maison Margiela on people (oh)
I cannot fuck with these people
I cannot fuck with these people
But I'ma do this for this people
Serving them packs for the people
Collecting them racks from the people
Collecting them bags from the people
Shooting shit like the Regal
Shooting shit like the Regal (What?)
Ferragamo and the pea coat
Robin jeans with the wings though
Southside got a beach home
Still counting on my Vlone (Oh)
I cannot fuck with these people
I just be flexing these people
I Maison Margiela on people
I cannot fuck with these people
I'ma do this for this people
Serving them packs for the people
Maison Margiela for people
Collecting them bags from the people
Raf Simons for the people
Perry Ellis for the people
We just posted by the Regal
Shooting shit like the Regal
Shooting shit like the Regal
Ferragamo and the pea coat
Robin Jeans with the wings though
Southsider, southside with the pea coat
Southside with a beach home
Counting up on my Vlone
Counting up on my Vlone
Always coming when she all alone
Fuck the bitch on my Vlone
Put the bitch down with Vlone
Oh, yuh (What?)

[Verse 2: Ethereal]
I do this shit for the people
You know I pulled up in a Regal
I'm like what's up like who need it?
Young nigga high talk to eagles
UGK on my Pimp C
Bitches looking like who could it be
Sub Zero cool and smokin' green
Pull a young nigga from the scene
Young hoe tryna see me
Young Dro nigga freeze me
Call me T.I. back in '03
Troubled man, came a OG
Drinking dirty but my flow clean
New house but the flo' clean
Flow clean til the hoe sleep
Go to sleep now its more clean
Money stuffed in some Robin jeans
Catch me in Miami running things
Pull up in Hondas its so fucking clean
Told Carti we gon' run this thing
Block party smoking Billie Jean
So booted up I might cause a scene
Southside in my blood
Flatbed from the mud
Pulled up in a truck
Interracial in my cup
Said E feel like a stud
Took her home she in love
Southside in Japan
Percocet I'm the man
I do this shit for my people
I put the dope in your speakers

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
