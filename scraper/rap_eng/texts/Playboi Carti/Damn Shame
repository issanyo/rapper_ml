[Intro: Playboi Carti]
I'm in this hoe with Cinco countin' C notes
I'm in this hoe with Cinco countin' C notes
I'm in this hoe with Cinco countin' C notes
This feelin' like a story that been wrote before
Pourin' up fours countin' C notes
I'm in this hoe with Cinco countin' C notes
I'm feelin' like this been wrote before

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Forgiatos on my coupe spin
Everything steel, everything steel
Yeah
And I'm down for real
Got some bitches 'round me, baby girl they down for real
Got some niggas 'round me, baby girl they down to kill
All these bitches 'round me tryna fuck, thats fuckin' real
Oh, oh and I keep it real
2900 flat niggas keep it real
Rockin' Robin, Trues for real Robin, Trues for real
All my niggas out here steal, all my niggas peel
Bitches callin' up my phone sayin' I'ma fake nigga
I just got some cake nigga, with cake mix
In L.A. on vacay nigga
Balenciaga, I don't fake nigga
Goyard on my waist, no cake mix
Shoot him in his face nigga

[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
All these niggas change when the money came
Promised I wouldn't change when the money came
All these bitches wanna hang when the money came
A fuck nigga came around when the money came
In that brand new Maserati steady switchin' lanes
And that Tech comin' 200 that all on my chain
Came a long way from the trap, the money ain't the same

[Verse 2: Johnny Cinco]
Oh, oh, oh
I ain't ever change
Hunnid thousand on a niggas chain
With the same bad bitches said that she ain't changed
Real nigga I'm with Carti, and my La Famil'
And that Benz on me 200, I ain't hard to feel
They front row at every show nigga you don't know how that feel
Drive a foreign, drop a four, nigga you gon' see how it sip
Real trap nigga, pocket full of dubs
Young real nigga made myself a plug
Flexin' on 'em bitch and flexin' on 'em nigga
Hundreds on these bitches, hundreds on these niggas
Fuckin' up a set, fuckin' up a set
Right back to the trap, right back to the trap
Foreign with the hunda's might make me relax
Fuck around with 'em hundreds, bad bitch in the back
Froze, froze, all these diamonds froze
Yeah they all froze, I might go rogue
I did it for my hoe, all my hoes froze
Fuck her friend slow
All my hoes wit' it, all my hoes fitted
Lenses gold tinted (Carti)
Thats that I can't hang, thats that I got change
Went and bought another chain

[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
All these niggas change when the money came
Promised I wouldn't change when the money came
All these bitches wanna hang when the money came
A fuck nigga came around when the money came
In that brand new Maserati steady switchin' lanes
And that Tech comin' 200 that all on my chain
Came a long way from the trap, the money ain't the same
