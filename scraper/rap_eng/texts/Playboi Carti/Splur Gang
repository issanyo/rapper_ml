[Intro: Playboi Carti]
Unh, money bags
Bags, nigga cash, splur
Money bags nigga, ey

[Bridge: ThouxanbandFauni]
Bling bling bling my language not no chit-chat
I pull up to the Fendi shorty splur on this and that
The taste you tastin' in her mouth that's just my aftermath
You say you counted seven stacks but I done spended that
Don't hit my line with all that hot shit just say that I need that
I see these niggas plottin', they don't even know I'm strapped

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
Unh, splur, splur, splur, splur, splur
Cash, cash, splur

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Young nigga juggin' on the flat
Young nigga juggin' had to get it back
I'm a young nigga, I be on that fuck shit
I be with my young niggas, they on they go-dumb shit
And a young nigga tryna make a shade
Young nigga, every day I'm gettin' baked
Young nigga juggin' in LA
Young nigga cool in ghetto shades

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
Unh, splur, splur, splur, splur, splur
Cash, cash, splur

[Bridge: ThouxanbandFauni]
Bling bling bling my language not no chit-chat
I pull up to the Fendi shorty splur on this and that
The taste you tastin' in her mouth that's just my aftermath
You say you counted seven stacks but I done spended that
Don't hit my line with all that hot shit just say that I need that
I see these niggas plottin', they don't even know I'm strapped

[Hook: Playboi Carti]
Unh, splur, splur, splur, splur, splur
Cash, cash, splur

[Verse 2: ThouxanbandFauni]
Don't hit my line with that hot shit just say that you need that
I see these niggas plottin', they don't even know I'm strapped
She say, Fauni you ain't shit except for this and that
I put my dick out on that bitch, she started kissin' that
And if you ain't talkin' bout bread boy, I'll be gettin' that
Drugs or hoes, either way you know I'm hittin' that
I don't wear floral boy I just smoke it straight out the back
LA can see my whole existence, y'all be dissin' that
I'm puttin' niggas on, I swear to god I'm givin' back
And if you push me to the limit, you'll regret that
Compared to mine, some diamonds in your mouth look like some plaque
Final Fantasy, I'm savin' clouds like I am zack
Can't be no trendy nigga because that shit so wack
Chattanooga Tennessee where I spent my summers at
Lived in the city, lived in the suburbs
Burnin' purp, burnin' bands, burnin' rubber
Gettin' more green gettin' flubber
Gettin' more green gettin' flubber
All these unfamiliars round me always lookin' at
Is it cause the chick I'm with you probably thought you had?
Lookin' fabolous when I jug you just throw it in the bag

[Bridge: Playboi Carti]
Ey yeah baby, go 'head and throw that in the bag that ain't shit
Niggas over here gettin' money, nigga, money bags, nigga
Money bags, ya, ey, unh

[Verse 3: Playboi Carti]
Ey, designer this, designer that
Ey, exotic bitch, exotic pack
I can't bitch on the scene, boy, I'm in the trap
She can't wear no leggings around me, boy, I don't like that
Took his bitch with my wrist, he ain't like that
Loud pack, rollin' on my iPad
These Versace shades, I can't see that
All white bricks, all white bricks, my Chanel bag
I'm just life for life
I still took that flight
Fucked her the first night
Syrup sit on ice
Cash my appetite
These niggas ain't right
These niggas ain't right
I'm loaded on sight
Damn

[Outro: Playboi Carti]
Ey, Cash Carti man, UnoTheActivist man
Fauni nigga
Shouts to my nigga King Savage on [?]
This shit nae nae
You don't know nothin' bout this shit boy
We out
