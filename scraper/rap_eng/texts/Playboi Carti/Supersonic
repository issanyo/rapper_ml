[Chorus]
Cap bad bitch, I run it (Bad bitch)
Supersonic, yah
Bad bitch, I run it
Fuck it all the time
Fast, supersonic
Get it, got it
Get it, got it
Fast, supersonic
Bite it, bite it
Eat it, fight it
My lean, I'm geeking
Sleep, I'm sleeping
Lean, just leaning
She creep, she teasin'

[Verse]
Baby, my linen, my Benny, my Gucci
I got, designer, touch it, you lose it
He ain't got guap, don't do it
If he got guap, let's do him
I'm on the block, let's do 'em
I'm on the block, let's do 'em
I got the Glock .9, by the .45
Yeen' gon' do 'em
You cannot cap with a goon
You don't wanna come in this room
Shawty ain't ready for a FlatBed nigga
Shawty ain't ready to fiend (Slatt, what)

[Chorus]
Cap bad bitch, I run it (Bad bitch)
Supersonic, yah
Bad bitch, I run it
Fuck it all the time
Fast, supersonic
Get it, got it
Get it, got it
Fast, supersonic
Bite it, bite it
Eat it, fight it
My lean, I'm geeking
Sleep, I'm sleeping
Lean, just leaning
She creep, she teasin'
