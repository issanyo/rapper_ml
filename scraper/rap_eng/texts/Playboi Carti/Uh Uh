[Intro: Chief Keef]
Sosa baby
Bang
Bang-bang, bang
Bang
Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Poppin' a pill, still
Shawty on the block with me, wearin' Chanel
Too much dope in here, I can't smell-smell
Too many guns in here, I can tell a tale
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Verse: Chief Keef]
Heat in my hand, no oven mitt
Take yo' block and tumble it
Bitch, give me that cookie, I'm crumblin'
Uh-uh, you lovin' that ho
The way that go, I never ever know
Rollin' up Ps, cappin' that O, get sparked from the heat that was definite, though
You can try to run, but you catchin' them, though
Wanna fuck in these mouth like I'm M&Ms, though
It's a hit-and-run, hit the ambulance, ho
Ice in my cup, December twenty-fo'
Smoke get me higher than the airfield, though
Mama told me "Never ever fear," though
.45 bigger than a elephant, though
Go to court, smellin' like I sell elbows
Ha-ha, you was poppin' that shit
Now the window down, start poppin' them sticks
Ha-ha, you was not with that shit
You don't even know what come with that shit
Better run, run, run up the blue bummers
Bitch with me, all in my arms, yeah
After that I sent her home and I don't care (don't care, yeah)
We want all the smoke, we got mob fare

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Poppin' a pill, still
Shawty on the block with me, wearin' Chanel
Too much dope in here, I can't smell-smell
Too many guns in here, I can't tell a tale
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
