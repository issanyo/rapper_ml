[Verse]
I can't trust these niggas
Snakes in the grass, ducks in the river
I can't smoke no swisher bitch I'm on that Garcia
Told my spanish bitch gracias gracias
Drunk as fuck in the cut
She tryna fuck I just lit the blunt
Watch me stunt, I'm on some other shit
Young Carti, (echo) in the 'Rari
Pulled up on your shawty at the party
I was of the xans
I got too much racks in my fucking hands
Bitch I'm on my shit
True Religion jeans compliment my fit
Had to get a cut, now I'm fresh as shit
She didn't make the cut, she can't fuck with me
Bitch it's Young Carti
Yeah, bitch it's Young Carti
All my shit awful, boy
Shoutout Awful
All these niggas awful they can't fuck with Awful
And you know I'm on my shit
Got Dexter on this track, I'm in the function in this bitch
And I got a lotta niggas that will shoot for me in this bitch
And you ain't no real nigga boy I seen it

[Outro]
What nigga I just killed that shit
Boy this fucked up
Aye play that shit
You ain't think I got swag
How I bust this shit
Nigga fuck wrong with these niggas man
I'm in this motherfucker nigga
Young Carti nigga
I'm out here
