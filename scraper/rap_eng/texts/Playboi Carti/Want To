[Intro: Juice WRLD]
Uh, yeah, huh

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
What’s that belt? Hermes (Uh huh)
What’s that? New Patek (Uh huh)
What’s that? New lil'  bitch (Uh huh)
Get her super wet (Uh huh)
Threw that bitch a bone, bone (Uh huh)
I told that bitch "Fetch" (Uh huh)
Did it on my own, own (Uh huh)
That’s why they’re upset (Uh huh)
Uh, chopper on my hip, these niggas still toting a Tec (Uh huh)
That’s gon’ jam up on you, you gon’ get shot in your neck (Uh huh)
My gun transform to a robot, call that bitch a mech (Uh huh)
I ain’t drinkin’ tonight, baby, I’m on Percocet (Uh huh)
Want to, beat her boyfriend ass like one, two (Ya dig)
Her coochie taste good, soul food (Ya dig)
Don’t talk to me, I don’t know you (Ya dig)
You can follow me if you want to
You can swallow me if you want to
Tips hollow and if you wanna die
Got it on me like fuck you (Grra, grra, grra)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Backwoods, dank rolled, big gas, bankroll
Chains ‘round my neck, feel like Django
But I’m not a slave, ho, you should be my slave, ho
Rollie Ronald Reag’, ho, Presidential gang, oh
Backwoods, dank rolled, big gas, bankroll
Chains ‘round my neck, no Django
‘Cause I’m not a slave, ho, but you should be my slave, ho
Rollie Ronald Reag’, ho, Presidential gang, oh
