Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Young Nudy]
I am a real drank sipper
A real drank sipper
A real drank sipper, yeah yeah
I am a real molly popper
A real molly popper
A real molly popper, yeah yeah
As if he's rolling like a hippie
Smoking like a hipster

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
16, 29, 16
Fuck that lil bih in the room
Fuck that lil bih in the room
All of my niggas they goon
Diamonds they shine like the moon
How can I sound like ya'll
How can be like ya'll
When [?]
I just bought a bottle
