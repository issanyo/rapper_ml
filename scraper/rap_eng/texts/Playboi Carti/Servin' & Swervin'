[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Ha, ha, ha, ha
It's Pablo Juan, Hoodrich, nigga
You know we outta here
Outer space, outta town, outta...
Swerving and serving, swerving and serving
Swerving and serving, I'm serving, I'm serving
Pablo Juan, nigga
You know what's going on, Hoodrich, nigga
Swerve up on these niggas, let's go

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Playboi Carti]
I'm serving and swerving, serving and swerving
Serving and swerving, serving and swerving
I'm swerving, I'm swerving
I'm serving, I'm serving
I'm serving and swerving
Nigga, I'm serving and swerving
I'm on that syrup, I'm swerving (shut up)
I'm on them Xans, I'm serving (shut up)
I'm on the lean and the Perc
Serve you a bag of them birds
Chopper with a hundred, Glock with a thirty
Murder a nigga, then I pull off swerving
Tricked him on purpose, I'm serving (bitch)
He acting too nervous, ain't serving
Swerving and serving, I'm swerving and serving
I'm swerving and serving and serving

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I'm swerving and serving, got bags in the burlap
I'm the plug, not a worker, I'll merk you Omerta
Master Splinter, I got flavors like Ninja Turtles
Rollie a thirty, that Glock hold a thirty
Sell you a bird for the thirty
Good shot like I'm Stephen Curry
Selling chickens to Jamaicans like curry
Nigga, I keep it on me when I'm serving
Swerving stash spot in the Suburban
I'm on them Percs with the lean and the gurney
You pussy niggas see me, getting nervous
Real nigga, so I keep serving
Put a four in a 20, I drink dirty
Real nigga like Pimp C, C-Murder
I'll pull up on you, curbside service
Swerving and serving, swerving and serving

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Playboi Carti]
I'm serving and swerving, serving and swerving
Serving and swerving, serving and swerving
I'm swerving, I'm swerving
I'm serving, I'm serving
I'm serving and swerving
Nigga, I'm serving and swerving
I'm on that syrup, I'm swerving
I'm on them Xans, I'm serving
I'm on the lean and the Perc
Serve you a bag of them birds
Chopper with a hundred, Glock with a thirty
Murder a nigga, then I pull off swerving
Tricked him on purpose, I'm serving (bitch)
He acting too nervous, ain't serving
Swerving and serving, I'm swerving and serving
I'm swerving and serving and serving

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
I'm swerving, I'm swerving
I'm riding Suburban
Your bitch, yeah, she call us and she tell us she's worried
Told her get off and come work it
Up in Atlanta, we chopping with hammers
My niggas, they coming and we blam them
I been sip Fanta, they coming with hammers
My niggas, they coming to handle it
$3500 for that little coat
I told her that bitch I'm having
I used to ride these little niggas for ropes
Until I took that shit to Cali
Counting these rolls, I'm having these rolls
I swear these little niggas move back
All up in traffic
Pablo went trapping and Carti in traffic in Aston

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Playboi Carti]
I'm serving and swerving, serving and swerving
Serving and swerving, serving and swerving
I'm swerving, I'm swerving
I'm serving, I'm serving
I'm serving and swerving
Nigga, I'm serving and swerving
I'm on that syrup, I'm swerving (shut up)
I'm on them Xans, I'm serving (shut up)
I'm on the lean and the Perc
Serve you a bag of them birds
Chopper with a hundred, Glock with a thirty
Murder a nigga, then I pull off swerving
Tricked him on purpose, I'm serving (bitch)
He acting too nervous, ain't serving
Swerving and serving, I'm swerving and serving
I'm swerving and serving and serving
