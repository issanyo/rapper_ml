In Malibu, that's casual
Got the MAC-A-DO
Feed you with gratitude

It's a real nigga, annual
Your hoe on automatic, put her on manual
She can't handle me, handle me and Betty Boop (Top)
You're lookin' for me, I'm on Saks Fifth Avenue (Yeah)
I just went and bought me some flashbangs (Huh?)
You can disappear, disrespectin' that gang
Hahaha

And she just pull up to the spot (Spot, spot)
