I'm blowing the check up like ohh
I'm fucking this bitch she like ohh
She blowing my phone like ohh
I'm curving that bitch I'm like ohh
I'm serving these niggas like ohh
It's Maison Margiela like ohh
I flex on these niggas like ohh
My niggas on gun, they gon' shoot
My niggas won't tell like ohh
Walk into the bank I'm like ohh
Sippin' that drank I'm like ohh
Maison Margiela like ohh
I'm getting top on my coop
A nigga so set like ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: JuiceDaSavage]
When we step up in the party, bitches be like ohh
Niggas looking at us, they know we the fucking crew
We the gang, blood gang, you know how we move
I'm a shoot up out myself with that fucking tool
Hanging on the block, jugging rocks, it's what I used to do
Fiends hit the dope, they like ohh
I've been trappin' and finessin' since I stepped in the booth
I'm a young savage nigga I stay strapped when I move, ohh
Shoot a nigga if he move, ohh

[Hook]
I'm blowing the check up like ohh
I'm fucking this bitch she be like ohh
She blowing my phone like ohh
I'm curving that bitch I'm like ohh
I'm serving these niggas like ohh
It's Maison Margiela like ohh
I flex on these niggas like ohh

My niggas on gun, they gon' shoot
My niggas won't tell like ohh
Walk into the bank I'm like ohh
Sippin' on drank I'm like ohh
Maison Margiela like ohh
I'm getting top on my coop
A nigga so set like ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
