[Verse 1: Voduz]
Yeah, uh

East, west, in the middle
That's a no fly zone
'Cause we drop bombs every chance we get
Told you niggas I am floodin' yo time-lines with plenty of them dope rhymes
I put them down in no time
We drop the track
They eat it up
We hit the stage
They deep as fuck

Arm and hammer, fix yo manners
Disrespectful, come and fix your grammar
Blow a hole in yo fuckin' skull
