[Hook]
Black boy white boy swag
I pop white boy tags
Got these niggas' mad
Bitches on my ass
I just money dance
Money sag my pants
Shawty hold my bands
While I count all these bands (ayy)
Shawty hold my bands and watch me do my dance
Black boy white boy swag
I feel like Travi man
Black boy white boy swag
I blow like 50 grand (yeah yuh)
Black boy white boy swag (yeah yuh)
Black boy white boy swag (yeah yuh) (x3)
Uh, uh ay

[Verse 1]
Black boy white boy swag
I feel like travi man
Black boy white boy swag
I blow like 50 grand
Black boy white boy swag
Watch me do my dance (white boy white boy)
Bitches on my swag they be in my pants
Niggas' want my swag they can't have my swag (they can't have that shit)
I call that swag surfing let me get that back
Your hoe she on the mouth look cross em' out
I just smash and pass
Now she in my past
Black boy white boy swag
Tell that hoe fall back (fall back fall back!)
I pop a bean I'm moon walkin' too much swag
Adjust my hoe real now she gotta' act
Iâ€™m a walking lick, bitch I keep a bag
Fuck what that nigga talkin' bout'
Cuz I know that nigga ain't talkin' bout' what the fuck we talkin' bout
Shoot a nigga in his mouth shoot him in his mouth
Bitch I'm raised in the south, fuck you tahm' bout'
Cash Carti nigga, I'm a street nigga
I was raised with some nigga's with them heat'as nigga
Use to kick them back go and take anything
Nigga take a wedding ring boy we off the chain
