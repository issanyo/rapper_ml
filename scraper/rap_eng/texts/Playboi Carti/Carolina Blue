[Verse: Playboi Carti]
No ventilation, hoes stimulating on this novacane I'm making
Still searching for the one we in the Martrix
Words from the sea ?
Never gave a fuck about the ?
Muscle arms, muscle arms cooking up with baking soda
God never let my enemies get between insanity and Hova
Turning clouds into castles ? slow cameras roll
These bitches listen to us like we got mind control
Overdose my high nigga, I'm flying
By the jets shout out the sky nigga, I'm dying
I take a pound and break it down into a baby bud
Roll up a spliff, then I light it up, now take a puff
It takes concentration when I'm blazing on this elevation
Now treat your hate with my herbal medication
Yeah nigga, ?

[Outro: Sample from Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]
You smoking reefers?
Yeah of course we are, can't you smell it?
No Sam. I can't
Come on Dewey! Join the party!
No Dewey! You don't want this. Get outta here!
You know what I don't want no hangover, I can't get no hangover
It doesn't give you a hangover!
Well, I get addicted to it or something?
Its not habit forming
I don't wanna, overdose on it
You can't OD on it!
It's not gonna make me wanna have sex is it?
It makes sex even better
Sounds kinda expensive
Its the cheapest drug there is
