[Verse: Jace]
Purple in the Fanta, weed in the funnel
Loud, gas, hear me, pronto
Strippers in the condo in here blunted
Got a couple hundo, head honcho
Check rental, bitch rental
Get your issue, man tell me what you wanna
You niggas want it with an Eastside stunna
Get her off a xan man, watch it do numbers
I can tell you right now man, it's a real hot summer
Plug tried to shoot me, I'ma put him in a slumber
Send his momma flowers, fuck his baby momma
I'm addicted to this shit, I got a whole bunch of problems
Don't nobody want it with a nigga like me
Little ity bity bitch shoulda known I'm addicted to the street life

[Hook: Playboi Carti]

She think I'm in love, boy that's a dumb ho
Yeah, that's a dumb ho
She think I'm in love, boy that's a dumb ho
Yeah, that's a dumb ho
She think I'm in love, boy that's a dumb ho
Yeah, that's a dumb ho
