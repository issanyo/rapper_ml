Money do somethin', I was really hungry
I ain't had none, had to shake some
I ain't had none, nigga we was bumrushed
In the back in the flat countin' new hunnids
My partner just died, rest in peace to him
Two Glocks on my side, Larry Vickers
Two Glocks on my side, nigga who is him?
Bitch I came from nothin', had to prove somethin'
She say she feelin' me, but I ain't in nothin'
30 bands Young Carti, we ain't hear none
I'm fuckin' on these bitches, boy I ain't hear none
I'm fuckin' on these bitches, boy like Nina
I pump fade, aye pass it to my nigga he ain't on
