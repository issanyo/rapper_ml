[Verse]
Hol'up, who that bangin' on my door?
If a nigga try to rob me, I'ma blow him in the throat
Hold up, don't be blowin' up my phone
Sounding like a little hoe, about some coke you fucking hoe
It's Cartier, these diamonds let you niggas know
You see these 100's , these 100's, nigga we blow
Fuck her under covers, my nigga until the morn'
She say, Carti why you actin' funny?
Ever since you got some money, you been frontin' on me
Say no more!
The new cars, the new broads, you so bright but you so lost
Damn! You let the lean get you so gone
Don't let the drugs get you so gone
Don't let the drugs get you so gone
You so bright but you so lost!
Sippen' on this act, don't know how to act
My little whoadie got my back, he'll blow you back!
My little whoadie got the strap, he'll blow you back!
So fuckin' Lost
Lost
Lost
So, so fuckin' lost
Lost
