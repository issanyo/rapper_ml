[Verse]
Uh, I got a date with the devil, woah
Ima rockstar, heavy metal, yeah
You see a opp car? Bitch, push the pedal (skkrt! skkrt!)
Boy, you gon' need some more, tryna get on my level
Uh, I can't go to jail no more! (I can't do it!)
I put that on my grandma's soul
Got a spanish bitch, she love to do the most
If my money low you know I'm kickin' doors
Jugg my lifestyle
Yo' bitch get piped down
Left the block, damn, it's a drought now
Michael Phelps, I can clear the drought, wow!
Uh, Carti that be, two hoes on me, two phones on me
You don't know me, don't know shit about me!
