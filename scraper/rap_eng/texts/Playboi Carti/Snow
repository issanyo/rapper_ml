[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
On my pops, fuck an opp, I got hella guap
Niggas sheeps, when I buy, I don't like to talk
Still on lean, still on bean, I can't hold to pop
Snow bunny, Easter pink, she gulp every drop
Mom used to get mad about the haze
Now a young nigga gettin paid cuz' he blaze
New cars, new broads, that's the everyday
[?] sitting if you feeling some way
Icy codiene got me feeling this way
Hoe give me face all she wanted was a taste
Plug hit my line, tell me "meet me at my place"
Do a couple deals then we ship em outta state
With the tool tho, got a two door, act a fool though
You ain't even know
Nigga had to call his crew though, pull up to your mama house
Nigga see me in my clout
Henny and my coke
With my dick in his hoe

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
She ain't know I made snow
(Snow, Snow, Snow, Snow)
She ain't know I made snow
Semi in my coat
Henny and my coke
With my dick in his hoe
She ain't know I made snow

[Verse 2: Kewbrik]
Get the top in my Beamer
While I'm bumping my own shit
Had the johns ask, "how do fuck do I afford it?"
Bitches don't ask see the pipe and blow it
My plug line bling and I just ignore it
(Shit)
I'm off the gass and the Hennessy
Add a lil coke now that's just a remedy
Twist a lil spliff no stem, no C's
Semi in my coat
Now that's for my enemies
Now don't act foolish
Don't be stupid girl you're used to it
Snort these lines girl you'll be fine I said you'll see Cupid
I shouldn't love these hoes
But I think I'm alright
(Hell nah)
Well at least I got the semi automatic right?
(Whoo)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Semi in my coat
Henny and my coke
With my dick in his hoe
She ain't know I made snow
(Aye, Aye, Aye)
She ain't know I made snow

[Verse 3: Dantes]
Pour your henny, light your dro
Mami love my blow
Buy it bitch I call it snow
She ain't even know
Got my shooters in a row
I came with nines but it ain't show
I hang with shawty keep it low
She slide up on with a friend in a foreign
She from overseas say that she touring
One night in my city she say it ain't boring
One night with her she [?] with the homies
[?]
Shawty gripping my body
Ooo she calling me papi
Pull a trigger like Shawty
