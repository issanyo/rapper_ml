[Verse 1: Los]
Bitch I'm groovy I put all my chicks in Loubies
Plus I blow that hammer money have your honey twist and screw me
Like a Philip screwdriver, just cop the wheel and you drive her
She pop the pill and blew fire that mean her head was the bomb like
But I'm the only one blowin' up told her please bring yo homies
Don't be the only one showin' up
They call me Mr. Roper she peep the swag in the stizzy
Was just her and her friends so we did the Jack, Janet, Chrissy
That's three company nigga, these bitches fuck with me nigga
You four leaf clover, these hoes just ain't got luck with me nigga

[Hook]
They trynna hate, too late for it
All they can do now, is wait for it
Wait for it (wait for it), wait for it(wait for it), wait for it(wait for it)
Now now now let that bitch go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Wait for it, wait for it
Go, go, go, go

[Verse 2: Los]
They say my I'm ruthless, I got no roof on the coupe when its out
I rock the kind of jewelry these bitches go stupid about
Say my name gon' make me come knock every tooth out ya mouth
Stand on my money then take a piss on the roof of ya house
I'm the opposite of Santa Claus, cadillac, Diana Ross
Ridin' with a wheelie like my car really got handlebars
Got Shaq's on the truck, got Kobe's on the coupe
Got a bad little bitch trynna throw a nigga oops
That's a pick and roll, she throw it to me
I throw it back, thats a give and go
Then we gettin' low like midgets, bruh your bitches pray these niggas dead
Waitin' for these rappers to diss me, fuck it these niggas scared

[Hook]
They trynna hate, too late for it
All they can do now, is wait for it
Wait for it (wait for it), wait for it(wait for it), wait for it(wait for it)
Now now now let that bitch go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Wait for it, wait for it
Go, go, go, go

[Verse 3: Los]
Aye they don't want this pirahna, just my persona could beat ya'
Don't get it twisted I'm gifted like Christmas, Hanukkah, Easter
They say that bastard 'bout to drop a classic and make all these rappers learn
Everybody waitin' for it like this bitch a tax return
Uhm, your bitch was waitin' to scope me
She posted all on my block like Big Perm was waitin' for Smokey
I told her skate with the homie, and got my whole team ate
Then made the bitch wait like a protein shake
I was weighing my options I had some weight on my back
But ain't no way that I'm stoppin' now I'm awake from my nap
Yeah I'm a monster, I conquer and I'm just statin' the facts
Without no sponsor they call me the most awaited in rap, nigga
