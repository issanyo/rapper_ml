[Intro]
Oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Been staring at these walls all night
I think I'm 'bout to hit the town
Me and my shawty broke up, god damn
I ain't the type for being down

[Pre-Chorus]
So tonight I'm going up
On whatever day it is
Surrounded by women reminiscing
I've got this drink in my cup
And as crazy as it is
Imma act like I'm happy, though I ain't

[Chorus]
Why do people make pretend like everything's okay?
Oh no
And still we both fall back and act all out and don't pick up the phone
We be like, fuck it
I'm good (I'm good)
I'm straight (I'm straight)
I'm okay
We be like, fuck it
You good (You good)
We good (We good)
But we ain't
Why do we be like, fuck it?

[Verse 2]
Now if I took a girl back home and took her down in my sheets
Took her down, took her down
And if you find out somehow
Technically I ain't cheatin', fuck it

[Pre-Chorus]
So tonight I'm going up
On whatever day it is
Surrounded by women reminiscing
I've got this drink in my cup
And as crazy as it is
Imma act like I'm happy, though I ain't

[Chorus]
Why do people make pretend like everything's okay?
Oh no
And still we both fall back and act all out and don't pick up the phone
We be like, fuck it
I'm good (I'm good)
I'm straight (I'm straight)
I'm okay
We be like fuck it
You good (You good)
We good (We good)
But we ain't
Why do we be like, fuck it?
