[Hook: Teo]
What if God was like us?
Had a squad just like us?
Always poppin' tags just like us?
Gucci bags just like us?
Always keep them stacks just like us?
Almost threw up in my tour bus
What if God was like us?
Had a squad just like us?
Always poppin' tags just like us?
Gucci bags just like us?
I want to know, I want to know
I want to know, I want to know
Left wrist just like ooh, right hand just like ooh (Chi, chi, boo, boo)
Neck on bae like ooh, my chick bad like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Ayo]
What if God was just like us?
What if God moved like us?
What if God cried like us?
Struggle went on bus to bus
Everybody on the same drug
Everybody want the same look
Keep it real with my day ones
Don't like nothing of that fake love

[Pre-hook: Teo]
Threw up on the tour bus
Man, I swear I grew up these past four months
Shorty want the crew, it's more than four of us
Made a hit and blew, God opened doors for us (hello)

[Verse 2: Teo and Ayo]
In God we trust (I didn't trust nobody)
No hate, all love (No hate it's all love)
Bezel shine like the sun (Bezel shine like the sun shine)
That comes from above (Give it up for God one time)
Keep my head up on all one of y'all (Gotta keep my head up)
Pop like a pimple, keep on trying us (Pop like a pimple)
Girls be tripping just to get to us
Scottie Pippen, that's my shooter yah
