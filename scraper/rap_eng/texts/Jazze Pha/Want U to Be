[Verse 1:]
Girl your beauty it could fill a book
Once glance girl is all it took
It ain't too hard to spot ya
I saw you from a mile a-way
Tell me fellas why she gotta be
The coldest thing that a playa see
I gotta do whatever
Try anything it don't matter I gotta let her see
If there's a sign she's diggin' me enough to make love on the first night
Then that's a good look
Can I be honest with you
I, I, I, girl I want you to be

[Chorus:]
Better than you knew me girl
I need your lovin' for me
Girl I want you to be mine
With the quickness
Skip the bull-sh
Girl your gonna be
Better than ever
When you finally get my love
Inside your b-ody
Ah baby, ah baby, ah baby

[Verse 2:]
Now the word is
Nobody ever gets too close to talk to you for too long
All the gossip about you, it's all bad
Cause the truth is
That you've been needing good lovin' for a year and some months and some days and some hours and some seconds
Baby let me take your stress
Like a puff on the best from the West
And if you decide you're diggin' me enough to make love on the first night
Then that's a good look
Can I be honest with you
I, I, I, I want you to be

[Chorus (x2)]
Better than you knew me girl
I need your lovin' for me
Girl I want you to be mine
With the quickness
Skip the bull-sh
Girl your gonna be
Better than ever
When you finally get my love
Inside your b-ody
Ah baby, ah baby, ah baby

Yo Yo, if Marvin was here, he'd prolly do a lil somethin like this
Ya'll listen

I'll give you love and affection
Girl my sex is a blessin'
Lord I said wow
You're marvelous
Let your love come down
Don't be repressed
Yea Baby
Work so good like I knew you would
Yea baby
I'm at a loss for words
Now just pull your body close to mine
My love is gettin' closer to the sun as you go
The only thing that's left is to give you every bit shook up
Can we imagine
Lay inside eachother all night
Can I be honest baby, I want you to be

[Chorus]
Better than you knew me girl
I need your lovin' for me
Girl I want you to be mine
With the quickness
Skip the bull-sh
Girl your gonna be
Better than ever
When you finally get my love
Inside your b-ody
Ah baby, ah baby, ah baby

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gotta have you gotta have you gotta have you gotta have you baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gotta have you gotta have you gotta have you gotta have you baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gotta have you gotta have you gotta have you gotta have you baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
