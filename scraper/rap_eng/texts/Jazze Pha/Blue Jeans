Oh, oh
Oh, oh
(Blue jeans)

[Verse 1:]
I've been checking you
And I like the way you walk
Your sexy B-boy style
That confidence you flaunt

So let me take a minute
To introduce myself
'Cause you don't need to know anybody else

[Chorus:]
Here's my number
You can call
Any time you wanna talk
That's exactly where I'll be
When you wanna get at me

If you wonder what you do
That's got me into you
It's your blue jeans
The way that you rocking
Them blue jeans, baby

[Verse 2:]
No one else makes me feel
The way you do inside
Sensation is so real
Hit me day or night

So keep this nice and safe
Somewhere near your heart
Wouldn't wanna lose this love before we start

You got everything
That I want
(That I want)
You got everything
That I need
(That I need, yeah)

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Come on, baby

(Call me)
Call me
Anytime you feel the need
You can
(Call me)
Call me
'Cause I like what you do to me

Won't you
(Call me)
Call me
Oh, baby, you're like a dream
(Call me)
Call me
Come by in them blue jeans

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

You can call if you wanna talk
Where I'll be
Get at me, oh
What you do

It's your blue jeans
The way that you're rocking
Your blue jeans, baby

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Come on, come on
Woo
