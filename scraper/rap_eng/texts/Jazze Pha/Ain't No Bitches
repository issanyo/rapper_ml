Chorus:

Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it dont stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy "All I got is top notch"
Gotta keep a fat knot it dont stop

Verse one:

Im the super player, I got women everwhere
I know you love a square, I dont care
I still get it, anytime I want to
Call her at the house, I think she said "come through"
Im coming, everytime I see her
Thats what im doing, I can't believe ya
When ya tell me, shes all yours
Cause when I have her on the floor, down on all fours
She said its mine, and thats for sure
If you come around when im near, you gotta go
Cause you dont nothing bout this ballers work
When we was players coming up we knocked all the girls
And now I just go out and take my pick
If you gotta enough game you can take my bitch
I won't hate you, try to clown, I'll put you down
Cause I got women all over this town

Chorus:

Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it dont stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy "All I got is top notch"
Gotta keep a fat knot it dont stop

Verse Two:

You couldn't be a betta player then me, you ain't got enough game
You couldn't take her from me, you ain't even have a chance
Not with me in the picture
You even got the last dance to see what it could gets you
Nothing, broken hearted and lonely
Cause when its over, shes going home with me
Five foot nine short hair big booty
Looking like the leading lady starring in a movie
Fly crib, mercedes benz
She loves niggas like me and my shady friends
And when we hang out, dont count the champagne bottles
Thinking Im drunk, I dont play game lotto
I put the game down from the start
And you ain't nothing but a dumb ass mark
She started teasing when she saw the red carpet
What did you say nigga "Get ya ass in the car bitch"

Chorus:

Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it dont stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy "All I got is top notch"
Gotta keep a fat knot it dont stop

Verse Three:

Hoochies, cheerleaders, groupies, beer drinkers
High class stuck up hoes, that getting real freaky
Laywers, nurses, police women, teachers
If shes a top notch, I keep her
Tall ass models, skinny and shit, big tities, short and thick
All complexions, different nationalities
Pimp game from from east oakland, out to cali
Keep 'em teenage to middle age, is she paid
Cuz if she ain't, what can she make
If I see a bad bitch I ain't fin away
Im gonna holla at her, I can't discriminate
Its not about the sex, not all the time
Cause im trying to get in her mind
Like when ya stand and just stare at the ocean
I help ya manage your emotions, bitch

Chorus:

Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it dont stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy "All I got is top notch"
Gotta keep a fat knot it dont stop

Talking:

Ain't no bitches like my bitches, I know ya think ya gotta lotta hoes nigga
And ya probably do, but theres one fact that'll always be true
You couldn't be a betta player than me nigga
Life is, life is too short, so keep trying nigga keep trying
Numba one, player of the year, player of the decade
Player of the century, player of the mothafucking millenium
And his name is too $hort, bitch
