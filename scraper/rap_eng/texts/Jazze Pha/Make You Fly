[Los]
Uh Los, uh
You think the king in you
Is bigger than the king in me?
Be's what is seems
But everything ain't what it seem to be
See, the thing in me ain't a fake thing to me
So nigga I ain't never changin', like Drake's singing key
Yea I bear, Hug a bear, I sting a bee
Your girl I wouldn't dare, fuck her bare
I just sling the Bee-I-t-c-h, I see hate
But a G make space because I create
Space between me and these fake fucks in the game
Yea I'm all about
All about my bucks and my change
You know ballin' out, Ballin' out
Money fallin' out my pockets
They watch what they jealous of
She said when I see you watch saw my watch
And she fell in love
This is it, this is it the timing and all
The difference between
Just gettin' over and Climbin' the wall
My trying efforts, designed my flying methods
My mind defined presence
Inclined defines essence
So with it, Gotta get it in 99 seconds
Inspiring the un-fly, Providing them fly lessons
Supplying them my blessings
They shine in my kind presence
My presence is a Present
You kinda behind lesson
Get the message?

[Hook 2x]
Be grateful my nigga, grateful my nigga
It's still all love when they hate you my nigga
Being broke should never break you my nigga
Cause coming from the bottom make you fly nigga
Lets Fly, lets fly

Ladies & Gentlemen
Id like to welcome you all
The Crown Ain't, I said The Crown Ain't Safe in the hood
Whats goood
