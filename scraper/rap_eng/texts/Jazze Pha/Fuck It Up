Pull up to the club with a check (Skrt), fuck it up

Pull up to the club, bitches be like, "Who are you?"
I'll fuck 'em up and let 'em look between Louboutin and Jimmy Choo
Tell me what you want, I got it all in my pocket
Gooey-ooey-ooey drippin' all in my closet
Balmain boots, these ain't no fuckin' Doc Martens
I got shooters out in Houston and they will hit you with a rocket (Woo)

Door, yeah, door, yeah (Yeah, yeah)

Five-star suites, top-floor, I'ma fuck it up (Uh)

Gimme your broad, I'll fuck it up (What?)

You flexin' like you lit, but I'm the reason that you poppin'
Ice so cold they call me Coca Baskin-Robbins
