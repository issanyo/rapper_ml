Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a Jazzy Fizzle produshizzle
I'd like to introduce yall to somebody
That you should already know
Introducing Ruben Studdard

I noticed lately we've just been getting right
Our love is there it just needs some light
I think we need to go back to basics
Like when I used to call you on the phone
And tell you to get your fresh clothes on
We need to start that again
Baby listen, let me tell you what we gon do
We gonna act like we brand new
And I'ma take you to the spot where I first laid eyes on you
And we gon dance tonight and hit that one-two step
One-two step baby
All night yea yea
Tell the DJ to play our song

My song, your song
The way he did the night we fell in love
And I held your hand. Do you remember that?
Yes I remember that
Play our song and take me back to the night
I met my baby and I asked you to dance
Do you remember that, yes I remember that

You always runnin around and I work till the sun go down
We hardly see one another
And barely got time for each other
And we need a break. We need to get this love back poppin
And let the people know we still got it
Here's the way
Let me tell you what we gon do
We gonna act like we brand new
And I'ma take you to the spot where I first laid eyes on you
And we gon dance tonight and hit that one-two step
One-two step baby
All night yea yea
Tell the DJ to play our song

My song, your song
The way he did the night we fell in love
And I held your hand. Do you remember that?
Yes I remember that
Play our song and take me back to the night
I met my baby and I asked you to dance
Do you remember that?

Ooohh I, oh I, I just wanna take it back
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Let's get back to the love
Ooohh I, oh I just wanna get back to me and you
You know we're all I do
