[Hook]
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?
I'm looking for that girl (I'm looking for my valentine)
I'm looking for that girl (I'm looking for my valentine)

[Verse 1]
Oh, I want someone who loves me (Forever)
Everyday she shows me
It ain't all about this holiday
I don't wanna spend this day alone

[Pre-Hook]
I've been, I've been searching
Someone come and save me
Give me your heart, give me your heart
Til' death do us part (Do anyone?)

[Hook]
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?
I'm looking for that girl (I'm looking for my valentine)
I'm looking for that girl (I'm looking for my valentine)


[Verse 2]
Oh, I be Jay, you Beyonce (Forever)
That crazy love, what can I say? (Crazy love)
Never ever no breaking up
I don't wanna spend this day all alone

[Pre-Hook]
I've been, I've been searching
Someone come and save me
Give me your heart, give me your heart
Til' death do us part (Do anyone?)

[Hook]
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?
I'm looking for that girl (I'm looking for my valentine)
I'm looking for that girl (I'm looking for my valentine)

[Bridge]
I'm looking for a girl
To be my girl
I'm looking for a girl
To be my girl
Your love is calling for me
My love is calling for you
Your love is calling for my love, my love
My love is calling, woah

[Outro]
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine? (Do anyone?)
Do anyone out there wanna be my valentine?
