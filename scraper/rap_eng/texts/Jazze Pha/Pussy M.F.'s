I fight fire with fire, sneakin through lines with mine
Tote A.K.'s and 9's, if you try me fuck nigga you dying
Like the cops and robbers, coming cocked I'ma rob you
Open shop, sellin bags of weed and dummy blocks
Ask pops about us, he'll tell ya we got em
? rocks, and some of that baby powder
Breaker Breaker one-nine, Adair County for life
If you drop a dime or testify, boy you die
Fuck all you motherfuckers, snitches and undercovers
Goin for them, I'm going over there to do you brother
Who gon protect ya then, you'd best to check it in
Sell your house, hide out, don't come back here again
You damn backstabber, I looked out for ya
You used to be my homie, 'till ya put the cops on me
Home boy it's ugly, you know I gots to cut you
You tried me like a sucker, so nigga motherfuck you

I'm from the city where they they tote Glocks, chop rocks
Ride spinnin wheels and they'll steal ya car and send it to the chop-shop
50 slabs in my socks, couple grams in my drawers
We ain't even in the club and everybody tipsy dog
Down south dope dealing, ride high smoke Phillies
We come watch how I, ride by and smoke niggas
Call me Mr. Toucan Man, I bought a new tan band
With two K's in the palm of my hand, to show we ain't playing
Where you stand is where you land, sprayin with either hand
Wings expand like eagles but land like Peter Pan
Pull off in the Regal Man, rollin that reefer
Holdin a lethal, felony piece in my pants
And when I see them people I'm mashing the gas in the Jag
Stashin the mask with the cash Bumping that Beanie Sigel
And when you see my my pants matching my brand
Brand matching the band and the band matching the benz homie
And when I'm creeping, I'm sneakin a bitch from France
I'm freakin her she so freaky she sleeps in the 3-point stance
