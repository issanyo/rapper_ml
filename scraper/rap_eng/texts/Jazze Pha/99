[Verse 1]
I got 99 problems right around the corner
Walls of the gave one Tiburon that money
And 99 had two thousand black horn for money
Had 99 problem get money like one of them no no no
99 going all on one arm
All arm got a hundred
That sprayed 99 hundred
Spend 99 thousand dollar cash on my pinky
Gave the other thousand to the driver told my homie thank you
Got 99 million pair of shoes can’t choose I’m a hustler
Got 99 million grind n*gga I can’t lose
Get your muscle up with your sparklers out
99 and I bought the champagne all them booty call
99 percent I’m gonna make it rain
