[Intro: Jazze Pha]
WOO! Oh.. She looks so beautiful, don't you agree?
Girl, you know what I think you should do right now?
You should just take off all of your clothes
Every article of clothing, except for the
Leave the pumps on girl, I like that
Enough of the kissin and huggin..

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We should be fuckin, on da bed on da couch now
Fuckin, fuckin, fuckin..
From the front to the living room
We should be fuckin, on da bed on da couch now
Fuckin, fuckin, fuckin..
From the front to the living room

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Let the boys make love
Let me fuck ya from da back, hair pullin, hot wax
They won't do it like dat
They can't do it like this
They won't tie you by your wrist
And spank ya lil sexy bad ass, cum quick (hey)
Yea I know you hard at work
Yea I know your boss a jerk
You can come to da platter, tie you up, witcha skirt
Let ya man make love
Let me bring ya to da crib, you a big city gurl
Let me show you where I live
Gotta pond in da front, gotta lake in da back
If you wanna pop da trunk
We can do it in da lac
Got a dick like a horse
Let me see you take that

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We should be fuckin, on da bed on da couch now
Fuckin, fuckin, fuckin..
From the front to the living room
We should be fuckin, on da bed on da couch now
Fuckin, fuckin, fuckin..
From the front to the living room

[Verse 2: David Banner]
Girl gon' lose ya mind
Let my dick touch your spine
Cum 4 or 5 times
Southside bump-n-grind
Young lady stand in line
But I wanna fuck you
And all ya freaky dreams I wanna make come true
Like fuckin on da back porch
Gon' let it out
Or we can fuck in time square I make you scream Dirty South
Damn I ain't tryna run game
But I will make you scream my name (David Banner)
Yea my G5 just an airplane
Take it how you want it girl pleasure or pain (hey)
Yea cuz ya dealin wit a mack now
Go and tell ya friends dat I blew ya back out

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We should be fuckin, on da bed on da couch now
Fuckin, fuckin, fuckin..
From the front to the living room
We should be fuckin, on da bed on da couch now
Fuckin, fuckin, fuckin..
From the front to the living room

[Bridge: Jazze Pha]
When ya step into the crib
Get in your birthday suit
Girl leave on ya heels
And get it ready for daddy
I guarantee your satisfaction
I hope your ready for action
I'm in da mood (baby)
Forget ya nigga
Stand and revizzle put ya back into it
When I work da middle
(make it hurt a little)
When I hit it from the back girl

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We should be fuckin, on da bed on da couch now
Fuckin, fuckin, fuckin..
From the front to the living room
We should be fuckin, on da bed on da couch now
Fuckin, fuckin, fuckin..
From the front to the living room
