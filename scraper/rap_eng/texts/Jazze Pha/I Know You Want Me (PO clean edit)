Jazze Pha that is for all you numbskulls out there
Hey speakin of pimpin thats my nigga

(Chorus - Jazze Pha)
Just hop in my ride
If you want some
We can only get high
If you want some
Gotta open them wide
If you want some
I can see in your eyes that you want some

I know you want me shawty

(Verse 1 - Young Buck)
These hoes out here love me
I get it wet
N*ggas old ladies want to f*ck me
You should see the sh*t
I'm nuthin like them other thugs
That eat it quick
Too many n*ggas in this club
I need a b*tch
We park right up in the front
You see the six
I puff some smoke up out my blunt
And pop the Chris
I gotta find me a model
I like em thick
I make her hop in my Impala
Go take a trip
Clean off my shoe and pop my collar
I'm rich b*tch
Oh what you never seen a balla
Well this is it
I make that p*ssy feel good
'Til you tell me quit
And I won't tell nobody that you let me hit
Sike!

(Chorus - Jazze Pha)

(Verse 2 - Young Buck)
Okay then shawty if you ready
Then lets go
Lets take it from the dirty to the East and West Coast
A couple shots of Patron

Lets have a sex show
I got a lot but baby
You can be my best ho
I see you watchin a playa
She like my dress code
Rockin these Cardieys
Drinkin that X-O
I know a place that we can go
And get low
You wit a gangsta
You ain't never felt like this before
And if you know that p*ssy good
Then hit tha floor
Shake that a*s like you should
Go get that dough
I'll make you love me if you let me
Fo' real though
See down here we put Chevy's ridin' real slow
So come on

(Chorus - Jazze Pha)

(Bridge - Young Buck)
Don't get scared girl
Show me what you got
Show me what you got
Just show me what you got
I said Don't get scared girl
Show me what you got
Show me what you got
Just show me what you got
C'mon Don't get scared girl
Show me what you got
Show me what you got
Just show me what you got
I said Don't get scared girl
Show me what you got
