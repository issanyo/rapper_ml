[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Came here tonight, knew I would see you but I wasn't quite ready for it, no
These feelings I can't ignore 'cause the two us are over
But I'm not sure if I'm over you, baby, I made the mistake
When I upped and walked away, now I wish I had one more chance

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
One, one more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl and I wish I had one
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over 'cause I wish I had one

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
One more night to talk late on the phone and more
One more smiling face like that ones you used to put on the bottom of your notes
Oh, one more touch, one more hug, ooh
Don't even talk about a kiss, I can't help but reminisce 'cause I wish I had

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
One, one more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl and I wish I had one
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over 'cause I wish I had one
One more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl and I wish I had one
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over 'cause I wish I had one

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Baby, oh, baby, I know I stated we needed sometime apart
But seeing you has got me on a mission, I'm just wishing
Maybe, just maybe you'll realize it and let me back in your heart
I'm at your mercy, ooh girl, I wish I had

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
One, one more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl and I wish I had one
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over 'cause I wish I had one
One more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl and I wish I had one
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over 'cause I wish I had one

[Outro: Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen, you have now tuned into the very best
A Jazze Fizzle product-shizzle, introducing Chris Brown
Chris Brown, sho'nuff, sho'nuff
Fizzle, Fizzle, Fizzle, ooh wee
So smooth, so smooth, daddy
Just step, hey, just step
Now let's go, let's go, let's go
