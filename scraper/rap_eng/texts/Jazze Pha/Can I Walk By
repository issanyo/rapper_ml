[Spoken]
Hell yeah!

[Sung]
Can I walk by without you grabbing me?
Shortie, tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you really want from me
Want to holla at me? You can meet me at the VIP

'Cause I know that's where you want to be
Right here next to me
So I guess you want to roll with me
Dedicated to the rules, I don't call my mo

You know I wish she'd never sung before
When you're around you're acting like you never flow your mo
You know once we hit the club and call your mo
Listen

I'll be callin ya'll
Ya'll be callin me
'Cause I'm a space age pet like 8-ball and G
Jazze Pha and lacey, jazze hit hacey

Girl you want to cut your player
Please believe me
She want to pop ya day, she want to kill ya dre
She want to a player with premium fuel in the tank

She gotta Diamond fidish, with carrots in the lettuce
She want to run through the team, just like your own babies
I tried the bob and weave, she caught me by the sleeve
And told the pap a few things that you would not believe

She want to sip from the jealous, play platinum pelous
She made me look like a salad to are Kelly

Can I walk by, without you grabbing me?
Shortie, tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you really want from me
Want to holla at me? You can meet me at the VIP

'Cause I know that's where you want to be
Right here next to me
So I guess you want to roll with me

Cuddle up you, I know I can bet ya you can spin the two
'Cause ya so fine, so fine
Daddy don't ya want me?
Jazze won't you hold me?

To you I won't do, I'll be up all night, just come through
What you want to do?
Super fine, spend the night

Jazze won't you hold me
Jazze don't you want me?

She walked throught the door
Don't get excited she been invited to a quiet store
Now I need your hand coz your boyfriend hates me
Like Janet Jackson, What have you done lately?

I heard you say, you want me to hit with no protection
Sorry baby that's a ding a ling out of the question
Got your body on fire, ready for the session
She got a platinum boo boo collection

Licking your lips like I'm a delicatessen
Your thongs are soaked, you need a proper refreshment
This is a video, triple recollection
Feed to your dog and play it like a resurrection

Can I walk by, without you grabbing me?
Shortie, tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you really want from me
Want to holla at me? You can meet me at the VIP

'Cause I know that's where you want to be
Right here next to me
So I guess you want to roll with me

Cuddle up you, I know I can bet ya you can spin the two
'Cause ya so fine, so fine
Daddy don't ya want me?
Jazze won't you hold me?

To you I won't do, I'll be up all night, just come through
What you want to do?
Super fine, spend the night

Jazze won't you hold me
Jazze don't you want me?

Can I walk by, without you grabbing me?
Shortie, tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you really want from me
Want to holla at me? You can meet me at the VIP

'Cause I know that's where you want to be
Right here next to me
So I guess you want to roll with me
