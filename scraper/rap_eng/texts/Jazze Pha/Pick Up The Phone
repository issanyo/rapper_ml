[Intro]
Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh
Where you at boy
Where you at boy

[Verse 1:]
Ohh I've been callin you night long
And I'm becoming best friends with the dial tone
Cause you not pickin up the phone
I called ya cell and ya home
And still I sit here alone
Boy you got me wonderin where
You at where you goin and where
You been here I go again
Dialin ya number thinkin how
You just won't pick up the phone

[Chorus:]
Pick up the phone (boy) (8x)
Pick up
I know u see me on ya caller I.D
So pick up the P-H-O-N-E
Pick up the phone boy
Pick up the phone
Ayiyiyi

[Bridge:]
I said you know it would be nice (that's right)
If you can call somebody
And let somebody know
That you alright, who you know

[Verse 2]
Ya dead wrong (yes u are)
For sendin me straight to voicemail
Cause if it was my phone and I did the same
You'd be raisin all kind of hell (ooh ooh)
Called the second time it go... (Brr boop)
Like you on the other line
Run game on a rookie
Cause I'm too sharp for that why
Dont u pick up the phone?

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]

[Pre-Chorus: 4x]
Hey now, don't act like that
I know u got my message, boy call me back
Hey now, don't act wrong
Be a real G and pick up the phone

[Chorus: 2x]

[Outro]
Sitting by the phone
Waiting for you to call
I'm really getting tired worrying
Baby
