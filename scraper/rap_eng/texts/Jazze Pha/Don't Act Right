[Intro: Jazze Pha]
Whoa, I know you
Fantasia

[Verse 1: Jazze Pha]
26's on the hummer girl ever seen those
Till you seen my closet, you ain't never seen clothes
Three quarter minks to canary minks stole
When a time stay in and out of these stores
Phinzle Fantasia off the chain
Sho'nuff sound made ya, ain't it man?
Girl, you the greatest, do ya thang
It's so contagious, shorty sang

[Verse 2: Fantasia]
Baby, we need to talk, not tryna start a fight
But something with us is wrong and you cannot deny it
Please forgive me for sayin'
But I'm feelin' like maybe a heart ain't in it lately
It's gon' hurt me but I gotta tell you

[Hook: Fantasia]
Baby, it's ridiculous, why we don't talk that much
And I love you and I'll give you all I got
I'm in your corner but ya don't act right
I'm tryna love you but ya don't act right
Baby, please tell me when ya don't act right
'Cause every other day you don't act right

[Verse 3: Fantasia]
Whatever it is let's put it to rest, let's put it to rest
Because I'm flat out, tired and burn out from all the stress you give me
You, know you ain't never had a woman better
But you know whenever you do these things to you
I wish you'd come out and tell me what did I do to you
Like I was so bad
Made you forget all the times I stood by your side
Baby, I'm really, really second guessing
The conversation and on top of that your hesitation
When I say how I love you and you can't seem to find the words

[Hook: Fantasia]
Baby, it's ridiculous, why we don't talk that much
I love you and I'll give you all I got
But baby, I'm in your corner but ya don't act right
I'm tryna love you but ya don't act right
Baby, tell me when ya don't act right
'Cause every other day you don't act right
[Bridge: Fantasia]
Slow down
Baby, can we please just work it out?
All I want to do is talk it out
I promise we don't have to duke it out
Slow down
And, baby, can we please just work it out?
All I want to do is talk it out
I promise we don't have to duke it out

[Verse 4: Jazze Pha]
J to the a-z-z to the e
They think I don't love you, we finna see
Girl you the truth, me, I'ma sad one, we a good love
This such a average I know ya sensitive, I understand
You, baby, girl yes, yes, I'm ya man
No, I ain't come here to argue or hurt you
Yes, show you love like a that father
Birth you so, so into you ain't ain't gotta cheat
Everything I want, everything I need
Girl, you're my idol, had to lace ya
We a good love, Fantasia

[Hook: Fantasia]
Baby, it's ridiculous, why we don't talk that much
And I love you and I'll give you all I got
But I'm in your corner but ya don't act right
I'm tryna love you but ya don't act right
Baby, please tell me when ya don't act right
'Cause every other day you don't act right
Baby, it's ridiculous, why we don't talk that much
When I love you and I'll give you all I got, baby
Don't act right, you don't act right, don't act right
You don't act right, don't act right, yeah, don't act right

[Outro: Jazze Pha]
Let's go hey, let's go ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen you are now tuned in to the best
Phizzle a jazze phizzle productshizzle
Phizzle, phizzle, phizzle phizzle, phizzle
