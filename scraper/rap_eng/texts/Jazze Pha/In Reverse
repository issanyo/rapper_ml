In reverse!
Jazze Phizzle, Cory Mo, Ayo, Teo! (Let's go!)
Ah, Yeah!

[Chorus]
Oh you check my swag (Aye!), I reverse like dih (Wha?)
Better get it back, and reverse like dih
Put that thing in park (Woo!), and reverse like dih (Skr Skr)
Bring it back restart (Yeah!), and reverse like dih (Yeah!)
Slide to the left (left), and reverse like dih (Reverse)
Drop it off (Okay!), and reverse like dih (Bit, bit, yeah!)
Can you hit the folks (Aye!), and reverse like dih? (In reverse!)
Whip to the left, and reverse like dih (Ah, yeah!)

[Verse 1: Teo]
Hello, I'm the reverse jit
Call me Teo, I reverse my hits, yeah
Send the belt, it don't fit
Reverse king, I swear I'm lit, (Ah, yeah!)
Try to battle me, you won't live
Fans tackle me, cause I reverse that bitch
Mask on, afro big
Designer pants, I'm pullin' chicks

[Chorus]
Oh you check my swag (Aye!), I reverse like dih (Huh?)
Better get it back (Woo!), and reverse like dih
Put that thing in park (Woo!), and reverse like dih (Skr Skr)

Whip to the left, and reverse like dih (Ah, yeah!)

[Verse 2: Ayo]
Hello, I'm Ayo, man
When I reverse, I don't play no games, no!
Walk up in the building and you know we fly
We don't shop at the mall cause there's nothing to buy, no!
Me and Teo, Reverse Kings (In Reverse!)
She grabbing me, she thirsty
Backpack, get off of me
Oglelo, follow me (Ah, Yeah!)

[Chorus]
Oh you check my swag (Aye!), I reverse like dih (Huh?)
Better get it back (Woo!), and reverse like dih
Put that thing in park (Woo!), and reverse like dih (Skr Skr)
Bring it back restart (Yeah!), and reverse like dih (Yeah!)
Slide to the left (left), and reverse like dih (Reverse)
Drop it off (Okay!), and reverse like dih (Bit, bit, yeah!)
Can you hit the folks (Aye!), and reverse like dih? (In reverse!)
Whip to the left, and reverse like dih (Ah, bit, bit, yeah!)

[Ad-Lib: Ayo & Teo]
Hold up (In reverse!)
Ooo look at you looking clean, with the ooo
With the afro puff

(Hit reverse!)
Hello
Book out, now rock out!
(Bit bit yeah!)
Hey, Yeah, Hold up, Woo, Hey, Yeah, Mmm, Ooo
Walk In! Walk out!

Show me what you do, Aye
Show me what you worth, worth
Ok, ok, bit, bit, yeah!
