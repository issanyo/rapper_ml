[Verse 1: Too $hort & Jazze Pha]
I got (16 Hoes), time is up
If they choosin', line 'em up
I'll sign 'em up, I'll sign 'em up
I got a lot of hoes and can't find enough
I got (16 Hoes), can I get some more?
I get a lot of love when I hit the door
If I was 20 years old or 64
I'm like James Bond, I always get the ho
I got (16 Hoes), fuck this trick
If he paid that ho, to suck his dick
That's his business, you know what's up with this
I ain't never paid a dime to fuck a bitch
I got (16 Hoes), 16 flows, spit 16 bars, do 16 shows
I got 16 bitches - you can count 'em
In the last 20 years I made 16 albums

[Verse 2: Jazze Pha]
Who got freaks like me?
You keep one in a bitch ass with feet like me
Not even Miami got heat like me
Only rich motherfuckers doin' beats like me
(16 Hoes) And they all obey
Bitch talked back to me, got dumped in the face
I flunked recess (bitch I don't play)
Do you really understand? (alright, okay)
(16 Hoes) Break brenzell with Phenzell
(Catch that trick) then *chirp* me on my Nextel
Bitch I could care less (if you meant well)
Get ya ass back on the track (and slang that tail)
(16 Hoes) And we a cute little family
My hoes love me (and they can't stand me)
Chubby wads of cash (my hoes hand me)
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 plus 8 is

[Verse 3: Bun B & Jazze Pha]
I take 7 dumb bitches and I put 'em in line
Add 7 more hoes that jock niggas that rhyme
Give me 7 more broads that got doe on they mind
And that's 21 hoes broke at the same time
That ain't (16 Hoes), you need to add about 5 more
And don't bring her here is she ain't a real live ho
Old school pimpin', don't call this a throwback
And fuck a couple hoes, I need a fo'-five (?)
(16 Hoes) Now that's a number that fit me
If they bout they business, sheezy you know where to hit me
Jazze, tell 'em to keep it treal and don't bullshit me

[Verse 4: Too $hort & Jazze Pha]
When I was 16 used to fuck hoodrats, it's not a big thing
A few years later did some major upgrading
See a top-notch, I say "Hey, what's up baby"
(16 Hoes) Can't find your lost whore?
She's probably with $hort, playin' at the golf course
Another ego, a hole-in-one
The game ain't boring, my hoes are fun
I got (16 Hoes) all nicknamed Bitch
Make Daddy happy, y'all get that dick
Since they're everywhere, you figure I'll stop
Couldn't be a better player than me
Nigga, I got (16 Hoes)
