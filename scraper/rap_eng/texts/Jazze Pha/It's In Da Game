In it, I can beat shaquille o'neal, free
Throws hittin him. back him up, post him
Cross him over show him up, take that man
To the cup, make that point and throw him
Up. ain't no time for celebrating, fast
Break with jason kidd, kenyon martin in
The air, alley-oop is what I mean. and my
Army never lose, never took a beating neither 'nd
Beat a man by 20 points, probably saying

Im average height six foot tall, catch me
Driving down the lane... all we do is put
My name on my jersey, I'm a player I'm a
Starter, a shooter and a leader I can be
It all I'm a baller. and fashion down
Here everybody want an interview, that's
Here mama, daddy always wins my shoes
Jazzy pha thinks he even got his own
Shoes, after the game can shoot it if he
Wanted to, my player's a show no can't
See him over there - show no - phantom
Over here, got him over here and raping
Like.. I have no burgers, he's like a
Shrink

[Verse 3; jody breeze]
Yeah, I'm in the same bubble as
The Indiana Pacers, man, so I'm sticking
With the proper name, like McGrady oh
When you, it's the Olympics you'd be
Better trying to make it in, yeah I got
Clicks better make it in, raised in the
Game yeah better make it in, you a
Hustler being in a dream but i'll tell
You man, but I could go get you when it
Going back, even if we go get it it's a
Half court pressure man, it's just as
Hard man playing under pressure who cares
About my money playing under pressure
Post it on the block make it easy for a
Layup..
