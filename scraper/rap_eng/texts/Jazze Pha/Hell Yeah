[Verse 1: August Alsina]
I'm over the limit, but I think I want some more
All my niggas spending, so bartender pour some more
Plus we getting faded, smoking on that hit and quit
Bitches getting naked, don't they know I hit and quit?
What you tryna do? You're looking like some trouble
That I wanna get into, your home girl looking dirty
So she can get it too, I ain't apologising, I ain't sorry
Girl for touching on your body cause I just came here to party

[Hook: August Alsina]
If you been up in the spot and you need another shot
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
If the chick across the room dropping drop it like it's hot
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
If you party 'til the lights turn on
Tell the DJ play your song
If you ain't about to stop, if somebody call the cops
Say hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
I see bottles on the table, shawty on the molly
With a piercing in her navel, puffing like a Marley
Soon everybody faded, waving at my haters
Cause they seeing me mugging at me got me saying
What you wanna do instead of causing trouble? Nigga here's what you should do
Go look around and find some hoes that you can get into
Cause I'm just outchea tryna do the same
But I got the dully on me just in case you wanna bang

[Hook: August Alsina]
If you been up in the spot and you need another shot
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
If the chick across the room dropping drop it like it's hot
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
If you party 'til the lights turn on
Tell the DJ play your song
If you ain't about to stop, if somebody call the cops
Say hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Check me out, check me out, I'm on some conceited shit
Pocket full of dead presidents, but I ain't grieving, bitch
Married to the game, that's forever, I ain't leaving it
I know your man, don't put it down, cause you look like you need the dick
One time for them haters, two times for them fakers
Three times for these bad bitches, we fucking all of them later
Yeah, hell yeah, getting money is my ammo
But I don't pay for no pussy,  so I hope you got that memo
Tell hold on and don't let go
And then I treat the pussy like a rental
And I beat the pussy instrumental
Let's go, let's go

[Hook: August Alsina]
If you party 'til the lights turn on
Tell the DJ play your song
If you ain't about to stop, if somebody call the cops
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
