3-2-1
Wha wha what
Man turn that down...
Give me 5 more minutes
Just 5 more minutes...
What time is it
I'm tired man
11:59 already
Wake up in the morning
One thing on my mind
Cheerios with vanilla
Almond milk
It's all mine
I devour
Take a shower
Grab the papers and sack
See ya'll later I'm packed
Blazed till I get cataract
Laid in the Cadillac
Switch lanes out of the driveway
Like I was on the highway (yeah)
I ride a big boy
Y'all ride a similac
And oh my Cadillac
Has 50's in the back
Playin' Rick James and Tina
So relaxing
Passed on by the neighbor Red Lane
They called him insane
Here's Mr. Kane limps with a cane
Had a crush on Ms. Payne
Blessed and he's strange
Now he can't walk the same
Innocent three-legged rover
Kinda says four-leafed clover
His owner smooth Jason
Yeah game like Playstation
Had the girl's hearts racin'
Like you're nervous
And pacin'
Well I swerved the curb
Corner action like verbs
Niggas sellin' that herb (yeah)
Cops throwin' the bird you heard
I'm on I-20
Wit' 20's (uh huh)
And beats I got plenty
Can't wait to see Jenny

I been all around the world
Met a lot of girls
Jenny yeah that's my dog
I been so many places
Seen so many faces
Still ain't none like my dog
I been around the world
And back again (yeah)
Ain't nobody like her yet
Don't forget your homies
Can't forget my homies

Well
The sun starts to dim and
I'm under the speed limit
And there's hectic traffic too
Got off at exit 22
Stopped at Lorraine's
She's datin' Mr. Kane
And she's just as deranged
And insane in the brain
Man she blew up his Range (look who's talkin')
Shouted things so profane
Uh huh (she's tryin to be like like Left Eye)
So we go to Pit's Lane
Way over by the main
To get the rest of our girls
With them ghetto-ass names (ain't it crazy)
Toleda Bonnie Quesha
With them hairdo's
Look like they went through a seizure
You know
Go to the movies
And you can't see the feature (what the fuck, what the fuck)
And Jenny's father's a preacher
And see her unleashed around daddy so sweet
Without daddy she a freak (she a ho)
I ain't never seen her with the same nigga for weeks
Mmmm mmm
Nah wait a minute (yeah)
I seen her three times with Saadiq

Pull up to Jenny's
And she's waitin' outside
My hair ain't done
Get your ass in the ride
It's Friday night
We high and tight
Jenny sippin' on the Henny
I'm drivin' tonight
My exhaust is about to ignite
We turn on Morland Ave
And then I see these blue lights (blue lights make me nervous)
I feel fright Jenny yells
I ain't goin' to jail tonight girl
So anyway I'm drivin' slow
Then enormously fast
Cuz Jenny's dumb ass slammed on the gas
She says I'm high (ha)
Not to mention all the weed in the ride
And the way we drive
And are stupid to ride
I bust a right on Memorial Drive (go left left)
She threw out the Henn
I threw out the stash
And we was goin' speedin'
Oh so fast
And we stopped
The cops had caught us at last (what you doin' why you stoppin')
Knew I forgot somethin'
I might have needed some gas
So the cop walked up
Knocked on the window
I dropped
I ain't drunk
I forgot Jenny's uncle's a cop (yo uncle a cop)
Yo relax it's me man
You just forgot your keys
Your keys?
Dumbass (you said it girl)
I can't believe I threw out my stash
I shoulda whooped your ass
I know I have some crazy Friday nights
But somethin' about Jenny
Makes it alright
