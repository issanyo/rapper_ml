Verse 1 [Murphy Lee]
I'm sorta like my brotha but very different from others
Like a special police man, I'm always under cover
I'll love you if you love me, I kiss 'em only if kissable
Keep em if they keep able, diss em if they dismissible (Luv me baby)
Skool Boy, fence a tool, make it outside the visit room
Teachin you, makin you listen to me like a principal
Sendin' you, flowers and candy to your family
And I think it's cute how you used to live wit yo granny, maan (Luv me baby)
Work in the mornings, school in the evening, weekday to weekend
Teachin reasons I'm the one you believe in
Demolish ya def, acknowledge yourself
Now you rock a small belt from my nutriential belt (Luv me baby)
I'm the god mami, teach you what you need to be taught
And these feelings that I brought, ma they all in ya thoughts
You can't love nobody 'til you love you
So when you do love somebody you'll know what to do come on..

Verse 2 [Murphy Lee]
See I'm the man like groom and husband
Grandfather or daddy, brother, uncle man nephew or cousin
I'm the 1 like Tracy McGrady, play wit me or play me
Make me a man or make me your baby (Luv me baby)
Spoil me mama, back rub oil me mama
When I'm left over aluminum, foil me mama
I'mma be therre when you wake up hungry
You can call me your homie
I'mma be therre when you straight up lonely (Luv me baby)
And I ain't tryin' to get mushy ya dig?
And all pushy ya dig? I just like the fact ya tushy is big
Can I touch it, touch it? maybe caress it and rub it?
Take advantage of it, show me your private booty in public (Luv me baby)
You actin fresh this way like "But guess"
But really you princess cut, invisible set
The credible sex, way way ahead of the rest
Best personality, face, booty and chest

Verse 3 [Murphy Lee]
I need an erryday girl, an all day provider
Don't matter if I'm behind her, as long as I'm inside her
She be wit it and I don't wanna be commited
As long as I don't forget it, the night after I hit it
She cool mayn, neva disrespectin' me
As long as I can help her wit a few Bill Belamys
And she ain't even tellin' me I'm the only dertty she dig
And if she do I'mma tell em how we better off bein friends
