[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen (ladies and gentlemen) gentleman...
You are tune in to the very best
So beautiful, Jazzy Phizzle, Chris Brown lets go

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Well, I bet I couldn't look more bolder
Hold her as we dip into my solar
Call me Ford baby, I explore her
This navigator, you don't want like Lincoln
Black Bentley, you look better in a pink one
She smoking and I'm about to steam one
Let's skip and make love on Venus
Baby the ball's in your court like Serenus
Make me jump over that net between us
And let nothing get between us
We too hot, only sweat between us

[Chorus]
Girl you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got
Girl you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got
You got 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got
Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got
You got it, gimme whatcha got
You got it, girl

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
That's it baby girl, put it on my zipper
We ain't in the club but I still wanna tip her
You should be my misses, I can be your mister
Put me on deck shorty, I could be your skipper

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll give you a kiss for every time you make me smile
I'll give you a thousand, if you stay a little while
Longer and it's getting stronger
The feeling that I got for you shorty, do what it do

[Chorus]
Girl you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got
Girl you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got
You got 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got
Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got
You got it, gimme whatcha got
You got it, girl

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Exit now I got a place where we can go
Back seat action, sunroof for deuce
And the windows tinted so nobody could look in
Put it in gear and burn out with me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll give you a kiss for every time you make me smile
I'll give you a thousand, if you stay a little while
Longer and it's getting stronger
The feeling that I got for you shorty, do what it do

[Chorus]
Girl you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got
Girl you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got
You got 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got
Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got
You got it, gimme whatcha got
You got it, girl

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Girl, you the fliest thing that I've seen and I'm tryna get with you
Girl, girl you're on fire and I know that you're burning hot
Shorty you're burning hot and I'm talking to you
I'mma set you on fire and all I do is think about you, yeah

[Chorus]
Girl you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got
Girl you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got
You got 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got
Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got
You got it, gimme whatcha got
You got it, girl
Girl you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got
Heat up like summer, gimme whatcha got
Girl you know what you're doing, gimme whatcha got
You got 28's on the Hummer, gimme whatcha got
Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got
You got it, gimme whatcha got
You got it, girl
