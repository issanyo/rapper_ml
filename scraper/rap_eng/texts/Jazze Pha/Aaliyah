[Intro]
I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

[Hook]
I don't wanna be without you
Fuck around and sleep without you
I don't wanna go
Lord knows I just can't be alone
I don't wanna be
Fuck around and sleep
You know that I can't go
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
You know I can't be by myself
Thinking 'bout you with someone else
Feels like no one knows how I feel
Now let me know this shit is real
No waste no time on it, even with the way it feels
No waste no time on it, you know that you can keep it one hundred in here
Now don't be afraid to keep it honest girl
But don't leave cause you know that I want you girl to want me
I don't wanna be alone
You know that no one fuck you like I do
Nobody love you, touch you like I do
It ain't my first time with you
But I'm gon' show you what I do

[Bridge]
Start your marks and get ready
'Cause I'm down if you let me
You know I don't wanna waste time
But I don't wanna be in love

[Hook]
I don't wanna be without you
Fuck around and sleep without you
I don't wanna go
Lord knows I just can't be alone
I don't wanna be without you
Fuck around and sleep without you
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 2]
Now when I think back
Lot of memories that you bring back
Girl, we had a love so ever lasting
Girl I wanted to give you my last name
You gotta see the way I see it
I could be here keeping secrets
But I feel this thing between us
And I don't wanna let it go

[Outro]
Start your marks and get ready
'Cause I'm down if you let me
You know I don't wanna waste time
But I don't wanna be in love
