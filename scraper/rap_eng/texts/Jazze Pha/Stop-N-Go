Please rise for the president of the South
And all hail to the chief with them diamond teeth in his mouth
Make way (way) Big Dick Chaney is 'bout to enter
King committee's in session (session) but first on the agenda
Bend the corner on them fo's, 'Llac turnin on them Vouges
One time for the haters (haters) two times for the hoes
I suppose it's only right for me to grip up on the cherry (cherry)
Oak wood wheel while I'm drippin cranberry (berry)
And very few have accomplished what we have achieved
Without a rabbit out of a hat or a trick up the sleeve (trick up the sleeve)
I got a steady hand (hand) and a steady flow (flow)
So on your mark, get set (set) ready go (go)
You already know

Swishers and dank and pourin' up big drank (drank)
Hundred thousand dollars in my grown set link (link)

You gon' go crazy nigga tryna' count my money (money)
I came from the bottom they hate me like I'm a Saddam (Saddam)
198 in a spur house in Nevada

Got my paper pimpin' through Cerwin Vegas nigga
Let me show you how we keep the parkin' lot on fire (on fire)
Full kit, on my shit 26 inch tiiiiires! (tires)

Keep a bad yellow bitch cause my dick feel good
When you see us in the hood nigga

Ladies and gentlemen!
Dope man, yay and the dro in the drought (whoa)
Pull up in the spot with the brains blowed out (heyyyy!)
Wheels cost a whip (whip) whip cost a house (house)
UGK and Jazze Pha show up and show out (OOOOH-WEE!)
She wanna chill with the crew
Kick it in the crib on the hill with the view
You know you wanna holla, what it is what it do
She love me for my old school drops and my cool
Cause my shit be the truth (whoa!)
The wheels never pause (ohh!)
Counter-clockwise when I +SKERRRRRRT+ on 'em all
And when she fall through and see the plaques on the wall
She'll probably call a couple friends, shit call 'em all
Down come the drawers - oh boy! (OOOH-WEE!)
