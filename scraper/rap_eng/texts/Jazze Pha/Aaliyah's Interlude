[Verse]
I just touched down
Quarter after two
And I know it's late
But I'm calling you
Trying to figure if I
Can
Come
See
You (You, can I come see you baby)
And I know you're sleep
But you're on my mind
And I'm wide awake
And I wanna stop by
So can you get up
Get out
Of the bed
'Cause I wanna
(See you) See you
And I, been wondering

[Chorus]
Can I come over (Can I)
Come over (Stop by)
Can I come over (To see you)
Come over (Tonight)
Can I come over (Can I)
Come over (Get with you)
Come over (Just wanna, be with you)
Can I come over (Can I)
Come over (Stop by)
Can I come over (To see you)
Come over (Tonight)
Can I come over (Can I)
Come over (Get with you)
Come over (Just wanna, be with you oh)

[Bridge]
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing
Tempt me, drive me
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It's yours entirely

[Outro]
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling, all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling, all day long
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
