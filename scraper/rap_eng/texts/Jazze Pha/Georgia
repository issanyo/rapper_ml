I'm feeling like a billionare
What are those?
Those are Polos
I don't know?
If love exist, people come and go
Why they hate?

Why they hate?
I don't knooow?

How to move
So, all the shade don't get on ya
Why they hate?
I don't knoooow?
Why they hate?

[Verse 1]
I from GA
The peach state
For Pete sake
Whether he hate
Or she hate
I'mma get paid
Big house
Nice whip
With the shrimp plate
Eat great
Light's out
I'mma sleep great
I don't understand why they on us (why they on us)
Getting paid is part of my culture
And I'm a true definition of a sculpture (of a sculpture)
And i don't need your money, aye hol' up
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

Diamonds always on VS
Money all over the place
And I'm riding round in my coupe

Riding round, that's your boo? Get out my way

Round and round and we go

(Yeah, Yeah) I need my money upfront
Oh (yep)
Ain't got no time for no penny pinching, no limit
Block 'em out, don't worry 'bout what nobody say
They say whip it and design, now I can't worry (Yeah, I know)
And I wear Gucci fan, then ride it on my wheels (know you see it)
Now I'm riding round in my coupe
People looking like, "Oooh"
Wanna see you get mula everyday

Push 'em to side off me
Then, I hit 'em with success, ooh wee
Had to cop that new Bent-u-ley (It go)
Boom, boom, boom in my truck

Look to mirror, 'cause I'm gorgeous
I used couldn't pay my rent, but now I can afford it
