Hey girl….(hey girl, hey girl)
Let's go have some drinks!
Apple Martinis, Cosmopolitans, Pina Coladas…I got a lot of dollars!

You just got off from work, got on your business skirt
And your high heels…( high heels)
Go home and change your clothes, I'll meet you at the door
Excuse me miss, but don't you wanna go?

Hey girl….(hey girl, hey girl)
Let's go have some drinks!
Apple Martinis, Cosmopolitans, Pina Coladas…I got a lot of dollars!
Hey girl….(hey girl, hey girl)

Put on my Slip-n-slides, cause we're stepping out tonight
You're so grown girl…(You're so grown)
And this one's a classic shorty, reach out and grab somebody
Excuse me miss, but I just have to know

Hey girl….(hey girl, hey girl)
Let's go have some drinks!
Apple Martinis, Cosmopolitans, Pina Coladas…I got a lot of dollars!
Hey girl….(hey girl, hey girl)

Ladies, it's good to see you laughing
Love is in the air, you all look smashing
Silhouettes in every shape form and fashion
Like what's happening just asking for some action!
So since we're acting we'll do a lap then
Raise your glasses, shake your asses
Here's to the good times, tonight is kinda special
Now holla at me if I can help ya…

They call me Phizaleezy, I got a bunch of breezies
And when I come around they never wanna leave me
See I'm the kind of fellow, ice in every letter
Here's a toast to you girl, get to know me better
Now since the hour's happy, gone and cognac me!
Certified playboy known for acting badly
And since I'm feeling cahsy, double up your daiquiris
You looking tipsy girl, come spend the night with Jazzy!
