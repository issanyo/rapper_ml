You may look at me and think that I'm

Sexy, independent, down to spend it type that's gettin his dough
I'm not bein too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it

[Chorus]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Maybe cuz I talk about it
Lookin for the goodies
Keep on lookin cuz they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh

Just because you drive a Benz

And still I'm sexy, independent

You think your slike, tryna hit
But I'm not dumb

Maybe cuz I talk about it
Lookin for the goodies
Keep on lookin cuz they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
You're way too hot to keep ya goodies on lock
Call me the locksmith, I got the key to that box
I wanna see you next to me in that drop

Maybe in Jamaica poppin bottles on the Yacht
Then dock it in Miami grand hustle don't stop
Give it to me cuz you wanna, I ain't workin for it

You think I'm hurting for it?

[Verse 4 - Ciara]
You're insuating that I'm hot

[Chorus]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it

Keep on lookin cuz they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Maybe cuz I talk about it
Lookin for the goodies
Keep on lookin cuz they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh
