WE GOT THIS HERE

[Qua Bo Gold]
Every since I could remember, I was a lil' ol' boy
I was ghetto natural baby, I never let em' steal my joy
Even though I had lonely days, I know he heard my praise
I didn't even know which way but yet I come all this way
I'm from red Claymore, I'm from Blessing Brook
I represent all them hood, I backwoods
Might not of been sure baby but I'm ridin' pure baby
I know if I have faith and guard maybe I can endure baby
I don't worry about facin' haters, I breaks em' off my dear
I put it on noon for life, I say we gots this here

Guess what we hot this year and you are not this year
Man you can't stop this here, first week in the number slot this year
Got shit on lock this year, Glock gon' go pop this year
Candy toys gon' drop this year, niggas left in a maze lost this year
A pimp current gon' pop this here, the Impala don't stop this year
Ya girlfriend gon' cut this year, runnin' all up in them guts this year
We got this here, here
Y'all motherfuckers ain't ready, cut em' with the machete
Comin' down here nigga, drop top Chevy
Y'all ain't ready to mob with real heavy
Jazze Pha, the one ya love to hate
All in ya face with a slap this year
Give a fuck nigga who ya with
Nigga back on up, we got this here

The man right chea'
When I come up in this bitch ya can't stand right chea'
It's gettin' ugly, these niggas gettin' itchy
These bitches gettin' funky, it's gettin' real out chea'
Sick and tired of these niggas with the dumb shit, fuck shit
Y'all talk a whole lot of shit
But when I catch ya in the street then ya face off top
Like a man you a whole lot of bitch
I got this here
Keep ya hand out my pocket or get shot this year
Let the Glock cock, snap
Watch a nigga get knocked back
Look, been about this here
I come in this bitch gully
People that smilin' stand up and rushin' the alley
And if ya prevaily
I'm bustin' they ass and bitch ya know it's there
