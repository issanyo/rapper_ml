[Lil Jon]
I was deep in the cut at 559
Lookin' at this girl, I was also fine
Wassup lil redbone?
Just in tights and her hair bun was
Around her neck
She was shakin' that thang and gettin' wet
I've bought her a Hennessy
She was tight to death, so you know that freakin' me
Said, I gotta caught her
So I walked up to her and I said wassup, boo
How you doin'? You the girl I've been pursuin'
All night long!
So would you be like a dog and get this bone
And as we rolled out, I've sang this song

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'

[Lil Bo]
Well this Lil Bo in the house for the freak show
So bend over and touch your toe, yeah
Now spank them titties
Cause it felt like me wanna see you breath
In and out, just like that
I ain't curious but I killed the cat
[?] off from head to toe
Girl let me see you work that pole
Set the thang with a fat kitty cat
And I love the way you work it
From the front to the back
So girl, no need to front
Cause you got what I need and you know what I want Ain't no time for the wine & dine
Me and you at the crib doin' 69, girl
Freak some, freak some, freak some, freak some

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'

[Bridge: Jazze Pha]
Freak a lil' sum' for the low-low, here we go yo
On the dancefloor
Freak a lil' sum' for your partner, in the backseat
On the down low
Freak a lil' sum' for the low-low, here we go yo
On the dancefloor
Freak a lil' sum' for your partner

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'

[Big Sam]
Peepin' up at the club, left hand on the wheel
Right hand on the 5 out of wood, that's real
Checked in our spot, the freak, drop top Mustang with a [?]
Start thinkin' man I wanna freak
I caught eye contact and it gotta mean
Walked over a minute later, what it is
Spent a lil' [?] we back at the crib
We two across of that hill, see she's all over me
Doing things you won't believe
She got down on her knees
Cause seen a player flossin' of on them D's
So now it's on, let's have them [?] for the moan and groan

[Hook: Jazze Pha] + Adlibs
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'
Shawty freak a lil' sum'

[Outro: Jazze Pha]
Come on let's ride, let's ride
I know you wanna roll
Shawty freak a lil' sumtin' for me
Shawty, shawty, yeah, yeah
Go freak a lil' sum' for me
Way down, on the down-low
Nobody's gotta know
Freak a lil' sumtin', freak a lil' sumtin'
Freak a lil' sumtin', freak a lil' sumtin'
Yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
Sumtin' for me
