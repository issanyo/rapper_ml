[Intro:]
Hennessy (see)
Doo wear?
Stay with me (me)
And I know just where I need to be (be)
And I'm on my way back to knock on your door
After the club [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Ooooohhh ohh Ooooohhh
You can't even lie
Wait a minute
You'd be gone
Or you'd be spinnin'
Like a merry-go-round
You know I'm a fool off that Henny
Guess I never knew my limit
I'm just trying to get by... yeah, yeaaaah
It's been kinda hard for a minute
This job, this business
It'll tear you down... yeah
You're the only one in my life
Only one that brings me peace, yeah

[Hook:]
Niggas been passin' me drinks all night
I don't wanna drink no more - I'm right (and I know I'm right)
Only thing left to do is cooome seeeee yoooou (girl, I'm on my waaayyy)

[Chorus:]
Baby after the club
Girl, I'll be what you want
Hennessy in my cup
There ain't time to front, no baby
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, yeah

Baby after the club
Girl, I got what you want
Hennessy in my cup
There ain't time to front, no baby
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, yeah

[Verse 2:]
Ooooohhh ohh Ooooohhh
Girl, I'll be at your door, in a minute
I done had one too many
Unfit to drive
At first, I had to take me a minute
And gather up my senses
I don't wanna catch a D.U.I. (Yeaaahhh)
I just seen a lot of women in the club
Nothing can give no love (No, no, no)
You're the only woman in my life
The only one I wanna ride (oohh, oooooh)

[Hook:]
Niggas been passin' me drinks all night
I don't wanna drink no more - I'm right (I don't wanna drink no more baby)
Only thing left to do is come see you (Yeah, I'm on my waaayyyyyy)

[Chorus:]
Baby after the club
Girl, I'll be what you want
Hennessy in my cup
There ain't time to front, no baby
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, yeah

Baby after the club
Girl, I got what you want
Hennessy in my cup
There ain't time to front, no baby
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, yeah

[Bridge:]
Girl, I've been thinking like
Don't wanna come off like no freak
But I'm feeling like
You've got me down around my knees
Your can-cut-stops-lights-nigga-playa-act-right
When I leave the club, I'm on my way [x2]

[Chorus:]
Baby after the club
Girl, I'll be what you want
Hennessy in my cup
There ain't time to front, no baby
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, yeah

Baby after the club
Girl, I got what you want
Hennessy in my cup
There ain't time to front, no baby
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, yeah

[Outro:]
Hennessy (see) (girl, that Hennessy)
Stay with me (me) (doing that stang on me)
Where I need to be (be) (I know what I need)
And I'm on my way back to knock on your door
After the club

Hennessy (see)
Doo wear?
Stay with me (me)
And I know just where I need to be (be)
And I'm on my way back to knock on your door
After the club
