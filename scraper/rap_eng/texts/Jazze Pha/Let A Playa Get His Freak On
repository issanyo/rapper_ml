I'll make it hot like a wet dream

Strawberries, hot fudge baby, whipped cream

We in the shower for one hour, it's a freaky scene

I'll lick you from your head to your toe

Get you squeaky clean, nah mean?

1 - Let a playa get his freak on

'cause you're bringing out the freak in me

Hurry up 'cause I'mma be gone

But I can satisfy your fantasy

Just let a playa get his freak on

'cause you're bringing out the freak in me

Hurry up 'cause I'mma be gone

But I can satisfy your fantasy

Girl, I like just what you're givin' me

(I like what you're giving me)

I can satisfy your fantasies

(You know I can do it)

If you want my lovin', here it is

(It's yours)

I got so much love I really want to give

(Come on)

Anything that you want I'll give it to you

Anything that you need I'm your dreams come true

If you want my lovin' baby, here it is

Pimp and show, light and easy but it's all I can give

Repeat 1

Tell me baby do you like what you see?

(I know you like what you see, baby)

I can satisfy your every need

(Here, take it baby)

You should know by now that I like to beg

(Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Baby girl, you don't have to be afraid

When we make good lovin' girl, I'll make you scream

You can do that thing girl, you know what I mean

If you want my lovin' baby, here it is

Pimp and show, light and easy, but it's all I can give

Repeat 1

(Jazze Pha)

How ya like it baby, front to back

I make you dizzy hittin' switches

Getting busy in my Cadillac

I know you wanna get your freak on, baby girl

Come take a trip with LSG all around the world

Hear my chips go, hear my whips roll

Got the black stretch Hummer on the stage at the show

So how ya feel? I'm all true like Alexander O'Neill

With a hundred and fifty percent freak appeal

I'll work you right, make ya sweat, pop goes your mind

Episode, bang it like nickle-plated nine

Free your conscience baby, relax your mind

You better get yours (why?) 'cause I'mma get mine

I'll make it hot like the kitchen

Watchin' my gravey thicken

Noon time, Jazze Pha

You can't vanish, drop a slick one

So if you see a cutie on the floor

Get wondering

Maybe later on tonight, she get her freaks on

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

Bringing out the freak in me

Satisfy your fantasies

Girl you make me freaky deaky, freaky deaky

Repeat 1 until fade
