[Cap.One]
Yo, now eva since I got a record deal
Niggas and bitches been in my crib
Tryin to kick it wit a nigga jho
But I been peepin da game
And how to be scopin da reigns
Sittin on thangs
And whippin thru the city slow
Even a ??? hoes
Be tryin to get a piece of da don
Tellin me she can get me sprung (whassup shortie)
And be peepin my song
She wanna creep on da phone and
Freak on da ???
Tellin me to hit it when her people ain't home
I got game for hoes and major dough
Cause got a chick got in a minute like what da fuck is you pagin fo'
Steady tellin me that you in love and shit

If you break it, you replace it ho

[Cap.One]
Everybody wanna live dat thug nigga life
Talk plenty shit while dey holdin da dice
Chain off da hook, da Roll fulla ice
Nigga bought two when they sold me da price
And dis hoes, I got'em by da dozen, love 'em
The way they be fiendin for me to bugg 'em, touch 'em
Me and my nigga be in da mall ready to ball
Lyin to dis broads sayin we cousins, buggin
Still, rappin like a nigga need a deal
Can't stop till I get my hands on a mill
Won't stop till dem niggas know who da real
Bust shots dead at dem niggas wit da steel
And its on, spit it for my niggas back at home

SouthSide till dem niggas call me da throne
So baby let me take you through the eyes of a don
Now if you wanna bone

Who take of business and get to lovin you tight ( In yo life )
