You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

[Verse One: Cee-Lo]
See when we ride through, we let them see it from the side view
Slow and even so you know no one denied you
The parking lot look like these niggas like to ride too
They didn't win but I must admit they tried to
Look like we talked up, when we walked up
And when we walked in, money talk then
The bar was bought then, we couldn't be caught then
I see you looking lil' girl, let's go get lost then
Every so often out on and off them (I wanna go shit and you know this)
Well is there anyone else that you could go with
Cool run it back OK, see if she'll play wit Pha

[Hook]
You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide!

[Verse Two: T.I.]
'Bout ten mo minuets and I'm ready to ride
I got ten mo bitches I'mma fit up inside
This suburban or Excursion or whatever I ride
I bet it's chrome on the wire, vogue on the tire
T.I.P. refer to me as your majesty or sire
Higher then the rest, Italian drop dead fresh
So much say what I feel with southern finesse
So debonair if he dare bet he got best dressed
Full length mink, gator belt gator vest including shoes
A ten thousand dollar outfit bitch
Yes, dude he dress to impress
A bitch enough to make her want to give me her dress
Blessed with the gift of gab to get gals
Hot enough to hit they pals so get down
You looking good enough to come give me a kiss now
Get a room at the Swiss big as a beach house

[Hook]
You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

[Verse Three: Cee-Lo]
You're lookin nice. Hell, let's toast to the broken ice
We've seen each other once and already we've spoken twice
So stay or at the most a moment longer to hear me say
I really did miss you the last time that you went away
I'm serious, I must have you, I won't waste your time
And have you wishin' that somehow you could replace the time
I don't do any magic tricks to try and make the mind
I just convinced that the reality is that you have to race the time
She said "You a playa ain't you, could have what you want can't you"
I replied that I'm also an artist baby I could paint you
In the frame and I don't try hard to not be the same
So she knew she was gon' come before she came

[Hook]
You the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one

Cuz you the one girl, you the one girl
You the one girl, you the one girl
Put your finger in the air if you the one girl
Raw, Raw, Raw, Raw-hide!(Girl did you know that ahh...)

[Cee-Lo]
It's our privilege, to have had this conversation
It's our privilege, and to have had this relation
It's our privilege, I been searching all evening
For somebody who can and finally sent me the one
It's our privilege, to have made you laugh
It's our privilege, and to have crossed your path
It's our privilege, your the star yes you are
Can have your autograph cuz you lookin like the one
It's our privilege, to have seen your face
It's our privilege, and I bet you taste so good, let's get one thing understood
I'll be good yes I would, especially for the one
It's our privilege, let have a head-on collision
It's our privilege, girl you made the right decision
It's our privilege, (laughing)
