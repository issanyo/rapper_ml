[Intro: The D.O.C.]
See, it ain't easy
But it's necessary
So we gon' do this in slow motion
Cause they say slow motion is better than no motion
I'm back up in this motherfucker with my nigga Six2
Young Cadillac Seville the Mack
Me? Just call me DOC
The Mack Seville. tell 'em what the bidness is, my nigga

[Verse 1: Cadillac Seville]
Imagine a young man saggin' who attract attractive women
A slap (damn!)
Just so happens that his Mac is converted to rappin'
His satisfaction when he serves up his lyrical tactics
Pervin' on, bumpy, place to place, an expert with masters
More scandal than when the deacon's wife flirts with the pastor
Hesitate when you see his face cause he's verbally badder
Chokin' on herb as he swerves in a burgundy track or two
Was on the curb, he can't turn but he's twerkin' the bastard
Free legendary and the words that he spoke
Young black with a skinny frame, got plenty game in him though
True trouble, some take and touchin' intended to turn him out
Willin' to work his words, roll the weed and burn it out
Inhale the herb (wait)
Then regurgitate what I've learned about
I'm the lyricist from the south with that mouth that you've heard about (that's right)
Walk in the club with clout, but before I pull my drink
Real foes, seven roads, hoe to hoe, shoulder lean
Now I do freaks for two weeks
Consume weed to do these
In two months (a new me!)
You too, Chron (ooh-wee!)
Truly abnormal, like the Elephant Man and Hannibal
I'm not an animal
Tell em again, shit!

[Hook: Six2]
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Take it from a nigga who know
Get ya money while you can, though
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Proceed to keep it real and get ya Dollar Dollar bills
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Take it from a nigga who know
Get ya money while you can, though
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Proceed to keep it real and get ya Dollar Dollar bills

[Verse 2: Six2]
Man you know just how the game goes
I chase paper and run game on hoes, playboy
I'm only after makin' major grip
And if she shove me on my ends
I gots to check that bitch
See pimpin' ain't easy but the shit don't stop
And y'all know I gots to have my little ol' ends above the top
(who are you?) Mr. paper chaser (that's right), the gold getter
(what you do?)
I dare the bitch to act a fool cause I'm a hoe hitter
Willie D told me to let these hoes be hoes
Not sellin' out, now none of my homies are buyin' bitches no clothes
Can't be seen with punk hoes and punch those that popper those
I got hoes, you never see me jock hoes
Hold what you got hoe, I want three soft tacos
My regal in in the shapos
I'm rollin' in vatos
The only thing to it is to hit it and scram, see?
Playboys'll be playboys god damn me

[Hook: Six2]
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Take it from a nigga who know
Get ya money while you can, though
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Proceed to keep it real and get ya Dollar Dollar bills
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Take it from a nigga who know
Get ya money while you can, though
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Proceed to keep it real and get ya Dollar Dollar bills

[Verse 3: The D.O.C.]
It's like cool water
Big rocks like you brought us
Some where by Carter
Or see me rollin' with ya daughter
(What they call you, man?)
She callin' me a player, shot-caller, a follow
Baby, not just a player, I'm a starter
Like Steve Atwater
Sue for that (word)
Off the hook, look
That zooter bank, six shooter
Fools
I know y'all think y'all ready
But just like that, I'll fuck you young niggas' asses up
(what you say?)
I'm sayin', don't never do that (that's right)
Don't never think my shit ain't phat motherfucker (motherfucker) where your stones at?
Where your tight-ass pussy rich red bones at?
(what you got?) I got all that cause I deliver up dem Platinum Dats (that's right)
Funny thing is everybody knows that (how you feel?)
I'm crunk up in this bitch like one of my hoes at
Same frown, same clown, same perception of that ghetto shit with DO lady hoes
Damn

[Hook: Six2]
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Take it from a nigga who know
Get ya money while you can, though
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Proceed to keep it real and get ya Dollar Dollar bills
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Take it from a nigga who know
Get ya money while you can, though
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Proceed to keep it real and get ya Dollar Dollar bills
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Take it from a nigga who know
Get ya money while you can, though
Pimpin' ain't easy, playboy
Proceed to keep it real and get ya Dollar Dollar bills

[Outro: The D.O.C.]
So there it is
Now the whole world know how hard it is to pimp these bitches
Keep 'em all under one umbrella, you understand me?
Ain't no wild stallions runnin' out their stable
This is Silverback, we control that and these hoes know that, yeah
So join us next time while we, uh, snatch a batch out your brain with this game, bitches
Comin' from The D.O.C., Erotic, Six2, U.P.-T.I.G.H.T., Cadillac Seville The Mack, Organized, Jazze Pha, El Dorado
My Silverback family
Pimpin' ain't easy
But somebody gotta do it
You know?
