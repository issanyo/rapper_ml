Rick Rizzle

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Candy all in the paint, rims deep in the dirt
Got a car full of work, nigga pockets full of herb
Choppa on the front seat, suck it if you want beef
I'm in Dade County, I'm the mayor you can come see
Lookie here, I'm well known, what you say? I'm well known
Kush by the elbow, I love when it smell strong
Other side of the bridge, niggas die just to live
You want a beach, don't sleep .45 to ya wig
Represent Carol City, Dirty South ride with me
M-I-Yayo on the map, now it's my city
Pullin' out the 7 trey, every other day
Got 'bout 40 in it, hit ya hoe fo' 40 minutes

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Pull up on them 24's, while I'm leanin' on them doors
And I'm lettin' suckers know, that I get it fo' da low
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
Pull up in that white on white, know you wonder what it's like
Know you wonder what's the price, ain't nothin' to a boss
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Riders know how I does, neighborhood full of thugs
Everybody sellin' drugs, task force duckin' us
Load up the big guns, got so many, which one?
Everybody get to buy a house when the bricks come
Ho's know my whole name, famous for cocaine
Yea I'm out the blow game, but I'm 'bout to blow mane
Rick Rizzle clockin' dough, inventory gotta go
If a nigga want it hard, cook it like I'm papa doughs
Fat boy super cool, got something you can move
When I did what I do, she got like a swimmin' pool
Oh boy real wet, so boy hell yea
I'm a millionaire, where I'm goin' I ain't there yet

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Pull up on them 24's, while I'm leanin' on them doors
And I'm lettin' suckers know, that I get it fo' da low
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
Pull up in that white on white, know you wonder what it's like
Know you wonder what's the price, ain't nothin' to a boss
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Go on let ya top down, fuck it blow a couple grand
Treat her like an animal, make her do a hand stand
Club Rolex, you can stunt yo
I stood on a Rolex, smokin' on a blunt ho' (Ross)
I'm heavy mayne, off in this Chevy game
Dip it in the pretty paint, chromed out everything
Take it back to the block, Triple C across the top
In an old school motor brand new out the box
Got 'bout a hundred killas, runnin' with a hundred niggas
Tell it there to ya face, don't nobody want it with us
Niggas dead broke broke, they better shake it off
Skycap ass niggas, mad that we takin' off (Ross)

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Pull up on them 24's, while I'm leanin' on them doors
And I'm lettin' suckers know, that I get it fo' da low
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
Pull up in that white on white, know you wonder what it's like
Know you wonder what's the price, ain't nothin' to a boss
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
Pull up on them 24's, while I'm leanin' on them doors
And I'm lettin' suckers know, that I get it fo' da low
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
Pull up in that white on white, know you wonder what it's like
Know you wonder what's the price, ain't nothin' to a boss
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
