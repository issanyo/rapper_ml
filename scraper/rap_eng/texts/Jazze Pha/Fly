(feat. Jazze Pha)

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
But I know somebody fly who wants to come by and take off all her clothes and freak me for free
But I know somebody fly who loves to come by take off all her clothes and freak me for free

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I know the truth baby girl you be sick of making love
You rather get clubbed by a South Side thug
No kiss no hug no going to the club
No talking on the phone but turn that ass up
No money in the bank but we can't blow the bank
Come lay in my lap let me feel what your thinking
Yeah ya you do look good, but the trick I ain't
Let me shake that ass, girl put me in the pain (put me in the pain)
Let me weigh it in a pinch
Let me long drop shot and watch it all in the seat
Jump back in the back and I'm out in the morning
Leave yo body wet girl drippin and pourin

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
I know somebody fly who wants to come by and take off all her clothes and freak me for free
And I know somebody fly who loves to come by take off all her clothes and freak me for free

[Verse 2: David Banner]
I know you see me watching girl don't trip go grab your coat on the rack and let's dip - your a grown ass woman don't play no games - don't lie to yourself let's leave these lames - leave these lames. Let's dip in the bed nobody gots to know get lost in the [? ] - let's fall out of control - get lost in the [? ] but me I get [? ] I got cash but now I want sex - want sex - but you can leave with a [? ] or an autograph copy of my song like a pimp - or a gum or a mint whatever you need. But your boy can't get no cheese

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
I know somebody fly who wants to come by and take off all her clothes and freak me for free
And I know somebody fly who loves to come by take off all her clothes and freak me for free

[Short Verse 1:]
Let me come by just [? ] Fix a plate of food and I ate it - just did - fixing on the pepper mill she's got her own grill

[Hook:]
I know somebody fly who wants to come by and take off all her clothes

[Short Verse 2:]
And lay down on the floor - she's a queen but she like it when I treat her like a hoe - [? ] make her good make her - make her say scream no - pull her hair it's good and straight to the door - no talk we keep it on the low

[Hook:]
I know somebody fly who wants to come by and take off all her clothes and freak me for free
And I know somebody fly who loves to come by take off all her clothes and freak me for free
Fly - take off all her clothes and freak me for free
