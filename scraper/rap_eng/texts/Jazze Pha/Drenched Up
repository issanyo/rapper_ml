Verse 1
Drenched up, drenched up, drenched up I got too much sauce
Wavy, wavy, wavy they can’t rinse me off
Stop at every store when I go to the mall
No my name ain’t Lonzo but you know I ball
If you check the gram we got a mil-li-on
If you ask my fans they say we pop-u-lar
Please don’t call us rappers we are real rock stars
When I hit them folks my bank account go up (up)

Prehook
(Dat Way)
Pull up, Pull up Vroom, Vroom
Whip it, Whip it, Zoom, Zoom
Gettin' checks mmhmmm
Got the sauce mmhmmm
Drench god when we walk in
Getting lit with the GloTwinz
Turn up x3 (huh)
Drenched Up x3  (Dat way)

Chorus x2
Drenched up x4
I stay drenched up (drenched up)
I done glowed up
Drippin sauce drenched up (drenched up)
Drenched up x4
I stay drenched up (drenched up)
Drippin way too much sauce shawty I stay drenched up

Verse 2
Lit, lit, lit it’s a "lituation"
Ain’t my birthday but I gotta get my cake up
Working so hard we don’t vacation
Controlling the game like it’s PlayStation
We go in
We The GloTwinz and we dancing like we Jacksons
Louis belt Gucci shoes
Getting money paying dues
Put my Momma in a crib
Give her, give her jimmy choo’s
GloTwinz never losing
Don’t you know imma nuisance
Getting money like Bruce Wayne
Run the check up like I’m hussan

Prehook
Pull up, Pull up Vroom, Vroom
Whip it, Whip it, Zoom, Zoom
Gettin' checks mmhmmm
Got the sauce mmhmmm
Drench god when we walk in
Getting lit with the GloTwinz
Turn up x3 (huh)
Drenched Up x3  (Dat way)

Chorus x2
Drenched up x4
I stay drenched up  (drenched up)
I done glowed up
Drippin sauce drenched up (drenched up)
Drenched up x4
I stay drenched up (drenched up)
Drippin way too much sauce shawty I stay drenched up

Bridge
When I pull up in the Foreign
All the shawties be like pimping where you going
Skrt Skrt see you shining you be glowing
Just like candy paint I know you see me glowing
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
When I pull up in the Foreign
All the shawties be like pimping where you going
Skrt Skrt see you shining you be glowing
Just like candy paint I know you see me glowing
(Yeah, yeah, Drenched Up)

Chorus x2
Drenched up x4
I stay drenched up (drenched up)
I done glowed up
Drippin sauce drenched up (drenched up)
Drenched up x4
I stay drenched up (drenched up)
Drippin way too much sauce shawty I stay drenched up
