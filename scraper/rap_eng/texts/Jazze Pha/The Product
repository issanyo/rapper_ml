[Verse 1]
Yo nigga what you need? Bitches what you need
Cause I got the dope shit, give it to the fiends
And I got the loud, no seeds, no sticks
So hoes hit me up if you think you need a fix
I'm a downtown nigga, new kid on the block
So if you need the crack then come and get the rock
I'mma get you high, take you to the top
If you try to fall in love I'mma make your heart stop
Cause baby I ain't with it, I mean you can get it
But no handcuffs, I just gotta quit it
If you got the good I can put you on parole
But I'mma let you know I don't really trust hoes
I hate fake ass niggas who ain't about cash
And I hate snitches, don't even gotta ask
I'm getting to the money even if I got a mask on
Nigga gotta live gotta get the racks up

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen, players and pimps
And all of y'all who love lobster and shrimp
This is the product
Hold on to your motherfucking daughter
Super fly ladies and the gorgeous girls
Take you for a trip all around the world
This is the product
Hold on to your motherfucking daughter
