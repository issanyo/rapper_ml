[Intro: Six2]
Number 1's, and Mr. Two Face, Bitch Killa
You know I've been known to get beside myself at times

[Verse 1: Six2]
It was a cold dark stormy night, similar to this one
The city stood still, and he was dressed to kill
Sportin' dickeys, and in Hi-Tec boots, picture that
Plus he muggin' the mean way, in the green bay, starter jacket and hat
What's goin' on in the city after dark, you never know let the story unfold
One of these lost souls was a female (whats up?)
Let me tell what had happened, drop the low down by detail
The bitch wore the game out, simple as that
I guess ya'll still don't know that you can't trust no ho
I'm crawlin' down berry, made a right on miller
What was it, 1996 when Two Face became the bitch killa?
That's around the time I straight said fuck it
Last night on the news, they say a bitch was abducted
The ho' was found duct taped, that I know
They sexually abused her, and cut her thoroughly

[Hook 1: Six2 & U.P.-T.I.G.H.T.]
What would you do, if Two Face came to pop ya? (the heat of the moment)
Number one component, pain got ya, (the police can't stop ya)
The church can't either, D-O-N Fort Worth, that's where I leave ya
What would you do, if Two Face came to pop ya? (the heat of the moment)
Number one component, pain got ya, (the police can't stop ya)
The church can't either, in the streets of 8-1-G, is where I leave ya

[Verse 2: U.P.-T.I.G.H.T.]
I went to school wit' him, shot pool wit' him, acted a fool wit him
Drunk a brew wit' him, who'd ever know that I'd be losin' him?
Never hung around with street thugs, or sold drugs
Still he caught 3 or 4 slugs, and landed in the mud
Face down, his mother came I seen her breakdown
From kilos, to OG's, when bullets hit the sleeve
Of his jacket, super magnetic, I'm never gone forget it
The pain embedded, retaliation is not suggested
Parental advisory, I want my mood the child provide me
Took him inside, ambulance arrived to get his body
Jumped in the 88, travelin' doin' 95 or better
Time to recover his Beretta, slipped in my sweater
Down to do whatever, buffalo soldier
Leather seats in the Oldsmobile feel like a sofa
Gun in my jeans, like they the holster
Comin' close to mental malfunction, continue punchin' the gas
Wonderin' today is gone be his last
Don't even ask if I'm mad, got a ski mask
In my overnight bag in the trunk underneath the pump
In case I need to dump, rather beat the punk with bare hands
Aggravated glossy eyed, I'm on the highway in a trance
Hit the service road, runnin' through lights, like they were all green
The thought of him in a pine box was all I seen
Was it over green or a case of mistaken identity
Either way now they my enemies, I cut the car

[Hook 2: U.P.-T.I.G.H.T. & Six2]
What would you do if someone shot ya main partner, (the heat of the moment)
Number one component, pain got ya, (the police can't stop ya)
The church can't either, puttin' in work for Dallas streets, is how I leave ya
What would you do if someone shot ya main partner, (the heat of the moment)
Number one component, pain got ya, (the police can't stop ya)
The church can't either, puttin' in work for 2-1-dope, is how I leave ya

[Verse 3: Six2]
Stepped out my house, stopped short, oh no
Solid black rag, wrapped around a .44
Had a money situation with a fool next door
Disfigured his face and left him dead at the front door
Won't hesitate, to annihilate a punk ho'
Got to get ghost and regroup in Acapulco
Police got leads, but they really not fo' shot though
Suspect was last seen in como, showin' out
You shoulda seen him in his .44 Glock
Had his, enemies nervous, beggin' please don't serve us
In situations like these, I've been known to show out
He got his chestplate blowed outÂ…
Easily I approach
You sittin' like jack mask, go ballistic on yo bitch ass
Ya'll hoes ain't ready for Two Face
Been down since day uno, and ready to catch a case
Aggravated armed robbery is the plan
No need for skizzin', 'cause the clock keeps tickin'
So whats some aggravated shit without a pistol in it
The police say the suspects have not been apprehended

[Hook 1: Six2 & U.P.-T.I.G.H.T.]
What would you do, if Two Face came to pop ya? (The heat of the moment)
Number one component, pain got ya, (the police can't stop ya)
The church can't either, D-O-N Fort Worth, that's where I leave ya
What would you do, if Two Face came to pop ya? (The heat of the moment)
