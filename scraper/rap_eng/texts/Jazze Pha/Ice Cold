Ladies and Gentlemen, this young man is the author of the book
Pimps are people too
He is also the president of guns, bitches, and automobiles
He also controls all the seafood trade
He got, the skrimps, the lobsters, the primes
The selmon, the little selmon, the big selmen
The sardines, the cardads, and all that
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together and give a warm welcome
To Jay fizzle, my nizzle, fo shizzle
(Turn up J. Fizzle's microphone)
