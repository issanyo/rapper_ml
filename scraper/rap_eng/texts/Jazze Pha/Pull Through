[Verse 1: Jazze Pha]
Roll up on you, yeah yeah
Roll up too
Roll up a nigga!
Three times a charm (god)
You're like dope in my arm
Yeah, decorated, ooh
You kill the flavor, yah yah
She waving higher than a motherfucker
Somebody save me from that motherfucker (Somebody save me!)
So bad I didn't know your momma would
So glad I never fucked your cousin girl
Put it on you (put it on you), put it on you (put it on you)
Girl what I want you to do is

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Pull through (Yeah, yah yah)

Pull through, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: King Los]
Look, I love how you hips and your thighs meet
You were so thick you surprised me
Fuck like in pics on your IG, I like to kiss on your body
You with your baddest was to maneuver
You send addi I send a Uber
You need a  good food and good dick
Good lord I could give it to ya
Got no time to prolong, I ain't seen you in so long
Heard you fuckin' with a big timer, get you, get you, get you roll off
I need your body right next to me, rubbing me
Asking me what in the fuck would be stressing me
Answers no questions all you got the best in me
Long as you check on me you can get checks with me
Ain't got to go through no check ones
So check on no luggage
Now hop on this chair with me
I need somebody to flex with me
Haters can't talk enough shit
Yeah they see you coming up quick
You and me together laking up
That's a his or her fuck 'em up kid
Yeah they got to get this work, they prolly out of work
They prolly got a plan to stop us, I doubt it'd work
We never run outta war
All these motherfuckers wanna be rich, need to learn how to be solid first
Girl let me coach you on how it work, pull through

[Jazze Pha]
Just pull through baby, yeah, pull through shawty
Just pull through shawty, yeah, pull through shawty
Just pull through shawty, yeah, pull through shawty
Just pull through shawty, yeah, pull through shawty
Pull through

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Pull through (Yeah, yah yah)
Pull through (Yeah, yah yah)
I want you to pull through (Yeah, yah yah yah), pull through
C'mon shawty girl you just pull through
Pull through (Yah yah)
Pull through (Yeah), pull through
Pull through (Yah yah), pull through (ey)
Oh I had to pull through (Yah yah)
Pull through (ey)
Pull through, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
