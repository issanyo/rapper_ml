[Verse 1]
Thought you would keep it a G
Thought you would keep it a thou-ou
Whenever I tell the truth
You wanna break shit and wild out
I'm tryna get into you
You're tryna get into my pants
What's a young killer to do?
You ain't even doin' my dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Be singin' this melody on the way to work
I be singin' this melody with my girlfriends when we twerk
See you don't even know what to do-o-o-o
That's why I'm wa-wa-walkin' out on you-ou-ou-ou

[Chorus]
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, driving me, driving me
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, driving me, driving me
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, driving me, driving me

[Verse 2]
Might as well get a straitjacket, straitjacket (straitjacket)
You don't wanna do right, lil' boy, just stay ratchet (stay ratchet)
Games you playin', go messin' 'round, had to call Tyrone
No nights and weekend minutes, can't use my phone (can't use my phone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Be singin' this melody on the way to work
I be singin' this melody with my girlfriends when we twerk
See you don't even know what to do-o-o-o
That's why I'm wa-wa-walkin' out on you-ou-ou-ou

[Chorus]
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, driving me, driving me
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, (ooh, oh, boy) driving me, driving me
Coocoo-coo-coo, (oh, boy) coocoo-coo-coo (hey, baby)
Coocoo-coo-coo (oh, boy)
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, driving me, driving me

[Bridge]
When the beat starts, I'm okay, okay
I still get it bumpin' like an 808
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what's on my plate
Tony the Tiger, I'm grrrreat
He ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin', boy, I'm straight
Watch out, lil' boy
I drop the top, then I hop out, lil' boy
When the beat starts, I'm okay, okay
I still get it bumpin' like an 808
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what's on my plate
Tony the Tiger, I'm grrrreat
He ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin', boy I'm straight
Watch out, lil' boy
I drop the top, then I hop out, lil' boy

[Chorus]
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, driving me, driving me
Coocoo-coo-coo, coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, (ooh, oh, boy) driving me, driving me
Coocoo-coo-coo, (oh, boy) coocoo-coo-coo (hey, baby)
Coocoo-coo-coo (oh, boy)
Coocoo-coo-coo, (oh, boy) coocoo-coo-coo
Coocoo-coo-coo, driving me, driving me
