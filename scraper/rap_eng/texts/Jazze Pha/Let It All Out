[Krayzie Bone]
Need to get away from everybody, everybody pulling me in all directions, I don't wanna be here
Don't wanna play this game no more, so I can't way for the day I leave here
So I can get into my zone
I get teaching to my own
There's a lot of me that need to see clear
I don't wanna stay no more, I say no more
I fear
Everybody pulling me down they like gravity
Sometimes you can't come around your own family
Feels like I'm losing the light and my sanity
Maybe it's cause I'm living the life that might damage me
Tell me what you gon' do for me?
What if I need to hold something too?
Could you do for me like I always do for you?

Whether the sky is gray or the sun come out
Sometimes I don't wanna see nobody, I don't wanna see nobody, yeah yeah yeah
The sky is gray or the sun come out
Cause I don't wanna see nobody, I don't wanna see nobody

Let it all out
All the problems in the world, got to let it go
All the problems in the world, got to let them go
Let it all out
All the problems in the world, got to let it go
All the problems in the world, got to let them go

Feel like the whole world coming down on me hittin' like a mad truck, yeah yeah
Baby mom's and my landlord got my credit cards all maxed up, yeah yeah
Everybody want something, nobody want to put no cash up, yeah yeah yeah yeah
And when you was balling never call my ass up, damn

Got some call today (Hello?)
My homie just passed away
I know he's in a better place
Oh my God

Whether the sky is gray or the sun come out
Sometimes I don't wanna see nobody, I don't wanna see nobody, yeah yeah yeah
The sky is gray or the sun come out
Cause I don't wanna see nobody, I don't wanna see nobody

Let it all out
All the problems in the world, got to let it go
All the problems in the world, got to let them go
Let it all out
All the problems in the world, got to let it go
All the problems in the world, got to let them go
