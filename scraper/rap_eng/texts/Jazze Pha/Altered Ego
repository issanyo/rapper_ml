I can't lie I like to have sex
Kiss you from head to toe
Nibble on your neck
Take everything we did before
To another level
Rub your back while I'm kissing
On your nable
Sometimes I like to clown
And throw on the bed
Make the neighbors all up set
Make you scream my name
Pulling on your head
When the cops come knocking
I say...

It's my Altered Ego
That makes me do the things I do to you
My Altered Ego
And You'll never know the next move
I'll Put in you
Keep you Guessing, Keep you Guessing
Keep you Thinking, Keep you Thinking
Then I'm a Slow it down
Speed it, Beat it, do it all over again
This ain't no
Sexy Session, Sexy Session
I'm Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon
I got that Stamina
Make it last all night
Like Engineers Going Going

Stop switch to my gentlemen's tone
Whisper in your ear with a sweet little tone
Yo-Hoo turn around it let it Hoo
Your sexy you turning me into a bad boy
Sometimes I wanna Clown
And throw you on the bed
Make the neighbors all up set
Make you scream my name
Pulling on your head

When the cops come knocking
I say...

It's my Altered Ego
That makes me do the things I do to you
My Altered Ego
And You'll never know the next move
I'll Put in you
Keep you Guessing, Keep you Guessing
Keep you Thinking, Keep you Thinking
Then I'm a Slow it down
Speed it, Beat it, do it all over again
This ain't no
Sexy Session, Sexy Session
I'm Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon
I got that Stamina
Make it last all night
Like Engineers Going Going

One side of me
Is a Gentleman, a Missionary Man
The Other side of me
Makes me wanna wild out, Show out
Maybe let a friend watch
Ohh O O O Ohh
Here We Go
Ohh O O O Ohh
I'm about to Loose Control
Ohh O O O Ohh

It's My Altered Ego
That makes me do the things that I do to you
My Altered Ego
And you'll never know the next move
I'll put on you..
