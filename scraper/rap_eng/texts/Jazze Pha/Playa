[Hook]
He got money, he got G's
And the finest H-O-E's
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
(He's a playa!...)
He's a pimp, he's a mack
Tilted brim in a Cadillac
(He's a playa!...)
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar

[Too $hort]
I know those who ain't got it, feel like they want it
And those who got it ain't really gotta flaunt it
It's somethin' that we all go through and it's funny
What a nigga do when ya throw him some money
The first thing I bought was a Cadillac
I put the top down, bitch I ain't havin' that
I got a gang of Rolex's, too many cars
Too many broads, I've been doin' hard
Too $hort baby don't play that shit
I love this game and everyday I get
Money and hoes, they can't ease past me
If you don't believe me, ask Jazze

[Too $hort]
I'm a ghetto celeb well known in the streets
Ain't spent a night all alone in weeks
Anything you players do is never amazin'
Cause $hort got a bitch, for every occasion
And they ain't just black, they spanish and asian
When I come through they say "Man he's amazin"
I just take two hits, and pass it back
Where you find a white girl with ass like that?
Say it to my face, I can't pimp
Ain't a corner on this earth that I ain't been
Tap my pockets, I'm fat on spinach
I could spend a million dollars in a matter of minutes

[Too $hort]
It's all on a bitch, everything I get
From the rims on my whip to the rings I flip
Got a '5 and a '6, you ain't seen my shit?
So clean when I lean with a mean ass grip
I ain't mad at ya player if you're car is loud
Show these motherfuckers what you all about
You got style, like to drive fast and wild?
Pick the girlss with the big ol' ass and smiles
She act foul, you can't hold me down
I burn rubber on a bitch then I'm rollin' out
I do a donut, little kids yellin' wild
They wanna do it, Jazze tell 'em how

[Hook]
He got money, he got G's

He's a pimp, he's a mack
Tilted brim in a Cadillac
(He's a playa!...)
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
