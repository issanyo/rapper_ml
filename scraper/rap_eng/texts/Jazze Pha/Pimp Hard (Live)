[Intro]
Never forget, anybody can control a woman's body
But the key is to control her mind
See pimping's big business, it's been going on since the beginning of time
And it's going to continue straight ahead
Until somebody up there turns off the lights on this small planet

[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Yeah, big plush Cadillac seats holdin' me up
Bitches hatin' 'cause I'm always doing big boy stuff
Wood wheel I be grippin' in my big boy truck
Backed in at the club, gettin' this big boy sucked
8Ball, MJG, you know we can't be touched
If it's 'bout Hennessy and weed you can link it to us
If I feel you disrespectin', I'ma cock it and bust
And MJG gon' be right with me if that eight ain't enough

[Verse 2: MJG]
If 8 ain't enough, don't worry I got eight in the clip
Eight for them hard looks and eight for that lip
It was unnecessary
That sort of punishment was less than very ugly
Which was fucked up, you wanted this, you lucked up then
Oh well, some more shit I'm stuck up in
Hey, let's squash it, go sweep the dust up then
Drink a shot, I got a bitch you could drive a truck up in
MJG, pimp tight and I gotta

[Chorus]
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
Yeah, yeah, we handle this shit like a pimp should
I fuck with them niggas who run the hood
From the South to the East Coast to the West
I be puffin' on that shit that's gon' be burnin' in your chest
See them hoes want a nigga who got bread
These niggas want a bitch who got that fire head
And all I want is weed and money and more money
The streets don't respect a nigga with no money

[Verse 4: MJG]
You poor dummy, you should be spendin' your ho money
But she offered you some, you'd probably tell her, "No, honey"
You too slow, sonny
What I'm spittin' gon' make you know somethin'
So the next time instead of just talkin', you can show somethin'
And most hoes just like casinos, they built to blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me, I see some dough comin'
My main focus is tricks who be out ho huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free, I make 'em owe somethin'

[Chorus]
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder

[Verse 5: 8Ball]
Ayy, I like them yellow thick women givin' love to me
Hugs and kisses, disrespectin' bitches 'cause of me
Always wanna sex with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Okay we smoke with them hoes and get 'em somethin' to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill, baby
Pimp harder, pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for you, I'ma get me some

[Verse 6: MJG]
I hit a lick with some', tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run, so shut up and cut off the grits, they done
I want you up on your feet until they blister some'
Bitch you understand what I'm sayin', I'm the official one
MJG, I pimp strong until the reasons gone
Until it ain't no ho tracks left to sprinkle season on
The niggas who violated, they still bleedin' on
I beat packs and ship sacks and the leavings on

[Chorus]
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
Pimp hard, pimp harder
