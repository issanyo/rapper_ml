[Tela]
Second time around
Y'all know what it is, right heah, yeah
That table dance, gotta get that table dance
That table dance, come and give me a table dance
That table dance, gotta get that table dance
That table dance..

Ay say baby how you doin, actin like you new in
Town I done see you around, what you pursuin?
(?) love, where you been? Ain't been really seein
Your ass in the club, say what, just workin weekends
I know you makin ends, you got yourself a Benz
Naw that's that Lexus, protected with bubble ends
The parties where the dough at, go on and get the Moet
That's how it be, me and Lo-Key in V.I.P
Lovely I feel your breeze, strawberries and whip cream
Your body ease, top of me, what time you leave?
Bout a quarter three, go get your girls I get my guys
We have a orgy, you feelin me? That's kinda nice
Hurry up, don't you see my niggas ready to leave
They been blowin since these eve and they full of Remi
Say ba-by I wanna hit that fine, get that bind, split that dime
Why you lyin, on your side, you in front, I'm behind
Bullshit walk, money talk, I can be with any broad
But I want yo' panties off, why you havin any thoughts?

[Chorus *sung*]
G-string to the side, baby let me take a glance
The way you shake it baby girl you know your thighs put me in a trance
I'm givin you a second chance, to get the money in your hands
Baby for a table dance

[Tela]
Same bitch that I knew back from eighty-six college
Bitch polish dicks just for kicks, did some flicks with some chicks
Hold up hon, you ain't sick, why you gotta go and split
Tela's in the club won't you show a little love for this
Do some special shit you know like you never had
Cause, I'ma special playboy Rap-A-Lot'n with Brad
I make you laugh if you give me ass inside of a cab
Better yet the limo while my friends adapt
What you tellin me, you wanna have sex with me?
You and Ebony, and Melody, because I am celebrity?
I love it when y'all all come and lick on my balls
Take me to the dressin room and she ain't have on no drawers
Take it off, pussy blaow, mad girl wild
I don't really know if I can handle this without
A (?) compliments, bring some juice and supplements, cause
We be doin other shit, yeah y'all know that other shit
Went up in it, I'll be in it, when I hit it, try done did it
Not a minute, we not finished, where you goin? Change positions

[Chorus] - 4X
