[Verse 1: Spank B]
Step off the plane they know my name
Lax on the chain distortin' the game
Got the Bentley candy paint, super sport frame
Horse power untaimed I'm holdin' the reins
Spank gotta 6'4 blew the wits hydro folks fit
Hit the switch (zut zut)
My Chevy know a lot of tricks
I ride deuce dubs all the way to 26
Now ride the whip you ain't seen one like this
She like dang your roof swade
You know I seen you switchin' lanes in your coop mayne
See the way your chain hang I know your doin' thangs
And you roll wit Jazze Phae
That must mean its a bang

[Hook:]
When i pull up in the Chevy sittin' heavy on tires
5 screens inside and my doors butterfly
Girl stop cause you ain't seen a ride like this (2x)
You know you wanna holla I know you wanna ride
5 screens inside and my doors butterfly
Girl stop cause you ain't seen a ride like this (2x)

[Verse 2: Poke]
When I pull up and my feet touch ground
My wheels go round my wheels go round
Its me Poke as my bro man
Lot of karats in my ice but I ain't the snow man
Pills Bentley yeah that's the dough baker
I burry Pills now I'm the bread maker
The phantom car sittin' on now and laters
The hardest bar so you can ride it now or later
I'm in the coop wit a chick she a hot one
Not old enough to drive so I'm ridin' shot gun
Say you wanna playa wit some money well I got some
You ain't tryna ride baby girl I got options

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Zay Zay]
Everybody love the whips so popular
Candy painted 28's what you lookin' for
Its so hard to see me up in that Lamborghini
Diamond grill girl stop you ain't seen this before
Chick please you ain't seen me ridin' around
Chick freeze if you see me ride in your town
You know I stay wit the cars
The cars stay wit the broads
The broads stay wit the dogs
The dogs they get kicked out they car
I keep a whip wit rims that be outta state
People say that's him wit that amazin' thing
Ya boy Zay from LA wit the Chevrolet
I got the doors up it look like Imma fly away
