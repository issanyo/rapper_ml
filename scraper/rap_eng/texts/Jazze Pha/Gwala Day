[Hook: Young Ralph]
I wonder what bitch Imma spar today,should I take the truck, or take the car today
I started with pennys, no hardaway, now I live every day like a holliday
Moddles on top of more moddles day, bottles on top of more bottles day
Dollars on top of more dollars, the trap keep jumpin, I call it Gwala Day

[Verse 1: Young Ralph]
I got Gwala on me, I got dollars on me, I keep moddles on me
Told Jaz, get up in the VIP with me, I got the bitches and all the bottles on me
Live every day like a holliday, yep, every day Gwala Day
More dollars on more dollars, ballin hard, couldn't wait to win
Place your oder, I got bitches, dog
Old school 6 inches, dog
New school, right out the factories, with a crystal clear ceeling, dog
All of this Gwala, can't be broke no more
Iced out my pinkey, look how it froze
Sip on that Purple, now I move slow
So many bitches, I donate a hoe
Wake from my sleep, to the Gwala I go
Taking drink after drink, spending that Gwala, you know
Sprint that plan b, the Gwala ever get low, if it get low, then bitches might ghost
Niggas start acting like hoes, probably mad at them hoes
While I'm still stacking Gwala, still doing these shows, and this what I'm thinkin while I'm on the road

[Verse 2: Young Ralph]
Stackin up my Gwala like I'm Mayweather, my gwala up, I'm doing way better
Got a hood bitch, that give good head, but my Cali bitch, she do it way better
Been trill, and I stay wetter
Numbered matress, I lay there
Make a jug full of Guala, my bitch told me I saved better
Put the dick on her, then shoot the Hey Vetter
Beem on it, it spray better
Interior, it's way leather
Big cap, but I ain't rockin Denom
But fuck it, we spendin all the Guala, got doller signs all over the table top
All of these akers, that's what Guala bought
I can't talk to a bitch, less it's bout Guala
Fuck your bitch, then give her some Guala
I do it boneless, cause she like to swallo
