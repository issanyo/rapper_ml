[Intro: Jazze Pha]
So pretty, love to see ya pretty pink when you in the club
Showin all the playas love, pretty pink
Love to see your pretty pink

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
What it is baby
Come on show me love
What it is baby
When you fall off in the club
I might break you a dub off
Or buy you a drink
If you show me the pretty pink
What it is baby
Come on show me love
What it is baby
When you fall off in the club
I might break you a dub off
Or buy you a drink baby
If you just show me the pretty pink

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Her pussy look damn near better than her face
With haste, you race yo ass to the club so you can waste
Yo money, Yo time
Then she work her spine then you losein' yo mind
Now all yo money mine
'Cause I'm up in her mind
Now get yo trick ass back on the grind and make cash
Cuz she gone pop her pussy
And you gonna pay up real fast
And I jump with Pink Cadillac like that
Bitches screamin, "OH! He's a Mississippi mack"
Well I is that
Get yo ass back on yo stage
I'm tryna put my parkin lot on them two's and J's
You need a place to stay
Lay yo ass on the couch
Pull out yo money out
She might pop it in her mouth
In the back in the VIP
It's O.G, Colhee, Angel, Eddie , and me
Nothin's for free
So what it is baby, gone touch the glass
Show that pretty pink, bend over, get my cash

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
What it is baby
Come on show me love
What it is baby
When you fall off in the club
I might break you a dub off
Or buy you a drink
If you show me the pretty pink
What it is baby
Come on show me love
What it is baby
When you fall off in the club
I might break you a dub off
Or buy you a drink baby
If you just show me the pretty pink

[Verse 2: Marcus]
What you doin' girl with all that?
So much booty, when you back up, I damn near fall back
But ay, I ain't complainin', aiming, swingin' this ball bat
Knockin' poo poo out the park
Marcus the tall mack
That you met last week smellin' like that bud
Smoked out, loced out, all in yo ear, tryna see what was up
With you and ya partner
Cuz I was three deep with my clique
Gettin' slizzard with David Banner and that nigga Dip
But look here baby, I was really just diggin' ya steez
Like when you be droppin', ya elbows be touchin' yo knees
I'm so intrigued
Plus you showin' some cleavage, with ya shirt unbuttoned halfway
And I'm sippin' on that Grand Marnier
So let's say around ten
We meet up at the bar, we can get us some more Henn
I get up with my niggas, you get up with yo friends
I'm tryin' to work some motion into your ocean and dive on in, on in

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
What it is baby
Come on show me love
What it is baby
When you fall off in the club
I might break you a dub off
Or buy you a drink
If you show me the pretty pink
What it is baby
Come on show me love
What it is baby
When you fall off in the club
I might break you a dub off
Or buy you a drink baby
If you just show me the pretty pink

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I ain't too good hood, ain't too bad for the suburbs
The best of the best, nigga, fuck what you h-eard
I'm superb
Or maybe "your majesty" be the word
For king of all kings supreme of all things (tell him)
Tip be the nigga who seen in broad dreams
Takin' off their g-strings and they small jeans
So fresh, so clean whenever you see T.I.P
Hoes yell for me like Scream 3
I got a solid gold Caddy or a royal blue Impala
I make a old hoe choose and a young hoe holla
Been a baller since my younger days
Raised in the city of Atlanta
Holla at Banner
Back and forth to Mississippi (A TOWN!)
Got a bad bitch with me and a car
From Magic City
Choosin' on some bitches Banner had stripin' in the Avalanche
Your fuckin' with a playa, young nigga
Got more pull than the mayor, fuck nigga

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
What it is baby
Come on show me love
What it is baby
When you fall off in the club
I might break you a dub off
Or buy you a drink
If you show me the pretty pink
What it is baby
Come on show me love
What it is baby
When you fall off in the club
I might break you a dub off
Or buy you a drink baby
If you just show me the pretty pink
