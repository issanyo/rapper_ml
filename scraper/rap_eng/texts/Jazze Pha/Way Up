[Intro: Jazze Pha]
Turn the music way up

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
I'm goin' to the top, goin' way up
Find us in the club, goin' way up
We 'bout to get a tab, run it way up
All of my dues, they been paid up
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches

[Verse 1: Quicktrip]
Stuntin' on these bitches, frontin' on these bitches
Fuck the feds, told the bitch I don't interrogate
Let her fuck my girlfriend, now she went gay
Old niggas always got somethin' bad to say
Way up, way up, where I'm tryna stay
Been broke so many times, ain't goin' back that way
Made a mil last week, you know I'm tryna play
If your bitch get in my ride, you know she gotta pay
A real boss never take a bitch away
Never fuck me good and crack call to my scene
If the bitch try to leave, you say andele
Private jet when we flyin' off the runway
Way up, way up, I got sky mile
Scott pull the trip, you know I'm in the cloud
Bankroll, got a young nigga talkin' loud
Way up, way up, off sky mile

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
I'm goin' to the top, goin' way up
Find us in the club, goin' way up
We 'bout to get a tab, run it way up
All of my dues, they been paid up
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches

[Verse 2: Quicktrip]
Want me in your scene, you see me, owe deposits
I was ballin' on a budget, now a nigga really got it
Out in Vegas, out in Drais, 20 thousand for a table
Man and Tommy Hayes, nigga, choppin' up, we some players
Yeah, I'm sittin' at the table with a bitch with high maintenance
If you want your bitch, nigga, might have to buy her back
Call [?] on the phone, tell him book me 2 flights
Yeah, I'm on the next flight, go to Miami tonight
Told girl to pack her bag, shit wasn't even unpacked
Came back to the city, brand new hill cap
Sittin' on some red flags, yeah the city mad as fuck, I'm 20 again
Bitch, I'm makin' money, ain't tryna make friends
They don't fuck with a nigga 'less you gettin' it in
Next night, 100 mil, lemme get it in
You playin', ain't got a lot, you know I'm [?]
I got the whole motherfuckin' club sayin' FACTS

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
I'm goin' to the top, goin' way up
Find us in the club, goin' way up
We 'bout to get a tab, run it way up
All of my dues, they been paid up
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
Stuntin' on these bitches, stuntin' on these bitches
