[Intro]
Turn this shit way up
I be havin' so many bro it just be like you know what I mean
I be goin' way up
Light this bitch up
I made it out the hood
Phizzle Phizzle Swipey Phizzle Swipey
I was forced to get money
Get money get money Let's Go!

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Fall up in the club
Ballin' Ballin' Ballin'
Bitches wanna hide
Call em, Call em, Call'em
Off this rubber bandey
I do not have a wallet
I am on like Curry
Don't stop me when I'm ballin'
I'ma get money
Money money money
I'ma get money
Money money money
I'ma get money

[Verse 1: Swipey]
I'm gettin money with Jazze
Countin' money fingers ashy
Bad bitch with me and she sassy
Whippin' up Mary-Kate Ashley
I want the world for my lil brother
Scrappin the pot whippin' butter
Southeast we come from the gutter
Stretching this dope like it's rubber
Birdman son I'm a stunna
I'm tryna' eat with a supper
Catch me in the trap with a bumper
Versace shades feel like Big Papa

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Fall up in the club
Ballin' Ballin' Ballin'
Bitches wanna hide
Call em, Call em, Call'em
Off this rubber bandey
I do not have a wallet
I am on like Curry
Don't stop me when I'm ballin'
I'ma get money
Money money money
I'ma get money
Money money money
I'ma get money

[Verse 2: Swipey]
Money money money
Money money money
Dollar bill after dollar bill stick together like it's honey
Birdies they sing like the choir
Whippin' up Lizzie McGuire
If you want that work them you're hired
Money so old like my money retired

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Fall up in the club
Ballin' Ballin' Ballin'
Bitches wanna hide
Call em, Call em, Call'em
Off this rubber bandey
I do not have a wallet
I am on like Curry
Don't stop me when I'm ballin'
I'ma get money
Money money money
I'ma get money
Money money money
I'ma get money

[Verse 3: Romilli]
I just want all them pesos
Stack it up like a lego
Takin trips down the A with my bro
Got a white bitch that fuck up her nose
Beatin' the pot on the stove
Designer my shoes and my clothes
I don't want half I want the loaf
Need a bad bitch that look like Dej Loaf
She like what piece you want I want both
I remember back then I was broke
Now I need them racks just for my shows
I love countin' up them bankrolls

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Fall up in the club
Ballin' Ballin' Ballin'
Bitches wanna hide
Call em, Call em, Call'em
Off this rubber bandey
I do not have a wallet
I am on like Curry
Don't stop me when I'm ballin'
I'ma get money
Money money money
I'ma get money
Money money money
I'ma get money

[Outro: Jazze Pha]
Money, money, money, money, money money, money (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Money money money (aye)
All I do is wake up in the morning then get me some money, yeah damn right yeah you right yeah!
