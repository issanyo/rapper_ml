[Verse 1]
I can't see how anyone could ignore ya
Girl you got my mind going outta me
Girl let me admit that I do adore ya
Cause there's a lock box to my heart and you're the key
Well look at her and it's a fact why all the dogs chase the cat
Can't help but to want a girl like that cause she be the one for me (for me)
Every time you come up around me you give me this feeling
A feeling I've never experienced, girl I don't know much about it
But I'm such a curious guy let's give love a try

[Chorus]
So incredible, the way I feel inside
No need to try and hide it
Could it be your smile that's got me feeling
So invincible girl you're so incredible, incredible

[Verse 2]
I know you heard it all before
But believe me when I say most of these chicks are boring
Compared to you there not the same
You're all I ever need more that's why I ain't playing no games
Throwing away my compass I'm done exploring
Girl, let's fly away, search the globe and the seven seas
Tryna find the joy that she brings
Love is blind but truly I can see that she's the one for me
Every time you come up around me you give me this feeling
A feeling I've never experienced and I don't know much about it
But I'm such a curious guy let's give love a try

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Can't stop thinking bout you baby
You're on my mind like every day
Cause when I'm alone
It hits me that we were meant to be
See girl no ordinary guy
Nothing more that I can say that's why I can't let you get away
Girl you're so fly and only a fool would let a girl like you pass by
You're the missing link in my life, so baby be mine, mine

[Chorus]x2
