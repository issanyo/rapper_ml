(Southern Smoke)

[Hook - Jazze Pha] - 2X - w/ ad libs
Tell me, tell me - how to make a million
How to be, a millionaire

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
Got to stick to your script, never change up
Keep a lot of whips, got to change up
And if it's hot put them thangs up (yeah)
You ain't got to buck it all, put that change up
And that's the way you stack that mail up
Shorty got jammed, got to change the sale up
But keep it real, get his male up
You'll get it back nigga, get that bread up
And stay away from these snitches
Cause it's B.O.B. - Bread Over these Bitches
It's in my heart, I can't live without it
Can't sell it no more, but I can rap about it

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
What up Jeezy?
Yeah, light up the bubble lines (Southern Smoke)
Like the strip on the side of that Matchbox
You forgot? Get your Glock, make sure it ain't on padlock
Ridin 'til that cash got, dip into your stash spot
Got to spend to make it, so go get it, stack the cash out
Let's get it like it is fit if we get it to split it
Let's get it like we don't got to have it in a minute
Don't matter you got to go out and get it or quit it
Stay on them bows/Bowes like Riddick, stay tellin hoes "forget it"
But my mind 'bout my money man, got to have grind
"Dada dada dah" dog it's lookin like it's Bat-time
Purchase somethin fast (what kind?), the black on black kind
That I'm, goin to write off soon as it's tax time, cause that's mine
