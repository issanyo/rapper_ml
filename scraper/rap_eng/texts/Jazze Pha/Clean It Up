Hook 1:
We’ve got to clean up the act, what we think and what we do
It’s gon be good for me, it’s gon be good for you
Got to clean up the act, in the places we’re living
We can make some real changes with the chances we’re given x2
Verse 1:
Az is new on the block and they already want to fight
But my lyrics stay tight never losing their bite
Bite down like a bear trap out in the woods
You can gnaw at your leg but it won’t do any good
Out in nature where it’s breezy but I’m wheezing worse than Weezy
Air you’re breathing isn’t pure the ones who call it clean are sleazy
Put a mask on like Bane, but I’m not looking for fame
I’m just tryna spread my message listen up here’s the claim:
Hook 1

Verse 2:
Already way too many people on the planet!
So if you think you want to be a parent, better plan it!
Too many babies (fix) having babies when they’re only 16
See that’s fucked up but you don’t care, when you’re watching your screen
Now I’m not tryna be mean, but there are lots of situations
When abortion can be justified! I understand creation
Of new life is important and it’s a beautiful thing!
Just think about all of the other side-effects of your fling, water and
Housing getting scarce, so where are you gonna go?
If you meet a fly chick, y’all don’t have to take it slow
But either wrap your shit up or make sure she’s on the pill-
Be responsible, accountable, or nobody will!
Hook 1

Verse 3:
I’m trying to clean myself up, like the water in a Brita
Running daily like a hamster, trying to get a little fitter
I stopped eating meat ‘cause the industry is whack
They just care about their wallets, they’ll be glad to get you fat
They don’t care about the water, they don’t care about the land
They don’t care about the future, they’re not making any plans
They done bought out Congress, and the EPA too
Spitting propaganda straight into the ears of me and you
Don’t believe it! Do your underground research
But be ready ‘cause a brand new you is sure to emerge
We in purgator-evolving into Heaven from hell
In between your birth and death is when you learn to live well
Open up your heart, and open up your mind
Don’t be scared, unity and peace are all that you’ll find
Hook 1:
We’ve got to clean up the act, what we think and what we do
It’s gon be good for me, it’s gon be good for you
Got to clean up the act, in the places we’re living
We can make some real changes with the chances we’re given
Hook 2:
We’ve got to clean up the act, how we think and who we be
It’s gon be good for you, it’s gon be good for me
Got to clean up the act, choose the water over gold
Better make your own life, never do what you’re told
Hook 1
Outro: We’ve gotta clean it up. This planet, the air, the water, society, this shits a mess. It’s beautiful alright but it’s a fuckin mess right now
