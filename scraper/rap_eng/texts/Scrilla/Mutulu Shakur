[Intro]
I know some of the shit I say...
Might get me picked off by special forces
It's all love though
I call this one Mutulu Shakur
R.I.P. Afeni

[Verse 1]
Political militant draped in black camo
Hot wire the Porsche' and [?]
Snipers off the rooftop
Like bitch, who killed 2Pac?
Spirit of Afeni, riding solo in the new drop
Who shot Chris Wallace?
And Michael Jordan's father?
Framed Bill Cosby
Can't you tell they trying void us?
Book of Amos, God's plan written on papyrus
Cage a black man and feed him food for his silence
Government are Nazi's
Entertain or detain
Your life's a science project
Police knocking at my door without a warrant and this pistol
Say religion is a lie and if you pray, how it kill you
