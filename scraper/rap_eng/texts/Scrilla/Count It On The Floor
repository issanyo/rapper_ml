[Hook: Jeezy]
Count it on the floor, count it on the floor
There go a bag full of money knocking at the door
He say he just ran out, he need a couple more
I'm bout’ to pour it out the bag
Count it on the floor, count it on the floor
Count it on the floor, count it on the floor
There go a bag full of money knocking at the door
I'm bout to pour it out the bag
Count it on the floor

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Big bag of rubber bands by the night stand
In the wee wee hours I'm the night man
Whip a college tuition with my right hand
Can you drop it old school, you got the right man
Get them 20’s off the floor, I'm getting fly today
And you ain't gotta even sell them they just fly away
Cut that motherfucker off, no ceiling fan
When you catch me in the coupe, no ceiling man
Make the motherfuckers watch me like showtime
Johnny Depp, cinemax, bitch it’s blow time
Nigga guess what I’m is, bank teller
You know my partner got the lean, drink seller

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 2: Scrilla]
I'm a real motherfucker I get many cash
I let the money do the talking I ain't gotta brag
I stuff 10 000 in these jeans to make these true religions sag
Bitch who you kidding that's bout 50 in that Louis bag
Name a stripper in the club that don't know my name
Bitch got the tripping when they mention about no lying game
Now that's a damn shame, how these bitches trip
She holla fuck my baby daddy I'm gonna leave with him
She say this scrilla’s girl, he fuck with white and jeezy and them
Since he signed his deal he act funny I think I’m leaving him
Bitch your chance slim, quit all that jaw-jacking
I threw a thousand on the floor and told em’ make It happen

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Slick Pulla]
24 /7 like the food mart
New rarri thang treat it like a go-kart
600 horses that's a lot of power
Niggas fronting affect me because they really sour
We in camosas spent that hay stack
A cool hundred thousand long that’s a hay stack
And my block look like a race track
I’m jimmy Johnson lapping niggas gunning on the gas
On the floor with miss ass counting up them bands
I can catch the bag blind folded I got great hands
Clear the set,  count it up onto the next shift
Come get this shit too many trash bags off in this bitch
