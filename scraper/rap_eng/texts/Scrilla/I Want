[Hook: Scirlla & Kash Doll]
I get anything I want
Everything I want
Any bitch I want
I get anything I want
Everything I want
Any bitch I want
I get anything I want
Everything I want
Any bag I want
(I ain't playing with you broke bitches!)
I get everything I want
Anything I want
Any whip I want
(I ain't playing with you broke bitches!)

[Verse 1: Kash Doll]
Look, any whip I want, any bag I want
Any crib I want, any dick I want
I can get it!
Look, any Coco purse, any Louis belt
Any 'sace shades, any Balmain
I can get it!
I spent forty five thousand on my neck
This the key to life (woo!)
Bread winner like a husband
Think I need the wife
Top down, in the foreign, tryna see the sights
Ten chains on, if these bitches wanna see the light
It's Kash Doll, I'm a heavy flexer
I get bags for the walk through
Giuseppe’s for a raw shoe
Wait, I really did this verse in my robe
Cartier wrist is lit up like a strobe
These niggas catching feelings, oh no
I’m just catching these flights I’m gone

I get anything I want
Everything I want
Any bitch I want
I get anything I want
Everything I want
Any bitch I want
I get anything I want
Everything I want
Any bag I want
(I ain't playing with you broke bitches!)
I get everything I want
Anything I want
Any whip I want
(I ain't playing with you broke bitches!)
