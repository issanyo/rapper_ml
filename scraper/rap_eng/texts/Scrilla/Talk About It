[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I got this bitch, she a dime, I told that girl you a block
The way that brick locking up I say you must be a cop
Hey, get that light out my face, I said that must be my watch
You should see me at a stove, that shit is something to watch
I said you fucking with Snow, you know I put on a show
She wanna give me some head, I said I take mine and go
He say he ain't got my bread, I said I take mine and blow
Nigga, you heard what I said, I said I take mine and snow
So now she rolling with me, me I got her from Scrilla
She spill that drink on my seats, yeah you know I'mma kill her
I ain't talking bout haters, I ain't talking bout snitches
What he talking bout nigga? Nothing but dope in these bitches

[Verse 2: Scrilla]
Bitch, I talk about dough, I'm under the scope
Got a bitch with the pills, got a ho with the coke
Got the bitch with the gas, got a ho with the bags
Got a couple stripper bitches that be shaking that ass
Got a ho with the Rove that be bussing the cloves
And I don't know her name but I got her from Snow
Got a bitch on the low another ho on the cater
Say she play in Miami but I'mma fuck her in Vegas
Call the bitch in the Staples, say she cheer for the Lakers
She gon suck for a buck, but she gonna fuck for a favor
Her baby daddy a hater, always blocking a player
I be doing it big, CTE be the label

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Boo]
Let's talk bout dope in these hoes, I put that dough over bitches
Haters lips on that whip, look like that bitch blow me kisses
Honey, my water blue, look like that bitch going swimming
Park the the Lamb in the front, look like the bitch going with me
Got my crook in my city, push whips talking midgets
Popcorn got it popping, not that Orville Redenbacher
I'm talking bails of that yay, I'm talking scales of that chyea
Look how that water just shocked it, look how that soda just locked it
All my bitches love me, all my niggers they silent
Couple niggers that hustle, couple niggers that's robbing
Put them hoes on the vodka, peep them hoes in the lobby
Started off in the bed, fuck them hoes on the carpet
