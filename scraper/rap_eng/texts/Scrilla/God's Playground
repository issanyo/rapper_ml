[Verse 1]
Dancing with the devil, red bottom spiked hair
Gather what you live, call that lil' nigga Dice here
Medellin regime of cocaine
Rich Porter ghost in the Bentley that's money green
Transport [?] confidential
Mob
Lobster free tata, sounds by Sinatra
Greatest of all times, legend of Chupacabra
Sacrificial goat, Fidel Castro
[?] young [?] Jones
Black Martin Price's, black we the new ISIS
Dare you kill one of mines boy, you better live righteous

[Verse 2]
Now all I ever wanted as a second chance
My only goal in life was to be the man
Big Teech and Meech all in my DNA
Cook a brick and lay it just like a Frito-Lay
Spudd Webb, Mutombo I'm on my higher lows
I'm on this late night shift with the comodores
Hand gesture, speaking at this council meeting
Dirty Harry blow like the quiet sink
John Stockton white call me Jazzy Jeff
Mailman flew it to my last [?]
I can spot a [?] with a red beam
And I'm the biggest player on my favourite team
John Gotti, bet put up the whole block
Scrilla Enterprise with a cold plot
Catch me gettin' top in a old drop
And I'm the richest nigga from my old block

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Watchin' off [?] payamas, my crib bananas
Weed selection, the fruit salad
This a love song dedicated to the paper, this a true ballad
Coupes gather, we meet up over seafood platters
Jet Life or your life don't matter
We connected with MMG the scrilla stackers
Them niggas saltier than saltine crackers
They observin' the status, the way we move around the map
Climbin' the corporate ladder, they wish we was only rapper but
We advanced us hustlin' legitimate business man
All money and like Nip and them
My hustle grind like Tip now
Still chasing dreams like Meek now
But I'm never sleepin'
Smokin' one for Lil Snupe a fallen star from my Rolls Royce roof
Reminiscing the last time we spoke, the last joint we smoked
