Ridin round in a rarri all night with a gig
Getting money, I went over and bought me a rollie
I done had everything that I ever wanted
I done fucked the baddest women
Really it ain't nothing to me
My nigga, I done fucked up check
I rock that Maison Margiela
Consistent designer that's on me, I'm different
I got that work and I'm serving junkies
I cook up them pies out my kitchen
Skrt! That's the sound of the fork in the pot
Urrrt! That's the sound of the dope when it's dry
I got bout 51 flavors, niggas still owe me some favors
I been round Meek and them chasers
All of my youngins is takers
Don't come off a hater
Them 40s got lasers
Nigga trash get bagged up
Bobby Booshay for a bag bruh
Bombastic telephone-tastic
Four finga ring in a bullet in your outfit
Put a nigga out quick, ice on the hot shit
Choppa gotta roar like rah rah rah
Dumb nigga pop shit, I ain't with the talkin
Pull up on a pussy like oh my gawd

Skrt! That's the sound of the fork in the pot
That's the sound of the fork in the pot
Whoa! That's the sound of the fork in the pot
Whoa! That's the sound of dope when it's dry


Fifty-one fifty, choppa unload
They like got-damn nigga stop shootin'
Time on my hand cost a whole lot of money
You ain't saying nothing nigga, what you talkin' bout fooley?
Wings on the back, and I'm flyer than a Pelican
Nigga figure fuck and it's squarer than an element
223 kick the door I get intimate
Fuck all that talkin' I came for the Benjamins
150 round, nigga lay down
Catch em in the kitchen when you cookin up
Nigga lay down, don't make a sound
Choppa give a pussy nigga tummy tuck
Skrt! Skrt! Skrt! Skrrrrrrrt!
That's the sound of the fork in the pot
Whoa! That's the sound of you niggas on flock
I got the juice
Flava flava Ferragamo
Fire Marshall hotter than a ghost pedal
60K Ric Flair, foreign weather
Leather soft on that Margiela
Presidential painted rose gold
Now I'm sitting on my old hoes
I was making 10 bands
Really cuttin' dope finessing with no doors
