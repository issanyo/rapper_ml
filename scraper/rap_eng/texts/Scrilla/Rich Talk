[Hook: Scrilla]
Mixed the Alize with the Remy
Trapping for like four or five bitches
If it's 'bout the money then it's rich talk
A hundred thousand dollars nigga rich talk
Two hundred thousand nigga, rich talk
Half a mil nigga, rich talk
If it's 'bout the money then it's rich talk
A million dollars nigga, rich talk

[Verse 1: Kash Doll]
Bond No. 9, smell me all the time
Trap still, drop the Jordan number nine
Kash Doll counting, I don' cashed out
Made a million dollars on a cash route
Homer Simpson, dope doer all the time
All the blue flame ain't hard to find
Shooters on deck with me all the time
Push the envelope if you cross the line
Broke nigga need a translator
You be talking to investigators
Nigga on me, fuck his baby momma
Made her suck the dick with a condom

[Hook: Scrilla]
Mixed the Alize with the Remy
Trapping for like four or five bitches
If it's 'bout the money then it's rich talk
A hundred thousand dollars nigga rich talk
Two hundred thousand nigga, rich talk
Half a mil nigga, rich talk
If it's 'bout the money then it's rich talk
A million dollars nigga, rich talk

[Verse 2: Scrilla]
Aye!
My conversations always, commas, commas, commas, commas, commas
Wrist prezzi, rolex, Trump- Obama
Hop up in the Maybach, I'm with Ricky
I'm with Scrilla, we the ones in every city
Look, waist snatched, ass fat, you know them titties
Gold chains, Coogi sweater, bitch I'm Biggie
Don't pull it out the lot if it ain't fucking kidding
Talking dinero, dollar, pound and peso bitches
Pussy so delicious, Chanel all in my dishes
Louis Vuittons six inches, when I handle all my buisness
About to pick the check up like a Nike bag!
Bank tellers love me, baby why you mad?
Aye!

[Hook: Scrilla]
Mister the Alize with the Remy
Trapping for like four or five bitches
If it's 'bout the money then it's rich talk
A hundred thousand dollars nigga rich talk
Two hundred thousand nigga, rich talk
Half a mil nigga, rich talk
If it's 'bout the money then it's rich talk
A million dollars nigga, rich talk

[Verse 3: Kash Doll]
I'm about to count a meal, me & Scrill
It's four stories like a book inside my crib (levels)
MTV need to look at how I live
So when I talk that rich talk, you bitches know it's real
I bought some Giuseppe's just to wear them on a P.J
Got so many pair, you might never see a replay
My shit play up in Stroker's, send a bottle to the D.J
Cell phone buzzing, the promoter's say they need me
Rich talk, these Rosetta Stone's
Different language when the fetty grows
KDmoji's, for that rich talk
Even when I'm quiet, bitch my wrist talk

[Hook: Scrilla]
Mister the Alize with the Remy
Trapping for like four or five bitches
If it's 'bout the money then it's rich talk
A hundred thousand dollars nigga rich talk
Two hundred thousand nigga, rich talk
Half a mil nigga, rich talk
If it's 'bout the money then it's rich talk
A million dollars nigga, rich talk
