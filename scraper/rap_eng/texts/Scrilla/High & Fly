[Intro]
Yeah

Okay

[Verse 1: Scrilla]
Hopped up out the Benz, then put on my Gucci slippers
Just got me some head, from who? From your favorite stripper
Last night it was kush and some gwap
We was at the landmark, getting drunk all pop
I was running on molly with a bitch from fally
With a get get get, I’mma take er on hah
I’m so high, I fly in this bitch
Come full drive, tied to this chick
Talkin bout the eggs nigga, bitch meetin zipper
Let yo mom say hi to this dick
Tell me what yo prices is, I got good connections
I could get a zip in 10 minutes
If she ask fo blow she better hit the floor
And don’t come up til she finish
Talkin bout the lime light, baby I’m in it
Big, I run gangs as I let you hear it
If you ever ever let me get it
I’mma cut you off soon as we screamin
I’mma doubtin nigga by business
My ex bitch is my witness
My daughter stay in them true religions
So my baby mama ain’t trippin
I remember days when I was fucked up
And I couldn’t get enough of yall
And now my heart is cold, feel like I owe you hoes, I’mma fuckin avoid yo calls
Nigga getting lick just as getting rich
Niggas ball out quick just to get chicks
Everything in the gut come with fly kicks
When you see me in the club you know how I trick

[Hook: Jeezy]
Holler when you see me nigga, I be clubbing every night
If I wanted baby I could get some lovin every night
Smokin some, be trickin, I say fuck that shit to any of us
Sippin ‘cause them flavor, hey I do this shit like every night
2 ceelo, I’m passin by
You see me me, I’m high & fly
With my bitch, she do or die
You see me me, I’m high & fly
Stay fresh like it’s do or die
You see me me, I’m high & fly
You see me me, I’m high & fly
You see me me, I’m high & fly

[Verse 2: Cap-1]
You see me, I’m flyin by
Brand new Gucci aviator
50 bands in my robbin gene
You could see the motherfuckin thing I do with that paper
Got a bitch on raw, bitch on pills
2 seated coupe and I’m just lookin for he wheel
Pluggin Arizona, I’m just tryna get a deal
Sold out, just went the middle, I’mma show er how I feel
Got er rockstar steady, tests on waddy
Shit gon molly, make a chick get poddy
Fuck the afterparty, you can meet me in the lobby
Crib in the A, got a crib on Collar
Smoking that gas, I’m new, no molly
Throwin that money, tell a damn for the dollar
Baby get your baby daddy, he don’t really want no problem
We them south side niggas, ridin round with the party
Top left back, show er that rolly
Dope boy nigga, all these hoes gon know me
She be want a chance, if I let er she a show me
Move like a G in the club with a toomy
100 niga deep, catch you and get foolish
Bad bitch with me, nigga look at her booty
Plan to put me down, nigga smoke a whole qulie
Had her rollin up a one cuz it ain’t do nothing to me
Geeked up and I’m rolling up
Got my shades on and I’m chillin
And I got a gang of hoes but I’m chasin dough
And every time I try to catch feelings
Either my pockets stuffed with them bank rolls and I fuck around with them killas
And I got a hundred strippers on a party bussin
It’s me Young in this Scrilla

[Hook: Jeezy]
Holler when you see me nigga, I be clubbing every night
If I wanted baby I could get some lovin every night
Smokin some, be trickin, I say fuck that shit to any of us
Sippin ‘cause them flavor, hey I do this shit like every night
2 ceelo, I’m passin by
You see me me, I’m high & fly
With my bitch, she do or die
You see me me, I’m high & fly
Stay fresh like it’s do or die
You see me me, I’m high & fly
You see me me, I’m high & fly
You see me me, I’m high & fly
