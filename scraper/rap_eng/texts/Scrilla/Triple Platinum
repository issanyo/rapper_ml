[Interlude]
You understand? When I get to heaven, I'll see my grandmother there. She'll say "Great God almighty, here come my child! He must've got here by prayer." Did y'all hear that? That's what my grandmother will say. She'll say "Great God almighty, here come my boy! He must've got here by prayer"

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Versace drawers like I'm triple platinum
Forty cars like I'm triple platinum
Double R's on the gates like I'm triple platinum
Shows cost a hundred like I'm triple platinum
Uh, triple platinum
Uh, triple platinum
Triple platinum
Me and Hov back and forth like I'm triple platinum
Triple platinum
I'm out in Cannes, Club Gotha

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Double R's on the gates, like I'm triple platinum
Couple pawns in the lake, the couch is in the plastic
Had a phone call with Drake so we could fix the madness
Time for the real niggas just to really cash in
Murals of Machiavelli, wealthy my mind states
Everyday the net worth racin' the crime rate
Sweat drippin' from my fitted givin' niggas chills
Only ones who standin' still the ones who on the pills
Summer school and scholarships, we said was sucka shit
Straight out of high school, they had us touchin' bricks
In the trap with the white was such a sacrifice
Sentences for sellin' dope, just pray your casket nice
But I had a lawyer like them triple platinum
His retainer was the change up in the kitchen cabinet
Everybody mad at ya when you're livin' fabulous
Self made, then you never out here kissin' asses
Still hand-to-hand like they chicken patties
Mad at the world, but you trigger happy
Double R's on the gates, it's like I'm triple platinum
Couple pawns in the lake, the pistol's in the plastic

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Triple platinum
Triple platinum
Hundred room mansion, nigga, like I'm triple platinum
More money than them niggas that went triple platinum
Triple platinum
Triple platinum
Double M all these niggas like we triple platinum
Goin' hard, gangsta, triple platinum
Triple platinum
Forty cars like I'm triple platinum
Four hundred acres like I'm triple platinum

[Verse 2: Scrilla]
Triple platinum without an album sale
Three million grams, I left a powder trail
All gold Rollie, face like a diamond field
Fie on me, nigga, this is not a fire drill
Real trap nigga, live like I'm triple platinum
Marble the floors and put gold on my cabinets
My voodoo lady still keep her couch in the plastic
Triple platinum, they hatin', niggas alter they captions
Ten years and it's time for revenge
Paintings on my wall a gift to my kids
Versace drawers like I'm triple platinum
Wore 'em once and disposed 'em after
Bitches fuck me like I'm triple platinum
Like Prince in that purple jacket
Purple rain, pop a Perc' and half a Xanax
Trap star, livin' like I'm triple platinum
These are the jewels of many gods, the seek blessings
Scriptures written on platinum plaques, decode the message
Voice of a legend, Grammy nominated
Ramadan once a year, my sacrificial payment
Stone thrown at my Jesus piece, help me Lord
Protect me, kill my Judas with a platinum sword
A king, but I'm punished with a crown of thorns
Triple platinum nails force these open arms
God's child, my soul triple platinum
When I speak, it's with the richest accent
I die for the ones that I love
All the pain, I just fill it with void

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Triple platinum
Triple platinum
Hundred room mansion nigga like I'm triple platinum
More money than them niggas that went triple platinum
Triple platinum
Triple platinum
Double M all these niggas like we triple platinum
Goin' hard, gangsta, triple platinum

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I seen it from afar, blessings from the Lord
When a nigga that's so sharp, have his conscious loss
Before you buy a bottle, let's enjoy a glass
May it flow just like a faucet every time you ask
Got the trunk like I was Luke and the Two Live Crews
Minus one, burger moves, let the lions loose
Retainin' ownership is all I want in this
Maybe two Phantoms, a bad one, ain't got a bone to pick
Somebody tried to kill me, still I'm optimistic
Told the detectives, "Fuck 'em" and I bought a rocket missile
Bathin' Ape draped on my label-mates
You not a boss 'til everybody at your table ate (Maybach Music)
100 bands on me, really that's my sneaker money
'Cause when they land, they be whiter than the Easter bunny
Cuban links on me like I'm triple platinum
The triple beam still up in my kitchen cabinet

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Triple platinum
Triple platinum
Hundred room mansion nigga like I'm triple platinum
More money than them niggas that went triple platinum
Triple platinum
Triple platinum
Double M all these niggas like we triple platinum
Goin' hard, gangsta, triple platinum
Triple platinum
Forty cars like I'm triple platinum
Four hundred acres like I'm triple platinum
