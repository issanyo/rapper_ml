[Intro]
I know all about broke and stugglin
I'm still in that boat
Scrilla, what up?
On them days when them nuisances
Made me look for a rope

[Verse 1]
To whom it may a offend, this here's the realest shit I wrote
I'm tired of other people's problems
I would much rather be alone
I'm tired of niggas shook and jivin'
I'm tired of hoes on my bone, with nothing intriguing to say
I'm tired of being at home
I'm tired of wakin' up, blazin' up, layin' up, savin' up
I don't make enough and I'm tired of places tellin' me no
I'm tired of livin this way, I'm tryna be out on that road
No disrespect to my queen, but I'm always after my dough
She know I'm always on the go, she may not see me no mo'
If I decide to go home, can't get me out of my zone
It's like them days get long and nigga them nights get cold
And if we longer enough in this world, we might can grow old
I still know all about broke and struggle
I been there before
It'll keep you down and keep you dying
Like there's a whale in that boat
But even if it ain't sunny I glow
Said even when it ain't sunny I glow
And if it ain't about money then I don't go no where
I'm nailed to the flo'

[Hook: 2x]

But even if it ain't sunny I glow
Said even when it ain't sunny I glow
And if it ain't about money then I don't go no where
I'm nailed to the flo' (to the flo!)

[Verse 2]
I'm always stressin' out for that cash flow
That cheddar, that dough
Shit keep me down, it keep me down, it's a whale in my boat
I know all about struggle, right now I'm tryna stay a float
But it seem like money all on my want
That bitch the sail to my boat
And it got me doing thangs that my parents seen and they gone tell me no
Gotta keep some sails in my coat
Even thought about sellin my soul
There ain't no heaven for hustlas, I guess to hell I'm gone go
In a pair of these gasoline draw
Bustin these raps that I flow
Oh and I be trappin for sho' cause I ain't goin back to broke
I get better with time, yall get wack as yall go
So whether it's trafficking coke
I'mma do whatever I gotta to stack a wot of them dollas
Forever I'm after my dough
What you harassing me fo? What you keep askin' me fo?
If it ain't about money, I'm def
Other wise just pass me some dro
8 Ball, MJG, UGK, Tre and Z-Ro my heroes
Let go my nuts, get off my tip, let me release my ego

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 3]
I'm only focused on cheese, but I got every right to
May Buddha bless them niggas that scheming on me, no need to be spiteful
But not dumb but I'm go dump
I know how to shoot a rifle
The bigger is the harder he fall make it tower like to Eiffel
I told you 8 Ball, MJG, Jay-Z, A.B. in my idols
I wanted to be just like you, trappin the surface my rivals
They still underground status, my rhyme book look like a bible
Truly a savior, they treat my shit like rules from the bible

[Hook: 2x]
