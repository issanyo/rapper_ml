[Intro: Scrilla and (Young Jeezy)]
Look I ball, I stunt

[Hook: Scrilla]
Look I ball, I stunt
I can have any bitch I want
I can buy everything I need
Blowin this money like it grow on trees
You and ya gang ain’t runnin these streets
We all got straps we ain't worried bout these
Better check your ho ‘fore you come check me
You think she sweet we gon’ pull out the heat
And we gon' ride
We gon' pull out the five
We gon’ pull out the five
And if you try
We gon’ pull out the five
Talk shit and you die
Cuz we gon’ ride
We gon’ pull out the five
We gon’ pull out the five
And if you try
We gon’ pull out the five
Talk shit and you die
Because

I Ball, I stunt
I can have any bitch I want
I can buy everything I need
Blowin this money like it grow on trees
You and ya gang ain’t runnin' these streets
We all got straps we ain't worried bout these
Better check your ho ‘fore you come check me
You think she sweet we gon’ pull out the heat

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I ball (I ball), I stunt (I stunt)
I’m still that nigga don’t front
White four door porsche out front
I can buy any brick I want
I got my niggas and they both see the bag
So much trap money smell like crack
So much trap money feel like a trap
God damn y’all we don’t know it like that
I ball, I stunt
I can have any bitch I want
She gon’ give me any bitch I need
Hold my pistol lemme roll my weed
Stones on stone blocks make me sick
Blocks on blocks that’s how I got rich
Racks on racks ’till they get on my nerves
When I’m blowing death start counting up the birds
How you gon fly you ain't got no wings
Coupe so fly lookin' like it need wings
Look at your nigga like he gettin that cream
Look at your nigga like he gettin ‘em things
Big boy paper on deck, naw mean?
Big boy choppas on deck, naw mean?
Shit sound good fuck nigga won’t try
He already know we pullin out that five

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Scrilla]
I’m stuntin your ho she rushed nigga
We all got heat like Bosh nigga
We blow money fast like Ross nigga
All lame ass niggas get lost nigga
We ball all night show off nigga
Don’t give a damn about the cost nigga
I’m sending them [?] I’m lost nigga
Don’t take no shit I jaw nigga
Don’t fuck on my face on flo nigga
Better learn how to talk to a boss nigga
Got a whole bunch of niggas that'll deal with ya
I don’t need no aim, I’mma still hit ya
Spend 50 on the cane, make a nigga day
Choppa go dumb like I bought it from the bay
No line gang, we up in here
We go on all the goons give ‘em all Rozay
Rollin’ up kush we gon’ blow all day
Quick to check a ho, better know your place
Money in my pocket, money in the safe
And when we hit the club we throw in money in ya face
The bank just called, said the check just cleared
Standing on the couch with me and my litter
No line gang, we up in here
And everybody know that [?]

[Hook]

[Outro x2: Scrilla]
