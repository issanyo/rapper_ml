[Intro: NBA YoungBoy]
Look
Free my niggas out the can
Nigga, this that crazy man
I ain't even put no effort, crazy man

[Hook: NBA YoungBoy]
Draw down with that Glock, bitch don't make no sound
Say somethin', might get shot bitch, face down to the ground
I ain't got no respect aye, you might think I'm dumb
I'm just 17, with a whole lotta money
Fuck you, bitch I hopped up out that coupe
Tell me hoe, if you don't like me why you worried about what I do
You ain't see the car I pulled up in so you might think I flew
Tell me why you say that YoungBoy?
Cause bitch I'm flyer than your dude

[Verse 1: NBA YoungBoy]
If you think I fuck with that lil hoe, then you a fool
I ain't got no education, I dropped out of school
No security with me so I'm strapped up with that tool
Try to take my jewelry off and you gon' make the news bitch
Cuban links around my neck, it cost me 22 bitch
Audemar Piguet, coulda' went and bought a school bitch
Went to Neiman Marcus for my pants and my shoes bitch
Five thousands dollars, what I paid for the whole fit
I just took a loss so I'm goin' on a heist bitch
Hold a tool in yo face like chino do a bike bitch
Too much money on me for to raise my hands and fight bitch
Thunder in my clip, fuck around get hit with light bitch

[Hook: NBA YoungBoy]
Draw down with that Glock, bitch don't make no sound
Say somethin', might get shot bitch, face down to the ground
I ain't got no respect aye, you might think I'm dumb
I'm just 17, with a whole lotta money
Fuck you, bitch I hopped up out that coupe
Tell me hoe, if you don't like me why you worried about what I do
You ain't see the car I pulled up in so you might think I flew
Tell me why you say that YoungBoy?
Cause bitch I'm flyer than your dude

[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Wait, I'm really focused, they talking bullshit
But they still listen to my old shit
Listen lil bitch, I still got money from some old shit
Listen lil bitch, I empty clips and then reload it
I get more attention when I'm with my Louie Loafers
All my whips is tinted so they love to pull me over
You a sherm nigga, word nigga, yous a joker
My whip is matte black, I used to ride in the Toyota yeah
Now I'm slumpin' niggas over yeah
Niggas got they ten toes up yeah
Heart started gettin' colder yeah
Lil bitch you don't know us yeah

[Hook: NBA YoungBoy]
Draw down with that Glock, bitch don't make no sound
