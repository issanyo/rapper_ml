[Intro]
Go
Swiff D
Say three
I'ma show these bitches who the realest on here
Banginâ€™ my whole life, real blood
I got no feelings, you hear me? I dog anybody (slatt)
How y'all wan' do it?
Ya hear me? I'm too influent (slatt, slatt, slatt)
Yeah, and I still got the system tryna hang me nigga
We ain't never scared
No we gon' play however we want to

[Verse 1]
Back in 2009, I had jumped in the street, I was totin' a .9
I could tell he ain't 'bout it, ain't never slung iron
Now they stuck at the bottom and wait on they time
I got locked in a cell, had to walk on that line
You could see all my pain when you look in my eyes
Fell in love with a bitch, she was tellin' me lies
I relapsed, I got back, that was time after time
Quarter brick the most I ever sold in my life
When these niggas be talkin', they fuck with my mind
When it's war, I be screamin' out "do or you die"
We gon spin on yo' block when it's time for the ride
In the valley with Dump, now he fly in the sky
Why they stepped on my nigga, I don't know why
Bitch you know that it's up, ain't no way you can hide
If you buck, you get bust nigga, load up and ride

[Chorus]
Let's rock and roll, I can feel that fire growin' inside me
I done blow and they must like it, it totally got me higher, yeah
One in a hole, I'ma live my life like I'm a Gotti
Hope my killer ain't onside me
Death come and it surspise me, yeah

[Bridge]
Steady be dishin' out smoke, I know I won't make it to heaven
You know that it's set, we can go, just tell me whenever you ready
Steady be dishin' out smoke, I know I won't make it to heaven
You know that it's set, we can go, just tell me whenever you ready

[Verse 2]
Back in the day, no money in my pocket, it's filled with them crumbs, yeah (them crumbs, yeah)
Wanted the title, facin' any rival, I show 'em it's dumb, yeah (show 'em it's dumb)
No love for these niggas, no faith in these bitches, I'm trustin' my gun, yeah (my gun)
I done ran up my riches, I'm straight out them trenches, screamin' "redrum", yeah
I had some shots out right in front of the store
I see some niggas passin' on a roll
I had that strap on side me on the porch
Not holdin' them bullets, I'm lettin' it go
Got some rocks in my britches, they shaped like the Glo'
And these niggas be trippin', they act like some hoes
I could say I'm hard body and I ain't never fold
I come straight from the bottom, nigga I done blow

[Chorus]
Let's rock and roll, I can feel that fire growin' inside me
I done blow and they must like it, it totally got me higher, yeah
One in a hole, I'ma live my life like I'm a Gotti
Hope my killer ain't onside me
Death come and it surspise me, yeah

[Outro]
Let's rock and roll, I can feel that fire growin' inside me
I done blow and they must like it, it totally got me higher, yeah
One in a hole, I'ma live my life like I'm a Gotti
Hope my killer ain't onside me
Death come and it surspise me, yeah
Yeah
