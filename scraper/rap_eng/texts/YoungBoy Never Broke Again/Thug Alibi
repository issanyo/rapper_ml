[Chorus]
Mama I'm sorry from the way that I live
Gotta go hard, yeah you know how it is
Know you don't like it but I stay with my steel
You know I stood on all 10 if I ever get killed
Niggas want smoke but I ain't scared
I walk alone, I'll never be misled
Say that wrong thing, put one in yo' head
I say my prayers and put a cross over my head

[Verse 1]
NBA gang around my neck, you know I run with that nigga
You steady sayin' what you gon' do, you better stand on that nigga
We catch you swervin' in my section, goin' down on you nigga
I'm 'bout my business, I'll never stand down from a nigga
Nigga had the nerve to question me in front of my sister
I'm too small for to fight but I'll scuff with a nigga
Steady speakin' on my name, gon' take yo' life from you nigga
My lil' partner like "Mane who next?"
This excitin' to that nigga
Me and Montana layin' low, duckin' from police cars
Get you in and scoop lil' Baby Joe and bring him to Valley Park
Them niggas out here who been killin', they don't know who they are
These niggas knowin' that we with it, bitch you know who we are
Where we from, what we rep, these niggas know that we step
All my niggas went to school, I hit a lick by myself
Them niggas ain't gon' ride for you, bitch you gon' die by yourself
They ain't my friends, I ain't no fool
I'ma spin by myself
(Believe that)

[Chorus]
Mama I'm sorry from the way that I live
Gotta go hard, yeah you know how it is
Know you don't like it but I stay with my steel
You know I stood on all 10 if I ever get killed
Niggas want smoke but I ain't scared
I walk alone, I'll never be misled
Say that wrong thing, put one in yo' head
I say my prayers and put a cross over my head

[Verse 2]
Mama say "Yo' wrong is gon' catch up to you"
"You kill, they gon' kill you too"
They steppin' ma we steppin' too
My uncle looked me in my eyes, "Don't let a nigga step on you"
23 up on my shoe, .223 up in this coupe
In front the police, shoot at me and bitch I'm bustin' back
Shoot a nigga in his head, won't shoot him in his back
First hundred thousand dollars, I went bought a hundred straps
This shit personal, it ain't got nothin' to do with rap
I know my grandma mad at me, I ain't grow up this way
I know my mama scared but I know that she alway pray
You could be in the streets or not, ain't nobody safe
We on this earth just for to die, we all gotta lay

[Chorus]
Mama I'm sorry from the way that I live
Gotta go hard, yeah you know how it is
Know you don't like it but I stay with my steel
You know I stood on all 10 if I ever get killed
Niggas want smoke but I ain't scared
I walk alone, I'll never be misled
Say that wrong thing, put one in yo' head
I say my prayers and put a cross over my head
