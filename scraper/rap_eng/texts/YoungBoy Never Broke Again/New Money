Ah
(808 Mafia)

[Chrous: SpaceJam Bo]
Remember way back in the days
When homies they called me a junkie
I remember back in 7th grade
My teacher, she called me a flunkie
Don't know how you getting paid
But imma go get me some money
And I'll get new money, don't know what to do money

Remember way back in the days
When homies they called me a junkie
I remember back in 7th grade
My teacher, she called me a flunkie
Don't know how you getting paid
But imma go get me some money
And I'll get new money, don't know what to do money

[Verse 1: SpaceJam Bo]
I keep a gun on my side
A-A-Ask a lil bih "Wan ride?"
Thats a pole ready to slide
Tell em we gon be behind
I send a bar to yo head
Is go be a homicide
Have yo momma cryin'
Somebody son dying
Babygirl know I be lying
She say she luh me she lying
Tol her I take her home flying
My child want the world im buying
Want diamonds and pearls Im buying
Quite that jocien you nerds are lying
Milly rock on that curve me line
I remeber when 12 was spying
I was so homless was crying
Erbody had tol me stop trying
Now they wanna take pics I dont mind
I don't trust you but gotta be kind
For my bro put my life on the line
Forever you know that im ridin
Forever you know that Im slidn
From that bag you can run but can't hide

[Verse 2: NBA YoungBoy]
Old Money, New Money
I still got old hundreds
Six 0 Glock 40
I still walk widd it on me
I used to ask papa for money
If he had it, he gave me a 20
I used to steal cars
Now I thank the lord
I can walk around with a hundred large
From Rachet hoes to the Forein broads
I'm pullin' up in a foreign car
I'm just a street nigga
I stay with my pistol
I swear to god, that I am not a star
Was locked in that cell, going through hell
Remember I was countin' all them bars
Just for a twelve, I counted up twelve and I blow that shit with all my boys
This life that im livin
My bitches explicit I swea I came up from them trenches
You know I ain't slippin' I stay with a glizzy
A nigga run up he ca get it
I completed my mission I played my role
Now nigga check out how im get it
See this shit where I play through the city
Ready ta die you know I ain't trippin



[Chorus: SpaceJam Bo]
Remember way back in the days
When homies they called me a junkie

My teacher, she called me a flunkie
Don't know how you getting paid
But imma go get me some money
And I'll get new money, don't know what to do money

Remember way back in the days
When homies they called me a junkie
I remember back in 7th grade
My teacher, she called me a flunkie
Don't know how you getting paid
But imma go get me some money
And I'll get new money, don't know what to do money
