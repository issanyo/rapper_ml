[Chorus]
It ain't a dream, it's really what it seems
Gotta get that moolah 'fore you end up on a T
Shoutout to that lil' nigga got hit up at 16
It's a shame, he ain't get to live his dream
You can win or lose when you thuggin' in these streets
I won't make a move without my gun by any means
I heard they lookin' but ain't never where I be
But nigga when we meet, yea we gon' see (ah, Youngboy)

[Verse 1]
I heard that they comin', you know I ain't runnin'
I'm on top my city, they won't put me under
Everyday shit get gutter so I keep a burner
Called me at the corner, shoulda listened to my fuckin' number
From the bottom of the barrel, I came out runnin'
100 shots on the bottom of the barrel, ain't no fuckin' runner
Told lies, they wasn't loyal or they wasn't 100
Soon as we touch, they gon' get touched, keep that on the under
Watch what you say 'cause when you say it, it's gon' hit the streets
Ready for to go to war with whoever want it with me
You gon' die for speakin' on a nigga, put money on me
They could try, watch how many die, right before I leave
Extendo tote 'em, a lotta shit come with the game
I seen niggas change, I seen bitches change
I fuck with Dino, yeah the real flame
Send McKayla up a corner [?] and ain't want a thang
I do this shit for my lil' brudda, can't forget the gang
Gettin' to that paper, got more players in NBA
Tell 'em freaky dogs got that cage
Open up your eyes, this shit ain't a game

[Chorus]
It ain't a dream, it's really what it seems
Gotta get that moolah 'fore you end up on a T
Shoutout to that lil' nigga got hit up at 16
It's a shame, he ain't get to live his dream
You can win or lose when you thuggin' in these streets
I won't make a move without my gun by any means
I heard they lookin' but ain't never where I be
But nigga when we meet, yea we gon' see (ah)

[Verse 2]
Man this shit get wicked, you can get it, I stay with that hammer
I can't let you kill me, open fire, I'm forever lasting
Them lil' boys shot at me the other day, I gotta bam 'em
Pull up where I saw 'em trappin, [?] that power, I work that hammer
Real diamond round my neck lil' nigga, I dare you to snatch 'em
You know that the gang don't spare 'em, you know that we gotta stab 'em
All these hoes surround us, young niggas who made it happen
These niggas they hate on us, but bitch nigga know they can have it

[Chorus]
It ain't a dream, it's really what it seems
Gotta get that moolah 'fore you end up on a T
Shoutout to that lil' nigga got hit up at 16
It's a shame, he ain't get to live his dream
You can win or lose when you thuggin' in these streets
I won't make a move without my gun by any means
I heard they lookin' but ain't never where I be
But nigga when we meet, yea we gon' see (ah, look)
