[Intro]
This for my nigga Whop Bezzy
Oh my fucking god
I ain't gon' waste no time on this bitch

[Chorus]
Hop out with that cutter, let it bang and knock yo' leg off
Shoot your gun at me and, bitch, I bet we have a stand off
Screaming "fuck the judge" until them bitches let my mans out
Everybody wanna be the same but I'ma stand out
Brought my niggas in the club and they gon' thug with me
I just snuck my .40 in this bitch and I'ma thug with it
Let a nigga sneak me in this club it's gon' be up with it
Everybody with me full of drugs don't give a fuck with it
In this bitch with Subbo nigga bring the line out
Fresh up out that slammer with that hammer out my mind now
Bitches talking shit like we ain't with it we gon' ride down
Slide with them cutters it's a must you bitches die now

[Verse]
Bitch, you must ain't hear my niggas, we go back to back
My brother never worried 'bout that, my nigga, we gon' handle that
Runnin' from the system with that Glock up in my Gucci sack
Play and we gon' send them bitches right where Nene Lulu at
To heaven since he claim that he steppin', that be that murder talk
Rep it like he killin', pussy bitch, I never heard of y'all
Fifty-thousand dirt, all of y'all
On the plane when the police call
And I won't say a thing, go 'gainst the grain, we gon' burn all of y'all (let's go)
Bitch, I got a hundred rounds who claim they want it with me, yeah
I'm with some youngins out the north, they gon' go under with me, yeah
I'm on my top Iâ€™m with the shit, I put that burner on 'em, yeah
Shoot him in his shit just like the last gorilla, nigga, yeah
Throwin' slangs, well bitch I caught what you said
Right there in Dixie, catch you slippin' send them shots where you at
I know they hating that I'm up so they can't wait til' I'm dead
Well bitch come get the job done you know we living like that
Got 50 shots up in the Glock
This bitch here come out Atlanta
I let Montana drive the car I with my son in the Phantom
Them niggas play I'ma clap 'em
I drop that bag, back to back 'em
That other boy was talking shit well nigga look what done happened

[Chorus]
Hop out with that cutter, let it bang and knock yo' leg off
Shoot your gun at me and, bitch, I bet we have a stand off
Screaming "fuck the judge" until them bitches let my mans out
Everybody wanna be the same but I'ma stand out
Brought my niggas in the club and they gon' thug with me
I just snuck my .40 in this bitch and I'ma thug with it
Let a nigga sneak me in this club it's gon' be up with it
Everybody with me full of drugs don't give a fuck with it
In this bitch with Subbo nigga bring the line out
Fresh up out that slammer with that hammer out my mind now
Bitches talking shit like we ain't with it we gon' ride now
Slide with them cutters it's a must you bitches die now
