[Intro]
Only Sixteen

[Verse 1]
I'm on the phone with lil' mane, tryna see the move
It's in the streets so you know I'm goin' with my mood
I got a shoota' on my side every time I move
Say he plottin' when he try, put him on the news
I'm head huncho of that gang, and I call shots
These niggas runnin' to the laws when we let off shots
I leave the house protected when up in the block
XL magazine hangin' off the Glock
I stop by OG Beanie for to get some purple
I got a lot on my mind so I roll up
If you know me then you know I ain't no hoe
How the fuck you bring them niggas in my circle
If it ain't about the guap, you can't talk 'bout nothin'
I'm the sickest with this shit, you know how I'm comin'
I go ape, but I'm still king of the jungle
Before I stand down, gotta put me under
I'm in the north, nigga you know where to find us
I'm with that gang and you knowin' that we strapped up
Lotta shots, no we don't need no backup
All that reppin' like you steppin' get you lined up
Everywhere I go you know I keep that iron tucked
Just in case I run into some problems
Never sleepin', keep it with me, nigga run up he gon' get it
Any interferences you know we ain't trippin'
When it's time for to beefin' runnin' to the choppas
Let down the window when it hit, all you see is fire
Do anything in the world for my sister, momma
Fuck a bitch, I don't talk to my baby mama
And I better not hear my name flyin' through the wind
Make me send Pap for to spin the Benz
I appreciate the love but don't need the fame
I just want the money, I don't want no friends
Deno knockin' at the door, let him come inside
Ben wet em up, somebody want a 35
Cold hearted, lost my mind when Lil Dave died
Uncle told, know my daddy doin' fifty five
187, 211 it's a homicide
Strapped up choppas with us when we take the ride
Thirty niggas sendin' shots from the other side
We gon' see who gon' ride when you niggas die
Dave gone nigga hit my dog with a choppa
Come round the building, caught him slippin', Pap say he got him
NBA GG, we don't do no partners
Catch the fool, we gon' burn him and his partner
Gettin' money, gang gang, no I won't change
Somebody rattin' how they knew about the purp & the codeine
The moral of the story's the money, mane
I ain' trustin' he too deep, so I'm hustlin' with my team
I can't wait 'til I get on, for my gang I got 'em
Half everything I'ma give it to my momma
Me and P gon' live it up cause we was robbin' for the dollaz
Time in the cage for the love of the money
Walked in with my gang... with my gang NBA
It ain't no turn down, turn up to the morning
Whole lotta money
Walked to one side and them bad bitches followin'

[Outro]
Broke niggas, I don't get along with 'em
Walked in just me and my niggas (Just me and my gang)
Bad bitches follow us when we hit the door, heard spyder gang came with us
Bitches want your money, niggas want your fame
Some locked up, Some put up in the grave
On Lil Dave, gang gang, no I won't change
The moral of the story's the money, mane

Broke niggas, I don't get along with 'em
Walked in just me and my niggas (Just me and my gang)
Bad bitches follow us when we hit the door, heard spyder gang came with us
Bitches want your money, niggas want your fame
Some locked up, Some put up in the grave
On Lil Dave, gang gang, no I won't change
The moral of the story's the money, mane
