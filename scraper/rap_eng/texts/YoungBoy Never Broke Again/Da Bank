[Verse: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
VVS on my chain, [?] on my ring
I put dope with the gang, then we hop out with that thang
You know that we play with them K's
Then nigga don't get in my way
F*ck around and get shot in your face if you try to stop me from getting paid
Tell 'em run up on my boy, I dare 'em
All this money got the bitches staring, nigga hatin', I don't care
Try to rob me, I'mma slay 'emI tell 'em everything's [?]
I know that they hate, I prevail, pussy I never fail
I'm still screamin' f*ck 12, yeah I know you tryna smell
Me and [?] takin' over the year and they don't want us on XXL, but we still runnin' 'round causin' hell
NBA all over the gear, Rich Forever nigga that's what it is
You ain't with a nigga, you would go tell
Whole lotta money nigga, flex on parole


[Chorus: Famous Dex]
All this money, I might have it in the bank, huh
Diamonds on me, f*ck around and make you famous, woah
Talkin' money yeah, I be on that same shit, with my gang, bitch we dangerous, you can't hang with this
All this money, I might have it in the bank, huh
Diamonds on me, f*ck around and make you famous, woah
Talkin' money yeah, I be on that same shit, with my gang, bitch we dangerous, you can't hang with this
