[Verse 1: OMB Peezy]
I been goin' through some things
Said can I take some time and vent?
I was strugglin', now I got different struggles now that I'm gettin' rich
Ain't that a shame, how rugged this shit get
Bet they see a nigga with a stack or somethin' and they beg to suck a nigga's dick
Been through the rain
You'll watch a nigga get soaked
That's your brother nigga, say you love the nigga
How you watch a nigga stay broke?
Same way I came, I ain't changing up on my bros
Know a nigga that I called brother talking to them other niggas, breaking codes
Niggas be lame, so I'm gon' paralyze 'em for real
Came a long way from popping them pills
Play the wrong way and I'll get you killed
Fuck a lil' fame, I signed a deal for them bills
Tote the paper, I show up where you live
Have them things clapping just like a seal
Can't nobody understand how it feel
All this money cannot dry up your tears
I be paranoid, how we gon' chill?
Fuck the road, I be watching the mirror
Grip the Glock, got my knee on the wheel
This shit for real
Nobody gon' care 'til you thumbing through a mil
'Cause don't nobody love you when you doing bad
They forget about the times you had, look
'Cause when you go broke they leave you in the past
You know, good things, they don't ever last, Peezy

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Don't nobody love you when you doing bad
They forget about the times you had
Ain't nobody gon' hold you down like you, that's a fact
Time to move forward and stop looking back
But I'm going through some things my nigga
(My nigga, been going through some things)
Kinda hard to ease the pain my nigga
(My nigga, kinda hard to ease the pain)
I been goin' through some things my nigga

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Man I swear that they ain't feelin' my pain
I just smile through it all, you know that I won't change, ayy
For so long I been stuck in the rain
I been chasing after money before I was a teen, yeah
This for the ones look up to me, just do your own thing
This shit look good but I promise it ain't what it seems
I'm on the road with my team tryna catch my dream
These niggas hatin', they don't like me, they wanna kill me
But I'm like fuck 'em, I'm clutchin', YoungBoy you know I be thuggin'
Me and my niggas we on it, you run up on me I bust it
Fuck a handout, remember they ain't wan' give me nothing
I'ma stand out and never ask these rappers for nothing
I got them killers they on go, bitch I just push a button
Hardhead, let me record the hot shit for much of nothing
Monique had paid for my first session when I was just a youngin
Nigga death before dishonor, I do this for the youngins

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Don't nobody love you when you doing bad
They forget about the times you had
Ain't nobody gon' hold you down like you, that's a fact
Time to move forward and stop looking back
But I'm going through some things my nigga
(My nigga, been going through some things)
Kinda hard to ease the pain my nigga
(My nigga, kinda hard to ease the pain)
I been goin' through some things my nigga

[Verse 3: OMB Peezy]
This shit deeper than ever
I been stressing daily, sorry baby you someone I don't need in my schedule
People been callin' me crazy, ain't been talkin', I'm tryna get it together
Swear my heart been freezing, your presence ain't needed, say you gon' leave them whatever
Say you gon' leave them whatever, people done left me in the rain without an umbrella
Have you ever been in a holding cell, dialing numbers and nobody can help ya?
Summertime sleeping in the fuckin' car, skin stick to the leather
When me and the judge was goin' to fuckin' war you wouldn't send me a letter

[Bridge: OMB Peezy]
When I was out there on that block you told me I should do better
Now I'm tryna get up to the top, you won't stop a lil nigga
I swear them leeches will suck your ass dry if you let 'em
And when it hurt ain't nobody gon' stop unless you tell 'em
When I was out there on that block you told me I should do better
Now I'm tryna get up to the top, you won't stop a lil nigga
I swear them leeches will suck your ass dry if you let 'em
And when it hurt ain't nobody gon' stop unless you tell 'em

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Don't nobody love you when you doing bad
They forget about the times you had
Ain't nobody gon' hold you down like you, that's a fact
Time to move forward and stop looking back
But I'm going through some things my nigga
(My nigga, been going through some things)
Kinda hard to ease the pain my nigga
(My nigga, kinda hard to ease the pain)
Don't nobody love you when you doing bad
They forget about the times you had
Ain't nobody gon' hold you down like you, that's a fact
Time to move forward and stop looking back
But I'm going through some things my nigga
(My nigga, been going through some things)
Kinda hard to ease the pain my nigga
(My nigga, kinda hard to ease the pain)
I been goin' through some things my nigga
