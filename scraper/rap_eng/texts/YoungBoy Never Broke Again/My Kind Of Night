[Chorus]
Tell you what you wanna hear show you what you like
Ain't no regrets baby this my kind of night
10 for me and 10 for you to make it through the night
Told me that she down and i told her sure you right
Tell you what you wanna hear show you what you like
Ain't no regrets baby this my kind of night
10 for me and 10 for you to make it through the night
Told me that she down and i told her sure you right

[Verse 1]
She said "Oh my god I love you " I told that bitch stop it
You can come but we won't beg you know how we rocking
You can bring your friend we won't tell nobody
For to be inside that gang you gotta be a rider
You gotta be down to come and kick how I kick it
Me and my niggas we the realest you know we the sickest
We pull up on the scence mobbin' flexing with them benjis
We in the club popping bottles champagne shower living
Whole lotta hundreds in my pockets

Come on let's get outta here you know I got it

[Chorus]
Tell you what you wanna hear show you what you like
Ain't no regrets baby this my kind of night
10 for me and 10 for you to make it through the night
Told me that she down and i told her sure you right
Tell you what you wanna hear show you what you like
Ain't no regrets baby this my kind of night
10 for me and 10 for you to make it through the night
Told me that she down and i told her sure you right
