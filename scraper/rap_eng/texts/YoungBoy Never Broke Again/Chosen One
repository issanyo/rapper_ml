[Intro: Kodak Black & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Project Baby
NFL, never forget loyalty
And I'm never going broke again
Woah, yeah
Oh

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Through all this heartbreak and this pain I can't change
Through the betrayal and the rain I stayed the same
I promise you that I'ma leave how I came
Gotta stop playin', now it's time to be a man
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one, yeah
The chosen one, yeah
I'm a champion
I'm the chosen one, yeah
I'm a champion

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Late at night no I can't sleep, I'm like oh
I got demons in my dreams, man I know
I just drop down to my knees, to the floor
I start praying to my god to make 'em go
I was young when grandmama died nigga
Take a look up in my eyes nigga
I'll never be disguised nigga
Say you know me, tell me how do you figure?
Working hard, now my name getting bigger
Comin' up I grew up 'round killing
Swear that I'm traumatized nigga
My hopes to the ceiling
Hurt and I need some healing
Gotta do better for my children
I can't give up on my mission

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Through all this heartbreak and this pain I can't change
Through the betrayal and the rain I stay the same
I promise you that I'ma leave how I came
Gotta stop playin', now it's time to be a man
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one, yeah
The chosen one, yeah
I'm a champion
I'm the chosen one, yeah
I'm a champion

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Don't let nobody tell you different, you the greatest
Project baby and I'm a baby with a baby
And mama I been goin' back crazy again
I'm going back crazy
Dancing with the devil, fighting demons
My lady hate the way that I be sleeping
Chosen one, it took so long for me to see it in me
I remember when I didn't even believe in me
I be going hard, never exaggerate it
I be going hard nigga
I be going hard never over exaggerate
Yeah the real ones stay here, the fake evaporate
Draco baby, K banana clip, gon' chop an eight
But I love them shell catchers, keep a thirty-eight
90's baby catching burglaries or a murder case
Free Lil Turk, he caught thirty
I done grew up way too quick, too early
Thirty on me, Stephen Curry, use my jersey
I'm a warrior, that be my jersey
Free G Pharaoh, damn they did you dirty
NBA money, balling like I'm Stephen Curry
Blue hundreds like a peacock, I got them birdies
