Every time I need that shit, Devil make another

[Chorus: OG 3Three]
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga, you
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga, you

[Verse 1: OG 3Three]
Bitch I'm outside, you know Three with it
I stay with my strap, you know I sleep with it
Every time it's a murder, they think we did it
Ain't no rap cap, we don't beef with niggas
Body after body, raise the murder rate
I'm Caesar 'round this motherfuckin' planet of the apes
I fuck with Bloods, I fuck with G's, I'm fuckin' with them Grapes
I make a call, they come and snatch you out your fuckin' plate
What you mean, this shit ain't green, I'm runnin' the scene boy
We got pounds, we got pills, we got lean boy
NBA my gang, and we got mob ties
And for you fuck niggas, bitch I'm outside

[Chorus: OG 3Three]
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga, you
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga, you
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga, you
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch I'm outside, why you hidin'? why you hidin'?
Bitch I'm outside, why you hidin'? why you hidin'?
Bitch I'm outside, why you hidin'? why you hidin'?
Bitch I'm outside, why you hidin'? why you hidin'?
Bitch

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Five drums in the car, over four hundred shots when we be ridin'
He say he want smoke then you know that we slidin'
Fire come out the barrel whenever we firin'
Slip on that boy with the Glock in the closet
Smokin' a black and I hear nothin' but sirens
Fall off the ladder again, I climb it
Smoke from the takey be changing the climate, yeah
38 on my necklace
You know that it's smoke if you playin' with me
Wherever you at, bitch you up in my reach
Catch him down bad, leave him dead in the street
Yeah, I'm movin' too fast, yeah, gotta slow down 'fore I crash, yeah
3Three on your ass, yeah, hop out on 'em with MAC, yeah

[Chorus: OG 3Three]
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga, you
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga, you
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga, you
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch I'm outside, why you hidin'? why you hidin'?
Bitch I'm outside, why you hidin'? why you hidin'?
Bitch I'm outside, why you hidin'? why you hidin'?
Bitch I'm outside, why you hidin'? why you hidin'?
