[Intro]
You know Im a real nigga, you might ask me for something, Lil' Ben might tell me No but you know I'ma give it to you

[Chorus]
You choose him over me, shit I guess that's cause I'm younger
He can't love you, like I love you and know that that's one hundred
I'ma make sure you that you shine baby, even when it's storming
When I get the chance I'ma fuck you like no other
Have you ever made love to a youngin
Have you ever made love to a young nigga
Pull up in that lamb, jump out like wazzam?
Let me be there for you baby, let me make you laugh
I won't hide a thing, I'ma show you who I am
I won't judge you off your past, you know I don't give a damn

[Verse 1]
You say you got a boyfriend, well let me be your friend
Baby matter fact, let me be your helping hand
I ain't tryna get up in your business girl, I'm just saying
Maybe I can treat you way better than your man
I pull up in that lamb, let you drive me around
I put my flex down, every time I'm in your town
Ain't gotta move too fast baby let me make you smile
Let me be your man, we been doing this for a while
I'ma fuck you real good when I get you in the bed
Think of everything I said, baby I'ma give you head
Rather show you than to tell you baby better enough than said
If he put his hands on you baby then that nigga dead

[Chorus]
You choose him over me shit I guess that's cause I'm younger
He can't love you, like I love you and know that that's one hundred
I'ma make sure you that you shine baby, even when it's storming
When I get the chance I'ma fuck you like no other
Have you ever made love to a yungin
Have you ever made love to a young nigga
Pull up in that lamb, jump out like wazzam?
Let me be there for you baby, let me make you laugh
I won't hide a thing, I'ma show you who I am
I won't judge you off your past, you know I don't give a damn

[Verse 2]
You tellin' me bout age, but I feel that just a number
If they ask about me tell 'em that I'm yo lil nigga
Gang bracelet on my arm, baby that's just my lil symbol
Comfort you up in the summer baby even in the winter
Keep it real never lie to each other
Every time you ever need me I'ma be there for you
And I know that they don't like when we be stunnin' with each other
And you know we shinin' bright every time we together

[Chorus]
You choose him over me shit I guess that's cause I'm younger
He can't love you, like I love you and know that that's 1hunnit
I'ma make sure you that you shine baby, even when it's storming
When I get the chance I'ma fuck you like no other
Have you ever made love to a yungin, (to a yungin, to a yungin)
Have you ever made love to a young nigga, to a young nigga
Pull up in that lamb, jump out like wazzam?
Let me be there for you baby, let me make you laugh
I won't hide a thing, I'ma show you who I am
I won't judge you off your past, you know I don't give a damn
