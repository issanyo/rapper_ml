[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Little bitch, I'm flawless, why I'm too official
What you know bout gettin' a check and spending it with your niggas
All my niggas keep a gun no we ain't ever slippin'
What you know bout walkin' in your show strapped with a pistol

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Lil' bitch I'm flawless, why I'm too official
What you know bout gettin' a check and spending it with your niggas
All my niggas keep a gun no we ain't ever slippin'
What you know bout walkin' in your show strapped with a pistol
Won't throw my hands, my diamonds dance
I'm so high up in the sky don't wanna land
She gon' fuck me and Lil Uzi cause them bands
I might pull up in a 'Rari or a Lamb

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Fuck niggas keep fakin', you keep hatin' with your bitch ass
I'ma count these hundreds while I'm smackin' on your bitch ass
All hunnids they blue, ooh, stuntin' with my rich ass
My Rollie never tickin' and my boys they all are hitmen
Stay drippin' this swag, VVS that's what I'm drippin'
Rari yeah I'm dippin'
You can't see up in my whip 'cause all my windows tinted
Got your lil' bitch all up in it
No this not a rented, it say 200 the limit
Bitch I went 205, you get money that's a lie, uh
Cartier diamond on my eye, talk too slick get fired, uh
I put that right on my guys, pull up, oh my God, yeah
Only hit that lil' bitch twice, put that on my life, yeah

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Lil' bitch, I'm flawless, why I'm too official
What you know bout gettin' a check and spending it with your niggas
All my niggas keep a gun no we ain't ever slippin'
What you know bout walkin' in your show strapped with a pistol
Won't throw my hands, my diamonds dance
I'm so high up in the sky don't wanna land
She gon' fuck me and Lil Uzi 'cause them bands
I might pull up in a 'Rari or a Lamb

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Covered in Givenchy
Chains on me not rented
Ain't no cap, not kill
Lately, I been trendin'
Straight out the north, I got racks in the vault
I came from rags to riches
I live what I talk and you know that I'm with it
You little niggas know I ain't kiddin'
Brand new white coat, all white tiger no snow
Ice on my neck and it's froze
I got 20 more chains than a hoe
No relations I ain't trustin' these hoes
'less I fuck on her then she could go
What's wrong with me, don't know
Open a pint then I pour me a 4
I called the bank and ordered me a hunnid bands
These hoes be irkin' all that fake shit I can't stand
New niggas hatin' on the low they really fans
I want the 'Rari but I really want the Lamb

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Lil' bitch, I'm flawless, why I'm too official
What you know bout gettin' a check and spending it with your niggas
All my niggas keep a gun no we ain't ever slippin'
What you know bout walkin' in your show strapped with a pistol
Won't throw my hands, my diamonds dance
I'm so high up in the sky don't wanna land
She gon' fuck me and Lil Uzi cause them bands
I might pull up in a 'Rari or a Lamb

[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Little bitch, I'm flawless, yeah I'm too official
On the real, when you was gone, you probably thought I missed you
If you ever cry use, these hundreds as a tissue
So basically what I'm saying money is the main issue
Diamonds on my hand, I'ma count these bands
I don't want that little bitch, she got a man
New house got land, blue rubberbands
Yeah my diamonds, they be water like a dam
