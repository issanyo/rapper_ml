[Intro]
Woah, Dubba-AA flex
Ohhhh
Slime, Aye
Slatt, Slatt, Slatt, Slatt
And these people, they don't know, yeah
And that shit I never showed, yeah

[Verse 1]
So much shit I never told
I'ma show 'em I'm a man, I'ma get it on my own
Never speak on what you see, hold it in 'til I'm gone
On my sons, I ain't playin', hit a nigga with that chrome (pow, pow, pow)
I'm [?] like I'm steppin', yeah
Spinnin' through my section, yeah
Used to buy that ratchet, shootin' dice strapped with that Wesson, yeah
I'm prepared and I'm ready, yeah
Said that they gon' stretch me, yeah
Thuggin' for so long on a nigga for to test me, yeah (bitch)
They don't know my lingo, all I talk is C-note, invest in kilos
Strapped with a revolver every time I used to fuck with Dino
I know, he know, and she know that YoungBoy bust that nigga head
Know Ne know that I won't cheat, no told that bitch to close her legs, yeah
Had to get out the streets though
Still a commit, up kick door
Still be with the shit though
Go to Atlanta, buy a drink from Casino (drank)
Whole lot of money, whole lot of fame
Still run with the same clique though (gang)
You don't come how I come, so stay in your lane
You play and get shot in your shit though

[Pre-Chorus]
This for them niggas who be hustlin' every day, yeah
This for them niggas screamin' "fuck it," tote them Ks, yeah
This for them niggas quick to shoot you in your face, yeah
This for them niggas thuggin' 'til they in the grave, yeah

[Chorus]
I got that Glock on me
And I ain't stuntin', nigga think that he the dumbest
I'ma put that nigga under
I got them shots on me
I'm chasin' money, nigga play and I'ma burn him
I'm a Z, bitch I'm a zombie

[Verse 2]
Up with the Glock, and I'm bustin' his head (pow)
Back to back, steady be takin' them meds
This for them niggas that's locked in the feds
I'ma stand on everything I said
The beam on the choppa ain't green, it's red
He run up on me, get hit with this lead (pow)
Start it, then drive the McLaren in [?] (skrrt)
Start it, then I'm pullin' up where you stay (vroom, brrr)
Remove the plate and tape two clips up on the K
Can't find that nigga, we gon' burn him where he breathe, yeah (ahh)
Bitch, that's that heat, I'm forever in the streets
Thinkin' he could fuck with me, I'ma put that bitch to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
This for them niggas who be hustlin' every day, yeah
This for them niggas screamin' "fuck it," tote them Ks, yeah
This for them niggas quick to shoot you in your face, yeah
This for them niggas thuggin' 'til they in the grave, yeah

[Chorus]
I got that Glock on me
And I ain't stuntin', nigga think that he the dumbest
I'ma put that nigga under
I got them shots on me
I'm chasin' money, nigga play and I'ma burn him
I'm a Z, bitch I'm a zombie (slime)
