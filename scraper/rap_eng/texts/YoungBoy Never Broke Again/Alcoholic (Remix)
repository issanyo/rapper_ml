[Intro: Dylan the Teen & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Dylan
Aye, Pablo pass that shit (Yeah, haha, Pablo Juan)

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Jaun]
Ain't got no feelings, I want a million
Slayer, hustler, gangster, I'm a chameleon
Smoking gelato, get high as the ceilin'
Frederick Douglass, yeah they say I be killin'
Ice on my neck, I be chillin'
I want it all when them cils in
Dick in her mouth, she be grillin'
I'm Micheal Jackson in the Thriller
Yeah, I'm too real, I can't fuck with these niggas
I got two forty forties, I ain't jigga
I'm in New York and I still got the pistol
30 bitches, I got four different crystals
I make her suck on that dick, then I kiss her
She let me hit from the back, then I whip her
Blue hunnits in my pocket got me crippled
Drinkin' straight out the bottle like I miss her

[Hook: Dylan the Teen]
Wake up, I'm fuckin' faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Do this shit every weekend
I'm feeling so depleted
And I feel like I need it
I come on bended knee, and
I'm drinking away my feelings
I'm drinking just to be drinking
Wake up, I'm fuckin' faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Wake up, I'm fuckin faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Wake up, I'm fuckin faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Wake up, I'm fuckin faded
Wake up, still fuckin drinking

[Verse 2: Dylan the Teen]
Rae Sremm in the speakers, we pour up some more
Take a shot, this liquor's burning my throat
Taking shots and I still have to drive home, but my fuckin' friends won't leave me alone
'Man up you lil pussy ass bitch, take the shot, we gotta finish this fifth
Driving home, I get a text from my bitch, look down at it then I wreck the Civic
Look at bitches a lil fuckin' different, might try to get with it, take another shot
Every fucking girl that walk right past me grabbin' my attention, there's another thot
Drinking bourbon 'til I fuckin' drop
Mixin' Henny with the soda pop
Drinking 'til I get addicted, though, then I'm drinkin' while I'm home alone
Throwing up 'til I'm anorexic
Mixin' vodka 'til I call my exes
Get a twelve pack just to count my blessings, homie tellin' me to mix pills with it
Thought I wouldn't, but I fucking did it
That same night was when I got addicted
Mix the Xanax with my purple soda; smoke some weed, but just to hold me over
Getting fucked up 'til it haunts my sleep, I can fuckin' see it in my dreams
Tryna make my life a movie screen, 'til these drugs hit me with moving screens
And my homie, he been selling fiends, never thought that he would sell to me
I'm the realest just at seventeen, tell these rappers, "Come and ask me 'bout it"
Say you faded, bruh I fuckin' doubt it
Gonna drink until I'm fuckin' shouting
Gonna drink until I'm passin' out, all these rappers really don't have clout
Get on Drink Champs to get relevance
Working' for a couple presidents
Takin' shots like I just made a bet
My mind's fucked up, it's not celibate

[Hook: Dylan the Teen]
Wake up, I'm fuckin' faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Do this shit every weekend
I'm feeling so depleted
And I feel like I need it
I come on bended knee, and
I'm drinking away my feelings
I'm drinking just to be drinking
Wake up, I'm fuckin' faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Wake up, I'm fuckin faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Wake up, I'm fuckin faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Wake up, I'm fuckin faded
Wake up, still fuckin drinking

[Verse 3: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Smokin' on strong when I wake up
Got a play on my phone, run the cake up
Turns up, so that's why these niggas hate us
Strapped up 'case a nigga try to play us
Through the city, ridin round
Juggin on this lean, never down, Ima go up
Don't let me soldier in the tank, Ima blow up
I don't put two, I gotta pour a four up
I'm with the tech.... when I show up
Niggas, and these bitches, look around like they know us
When I hop out the McLaren, lift the doors up
Spit it off the dome, fuck this song, i ain't write nothin'

[Hook: Dylan the Teen]
Wake up, I'm fuckin' faded
Wake up, still fuckin' drinking
Do this shit every weekend
I'm feeling so depleted
And I feel like I need it
I come on bended knee, and
I'm drinking away my feelings
I'm drinking just to be drinking
Wake up, I'm...
