[Intro]
Ce did this hoe (Ce did this hoe)

[Chorus: OG 3Three & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I just been movin' on (Just been movin' on)
Lately I ain't even been thuggin' on the phone (Thuggin' on the phone)
Keep it street, I'm never talkin' down (Talkin' down)
Gotta stay silent,  too many make a sound (Make a sound, talk)
I just been focused on my life (Just been focused on my life)
Making sure, me and my people moving right (Me and my gang)
Double cup, you know that's mud on the ice (You know that's mud on the ice)
Fast cars, we driving foreigns, that's the life
Fucking bad broads every night (Gang)

[Verse 1: OG 3Three]
Lately I've been movin' on
I ain't really worried about nothin'
I've been gettin' it in good, gotta turn this shit to something
Like Money Mitch, I'm gonna keep stuntin'
Know they wanna see me under
This blood running through my veins
This pain, filling up my hunger
I've just been thugging boy (I've just been thugging)
Running my block, shit I'm gonna die hard (Shit I'm gonna die hard)
We ducking twelve shit, fuck the cops boy
We steady trappin' shit, we some hot boys
We on the block boy
Ten to ten, she was goin' in
No we ain't worried about shit
Gotta stay focused and get it in
Remain humble wit' my clique
I say, that's the Biz
[?] all in the mix
I'm going to the bank
I'm breaking the bank
I might just buy your bitch

[Chorus: OG 3Three & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I just been movin' on (Just been movin' on)
Lately I ain't even been thuggin' on the phone (Thuggin' on the phone)
Keep it street, I'm never talkin' down (Talkin' down)
Gotta stay silent,  too many make a sound (Make a sound, talk)
I just been focused on my life (Just been focused on my life)
Making sure, me and my people moving right (Me and my gang)
Double cup, you know that's mud on the ice (You know that's mud on the ice)
Fast cars, we driving foreigns, that's the life
Fucking bad broads every night (Gang)

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I tell KD pour up some lean, yeah
I swear that I can feel that pain all in my sleep, yeah
I got some war wounds on my body from the streets, yeah
I swear we done left so many bodies for police, yeah
Walkin' in court wit' a cold heart
I do the dash in a Rolls Royce
I've been dropping them bodies, yeah from the start
Got some bricks of that bobby up in the car
From the night to the day , we be going hard
Got some bricks of that yay and we sellin' raw
Like this, they ain't ever hear me talk
Make them start to think that I've been on that bar
I spent some racks on Margiela's
I've been movin' around with some cold steppers
I've been movin that dope on a boat pedal
I'm a post in North wit' a young hitta
I'm a up wit' the Glock like I'm Scottie Pippen
How I spit on the track, KD say I'm trippin'
I'm a get it and spend it all on a Bentley
Nigga scratch that, I swear I'm a kill a city, yeah

[Chorus: OG 3Three & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I just been movin' on (Just been movin' on)
Lately I ain't even been thuggin' on the phone (Thuggin' on the phone)
Keep it street, I'm never talkin' down (Talkin' down)
Gotta stay silent,  too many make a sound (Make a sound, talk)
I just been focused on my life (Just been focused on my life)
Making sure, me and my people moving right (Me and my gang)
Double cup, you know that's mud on the ice (You know that's mud on the ice)
Fast cars, we driving foreigns, that's the life
Fucking bad broads every night (Gang)
