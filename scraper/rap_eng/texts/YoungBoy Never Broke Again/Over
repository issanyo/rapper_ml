[Chorus]
I just want show you I'm changing, yeah
Kinda hard for to show you, I'm trying, yeah
I admit it ain't easy baby, it's gon' take a minute
Told you somethin' and show different, but everything I swear I meant it
And what I tell you ain't written but I'm just I'm hopin' that you feel it
Most of these niggas be bitchin', I just want to show you where the real at

[Verse 1]
Them niggas you listen to, get on the mic and they just be rappin'
No they ain't livin' like that, half of them niggas, they just be cappin'
Back in the day I'd sleep on mattress, I blew up so fast they think that it's magic
I remember that day just like it's a classic
When you came in my life, I can't tell 'em what happened
Then I told you that I swear that I'll never hurt you but once
Double back and show you you can't believe what come off my tongue
When I flood your wrist I'm floodin' mine, that's a one of one
It ain't no need to waste no time, soon as it's said then it's done
Happy to show you I love you, now right now I'm ashamed of it
Admit a piece of me missing when you ain't where I can touch you
Ask what you doin', you say thuggin', I'm so caught up and I'm thuggin'
Tell me do you really love me? wouldnâ€™t say I do for nothin'

[Chorus]
I admit it ain't easy baby, it's gon' take a minute
Told you somethin' and show different, but everything I swear I meant it
And what I tell you ain't written but I'm just I'm hopin' that you feel it
Most of these niggas be bitchin', I just want to show you where the real at
I just want show you I'm changing, yeah
(I just want show you I'm changing, I swear to God that I'm changin')
Kinda hard for to show you, I'm trying, yeah
(I'm so fucked up and I'm painless, it's hard to show what I'm thinkin')

[Verse 2]
My mind so gone, I don't know how to act now
I was done with love but I done relapsed now
I was ready for this, I done got off track now
I done got you here, now I'm startin' to fall back now
First time we fucked you ain't never tap out
Now you got me thinkin' that I'm in love with you
In the car when we ride I'ma thug with you
I ain't never stand down, I'ma bust with you

[Outro]
I just want show you I'm changing, I swear to God that I'm changin'
I'm so fucked up and I'm painless, it's hard to show what I'm thinkin'
