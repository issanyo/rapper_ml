[Intro]
DJ Swift on the track
Say
Aye, you can't let nobody make you mad
I'ma say it like this, "How the fuck you don't want nobody controllin' you, but you let that person make you mad?"
They controllin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gone do when you fall? (I know they all gone leave)
To all the one's left you alone (On God, on God, on me)
You cry when nobody around, (Control is all on me)
You stressin', you ain't got no money
Had you a girl, but these bitches ain't nothin'

[Chorus]
Jumped off the porch in the streets, now you thuggin'
Went back to jail 'cause you steady kept rushin'
Diamonds, they hang down the neck of your cousin
Ain't throw you nothin', feel like, "Fuck it, you buster"
Ain't come in the clutch when you try to score something
Death on your mind, you ain't thinkin' 'bout nothin'
Stay with a nine, think 'bout stickin' up something
Got jacked by your brother, he left you with nothin'

[Verse 1]
Ran up a check, when they see you, you stuntin'
People who left, now you see that they comin'
Don't fuck with them niggas, you know how they comin'
Gotta think 'fore you move, if you don't, you go under
Shame on them 'cause they blame you for their problems
Mad they ain't finish school for they mama
Bitch called my mama, he gone, go find him
Never knew love back then since a toddler
Turned to a killer, he bought him a chopper
Don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout no dollar
All for my name, you posted, they follow
Usin' you up the point you done caught 'em
I done had some people sit around me talkin' about the ones they with
You ain't got no morals, I know how you think that you ain't shit
Be able to see through a kiss and a hug
Prepare and protect your heart from the fake love
Stay 'bout your money, don't go to no club
Respond wit' a answer, don't never just shrug
Know you is who but they say you was
Say you ain't shit, you ain't nothing but a thug
Tell 'em think with they dick 'cause you don't give a fuck
Steady turnin' up 'cause you don't give a fuck
It's done, bitch, it's done

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gone do when you fall? (I know they all gone leave)
To all the one's left you alone (On God, on God, on me)
You cry when nobody around, control is all on me (I'm strapped up)
You stressin', you ain't got no money
Had you a girl, but these bitches ain't nothin' (Ooh!)

[Chorus]
Jumped off the porch in the streets, now you thuggin'
Went back to jail 'cause you steady kept rushin'
Diamonds, they hang down the neck of your cousin
Ain't throw you nothin', but like, "Fuck it, you buster"
Ain't come in the clutch when you try to score something
Death on your mind, you ain't thinkin' 'bout nothin'
Stay with a nine, think 'bout stickin' up something
Got jacked by your brother, he left you with nothin'

[Verse 2]
Take down, shake down, had to check the background
Lame shit, had to tell that bitch that's the pipe down
Money comin' pronto, had to to tell that nigga, "Right now"
Talkin' with no sense, had to tell that nigga, "Stand down"
Up with the TEC, had to make that nigga lay down
Hit a nigga up, when he drop, he gone stay down
Go to make a drop, when we leave, we gone ride 'round
Lookin' from behind, tryna make sure they don't slide down
Thinkin' in the future when I don't have restrictions
Looked at the bitch had to tell her it's my time now
I'm gon' keep you in the front, I ain't leavin' you behind now
Drop dick on her now the bitch so fine now
Chopstick laid in the cross, she gon' die now
"Mane, what you mean?" Mean bitch she gon' die 'bout it
If I feel played wit' lil bitch she gon' slide 'bout it
Crash out slap her in her shit, she won't cry 'bout it
Know that we official, we don't speak when a nigga talk
I'ma blow the whistle til' you sleep, I don't hear him talk
When it's beef we gon' creep nigga, knowin' that my niggas 'bout it
Ben walked in and he asked, "You ain't see me callin'?"
Steady goin' in, nonsense what a nigga talkin'
Got a long dick if you want to say something 'bout it
Say that nigga better stay around him, you know this retarded
You ain't hear me clear, man I meant to say retarded
