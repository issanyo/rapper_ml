[Intro]
Ayy, we gon' speed it up?
Or we gon' slow it down?

[Verse 1]
I say "oh my god, I'm scarred"
It's hard, so can you end it?
I'm a bad motherfucker
Bullets through the car, it's war
That rod, I tote it, I ain’t slippin'
When I fell back, I noticed this
How you was lying and I was running wit' the time
While you was dreaming that I'm dyin'
I got Hassen on my brain
With a brick up on my mind
With a icy slave chain 'cause I'm rich and can’t move ‘round
I go wrong by lovin' you
You talkin' down and that's not true
Them people 'round they using you
If I kill her, I kill you too
Said you want go back to your ex
You fuckin' wit' that nigga too
And while you fuck me, in your head, you picture him, you doin' it too
You know I stepped on that lil' boy
I tried to kill her brother too
And I got pounds by the low
You done see me distribute
You know that girl who diagnosed me
With that shit, I gave to you
Get at me, I get at you
Shit on me, I shit on you

[Chorus]
Tell your secrets to the only thing that come out at night
Attention seeking, how the fuck they leave me traumatized?
If they know like I know, they better run, they never come outside
Real shotta stay low
And let it blow until you niggas die

[Refrain]
I say mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the realest of them all?
Who told the truth and never let them people see a flaw?
And who the fuck got all these hoes, thinking that they raw?
And who been killing all these niggas, while based outta town?
And who the fuck said you lil' bitches could re-do my song?
And either one of these bitches can’t say I ain't hold it down
She tried to bless me with that pussy, told her hold it down
Lets play a game, just close your eyes and lemme burn you down

[Chorus]
Tell your secrets to the only thing that come out at night
Attention seeking, how the fuck they leave me traumatized?
If they know like I know, they better run, they never come outside
Real shotta stay low
And let it blow until you niggas die

[Refrain]
I say mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the realest of them all?
Who told the truth and never let them people see a flaw?
And who the fuck got all these hoes, thinking that they raw?
And who been killing all these niggas, while based outta time?

[Outro]
And you will die if you live for to die
See the demons in your eyes
Say what you know, get crucified
Big 14, 38, triple nine
Ms. Alexander got to discuss that we received on the nine
And you will die if you live for to die
See the demons in your eyes
Say what you know, get crucified
Big 14, 38, triple nine
Ms. Alexander got to discuss that we received on the nine
