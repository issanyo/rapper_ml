[Intro: Youngboy Never Broke Again & uncredited female]
What is they?
Who is what?
Who is this bitch?
Who?
Who is this bitch that you looking at?
Ion know her
I'm really tired of this
You tripping
I'm so tired of this, I really hope them niggas get you
Bet

[Chorus]
I heard they speaking on my name
They do it all for the fame
Paid attention how you changed
Know that I'll never change
Know they ain't feelin my pain
Yea, unnnnn huhhh

[Verse 1]
2016 I got locked in that cell and they ain't let me out
Money I'm talking, you know that I'm ballin' I'm hustlin and I ain't never seen a drought
Spending this cash, but I can not forget to make sure that all my niggas on
Spending this money no question do I think about it, I'll never say that I don't
Walk off alone, when I talk on the phone, dropping the price and you know that they on
Soon as we get it, you know that its gone
I swear that we been at this shit for so long
Momma ask for something and I tell her no
She tell me I ain't shit, and act like I'm wrong
I'm running that check up everytime I'm gone
For christmas I swear I'mma buy you a home
I get on my knees and I pray on my own
Thanking the lord that I'm here, I ain't gone
I pray the judge that Q come home
Choppa boy feel he all alone
You know I got money but I'm in a hole
Scared I'mma die when I'm out on the road
Don't know how I'm feelin, don't know what I'm on
All they wanna do is ask for a loan

[Pre-Chorus]
All this pain man, I feel like I can't hold it
Goin' off lean and you know that I be on it
I ain't slipping boy, you knowing that I'm focused
Fly time, prime time, I'm ballin' hard sideline
Baby I'm sorry I ain't got time for to waste
On the road, yeah I be gone everyday
Too 100 to put myself around the fakes
It's time for real niggas and fake bitches to separate

[Chorus]
I heard they speaking on my name
You better stay up in your lane
They do it whatever for the fame
You know that I'll never change
I paid attention how you changed
I'm never exposin' my pain
I'm head first 'bout my gang
I swear all we know is bang

[Verse 2]
Same nigga took your chain tried to kill me
Meet up to buy it, you know I'm gon' split him
He be with them boys, they ain't no gorillas
It's only room for just me and my niggas
They fake as a bitch and swear I don't feel em
We catch 'em gon' strech 'em you know we gon' hit 'em
I stay with that poker, that Joker, let's deal 'em
Free my hittas man the judge ain't bail 'em
They telling me that hoe there got a million
I don't give a fuck, I ain't far from a million
I heard that bitch old man want kill me
I'm sitting at the top I guess I'm the villian
When you around me, hoe don't do no whisperin'
You say I act funny cause I keep my distance
When we be fucking don't do know resisting
You know I go hard everytime I hit it ( come here)

[Bridge]
All this pain man, I feel like I can't hold it
I can't swim but I'm deep off in that ocean
I go to sleep in my drip, when I wake up I just smile how I'm flexin'
I know these niggas want test me, wish they could catch me
I thank the lord that he bless me

[Pre-Chorus]
All this pain man, I feel like I can't hold it
Goin' off lean and you know that I be on it
I ain't slipping boy, you knowing that I'm focused
Fly time, prime time, I'm ballin' hard sideline
Baby I'm sorry I ain't got time for to waste
On the road, yeah I be gone everyday
Too 100 to put myself around the fakes
It's time for real niggas and fake bitches to separate

[Chorus]
I heard they speaking on my name
You better stay up in your lane
They do it whatever for the fame
You know that I'll never change
I paid attention how you changed
I'm never exposin' my pain
I'm head first 'bout my gang
I swear all we know is bang
