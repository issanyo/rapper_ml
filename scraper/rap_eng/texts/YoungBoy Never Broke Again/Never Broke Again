[Intro: Young Scooter]
Hah
Black Migo Gang
Never goin' back
M
Zaytoven

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I ain't never goin' broke again, like AI YoungBoy
Been juggin' since the young boy (Yeah)
I ain't never goin' broke again, I sent my decoy
This nigga tried to set me up (You know it wasn't me, boy)
I ain't never goin' broke again (Young Scooter)
And I'm the boss man, all I make is count music
I ain't never goin' broke again, like AI YoungBoy
This nigga tried to set me up, you know I sent my decoy

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I ain't going back broke, I ain't going back broke, no
I cannot go, no, I cannot go
I get thirty for a show and my wrist a light show
Bricks and bales in and out the jugghouse door
Lean the pot, cook up rocks, fuck the cops
Kill the opps, set up shop, bleed the block
Extra gram, but you ain't gotta pay Uncle Sam
Only street taxes, this recipe, I make 'em pay it
I ain't goin' back broke, I ain't going back broke, no
I cannot go but I need all of mine for sure, Freebandz

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I ain't never goin' broke again, like AI YoungBoy
Been juggin' since the young boy (Yeah)
I ain't never goin' broke again, I sent my decoy
This nigga tried to set me up (You know it wasn't me, boy)
I ain't never goin' broke again (Young Scooter)
And I'm the boss man, all I make is count music
I ain't never goin' broke again, like AI YoungBoy
This nigga tried to set me up, you know I sent my decoy

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Road runner, trap nigga, never goin' under (Never goin' under)
We get word on that boy, and you know we on 'em (We on 'em)
I ain't no bitch, I ain't no ho, you ain't takin' nothin' (On gang)
Broad day, lil Ben face 'em, you know he gon' slump 'em, yeah
From the trap to the mic, nigga know we be gettin' it (We get it)
Real niggas feel me whenever I spit it
No questions asked, nigga know that I'm with it (I'm with it)
Think that I'm sweet, I put one in his fitted
I'm followed by shooters when I'm in your city
Tell me the price and you know I'ma spend it (Price)
Just hit my phone whenever you send it
Deck on the way already for the candy
Pull up where I'm at, nigga, I'm in the trenches
AI YoungBoy, I swear I'm official
We at the top, forever we winnin'
To never go broke, forever I meant it

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I ain't never goin' broke again, like AI YoungBoy
Been juggin' since the young boy (Yeah)
I ain't never goin' broke again, I sent my decoy
This nigga tried to set me up (You know it wasn't me, boy)
I ain't never goin' broke again (Young Scooter)
And I'm the boss man, all I make is count music
I ain't never goin' broke again, like AI YoungBoy
This nigga tried to set me up, you know I sent my decoy
