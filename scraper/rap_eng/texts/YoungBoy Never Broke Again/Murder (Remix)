[Intro: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Nigga play he gone get his head bust
You know how we comin
Young Boy

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Nigga play he gone get his head bust
You know how we comin
Strapped like the Navy Seals
Promise you don't want it
This for them bitch ass niggas that be speaking on me
Rob who? You got me fucked up
You ain't taking nuthin
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Play with that money
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Come run up on me
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Burn you and yo homie
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Thinkin that I'm Stuntin
It's gone be a murda

[Verse 1: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Gon' be a murda if you thankin bout takin sum from me
Talk about your body but I bet you ain't gone play with me
Try me if you wanna I stay with that burner on me (watchu doin'?)
I can't let you get no rip off me
Nigga must think I'm a hoe or some
I don't know who the fuck he must take me for
That shit that you talking ain't fearing us
Fuck how you come you ain't seein us
Say we beefin gon' catch him and wet him up
Nigga tell me pull up and I'm pullin up
Up let it bang we ain't sparing nun
Caught him up in the bottom and he ran from me
Hoe ass niggas stay in yo lane
You niggas be playin we ain't playing games
When I'm up in the club bitch I'm with the gang
You can catch us turnin up for Dave
So you know we flexin with them bands
Whole lotta more up in my pants
Try to take it all you hear is bang
Try to take it all you hear is bang

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Nigga play he gone get his head bust
You know how we comin
Strapped like the Navy Seals
Promise you don't want it
This for them bitch ass niggas that be speaking on me
Rob who? You got me fucked up
You ain't taking nuthin
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Play with that money
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Come run up on me
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Burn you and yo homie
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Thinkin that I'm Stuntin
It's gone be a murda

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Draco on me and it got the cooling system (21, 21, 21)
Slaughter gang savage love to shoot at niggas (21, 21, 21)
Got a 30 in the booth right now, that's on gang
And a judge gon' give me life if a nigga touch my chain, 21
Red light, I got four young niggas with me sticked up
100 round drum, we gon' leave 'em at the red light
Got the VVSs dripping, lil nigga tried to reach and all he seen was a motherfucking red light
Now they scared right
Called your baby mama over cause her head's right
I put your favorite rapper in a wheel chair
Niggas say they from the street but bitch I'm still there

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Nigga play he gone get his head bust
You know how we comin
Strapped like the Navy Seals
Promise you don't want it
This for them bitch ass niggas that be speaking on me
Rob who ? you got me fucked up
You ain't taking nuthin
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Play with that money
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Come run up on me
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Burn you and yo homie
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Thinkin that I'm Stuntin
It's gone be a murda
