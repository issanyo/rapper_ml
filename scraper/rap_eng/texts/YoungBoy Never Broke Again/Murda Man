[Chorus]
Fuck a teller, bitch, I'm screamin' "murda," 'cause I wrote it
Fuck up on probation, judge said she gon' revoke it
4-5 with extension, bitch, I'm walking with it on me
Just 'cause I don't post it, bitch, you know that I still tote it

[Verse 1]
Drinkin' on this potion steady fuckin' up my kidneys
Malu had just text me and she told me that she miss me
Fifty-thousand on me, I got all these hoes reachin'
Steady sendin' money to my brothers up in prison
Lil' [?] in my phone, he like, "Nigga, what the business?"
I told him, "Fuck the laws, you know that I'm still spinnin'"
Hit a nigga block with the quickness, hop out with that glizzy
Whack his partner, tell him come and find me
Bitch, I'm in the trenches
He like, "Bitch, I know you didn't"
Hoe, you know I did it
Send yo' brother to my show and, bitch, I'm tearin' up yo' city
Nigga said that he want smoke
Nigga know I'm with it
When I catch you we gon' stretch you
Put one in yo' fitted

[Chorus]
Four-by-four, I'm in a Benz ridin' 'round with Fee
Nigga Instagram thuggin', they don't want no beef
I'ma pull up where you be, you talkin' 'bout zippin' me
You know I ain't hidin', bitch, I'm right here in them streets

[Verse 2]
If I said it, I'ma stamp it
I know them laws tryna ban me
Bitch, I feel like Charles Manson
It ain't nothin' I can't handle
All these diamonds on me dancin'
Pour a four up in that Fanta
I just pulled up in a Phantom
Come through bouncin' like I'm prancin'

[Chorus]
I'ma come through doin' the murder man
Ridin' with them choppers in a Sprinter Van
Nigga wanna do it, we can do it then
All the way dumb, you know I ain't playin'

[Verse 3]
I got that burner on me for whoever tryna harm me
Nigga, drop yo' pen, you know that I'm comin'
I got that burner on me for whoever tryna hold me
Nigga, drop yo' pen, you know that I'm comin'
Youngboy don't play 'round
You gon' get down or gon' lay down
Got yo' hitters with you, I'ma hop out, spray that K round
Murder on my trail, I could die, like, any day now
I thought you was real, I ain't knowin' what to say now

[Chorus]
Fuck a teller, bitch, I'm screamin' "murda," 'cause I wrote it
Fuck up on probation, judge said she gon' revoke it
4-5 with extension, bitch, I'm walking with it on me
Just 'cause I don't post it, bitch, you know that I still tote it
Four-by-four, I'm in a Benz ridin' 'round with Fee
Nigga Instagram thuggin', they don't want no beef
I'ma pull up where you be, you talkin' 'bout zippin' me
You know I ain't hidin', bitch, I'm right here in them streets
I'ma come through doin' the murder man
Ridin' with them choppers in a Sprinter Van
Nigga wanna do it, when can do it then
All the way dumb, you know I ain't playin'
