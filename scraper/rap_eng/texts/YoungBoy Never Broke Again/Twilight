[Chorus]
Told me you love me, but obviously you don't
I told you I need you, but you wasn't there for me, no
I can promise you, I won't change
I can promise you, I won't change
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Money callin' gotta go get it, baby
Confident how I been feelin' lately
I cannot sit here just stress about our situation
I just gotta look at the bigger picture, baby
But on the upper end, I been gettin' it in
Low lights, stacking up my m’s and that's 'til the end
I done cut off all my friends, gotta stay positive
I won't let nobody hurt me or get me up outta here
They say money’ll make you change and I agree
Most of them niggas caught up in they fame but that ain't me
I'm sittin' on top of the peak, my heart forever in the streets
Can't believe you turned your back on me

[Chorus]
Told me you love me, but obviously you don't
I told you I need you
But you wasn't there for me, no
I can promise you, I won't change
I can promise you, I won't change
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Heard you been fuckin' with them lames, heard you been fuckin' with 'em
I heard that you been man to man, I knew you wasn't official
I had to get up off my ass, had to get up and get it
And I done ran me up a bag, for me and my children
I ain't stressin' out you know, you know I ain't trippin'
I’m 17, facing the north, they locked me up in prison
Every night runnin' it with Fat Black, he say 'I'm that nigga'
He say "If they left, they were never with you"
AI YoungBoy, I'm too official
Every night runnin' it with Fat Black, he say 'I'm that nigga'
He say "If they left, they were never with you"

[Chorus]
Told me you love me , but obviously you don't
I told you I need you
But you wasn't there for me, no
I can promise you
I won't change
I can promise you, I won't change
Yeah, yeah
