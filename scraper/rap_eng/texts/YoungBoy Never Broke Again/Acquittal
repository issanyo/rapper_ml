[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
You know what I'm sayin'
Bow my head, put my hands together

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I just need a blessing, sick and tired of stressing
Yeah I did a lot of shit, hell but I didn't learn my lesson
I pray every night but sometimes I be second guessing
Like shit'll never change, shit'll never change
Ayy I need me a blessing, no I can't fall
Helping every one my dogs just to see them make it out
Ayy I need me a blessing, too much pain for me dog
Every day I'm flashin' out, stackin' money just to ball

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
I just need a percocet, I just need a pint of Tech
Dealing with all type of mess
Face a blunt to ease the stress, yeah
Looked up, damn I got a warrant
Having thoughts of jumping bonds
Can't afford no fuckin' lawyer
Now a nigga on the run
My family helpless, no time to be selfish (why you say that?)
Too many tragedies, almost left me breathless (almost killed a nigga)
I wanted to pay off, spent like a hundred on the necklace
Do they want to see me shine 'cause how I'm living got me guessing
Mind on some gangster shit, reckless thoughts
Set him up, throw a cross
Order it up, take him off
It's time for you to take a loss
I just want to get this paper with my gang and shit
And give them game and shit
And never change or switch

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I just need a blessing, sick and tired of stressing
Yeah I did a lot of shit, hell but I didn't learn my lesson
I pray every night but sometimes I be second guessing
Like shit'll never change, shit'll never change
Ayy I need me a blessing, no I can't fall
Helping every one my dogs just to see them make it out
Ayy I need me a blessing, too much pain for me dog
Every day I'm flashin' out, stackin' money just to ball
Ayy I need me a blessing

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Since a youngin' I been thuggin'
Since a baby I've been struggling
I tote pistols out in public
Ayy I need me a blessing
I heard stories 'bout my uncle, niggas shot him in his head
Hitting a lick about that money and man I'm tired of stressing
Gotta keep this shit one hundred
I've been stressin' bout that paper, I can't let it take me under
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
Lord don't let 'em test me
I got demons in my body, I need you to help me
Got four sons, I'm eighteen years old, look at it as a blessing
On this road a long way from home
Ain't slippin', keep that Wesson
Told them hoes not to call my phone, ho don't text me
The police tryna get me gone, I'm a baby in the fed, uh

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I just need a blessing, sick and tired of stressing
Yeah I did a lot of shit, hell but I didn't learn my lesson
I pray every night but sometimes I be second guessing
Like shit'll never change, shit'll never change
Ayy I need me a blessing, no I can't fall
Helping every one my dogs just to see them make it out
Ayy I need me a blessing, too much pain for me dog
Every day I'm flashin' out, stackin' money just to ball
Ayy I need me a blessing
