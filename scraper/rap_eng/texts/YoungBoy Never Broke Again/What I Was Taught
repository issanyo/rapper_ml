[Intro]
Shit, uh
I was in the car ridin with my um grandfather
On my daddy side, you know my daddy in jail, he told me
He was like


[Chorus]
You gotta pay the cost to be the boss
Always been my dream for me to make it to the top
They act like they don't believe me but shit I promise I won't stop (no I want stop
Never fold, never speak on what I know, what I was taught
Forever ride for my bros what I was taught
Fuck that bitch and let her go what I was taught
Stack my money up til I can buy a vault
Stand on all 10 toes and hold ya own what I was taught


[Verse 1]
Uh never give up on my brother
Uh never say no to my sister
Young nigga come straight out that gutta
Errday on the block we be hustlin'
What I do gotta keep on the under
If I get jammed want never say nothing
Everywhere that I go eyes be on me
Up from the hip if you try to take something
Triple war 38, here I'm from (the nawf)
I had to go hard to come up
I remember I stuck, I go hit tha lick by myself
Nigga know that's the gang that I rep
I'm not sellin' my soul for wealth
Gotta maintain while I'm still takin' these steps
Free all my bros it's still fuck 12
Sippin' syrup while I gather my thoughts
Forever doin what I was taught
These niggas ain't solid they runnin' they mouth
In Houston with Dopeboy I'm drippin' the sauce
Just went shot a video in the loft
Ridin' in a foreign never gave my way round
I'm finna be one of the dumbest in town
Got the major labels callin' my phone
I'm gang, Youngboy


[Chorus]
You gotta pay the cost to be the boss
Always been my dream for me to make it to the top
They act like they don't believe me but shit I promise I won't stop (no I want stop
Never fold, never speak on what I know, what I was taught
Forever ride for my bros what I was taught
Fuck that bitch and let her go what I was taught
Stack my money up til I can buy a vault
Stand on all 10 toes and hold ya own what I was taught


[Verse 2]
Ride to that money like I work for brinks truck
Chasing that sack I can't stop gotta run it up
Leaving my shows and them hoes they be chasing us
Flexin' so hard that them niggas be hatin' us
I remember ain't nobody believe in us
They want a song, but no I don't fuck with them
Not trusting these hoes, you know I ain't lovin' them
He ain't my gang, you know ion run with them
Callin' the shots what the fuck do you mean?
Ain't no nigga roboting my beef
Me and twin full of pills on the scene
Got that hammer stuffed up in my jeans
Hit the stage and turn up with my team
Get that dough and perform then I leave
Ain't got no time to meet and greet
I'm dosing off from that lean
But I'm back to back pouring up these 4's yeaahh
Catch me turnt up bad stuntin' on these hoes yeaahhh
Steady hit my dance, thuggin with my bros yeaahh
Always kickin' shit show em' how it goes yeaahh


[Chorus]
You gotta pay the cost to be the boss
Always been my dream for me to make it to the top
They act like they don't believe me but shit I promise I won't stop (no I want stop
Never fold, never speak on what I know, what I was taught
Forever ride for my bros what I was taught
Fuck that bitch and let her go what I was taught
Stack my money up til I can buy a vault
Stand on all 10 toes and hold ya own what I was taught
