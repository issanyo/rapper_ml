[Intro]
This for that young nigga that's posted on the block
This for that lil nigga that's trynna make it to the top
(To the top, yeah)

[Verse 1]
And ima start this first verse off by saying R.I.P. Dave
Ima keep my dirty ways till they let D-dawg out the cage
Nawf side 38 Chippewa where i play
Yall niggas running 'round I'm just trynna run the game
And i was always reckless nigga I was never tamed
Ima ride for my brother I know he would do the same
Load up with them cuttas ima make em feel my pain
Ima make these pussy bitches bleed for what yall did to Dave
And we done bought so many guns, bitch we strapped up like the NAVY
I got this bitch up on me for whoever try to play me
These niggas too petty bitch you need an education
They trynna rule B.R. bitch I'm trynna rule the nation
Stick you out yo shit, I'm the real 38 baby
I'm cruising to the top while you other niggas racing
You back i'm concentrated
I'm back and forward pacing, I'm steady meditating
I'm like fuck a nigga hating
They like 'Youngboy, man you the sickest you the dumbest right now
They like 'Youyngboy you bout to blow up you know you bout to get signed
Whole lotta OG's on my place helped me stay on my grind
Buku hoes be on my top but I ain't waisting my time

I'm the street's hottest youngin I'm on fire
Straight to the top yeah you right but I won't stop
Fuck whoever not in a minute know I won't fold
I say I'm hot, I got the ticket niggas better realize it
