[Intro]
Them niggas ain't gon’ fuck with us
Bitch, name a nigga play with us
You know we kept them K's with us
Shout out to Lil Rippah for makin' this beat

[Verse 1]
Smokin’ dope with my hitter, plottin' on the next one
He said, "All behind Youngboy, I'm gon' stretch somthin'"
I told him, "All behind that check, you better wet somethin'"
We swervin' with them thang, it's back to back until you niggas bleed
I don’t know nothin’ but 4KTrey, I'm tryna t-shirt the bitch
So I can’t trust my own niggas, that's how deep this shit get
I'm screamin' death before dishonor and I stuck with the shit
But now you crossed me, I’m so slimey, got no love for a bitch
The feds came and got Tekashi, I been thinkin' that I'm next
I'm screamin' murder 'bout my nigga and now I'm gettin' that off my chest
One scary bitch that I ain't get and I ain't stoppin' 'til he stretched
Bitch you fumblin' through yo' shit and send bullets through yo' neck
In the club screamin' out, "Who want it?" Fill my pocket with bodies
I got them pounds on the couch, the chopper right by the faucet
I just got 80 for a show, street niggas spent the deposit
Plus I spent 50 for a jet, bitch, I ain't trippin', I got it

[Chorus]
I'm steady drawin' blood for blood like catch this slug
Them niggas shouldn't have played with us, uh-uh, uh
Foolio let that hammer bust, slip one time and you bite the dust
That's when you niggas die (Bitch ass nigga)
Guns in retaliation, ask me what to make, I say, "A body"
Them drugs bring it out and I can't hide it
Tryna link me to some shit, I told 'em I don't know about it
Bitch, I'm bangin' 4KTrey, they all gon' lay, we swing that chopper

[Verse 2]
They talk the shit, but they just better keep they head on
You play, you die, but on this side, we call it "dead wrong"
I'm sendin' prayers to the sky, my nigga dead and gone
So I be aimin' at yo' noggin' 'til yo' head blown
After me, police tryna cuff me 'cause I run the streets
It's double G, shoot a nigga up, you ain't gon' fuck with me
It's up with me, face on a T, ain't stoppin' 'til they all deceased
I throw them 3s, I bang them Bs
I wiped his nose, the bitch ain't sneeze
I tote a Glock, they tote a Baretta, plus this bitch a 9
Uh, this happen every time
Yeah, they shoulda known he slime
Talkin' out his top, this pussy bitch done must have lost his mind
Caught up in that fire (Bitch), wish you never tried
Strap them Ks now, fiendin' for blood, nobody want play now
You get shot in yo' face, huh
Them young niggas wild, ain't nobody safe now
Montana been two times, caught a body at the same time, up the rate, huh
Gutter sound like drum line, and this one for Ben, man
It's okay now

[Chorus]
Guns in retaliation, ask me what to make, I say, "A body"
Them drugs bring it out and I can't hide it
Tryna link me to some shit, I told 'em I don't know about it
Bitch, I'm bangin' 4KTrey, they all gon' lay, we swing that chopper
I'm steady drawin' blood for blood like catch this slug
Them niggas shouldn't have played with us, uh-uh, uh
Foolio let that hammer bust, slip one time and you bite the dust
That's when you niggas die (Dead, you can't say shit)
