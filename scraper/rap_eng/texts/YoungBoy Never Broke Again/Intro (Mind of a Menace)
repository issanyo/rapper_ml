[Intro: 2Pac Interview]
So okay, you want to see some macho shit? I’m the most macho nigga out here. I thought you niggas knew, I’m the most thuggish nigga out here. I have no mothafuckin’ fear… I have no fear, I have only ambition, and I want mine, and I will do anything to protect and feed my family

[Verse]
In my city it get wicked lil' nigga, don't fuck around and become a victim lil' nigga
Open your eyes and pay attention lil' nigga, you fuck around and end up missing lil' nigga
Let me take 'em way back when we was little lil' nigga
On Chippewa, when Davion and Tre wasn't with it lil' nigga
So many losses we done took and kept it kickin' lil' nigga
But when them niggas killed Lil' Dave this shit got serious lil' nigga This that Mind Of A Menace in my city is wicked
Open your eyes and pay attention anybody can get it
I got a name off Life 'fore Fame that's when they started to envy
Live to get rich that's who I'm living, screaming fuck who be dissin'
Nigga told me to pull up, so I pulled up with that shotty
Hop out hit his house up, then we shot back to Scotty
Run up better be bout it, Take some from who? bitch I doubt it
Up this bitch right on scene, show 'em that it's retarded
Ferragamo hold up my [?] Mafia on my shirt, hold it down for my niggas NBA to the dirt
Ever since I was 7 dreamin' believed I'ma make it
Even though that they hated ain't never let that shit faze me
If its rested don't last, my sister tell me be patient
No you can't knock my shine 'cause I'm destined for greatness
Everything I spoke I live it, if I said it then I did it
Forever we be getting it in, posted in the trenches

[Outro]
