[Chorus]
When I think about it yeah I schemee about it
Gotta be about it i don't dream about it
Gotta keep moving I ain't never stoppin'
It's so many people who behind me
Goin hard yeah I'm steady grindin'
Full of pain but I'm steady shinning
I want this shit bad no I ain't lying
Do anything for it no I ain't lying
I been doin this shit for a minute
Forever goin in till I get it
Not wasting my time with all these bitches
Gotta stay on my grind get to them riches
Time is money I ain't wasting time
I'm feelin like Kobe I'm in my prime
I swear I been hurt yeah too many times
No I ain't got time for all them lies

[Verse 1]
You don't know what this shit mean to me
I swear that I'm tryin' why don't you see
Really up in that waters come swim with me
My visions so blurry can barely see
I stopped by dope boy got that OG Lenny
Pour that shit up, drink it with 3Three
That shit got me with a crazy lean
That shit got me with a crazy lean
Shorty keep askin me when I'm coming over
Told her that I'm gone come when my shows over
Ridin' round like a rollercoaster
Gotta keep it goin, gotta stay in motion
Twin got me on X I ain't losing focus
Swear that I'm up i don't need a floater
When I get there we gone go all morning
When I get there we gone go all morning


[Chorus]
When I think about it yeah I scheme about it
Gotta be about it ion't dream about it
Gotta keep moving I ain't never stoppin'
It's so many people who behind me
Goin hard yeah I'm steady grindin'
Full of pain but I'm steady shinning
I want this shit bad no I ain't lying
Do anything for it no I ain't lying
I been doin this shit here for a minute
Forever goin in till i get it
Not wasting my time with all these bitches
Gotta stay on my grind get to them riches
Time is money I ain't wasting time
I'm feelin like Kobe I'm in my prime
I swear I been hurt yeah too many times
No I ain't got time for all them lies


[Verse 2]
All this shit that I go through just make me stronger
Came out the cave now they heard me conquer
Run up that sack promise I won't fumble
Run up that sack and take care my mother
I'm run up that sack just for my lil brother
Bless my sister tell her "FUCK A NIGGA"
Never forget who was always with me
Gotta blow a bag with my niggas
Everthing that I do swear I elevate
Never go back gotta prosper
Bob and weave like a boxer
Drank don't make me move slow I move faster
Keep a gun but I don't promote violence
Not wasting my money on dancers
Pray for my auntie just cause she got cancer
No money could make this better
Nooooooooo

[Chorus]
When I think about it yeah I scheme about it
Gotta be about it ion' dream about it
Gotta keep moving I ain't never stoppin'
It's so many people who behind me
Goin hard yeah I'm steady grindin'
Full of pain but I'm steady shinning
I want this shit bad no I ain't lying
Do anything for it no I ain't lying
I been doin this shit here for a minute
Forever goin in till I get it
Not wasting my time with all these bitches
Gotta stay on my grind get to them riches
Time is money I ain't wasting time
I'm feelin like Kobe I'm in my prime
I swear I been hurt yeah too many times
No I ain't got time for all them lies
