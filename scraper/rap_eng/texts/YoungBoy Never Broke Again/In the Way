[Intro: Dat Boi Skeet]
You know I keep it on me, that's like every day
Me and my niggas, you know we ain't gonna play
Dat Boi Skeet and that boy Young NBA

[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
You in the way
If you ain't gettin' money, you just in the way (you just in the way)
You ain't talkin' 'bout no money, it ain't shit to say (shit to say)
Blue hundreds, blue strips like I hit the bank (like I hit the bank)
If he 'round me, then you know we 'bout that pistol play (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
Eatin' good, it was days I couldn't get a plate (I had to eat)
I was trappin', tryna get it, tryna make a play (trap, trap, trap, play)
If you don't wanna lose your bitch, you better get your bae (get your bitch)
By any means get your cake, you broke, I can't relate (can't relate)

[Verse 1: Dat Boi Skeet]
Mama told me watch your homies, this street shit ain't safe (mama told me)
Niggas leave you by your lonely when you get a case (that shit for real)
Keep it on me every day 'cause niggas love to hate (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
Rather be upstate than lackin', so I play it safe (yeah, yeah)
We was young, kickin' doors, tryna hit a safe
You go against them down the hill boys, a big mistake
One call is all it takes, and you will get erased (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
Tryna make it from the 'jects to that big estate (that's for real)
I need mine today (mine today), it ain't no time to waste (for real)
I gotta get it, gotta make sure me and mines are straight (yeah, yeah)
They dyin' in my hood, I wake up, will I die today? (not me)
I keep it on me just in case I gotta ride today

[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
You in the way
If you ain't gettin' money, you just in the way (you just in the way)
You ain't talkin' 'bout no money, it ain't shit to say (shit to say)
Blue hundreds, blue strips like I hit the bank (like I hit the bank)
If he 'round me, then you know we 'bout that pistol play (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
Eatin' good, it was days I couldn't get a plate (I had to eat)
I was trappin', tryna get it, tryna make a play (trap, trap, trap, play)
If you don't wanna lose your bitch, you better get your bae (get your bitch)
By any means get your cake, you broke, I can't relate (can't relate)

[Verse 2: NBA YoungBoy]
If you with me, then you know we 'bout it
Ridin' round strapped with the .40
If you talkin', you better stand on it
Real quick I drop a 40
Love all of my fans, I'm chasin' that bag, I ain't goin' back to where I started (I'm never)
I'm movin' too fast, slow down 'fore I crash, I ain't never goin' out (I'm never)
Forever be thuggin', forever be hustlin', I go and get it if I want it (if I want it)
You play with my brother, he give me the word, then you know that I'm on it (that I'm on it)
I be up early in the mornin' (in the mornin')
I'm chasin' money, I ain't snorin' (I ain't snorin')
Strapped up while I'm tourin' (strapped)
All these diamonds got me glowin' (glowin')
Real niggas, we gon' last forever (forever)
Be a man, be about whatever (whatever)
Stand tall up in any weather (any weather)
Sabotage me, I never let 'em
This life that I'm livin', I swear that it's crazy
I been dancin' with the devil (devil)
Put on for the north 'cause that's what had made me
Gettin' to it, never settle (settle)
Yeah

[Chorus: Dat Boi Skeet]
You in the way
If you ain't gettin' money, you just in the way (you just in the way)
You ain't talkin' 'bout no money, it ain't shit to say (shit to say)
Blue hundreds, blue strips like I hit the bank (like I hit the bank)
If he 'round me, then you know we 'bout that pistol play (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
Eatin' good, it was days I couldn't get a plate (I had to eat)
I was trappin', tryna get it, tryna make a play (trap, trap, trap, play)
If you don't wanna lose your bitch, you better get your bae (get your bitch)
By any means get your cake, you broke, I can't relate (you in the way)

[Outro: Dat Boi Skeet & NBA YoungBoy]

In the mornin'
I ain't snorin'
Shit to say
That I'm on it
In the mornin'
I ain't snorin' (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
Eatin' good, it was days I couldn't get a plate (I had to eat)
I was trappin', tryna get it, tryna make a play (trap, trap, trap, play)
If you don't wanna lose your bitch, you better get your bae (get your bitch)
