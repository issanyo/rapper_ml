[Intro]
PlayBoy on this bitch, but he ain't playing, though
I'm dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke a blunt of strong, tell me, is you with that?
I'm just tryna get to know you baby, tell me where you getting at (I been that)
And I can take your pain to the Neverland
Too busy being who I am

[Chorus]
Roll out, roll out, roll out
Pull up then we show out
Go up, rock out
They pretend for the clout
I am way too cool for y'all
I only care 'bout myself
I think I've seen a black cloud

[Verse 1]
Okay, I walk in
Looking around like where am I at?
I just seen a girl who's stuck in my head
Tried to stay away but she reelin' me in
We could have fun for the whole weekend
Gotta thank God for the big backend
We just had a whole new pack came in
I just went and bought new Chanel lense
Went on tour and I got new fans
Real deal slime, got diamonds on my hands
Real shooter time, I just made a hundred bands
Lost one friend and I gotta advance
Young rich nigga need to buy me some land
Real go-getter, she don't need no man
She so thick and the tone of her skin
Make a nigga wanna try dating again
Oh Holly, I'm so sorry
You my only friend
I feel you right onside me
I never want this for the end
Your energy keep on calling
I pick up
It seems like I can't keep 'em off me

[Chorus]
Roll out, roll out, roll out
Pull up then we show out
Go up, rock out
They pretend for the clout
I am way too cool for y'all
I only care 'bout myself
I think I've seen a black cloud
Roll out, roll out, roll out
Pull up then we show out
Go up, rock out
They pretend for the clout
I am way too cool for y'all
I only care 'bout myself
I think I've seen a black cloud

[Verse 2]
Real street nigga, why they hatin' on me?
Tell me why I got this pain inside of me
I tried to leave the beef alone, yeah honestly
But I've been leaving niggas dead inside the streets
Ohh
Got no friends, tryna bait us I say "hell nah"
I'm like Holly
All these fuckin drugs that I'm on
I got blood running down my arms
I don't wanna be alone
They fucking fake the shit they say, it only make me stronger
Cut out the tops now your dawgs done went missin'
We clear out the block with a stick and a Glizzy
We cut off her hair when she join the committee
Interviewed by reporters while sittin' in the Bentley
They know I did it while I'm rapping 'bout killing
Truth for my city, I'ma say how I feel
They say that nigga got several convictions
You know how I'm coming, you know how we living

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke a blunt, a strong, tell me, is you with that?
I'm just tryna get to know you baby, tell me where you getting at
I been that and I can take your pain to the Neverland
Too busy being who I am

[Chorus]
Roll out, roll out, roll out
Pull up then we show out
Go up, rock out
They pretend for the clout
I am way too cool for y'all
I only care 'bout myself
I think I've seen a black cloud
Okay
