[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
Real
I already know what I'm facing, I already know like
I know if you do this, this can come with that, that can come behind that, but uh
Federal, I don't give a fuck

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Just know that every action come with a reaction
Whatever you dish out you gotta get back
I said I was done with that drank, now I'm relapsing
I said I was done with that Tech and that Act
We take the dope out the seal and we repack it
We take it out and finesse a nigga
We can pop that shit off, ain't with all the jaw jackin'
I ain't with the talkin', I ain't with the talk
It's a chance she catchin' feelings if I fucked her
Ugh ugh, I swear that she might
It's a chance he can cross me out if I trust him
Uh, I don't wanna do that
I know it's a chance the bomb ain't landin'
I got my fingers crossed, man I hope
This shit gotta happen, collateral damage
Fuck how it turn out, this shit gotta happen

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
Yeah, I've been peepin' these niggas out here with the slick hate
(Niggas out here doin' a whole lot of hatin')
Walk around with that cake on me like it's my b-day
(I got them hundreds and all of 'em honcho)
Move around, I'm with some hitters out of VA
(I'm with some hitters, they out of Virginia)
Go with your mood and get burnt like a cremate
Fuck how it is, fuck how they turn out
I'm everywhere with my strap out (everywhere)
They lookin' at me like Damn he bookin'
I'm in the bank with the pack out (right now)
He was my nigga 'til he threw a cross
I was blind to it, I was throwed off
Never again, 'fore I take a loss
Lord, forgive me, gotta knock out his thoughts
These niggas must think I'm a ho or somethin'
Sendin' threats like I'ma fold
Treadmill, they goin' nowhere fast
And they mad 'cause I'm the one that God chose
Got the streets on lock, figure fold
Real snow, ho might catch a cold
Prometh' got me movin' slow
In the trap workin' out, cardio

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Just know that every action come with a reaction
Whatever you dish out you gotta get back
I said I was done with that drank, now I'm relapsing
I said I was done with that Tech and that Act
We take the dope out the seal and we repack it
We take it out and finesse a nigga
We can pop that shit off, ain't with all the jaw jackin'
I ain't with the talkin', I ain't with the talk
It's a chance she catchin' feelings if I fucked her
Ugh ugh, I swear that she might
It's a chance he can cross me out if I trust him
Uh, I don't wanna do that
I know it's a chance the bomb ain't landin'
I got my fingers crossed, man I hope
This shit gotta happen, collateral damage
Fuck how it turn out, this shit gotta happen

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
My girl said she gon' fuck both of us up
Now that's the collateral damage
We fucked her, she tryna cross both of us up
You know I won't let that shit happen
I cut that ho off, now she out of luck
She steady DM-ing my family
Now that's the collateral damage
All that fake shit, man, I swear I can't stand it
He want his respect and you know I won't hand it
If I want him dead, you know I demand it
Consequences, man I knew what could happen
I told that nigga chill out with that cappin'
Snatch my chain, we gon' end up ramblin'
Up in the club, his homie, I stamp him
Television, ain't no televised
The way that we livin', it ain't on no channel
My bitch out who in the north  in the Phantom
Osama bin Laden, I ride on a camel
I catch 'em, go straight to my feelings like damn 'em
Punch on a bitch, had to pay her them bandit
Pocket full of all white dead bandits
They want me to tell, I ain't sayin' it
I know it gon' come with this shit
If I up and hit your ass with the cannon

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Just know that every action come with a reaction
Whatever you dish out you gotta get back
I said I was done with that drank, now I'm relapsing
I said I was done with that Tech and that Act
We take the dope out the seal and we repack it
We take it out and finesse a nigga
We can pop that shit off, ain't with all the jaw jackin'
I ain't with the talkin', I ain't with the talk
It's a chance she catchin' feelings if I fucked her
Ugh ugh, I swear that she might
It's a chance he can cross me out if I trust him
Uh, I don't wanna do that
I know it's a chance the bomb ain't landin'
I got my fingers crossed, man I hope
This shit gotta happen, collateral damage
Fuck how it turn out, this shit gotta happen
Collateral damage
