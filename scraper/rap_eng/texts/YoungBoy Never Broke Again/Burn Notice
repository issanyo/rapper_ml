[Intro]
This a message to the streets
I ain't trying to beef with no police, but look
I ain't never had it like this
That 3 shit
3

[Verse 1]
Got some shit I need to do before it turn over
Got some money stashed away for when the storm over
Stop at the store take off them plates soon as we pull over
Hop out on your block wit the K, shoot
Nigga burn notice
I ain't gotta say a thing these niggas know what it is
I can't be stopped, Lebron James
Free throw a bitch wit that steel
Follow your car, come out the window, shoot it up from the riff
Introduce em to that gangsta shit, and show em it's real
On the block we be scoping, sandwich bag full of pills
Your back window we be poking, tryna see what it is
38 baby, I be gettin it tryna stack up a mill
Murder she wrote, while you at work I'm breaking inside yo crib
Yeah we be sniping, Police tryna indict us for real
I'm like most likely before they lock us up we get killed
Niggas be rapping bout killing but don't live how we live
2017, we had the most bodies that year

[Chorus]
Draw down
Hit him up wit the Glock when I spin on em
20 shots outta that, all 10 on em
Nigga must not know I bend cornas
20, 30, 45, Bid on em
Hit man I'ma put lil Ben on em
North Side Young nigga I lit on em
Young nigga 13 wit a stick on em
Homicide in the town, got him one

[Post-Chorus]
Don Doda, we never run when police come
Top shotta, he get it done he gone shred something
Come Clyde, Batty boy I'm screamin' Red Rum
Stimulize em' Nigga this that Red Redemption


[Verse 2]
Pipe down, up wit the Tec and spray rounds
Never back down, lil bitch I lay my flex down
Who is that clown, nigga know I don't play around
You better not make a sound, I told that bitch to lay down
Hand cuffs, I act an ass up in that cop car
Cause you bringing me to jail you thinkin that I'm finna stop boy
Got actavis and hi tech in my system ain't no wokhardt
Bitch I got a lot of money, set a bail, I'm bonding out boy
BR PD, They ain't never tame us
They been trynna build some cases ever since I came up
Niggas bitches out here snitchin, why they bring our name up
That's why you bitches ain't get a victim when them niggas brain bust

[Chorus]
Draw down
Hit him up wit the Glock when I spin on em
20 shots outta that, all 10 on em
Nigga must not know I bend cornas
20, 30, 45, Bid on em
Hit man I'ma put lil Ben on em
North Side Young nigga I lit on em
Young nigga 13 wit a stick on em
Homicide in the town, got him one

[Bridge]
Got some shit I need to do before it turn over
Got some money stashed away for when the storm over
Stop at the store take off them plates soon as we pull over
Hop out on your block wit the K, shoot
Nigga burn notice

[Post-Chorus]
Don Doda, we never run when police come
Top shotta, he get it done he gone shred something
Come Clyde, Batty boy I'm screamin' Red Rum
Stimulize em' Nigga this that Red Redemption
