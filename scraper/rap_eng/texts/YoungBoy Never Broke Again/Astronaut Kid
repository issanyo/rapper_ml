[Intro]
CashMoneyAP
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Prepare for launch in 3...2...1...

[Chorus]
I shot to the top just like I'm a rocket (like I'm a rocket)
I ain't have a dollar inside of my pocket (inside of my pocket)
Put that on my gang, I swear I ain't stoppin' (I ain't stoppin')
Strapped up and I'm vest up, I'm a astronaut kid
They say pain like meteorites
I got the world in my eyes
The chosen one, I got the prize
I got my niggas on my side

[Verse 1]
Feel like I need some space, I'm sippin' on Act in space
Lot of blue money in the bank, old hundreds in the case
I'm in a high speed chase, on the way, I can't be late
Corvette, let's do a race, hope I see another day
Sip drank, that's every day, gave a check to KK
You know I love you, I was talkin' to Tay-Tay
Whenever you call me you know that I'm comin'
Get that back-end and I stack up that money
Up with that chopper, you know I'ma dump it
I won't let a nigga take nothin' from me
Tell me your secret, it stay on the under
I swear to God that I won't say nothin'
Just had sex with my baby mama
You better not tell my girl nothin'
Spent a half a mil, and I ain't go broke yet
Spent eighty thousand dollars on a brand new 'Vette
I told that ho she a dog, I'ma take you to the vet
Suck on your blood like a tick, let her come suck on this dick
I don't give a fuck what they say, I'm already rich
All my diamonds glist', ten thousand on my bitch (letâ€™s go)

[Chorus]
I shot to the top just like I'm a rocket (like I'm a rocket)
I ain't have a dollar inside of my pocket (inside of my pocket)
Put that on my gang, I swear I ain't stoppin' (I ain't stoppin')
Strapped up and I'm vest up, I'm a astronaut kid
They say pain like meteorites
I got the world in my eyes
The chosen one, I got the prize
I got my niggas on my side

[Verse 2]
Diamonds for my bro, these people would never know
Everything that we been through, that money did nothin' but grow
Got a Styrofoam full of dope, I'm in the UFO
Got a penthouse full of hoes, and they don't want to go
Walk in the club and I'm strapped with that pole
Laugh and I live it up with Baby Joe
I'm not from Earth, I'm from out of the globe
Me and my niggas take over your turf
Walkin' on stage with NBA merch
Gone off the drank and I need me a nurse
Blast off, I'm a astronaut
Came from nothin', don't belong on Earth

[Chorus]
I shot to the top just like I'm a rocket (like I'm a rocket)
I ain't have a dollar inside of my pocket (inside of my pocket)
Put that on my gang, I swear I ain't stoppin' (I ain't stoppin')
Strapped up and I'm vest up, I'm a astronaut kid
They say pain like meteorites
I got the world in my eyes
The chosen one, I got the prize
I got my niggas on my side
