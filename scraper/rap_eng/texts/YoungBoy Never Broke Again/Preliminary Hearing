[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & MoneyBagg Yo]
I got that burner on me now, yeah
Whole lot of money on me now, yeah
Diamonds dancing on me now, yeah
Hitters on go and they gon' ride, yeah
Every diamond on me wet
Heard he got anna on his chest
I'ma die 'bout my respect yeah
Got my foot on niggas' necks, yeah

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I come from the mud, diamonds wet like floods
Pour up see the suds, you snitch you the fuzz
YoungBoy them on go
Choppers outside the show
Horseshoes on my toe
I just smoked a bowl
YoungBoy screaming murder
Killers in my circle
Bitch I'm out the north
Straight out the gutter like some turtles
I know that gang you heard of
BGE, them be my brothers
I can't talk, that chopper stutter
They don't like you then it's fuck you
I got some killers with me straight up out that mainframe
And all my fed babies with me hollerin' gang gang
And every OG with me smoke on dope and sell 'caine
And we got bricks out in the label, that's the same thing

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & MoneyBagg Yo]
I got that burner on me now, yeah
Whole lot of money on me now, yeah
Diamonds dancing on me now, yeah
Hitters on go and they gon' ride, yeah
Every diamond on me wet
Heard he got anna on his chest
I'ma die 'bout my respect yeah
Got my foot on niggas' necks, yeah

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & MoneyBagg Yo]
These niggas know we ain't acting
You get out your body, you know we gon' stamp you
You see I pulled up with them shooters
You go at your move and you know we gon' ban you
Whole lot of money on me now and all these diamonds dancing
I'm a street nigga out that north, yeah bitch you know I'm fastin'
NBA and BGE we on the same thing
Sure you want beef, I drop a check down on your main man
I got some killers with me straight up out that mainframe
Don't know Chief Keef but all my niggas hollerin' bang bang
Pull up, I'm hopping straight out of the cell
KD and Three-Three, they catchin' a sale
Ain't coppin' no deuce, I ain't throwing my hand
Say you want beef and we bringin' 'em hell
These niggas hatin' like they retarded, guess these niggas crazy
On all my babies, quit the facing, I won't let 'em take me
Blue cheese bag, I want Ben on all my faces
Ain't no dope, I beat my laces
I spit that flame, I spit that cajun
Roll that kush, I keep it blazin'
Hit the stage, crowd ragin'
Niggas pissed off 'cause I made it
Two-three chains on me, that's slavery

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & MoneyBagg Yo]
I got that burner on me now, yeah
Whole lot of money on me now, yeah
Diamonds dancing on me now, yeah
Hitters on go and they gon' ride, yeah
Every diamond on me wet
Heard he got anna on his chest
I'ma die 'bout my respect yeah
Got my foot on niggas' necks, yeah
