[Intro]
DJ Swift on the track
I turned the preacher daughter bad, I think I'm a devil
These niggas know what up, know I'm 'bout whateva
I'm in the streets, I keep that heat, you know that I be steppin'

[Verse 1]
I miss the Nawf just like my granny, my heart in them trenches
Yo' girl gon' cheat on you for nothing, so I'm done with these bitches
I think about it every minute, ain't stoppin' my mission
On my payroll I got hittas, I pay 'em commision
Interrogated by detectives, won't tell 'em I did it
I told Montana that I love him, on Dave I meant it
Put twenty thousand on his head, they catch him, I send it
Get on my knee on side the bed like "Father, forgive me"
Was sellin' weed, fucked up my profit, I ain't make a dolla
The fame gettin' to my niggas, I cut off my partners
Before I call on you, I put my trust up in this choppa
Movin' like he can't get touched real quick, I bet I stop 'em
Nigga ain't give me shit but hand out like I owe him something
I don't give a fuck, if we step together, I'll show you something
Bitches think they slick, they all deceive so I'll never love 'em
Bre was my first love but she changed so I'll never trust her

[Bridge]
This the files of a nigga who ain't neva bleed
This the story of a child who was in them streets
Why the fuck I'm taking care of them? They ain't do shit for me
Why the fuck I'm showing you so much love?
And bitch you leaving me

[Verse 2]
Keandre dead, the only thing I think about is Tyler
I'm full of pain but wake up every morning and I'm smilin'
They think I'm dumb, you got me fucked up, I got plenty knowledge
They don't give a fuck 'bout how I feel, they don't know my problems
Just 'cause you around me, I ain't forget 'bout everything you said
I let some shots off in the air for my niggas dead
Do anything in the world for you, I'm livin' red
Showin' love to them niggas, they might bust my head
Mad 'bout a gun, but for a fact bitch I won't do you nothin'
Mad that I'm up but you remember, you ain't give me nothing
I ain't give up on my mission, fuck you mean bitch? I was steady hustlin'
Handin' all you niggas money bitch, and I was steady strugglin'
Montana know about my pain and everything I told him
I told him watch what he was saying, but shit I had to fold him
Up in that cell, bitch I was cryin' with no one to hold me
YoungBoy a soldier, I remember what my grampa told me

[Chorus]
Batty bwoy if you cross, I'ma take your life
I'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight
Tell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright
NBA until the end, it's a way of life
Young nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin
He was abandoned as a child screamin', "Red rum"
You spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder
Livin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come
Yo' ex just exposed you, now you mad like I was neva here
Where I come from I gotta keep this bitch up on my hip
Momma forgive me for all them times I use to trip
Know it's a purpose in this world why I need to live

[Interlude]
It ain't too long
Y'all don't give a fuck 'bout me, bitch
I did something for all y'all, y'all got me fucked up
Off the flap I ain't gotta smile in nobody face
Y'all tell me 'bout all y'all problems, y'all don't ask how I'm feelin' huh?
Bitch I been feelin' like I'm finna die, bitch I cry alone
This for all, this for all them young niggas who gone
And all the people who miss they babies, you heard me?
Fuck everybody who ain't mine, y'all ain't making my life no betta, gang

[Chorus]
Young nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin
He was abandoned as a child screamin', "Red rum"
You spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder
Livin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come
Batty bwoy if you cross I'ma take your life
I'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight
Tell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright
NBA until the end, it's a way of life
