[Intro]
Youngboy
Last life

[Chorus]
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't right
Gotta stay down and get it, I know that it's gon' be alright
Can't get knocked off my pivot, I gotta play my cards right
Gotta stack up them benji's, my nigga we gon' ball for life

[Verse 1]
For so long, I been striving, going hard, tryna make it right
So much pain in my body, know you can see it in my eyes
You say that you was with me, promised that you was down to ride
Now when I look around, you ain't no where by my side
Hurt me so deep, but it's okay, I'm on my grind
I got two sons, I'm just 16, can't waste my time
Straight from the bottom, to the top, I gotta climb
That boy say that he don't like me, tell him fall in line
Soul survivor, I won't stop, yeah I'ma grind for it
I'm from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I done came far
Whole lot of diamonds around my neck, yeah I'm shining hard
I'm sixteen, driving in all these exotic cars
And I don't owe nobody shit, but my mama boy
And my niggas, cause they the one's who behind me boy
Remember I ain't have none to eat, I had to go steal for it
Show you my bank account, I swear I got 6 figures large
Niggas 'round me, they hatin', prolly was snakin' for it
These niggas under disguise, livin' under the board
I guess these niggas they was made for it, but there's
No mistake he play, gon' die cause I ain't going for it

[Chorus]
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't ride
Gotta stay down and get it, I know that it's gon' be alright
Can't get knocked off my pivot, I gotta play my cards right
Gotta stack up them benji's, my nigga we gon' ball for life

[Verse 2]
Aye, I can't even lie I really miss my daddy
Can't trip bout you leaving me
Cause if it wasn't for you, this wouldn't happened
Woke up with a opportunity to feed my family
My limits the stars and I wanna grab it
Yeah I just wanna grab it
I'm on a whole 'nother level

[Chorus]
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't ride
Gotta stay down and get it, I know that it's gon' be alright
Can't get knocked off my pivot, I gotta play my cards right
Gotta stack up them benji's, my nigga we gon' ball for life
