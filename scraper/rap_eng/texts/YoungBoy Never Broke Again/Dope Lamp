Pour up
NeilOnDaTrack
Purpp come from overseas
Bounty hunter, head on, he's a gangster
He been thuggin' tryna keep his head on

[Chorus]
Bad bitch textin' his phone while he's smokin' doja
He thuggin' tryna keep his head on (Head on)
Paranoid he full of doja
Play, gon' get your head blown (Head blown)
Mornin' 'fore court, this nigga woke up smokin' outta pound of strong
Hop out the drop, I told 'em light the way
Uh, wit' a dirty K, yeah
I came through drippin' in another chain, oh-oh-oh-oh
Pull up smokin' on threat, these niggas be lame as lame (They lame as lame, go!)
Bangin' 4K Trey, these niggas can't hang wit' the gang

[Verse 1]
Oh no, buy her pain, nigga pourin' up fours
Servin' heroine, same color the roof (The roof)
Did what I think, I ain't never go wrong (No)
Young nigga came up, overseas for the clothes
Strapped down wit' a pole for a nigga want smoke (Smoke)
Ridin' 'round, tryna slide, smoke a whole lotta dope (Yeah)
Ridin' 'round on a tint, see 12, get low
Nigga know I don't crip but I see blue notes
Speakin' no sense, I ain't got no mind
I'ma let a nigga know bitch, yeah (Bitch)
Pull up turnin' up wit' three
Nigga play, I'ma hit 'em wit' the pole bitch, yeah (Boom, boom, bow)
Chanel boots came white so a nigga bought a shit red, big 38 (38)
When I up wit' the Glock
Blow his top and it's off wit' his head (Off wit' that nigga)

[Chorus]
Bad bitch textin' his phone while he's smokin' doja
He thuggin' tryna keep his head on (Head on)
Paranoid he full of doja
Play, gon' get your head blown (Head blown)
Mornin' 'fore court, this nigga woke up smokin' outta pound of strong
Hop out the drop, I told 'em light the way
Uh, wit' a dirty K, yeah
I came through drippin' in another chain, oh-oh-oh-oh
Pull up smokin' on threat, these niggas be lame as lame (They lame as lame, go!)
Bangin' 4K Trey, these niggas can't hang wit' the gang

[Verse 2]
Broke ass nigga can't hang wit' the gang (No)
Weak ass hoe don't speak on my name
All day smoke dope, nigga straight propane
Massacre, errybody gettin' slayed
Don't love no nigga who's locked in them chains
You a real deal Slime then forever you bang
Better shoot a nigga dead in his face
We don't care 'bout no case
We ain't never been tamed (Buck, buck, buck)
What the fuck?

[Chorus]
Hop out the drop, I told 'em light the way
Uh, wit' a dirty K, yeah

Pull up smokin' on threat, these niggas be lame as lame (They lame as lame, go!)
Bangin' 4K Trey, these niggas can't hang wit' the gang
