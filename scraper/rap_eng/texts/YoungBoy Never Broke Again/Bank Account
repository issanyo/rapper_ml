[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Bet you ain't never met a nigga cut like this, no
Seven figures nigga from the trenches pullin' kick doors
Young boy I'm offcial, I bet I can take your bitch tho
Tryna steal my style, you gon' drown from this drip dawg
Suicide my swag like I'm tryna kill myself
Money holdin' up my pants I don't need no fuckin' belt
Told 'em I don't need no friends, give a fuck 'bout how you felt
Nigga stand from the right but I got hittas on my left

[Pre-Chorus: TK Kravitz]

But I got bitches so let's keep it on the hush
