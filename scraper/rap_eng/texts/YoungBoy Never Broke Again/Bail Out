[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Quicktrip told on Corey 'cause he took his watch
I'm from the bottom, ain't way in hell I could flop
If I got problems then you know they come and spray your block
I pull up in any hood nigga, and set up shop
Them Black Amigo prices, yeah they real righteous
I know some niggas doin' twenties and a couple lifers
I be talkin' to 'em on FaceTime with pounds and knifers
My lil partner facin' twenty, yeah he stuck on Rikers
2004, yeah I caught my first felony
I got caught up on the block, two hundred sacks of weed
Fuck my daddy 'cause that nigga ain't never did shit but street
Behind the walls I'ma make sure all my niggas eat

[Chorus: Young Scooter]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I got that large large money, got a large bag
Gotta pray for Blacko P to get that time back
I told you when you get that time you can't rewind that
And ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to grind for that
2008, nigga I couldn't even make bail
2006, I had my son and I was broke as hell
2009, I started increasin' my clientele
Real talk, I used to sleep in a house full of bales
What's in that car before I ride with you
Oh that's your partner, he ain't ride with you
You get some time, she ain't gon' ride with you
I'll never switch up on my niggas (street)

[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I remember in that cellblock
My first time did thirty times, no I couldn't bail out
I'll never change, I'm in the game, no I won't fall out
From that dice game, that [?] left a lot of stressed out, yeah
Scooter let me get 'em and I got 'em
Young nigga, I'm forever wildin'
Daddy left me as a toddler (fuck 'em)
I'm goin', I ain't stoppin' (no stoppin')
Nigga trippin', you know I stay with it
From the corner, you know I'll red dot him (boom)
BMG, NBA, niggas hatin' 'cause they know we a problem
Mmm, uhhh-yeah
