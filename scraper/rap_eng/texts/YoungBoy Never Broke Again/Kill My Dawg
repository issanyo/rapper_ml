Scottie Pippen, I run with that rock like John Wall
Fuck the system I done did time sittin' behind that wall
Niggas fake, think they plottin' on me, I'ma kill 'em all
2Pac, forgive me if my nigga play then I'ma kill my dawg
Thug life, bandanna on the clip like [?]
Wild life, from cross the track I know you know them boys
Might die tonight, so I ride round clutchin' on my rod
That soldier life, this for them niggas sittin' behind them bars
Know niggas wanna stretch me, I need God to help me
Forever steppin' livin reckless 18 and a felon
Want you for to come test me, I heard these niggas tellin'
Pray to the Devil Lord forgive me if I gotta stretch 'em
Know there's some blood in the air all day I smell it
Preach to them yungins in the ghetto like I be the reverend
Mr. Walk Like Jordan, R.I.P the yungin' I'ma send a message
I'ma kill his boy, then tell his partner that that's just a reference
Demons out at night, you want your life better keep a gun
Steppin' wrong or right you pay the price comin' where I'm from
Bitch it's me or you that's on my soul I'll never run
We make 'em shed blood and tears when it's all done
Load up with them K's hop out and spray, screaming out "why Dave?"
Ain't no turning back this what it is, Lil Boo up in the grave
Play and you get killed that's on my momma speakin' on my name
Bitch I'm bout that drama if it's a problem I'ma bust his brain
I heard these niggas want it, killed him he just wanted money
Kobe thought it was funny, whooped him me and my lil homies
Say I wouldn't amount to nothing, bitch I came up on sumn, they ain't won't give me nun
I'm rich and I'm forever stuntin'
Reach and try to take what I done earned I'm takin' off yo arm
Bitch you must ain't heard these bullets burn, nigga you been warned
Do anything for fame, say lil nigga you better learn to wait yo turn
Put you on the news and I hope that shit there make you learn
BRPD tryna connect me on some bodies
Gang violence, racketeering forever bitch I'm never stoppin'
You got me bent, they got me fucked up if you think I ain't gon' pop it
Love or lust bitch that's a must if you play round with my partner
For that money yungin' willing for to step on whoever
He feelin' like God ain't been answerin' so he pray to the Devil
He moving wrong but he really thinkin' that he too clever
Meechie took 40yrs cause he strangled descendants
You can't win for losing in this street life, clutch on yo burner all that night don't think bout losing yo life
This life I'm living death or jail, man I swear it ain't right
Change up on you take yo money, I can say that I might
