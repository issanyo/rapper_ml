Young nigga turned the dark into light
Through the city we be smashin' through the lights
Gettin' money all praise to most high
Use to wear the same thing now I'm fly
Fuck them niggas, yeah we use to roll tight
They wanna kill me but I'm out in the night
Keep a glizzy when I'm out in the night
Confrontation when we see 'em on sight
Young nigga turned the dark into light
Through the city we be smashin' through the lights
Gettin' money all praise to most high
Use to wear the same thing now I'm fly
Fuck them niggas, yeah we use to roll tight
They wanna kill me but I'm out in the night
Keep a glizzy when I'm out in the night
Confrontation when we see 'em on sight

[Verse 1: NBA Youngboy]
Catch a nigga out of bounds then he dead
Where I'm from you can't live if you scared
NBA we the topic of the feds
You get killed if we catch you talkin' out your head
From the Parrish Catahoula then to Riverbend
Name a nigga played with me stood on all 10
In that cell realized I ain't got no friends
Laid down and now I'm up bitch I'm goin' in
Made a tre' broad day soon as it hit ten
19 for the bricks if you order 10
These niggas rappin' bout some shit that they don't live
He actin' like he bout it that ain't really who he is
38 baby, been robbin' shit  since I was lil
These niggas tryna sell they soul just to get a deal
I can see it in your eyes boy you ain't really real
Born in 99' show 'em how to touch a mill

Keep a 30 on me Curry (Steph)
In your hood I ain't worried
Niggas know I'm with the shits
Plug never wanted to serve me
I'm a threat to the record labels cause I give the young niggas game
Every young nigga on my team
Got way more money than the fame
Twitter beefin' then you lame
We don't play the police games
We don't do the back and forth
We just pull up, make it rain
Young nigga from the Northside, now I'm sittin' court side yeah I got the Loub's on the wood
Gotta pay allot of dues for this lifestyle, fuck rap I was makin' moves in the hood
