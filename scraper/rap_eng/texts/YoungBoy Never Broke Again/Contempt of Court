[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Half a million in my bank now I got zero
9,000 in my pocket to my name though
300K just up in jewelry that I don't want no more
I told my girl motherfuck her, I don't need no ho
I sip on drink so my life could feel like it's movin' slow
Feel like fuck life so on my son I just wanna go

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
And I, I been through it all for real
They spoke on my name, two niggas I had to kill
Motherfuck the fame, I really be thuggin' for real
These niggas be looking, you know that I'm with it
You know that I stay with the steel, hold up

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
C-Bo got straps with us
My Audemars stainless steel
Two condos I ain't never stayed at, I don't know where I live
Got me a check, fucked up my safe
I ain't got nothing for real
My sons got money but I ain't got money
I went and hit that shit for real

[Bridge: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
No you don't love me nigga, you ain't ever give me nothing
Saw they was broke so you know I gave all my niggas something
I bought my mama a mansion and told her she won't want for nothing
I hope that you forgive me for them nights that I was thuggin'

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
And I, I been through it all for real
They spoke on my name, two niggas I had to kill
Motherfuck the fame, I really be thuggin' for real
These niggas be looking, you know that I'm with it
You know that I stay with the steel

[Verse 3: Moneybagg Yo]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I, I ran up them commas for real
I be with Tavo, he stay with that Draco
I be with them gunners for real
I lost some real niggas to the game, money can't heal my pain
I pop a pill, take a sip, I'm just hoping that will fix it
Tunnel vision to the riches
Main bitch bitching, she can't accept the way I'm living
Fast pace lifestyle, time together we don't spend it
She like come home it's urgent
I get that paper and splurge it
Aston Martin V12 engine (skrrt), never had shit so I swerve it
I want that action like movies
If you want smoke with us then prove it
I pour the tray of that Tech up
Now I'm standing up while I'm snoozing
Aqua water from the wrist up
I told her come and take a swim with me
Gang gang 'til the end of me
Never Broke Again, BGE

[Bridge: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
No you don't love me nigga, you ain't ever give me nothing
Saw they was broke so you know I gave all my niggas something
I bought my mama a mansion and told her she won't want for nothing
I hope that you forgive me for them nights that I was thuggin'

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
And I, I been through it all for real
They spoke on my name, two niggas I had to kill
Motherfuck the fame, I really be thuggin' for real
These niggas be looking, you know that I'm with it
You know that I stay with the steel
