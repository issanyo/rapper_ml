[Intro: Kevin Gates & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Hold it, spinnin' for a two piece now
Hey fill up the clip
DJ Chose

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
It's spinnin' for a two piece, well, I meant to say two bands
I just bought a two piece, cookin' it in two pans
(This bitch it hold a hunnid) We grippin' it with two hands
Pack touch down and you know we runnin' through that
Bad bitch, cool, yeah, she love it when I do that
Pull her hair with one, but from the back, grip it with two hands
Spinnin' for a two piece, well, I meant to say two bands
(They refer to me the man) But I already knew that

[Verse 1: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Michael Corleone, bringin' that pressure to all of the oppositions
Hell, nigga, you see that the block is missin'
On the block with a Glock hangin' out the Bentley
Gotta flex and I swear I'm gonna make 'em feel it
Out the top of the drop when I let off the semi
Wanna live like this here? Be a part of the business
Wanna come like this here? Better change yo' attendance
In that order, Iâ€™m a chief did I mention
Honor yo' 40 and see how you get it
Beat up a ho, disrespect to them bitches
Wisdom gon' come when you see what it's written
Under the sun, gotta see what been hittin'
Ain't got no money but flooded a pendant
Dumb in a strip but can't live in a prison
And cut like this here, man these niggas be bitches
Damn

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
It's spinnin' for a two piece, well, I meant to say two bands
I just bought a two piece, cookin' it in two pans
(This bitch it hold a hunnid) We grippin' it with two hands
Pack touch down and you know we runnin' through that
Bad bitch, cool, yeah, she love it when I do that
Pull her hair with one, but from the back, grip it with two hands
Spinnin' for a two piece, well, I meant to say two bands
(They refer to me the man) But I already knew that

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Perfect performance, detergent washin' like dirty laundry
While workin the corner, caught us some weight, servin' the moment
We baggin' up zips, safety pin breakin', whoever want it
I know I no longer love, apply pressure, we goin' up
UAVs be scopin' us, feel like I did not joce enough
We package the opener, diamond teeth, I control enough
Air Forces who go for us, back to back in them Rover trucks
Sit back and be coach, makin' a threat just a joke to us

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
It's spinnin' for a two piece, well, I meant to say two bands
I just bought a two piece, cookin' it in two pans
(This bitch it hold a hunnid) We grippin' it with two hands
Pack touch down and you know we runnin' through that
Bad bitch, cool, yeah, she love it when I do that
Pull her hair with one, but from the back, grip it with two hands
Spinnin' for a two piece, well, I meant to say two bands
(They refer to me the man) But I already knew that

[Verse 3: Youngboy Never Broke Again & Kevin Gates]
How you wanna do it? I-I'll admit, I'm too influenced
Pull the truck behind the house, gloves on, I get into it
28 to 33, come out the pot, it's Patrick Ewing
Drop the weight off, take the plate off in the pin I bought a Buick
Watch how I take off, bring the tape up, but right now, I'm caught up tourin'
Dust that snakes off, I'ma lay low, you a opp, but, bitch, I knew it
Warden knew that he was hit the way I swung it when I blew it
Barrel extend along the front, a black suppressor with a cooler

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
It's spinnin' for a two piece, well, I meant to say two bands
I just bought a two piece, cookin' it in two pans
(This bitch it hold a hunnid) We grippin' it with two hands
Pack touch down and you know we runnin' through that
Bad bitch, cool, yeah, she love it when I do that
Pull her hair with one, but from the back, grip it with two hands
Spinnin' for a two piece, well, I meant to say two bands
(They refer to me the man) But I already knew that

[Outro: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Yeah, with no contradictions, nation business how we livin'
Grew the force, I bet you feel it
Yeah
Bitch, you could love me
You cross me, though, I'ma show you, though
Bitch ass boy
