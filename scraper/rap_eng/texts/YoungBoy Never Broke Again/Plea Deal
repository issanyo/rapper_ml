[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
She like bae give me the game, I can handle the risk
Guide me through the steps, put me to the test
She like when I crack smiles, she say it get her wet
She hate when I lose my temper, say shit I don't regret
I'm just being a nigga, how real is that?
I fuck off when we beefin', how real is that?
Make a promise I keep it, how real is that?
Pullin' straight up when you need me, how real is that?

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
Stole her heart like a booster
She was tired of them brewsters
Now she with the winning circle, stood down on the losers
Ask her how much she love me
She like baby it's crucial
She like I'll go to war 'bout you, pull up and shoot a movie
I fuck off on you when into it sometimes (I do it, I don't know why though)
I might fly a bitch out but I don't give her the time (I fly a bitch out but don't fuck on her, go'n)
Ruth Criss where we used to go dine (remember that shit, just think about it)
Michael Jackson, do you remember the times? (remember that)
I'm tellin' you how it is, tryna express how I feel
I get a little too emotional when I pop a few pills
Drank with me, crack the seals
Ice on me, let's just chill
Asked her why the fuck she single, she like niggas ain't real

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
She like bae give me the game, I can handle the risk
Guide me through the steps, put me to the test
She like when I crack smiles, she say it get her wet
She hate when I lose my temper, say shit I don't regret
I'm just being a nigga, how real is that?
I fuck off when we beefin', how real is that?
Make a promise I keep it, how real is that?
Pullin' straight up when you need me, how real is that?

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
You text my phone mad
Questioning, telling me some shit a bitch had said
I don't got no flaws, admit when I'm wrong, now tell me how real is that
I be needing you wrong when I'm alone, I want you up in my bed
Need me to whip down, I'm only a call, I pull up wherever you at
You my lil gangster bitch, you always be talkin' that gangster shit
You tellin' me step and I don't need no help
I be waitin' on a nigga to play with me
You be feeling some way and don't tell me shit
So how the fuck I'm 'posed to know what you thinking?
So how the fuck I'm 'posed to know how you feeling?
I don't like to argue, you always be tripping
I get my backend from a show and I count it up with you
Now how real is that?
We flex on these hoes, and that shit right there they ain't feelin'
We ain't stoppin' that
Broke up with my ex, I had left through a text
What I got with you I ain't breaking up that
I hate to fly public, I pay for a jet
Whenever we together I won't regret

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
She like bae give me the game, I can handle the risk
Guide me through the steps, put me to the test
She like when I crack smiles, she say it get her wet
She hate when I lose my temper, say shit I don't regret
I'm just being a nigga, how real is that?
I fuck off when we beefin', how real is that?
Make a promise I keep it, how real is that?
Pullin' straight up when you need me, how real is that?
