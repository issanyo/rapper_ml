[Intro]
Just got into it with my homeboy about his cousin
Held it in, I ain’t tell him that I really love her
Fuck with you so much I ain’t tell you she already fucked me
When we had talked she told me that you really feel like fuck me

[Verse 1]
Got so much love for Montana, love him like my brother
He told me I live how I want so I’m forever thuggin’
So many people not around who told me that they love me
Won’t let them know too much ‘bout me ‘cause I don’t fuckin’ trust ‘em
Called me a bum when I asked 3 ‘cause I ain’t had nothin’
Fifteen bands invested in weed just for extra money
‘Member I ain’t had nothing to eat, bitch I came from the struggle
I’m from Louisiana, I turned nothing into something
I just want my son straight if I don’t want for nothing
Helped me a lot but deep inside I really feel like fuck him
Hurt me so deep ‘cause I realized that it’s just ‘bout money
Smile in my face, think I’m a bitch, probably want put me under, yeah

[Chorus]
Y’all changed up on me
‘Bout it I won’t complain
Can’t let you get to me
Give a fuck what you thinkin’
Won’t show no sympathy
‘Cause it’s a dirty game
I know they don’t feel my pain
Can’t let ‘em end my name
Y’all changed up on me
‘Bout it I won’t complain
Can’t let you get to me
Give a fuck what you thinkin’
Won’t show no sympathy
‘Cause it’s a dirty game
I know they don’t feel my pain
Can’t let ‘em end my name

[Verse 2]
Go ‘gainst who boy? I dare ‘em
Prayin’ that I fall but these niggas need to change they prayer
Ask me do I give a damn
‘Bout what these niggas think or what the fuck these niggas outchea sayin’
And, wake up, I’m sippin’ this lean in the morning
Back to back, I do the dash in the foreign
Come in, I bring it however you want it
Whip me, I’m coming, just send me my money
Fuck who ain’t with me, I steady be stuntin’
I guess they don’t like how a nigga be coming
Walking alone if nobody coming

[Chorus]
Y’all changed up on me
‘Bout it I won’t complain
Can’t let you get to me
Give a fuck what you thinkin’
Won’t show no sympathy
‘Cause it’s a dirty game
I know they don’t feel my pain
Can’t let ‘em end my name
Y’all changed up on me
‘Bout it I won’t complain
Can’t let you get to me
Give a fuck what you thinkin’
Won’t show no sympathy
‘Cause it’s a dirty game
I know they don’t feel my pain
Can’t let ‘em end my name
