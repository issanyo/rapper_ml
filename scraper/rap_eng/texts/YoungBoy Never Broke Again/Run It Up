[Intro]
Yeah
Ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Bit on the track like a dog (grrr)
I'ma foam from my mouth like I'm having a seizure
They ain't never pick up when I call (fuck em)
When they call my phone back I decline, I don't need them
I never put trust in my dog (never)
When I'm working, go hard, I don't wanna see him
Hundred bands, I'ma look like a Beatle
Lemme squeeze on the back of the nina
Run it up, Run it up
I got a money fever
Tell me, is your mind made up?
I'm not a normal creature
Plenty nights we stayed up, I'ma misformer breather
Plus I got my mind made up
My logic conformed the people

[Verse 1]
Back in the trenches when I leave the studio
Great power like I'm Julio
Thirty-Five thousand on me in the back of the bucket
Turning up with a big booty ho
Stead't telling me that I need to go
I look in his face and I ask what you mean
Can't comprehend and I'm full of that lean
See the flash in my pocket on top of the bean
When they speak on the topic [?]
Count it up, Act go of me (lean)
What is he saying?
I don't know what he mean
I just know he got money all up in his jeans

[Chorus]
Spit on the track like a dog
I'ma foam from my mouth like I'm having a seizure
They ain't never pick up when I call
When they call my phone back I decline, I don't need them
I never put trust in my dog (never)
When I'm working, go hard, I don't wanna see him
Hundred bands, I'ma look like a Beatle
Lemme squeeze on the back of the nina
Run it up, Run it up
I got a money fever
Tell me, is your mind made up?
I'm not a normal creature
Plenty nights we stayed up, I'ma misformer breather
Plus I got my mind made up
My logic conformed the people

[Verse 2]
Hold up
Never pick up when they calling, not conversating with people
My nigga ain't coming in clutch when I need him
I think that it's love on top of a needle
Smaller my circle and cut off some people
Cause bitch you know that I'm a gangsta
Get out this body, I bet that I spank em
Come in the North and you entering danger
Live like a Rebel and strapped like a Ranger
Stare in your face and can tell what you thinking
Got a lil sister princess and Jalayna

[Chorus]
Run it up, Run it up
I got a money fever
Tell me, is your mind made up?
I'm not a normal creature
Plenty nights we stayed up, I'ma misformer breather
Plus I got my mind made up
My logic conformed the people
Run it up, Run it up
Run it up, Run it up
Run it up, Run it up
