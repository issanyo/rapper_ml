*OG Parker*

[Chorus: Jamie Ray]
When I was 16, I hit a lick, I had no option (I had no option)
Now I got options, bitch I'm poppin', chunky pockets
Doin' big things (big), y'all can't cop it, y'all can't stop it (no, y'all can't stop it)
Too many straps, too many rockets, y'all can't pop it (ooh ooh ooh)
No, I don't ask for approval, if I want that shit, I get that shit (I get it)
No, that ain't your wifey, I just hit that bitch, I hit that lick (I hit it)
Slip threw me the keys, and I just hit 140 in that bitch (whoo, whoo)
I know I'mma get it back, so all I do is spend that shit (yah)

[Verse 1: Jamie Ray]
In the [?], I'm in the lobby, ooh (lobby)
Lit fiesta like R Kelly, Boo, and Gotti, ooh (ha!)
Bad lil' bitch, I swear she got a fuckin' body, ooh (she thick)
Your chick starin' hard, I swear that she a thotty, ooh (thot thot)
Y'all can't catch up
Bitch I'm next up
Roll that pressure
On my dresser
Y'all just cheesy, I got more cheese than Chester (cheese)
Y'all fake as hell, y'all green, I got more green than Lester, ooh
Two chains on me, lookin' like a walkin' check (like a walkin' check)
Try to hit a lick, and we gon' off the TEC (gon' off the TEC)
Play 'round with the set and we gon' off the TEC (pew pew, pew)
You gon' walk the plank, you goin' off the deck (splash!)
Shout out to my home team, Winter Haven, bitch (Winter Haven)
Moved out to the A, so we can make it, bitch (make it, make it)
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, all they do is hatin', bitch ('sup, haters?)
Yeah, I get paid in full, like money makin' Mitch, ooh
I'm a dog, but I ain't on that juice and gin (juice and gin, yah)
Anything I did, I'd probably do again (do again, no regrets)
Free my brother Krazy G, locked in the pen (free my brother)
2019, we gon' blow it in the wind

[Chorus: Jamie Ray]
When I was 16, I hit a lick, I had no option (I had no option)
Now I got options, bitch I'm poppin', chunky pockets
Doin' big things (big), y'all can't cop it, y'all can't stop it (no, y'all can't stop it)
Too many straps, too many rockets, y'all can't pop it (ooh ooh ooh)
No, I don't ask for approval, if I want that shit, I get that shit (I get it)
No, that ain't your wifey, I just hit that bitch, I hit that lick (I hit it)
Slip threw me the keys, and I just hit 140 in that bitch (whoo, whoo)
I know I'mma get it back, so all I do is spend that shit (yah)

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Makin' plays on my iPhone (my iPhone)
Chanel vintage, way from over coast (from over coast)
How I came up, they'll never know ('ll never know)
I was broke, now I got plenty dough (I got plenty dough)
When it come to that check, I be fiendin'
In the Corvette, when I leave I be speedin' (skrrrrt)
Open the Hi-Tech and pour in the liter
My diamonds they wet, water, Aquafina
I got on all red like I'm a demon
Gone on the road, I be chasin' that money
Shinin' everytime you see me (shine)
I keep a gun, no you ain't takin' nothing (blatt)
Handle money like a bank teller
I like to rock Nike, then Margiela
I'm on the road with some cold steppers
I go to war with any nigga
Stackin' money in my sack, baby
Lotta racks in my Gucci denim
I rolled and I gave a check to my nigga
NBA AI

[Chorus: Jamie Ray]
When I was 16, I hit a lick, I had no option (I had no option)
Now I got options, bitch I'm poppin', chunky pockets
Doin' big things (big), y'all can't cop it, y'all can't stop it (no, y'all can't stop it)
Too many straps, too many rockets, y'all can't pop it (ooh ooh ooh)
No, I don't ask for approval, if I want that shit, I get that shit (I get it)
No, that ain't your wifey, I just hit that bitch, I hit that lick (I hit it)
Slip threw me the keys, and I just hit 140 in that bitch (whoo, whoo)
I know I'mma get it back, so all I do is spend that shit (yah)
