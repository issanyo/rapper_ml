[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
Ugh, hold up, federal federal
Trials part two

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & MoneyBagg Yo]
I got trials and tribulations that I'm facing
Laws tryna tie us in on some cases
To that money nigga I be speed racing
If it's a problem then we handle altercations
I got these bags in the trunk, I hope I make it
We gon' stash and count it up at the location
Got some Zoes ridin' with me, that's them Hatians
A lot of allegations, we some fed babies

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
I be runnin' through that money like I'm crazy
My money blue so you know Ben on all the faces
I got them choppers, them Dracos, no three-eighties
Pay up the lawyer, he gon' throw out all them cases
Pop a perc and sip on Tech, that's just to chase it
I'm riding 'round serving these patients, gotta take care of my babies
Got 12 tryna tie me in this shit, they wanna cage me
I remember these niggas was hatin'
Tryna show love now, you can save it
Shit hit so hard you think these diamonds here fugazi
One minute she love me then she don't, this bitch so maybe
If it's pressure let me know, then we'll be on it
My niggas donuts, give it to you, you don't want it
Every diamond on me water like Pisces
Tats all in my face, Mike Tyson
If I go fed my bitch is gon' write me
Pack in, got me striking like lightning
Trap jumping, I'm rolling like dices
My niggas terrorists, guns like ISIS
Nigga be throwing them crosses like Christ's
In the foreign, do the dash like hyphen

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & MoneyBagg Yo]
I got trials and tribulations that I'm facing
Laws tryna tie us in on some case
To that money nigga I be speed racing
If it's a problem then we handle altercations
I got these bags in the trunk, I hope I make it
We gon' stash and count it up at the location
Got some Zoes ridin' with me, that's them Hatians
A lot of allegations, we some fed babies

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I got two bricks up out of Houston, they was fifty thousand
Fucked up the profit and came back, I just made twenty thousand
I'm on the way out to Atlanta, riding with them choppers
My youngins bang the whole eight hours, they was ridin' behind me
Fifty plus fifty, that's a hundred thousand
Feds on my trail, know that they watchin'
Bread gang, nigga fly like a pilot
Money fucked up so you know you can't copy
Fuck the police, yeah you know we ain't stoppin'
Nigga pull up and you know we gon' pop it
Bag after bag, nigga know that we drop it
Body after body, they say the driver
Make a location, I hope that I make it
Collateral damage, I hope they don't take it
Thirty shot Glock and it don't got no safety
Under investigation, fed baby
I only got money for the family
Don't like to spread, you know I ain't cappin'
Fuck niggas be actin', catch 'em shoot a movie
Yeah you knowin' we ain't sparin' 'em
Tryna text me for the pack, you know that we gon' jack 'em
I get that backend from that show and then you know I stack it
Don't fuck with weed, I call three three up just for him to bag it
I like the beef, I straight want smoke, you know we love that static

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & MoneyBagg Yo]
I got trials and tribulations that I'm facing
Laws tryna tie us in on some case
To that money nigga I be speed racing
If it's a problem then we handle altercations
I got these bags in the trunk, I hope I make it
We gon' stash and count it up at the location
Got some Zoes ridin' with me, that's them Hatians
A lot of allegations, we some fed babies

[Outro: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Fed babies (fed babies)
Fed babies (fed babies)
Fed babies (fed babies)
A lot of allegations, we some fed babies
