[Chorus]
Said they behind me but I know that they ain't with me, yeah
Claim they ridin' Imma see who really with me, yeah
I went hard and I finally really did it, yeah
I think they mad that I'm turnt up in my city, yeah
Every show been going up, shoutout to my fans
So much love so much passion it won't ever end
I can see these haters faces, yeah I got 'em mad
Me and Mel in the Bentley Imma do the dash

[Verse 1]
Remember being on that block posted up trying to find me a way to come up
Had to get off my ass, had to find me a jugg for to try to run it up
Looking after my brother I tried selling weed but that was never for me, thug
I was steady fucking up
Started rapping gave it up
What you know bout being jammed up
I was in that box locked up
I was sticking niggas up
Drawed on I don't give it up
Fourteen years on the mission
Ain't no hesitating, hop out and bust
As a baby was taught to go get it
I been hittin licks since I was young
I been hittin licks since I was young
I go hit a lick by myself
As a youngin' had nothing
Ain't nobody wanna help me
All I wanted was some wealth
I had to go get it myself
I ain't never had a role model
Watched Chief Keef growing up
Everybody say they down with me
Shit, they down for they self
Everybody claim they riding
They ain't riding for they self
Everybody wanna kill for me
Everybody wanna step
Everybody steady sliding
Shit I'm sliding for myself

[Chorus]
Said they behind me but I know that they ain't with me, yeah
Claim they ridin' Imma see who really with me, yeah
I went hard and I finally really did it, yeah
I think they mad that I'm turnt up in my city, yeah
Every show been going up, shoutout to my fans
So much love so much passion it won't ever end
I can see these haters faces, yeah I got 'em mad
Me and Mel in the Bentley Imma do the dash

[Verse 2]
You know Imma do the dash, gotta slow down 'fore I crash Three in that Audi behind me, steady trailing on my ass
KD and Ben in the Fen, hit the curb and rip up the rims
Get it fixed and do it again, get it fixed and we smashing again gang
Flying in that ghost, bitch I'm faded, steady thanking god that I made it (thanking god that I made it)
I'm 16 in a foreign going crazy
They hatin' but that shit don't ever phase me

[Chorus]
Said they behind me but I know that they ain't with me, yeah
Claim they ridin' Imma see who really with me, yeah
I went hard and I finally really did it, yeah
I think they mad that I'm turnt up in my city, yeah
Every show been going up, shoutout to my fans
So much love so much passion it won't ever end
I can see these haters faces, yeah I got 'em mad
Me and Mel in the Bentley Imma do the dash
