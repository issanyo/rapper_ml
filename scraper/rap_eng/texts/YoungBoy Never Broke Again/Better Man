[Intro]
Yeah, this for everybody who...
Who lost someone to the streets, or to the system
I catch myself feelin' down from people talkin' 'bout me
They don't even know me though

[Verse 1]
'Round 2005, when I wrote my first rhyme
When I first started I wanted to quit so many times
My brother told me "Trell, you ain't gotta tell no lies"
Went from the ground to my prime, now I'm on the rise
Could see the pain in my eyes but I always smile
Despite the hate, that's on my child I'll never stop
My mama asked me "Son, how it feel to be on top?"
Always had that hustler ambition since I was a child
I drop my nuts and be a man, they don't understand
No matter what I tell my fans, they don't know who I am
They criticize me and don't know me, I don't give a damn
I tell my sons that I love 'em every time I see 'em
My family talk about me, I just act like I don't hear 'em
A nigga ever cross me, swear that I wouldn't wanna be him
I'm from the streets, put you to sleep and I won't shed a tear
So when it's beef, my niggas creep, no they won't let you live
I remember everything lil' Dave said
The image of them killin' you stuck in my head
Forever thuggin', on my brother I ain't scared
I'm screamin' "Fuck em!" they gon' miss me when I'm dead
I told my girl that I love her, please don't change on me
I speak the truth, bae I'm for you, I'll put a ring on it
I tell you everything, honestly 'cause you my homie
I'll put a shield over yo' back whenever it be stormin'
My love for you, I let 'em know, yeah
Me and you, we gon' grow old, yeah
You down for me, and that I know, yeah
What we don't tell, they don't know, yeah

[Chorus]
Up in these streets I done seen so many things
Swear I'm so young for to have so much pain
I ain't have nothin', I had to make it through the rain
They changed on me but man I swear that I won't change
Right now I'm workin' for to be a better man
Ain't have no father, so I had to take a stand
They ain't with me if they ain't feelin' what I'm sayin'
Get up, go get it, you don't need no helpin' hand

[Verse 2]
(How can they change?)
How can they change up on me?
So many needs so I'm workin' hard, no sleep
Yeah I'ma make it, yeah I know 'cause I believe
Could be in jail but in yo' mind you free
Right or wrong, that's yo' decision, accept it and you run with that
I'm with you then I'm with you, I won't change, it ain't none of that
I ain't gotta prove a thing, if you play me then I'm dumpin' that
Hop up in my spaceship, I'm gone, I ain't comin' back
They say "You don't know what you got until it's gone" and I see...
That I'm gone and I ain't comin' back
Got it on my own, I stayed strong and I got what I believed
Man I swear that I ain't comin' back
Told me that you with me and you lied to me
If you my nigga, you my nigga, you gon' ride for me
If you my girl, when it's time, you'd testify for me
I'd die for you, so in return you should die for me

[Chorus]
Up in these streets, I done seen so many things
Swear I'm so young for to have so much pain
I ain't have nothin', I had to make it through the rain
They changed on me but man I swear that I won't change
Right now I'm workin' for to be a better man
Ain't have no father, so I had to take a stand
They ain't with me if they ain't feelin' what I'm sayin'
Get up, go get it, you don't need no helpin' hand
