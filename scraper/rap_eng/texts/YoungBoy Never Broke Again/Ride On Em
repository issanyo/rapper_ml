[Chorus]
You know me, you know that I'm bout whatever
You want with me, thats a bet, it could go to that level
Ain't squashing nothing bitch is up just had a talk with the devil
The only way this shit gone end you getting hit with that metal
You know we ridin on em
Yea we gone slide on em
Drop that bag on em
Make my niggas smash on em
You know we ridin on em
Yea we gone slide on em
Gone drop that bag on em
Make my niggas smash on em

[Verse]
Riding on whoever mane you knowing that we with it
Hop out get to bustin' all my niggas get to hittin'
We don't give a fuck by any means he gone get it
Beef ain't never squash it just die down for a minute
Success make these niggas mad I know how it is
Fame make these niggas flash I know whats the deal
I kept it real from the jump you told them boys I squeal
You know that I ain't had nothing ever since I was lil'
Moving fast I wrecked the Lamb, wish that I was killed
Pay for this shit and finish stuntin you know this my year
I heard a nigga said what? you know what it is
Boy you gone get yo head bust tryna stunt forreal
These niggas making diss songs come on now boy be real
AI Youngboy be the reason that yo dawg killed
I speak this shit I live this shit we do this shit forreal
Book you for a show and get yo stupid ass zipped forreal
These niggas shot my grandma house up with a .22
Spin through that wood tell them people what I did to you
Biggie and Lil Q ran down on em
Special delivery for Youngboy and went to firing on em

[Bridge]
You running round saying this and that bout me
Nigga tell 'em what up bitch
You know we step forreal
Nigga know we on that gang shit fuck wrong witchu

[Chorus]
You know me you know that I'm bout whateva
You want with me thats a bet it could go to that level
Ain't squashing nothing bitch is up just had a talk with the devil
The only way this shit gone end you getting hit with that metal
You know we ridin on em
Yea we gone slide on em
Drop that bag on em
Make my niggas smash on em
You know we ridin on em
Yea we gone slide on em
Gone drop that bag on em
Make my niggas smash on em

[Outro]
Riding on whoever mane you knowing that we with it
Hop out get to bustin all my niggas get they issue
We don't give a fuck by any means he gone get it
Beef ain't never squash it just down for a minute
