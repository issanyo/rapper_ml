[Intro: Sosamann]
Yeah
Ayy, ayy, big bank
Ooh, hold
With special guest Jake Proth
Go, go

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
This the Hunger Games
Where you capitalize and gain energy from pain, yeah, yeah, wop
I'm in another lane
You would think I was a slave how I wear these chains
I got dreams in the making I ain't catch yet
I got things I done started, I ain't finished yet
I got ideas and some plans I ain't process yet
I think it's time for me to set it, happen if you let it, tell me is you ready?
Is you ready? Tell me when to set it, time to go in, I'm gon' go
I stay ready, hold it in, in my throat until I choke
I'ma blow it, I reload it, singin' blues to the note
I'm prepared and I'm ready, takin' chances, shake and roll

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Yeah, Maybach with a curtain, plus it's tinted, can't see in it
Bought a brand new foreign just to show 'em that we winnin'
Plus my Rollie plain, I bet you won't hear it tickin'
Cuban link my chain, paid full cash, it ain't rented
Too legit, a brand new Puma fit that I ain't start yet
Brand new McLaren, it ain't even got a thousand miles yet
Money flyin' like confetti, diamonds all up in my Patek
My baguettes came individual, get my jeweler for to set it
Mind on business and I'm focused, to that money where I'm headed
Brand new Benz, cop my wedding, nigga, tell me, is you ready?

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Time for to set it, tell me to go in, I'ma go
I stay ready, hold it in, in my throat until I choke
I'ma blow it, I reload it, singin' blues to the note
I'm prepared and I'm ready, takin' chances, shake and roll
This the Hunger Games
Where you capitalize and gain energy from pain, yeah, yeah, wop
I'm in another lane
You would think I was a slave how I wear these chains
I got dreams in the making I ain't catch yet
I got things I done started, I ain't finished yet
I got ideas and some plans I ain't process yet
I think it's time for me to set it, happen if you let it, tell me is you ready?

[Verse 2: Sosamann]
Told that bitch be ready, rerock, bring it back, ayy
Tote that MAC-11, can't forget that strap, ayy
Told that boy relax, 'fore I start to clap, ayy
I'm drippin' with slatt, what you know 'bout that? Ayy
Brought out the big guns
Diamonds on Bleveland, they shine like the big sun
I went through the pain and then some
This shit on my back like it weigh a ton
This shit on my back like it weigh a lot
Ride through the town with the babies, Glock thirty clip, yeah
Just hangin' out
Used to sell all the rocks just to make a knot, ayy
Ooh, now I had dreams to do it big and that's just what I did
I made plans to be the man and go out, get rich
I had to take them risks, I went and iced my wrist
I had to capitalize with the sauce, I done went brazy with the drip

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
This the Hunger Games
Where you capitalize and gain energy from pain, yeah, yeah, wop
I'm in another lane
You would think I was a slave how I wear these chains
I got dreams in the making I ain't catch yet
I got things I done started, I ain't finished yet
I got ideas and some plans I ain't process yet
I think it's time for me to set it, happen if you let it, tell me is you ready?
