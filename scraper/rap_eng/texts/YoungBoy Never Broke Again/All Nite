Hit the bando all night
‘till the neighbors ask why i’m up
Down for so long
All i’m thinking bout is coming up
Girls steady lying
And my niggas steady changing up
Gotta do something right
‘cause i’m always fucking up
Now i done seen a lot of shit
When i was coming up
Everyday a struggle
So i hustle just to run it up
Looked at my friends and i seen they was fake as fuck
To keep it real, i ain’t lying, i ain’t got no trust

Hesitant, for to come at me how you did
Hustlin’ and gettin it in
Stacking up malondins
Mind said i’m the business
So i’m skeemin hittin’ licks
Coming up ain’t had shit
I just wanna be rich
