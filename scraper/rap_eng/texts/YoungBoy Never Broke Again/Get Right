[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track
Get right

[Verse 1]
Had to zip me a lil nigga, show him I'm official
They said I'm pussy, now they tryna play me like a killer
Talk like I'm retarded, I went put them diamonds in my dental
Money is my army, drop a bag when I get the feelin'
Shawty got me in my feelings, I couldn't get no ass (ass)
Johnny Blaze, got her mad, I ain't text her back (back)

[Pre-Chorus]
But she just mad 'cause she sad with no fuckin' cash (bitch)
Ain't got no cash and she mad 'cause she fuckin' sad (let's go)

[Chorus]
Slim chick, big ol' titties like she Tokyo (Jets)
When we flyin' out of state, they'll make it to a show
What I tell a nigga when he say that he want smoke
Yeah, with youngin' askin' do I want Capone’s out the store

[Verse 2]
Brick talkin' on a jailhouse yard with some old niggas
Floatin' in a four fifty Benz with a cold pistol
Convicted felon posted in the North with a dirty clip
Do that time, he ain't got no mind, quick to show a nigga
They see I mastermind the game, they tryna burn me out
Bullshit to that lil nigga that they talk about
Benz coupe switch to a Benz truck, I'm whippin' out
I could see they never thought we make them bitches change their thoughts, yeah
With my lil muslim and we pullin' up at any store
Bitch, you must be crazy, I, YoungBoy walk on any hoe
Play and you get blues, I work their bitches like a telephone
I'm not from Iraq, that bitch goes blatt, I'ma let it blow
Make her touch her legs, while I'm pullin' Remy out, her head
My bitch right here, can't speak on that, I know I do that bad

[Pre-Chorus]
But she just mad 'cause she sad with no fuckin' cash (cash)
Ain't got no cash and she mad 'cause she fuckin' sad (fuckin' sad)

[Chorus]
Slim chick, big ol' titties like she Tokyo (Jets)
When we flyin' out of state, they'll make it to a show (bet)
What I tell a nigga when he say that he want smoke
Yeah, with youngin' askin' do I want Capone’s out the store

[Outro]
With my lil muslim and we pullin' up at any store
Bitch, you must be crazy, I, YoungBoy walk on any hoe
Play and you get blues, I work their bitches like a telephone
I'm not from Iraq, that bitch goes blatt, I'ma let it blow
