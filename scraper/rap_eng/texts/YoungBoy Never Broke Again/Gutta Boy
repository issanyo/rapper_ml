[Intro: Allstar Will]
Trap shit, no wack shit, nigga
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Allstar Will]
I pull up and spray up your block (block)
You niggas be hatin' a lot (a lot)
My niggas be playin' with pots (whip)
The fuck you was thinkin' about?
Bitch, I can't let you play on my top
Can't tell me nothin', I'm chasin' this guap (uh uh)
Pay four for a hundred, that make it a bop
Quit wastin' your time, bitch, I'm makin' mines count
Got some bands in my pockets, I ball
Know these haters just wish I would fall
I was stuck on the block [?]
Took some time off, had to see my dogs
Now I'm up, and bitch it's pressure
Strictly business, nothin' extra (nothin' else)
I take your bitch and undress her
Walk through the door see my gun on the dresser (ugh)

[Bridge: Allstar Will]
You know I come from the gutter, boy
Got a nina on me, she'll fuck a boy
You know I run up them hundreds, boy
Pass a bitch down, you a lover boy
You know I come from the gutter
Ain't come up with you, then fuck you (fuck you)
You cross the line, I'ma touch you
Don't care about if I love you
I get them pounds on a muscle
Put sixty rounds in the [?] (yeah, yeah)
I put sixty rounds on your brother (bow, bow, bow, bow, bow)

[Verse 2: Allstar Will]
You know I got out of the gutter
Saw that shit comin', took cover
I get to see who would make it a double
I had to struggle before I could [?]
Now my diamonds wet like a puddle
None of them niggas don't love you

[Chorus: Allstar Will & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
You know I come from the gutter, boy
You know I fuck up them hundreds, boy
Got a nina on me, she'll fuck a boy
You know I come from the gutter
Ain't come up with you, then fuck you (fuck you)
You cross the line, I'ma touch you
Give a fuck 'bout if I love you
I get you murked on a muscle
You know my heart in the gutter
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I ran my bands up in the gutter
Yeah, yeah, yeah (in the gutter)
I'm a product of the gutter
I show you love if I love you (yeah)
I never had time to cuddle
I had to walk in some puddles (yeah)

[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Forever that money I cherish (I cherish)
A half a million I done buried (I done buried)
And I play the game every city (city)
Over two hundred thousand I bet it (I done bet it)
Forever gon' run up that fetti
Whole lotta money, I steady be steppin'
Sit in the back of the car with a MAC-11
Had to tell these lil' niggas I'm ready (bitch, I'm ready)
Yeah, said if they want it, we give 'em the blues
Before the night, he got his face on the news
Pop the top of the drop when I'm uppin' my shoot (brrrt)
When I hop in the whip and I start it go vroom
All of these niggas be bitches
I know for a fact they won't get to my riches
They know me, been know me, they know how I'm livin'
Had to show them lil' boys who the fuck run the city (bitch, who run it)
I swear I couldn't wait 'til I got 'em
Three million dollars, don't know where to hide it
Ride in the North and I'm strapped with a chopper
He flexin' and I get Lil Ben for to rob him
He play him, I'ma stretch him if he got a problem
38 baby, Youngboy the Don Dada
Whatever I do, all my niggas gon' follow
12 shot up KK in his face, we done shot 'em
Slatt

[Chorus: Allstar Will]
You know I come from the gutter, boy
You know I fuck up them hundreds, boy
Got a nina on me, she'll fuck a boy
You know I come from the gutter
Ain't come up with you, then fuck you (fuck you)
You cross the line, I'ma touch you
Give a fuck 'bout if I love you
I get you murked on a muscle
You know my heart in the gutter
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I ran my bands up in the gutter
Yeah, yeah, yeah (in the gutter)
I'm a product of the gutter
I show you love if I love you (yeah)
I never had time to cuddle
I had to walk in some puddles

[Verse 4: Allstar Will]
They always knew I was raw
I fucked the game with no rubber
I spend two thousand on Bape
I got a style like no other
They hatin' right in my face
These niggas blowin' they cover
All of my niggas my brothers
You niggas livin' a lie
You better show your true colors
Don't try me, I'll bust your lil' bubble
I'm straight from the gutter, look

[Chorus: Allstar Will]
You know I come from the gutter, boy
You know I fuck up them hundreds, boy
Got a nina on me, she'll fuck a boy
You know I come from the gutter
Ain't come up with you, then fuck you
You cross the line, I'ma touch you
Give a fuck 'bout if I love you
I get you murked on a muscle
You know my heart in the gutter
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I ran my bands up in the gutter
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a product of the gutter
I show you love if I love you
I show you love if I love you
