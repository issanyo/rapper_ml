[Verse 1]
This shit got crazy when Lil Dave died
When my grandma left couldn't do nothing but cry
Got on my knees send my prayers to the sky,I asked em why I swear so many times, so many times
No matter what i'm going through I hold my head high
On everything for what I love I'd get crucified
Been through some shit I had it hard, no I ain't lying
Been through some shit I had it hard, swear that I ain't lying
Straight off that north no I won't change, I'm still that same nigga RIP to my grandma yell on everything I miss you
We ain't never had nothing, you found us ways to get it
Walking to the show eat from out the cafeteria
Go to school get suspended You would stop Grandpa from hitting me
Never forget the fact my mom put me before a nigga
Never forget my daddy lied to me about coming to get me
They just see how I'm living, they don't know how I be feeling

[Verse 2]
I done starved and ate on 38, 38 Baby Me
I was riding my bike down Chippewa, and I had met 3Three
His mom accepted me in their family
Joe was like my daddy
We want it, we would go and take it
That's if we ain't have it
Was Fucking Up
Ain't no, no better, wanted better days
Nicki moved down the street and I had met Lil Dave
Taught me how to smoke
How to shoot dice and how to cop the jays
You taught me everything, now you in the grave
I still ain't get over what they did you
Ever since I was young, you been my nigga
Put that everything, thats on my lil boys, I miss you
That's on my granny, know I won't every forget you
Look what I accomplished, I know you see me shining yeah
I know you in the sky you looking down here watching yeah
I'm doing something I know my Grandma smiling yeah
I stay focused, stay humble, now I got it yeah
