[Intro: Weebay]
That DohLyfe shit

[Chorus: Weebay]
Ayy, how could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
Held it down for my niggas, never fronted
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
How could you say I ain't a hundred nigga?
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
Held it down for my niggas, never fronted
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
How could you say I ain't a hundred nigga?

[Verse 1: Weebay]
Crazy how the shit go, treat the nigga like my brother
Buyin' money, moved plenty dope, called his mama my mama
Made his drama my drama, niggas bang I bang with you
Roll the window down, aim pistol
One hundred, I'm the same nigga
One hundred never changed nigga
No lames, all bosses
Pussy niggas throwin' crosses
Play me, I'm leaving you leaking like faucets
Shooters is with me, you know that they off it
Bag on your head, put your blood on the corner
Blowing on gas, sipping lean out the bottle
Ain't got shit for niggas but plenty of hollows
Known a nigga since school, yeah, yeah
Now a nigga tryna play it cool, yeah, yeah
A nigga don't respect my rules, yeah, yeah
Have my youngin up that tool, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Weebay]
Ayy, how could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
Held it down for my niggas, never fronted
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
How could you say I ain't a hundred nigga?
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
Held it down for my niggas, never fronted
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
How could you say I ain't a hundred nigga?

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
How can you say I ain't a hundred?
Every time you called I was coming
Gave all my niggas money
Made sure everybody stunting
These niggas like bitches, I swear they be tripping
They ain't thankful for nothing
You know that it's on me, you know that I'm with it
Watch how quick I'ma burn you
We ain't playin' around with that money
I know these niggas hate something
Ain't no ho all in my body
They'll never take nothing
Gone off that drank, every day I'm loaded
Hop in that Jag, drive it like it's stolen
Hundred grand, nigga no it ain't nothin'
All day me and Dake be rollin'
One hundred with all of my niggas, you know that I'm real, yeah
You know that we trill, yeah
We stay with that burner, you know what it is, yeah
Yeah, uhh-uhh

[Chorus: Weebay]
Ayy, how could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
Held it down for my niggas, never fronted
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
How could you say I ain't a hundred nigga?
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
Held it down for my niggas, never fronted
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
How could you say I ain't a hundred nigga?

[Verse 3: VL Deck]
Think you antisocial, no I don't fuck with money
Nerd bag nigga chains, man and I ain't really friendly
Niggas indirect so when I catch 'em I'ma fuckin' bend 'em
Upped the price on you, I'll have you all there by Christmas
Beef ain't never squashed 'til a nigga dead or sittin' in prison
I'm from Edgewood where we shoot until we catch our victim
Oh he at the red light? hit him with that street sweeper
You gon' feel Miami once I hit you with that heater
All I did was keep it real, and you niggas knowing that
Shoe was on the other feet, bitch I couldn't even get a stack
Bond you out plenty times, you forgot about them fronted packs?
But all you do is pillow talk, somethin' for I ain't going for jack

[Chorus: Weebay]
Ayy, how could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
Held it down for my niggas, never fronted
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
How could you say I ain't a hundred nigga?
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
Held it down for my niggas, never fronted
How could you ever say a nigga ain't a hundred?
How could you say I ain't a hundred nigga?
