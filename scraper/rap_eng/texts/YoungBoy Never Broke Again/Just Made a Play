[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I look like I just made a play
I got them bands out the safe
Told [?] ‘nem to go get the K
Niggas broke we gon’ have us a race
Jump out the Bentley and leave in the Wraith
No I can’t see ‘em or hear what they say
Patiently waiting for them to come play, wait
Hold up, pints on the Sprinter van, pour up
These fuck niggas they know us
They know that gang what we throw up
He can try and you know we gon’ blow ‘em
He said what? he gon’ have to come show us
All of my niggas we really can do it
All of my niggas we really can do it, hey

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Versace's was fresh out the case
Ferragamo ‘round my waist
You know my jeans Balmain
Me and you are not the same
You know I’m real fly like a plane
Diamonds all up in my chain
Aiming that rifle, hit you from the range
Boy we strapped up, we ain’t playin’ no games
You know it ain’t nothin’ I can’t handle
Pull up, I’m bringing that hammer
Dirty stick like a ladder
Catch ‘em and hold ‘em for ransom
If they don’t pay we gon’ stamp ‘em
Most of these niggas are bitches
Most of these niggas are actors
Swear to god that they trapping
That ain’t work, now they rapping
Broke niggas hustling backwards
You can smell it through the wrapper
Feel the purp’s in the package
Got it out of town low
Come to the city, we taxing
We don’t know you, probably jack you

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I look like I just made a play
I got them bands out the safe
Told [?] ‘nem to go get the K
Niggas broke we gon’ have us a race
Jump out the Bentley and leave in the Wraith
No I can’t see ‘em or hear what they say
Patiently waiting for them to come play, wait
Hold up, pints on the Sprinter van, pour up
These fuck niggas they know us
They know that gang what we throw up
He can try and you know we gon’ blow ‘em
He said what? he gon’ have to come show us
All of my niggas we really can do it
All of my niggas we really can do it, hey

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Yeah, it look like I just robbed a bank (why you say that?)
Gold chains, Shabba Ranks (I’m shining)
Sipping zips out the pint (right now)
It’s hard to walk on that drank
I’ll never go broke again
I just did a walkthrough for ten
Versace shades, pay the same for the lens, hey
I’m allergic to fuck shit, I sneeze (achoo)
I be poppin’ them pills with the V’s (them percs)
I be driving them cars with no keys (skrt)
Pull up with them straps on me like Steve
Urkel, I’ll never go commercial, ayy
I’m a boss, you a worker, ayy
Yellow tape, white chalk, blue lights
Play with me, you know it’s murder, ayy
Hold up, a hundred round drum what it hold
Shoot ‘em and go do a show
I’m having this shit
I hopped out the Aston Martin then I hopped in the Rolls

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I look like I just made a play
I got them bands out the safe
Told [?] ‘nem to go get the K
Niggas broke we gon’ have us a race
Jump out the Bentley and leave in the Wraith
No I can’t see ‘em or hear what they say
Patiently waiting for them to come play, wait
Hold up, pints on the Sprinter van, pour up

They know that gang what we throw up
He can try and you know we gon’ blow ‘em
He said what? he gon’ have to come show us
All of my niggas we really can do it
All of my niggas we really can do it, hey
