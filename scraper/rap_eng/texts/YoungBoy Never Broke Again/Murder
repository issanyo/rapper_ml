[Intro]
Nigga play he gone get his head bust
You know how we comin
Young Boy

[Chorus]
Nigga play he gone get his head bust
You know how we comin
Strapped like the Navy Seals
Promise you don't want it
This for them bitch ass niggas that be speaking on me
Rob who ? you got me fucked up
You ain't taking nuthin
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Play with that money
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Come run up on me
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Burn you and yo homie
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Thinkin that I'm Stuntin
It's gone be a murda

[Verse 1]
Gon' be a murda if you thankin bout takin sum from me
Talk about your body but I bet you ain't gone play with me
Try me if you wanna I stay with that burner on me (watchu doin' ?)
I can't let you get a rip off me
Nigga must think I'm a hoe or some
I don't know who the fuck he must take me for
That shit that you talking ain't fearing us
Fuck how you come you ain't seein us
Say we beefin and no catching me, wet him up
Nigga tell me pull up and I'm pullin up
Up let it bang we ain't sparing nun
Caught him up in the bottom and he ran from me
Hoe ass niggas stay in yo lane
You niggas be playin we ain't playing games
When I'm up in the club bitch I'm with the gang
You can catch us turnin up for Dave
So you know we flexin with them bands
Whole lotta more up in my pants
Try to take it all you hear is bang
Try to take it all you hear is bang

[Chorus]
Nigga play he gone get his head bust
You know how we comin
Strapped like the Navy Seals
Promise you don't want it
This for them bitch ass niggas that be speaking on me
Rob who ? you got me fucked up
You ain't taking nuthin
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Play with that money
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Come run up on me
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Burn you and yo homie
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Thinkin that I'm Stuntin
It's gone be a murda


[Verse 2]
Pants sagging from the 38
Bitch I trap on the corner where Deno stay
And you know we strapped up if a nigga play
Off side of the club got them 12 gauges
On scene I'ma shoot
Think I'm stunting nigga play with me
On Lil Dave ain't no hoe in me (fuck you mean ain't no hoe in me ?)
NBA Youngboy, thousand shots come behind me
In the nawf where you find me, on Chippewa bitch I'm in the streets
NBA Youngboy, thousand shots come behind me
In the nawf where you find me, on Chippewa bitch I'm in the streets

[Chorus]
Nigga play he gone get his head bust
You know how we comin
Strapped like the Navy Seals
Promise you don't want it
This for them bitch ass niggas that be speaking on me
Rob who ? you got me fucked up
You ain't taking nuthin
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Play with that money
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Come run up on me
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Burn you and yo homie
Nigga it's gone be a murda
Thinkin that I'm Stuntin
It's gone be a murda
