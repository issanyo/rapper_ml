[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Mothafuck them niggas and what they say about me (said 'bout me)
You do too much talkin', you a fed, prolly (fed, prolly)
Drive-by in my pocket, got them dead bodies (dead bodies)
My Goyard look like morgues, that's them dead bodies (dead bodies)

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
R.I.P. (R.I.—) R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
30 thousand, I just hit for three (I hit for three)
R.I.P. (R.I.—) R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
Don't pay these bitches, she gon' fuck for free (she gon' fuck for free)
R.I.P., R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
I'm in that foreign, that's like 60 G's (that's like 60 G's)
R.I.P., R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
Dead prezis, I'm on a killin' spree (killin')

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Killin' spree (spree), covered in Supreme (yeah)
Strapped with a beam, with them racks all in my jeans (all in my jeans)
Brand new Benz (Benz), that's a hunnid G's (a hunnid G's)
If I drop 20, I'll most likely hit for three (yeah, yeah)
Foreign keys, droppin' the top when I hop in the Bentley
I'm takin' the doors off the Lamb', these niggas be hatin', they say that it's rented (rented)
Overseas, .38 Baby, deposit, they sent it (sent it)
I'm takin' off 23, no Michael Jordan, I cover myself in Givenchy
I do too much flexin', what they say about me (what they say about me)
Dead prezis in my pocket, that's your head, prolly (that's your head prolly)
He do too much talkin', he on meds, prolly (he on meds, prolly)
But I'm screamin' fuck them niggas and what they say about me
'Cause I'm steady hollerin'

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & Offset]
R.I.P. (R.I.—) R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
30 thousand (thousand), I just hit for three (I hit for three)
R.I.P. (R.I.—) R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
Don't pay these bitches, she gon' fuck for free (she gon' fuck for free)
R.I.P., R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
I'm in that foreign (hey), that's like 60 G's (that's like 60 G's)
R.I.P. (hoo), R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
Dead prezis (dead), I'm on a killin' spree (killin')

[Verse 2: Offset]
Catch him down bad, he sleep, stankin' bodies out here reek
Black coupe look like Deacons, gang full of hyenas
Sippin' on drank, I'm gettin' paranoid, what's that noise? (Woo!)
Fuckin' on somebody's bitch tonight, it's yours, is it yours? (Which one)
Smokin' on cookie blunts so much you smell it out my pores (smell it)
I got this stick on me now and I don't wanna shoot, but you feelin' the sword
MC Hammer like Thor (hammer time), she wanna fuck, sure (smash)
I shit on your cow manure (brrt), empty my clip and my wrist is sore (hoo)
We want action
All my niggas in the field, nigga, what's happenin'? Laws of attraction
Hit him with the butt of the steel like I'm baseball battin' (hey), never subtractin'
P-90 hit, no kick, it split and turn your ass to a fraction
My wrist is lit, I'm Mr. Drippy-Drip, I'm givin' out classes (brrt, brrt)

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
R.I.P. (R.I.—) R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
30 thousand, I just hit for three (I hit for three)
R.I.P. (R.I.—) R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
Don't pay these bitches, she gon' fuck for free (she gon' fuck for free)
R.I.P., R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
I'm in that foreign, that's like 60 G's (that's like 60 G's)
R.I.P., R.I.-R.I.P. (R.I.P.)
Dead prezis, I'm on a killin' spree (killin')
