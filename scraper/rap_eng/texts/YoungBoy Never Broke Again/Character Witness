[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
Federal, Federal
Southside

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
We can fuck and duck off but you gotta hush up
Talkin' all that gangster talk gon' get you touched up
Rush up, I'ma up and let it burn like Usher
Hood rich and famous, got the juice, no jungle
Told the jeweler Mike 'n' Ike me (all different colors)
Double cup, my icy
All my hoes wifey (all of 'em)
Feds want to indict me (probably)
Niggas sendin' threats and shit, I don't take it lightly (I don't)
Fuck them haters really
Count this money up, excite me (I love it)

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Run up this money, them bitches gon' fuck 'em all, that's for nothin'
Chasin' that money, you know I'm gon' get it
I'm straight out the north, bitch I'm straight out the gutter
Fuck on that bitch then I fuck on her sister
After that I pass that ho to my brother
You know I ain't lovin' her, know I ain't cuffin' her
Strapped when I'm with her, you know I ain't trustin' her
Hop out the Benz, I'm straight in the Tesla
After I hit her you know I ain't textin' her
Fifty thousand, fifty shots on me now
Cup full of drank and I'm sippin' that medical
YoungBoy and Bagg, that's 38 federal
Confidential, nigga know we ain't tellin' nothin'
Really sip lean, know we ain't sellin' nothin'
Run up on us, watch how quick we gon' step 'em somethin'

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
We can fuck and duck off but you gotta hush up
Talkin' all that gangster talk gon' get you touched up
Rush up, I'ma up and let it burn like Usher
Hood rich and famous, got the juice, no jungle
Told the jeweler Mike 'n' Ike  me (all different colors)
Double cup my icy
All my hoes wifey (all of 'em)
Feds want to indict me (probably)
Niggas sendin' threats and shit, I don't take it lightly (I don't)
Fuck them haters really (fuck 'em)
Count this money up, excite me

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
I'm runnin' through the money like I'm runnin' through these bitches, I'm dumb with it
Diamonds hittin' so fuckin' hard, you would swear that the sun in it
Fuck the media, blog sites take your lil shit and run with it
Hoes be wantin' me to fuck with no rubber, prayin' I cum in it
That's what I give for fuckin' with the Mexican bitch from the city
(What happened with it Yo?)
Lost her mind, went and got MoneyBagg tatted on her titty
Told you we can fuck off, but you gotta keep quiet
Walked in the club and turned up, got them choppers outside

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
We can fuck and duck off but you gotta hush up
Talkin' all that gangster talk gon' get you touched up
Rush up, I'ma up and let it burn like Usher
Hood rich and famous, got the juice, no jungle
Told the jeweler Mike 'n' Ike  me (all different colors)
Double cup my icy
All my hoes wifey (all of 'em)
Feds want to indict me (probably)
Niggas sendin' threats and shit, I don't take it lightly (I don't)
Fuck them haters really (fuck 'em)
Count this money up, excite me (I love it)
