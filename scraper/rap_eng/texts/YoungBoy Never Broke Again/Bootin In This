[Chorus]
Bootin' in this bitch
Bootin' in this, bootin' in this bitch
We up in this bitch, I don't care who up in this bitch

[Verse 1]
This for them niggas on the pills tonight
This for them niggas out they top screaming boy you can play and gon' get killed tonight
Play and you gon' lose your life
All of my niggas 'bout that steppin', you can test me and I bet you gon' get stressed tonight
Shit, who you with tonight? my niggas 'bout it
Cutthroat ready for some problems and we all goin' on that sight
Trippin', we gon' get 'em right
Know how we coming
Catch 'em buckin', we gon' fuss 'em
I'ma up 'em when I get on sight
Shut the club down, just let me craze
Nigga all that stunting and jumping gon' get you zipped fast
Go down when I flash, shoot this bitch up fast
Nigga you can't get past, flatline your bitch ass, gang

[Chorus]
Bootin' in this bitch, bootin' in this bitch, bootin' in this
Bootin' in this bitch, bootin' in this bitch, bootin' in this
We up in this bitch, I don't care who up in this bitch
We gon' lose it in this bitch if niggas [?] in this bitch
Bootin' in this bitch, bootin' in this bitch, bootin' in this
Bootin' in this bitch, bootin' in this bitch, bootin' in this
We up in this bitch, I don't care who up in this bitch
Bootin' in this, bootin' in this, bootin' in this, bootin' in this
