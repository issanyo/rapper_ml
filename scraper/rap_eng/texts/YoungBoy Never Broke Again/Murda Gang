Bitch ass nigga

[Chorus]
One these niggas die, people gon' say that we did it
You know we how we livin', bitch you knowin' that we with it
Catch you you gon' get it, run up put one in your fitted
Sickest in the city bitch you knowin' how we livin'

Murda Gang, Murda Gang

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm from the north, you know what up with me
Niggas know it's dump with me
You run up, you ain't touchin' me
Nah I swear that you can't fuck with me
My niggas they gon' bust for me
Bitch I could get you touched for free
My niggas pull up on your street
Just dropped ten thousand on my grill
Dumb bitch you know it's real
Daddy waitin' on the appeal
So I'm chasin' for them M's
Yeah he talkin' out his grill
I'ma shoot him when I see him
Nigga know we steppin' for real
Big E, he slang the chopper for real bitch
Make me hit the kill switch
You know we the dumbest
Up in public we'll dump it
And I put that on McDonough
And I stunt a lot of money, I can't stack that shit for nothin'
And I put that on Lil' Dave
Gon' die, you try to take it from me

[Chorus]
One these niggas die, people gon' say that we did it
You know we how we livin', bitch you knowin' that we with it
Catch you you gon' get it, run up put one in your fitted
Sickest in the city, bitch you knowin' how we livin'
Bitch you knowin' how we livin'
Murda Gang, Murda Gang
38 Baby when I run up, bitch I'm sprayin'
Murda Gang, Murda Gang

Feds in my section, think they tryna catch me bitch
You can do that flexin', get hit with this Wesson bitch
You could try to test me, watch how quick I stretch you bitch
Watch how shit get hectic, spinnin' through your section bitch
We be on that bang shit, know we on that gang shit
Fuck 'bout what you claim bitch, make me snatch your chain bitch
Nigga we know slang this bitch

Pull up, man I dare that bitch

[Chorus]
One these niggas die, people gon' say that we did it
You know we how we livin', bitch you knowin' that we with it
Catch you you gon' get it, run up put one in your fitted
