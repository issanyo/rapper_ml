[Intro]
Wheezy Beats

[Chorus]
Importin' them drugs from Colombia (Colombiana, no Santana)
I'm with some hitters case they run in here (keep that hammer, keep that hammer)
Don't like the tension, better not tempt me, please don't fuckin' stare (don't fuckin' stare)
That Christian Loub'in like Givenchy, I got several pairs
Yeah, young rich nigga (young rich nigga, I'm a young rich nigga, ayy)
Public figure (public figure, I ain't no public figure, no)
I run with killers (I run with killers and all we want is smoke)
Black Egyptians (black Egyptians, oh)

[Verse 1]
Big greens and sea boat L, got kilos in the whip
Strapped up in case you trip, Hi-Tech, pour a four and sip
Diamond ring inside my lip, I buy CÃ©line gifts
No public figure, young rich nigga (young rich nigga, I'm a young rich nigga)
I stack that money, my racks bigger (my racks bigger, my racks bigger)
Bitch I'm a reaper, I'm a killer (I'm a killer, hey)
State property, Beanie Sigel
I'm close to the water like seagulls
Heroin, I don't play with needles
If you want your bitch, better keep her
Once I fuck I'm gon' mistreat her
Once I fuck I gotta eat her
Pour syrup all in the liter
Devil child, bitch I'm a demon (demon, yeah)

[Chorus]
Importin' them drugs from Colombia (Colombiana, no Santana)
I'm with some hitters case they run in here (keep that hammer, keep that hammer)
Don't like the tension, better not tempt me, please don't fuckin' stare (don't fuckin' stare)
That Christian Loub'in like Givenchy, I got several pairs
Yeah, young rich nigga (young rich nigga, I'm a young rich nigga, ayy)
Public figure (public figure, I ain't no public figure, no)
I run with killers (I run with killers and all we want is smoke)
Black Egyptians (black Egyptians, oh)

[Verse 2]
Heard a nigga say that he don't fuck with me
I'm ready for to go tour overseas
Percocet pill, that's all I need
Eyes all red, I'm a devil seed
I'ma see that money like I see trees
Got a fat white bitch want fuck on me
I'ma feed my hunger and all my needs
Won't let that shit take a toll to me (no)

[Chorus]
Importin' them drugs from Colombia (Colombiana, no Santana)
I'm with some hitters case they run in here (keep that hammer, keep that hammer)
Don't like the tension, better not tempt me, please don't fuckin' stare (don't fuckin' stare)
That Christian Loub'in like Givenchy, I got several pairs
Yeah, young rich nigga (young rich nigga, I'm a young rich nigga, ayy)
Public figure (public figure, I ain't no public figure, no)
I run with killers (I run with killers and all we want is smoke)
Black Egyptians (black Egyptians, oh)
