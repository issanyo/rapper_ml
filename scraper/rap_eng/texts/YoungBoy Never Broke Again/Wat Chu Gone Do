NBA Gang, what they claimin' lil nigga
Tell me what the fuck you thinkin' lil nigga
Don't point the finger up the banger lil nigga
No we don't bluff when it come to a nigga
No hesitation we handle the business
Take something from me we gon' cut off his fingers
Reach for my chain then get hit with the glizzy
Me and my niggas we come from the trenches
Walkin' in public we strapped with extensions
Need more than that hoe for to catch me lil nigga
You know we ain't puttin' our trust in these bitches

Young Boy, Young Boy, really drippin' lil nigga

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Chasin' a check got the dick on the tec
Neighborhood crip when i chuck up my set
Two tonka tecs with the invisible set
Rollie that day with the booger baugettes
Put them bricks back together let's get to the check
Bails in the vet, hunnit rounds Kel-Tec
Choppa you hibach you thu-thu threw ya breast
Cuban link on my neck feature Lex Luger
What chu gon' do when they hop out with rugers
Dope don't cut nigga hollywood movies
John Wick shooter cut your body like Krueger
NBA Youngboy we come through recruiting
Shooter, shoot the shooter one in your medulla
Longway Ricky ruler stendo sticks still in school
Young gorilla work the vacuum seal
Sell a brick of bew what chu gon' do?
Made the breaking news gelato white the coupe
Baby blue and red my shooter piru
When I up and dump lil bitch what chu gon' do?
Gagging just to gang bang on yo crew
Put respect on it, pull up and check on 'em
Don't let me find out you gon' flex on 'em
Don't let me find out that you fu-fu-fugazy
Don't let me relate what you wait on it
LONGWAY BITCH

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
