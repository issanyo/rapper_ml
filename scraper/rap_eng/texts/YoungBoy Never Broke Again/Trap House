[Intro]
Eh, eh
Dubba-AA flex
Uh, slatt, big choppa on my name
Go tell 'em

[Chorus]
Trap house, trapped out, every pack gone now
Big knots, big watch, big Glock .45
Straight up out them trenches, now young nigga rockin' shows now
Told 'em pay attention, bitches listen, cut your phone off
Five phones, lotta dope, thick hoes, condos
Big guap, big poles, nigga play, I let it blow
Nigga talkin' like he raw but you know I really know
When they try to cut me off, I'ma show how it go

[Verse 1]
Pull up flexin' with my niggas with some shiny bones
I told him that that shit won’t long, I had to buss it down
Yeah talkin' like he want some smoke, he betta bump it down
Thuggin' with his niggas, pussy when they not around
Big house, big Glock, big knot, no lie
Say he want with me, bet, catch him, hit him with that fire
House arrest on my leg, got in trouble with the cops
Fuck that, post up, 100 shots on that block

[Chorus]
Trap house, trapped out, every pack gone now
Big knots, big watch, big Glock .45
Straight up out them trenches, now young nigga rockin' shows now
Told 'em pay attention, bitches listen, cut your phone off
Five phones, lotta dope, thick hoes, condos
Big guap, big poles, nigga play, I let it blow
Nigga talkin' like he raw but you know I really know
When they try to cut me off I'ma show how it go

[Verse 2]
Say we beefin' (What?)
Shawty tweakin', catch him out in public, up and squeeze it
Where I find that bitch the same spot that I'ma leave it (fo' real)
Text a paragraph, don’t read it, bitch I straight delete it
Stupid bitch say I’m conceited, pull up flexin' bad (slime)
.40 Glock I buss yo' ass, say she like my swag
Whole lotta money in my bag, make me test your ass
Bitch I’ma kill you, if you don't pass, I ain’t never mad, I cut a hoe off super fast

[Chorus]
Trap house, trapped out, every pack gone now
Big knots, big watch, big Glock .45
Straight out them trenches, now young nigga rockin' shows now
Told 'em pay attention, bitches listen, cut your phone off
Five phones, lotta dope, thick hoes, condos
Big guap, big poles, nigga play, I let it blow
Nigga talkin' like he raw but you know I really know
When they try to cut me off I'ma show how it go

[Outro]
Ya heard me?
I ain't got no
Used to wash my clothes
