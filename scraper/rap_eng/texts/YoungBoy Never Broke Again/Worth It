[Intro]
Dubba-AA flex
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They say you fear what you don't know
But you really feel what you know
DJ Swift on the track

[Chorus]
Would it all get better, yeah
Tell me was it all worth it?
No fortune teller make me clever, yeah
Deep inside I been hurtin'
Tired of tryin' and I'm sick of crying-ing
I been searchin' mind-inds, baby I been lurking, yeah
You left me clueless time after time
I'm behind the blind-inds, as I open up the curtains, yeah
Did you do this shit on purpose?
Did you do this shit on purpose? yeah
I ain't do that shit on purpose, yeah
Swear I ain't do that shit on purpose, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
It's the fault up in the sky, I be stressin' at night
Livin' life up in the wrong and I know it ain't right
Always said that love is poison, take control of my life
I'm immortal, I never die, I'll never let go my pride
I got them racks on me now, drive-bys, nigga I make the news
My past is haunting me now, run away, last thing for to do
Young nigga reckless, I don't follow rules
Never a change that never I'll do
Committed to you so I never'll choose
Deep in that ocean, my love is for you

[Verse]
Whole lot of bread I got, you want it, you got it off top
Never break, heart hard like a rock
Got my back on the wall like a clock
To the top from the ground, can't flop
Stole all my love so I closed up shop
'Fore I let a nigga play you, swear I die
Why I question your loyalty, I don't know why
Never ever saw a thug cry
When I stare in your eye I can tell that's a lie
When you ask me somethin' I keep it real
Why you not honest? I don't know why
Got four sons but I want five
I want you to have my child
Say that I hurt you, ain't do it on purpose
Pride level sit at most high

[Interlude]
I'm not really loyal, yeah
I sit there and lie, and I wonder why he don't trust nobody, yeah
Why though?
I hope that's what you're sittin' there thinkin' to yourself

[Chorus]
Would it all get better, yeah
Tell me was it all worth it?
No fortune teller make me clever, yeah
Deep inside I been hurtin'
Tired of tryin' and I'm sick of crying-ing
I been searchin' mind-inds, baby I been lurking, yeah
You left me clueless time after time
I'm behind the blind-inds, as  I open up the curtains, yeah
Did you do this shit on purpose?
Did you do this shit on purpose? yeah
I ain't do that shit on purpose, yeah
Swear I ain't do that shit on purpose, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
It's the fault up in the sky, I be stressin' at night
Livin' life up in the wrong and I know it ain't right
Always said that love is poison, take control of my life
I'm immortal, I never die, I'll never let go my pride
I got them racks on me now, drive-bys, nigga I make the news
My past is haunting me now, run away, last thing for to do
Young nigga reckless, I don't follow rules
Never a change that never I'll do
Committed to you so I never'll choose
Deep in that ocean, my love is for you
