[Chorus]
She said that money ain't worth nothin' if you can't treat me right
I clearly see bitches ain't shit, they just want see me cry
Young nigga rollin', keep that Glock 'cause shit ain't safe out at night
I say the money and betrayal got my mind hypnotized

[Verse 1]
Lies, that's what they told me
I never asked for shit at night, only for you to hold me
I did it out of love, baby, never said you owed me
Now I don't wanna fuck with you, it's gonna kill me slowly
Straight out that north, I made it out, don't mix me in the shit they say
My feelings fallin', money callin', how we movin', shit ain't safe
I'm roamin' through LA alone with a burner on my waist
At night, I pray I make it home, them pussy boys know where I stay, might jump the gate
But fuck that, I'm strapped up, ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Somethin' must be in them nigga's head wrong if they thinkin', I ain't clutchin'
Can't take cover when I start bustin'
Leave 'em like one said they love me
Patrol still wanna cuff me
No love for one, say fuck me
You supposed to be the one I run to, but you ain't 'round
Never knew to succumb to, I don't know how
I lost my love for that dream and I don't know if it could be found
You always bringin' some shit up, never once tried to put you down

[Chorus]
She said that money ain't worth nothin' if you can't treat me right
I clearly see bitches ain't shit, they just want see me cry
Young nigga rollin', keep that Glock 'cause shit ain't safe out at night
I say the money and betrayal got my mind hypnotized

[Verse 2]
One person I'm lovin'
Nobody I'm trustin'
Straight out of them trenches, I'm thuggin'
To me you the world, but I never could tell you wasn't keepin' it real
You was billing your budget
You see me with bitches you think that I cherish
You ask them a question, they can't tell you nothin'
Bad news and it's comin' out ugly
Truth be told, you was plottin' on somethin'
Money mean nothin' when you really love someone
How I be livin' take up time and we could have a one on one
And fuckin' off ain't that important when you really for someone
I'm scared to open up my heart, I always been so nonchalant
I just wanna live with you, build with you, smoke with you, yeah
I know you think the shit I say
But you just wanna misuse me and lie, said that I ain't never cared
You left yo' diary by the bed

[Chorus]
She said that money ain't worth nothin' if you can't treat me right
I clearly see bitches ain't shit, they just want see me cry
Young nigga rollin', keep that Glock 'cause shit ain't safe out at night
I say the money and betrayal got my mind hypnotized

[Outro]
She said that money ain't worth nothin' if you can't treat me right
I clearly see bitches ain't shit, they just want see me cry
Young nigga rollin', keep that Glock 'cause shit ain't safe out at night
I say the money and betrayal got my mind hypnotized
