[Intro]
Ohh
Show you somethin' you never seen
Yeah
My nigga Wheezy, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus]
I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen

[Verse 1]
I don't seem to understand these things
I be rollin' outta bounds
I keep a beam steady goin' on lean
Love over passion, tell me what it mean
Live like a gangster, I don't fit right with them things
Money talkin' like a preacher, blew that strap in the bottom
He tried runnin', knew they was comin', bounty hunters done caught
Toss all yo' feelings in a lake once they locked in a bottle
I'm too aggressive, please excuse me
You know how I'm rockin', I'm thuggin'

[Chorus]
I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen
I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen

[Verse 2]
You actin' funny all of a sudden
Well, bitch, just say you don't love me
Infiltratin', gone on occasions like you tryna hide somethin'
I never lie, always admit 'cause I be feelin' like, "fuck it"
I wouldn’t want you to lie to me, you happy when you leave
I been done dirty and I’m scarred so I don't fuck with no bitch
You probably fuckin' but I still won’t let a hoe suck my dick
You got me fuckin' up my song 'cause I’m so mad about the shit
I just got spirits on my phone, it ain’t no human you bitch, haha

[Chorus]
I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen
I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen
