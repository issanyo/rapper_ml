[Chorus]
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’

[Verse]
Who the fuck in that north 'round there sellin’ them pounds?
Send the location, we gon’ take him down
We goin’ in and we movin’ ‘em off
Four young niggas and we strapped with them rounds
We taking everything, wiping ‘em off
Toe tag him, anything come out his mouth
I take them racks and I shoot out of town
These niggas ain’t on that shit that we on
I ain’t trusting no bitch that ain’t loyal
They full of hatred, man I swear that they evil
Tryna get me up out of my money
Then they sit and claim that they don’t need you
Told that bitch you can leave ‘cause I really don’t need you
Don’t want mistreat so ho I’ma leave you
Fuck the relations, we get to this paper
Steady stacking that money so tall I can’t see you
I ain’t got my money, they don’t call for no features
Fuck these rappers, know I know I don’t need you
You know I’m real hot just like a heater
Neck real cold just like a freezer
Mind full with a whole lot of demons
The real real every time that I’m preachin’
If I wanna touch him bet I’ma reach him
Foreign whip, leave the scene just screeching

[Chorus]
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’

[Bridge]
You know that we can do whatever
Right now I’m coolin’ with my brothers, yeah
I’m talkin’ cold, bloody steppers
Told Lil Ben to go and get the shovel
This shit that I’m on make me feel special, yeah

[Chorus]
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
You know I ain’t playin’
