[Intro]
Free my niggas out the can
Nigga, this that crazy man
I ain't even put no effort, crazy man

[Verse]
Draw down with that Glock, bitch don't make no sound
Say somethin' and get shot, bitch face down to the ground
I ain't got no respect, you might think I'm dumb
I'm just 17, with a whole lotta money
Fuck you, bitch I hopped up out that coupe
Tell me hoe, if you don't like me why you worried about what I do
See the car I pulled up in so you might think I flew
(Tell me why you say that Youngboy?)
Cause bitch I'm flyer than your dude
If you think I fuck with that lil hoe, then you a fool
I ain't got no education, I dropped out of school
No security with me so I'm strapped up with that tool
Try to take my jewelry off and you gon' make the news
Cuban links around my neck, it cost me 22
Audemar Piguet, coulda' went and bought a school bitch
Went to Neiman Marcus for my pants and my shoes bitch
Five thousands dollars, what I paid for the whole fit
I just took a loss so I'm goin' on a heist bitch
Hold a tool in yo face like chino do a bike bitch
Too much money on me for to raise my hands and fight bitch
Thunder in my clip, fuck around get hit with light bitch

Draw down with that Glock, bitch don't make no sound
Say somethin' and get shot, bitch face down to the ground
I ain't got no respect, you might think I'm dumb
I'm just 17, with a whole lotta money
Fuck you, bitch I hopped up out that coupe
Tell me hoe, if you don't like me why you worried about what I do
You ain't see the car I pulled up in so you might think I flew
(Tell me why you say that Youngboy?)
Cause bitch I'm flyer than your dude
