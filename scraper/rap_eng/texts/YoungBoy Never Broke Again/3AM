[Intro]
You have not been sick stop fuckin' lying
You fuckin' lying ass
You always fuckin' lying
What happened?
I was trying to be your ride or die ass bitch

[Verse 1: Trill Sammy]
Shawty live life lavish (Live lavish)
She ain't fuckin' with no average (She ain't fuckin' with no no)
I'm in love with the top, I done ran through the guap
When I walk in, bag it (Bag it)
Top disappear just like magic
On the go, gotta have it
Fuck your hoe like a savage (Yeah)
Fuck your hoe like a savage

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
All this ice, all these carats (Ooh)
That's your hoe, why she worryin'? (That's your hoe, why she worryin'?)
Look down at my phone, it's 3am, and all these missed calls came from you, you-ooh
I been up 3 days, there's somethin' bout this cash that make me fall through-ooh
Look down at my phone, it's 3am, and all these missed calls came from you, you-ooh
I been up 3 days, there's somethin' bout this cash that make me- (Brr)

[Verse 2: Trill Sammy]
Now I gotta have it (Have it)
Fuck the cash, turn to a savage (Savage)
New Louis Vuitton, baby, check out the fashion
Fuck, I might take the bands straight to the casket (Ooh ooh)
Pull up and send me the addy (Skrt skrt)
Throw up this cash, watch it fall to the floor
Sit down in the 8 try the candy
Pour up a cup, rest in peace to Big Moe
Gotta watch my back, I'm not just anybody (Anybody)
No-no-no I'm average
Fuck your hoe like a savage

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
All this ice, all these carats (Ooh)
That's your hoe, why she worryin'? (That's your hoe, why she worryin'?)
Look down at my phone, it's 3am, and all these missed calls came from you, you-ooh
I been up 3 days, there's somethin' bout this cash that make me fall through-ooh
Look down at my phone, it's 3am, and all these missed calls came from you, you-ooh
I been up 3 days, there's somethin' bout this cash that make me- (Brr)

[Verse 3: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
What it is, tell me what do you feel
When I get in your face, ain't no talkin'
Five missed calls ring, no alarm
Shawty be talkin', forever we ballin'
Hop in the bed and fuck til' the mornin'
Give you some head, you running and moaning
Whole lotta' money, you want it, I'm on it
Triple X, just murdered right at the corner
I tend for to throw you so much that you can't handle
Or count at the bottom at random
Police gave me a case you might handle
I'ma look like a daughter, I stand up
Headed to where you be at
I'ma fall and jump in, and not yet
I approach and I get in your head
Bringing up shit that somebody done said

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
All this ice, all these carats (Ooh)
That's your hoe, why she worryin'? (That's your hoe, why she worryin'?)
Look down at my phone, it's 3am, and all these missed calls came from you, you-ooh
I been up 3 days, there's somethin' bout this cash that make me fall through-ooh
Look down at my phone, it's 3am, and all these missed calls came from you, you-ooh
I been up 3 days, there's somethin' bout this cash that make me- (Brr)
