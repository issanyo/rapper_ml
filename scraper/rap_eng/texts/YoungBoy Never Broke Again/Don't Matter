[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Caught in them schemes (Yeah yeah)
Dubba-AA flex
I don't believe, in what you believe (Yeah yeah, ugh)
That I gotta leave (Yeah, ugh, I gotta go)
This is the sound

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Gotta watch who around you
Better not get yourself caught in them schemes
We ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe
I can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave
Can't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave
Gotta watch who around you
Better not get yourself caught in them schemes
We ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe
I can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave
Can't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Thought we was forever, no I wasn't ready for you to just leave
This shit ain't forever, I know someday it's all gon' leave
I'm in love wit' the drank, back to back, I'm steady sippin' that lean
These niggas hate me but I'm up in the streets and I stay wit' that heat
Don't mess wit' nobody but you running over me
I swear to god I ain't havin' it
Steady spendin' that money, we run it back up
We get it and flip it and stack the shit
My godmother white, I live the same, my lil' cousin AJ is african
So don't come at me wit' that racist shit
Commentin' under my Insta pic
Ralph Lauren everything, I'm so fresh and clean
Asics on my feet, around my waist a V
Fuck wit' DGK but rather rock Supreme
True Religion beanie, True Religion jeans

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Gotta watch who around you
Better not get yourself caught in them schemes
We ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe
I can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave
Can't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave
Gotta watch who around you
Better not get yourself caught in them schemes
We ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe
I can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave
Can't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave

[Verse 2: Dubba-AA]
Growing up in my city I had to hustle
See momma ain't have it, I had to get it off the muscle (Off the muscle)
Kill or be killed niggas killed or be real
Niggas plot on your spot, tryna make it to the top
See I done heard plenty niggas waiting on my downfall
Chel passed me the rock, told me that it's time to ball
Flexing and finessing, I'm flexing never stressing
Stay prayed up, that's why God keep on blessing (The killer)
Me and my family, the lessons that he taught to me
Get the money first, hoes second, that's the strategy
Dubba-AA you know I doubled up on my profit
I'm never broke again shoutout to YoungBoy he my partner, aye

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Gotta watch who around you
Better not get yourself caught in them schemes
We ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe
I can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave
Can't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave
Gotta watch who around you
Better not get yourself caught in them schemes
We ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe
I can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave
Can't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave

[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm uppin' so you need to stay the fuck up out my business
When I go through it, it ain't your problem so to you I would not mention
Stacking paper and I pray that I don't never stop gettin' it
You was in it but you flopped, I won't flop now that I'm in it
Ridin' round in a Rolls Royce, I'm always [?] baby
Celebratin', Ace Of Spade got me feelin' brazy
Rollie watch up on my arm, look I'm proud I made it
I just gave my mom the racks, I'm still thanking Jesus
I'm just signed to Atlantic and I can't believe it
Won't chase you, you can't see you're worth
Then baby I don't need you
Niggas just can't play they role, rippin' off they people
Nigga you can play that role and get hit with this heater
Since I was young it's been my dream
But this shit ain't what it seem
It get grimy for that money, everybody tryna scheme
We hit bottom know we running, we gon' stick him out his green
They conniving and profiling, stay concealed by any means

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Gotta watch who around you
Better not get yourself caught in them schemes
We ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe
I can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave
Can't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave
Gotta watch who around you
Better not get yourself caught in them schemes
We ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe
I can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave
Can't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave
