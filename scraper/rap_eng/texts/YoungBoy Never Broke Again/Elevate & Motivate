[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Yeah
Big 14, know what the fuck goin' on
Yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
And we poured up, fours up
Trust me, lil' nigga, you won't get no love
Trust me, lil' nigga, you won't get no love, yeah, ooh

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Got a chopper, let it bang, it'll blow your fucking brain
You know we fly like some planes
All we do is elevate (Elevate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling, elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd & NBA YoungBoy]
Paper trail, been applied, but ain't coming direct
Negativity hit so hard that shit'll blow out your chest
Criticism done left me scarred, but live my life at my best
And I never would tell a lie, pride it inside of my quest
And I'ma keep doing this shit until the day of my death
Loyalty over royalty, I'ma die for respect
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve, I wear that shit in my chest
In this game, I'm big dog, you could say I'm a vet, yeah
Known to keep these niggas in check
Tryna play your cards right, but you ain't got a good deck, yeah
I need you niggas to come correct
I miss a lot of the homies, they still callin' collect

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
And we poured up, fours up
Trust me, lil' nigga, you won't get no love
Trust me, lil' nigga, you won't get no love, yeah, ooh

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Got a chopper, let it bang, it'll blow your fucking brain
You know we fly like some planes
All we do is elevate (Elevate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling, elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), yeah

[Verse 2: Nel-Denarro]
Uh, pre-meditatin' on elevation, we dedicated
Set the GPS to a higher plane, that's the destination
Celebratin', we barely beat the investigation
17 off in the 7-Up with a celly pacin'
No luck when them pours up niggas froze up
When that paperwork come back home, we gon' expose bruh
Then we ain't gon' give him no love like a fake dope plug
It ain't ever sweet on 800, we always on one
Road run, I'ma quadruple up when that load comes
60 thousand dollars off 20 packs, took a whole month
Drop the bigger bag on the lil' bro, put him on, huh
Knocked his head off for the homie, he know he owe you one

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
And we poured up, fours up
Trust me, lil' nigga, you won't get no love
Trust me, lil' nigga, you won't get no love, yeah, ooh

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Got a chopper, let it bang, it'll blow your fucking brain
You know we fly like some planes
All we do is elevate (Elevate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), to the ceiling, elevate (Motivate)
To the ceiling, elevate (Motivate), yeah
