[Intro]
Yeah
Swiff D
I like this
Go

[Chorus]
My nigga tellin' me to praise to Allah
With some cold-blooded killers standin' right in front the yard
Everybody got a pistol, neither one got a heart
Sellin' drugs, havin' fights, it was hard in the north
But I say "All well, all praise to my god"
Left a stain in the street when we spittin' out the car
Red bandana tied 'round the rod
Hope my girl could forgive me livin' life like a star

[Verse 1]
All red bottoms lookin' like I walked on the scene
Homicide diamonds with the pistol
Young nigga came up still runnin' from the system
Caught his homeboys stealin' out the pack so he clipped 'em
Feelin' down, need somebody for to lift him
He been fightin' with his girl 'cause he say that they don't feel him (What the fuck?)
Momma say that he got drugs in his system (in his system)
New image, old me, said they missed himv(said they missed him)
How the fuck I'm supposed to act when my father in prison
Tell another nigga listen, back then I ain't listen
Real Blood with some young niggas 'round me Crippin'
With some old heads out of jail leave a nigga missin'
Lot of money but they still don't understand how I'm livin'
From the streets to the can, either way I'm livin'
Boomer rip a nigga up (brap, brap, brap) one second in a minute
Tell a nigga hit me up if he really got tension

[Chorus]
My nigga tellin' me to praise to Allah
With some cold blooded killers standin' right in front the yard
Everybody got a pistol, neither one got a heart
Sellin' drugs, havin' fights, it was hard in the north
But I say "All well, all praise to my god"
Left a stain in the street when we spittin' out the car
Red bandana tied 'round the rod
Hope my girl could forgive me livin' life like a star

[Verse 2]
What I say? Press the button in the door, open up
Let my nigga out the whip, ain't no shootin' out the Wraith
Got the back and the front sewed up
Tell him spin around the block right before you catch a play
Came home started selling that yay
Got some dog food on me with some Ac' in the case
Got a K right in my home if you run in my place
Put a bullet in his dome, watch it exit his face
On my knees prayin' to God tellin' him I'm goin' home if I don't live up to goin' hard
One night I ain't go home, girl actin' crazy 'cause she mad that I'm livin' like a star
Bitch I'm straight up out them trenches, I ain't never had a heart
And I’m plugged in the socket, I ain’t never had a cord
And you want them fancy things so you better play your part
Told that bitch you don't work then I swear you gon' starve

[Chorus]
My nigga tellin' me to praise to Allah
With some cold blooded killers standin' right in front the yard
Everybody got a pistol, neither one got a heart
Sellin' drugs, havin' fights, it was hard in the north
But I say "All well, all praise to my god"
Left a stain in the street when we spittin' out the car
Red bandana tied 'round the rod
Hope my girl could forgive me livin' life like a star (Like a star, ayy)
