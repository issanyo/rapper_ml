And then my niggas off em
That draco start to talking
Them bullets start to walking
Bitch my bullets got legs , and they running to ya head
(Say What) I'm paranoid , I got the draco in the bed
Told my bitch sleep on the sofa
Put his ass on a poster , Evil nigga like the joker
Ima smash him like a soda
I got them choppers in the rover , Ima lean his ass over
Niggas getting fucked over , yea
Put his brains in his lap , bitch I'm Rambo with the strap
Like Don Corleone , one call and he gone
Them bullets flying like a drone
Kill him , put em in a song
9th ward doing niggas wrong, that 30 clip like a footlong
Its Slaughter Gang and NBA, we call Eric to beat the case
He in the stars like a wraith, you'll never catch him without the dra
He like his chain, bitch he fake
Give em two shots to the face
That thang spray like pepper spray
Free Youngboy he on the way !

[Chorus: NBA Youngboy]
You say its up
Well bitch you better lay low
I'm with some young's who gone move when I say so
Its summer time bitch we outchea with them draco's
Ain't no surrender bitch I'm stepping in my rain coat
I ain't no hoe, you know I don't stand down
Bitch when we catch you , we gone stretch you
Yea thats man down
I ain't no hoe, you know I don't stand down
Bitch when we catch you , we gone stretch you
Yea thats man down
