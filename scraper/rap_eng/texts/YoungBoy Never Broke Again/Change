[Intro]
Bitch ass boy
( young hydro on the track )
Aye, Youngboy

[Bridge]
I jus thought that I should let you know
Right before it's time for me to go
You can talk down all you want
I don't give a fuck I'm still up
You know what the fuck it's sittin' for
I won't stop til' you put me up
You can talk down all you want
I don't give a fuck I'm still up
You know what the fuck it's hittin' for
I won't stop til' you put me up

[Verse 1]
You know how to hustle, neva' been a gangsta'
You know that I'm bout' it, you know I'll spank em'
Keep it real wit' me, ain't no time for fakin'
Speak yo mind nigga, tell me what you thinkin'
I'm above water I can't let 'em sank me
Niggas started hatin', fill em' up with danger
Ion' leave tha house if I ain’t got a banga'
Ion' leave tha house if I ain’t got a banga'
Hol' em' build hoe, Uncle tol' me
Shoutout Bree, she the one that showed me
All alone goin' for the [homie?]
Had to take a stand by my lonely
Kill fore' I eva' be the victim
Eva' be the man behind the pistol
I jus fell off wit' my own nigga
Change on me, yeah that I figure
I ain't trippin, focused on the figures
Grindin' hard everyday, gettin; it
I neva' get up in yo business
Everytime you speak Imma' listen
Fuck a nigga, I won't show no pity
Thuggin' hard, me and lil' mistress
Lord bless em' cause' they both scarred
He won't speak em', fuckin' my sista'

[Bridge]
I move along as the water flow
Me and round thuggin' in the yo
I just thought I should let you know
Right before it's time for me to go
I knew you would change
I knew you would change

[Verse 2]
Boy you know how fuck I'm comin'
Really out my mind, feel like fuck it
I can't let em' slide, gotta touch em'
Drawn out with that iron out up in public
Pressure hit, I ain't neva' ran
Coolin' while I'm on the phone wit' dump
Thanks Star for givin' me a son
Montana say he comin', neva' come
On house arrest, thuggin' at the house
Why you niggas floatin' 'round the city?
Death the only thing that's not my vision
It's at the corner I forgot to mention
Youngboy, not TBG
NBA, it's a way of livin'
Let a nigga play, he gon' get it
Talked about it like I ain't wit' it
Name a nigga shook me, you know I ain't pussy
You can save yo breath, no advice tookin'
Shit what it is, bitch I see you lookin'
Shootin' on sight, no I ain't hookin'
In the bottom fuckin' wit [?]
When they come all you do is whistle
Parish prison after central bookin'
They really thought Funny Mike was pussy
They really thought Funny Mike was pussy

[Outro]
I move along as the water flow
Me and round thuggin' in the yo
I just thought I should let you know
Right before it's time for me to go
I knew you would change
