[Intro]
CashMoneyAP
I like that song
You talkin' 'bout, um
'Hello From the Other Side' right
No, you don't understand me
I just don't want you to leave me

[Chorus]
Hop in your Benz, yeah
The money be callin' again and again and again
Don't wanna do nothin' but win
Startin' to think that I'm movin' too fast again and again
Told me you love (told me you love)
Show me your love (show me your love)
Let me see that you love (see that you love)
Let me feel that you love (let me feel your love)
You show me, girl (show me)
That got love for a thug (love for a thug)
Before we stay down, we go up (up)
Ain't no limit inside of this world, yeah
I'ma run this money up with you
Tell me go in, I'm fin to
You don't do the shit that a bitch do
I'ma show you all what a brick do
Come and hop in the whip when I slide through (skrrt skrrt)
Trap house we done built us a drive through (drive through)
Got that money comin' in all different ways
Feelin' like I'm from Morocco

[Verse 1]
They can't see up in my tension
Why you all up in my business?
I can show you how to get it
Just show me your intentions
Like a verse , lotta drugs, I flip it
Just tell me where to ship it
Feelin' like Stro packs comin' through the mail
I done made a whole lot of benjis
Heard 'em say that they ain't feelin' me, nigga
Wanna beef and I'ma  go and send Lil Ben at them niggas
Bet you knowin' that I live like fuck them niggas
Don Dada, it ain't shit for to touch them niggas
Got a show for a check, gotta rush to get it
Northside in the slums, I be thuggin' lil' nigga
YoungBoy fucked up, I don't trust these niggas
Fuck them, me and you we could go and get it
Covered up in Gucci 'fore we hit the block hold on, cut on my song
When I pass through the north, let the window down
Out the door, cuttin' up, show 'em how I'm strong
Already know I wanna fuck when we pass by time and we make it home
If you already know I don't play around
You could take your clothes off and turn around

[Chorus]
Hop in your Benz, yeah (ooh)
The money be callin' again and again and again
Don't wanna do nothin' but win (ooh)
Startin' to think that I'm movin' too fast again and again
Told me you love (told me you love)
Show me your love (show me your love)
Let me see that you love (let me see that you love)
Let me feel that you love (feel your love)
You show me, girl (yeah)
That got love for a thug (got love for a thug)
Before we stay down, we go up (yeah)
Ain't no limit inside of this world, yeah
I'ma run this money up with you (I can)
Tell me go in, I'm finto (I am)
You don't do the shit that a bitch do
I'ma show you all what a brick do
Come and hop in the whip when I slide through (skrrt skrrt)
Trap house we done built us a drive through (drive through)
Got that money comin' in all different ways
Feelin' like I'm from Morocco

[Verse 2]
Slow down, yeah (slow down)
Bitch, you better not panic when it go down (when it go down)
Had to tell my mama I'm ten toes down (forever)
But you know I keep a gun every time that I road run
Bae you already knowin' how I come, I don't stand down
And you know I'ma die if them niggas play 'round
Hide from the cameras, I ain't goin' outside
In my face girl, you better not tell no lies
I'ma leave like I'm wrong even though I'm right, yeah
Money comin' fast and slow (and slow)
Pass by time, we go (we go)
Where, you never know (oh)

[Chorus]
Hop in your Benz, yeah (skrrt)
The money be callin' again and again and again
Don't wanna do nothin' but win (nothin' but win, yeah)
Startin' to think that I'm movin' too fast again and again
Told me you love (told me you love)
Show me your love (show me your love)
Let me see that you love (let me see it)
Let me feel that you love (let me feel your love)
You show me, girl (show me, girl)
That got love for a thug
Before we stay down, we go up (up)
Ain't no limit inside of this world, yeah (ah)

Tell me go in, I'm finto (I am)
You don't do the shit that a bitch do (yeah)
I'ma show you all what a brick do (a brick do)
Come and hop in the whip when I slide through (skrrt)
Trap house we done built us a drive-through (drive through)
Got that money comin' in all different ways
