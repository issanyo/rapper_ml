[Hook: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Baby, don't worry if I
Come home late like 3 or 4
When that check call, I gotta go
Baby, I'm sorry
That check, it keep callin'!
That check call like brrr
That check call
My phone boom
My phone boom like brrr
My phone doin' numbers on 'em
Numbers on 'em like brrr
Baby, I'm sorry
That check, it be callin'!

[Verse 1: Plies]
I don't need no calculator, I'm too advanced (I'm too advanced)
Somebody call up Future, I need some Percocet (I need some Percocet!)
Today my ten-year anniversary of my first hundred grand (Woo!)
Told my teacher in elementary I'm gon' be the man (I told ya!)
Told my bitch that she could leave me if she don't understand (Woo!)
They say more money bring problems; give me the problems, then (Give me the problems!)
If you hatin' 'cause you ain't eatin', then I'm not a fan (I'm not a fan)
If the lick bigger than $50,000, I'm all in (I'm all in!)
Eyes open like I just snorted an 8-ball! (Woo!)
Chase the money like they just called for the "last call!" (Woo!)
Don't say you rich if you ballin', but your dawgs starving (Woo)
Don't say you hustlin' if you laid up and the money callin'! (I swear!)

[Verse 2: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
That check call, I get up; gotta make it!
Five in the mornin' I be chasin'
When it come to money, I be racin', I'm impatient
Like brrr
Baby, it's a play, can't miss it, gotta take it!
I be at it by the minute, it be coming by the daily
I ain't got it, I go crazy!
I got habits and three babies
We got lean by the cases, it take care of the tribulations
Family problems, gotta face it
I go hard, can't let it break me (I won't let it break me)
Living wild, I pay dues
In that Lamb on cruise, hit the gas and it go zoom!
Play up on my cell, every day my phone boom!
Ain't got no time for my girl
I'll make it up; I'm on the move!

[Verse 3: Plies]
I'm all All About the Benjamins, like Cube said
And I ain't arguing with you niggas, I'm putting it on your head
I'm on my Bone Crusher shit, I Ain't Neva Scared
You keep the accolades and the fame, I just want the bread!
Want every day I wake up to feel like tax season
I ain't never been a flagger, bitch, I'm really eatin'
I told my mom she straight forever, bitch, I swear to God
I'm ten toes down and I ain't movin', bitch, like Rosa Parks!
And for that money, I swear to God, bitch, I'm a bloodhound
And if it's out there, I'm going to get it, bitch, I'mma run it down
I want a billion and some change, fuck a hundred mil
And if that check go to call, then babe, I'm outta here!

[Hook: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Baby, don't worry if I
Come home late like 3 or 4
When that check call, I gotta go
Baby, I'm sorry
That check, it keep callin'!
