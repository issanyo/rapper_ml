[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like I don't need this, don't need this no more
Sometimes I guess I just get tired
This shit ain't workin out for me
Can stop cause they ain't reaching out to me

Pour up the syrup and just drank with me
Roll up the purp and let's get high
I keep spittin' and we gon' make it ou
But until then life goes on and we stay fly

Pour up the syrup and just drank with me
Roll up the purp and let's get high
I keep spittin' and we gon' make it out
But until then life goes on and we stay fly

[Verse 1]
No, don't nobody understand me, I ain't really have much
So I don't really need nobody, I'ma run my bands up
Got some niggas ain't change up, rest of them they switched up
Shit I won't change, stay the same til' I get killed
Everybody want fame, Niggas be rapping don't know who they is
Bitches be tripping on Instagram flexing, knowing they broke that ain't really who they is
NBA gang for me they gon' kill
Everyday I'm working, make my way up that hill
Get my brother out the hood, won't stop until I touch a mil'
Ima check one and work two behind lil Dave, nigga feel my pain
Just want the world to know my name
Get on my knees and pray and ask for better days
Don't need no friends, they too petty they play games
And then at times I get lonely and try dating
But my partner always faking love, I ain't on the same page
And I know that I'ma make it, I can't let it drive me crazy
And I know my time gon' come, I just got to have patience

[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like I don't need this, don't need this no more
Sometimes I guess I just get tired
This shit ain't workin out for me
Can stop cause they ain't reaching out to me

Pour up the syrup and just drank with me
Roll up the purp and let's get high
I keep spittin' and we gon' make it ou
But until then life goes on and we stay fly

Pour up the syrup and just drank with me
Roll up the purp and let's get high
I keep spittin' and we gon' make it out
But until then life goes on and we stay fly

[Verse 2]
Claim they real but sit and hope that you don't make it
But I keep going, cause what don't break me it gon' make me
Nobody I can trust, I been thinking too much lately
And it ain't no turning back, I'm in too deep I gotta face it
It ain't working, so I guess I'm gon' move on
And I can't wait until the day that I get on
I pour a fours for all my niggas gone
I roll up purp for all my niggas coming home
And I swear I'ma be this way until I'm gone
I did some things that got some people want me gone
But I ain't scared I cleared my head and write a song
Long as I got faith I'll never be alone
