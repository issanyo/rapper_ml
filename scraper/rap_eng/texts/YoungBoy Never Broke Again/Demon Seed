[Intro]
PlayBoy on this bitch but he ain't playin' though
Yeah, oh yeah, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Yeah, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt yeah

[Chorus]
Shots from the drac' left a nigga dead
Where he was talking 'bout me
Tell that pussy nigga pick his casket 'cause YoungBoy about it
Won't make a diss, I won't say shit, go talk to God about it
Let me tell a story bout a youngin' with a dirty forty
He connivin', he gon' make his money from them bodies
Momma's cryin, he the fuckin' reason that they dyin'
He so slimey, wipe a nigga nose, that's that slime shit
Shawty slidin', got 'em thinking different, that's that mind switch

[Verse 1]
Punch on a nigga for Lil' Ben, his muscles full of them risers
Dump died with a FN, his gun was still in his pocket
Live by lord, the way it end blood gon' draw from the heart
Transformation, look how I switch it, I was wrong from the start
You never said you let two niggas run a train
You never said that you was known for givin' brain
Bitch you done brought me so much pain (bitch)
When it's time, how the fuck I'm gon' explain?
To the ones that I put last 'cause I was tryna be a man
I'm just sayin'
Your heart been abducted 'cause it's been stolen
The only way to find it is the carats from the Rollie (I'm chosen)
Your heart been abducted
Deceived emotions
Choices already chosen
Promise already broken

[Chorus]
Shots from the drac' left a nigga dead
Where he was talking 'bout me (boom, boom, boom)
Tell that pussy nigga pick his casket 'cause YoungBoy about it (I'ma stretch you)
Won't make a diss, I won't say shit, go talk to God about it
Let me tell a story bout a youngin' with a dirty forty
He connivin', he gon' make his money from them bodies
Momma's cryin, he the fuckin' reason that they dyin'
He so slimey, wipe a nigga nose, that's that slime shit
Shawty slidin', got 'em thinking different, that's that mind switch

[Refrain]
He throw gangs signs, pants off his ass
He say he bang now, them people told 'em fuck 'em
He came up and now they shame now
People say that nigga changed, huh?
He look the same, huh?
On folk, he 4KTrey's, you’d be amazed, huh?

[Verse 2]
Bandana on that 30 now, that stick'll knock 30 down
That nigga talk is down, that bitch ain't never came around
Blast when that gutter 'round, he knocked 2 victims down
Trap got a eviction now, which one of you niggas snitchin' now?

[Refrain]
He throw gangs signs, pants off his ass
He say he bang now, them people told 'em fuck 'em
He came up and now they shamed now
People say that nigga changed, huh?
He look the same, huh?
On folk, he 4KTrey's now, you’d be amazed, huh?

[Outro]
He connivin', he gon' make his money from them bodies
Momma's cryin, he the fuckin' reason that they dyin'
He so slimey, wipe a nigga nose, that's that slime shit
Shawty slidin', got 'em thinking different, that's that mind switch
