[Intro]
To all the ones I love, I'm sorry
Had to turn this way for me to go harder, yea

[Chorus]
I'm faded, thinking to myself
Man this shit really crazy
Now I'm finally blowin' up, got me feelin' like I made it
I been going through so much, but I can't let this shit here phase me

[Verse]
I'm from the north, I'm just sixteen, I'm born in '99
Ever since I was fifteen I've been slangin' iron
Sat in juvenile, stayed down now nigga it's my time
Instead of salutin', them niggas hatin', won't let them stop my shine
I've been goin' hard trying to make it
You just don't know how many times I've been betrayed
If you want me, why you steady giving people your attention
You can move around, I ain't got no time for that fake shit
I'm from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, this my city
It's a whole lot of shootings and a whole lot of killing
Extra clip just for my taurus, extra clip just for my glizzy
This shit get wicked, gotta stay up on my pivot
Young nigga 'bout steppin', I'm taking over
No more up on that block, havin' to watch over my shoulder
I remember when I was young, things different now I'm older
City to city, I'm on the road, I'm doing shows, Q Red told me
I swear that they don't know how long I've been thuggin'
On my momma, gotta get it, can't settle for nun'
Gotta stay focused, gotta stay up on my hustle
Got a son for to raise, got a family countin' on me, yea
Stay from round me if you ain't with me foreal'
When I told you I love you, I really meant that foreal'
But no I ain't trippin' I'm focused on my career
Other than that, they don't know how I feel
I've been strivin' for so long and I still feel they don't hear me
I know that I'ma be on top, in a lil' minute
Shorty keep on callin' steady, tryna' tell me that she different
I've been hurt before, shit I had to tell her I ain't with it

[Chorus]
I'm faded, thinking to myself
Man this shit really crazy
Now I'm finally blowin' up, got me feelin' like I made it
I been going through so much, but I can't let this shit here phase me

[Outro]
I've been goin' hard trying to make it
You just don't know how many times I've been betrayed
If you on me, why you steady giving people your attention
You can move around, I ain't got no time for that fake shit
