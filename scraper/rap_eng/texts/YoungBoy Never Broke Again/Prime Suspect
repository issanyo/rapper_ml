[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Yeah yeah
I'm the chosen one
I'm a champion
Woah, yeah, oh

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Through all this heartbreak and this pain I can't change
Through the betrayal and the rain I stay the same
I promise you that I'ma leave how I came
Gotta stop playin', now it's time to be a man
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one, yeah
The chosen one, yeah
I'm a champion
I'm the chosen one, yeah
I'm a champion

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Late at night no I can't sleep, I'm like oh
I got demons in my dreams, man I know
I just drop down to my knees, to the floor
I start praying to my god to make 'em go
I was young when grandmama died nigga
Take a look up in my eyes nigga
I'll never be disguised nigga
Say you know me, tell me how do you figure?
Working hard, now my name getting bigger
Comin' up I grew up 'round killers
Swear that I'm traumatized nigga
My hopes to the ceiling
Hurt and I need some healing
Gotta do better for my children
I can't give up on my mission

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Through all this heartbreak and this pain I can't change
Through the betrayal and the rain I stay the same
I promise you that I'ma leave how I came
Gotta stop playin', now it's time to be a man
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't a thing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one, yeah
The chosen one, yeah
I'm a champion
I'm the chosen one, yeah
I'm a champion

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
I stand on all ten, I won't bend for nothin'
I keep it super real, I can't pretend for nothin'
I'm a product of my environment, you can say that
So miss with that fuck shit, I don't play that
I talk to god a lot at night, know I ain't living right
I got issues within myself so I keep my circle tight
We don't bark, we bite
Throw bullets, we don't fight
You want smoke then we pipe
Shit get you murked tonight
Seen a lot of deaths coming, that's why I'm numb to stuff
That's why I don't cry at funerals, that's why I don't talk as much
I know I'm chosen, ELO told me just remain focused
I told my gangster about that bread don't let 'em catch you loafing

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
It ain't nothing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't nothing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one
It ain't nothing I can't handle, I'm a champion
It ain't nothing I can't handle, I'm the chosen one, yeah
The chosen one
I'm a champion
I'm the chosen one yeah
I'm a champion
