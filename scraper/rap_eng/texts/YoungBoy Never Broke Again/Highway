[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
On the highway, yeah
On the highway
Keep that, yeah

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
All the shit that they talk, I don't care about
I just give a fuck where to go when the pack out
Before I came up, used to post at the traphouse
Fuckin' on lil shawty, bend her over, blow her back out
Thinkin' I done drunk too much lean, I done tapped out
Shootin' up the club in the whip, I done smashed out
I relapsed on them pills, taking tramadol
Fuck Atlantic, want my money, I ain't callin' y'all

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Nigga play on my son, kill all y'all
Cell ringing, that's just Ben on the phone call
Lot of money and I still wear the same drawers
And I'm still cuttin' up like a chained dog
Need a Lamb' or a Wraith when I touch down
Still ridin' 'round in that Benz with a four pound
Still totin' guns every day that I float 'round
Shoot a nigga dead in his face when it go down, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Uh, on the highway
And I'm still gettin' it in, countin' money, on the highway
On the plane with my son, drinkin' lean, I ain't been asleep in nine days
If a nigga lookin' for me, tell that boy that he know where to find me

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
All the shit that they talk, I don't care about
I just give a fuck where to go when the pack out
Before I came up, used to post at the traphouse
Fuckin' on lil shawty, bend her over, blow her back out
Thinkin' I done drunk too much lean, I done tapped out
Shootin' up the club in the whip, I done smashed out
I relapsed on them pills, taking tramadol
Fuck Atlantic, want my money, I ain't callin' y'all

[Verse 2: Terintino]
Pourin' this drank, I been up for nine days
Fuck with the lil bitch, I can never throw shade
Ridin' in a Maybach, but I don't ever use the shade
Thought you caught me lackin', but I'm with the whole gang
On the NBA shit, linked up with the Glo Gang
That lil bitch basic, told her I just want some brain
Now she tweakin', it's just you off cocaine
Hellcat, Chargers, press the button, did the race

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
All the shit that they talk, I don't care about
I just give a fuck where to go when the pack out
Before I came up, used to post at the traphouse
Fuckin' on lil shawty, bend her over, blow her back out
Thinkin' I done drunk too much lean, I done tapped out
Shootin' up the club in the whip, I done smashed out
I relapsed on them pills, taking tramadol
Fuck Atlantic, want my money, I ain't callin' y'all
