[Intro]
Aye, aye, aye, ain't that politickin’
Rose are red, violets are blue and you try
I'd never leave you yeah-ee
On and on and on and on
That's that shit i won’t let on
(Fuck wit my head)
My momma don't tell me she love me
How the fuck I expect someone else to?
It's a (leave me) [?] gon' talk like I don't know it all, yeah
They say pain makes the world go 'round

[Verse 1]
Tell me somethin' that I don't know
Like you if your soul want me dead
Ignore the signs in my face, I pray that God never let
And everybody that’s around they watch me run up my check
And let me blow it at the same time they help me with debt
She like, money coming I can find another
I know that’s what your brain thought
As I sat in prison say fuck my niggas, noticed I can't blame ya’ll
I blanked him, I blank y'all, you speak on me I shame y'all
My flaw, I spoke on everything, now what you think?
Speak on your thoughts
We was rollin' deep, everything let your people see
Plannin’ on exposin' me, let the dead see
I already done kept it G, bet that boy can't fuck wit' me
Say what I want, pull a rod from out the sea
Erryone of them stuck with me, I ain't got no momma
Say the devil holdin' me, go up you ain't down wit' me

[Refrain]
Talkin' superstitious, that won't make me better
And if it's competition tell me what I'm here for
We all was born by ourselves, can't die together
I never make you feel how I felt
This world gon' live by itself
Hol' on

[Chorus]
You only let me love you if you stay
It go on and on and on and on and on, yeah
Steady lettin' me fuck you, what can't you say?
It go on and on and on and on, I'm gone
'Fore y'all separate, y'all can talk it out
What she need for to leave? You should give it all
If she feel that nigga better then he better than that nigga raw
If you came up once you could never fall
If you love her, don't let her walk
If she push you away, open the gate, you gotta let her out

[Verse 2]
God made us outta dirt
She gave him fruit, he ain't deceive his self
And if you read the Bible you should know that love would never help
Holdin' in all of the shit that I felt
If you ain't here with me, then I don't need myself
I ain't know I was this powerful
I saw it when my grandma left, yeah (turn up Kentrell)
Upgrade my doses with them meds
Dirty bitch I was unfresh
Without help, I came out blessed
Pulled my heart from out my chest
Cat and mouse that book I read
Cross me in the wrong way
Blow yo shit out on the deck

[Chorus]
It go on and on and on and on and on
And if you stay then you won't even let me love you, bae
It go on and on and on and on and on
Steady lettin' me fuck you, what is it you can't say?
'Fore y'all separate, y'all can talk it out
What she need for to leave? You should give it all
If she feel that nigga better then he better than that nigga raw
If you came up once you could never fall
If you love her, don't let her walk
If she push you away, open the gate, you gotta let her out

[Outro]
Touchdown nigga, yeah, aye
It be them same lil' niggas that payed for a feature, you heard me
Aye I don't speak on nothin' you know that I'm all the way out there bitch
I been dumb, retarded, you heard me
38 baby, believe that
