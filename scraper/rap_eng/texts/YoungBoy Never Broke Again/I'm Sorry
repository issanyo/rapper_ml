[Verse]
Woke up this morning, I was thinking bout Aria
I had to get on my knees
They just don't know that I'm sorry (Sorry)
Know Momo listening every time Papa talk to me
He say I need to slow down fore' I get put in a coffin (Put in a coffin)
My cousin Bree, she keep it real and be ready
She say that she gone pray for me
But I just know that she scared for me, ayy
I gotta listen 'cause they just tryna help me
With all my heart swear I love em' because I know that they care for me (Know that they care for me)
We stuck together nigga that's how we came up
Before Youngboy and Beenie ain't nobody wanna fuck with us
Delecia told me she proud that I'm coming up
I couldn't do nothin' but smile 'bout the fact it was comin' from her
Thinking 'bout Star, I can't get caught up loving her
Even tho' that I'm fuckin' her, gotta watch how I fuck with her
No, I can't put my trust in her, I can't trust nobody
Nobody I can depend but myself 'cause I got me
Call Lil Ben, know he got me
Right or wrong behind my gang, I'ma still catch a body
Quick to speak up on some shit and they don't know nothin' about it
I'm just tryna live life, do a show, rock the party
Pressed about how I started (How I started)
We wasn't meant to be it is what it is and it hurt me so bad
I swear I wonâ€™t shed a tear
Nigga play with my cousin, I bet he won't play again
People faker than a bitch that's why I cut off my friends (Talk to 'em Bean)

[Outro]
I said I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
I say I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
I say I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
