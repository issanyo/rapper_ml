[Intro]
Myself, myself
Oh well, no way, yeah
Why?
Why?
Why'd it have to be me?
Yeah

[Chorus]
And I fuckin' hate myself (Myself)
And all of these choices I have to make (Yeah)
And I don't want no one else (No one else)
But I have to be all alone for the change
And I don't want to hurt myself (Myself)
But I have to make up my wrong for the change (Yeah)
I swear I don't want no one else (No one else)
But I have to change for the heal of my pain

[Verse]
And I don't want cut off nobody (Nobody)
But I'm startin' to see that they all are the same (Are the same)
And I don't see myself with nobody (Nobody)
'Cause you the only one that can heal my pain
Some say I'm crazy 'cause I don't want to live
They say I wanna go to jail 'cause I won't do what they say
No, I won't never take her name off my face
I'm so deep up in your love, that my mind's in a Wreck
They gone clown me, try to down me
And they probably tryna send me back to where they found me
I don't want to pay for love, I don't want 'em 'round me
Hurt me once, your damage done, now they tryna drown me
Will they still be around me if I didn't have no money?
Would you look at me the same if I was regular and bummy?
Tried to share what I accomplished, you ain’t never give me nothin'
I just hope you stay the same if I wasn’t around for something
And I, yeah

[Chorus]
And I fuckin' hate myself (Myself)
And all of these choices I have to make (Have to make)
And I don't want no one else (No one else)
But I have to be all alone for the change (For the Change)
And I don't want to hurt myself (Myself)
But I have to make up my wrong for the change
I swear I don't want no one else (No one else)
But I have to change for the heal of my pain, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm insane now, I'm insane now, I'm insane now, yeah, yeah
I'm insane now, I'm insane now, I'm insane now, yeah

[Chorus]
And I fuckin' hate myself (Myself)
And all of these choices I have to make
And I don't want no one else (No one else)
But I have to be all alone for the change
And I fuckin' hate myself (Myself)
And all of these choices I have to make
And I don't want no one else (No one else)
But I have to be all alone for the change
