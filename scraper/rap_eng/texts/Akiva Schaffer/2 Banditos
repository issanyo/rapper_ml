[Intro]
Ooh, 2 banditos

[Verse 1]
Well howdy ma'am, we the 2 banditos
Up in the club wearing bright pink tuxedos
Similar to our torpedoes, 'cept mine's brown
Gonna turn that frown into more of a frown
Hunter's kickin' it with Conner4Real, what's the deal?
I'm on some white boy shit man, tryna stack a mil
Yeah I'm also on my white boy shit, that's my birth right
Call my dick the shooting star (why?) cause it burns bright
I fucked your first cousin with the didgeridoo
And when she came, you know it sounded like "wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow"

[Chorus]
Yeah, you know we're 2 banditos
Yeah, you know we're 2 banditos
Yeah, you know we're 2 banditos
Do a little dance and drink a little water

[Post-Chorus]
Man, how'd I get the money? (Don't worry 'bout it)
Now they pissing on my couch (Don't worry 'bout it)
How they get so cool? (Don't worry 'bout it)
You've been struck by the 2 banditos
What the fuck is that? (Don't worry 'bout it)
Does this make me look fat? (Don't worry 'bout it)
I just ate a fucking rat (Don't worry 'bout it)
You've been struck by the 2 banditos
Dumb... dumb dumb... dumb... dumb dumb... stupid!

[Verse 2]
My name is Connor and I'm not a model citizen
I'll take a swig from this bottle that I jism in
I'm swimming in her prism and my interests is dwindling
And I'm hella bored too, fuck it
Banditos eat a lot of burritos
While we're fucking bald eagles
Hey, let's go back to the chorus dude (oh, okay)

[Chorus]
Yeah, we're 2 cute little kittens
Yeah, we're 2 cute little kittens
Yeah, we're 2 cute little kittens
Shut the fuck up!
Thank you

[Post-Chorus]
We just robbed the place (Don't worry 'bout it)
They just licked my face (Don't worry 'bout it)
Took a shit in your food (Don't worry 'bout it...rude!)
You've been struck by the 2 banditos
Pop this pill (Don't worry 'bout it)
Is that cocaine? (Don't worry 'bout it)
What is life? (Don't worry 'bout it)
You've been struck by the 2 banditos
Wow wow wow wow motherfucker (wow)
