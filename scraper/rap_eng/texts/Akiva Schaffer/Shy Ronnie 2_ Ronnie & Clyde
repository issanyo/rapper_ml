[Music video intro: Rihanna]
We've done the work. We know the system
We have the firepower, and we have each other
You ready?
(Andy Samberg as Shy Ronnie moans in hesitant agreement)

[Intro: Rihanna]
Yeah, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
We at it again, everybody now

[Hook: Rihanna]
Hands in the air, it's a stick up, stick up
No funny business or you get lit up, lit up
You test I (I), you gon' die (die)
And at your funeral, your mama gon' cry
So customers, press the floor, floor
And clerks, open cash drawers slow, slow
If you don't wanna end up dead
You'll do everything Shy Ronnie says
Tell 'em, Ronnie

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg & Rihanna]
Hey, it's Shy Ronnie, now you down on the floor
*Samberg murmurs as Shy Ronnie*
No one in the bank can hear you
Shy Ronnie, use your outside voice
We don't have time for this
Haha!
Let's go

[Hook: Rihanna]
So, stay on the ground it's a stick up, stick up
Your wallets and jewels we'll pick up, pick up
Unload the cash (cash), move your ass (ass)
We getting' money, tell 'em, Shy Ronnie

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg & Rihanna]
Now I'm on the scene, Shy Ronnie with the heat
*Samberg murmurs as Shy Ronnie*
Please, please use your wordsJust imagine that everyone's naked
Uh, oh, boner alert!
He really pictured them naked
Haha!

[Bridge: Rihanna & Policeman]
Why did I think you could do this?
Ronnie, hostage on the move!
(Gunshot) He shot himself
And why is your gun so small?
The police are on their way
Come out with your hands up
Good luck, Shy Ronnie
Bye-bye!

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
Haha!
Ronnie, motherfucker, and I'm back from the dead
Brain bored with the murder, so I shot my own leg
Don't get the name twisted, 'cause I'm crazy as shit
I hung a giant-ass noose off my giant-ass dick

[Break: Rihanna]
Ay! I forgot this money
And also this guy
Come on, we gonna have sex
Too-da-loo!

[Verse 4: Andy Samberg]
And you can hang from it
'Cause you don't wanna see my real gun
Shots to the sky
But your face sound real fun
Ronnie!
