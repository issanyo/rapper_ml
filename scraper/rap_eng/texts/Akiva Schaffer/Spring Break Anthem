[Intro: Akiva]
Alright, spring breakers, you know what time it is
I'm gonna need all the hot girls to come onto the stage right now
Fellas, let me hear you make some noise
Spring break, y'all

[Chorus: All]
Kings of the bar scene, pounding on brewskies
Banging chicks right there in the sand
Bros before hoes and chicks with no clothes and
Slamming shots and marry a man

[Verse 1: Jorma, Akiva, & Andy (All)]
Who wanna do a shot? (We do)
I'm gonna get fucked up (Me, too)
We came for a week, we the kings of the beach
Sprayed water on the girls (T-shirt, see-through)
(Cancun) Party down
(Lauderdale) Another round
(Havasu) Crack a brew
(Marry a man)

[Chorus: All]
Pranks when you're passed out, jokes about roofies
Making girls kiss, marry a man
Giant sombreros, show us your titties
Creatine shakes, marry a man

[Break: Jorma]
Spring break, y'all

[Verse 2: Jorma, Akiva, & Andy (All)]
(Oh shit) I'm too fucked up
(Puke and rally) That's what's up
Booze cruise (Raise your glass)
Snort that coke (Off her ass)
Two chicks at the dance hall, take it to the damn stalls
Trade these beads for their bra
So-Co in my canteen, got girls jumpin' on a trampoline
Two men bound by the law

[Chorus: All]
Trashing hotel rooms, clogging up toilets
Beer goggles if she's a hag
Planning the venue, picking out flowers
Nailing sluts and writing our vows

[Bridge: All]
Down, here it's our time! Spring breakers, let's get fucked up
Then find Mr. Right and get monogamous

[Chorus: All]
Picking our invite font as a twosome
Something tasteful, but not too bland
Seating arrangements, charming the in-laws
Ripping beer bongs, sex with a man
We'll be so happy, true love forever
Two kings walking hand in hand
Promise to cherish, trust and respect him
Crushing pussy, marry a man

[Outro: All]
Spring
Break
