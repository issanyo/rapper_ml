Nowadays, everybody's using curse words
Seems to me like it ain't necessary
Yeah, so when I get steamed
Yo - I tell 'em like this:

I don't give a honk, I don't give a honk
And if you think I do, my friend
Then you're wronk.
Your crocodile tears can go and got gonk
You think I'm a funk, but we don't give a honk

I'm a wild child and I'm on the loose
Giving less of a honk than a muzzled goose
Or a broken car horn and its honkless fate
Man if I was Senator, it'd be a honkless state

Yo, I drove past a rally saying "Honk For Peace"
So I took out my gun and shot 'em all in the knees
I don't give a honk! You picked the wrong dude
If a honk was my virginity, consider me prude

I consider it rude to have honk-spectations
Only thing I give a honk is a long vacation
On a long space station, can't hear you scream
And they sure can't hear you honk, know what I mean?

Yo we told you before: we don't give a honk
And saying that we do is just simpoly ridonk
You could try to buy us off with your pesos and francs,
But your money means nothing - you could take it to the bonk.

Man, I'm stingy when it comes to my honks (me too)
I literally stick 'em to my body with glue
Good thinkin' Abe Lincoln, you're a real smart cookie
Teach a class about giving a honk? I'm playing hooky.

Now what you gonna do with all your honks?
Gonna dive in and swim like Scrooge McDonk
Cause for a honk I'd bite a chunk out of a Buddhist monk
And at his funeral, everyone will sing this sonk

Yo we told you before: we don't give a honk
Got a theory that we do? Well your theory's debunked
Save the drama for your mama cause your -itis is bronch-.
Our policy is staunch: we don't give a honk

You know a honk in some countries is considered a food
And if you don't eat it all, it's considered quite rude
We all know we're born with 100 honks
But people throw 'em away like they were Donkey Konks
And the honks are the barrels

The kings and the pharaohs sing about honks
Like they were Christmas carols
I'll punch you in the jeans
But this ain't Lonely Island
And if I catch you steaming my honks
I'll get violent

Yo we told you before: we don't give a honk
Even if you give us candy like Willy the Wonk
But don't come for my honks, better know your place
Mother-honkers honk around and get honked in the face

This the not honking around crew
And this not honking around thing is about to go both ways
