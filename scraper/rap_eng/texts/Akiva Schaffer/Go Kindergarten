[Intro: Andy & Robyn]
Party people (party people)
We have taken control of your minds (your minds)
So get on the floor (oh, yeah)
‘Cause it’s time to kick up dirt, now let’s work (huh!)

[Chorus: Robyn]
Hey, we’re gonna dance tonight, okay?
We all shining bright
Let the music take you away, don’t ask questions
Just do everything that we say

[Verse 1: Jorma, Andy, & Kiv]
On the floor! Ladies, shake that ass
Shake that, shake that ass, work it, twerk it, drop it fast
Fellas! Whip your dick out, whip, whip your dick out
Indiana Jones and whip your fucking dick out
Now punch your friend! Punch, punch your friend
Get on the fucking floor and punch your best friend
Make your butt look flat, make that shit flat
Use the art of perspective or hide it in a hat
Go stupid, get stupid, because we said to do it
Go dumb, eat garbage, we going kindergarten

[Chorus: Robyn]
Yeah, you know, some of it might seem strange
But don’t think, just obey
Let the music play, ’cause we put it in the song
So do everything that we say

[Verse 2: Jorma, Andy, Kiv, (Robyn), All, & The Lonely Island]
Have a motherfucking baby on the floor
Raise it in the club, home-school it by the door
Now be ambidextrous – fuckin’ ambidextrous
We’ll come around and test you, it’s a biggie on our checklist
Now ladies, whip your dick out, whip, whip your dick out
Don’t ask how, just fuckin’ figure it out
Now make your booty speak, teach that ass English
Make it suck helium and talk like this
Now eat a banana, potassium for stamina
Then build a school (yeah), burn it down (yeah)
Get on the floor and do it now
Fuck a house (yeah), eat a shoe (yeah), all because we told you to!

[Bridge: Robyn, Andy, & Jorma]
So raise your glass, then break the glass
Then stomp your bare feet on the glass
Champagne corks, pop 'em off
Middle fingers up, now chop ‘em off
Then pose nude for a family friend
Never speak of it again
The party’s here, and you can’t escape
So just do everything that we say

[Outro: The Lonely Island]
Go zombie, be brainless
Here we are, entertain us
Get stupid, go moron
We going kindergarten
