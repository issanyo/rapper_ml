[Hook: Jorma Taccone]
Damn
I fucked my aunt
I can't believe I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt y'all

[Verse 1: Jorma Taccone]
I was thirteen, skinny little freckle-faced kid
Growing up in the country felt like doing a bid
But the summers were my favorite when we swam in the lake
And trips to the city, what a magical place
First baseball game, man, I'll never forget
Crackerjacks, bleacher seats and the crack of the bat
My friend Tim caught a ball, but he gave it to me
And five years later, I fucked my aunt, damn

[Hook: Akiva Schaffer]
I fucked my aunt
I can't believe that I fucked my aunt
Man, I really fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt, y'all

[Verse 2: Akiva Schaffer]
Rainstorms always give me the blues
Worst one in ten years on the evening news
She rode her bike over cause the streets was closed
My aunt standing there in soaking wet clothes
We opened some wine and laughed like kids
She told me funny things that her and my mom did
But then my uncle called and she had to go
And twelve years later, I fucked her sister, damn

[Hook: Andy Samberg]
I fucked my aunt
Can you believe that I fucked my aunt?
Man, I guess I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt, y'all

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
It was my eighteenth birthday, the world was still new
My parents threw me a party as parents will do
My uncle's wife gave me a punny gift
It was an ant farm; man, she was a trip
Later that night I was up in my room
I watched as the small ant community bloomed
So simple, yet so complex
I contemplated my own life and wondered what would come next
I took out my favorite ant and crushed it with my dick
And also, I fucked my aunt

[Hook: Andy Samberg]
Damn, I fucked my ant
And I fucked my aunt
Man, we fucked our aunts (yeah)
We fucked our aunts, y'all

[Outro: T-Pain]
Oh, I can't believe it... they fucked their aunts
I mean, I fucked my aunt, too, but you don't see me making songs about it
Although we technically didn't have sex
Just some above the clothes stuff
And some under the clothes stuff
I mean, what is sex, really? Is it just penetration?
Or do you have to finish? Cause I finished...
(Damn, I fucked my aunt, y'all)
