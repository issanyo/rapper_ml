This one goes out
From the bottom of our hearts
To the most important lady in our lives
It's time to pay some respect
I hope you proud of us
Cause we're proud of you

Mama!
You raised me right
Mama!
Showed me the light
Mama!
Through pain and strife
Mama!
You gave us life

When I fell down you were there to pick me up
When I felt bad you were there to build me up
Gave everything you had in the world to me
And you made me the man I'm supposed to be

Jane, even though I don't say it often enough
I appreciate everything you did for us
Never take you for granted cause it ain't hard to see
The best parts of you are now a part of me

Ah Mama

And when it was cold outside you kept us warm and held us down...

[Mom] Hi boys, who wants a snack?
[Andy] MOM, GET OUT WE'RE IN THE STUDIO!
[Jorma] OH MY GOD!
[Mom] Just checking on my guys!
[Jorma] GET OUT OF HERE!
[Andy] WE'RE MAKING A TRACK YOU IDIOT!
[Mom] Oooohhh!
[Andy] JUST LEAVE!
[Mom] Okie doke
[Jorma] GO! GO!
[Andy] YOU SUCK, MOM!

Yeah my one true love, my heart, my ma
Show her respect in the form of this song
So when life gets hard and it makes you cry
I'll always be there to wipe a tear from your eye

My mom's my number one fan, my best friend
And I'll never disrespect...

[Door opens]
[Jorma] MOM!
[Mom] I know you said you weren't hungry, but I made ants on a log
[Andy] GET THE FUCK OUT
[Jorma] LEAVE! LEAVE ME! GO!
[Mom] So how's your little club going?
[Andy] IT'S NOT A CLUB!
[Jorma] IT'S A RAP GROUP!
[Mom] Well I'll leave these here and eat them if you...
[Jorma] FINE!
[Andy] GO TO HELL, MOM!

She's an angel on earth with invisible wings
I put no one above in summer, winter or spring, or fall...

[Door opens]
[Mom] Have you guys seen the remote?
[Andy] OH MY GOD!
[Jorma] LEAVE US ALONE!
[Andy] FUCK YOU MOM!
[Jorma] LEAVE US ALONE!
[window smashes]
[Mom] Watch it
[Andy] I HOPE YOU FUCKING DIE!

Jump in front of a bullet if it could save my mom
You got a gun or a bullet cause she will never see harm...

[Door opens]
[Mom] Nevermind, I found it
[They all scream/shout/glass smashes]
['Dale'] Laura, everything ok?
[Andy] SHUT THE FUCK UP DALE!
[Jorma] SHUT UP!
[Mom] Hey! Be nice to Dale
[Andy] FUCK DALE!
[Jorma] FUCK DALE!
[Andy] I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE SEX WITH THAT GUY!

This goes out to all the mamas
Trying to protect their kids from drama
Love was your goal to bring
No matter what they say, you're beautifull

So push them lighters in the sky
Wave 'em back from side to side
And if you feel lost and alone
Let our voices guide you home

[Mom] Is something burning down there?
[Andy] GET THE FUCK OUT NOW!
