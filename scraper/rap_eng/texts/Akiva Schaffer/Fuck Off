[Verse 1]
Hey Yo!
This one is dedicated to all the little kids out there
Whose parents are always riding them
Telling them to 'do your homework'
Never letting you eat dessert
Making you go to bed before you're ready
Well listen
The next time they are acting bogus
I want you to try this out
Stand up on your tippy toes
Look them dead in the eye
And say "Mom, Dad, you can both...

[Chorus 1]
Fuck off, I don't want your life
I don't owe you shit
And I hate your rules
Fuck off, so get out of my room
You can suck my dick
Motherfucking shit-head bitch
You can Fuck oh-oh oh-oh
I'm gonna live forever
Oh-oh oh-oh
I hope you get butt fucked in prison"

[Verse 2]
And that's what you should say
But what about at school
How many kids out there have a teacher
That's always riding them?
Saying "don't eat paste, don't talk during nap time"
Well the next time your teacher is being a grumpasaurus
Stand tall, look them dead in the eye
And say, "Teacher, could you help me out and just...

[Chorus 2]
Fuck off, you can't teach me shit
And if I was you, I'd slit my wrist
Fuck off, cause I might be young
But I'll dig your grave, 'til the job is done
You can Fuck oh-oh oh-oh
I'm gonna live forever
Oh-oh oh-oh
I hope you get butt fucked in prison"

[Bridge]
Because we are the kids in the USA
We think for ourselves, so get the fuck out our way
And all you adults can choke on shit
We hope you suffocate on a dog's dick

[Chorus 3]
Fuck off, you think I'm a punk
Your face looks like an elephant's cunt
Fuck off, cause you're not my dad
So shut the fuck up and wipe my ass
So fuck oh-oh oh-oh
I'm gonna live forever
Oh-oh oh-oh
I hope you get butt fucked in prison

Be good to each other peace
