[Intro]
1,2,3

[Chorus]
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, Kiai
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, Kiai

We kick it
Like karate guys
Got the drinks and the ladies and the party ice
And by kick it we mean hanging out, dude
I'm not kicking something, with my foot

We're rolling with our friends
All over town
But we're all in the car
We're not rolling on the ground

Or we could be at a house
Or even outside
Of a house
Like a karate guy

[Chorus]
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, Kiai
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, Kiai

We not talking 'bout kicking a can
We talking 'bout hanging with friends
And when we say "hanging"
We don't mean using a rope
We mean chilling
But it doesn't have to be cold

It could be any temperature
60° or 80°
There just has to be friends
And drinks and ladies

And good conversation
And don't forget the party ice
That's how you kick it
Like a karate guy

I like to kick it
Kiai
Now I'm in a cowboy hat
Yee-haw
Now I'm in a cowboy hat
Yee-haw
Now I'm in 3 cowboy hats
Yee-haw

[Chorus]
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, Kiai
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
I like to kick it
Kiai, Kiai
