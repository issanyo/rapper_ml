Ohh Maximus
You are the best of us
Ohh my Maximus
Ohh I will never let you go

Do you remember
We dressed like Ninja Turtles on Halloween
Then they put you on their firing line and shot you down
Your blood stains the pages of the magazine
I miss you, my old friend
You took a little doo doo in my hand
And now all I do is cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

You were my best friend
I love you Maximus
Why’d you leave me?
I’m so alone
I’m so alone

Tell the fields of Elysium my friend
I love you
