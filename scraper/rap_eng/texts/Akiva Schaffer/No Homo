[Verse 2]
Hey yo no homo but I wanna dress up like Dorothy
And butt fuck a dude while he 69s Morrissey
No homo but I wish I lived in Ancient Greece
To gave young Socrates the illful release
Hey yo no homo but today I'm coming out the closet
Wanna scream it from the mountains like a gay prophet
These two words have set me free (no homo)
Damn it feels good to be (no homo)
