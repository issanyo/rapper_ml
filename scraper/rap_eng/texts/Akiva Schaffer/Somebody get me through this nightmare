[Three Days Grace - Animal I Have Become]
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself

[The Lonely Island - Jizz In My Pants]
Jizzed in my pants
This really never happens you can take my word
I won't apologize, that's just absurd
Mainly your fault from the way that you dance
And now I, jizz in my pants
Don't tell your friends or I'll say you're a slut
Plus it's your fault, you were rubbing my butt
I'm very sensitive, some would say that's a plus
Now I'll go home and change

I need a few things from the grocery
Do things alone now mostly
Left me heart broken not lookin' for love
Surprised in my eyes when I looked above
The checkout counter and I saw a face
My heart stood still, so did time and space
Never felt that I could feel real again
But the look in her eyes said "I need a friend"
She turned to me that's when she said it
Looked me dead in the face, asked "Cash or Credit?"

Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself

[The Lonely Island - Jizz In My Pants]
And I jizzed in my pants
It's perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me
But we're going to need a clean up on Aisle 3
And now I'm posed in an awkward stance because I jizzed in my pants
To be fair, you were flirting a lot
Plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot
Please stop acting like you're not impressed

[Three Days Grace - Animal I Have Become]
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become

[The Lonely Island - Jizz In My Pants]
I jizz right in my pants everytime you're next to me
And when we're holdin' hands, it's like having sex to me
You say I'm premature, I just call it ecstasy
I wear a rubber at all times, it's a necessity

I jizz in my pants, I jizz in my pants
Yes I jizz in my pants, yes I jizz in my pants
Yes I jizz in my pants
I jizz in my pants, I jizz in my pants

Help me, somebody help
