[Hook]
I’m a weirdo, yeah I’m a weirdo
People looking at me crazy, I don’t care though
I’m a weirdo, w-w-weirdo
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no
I say fuck no, I say fuck no
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no

[Verse 1]
I’m a weirdo not a hero
Had a psych eval didn’t clear though
Ergo I say ear-go
Cut my ear off, now I can’t hear stereo
If that makes me weird, I’m weird
I use a Mach3 razor on my beard
I use a Mach10 razor down here
Seven more blades cause I like it sheared
Use a banana as a telephone
Use a banana as a telephone
Use a banana as a telephone
Spoon in my ear cause my brain’s made of gelatone
Latin girls say “turn up the Reggaeton”
But it’s me in a wig, mind is hella gone
“Ay papi, you crazy”
Yeah I’m crazy for driving Miss Daisy
Best picture, must be doing something right
Chicken bit off my dick at a cockfight
Sewed it back on sitting at a stoplight
Bit a cop got a ticket for a cop bite
I’m demented and deranged, motherfucker
Choose the middle seat on a plane, motherfucker
Just wrong like a dog in Ray Bans
Piss off the roof, you could call me Rain Man
Best picture, must be doing something right
Shit, I’m repeating myself, man I’m not right

[Hook]
I’m a weirdo, yeah I’m a weirdo
People looking at me crazy, I don’t care though
I’m a weirdo, w-w-weirdo
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no
I say fuck no, I say fuck no
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no
