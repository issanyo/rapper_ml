[Hook: Lily Allen]
There used to be a day when you could roam the streets
All night and stay out with your friends, blud
Now you can't even walk to the shop without a little kid
Saying "what you doing in my ends, blud?"
Now, I used to be here on the street
Before this little kid was even wearing pyjamas
Now the new generation of LDN
Wanna mess about and cause dramas

[Verse 1: Jme]
Hello, hi, I'm Jme
And I'm more street than what you drive your car on
This is my Lily Allen remix
You know, she's got tracks with a bass guitar on
The reason I done this?
Cause there's kids on road that are so far gone
Walking around all day and all night
Like Super Mario with a star on
I'mma stop their invincibility
I'm the molten lava
Teach kids to stick with education
Forget the street drama
But all I can do is talk
It's up to you to choose to listen
If not, you can walk the walk
But you might go missing

[Hook: Lily Allen]

[Bridge: Lily Allen]
They will let shots fly
This is London life
It's dangerous outside
They've got guns and knives

[Verse 2: Jme]
See, I'm Boy Better Know T-shirt rocking
CD shotting, government mocking
Hold tight Tom MySpace, chart-topping
Skate park's dropping
Catch me slipping in my ends
With 3310s, just bopping
You need to walk with protection nowadays
I found out the hard way, it was shocking
Hello tazer, yeah, it's shocking
I'm a Winchmore sixth form rider
I'm boring, I don't even drink cider
I'm not naive, though, I'm wiser
Than the girls out of True Tiger and Ruff Ryder
I'm trying to make grime wider
I'm a ninja, I'm like Tinchy Stryder
I don't leave my house
Unless it is Ps, I stay on the web, I'm a spider

[Outro: Lily Allen]
Sun is in the sky oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
Sun is in the sky oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
Sun is in the sky oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
Sun is in the sky oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
