[Verse: Jme]
I got a black Xbox, but I didn't box my ex
I was vexed but still man kept it fresh
Now my girl is the queen of the castle
I got a black BBK tee, now in a box with a snapback
They sold out in about 5 minutes
Fuck a reload, wow
I've got a black swegway, first on the roads
But man didn't wanna have black anymore
So man sticker bombed that shit quickly, like
I've got a black X6 but bare man wanted them
So that's why man like me got the grey ones now
With camo on the side like
I've got a black ski mask but I don't ski
Everybody knows that bar when I MC
Everybody knows my car's bait as me, like
I've got a black iPhone but I don't phone nobody
Cause my phone don't stop ringing like a shotty
That's why mine stays on silent, yeah
I've got a black beemer that I don't want anymore
Want electric, move silent on the roads
Be aware or get laid down like-
I've got a black durag but I don't have no raves
In New York, catch me on the wave like on radio
And it stays like
Serious
Jme
48 hours, done, yeah?
I've got a black ski mask but I don't ski
But I snowboard, dash an MC off-piste
