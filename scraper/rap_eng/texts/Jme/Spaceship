[Intro: Skepta]
Yeah, it's tune of the month, is he dumb? I don't care how long he put it out. I'm riding it
Yeah. Skepta. Send it out to Rebound X, nothing long
Yo

[Verse 1: Skepta]
You see the top four crews in the game? I'm in them
If you don't like me, do something then
Too many screwfaces, I ain't in them
I want paper, dibby dibby wages, I ain't in them
My crew put five 20 pound notes in a roulette machine and spin them
Anybody get rude, I clench my fist and chin them
Forget a mash, forget a clash
They're trash, I'll bin them
I don't wanna lyrical swing, I will physically swing them
That's why I haven't clashed anybody since long son den some win seng
If I hear man say my name, I'll ring them
If I hear any gun talk on my 3310
Find out where they are and link them
Headlock, powerdrive then pin them

[Verse 2: Jme]
I don't know where you think you're going
With them one, two likkle bars, deadout
Clash me, you'll get a par
You know my face, Jamie Adenuga
I don't care what manaman thinks
I heard your mixtape and it stinks
How you perform when you're onstage
Smells exactly like your mixtape
When I spray, everyone gets haps
Jumping about, shouting BRAP BRAP
Doing bare tings with their hands
That's how you know man's got bare fans
You ain't got anyone but cats
About you got bredrins and that
Don't try a ting, man ain't an eediot
Tell you to shh hut yuh muh, dead

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Joseph, but I'm not your average Joe though
I will murk your whole team on a solo
Cause I'm massive in the game, you're a midget in the game
I'm like Pizza Hut and you're like Pizza Go-Go
Me wife a ho? That's a no-no
Never give no girl my last Rolo
Cause I'm still getting thoughts of my girl
Going up and down on her ex man like a yo-yo
But forget that, I'm Skepta, take a photo
Black T-shirt, Boy Better Know logo
Man know, I'm still in the bits, so when they see me they say "Wah gwan, show show"
Bun traffic, I don't go flow
I just come off my two-year ban
I'm still bussing off illegal U-ies in front of the po-po
Red light, but I still go though
Go on then

[Verse 4: Jme]
Jamie and I get deep on the dubs
Vocals never sound weak on the dubs
Man say they wanna hear me dubs on the dubs
I can spit fast like D Doubs on the dubs
My dubs are deep like this is mums on the dubs
Your dubs are cheap like subs on the dubs
Hear my voice in the clubs on the dubs
Strong like a guy at the pub on the dubs
Jamie, I get deep on the dubs
Vocals never sound weak on the dubs
Man say they wanna hear me dubs on the dubs
I can spit fast like D Doubs on the dubs
My dubs are deep like this is mums on the dubs
Your dubs are cheap like subs on the dubs
Hear my voice in the clubs on the dubs
Strong like a guy at the pub on the dubs

[Verse 5: Skepta]
I know you wrote that lyric for me and Jme
So don't even bother explaining it
Your guntalk, i'm not entertaining it
I show love but they ain't embracing it
Stop talking like your voice has bass in it
I've got the title and none of you are taking it
You'll get an action replay Lord of the Mics 2
If you write a bar with my name in it
I'm the best, there's no escaping it
When I'm on the radio, man are taping it
I'm gonna keep spitting till I get a house
And a car with a bassbox and a face in it
You man have been on the road for too long
Stop spending your money, start saving
You're getting old now, you never used to have a beard
Now you're shaving, use your head, you've got a brain

[Verse 6: Jme]
Dickhead, wasteman, poomplex
Don't know what you're thinking, but it's not me and you spitting in the same room flex
When I enter, you exit cuh
You said shit 'bout me and Skepta
Now shit can't be perfect cuh
You let the situation get complex
When I'm in the bits
Your diaphragm sucks in a bit
I bring the pressure, I make the hits
Skepta made six MCs quit
That's right, next MCs can't test me
Skepta, H, Bossman, Pabs, Prez T
You know I come with every
Catch me in Sidewinder, Eski

[Verse 7: Skepta]
I go to many different dances
Some of them are not safe, but I take chances
I got friends in different ends
That's why my family tree has got so many branches
I'm a big artist and I know my name is on your tongue like shoelaces
That's why you see me surfing the net
Looking at these fake gangsters' MySpaces
On this ting, remember their faces
Look at their top friends, clock their faces
The way these black man hate me
Cause I'm a black MC, you would've thought they were racist
I don't talk greaze on a regular basis
But I used to roll with the ball and the cue like Steve Davis
And you won't ever hear me boasting about any likkle Babylon chases

[Verse 8: Jme]
For any rave, when I come around
Everybody knows what's going down
I'm on this ting, look at my face
Don't get rude! Know your place
Drink your drink or just blaze your zoot
Pretend you're on the phone if you need to
Can't jack me, can't rob me, can't screw
Cause I'm a badboy just like you
I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Skepta, he ain't hear what I said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead
I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Skepta, he didn't hear what ya said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead

[Verse 9: Skepta]
Temple tourer, champagne pourer
Winchmore warrior, class A courier
Grime scene ambassador, duppy maker
4 4 saviour, Ally Pally jungle raver
Entry ticket and a borer
Fresh haircut with a side parting and a border
Selby centre explorer, private ahh

YO NASA! NASA, NASA, LIFTOFF LIVE
