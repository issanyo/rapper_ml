It's K-A, check, check, check it out

[Verse 1]

Listen, yeah, yeah, you dun know the Myspace
I'm a vet MC niggas can't violate
I'm two albums deep already
And how ever many singles under my name
Yeah, yeah, you dun know the my K
Fire for no reason, I'm nice
Can't stop me like a Hummer in drive
Gone like I'm roadrunner in spikes
Yeah, yeah put me in the right lane
I'll still breeze on a beat with a bang
I might perform my beats with a band
There ain't no MC deeper than man
Hot like the bottom of the pan
And I'm still totalling on like twang

[Hook]

Man, look at my Myspace, my fanbase is swollen like clams
With old school fans and new school fans
I got UK fans and Europe fans
I got older fans and younger fans
And you dun know I'm repping for my Myspace fam

[Verse 2]

Yeah, yeah you dun know the vibe ain't right in a rave on stage if I ain't
On it with DJ Medonit, excitement levels we go beyond it
Enrol my shows like college, I show you how to do this son
Come like dumb, leave like a boffin
Cause I'm a teacher like KRS-One, one


Haha, I'm just having fun
Know why? Cause I'm MC number 1
Mc number 1
Yeah I know I didn't finish that verse but I don't give a shit
I wrote that shit whilst Mikey was beefing on the phone with his chick
HAHA! It's K-A, It's K-A
