Man ain’t a sideman like Nick Clegg
Don’t try take man for a smeg head
Young black boy baidin and ting
Durag, no skin fade and ting
Boy Better Know black card, that's mine
BMW black car that’s mine
BBK mobile, ring off my line
Badman without the 419
Rep for my ends and I ain’t got a tat
Ive been about when youngers attack
But 1 on 1, you don’t want that
Eidyats wanna try glitch under the map
This badboy lyric I’ll start reeling it off
The ends FEDS start sealing it off
You man are bored
Dip ya hand in pva & start peeling it off
I turned my Blam album into a car
I turned a Tottenham man into a star
You man are jokes
Like dyslexic man walking into a bra
Im on the beat, im on the tune
Look at me, look at you
I win this ting
Using the rare candy cheat on pikachu
Clash me fam you will regret diss
Pace! jme will set diss
Borat. You will neve get this!
Slap man in the face with a wet fish
It’s peak it’s tense
RT Ring Tempz
Bare eidyats trying it with meeeee?
Switch! Turn SSJ3
Jme where’s Wiley, where’s Skepta, did he do a tune with diddy
Shutyamouth fam don’t be silly
Asking bare questions like my names SIRI
My names jme, the grime fixer
Moesh & pictures like Disney Pixar
Don’t mess about with me fam
This is the fucking catalina wine mixer
I’m on a roll, you can’t stop dis
Mans baiding, ain’t you clocked dis?
Big up BBK supporters everyone showing love
Hold tight my block list
I don’t care what you say
I’ll miss my food in Chinese Tuesday
If somebody that don’t know me tries to
Boy man like man like Toby
Jme FDMD
Headtop a man MW3
CONFU? you can’t read
Red ring of death, peak
If not then I will spray quick
PP 90 M1 with the grey clip
Man still wanna chat
I’ll 360 no scope man with an arcade stick
