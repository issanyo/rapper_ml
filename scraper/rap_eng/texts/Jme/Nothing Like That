[Verse 1: Tempa T]
I got bars, yeah got a batch
Like a chicken, we're told that an egg's gonna hatch
You ain't got bars, you ain't a match
When I spit my bars, I make the racks
I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack
DJ play that tune, it's going back
I get promoted, you get the sack
Them tunes there, won't see me spitting on that
You sound horrid, your little black
Guess my man won't be flying on my track
Wanna send bars? But it's not that
Actions first, you don't want nothing like that
You ain't got qualms? Better keep it like that
Cos 2017, I ain't taking no chat
I'm a star, better just keep it at that
I don't come through and just squeeze up in that
I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack, I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack
I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack, I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack
I ain't got bars, but it's not that
But tell me is that what you're really saying?
Shell down shows, know what I'm saying when I touch mic
You better know I'm not playing
You ain't got qualms? You know it's like that
Fuck them man, everyone knows I'm a g
Them boys know - fucking with me, I'm a go mental
Start going on greaze
Calm me down? Boy oh please, don't want to see me pray for enemies
When I spit my bars, I make the racks
Put that down, somebody here get slapped

[Hook: Tempa T and Jme]
You don't want nothing like that (nah)
You don't want nothing like that (nah)
You don't want nothing like that (actions first, truss)
You don't want nothing like that (no)
You don't want nothing like that (nah)
You don't want nothing like that (no)
Nothing like that
Don't want to see me on a stage show when I'm shelling
Nothing like that
You don't want nothing like that
I've been about from day, can't take a slice of my cake
Nothing like that

[Verse 2: Jme]
Some were amazed, some were baffed when they saw that man's on a different stage
Man got paid, and man lit up the rave, cos man's here to entertain
You know about Tempz, you know about Jme - been fucking up tunes for years
Don't be dumb, man want to get emotional like man's gonna shed tears
Man's been about - north, east, west and south
Integrity to Shh Hut Yuh Muh
Don't ask how, when you see me on foot in your ends talking loud
I keep it old school, so you'll still me go check for the local youtes
Same old team, so no gentrification inna the vocal booth
I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack, I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack
I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack, I spit a 4 bar, I get the jack
Man's got bars, spitting since way back
Smashed windows and I hot-wired cars
Now man are stars
15 years deep, your back-catalogue's not like ours
Come on bruv, we're at the top of the game right now, can't make man topple
Nothing but love
Since back when Tempa was looking round for some bottles, nothing like that
Can't spit nothing like that, why you bluffing like that?
Nothing like that
Boy better know, actions first, man will stuff him like that
Straight

[Hook: Tempa T and Jme]
You don't want nothing like that (nah)
You don't want nothing like that (nah)
You don't want nothing like that (actions first, truss)
You don't want nothing like that (no)
You don't want nothing like that (nah)
You don't want nothing like that (no)
Nothing like that
Don't want to see me on a stage show when I'm shelling
Nothing like that
You don't want nothing like that
I've been about from day, can't take a slice of my cake
Nothing like that
