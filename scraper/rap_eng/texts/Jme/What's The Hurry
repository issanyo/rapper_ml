[Shotty Horroh - Verse 1]
When I eat up beef
Could you keep up
With a beast we feast up
We don't leave much
Come and destruct
Any weak pup
Tryna beat us
We're elite look
Man I'm in a league up
Soon as we puff
Seen being with a cheap slut
Wearin' deep cuts
Rippin' deez nuts
Tryna beef up
Get the team look
Bun the Weed up
Lets smoke
Feelin' like I'm Macavelli in his step role
How can you be keepin' up with me you know I roll
When you're takin' a stroll
On my Usain Bolt shit
Livin' how I'm livin' ain't somethin' you can cope with
Gimmi my dick back go get your own shit
Kurt Cobain slash Rollin' stone shit
Straight JD's we don't put no coke in
Bun a load of weed, you ain't never seen smokin'
Everyday sweet street remedy and potions
You ain't bout that
We don't have similar traits
I paint pictures you scribble and trace
I go hard till that millions paid
You're content with that minimum wage
Fuck your system don't think I'm a slave
I'm a king get my pyramid made
Bet those haters didn't picture this day
Quit the bitch and bitch switch up your face
No more winners
They wanna beat us but it just ain't in em'
Fuck anyone that try [?]
When they kneel to the floor
I'm on a rhythm at the finish
Try'n keep up
Get shut down
We're the big dogs when you're tryna bring pups round here
Everybody's screwed that's zombie life
Real talk we don't really give a fuck out here

[Tyler Daley - Chorus]
Been one of those days
Safety first don't mind
What's the hurry
One love remaining
Waiting on one left
Had to guard it
Have you got it in you

[JME - Verse 2]
Heads high
Kill em' with it now
Yep yep JME's gonna kill em' with a flow
These idiots I can't kill em' on the streets
So me and Shotty just kill em' with a beat
Yeah, serious kill em' with the bars
If not, black X6 kill em' with the car
Vroom vroom drive by
Kill em' in the night
Kill em' on sight
Trust me, kill em' on the mic
JME don't stop there kill em' with a rage
Shotty Horroh don't flop yeah kill em' on stage
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Or float like a bullet and kill em' like me
Yeah! Forget this, that and the rest
Us man come through and kill em' with success
The rest of the best get vexed
As we work with the best of the best
We work with the top tier gods
Anyone who's not at the top tiers drop
Shame
You are not in my lane
If you think I'm gonna stop
Guess what
You'll do anything for my spot
Man will start makin' euro-pop
Fame
That's all that's on your brain
And will you ever get to the top
Guess not
Middle finger thats my greetin'
For all the wasteman out there eatin'
Off the music scene
And I'm about to kick down doors if they don't let me in
Everybody knows from time I touch mic it's a wrap
It's skill not luck round here
Everybody's food. That's zombie life
Real talk, we don't really give a fuck round here

[Tyler Daley - Chorus]
Been one of those days
Safety first don't mind
What's the hurry
One love remaining
Waiting on one left
Had to guard it
Have you got it...

[? - Verse 3]
There's a couple of points that need raisin'
Sorry to spoil the occasion
But it's two thousand and thirteen
Must be time for the Manny invasion
Must be time coz the man have been waitin'
Not too many man have been ratin'
I know this flow seems over-used
So I'll switch it up and I'll take em' to...
A whole nother area
Code of flows
Various foes oppose
It ain't fair when I overload
Your old structure
Down to the chromosome
Don't get it twisted
Or tip tangled up
Coz I can go nuts
You'll get man-handled
Strangled and dangled up
My Niggas'll light the candles up
When I'm angry but I'm not angry much
I'm celebrating life with the family look
Since any man can be touched
And I'm just a man
Don't wanna see my hands in cuffs
So I keep on m m movin'
Keep sleepin' on me, keep snoozin'
My point's already been proven
Don't get it twisted it's all an illusion (bun em)
They don't know me like you do (bun em)
Niggas'll show you that voodoo
Say my name and talk about who's who
I'm that type of guy as per usual
I don't know who told you I'm done with (bun em)
Whoever told you that dumb shit
Needs to man the fuck up and front it
Fuck him and whoever he runs with (bun em)

[Tyler Daley - Chorus]
Been one of those days
Safety first don't mind

Waiting on one left
