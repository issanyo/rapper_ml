[Intro]
Jme on production
North London music
Cash Motto in the building, Paw Gang
A whole 96

[Verse]
Fuck anybody cosigning anyone that's going at me
Cuh I didn't start on no one, bare MCs coming at me
Six MCs on just me, man wanna under attack me
But I don't need no one to back me, I've got my pen, it's still handy
He mentioned "Pizza Boy", I still don't understand why he did it
Cuh he don't want lyrics for lyrics, deep down he's more "Wifey Riddim"
He knows me, could've phoned me, but money make man think they're bossy
But seeing as everyone's changed, now I'll pepper your clart, you don't know me
I look around, where's the love gone? Like how you cosigning man
Disrespecting the ends you once picked me up from?
You don't do dem tings where I come from
Riot on mic, got Tottenham in me
Dark nights round here like Gotham City, oi
Tweet when you're coming if you're bad, fam
Preed it, he ain't Bane or Batman
How the fuck has he done more for grime than me this year?
I opened up the scene this year
Gave birth to this idiot breh, can everyone see this here?
What an idiot, yeah
Say what I'm saying ain't true
Some of your best newcomers ain't new
So if you're gonna nominate Yungen
Big up, but nominate Sneakbo too
I'm Cash Motto but I'm playing dirty
Cuh too many man wanna try and murk me
They can out-shoot me, they can out-stab me
But mum's life, they can't out-verse me
If I named you, I rate you, I weren't dissing you
Cuh I know how the internet works
Diss, get three in a week from this nerd
Then let me give you that internet work
Man wanna pepper me for five months
Please understand, in one, I'll ruin him
In my section doing slewing him dubs
Get bored, put a few in him, crud
I do T, not milking, mugs
I got bars, what you saying then, cuz?
You're screaming 0161
But for your city, you ain't doing too much
Geko, Captin, soon link up
Let's do a cypher and have a drink up
Man wanna ride off the 0161 ting
But share their shine with no one
Talk the ting some more
Are you signed to Grimey Limey or
Is iTunes lying to me or
One time for Charlie, I'll slew Grimey Limey's whore
Don't know what you tek man for
Pepper man till they can't tek no more
Where's the guy that made "Oopsy Daisy"?
Not here right now, you can get some more
Back to Patrick, yeah, mad ting
I can't lie, can't stand him
It's coming closer, I planned it
Woke me up, gotta thank him
About "what have I done for the scene?"
When I was on tour, I brang him
He came to mine for dinner before his Fire in the Booth
And you wonder why I can't stand him
I've been writing a lot
Cause I haven't been writing enough
And if I hear any funny things
On your mixtape coming, I'll be lighting you up
Swear down, don't try it again
Want me to stop? Link me or find your pen
Becuh I got bars for your high horse
I don't give two fucks if you know Ralph Lauren
I dissed your Fire in the Booth cuh
You took shots at all the underground niggas
And now you wanna do a mixtape with who?
All the underground niggas
Funny how things turn out
It's funny how things turned round
Stick to Jess Glynne, don't look back
Or you'll see me when you turn round
Let your management let you manage this
Cuh we go back before management
I'm only keeping it real
I'd be pissed if I died and my fans don't know how I feel
Going mad tryna hold this stuff in
Grab the pen, let him have it, fuck it
Grade, Henney, psh, buzzing
Burning bridges, bopping on them barefoot
I'm used to fire, it's nothing
Fuck Radio then, fuck radio now
Cuh man got the net buzzing
But they act like they can't see nothing
It's nothing
I'mma keep on coming and coming and coming and coming
Segway ting when I spun him
Thought he was a villain? Oh no
Hat-Trick hero done him

[Outro]
I don't even need the full 96 bars, what's the wheel up bar?
Let me go, ayy
I know you man just might run out of-
Bluku bye bye, bluku bye bye bye
Miss me with the politics, I ain't no politician
But he ain't no fucking Best Grime Act, kiss my arse, blud
