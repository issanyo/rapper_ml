[Hook: Goldie1]
We see them red lights
We run 'em (skrr skrr)
I know them pigs want an O
I'm running with my gold billies
Running, running wild
Running, running wild (skrr skrr)
Running, running wild
Running, running, running wild

[Verse 1: Jme]
Yeah, serious
I'm not here for you to fear me
As long as you fucking hear me
It's OK, so listen clearly
The police think they can put on
Their blue sirens and they'll scare me
But they don't know me and the mandem
We don't give a shit really
We roll out on a convoy ting
Slick, sick whips, all black or gun metal
Love this shit, hear the turbo sing
Us man only slow down for the speed cameras
So good luck keeping up with us
Burn out and kick up the dust
And aim for a box
Then only God knows what it'll be like
Fam, you will not see me
Like the cover of the Yeezus CD
Back roads and alleyways easy
With 4 Gs and I don't mean EE
Man are going on nang
Endos and wheelies
Man wanna disrespect like I didn't say
Show respect when you see me in BP
Trust, hear the bassline knocking
Badboy tunes, pedestrians clocking
Garms I wear actually ain't stocking
Man ain't rocking the garms you're rocking
No, big tunes nonstop
[?] rudeboy like what?
Make sure the DJs know what's popping
100 miles per hour, I'm not stopping
Man ain't stopping, no way, even if

[Hook: Goldie1]
We see them red lights
We run 'em (skrr skrr)
I know them pigs want an O
I'm running with my gold billies
Running, running wild
Running, running wild (skrr skrr)
Running, running, running wild

[Verse 2: Goldie1]
You see them red lights
Whip moving so quick, you see them headlights
I know them pigs thinks I'm living wrong
When it's time to get Lizzy and I'm dead right
Turn up, turn up, turn up
D12 on that gun shit, [?]
Reload my tyres and a banner, banner
Riding round in that new coupe and it's jamming, jamming
Can't see me, zil to hundred like it's easy
Got gorillas riding with me, all my clique niggas get busy
It's G1, Eden, BBK
Run the whole of my city like it's GTA

[Hook: Goldie1]
We see them red lights
We run 'em (skrr skrr)
I know them pigs want an O
I'm running with my gold billies
Running, running wild
Running, running wild (skrr skrr)
Running, running, running wild
All my niggas running wild
Running, running, running wild
