[Verse 1: Jme]
Yo, police harassing me the shit I don't like
Promoters gassin' me the shit I don't like
Bare Pricks with BBM the shit I don't like
I got a iPhone 4S with a cold light
I shown you on a track I did with Joe Grind
Yeah rap meets grime, you need to hold tight
You got beef with Skepta, you think I don't mind
I'm his brother so I will fight Joe's fights
Oh please, Man will tear up these MC's
You wanna know what I don't like well I don't like man that don't like me straight!
Why you lookin' at me like I just robbed you and your friends for your P's
Skepta told me don't watch nothin'
So I went home and smashed my TV
I tweet everyday, everyone knows me JmeBBK
When you're at a club hear me on a CDJ
Boybetterknow.com that's me yeah
Trust mans gonna max out like T.K
Boy better know mobile yeah Pre-Pay
Won't say that again this ain't a replay

[Verse 2: Jammer]
JLS's shoes you know I don't like
Snitch niggas on the news you know I don't like
Man are asking me for twos you know I don't like
And if I can't bring the crew you know I don't like
I don't L-I-I-I-I-KE
Don't L-I-I-I-KE
Man are acting like they Rocky with a crack-pipe
Smash my iPhone 4 you know I don't like
Niggas shitting on my door you know I don't like
Alright did I tell you a couple of things that I don't like
Bacon sandwich that I don't like
Jamaican antics that I don't like
(ey wah does bombaclart mean?)
Don't chat to me like that that I don't like
Don't call me my yout that I don't like
Don't run when I wanna fight, that I don't like
Girls with size 9 that I don't like
Man in the sideline that I don't like
Chatting shit on my timeline that I don't like
Can't connect to the Wi-Fi that I don't like
Dry toes that I don't like
Swag weed that I don't like
Boat swag that I don't like
Snakeyman's bank card, that I don't like

[Verse 3: Skepta]
A snitch nigga that's that shit I don't like
We'll be driving round your hood for the whole night
Three niggas in the whip, two on a bike
One fucking, we'll move to him on sight
On site, On sight
Couple niggas left cause I'm doing right
I remember '05 I was selling white
Two packs in my whip, big up Suge Knight
Sitting on the wall smoking weed if I see feds then we disappear
And I know this estate so well feds can't catch me around here
If you talk about music I swear nobody fucking with my crew this year
I'm in a crew full of G's but them man hang around dicks like pubic hair
Too many wannabe wifeys playing hard to get games when I know they’re simple
I put an end to your games when I blow my whistle I’m so official
I don't like girls that only tell me they love me when they hear my single
And I don't like niggas that only tell me they love me when they take Dizzle
