[Verse 1]
You can never tell me I'm not real
I've been through everything, seen with my real eyes
Listen and you will realise
I speak the truth, everyone speaks real lies
I wish I was where I was when I was
Wishing I was here, cause then I was clear, but
Now I'm a bit muddled up cause
I've got people tryna take

[Hook]
I wish I was where I was when I was
Wishing I was here, 'cause then I was clear
I'm disappointed
Nah, man, I'm disappointed deeply
'Cause I know that I need the future
But I want the future to need me

[Break 1]
I said future like a prick, man
Fuck commercial hits
Fuck the charts

[Verse 2]
I don't need no bandana and a hammer and shit
This ain't no Santana and Cameron shit
I just wait for record shops to pay me back
While people say Jme this and Jme that
I don't give a damn, none of you knew me
From when I used to walk home from school with Julie
Now everybody wants to talk
Flipping upsets me

[Hook]
I wish I was where I was when I was
Wishing I was here, 'cause then I was clear
I'm disappointed
Nah, man, I'm disappointed deeply
'Cause I know that I need the future
But I want the future to need me

[Break 2]
The future don't even fucking need you, blud
God forbid I die right now
In four years
No one even fucking gives a shit

[Verse 3]
I just need my music, man, then I'm set
I've got an iPod but the battery's dead
I write on envelopes, on anything really
I don't care if the pen is red
I don't care if it's a whiteboard marker
With ink all leaking through the paper
You can ask your lyrics, they'll tell you
They'll wish that I was their creator

[Hook]
I wish I was where I was when I was
Wishing I was here, 'cause then I was clear
I'm disappointed
Nah, man, I'm disappointed deeply
'Cause I know that I need the future
But I need the future to need me

[Outro]
Fucked
Deadout
Everyone forgets you
When you're dead, you're just gone
It's fucked
