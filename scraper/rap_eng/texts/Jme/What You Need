[Intro: Julie]
You, you
You, you
You, you-you-you
You, you

[Verse 1: Jme]
When they hear the word love, they dive in there head-first
I tell them to slow down, I want head first
I get a lot of gash and I ain't even rich
My credit's probably lower than your bitch
I don't answer the phone to girls that act like fools
Might as well call 'em rhetorical phone calls
For real, bruv, it's all about sex
Call me a motherfucker, I'll say your mum's next
See, I know girls that will get low for po
Suck cock for rock, get down for brown
From city to city and from hood to hood
I suck titty to titty, they suck hood to hood
If she swallows, I'm gonna buss in her mouth
If she's rude, I'm definitely bussing her mouth
I don't have to bend my knees to reach across
Cause my ting's so long that my knees can't touch

[Hook: Julie] (x2)
I got what you want
I got what you want
I got what you need
I got what you want

[Verse 2: Wiley]
And all the grimy wifeys wanna get a piece of Wiley
Come around and look slyly, I just live the life of Riley
I'm about, I hear the girls, they are screaming and shouting
Take her on an outing, we're sitting by the fountain
You know I make you laugh, I'm like "girl, I'm not a clown"
And she giggles a little more, you're in your house, I'm coming round
I'm quite hungry, order Chinese, then we can have a night in
Kiss and a fiddle, you're wet, then I push it right in
She knows I do the job, I've got her hormones fighting
It's the truth that I'm writing
I speak the truth when I'm writing, I don't chat shit
I speak my life and so I couldn't ever be biting
Gash ring me up saying that they know me
They wanna get me in their beds and see if they can show me
A good time, hood time, stiff, she'll get the boney
You can ring me up, girl, when you feel lonely

[Hook: Julie] (x2)
I got what you want
I got what you want
I got what you need
I got what you want

[Verse 3: Jme]
See, this is why I don't let girls phone my phone
Cause they take, chatting shit 'bout she wants to play Snake
2 2s, look at my screen
And I see "delete Jessica Mobile"
I'm like "hey, wait, nah, serious, send me my phone
Or I ain't ever linking you again on your own"
Cause I hate when chicks try take man for pricks
Cause I'm not going on hostile
I can be a hot-headed idiot and end up in court
But I'm not getting shift, nah, I ain't getting caught
Cause I count myself lucky that I'm still on the streets
So count yourself lucky that you're with Jme
Stop checking my messages, back off a bit
Give me room, give me space, lack of respect
You're always in my face, don't worry though
If you stay there, I'll move to a next place

[Hook: Julie] (x2)
I got what you want
I got what you want
I got what you need
I got what you want
