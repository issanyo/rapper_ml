[Intro: Wiley]
Because, y— d'you know what?
That's a good thing to say because if you say "grime's dead" Everyone will sorta think "Oh, is grime dead?"
Some people who'll know it ain't dead will say "No, it's not dead" Some people will go along and think "Yeah, it is dead"
And in that case, that will flush out the people
Who shouldn't even be there
And then the people who should be there will remain
So when I look at them "grime's dead" T-shirts
Sometimes I think "Yeah, it is dead
Grime's so dead that it's not dead!"

[Chorus: Jammer]
Yo, wide awake in the scene
Me and my circle shapin' the scene
Dem man try bring fake to the scene
We clock that they can't partake in the scene
You didn't drop no tape in the scene
Ain't got a reload, ain't in the scene
Dem man there try takin' the dream
Think that they are but they ain't in the scene

[Verse 1: Chip]
Seen us standin', so outstandin'
Light this amm' ting, I'm not landin'
You're no bandit, stand like raskit
Had myself when no one backed it
Mandem skankin', they're on a dab ting
UK ting, go home, black cab ting
Bore up what? Chat shit, stop actin'
Man might fling that shield like Captain
Defensive tool used when attackin'
I'm not new to sends or clashin'
Never been sets, on sound you're slackin'
Swing rounds till man down, no lackin'
Ask 'round in my scene, I'm active
Blast rounds on MCs for acting
Konnichiwa flow I'm stampin'
Born champion, long before "Champion"
Verse not ending, got more pendin'
This one here nasty, MAC 10 ting
'Llow me, you're not real, you're pretendin'
You're on what I'm off, I'm on a next ting
Beats impactin', no relaxin'
Cop work and shot that, get stacks in
My pad, no fiction, just facts in
Your tracks should be the soundtrack for Catfish (yeah)

[Chorus: Jammer & D Double E]
Wide awake in the scene
Me and my circle shapin' the scene
Dem man try bring fake to the scene
We clock that they can't partake in the scene
You didn't drop no tape in the scene
Ain't got a reload, ain't in the scene (oh, my God)
Dem man there try takin' the dream
Think that they are but they ain't in the scene (ooh)

[Verse 2: D Double E]
I've been rippin' the scene to bits from sixteen
And I'm still me (yeah), ten times better than when I was sixteen
Man couldn't test when I was sixteen
Even man that was older than sixteen
Didn't believe that I was younger than sixteen
Always here, always been
Always fresh, always clean
That's me (mre, mre)
Nah, you ain't been where I've been
Or seen what I've seen
Dem time there you weren't on the scene
I was always clean in the scene
Pushed to fulfill my dream in the scene
Cuh man a mek money and man a mek plans
And man a mek money and badabupbup
That's what I'm on right now, see? (Ching-ching)
Badabupbup
Don't mek a man bring the machine (brrah)
You can't squash it like tanger— tsk! (Brrah)
Mek a man shake just like tambourine
Push a operation like the Marine
Take dem out, take dem out of the scene
Cuh dem man there don't add to the scene
Just study and steal and grab from the scene, just nah

[Chorus: Jammer & Jme]
Wide awake in the scene
Me and my circle shapin' the scene
Dem man try bring fake to the scene
We clock that they can't partake in the scene
You didn't drop no tape in the scene
Ain't got a reload, ain't in the scene
Dem man there try takin' the dream (serious)
Think that they are but they ain't in the scene

[Verse 3: Jme]
Trust me, bare arseholes
Man try come with some bravado
I'm from the days of no videos
Just mic, lyrics, blud, hold your own
These times man was walkin' on road
Buildin' a scene and I didn't even know
Same ting we done on the radio
Is what we do now on big stage shows
We're doin' it 'cause we done it
You can't ruin it 'cause we run it
Live it while you hate, we will create
You're losin' it 'cause we bun it
Kill it, we love it, innit?
Blood, sweat, and years in the game
Everything's changed but man look the same
You preheat the oven, I preheat the whip, fam, stay in your lane

[Bridge: Miraa May]
Flower in my hand
You can't stop me and my friends
All that hype and all that bullshit
Paranoia can make you lose it
Always had this, who you foolin'?
Make your movie, tell your story
It's a celebration

[Verse 4: Wiley]
I've been in the scene since MRC 60s
Born late 70s, not 60s
I know about music from the 60s
Gyaldem are black, white, Asian, and mixies
I'll be makin' beats in my 60s
Head screwed on, that's why you gotta pick me
Bro, I took the risk, it was risky
Won't get offended if anybody diss me
Ayy, talk is cheap and we know that
Pass the gelato, fam, and let me roll that
Everybody's new hat, looking at my old hat
New pics looking like old ones I took with a Kodak
Throwaway, throwaway
If you don't know style then go away
I came in the game for a reason
I don't last a game, I last seasons
Energetic, I leave the dance paralytic
If anybody's got any talk, then direc' it
If anybody's got any talk, please projec' it
Wireless, I got the vibe-us
Looking for the rosé wine-us
I'm the definition of grime-us
They can't divide us
If you can't breathe it, unblock your sinus

[Chorus: Jammer]
Wide awake in the scene
Me and my circle shapin' the scene
Dem man try bring fake to the scene
We clock that they can't partake in the scene
You didn't drop no tape in the scene
Ain't got a reload, ain't in the scene
Dem man there try takin' the dream
Think that they are but they ain't in the scene
