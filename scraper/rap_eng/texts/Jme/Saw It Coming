[Verse 1: Wiley]
I saw it coming, I was away from it earlier
This crew's watching me, they all envy
It's cool, keep watching me
I will burn yah
I'm just tryna live but don't tempt me
Because my business don't concern yah
No one's taking my chain you can bet me
You don't like it, take it further
Yeah I'm one of them boys if you edge me
Trouble tali, watch me I'll rally
Back and get busy with a bat and bally
You're not aggy
See you on the road getting chased like anybody else down streets and alley's
Win some, lose some
Then pretend to be [?] (boom)
Revenge is on the horizon
Status is rising
I was like JR, then stop writing
And you can hear miss beats is focus
Like I used to be, musics grew to me
What can you prove to me
I'm still moving free browsing units
All my eyes closed and white labels on the streets
That's paper still
Didn't like the labels still
Because I saw it coming
Dizzee, Cage, then I went down to the streets of rage
Me and Bionics beef, on it
All year 'round regardless I was on it
Run up on the radio don't miss a rave
And smack up anybody who tries to get brave
I saw it coming though
In the end my tolerance was zero
Don't be a hero
You can't say I don't rep for the manor though
Saw me coming I spray up a bagga shows

[Chorus: Wiley]
I saw it coming
You saw me coming
Down in the hood the beats were running
Watch the movement you saw it coming
Yeah yeah me and my boys are top gunning
When I get to the door at the dance
There's a bit of a hassle so we got to run in
You see them gyal in the corner?
It's my tune they're humming
I saw it coming
You saw me coming
Down in the hood the beats were running
Watch the movement you saw it coming
Yeah yeah me and my boys are top gunning
When I get to the door at the dance
There's a bit of a hassle so we got to run in
You see them gyal in the corner?
It's my tune they're humming

[Verse 2: Jammer]
You shoulda seen it coming
I blew the crop
But I weren't the one that grew the crop
Certain man that knew where I [?] up
Tried don't try flip the script 'cause I'm clued up
Tried to beat me, but I weren't too fucked
Look at my face nigga I'm not bruised up
No scars no they weren't tooled up
Now look at me yeah I've moved up
'Cause on the road for the cream
And you're still chasing the dream
Nah, that's not good for the scene
How you gonna break bread
Live good with the team
Jammer's a blatant G
And I can see hate in me
Nah there's no staking me
That's why everybody still rating me

[Verse 3: Ears]
I shoulda seen it coming but
I was blinded,  by the long hard hours that I grinded
Beef is something that I've had a couple times
Ran a couple times
I've bagged a couple guys
Should've saw it coming
What can I say
I was ignoring something that was blatantly there
I blatantly cared
But I don't mind
God was watching
There was three of us and there was ten of them
They rushed me what can I see them again
I'm not a guy to, contemplate
But you see it will be me v them again
Because I believe in judgement day
Believe you me you don't want that day
Because right now everything's fine
But at the end of the day you will be on like a race

[Chorus: Wiley]
I saw it coming
You saw me coming
Down in the hood the beats were running
Watch the movement you saw it coming
Yeah yeah me and my boys are top gunning
When I get to the door at the dance
There's a bit of a hassle so we got to run in
You see them gyal in the corner?
It's my tune they're humming
You saw it coming
I saw it coming
Down in the hood the beats were running
Watch the movement you saw it coming
Yeah yeah me and my boys are top gunning
When I get to the door at the dance
There's a bit of a hassle so we got to run in
You see them gyal in the corner?
It's my tune they're humming

[Verse 4: Jme]
(Come on Jme, wagwan, wagwan, you're a war MC who's got war bars)
Please bredrin shut your mouth
I'm the only MC that comes with metaphor bars
I don't mean similie fake bars
I mean five metaphors and eight bars
Started a game, picked up a que
That lyric inspires you to go make bars
I didn't see nothing coming
Because it all happened too fast
Two years ago I was no one
Two two's and my dad know's two bars
I should've seen it coming
'Cause even though it happens so fast
I kinda knew deep down inside
That all is talent, will last

[Verse 5: Syer]
What
I can always see them coming
They don't wanna talk to my face
They grumbling
Under they breath them guys are mumbling
Don't say nuttin' to my face but one thing
The fucks they are is snake guys
Nothing but fake guys looking through fake eyes
I think you should realise
That I don't get phazed by them lies (look)
Anyone can talk shit like them
But I ain't like them
I ain't a prick like them
You won't ever see me slip like them
'Cause I ain't the one that talk shit like them
You never see me coming I'm running on them gunning on them
I ain't no mumbling like them
I ain't a dick blud, imma see through them
Speak to my face then see what I do then

[Chorus: Wiley]
I saw it coming
You saw me coming
Down in the hood the beats were running
Watch the movement you saw it coming
Yeah yeah me and my boys are top gunning
When I get to the door at the dance
There's a bit of a hassle so we got to run in
You see them gyal in the corner?
It's my tune they're humming
