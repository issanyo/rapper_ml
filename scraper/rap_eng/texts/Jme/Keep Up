What’s going on these days?
People are getting famous from YouTube?
I mean, have you heard of that guy, KSI?
Apparently he’s got millions of subscribers, and a book
And a movie, and a Lamborghini, and a song about a Lamborghini
Who the hell are the Sidemen? All over my timeline
The world’s going crazy!
All-all-all-all we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Hook: KSI]
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Verse 1: KSI]
Growing like I’m the universe (too big)
So ahead that these dudes reverse
Fly with my car when I bolt in the lead
Smash it like Hulk then I drop ‘em like WWE
Parties, we doing it (big, big)
Views that I’m getting so (big, big)
Girls that I sleep with say (big, big)
Laid in America (big, big)
I'm on a roll, pass the control
Hit it worldwide when I put on a show
All-all-all-all we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Pre-Hook: KSI]
This morning, I woke up on a mission
Head out the window screaming, "Fuck the competition!"
When I go missing, means I’m steady on the grind
I’ve got nothing but success up on my mind
Keep up

[Hook: KSI]
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Skit + (Jme)]
Have you heard of this Jme guy?
What the hell is 'grime' music? Is it a UK thing?
Because apparently the whole world are getting into it
How many members do you think are in this BBK gang?
Because I’m beginning to lose count
They seem to be everywhere
My little brothers and sister seem to love them. Hmm..
(Serious), maybe they can’t that bad
(It's Jme)
All we really wanna know is can you (Shut ya mouth)

[Verse 2: Jme]
Everyone’s baffed, “Who are they?, who are you?”
How's JJ got a Lambo too?
It’s a simple equation, fam (what?)
You get bare P’s, if you get bare views
Like you get bare P’s if you work bare hours
And I get bare P’s if I make bare tunes
Don’t hate now cause man’s got powers
You get bare slaps if you get bare rude
Turn the clock back 10 years, nobody cared
Man was airing me
5 years later, my first album dropped
Now man are hearing me
Today: Integrity> and Integri-tees
Man are wearing me
All-all-all-all we really wanna know
Is can you keep up? (Serious)

[Pre-Hook: KSI]
This morning, I woke up on a mission
Head out the window screaming, "Fuck the competition!" (Fuck it)
When I go missing, means I’m steady on the grind
I’ve got nothing but success up on my mind
Keep up

[Hook: KSI]
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?
