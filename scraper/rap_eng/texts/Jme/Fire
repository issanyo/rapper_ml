Fire, Fire (Fire)

[Verse: Shystie]
See I'm on fire
So I say F 'em
The o' couple guys
Want me to F 'em
I don't wanna cuss
I don't mean to offend
You ain't on my wave
Go change to FM

Baby, fire all around me
The birds are flockin'
But the guys, can't keep up
Wish I had time
Fucking hell
Who's even trying?
So I'm sitting here and sighing
If it's him that you're denying
Got me screaming, testifying
I'm the one
You two's are lying

Liar, liar, phone's on fire
You're listening, like you're wired
Sick and tired, of my spire
Pissing down on all you liars
I'm the truth, I can see
That you're gassed
Must be the juice, in the booth
Imma have you 'arassed
Must be the news

You don't want to be my target picture
With some other girl
I'll rip out you're bitch
Get out my lane
Like I'm on the M1
Carpets on your club
I'll pull down the strings on me
Just like the buzz
Fuck 'em out you're butt
And who you be
Honey still getting stung

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire, Hotter than the sun
See I'll burn it down
They'll turn up to them can
See we're on fire
Hotter than the sun
See we'll burn it down
They'll turn up to them can

[Chorus]
So we say:
"burn, burn, burn"
You ain't shit!
"burn, burn, burn"
Tell that bitch!
"burn, burn, burn, burn"
If ya know they ain't shit
Then tell that bitch: "burn"

[Verse 2: Double S]
When I'm on the rhythm
They know I flow crazy
I got flags, girl, you're running
From your land, lady
Everything sweet
Everything crazy
Every day's my birthday
I'm just trying to get cake

Never living like me
Oh Shystie
This beat is quite basic
I'm just here try'na live me ting
So tell them not to wake me
I got a couple stunted bars
But all of the niggas that are acting spacey
But the tings I've been on lately
Got me lost and they still amaze me. (oh)

I has to get wavy, see
Too many MCs are ABC
To the B, to the E, to the FG
H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P
But me I spit on the rhythm
With no apology
I ain't got time
So it don't bother me
Straight crack in the booth
Is my policy
Then everyone repeats
Load up to me

I had the, slow father
I go harder
Get on the rhythm
And show we don't play drama
Life is a bitch, and I might harm her
And I don't really give a fuck, about karma
I got, so many flows, and I'm bringing them back. (Ay)
I got, so many girls, and I'm getting them gassed. (Ay)
I had the, girls that sound like I'm ballin'
You know what I done?
I sent her back! (ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire, Hotter than the sun
See I'll burn it down
They'll turn up to them can
See we're on fire
Hotter than the sun
See we'll burn it down
They'll turn up to them can

[Chorus]
So we say:
"burn, burn, burn"
You ain't shit!
"burn, burn, burn"
Tell that bitch!
"burn, burn, burn, burn"
If ya know they ain't shit
Then tell that bitch: "burn"

[Verse 3: Jme]
I'm not a gay icon, but please
You don't wanna mess with man like me
I don't think he, heard what i said
I'll jump on a beat like a fed
I don't even try
I don't play rugby
I'm not that guy
Messy, but I don't kick ball
I feature on bare tracks, like pitbull

Got bare bars
Good signal
You've got a shit album
Good single
Bare MCs, DJs
Tweeting, texting
Asking me for a jingle
So, I'm scared to ask, but why?
I done told you that I'm not that guy
Give me an email, send that, simple
No gas, no wrinkle

I'm a merk cuz', bare excitement
Like it's a circus
Wanna see more exciting tings
Check my Youtube Channel or Zerkaa's
If you hear something in my bar
You think that I didn't even know that I said
Boy better know, when I'm on the mic
And I speak, better know
That I said it on purpose

That's right, I'm a merk cuz'
Saying it again
Pass me a pen
Black 2s gonna make tunes right
Past, then my moustache sounds great
Like Ghetts

Yeah, haters gon' hate
Ya can't stop them fam
That's fate
Anyway, all I'm gonna say
Laters gonna late

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire, Hotter than the sun
See I'll burn it down
They'll turn up to them can
See we're on fire
Hotter than the sun
See we'll burn it down
They'll turn up to them can

[Chorus]
So we say:
"burn, burn, burn"
You, you, you ain't shit!
"burn, burn, burn"
Tell, tell, tell that bitch!
"burn, burn, burn, burn"
If, if, if ya know they ain't shit
Then tell that bitch: "burn"
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
If ya know they ain't shit
Then tell that bitch : "burn"
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
Tell that bitch!
If ya know they ain't shit
Then tell that bitch : "burn"
