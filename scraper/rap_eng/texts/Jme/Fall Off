[Chorus - Big Zuu]
They just wanna talk like they are on things but we know that they ain't on nuttin'
So (oohh) if they hate I ain't fussing
Said he's on that, I'll brush him
Man are winning that's the reason that they're cussing
About I'm due to blow mana been buzzing, buzzing
The hate on my name comes in the discussion
Because my bars them bug out their brain, concussion
Me I'm saying what you're favourite rapper doesn't
169
Spit real facts [repercussion?], duppy any beat that I'm touching

[Verse 1 - Big Zuu]
I don' care 'bout the ting they supposedly clutchin (no, no)
What about your balance it ain't got much in (ah)
Fall off, fall off, little pipsqueak munchkin
T-T-Talking rubbish you ain't dumping
Mana put her to sleep and start slumping (slap slap slap)
B-I-G I'll get the place jumping (B-I B-I)
Use your face like speaker
When I set pace then man feel the thumping (ah)
Still I chase bread not beef
Cuh deep down mans up to something
They wanna hold man down with a lease
Me I left that there for the outright funding
They tryna be stuck in the ends
Talk about who bunned who and who bunned him (nah)
Who buns that and who runs this (ah)
But worked their whole life and still they ain't got shit (no, no, no)
Dumb kids think mans rich 'cause they got bricks
They ain't got nothing to show and that's the plot twist
Fam they need to retire because they lost grip (skrr)
Man think they're bad but their block's in the posh bit
(ah, ah, ah, ah)
Me I just laugh got my stacks from the moshpit (ah)
I came far from a black box
But you still can't measure man's speed though (no)
And no I didn't come up off a crackpot
But still I get Ps from a reload (yeah)

[Chorus - Big Zuu]
They just wanna talk like they are on things but we know that they ain't on nuttin'
So (oohh) if they hate I ain't fussing
Said he's on that, I'll brush him
Man are winning that's the reason that they're cussing
About I'm due to blow man ah been buzzing (been buzzing)
The hate on my name comes in the discussion
Because my bars bug out their brain, concussion
Me I'm saying what you're favourite rapper doesn't
Spit real facts that [we're cushion?], duppy any beat that I'm touching

[Verse 2 - Jme]
Don't respond to nothin' but action
It's on the rules no claxon (trust)
Don't spit nothing but facts
And manna on top from heat from acts
On them stations there, got packed in
But us man still on the mad ting (trust)
Jme Integrity got an award for Oscar and I ain't actin'
Brought up in poverty, so my dream was to afford the best
Then I got clocked I'm only out the red when I can afford to rest
Grew up in T, obviously
With road mentality
I had to make sure man's still in these streets (yeah)
So on the mic man's killing these beats (woo)
See man's face man's winning big T
On all the best tunes man's winning with feasts (trust)
My vocals teetotal, these man are out here raving killing with cheese
Man are gassing up their Insta story
I pretend like shit's hunky-dory
They're still living at home with nothing to show by the time they get to forty
Man are still lying to the youth, so I'ma give you nuttin' but truth
Whether you play by the rules or stay on road t
There ain't no easy route (trust)
They all have a price to pay
I know it sounds mad when I say if you reach success
End up in jail, or in a grave, you learnt the hard way

[Chorus - Big Zuu]
They just wanna talk like they are on things but we know that they ain't on nuttin'
So (oohh) if they hate I ain't fussing
Said he's on that, I'll brush him
Man are winning that's the reason that they're cussing
About I'm due to blow manna been buzzing
The hate on my name comes in the discussion
Because my bars bug out their brain, concussion
Me I'm saying what you're favourite rapper doesn't
Spit real facts that [?], duppy any beat that I'm touching
