[Intro]
Grime tune genie
Three a pair, not one of them can see me
Touch man more time then a BB
TOUCH his yard, touch man with TV
Holla everyone that said free me
Now I'm on a ting like...
FREE AZAAAY!
FREE FARLEY

[Verse 1: Chronik]
You might see me with JME (Serious!)
Doin' the JME
Don't think that you can hype up and start doin' a Tempa T (Next Hype!)
I roll with a samurai sword
I call it the President T
Give man a presidential cut
He won't do the rolex sweep
When I say this next bar don't think I'm talkin bout sleep
I know man behind four brick walls that do not get no sleeve
The boidem are onto us like I done a flow from the cream
I swear down that I cannot listen to these MCs
You do not know what's peak

[Verse 2: Jme]
I'm so nang, I bread myself
JME's sicker, JME's sick
Man wanna clash me, girls harass me
Give me a mic and beat and gas me
I was on road bussin' up pricks
Now I'm on stage shows fuckin up shit
It's all excitin'
I do my ting, truss me
It's more then grime
Pass me the mic
I'm gonna light up this party tonight
All them man tried to par me, alright
Trust me that's like asking to fight
Pass me the mic, pass me the mic
I'm gonna light up this party tonight
All them man tried to par me, alright
Trust me that's like asking to fight

[Verse 3: Tempa T]
See guys on the strip hyping the hype
Don't wanna see me hyping the hype
We can do this ting and i don't care what the hype is
RIBS
Now you can see where my hype is
Don't want it, shim
I'm not the slightest, kujo you belong where the mic is
Big man ting I'll bun where the mic is (BAX)
Where's the hype I'm the hypest (Hype)
I'll make a man known to his face (Hype)
Tell a man all in his face (Bye)
I have to punch up guys (Hi)
If i see man and his guys
Dun kno I'll come with the fight
This guy's lookin' at me I ring off his iris (RING!)
I'm that guy where the fight is, livest, boys screamin' in my Iris
Why he couldn't see
Hyping his ting but he couldn't see
Look in his face now he's not seen
Lad, you won't be a normal being
Caution, you just take overseein' (Hype!)
But I done all this preein'
That's the ting but I got my mac ringing (Tin!)
Waste mandem start wingin' (Tin!)
Make man jump off the fence (Tin!)
Watch man jump off the railing (Tin!)
Make man run round the car
Make man start and run over stars (Tin!)
All his bredrins are screaming
"DRIVE, DRIVE, DRIVE, get in the fucking car!!
Don't wanna get caught by this guy
He's gonna kill us I can see it in his eyes "
