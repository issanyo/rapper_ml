[Hook]
I love music so much, I actually want to eat the tune
So I spit bars on the beat like flies do to dissolve their food
I clear my whole plate, not a string or a hi-hat left
Burp out a deep bass, pick my teeth with a treble clef

[Verse 1]
My name's Jamie Adenuga, you can't pronounce it, I don't know how
Cause it's vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel, easy
No excuses, listen to my lyrics as the bassline oozes
Jme spits and he produces, but badman G.Tank produced this
I come from a time before grime, I used to rhyme in Year 9
So don't tell me what music to make cause the music's mine
(You know I'm murking, init?) I've been doing this music for time
Wanna test me? You've got a big mountain to climb, better get in line, safe

[Verse 2]
Trust me, famalam, I was on a big man ting from birth
The first time my feet touched the Earth, dun know, it was on Harrogate turf
When I was young, I used to go church
Christianity was forced on me before I could speak
But I won't get into that, cause it's way too deep
You couldn't handle the thoughts in my brain
Like tissue paper tryna stop rain
But a snowflake can stop a train
Strength in numbers, you know what I'm saying?
This ain't a game, shit just happens
While music is the aim
All of my lyrics have a meaning and a purpose
I don't spit bars in vain, safe

[Verse 3]
I'm a rudeboy, badman, don, dan, dapper
Call me the left cheek slapper
I don't have a gun or electric zapper
But I don't rap, how am I a gangster rapper?
All I do is make big tunes
Even if I use these basic loops
People assume that Jme's new
Even true I've been making tunes from [?]
You see me? You get me? I make my own garms like [?]
Ain't picking up food or picking up semis
But I pick up the mic whenever you're ready, safe
Anybody hating, going on bitter
Jme ain't bothered, he left the hood, nigga
No, start following on Twitter
And you'll know what's popping, safe
