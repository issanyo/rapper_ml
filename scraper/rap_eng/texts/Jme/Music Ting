[Verse 1:]
They say you get out what you put in
I've been screaming Boy Better Know, CEO, on the roads
From about 6 years ago
And what have I got to show? Apart from the stress and woe?
Chart success? No
But a fan base that still grows
They say you reap what you sow
Now I'm on tour with Stryder
Somebody pass me the fertilizer
Promoter, didn't you read the rider?
I earn a wage on the stage
Tryna' sow the seed
I just gaze at these ravers, they're so deceived

[Hook:]
They don't want me round here
But I slipped in (slipped in)
Yeah, yeah,
The music ting
No, no, no, no, no
They don't want me round here
But I slipped in (slipped in)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The music ting

[Verse 2:]
They say money makes the world go round
But it was spinning before currency
Those who choose to keep their eyes shut
Are no better than those who cannot see
But I can see better than, most of you
Cause I've been a veteran
Since my hepatitis injection
Since mumsy had the C-Section
From birth, I know why I was put on this Earth
To see the difference between what something costs, and what it's worth
It wasn't a gift or a curse
It was something I had to learn
If I'm faced with two bad options in life, I know what's worse

[Hook:]
They don't want me round here
But I slipped in (slipped in)
Yeah, yeah,
The music ting
No, no, no, no, no
They don't want me round here
But I slipped in (slipped in)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The music ting

[Verse 3:]
See they think we're crooks
They were looking at the bad, not the good
That's why I'm bigging up man like Nooks
He was still booking us man for the shucks
That's why I'm bigging up man like AJ
He won't forget man on pay day
Instant bank transfer no lay lay
Not left out in the rain like Ray J
Can't forget man that don't forget me
So I'm bigging up man like Tim and Barry
Together like Weed and Danny
Together like Dec and Anthony
I told you they won't forget me
On my Famous? album they blessed me
I'm bigging up man like SB
Keeping my face on the screen, safe

[Hook:]
They don't want me round here
But I slipped in (slipped in)
Yeah, yeah,
The music ting
No, no, no, no, no
They don't want me round here
But I slipped in (slipped in)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The music ting
