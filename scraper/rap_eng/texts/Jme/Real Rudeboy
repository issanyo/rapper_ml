[Verse 1 : Skepta]
Fuck the police, I see through them
They bring guns and drugs into the country
Then lock me up if I use them
Like Tempa I'm shouting 'slew them'
You're looking for the wrong person
You need to lock up the sergeant
That's linking up with the german
The same sergeant that's got the world scared
Of a man in a turban
As long as you lot act the fool
God forgive me if I buss my tool
I'll break any law, break any rule
Tell a policeman don't take it out on me
'Cause you was a chief at school
And someone punched out your teeth at school
Now you wanna talk like a badboy
I'm laughing out loud so much, LOL

[Verse 2: Frisco]
First thing I got to make this clear
Big Frisco, totally unruly still no love for the boydem here
Tottenham that was the place that schooled me
And even though everyting's nice now
On the road man still gotta mind out
No long ting if it's beef
We can meet in the middle like Skepta's eyebrow
Wow, the game we're running it
You man have got a long wait
'Cause to tell you the truth we ain't ever gonna be done with it
There's a flow ...? Run with it
Give me 16 bars I'm done in it
You shot work but you look like you're bunnin' it
Fuck the boydem, I ain't breaking rules no more
I destroy them

[Hook]
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules

[Verse 3: JME]
If rules are made to be broken
Then I'm the guy to break them
I do what I want, smile in your face
Then slap the guy that made them
Been harrased by police more times than I've tweeted the word Amen
I'm not a wreckless yout
But if I need to I do a 100 on the A10
Rags, about boydem
Buss the lights and annoy them
I do the same ting in the music
All the rules, I avoid them
Like fuckin' hell I've had enough of this shit
Spend my whole career stuck in this pit
Think I'm a dickhead MC come to spit for 5 years
Get ...?

[Verse 4: Jammer]
I'm breaking the rules, stop dissing (believe me)
I don't care who's listening
Boy Better Know full grasping the system
Anytime us man come around presidential styley when badman's visiting
Plus the swag's on a 100 million (through the roof)
They get the air no billion
I've been breaking the rules since I was in school
Now it's champagne parties, chicks in the pool
And my girlfriend's breaking my balls
'Cause man back to music making calls
Making calls, making paper
Music ting manna inna dem labour
Boy Better Know we're breaking the rules
Any unbroken rules man'll come back and break them later

[Hook]
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
Real rudeboy, breaking all the rules
