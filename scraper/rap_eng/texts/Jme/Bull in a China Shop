[Verse 1: Jme]
Me and Poet don't need no crew
And we've got Vuj on FaceTime too
Dun know, you see me with a Boris bike
Might have to slav squat at the photoshoot

[Verse 2: Poet]
Yo, man ain't better than Kyle
Man are in Egypt, chilling in the Nile
Man are so sweet, yeah, Tate & Lyle
Take a man's girl, then I might just smile

[Verse 3: Jme]
Smile? Yeah, that's what I do
Cause when I pass away, man think about me
They see the smile with the chipped tooth
Bare bullshit when they think of you

[Verse 4: Poet]
Out of the bunch, can't hunch Quasimodo
But your girl want a piece of the po po
So mi put my little ting on the GoPro
Ooh, just keep it on the low-low

[Verse 5: Jme]
Keep that on the low
Man's got blacks but I keep mine in a row
Serious, Jme and Poe
Spitting back to back, keep up with the flow

[Verse 6: Poet]
What do we think of Tottenham?
That's right, I'm a gooner
Dem man dere get a clip, fuck a looner
Dickhead, yeah, give me space, give me room-a

[Verse 7: Jme]
Switch it up, hair's out like Akuma
Elbow drop, nah, it's not a rumour
Man tried to give me 48 hours
Nah, fuck that, man will done sooner

[Verse 8: Poet]
What do we think of shit?
Man are bull, no pitch
Run a next ting and I ain't got a stitch
I can see you like I'm Crazy Titch
(What do we think of shit?)
