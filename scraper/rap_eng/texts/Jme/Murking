[Verse 1: JME]
I'm murking, murking, murking, murking, thanks
Hold tight all the mandem in the place right now that wanna just skank
Hold tight the guys that think I got big overnight like Tom Hanks
If you don't like JME you can eternally underground plank
Your whole booking fee probably won't fill up my petrol tank
To book me nowadays cost more than all the champagne that you've drank
In your life, I get withdrawal symptoms from Barclays bank
I'm murking, murking, murking

[Verse 2: JME]
Pour me some apple juice coz man don't drink no cham-pag-ne
You will see me rolling with a little short man like Jack Dee
Big up the goons who bought 96 Fuckries for 79p
But I make G-R-I-M-E for the L-O-V to the E
If I'm on set with the OG'z or BoyBetterKnow then it's on top
The only reason them man are not skanking, is coz they're in shock
My flows more dangerous than a bot with a Boltok
I'm murking, murking, murking

[Verse 3: JME]
If you don't know what grime is then you must be 86
I sell music without a pop feature or naked chicks
I break the rules, I'll wake up a sleepwalker with a fly kick
Everybody knows that I came from the bottom, but I'm not shit
Sure, you've got a shank, I hear dat, but I don't care bout beef
Everybody knows that I won't Run for it like Hanks, I'm not a Chief
Frisco come through and take man out like Wisdom teeth
I'm murking, murking, murking

[Verse 4: JME]
Get brave and run up your mouth get boxed like Tempz' hair
Chat shit about Tempa T & get boxed like Tempz was here
K.O - I'll pay for the body to get cleared
Dunknoe he's got the shotgun there and I've got the Santander
I spend bags & bills, then I take my accountant bags of bills
You little wasteman spending bags & bills on fags and pills
Gears of War 3, I'll pick up the grenades and frag some kills
I'm murking, murking, murking

[Verse 5: JME]
They say you only use 10% of your brain, well I use six
If I was to use 10% man would start levitating shit
So if you don't like music I will send you into orbit
Tony Blair will be Â£50 overdrawn before I quit
Even when I work with an acoustic artist, I can never be whack
Everybody totally loved mine & Ed Sheeran's track
Maybe because GINGER is an anagram of BLACK
I'm murking, murking, murking
