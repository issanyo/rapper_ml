INTRO:
You are about to experience
A day in the life of JME, MIC controller

Man has to wake up early
I mean 9 o'clock early
Take my phone of charge brush my teeth my hairs messy but rags, man ain't a girly
Can't find my watch, my necklace or earring
Who's taken my jewelry
I know it was Skepta, but if i ask him i know he's gonna say it was Julie
(Whistle noise)Whistle out my window, who's that
Only meridian man use that
So it must be lieutenant or Pablo or Presky or Trickster or anyone who's that
It's Dan what you sayin' B, wait blud let me bring down my key
Come up stairs you can bill a track, quick before Skepta gets back on the PC
(phone ringtone) Answer my phone, it's some shit MC chattin' about collaboration
No time to cop look at my watch, 8 o'clock gotta get down to radio station
Reach station give out the phone line number, 07950
(yeah) Big up two hop, big up riverside textin' in the whole show
After station about 10 o'clock, just put my keypad on lock
I get a routine phone call from frisbee, checkin' out keepin' an eye out on the block
Go home go to my room
Listen to Skepta's new tune
Fall asleep
Lie on my bed
Fall asleep on the phone to some gash
Buduh be da buh be da bu dum
You wanna come and do what i wanna do
This is a rap tune, follow the rack heads (rack heads)
You know why we come to rock the beds
Neme neme neme now mnow mnow (Yeah)
Now mnow mnow (serious)
Serious
