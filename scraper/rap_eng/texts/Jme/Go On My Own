[Verse 1]
Of course itâ€™s good to have a team
It's easier to achieve your dreams
But don't forget you can do it by yourself
If you want something done you gotta do it yourself
If things were left down to me
There would be no gangs, no crews, no teams
And see what you can do by yourself
To get the job done you gotta do it yourself
I'm a total baddaman, independent
I don't have to rely on my friends
Cause sometimes they just wanna joke joke
Sit down get a drink and smoke smoke
I'm a natural baddaman, independent
I don't live off the hype from my ends
Cause they wanna beef and I wanna work work
I wanna make money, don't wanna merk merk

[Hook]
I speak, I speak
The truth, The truth
On the mic, On the mic
That's right, that's right
The Truth, the truth
I ain't, I ain't
Gonna lie, Gonna lie
That's why, that's why
You're born, you're born
You live, you live
You die
There's no space for wasting time
So I'll go on my own
I will go on my own
If no one's with me I will go on my own
I will go on my own
If no one's with me I will go on my own

[Verse 2]
To a certain degree
I agree with working solitairily
To show that you can do it by yourself
If you want something done, you've gotta do it yourself
Things are clearer to me
Can't you see, I'm spitting in HD
See what you can do by yourself
To get the job done you gotta do yourself
I'm a lyrical baddaman, I move solo
Sometimes you might see me with Joe though
Cause he is my real blood blood
Makes tunes grimier than mud mud
I'm an original baddaman, I move solo
And i've done bare tunes that you don't know
To find out you better back track track
4 mix tapes in ya' CD rack rack

[Hook]

I will go on my own
If no ones with me I will go on my own
I will go on my own
If no ones with me I will go on my own
If no ones with me I will go on my own
If no ones with me I will go on my own
