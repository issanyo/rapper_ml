[Intro]
Know what it is
Merky ACE
Tim and Barry TV
Right, let's get this popping, Tim
Listen
Alright, look

[Verse]
My uncles carry swams, not do fraud
I box boot and do sword
Probably robbed the guy you shot food for
Don't judge him, you'll get the same treatment
The edgy corners I'm knee-deep in
You'll be retreating when the sweets leaving
Out the chamber
[?] can hold 'bout three
From the bloodclart chest plate cave in
And we screeching, ergh
Heat in the summertime
And the other three seasons, greaze demons
Here to mek more money when my dargs dem need it
Connect try make the food under
Told him "put respect on my Tanitas"
Don's looking all Cat and Alfie
Bro's looking Sanjay and Ghita
Not the raw like Wesson's over
Put my trust in that special rover
Call me Recoba, I beat shots
I don't beatbox, man's been squeezing
Get the green light, I don't need reasons
No resolve, you'll be seasoned
No mild madras, man chicken tikk him
With jook-jook-jook
I wanna see lunch in his [?]
If you see me talking to tramps
I ain't giving no change
Swapped the swam for a big shank, shit
Now your boy's running on the mains
It's useless metal without no grains
Countless fuckery man's upkept
Numerous things I have obtained
Get round here
Drench man's skin, no Ice Bucket Challenge
When he's pronounced dead, man hip-hooray
Juice gon' spill, that is Kool-Aid
Things on me like
Couldn't give a shit what you say
Darg, I'm in the trenches dipping through lanes
Give a fuck about henchness, look at this blade
I'll be ripping through tendons, muscle and face
Fuck a wrestling entrance, he will glass-break
Headback buss
Give a fuck if I'm booked or not
I'll lock off this rave
Fly that bar, fling bottle grenades
Do the dirt I intended, then I remembered
The roads weren't for them but it's too late
Slumped on his doorstep at the front gate
Hop out the bush like "peek-a-boo", man shot Pikachu
[?] you
Hoping it jams? Well, fam, that's peak for you
Must can hold 'bout three while I take a douche
Blood pon foot but a man don't need no loubs
Fucked her face in and now she's being rude?
Couldn't give a shit what you say
Left you spreadeagled, didn't take K
Left you with semen, not no papes
I cannot wife her and I cannot stay
Forget sending, I'll bring a twenty like a Benson
Might just survive if you're Kenyan
The only reason he's still alive
'Cause the doctor done the electric chest ting
Tryna see his abdomen and intestines
What's my slogan? Must can get injury
From the bloodclart new roulette ting
.44 silver, not no .32 red
Can't talk your way out, I heard what you said
They say they're on ends, hiding in Kent
[?] one gyal, ain't paying no rent
All that smack gon' get them smoke
Man start fire, stay down and get choked
Two hands on the handle, frying like [?]
It didn't come with no instruction manual
Came with a cloud of smoke
Still flog weight in tinted cars
Stash food, tell feds it's not ours
All year round, wear Halloween masks
Lock off function; party; dance
Run man down and he left his Clarks
Sometimes tracksuit, more time suave
Getting it in from flats and bars
Till the money long like neck giraffe
Gyal give me neck like "oh my gosh"
Making sounds like gurg and glarg
[?] just like a red card
Like it's three normal for the first half
I ain't ever done a hard day's graft
Ain't ever looked back since my first half
I had Dutch in Persil bags
Parked off by my balls

[Outro]
Oi, Tim and Barry TV, one take
Real badman, know what it is
