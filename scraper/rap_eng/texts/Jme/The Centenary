[Verse - Toumi]
Name's Toumi
Fire breathing hell raising heathen
The demon butcher's cut from the belly of the behemoth
It's all cold and fly until we're in the Winter season, bitch, the fuck you think's an arctic falcon to a desert eagle?
It's evil
The type of shit that ain't allowed a sequel
If you see me spittin' fire then you know i brought the diesel
Think you're something special but your matter's only faecal fool
You're leaning on a pad and sitting next to you's an easel

You need more colour in your lines
Bro might start slipping if he thinks I'm scared of him
Man wanna battle me? I'mma take care of him
Crept on, Conan'd like the barbarian

I ain't a prince man I made some mischief
With Will that got me in brown like Harry
I'll light up your life like the match of the day 'fore I chip up to linacre road and eat gary

What?
You think coz I nearly died like 5 times that I'd knock that shit on the head?
Bitch talk, that lad and I'm no wimp fam
I ain't even going to quit AFTER I'm dead

Real big spliff when I blaze in my grave
Six deep, all pale and bony as fuck
Trippin balls with my Jaw half way across the cemetery goin hella white on the pills I just took

That's life. And I'm west. I bang loads of drugs but not ket
I know for a fact I rap well
But I won't
Say I'm the best 'til I'm best

Too many rappers say too many rappers til Toumi comes through with a tune, and gets hype

Imagine the shame of your fanbase sayin that you spit much worse than a guy that's not signed
My god (OH LAAAWWWDD)
What's that (THOSE BARS)
Those lines (KILL BEATS)
That rap (GO HARD)

I'll probably never play golf coz I go over the top with my pars
People believe you should keep it real but you don't wanna know of my past
Guarentee that'd make you sick to your stomach and you'd take your headphones off

So for now, I'mma stick to the easy listenin
Freestyle bars from the seat I'm sittin' in
Spend my time on a beat just killin' it
Smile wide bout the "peace" I'm livin' in

Because when I take my tongue from my cheek
The vibe of my life goes from peak to peak

And when I think of the guys that can't Rap
Mumblin into a microphone to get cash
And I see the people ratin them man as a class act
Fam I ain't gonna lie but I start to get mad

So I need to calm it all down, give me a second just to catch my breath
Perfect time to slip a pill in his drink
Take him outside and curb stomp his head

Toumi, you alright there man, you were in a world of your own?
Believe me, you don't wanna know, that crazy world I call home

And the lord of the land still wanna make me homeless and stress me out half to death
Once again I'm getting letters from his goons for nothing but daring to try and draw breath

I feel my cool is slipping
Just tryna maintain my health

So fuck the easy listening
There's shit to get off my chest

Whatcha know bout bein' the only coloured youth in all of your hood?
Watcha know about catchin beatings from people that don't like the way you look?
Watcha know bout hittin the gym at 14 like "fuck this, enough's enough"
Watcha know bout walking past, your old bullies quickly shut the fuck up

Whatchoo know bout mental health like
Anxiety and depression are cute but having to live as psychotic and scizophrenic's a tune you don't want to vibe to
Or want to live your life to
A tune you can't exactly rest your head and close your eyes to
A tune that the voices inside'll battle for your mind and a tune that you won't want to go on-
Line to voice your pride to

Ridiculous the we way we sickness as something less than afflicting and something cool to be bragged about to our friends

Don't cite your mental health as an excuse like it'll wash with me, I'll help you out but only if you help yourself as well

Well, well well, well I told you the bars got deeper, that was Monday, grab some wellies 'fore you step into the well

You ain't ready for the magma, massive Magmums. Straps and Johnny's, Lollies always got one on me
Case I need to buss or buss or get thirsty
Got me these worms by waking up early

Still here? Ain't bored to death yet? Halfway through and you ain't bored to death yet. I wonder how many more bars I'll have to pen before peers and friends consider me a vet' yeah

I'll do that
Shatter the fourth wall
Poke my head through and
Bang out my tunes

Like a 2 way mirror, I'm letting you all in
So It's only polite to smile and then wink

Back to Rap, you ain't ALL the spirit of Pac so how about getting a personality of your own
5 MCs at the top of my head who think they're king
But if my time in this city's tought me one thing, it's that we DON'T snitch, I throw shade, and wait for the bait to be taken, no need to drop names I only spit flames so stay in your lane or fall straight from grace
I'll switch place with a "Top Tier" MC quicker than the MC could attempt to save face
So keep to creepin, preein, keeping tabs and waiting for the day that I slip up
It ain't gonna come, run
Fuck out my sight
How you scared of hell when it's earth that's alight?

Burned and it's like
Cursed after night
Learned how to spite
Murder and vice

I promise for every single second I'm in the game that you could never ever say I'm the worst on the mic/

Why chat shit? You know, I'm far from it
By chance if you start to go plotting
My man's whip might bypass pigs
Might find out why you hit the car bonnet (4:07)

Back to life/
Motherfucking ressurection and there's plenty of vitality in this vessel of mine
I've been writing this for nearly a year and times change so it's time to make ammendments to a few earlier lines like

What?
I've got a kid on the way so since I've gone and made someone preg
Everything considered I don't plan on getting withered but I've gone and knocked all that on the head

Fuck that shit, can't blaze every day
Shit's weak, won't fail my daughter or son
Can't stumble any more, stepping up and I'm forever ready even when I had to face the kid's mum I

Got a full time job, was ready to get together for the sake of the baby, I helped when she stressed

Trying my best to keep our heads level, be present but appaz I'm "only in it for the sex"

Enough's enough now I'mma have to bite my tongue for her or end up mental again or even a black widower

Back to back on every one of these tracks
I've spat flames and facts, still I'm accused of being fake but
If I rapped in me accent twenty four seven, not a fucker would understand a single word that I say

I got lyrics for days, weeks, months, years, enough to last me til the day I die and and after that

I call this rap The Centenary coz there's a hundred bars worth of verse packed into the one track

No hook, no chorus, interlude, filler, skit or anything that could make this less than what it is;

A testament to dedication, blood sweat tears and all the evidence you need that I'm never scared to commit

A letter to you from Toumi, I've found my passion, it's rapping, still got news for anyone who's convinced they could hack a send...

That's all my shit out the way, still here but here's where this ends, I'll catch you all later, peace out, I'm off to buy a new pen
