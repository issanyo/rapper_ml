[Verse 1]
Right, I step foot in the dance
I clock two girls look, I glance
Over to behind the stage, I look for the promoter
For the Ps for the booking
Then I buss a little dance
A little 1-2 skank, nothing advanced
See, I'm chuffed, cause I got the P for the booking
I make my way to the bar
Then I pull out the drink tokens
I see someone approaching
It's the same two girls that I clocked
Earlier, all smiling and smoking
I could've easily paid with the tokens
But I wanted to flex like a baiders
So I spent all my rave money
And now I can't afford my new trainers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
See, I don't usually drink
So I don't usually get like this
And I ain't even been onstage yet
And I'm already tipsy-ish
I swear I can hear Trim
Yeah, that's Trim, yeah, it is
He's saying "come to the front of the stage"
But I'm drunk with these chicks
I made it to the front in time
I got a few reloads spitting my rhymes
I ain't gonna lie, I forgot a few lines
But nobody noticed, though, pure vibes
At the end of the set
I put the mic down by the decks
I stepped foot off the stage
And the same two girls come right in my face

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So I stood there
With a big wasted smile on my face
I'm waiting for the girls to make the first move
I've still got a smile on my face
Time was ticking
And my smile was wearing thin
They was staring like they're imagining me
Without the clothes that I'm in
Finally
The one with the zampers gave me her phone
Told me to put my number inside
Said she would call me cause she had to go
I gave her back her phone
And she gave me my wallet, and I was like rah
Still don't know how she got it
I must've left it at the bar, I'm drunk
