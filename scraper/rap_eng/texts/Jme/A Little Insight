[Intro]
Jme, absolute badda man skank
Jme productions (J-m-e)
Hold tight Plastician, hold tight Rapid yeah
Hold tight Footsie yeah, all the producers (on the computer bruv)
Jump on the PC, jump on the Mac (serious)

[Verse 1]
Bruv, I heard your single, it was lame
You need to go and seek some advice
I'm original, you are the same
But take out the O-R-I
Boy Better Know, in this scene
We are the sprayers, we are the kings
You really want to sound mean
But you're just saying bare tings
Nobody cares what you say on the mic
It takes me an hour to pick out a word
Dem way dere, I ain't gonna lie
Listening to you is like doing a bird
It's all too much, it hurts my head
More time, I just blank it out
It's kinda unfair to get
A big lecture from an Air Cadet
Man like you will never get
Nowhere, trust me, yeah, forget
Music, bruv, you're an airbag
Air on toast, you're air baguettes
Don't you get it? You're so airy
No wonder you got Nike Air creps
You're air kebab, air when I'm here
I don't wanna hear your air in my ear

[Break]
Serious, hold tight all the real skengman producers out there
Making the real beats yeah
Hold tight Youngblood, hold tight Spyder
Hold tight Wiley yeah, Terror Danjah, Skepta
Yeah, serious, hold tight Professor, serious

[Verse 2]
I would love to be a badman
But I ain't got time
Bruv, I'm in the studio like eight hours a day
So I ain't got no time to play
Like I said, I ain't got time
I'm hustling my mixtape grind
There's only 24 hours a day
I sleep eight of them hours away
From 3 to 11, I'm sleeping
From 12 till 1, eating
Unless I've got uni
If not then these are the targets I'm meeting
From 1 till 5
Chasing up my dough, trust, it's not the lick
Record shops, distributors, blud
Them goons ain't paying up shit
Studio from 6 till 2
You know this shit's all true
I stay at studio longer
When I'm closer to the date my mixtape's due
But there's still some guys in the scene
Who believe that they've got the right
To phone my phone and ask me
For tunes at all times of the night

[Outro]
Everybody knows!
Hold tight the real producers yeah, jump on their computer
Hold tight Benga, hold tight Loefah
The digital mystics yeah, dubstep massive
Hold tight the Grime Reaper, serious, serious
