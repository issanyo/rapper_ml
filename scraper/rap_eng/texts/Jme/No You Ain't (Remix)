[Chorus: Jme]
Sick? No you ain't!
Coming to the rave with a stick? No you ain't!
Top three? No you ain't!
Leveling up with me? No you ain't!
Brave? No you ain't!
Getting reloads on stage? No you ain't!
Grime? No you ain't!
Represent all of the time? No, safe!
Sick? No you ain't!
Coming to the rave with a stick? No you ain't!
Top three? No you ain't!
Leveling up with me? No you ain't!
Brave? No you ain't!
Getting reloads on stage? No you ain't!
Grime? No you ain't!
Represent all of the time? No!

[Verse 1: Kemba]
Kemba from the Bronx, yeah
I done fed the wolves, I protect the wool, this is Noah's ark, yeah
Everything in two's, ain't no one on ones, bitch I'm one of one, yeah
Soon as things star pickin' up, old heads start switchin' up
You ain't really that nigga, huh?
I was microwavin' ravioli, now I'm covered in the sauce
I done went from ridin' charter buses, now the buzz is off the charts
You distracted by a Patek, it's apparent, I'm the one to watch
Doc told me I'd be lucky if I talked
Niggas tried to put a muzzle on the dog, I'm the underdog
I was lookin' up addresses, niggas livin' reckless on the Forbes
Eviction notice, marshals tappin' on the door
I was marchin' with the masses for the poor
NYPD had us scattered through the Bronx
Parted ways they don't even aim nigga John Wayne, niggas fastest with the draw
Judas hatin' couldn't even face him, hang me backwards on the cross
Niggas lie, women lie, numbers lie, got your boy aggravated
Jury duty, "Sorry, I don't trust cops", courthouse activated
Y'all ain't about nothin', life story written by Larry David
Jaw wired, I survived, I can live through anything if Magic made it

[Chorus: Jme]
Sick? No you ain't!
Coming to the rave with a stick? No you ain't!
Top three? No you ain't!
Leveling up with me? No you ain't!
Brave? No you ain't!
Getting reloads on stage? No you ain't!
Grime? No you ain't!
Represent all of the time? No, safe!
Sick? No you ain't!
Coming to the rave with a stick? No you ain't!
Top three? No you ain't!
Leveling up with me? No you ain't!
Brave? No you ain't!
Getting reloads on stage? No you ain't!
Grime? No you ain't!
Represent all of the time? No!

[Verse 2: Kemba]
I've been livin' in Hunts Point since '99
Got jumped on Spofford and Bryant
Then woke up to them shot down like "rise and shine"
I ain't wish it but God is God Niggas dyin' on either side off shots fired
Or it's Mickey D's or it's Crown Fried
Or it's Papa John's, that's by design, nigga oh no
I was chirpin', I couldn't afford phones
I was talkin' to niggas in Morse code
I don't give a fuck about award shows
We was dodgin' MEs in a war zone
Born piss poor broke, we ain't even have a crib to foreclose
Livin' one pair kicks, four clothes
How my mama ever did it? Lord knows

[Chorus: Jme]
Sick? No you ain't!
Coming to the rave with a stick? No you ain't!
Top three? No you ain't!
Leveling up with me? No you ain't!
Brave? No you ain't!
Getting reloads on stage? No you ain't!
Grime? No you ain't!
Represent all of the time? No, safe!
Sick? No you ain't!
Coming to the rave with a stick? No you ain't!
Top three? No you ain't!
Leveling up with me? No you ain't!
Brave? No you ain't!
Getting reloads on stage? No you ain't!
Grime? No you ain't!
Represent all of the time? No!
