[Intro: KSI]
Got rocks on my wrist, that shit you can't resist
Cash flow greater than the haters hating on my jizz
Riding in your face, looking like I found a damn genie
Wiling in my Lamborghini

[Hook: KSI]
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini

[Verse 1: KSI]
Been in the game since Namco oh
Bring it back, I'm fully gassed, yo
Vroom, vroom, in my brand new Lambo
Juiced up, and I don't give a damn, yo
Going 120, and that's my slowest
On a one-way lane, like Lois
Who's that? Superman's bitch
Wanna see what happens when I touch the Superman switch?
Ride with more peers than Morgan, what's up
Drive past vloggers that are walking
I taunt them, Matt Lees, can you see me?
Wiling in my Lamborghini

[Hook: KSI]
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini, yeah
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini

[Verse 2: P Money]
Oh yeah
I be at home on the Xbox
Lord of the Mics in the background, slewing MCs with dreadlocks
Snap that party, told this girl "come round"
Chick's long-tempered but her head top, whoah
She goes hard till my head drops, I
It's all eyes when we connect, I
Doggystyle and a Playboy bunny from downstairs, upstairs
Sound like a pet shop
Guys wanna hype on man
Call KSI, come yours and I'll put you in a headlock
I've been around since CoD 4
Search and Destroy hardcore G3 with a red dot
Haters get treated like a ho
You can tell them suck my dick and get lost
Paparazzi wanna take pics when I'm out with my son
You can all get headshots
This flow's like Formula One
Cause I use  the track like DRS
Quickly boosting the PRS
She's going ape when I beat her chest
Bro, it's mad
You can tell Rihanna come see me
Might have to speed dial in that genie
JJ, lend me the Lamborghini

[Hook: KSI]
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini, yeah
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini

[Verse 3: KSI]
When my Lambo on the track,  fall back
When I'm riding at speed, get that neck crack, oh
Blazing on the engine, everybody looking back
Like I'm shooting, gratata, got them going "fuck that"
Raise the fucking doors, I said make it look
Like a fucking eagle, like I'm starting wars
Dictating with my V12 deagle, speeds ain't even legal
Scaring people, we ain't equal
Danny Glover ain't got shit on my motherfucking lethal weapon
Armageddon sounding when the man arrives
When we hype I come alive, like a 5 Alive
On the drive 21 years, smashing up the scene
And I keep on winning, like I'm Mr Charlie Sheen

[Hook: KSI]
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini
