[Intro]
Look after your body…(yes)
U only get ONE body..
Without that body, you're NOBODY…
EVERYBODY listen to me..
Look after your body..

[Verse 1]
It seems like nobody cares
How their body will be in five years
Okay now blowing smoke in the air
But cancer doesn't have an antidote so..
Stop takin' life for a joke (no joke)
I've had it up to here
Kids smoking in their pre-school years
Cause of the pressure they get from their peers
Some of the kids have the nerve
To stop me and ask do I get served
I'mma teach dem a lesson..
Next kid to ask me to get served
I'mma take his 2 quid

[Hook]
Everybody please listen to me and look after your body
If not, u might end up a dead body..
Cuz all u wanna do is
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u wanna do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u ever do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u wanna do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk

[Verse 2]
Listen up..
All the guys that think they can live off them greasy fries
They ain't potatoes, that's LIES!
Take away and junk food's bad for you heart
I don't care if you're skinny from the start
Them fries will leave you SUPERSIZED
Junk food looks good to the eyes
But it don't look good on the thighs
If your tummy's in a funny mood
Go home and have some mummy's food
That way you know what you're eatin'
Unless mum works in burger king

[Hook]
Everybody please listen to me and look after your body
If not, u might end up a dead body..
Cuz all u wanna do is
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u wanna do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u ever do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u wanna do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk

[Verse 3]
Listen up..
All the people that are out there drinkin' BUBBLY
When really they're supposed to be
Buyin' bread and pampers
Instead they're buyin' CHAMPERS
Waving drunk and disorderly
And two years down the line
Their liver's not workin properly
Drinkin' gives you confidence
It's not a co-incidence
Your prospects don't look promising
Cause can't stop yourself from vomitin'

[Hook]
Everybody please listen to me and look after your body
If not, u might end up a dead body..
Cuz all u wanna do is
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u wann do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u ever do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk
All u wanna do is..
Eat junk
Smoke skunk
Get drunk

[Outro]
That’s right…
Look after your body…
I know you've all got rottin teeth..
Achin joints..
Aches and pains..
Asthma..
Stomach aches..
