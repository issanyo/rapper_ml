[Hook: C4]
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back around, here we go
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back around

[Verse 1: C4]
It goes down when it goes round
It goes down when it goes round
But you can't run cause you're gonna get found
But you can't hide cause you're gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna
It goes down when it goes round
It goes down when it goes round
But you can't run cause you're gonna get found
But you can't hide cause you're gonna get found out
So d-d-don't do this
Next time, bring what you wanna move with
Long time, man, I stopped doing stupidness
So I get props from doing music
Even Twitter knows that I do this
First MC from Brum with a blue tick
Long time, man, I stopped moving left
Cause it won't [?]

[Hook: C4]
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back around, here we go
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back around

[Verse 2: Jme]
Serious! Y-you know that
Man like Jme came from poverty
Trust me, he don't wanna go back
So he comes around tryna make a pound
There ain't one man he would hold back
About 13 features in six weeks
Trust me, let the workrate show that
I'm still here now, didn't desert the sound
Boy Better Know T-shirt, fold that
With the black and green, I was killing the scene
On a tropical T-shirt throwback
Look for it now and it can't be found
Keep working away, cut no slack
Gotta produce the beat or write a 16
So the yard and the car, I can own that
When it comes around, when it comes around, when it comes around

[Hook: C4]
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back around, here we go
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back
When it comes around it will go back around

[Bridge: C4]
I was gonna put a verse here
Put a verse but it will go back
I was gonna put a verse here
Put a verse but it will go back
I was gonna put a verse here
Put a verse but it will go back
I was gonna put a verse here
Put a-
It will go back
Round, round
It will go back
Round, round
It will go back
Round, round
It will go back
Round, round
It will go back round
Go back round
It will go back round
Go back round

[Hook: C4]
Go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back around
I said that it will go back
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back when it comes around
It will go back around
