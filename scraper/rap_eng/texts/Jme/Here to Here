[Verse 1: Blacks]
They wanna book me, they can't afford me
When I touch Barbie, I'm so naughty
[?] tracky, I look so sporty
Been 120 and sharkers bay
Lalala, what more can I say?
Life ain't real, more like a dream
Jump in a sauna, let off steam
Won't get out till I feel all clean
Jump on the wave or get left
If you can't swim, that's your death
Jaw's all swinging like barley and meth
OMG, look at this mess
Don't want mandy, no, I'm blessed
I've got cheese and Hennessy water
I've got cheese and Hennessy water
Still on a high, won't calm down
Don't ever think man's watered down
It's a mad ting when my team come round
Youts moving nervous, shaking the ground
You're just pissed cuh I'm the talk of the town
Thinking "how did he turn this round?"
Still a badboy, I've never been a clown
Still a badboy, I've never been a clown

[Hook]
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
Not just England, I'm talking overseas
Haters wanna hate but that's the industry
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
Not just England, I'm talking overseas
Haters wanna hate but that's the industry

[Verse 2: Jme]
I'm independent, I didn't sign no contract
Me? I'm still pay as you go
So call me play cause I'm killing off bare MCs
I just spray as you know
Like an AK with a fully-loaded magazine
I stay on the road
All night and day, I do more than enough for the scene
They should rename reload to Jme
Jump on the riddim, get a Jme
Run up in the rave, get a Jme
If I ain't there, tell the DJ
Fam, jack that tune and play Jme
Jump on the riddim, get a Jme
Run up in the rave, get a Jme
If I ain't there, tell the DJ
Fam, jack that tune and play OGz
You can't fail
These riddims send man off the rails
Dem ones, feel it in your spine
Like scratching a blackboard with your nails
Dem ones, bare man wanna chat online
When they see me, act like girls
Jme, BBK, obviously
Dun know, the name rings bells

[Hook]
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
Not just England, I'm talking overseas
Haters wanna hate but that's the industry
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
Not just England, I'm talking overseas
Haters wanna hate but that's the industry

[Verse 3: Durrty Goodz]
I say fuck these industry niggas
That show no love for real spitters on the block
They be shitting their drawers when they see me on the spot
Henney on the rocks, gyal dem a penny
Got man on the lock, on telly and I'm hot
Big arse girls with flat bellies want the wok
So I put 'em to sleep cuh my semi's gonna pop
When I draw, I'm killing 'em
Out skilling 'em, [?] bred room for filling 'em
Drilling 'em, going on militant
Till they wanna suck my cinnamon
Skets looking for the cheque get minimum
I get maximum respect delivering
Road know I'm on the way to a million
They're like "how'd you get him all over the riddim
When he's so elusive, exclusive
New with the bar?" Cuh we do this
I'm industry nuisance, I love when they put in their two pence
And they don't wanna make no movements
But they're playing my blueprints
What I'm saying sounds like I chew mints, it's incredible
Even credible rappers are now edible
Durrty Goodz is a bloodclart general

[Hook]
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
Not just England, I'm talking overseas
Haters wanna hate but that's the industry
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
My name rings bells from here to here, you see
Not just England, I'm talking overseas
Haters wanna hate but that's the industry
