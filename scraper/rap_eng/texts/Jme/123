[Intro]
You don't have to reach for the sky

[Hook]
One, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
Yeah like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
Serious

[Verse 1]
I'm Jamie, I'm the MC
Everybody wants to be one
It's easy for me to MC
But it's not the same for everyone
And just 'cos you see me MC
Don't think that you can be one
Bruv your swag, laters, bless
Safe, bye, gwan
I won't clash none of these MC's
Before we start I've already won
This is grime, it's not Rap
JME, not Raekwon
Dun know the myspace dot com forward slash
Aaron B.B.R 1
I'm like Neo from the matrix
But in the music 'cos I am the one

[Hook]
One, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
Yeah like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
Serious

[Verse 2]
I made a tune called "Serious"
And it's about not having a two two
'Cos im individual
Not 'cos I'm scared like a girl in a tutu
I shoulda won the Grime Nobel Peace award
Like Desmond Tutu
See I stayed in school, got my degree
Even if I get a two two
I've done it, time waits for no one
This year I was two too
My dad wants me to do a Masters'
And my mum wants me to too
They want me to do everything
I bet they want me to climb Timbuktu too
But I'm just gonna do music
Beyond 2002 two

[Hook]
One, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
Yeah like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
Serious

[Verse 3]
If I get famous, you'll still see me
I go forward right by three, three, three
I'm Jamie, don't watch J-M-E
I do what I want, I'm free free free
Wiley's my bredrin, he's got an album
Gave it to me for free free free
Put it in my PC, track sixteen
When it got to 3 3 3
I got my lyric book, started barsing
Rhythm set my mind free free free
I'm writing alot, unlikely to stop
Look at the clock blud it's three, three, three
Gonna write more, that's what I'm here for
Give it to you lot for free free free
I'm an angel, I cut the devil in half
I cut him down to three, three, three

[Hook]
One, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
Yeah like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
Serious

[Outro]
One, two, three
Just like one, two, three

Yeah like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
Just like one, two, three
It's easy like one, two, three
