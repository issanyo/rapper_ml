[Hook]
I got money on my brain
You say you make it rain
But I fucking flood the place
Cause I got money on my brain, yeah

[Verse 1]
Where you going?
If I ain't got P, it's annoying
On balance, it's like a kick in the groin
Shower man down with bare pound coins
I send you an invoice
Cash or bank transfer, your choice
I strictly do grime all of the time
Them other guys? Moist
Call me Mr
Too real for the average listener
Or call me JmeBBK, tongue twister
You get the gyst
Cash in the bank, Casio on the wrist
I strictly do grime all of the time
Them other guys? Pissed

[Hook]
I got money on my brain
You say you make it rain
But I fucking flood the place
Cause I got money on my brain, yeah

[Verse 2]
What you saying?
You know I don't spend P in vain
When I go cash point, I ain't playing
Anything before the comma can stay in
I'll make a likkle withdrawal
I make money, yeah, but I want more
I strictly do grime all of the time
Them other guys? Poor
Cash ISA
Every year, I'm five bags nicer
I can't forget PPL or PRS either
You get my point
Bare Ps and my account ain't joint
I strictly do grime all of the time
Them other guys? Void

[Hook]
I got money on my brain
You say you make it rain
But I fucking flood the place
Cause I got money on my brain, yeah

[Verse 3]
What you doing?
I'm feeding my family, why are you screwing?
On top of the game, pissing and pooing
While you're there bubblegum chewing
Don't watch what I do
I don't buy stupid shit like you
I strictly do grime all of the time
Them other guys? Poo
I walked in Prada, I walked straight out
Walked in Louis and I walked straight out
Walked in Versace, walked straight out
Got bare P but I don't buy nuttin'
Walked in Gucci, I walked straight out
Walked in Harrods and I walked straight out
Walked in Rolex, walked straight out
Got bare P but I don't buy nuttin'

[Hook]
I got money on my brain
You say you make it rain
But I fucking flood the place
Cause I got money on my brain, yeah
