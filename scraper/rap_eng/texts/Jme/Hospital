[Intro: Jme]
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)

[Verse 1: Jme]
Nope, stay where you are
See how I flow when I'm spraying a bar?
Hospital what? Hospital where?
All you're gonna get is music around here
Right, you're not ill, so just chill
You need good music, yeah, not a pill
Dance, move your feet, move your heels
Remember, you're only as young as you feel
What are you waiting for?
Get on the dancefloor
Music's our only cure
Boy Better Know

[Hook]
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)

[Verse 2: Shorty]
No, I ain't taking you nowhere
Just listen to my bad boy flow, yeah
All you need is a little bit of bass, trust
You'll be blessed for the whole year
Did you say medication? Don't go there
This vibe'll make your head feel so clear
The next thing you think about going to the doctor's
Remember Boy Better Know's here

[Verse 3: Frisco]
You're not sick in the head
Nah man, you don't really need a hospital bed
All you really need is a kick and a hi-hat
With a snare and a likkle bass and treb
Face it, yeah, it's amazing bless
If you can't dance, try do a basic step
And if you wanna try something new then try me
And get hooked on M-U-S-I-C
It's lively
I've got the rest of the mandem beside me
And if you're fake then you get fished out like a Pisces
Call me Dr. Fris, I'm about, come find me

[Hook]
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)

[Verse 4: Skepta]
You wanna go to the hospital? That's Skepta's world
You better get some antiseptic gel
Cause everybody went in fine, they spent two weeks there
Now everybody's effed as well
Blud, you won't hack it
Any little bit of backchat, they don't have it
I spent 15 weeks in a straight jacket
You ain't seen nuttin' yet, how much you wanna bet?
Famalam, you're blessed
Forget a cigarette, you're blessed
You don't know a thing about stress, you're blessed
You couldn't live a day in my creps, you're blessed
Jam, chat to them for a sec

[Verse 5: Jammer]
None of you don't need no penicillin
It's Dr. Murkle over the riddim
Club full of women
If your bredrin's sick, just bring him
I'm the surgeon so I keep swinging
Forget the sirens and the bells ringing
You don't need to go the hospital, fam
Listen to the beats, MCing and singing

[Hook]
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)
Take me to the (hospital)
