[Verse 1: Wiley]
Boy, yo
Let's talk about the manor
Where everybody's on a hype and life is hard
I do music put my all in
You don't see me fake balling
Pick a wife and then you fall in love
And I'm not a fall in love, so I'm not one to fall in love
I can make the call for love
The street calls me when I'm in my house
I'm going out, I can't stay in
Find a rave, find my way in, roll about
I've got the choongest ting
Honey roast, [?]
Rollercoast
Roll deep just got a record deal
Let's have a toast
Me, I'm non-exclusive I'm just, biding my time
I walk where still waters glide
I'll take your girl, for a ride, driving through the ends
Duck down girl, you've gotta hide
If you get seen there'll be a lot of explaining to do tonight
So play your cards right 'cause getting caught out, that's not the one
Is he the one for you, just ask yourself if I could be the one
I'll show you the Miami sun, leave your boy tell him it's done
I'm kinda psychic, I see me and you sitting in the sun
Yeah

[Chorus: Donae'O]
We gotta keep it moving (uh)
'Cause life waits for no one
So it's best we do what we gotta do
We gotta keep it moving (uh)
'Cause life waits for no one
So it's best we do what we gotta do
Ay yeah, oh

[Verse 2: Donae'O]
Let it be known we rode through frozen estates (uh)
A little younger so old through the gates (yeah)
There's no hope (bleh)
And little girls act like hoes with they mates (you know)
Listen little girl, don't be a bate (uh)
You a princess
I been the best, ain't no open debates (yeah)
Love yourself babe, don't open the safe
I know it's hard to escape (uh)
Quite hard to see my heart in you babe
The faith is gotta be within you don't ask for the faith (gotta get it)
And we should all know better but, we don't (yeah)
Wanna make the money cash casino (ching)
See those dreams? We can be those (yeah)
It ain't that hard (nope)
Look at someone else's pain
See we ain't that scarred (yeah)
I'm a black man and proud of it
Take that charge (yeah)
See my life has got more worth than a Maybach car, uh
Thursday I say a pray to the Lord
So he can help me use my pen and stay away from the sword

[Chorus: Donae'O]
We gotta keep it moving (uh)
'Cause life waits for no one
So it's best we do what we gotta do
We gotta keep it moving (uh)
'Cause life waits for no one
So it's best we do what we gotta do
Ay yeah, oh

[Verse 3: Jme]
Serious, Jme
Alright
Before man just collaborate
They just wanna squabble
Playing stupid games like bubble and bobble
UK man, you understand
United we stand, divided we wobble (stick together)
But I ain't on no Samaritan shit
So don't think I won't slap you in the chops
'Round my ends, there's no snap or [?] bredrin
There's just constant serial killings (hot)
Setting up man for material things
All five man eating off the same plate, and
All five cars with the same plates
If that rings bells we're from the same place
And I'm not tryna preach to the peeps on the streets
But man that are smart take my lyrics to heart
And when shit hits the fan remember I said it from the start

[Chorus: Donae'O]
We gotta keep it moving (uh)
'Cause life waits for no one
So it's best we do what we gotta do
We gotta keep it moving (uh)
'Cause life waits for no one
So it's best we do what we gotta do
Ay yeah
We gotta keep it moving (uh)
'Cause life waits for no one
So it's best we do what we gotta do
We gotta keep it moving (uh)
'Cause life waits for no one
So it's best we do what we gotta do
Ay yeah, oh
