[Verse 1: Kano]
Don't hate me cause I hustle hard
Took a back seat, yeah I'm Rosa Parks
Now I'm on a mission like Katy, fuck that, Tom Cruise
I'm so wavy, call a man monsoon
See me in the club, champagne, pop that
Ace, I'm a king, call that pontoon
Beat's so cold, maybe I should get Double on it
I should get Double on it (bluku)
Ruffneck, don't make me get stubble on it
Cut cheques, don't make me get Russell on it
Old school, don't make me get pukka on it
Black man's radio, don't get me Chris Tucker on it
Can't touch the swagger, MC Hammer on it
So much plaques like I'm Westlife, nigga
But they say Dolce & Gobbana on it

[Verse 2: Lady Leshurr]
Don't hate Lesh cause my rhymes are hard
Roley on my wrist now that times are hard
I've got lyrics for the clubs, always by the bar
[?]
Trust, I stay in designer garms
Your girl gets tapped like a nice car
Yeah, tap tap tap tap tap, she's a tapper
Gyal a get folded like a bandana
But I don't care, take the piss out of my bladder
Standing ovation, her face is a clapper like
(Knock knock knock knock knock) she's a clappers
So don't blame me for it
Blam, blam, I shoulda got Jme on it

[Hook: Kano]
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy

[Verse 3: Jme]
Fam, man's high quality, man's WAV-y
You man bounce like an MP3
But us man, we're 24-bit AIFF-y
You and your crew are low bitratey
Bitratey
See me online, yeah, I smile in my avi
Jump in the whip and the iPhone will connect
To the iDrive cause man's tech-savvy
Please remember, if you diss a member
Of my crew, yeah, any of us
I will dismember you and bury the parts
And then disappear on the ferry to France
Durag from day, yeah, I'm on a braze ting
'Nough man must've thought I was on a waves ting
But if I cut my hair now, rudeboy
It will make headlines like durag strings

[Verse 4: D Double E]
Like bisto, everything's crazy, I'm feeling wavy, man
The way I'm wavy, you think I'm a crazy man
I'm feeling like there's nothing that can phase me
If I fall, somebody save me, I'll reward you for your bravery
Cause, cause I don't wanna look silly in front of this lady
I'm tryna draw her but she's acting shady, is it because I'm wavy? Maybe
Is it because I'm smelling all hazy? Eyes in a slit like a Chinese baby
Red, and they're moving lazy, I'm wavy, man

[Hook: Kano]
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy

[Verse 5: Sway]
Back up on the wave, it's Super Swah
'Bout to take over again
[?] the sounds of a cool guitar
No Liv but I'm rolling with Kane
And we're running these clubs like Lumina
On a different high like "guten tag"
Came face-to-face with Jupiter
And he was looking at me like "now you the star"
Man don't know me, [?]
I cop cop cop, man, I'm Axel Foley
If it ain't about cash, don't phone me
Gotta hand out [?] to catch Joe Kony
Deliverance, you could call me [?]
You could call me the pastor too
Cause I've been acting nuts from Adam
I should get a BAFTA too
Underground but I never catch the Tube
Back on YouTube, I'm back with Tubes
I'm going on cold rappers are going on Twitter
So the only thing they're getting is an attitude
Funny how they call me Derek
Cause I smacked it then I spat at you
Plus I used to rock that
Union Jack bandana too

[Hook: Kano]
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
I'm wavy, I'm, I'm, I'm wavy
