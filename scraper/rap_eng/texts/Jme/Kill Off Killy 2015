[Intro]
You get, you get
You get, you get
Kill Off Killy, I said Kill Off Killy
President T, get Kill Off Killy
Please, don't mention T on the wing
If you're not down with Kill Off Killy
Test Prez T, get Kill Off Killy
Blud, don't mention Stranger Returns

[Verse 1]
Did you know I'm the real ordeal
When I roll with a dealer?
This is so old school
You would've thought I was in Fila
Don't talk to feds, never been a squealer
I said talk to me, bro
They don't wanna talk to me, bro
Somebody bark two shots
Now they wanna talk to a pro
I don't wanna send for the cosh or crow
I was like "talk to my flow"
There's not a guy in Britain with this
I said, there's not a guy in Britain with that
"Prez, how you gonna bury that chat?"
Trust me, when I see one of these online Gs
You'll be like "did you bury that gat?"

[Hook]
Kill Off Killy, I said Kill Off Killy
President T, get Kill Off Killy
Please, don't mention T on the wing
If you're not down with Kill Off Killy
Test Prez T, get Kill Off Killy
Blud, don't mention Stranger Returns
If you're not Kill Off Killy

[Verse 2]
I'mma say it out straight
See this life? It's not what it seems
Somebody asked me why I don't get no dreams
Go against man like President?
You better back those greens
See me with followers, might see me with fiends
I was the Formula 1 without the teams
Kill Off Killy
I will die by any means
And believe I won't make any mess
And I apologise to any other mic man
If I brought any stress
They were like, they were like "Prez, are you blessed?"
I was like "what should I believe in?
Jesus Christ and my vest"

[Hook]
Kill Off Killy, I said Kill Off Killy
President T, get Kill Off Killy
Please, don't mention T on the wing
If you're not down with Kill Off Killy
Test Prez T, get Kill Off Killy
Blud, don't mention Stranger Returns
If you're not Kill Off Killy

[Verse 3]
Prez, what's it gonna be? Him or me?
What's it gonna be? Him or us?
Can't see loyalty without the trust
Kill Off Killy came back, that was a must
Everybody say boom, cause it won't be a buss
And if grime was a pizza I'd be like deep pan
But it won't be a crust
There's not an MC that could get to my point of time
What you know about blood without the line?
Man wanna talk all bright, you would've thought
He drank Sprite without the lime
I said there's not an MC that could shorten my life
Big in Fife

[Hook]
Kill Off Killy, I said Kill Off Killy
President T, get Kill Off Killy
Please, don't mention T on the wing
If you're not down with Kill Off Killy
Test Prez T, get Kill Off Killy
Blud, don't mention Stranger Returns
If you're not Kill Off Killy

[Hook]
Kill Off Killy, I said Kill Off Killy
President T, get Kill Off Killy
Please, don't mention T on the wing
If you're not down with Kill Off Killy
Test Prez T, get Kill Off Killy
Blud, don't mention Stranger Returns

[Outro]
You get, you get
