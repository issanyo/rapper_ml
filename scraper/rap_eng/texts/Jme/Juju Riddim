Jujujuju [x8]

I am the juju man
Run your mouth I raise up my juju hand
Hold tight my juju fam, there's juju airs and juju san
You better run fast if I try throw water on you from my juju can
To take over the whole world right now, that's my juju plan
Don't try cuss, I'll make a circle with juju dust
Call it a juju ring, I start speaking a whole next juju ting
(Hmm hmm... [?])
Jme that's me, I'm the juju king

2 stripes, 2 stripes on ma cheeks with the white paint now I gotta juju face
You don't know what chemicals I mixed in to my juju paint
Hard black African rude blood running straight through my blue veins
You better move when you see me draw for my juju cane
Don't diss man, I'll make a circle with juju sand
Call it a juju ring, I start speaking a whole next juju ting
(Hmm hmm... [?])
Jme that's me, I'm the juju king

Jujujuju [x8]

If you want me to spare your life hmm, bring me a sacrifice, yes
Not a head of a pig, no
This ain't lord of the flies (hmm)
This is JME, for your sacrifice...
Bring me KFC (yes)
And a small large fries (hmm)
Don't call my name, make a circle with juju flame
Call it a juju ring, I start speaking a whole next juju ting
(Hmm hmm... [?])
Jme that's me, I'm the juju king
