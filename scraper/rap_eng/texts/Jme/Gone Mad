[Verse 1: Blay Vision]
This world's so lost
So many pricks on the road, I feel like I'm doubting God
You can join the army at sixteen but can't buy COD
It's like I'm livin' in backwards times, nobody's on job
I told mandem don't watch my steedz
Cah' manaman's gone
Do you think I'm sittin' here waiting for life, do you know what I'm on?
I smoke weed, cah speaking to normal
Bruddahs is overly long
There's no unity in north, don't bore me with get along songs
I might sound anti but man I ain't wrong, no

[Hook: Blay Vision]
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone

[Verse 2: Jme]
I'm vexed
Feds drive bait on their mobile phone but nobody checks
You can't watch porn at sixteen but you can have sex
Everybody is a DJ now, when they never had decks
Should really call it a music jockey, but MJ's dead
School kids meaning a whole next ting when they talk bout chef
Man are in jail for a plant when the government profit off death
I'm a MC but maybe I should've been a MP instead
'Cause all of these lot don't make sense, no

[Hook: Blay Vision]
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone

[Verse 3: Blay Vision]
I tell 'em again we all have gone mad
Marijuana is banned, but cigarettes cajj
I've seen man get bun for less than a gram
It's mad cah' that gun should've never got here from ___
School kids in class just buckin' them xans
I can't blame 'em, the shit that they teach can send a man 'Dam
'Does nobody read what 'dem man are teachin', or was that the plan?
According to history, we started as slaves, family, it's a sham

[Hook: Blay Vision]
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone

[Bridge: Blay Vision]
Told 'em again, yeah
I told 'em before and I told 'em again
Said I told 'em before and I told 'em again
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone

[Hook: Blay Vision]
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone mad
Everyone's gone mad, everyone's gone
