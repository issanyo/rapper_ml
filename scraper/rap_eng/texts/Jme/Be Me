What's gwarning fam
Bare rats, cats, trying to bite me
Like I put my whole arm in jam
Step out the whip, fill up my tank
Buss mic, fill up my bank
Mums life, them man wank, they get their hands dirty
I keep my hands clean, you'll get murked, hands free
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, I speak the truth out of your Hi-Fi
When I'm on the mic headphones don't lie
I'll take your shit, eeny meeny mine, Nemo, you can't find
Reload, the bar's grime
CEO, Boy Better Know, already know
I fuck up the show, JME everywhere I go, making P [x2]
They wanna be me, but these MC's can't see me
I'm too far ahead, too way gone, better go out and buy my CD [x2]
