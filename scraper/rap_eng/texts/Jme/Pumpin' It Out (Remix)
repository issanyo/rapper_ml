[Verse 1: D Double E]
Man are pumpin' it, jumping about, jumping about, everybody jumping about
A bag of shots, man are dumping 'em out, dumping 'em out, manaman are dumping 'em out
All the boys in your whip slumping about, slumping about, everybody slumping about
Try play dead, get a tump in your mout, tump in your mout, you'll get a tump in your mout
No dirt, you'll have a lump on your mout, lump on your mout, you'll get a lump on your mout
I don't care if you're thumping it out, thumping it out, energy and pumping it out
Cause you're gonna need fitness first, I'm gonna draw for my thing first
Make the situation worse, who's gonna be the witness when I burst?

[Verse 2: Kano]
I'm pumpin' it out, Porsche came and jump in it
Sick speakers tumping it
And I'm dressed [?] white man can't jump swagger
Can't Reebok pump in it
Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump-pump pumpin' it out
Man chat shit, get a tump in the mouth
Your girlfriend a slag, niggas pumpin' her out
All day everyday spunk in her mouth
I heard you get a good brain
My man are doing sums in her mouth
You married a bitch cause there's something about
Now my nigga OJ hunting her down
I be the nightclub stage show don, back off top
And jump in the crowd
Ladies scream when I come to the town
A man [?]

[Hook: D Double E]

[Verse 3: Footsie]
(Man are pumping it) Benners and scores
Pumpin' out and I move indoors
Pump's coming out, fam, if it is war
Pump's coming out like say I've got asthma
Bullets'll spread in your skin like cancer
Them man are lying, look, I am the truth
Nuttin' but fire when I'm in the booth
Pumpin' it out, I get the whole rave jumping about
Look, you'll get a tump in your mout, my yout
What's all this acting about, my yout?
You're not pumpin' it out, my yout
When I see the goal I shoot
Stop, stand, salute, the general
You can send who you want, I'll end 'em all
Them man are through to me, they're edible

[Verse 4: Hyper]
Pumpin' it out, in the gym man is lumping it out
Anim√© style, I'm thumping it out
But my aim should get you all jumping, jumping about
Supercep triceps and biceps
[?] pecks and quadriceps
Loads of medium and high reps
Do about three for about five secs
Can't forget back, upper, lower
Pumpin' it out like an Olympic rower
Manaman know on the mic, I'm a flower
Rapping on beats? Yeah, it's a blower
You dun know I came to back Double
Me and him on any track is trouble
Long time coming, got the gyal running
Pumpin' it out, tryna look stunning

[Hook: D Double E]
Pumpin' it out
All day everyday, pumpin' it out

All day everyday, pumpin' it out, getting about
Pumpin' it out
All day long man are pumpin' it out
All day everyday, pumpin' it out
Pumpin' it out, getting about, getting about

[Verse 5: Jme]
More time I roll on my Js
Full volume, full bass
Have a riddim on repeat for days
That's when you know man's just pumpin' it out
The road's like an outdoor rave
Or in the whip with the tinted shade
In my yard, neighbours complain
Cuh true say man's just pumping it out, trust me
Back in the day, mum used to cuss me
Not no more, it must be
Cause the music lets man live comfy
Just pumpin' it out, 'nough P
Cashpoint, everyting there lovely
When I jump on the stage if I got something to say
I just spit it out, man's pumpin' it out

[Verse 6: Rapid]
Who's hot? I is
Heart of a tiger, look into my iris
Are you not surprised the way that I ride this?
I could go 24/7 like an IBIS
Hotel, oh well
I'm a Mercedes Benz, you're an Opel
Two mix CDs and you don't sell
Have you not recognised that I won't fail? Cause I am a battler
Problem tackler, take a picture
With my 10 megapixel digital camera
Snap, different calibre
Singer/songwriter like Noel Gallagher
Are you not surprised the way that I ricochet?
I could chop it up, I'm wicked on a CDJ
No shop but I've got P-E-A
No stress, it's a cup of T-E-A

[Hook: D Double E]
Pumpin' it out
All day everyday, pumpin' it out
All night long man are pumpin' it out
All day everyday, pumpin' it out, getting about
Pumpin' it out
All day long man are pumpin' it out
All day everyday, pumpin' it out
Pumpin' it out, getting about, getting about
