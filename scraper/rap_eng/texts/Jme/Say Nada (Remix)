[Verse 1: Jme]
You know them ones
You know them days
You want things to fall in place
While keeping up with this pace
You're tryna keep a smile on that face
So you're raving on the weekday
Off that street and into this rave
Fam, it's mad (it's mad)
Tell the DJ pull a banger out the bag (out the bag)
Ladies dancing on you like you're on your stag (you're on your stag)
Please, somebody get this man a cab
He's licked like blam!

[Verse 2: Shakka]
My ex left saying she ain't got the time, yo
I double take and pray the e-mail was a typo
I call my mate and now we're in the same lifeboat
The same day, his was cheating with a shite bloke
Come on now, it's kind of peak
Nice guys should keep all of their receipts
I don't need a shoulder, I'm just looking for a freak
With dirty jokes and a love for tasty meat
Dutty wingmen, to the party we go
Wray and all his nephews reppin' sweet talks
Shakka Khan, meet my Portuguese friend, won't you please
She makes dirty jokes and she loves the way you speak

[Verse 3: Shakka]
Alley-oop
She's out my brain, five shots is all it took
Mandem make excuses when their line gets a shutdown
I keep it sweet, never really liked my grapes sour (bloodfire)
Whose hands round me?
I can smell the Wray, she's as waved as me
Motions of her wave says she knows how to hula
"Gun finger"- spitting all the words to "Money Trees"
Shout-out all the wingmen in the party I know
Wray and all his nephews reppin' sweet talks
Shakka go meet my friend's best friend from Belize
She loves TDE, favourite song's "Collard Greens"

[Verse 4: Jme]
Jme
You want a selfie? Blud I'm raving, please
Am I gonna touch mic? You'll have to wait and see
And if I do, mosh pit blatantly
Shakka's at the bar, waved off Wray's, it's peak
I ain't got my car so I have to pay fifty
To this Uber to get away quickly
Pass the AUX lead and let me play this beat

[Bridge: Shakka]
One day I'll make a million (one day I'll make a million)
I'll buy a four-finger ring (buy a four-finger ring)
And she will be a buff-ting (certified buff-ting)
And every night we're going in (every night we're going ham fam)
One day I'll make a million (one day I'll make a million)
I'll get that four-finger ring (buy a four-finger ring)
I'll be hustlin' until then (hustlin' until then)
If she still wants to go in
