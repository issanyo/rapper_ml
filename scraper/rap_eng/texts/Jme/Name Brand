[Pre-Hook: Wiley]
I came to jam and hold a vibes
Hold a vibes
You know I go to the studio all the time
All the time
Soundin' ever so grimy, they're causin' fights
Causin' fights
Dance dun, now they're switchin' on all the lights
I'm a name brand, I can't afford to hype

[Hook: Jme]
I'm a name brand, yeah that's right, G
I'm a name brand, just like Nike
I'm a name brand, man wanna fight me
'Cause I'm a name brand, but you can't take man
I'm a name brand, yeah that's right, G
I'm a name brand, just like Nike
I'm a name brand, man wanna fight me
'Cause I'm a name brand, but you can't take man

[Verse 1: Wiley]
"Wiley, where are you goin'?"
I'm goin' to keep an old brand goin'
Back then, everyting was steady
Lately, it's gettin' a bit edgy
Got a couple tings that I wanna try
Wanna expand so I gotta try
Have to make sure that my vibes hold sick
When I sell a ticket, it's what they're gonna buy
Branchin' out, new business
Cop the Landlord album, Giggs'
Fire, all-round fire
Hold tight Giggs, the real vibe supplier
London's changed a bit, but I can still hit the booth
Start sprayin' and give the crowd fire
We don't deflate, we stay pumped up
And dem man are flat tyre

[Pre-Hook: Wiley]
I came to jam and hold a vibes
Hold a vibes
You know I go to the studio all the time
All the time
Soundin' ever so grimy, they're causin' fights
Causin' fights
Dance dun, now they're switchin' on all the lights
I'm a name brand, I can't afford to hype

[Hook: Jme]
I'm a name brand, yeah that's right, G
I'm a name brand, just like Nike
I'm a name brand, man wanna fight me
'Cause I'm a name brand, but you can't take man
I'm a name brand, yeah that's right, G
I'm a name brand, just like Nike
I'm a name brand, man wanna fight me
'Cause I'm a name brand, but you can't take man

[Verse 2: J2K]
Next to my name, there's no losses
X 'em out with all crosses
That girl couldn't get used to me
Because she ain't used to no bosses
Ahah, all I got now is sausage
I do not count the losses
I just grab on the big back ting
And turn onto new topics, new ting
Come and ring-ring the bell, lights on
Curtains open as well, enter
Don't get gassed off no rich sex
We're just gonna do this calmly as hell
Is that cool? Well, that's swell
Do you feel me? Well, that's braille
I'm like a high street store to the gyal dem
Who can't keep their hands off the name brand sales
Oh well, well, well

[Pre-Hook: Wiley]
I came to jam and hold a vibes
Hold a vibes
You know I go to the studio all the time
All the time
Soundin' ever so grimy, they're causin' fights

'Cause I'm a name brand, but you can't take man
I'm a name brand, yeah that's right, G
I'm a name brand, just like Nike
I'm a name brand, man wanna fight me
'Cause I'm a name brand, but you can't take man

[Verse 3: Frisco]
That's the gameplan
The thug dem rate man
The gyal dem rate man
Frisco's a name brand
And where I come from, the police all hate man
Haters hate cuh they ain't man
Think you can call me out 'cause I'm a name brand?
Man wanna draw me out, what a shame
Man claim that they're out here but I can't see 'em
Anyhow, I think the piss has been taken
I'ma start movin' like Liam, it's mad
Spin an MC round like a kebab
New bars in my notepad, nigga, hold that
I'm a G by myself, you've gotta hold hands
I've never been disloyal
Like to buss joke, but I've never been a joke, man

[Pre-Hook: Wiley]
I came to jam and hold a vibes
