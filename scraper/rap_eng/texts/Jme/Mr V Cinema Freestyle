St Paul's, I was on beige strip
Now I write my own wage slip
You want to bill a spliff and kick
Lickle man ting like Biff and Chip
Winchmore I was top set kid
Now look who I'm on set with
You wanna chat 'bout your German clip
Lickle man ting like worm on stick

All you man don't know how I
Fucked up the show in less than an hour
You're a prick you've never been shower
Lickle man ting like Megazord power
I don't care whether you're wham
Ima badman I've never been prang
Wanna chat 'bout your better than man
Lickle man ting like shredder and krang

[Hook x2]
I'm the best, said it bare times
Everybody knows, when I'm on the mic
Boy better know, JME
O'rite rude boy, allow the hype

It's me on microphone, don't be afraid
I speak the truth, don't be ashamed
I feed the youth, so be amazed
Delete the fools, so be erased
I heat the booth, totally blazed
See me and move, go a different way
I disapprove of the lyrics you spray
Serious!
