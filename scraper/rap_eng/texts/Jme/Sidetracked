[Bridge: Wiley]
Gotta get back to my life again
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii

[Verse 1: JME]
I gotta get back to my life again, don't wanna be sidetracked
Arguing at radio for man to give me the mic back
Right that's it, right now I should be doing a show with a live band
But I can't be bothered tonight and what
Who's going to tell me I can't stop?
I gotta get back to my life for real
I make music, I ain't trying to kill
I gotta turn up when I'm on the bill
A thousand thousands inside a mill
A million pounds is when I sign a deal
I had a few offers but I didn't sign cause they were minor still, no lie

[Hook: Wiley]
Felt the pain I was feeling low
Felt like I had no where to go
No one to turn to
And I ain't going to ask for your help mmmm
Nobody said it was an easy road
Now when it's with me it turns to gold
I got hits for the radio and hits for the discotheque mmmm
I got hits for the radio and hits for the discotheque mmmm

[Bridge: Wiley]
Gotta get back to my life again
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii

[Verse 2: JME]
Felt the pain I was feeling low
Felt like I had nowhere to go
Yeah I know, I been feeling this way for a year or so
I can't even get off my arse
Walk to the shops get some Cheerios,
I talk to my pops but he don't hear me though
My music rocks spots, still wears the dole
Top of the pops
Felt the pain I was feeling bad
I could of punched through the ceiling man
But instead I got the keys to the beemer like Beenie Man
When I look in the mirror I see a man
Not a boy, I'm a winner
I really can, do anything, I put my mind to
Cause I'm an educated Nigerian

[Hook: Wiley]
Felt the pain I was feeling low
Felt like I had no where to go
No one to turn to
And I ain't going to ask for your help mmmm
Nobody said it was an easy road
Now when it's with me it turns to gold
I got hits for the radio and hits for the discotheque mmmm
I got hits for the radio and hits for the discotheque mmmm

[Bridge: Wiley]
Gotta get back to my life again
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
Don't wanna be sidetracked living my life on the edge, oooh ii
