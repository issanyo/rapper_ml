[Intro]

[Verse 1: JME]
Serious
Alright rudeboy, you think you're big see, I can tell you think you're big cause
When you talk you're in some mood, like you're super, you're too rude
Enough of these guys, have got shit to prove, all this arrogant shit just move
You think you're big see you run up your mouth, I know you ain't big, come to my house
Come to my door, and you'll see I don't care what anybody says I'm me
I don't change from Jamie to JME, it's all the same, it's nothing to me
But you change, you go wild, how old are you, you act like a child
Chat bare shit and you act all dumb, I know that's not how you chat to your mum

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Shut ya mouth
Ok, Listen, Yo
Oi Skepta why you murkin' so many man? Thats the word on road
I know wicked man in my postcode that will sniff two lines and go into devilish mode
Shoot you in the face then skid round the corner like yoshi and toad, so for your own good
Trust me you don't wanna see man on your road. You don't wanna see me on the scene
Last thing you hear is a bang and a scream
Bare mash man want me on their team cause they know from I lick shots heads are coming off clean
I'll put a bullet in your bean, bullet in your cainrow bullet in your lean
Put on the safety and switch off the bean
Wipe your blood off my Technomarine

[Verse 3: Tinchy Stryder]
Yeah, Yo, Stryds, What's good, yeah
Look I put the work in, I stop the flows I'm blazin' or jerkin'
Non-stop though I'm raging straight breaking Stryds I'm pullin' em off
I'm straight murkin' I'm so certain
On straps and flows on a daily mainly 30 tunes on a daily
I'm back on new TV if you don't know [?]
I'm Stryds I'm back I pack flows and I pick more rhymes I leave MC's real sort
I can't I won't jam like a rudeboy I'll still pack flows like heat so I'll squeeze off
When I enter the rave some deep sort mark for the doors like I want war
They can't see me man it's like beef war, been through ups and downs like a seesaw

[Verse 4: Fury]
Listen up
I stepped in the game for my [?], I've seen messed up things but I trust in the Lord
Bars are my witness a knife is my sword, can't stop spitting till I sekkle the score
Sekkle your jaw spitting one four in war, spit a metal four with force, spit a better four of course spit another metaphor better turn what I done before
New bar tippin' MC's with new scars, new flow settlin' MC's with killer blows, new rhymes rippin' MC's with no time
New Fury but I'm twice as angry
New bar tippin' MC's with new scars, new flow settlin' MC's with killer blows, new rhymes rippin' MC's with no time
New Fury but I'm twice as twice as
