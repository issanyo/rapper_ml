[Hook]
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)

[Verse 1]
Can you see this Boy Better Know tee that I'm sporting?
I run the roads, but its not a war ting
I'm a brand new air force art as white as the food you are snorting
While you slip that score ting, I look for the source of war
Trust, no-one could ever be sore like me
I'm the original battery sorting
Only big tunes that I'm exporting
And the bass-line ain't exporting
So stop that, start supporting
Ten pounds, rather extorting
Extortion, done the talking
Go Boy Better Know, don't come and purchase online
No walking, and you don't know JME

[Hook]
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)

[Verse 2]
Can you see my big foot stinking size 9 trainers?
On the road like peace campaigners
My whole crew is sick
We need medicine, tablets and inhalers
Some people think I'm famous
But that's all cheese like quavers
You'll see me drunk, outside the show
Taking pics with the ravers
All my haters, they're just traitors
They got vexed when they saw my papers
They used to be fans
Then they saw my pinkies and then were like "laters"
I don't care though, I'm a baders
Next year you'll see like sailors
You thought I was only a businessman
But truth say you didn't know

[Hook]
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)

[Verse 3]
Can you see blatantly I do a lot like ACME
My brain is an everything factory
I don't beef or clash with anyone
I'm cool so everyone backs me
Serious!
Sometimes people try to verbally attack me
I spot them like lyrical acne
Then I worry your charge like Scratchy
Yeyeyeyeyeyoyoyoyo
I've got a low battery
I don't care if my bars are catchy
Badman in London like Apache
Serious badman in Napah
Jump off the plane, jump in a taxi
Yasoo, rudeboy
Take me to Napa, Creeks and Daxi

[Hook]
Roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)
I am the roadrunner (meep meep!)
And I run the roads like (meep meep!)

[Hook]
Cause I am the roadrunner
And I run the roads like
I am the roadrunner
And I run the roads like
I am the roadrunner
And I run the roads like
I am the roadrunner
And I run the roads like
I am the roadrunner
