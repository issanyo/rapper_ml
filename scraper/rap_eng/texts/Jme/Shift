[Intro: Jme]
Jme
Commodo
Serious, serious
Yeah

[Verse 1: Jme]
(Anyone can get it) So be on point
Bredrin, you know the score
Kano dun told you about slipping
In 2004
Can't be moving loose
Keep your eyes peeled for all these youths
I'm a big man so I don't par with man
That roll with man that's moving food
(Anyone can get it) Don't let yourself
Argue with a prick and get drawn out
Yesterday, you didn't know he existed
But it's war now
Yeah, see what I'm saying
Carry on thinking it's a game man's playing
But really, you don't wanna see man punching
Shanking, let alone spraying
(Anyone can get it) So be on point
Rudeboy, you don't wanna slip
I told you
"Nothing goes past me" in 2006
You've gotta be moving wise
Keep your eyes peeled for all these guys
I'm a big man so the mandem know
It's not a blazing zoots ting in my ride
(Anyone can get it) Trust
Don't let your pride or ego take control
When ten man roll, don't run it up
'Cause one day, you'll be on your own
Yeah, it will get peak
Carry on thinking it's Sesame Street
But you don't wanna end up in the can like Grouch
With a big bird, seen?

[Chorus: Jme]
(Anyone can get it) No ifs, buts or maybes
It's worse if you're famous
Somebody might draw for the leng
Like the guy on the top of the Courvoisier lid
Don't care if you're baiding
Don't care what your name is
Somebody might draw for the leng
Like the guy on the top of the Courvoisier lid
No ifs, buts or maybes
It's worse if you're famous
Somebody might draw for the leng
Like the guy on the top of the Courvoisier lid
Don't care if you're baiding
Don't care what your name is
Somebody might draw for the leng
Like the guy on the top of the Courvoisier lid

[Verse 2: Jme]
(Anyone can get it) So beware
Trust me, know where you're heading
Wiley told you he slipped in South West
In 2007
You've gotta move correct
Keep your eyes peeled, stay in check
I'm a big man so I try not watch other man
But I make sure that I watch feds
Anyone can get it
So don't end up
Arguing with a fed and get yourself shift
Ten minutes ago, you were on your way to a rave
But now it's a myth
Yeah, see what I mean?
Keep shouting 'cause your license clean
Til the fed twists up your arm, puts you in a cell
And gives you eighteen
(Anyone can get it) So beware
Rudeboy, I won't say it again
Skepta told you about blood on the ceiling
In 2010
Gotta be moving swift
Keep your eyes peeled for all this shit
I'm a big man so by the time the lights come on
In the rave, I'm in the whip
(Anyone can get it) Don't think that
You are Superman with no cape
'Cause one day you might run up on the wrong Nig≈ç
Pharrell like BAPE
Yeah, it will get tense
Ain't no time for sitting on the fence
You better choose, fight or flight
It's a mad night

[Chorus: Jme]
(Anyone can get it) No ifs, buts or maybes
It's worse if you're famous
Somebody might draw for the leng
Like the guy on the top of the Courvoisier lid
Don't care if you're baiding
Don't care what your name is
Somebody might draw for the leng
Like the guy on the top of the Courvoisier lid
No ifs, buts or maybes
It's worse if you're famous
Somebody might draw for the leng
Like the guy on the top of the Courvoisier lid
Don't care if you're baiding
Don't care what your name is
Somebody might draw for the leng
Like the-
