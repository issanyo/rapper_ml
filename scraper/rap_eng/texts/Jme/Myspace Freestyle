[Intro]

This is the best tune in the whole world

It has come to my attention that I've acquired a few haters, a few impersonators and a few bootleggers but I don't give a...shut up everybody. Jme

[Freestyle]

Keep hating me because the man at HMV knows Jme
I said 'mixtape, mixtape, mixtape'
Yeah you know what I'm talking about, I'm a pisstake
I put out four per annum
While you stay home and watch channel
You watch I'll drop t-shirts and I'm using them to promote my boys and my bro'
Also known as Boy Better Know
Don't know why I told you, you already know
You know them way, you can get fake T's off eBay
Let me explain, Girl Better Blow, Girl Better Show, Girl Better Know, they're all fake
Boy Better Know, if you got them T-shirts right there, you're on your own
I do a lot like ACME
My brain is like an everything factory
I don't beef or clash with anyone
I'm cool so everyone backs me
Sometimes people try to verbally attack me
I spot them like lyrical acne
Then I warrior charge like Scratchy

Yeyeyeyeyeyoyoyoyo
I've got a low battery
I don't care, my bars are catchy
Badman in London like Apache
Badman in Napah, jump off the plane, jump in the taxi
Yasoo, rudeboy take me to Napah, Creeks and Daxi
You don't know the MySpace, shut up

Ah, everyone's girlfriend stinks and Halo 3 is shit, big up the Gears of War mandem

The industry is not cut-throat
Just bare idiots looking at my phone
Fake baders in furry coats
And award ceremonies with fake votes
Labels take your career for a joke
Sit at the top, have a drink, have a smoke
You don't need to sign to no idiot labels
Slap them, make them read what you wrote
They're putting out some idiot bands
Solo artists with no fans
Saying a lot about marketing plans
These stupid little idiot labels still don't know about Meridian man
Big H, Bossman, Pres T, Dan
Signing next man for ninety grand
While these man got the whole scene in their hand
Bootleg T-shirts make me laugh
If you want a T-shirt bruv just ask
If I see any more Boy Better garms
I'll put on my V for Vendetta mask
And come for your shop and start wrapping up fast
Girl Better Know ain't in my class
What, you think I make T-shirts for these little stupid [?] with no ass
What you wearing that T-shirt for?
Tramp, you can get three for a score
At Wembley Market you can get four
Some people in Girl Better Blow T-shirts want a picture but I'm too raw
Sorry, no your T-shirt's poor
Why are you wearing Girl Better Blow when everybody knows you don't get sore
Slapped in your boat like boat like Boom-Shakalak
Make money from me, don't try that
Nobody except Jme can spit on a beat with no high hats
Just strings and a kick and a bass and a clap
You can never do this bruv, why's that
Because your breath stinks, get Tic Tacs
Bredrin here's a pound, go buy a pack
Promoters try to chief us up
When they talk about P I bus' up
Can't book Skepta, Maximum and Jme for a G, shut up
When us man and Wiley buck up, you'e seen the stage shows we block up
Don't forget Frisco bruv, you can't afford us man so, shut up
