[Hook]
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me

[Verse 1]
You see, you're not as smart as you think
When you talk, I clock everything
Every word you say, I can lip-sync
Even the times that you blink
I'm smart, body language is an art
But you're bait, you give it away
I know exactly what you're gonna say
And how you say it before you say it
You might say "yeah, she's buff"
But I'll think subliminal stuff
Notice you're playing with your cuffs
Look you straight and call your bluff
You thought you were smart
But I've got you sussed
I'm not no piggy in the middle
No way, I can't be jinles

[Hook]
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me

[Verse 2]
I'm not as dumb as you thought
The more oblivious I act, the more
You let your guard down cause you're sure
That my rational judgement is poor
But it's oh so opposite
I clock everything, I'm proper on top of it
I'm on point, on Ps and Qs
On every letter in the flipping alphabet
See, I'll be in my room
Staring at the television
But don't think I'm slipping
I'll clock everything in my peripheral vision
You thought you were smart
But I've got you sussed
I'm not no piggy in the middle
No way, I can't be jinles

[Hook]
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me

[Bridge]
So if you just dropped me home and I get out your car
And you spud me and my CD's still in your CD changer
I'm not stupid, don't turn the volume down
Give me my CD
Or if you lost a bet a few weeks ago
Lost the wager, fair and square
I don't care how much time has passed
Blud, give me my Ps

[Hook]
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
Nothing goes past me
Not a thing goes past me
