[Intro]
Peak time
Jme with the rhymes
Serious, it's showtime
Jme with the rhymes

[Verse]
You chat a whole leap of crap about ozs and that
Blud, don't be a cac, go on, show me the crack
You need to go back to chatting 'bout phones being jacked
Cause I'm blowing up your tracks and I don't even rap
You can't beat me at nothing nowadays
Even you will say you've been blazed when I put you in place
Put on my slewing face, do up my shoelace
Even with my legs tied, I'll beat you in the human race
I'm on the streets and I'm fully on this grime ting
Yeah, you know me, Jme, the grime king
I'm in your top three MCs
So if you've got beats then drop me them, please
I don't chat shit when I spit, you feel it?
You can't match this when you spit, I mean it
I ain't gonna lie, the reason I did this remix
Is so I could talk slow like this

[Hook]
All day in the studio gets you off the roads, you know
Make tunes, pay me dough, play them on the radio
Go to university and still got time to shot an O, cause
I'm a certified badman
Critics getting critical, put me on a pedestal
I don't care, keep my cool, lyrics always radical
You know me, Jme, big MC from back in school, cause
I'm a certified badman

[Verse 2]
I tried to draw this honey that was on my road
She said I looked funny cause my bum was low
I said "so? Dummy? I ain't tryna be your hubby, no"
I told a hoe just like money, I will come and go
If I was closer, I would've got a backhand slap
She tried to ring her man but her phone book's jam-packed
Don't get your man involved, I'll get your man jacked
Him, his car, his house will get ransacked
Hands on her hip, she said her man's from the bits
Like I'm prang of this prick who drives a banged-up whip
I'm getting angry and pissed, I'll punch your man in the lip
I'm gonna go and get my sis so she can bang off this chick
Now you're shook and you can't even look straight at me
Tell your man look, straight up, it was Jme
If he wants to look for me, I will tell him
I was after the nookie like Eros and Jamesy P

[Hook]
All day in the studio gets you off the roads, you know
Make tunes, pay me dough, play them on the radio
Go to university and still got time to shot an O, cause
I'm a certified badman
Critics getting critical, put me on a pedestal
I don't care, keep my cool, lyrics always radical
You know me, Jme, big MC from back in school, cause
I'm a certified badman

[Outro]
Jme, yeah? It's how we're doing it, certified

Hold tight Sway, SAS
Serious, hold tight Skepta
Blud, hold tight Wiley, Roll Deep, Meridian, Bossman, Big H, Pablo, Dan, Meridian, President T

Hold tight Skinnyman, yeah?
Serious
Certified badman
