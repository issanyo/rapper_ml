Speed it up abit, ca' ya get me man ain't no clutz

I got more guns than Keanu from the Matrix full of lead
And I got more whips than a dominatrix's bedroom
They make great sounds, and I make pounds
The only time you push your whip, is when your bredrin breaks down
And he'll be like "ay blud, stop pushing, wait"
'Cos he see the car that I bought, from pushing weight
I don't mean getting hench on a bench pushing 40
I mean moving weight till the day I'm pushing 40
I'm a young hooligan so I don't need to fight
I'm from Meridian so I feed the fiends at night
I'm Nigerian, I represent the green and white
So come to me or Skepta if you want the green or white
You pricks think that I chose to be hated?
Nar man, I've always been musically orientated
I've been talented since birth
You should see how fast this kid learns
You just know when you've got it, like when your piss burns
Don't come to my spot and lick shots on your own
That's as off point, as a shop keeper on the phone
See if you've got a bit a' food and i'm in a bitter mood
You'll get blown up with a pump like an inner tube
I'm on point, when a car drives slow on me
If he's black, drive by
If he's white, CID
Either way, you gotta run like a greyhound
I go bookies and bet either way on a greyhound
Shotters don't know you and they don't know what you're like
When shotters want food, they ring me
Cause i'm like 'What you want? 8 ball, I got bare with me'
You're like 'I'm reloading bruv, please bare with me'
Shut-yuh-mout
You're the type to have an argument and run out and shout
I'm the type to go round for round, bout for bout
I'll win the round and bout
Catch me at the roundabout, cause i'll be there round about 10
Shooting rounds about
So shut-yuh-muh, dickhead, wasteman
