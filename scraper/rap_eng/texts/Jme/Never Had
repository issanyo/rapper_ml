[Intro: Yung Fume]
Zaytoven
Yeah man this is celebration
Get the bottles in man all of that
All this money, get this pack
All this stuff we never had man we was on the block grinding you know
We gon' turn man
Hahaha

[Chorus: Yung Fume]
I just came in
I just flexed on 'dem (I flexed)
My food 10 out of 10
I used to sell benz (benz)
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks (spend it)
I don't even like to brag
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks (yeah)
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had (stuff I never had)
All this stuff I never had
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks
All this stuff I never had (ooh)
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks
All this stuff I never had

[Verse 1: Yung Fume]
I don't even wanna know
Don't tell me 'bout your money
Don't tell me 'bout your stack I know you broke
Don't listen to these quotes (ok)
Don't listen to these rappers (nah)
Don't listen to their Twitters or their Instagrams these niggas ain't no clappers
I just linked with a badders
Now my lifestyle's lavish (lavish)
I just switched up the whip and blacked out
Man I'm feeling all savage
Man I'm feeling all grown
Three girls on my line at the same time can't answer that phone (I can't)
All this stuff I never had
I take a flight and jet lag
All this stuff I never had
Imma go spend me some racks
On my wall I need a plaque (plaque)
Every weekend I drink yak (yak)
I dropped a tape and another
Then I see how they react (my fans)
I'm thinking of buying a flat (flat)
All this stuff I never had

[Bridge: Yung Fume]
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had
I'm gonna go spend me some racks
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had

[Chorus: Yung Fume]
I just came in
I just flexed on 'dem (I flexed)
My food 10 out of 10
I used to sell benz (benz)
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks (spend it)
I don't even like to brag
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks (yeah)
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had (stuff I never had)
All this stuff I never had
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks
All this stuff I never had (ooh)
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks
All this stuff I never had
Serious

[Verse 2: Jme]
Fam, I never had much
But what I had, money can't get
Dead crep, picky hair
But I still got respect (truss)
That being said, respect weren't paying no bills (no)
Quicksave in my kitchen (what), everything said no frills (truss)
Fam I'm tired of mum stressing
Dishwasher was a blessing
Made bangers on Playstation Music 2000 fam no messing (brap)
Man was making beats on Logitech little shit PC speakers (facts)
Now man's got them big twin vocals with beryllium in the tweeters (facts)
Bare tings I never had (truss)
My first car was my dad's (what?!)
My school uniform was my brother's old one, even the bag (truss)
I wanted LA Gear's (serious), but man never got a pair (yeah)
I used to wear Skepta's crep for years, now I've got SK Air's

[Chorus: Yung Fume]
I just came in
I just flexed on 'dem (I flexed)
My food 10 out of 10
I used to sell benz (benz)
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks (spend it)
I don't even like to brag
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks (yeah)
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had (stuff I never had)
All this stuff I never had
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks
All this stuff I never had (ooh)
All this stuff I never had
All this stuff I never had
Now I'm gon' spend all these racks
All this stuff I never had

[Outro: Yung Fume]
Whip, whip, whip, whip
My bitch all fit
My fans see me out
Gotta pose for a pic
