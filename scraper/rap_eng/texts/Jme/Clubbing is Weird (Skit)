When you're a kid and you go clubbing, it's like
Oh my god, it's like 'what is going on?'
Like there's actually a room, a dark room
Everyone's just like having fun and drinking and dancing around to music
There's no parents in here, like 'we can do whatever we want'
Like, this is like, it was crazy, I remember going town
I was just standing there looking around like 'oh my god', like
'This is mental', like, they should do this every night, I'll come here every single night
It was mental
