[Verse 1: Jme]
Man's a big producer ina dis
Playing with stems like a biologist
You're listening to the best in the game
Yeah, JME and Wiley it is
We will just keep strapping these bars
'Til you catch the drift like Japanese cars
Any of you verified artists wanna chat shit?
Man will start slapping up stars

[Verse 2: Wiley]
I don't wanna ramp or skin on the riddim
Skate around tracks, I cling to the riddim
I wanna sound right on the riddim
I run up on a spitter and light up a riddim
I'm tight on a riddim, cah man a top flight on a riddim
MCs wanna fight on a riddim
It's what I'm like on a riddim
I do it like swoosh, Nike on a riddim

[Verse 3: Jme]
Me, fam I don't waste no time
You say 1, 2, 3, I say five
How much work I put in
No wonder teenage unemployment is so high
Blood, this is a full time job
And I get paid
Cheque out the wad
I'm a songwriter, performing artist and a producer, fam, I swear to God

[Hook: Jme and (Wiley)]
Who's doing it, doing it like (bang, bang, bang)
We're doing it, doing it like (bang, bang, bang)
Who's killing it, killing it like (bang, bang, bang)
We're killing it, killing it like (bang, bang, bang)
Who's doing it, doing it like (bang, bang, bang)
We're doing it, doing it like (bang, bang, bang)
Who's killing it, killing it like (bang, bang, bang)
We're killing it (bang)

[Verse 4: Wiley]
I walk in the game like damn, what's the new plan?
At the top of the mic game, I already am
Got a couple of new tracks that already bang
Like J in the game cause I was already nang
See your closest bredrin, said he won't grass ever
Them times man have already sang
Won't ever see man like me on a sunbed chilling, why?
Because I'm already tanned

[Verse 5: Jme]
Fam, it's more than grime
See me on the stage in my Air Jordan Flights
Buss up the rave, then early morning times
Catch me at Heathrow, boarding flights
This is more than a par
Original skengman warriors of the earth
Doing this ting until the end of time
Will hot you up, they don't care who you are

[Verse 6: Wiley]
This ain't a myth, we are real grime stars
And we ain't gonna be a par
Work so damn hard in our lives, we gotta go far
So we're raising the bar
It's everyday not once in a blue when I'm making a star
Reach the end of the third 8 bar
If it's a 32 or 64 bars then we start lighting up stars
You get me

[Hook]
