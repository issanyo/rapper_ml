[Hook: Shakka]
Someone put me on a giant plane
Don't care the time of day
I'm kosher either way
I just need to find my space
And take time off, take time off, uh
A-ya-yeah
Take time off, take time off

[Verse: Jme]
Yeah, Serious
Drizzy told man "tek time"
Skept told man "tek time"
Kendrick told man "make some time"
Before the judge and jury go blind
Man do it for the phase
Man don't think about consequences now-a-days
Man need to set pace
Cos the young mans standing on the roads is bait
Alone
I need time for myself
Work on my health, invest in wealth
I have no idea how I stack these chips
With the shit cards I was dealt
Alone
I need time off please, the works got me feeling off key
I have no idea how I carry on working here fam, I can't breathe

[Hook: Shakka & Jme]
Someone put me on a giant plane

And take time off, take time off, uh
A-ya-yeah
Take time off, take time off
(Take time, take time)
