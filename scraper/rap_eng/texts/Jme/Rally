[Verse 1: Jme]
Welcome to the badman party
Ps in the bank, don't need a carti
Man ask me what's the time, I pull out my phone
Furthermore, don't ask me
None of that bullshit gets past me
And if you tweet me, I won't press RT
But Xbox Live, man will press RT
Headtop man, W-I

[Verse 2: Tre Mission]
Know what it is, I'm Tre from the Milly
Phone going off when you see me in the city
I've made a few bags but I'm tryna make a milli
I've gotta check spits [?]
And I'm out here so you see me gon' queen
Money still dirty but I got it all clean
Love? Hate? Hoes? I be getting all three
Tell me what you need, you can get it off me

[Verse 3: Jme]
You know what it is, I'm straight from the L
D to the N, ain't ever been jail
Ain't been inside a fed station cell
But then man stopped me about 15,000 times
What the hell?
Swear down, right now they're probably on my tail
Maybe they hate me cause the bass is weighty
And the whip looks cold as well

[Verse 4: Tre Mission]
Know what it is, I'm Tre from the dot
Phone's going off when they see me in the spot
I made a lil money but I'm tryna make a lot
And the girls say I'm rude but I get it from the block
But you know it's all good cause they give me that coo
If her man had money, she would give me that too
Got [?] I ain't getting that flu
Nose all runny? Nah, nigga, that's you

[Verse 5: Jme]
Obviously, I see more than I can say
So I pick up the mic and spray
Us man here can do this all day
If you don't believe me, ask Tre
None of these guys can par me
If so then I'll be back like [?]
Rolling with Tre
He'll be rolling the green and purple like Barney

[Verse 6: Tre Mission]
Three times for the fam, eat food like [?]
I get three reloads, that's each time
I'm on the mic, spitting bars in the rave
Niggas know what I call it already, that's me time
I had to start from the top like three times
I get three reloads, that's each time
I'm on the mic, spitting bars in the rave
Niggas know what I call it already, that's me time
