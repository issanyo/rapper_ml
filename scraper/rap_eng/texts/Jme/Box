[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Box in ya mouth
Act up, you will get box in ya mouth
Don't get rude fam, box in ya mouth
You ain't that dude na, box in ya mouth
B-b-b-box, box in ya mouth
Act up, you will get box in ya mouth
Don't get rude fam, box in ya mouth
You ain't that dude na, box in ya mouth

[Verse 1: Lethal Bizzle]
I didn't come here to fight
But I will beat you up like fight night
Violence is something I don't incite
But I am a Ryu Hadouken type (Hadouken!)
Pay attention when I'm talking
These size ten feet you couldn't walk in
I'm not a loot but the P I'm stalking, I put the fork in
Yeah man are hungry, starving, you man are jarring
Flow's so alarming, the game I'm carving
All of a sudden he wants to be my mate
Two twos that and I'm definitely parring him
Definitely parring him, definitely par
When you man are some likkle man like Arshavin
You had a head start but now you're par
Them moves there won't get you that far
Box

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Box in ya mouth
Act up, you will get box in ya mouth
Don't get rude fam, box in ya mouth
You ain't that dude na, box in ya mouth
B-b-b-box, box in ya mouth
Act up, you will get box in ya mouth
Don't get rude fam, box in ya mouth
You ain't that dude na, box in ya mouth

[Verse 2: Jme]
Punch in the face, punch in the face
Nobody wants a punch in the face
That's why more time I give man a slap
I said on 96 Fuckries that
Nobody wants a punch in the face because when you get a punch in the face, it hurts
When you get a thump in the jaw it's worse
When you get a box in the mouth, lip burst
It's the truth
Run up your gums, you might lose a tooth
Running away, you might lose a boot
Running the roads like it's Looney Tunes
If you don't get a box in the mouth
Then snooker ball in a sock, swing it out
If man's giant like Goliath
Then I've got rocks in the pouch
You'll get a b-b-b-b-box

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Box in ya mouth
Act up, you will get box in ya mouth
Don't get rude fam, box in ya mouth
You ain't that dude na, box in ya mouth
B-b-b-box, box in ya mouth
Act up, you will get box in ya mouth
Don't get rude fam, box in ya mouth
You ain't that dude na, box in ya mouth

[Verse 3: Face]
Yeah, yo box in the griller-ler-ler

About to come and done your dance, I'mma done your dance
Fam you know the drill-ler-ler
You may think that you are ill in this ting
But know I'm iller-ler-ler
And if you want to come and conflict with Face
Know I'll be the winner-ner-ner
Me na rant me na skinner-ner-ner
