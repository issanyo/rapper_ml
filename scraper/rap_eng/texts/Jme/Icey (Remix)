[Intro: Ironik]
Yeah, remix!
Look

[Hook: Ironik]
I'm feeling icey, I'm feeling icey
I see dem watching now, I see they like me
Hunnid, hunnid on my wrist, I'm feeling icey
You know I got the baddest right beside me
I'm feeling icey, I'm feeling icey
I see dem watching now, I see they like me
Hunnid, hunnid on my wrist, I'm feeling icey
You know I got the baddest right beside me (remix)

[Verse 1: Ironik]
If you're calling it's a race, I want first place
I've been on my grind, I deserve the praise
They see me on the street, boy, better know my face
They talking to my back, but can't keep up the pace
Busy doing tours, busy doing shows
Rolling 30 deep when we are on the road
This week, I made 30 bangers, man I'm on a roll
Might just treat myself to a flight to Monaco

[Pre-Chorus: Ironik]
They see me on the street and they say "Where you been?"
They see me on the road, "Is that really him?"
They're calling up my line like ring-ring
You see the chains on my neck, that's bling bling

[Hook: Ironik]
I'm feeling icey, I'm feeling icey
I see dem watching now, I see they like me
Hunnid, hunnid on my wrist, I'm feeling icey
You know I got the baddest right beside me
I'm feeling icey, I'm feeling icey
I see dem watching now, I see they like me
Hunnid, hunnid on my wrist, I'm feeling icey
You know I got the baddest right beside me

[Verse 2: Jme]
You already know
Skeppy's bro, yeah, call me Younger Icey
Mains t-shirt under Nike
Murder the beat whenever hunger strikes me
No bitches wander by me
That's wifey in her slumber nightie
Face mask, cucumber eye cream
Her living her dreams is one of my dreams
Ice, ice, call man accountant, twice, twice
Cop that yard for a nice price
Cut the cost down, slice, slice
Council estate brought up
Now I'm collecting my keys
You can do this too, my g
Make them freeze, 0 degrees
(Serious)

[Pre-Chorus: Ironik]
They see me on the street and they say "Where you been?"
They see me on the road, "Is that really him?"
They're calling up my line like ring-ring
You see the chains on my neck, that's bling bling

[Hook: Ironik]
I'm feeling icey, I'm feeling icey
I see dem watching now, I see they like me
Hunnid, hunnid on my wrist, I'm feeling icey
You know I got the baddest right beside me
I'm feeling icey, I'm feeling icey
I see dem watching now, I see they like me
Hunnid, hunnid on my wrist, I'm feeling icey
You know I got the baddest right beside me

[Outro: Ironik]
Right beside me
Uh, yeah
Icey
