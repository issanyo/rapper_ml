[Hook: Fekky](x2)
Shut up, fuck off
I've got that big ting that will blow your nuts off
My whole team's hard, we don't do soft
Shut up, fuck off

[Verse 1: Fekky]
Yeah, look at me, now look at you
I was born to win, you was born to lose
I've been on my money from the get-down
Since I had that strap, telling niggas "get down"
No mercy on these broke cunts
Since 18, I've only been broke once
We count money and smoke blunts
And fuck girls, I make em take the fruit punch
Yep, go hard, go hard
50 pound in my pocket, 20 bags on my bank card
You say you're trapping, where's your profit?
Your girl told you you're hard? Dump her, she ain't honest
Yeah, eight years on this hard grind
Yeah, so fuck you and your hard times
With your dead food, on your dead nan
Shut the fuck up, cuh I ain't got no time

[Hook: Fekky](x2)

[Verse 2: Jme]
Shut up, after you do that please fuck off
You might hear me on radio, I'm on Rinse but I'm not washed
You're the opposite of greazy, you man there are sterilised
I'm a badman at life, I went bed and woke up verified
Half of you lot don't sleep, tryna put work in, but it's weak
While I'm there in bed dribbling, wake up and I've got more P
Half you man are on drugs, up in the club like I can't see
But I'm like Winston from Eastenders, everyone's got lines except me
Fucking hell, I speak the truth, them man are misleading the youth
It's like Power Rangers, it's morphing time whenever they jump in the booth
Fam, don't make me switch, Jme up in this bitch
I've been telling man shut ya mout from 2006, trust me
Cause your voice is husky, you little idiots think you can cuss me
But when the cameras have gone, you man are depressed, smoking a gret like Krusty
So you better think twice before you open your mouth
You do not want man dem to come to your house, shut up

[Hook: Fekky](x2)

[Verse 3: Killa Ki]
Haters better fall back
Before me and Fillon roll round with our new strap
The truth's back, let the hood talk, it's a newsflash
25 shots from the MAC will leave your crew splashed
Leave you on London tonight
Us niggas bang guns, we ain't got  time to fight
If we ain't got a strap, then believe we got a knife
Cause shoot-ups and stab-ups just a part of the life
Uh, so shut up and fuck off
Don't you niggas know we the quickest to buck off?
One shot from the 45 will rip your top off
And leave you with holes in your chest, so fuck off
Uh, we the south east villains
Pecknam to New Cross is where the gat's ringing
Trapping, robbing, shottings and killings
Uh, and we're fucking sexy women
