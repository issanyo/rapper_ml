[Intro: Tinchy Stryder]
Everyday questions
Like are you still cool with them man?
Still making music?
Like, who's got more Ps out of you and...
Ah, come on, bruv!

[Hook: Tinchy Stryder]
'Llow me, talking like we're co-D
And you don't know me
'Llow me, on a serious (serious)
'Llow me
Like whoa, how we
Ended up, allow me
Talking like you own me
Serious ting, 'llow me

[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo, this is not the same Strydes
This is not the same guy
Something doesn't sound right
Sounding wrong, you alright?
I know this is my life
Got that touch, feels right
I know I need my mic
Up a touch, sounds live
This is not the same plan
They fucked up the game plan
When I'm from the same land
But not bopping to the same jam
We don't stay where they stand
They can't stand where we land
You won't see us shake hands
With them man, they're fake man
Real life's what I'm dealing with
All of the bullshit I'm dealing with
Feels like I've paid my fees and this
Lost and found my keys and this
Big, I've never known what freedom is
Been fucked up in the music biz
You can hit one of the 'next to' lists
And they won't give one, let alone two shits
'Llow me, real real
Fuck that, no more chill chill
More time, I'm in E still
Where we say "fuck the Old Bill"
Doubting me, they still will
Doubting them, I still will
Flow on the mic, I kill, kill
Born in the rhyme, I'm still skilled, 'llow me, just

[Hook: Tinchy Stryder]
'Llow me, talking like we're co-D
And you don't know me
'Llow me, on a serious (serious)
'Llow me
Like whoa, how we
Ended up, allow me
Talking like you own me
Serious ting, 'llow me

[Break: Jme]
Brother, 'llow me
Too many, brother, there's too many questions
How many questions can I answer, blud? Online
Oh, and you probably know, oh, he's Skepta's brother, oh
Blud, questions in person, when I'm eating
'Llow it, man

[Verse 2: Jme]
Everyday questions, "Yo, Jme"
"Who's your girl, wah gwan for him and her?"
"How much P can your bank transfer?"
Yo, fuck that, will you transfer?
Send man a tune, let me do what I do
It's not everyday interview
I just come offstage, interview
I'm in the toilet, pissing, interview
Shopping with mumzy, interview
I'll break man's head into two
Swear down, man think cause they got
A 4K camera phone, they can film man too
No, 'llow it
Respect man, blud, what's wrong with you?
Don't try transform into badboy
I know badboys, badboys don't know you

[Hook: Tinchy Stryder] [x2]
'Llow me, talking like we're co-D
And you don't know me
'Llow me, on a serious (serious)
'Llow me
Like whoa, how we
Ended up, allow me
Talking like you own me
Serious ting, 'llow me
