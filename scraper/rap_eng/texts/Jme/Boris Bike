[Intro x5]
Riding a Boris Bike

[Hook]
If you see man riding a Boris Bike
2 pound debit card leaning back
See man riding a Boris Bike
Feed ducks in the park with peas and that
Ride so much I can't get a boner
See man riding a Boris Bike
When fuel run out of the German whip
See man riding a Boris Bike

[Bridge]
If you see man riding a Boris Bike
Stainless silver leaning back
See man riding a Boris Bike
Pimp my bike MTV and that
Ride so much I can't get a boner
See man riding a Boris Bike
Who told you I roll on my Johnson
See man riding a Boris Bike

[Verse 1: The Vujanic]
Ride my bike Shoreditch to pits
On my bike, I linked bare tings
Talk too much? Don't pay, I dip
Ride along munching chicken and chips
One ting said that's bang out of order
You can't make 4 inch man feel smaller
Them gyal there you will not see me with one
Treat them like they're Muller Corner
You don't wanna race man trust me
Who told you my bike gets rusty?
Draw for the FIFA 2014
Bayern Munich I'll beat your team
Skin gets dry I use E40
Riding along in the park too quickly
Took a break with the mandem go hard
In the park and chase some frisbees

[Verse 2: K.S.I]
Man was down over there
Now man is down over here
Man’s got a wig on my hair
Don’t care about me breathing air
When manamans hungry manaman starve
Manaman poor other man laugh
Manaman sad manaman cry
Link with man that manaman fry
Look me in a minamon ting
No affording swag or bling
Come on man wanna be the next rap ting
Does man have to suck some D? (no homo)
When Manaman riding, manaman slow
Manaman’s car, other man tow
Manaman’s horny see manaman’s ho
When I go — they say no
Manaman Manaman Manaman Manaman

[Verse 3: Klayze]
Bad boy bell, Boris Bike
Not my mans, or my mans
When machine try ask for my card
I do one old school kick him and Blam!
Guys better show respect if they see man having bare complications
Guys better show respect if there's no space at the docking station
20 minutes of bike time left, I'm only joking this was theft
I ain't gonna lie, If I don't like the feel of one cushion on to the next
Mans just tryna get across London
Man don't wanna pay congestion
When man starts to feel that hunger
Park outside of the finest restaurant

[Verse 4: Jme]
Yeah, the whips parked up
Lucky I don't have to go far cos'
Mans only looking to spend £2 on a quick video ting then I'm gonna dust
If there's not a bike left I'm gonna get a bus
If the bus ain't there then I get a train
If the trains are taking the fucking piss, rudeboy, then I get a plane
Every 29 minutes mate, dock that bike or man have to pay
I ain't gonna lie, I can afford £50 but I don't want the bike for a day
I'm just tryna save P's so I a man on a mission
See man riding a Boris bike, yeah, but I am not a politician
