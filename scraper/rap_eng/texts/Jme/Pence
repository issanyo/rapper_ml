Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Wanna make Ps? Listen to me

[Verse 1]
It's Jme
Do not come try floss around me
Everybody knows I'm tryna make Ps
Bill, two bill, five bill, G
I make Ps with my brother
Don't wear shirts, can't pop my collar
If you wanna help make Ps, just holla
Cent, five cent, ten cent, dollar
I par with a mouse
Keyboard, PC, they're my pals
They help me make pounds
So I can buy creps, studio, cars, house
Buss two skanks on the dancefloor
Make tunes, make money, but I need more
We do this so we can't be poor
Drugs, scams, credit card fraud

[Hook]
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Wanna make Ps? Listen to me

[Verse 2]
I was a born musician
MC to artist, quick transition
Easy, some MCs are on a mission
With their optimistic vision
Wanna be an artist? That's a big stretch
Me, I'm an artist, I can use decks
Mics, Macs, PCs
I went from wack, average, better, best
Skepta and Eskiboy, money-makers
We're making money out here, cuz
If you're not hustling, don't come near us
Boy Better Know, serious
If you don't make Ps then chill
That's why I got this tune off Will
I'm making Ps without a deal
Pound, five pound, ten pound bill

[Hook]
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Wanna make Ps? Listen to me

[Verse 3]
It's like an illness being broke
So music is my antidote
Waiting for cheques to clear? That's a joke
Shekels, loose change, Â£5 notes
Now I make big money, throw away a fiver
And I don't want loose change either
Fly my family to Nigeria
Kobo, two kobo, five kobo, naira
Yo, blud, give me my cash
Cash in hand so I can look flash
Flash brehs like me will get the lash
Girls, ladies, groupies, gash
I can't help it, I'm a law-breaker
Dressed in black like undertaker
Jme, big money-maker
P, Ps, papes, paper

[Hook]
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Pence, five pence, ten pence, boof
Wanna make Ps? Listen to me
