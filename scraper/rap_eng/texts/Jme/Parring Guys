[Intro]
Hey Tempz, you know I heard guys tried to phone guys, and tell guys they owe Ps cause guys use bars [?] I swear we should phone guys

[Verse 1]
I'm parring the par, them man know it's a par, it's a par
Them man guy right saying it's a lot
But us man know it's a par, it's a par
Slew dem, not a par, not a par
Get to the rave, it's a par, it's a par
Shower down man in the rave, then after the dance
Just know it's a par, it's a par
I'm the king parrers, everyone knows that's me, parrers
Take out your fists [?] and parrers
Pick out the [?] we don't play, parrers
Slap man, I'm a real parrers
Phone me, I say I'm about, parrers
Link your gash in the rave, parrers
Bust in the mouth, I get rhymes, parrers
You got couple guys saying it's alot
Everyone knows these days, it's alot
You can't keep saying it's alot, it's alot
Us man say it's alot, them man, don't know what's alot
Everyone knows in the scene, it's alot
When I come through in this bar, it just pops
Stop putting our slang in your verse, so watch
There's no indi-yards in this lyric, everyone knows this lyric is straight
Bare man know this lyric is bait
Got a problem, meet me down gate, or Maryland
Stratford, Plaistow, trust me, you know me I'm not an arsehole
Like Skepta, you can see me in cargo
Drink at the barber, don't act hard tho
Come to the rave and mess up the place
When I'm on stage, I'm not watching face
Gun in my hip, to the music and bass
Tearing up mic cause the sound is my taste
Watch me, I'm the future in race
Confront me, you don't want me in your case
I'm original, most man copy and paste, that's abysmal
Watch me, I'm setting pace
[Bridge]
Stop copying man, that ain't the truth
Stop copying man, I might end up duppying man
I'm about, so start worrying man
Go back to college, start studying man
I might end up bodying man, with a leng
So stop copying man, it's dead, copying man

[Hook]
Parring guys, this one's about parring guys
This is alot [?} so Tempa T's parring guys
Parring parring guys, this is alot, parring guys
Mash up man's face, kick man down the stairs
Now you know I'm parring guys
[?] parring guys, Chronik parring guys, Tempz parring guys
Everyone knows that we par guys
[?] par guys, Chronik par guys, Tempz par guys
Everyone knows that we par guys
Wrap man, if it's our time, beef, we got the star nines
Music, it's a hard grind, nobody fucks with our lives
Know that, it's our time, every single year, it's our grime
Violate like last time, get bottled up by the bar side
Par off the par, I'm still parring the par
Couple man thought they were parring the par
Couple man tryna get a single deal off a word
But now, it's a par, it's a par, parring the par
Starring the car, if you don't want beef, stop parring the par
You could be in Greengate, with your green flags [?]
But fuck that, I'm parring the par
Forest Gate with the blue flags, with the new cats
If you want war, we could do that
Pull out a Star-9 till we shoot that
Come to your ends with balaclavas like we move that
Take your chains and we do rap
Most of your man, they do chat
What you gonna say when your food's jacked
Come for your keys and remove that
Don't want me to see me parring the par, get your crew shanked

[Verse 2}

Wrap man, if it's our time, beef, we got the star nines
Music, it's a hard grind, nobody fucks with our lives
Know that, it's our time, every single year, it's our grime
Violate like last time, get bottled up by the bar side
Beef we got the star nines, clap man with the 45
Drag man out of the door side, drag man out of the door side
Beef we got star nines, clap man with the 45
Drag man out of the door side, drag man out of the door side
Couple man tried to put our tees in the shop
We're gonna put our own tees in the shop
It's alot, that you put our own tees in the shop
But thanks, we're gonna be controlling the spot
Thanks to JJ, it's a [?] in the shop
But we're going to be controlling the lot
As well as Non Stop Working, that's in the shop
I wear my own garms like JME in the shop

{Outro]

[?] Eight guys can pay me for a lot
Par, it's alot, it's alot tease
Non Stop Working tease, it's a par tease
It's nice, it's nice, [?]

Big up JME on the riddim, it's nice, it's nice
