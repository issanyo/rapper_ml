Yo
Oi this tune is strictly for the ladies
Who didn't get the message the first time
It's the remix
Skepta, Wiley, Jme
Single (Just mingle)
Yo

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Hello, my name's Skepta
I'm the one that says "If you want to take him home, go on then, go on then"
So if you want to take me home, go on then, go on then
She said, "What d'you mean?"
I said, "What d'you mean, what d'you mean?"
Then she said, "What d'you mean, what d'you mean, what d'you mean?"
I said, "Shut ya mouth!"
About "What d'you mean, what d'you mean, what d'you mean?"
You fool, I know couple guys that went to your school
So pick up your face, don't think that you're choong
Before I use your jawside to practice Wing Chun
That was a disrespect, I apologise, I don't mean to get facey
But how do you expect me to act when I hear you got juiced on the floor by Crazy?

[Hook: Skepta]
If you're single, then mingle
If he's buff, put his number inside your phone
If you want to take him home, go on then, go on then
If you're single, then mingle
If he's buff, put his number inside your phone
If you want to take him home, go on then, go on then

[Verse 2: Jme]
Yeah, cuz
Chicks need to free it up
Your hips will get beat up
My stick's ready so eat up
Yeah you know what time it is, ladies don't act unaware
It's time to tie back your hair, I've got high blood pressure down there
Yeah, man, that's what I'm talking about
You could put more in your mouth
I just want to pour in her mouth, yeah
After me, could you handle two more man?
'Cause Skepta and Wiley are in the van
Go on then, serious, I want to bang

[Hook: Skepta, Wiley]
If you're single, then mingle
If he's buff, put his number inside your phone
If you want to take him home, go on then, go on then
If you're single, then mingle
If he's buff, put his number inside your phone (Eskiboy)
If you want to take him home, go on then, go on then

[Verse 3: Wiley]
Put your number in here, followed by your name and story in there
Who's that choongting standing right there?
I tell you what, in five minutes meet me round there where the bar is
I'm in [?], gotta be careful
D'you know what a star is? It's one of them artists
You wanna know what make my car is? I ain't got a car, try this though
Ring when you wanna link up, it's not long, I'll make sure you get picked up and dropped home
I've got places we can go, no mix up, it's all out of the ends
Don't slip when you talk to your friends, fix up, it's just between between me and you
So rudeboy when you screw up your face in the dance
You better know I've got your wifey up

[Hook: Skepta]
If you're single, then mingle
If he's buff, put his number inside your phone
If you want to take him home, go on then, go on then
If you're single, then mingle
If he's buff, put his number inside your phone
If you want to take him home, go on then, go on then
