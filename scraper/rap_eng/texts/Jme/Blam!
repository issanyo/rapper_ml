[Intro]
I need a drink but I don't need one
Cause I'm ready
I'm alright

Composure
Listen

Well, well, well

You'll get a punch in the nose like BLAM!
You'll get a big nose bridge like BLAM!
You'll get a big nose bleed like BLAM!
You'll get a broken bridge like
Well well well
Don't think you can screw me cause your bopping
Cause JME dont care 'bout nothing
I'll cross the road and do man suttin' like BLAM!
You'll get a trip on the floor like BLAM!
Drag your face 'cross the curb like BLAM!
Now fling you in the road like BLAM!
You'll get an elbow drop like
Well well well
Don't think you can run it up cause your at work
You can be the boss or the office clerk
I'll roll my sleeves up and go berserk like BLAM!
Slam your head off the table BLAM!
Think your head hit the keyboard like BLAM!
Smash your head off the screen like BLAM!
Fling you into the water cooler
Well well well
Don't try pull a fast one at radio

Then right hook will stop the whole show like BLAM!
You'll have one tooth missing like BLAM!
Slam your head off the decks like BLAM!
Dash you out of the door like BLAM!
And you'll get a punch in the jaw like

You'll get tiger uppercut out of the room like BLAM!
You'll get a punch in the chin like BLAM!
You'll go through the roof like BLAM!
You'll get a swift uppercut like BLAM!
You'll get a tiger knee like

Keep talking about gangs and guns
Next time I catch you on your ones
I'll make man shit yourself without the runs like BLAM!
You'll have runs dripping out like BLAM!
You'll have big brown pants like BLAM!
You'll get kicked out the room like BLAM!
You will just stink
Stop looking at me behind the tints
Because you can be off the boat, fresh like mints
But you will get pied like mince like BLAM!
You'll get a punch in the jaw like BLAM!
You'll have to get your jaw wired like BLAM!
You'll have no teeth left like
Well well well
