[Hook]
I'm the best, can you hear me
I'm the best rudeboy dont test me
Fam just rest before I fucking air out your whole chest

[Verse 1]
Arite check this
Buss up the rave with no set list
Everyone's crying stick to grime
You need a black eye but I don't want a wet fist
Before I get dissed, you have to walk 3 steps in my shoes
The difference between me and you is I do what I want and you want what I do
See, there's a big gap, the music your making I don't dig that
Put your CD in a bin bag, straight up and down, no zigzag
I don't wanna hear chitchat, shut ya mouth you need a big slap
I don't do hip-hop fam I do grime, but boy better know its a wrap

[Hook]
I'm the best, can you hear me
I'm the best rudeboy dont test me
Fam just rest before I fucking air out your whole chest

[Verse 2]
I'm the best, and so's he
I make big tunes, they're all moeshy
I had mushroom, I had fire power, I had feather now I'm on Yoshi
I'm an alien, I dunno what's going on in my cranium
Rah I write a sick bar you think I'm a star now I'm smooth sailing
Easy, cause I'm sick, everybody knows, I'm the shit
Your the smoke, your the smell, your a joke, so's your girl
Your broke I can tell, look at you coat, look at your nails
Its you I'm making a mock of it was me I'd tell you to fuck off

[Hook]
I'm the best, can you hear me
I'm the best rudeboy dont test me
Fam just rest before I fucking air out your whole chest

[Verse 3]
I'm just a badman over a good beat
It's either you I'm the best, or you think that I should be
Whagwarn for this doobsie
Don't get rude, I'll slap you so fast, nobody would see
Keep thinking everything's kushtie
You get bare uppercuts like footsie
IMac you're just a PC
I don't have to watch my back cause you can't see me fadc
Except for the female species
They watch me like satc
On road on on the TV screen
Old school like 28 BC

[Hook]
I'm the best, can you hear me
I'm the best rudeboy dont test me
Fam just rest before I fucking air out your whole chest

[Outro]
Thats it nothing left to say no comment
Rude Kid
Wow wow wow woooow
And then we hear that dagadagadagadagoooow
