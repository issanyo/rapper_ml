[Verse 1]
Fresh off the plane suitcase in my hand
It's time for the sun, sea and sand
Can't have the first night out on the town
I'm jet lagged so I need to lie down
Brand new day, brand new shades
Walking bare just smiling away
Listen to the drunken people singing
Listen to the laughs of the beautiful women
Trust me, this is what I call living
My afro's out so I can't go swimming
But I don't care I can still have a ball
Sit round the edge with my feet in the pool
Go have a drink and watch the sun set
And everybody knows what comes next
Yeah that's right you're all really nice
Now get ready for the night life

[Hook]
Sun, Sun, Sea and Sand
Sun, Sun, Sea and Sand
Sun, Sun, Sun, Sea and Sand
Sun, Sea and Sand

[Verse 2]
Wake up, wake up, in the hotel room
Mess everywhere sweep that with a broom
TV's on and the air con too
That's the reason you're feeling blue
Get up, get washed, get ready, get out
Spot a couple of your friends in the crowd
Listen to the names of the girls their laying
Listen to the games the girls are playing
Use protection you know what I'm saying
Bait face, gotta watch where I'm staying
But I don't care, I can still have fun
Cocktail bar, drinks for everyone
Take a sip and watch the sun set
And everybody knows what comes next
Yeah that's right you're all really nice
Now get ready for the night life

[Hook]
Sun, Sun, Sea and Sand
Sun, Sun, Sea and Sand
Sun, Sun, Sun, Sea and Sand
Sun, Sea and Sand


[Verse 3]
It's home time yeah, but I don't care
I don't wanna go I wanna stay right here, I swear
I'll stay till next year
Pass out right now on the deck chair
Final day, final rave
Dancing, drinking, smiling away
Listen yo the music Max is spinning
Listen to the kick and the snare drums hitting
Trust me bruv this is one of my rhythms
My last day, I should be chilling
But I don't care I'm a dance all night
Dance so much I might miss my flight
Get in a taxi, watch the sun set
And everybody knows what comes next
Get on the plane, turn off your phone
It's time to go home

[Outro]
