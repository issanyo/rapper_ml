You can't test my styley
Unless your name's Skepta or Wiley
Only the big names stand by me, LDN, you know where to find me
None of these labels can sign me, I'm too grimy
Plus no one ain't fucking with my P
See my bank statement and you'll whitey
Oh, I keep it 140, couple 138's but you ain't caught me
From Scotland right down to Torquay
See me on stage with Shorty
The girls get their phones out and record me, they wanna draw me
So they follow on Twitter and stalk me, they get air, so they block and report me
Ay, you can't miss me, if I'm not on Xbox 360
Then I'm cruising in my X6 G, not a Focus, 15 inch Ripspeed
Feds on road wanna shift me, they say I drive too quickly
So they take me to the side and frisk me, what's that gotta do with the speed limit please?
Ay!
(You can't test my styley,)
(You can't test my styley)
My supporters love me
When they see me on the street they hug me
Proper grippin' real tight like rugby
Starstruck stuttering and he’ll jumpy
No MC can ever cuss me
Trust me
What you know about 96 Fuckries
I can sell a few thousand comfy
Oh
Respect my family
Whether it’s James, Deshane or Andy
Listen carefully and understand me
You don’t wanna get these man angry
You get lamped in the head with the brandy
So fall back please
Couple tissues will come in handy
Don’t shit your panties
Ay!
I’m just Jamie
I ain’t changing love me or hate me
I am the meaning of Grime Daily
If I used to be your favourite reinstate me
Only a prick will not rate me
And slate me
But that same idiot will never face me
Or phase me
Ay!
You can’t test my styley
You can’t test my styley
Only the big names stand by me
Only the big names stand by me
None of these labels can sign me, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah
