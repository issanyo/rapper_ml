[Interlude 1: Jme & Jason Adenuga]
I don't care man
I ain't lying, I don't care man
I ain't...
Just say it wasn't you man
Nah man, I'm telling the truth
Just say you dunno who did it, you don't know who done it, just say it weren't you man
But I do know who done it what you talking about, imma tell the truth
I ain't lying
Lie innit
What am I gonna lie for, I ain't got nothing to hide

[Verse 1]
It all started off normal
No one was on a hype
But Skepta had a tool and all I had was a knife
I said I'm gonna tell the truth, but they all said I should lie
But i thought why the hell should I flippin' lie for I got nothing to hide
We was all getting ready yeah, I could feel it was gonna kick off
My patience was thin already as Skepta took his coat off
I think that's when it all started you know, the hype of Skepta’s head
And plus cause he had the tool in his hand, nothing needed to be said
All I heard was BANG! and I swear I heard something smashed
So I dropped the knife on the floor and I went to help Skepta 'cause I was baffed
But then when I got there, he was lying on the floor
And the whole place was a mess
There was a little bit of blood but i expected more
We all started arguing, as if that was gonna help the case
I was gonna call the ambulance but I didn't want it to escalate
Yeah I know it sounds a bit dumb, I really should have picked up the phone
But I knew that any minute now we was expecting you home

[Interlude 2: Jme & ]
Jamie…
Yes mum?
Is Junior alright?
Yeah he’s alright man
Put your brother on the phone for me please, let me speak to him
Nah he’s alright man he’s alright, it’s just a little cut
Have you called the police?
What are we calling the police for?

[Verse 2]
When I said Skepta had a tool, I didn't mean a gun, I meant a hammer
He was assembling your birthday present, he got you a wardrobe I got you a camera
Then Julie came home from Ikea, 'cause she went to get you a vase
And the reason I had a knife is cause I was cutting your cake in half
Then Skepta started getting all hyper, kept on mucking about with the tools
Then the hammer slipped from his hand and smashed the vase and scratched up your walls
That's when I heard the bang, I dropped the knife and went to go check
'Cause your surprise birthday party had turned into a wreck
Don't worry it was nothing major, Julie was a bit upset
And Skepta cut his finger, and the front room was a mess
That's when we started arguing, about who was in the wrong
But don't worry I’ll buy you a new vase, anyway happy birthday mum

[Interlude 3: Jme & Jason Adenuga]
