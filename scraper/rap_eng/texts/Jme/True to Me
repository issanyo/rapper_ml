[Verse 1: Manga Saint Hilare]
I take notes like robbing a bank
Watch and pattern and plan
Nu Brand Flexx like Boya and Sas
Man are like "yo, where'd you get that?"
Ready for the belly already, I am
On my next wave, I move and jab
They don't like me 'cause I stand
On my own two feet, don't move with gang (solo)
They start moving mad (and)
I swerve all that jazz (yes)
I know who I'm not (and)
I know what I am
They tried to stab me in the back
Karma's gonna get them back (cool)
I'm cool, I'm nice, I'm good
Still having a ball at 21 raps, but

[Chorus: Manga Saint Hilare]
I felt like they were using me
I'm not the same person that I used to be
You see what you choose to see
I lead, I never follow; I stay true to me
I felt like they were using me
I'm not the same person that I used to be
You see what you choose to see
I lead, I never follow; I stay true to me

[Verse 2: Jme]
I take notes like an Addison driver
Shake hands and tip man a fiver
Nu Brand Flexx like Boya and Striver
Man are like "yo, you look a bit wider"
Don't do chest and I don't do laps
Only on bench at the charity match
Dun know, man can still run a few laps
I'm a rudeboy, dan gorgon, daps, what?
Acting like Jme
Got some mad strong mentality
'Cause he don't drink and he don't smoke weed
I'm normal, you man are just weak, truss
Ain't no celebrity
Just 'cause man's got a little CD
You can see my life on the TV screen
I see my life from TPP, simple

[Chorus: Manga Saint Hilare]
I felt like they were using me
I'm not the same person that I used to be
You see what you choose to see
I lead, I never follow; I stay true to me
I felt like they were using me
I'm not the same person that I used to be
You see what you choose to see
I lead, I never follow; I stay true to me

[Break]
That means no more money comes and goes, and that
No, I was still splashing when I was getting five pound an hour! Ask J! Ask J! Ask J, bruv, I was splashing when I was getting five pound an hour. Splashing. Same way

[Verse 3: Frisco]
Frisco, I've got no behaviour (none)
Went from minor to major (oh, yeah)
They know I'm the creator
Man ah come through with assorted flavours
I've always stuck to my word, ask anyone (anyone)
Lyrical skeng, blast anyone (anyone)
I don't wanna battle with anyone
That's only 'cause I will lick down everyone
They're not about when the ting gets tekky (tekky)
Yo, darg, what happened to Wesley? (wah gwan?)
Still here holding the medi
And when I'm on the riddim, rough, rugged and ready
No procrastination, no propaganda
They can't manage my anger (sky)
Get rid of those that hold you down like an anchor
It's Jme, Big Fris and Manga

[Outro: Manga Saint Hilare]
I felt like they were (using me), I'm sure that they were (using me)
I know that they were (using me)
I felt like they were (using me), I'm sure that they were (using me)
I know that they were (using me)
I had to stay (true to me), I've gotta stay (true to me)
I need to stay (true to me)
I had to stay (true to me), I've gotta stay (true to me)
I need to stay (true to me)
