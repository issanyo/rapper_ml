[Verse 1]
It starts off like I get woken up, mum's going work
Brother's going school, I feel like dirt
Sixth
Waiting for results, how thrilling
Switch on my PC and cotch
I'll make another badboy tune now, watch
I might fling a shorty
And Tottenham's where you might find them, surely
Who's calling my house phone?
I don't care, I don't answer the house phone
Now private's calling my mobile
It's my mum's, workplace
Don't wanna talk about finding a job
A 9-to-5, are you mad? That's long
I don't care about the papes
Unless I'm getting paid the same as Bill Gates

[Hook]
I don't know if I'll reach that high
I don't know if I'll reach that high
Yeah, I doubt that I'll reach that high
But yeah, I hope that I'll reach that

[Verse 2]
It's half one, I'm still half-dead
A bit late, I ain't even had a bath yet
Let me sign on MSN quick time
If this girl's online, it ain't quick time
Yeah, I thought I need another half
Then it's BRB, I'm jumping in the bath
Who's at my door? This better be famble
It's bless, it's Gamble
Sign out, let me tidy my room
Bath, then I guess I'll be out in two
But my line starts belling again
It's private... must be my nan
Don't wanna talk about finding a job
A 9-to-5, are you mad? That's long
I don't care about the papes
Unless I'm getting paid the same as Bill Gates

[Hook]
I don't know if I'll reach that high
I don't know if I'll reach that high
Yeah, I doubt that I'll reach that high
But yeah, I hope that I'll reach that

[Verse 3]
I'm getting stressed now, what am I wearing?
I'm getting dressed and I swear I'm tearing
Forget jamming to hear two riddims
Being in here all day's like prison
Yeah, I'm in N18
But I told you before, I don't rep no games
Yeah, you might catch me round Tatum's
But I was born and bred in Leyton
I think I'mma sign out soon
Vibes and massive linkup soon
Might jam round Jme's room
And yeah, bring the gash round... ugh, my phone!
They wanna talk about finding a job
A 9-to-5, are you mad? That's long
I don't care about the papes
Ahh, seen, Dad, what's going on?

[Hook]
I don't know if I'll reach that high
I don't know if I'll reach that high
Yeah, I doubt that I'll reach that high
But yeah, I hope that I'll reach that
