[Verse 1: Jme]
Do I wanna spit a bar? Yes please
Do I wanna spit a bar? Yes please
When I'm on the mic I'm like an X6
When you're on the mic, you're like an X3
People think they can book one guy
From Boy Better Know and get the rest free
If I'm in a rave and I'm onstage
Promoters know I charge next P

[Hook: Jme & Tempa T]
Your CD is dead! Go get a day job instead!
Your CD is dead! Go get a day job instead!
Your CD is dead! Go get a day job instead!
Your CD is dead! Go get a day job instead!
Your CD is dead!
Go get a d-day job instead
Listen to Jme and Tempz
Go get a d-day job instead! (we told you)
Your CD is dead!
Go get a d-day job instead
Listen to Jme and Tempz
Go get a d-day job instead! (we told you)

[Verse 2: Tempa T]
You can't even chat to me (no)
You're not that guy on your team (sad)
I'm that guy in the scene (yep)
Come through with a bop and a lean (what?)
I make money on stage
Selling your CD's don't make P (splantz)
I'm just living my dream
I skank out when I make this P (left, right, up, down)

[Hook]
Your CD is dead! Go get a day job instead!

[Verse 3: Jme (Tempz)]
YO! Tempz and Jme (OK then)
On this ting blatantly (on this ting)
On TV you can see me (not them lot)
Dash your CD like a Frisbee (dash that blood)
YO! Jme and Tempa T (you can't par man)
Nobody wants your CD (buy my one)
Better buy mine from HMV (I done told you)
Don't let me see you hate on me (OK then)

[Hook: Jme & Tempa T]
