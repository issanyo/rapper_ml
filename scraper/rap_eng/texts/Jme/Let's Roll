[Verse 1: JME]
I don't know what mans sayin
Rags, same way I'mma keep sprayin
Told you before, jump online & check Deeco you know we ain't playin
If you didn't come out to rave? ...Come out to dance? Bruv, you better stay in
Not me cuz I'll roll thru your ends still
Got a t-shirt from Skepta "MENTAL!"
Bare albums on iTunes for sale
Pocket full of pinkys but Man ain't a girl
Don't run up ya mouth
You'll get a 2 foot drop kick like my name's Miguel
When the bassline drops in the rave it's every man for himself
Nobody is safe when I pick up the mic and say well well well!

[Verse 2: JME]
Yeh, Jamie's up in this bitch
Ima keep spittin' bars until I get a stitch
Keep spitting bars 'til I get the respect I deserve like Balotelli on the pitch
Nobody here with me you can move to
I notice anything unusual
Two of the mandem got beef?
Like I'm driving a manual downhill I'm neutral
Yeah, Jamie's up in this gaff
Ima keep spittin' bars til I get a grey 'tache
Thought they were runnin' this ting but I'm right behind and I will Ketchum like Ash
Lickle man ting like Fisher-Price skates
Ya whole crew needs a nappy change
Violate one of my guys then try chat to me?
Naaaah It's not happy days

[Hook]

[Verse 3: JME]
Yeh I get Black like Hollister
I'm the stereotype abolisher
For the past five years I been making bare paper call me the de-forester
Yeh I'll slide down the banister
Coz I'm gassed like a butane canister
You can't stand the heat?
Get the fuck out the kitchen "hasta la vista!"
Yeh, keep the bassline rolling
Straight gutter like I'm shit at bowling
I'm an MC so I'm mic controlling
If I say a shit bar? I'm TROLLING!
ShhHutYuhMuh when I'm speakin'
Don't follow nobody coz I'm leading
Thought I didn't want beef coz I'm vegan????
Deeeerkhead
(Well well well)
