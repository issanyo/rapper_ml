[Intro]
Yeah, truss
Shiny Charizard for life

[Verse 1]
(I wanna be the very best)
Just know when you see me you're looking at (the very best)
You could have ten Master Balls you still can't match (the very best)
Don't care about legendary birds, you can't attack (the very best)
Ash Ketchum catches them all but I only catch (the very best)

[Verse 2]
Yo, man try ask me "why Charizard?"
Man think I'm gonna shot my cards
Like I need p's
Man's gonna see them framed on the wall when I get my yard
Smile on my face just like Gengar
Think I'm new to this? Nah nah
Turn the clocks back go Wood Green tops
See me trading in Shekhana
I put the work in that's why I am (the very best)
Better move that link cable bro, you can't twang (the very best)
There ain't no fainting round here fam, my gang's (the very best)
I will drapes all your HP, that's why they call man (the very best)

[Verse 3]
Yo, talking like say you're gonna sky me
When I draw for the ball you'll be like "why me?"
Trust me cuz, one by one
I'll make all six of them whitey
Man's got Japanese and Chinese
Don't try tell me about shinies
Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt
Wore it with shorts and dry knees
I'mma old school bad man, always been (the very best)
You weren't around back then or you would've seen (the very best)
No Rare Candy needed for me to achieve (the very best)
If you're talking the first 151 then call me (the very best)

[Verse 4]
Yo, no bends or scratches on the top
And make sure none of them corners flop
If it looks brand new, shining, glistening
Then holla me and I might just cop
Rude boy come meet me at the shops
I got the gold vinyl, let's do swaps
Nostalgia from these base cards
So man's collecting and I ain't gonna stop
Try test me bruv and you will lose to (the very best)
BBK, yeah Boy Better Know my crew's (the very best)
Shadowless first edition, yep I choose (the very best)
Ask the whole of Pallet Town and they'll tell you who's (the very best)

[Verse 5]
Yo, started this thing in Meridian
Now man's in Viridian
Don't have to defeat nobody to get in the top tier
Cause I'm already in
Eeediot trainers wanna get rude
Runnin' up ya mouth cause you got Mew
Wow you got Mew, blood I got two Mews
And I've got Mewtwo, you will get moved to
