[Intro]
S'appenin bruv
S'poppin, yeah it's big still...

[Verse 1]
Lemme get my phone one sec, I wanna show everybody one text
This girl, she's on some next ting, she's on some dumb flex
Wait, there it is, read that
Now tell me she ain't a cat
Stupid headers, type the whole text in capital letters
She goes "JME, I know your not one of them bredda's
But your blankin' my calls, that's not wise, I know guys that hate you"
So? Probably the same guys that I hate too
She wants me to think, that I'm her one and only link
Like, the only person she's seeing
Come on, we're all human beings
I've known her for about 2 years, or 3? For time
And she still calls me Jme

[Hook]
They wanna know me cause I'm famous
They only like me cause I'm famous
The truth is I'm not even famous
These girls must be brainless
They wanna know me cause I'm famous
They only like me cause I'm famous
The truth is I'm not even famous
These girls must be brainless

[Verse 2]
Do you know what's funny?
It's not even the money
They think I think I'm a celebrity
Cause I got video's on tv
How many girls have said this to me
"Just because you're Jme, don't think that you can rer-ter-ter"
I give them pure air
No hype, their angry cause their not my type
White girls say I only like black girls, black girls say I only like white
I've had one girlfriend in my life
She taught me that they're all the same
Tell any girl that, and you'll get the same answer
Which proves what I'm saying
I dunno, one day I might find a girl, I ain't lookin'
I'm cool right now, I can do my own washin', do my own cookin'
I ain't gonna lie, sometimes you need a girl at night
To cuddle up to, so maybe I'll find one that's right...

[Hook]
They wanna know me cause I'm famous
They only like me cause I'm famous
The truth is I'm not even famous
These girls must be brainless
They wanna know me cause I'm famous
They only like me cause I'm famous
The truth is I'm not even famous
These girls must be brainless
They wanna know me cause I'm famous
They only like me cause I'm famous
The truth is I'm not even famous
These girls must be brainless
