[Intro: Jme]
Serious
Jme
Jme
Jme
21st century technology (serious, serious)
Mobile phones, Internet
It's not safe anymore
Big Brother's watching
Your phone's getting tapped (serious, serious)

[Hook: Jme]
In fact
Sometimes, I think back
Some days, I felt trapped
My line's been tapped
My line's been tapped (tapped)
Sometimes, I think back (serious)
Some days, I felt trapped (trapped)
My line's been tapped (serious)
In fact
Sometimes, I think back
Some days, I felt trapped
My line's been tapped
My line's been tapped (tapped)
Sometimes, I think back (serious)
Some days, I felt trapped (trapped)
My line's been tapped (serious)

[Verse 1: Jme]
Answer my phone, yeah, who's that?
Hello? Ain't you gonna chat?
I can't hear nothing, I've got a full battery
And reception, blud, holla back
I still can't hear jack
Yo, I don't know what's going on
I think maybe this phone is whack
Either that or my line's been tapped

[Hook: Jme]
In fact
Sometimes, I think back
Some days, I felt trapped
My line's been tapped
My line's been tapped (tapped)
Sometimes, I think back (serious)
Some days, I felt trapped (trapped)
My line's been tapped (serious)

[Verse 2: Jme]
It's like the Matrix, the system we're trapped in
I'll tell you but you won't ever listen
Until the day when you get attacked and
Some of your property goes missing
Feds on road, they use police tactics
To cut off the mandem on a mission
If they ever got your phone and they tapped it
Serious, you know that you're trapped in

[Hook: Jme]
In fact
Sometimes, I think back
Some days, I felt trapped
My line's been tapped
My line's been tapped (tapped)
Sometimes, I think back (serious)
Some days, I felt trapped (trapped)
My line's been tapped (serious)
In fact
Sometimes, I think back
Some days, I felt trapped
My line's been tapped
My line's been tapped (tapped)
Sometimes, I think back (serious)
Some days, I felt trapped (trapped)
My line's been tapped (serious)

[Verse 3: Jme]
Concentrate on Ps and stacking it
Forget all the heat and packing it
Bredrins backing it, cause all that stuff there
Will only take you back in it
You was in a cell, now you're back in it
And nobody's got your back
You're on your own, lying on your back
Police have got your phone and they're tapping it

[Outro: Jme]
Jme
Hold tight Skream on production, yeah?
Hold tight Skepta, going out to Wiley
Hold tight the Boy Better Know camp, Roll Deep
Serious, serious
