[Pre-Hook: Donae'o]
I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge
I've got a hell of a pride and one ego
And demons I deal with inside
I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge
I've got a hell of a pride and one ego
And demons I deal with

[Hook: Donae'o & Jme]
So man ah wear black, man ah wear black
Man ah wear, man ah wear, man ah wear black
Manaman ah wear black (that's why)
Manaman ah wear black
Man ah wear black, man ah wear black
Man ah wear, man ah wear, man ah wear black
Manaman ah wear black (that's why)
Manaman ah wear black, yeah

[Verse 1: Donae'o]
Man ah mek the king kong bangers
Guerrilla warfare, all-year bangers
And when you're going on hype and savage
What a man don't know but you'll soon find
That number one spot comes with baggage
Everybody want a piece of your gassage
Some man ah add to your ting
Other man ah cause bare damage
And they say I'm a madman 'cause I don't have it
Yeah, I might be a nerd but I back it
And you're telling people that I'm ratchet
But you never tell people you started the beef
And I had to end it rapid (always the fucking case)
Bare bullies in the industry and they're willing to test it
And when you don't back down, that's a next ting

[Pre-Hook: Donae'o]
I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge
I've got a hell of a pride and one ego
And demons I deal with inside
I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge
I've got a hell of a pride and one ego
And demons I deal with

[Hook: Donae'o & Jme]
So man ah wear black, man ah wear black
Man ah wear, man ah wear, man ah wear black
Manaman ah wear black (that's why)

Man ah wear, man ah wear, man ah wear black
Manaman ah wear black (that's why)
Manaman ah wear black, yeah

[Verse 2: Jme]
I protect my energy
See me in'na Nike shorts and a tee
Used to have the colourful Air Max
Now I'm bussing the black SCs on my feet, like
I protect my energy
Pricks cannot socialise with me
Nowadays, you'll see me with the same dons
Like man's playing for Milton Keynes, like
I protect my energy
Hit 'em with the black whip, black tint, black seats
Don't wanna talk so I stay blacked out
I'm a black male so you can't blackmail me, like
I protect my energy
So man ah wear what man are seeing on the street
In the manor where it gets peak
So I keep man aware of these tings on the beat, like

[Pre-Hook: Donae'o]
I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge
I've got a hell of a pride and one ego
And demons I deal with inside
I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge
I've got a hell of a pride and one ego
And demons I deal with

[Hook: Donae'o & Jme]
So man ah wear black, man ah wear black
Man ah wear, man ah wear, man ah wear black
Manaman ah wear black (that's why)
Manaman ah wear black

Man ah wear, man ah wear, man ah wear black
Manaman ah wear black (that's why)
Manaman ah wear black, yeah

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
Yeah, I wear black cause I'm lazy
I wear black cause I'm shady
I wore black on a creep with your lady
Black tints in an all-black Mercedes, getting wavey
A couple man tried play me
I blacked out and went crazy
You can't phase me
Don't wanna hear about black man time
If you owe, you better pay me
You better act like you rate me
Don't wanna be on my blacklist
Don't wanna see the end of my black fist, I preach what I practice
Don't get caught in the blackness, better take note
Of the words coming out of my black lips
Looking for a black chick with the fat hips
To bend over and do backflips
She ain't gotta be an actress
Just know she ain't seeing the baptist
You're dealing with Raskit, the fact is

[Pre-Hook: Donae'o]
I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge
I've got a hell of a pride and one ego
And demons I deal with inside
I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge
I've got a hell of a pride and one ego
And demons I deal with

[Hook: Donae'o & Jme]
So man ah wear black, man ah wear black
Man ah wear, man ah wear, man ah wear black
Manaman ah wear black (that's why)
Manaman ah wear black
Man ah wear black, man ah wear black
Man ah wear, man ah wear, man ah wear black
Manaman ah wear black (that's why)
Manaman ah wear black, yeah
