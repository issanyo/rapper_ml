Yo...
Dance
It's not about shanks all the time
Grab a girl and skank from behind
Everybody thinks to MC good
Your lyrics must be about livin' in the 'hood
Causin a racket, causin a noise
Not enough females, too many boys
Just dance on your heel and toe
Dance 'till you get an ASBO
Put your hands at eye level
Elbows out, but be careful
Move 'em up and down with your knees
And lean forward 20 degrees
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
I don't care what you think
If you can't dance, go have a drink
Plasticman's giving you the chance
Everybody please, shutup and dance
I don't care what you think
If you can't dance, go have a drink
Plasticman's giving you the chance
Everybody please, shutup and dance
And dance
And move
And dance
And move
And dance
And move
And dance
And move

And dance
And move
And dance
And move
And dance
And move
And dance
And move
And dance

Take a rest
Cause sweats coming through your dress
Gather all your friends and find
Your way to the bar, it's beverage time
Get drunk on stellas, red stripes or the ones
With umbrellas
Don't worry if you can't drink more
Find your way back to the dancefloor

Put your hands at eye level
Elbows out, but be careful
Move 'em up and down with your knees
And lean forward 20 degrees
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance

I don't care what you think
If you can't dance, go have a drink
Plasticman's giving you the chance
Everybody please, shutup and dance
I don't care what you think
If you can't dance, go have a drink
Plasticman's giving you the chance
Everybody please, shutup and dance
And dance
And move
And dance
And move
And dance
And move
And dance
And move
And dance

Be careful who u chat to on the email
It's a picture of a girl, but it's a shemale
I don't care if ur samantha mumba
I still won't give out my number
Only if I see her chest and bumpa live
Or On the webcamera
If I want to, I'll give up my O2
If she's older, I'll give up my Voda
See I got bare phones, I take the mick
I still dont know what facebook is
I'm messing about, talk to me
I'll be on MSN at about quarter to 3
It's Jamie, add my Hotmail
Girls on MSN think I'm a hot male
What, you think I can't get girls?
Haha, very funny, L-O-L
I don't care what you think
If you can't dance, go have a drink
Plasticman's giving you the chance
Everybody please, shutup and dance
I don't care what you think
If you can't dance, go have a drink
Plasticman's giving you the chance
Everybody please, shutup and dance

Put your hands at eye level
Elbows out, but be careful
Move 'em up and down with your knees
And lean forward 20 degrees
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
And move to the beat
And dance
