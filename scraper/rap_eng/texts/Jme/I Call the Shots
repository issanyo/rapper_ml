[Verse 1: Wiley]
Hard luck
You tested me and found out that my Starbucks
I've got the tips you need for when you start up
Cah my flows dem are sharp like sharper than
When a man goes to the barbers to get a mark up
Pull up to the club door, ain't gotta park up
You got a fly on your neck, you're hark up
Want to hear me sarcastic? Let me sark up
Like, I ain't done shit for grime, I'm washed up
Couldn't afford to pay me, what I would cost ya
I move priceless
'Cause I know the talent God gave me was a niceness
Something you can vibe with
Jungle and grime like a boxing and MMA hybrid
No mountain too high for me to climb it
You got a career in England?
Didn't know Kylea designed it and then he refined it

[Chorus: Wiley]
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I got the vibe like I told you before
Manna done lots
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I was a young boss, learned from the best
Now I call the shots

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Chasing numbers and views, I forgot about the vibe
Content, flows, I forgot about the mic
All of the things that keep your name ringing
When all of the fans of your song start singing
I said it before: I got sidetracked
I realised, had to bring the vibe back
I'm playing my role and that's a bossy one
In my twenties, used to be a flossy one
I call the shots
But I don't send man to the shop
Back with another one, ready or not
You might stream this song much on Apple or Spotify
Add to my numbers, I'm hot
You're gonna see me in a league, at the top
And you're gonna see me roll out in a team top
Normal, no twistin' the plot

[Chorus: Wiley]
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I got the vibe like I told you before
Manna done lots
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I was a young boss, learned from the best
Now I call the shots

[Verse 3: Jme]
Serious, manna been calling shots
Since walking to school, morning bops
Talking to all my bredrins 'bout where
Manaman's gonna take touring stops
Boss, 'nuff said
Won't stop working till I drop dead
When I call the shots, bullshit stops
I make everybody fix up like Ofsted
There ain't no one above
So you can't extort no one I love
Or I start moving like my bruv
Anytime you see me wearing a glove
Boastin' because you got a start button
Man like me, I don't push no button
Walk to the door, jump in the whip
Foot on the pedal, gone, say nothing

[Chorus: Wiley]
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I got the vibe like I told you before
Manna done lots
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I was a young boss, learned from the best
Now I call the shots
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I got the vibe like I told you before
Manna done lots
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I was a young boss, learned from the best
Now I call the shots

[Verse 4: Wiley]
Goldmine in the Middle-East, beast
Work every day of the week, I'm at peace
Don't get in no more trouble with the police
I don't really want my life on lease
Mind all grown so the path is clear
Changed from a yout when I didn't want to care
Now I've got a good understanding
Brace yourself when you hear I've got an album landing
Man are soundman like Rampage
Man are soundman like Stone Love
Got my own dubs, got my own dubs
And I got brand new ones plus manna got old dubs
BBK is the squad
Without us, tings would be odd
Yeah, we're on another page
O2, manna headline stage

[Chorus: Wiley]
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I got the vibe like I told you before
Manna done lots
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I was a young boss, learned from the best
Now I call the shots
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I got the vibe like I told you before
Manna done lots
You know what? (what?)
I call the shots
I was a young boss, learned from the best
Now I call the shots
