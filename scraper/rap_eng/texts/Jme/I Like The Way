[Verse]
I like the way she moves
She does get right down to the drop and move her body (her)
Even if the dance floor is empty she don't really care 'bout anybody (her)
And she does move to the left, and she does move to the right
And she does dance all day, and she does dance all night
And when the music's playing, she does shake it right
And she bumper starts dancing
She does dance all night (night, night)
I like the way she moves your body (I like the way she moves)
I like the way she dance so sexy (I like the way she dance)
I like the way she moves your body (I like the way she moves)
I like the way she dance so sexy (I like the way she dance)
Can't watch no more I get a likkle feeling everytime I see her body (her)
This time I want to make sure I get a likkle whine off this cutie (her)
And she does move to the left, and she does move to the right
And she does dance all day, and she does dance all night
And when the music's playing, she does shake it right
And she bumper starts dancing
She does dance all night (night, night)
I like the way she moves your body (I like the way she moves)
I like the way she dance so sexy (I like the way she dance)
I like the way she moves your body (I like the way she moves)
I like the way she dance so sexy (I like the way she dance)
I like the way she moves your body (I like the way she moves)
I like the way she dance so sexy (I like the way she dance)
I like the way she moves your body (I like the way she moves)
I like the way she dance so sexy (I like the way she dance)
I like the way she moves
She does get right down to the drop and move her body (her)
Even if the dance floor is empty she don't really care 'bout anybody (her)
And she does move to the left, and she does move to the right
And she does dance all day, and she does dance all night
And when the music's playing, she does shake it right
And she bumper starts dancing
She does dance all night (night, night)
