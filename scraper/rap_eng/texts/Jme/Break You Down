They wanna break you down
They wanna break you down
They wanna break you down
They wanna break you down

[Verse 1: Jme]
I stick to my guns
Try test me on my ones
I'll burn man with the fire of a million suns
Break who down?
Which Jme? Which place? Which town?
With me, there's no compromise
It's my way or everything dies
Cut off my nose to spite my face
And I'll cut off your tongue to spite your taste
Man can't break me down on this grind
Take all my secrets to the grave
Keep all my secrets till I die
Torture man, I still won't talk to man
Or shed a tear from my eye
I keep it real, I won't tell nobody
I won't even tell the time

[Verse 2: Big Narstie]
Man can't break me
Utmost respect, man rate me
Man ain't no drink, man can't shake me
I am a silverback, I will go ape, G
Know that it's scene, know that I'm gassed
Blud, there is no escape, G
45, no safety
I will leave heads and brains see,  so
N dot A dot base, R dot S dot base
T dot I dot base, Boy Better Know I'm coming with base
N dot A dot base, R dot S dot base
T dot I dot base, Boy better Know I'm coming with base

[Verse 3: Jme]
So what? You think man's an idiot, yeah?
Violate, think I didn't see that, yeah?
Don't try test the waters round here, fam
This ain't a baby's bottle
Man's in cruise control, no throttle
Furthermore, I'll push them revs to the red
Break? Who dat you ain't breaking shit
You better mind that I don't break man's head

[Verse 4: Big Narstie]
Yeah, cause man said watch
So I looked at my watch
I told man watch this
Bang man in the face
Bang man in the face
Bang man in the face
Bang man in the face
Bang man in the face

[Verse 5: Jme]
You can't face me
Throw tea in your face if you're facety
These idiots wanna act rough
Why? Blatantly
On a normal day outside JD
You're sitting at bus stops with old ladies
When I come around, they try to wreck
Bruh, you best watch where you step

[Verse 6: Big Narstie]
Man stepped on my creps
I looked at my creps
I was over mad
Kicked man in the face
Kicked man in the face
Kicked man in the face
Kicked man in the face
Baterscooter!
