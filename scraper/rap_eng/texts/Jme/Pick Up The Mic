[Intro]
Yeah safe you know what I'm saying bruv
Blud, in the UK we make Grime music yeah
Grime music bruv it's not like Pop music
There's no rehearsals, there ain't no dress rehearsals
And like stage plan and stuff
You know what I'm saying we've just got lyrics
We've got a beat, we've just got to mash up the mic bruv
All you've gotta do is just pick up the mic and spray

[Chorus]
Pick up the mic and spray
Pick up, pick up the mic, the mic
Pick up the mic and spray (the mic, the mic)
Pick up, pick up the mic, pick up, pick up
Pick up, pick up the mic, the mic
Pick up the mic and spray (the mic, the mic)
Pick up, pick up the mic, pick up, pick up

[Verse 1]
It's Jme, the grime scene dweller
The online MP3 seller
The 100% true lyric teller
Hand on the bible, spit accapella
I need listeners, you need a smeller
Cause your music stinks
Bite my flow and catch salmonella
Or get beat box like Killa Kella
Pub man ting, widda Stella
Left hook, top lip sweller
Wobbly tooth, bare Bonjela
My wallet is like a cheese sandwich
'Cause first I put in the bread
And on top of that I put cheddar
And on top of that we're OGz
Don't believe me, ask Mellor

[Chorus]
Pick up the mic and spray
Pick up, pick up the mic and sp-
Pick, pick, pick up the mic and spray (the mic, the mic)
Pick up, pick up the mic, pick up, pick up
Pick up the mic and spray
Pick up, pick up the mic and sp-
Pick, pick, pick up the mic and spray (the mic, the mic)
Pick up, pick up the mic, pick up, pick up

[Verse 2]
It's Jme, the grime ambassador
The badboy MP3 trafficker
If you spit acid, I spit acid-er
You get popped like Pringles paprika
You won't spray, man you're a panicker
Can't chase my status with no stamina
You get a Texas Chainsaw Massacre
Modern Warfare silenced Raffica
No chaps, no chain, no manager
Somehow still you're not in my caliber
My lyrics are so detailed
As if I made them with a lens and an aperture
Professional, not amateur
'Cause I work all night like Dracula
If two of my friends argue, I'm on both sides like the A's in Africa

[Chorus]
Pick up the mic and spray
Pick up, pick up the mic and sp-
Pick, pick, pick up the mic and spray (the mic, the mic)
Pick up, pick up the mic, pick up, pick up
Pick up the mic and spray
Pick up, pick up the mic and sp-
Pick, pick, pick up the mic and spray (the mic, the mic)
Pick up, pick up the mic, pick up, pick up

[Verse 3]
Go home, look in the mirror
Realise no one's scared
You tried to diss me, no one cared
When you came radio, no one tared
You're not hench, you're not bad
You just screw up your face all weird
Tryna get hype off me you get air
Tryna get hype... you get air!
You jumped out the whip, no one ran
Nobody cares what you got in your hand
Nobody cares what you got in your jeans
I'll slap you so hard I'll crack your phone screen, yo
Don't bring war to the king
Don't tell me about draw for the ting, yo
Right about now, your heads so big
You get charged more for your trim, safe!
