Wait one second leme spark this youth
Nah wait he's hench let me spud this youth
Roll up calm on the 182
But if my P's calm then I'm catching tube
I'm swell with the kicks that I'm copping
Cos my deet games calm ask Tosin
Hashtag AC, hashtag road man. What's the last one, yeah hashtag fraud man
Feds should've caught man
I don't buy out the bar
Only red bull's what I buy at the bar
Walk in the rave, couple G's in the place. No P's to get waved but we're still by the bar
Tap water's what I drink at the bar
Nah wait put ice so it looks like vodka
Churps couple chicks like oi rude girl, this rental weren't cheap so get in the car

See the light skin girls used to cuss me
Now these light skin girls still cuss me
Man I'm so done being ugly
Being clapped ain't the one man trust me
My brudda try say that'll he'll buss me
Then I end up in a broth on a fuckery
But my looks don't say too much so none of them girls in the placed tried to fuck me

If you got a c-a-r then you're bless
Oh you don't, ok next
I only churps chicks that have got whips...

The names Squeezo, big Squeeze
I like nandos, Mc Ds
I spent a couple pound on some sweets
See me roll with slides on my feet
Squeezo's shit, Squeezo's clapped
Squeezo's lips, Kinda fat
Squeezo's nostril's a little bit flat
But it's calm cos my mum still thinks I'm the man little nigga
