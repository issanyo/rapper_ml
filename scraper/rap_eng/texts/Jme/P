[Hook]
P! What makes the world go round?
P! What turns your frown upside down?
P! And that's why I just wanna make P!
What can get you a house out of town?
P! What makes the world go round?
P!What turns your frown upside down?
P! And that's why I just wanna make P!

[Verse 1]
Oh please!
JME don’t smoke no cigarettes
JME don’t smoke no trees
JME gets dark like silhouettes
Other MCs cannot believe
JME's making so much P outta this game
Is he a cheat? We're making bills, he's making Gs
Oh please!
JME ain't your local dealer
JME don’t sell no keys
JME don’t put food in the sealer
Because I'm shotting them T’s
I'm making so much P
It’s the big flip can't you see?
You're making bills I'm making Gs

[Bridge]
What makes the world go round? P!
What turns your frown upside down? P!
And that’s why I just wanna make P!

[Verse 2]
Oh please, JME ain't even famous
JME ain't on TV
JME got so much status, you know why?
Cause he can see
The big picture, so much P
Got his whip, got his degree
We're making bills, he's making Gs
Oh please!
JME don’t roll with idiots
JME only rolls with Gs
JME's been big from Meridian
Yeah, its because I can see
The big picture, so much P
I take the mick! I take the P
You're making bills, I'm making Gs

[Hook]
P! What makes the world go round?
P! What turns your frown upside down?
P! And that's why I just wanna make P!
What can get you a house out of town?
P! What makes the world go round?
P!What turns your frown upside down?
P! And that's why I just wanna make P!

[Verse 3]
My t-shirt is better than yours, My t-shirt is better than yours
My t-shirt's folded neatly in the drawer
But when I spill a drink your t-shirt mops the floor
Let's play a game like Saw
Walk down the street
Every time you see a Boy Better Know tee
Slap yourself in the jaw
When you get home, your face is sore
Can't even feel your hand any more
So many t-shirts, so many slaps
There's no way that I can be poor
Your hand is dripping with blood
Its red raw, it's your own fault
Cause your face would've been half-blessed
If you woulda' stopped looking down at your own chest

[Hook]
P! What makes the world go round?
P! What turns your frown upside down?
P! And that's why I just wanna make P!
What can get you a house out of town?
P! What makes the world go round?
P! What turns your frown upside down?
P! And that's why I just wanna make P!
