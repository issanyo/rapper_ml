[Intro]
Yeah, it's Big H
Hold tight all the family, yeah
Boy Better Know
It's a serious ting, Meridian ting
Hold tight Bossy, back out the can
Yeah, hold tight Youngblood

[Verse 1]
Cause I've got guns, straps, hundreds of cats
Can't see me, nah, I cotch in the flats
Bun a CD, yeah, whip a couple tracks
Take two draw of the zoot and relax
Tell the truth, you're a fass
See you dress up in a suit for the gash
Funny what some man do for the cash
Me, I spray your whole crew with the gas cause
These MCs ain't done what I did
Dem likkle bars, they're not big
I know where all these MCs live
So if they try a ting, I will come to their crib
How can I MC with him?
I don't really care what crew he's in
Draw for the strap, won't do a thing
I don't wanna hear that song dem a sing

[Bridge]
Any funny business, everybody dead
I said any funny business, everybody dead
Ten gunshot man a send to your head
I said ten gunshot man a send to your head
Any funny business, everybody dead
I said any funny business, everybody dead
Ten gunshot man a send to your head
I said ten gunshot man a send to your head

[Verse 2]
Cause I'm kinda cold
Grew up on frontline, dem kind of road
No, I don't spit grime, dem sound are old
I don't care about the records that you've sold
You man are eediats, stand up there and pose
And just screaming shots at your clothes
You ain't seen the straps man a hold
Yeah, man are badman, real ice cold
Focused, always got my eyes on the prize
Man get shook when they see me arrive
Don't worry, people, I will survive
Have a quick drink, jump in the car and drive
Man said he boyed me, that boy lied
I know man's everywhere, so he can't hide
You're not real so you can't ride
I can't believe what the eediat tried

[Hook]
Stand back, draw for the strap
World War business, time to attack
I don't wanna kill an MC on the track
I said I don't wanna kill an MC on the track
Stand back, draw for the strap
World War business, time to attack
I don't wanna kill an MC on the track
I said I don't wanna kill an MC on the track, but

[Verse 3]
What's this MC on?
Don't this guy know MCing's long?
I don't wanna hear an MC sing a song
I don't even know where these man are from
What, blud? Who is he?
Some likkle batty boy, don't you agree?
Top of the billboards, he won't see
Might as well give out his music for free
Cuh I don't chat skippiness, I only chat sense
Dem boy stupid, don't chat sense
Can't diss H, H is hench
Do some weights or self-defence
You ain't got no strength
Try test me? That don't make sense
Look at my bredrins, they're all hench
Watch an MC get fling in the fence

[Hook]
Stand back, draw for the strap
World War business, time to attack
I don't wanna kill an MC on the track
I said I don't wanna kill an MC on the track
Stand back, draw for the strap
World War business, time to attack
I don't wanna kill an MC on the track
I said I don't wanna kill an MC on the track
