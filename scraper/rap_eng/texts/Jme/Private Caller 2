[Intro: Skepta]
Yeah, 2005, it's Part Two Private Caller 2
Boy Better Know Records, MastaBeatz
We gave you a sample before now you're getting the whole P4
On the table, get the pipes out, get the gauzes
Blast it! Cookie blast it

[Verse 1: Cookie]
Boy, boy, boy realise that I move with real guys no lies
I can see in your eyes that you're scared
But I don't see why
No tool in my hands today but I still ain't the man to play with
I ain't got a gun to spray with so I say this
I hold a shank so I'll say this

[Verse 2: President T]
Private Caller, they wanna see me get poorer
I don't even think they heard the word baller
They're too small in the game
And they ain't getting no taller
President T makes all kind of MCs who look small
Look very smaller
So next time you call on private number
I'll put you six feet under

[Verse 3: Jme]
Blud! You've been smoking the rocks again
Bare [?] getting bare oxygen
'Cause Jme mic controller turned into Jme air vent installer
And I got bare ammo like Smarties
Install air vents in your arteries
If you run, AIR VENT IN YOUR CREPS
Jme delivering air to your doorstep

[Verse 4: Frisco]
Frisco, I can see them watching and clocking
But I ain't stopping and flopping
Think I need P's so I start shotting
Every now and then I'll do a little bit of robbing
But I'm starving, I'm hungry
When I get hungry, I get grumpy
When I'm grumpy, I settle things with my pumpy
Blaze them up like skunky

[Verse 5: Meridian Dan]
Dan, yeah, out of Meridian
Dan, top stylie I fling them man
Don't eat pussy, Dan don't yam
I go abroad for dough that's the plan
Fly out for business, don't need a tan
Drive any car, don't care about a ban
Feds 'have to catch me with a red hand
But they can't catch Dan

[Verse 6: Scorcher]
Scorcher, more time I don't even answer the phone
When I look and see 'private caller'
Probably a wasteman, don't wanna face man
True say he knows that I ain't no tool
On a hype ting but, if man are gangsta
Come and link him right now on the corner
But he ain't there so, when I see him
I'm gonna pick out the ting like Luke Skywalker

[Verse 7: Skepta]
Might see Dan with Skepta
Might see me with Jme on 1Xtra
Might see me with Scorcher in a Vectra
Might see me with President and Dexter
In West End searching for some pussy
Might see me in a Peugeot with Cookie
Might see me visiting Bossman Birds
Might see me with Big H in a bookies

[Verse 8: Cell 22]
Private Caller, talk to Tony I [?]
I don't wanna hear a piece of the convo let alone all of it
If you're [?] forget it, leave a message
Now you need credit
Private Callers they're all pathetic
They know me from where? Blud don't bread it
Me and them ain't friends so why do they beg it

[Verse 9: Dimples]
And then I'm back like Arnold
I'm in fifth gear you're in first like your car's stalled
Spend days wrapping parcels
And you know I get Shady like 50 and Marshall
It's no lie yeah I'm partial
Got a big bag of weed, head Dizzee like Rascal
[?]
And if I'm in your ends you know I just pass through

[Verse 10: Danny B]
Press 1 4 1 when you're calling my details
You can be male or a female
You can be helping my weed sales
You will get V-O-I-C-E-Mail
Danny B I'm an IC3 male
Can't see I'm a G then you can't see well
Anyway, talk's not cheap
That's why I'm getting all these private calls off people

[Outro: Skepta}
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah0
(what) (2005)
That's Part 2
Flippin' hell man
I might even do a part 3 man I'm just thinking
I just might do it
What the hell
You get me Meridian (I might not)
Boy Better Know Records, MastaBeatz (you get me family)
I keep giving the hits, keep putting the hits on the table
(Yes family!)
2005 (2005)
Make sure you go out and cop Jme's album
(Kill off killy!)
