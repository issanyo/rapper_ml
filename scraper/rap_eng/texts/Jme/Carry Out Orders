[Chorus]
Carry out orders given by the boss, until you get pissed off
When you realise you can do your own ting
That's when you might leave in a huff
One day I'm gonna be my own boss
I'll tell you when I've had enough
I know the name of the game is making money
Stop wasting time and make some money

[Verse 1: Wiley]
Oi Richard the floor needs sweeping (Okay boss)
Now stack some shelves (Okay)
Richard we need more chips (Okay)
By now you must know mans pissed but I'm still doing it
Till one day I loose my rag and walk out
Whats one of them talents I had that music ting
I can make beats and I can chat, i wanna be on the map
Step 1 get a grip take over control the movement
Cos there's always room for improvement
People give up if they start losing
Pick myself up and i keep it moving
You don't know what your doin'
You think you bring 2 in
I don't see you in, the dances I'm doin'
You won't do a booking with roll deep
Its cool cos i still get bookings

[Chorus]
Carry out orders given by the boss, until you get pissed off
When you realise you can do your own ting
That's when you might leave in a huff
One day I'm gonna be my own boss
I'll tell you when I've had enough
I know the name of the game is making money
Stop wasting time and make some money

[Verse 2: Jme]
Jamie get to work
(Nah man, I can do what I want
Yeah I know your the boss and all that but...)
That's right do you want to keep your job
(Yeah course, I'm only human)
Look shut up, there's work that needs doing
(Nah fam asking me nicely you want work done ask politely
Nah blud cos man ain't an eediet
You're the boss but you're a bit to bossy
Bullying me ain't gonna make me work properly)
Look Jamie, shut up
If your not gonna work, I don't really mind
Go home and wait for your P45
Get out
(Oh my god that's it you know what boss, I quit)

[Chorus]
Carry out orders given by the boss, until you get pissed off
When you realise you can do your own ting
That's when you might leave in a huff
One day I'm gonna be my own boss
I'll tell you when I've had enough
I know the name of the game is making money
Stop wasting time and make some money
