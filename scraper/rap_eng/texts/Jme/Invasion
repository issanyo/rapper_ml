[Hook: Frisco]
It's an invasion, it's an invasion
It's an invasion, it's an invasion
It's an invasion, it's an invasion
It's an invasion, truss

[Verse 1: Frisco]
From the day that I came here backs to the wall, working my brain
Boy Better Know be the family, better know that you can't come and try break this chain here
Wait there, it's an invasion
Boy Better Know everything, CDs, T-shirts, SIM cards
You can't tell Boy Better Know anything
Actually chat to me, get back to me
Naturally, I'm badder than most
Niggas in the backroom bagging up o's
All over the UK bagging up shows
You man are moist, you man are damp
Hang them man out to dry like a clothesline
You'll get the dial tone quick for trying to chat shit on my Boy Better Know line

[Verse 2: Jme]
From Boy Better Know touchdown, everything gets enhanced
New shit, new money, new lyrics for the mandem to light up a dance
Trust me, this ain't no act
Look around you fam, it's live
So when I say Boy Better Know invasion, I don't have to tell you twice
Watch me invade, put a BBK sim in your sim tray
Run man over in the beamer, get hit with a whip like Kunta Kinte
I make you forget your name, Toby getting paranormal [?]
Doing this ting from 966 TDK 90 minute takes

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Â£100,000 is what they gave me
100 flows and they're all mine
100 fake niggas in rap, 100 broke niggas in grime
I've been to jail in foreign countries, nobody here can tell me about crime
'Cause if I send a Boy Better Know group text, trust me it's invasion time
So when I say it's on, then it's on nigga
Ring the doorbell like ding dong nigga
You don't want to hear the straps sing a song nigga
Leave a dead body like a stink bomb nigga
I stay low, I'm a ping pong nigga
But still I ball out like Frimpong nigga
Been around the world, that's why I've got a carbon footprint bigger than King Kong nigga

[Hook: Frisco]
It's an invasion, it's an invasion
It's an invasion, it's an invasion
It's an invasion, it's an invasion
It's an invasion, truss
