[Verse 1]
I'm a ghetto superstar
I've loved music since I was three
I was brought up in England slums
So you definitely can't take the hood from me, trust me
I'm used to coming home late after school, puffing
Listening to Roll Deep tapes on my wall, it's nothing
Now I've made the tapes become real life cause
If there's a Roll Deep rave, I'm inside, bruv
Don't watch that guy in the corner looking at my face
I know the bouncers get me and I've got my shank in my waist

Ghetto superstar
Ghetto superstar (I'm a ghetto superstar)

[Verse 2]
I'm getting older now, but I'm still advanced for my age
And I think it's about time that I am the star on that stage, I swear
Last week, I did a video shoot with Scorcher and T, yeah
Green screen, when it comes out, look hard and you'll see me there
But I don't wanna be that extra person in the vid
I'm a superstar, book me and pay me 500 quid, straight
I wanna roll round in a tinted limousine
Right now, gotta settle with the tinted screen
Of my Punto, no qualms, it's all good though
Cause I'm repping my ends and all the mandem from the hood know
You can't come round here, I'm an MC
But don't get it twisted, I will still kill like 50

[Hook]
Ghetto superstar
Ghetto superstar (I'm a ghetto superstar)

[Verse 3]
Blud, I'm a ghetto superstar
I do music but I'm still street
That's how I roll, I've got a chaps, chain, phone, dough
And all of the mandem know I'm on show
Look who's in my ends
It's that prick from the Roll Deep rave
With my blade, he's gonna get
More than a quick close shave
Now I've done the crime
I've gotta face the court case
Oh my days, not even I
Knew it would be this grave
The court case ain't looking too good
Right now I wanna die
Rah, mum, don't cry
You know why?

[Hook]
I'm a ghetto superstar
Ghetto superstar (I'm a ghetto superstar)

[Verse 4]
So now I'm locked up
And it's a joke cause I don't care
Watch, I'm counting down the days
Till I get out of here
Then I'mma write lyrics about it
Like Ghetto did
So all them other kids
Can be like me

[Hook]
Ghetto superstar
Ghetto superstar (I'm a ghetto superstar)
Ghetto superstar
Ghetto superstar
