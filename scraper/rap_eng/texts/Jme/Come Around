[Verse 1: Lay-Z]
I ain't got time to listen to a likkle man's chat
If you wanna try send for a lord of the mic
Make sure you can order the lobster first
Otherwise, you can take your likkle dubs back
My likkle darg's strapped with the ting
This ain't checkers, you little pawns can't ramp with the king
Fly? You niggas can't ramp on my wing, watch
Think you're a badman? Alright, watch
Man will get jacked for his chain and watch
Wanna try jam in this game and cotch?
Now I'm sat in the number one spot
I'm a deep MC, what'd you mean?
Kill a man with a super beat sixteen
None of my mandem act in the scene
No Weezy babies can't eff with the team

[Hook: Lay-Z]
So when us man come around
The whole place get shut down
Your likkle dargs ain't known in my ends
But our names ringing all over your town
So when us man come around
The whole place get shut down
Your likkle dargs ain't known in my ends
But our names ringing all over your town

[Verse 2: Jme]
I see guys flexing on TV
They ain't got style, they've got a stylist
The hat that you see on my head right now is a moesh
You can't buy this
When I flex exclusive crep, man look upset
Crisis
I feel inspired when I look in the mirror
You just look tired when you look in the mirror
35, still living with your parents and you're raving?
Failure
Man try say Skeppy can't say bloodclart
Cause he's not from Jamaica
What? I don't know wha happen fi dem pussyholes
When I come around, they're like "wah gwan, yo?"
I told them Boy Better Know, Boy Better Know
I'll tell them again, Boy Better fucking Know

[Hook: Lay-Z]
So when us man come around
The whole place get shut down
Your likkle dargs ain't known in my ends
But our names ringing all over your town
So when us man come around
The whole place get shut down
Your likkle dargs ain't known in my ends
But our names ringing all over your town

[Verse 3: Shorty]
Six million ways to make it
But I'm gonna make it my way
Moesh every day like say it was Friday
I get better every year like wine, mate
I get better every bar that I make
Lyrically doing this ting on a grime wave
So many Boy Better Know hits out there
You've been looking for a hit since MySpace
You might see me in a grime rave
Yeah, the shortest one on the grime stage
Plus I make sure that I roll properly
Don't start cause this ain't the right place
'Nuff MCs wanna play mind games
But I'm a big man, forget the mindframe
So many mad thoughts going through my brain
Soon have a big boy chain with my name

[Hook: Lay-Z]
So when us man come around
The whole place get shut down
Your likkle dargs ain't known in my ends
But our names ringing all over your town
So when us man come around
The whole place get shut down
Your likkle dargs ain't known in my ends
But our names ringing all over your town
