[Intro: Jme]
Boy Better Know, I Play Dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty

[Verse 1: Krept]
Firstly
Boy Better Play Dirty
I merk every beat, so they should sign me to Mercury
Swagged up from early, more clothes than Woolworths, you heard me
So let me state this, I've always got new jerseys
I like my girls naked, I get threesomes, that's great shit
One girl, on her knee-yo, then I showed her Matrix
Man better move
Old school, but them man never knew
So who thinks they can test man, like I won't write man off with my left hand

[Hook: Jme]
Boy Better Know, I Play Dirty
Boy Better Know, I Play Dirty
Boy Better Know, I Play Dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty

[Verse 2: Jme]
For everyone that likes shit music, this tune will annoy them
Konan, Krept, Jme, Teddy on the beat like boydem
In a rave, I show bare love, I take pics with the men and the ladies
Then I find the promoter and make him cough up the peas like a choking baby
These are Foamposites, not DMs, don't follow no one, I can't get DMs
These are Hyperdunks, not TMs, say that again and I'll switch like TN
Putting in work, been in bare magazines from early
Except that one, you better know Playboy is dirty

[Hook: Jme]

[Verse 3: Konan]
PD and Boy Better Know
Trying to see grands like your boy's getting old
I know feds still want me in a cell
We're the cool kids, tell a boy get a phone
Girls want me cause they're man's a nerd
They say I'm a dog, Konan's a flirt
So I don't really answer my iPhone
Cause that shit's full of angry birds
So bad, but it can be worse
Trying to get bread, no sandwiches
You don't want me to get serious, cause you're gonna need an ambulance
IPhone, iMac, hot spice, with a nice rack
Jap girls, Chinese girls, I'm that guy they try add

[Hook: Jme x2]
