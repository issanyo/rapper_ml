[Intro]
Shoutout Boy Better Know

[Verse]
See, I went through your body of work
So how comes nobody wanted a verse?
Are you really helping out Mumzy
Or did your mum win the lottery first?
See, I don't buy that shit you're talking
[?]
Where the money at?
What happened to the drugs that you were importing?

[Chorus]
Too many frauds in the scene
And you wonder why I got bored of the scene
I mean, how can you even call it a scene?
I just keep it real without causing a scene
I remember days when it all ways a dream
But nuttin' ain't changed in the hood, it's still one call for the team
I just give the fans what they all want to see
I seen man get big and it was all 'cause of me

[Verse 2]
I see your followers going up on the regs
So how come most of them bruddas are eggs?
At first, I thought you was popular
Till I saw it was a fucking sheg
It's looking all bait, now give it a rest
I knew the numbers can't be correct
Someone's lying
How dare that plum say he's the best

[Chorus]
Too many frauds in the scene
And you wonder why I got bored of the scene
I mean, how can you even call it a scene?
I just keep it real without causing a scene
I remember days when it all ways a dream
But nuttin' ain't changed in the hood, it's still one call for the team
I just give the fans what they all want to see
I seen man get big and it was all 'cause of me

[Verse 3]
And your first-day views are looking alright
So how've you only got like four likes?
It looks like you've had the vid on private
On loop all day and night
And I know you've got an image to keep up
So you ain't ever gonna say I'm right
You're just gonna blame it on praying, right?

[Chorus]
Too many frauds in the scene
And you wonder why I got bored of the scene
I mean, how can you even call it a scene?
I just keep it real without causing a scene
I remember days when it all ways a dream
But nuttin' ain't changed in the hood, it's still one call for the team
I just give the fans what they all want to see
I seen man get big and it was all 'cause of me
