[Verse 1: Double S]
I was raised in the belly of the beast
Where to open doors, man's gotta move keys
But I'm a star, I don't need to move B
Got women north, south to the west to the east
And all of dem gyal dere are freaks
Don't think I'm a pussy cause I don't talk grease
Little nigga, I would rather be talking Ps, but
You don't wanna see me with me and my Gs (no way)
Can you name a better MC? (no way)
Anybody with a better remedy? (no way)
Boy Better Know that there's no better boy
Than Double S and Jme (no way)
They don't do it like me (no way)
Can they flow better on the beat? (no way)
Fuck them niggas, Double, I'm a 10 figure nigga
Couldn't ever compete (no way)

[Hook: Double S]
If they're talking style and flows
Brudda, I do this ting
If they wanna know what I do to the shows
Brudda, I do this ting
I heard dem man are talking Ps
Brudda, I do this ting
I guess that I'm in too deep
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this, brudda, I do this
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this, brudda, I do this
Brudda, I do this ting

[Verse 2: Jme]
I used to play house and garage in a stolen whip
And now I own all three
I do this ting properly
Even the boydem can't boy Jme
Fifteen years deep
So everybody wanna clone my style in the scene
We call them the Jme symphony
Cause they're a phony simulation of me
Integrity
I am who I wanna be
When you see my face on the street
It's the same Jme that you see on the screen
On set now, everybody knows
That I don't wear makeup, I don't borrow no clothes
How you see me in the video
That's how I turned up and that's how I went home

[Hook: Double S]
If they're talking style and flows
Brudda, I do this ting
If they wanna know what I do to the shows
Brudda, I do this ting
I heard dem man are talking Ps
Brudda, I do this ting
I guess that I'm in too deep
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this, brudda, I do this
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this, brudda, I do this
Brudda, I do this ting

[Verse 3: Double S]
Ayy, ayy, I'm a young Jay Hova
I make gyal move up their body like soca
The flow's fire, I should stop, drop, roll over
Nigga, hold your corner
Double, like a killer MC, I'm a mic controller
And I can freeze time cause a nigga got colder
I got older, nuttin' changed my persona
You're a Corsa and I'm a Rover
The name's Double so there ain't nuttin' to this
I'm the farrda, you already knew this
You might see me on the strip like a nudist
I don't need a stunt double, I do this
Women wanna see my piece like a voodist
They want love, I don't know about Cupid
The flow's so explosive and money's still the motive
Even though I do it for the music

[Hook: Double S]
If they're talking style and flows
Brudda, I do this ting
If they wanna know what I do to the shows
Brudda, I do this ting
I heard dem man are talking Ps
Brudda, I do this ting
I guess that I'm in too deep
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this, brudda, I do this
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this ting
Brudda, I do this, brudda, I do this
Brudda, I do this ting
