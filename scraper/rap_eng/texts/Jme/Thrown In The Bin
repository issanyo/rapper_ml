[Hook: Skepta]
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the bin
Your CD gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the bin
Your CD gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin

[Verse 1: Jme]
Listen to me, innit
Your CD is dead, bin it
Pick up the mic and spray
Nah, pick up the mic and kill it
Trash, rubbish
Wheelie bin, that's it
Your CD get frisbee out the whip
Your album get dashed in the skip

[Verse 2: Shorty]
Nah, man, I ain't feeling your CD
It went in the bin next to the TV
Your CD ain't got no life in it
That's why us man are not liking it
Yeah, you're just wasting your time
Us man, we're the meaning of grime
Your CD's swag, give it up, fam
You never gonna be like us man

[Verse 3: Solo 45]
Papapapapapa, thrown in the bin
Whose CD's that? Get thrown in the bin
Shut up, thrown in the bin
What? What? What? What? What? Thrown in the bin
I just came from the bin and I know what the bin looks like
3 pointer, straight in the bin
Throw that CD up in the air
And lick that down like a space shooting

[Hook: Skepta]
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the bin
Your CD gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the bin
Your CD gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin

[Verse 4: Frisco]
Boy Better Know, know what it is
Your CD's dull, overly dim
I heard your mixtape intro swag
I was like that gets throwed in the bin
And I can't listen to this for a hour
Dash your CD over the bridge
And I'm still putting MCs on freeze
So your CD gets thrown in the fridge

[Verse 5: Skepta]
Man hate me cause I'm a big timer
But I'm still underground like a miner
Somebody tell that shit MC to
Throw that one liner in the bin liner
And between me and you
I think you should put your CD in tune
If you don't believe me
Jam, tell them what happened to the last shit CD

[Verse 6: Jammer]
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the garbage
This ain't for Maxi, this ain't for Karnage
This ain't for Logan, this ain't for Target
You can't sell this in the market
Your CD is dead, dun out
When we enter the room, they run out
It's all Boy Better Know, so boy better know
Your CD is gonna get

[Hook: Skepta]
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the bin
Your CD gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the bin
Your CD gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin

[Hook: Skepta]
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the bin
Your CD gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
Thrown in the bin, thrown in the bin
Your CD gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
What does it get? It gets thrown in the bin
