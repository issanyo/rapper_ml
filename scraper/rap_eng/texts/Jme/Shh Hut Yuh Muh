[Intro]
Maniac, m-m-Maniac, Maniac
Serious
J-m-e
Hold tight all the guys that ain't waiting around
Ain't wasting no time, yeah
Hold tight Leroy, yeah?
Serious, serious

[Bridge]
What the hell are you waiting for?
What the hell are you waiting for?
What the hell are you waiting for?
What the hell are you waiting for?

[Verse 1]
Ayo people, cop my first CD and the sequel
I'm cool but my music's lethal
None of these MCs are equal
I've been doing music since pre-school
Like, I know you think you're hench
True say you've got a new weight bench
That lyric right there was evil
On DÃ©ja, you can ask Diesel
1210s and the Stanton Needle
Pure listeners, bare people
Staying home like they've got measles
Now you wanna chat 'bout desert eagles
You think you're a music goon?
You're a spoon like I.R. Baboon
Life's not a film like Total Recall
Or a cartoon like I Am Weasel

[Hook]
Shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh

[Verse 2]
I MC like Hammer, not sledge
Some people call me a ledge
Like I've got a big window on my head
Cause of my old school bars they read
Like, "I know you think you're wide
I don't know who told you but they lied"
I used to say that bar there on the regs
On Heat FM, you can ask bare heads
I was on radio, you was on peds
I was in education, you was in the red
I was writing bars sitting on my bed
You was writing a statement of defence
You thought you was gonna be rich
But you found out quick that life's a bitch
Life's not a game like House of the Dead
Or a cartoon like them three Eds

[Hook]
Shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh

[Verse 3]
I've done so many mixtapes, you should know me
I'm in your face, I don't stay lowkey
On some ninja flex like Shinobi
I've got lyrics so old, they're holy
Like "I know you think you're wedge
Cause you eat all your fruit and veg"
That lyric made you feel lonely
I don't care if you're wearing a Roley
I stand here in my Boy Better Know tee
Not surprised by nothing you show me
Never been arrested, never had a Co-D
But I'm as real as it gets, blud, phone me
You thought that I was gonna hype
That's why you'll be surprised
You're not in a film like Axel Foley
Or a cartoon like Boo-Boo and Yogi

[Hook] (x2)
Shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
You can't chat to me so just shh hut yuh muh
'Llow it, shh hut yuh muh
