[Hook: Jme] x2
Gotta be strong (gotta be strong)
Can't step a foot wrong (can't step a foot wrong)
We're laying the path that the others are on (laying the path)
So I don't wanna spit on them songs, gotta move on

[Verse 1: Wiley]
I know who I am, went straight for the sale
Walked back into grime, like sorry I failed (sorry)
I went mad over there and I flew off the rails
But one thing I never let happen was let my flow go stale (that's right)
You see, that ain't my problem I kill it on the riddim with my eyes closed
Call up the agent, like please Bill can you put me on the right shows
I swear to God, wanna know about grime, I'll show you the meaning
I made that shit a reality, man did it, we're 'bout dreaming

[Verse 2: Wiley]
New Huarache, them joints look fly
They say "Where'd you get them? I wanna buy
Please tell me and don't lie"
On a Nike Air pie chart blud, my percentage is high
You know who we are, that's BBK (Boy Better Know)
Got radio shows on the TDK
Come to the show, wanna see me play
Jump on the stage, with the riddim we spray, ayy
