[Intro: JME]
Serious.. (x4)

[Verse 1: Griminal]
And they be like Grim, where you been?
Whats going on wheres the new song?
Stop that, when I come back I'mma done that
If you doubt me, you're a dumb prat
I be like one track, two track, three track, four
He's back, he's wack, he raps poor
I beat that, leave that, keep that whore
Can't believe that he speaks that raw
Its me biiiitch
Right now I couldn't give three shiiits
I'mma go HAM like E6
I'mma go HAM like Leeeave it
(Wait wait wait wait)
On a greaze tip, you ain't f'real
You'll need Clipse, start giving out body blows, E-drip
I'm with three chicks, let me see tips
(Wait wait wait wait)

[Hook]
Anyway, anyway, yeah
I do this everyday
Everyday, everyday, yeah
I do this everday, I go HAM!
HAM HAM HAM HAM HAM HAM HAM
I go HAM!
HAM HAM HAM HAM HAM HAM HAM (x2)

[Verse 2: JME]
In my brain, I can use 10 per cent and levitate
If you put me in a mental health clinic
I make everybody looks sane
EMJ, I just wanna say I dont smoke high grade but I got high grades
Dont act like I ain't told you already that I just pic up the mic and spray
If not, guess what, you can support us man to the top
Like an iPhone with a low battery, family, you better keep it locked
In the rave, feel the bass, its a madness when man are on stage
They tell us not to drink or crowd surf but we don't care what they say
We do it..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Griminal]
I'm with J, I'm with M E, you don't wanna play
I can't really see past you haters, cause my futures in the way
I told you I do this all day, snap back and the brims all grey
I might add your girl to my BB pin, ping ping ping like a pinball game
Look at me man, I'm so bait
You can't miss me like court dates
Might see me with a short girl, Boy Better Know
That I'm with Shortay
Know that I'm Nasty by Nature, so Naturally man are naughtay
And in school I was in the hall way, but now they got my name on wall, Safe!

[Hook]
