Like at first I thought "yeah, it's been sick" like 48 hours mixtape, whatever, just mucking about
Now, I'm panicking, like I've done, I've done like three kind of beats, kind of three kind of beats
I need to have like six or eight by today
And yesterday I was like "yeah yeah, got tomorrow, got d-"
Now it's today, I'm thinking oh

(Nah, it's gonna be done) Yeah, hope-hopefully (100%. Sun's out, blue sky) Yeah yeah, some positive energies (Decent glasses) Some positive energies
(Wait here my G, I have Snickers) Yes! Some positive energies bruv, give me some energy, aight
(Yeah, my girl left me though. That's peak, man) No! (Yeah man) No! (Swear down)
No, no, no! (Very upset) Do you wanna put that on the tune?
