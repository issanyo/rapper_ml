When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
Guess what? Guess what?

[Verse 1]
Right, when I say "guess what? Guess what?" Everybody knows
Jme's gonna pull out a rudeboy flow
Not on a hype like "Boy Better Know!"
More on a ting like "everybody thinks to MC tough..."
Or one of them flows like "garage has stopped" or "I shot Os"
Needed a start for a conscious lyric
"Guess what? Guess what?" is what I chose
Guess what? Guess what? You'll never guess
Cause I always come out with some next cleverness
Nevertheless, unless you're a fool
You understand you could never test
Oh my god, nevertheless
There's always one idiot who wants to test
Get it off your chest, you stupid fool
You must understand that you're not the best

[Hook]
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
Guess what? Guess what?

[Verse 2]
Don't try burn me like Roxio Toast
Lick your head with a pole or a post
Got bare lyrics that you can quote
And prove that I chat sense the most
Indirect lyrics? I'll ignore 'em
You will never get a rewind for 'em
OK, let's not go off-topic
Man that are scheming, best stop it
Guess what? Guess what? I can see 'em
Plotting on Jme at 9pm
I'm on radio, shit gets sticky
Everybody thinks I'm taking the mickey
Bredrin, don't get caught in the hype
Think before you pass me the mic
I'll make an announcement loud and clear
Jme is the best in here

[Hook]
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
Guess what? Guess what?

[Verse 3]
A little birdy tells me in the bits
I hear I'm getting on certain man's tits
Guess what? Guess what? Sorry, bredrin
Jme don't give 28 shits
At 54 Meridian Walk
You'll never knock at my door, so don't talk
I don't have my head up my own arse
But I'm better than half the brehs in New York
Some of you must think it's a breeze
I hear about 46 MCs
Chatting air about how Jme's
Overrated and similar cheese
It's cause you don't understand me though
Quite frankly, I don't give a shit, so
Guess what? Guess what? [?]
Don't tune into Jme's show

[Hook]
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
I'm big on the mic
When I say guess what? Guess what?
Guess what? Guess what?
