[Verse 1: Lethal Bizzle]
You might see man driving Italian whip
Blacked out windows, going to the gym
Two-two dumbbells, yeah, I'm going in
Doing it for Keyshia, doing it for Kim
Do it for the Speedos, do it for the beach
Do it for the stamina, do it for the sheets
Do it for the bicep, do it for the chest
Do it for the summer time, ready for the vest
Pump, pump, pump, pump
Up and down, spin that booty round and round
Your dench instructor is in town
I don't wanna see no clowning around
I don't wanna see no monkeying around
I don't wanna see no hand-moving out of time
Like you don't know this sound

[Pre-Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Ladies and gentleman
Can I have you addenchion please?
This is your dench instructor
It's time for the...

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Rari work out, Rari work out
Rari work out, Rari work out
Do it left, do it right
Do it day, do it night
Don't wait for the gym, do it on-site
But make sure that you pump, pump, pump
Rari work out, Rari work out

Do it left, do it right

[Verse 2: Jme]
Boy Better Know!
I'm bless up, drop to the floor do a hundred pressups
I'll do it 50/50 like Will
Then kick back, have a drink and rest up
Once you get fit you have to maintain
You can't work this hard then mess up
Man's backing jollof and plantain
You man are eating rice and ketchup, dead
Safe, screw up your face
Work up a sweat fam, pick up the pace
Bruv, you're not serious, you go to the gym
Tweet pictures and then buss case
You do it for the Vine, you do it for the 'Gram
I do it for my health, I do it for my fam
I do it in case anybody try run up their mouth
They'll get well, well, well, BLAM!
Boy Better Know! BLAM!

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
Rari work out, Rari work out

Rari work out, Rari work out
Do it left, do it right
Do it day, do it night
Don't wait for the gym, do it on-site

[Verse 3: Tempa T]
Tempz
Work out in a Rari
Man better know I work out in a car
See a peng ting in the passenger seat
Another girl in, she's preing a ménage
Me and my gyal on the way to the gym
But we pree'd it, nah, work out in the car
See us here, we ain’t got an excuse
Rari work out on the ferry to France
Work out, burn out, don't jam work
Bicep curling, tricep work
If you hear the Rari work out at the gym
You wanna see the gyal dem squat and twerk
You can see that I'm dench and trim
But I squat four plates, box man in the chin
Don't wanna see my cuz Dizzee Rascal
Roundhouse man, muay thai in the gym
Tempz, 100 KG on the bench
Dench, everyone knows that I'm dench
Tempz, personal trainer, Italian whip
Got myself an Italian chick
Rari, we're on Italian bits
Might just pree an Italian dish
Lethal, how we gonna summarise this?
RARI WORK OUT, GET INTO THIS!
