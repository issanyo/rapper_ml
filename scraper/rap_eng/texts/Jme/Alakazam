[Intro: Jme & Lancey Foux]
Serious
Alakazam, use your psychic attack
It sounds like Nyge

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
I've got hooks but I don't go fishing
Alakazam, I'll make man go missing
I was doing trips, you were at home kissing
Now I've got Henny coming out when I'm pissing
I've got hooks but I don't go fishing
Alakazam, I'll make man go missing
I was doing trips, you were at home kissing
Now I've got Henny coming out when I'm pissing
I've got hooks but I don't go fishing
Alakazam, I'll make man go missing
I was doing trips, you were at home kissing
Now I've got Henny coming out when I'm pissing
I've got hooks but I don't go fishing
Alakazam, I'll make man go missing
I was doing trips, you were at home kissing
Now I've got Henny coming out when I'm pissing

[Verse 1: AJ Tracey]
I'm a rockstar like Sting and Slash
Now peng tings wanna call man back
I'm a rockstar like Jeff or Matt
Call my young thug, watch man get slatt
Boy Better Know CEO on the track
Curry in the ends, that's right, he's back
Can't push me 'cause you'll get pushed back
Easter egg, the black MAC go crack
Catch man in traff, don't lack
Tee in white and Raf in black
Pantomine, man act, get clapped
I'm from West so that's tracksuits black
MTP or zone ten, that's gang
Hopped the fence and dem boy there ran
Can't stand the heat? Then don't touch that pan
Free up S 'cause he lives in can
Still cotch with them
Ult like Denzel, been to Washington
Box on Renzel, think you're boxing 'em?
Used to have Glocks and socks with rocks in 'em
Now the world is different
Same old Tracey but my girl is different
Didn't rate me till I made her listen
She was boring till I made her glisten

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
I've got hooks but I don't go fishing
Alakazam, I'll make man go missing
I was doing trips, you were at home kissing
Now I've got Henny coming out when I'm pissing
I've got hooks but I don't go fishing
Alakazam, I'll make man go missing
I was doing trips, you were at home kissing
Now I've got Henny coming out when I'm pissing
I've got hooks but I don't go fishing
Alakazam, I'll make man go missing
I was doing trips, you were at home kissing
Now I've got Henny coming out when I'm pissing
I've got hooks but I don't go fishing
Alakazam, I'll make man go missing
I was doing trips, you were at home kissing
Now I've got Henny coming out when I'm pissing

[Verse 2: Jme]
I'm blessed, ask about me, research
Hear good things but know
They won't be around no more if they cuss bad words
It's all Rowntree till you get burst
And if you doubt me, jump feet-first
People around me will tell you
Jme's mentality is one with the Earth
One life, you don't wanna lose it, no
Once I hit 'em with the stupid flow
"Man Don't Care" already, you should know
Fam, don't let me dig a two-foot hole
It's not that deep, it's not rocket science
I'm here just tryna have a good time
Hurt one of mine? Fuck that
Man's at the door next day like Amazon Prime; free delivery
I'll murder the beat till you're sick of me
Straight bars, no need for the trickery
Man will smoke that beef like Hickory
Yo, AJ, pass the auxillary
And the iPhone adapter
Give man chills like the fear factor
AJ, DC
Worldwide music, it's a new chapter

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Have the game in a headlock
If I see the cop that killed my brother
Believe he'll die from the headshots
Beam on the Glock in my Hancock
Hedgehog when I get away
When I'm looking for a prey, better pray like a nun
With a cup full of rum, when the rum is red
Tote a gun instead, dollar bill in ten
When you meet death, reapers are grim
Fucking with me? Send the Reaper to him
Pull out the stick on a pussy ass nigga
They tell me I look like a people to him
Under my brim, abandon the so black
Probably black as my gat, facts
Switch up the style and relax, tax
Act like a hoe, get the MAC wax
Like tack tack
Hit 'em in the back, now that's that
Gat to the face, that's Snapchat
Now you a bitch like cat stacks, damn
I don't talk no shit
'Cause I got too much honour
Nine-millimetre go bang
And this piercing armour
