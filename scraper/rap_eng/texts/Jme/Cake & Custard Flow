[Verse 1]
Didn't have a pen, I wrote bars in my phone
Everybody talked 'bout Fire in the Booth, but
Nobody blew when the strap got blown
Like on the strip, whole car's getting chrome
Bare of these old MCs keep moaning
About all the new man that are doing grime now
When it was you man, nuttin' weren't gwaning
So thank all the new man that are doing grime now
Insecure dons
Never see me argue online, send a track and a boy get grilled on
Bare man roll to a clash with a real don
You see me? I roll to a clash on my own, don't have it
Smile in my face, I don't know no panic
Rely on a rating from a next man? Them
Man are a moving like a homo faggot, some slow-mo ratchet
Man are in the game still tryna get hype back
If I start bunning MCs, will you write back?
With things that you can't decline at the right back?
Man wanna talk like they're living in Chiraq
Jumped in the game, thought he must gonna blow
Till I came with the cake and custard flow
Jumped in the game, thought he must gonna blow
Till I came with the cake and custard, ayy

[Chorus]
Cake and custard flow, cake and custard flow
Man haffi know about the
Cake and custard flow, cake and custard flow
Man haffi know about the
Cake and custard flow, cake and custard flow
Man haffi know about the
Cake and custard flow, cake and custard flow
Man haffi know

[Verse 2]
Waiting for a bring-in
I was on the road when you never had opinions
About who you know, you're waiting for a feature
Bangers that I did on my own, take a lesson
Flow's kind of mad
If you're taking the mic after me, don't panic
Me, I MC with the best MCs that are roaming the planet
You're on the floor like the foam in the attic
If I go hard in this music scene, then
Why you gonna say I lose time in the trap? Cuh
If I lose time in the trap, that's
Dough that I need to go hard in the music scene
Catch 22, bring two teams to the war
I've got a sixteen bar that will slap 22
Used to have a brick, now it's back on the queue
Life's kind of mad just to mention a few
Niggas be sleeping like Nico
When they done two plates of a righteous food
Ask about me, I'm a righteous dude
Hit a big stack and I might just move
Thought he must gonna blow
Till I came with the cake and custard flow
Jumped in the game, thought he must gonna blow
Till I came with the cake and custard, ayy

[Chorus]
Cake and custard flow, cake and custard flow
Man haffi know about the
Cake and custard flow, cake and custard flow
Man haffi know about the
Cake and custard flow, cake and custard flow
Man haffi know about the
Cake and custard flow, cake and custard flow
Man haffi know

[Outro]
Yo, it's the custard man
Come to your ends with custard, man
Roll to your girls with custard, man
Apple crumble and custard, man
Plain sponge and custard, man
Ginger cake and custard, man
Angel cake and custard, man
Oi, yo, it's the custard man
Ayy, yo, it's the custard, custard
Oi, fucking Ambrosia need to fucking sponsor me, rudeboy
Capo
Oi, I actually did it, you know
It's the custard, custard
