[Verse 1: Jordy]
Way, way on a madting
Come lay on my mattress
Dem boy, they ain't acting
Vibbar's a free cash ting
You flow, they go "maybe"
I flow, they go crazy
Light skin, that's my baby
Surfboard, 'cause I'm wavy

[Verse 2: Jordy]
I don't do clubs, I'm a diva
I don't do [?] like [?]
And they're all searching for Vibbar
We just be [?] the speaker
I just be rollin' with mandem
You know they holding the magnum
She say she love me, she love me
I got [?] in Camden

[Hook: Jordy]
Mmm, like that, like that
Man can't rap cuh' you're white like that
Mandem don't play your trap like that
Gal ain't in your WhatsApp like that
Why? you ain't got the juice like that
Bet you couldn't ever make moves like that
Make a youtube and get views like that
You don't do Ps and Qs like that

[Verse 3: Skitz]
I been on the wave tellin' man surfs up
V-I double, yeah, you heard us
Cloud nine whenever I burn one
Got a head full of raps like a turban
Let it all out, press record
Oh they wanna know me now? not before
Cuh' we're blowin' up fast like C4 like
I just hit it with Kacy and Jojo
I could run jokes like Kojo
Runnin' fly kicks like dojos
Flow so solid, let me rap this
Pussy but I never been catfished
Never been whipped like a [?]
But I stand out like batches

[Hook: Jordy]
Mmm, like that, like that
Man can't rap cuh' you're white like that
Mandem don't play your trap like that
Gal ain't in your WhatsApp like that
Why? you ain't got the juice like that
Bet you couldn't ever make moves like that
Make a youtube and get views like that
You don't do Ps and Qs like that

[Verse 4: JME]
Fam, it feels like
I'm never gonna be rich 'cause I pay tax
I'm never gonna be rich 'cause I pay VAT
I'm never gonna do this 'cause I do that
But I was there with Skeppy chillin' in the flats
Dem times there, man had the Mad Catz
I'm player one and he had the Mad Catz
The one with the turbo button on the back
The one with the turbo button on the side
Now I got that turbo button in my ride
Hold your breath when you see the button slide
Ludacris mode, yeah I leave you at the lights
Then I fall back and I let the car drive
I roll on my own or you see me with the wife
Get rude to the wife then you're playin' with your life
Ain't gotta tell a man twice
