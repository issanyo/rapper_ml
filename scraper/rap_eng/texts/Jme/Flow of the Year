[Intro: Jme]
Flow of the year, yeah
Flow of the year
Man better not act like they can't hear
Talk about flows then must be aware
K-A, N-O
Boy Better Know, flow of the year

[Hook 1: Kano]
Jme, watch this flow of the year
Over the bloodclart beat of the year
Feds on the case but we don't care
Mandem, straps and everything there
No champagne, we don't rave
No brandy, we don't rave
No gyal dem, we don't rave
Unless it's big bumbaclart, rasclart riddim
Boy better know me nah in love with them

[Verse 1: Kano]
Skip on it, skip on it
Bullying beats yeah, pick on it, pick on it
Real talk, mic ah did Titch on it, Titch on it
Shoulders, Louis V bag and a chip on it, chip on it
Rah, Kano sounds sick on it, sick on it
Send for the dock like hickory, dickory
This ain't no Trey Songz, eight pack
But gyaldem want blow a kiss on it, kiss on it
Blow that out, make a wish on it, wish on it
Remember the phone with Kick on it?
Different brand liquor, manaman are from the east side
Used to be the weed guy, now I went beeline
Ring just to revines, I'll write these grime bars
Over B-lines, fuck that, rewind

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: Kano]
Serious
Print on my outfit inferiors
Might just cop them Red Octobers
Wear an all-red suit like Delirious
Man wanna beef on Twitter, not serious
Suck your mum's vagina interior
Through a Ribena straw? No, fuck that
Capri Sun on Good Friday
Wishing it was a piece of pork
She won a MILF award though
And gave that speech like a seasoned salt though
Red, red wine and a decent Bordeaux
They malfunction, that's a decent wardrobe
No back seats in the silver Porsche though
Give her that D and I don't mean an auto
Born in a club like a thief to sort code
And rob Peter, but I didn't pay Paul though
Ghetto like Pardner, Dax and cornrows

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Kano]
12 years a flow, serious
And the award goes goes to?
Better be me, brother
If it's another nominee, brother
I'mma let you finish your speech, brother
But Kano had the best flow of all time
Before God, thank me, brother
Serious, freestyles are go, serious
Raw, off the dome, serious
No fucking edit for the radio, serious
Nigga say something 'bout Jamie
Then you're fucking with Boy Better Know, serious
Wanna hear Kane on my grind? Then spot motherfuckers there you go
Then you're not serious, no

[Hook 2]
Jme, watch this flow
Over the bloodclart beat of the year
Feds on the case but we don't care
Rifle, uzi, everything's serious
Hold tight Raskit on that one
No champagne, we don't rave
No vodka, we don't rave
No JÃ¤ger, we don't rave
Unless it's big bumbaclart, rasclart riddim
Boy better know me nah in love with them
