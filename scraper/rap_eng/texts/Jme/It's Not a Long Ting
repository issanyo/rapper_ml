[Pre-Hook: Jme]
Boy Better Know in the club stomping
I've got paper, cash, wong, ching
Any one of us can buy out the bar
You used to be a ching chang chong ting
Jump on the stage, grab the mic
Make sure that I don't say the wrong ting
Any one of us can fuck up the dance
Trust me, it's a deep sing-along ting

[Hook: Tempa T]
It's not a long ting
Done the dance, it's not a long ting
Don't muck around, it's not a long ting
Tearing it down, it's not a long ting
It's not a long ting
Done the dance, it's not a long ting
Don't muck around, it's not a long ting
Tearing it down, it's not a long ting

[Verse 1: Jme]
Wicked and quick
Sicker than sick
Start going on wicked and shit
You man are thicker than thick
I'll do what I like and say
Pick up the mic and spray
Bill up the vibe and stay
Raving from the night till day
Tell the promoter "send the P"
Go to the bar, spend a G
Turn the rave to what it's meant to be
Out rolling with Tempa T
Like you didn't know
Durag box and an afro comb
When us man step in the rave
Boy better slew dem, better know

[Verse 2: Tempa T]
Next hype
I'll keep man clear off the mic
CLEAR! Straight off the stage
CLEAR! Can't diss me on the mic
CLEAR! Won't be me in a fight
CLEAR! See man struggle to write
CLEAR! Stop shouting for help
CLEAR! There's no keeping you now
It's not long
[?] it's not long
Back out the rave at night, it's not long
Buy out the bar and that, it's not long
Piss me off and watch, it's not long
Out on the mic I spray, I'm half gone
Come against me, you'll learn to [?]
Be that guy [?]

[Hook: Tempa T]

Tearing it down, it's not a long ting

[Verse 3: Jme]
I don't care what you man say
I'm a badman at the end of the day
I'm raving 6 in the morning on a hype
Don't need no MDMA
I don't care what you man say
I'm a badman at the end of the day
Don't smoke weed, don't smoke cigarettes
You man smoke like twenty a day
Carry on, you'll get sent to your grave
Violate, you'll get sent to your grave
In fact, you're gonna have to work flipping hard
To not get sent to your grave
Cause when I put pen to the page
I don't act like I went to the States
Don't run ya mout, rudeboy
Cause I'll murk you and all your friends on the stage

[Outro: Jme]
Trust
It's not long
Do not bait the set
Yeah
