[Verse 1]
When I started the game
I picked up a cue
You man can't play pool like me
Rack 'em! rack 'em!
You can't make P like me
The way I be going on recently
Stack 'em! stack 'em!
You want to be like me?
But you can't sell CD's like me
Or T's like me!
Please don't ever let me hear you say
That you can MC like me!
Jack 'em! Jack 'em!
You can't spit like Jamie
Deep MC cause I spit grime daily
Bad Boy Bars hear me on the Radio
With Richard, Jahmek & Kwesi
Junior and Deshane
We put other MC's to shame
Any MC that used to spit that don't
Spit no more us man are to Blame

[Verse 2]
Please don't talk behind my back
If you wanna talk when you see me chat
Hater hating but you got 5 JME CD's
In your CD rack!
That's a bootleg what CD's that?
These pricks don't wanna see me stack
In my bedroom you'll see X-Box 360
PC, TV, Mac, Standard
I don't shoot class A
I do it the Adenuga way, Yeah
Big in the music game from time
I'm so sorry you can't play, I swear
I'm so sorry you can't play
I could pass you the mic but I won't
Cause, you talk on the mic but you don't make sense
Like RibiDibiDooBarDay, serious

[Verse 3]
I'm a big MC with a badaman flow
I've got a big brother called Skepta he's cold
I'm in a big crew we're called Boy Better Know
I've got a big fan-base all across the globe
I've got a big tune coming out with Frisco
I've got a big bass box, tinted window
I've got a big engine but I drive so slow
I've got a big mouth so I shout on the stage show
I've got a big foot feel the force of my big toe
I've got a big lip, big nose, big afro
I've got a big wad of cash and it's not from snow
I've got a big album ready to hit the road
I've got a big catalogue of music so
I've got to big up MSM in studio
I've got a big catalogue of music so
I've got to big up MSM in studio
