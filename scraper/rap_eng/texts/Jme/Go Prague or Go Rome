Chorus
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
Or you can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
Or you can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome

Czech Czech Czech Czech one
Prague, If you wanna have fun
Go Prague castle, don't be an arsehole
Old town square, meet man there
Spend some Koruna, drink a Corona
Straight from the fridge, walk Charles bridge
Royal Garden, I beg your pardon? Ima chill here, see you next year

Chorus
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
Or you can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
Or you can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome

I get no sleep, Rome all week
Am to Pm, check the colosseum
I'm roaming the world, out with my girl
Man ain't a battyman, go check the Vatican
Stand right there in St Peters Square
Taking pics, enjoy the trip
In front of the pantheon looking like a champion
No Lira im Spending Euros, but where are you though

Chorus
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
You can go Prague or you can go Rome
