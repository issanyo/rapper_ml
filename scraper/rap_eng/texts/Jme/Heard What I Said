[Intro: President T]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds of the President T
Going out to Skitz, hang tight Jme
And it's live, we come to do tings
We do it the large way, yeah
Going out to the Birmingham crew, Nottingham crew, Manchester crew
(Double 0-seven)

[Verse 1: President T]
He's not an MC, he's just a clown
I know man from a different town that'll run through your town
And for a ten bag of brown
You will hear a gunshot sound
Cuz, cause I'm with the elite
Nah, I ain't gotta drop down
All of these bars, they belong to me
I said nah, rudeboy, nah, it's not what I found
Blud, I ain't gone nowhere
I ain't gon' say I'm back, I'm too busy watching my back
I know two or three guys from Iraq
That'll walk up in the offy
Cop a likkle Heineken pack, lace that back
I know man that mention gash on the track
But President T finds out
They ain't even had a smash

[Hook: Jme & President T]
Hey blud, I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Prez T, he didn't hear what you said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead
I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Prez T, he didn't hear what you said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead

[Verse 2: Jme]
I'm so deep, when I'm in the bits
Your diaphragm sucks in a bit
I bring the pressure, I make the hits
Prez T's made six MCs quit
That's right, next MCs can't test me
Skepta, H, Bossman, Pabs, Prez T
Everybody knows I come with every
Catch me in Sidewinder, Eski
Or anyway, when I come around
Everybody knows what's going down
On this ting, look at my face
Don't get rude, know your place
Drink your drink or just blaze your zoot
Pretend you're on the phone if you need to
Can't jack me, can't rob me, can't screw
I think I'm a badboy just like you

[Hook: Jme & President T]
Hey blud, I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Prez T, he didn't hear what you said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead
I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Prez T, he didn't hear what you said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead

[Verse 3: President T]
I went out there, strap inna my hand, cuz
Then I done 30 months on remand, blud
Still I got parked off land
I know guys that lace it straight off the can, then
Slip to the side and duppy up a man cuz
I understand, think cause I MC
That I'm half of a man? Blud
I'm getting sprayed for about half of a grand
Can't be an MC, he's too deep
Every time I hear another President bar
I have trouble going to sleep
It's H, Jme, Bossman
That's what I play in my Jeep
Cause I'm just honest, I ain't gotta beg or creep
Man, I'm so advanced
You would've thought that
I took a quantum leap

[Hook: Jme & President T]
Hey blud, I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Prez T, he didn't hear what you said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead
I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Prez T, he didn't hear what you said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead
Hey blud, I don't think he heard what you said
This MC ain't heard what I said
Prez T, he didn't hear what you said
If he can't hear, he'll feel instead
