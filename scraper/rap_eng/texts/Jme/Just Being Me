[Verse 1]
When you listen, you're like "what does he mean?"
See, I'm a bit more than an MC
From secondary school days
You had to read between the lines to understand me
I wasn't a super intelligent kid
But I was brought up with common sense
If the MCs' parents heard them spit
Serious, they'll have a bone to pick
I think I need to explain
Things I conjure up in my brain
If I don't, I'll go insane
I don't wanna put myself through the pain
So I use them to entertain
I transfer my thoughts into words
At not one point will I change
In other words, I'm just being me

[Hook]
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just Jme
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just being me

[Verse 2]
See, when you listen, you're like "I feel this guy"
Cause I am the realest guy
From primary school days, Mum used to lick her thumb
And wipe the sleep out of my eye
Yeah, I had a little piggy head
I had dry shins as a little, little kid
Dry ankles over my shoes and ankle swingers
Still abused the other little pricks
I think I need to explore
Each and every one of my thoughts
If I don't, I'll go insane
I don't wanna put myself through the pain
So I use them to entertain
Still, I remain the same as I was
At not one point will I change
Simply because I'm just being me

[Hook]
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just Jme
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just being me

[Verse 3]
Life ain't full of jokes and games
I've got a lot of stress and strains
I've gotta wake up for uni so early that
Sometimes I fall asleep on the train
All it takes is for a few boys to say
"Look, there's Jme", slipping again
Land me with one happy-slap to my jaw
And then try and take my chain
I think I need to explain
The things I conjure up in my brain
If I don't, I'll go insane
I don't wanna put myself through the pain
So I use them to entertain
I transfer my thoughts into words
At not one point will I change
In other words, I'm just being me

[Hook]
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just Jme
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just being me

[Hook]
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just Jme
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just being me
I'm just Jme
