[Verse 1]
Jamie Adenuga that's me
Confessed I'm the best I'm a don
I been shopping spending P
And I heard lady sing man song
You might see me with President T
Dun know, we call him ching chang chong
Cause he cuts up rocks with scissors, and makes paper
That's what big man's on
Bruv, when I'm out spending cash
I might run into some local scruff
And they start showing off
True say they don't see JME on road too tough
On some ediot childish hype
Showing off all they white bone and stuff
Take a look at me rudeboy
You don't see paper, but I'm holding nuff

[Hook] (x2)
Everywhere I go
I see the same bro's
They looking at me funny
Yeah, they're putting on a show, show, show
No wonder why they make no dough

[Verse 2]
Area Watford, me and Skeps
Sam and Ez get searched on the steps
All pat down and a metal detector
In case man's got a shank in their creps
Straight downstairs, straight to the bar
No space for order, it's a par
While I patiently wait, one guy always wants to screw-face
Ediot
I'm not afraid of him cause I pump up tone up weights in the gym
I don't know what this guys thinking
All I know is he's not blinking
A girl taps him shoulder
He turns round, smiles, starts drinking
I don't understand, there's bare girls but he's on some badman ting...

[Hook] (x2)
Everywhere I go
I see the same bro's
They looking at me funny
Yeah, they're putting on a show, show, show
No wonder why they make no dough

[Verse 3]
How many people are going to tell me that JME's not repping the ends
Shut ya mouth you stupid speng
I was representing in Year 10
Winchmore uniform Heat FM
So, I don't wanna hear no bullshit again
I live on the north of the LDN
But I represent the north and south of the Thames
And the left to the right
Bruv, I represent anyone who has lived the street life
So no-one chat to me
Cause before I MC'd
No-one used to chat to me
But now you think you're a real goon
You ain't even made one real tune
Shh hut ya mouth stop lying to me
I don't know who you're trying to be

[Hook] (x2)
Everywhere I go
I see the same bro's
They looking at me funny
Yeah, they're putting on a show, show, show
No wonder why they make no dough

[Outro]
Sho-ow, Sho-ow
No wonder why they make no do-o-ough
Show, Show
Show, Show
You make no Do-ow-ow-ow-ow-ough...
