[Verse 1: Lethal Bizzle]
Yo yo, they're like who's on the riddim?
Only real top grime dawgs, I'mma get 'em
Hype ting, only one things on the riddim
Forward reload, that's what I'm biggin'
And you might see me creep through the hood, chillin'
Go link a quick pretty ting, women
Tryna' get that Bill Gates money, swimmin'
I'm Usain Bolt on the riddim, I'm winnin'

[Verse 2: Jme]
Well, well, well (Serious)
You'll get a punch in the nose like Blam!
You'll get a big nose bleed like Blam!
You'll get a kick on the floor like Blam!
Drag your face across the kerb like Blam!
Now bring you in the road like Blam!
You'll get an elbow drop like well, well, well
(Serious)

[Verse 4: Chipmunk]
Swag, blazin'
Same boy that made Oopsy Daisy
Same boy getting hate from a wasteman
Same boy that make a bitch go crazy
Still the grime scene saviour
Back now, just a bit more paper
Fling ten bags at a hater
Sony or not, man's major

[Verse 5: 2Face]
Oi fam, I go harder
My team's movin' larger
I got big bars for ya' whole fam
Make your mum skank out wit' ya' father
I Roll Deeper
Stylish through the speaker
How can you say I ain't hard
Shut up, you ain't hard either

[Verse 6: P Money]
P, grimy originator
Real life educator
Next level meditator
Turn anything into paper
Anybody that's gassed
Anybody that's gassed
Anybody that's gonna hate us
I'm cool when it comes to the enemy
Cause I'm a jaw side levitator

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
POW! Yeah I'm Leth to the B
POW! I got the top grime dawgs with me
POW! if you don't know about me
POW! Yeah I'm–POW! Yea you know–POW!
POW! Yeah I'm Leth to the B
POW! I got the top grime dawgs with me
POW! If you don't know about me
POW! Yeah I'm–POW!

[Verse 7: Ghetts]
Give me the mic, this riddim is mine
And I'mma skip like I've got Skivver inside
My lyrics are live
Why I deliver the hype
Better than anyone of you spitters combined
(Ghetts) They're all living a lie
(Ghetts) I'll be the best in Britain alie
(Ghetts) If this is a game then gimme the prize
(Ghetts) I can bring a vision alive

[Verse 8: Kano]
I'm old school
I'm from the Manor
I duppied every rave
Bitch I'm MC Shabba
But I wasn't on the original ting
So Leth to the Bizzle, please give me 16
I'm selfish, Grim knows all about me
Yeah, I'm on the money, man, it's all about G's
And I don't mean to whine while I'm dining
Fuck that, I couldn't give a flying
The whole hood, they be liking my writing
Cause I'm hood like Little Red Riding
Oh, what big bars you have
Murder a nigga, no pen
If you diss KA, your skin
Burn dem–a–nem–a–nem

[Hook: Lethal Bizzle]
POW! Yeah I'm Leth to the B
POW! I got the top grime dawgs with me
POW! if you don't know about me
POW! Yeah I'm–POW! Yea you know–POW!
POW! Yeah I'm Leth to the B
POW! I got the top grime dawgs with me
POW! If you don't know about me
POW! Yeah I'm–POW!
