Had to kill for the code
Can't talk about all the stuff I sold

[Verse 1: Big H]
Mum didn't love me, Dad weren't there
What could I do but pick up the gear?
Can't tell me cos I don't wanna hear
You got an issue, life ain't fair
Mum didn't love me, Dad weren't there
What could I do but pick up the gear?
Can't tell me cos I don't wanna hear
You got an issue, life ain't fair
Can't chief me, nah that's not possible
Punch in the eye, that looks horrible
18 shots make your clothes all colourful
Can't school me nah I'm not gullible
Check out the team
Me and Prez T that's N18
And I got family in Winson Green
Spray up the place and don't get seen

[Verse 2: President T]
I done a raise, but I didn't raise up a glass
Now remember, tasers and masks
That was the days of the past
Fingers crossed, there's no snake in the grass
Forward, right and left
Can you read and write, are you deaf?
Check out my postcode, remember my gates
Nobody bought me a drink at Yates
Want to eat food, but I ain't calling for plates
Just payed nine for a star one
They better know I ain't calling for weights
I suggest you start calling for mates
President, I can't believe it, surely it's not fake
I've got ties all over, even in the poorest parts of Kuwait

[Verse 3: Jme]
Check one, check two
Wanna rob me? Hold tight you
Open the boot, wack man up
Go home play Xbox, drink Typhoo
Bare wasteman wanna diss my tune
Same wasteman wanna live in my shoes
See me spitting bare deep bars on YouTube
Now they wanna try too
Fam, look at you shaking, leaning left
You look like you're taking crystal meth
You don't smoke cigarettes, don't smoke bless
But the room is baking from your breath
Your shape up and fade is F
Come like Jermaine from So So Def
I don't want to show no fake interest in your bullshit music
I am the best
