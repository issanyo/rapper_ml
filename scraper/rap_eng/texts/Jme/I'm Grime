[Verse 1: Kozzie]
Anything I do, I do it to the T
And the "Yeah" single made me P
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fantastic sales for for me
I do grime seven days of the week
And I go flat all out in the sheets
When I'm playing games, I'm playing for keeps
Meet a top shotta, fam, grime is me
Here still, grime's all up in my genes
I'm grimy like when your bath ain't clean
Taught them there's no I in team
Talk rough but I'll spill your beans, ayy
I know they love me
While you're spitting that P double E
I'll be out here making Ps
Brother, I am your dream, safe

[Hook: Kozzie]
I'm grime, I've been doing this for time
Four hit singles in my rucksack
Yeah, fam, I'm feeling fine
I'm fine, I'm grime
I've been doing this for time
Four hit singles in my rucksack
Yeah, fam, I'm feeling fine

[Verse 2: Kozzie]
It's all about me, nobody else
I do grime, look at my wealth
When I'm onstage I can never be stealth
Thug right down to my trainers, yo
Blud, I feel myself
Been eight years, I don't need no help
Shit's coming out of my arse, you melt
They should've stuck with me, oh well
Now they're on ends, fam, looking all frail
I've done grime, I'm going to hell
And I've still gotta big up your girl
Cause she's screaming (yeah) as well
Yeah, I love this grime
But them man are no friends of mine
They're just sitting there wasting time
Or preeing on my timeline, safe

[Hook: Kozzie]
I'm grime, I've been doing this for time
Four hit singles in my rucksack
Yeah, fam, I'm feeling fine
I'm fine, I'm grime
I've been doing this for time
Four hit singles in my rucksack
Yeah, fam, I'm feeling fine

[Verse 3: Jme]
On the track with Kozzie
Man's gonna merk this verse
Cos he told me to bury it like a dead body
Yeah I'm digging up mud, brown, bobby
Feds question how I got this, fine
What you think man's gonna say? Grime
Wait, I'mma let you finish
But this is the greatest genre of all time
If you doubt it
Then run up in the club whenever I'm on the microphone
Cause that will be the end to your night
You don't know what Jme and a microphone does
Ask the ravers, in fact you can ask the promoters
You man are jokers
I'll duppy the rave, walk offstage
Collect my wage, safe
