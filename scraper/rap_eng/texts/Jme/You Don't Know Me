[Intro: Frisco]
Are you mad
Oi let's get this started listen
Big Fris
It goes

[Verse 1: Frisco]
And I'm back where the beat is
Look up all my mandem my dawgs are the realest
I fire shots like a penis
I'm so greazy
You'll find me where the P's is
I spit the meanest
I'll show you what a 16 is
Believe this I'm the deepest
I get deeper, like Skeppy
You ain't ready for this pum pum beater
Microphone eater, big money seeker
I'm neater and I'm quite sick with a heater
Not any geezer, MC defeater
I came in the game your career started to look bleaker
Me I got bars by the meter I'm deeper
Boy Better Know believer
You're just a dreamer
I wear creps that are cleaner
Burst off the shots from the neener

[Chorus: Jme]
See, you don't know me (nah)
You don't know me (no)
You don't know me (nah)
You don't know me cuz, know me cuz
You don't know me cuz, know me cuz
Know me

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Yo
Eskidance keeper, get the weed cheaper
Quantum leaper, the Tottenham high streeter
Eskibeat beater, A star reader
4 times community service breacher
Back to court, facing jail the case beater
Robbery, burglary, dad got nicked 'cause of me
The police thought I was a phone shop dealer
Back in the day I was a wheeler and dealer
Fly to West where the sky is blue and the grass is greener
Paul Smith jeans suit Air Max Typhoon
Choong gash greeter
Yeah I know Jenny but I don't know Rita
My mums family come from Antigua
You come from West but you don't know younger or older beever
I was in carnival 12 years back with the London leaders

[Chorus: Jme]
See, you don't know me (nah)
You don't know me (no)
You don't know me (nah)
You don't know me cuz, know me cuz
You don't know me cuz, know me cuz
Know me

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Skepta
I'm a Welbourne warrior, St Paul's soldier
Northumberland Park next door neighbour
Eskimo raver, L-stone visitor, Meridian resident
See me in Manny with President
Showerman or South soldiers
Don't fear olders, never had youngers
Age ain't nothing but numbers
My 17 year olds roll with the pumpers
I'm a temple tourer, champagne pourer
Winchmore warrior, Class A courier
Grime scene ambassador, duppy maker
44 saviour, Ally Pally jungle raver
Entry ticket and a borer
Fresh hair cut with a side partin' and a border
Selby centre explorer, private caller ignorer
Go on then

[Chorus: Jme]
See, you don't know me (nah)
You don't know me (no)
You don't know me (nah)
You don't know me cuz, know me cuz
You don't know me cuz, know me cuz
Know me
