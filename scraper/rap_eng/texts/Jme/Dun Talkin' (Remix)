I'm still turning one into three bricks
So these songs ain't the only thing on remix

You wanna point at me? Nigga, oh, you tried
You got another three fingers saying that you lied

Words of advice from my big bro
Skeppy told me that you can never escape the roads
So respect the roots and never forget your home, yo
Out here, nobody's making it on their own, bro
Boy Better Know
It's more than a label or a logo
Dun talkin' after my show
So I jump in the whip and listen to Abz and Kojo
Even I thought I wasn't that guy
Till I put my life on the line
Then I clocked who was gonna ride
On that night, I realised
If I say no, dem man will still ride
I will drive by, then they will drive by
Light up the sky like bonfire night
Guy Fawkes night, yeah, fireworks night

[Verse 5: Frisco]
Me dun talk, we dun chat
Darg, the game's ours, we run that
Man's winning, it's a winner stays on ting

Boof, and I ain't frightened of no man
Light up an opp and take a flight to my homeland
We've been out 'ere putting on for North London
Likkle man, you better act like you know man
Yeah, so tell them try touch a button
Man will light up a something, man can't tell me nuttin'
If there's a top MC conversation
