They call me Jme
My fam call me JM
On road, they call me J, but
You lot can call me Jme

[Verse 1]
Don't get it twisted
I'm Jamie, the guy with the BMX bike
Jamie, cotch on the streets all night
Durag, no hood, I've got nothing to hide
Still vocal with a sock on the mic
Jamie with a positive attitude
Jamie, the guy with a Rubik's Cube
Used to live in Meridian but I moved
But I'm still part of Meridian Crew
Jamie, part of the Roll Deep fam
Jamie, everybody knows who I am
When "Boy Better Know" or "Serious" lands
Please don't chat crap
Jamie, the smart guy with the mic
Jamie, stay on Fruity Loops all night
Cause Logic looks all black-and-white

They call me Jme
My fam call me JM
On road, they call me J, but
You lot can call me Jme

[Verse 2]
You'll say oh shit
When you hear my lyrics
You're like "Jme's nang
Did you hear what he said? You get me, fam?
Ayy, blud, listen to this"
And then you show your bredrins and that
And they're like "rahtid, cuz
I never knew he said that"
And I'm like blud, that's easy
Writing them bars is nothing
I write them bars with ease
And that's why I've got 'nuff of them
You don't know what's in 'em like Es
Do listen properly and 'nuff of them
Will baffle you so easily
That's why you can't get enough of them

[Hook]
They call me Jme
My fam call me JM
On road, they call me J, but
You lot can call me Jme

[Verse 3]
Rudeboy, you think you're big
I can tell, you think you're big
Cause when you talk, you're in some mood
Like you're super, you're too rude
'Nuff of these guys got shit to prove
All this arrogant shit, just move
You think you're big so you run up your mouth
I know I ain't big, come to my house
Come to my door, you will see
I don't care what anybody says, I'm me
I don't change from Jamie to Jme
It's all the same, it's nothing to me
But you change, you go wild
How old are you? You act like a child
You chat bare shit and you act all dumb
I know that's not how you chat to your mum

[Hook]
They call me Jme
My fam call me JM
On road, they call me J, but
You lot can call me Jme
