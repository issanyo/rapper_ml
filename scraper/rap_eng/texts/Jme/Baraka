[Intro]
Yeah, erm, there's a couple bitches left outside
Someone let em in, because erm, yeah, they've paid, to get in

[Verse 1]
Me again, yeah, you guessed it
Still here, ain't been arrested
Man's saying they ain't impressed
Well, lock me off if you ain't interested (cunts!)
Trap all week, ain't rested
Got back double what I invested
Couple of Os of blow
So much snow, the flat looks festive
It's tried and tested
Can't be beat, can't be bested
Delivering what's requested
Noses run like they're congested
Bare cases contested, no confessing
Can't stop us progressing
There's no chance, there's no regressing
Cocaine got me acting aggressive
Badger's party, I'm guesting
Sket, getting suggestive
She's big-breasted, getting molested
No kissing or caressing
Piping up? I'll teach her a lesson
Selfishly I'll fuck her so poorly, she'll turn lesbian
Back to the topic in question
You know I whip that up, told you I'm Heston
No problem professing
Best of the best, accept no less than
Putting in work, no messing
Counting Z's, counting blessings
Can't help but get hard
When a white girl's undressing

[Hook]
No murdering, or killing
Just burning and pilling
We're working these women
Even if they ain't willing
I'm joking, I'm kidding
No face, still grinning
It's the saint, still sinning
Not losing...

[Verse 2]
Smart money's on me!
Tales of hard white and smart water on my jeans
Liaisons with fiends
Raving on magic beans, corrupting teens
You'd think I was a good parent
The way I get these kids to love their greens
No hopes or dreams, just get rich schemes
Paper stacked in reams, getting it in by any means
From London to Leeds, chasing leads
And pitching the powder that's the same colour as autumn leaves
Breeze, cause I'm eager
Six pot, three litre
Let's play follow the leader
Foot down, we don't fear the reaper
Wheeler dealer, chef in the kitchen
Pot, egg beater, nothing sweeter
Benadryl, that's what I use to cut the kuf
And sorry to deceive ya
None of my cats had any complaints
None of them had hay fever either!
I'm in a Vauxhall Meriva
With half a box of shiva
Told you before, you want work
Then pick up your receiver!

[Hook]
No murdering, or killing
Just burning and pilling
We're working these women
Even if they ain't willing
I'm joking, I'm kidding
No face, still grinning
It's the saint, still sinning
Not losing...

[Outro]
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
Still sinning
Not losing, I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
Still sinning
Not losing, I'm winning
