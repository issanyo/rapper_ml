[Hook]
Ha! I'm Jme, my name is tattooed on the grime scene
People don't know how to test me, been doing this from 2003
I'm a big boy producer, sick MC, I can even sing in key
I'm a genius, unfortunately
You will never be like Jme, you will never be like Jme
You will never be like Jme, you will never be like Jme
You will never be like Jme, you will never be like Jme
You will never be like Jme, you will never be like...

[Verse 1]
Born in Hackney, raised in Tottenham
Lived in Palmers, never had a job
I'm not unemployed, I'm a sole trader
Don't get annoyed cause I'm still a baider
I've changed from back in the days
Don't buss shots at cats like Tomb Raider
Still a Street Fighter but nowadays
I'll low punch, low kick Tatsu Vega
I went Welbourne, I went St. Paul's
I went Winchmore then I went Greenwich
And I still sold more tunes than you fools
That used to spit more so I don't get it
Your tunes are dead like Tyranosaurus
Truthfully your lyrics just bore us
More time when your tunes on the radio
I'm waiting for the chorus
I make grime music with ease
I'm tryna make grime spread like disease
I'm doing well, I'm not gonna stop
'Til my name rings bells like Dizzee's
You won't see me with Ray-Bans
Billabong shorts and flip flops
I don't wear Converse, I write a big verse
So you won't see me full stop, safe

You will never be like Jme, you will never be like Jme

[Verse 2]
I ain't buss one gunshot in my life
But I'm still standing here
You wish you was in these Nike Airs
You're there licking off shots in the air
You've got a silencer and you squeeze
Yeah, but really none of that matters
One minute's silence for your enemies
And one minute's silence for your bank balance, woo
Common sense needs to be renamed
Cause nowadays it's rare
When I was young my Mum used to say
"Jamie, use what's in between your ears"
So I did, and now I'm here
But if I said the same to you brehs
Half of you'd just smell things all day
And rest of you would just stare
I'll never go mersh, swear down
I ain't following nobody, I'm a shepherd
I'm like the spots on a leopard
When I'm on the mic, riddim get peppered
Truss, music over wealth
I've got deep lyrics, as you can tell
If I work hard for the reload and I don't get a reload
I'll reload it myself, safe

You will never be like Jme, you will never be like Jme
You will never be like Jme, you will never be like Jme
You will never be like Jme, you will never be like...
