[Verse 1: Jme]
Wait, do you realise the shit we're in?
First, they come with chip-and-pin
Next thing you know, it's chip-in-skin
Tony Blair will just sit and grin
The government must think we're dim
They don't even hide the fixed voting
It's bait, I won't vote him
He made up bullshit to go to war with Bin
Either way, you lose
Government parties act like fools
In the House of Commons, shuffling shoes
Spitting lyrics at next government crews
Charles Kennedy will strap a 16
Then Tony Blair will back his team
Tony's lyrics on an arms house tip
Too much hype, they'll get the chief whip

[Hook: Jme]
You're so blind
You're so blind
You're so blind
You're so blind
You need to open your eyes and see
Open your eyes and see
You need to open your eyes and see
You need to open your eyes and see

[Verse 2: Jme]
Do you realise the stuff you do?
Your crew's in beef with a next crew
You go find out what started the beef
And you find it had nothing to do with you
You're just wasting your teenage life
You've gotta think about when you're 35
Serious, I wanna make Ps
I wanna be able to pay off my mortgage twice
My music's getting big, don't spoil it
How far you gonna get with a war?
Let's think, do you wanna be a baiders
Or do you wanna shot aftershave in the toilets?
You can tell that I wanna be baiding
I chat so much sense, it's amazing
So if you wanna make Ps
Stop talking about people getting weighed in

[Hook: Jme]
You're so blind
You're so blind
You're so blind
You're so blind
You need to open your eyes and see
Open your eyes and see
You need to open your eyes and see
You need to open your eyes and see

[Verse 3: Wiley]
You could've been a leader (you're so blind)
Let people put you down, alright (you're so blind)
And it ain't about black or white (you're so blind)
You could be that star that shines bright (you're so blind)
Listen up, it's Eskiboy and I play black like I don't play poker
I make a dream come true, you're a hoper
Drive myself, I don't need a chauffeur
Me, I do 'nuff work, I ain't a loafer
Sometimes, you can't see the kid
But then I pop up just like toast from a toaster
I murk crews all day, I'm a rover
South west floater, E3 soldier

[Hook: Jme]
You're so blind
You're so blind
You're so blind
You're so blind
You need to open your eyes and see
Open your eyes and see
You need to open your eyes and see
You need to open your eyes and see
