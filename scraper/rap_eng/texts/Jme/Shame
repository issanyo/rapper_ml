[Verse 1]
Everybody, cast your minds back
To the Teenage Mutant heroes
Couple years before Nintendo
Who were we meant to look up to?
Leonardo saving April
Bare arms house in Big Apple
Big Apple, where is that?
Ain't nowhere in England, in fact
It's in the same place
Where Ivan Ooze and Zordon had beef
It's in the same place
Where Arnold and Willis used to cause grief
In the same place
Where our early inspirations and dreams
Came about back in the day
As we saluted the USA

[Hook]
We were brought up by the media and TV
But they already had an American culture, it's a shame
We were brought up looking to the USA
It's a shame, but we look on the bright side, as they say

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to go to the place
With them stars on the pavement
Big white letters on the hill
And stare in amazement
Since we were babies, after we're born
We were always taught to conform
Watching Yankees on the TV
I want kids to want to be me
I'm a young baller in the game like Rooney
I'mma get my degree from uni
And show all the youts that you can be
Whatever you want to be, truly
There's talent in the UK, you see
Our music was invented newly
And I don't lack inspiration
I've got Skepta, Jason and Julie

[Hook]
We were brought up by the media and TV
But they already had an American culture, it's a shame
We were brought up looking to the USA
It's a shame, but we look on the bright side, as they say

[Verse 3]
Nah, man, I'm not hating
Americans still get ratings
It's just that I'm not condoning
The UK guys that are cloning
You might think Jme's moaning
But right now, we've got our own thing
Couple snares and a kick and a bass
This music right here was created
In the same place
Where it's Â£30 to cut a dubplate
In the same place
Where Saskia got licked with an ashtray
In the same place
Where most of you conformers were born
Where all of you stay
At home, in the UK

[Hook]
We were brought up by the media and TV
But they already had an American culture, it's a shame
We were brought up looking to the USA
It's a shame, but we look on the bright side, as they say

[Outro]
That's right
I don't hate America but
Come on, we've got our own thing going, don't let it slip
It's Jamie
I used to dress up as a Power Ranger too
Watch all them cartoons and them programmes with their accents
Keep it real, everybody
Everybody
Everyone
Serious
