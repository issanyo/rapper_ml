[Intro: Tim Westwood]
Grime is in a state of emergency
The scene is in chaos
We need a superhero to save the day
Who can we get?
(I know, let's get Superman!)
Fuck that pantyhose-wearing bitch!
(OK, my bad, let's get Batman!)
That motherfucker can't do shit, he's a wasteman!
(Alright, alright, I've got it, get the Ninja Turtles)
Are you out of your fucking mind?
They're a bunch of poomplex derkheads!
No, we need a super shaman. We need Jme
(Who is Jme?)
Jme was a grime MC from the ends
Until he met Mr V
Mr V. was a mad scientist who produced a track that gave Jme an incredible superpower. Anything Jme touched multiplied, duplicated and replicated. Jme had the power to clone anything. He could turn a Big Mac meal into a feast for a thousand. A KFC variety bucket will feed the world. Jme is the superhero we need!

(It's Mr. V)

[Verse 1: Jme]
Yeah blud, it's a lot
I've been at home all day
Cloning Â£50 notes, this is sick
But it's a bit bait
Cause all the serial numbers are the same
So I can't spend them in the same place
I was gonna put a deposit on a flat
Instead, I might just give 'em all out to the mandem
This is jokes
I don't know what to do next
I've already cloned my TV, my iMac
All my garms and creps
I know Skepta wanted these jeans
So look, see?
I could've made a million by now
But then everybody will find out
Blud, this is nang

[Hook: Jme]
You've got nothing, you've got nothing
You want something so you need power
Don't abuse your power, don't abuse your power
Don't abuse your power (Mr. V)

[Verse 2: Jme]
Oi, oi, MSM, let me clone your chain
In fact
I'mma find the guy with the massivest chain
Clone it and then give it back
Oh my god, I'm so dumb
What am I thinking?
With my powers, I should be stopping
All the poverty in Africa and all them tings
But the media will speculate
Them feds will interrogate
MI5 will investigate
That's just too b-bait
(Blud, there's feds following us)
Huh? Wait
I cloned Westwood's car
It's got the same registration plate
Man, this is peak

[Hook: Jme]
You've got nothing, you've got nothing
You want something so you need power
Don't abuse your power, don't abuse your power
Don't abuse your power (Mr. V)

[Verse 3: Jme]
Alright, alright, think, think, think
What can I do? Where can I go?
First things first, get these fake 50s
And throw 'em out the window
Alright, Jme, calm down
Acting like you've been cloning P
When I got the power to clone
I wish I could unclone, see?
Now look at me, taking chase
Cloning traffic lights, cloning gates
Cloning pot holes, no escape
Oi MSM, pass me my jacket
Here you are, zip it up tight
When I pull over, just run for your life
I'mma do a handbrake skid
And we'll disappear into the night
Flipping hell, man
These feds are on a mission
They must really wanna catch man
They want their commission
That's it, I'm stuck
Behind this tree
And they know I'm here
I'm gonna clone me
