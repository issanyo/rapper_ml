[Intro]
Straight from one booth to another booth
Eskiboy
(Wait)
Oi people!
This is Tunnel Vision, Volume Two
Man's back in it, Boy Better Know
Big up Jamie, big up Skepta
Big up all the Roll Deep massive, hold tight Trim, Scratchy
Hold tight Danny Wizzle
Big up Target
Hold tight all the representers
I wanna big up all my studio engineers you know
Big up MSM, hold tight Scratcha
Hold tight all the £10 an hour massive
£20 an hour massive
£30 an hour massive for certain guys
Cah you know it ranges
Big up God's Gift
And right now, I'm just back to tell you
Man's back with the next big CD innit
Like there's no sleeping involved
It's like Volume One, Volume Two, Volume Three
Man ain't wasting time trust me
Hold tight all the record labels I know you see me
I know you see me
It's not hard to see me when I'm doing so much work trust me
Hold tight my daughter Leah, cause you know it's all for you
Hold tight my family
Right now it's Eskiboy, Tunnel Vision Volume Two
And right now we've just come to lay down the law like
Let man know that, the levels are up, the levels are high
I heard one yute the other day say like
"Wiley said the levels are going up", the levels are going up

[Verse]
You see most of the time I can do it on my own
And a record deal but that ain't nuttin' but a loan
Try and do it alone until you're worth more
I watch all of you on Channel U at home
I know I've got to do a new video
Gangsters video, bring the title back home
I'm roaming on Roman Road I'm not alone
With 54 sharks we'll, send you home
I've got mic control I'm not like the whole
Batch of weak MCs around on the roads
I'm a wizard got a reptile back like a lizard
[?] the felt the blizzard in the war
I delivered, Eskiboy ain't no [?]
Put my flow to the test
Look at the levels now blud
I have just risen, and I'm on a mission
You won't ever catch me slippin'

[Outro]
Tunnel Vision, Volume Two
Eskiboy
