[Intro]
Jme
A simple music lesson, think about it

[Verse 1]
Everybody thinks to MC tough
Your lyrics must be about negative stuff
Go raving, no one's skanking
Turn round, I bet you someone's shanking
Just 'cause we come from the gutter
And we know about scraping the bottom of the butter
Don't mean we have to be sinners
Major labels don't want killers
Think, who's gonna sign a guy with a shank?
Or a guy with a nine mil
All you're gonna get is a three-figure deal
You MC at a rave and get a bill
But that bill ain't gonna last
It will go fast and it might be the last
Shows for a while so you won't have no dough for a while

[Bridge]
To the beat
Just bop ya head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Just bop ya head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance or lean back
Then bop ya head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Serious, bop ya head to the remix

[Verse 2]
Don't talk to me about lyrics
I know all your little gimmicks
I know about rhyming dictionaries
And I know about rhymezone[dot]com, please
Go write some intelligent bars
Show man you know more than just cars
Shanks, money, shanks, gash
Shanks, weed, shanks, please
Thanks, cause recently
I've been on a good vibe, reason is cause
I'm not average or decent
And it's hard to write lyrics like these (serious)
I mean it, ask any artist
Task any artist to write a bar that's positive
Not talking 'bout breasts
Or a bulletproof vest
See, I'm the best
Imagine if every single MC lived by their word
It word be impossible to get anywhere
Cause gunshots would have occurred
You couldn't even go to the video shoot
Cause man would go to the video and shoot
Then he'd get away leaving Feds and ambulances
At your video shoot

[Hook]
You're not serious, don't say serious
Cause I say "serious", you wanna get serious?
Let's get serious, you can't act serious
So don't say serious, about serious
You're not serious, don't say serious
Cause I say "serious", you wanna get serious?
Let's get serious, you can't act serious
So don't say serious, about serious

[Verse 3]
All this talk about reppin' your ends
And not making any more friends is an idiot ting
How long is it gonna take to realize it needs to end?
You're a wasteman if you're 29
And you're still posing by a road sign
You need to think about your lifetime
Before you hit forty with a shank in your nine
You need to start growing up
Your lyrics make you sound like you don't know enough
You'll never be blowing up
You make me sick like a drunk person throwing up
Don't ignore me and write poor lyrics
About getting bored of your brand new sword
Don't act dumb
Wiley warned you, the level of MCing is going up
Everybody, it's Jme
Do not come try floss around me
I don't care 'bout your J-A-C-O-B
Munch it up like a B-L-T
At last, yes, it's me, Jme
You won't hear no wasteman slaying me
'Cause I've got big DJ's playing me
So don't say my name if you're not paying me

[Hook]
You're not serious, don't say serious
Cause I say "serious", you wanna get serious?
Let's get serious, you can't act serious
So don't say serious, about serious
You're not serious, don't say serious
Cause I say "serious", you wanna get serious?
Let's get serious, you can't act serious
So don't say serious, about serious

[Bridge]
To the beat
Just bop ya head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Just bop ya head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance or sing on the plane
Or lean back
Or do the vocal
Or do the old school grandad dance
Just bop ya head to the beat
Serious, to the beat
Just bop ya head to the beat
It's J-M-E
