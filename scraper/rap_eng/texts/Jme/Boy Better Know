[Verse 1: Jme]
I don't know where you think you're going
With them one, two likkle bars
Deadout, clash me you'll get a par
You know my face, Jamie Adenuga
I don't care what manaman thinks
I heard your mixtape, bruv it stinks
How you perform when you're on stage
Smells exactly like your mixtape
When I spray, everybody get haps
Jumping about, shouting brap, brap
Doing bare things with their hands
That's how you know man's got bare fans
You ain't got no one but cats
About you got bredrins and that
Don't try a thing, man ain't a idiot
Tell you to shh hut yuh muh, dickhead

[Hook]
Boy Better Know
When Jamie's about
Boy Better Know
When Jamie shouts
BOY BETTER KNOW!
You know what time it is
Boy Better Know
It's alot, it's alot
Boy Better Know
When Jamie's about
Boy Better Know
When Jamie shouts
BOY BETTER KNOW!
You know what time it is
Boy Better Know
Yo

[Verse 2]
There'll never gonna be a day when Jamie's quitted
More like he see me in a fitted
And a fresh trim, and a pullover knitted [?]
Failed in an example, I'll reset it
Never be a day when Jamie's quitted
More like he see me in a kitted
Bust in metro, fully legited
Smoking inside the whip permitted
Never be a day when Jamie's quitted
More like he see me admit it
To mental home, with my legs splitted
Doing bare things with both for slit it [?]
Never be a day when Jamie's quitted
More likely see me outwith it
In a two year relationship commited
To one of these dumb dumb female shitheads
