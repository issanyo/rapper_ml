A simple music lesson, think about it

[Verse 1]
Everybody thinks to MC tough
Your lyrics must be about negative stuff
Go ravin', no one's skankin'
Turn around, I bet you someone's shankin'
Just cause we come from the gutter
And we know about scraping the bottom of the butter
Don't mean we have to be sinners
Major labels don't want killers
Think, who's gonna sign a guy with a shank?
Or a guy with a nine mil?
All you're gonna get is a three figure deal
You'll MC at a rave and get a bill
But that bill ain't gonna last
It will go fast and it might be the last
Shubs for a while, so you won't have no
Dough for a while (serious)

[Bridge]
To the beat
Just bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Just bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance or lean back
Then bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to beat
Just bop your head to the beat

[Hook]
You're not serious, don't say serious
'Cause I say serious, you wanna get serious?
Let's get serious, you can't hack serious
So don't say serious about serious
You're not serious, don't say serious
'Cause I say serious, you wanna get serious?
Then let's get serious, you can't hack serious
So don't say serious

[Verse 2]
Everbody says that garage should stop
Cause it's cheap like Calypso or Tip-Top
MCs turn UK hip hop
Scared their debut album will flop
I'm flogging food like a chip-shop
So I'll fall back on that if this flops
Plus I go uni so if shit pops off with the cops
Trust me, I've got it locked
How comes every single MC is vexed?
It's like the whole point of MC-ing nowadays
Is to get a reload of the decks
Man will go to radio on Thursday
Even though it's his birthday
He'll spit lyrics like it's the worst day in his life
It's not serious (serious)

[Bridge]
To the beat
Just bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Then bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance or do the bogle
Just bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to beat
Just bop your head to the beat

[Hook]
You're not serious, don't say serious
'Cause I say serious, you wanna get serious?
Let's get serious, you can't hack serious
So don't say serious about serious
You're not serious, don't say serious
'Cause I say serious, you wanna get serious?
Then let's get serious, you can't hack serious
So don't say serious

[Verse 3]
Everybody knows you're some goody-goody
That screwface and that Rocawear hoodie
Just ain't working, sorry, bredrin
I'm Buzz Lightyear and you come like Woody
Look at my man bigging up his chest
Looks like he's tryin to grow some breast
Stop that, before you get an archback
I don't know who my man's tryna impress
Everybody knows that I shot O's
And I make P's, shot Q's like Kano
Under my tongue is where they go
Shotting since Wiley had cane row
To make dough you need sense
I still don't throw away five pence
One cat thought I was dense
Owed me a lump sum and he tried jump some fence

[Bridge]
To the beat
Just bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Then bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance or signal the plane
Just bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Just bop your head to the beat

[Hook]
You're not serious, don't say serious
'Cause I say serious, you wanna get serious?
Let's get serious, you can't hack serious
So don't say serious about serious
You're not serious, don't say serious
'Cause I say serious, you wanna get serious?
Then let's get serious, you can't hack serious
So don't say serious

[Outro]
Serious
Hope everybody takes something away with them from this lesson
See you tomorrow
