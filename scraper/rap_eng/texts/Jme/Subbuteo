My mouth is for food and food, it's a great two-in-one
Skepta weighs it up cause I hate doing sums
People stare in the streets on some fake screwing one
Cause I look like I'm chewing eight chewing gums
Don't be doing dumb shit cause you've gotta chapse
And start running up your gums with your chaps cause the straps
On the side of the waist of my ruthless mans
Will be on the side of your face like a Bluetooth hands-free
Goes for all of you; short, tall, fat, thin
Don't try to take me as if I'm an aspirin
You're with your bredrins with your cat's back but
When I come, everyone's innocent acting
All went quiet, but one got agitated
So I left him discombobulated
Tryna take me as if I'm a retard
So I brought niggas to his door as if he had a free yard
I'm not a prick cause I'm riding a pushbike
Cross the road and buss shots in a swoosh like
No jokes, this is real, not a hoax
Slam your face in my smokes, no, you shouldn't provoke me
I don't care if you're serious
Cause I'm Jme, so you know I'm serious, serious
Don't pronounce my words properly
But that don't stop me cause I've got bare experience
Makes me sick when I see these dicks
No dough, want dicks, no chicks, just pricks
Starting beef and then tryna chief the feds
Three or four chiefs tryna teef beats for pence
Chatting 'bout I was neglecting my music game
Shut your mouth, perfecting my shooting aim
You can't expect me to live in the studio
I've gotta flick the white ball to man like subbuteo
