[Intro: Maxsta]
Yeah
Max
Trust me
Born on your own
Die on your own
Yeah

[Verse 1: Maxsta]
Born on your own, die on your own (bow!)
You will see Max poppin' out like cleavage
Before you ring off the bells best grease it (why)
There's a lot goin' on this evenin'
I'm in the ends with the wolves dem schemin'
Dark whips where my bros get lean in
You wanna beef but beef is serious
Are you serious, likkle vegan
Kevin Keegan (you)
And your girlfriend's clapped you're reaching (mad)
You best mind how you speaking if I exit that's bossman leaving
I make money off of green and raps give me p's and that (give me money)
Mash work on gyal no teet' and that straight skeet on that like

[Chorus: Maxsta]
Born on your own, die on your own (bow!)
Kitties dem cat deh pon di ringtone (Max)
Yeah I got my money up that's grown (yeah yeah)
Big Max no love gets shown
Born on your own, die on your own (yeah)
Kitties dem cat deh pon di ringtone (trust)
Yeah I got my money up that's grown (trust)
Big Max no love gets shown

[Verse 2: JME]
Born on your own, die on your own
I spend my mornings unsubscribing and lettin' insects out of my home
Kiss the wife before I check my phone
Happy now, all of the mandem eatin'
You man still living off deetsing
Said you wanna meet up that's serious
Are you serious?
It's not a meat ting
That's dead, die on your own
Get murked from bird's eye with a drone
No switchin', lower your tone
No pictures, lower your phone
Before I make an impact start smashing up the place fam, in fact
If you wanna leave with all your shit intact
You should probably hear what I spit with Max
And know you're born on your own

[Chorus: Maxsta]
Born on your own, die on your own (bow!)
Kitties dem cat deh pon di ringtone (Max)
Yeah I got my money up that's grown (yeah yeah)
Big Max no love gets shown
Born on your own, die on your own (yeah)
Kitties dem cat deh pon di ringtone (trust)
Yeah I got my money up that's grown (trust)
Big Max no love gets shown

[Verse 3: Maxsta]
No love gets shown
Ten seconds with a cat if I chat on the phone
"Wah gwan Max lemmie chat to you", no
I gotta link Emily and Nicole and Emma Watson
Gotta give your heart for the narn, I get it often
Max been shellin' on them
Manna got stylee brand new creppers and ten
Got trees like Christmas
Gotta sell it on ends
Do I wanna be gangsta
On a late night while I run up on things while I'm wavin'
Gyal and the bruddas locked in can't lack 'cuz
Nunez(?) where something got chinged
Think you're safe witcha mates
Chance is slim, catch man on the road and bark that ting like

[Chorus: Maxsta]
Born on your own, die on your own (bow!)
Kitties dem cat deh pon di ringtone (Max)
Yeah I got my money up that's grown (yeah yeah)
Big Max no love gets shown
Born on your own, die on your own (yeah)
Kitties dem cat deh pon di ringtone (trust)
Yeah I got my money up that's grown (trust)
Big Max no love gets shown
