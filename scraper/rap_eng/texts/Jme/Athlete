[Intro]
Mystry

[Pre-Chorus: Skepta]
So much food at the table why you wanna act like Judas
Everybody puttin' in work and you got bare excuses
But when they call your number, where you gonna run I wonder
Tie your lace, fix your face, I'm your fitness instructor

[Chorus: Goldie1]
Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Put him in the backseat
Put him in the backseat
Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Catch him put him in the backseat
Catch him put him in the backseat

Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Put him in the backseat
Put him in the backseat
Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Catch him put him in the backseat
Catch him put him in the backseat

[Verse 1: Frisco]
Yo, I make man run like say he's on the last leg of the relay
Run a man way down the road and catch him
If I don't you will learn about the action replay
MC murderer, make an MC change his title to hurdler
Man said it's beef on the menu, cool
It's just shells and corn that I'm servin' ya
Run up and get done up, I don't play I tun up till I bun up, you don't say
Service, I'm in the back of the club with the big batty ting just twerking
Man try jump on the wave, they hate so much 'till it's hurting
I make man run like an athlete, you better pray that your stamina's working

[Verse 2: Jammer]
BBK will live forever, real friends don't die they live together
Talking bars we bring the pepper
Man wanna meet better bring the cheddar
No long ting when I'm talking, turn an MC to an orphan
'Cah we come for the big boy paper
And not for the likkle man portion
Boy Better Know we're the realest out here, can't see them man they're eating out here
The roots ama' deeply seeded out here
A lot of my niggas need feeding out here
So man are gonna shine right now
It's just money on the line right now
I keep telling them again but they didn't wanna listen now it's all about grime right now

[Verse 3: Wiley]
Move humble, the road's where you catch me
I'm in an Uber, sat in the backseat
Pull up on the block in my right mind
1, 2 zoots got me stoned, high times
When it's my time, you best mind out
Touch a button, you're gonna find out
No security, no breddin'
The circle of bread you man can't get in
So, take a look but please don't touch
A likkle 'ello and bye was enough
My crew are the waviest here
More wavy than the waviest hair
We bring the vibe we hate to be fair
When you step onto the stage all the man get air
Make the wrong move, that's long
'Cause I'll roll out with the realest dons

[Chorus: Goldie1]
Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Put him in the backseat
Put him in the backseat
Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Catch him put him in the backseat
Catch him put him in the backseat

[Verse 4: Shorty]
We've been out 'ere for ages, finally hit that top spot
North London grew up on a hot block, manna' say my bars are top notch
Man are popular but not pop, I can tell you what's good fam what's not
Aim at the game and we hit the soft spot, far from a long shot
Backstage looking all hotboxed, we got the ravers buzzing
Been chasing done a whole lot of running
Celebrate greatness, drinking and bunning
Not thinking about times when we didn't have nuttin'
We went from nuttin' to suttin', can't be greedy we can't be glutton
They didn't wanna let no one in, but we run in
Come through gunnin', didn't see that one comin'

[Verse 5: Skepta]
Once upon a time yeah you could call this a race
But I think nowadays you have to call this a chase and we came up with the plan all in a day
Yeah, we're too weird, we're too rare
All man need is one engineer
And they know that's MSM there
That's why we got the rest of them scared
These kind of riches you can't rob it
Stand up in the high road, card in my pocket
You don't want it, over the bonnet
Trust me I run down Sonic
It's not a mix CD if it ain't got "Them Man There", "Man Don't Care" and "Shutdown" on it
You don't wanna lose your girl so please don't come around bosses

[Verse 6: Jme]
Unlimited vibes, vibe can't done, fresh, clean, badman lungs
When man said run like an athlete fam you better run fast 'cause man can run
Chase man around and hop over fences, man's greyhounding
Run rings around a block of houses, run a man down like T-1000
Finesse, won't break a sweat but I'll kick man's back foot make man trip up
Stress, talking high pitch like an air hostess
You don't want none, you're on your ones
Talking about guns, blud hush your gums
Fam man ain't dumb, argument done
Serious, make a man run, run

[Chorus: Goldie1]
Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Put him in the backseat
Put him in the backseat
Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Catch him put him in the backseat
Catch him put him in the backseat

Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Put him in the backseat
Put him in the backseat
Run like an athlete
Run like an athlete
Catch him put him in the backseat
Catch him put him in the backseat
