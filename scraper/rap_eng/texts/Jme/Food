[Intro]
My belly hurts
My belly is hurting me
My belly hurts blud
I want some food blud
Yo
Yo

[Hook]
FOOD
(Blud my belly is hurting me blud)
FOOD
I'm hungry I want some
FOOD
I'm hungry and I want some flipping
FOOD
FOOD

[Verse 1]
(I want some kebab rudeboy)
As soon as I step foot in the shop
I know that I don't know what I want
Chicken doner, kofte kebab or
Lamb shish, or mixed special
Sometimes I get a coffee
Or some next one I can't say properly
'Llow it, so hungry I'm bitin' my lips
Flippin' hell just get a portion of chips
Blud that's too much salt on my chips
I been bitin' my lips, are you thick, it stings
I've lost my appetite, lickin the salt off my lips
Throw the chips in the bin
Normal, walk out the shop
Don't forget to say "thank you boss" (ay, safe, safe)
Walk to my yard, soon as I land
Go find a toilet and jam

[Hook]
FOOD!
(Don't you love it when you get some real good...)
FOOD!
(Not going out on street and eating all of that junk...)
FOOD!
(All that take-away and all of that shit...)
FOOD!

[Verse 2]
(I want some McD's... McDonald's!)
So I pull up the drive through
They like to call it the "McDrive"
I'm waiting there for my food
The lady comes, I look in her eyes
I yell "yo!", then I start bussin' up
At the drive through I always joke
I ask for a large orange coke
Or sometimes I ask for a small large fries
(Some chips)
I'm in my early twenties
Pushin' a whip but I'm payin' in pennies
When you get burgers, always check 'em
I eat burgers in fifteen seconds
Ketchup all over my face
Sesame seeds all over the place
As if that wasn't enough to spoil it
Go home spend the rest of my life trapped in the toilet after the lock breaks and no-one hears my screams

[Hook]
FOOD!
(Go home and eat some of that good..)
FOOD!
(After you been out on road, shottin' that...)
FOOD!
(Come get a big munch, munch that...)
FOOD!
(On that idiot ting...but na man...)

[Verse 3]
I ain't got no Ps today
So I sit at my yard and check MySpace
As per usual my belly rumbles
Here comes mum to save the day
I say "good afternoon" fix my face
Then ask mum to fix me a plate
Be polite if she's in a good mood
I know I'll get some of that good food
Rice, plantain, but no ackee
I'm Nigerian, I deal with shaki
Trusst me, it might not sound nice
But I box dat back wid ground rice
I ain't on a hype ting either
I'll wash it down with a glass of water
I when I fill up my tummy
Don't forget to say thank you mummy [Thanks mum, thanks mum]

[outro]
FOOD!...
FOOD!...
FOOD!...
FOOD!...
FOOOD!...
FooD!
