[Intro: Shorty and (Jme)]
Moeshing
Moeshy
Moesh
Moesh
We're just moeshing
We're just moeshing
Moesh
Moesh

[Verse 1: Shorty]
Yo
I wanna know what the moesh is
Phone Jme, see what the moesh is
Why would I sit in my yard, when I could be out with the mandem moeshing
If you've got a buff wifey you're moeshing
You put on your new Nikes you're moeshing
When I spray, night or day, I bet I can make everyone start moeshing
Like Jme, everything's moeshy
5 foot 5 with a goatee
Scar on my face like Tony
But everything's bless, everything's moeshy
If you love Boy Better Know say moesh
If you work hard for your dough say moesh
If you've got an iPhone say moesh
Yeah, dunkno the moesh

[Hook: Shorty and (Jme)]
(Trust me)
(Trust me)
Moesh
(We're moeshing)
We're moeshing
(Trust me)
Trust me
(Ayy, moeshing right now)
Moesh
(M-O-E-S-H)
(Moeshing)

[Verse 2: Jme]
The question that I hear the most
Is yo, Shorty, Jme, what's a moesh?
Fam, it's hard to explain
But basically, it's the opposite of pain
So nowadays, mostly
I do anything that I find moeshy
From, holidays, cruising on the coast
Quick beans on toast, yeah, that's a moesh
Used to be on the strip roasting, but now I'm enjoying my life moeshing
Moesh
That feeling you get when you see that PRS statement come through the post
It's the in ting
Box a whole box of Mr. Kipling (Moesh)
Lyrics sync from my iPad notes, to my iPhone, that is a moesh

[Bridge: Shorty and (JME)]
Jeez
(Trust me)
(Moesh)
Moesh
(You just moeshed)
(When I'm in a rave
I say, I go to the crowd
I say, moesh)
What, what
(They look back, well, now you know what it is)
Moesh
(Moesh)
Moesh

[Verse 3: Shorty and (Jme)]
You know them ones, walking around, after raves, super drunk
See a kebab shop, time to munch
Moesh (Kebab shop rude boy!)
(You know them ones, shopping for garms)
(Ask man if he's got this in your size)
(He goes backstage, returns and says yeah, last one)
(Moesh)
You know them ones, you wake up vexxed
Sitting there thinking "what's next?"
The person you like sends you that text
Moesh
(You know them ones, in your bredrin's yard)
(No 3G reception, got parred)
(Put down your phone and your bredrin gives you the Wi-Fi code)
(Moesh)

[Outro: Shorty and (Jme)]
(Now you know what a moesh is)
Moesh
(You get me?)
Moesh
(Shorty's been saying moesh)
(I've been saying moesh)
(People have been baffed, but now, you know)
Moesh (moesh)
