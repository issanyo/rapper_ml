[Verse 1]
Straight off the mark, now, let me just say
Gun crime's on the rise in the UK
I never thought there would be a day
You could wake up and witness a man spray
I watch the news all the time
I get cold shivers when I see the headlines
Cause I see somebody losing a life
And the life that they lost was similar to mine
Gun crime's on the rise
The only thing that's more on the rise
Than the rise of gun crime is the rise
Of gun lyrics from MC guys
How long will it take till they realise
There's a lot of other things to say besides
Shanks, money, shanks, gash
Shanks, weed, shanks, please, thanks

Don't chat crap please
If you can't make sense, don't MC
Don't chat crap please
There's too much negativity in our scene

[Verse 2]
See, I'm not the same as the rest
I'm not average, I aim for the best
Hate me and say Jme's a pest
But you still feel me like pains in your chest
I came here to mess with the game
Durag looking fresh with the chain
I don't do crime, the rest are to blame
For shooting up the place like Wayne
John or Rooney, it's all the same
The media give the scene a bad name
And they pigeonhole my music like say
They roll with Jme every day
Also, I came here to show
People that think the music's a joke
I make them listen to the beats
There's a lot of sense in the streets

[Hook]
Don't chat crap please
If you can't make sense, don't MC
Don't chat crap please
There's too much negativity in our scene

[Verse 3]
It's cool, everything's still like school
Feds are the teachers who want to rule
I never get shift cause I get good grades
Plus, in maths, I weren't a fool
There's them troublemakers on the streets
They're the kids that won't sit in their seats
All of the teachers know their names
Cause they're in detention twice a week
Detention's the equivalent of jail
Full of the kids that didn't do well
Half of them, the teachers didn't like
Don't deserve to be sitting in the cell
So I just stay out the teacher's way
Get through school, get the best grades
Ignore them brehs that run up their mouth
They'll be in detention one day

[Hook]
Don't chat crap please
If you can't make sense, don't MC
Don't chat crap please
There's too much negativity in our scene
