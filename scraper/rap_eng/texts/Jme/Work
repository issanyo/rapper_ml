[Intro]
Hard work pays off
If you want something, work towards it
Work hard, the harder you work the faster you'll get what you wanna get

[Verse 1]
The only time you've got a TT is if you drink Typhoo and Tetley
My flow's so sick it will uppercut Kimbo Slice, Jackie Chan and Jet Li
You people are gonna respect me, bet I'll make you respect me
This flow's deadly, it will resurrect Bruce Lee to be the famous Dead Lee
The only day that I don't put in work is the 30th of February
Do not fuck with my money, it can be ten bags or 10p
I used to live off my overdraft but now my account is never empty
All my supporters rep me and half of them ain't even met me

[Hook]
I'm putting in work (it's not easy)
Gotta put in that work (trust me)
'Cause I'm putting in work
You gotta put in that work (hard work)
'Cause I'm putting in work (trust me)
You gotta put in that work ('ever you want)
Man are putting in work (anything)
You gotta put in that work (gotta put in that work)
'Cause I'm putting in work (work hard)
You gotta put in that work (it's not easy)
Man are putting in work (trust me)
You gotta put in that work (hard work)

[Verse 2]
I wear snowboarding boots to festivals, you can't tell me about style
You're drinking your lager out on the field... but your name ain't Karl
All the shit you do I've done but I ain't touched alcohol in a while
I used to blaze, I turned 21 then I dropped the munk out just like Jahmaal (what)
I moved on and I dropped smokey out, just like Jamal
I'm the eighth wonder of the world so come see me not the Taj Mahal
You want that Beemer, you want that Merc, money, cars, clothes
Those are the perks but to get there you gotta put in that work

[Hook]
Work (it's not easy)
Gotta put in that work (trust me)
'Cause I'm putting in work
You gotta put in that work (hard work) (trust me)
'Cause I'm putting in work (anything you want)
You gotta put in that work (absolutely anything)
Man are putting in work (you gotta put in that work)
You gotta put in that work (gotta work hard)
'Cause I'm putting in work (trust me)
You gotta put in that work (it's not easy)
Man are putting in work (believe me)
You gotta put in that work (hard work)

[Verse 3]
To those who don't know me: hello
You think you control me? A no
I'm one of the best artists in the world and I leave other MCs below
If you ain't heard of me: hello
Keep up, stop moving S-low
Boy wanna know what Boy Better Know means, for you to find out and for me to know
If you know my face salute, parlez-vous fran√ßais, salut
Je m'appelle JME, let me show you 'round this jungle like Baloo
When you next see my face salute, if not here's some air for you
If it kicks off then jump in first, don't care if it hurts, man put in that work

[Hook]
Work (it's not easy)
Gotta put in that work (trust me)
'Cause I'm putting in work
You gotta put in that work (hard work)
'Cause I'm putting in work (you can get anything)
You gotta put in that work (just put in that work)
Man are putting in work (and work hard)
You gotta put in that work (get it going)
'Cause I'm putting in work (trust me)
You gotta put in that work (nothing's easy)
Man are putting in work (you want it that bad)
You gotta put in that work (hard work)
