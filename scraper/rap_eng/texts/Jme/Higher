[Chorus: Vida Sunshyne]
High five, come at the right time, live up the high life
Select the tune, give me more
Get ready to party again, yo
Jump on the stage, jump up, get aboard
High five, come at the right time, live up the high life
Select the tune, give me more
Get ready to party again, so
Jump on the stage, jump up, let's go

[Verse 1: Solo 45]
Yo, bring a vodka, give me ten bottles
Life in the fast lane, yeah, full throttle
Sat on top and we came from fuck all
Young and rich and we're causing trouble
Buy your next bottle and another bottle
Jump on stage and we're holding the muscle
Check, check, 1, 2, 1, 2, I said (turn me up)
I wake up and wash my mouth with alcohol (yeah)
I leave my number and four fifty notes
Uh, for the girl I met last night at Candy Club, gave my nigga (yeah)
Tequila shots for everyone that knows
Everyone-ev-ev-everyone

[Chorus: Vida Sunshyne]
High five, come at the right time, live up the high life
Select the tune, give me more
Get ready to party again, yo
Jump on the stage, jump up, get aboard
High five, come at the right time, live up the high life
Select the tune, give me more
Get ready to party again, so
Jump on the stage, jump up, let's go

[Verse 2: Solo 45]
Boarding passes straight Magaluf
It's Boy Better Know and we're in Magaluf
Jägerbombs, jägerbombs
It's all about sex and booze
I'll start mosh pits when I'm out with the choobs
Pit stop geezer, pass me the loot
Dip off with, er, what's your name again?

[Bridge: Solo 45]
I'm about that life
Believe me when I say that
26 on a hype
Believe me when I say that
Ohh, that rockstar life
Believe me when I say that
My cash multiplies
Believe me when I say that, yeah

[Bridge: Solo 45]

My cash multiplies
Believe me when I say that, yeah

[Chorus: Vida Sunshyne]
High five, come at the right time, live up the high life

[Verse 3: Jme]
At home or holiday, I'm still whipping
You know I don't drink so whether it's sun or shade
I'm ice cold smoothie sipping
Dun know, airplane, window sitting
People think I'm tripping
I'm Jme, I don't have to fit in
Well, well, well
Look around, can't see Solo, fam he's missing
I'm here going H•A•M to the beat
Put my hands in my pocket
Pulling out euros, pound coins, hand full of each
In love so I take Sand to the beach
People think I'm sweet
I'm Jme, I'll elbow your teet'
Like well, well, well
You will get a elbow drop like, elbow drop like

[Chorus: Vida Sunshyne]
High five, come at the right time, live up the high life
Select the tune, give me more
Get ready to party again, yo
Jump on the stage, jump up, get aboard
High five, come at the right time, live up the high life
Select the tune, give me more
Get ready to party again, so
Jump on the stage, jump up, let's go
