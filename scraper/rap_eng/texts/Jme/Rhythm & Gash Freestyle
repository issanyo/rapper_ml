[Verse 1: Skepta]
I'm calm
I've got the devil in my palm
Know I said that I wear sunglasses at night
But tonight I need to see wagwan
Wanna see somebody drop to the ground
No civilians, no doctors around
Who said life is priceless? So far your life cost me a pound
One phone call and a 10p text
All of my mandem, link up quick
We don't care what ends he reps
When I said he shoulda known, it weren't any old rhyme
Got a couple killers that are never online
Might see the shadow in a video of mine
Standing behind the camera with the director
Ready to shoot an MC one time

[Verse 2: Jme]
Where has everybody gone?
I'm not on that vibe that everybody's on
Some old lame old plain old blatant shame
Till you find out it ain't working (Nah)
One for the Basebox Crew
Krispy…Mc…drive…aye
This ain't a private shubs
Man can wear hats or hoods
No Uggs
It's not a lean up ting (It's not lean up ting)
I don't have a boss
Nobody can tell me there's a clean-up in aisle 5
'Cause I'll drive straight to your door
Then I'll spin and piledrive your face to the floor

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Yeah
Somebody's gotta get murked
Spoke to my mum but that didn't work
Counted to 10 but that didn't work
Blud, man ah putting in work
Switch them plates, man ah going on a ride
Black bally on and I look like a fly
Give mumsie a kiss, tell her you'll home soon
Come to the gate when I pull up on the drive
I don't care if it's raining or not
If we get chased by feds, everybody in the car better know that I'm failing to stop
'Cause like Luis Suárez, these police love taking a shot
But [?] violated the squad
Forget the albums, forget the mixtapes in the shop
Real G's don't procrastinate on the job
Yeah!

[Verse 4: Jme]
I got a black ski mask, but I don’t ski
But I snowboard, dash an MC off-piste
If one of you try and violate me
Get a box in the face with a front door key
Box in the mouth with a back door key
Box in the face with a X6 key
Box in the eye with the fob I use to log into my HSBC
Talk about banks, kill 'em with these
Run up in your girl's house, two of my G’s
Get the money out, put the money in his mouth
Suffocate man with about two G’s
Suffocate man with about four G’s
Suffocate man then I might just breeze
I’ll bury man two foot shallow
Ain’t got time to dig six feet deep
