[Verse 1]
It's been over ten years and I'm still doing it
They've digested your music and shitted it out
But mine, they're still chewingit
I get airplay, unlike you
And if you ask anybody their top five MCs
I guarantee they don't put you in it
You jump on the beat and you just ruin it
Your tunes? Mandem keep slewing it
Your garms? Mandem keep slewing it
Your whip? Mandem keep slewing it
Trust me, you gave me your album, fam
And I honestly don't know what to do with it
Hold it at arms' length
Then drop it in the bin like a nappy with poo-poo in it
Get this straight from now
You sound like me, I don't sound like you, init

[Hook]
No way
You can't do what we do, no way
If we didn't say what we say, nobody would've ever said
Anything that we've ever said to the end of time
No way
You can't do what we do, no way
You can't do what we do, no way
You can't do what we do, no way

[Verse 2]
Selec-le-lecta
You can't test the best, you'll get parred
All of my creps look fresh
Cause you dun know that I rep the Crep Protect hard
Anybody wanna hear a badboy tune?
Then check Jme or check for Skepta
If you're on set with the mandem, trust me
You can't come around and then forget bars
Selec-le-lec
If your CD's on, I press eject
If you borrow my sound, then you better pay back
Or I kick off your door and debt collect
If you ask for a verse and I don't do it
Don't ask again, fam, you best forget
But if you ask again and I don't answer
You are a waste cadet

[Hook]
No way
You can't do what we do, no way
If we didn't say what we say, nobody would've ever said
Anything that we've ever said to the end of time
No way
You can't do what we do, no way
You can't do what we do, no way
You can't do what we do, no way

[Verse 3]
Trust me
Even man like Teddy's on this ting
Killing and burying this ting
Got couple tunes on the telly and this ting
Used to be called Silencer
But he's not silent, so he's rinsing
Now this violent grime is the in ting
So we just rhyme in time, keep listening
I don't know you
Don't chat shit, fam, I will go old-school
Trust, straight up-and-down like yo-yos do
Always smiling like a photoshoot
Boy Better Know, you can see the logo
You man have got no taste like cold tofu
Any beat, any tune, you will just roll through
But not me
Badboy instrumentals only

[Hook]
No way
You can't do what we do, no way
If we didn't say what we say, nobody would've ever said
Anything that we've ever said to the end of time
No way
You can't do what we do, no way
You can't do what we do, no way
You can't do what we do, no way
