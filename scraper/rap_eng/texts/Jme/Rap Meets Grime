[Verse 1: Joe Grind]
Blocka blocka
It's Joey, motherfucker
You thought I was a muppet
Now who's laughing? Waka Waka
I drop a mixtape
And a nigga makes another
Zero, zero, zero
And a nigga didn't stutter
Getting cheddar and some butter
But ain't tryna make a snack
Wanna make a whole mil
With this motherfucking rap
The Ds were on my back
And I could smell a rat
All the cheese was getting eaten
So a nigga left the trap
Now my hustle's international
Got fans in Budapest
And they're telling me I'm sick
A nigga need some Sudafed
Fam, I swear to God
Every song I write, I lose some stress
Get a little off my chest
Or it could just be the cheques that I get
Fam, I said I'm done
Stunting on these niggas
I'm tryna take my leave
Like some hungry caterpillars
Cause fam, I'm eating good
I should invite you round for dinner
But I'm getting my just dessert
Some ice cream, please, vanilla
Sat back, waited till my name got bigger
Now people saying "that's that nigga"
Now niggas getting that skrilla
Skinny boy but I'm worth five figures
You're still fucking around with gorillas
Now I'm fucking around with godzillas
My niggas only fearing God
And nigga, you ain't him, then we're fearless
[?] in case you don't know
You're listening to the sickest
My music gets me money
Respect and lots of bitches
Cause nigga, I'm a winner
You can check out my statistics
This is cinematic music
Makes you think you're in the pictures

[Verse 2: Jme]
Serious, yeah, this is that run up in your house
Put your face on the floor music that man have been waiting for
One verse, nah, there's blatantly more
To take the train off track with C4
I've been stopped and searched so many times
I create my own law
If I was Leonardo DiCaprio
I would have drapsed Kate Winslet straight off the door
Some man knew about Jme
But then they didn't know about Grind
Some man knew about rap
Yeah, but then they didn't know about grime
Bare man are gonna end up in jail
For raping the replay button online
Cuh man are on the same track
Yeah, it's about time
This is that run up in your house, put the tool in your mouth
Music that man have been talking about
Natural flow, I ain't forcing it out
Genius, so of course I'm about
To get that four-door Porsche and a house
That's what I'm on right now
Or it's Kianu Reeves, I'll gun buck Morpheus
And then put both pills in my mouth
You're listening to Jme and Joe
But not Adenuga, bruv
Man that are making music and robbing S
Show me love
When I get irate, pupils dilate
If you try violate, I will annihilate
So if you're thinking about trying it
Don't try, mate
