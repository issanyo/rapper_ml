Listen up
Yo, this is Derkhead
You've all been waiting for Derkhead
You had Shh Hut Yuh Muh and Poomplex
And Wasteman, now Derkhead
In case you don't know
Cause you're so slow, or you're a derkhead
It's slang that I use
Or sometimes I say derk-derk-head-dead
When I'm on the roads
P town soldiers behind the shops
Badderman skanking, everybody knows
You can't rob man, you derkhead
I'm leaving man, don't miss me, fiends
You can catch me in Krispy Kremes
McD's carpark, [?]
Don't chat to me, you derkhead
Derkhead is my CD
Come to London, you might see me
The durag-wearing IC3
In the studio, your derkhead
Derkhead, Edition 3
Shh Hut Yuh Muh and Poomplex CDs
Sold out quicktime, big Jme
You know I'm not a derkhead
This is Derkhead
You've all been waiting for Derkhead
You had Shh Hut Yuh Muh and Poomplex
And Wsteman, now Derkhead
Yo, this is Derkhead
You've all been waiting for Derkhead
You had Shh Hut Yuh Muh and Poomplex
And Wasteman, now derk-derk-head-head
Serious, J-M-E
Vibesing massive
That's cool, that's cool
