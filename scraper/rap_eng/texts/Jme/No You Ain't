Sick? No you ain't!
Coming to the rave with a stick? No you ain't!
Top three? No you ain't!
Leveling up with me? No you ain't!
Brave? No you ain't!
Getting reloads on stage? No you ain't!
Grime? No you ain't!
Represent all of the time? No, safe!
Sick? No you ain't!
Coming to the rave with a stick? No you ain't!
Top three? No you ain't!
Leveling up with me? No you ain't!
Brave? No you ain't!
Getting reloads on stage? No you ain't!
Grime? No you ain't!
Represent all of the time? No, safe!

[Verse 1]
I came to this planet, a 8lbs caesarean
Now, I'm a badman-arean
Apologies to all aquariums
But I roll with couple pescetarians, Vegans and vegetarians
An' a few rastafarians
Man don't wanna see no dead meat on their plate like some barbarians
I'm a 80's baby the best MC lately? maybe
Cos I'm getting played on the D-A-B while you're in the rave doing D-A-B's
JME, 80's baby the best MC lately? maybe
Cos I'm getting played on the D-A-B
While you're in the rave doing D-A-B's

[Verse 2]
I've always got new tunes for the car
But I need to get a new car for the streets
I wanna get that P85D and alcantara seats
If you see me and the light goes green
0 to 60 off the mark it's peak
They say you are what you eat
So go against me and you're dead meat
I'm representing, with the new flow I'm inventing
Pay the mortgage, I'm not renting
Yep, my fiance is a peng ting
If a man violates, I'm venting
Trust it won't be a draw for the leng ting
And it won't be a count to 10 ting
Straight in his forehead I'm denting

[Verse 3]
0, 1, 2, 3 then my speech when man's on the mic
Say what I want, give a damn when I like
Any month of the year, I'm hype
January, February, March, April, May
I put my fist through your teeth
Elbow drop with elbow grease
Old school kid man, alphabet beats
A, B, C, D, E
F your crew and gang
When I get hype when your with 8 man
Any day of the week I'm nang
Monday, Tuesday, when's it gonna stop?
When you realize I'm that guy, that's right
I go harder than using a toothpick to eat a bowl of rice
