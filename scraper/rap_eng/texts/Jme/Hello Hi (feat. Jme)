[Verse 2: JME]
Hello hi, its a pleasure to meet you
Yep, JME is on the riddim again
Big Narstie is with him again
Why do you two keep fucking up shit?
Cause mans gassed, don't ask me questions please
When we come through, everybody just freeze
Badboy crep and you ain't got these, see what I'm sayin'?
Like a schoolkid with his arms crossed, I told man I ain't playin'
I weren't sayin' nothing but you kept sayin' what are you sayin'
So now I'm fucking Super Saiyan
Bruv sit down, before i start spinnin' ya around
And your ankle smash on the door, fam
Dullah's given you beats already, you do not need anymore

[Hook]
