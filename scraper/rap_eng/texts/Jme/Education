[Intro]
Stay in school, stay off the roads
As easy as it sounds, it's quite hard to keep to in today's society
Loads of things leading you astray, different street activities

[Verse 1]
You won't make it nowhere as a crook
So put down your gun and pick up your books
You can either go to the police station
Or go school and get an education
You wanna be a rudeboy? Whatever
It's not big and it's certainly not clever
The rate of gun crime is going up
So people, please listen up, listen up
I don't wanna tell you again
Put down your knife and pick up your pen
Don't cause an abomination
Instead, just pass your examination
Get good grades and say 'em loud
Go straight home and make your mum proud
Trust me, as hard as it seems
Education is the key to your dreams

[Break]
That's what my mum used to tell me every single day
Education is the key to your dreams
It sticks with you forever, you never lose your education ever, yeah?
Listen to your parents, they've got years of experience on you Serious

[Verse 2]
It's cool, everything's still like school
Police are the teachers who want to rule
I don't get arrested, I get good grades
Cause in maths, I weren't a fool
There's them troublemakers on the streets
There's them troublemakers on the streets
They're the kids that won't sit in their seats
All of the teachers know their names
Cause they're in detention twice a week
Detention's the equivalent of jail
Full of the kids that didn't do well
Half of them, the teachers don't like
Don't deserve to be sitting in the cell
But I just stay out the teacher's way
Get through school, get the best grades
Ignore the kids that run up their mouth
Cause they'll be in detention one day

[Outro]
I hope you learnt something from today's lesson
Education is the key to your dreams
Education
