[Chorus: Joe Grind]
These man think they're nice pon di riddim
Ain't nice pon di riddim like man
These man might put fire on the riddim
Can't fire pon di riddim like man
These man talk 'bout ride pon di riddim
Can't ride pon di riddim like man
These man might shine pon di riddim
But can't shine pon di riddim, not like man
These man think they're nice pon di riddim
Ain't nice pon di riddim like man
These man might put fire on the riddim
Can't fire pon di riddim like man
These man talk 'bout ride pon di riddim
Can't ride pon di riddim like man
These man might shine pon di riddim
But can't shine pon di riddim, not like man

[Verse 1: Joe Grind]
These man ain't that nice pon di riddim
Ain't ice pon di riddim like man
They ain't got that fire
And they're not like man
Dem love talk 'bout fire
But dem not like man
Dem little pricks won't fire
But they love screaming "gang"
I'm round criminals
I won't mention names, no subliminals
Don't care for fame, they're not MCs
If I say murk a man then that's literal
I mean literal
You don't want this get physical
My network gives me bare data
So I just gotta give these 3 Gâ€™s the signal
I don't send for man, I just send for man
If I send a man then it's over
You're offending man, I'll remember man
Best remember man when man's closer
No, sir
You don't want me write your name on my rota
If I make time for you, then that's your time
And you know what time that means for you, doja
Stay up off of man's zone-a
Leave man talking shit backwards
These man sounding like Yoda
These man must've smoked backwards
Weed's got them sounding like Hodor
Dem man keep moving different
Dem man must be bipolar

[Chorus: Joe Grind]
These man think they're nice pon di riddim
Ain't nice pon di riddim like man
These man might put fire on the riddim
Can't fire pon di riddim like man
These man talk 'bout ride pon di riddim
Can't ride pon di riddim like man
These man might shine pon di riddim
But can't shine pon di riddim, not like man
These man think they're nice pon di riddim
Ain't nice pon di riddim like man
These man might put fire on the riddim
Can't fire pon di riddim like man
These man talk 'bout ride pon di riddim
Can't ride pon di riddim like man
These man might shine pon di riddim
But can't shine pon di riddim, not like man

[Verse 2: Jme]
Serious, when I touch mic
I bring vibe to the riddim, I
Hype, lyrics from left to the right
And a bit of style in the middle, I
Try, slow tempo or grime
Man's versatile on the riddim like
It's like cocaine cause man get high
Off the lines that I give them like
"It's live"? No, it isn't
Stop lying, you can't run no schism
I'm flying from country to country
Cause I spit ill, spit sick bed riddim
Been a while since I had to get ill and
Flame up your whole crew, take you with 'em
Feed 'em to the lions, get rid of 'em
Like Solo 45 on the riddim like

[Verse 3: Ghetts]
Mass murderer
How many MCs have I killed?
But they can't put me in a box, man's circular
No triangles here, man's curvier
What you saying?
What you know 'bout AM?
Ayy
Bang bang, man's earlier
What's your name again?
I can't say that I've heard of ya
If you don't think that I would
Just know man's furniture
I'll come through with the curtains shut
Mic check 1-2, don't turn me up, I'm just turning up
With Mike or one or two burglars
You want arms? I'm Ursula

[Chorus: Joe Grind]
These man think they're nice pon di riddim
Ain't nice pon di riddim like man
These man might put fire on the riddim
Can't fire pon di riddim like man
These man talk 'bout ride pon di riddim
Can't ride pon di riddim like man
These man might shine pon di riddim
But can't shine pon di riddim, not like man
These man think they're nice pon di riddim
Ain't nice pon di riddim like man
These man might put fire on the riddim
Can't fire pon di riddim like man
These man talk 'bout ride pon di riddim
Can't ride pon di riddim like man
These man might shine pon di riddim
But can't shine pon di riddim, not like man
