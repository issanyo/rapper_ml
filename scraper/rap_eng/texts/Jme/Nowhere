[Chorus: S-X]
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Cause you know me, yeah you know me
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't goin (sick of me, get rid of me)
Cause you know me, yeah you know me

[Verse 1: Jme]
(Serious)
How long can a man stay right at the top of the game of zero shaken
And I mean zero shaken
Bad man round here, no platin'
I am a hero chasing after that vibe that they're all makin'
Can't keep up round here no pacin'
Send him to the moon now aerospacin'
I will not budge
I will not lose, let go of that grudge, you're not a judge
Talk about lead cool, rub that you will get smudged
They said if you can't beat them join them
But how can they join if we avoid them
They just get annoyed, I will destroy them
Simple

[Chorus: S-X]
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Cause you know me, yeah you know me
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going (sick of me, get rid of me)
Cause you know me, yeah you know me

[Verse 1: S-X]
I'm here to stay cause this is no accident
You lying but swearing to God my [?] Is so blasphemous
Talking while our backs turned just know it's coming back to us
Going nowhere fast but actually surpassing ya yeah
But should I be shocked though
I work too hard to be part hold
And you think im going to slow down
Jme we can't be stopped bro
Maybe not so, why would you think I care for?
I dont own trousers just wear shorts
Boy better know that IAMME that's what I do my hair for
They're hiding and I know where
It ain't even happened yet although they're
Speaking about it like it's progress
That energy I'm over
Still I ain't going

[Chorus: S-X]
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Cause you know me, yeah you know me
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going (sick of me, get rid of me)
Cause you know me, yeah you know me

Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Cause you know me, yeah you know me
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going
Nowhere I ain't going (sick of me, get rid of me)
Cause you know me, yeah you know me
