Oh right then..
Man jumped on the train on a late ting
Bare face, no ticket bate ting
Bare eidyats on the platform waiting
And I ain't sitting in a seat
Man will headlock the ticket inspector
I'm not after no dibby dibby pees
Better make it big like Chippy and Skepta
Bruv I'm sick on the mic don't hate

I'm sick on the decks too
Sick on the beat, sick fucking 'ell
Sick, so much sickness
That shit mcs can't spit with me still
Cause I'm so sick on the mic, don't hate
I'm sick decks too
Sick on the beat, sick fucking 'ell
Sick, so much sickness
That shit mcs can't spit with me still I can tell

You get me, man hopped on the train with my bredrin
What you looking at? On a reckless ting
Playing music loud on my phone
Anyone that don't like it should've walked
Home
You get me, what's man saying?
Bare commuters staring in my face if you
Don't like me come off the damn
Train
Man better know about man like me
Bruv no mc test
No man chat no bullshit
No-one gets nowhere
There's no point boy better know
Don't try no shit
Better know about man like me
Bruv no mc test
No man chat no bullshit
No-one gets nowhere
There's no point boy better know
Don't try no shit fam

Peak, I'm illegally train surfing
I make big man cry like a birth ting
I'm a lyrical boss in fact
You don't wanna see me jump from the train to the tracks
J m e, spit lyrics until my brain is empty
The most complex plainest MC
Black Zeus...hmm...cuz
