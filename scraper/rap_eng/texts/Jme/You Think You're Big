[Verse 1 - Dot Rotten]
Show me respect
I spray like Angelina Jolie holding a tech
Only the best can bang with me cause
My gang go deeper, call us sea-thugs
So deep in the Glock you'll see slugs
Or seashores, you'll get beat up
Forget the details
When I sneak up you'll finally sleep well
So keep your beak shut
You can speak tough I'll split your peanut
Prove that you'll beat stuff, that's be-snuff
You'll stamp with the screwface, I'll be smuck
I'm in the next levels best your speed up
Or you can eat dust, violate and
You'll get more pee in your chi then a concreduff
More beef in the streets so I bring heaters
Your team couldn't beat me in your dreams cuz

[Verse 2 - Brutal]
Listen
Ey man don't know what big is
Blud to us, you man are all midgets
Just wait till' I finished
Ain't no space when I'm in here, I'll be the biggest
That flow's rubbish, might as well bin it
It's blatant I'm winning, look at my face and I'm grinning
I'll be the quickest, and I'm 16 just like my differ
If I ain't big, I don't know what big is
Cause I'm large, you man are just big-ish
I'm Albus, you man are just Winnies
I'm a bottle of Cris, you man are just Guinness
See I run this ting, you man are just in it
I've already won, you're still are trying to win it (what's the point?)
No more space to waste the game
It's already got a lot of shit in it

[Verse 3 - Griminal]
Yo, Yo
Keep wishing and hoping
Wanna be big try drinking a potion
That's the only way our whole prep praise
I'm still the reason he still thinking I'm joking
Rudeboy you must be drinking and smoking
Bare Chung out man are licking and poking
Them man are sweet-boy stinking the lotion
Man are like Griminal's sick they are soaking
Why, I draw the ting they open
I keep the eyeballs blinking and rolling
I bet MC's start bitching and moaning
No don't speak, you don't know me
I flow so deep, you think I'm an ocean
Try get away you sinking and soaking
I stay more fresh then a tic-tac
Them man are so old they wrinkling and molted


[Hook - Griminal & JME X4)
Alright Rudeboy, allow the hype
