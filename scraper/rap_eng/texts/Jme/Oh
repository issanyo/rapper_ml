[Hook: Special K & Jewels]
I wanna make you say oh
I wanna make you say oh
And all them places that you wanna go, just let me know
And if you're ready, we'll go
I wanna make you say oh
I wanna make you say oh
And all them places that you wanna go, just let me know
And if you're ready, we'll go

[Verse 1: Jme]
J-M-E
I'm constantly singing your praises
Constantly using your phrases
We argue a bit and then we make up
And you know what my favourite phase is
In my passenger seat at night
If you're driving then you're on the right
Or the window seat of the flight
Either which way, you're still by my side
Yeh, that's the moesh
I'm humble but I have to boast
Look out the window, that's the coast
So all the places that you wanna go, just let me know
And if you're ready, we'll go

[Hook: Special K & Jewels]
I wanna make you say oh
I wanna make you say oh
And all them places that you wanna go, just let me know
And if you're ready, we'll go
I wanna make you say oh
I wanna make you say oh
And all them places that you wanna go, just let me know
And if you're ready, we'll go

[Verse 2]
Unconditional love
It's not about looks, you can put on your worst face
Got to the point where I think that
You're the reason I'm here in the first place
Holding my hand on the street
Limousine, cruising in the back seat
Or in front of a cinema screen
Either which way, you're still next to me
Yeah, that's the ting
On your left hand, that's the ring
Look out the window, that's the wing
So all the places that you wanna go, just let me know
And if you're ready, we'll go

[Hook: Special K & Jewels]
I wanna make you say oh
I wanna make you say oh
And all them places that you wanna go, just let me know
And if you're ready, we'll go
I wanna make you say oh
I wanna make you say oh
And all them places that you wanna go, just let me know
And if you're ready, we'll go
