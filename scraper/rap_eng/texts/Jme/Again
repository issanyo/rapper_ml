[Intro]
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road, road, road, road, road
Road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again

[Verse 1: Jme]
Fake Gs
In their fake jeans
Can't even pull off ACs
About they wanna rob MCs
Tense
Can't rob Jme, hence
Thinking about investing in the wrong things
When my cheque-payers like Tempz
I don't need a chain or champs
I don't need no fame or paps
On road
Everyone's rating man like iPhone apps
Fam, I don't owe you jack
My album goes hard like old Blu-Tack
You're the type of guy to start an argument
Then ask man to hold you back
You see dem man there?

[Hook: Jme]
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again

[Verse 2: D Double E]
I'm on the road again
On road looking for my foes again
Man try step on my toes again
Cause he thinks that he's big and bold again
Gonna make a man jump like toad again
Unleash and reload again
Ammunition, I've got a load of them
If it's me that you think you're colder than
We'll see, when they get a hold of them
Your crew better get a hold of them
My dogs, they guard me like Doberman
When I let em off the leash, they go for them
What about now? Got a screw loose
Normally I've got my head screwed on in life
Manaman tryna move on
But look what these dickheads have got me on

[Hook: Jme]
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again

[Verse 3: Jme]
You think you're real
Fam, I'm real too
And that's the reason behind your hate
Cause I'm a successful yout
Trust me, pain
I know how it feels
What'd you think made me get off my arse
And do what man can't even do with a deal?
Man used to have limited money
Now I've got Boy Better Know Limited money
Yeah, self-employment
Wealth enjoyment
And I'm tryna enjoy it
But you're getting me annoyed
So anyone that's dissed my mum
Suck your dead great gran through your dad's batty crease, rudeboy

[Hook: Jme]
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
They've got me on the road again
