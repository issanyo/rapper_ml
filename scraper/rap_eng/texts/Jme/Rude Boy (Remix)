[Verse 1: Tally]
So what's the deal?
Tropicana, kind of shit you could find in Brazil
This shit is real
Chilling with the niggas and you know they got license to kill
So, I need a kilo
Got a fiver on me, I'mma buy me some Doritos
You ain't got the reload?
Oh, you a Pookie nigga
You just acting like you Rico

[Hook: Angel]
Why they wanna call my name?
I don't really talk much when they talk tough
Cause I don't wanna catch no case
Man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner
If they ever call my name
I let it off, let it off, let it off, let it off
Cuh man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
Man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner
With a Riri on my arm and my armour saying cici
Fuckboy, mi no talk much, mi no tweet tweet
Trap, buss your Twitter fingers when you see me
If you put a finger on my gang
I might take the finger off your hand
But leave you right there where you stand
Got some young niggas that'll kill you with the gab
I grew around the best, they said it's all about the money
Anyting a anyting for Mummy
I care for my mother, I shed tears for my mother
Picking what we gonna wear for the summer
That's rare in the gutter, see, I care for me
So I care for you like you care for me
And I've seen how you share with your runner
How you tryna keep it 1000 with a oner?

[Hook: Angel]
Why they wanna call my name?
I don't really talk much when they talk tough
Cause I don't wanna catch no gaze
Man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner
If they ever call my name
I let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
Cuh man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner

[Verse 3: Jme]
Yo, yo, yo, put this on replay
Young Gs buy a drink, split it three ways
Man'll use their schoolbook for a replay
Living life based off what we say
When you're spitting on the beat
You're spitting on the street, fam, you're selling them a dream
I wish man told me when I was a teen
Dead food, dead beef, dead cuisine, dead
With no charger
Tell a man fix up, work harder
See him in pharm but he's not a farmer
Wanna place blame on no father
Man ah man ah have got canerow, no barber
Man ah man ah run the radio like Sama
Man a run the TV like a drama
Mum and Dad are cool now, now a holla

[Hook: Angel]
Why they wanna call my name?
I don't really talk much when they talk tough
Cause I don't wanna catch no gaze
Man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner
If they ever call my name
I let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
Cuh man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner

[Hook: Angel]
Why they wanna call my name?
I don't really talk much when they talk tough
Cause I don't wanna catch no gaze
Man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner
If they ever call my name
I let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
Cuh man ah man ah rudeboy from the corner
