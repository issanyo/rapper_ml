[Chorus: Manga]
I’m saying my time is now
If I’m in it for a penny, then I’m in it for a pound
Work rate goes up and it won’t go down
I’m saying my time is now
My time is now
If I’m in it for a penny, then I’m in it for a pound
Work rate goes up and it won’t go down
I’m saying my time is now
My time is now
Cuh my ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up different
I ain’t like them and they ain’t like me
My ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up different
I ain’t like them and they ain’t like me

[Verse 1: Manga]
We set tings, tings nuh set we
Man are separate from these internet chiefs
Different type of intellect, we
Don’t bother penny for what them man do
No joke man, they can’t tek man for meme
And I’m myself, anywhere and anytime
No boy can't reconfigurate me
I got style upon style, man a got style upon style
Them man there can’t style on me
Direct or indirect
No fake badboy can intimidate me
Them man can’t upset my settings
I’m living my life with next type of tekkers
And word to Poet, man's separate
Man flex and finesse, then I exit

[Chorus: Manga]
(Cah) If I’m in it for a penny, then I’m in it for a pound
Work rate goes up and it won’t go down
I’m saying my time is now
My time is now
If I’m in it for a penny, then I’m in it for a pound
Work rate goes up and it won’t go down
I’m saying my time is now
My time is now
Cuh my ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up different
I ain’t like them and they ain’t like me
My ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up different
I ain’t like them and they ain’t like me

[Verse 2: Jme]
Them man are on some default settings
Us man are global, Heathrow settings
Man think that I’m gonna stop, how?
My time is now and it's never not now
I’m the final boss
Remember when man used to window shop
Now I’ll make a beat, write a bar
Six months later, buy the car
Fam, different ting
Man's buying in bulk, shipment ting
I remember walking home from school
With the man dem, sharing chips and ting
Nowadays man are still sharing chips
But same time, I book the man dem trips
Lend man whips
You ain't like me
Don’t let me hear my name out your lips

[Verse 3: President T]
(My ting's patterned up) Patterned up more than most
Prez, I heard you’re coming in burnt
More than toast
Dem man there caught you slipping
Seriously false
In it for a penny, took all the pounds
In it for a sample, took all the sounds
Country spots, don’t make me laugh
Took all the towns
Violence, I would never talk on stage
I was a turbo without the gauge
Are you earning a wage?
The rate goes up
And it won’t go down
I use mine like water
I beg you please, don’t go drown
My ting's patterned up, all type of modes
Still presidential, all kinda loads

[Chorus: Manga]
If I’m in it for a penny, then I’m in it for a pound
Work rate goes up and it won’t go down
I’m saying my time is now
My time is now
If I’m in it for a penny, then I’m in it for a pound
Work rate goes up and it won’t go down
I’m saying my time is now
My time is now
Cuh my ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up different
I ain’t like them and they ain’t like me
My ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up different
I ain’t like them and they ain’t like me

[Verse 4: Mercston]
Penny, pound, dollar, from Bow like Rascal are
Man's asked me for a verse, it's my honour
Let me put the beat in a hearse, yeah, my clobber
Dem man are Swindon Town and man are Barcelona
It's your girl I was on-a?
If that's your girl, how did I pattern her like that?
Sending me pics and I ain't banging her like that
Said her baby father ain't got stamina like man
Man are styler before Lyca
Man's balling, fuck a biter
When I buss mic, unnu flash your lighter
You know how I get down in a cypher, different
Yeah, everyting [?]
One time for Jess
Hold up, tell all dem niggas they ain't ready for me
And tell them all of the [?] for me
Pizzazz and ready to re-aim
Got the devil on me, wait there
[?] Mayfair
Pure pattern up, jeans tapered
Man's super with no cape here
Dem man are sleeping, I've been awake here
Why you looking at my kettle? Go on, take it
Fuck Trident, man are [?]
I don't buy your poker face
So just buy me a pokey face, what you saying?
And camo ballys are overplayed
If they ain't black, they ain't cold again, what you saying?
My ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up differently
They only know about [?]

[Chorus: Manga]
If I’m in it for a penny, then I’m in it for a pound
Work rate goes up and it won’t go down
I’m saying my time is now
My time is now
If I’m in it for a penny, then I’m in it for a pound
Work rate goes up and it won’t go down
I’m saying my time is now
My time is now
Cuh my ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up different
I ain’t like them and they ain’t like me
My ting's patterned up, my ting's patterned up different
I ain’t like them and they ain’t like me
