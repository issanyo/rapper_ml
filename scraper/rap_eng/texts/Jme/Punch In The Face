[Intro]
J-M-E
I've had enough of these fake gangsters
Like they don't feel pain, never felt pain
Like they don't have any family
They haven't fallen in love
Or haven't watched television
Or they don't eat and sleep
They think they're waterproof, fireproof, everything-proof
I just think they're idiots

[Verse]
Punch in the face
Punch in the face
Nobody wants a punch in the face
That's why everybody rolls in a group
Or with a mash, Or with a baseball bat in case
They chat waste
To the wrong person and get a punch in the face
Now he can't go out with his friends
He has to jam and shot in the ends
Shot in the ends, shot in the ends
Another little kid gets shot in the ends
Everybody on the TV and the media wanna blame his family and friends
But true say we all know his family and friends didn't manufacture them skengs
The governments in control
And that's why everybody's bored on road
Bored on road, bored on road
Another little kid gets bored on road
What, what, who stabbed him?
Everybody knows but no-one disobeys the street code
Cause if your talk to the feds, your bredrins will go into skeng man mode
And when they get vexed
You'll have your hands in the air like your doing a stretch
Doing a stretch, doing a stretch
Another black boy is doing a stretch
Coulda' been avoided if he woulda' stayed in school
And learnt punctuation like Wretch
But instead he got into beef on road and shot a guy in his chest
What happened to the days
When you would just get a punch in the face?
What's the meaning of JME? Jack man everyday blatantly
No, your mistaken see, my birthname ain't escaping me
What's the meaning of JME? Jack man everyday blatantly
No, you're mistaken, my name's Jamie
Also known as O-O-D
Cause If I got a G I'm GOOD
Plus bare girls know me for the ood
But I ain't happy with a G, I wanna get HIJKLMNOP
I member sayin' that when I was 3
I used to say JKmenamenaP
My teacher who taught me my alphabet
Now I'm sellin him Cd's
Gimme half a chance and I'm sellin' him a tee
Put on the Tee shirt, tell'I'm in a G
Boy Better Know
All the girls will try and sweet him up, like he's cinnamon and cream
Groupie love, yeah that's what I wanna se
Pull my clothes whilst I'm spittin' on the beat
Buy another tee shirt then, Cause
Why'd you think their all hollarin at me?
