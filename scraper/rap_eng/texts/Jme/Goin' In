I don't believe Jammer's sleeping, ohhhhh

[Hook: Boy Better Know]
We're goin' in

[Skepta]
Boy Better Know music, my pinky looks like the white side of the rubix
Oi BBR, tell them what it's like when we go to the bar (stupid!)
You get me BBR?
You ain't got to look up in the sky for a star

[JME]
Just look in my face, you know who we are
Back back, rewind the track back
Don't give me back chat, DJ jack that shit
Anytime you see me put my phone to my ear, that means Barclays, Halifax, trust me

[Skepta]
Right now your looking at the best MCs in the country
Them man fell off the wall like Humpty
But I'm on a grime ting like Logan
I got a new ting, I call it Hulk Hogan

[Boy Better Know]
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Jammer]
The rasta's ready
Them man are gassed on telly, we've got the stacks already
Them man are eating late, us man are fat already

[Frisco]
Yeah no more hunger
You'll get a punch so quick in your face, you wouldn't know who it is like a private number

[Hook: Boy Better Know x2]

[Frisco]
I've been a skeng from ages ago
Yes I know that you heard that before, but the gyaldem said I was too hardcore
Gyal dem are like "Fris, gimme more, gimme more"
You man are stuck in the yard, us man are living it large getting money on tour

[BBR]
And overly sure, when we mc the crowd don't cheer they overly roar
Come along yeah I overly bore, up, down, up, down, she goes, I see she's overly sore

[JME]
And a round house kick will take off the door
So please don't tell me nothing
I'm a big kid like Benjamin Button
Roundhouse, hurricane, bicycle kick
Kung fu kick if the door is shuttin

[Jammer]
Kung fu kick like Karate Kid!

[Skepta]
Manna get mad like Sycho Sid

[JME]
Yeah, top turnbuckle business

[Frisco]
So don't run it up when I know where you live

[Jammer]
Who is it? Who is it? You know who it is

[BBR]
We are lyrically taking the piss

[Frisco]
And I'll go into skengman mode that's Fris

[JME]
