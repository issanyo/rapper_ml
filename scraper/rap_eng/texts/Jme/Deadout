[Verse 1]
When I started the game, I picked up a pad
Every time I check, I got more dough
I can't die now, I've only got one life
I've mastered the levels, I am a pro
I'm clocking the game so fast
Other players wanna look at my pad
Nah, not Super Mario
It's the music game, blud are you mad
Don't talk to me about guns
I will chief up you on my ones
Don't talk to me about triggers
I will chief up all of you niggas
Don't talk to me about cars
I will chief up all of you spars
Don't talk to me about ends
You batty

[Hook]
You can't MC just (get out)
You're tired, your eyes are (red out)
You heard what I said, you need to go bed
Blud your flow is (deadout)
You can't MC just (get out)
You're tired, your eyes are (red out)
You heard what I said, you need to go bed
Blud your flow is (deadout)

[Verse 2]
Serious, is what I said on the tune
Now man wanna ring my phone
Before serious, nobody knew
Jme touched microphone
Now there's certain guys on the scene
Who believe that they've got the right
To phone my phone and ask me
For tunes at all time of the night
Everybody knows that's takin' the piss
Boy better know, you're making me diss
I come to your studio, everything's bless
Then I start smashing up your mixing desk
I don't care I'll break it, till it can't be repaired
Them way there
Cos you're swoog, you know the coo
Your fans could write better lyrics than you

[Hook]
You can't MC just (get out)
You're tired, your eyes are (red out)
You heard what I said, you need to go bed
Blud your flow is (deadout)
You can't MC just (get out)
You're tired, your eyes are (red out)
You heard what I said, you need to go bed
Blud your flow is (deadout)

[Verse 3]
I don't care if you've got 92 straps
Don't think you can copy my chat
Listen to Prez T, cool and relax
Or your lower jawbone will get couple slaps
This MC thing ain't making you P
You're shook of me I'm making you pee
Piss your pants when you hear Jme
Everybody knows
Don't talk the talk about blessy
Cos right now my flow is messy
Don't talk the talk about bucky
Cos right now my flow is mucky
Don't talk the talk about shotty
Cos right now my flow is dutty
Don't talk the talk about gatty
Cos right now your flow is batty

[Hook]
You can't MC just (get out)
You're tired, your eyes are (red out)
You heard what I said, you need to go bed
Blud your flow is (deadout)
You can't MC just (get out)
You're tired, your eyes are (red out)
You heard what I said, you need to go bed
Blud your flow is (deadout)
