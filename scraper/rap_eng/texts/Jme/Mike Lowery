Bare man get signed to a label, but they ain't got no talent, you know what the switch is?
You're not gonna be famous this time next year, so you better take pictures!
You know me since '03 putting out music each year, consistent
All you A&R's at labels this time next year, you'll be my assistants
Wait
Lemme tie up my durag, I'mma start parring
I just smashed a mirror, walked under a ladder but nuttin' ain't gwarnin'
When I touch mic, bare man start shaking their head, some man start barlin'
Cause I'm a badman, and I got bare stripes on my arm, like I've been self-harming
I do what the fuck I want, trust me fam, I don't give a shit about karma
I'm not always in the bits, but the bits are in me like Tropicana
Some man acting dumb, think's he's a gun-man, wanna bring me drama
How you gonna bun me? I'll bun you like the sun bun man in Ghana
Jamie Adenuga, successful Nigerian like Tinie
I'mma keep doing this music ting, regardless if a record label don't sign me
My supporters know JME can't do nothing else but keep it grimey
Asking me what genre I make is a stupid question like "Where's Wiley?"

I got people asking themselves how I made it here, it's a mystery
Cause in 2008, you could have booked JME for 350
I never dissed no-one to get here, still, even though some man diss me
You got "Blam!" and you got "Famous?" but now you need to check out the "History"
Longevity in the UK music, Boy Better Know it's not easy
Been about since RWD Forum with Ashman and Ceazy
And Iceberg Kid; man see me on road and they wanna act greezy
Yeah, I don't have a strap but I definitely slap man in 3D
You don't need a hundred girls to make you feel like some big man, Jamie
My dad told me and showed me, real men spend their life with one lady
So I found my princess, and made sure no female can sway me
When I'm out ravin, there's ladies left, right and centre, but I just daydream
Mash up the rave, collect the P, hit the road - crazy
Pull up at the lights, as usual boys in shit whips wanna race me
Wind down the window, all three man in the whip wanna get facety
Get a three kill-streak, get a spy plane, jump on a aeroplane like Stacey
