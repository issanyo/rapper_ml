[Intro]
JME, it's JME
It's JME
Serious

[Verse 1]
Boy Better Know, CEO
Boy Better Know, CEO
That's me, JME, so shh hut yuh muh
You need to type up your CV, Microsoft Word
That's you, you're a nerd
Stop MCing, go to the shops
Have a drink, it's me JME
Big lyrics, chat these daily
On front line like a Israeli
Had enough now, eff you, pay me
What? Your lyrics are poor
Don't compare them to mine, I'm raw
And uncut, you best look at the floor
That's what I thought, awoh

[Hook]
I'm a MC
When I'm not on duty
I go home build tunes on Fruity
I put the TV on mute
Have a drink, but I don't blaze
I'm a badman
I don't run out of fuel
Any MCs wanna come have a duel?
About you ain't heard of me
You dun know I'm the JM...

[Verse 2]
Boy Better Know I'm a P-R-O
Boy Better Know, P-R-O
That's me, JME, so Shh Hut Yuh Muh
JME, I roll on my own
You'll see me, but not my cainrow
If you try mess with my durag
I will dislocate your nose
Furthermore I'll sprain your lip
Plain and simp'
Box you up as if you are David Blaine and shit
You should sit and pray, I quit
You will time travel, knock you out
Make you see later, quick
When you wake up, blatant sick, awoh

[Hook]
I'm a MC
When I'm not on duty
I go home build tunes on Fruity
I put the TV on mute
Have a drink, but I don't blaze
I'm a badman
I don't run out of fuel
Any MCs wanna come have a duel?
About you ain't heard of me
You dun know I'm the JM...

[Verse 3]
Boy Better Know, where I go
Boy Better Know, where I go
Yes me, JME, so Shh Hut Yuh Muh
Live in north, Uni in south
Radio in east, so shut your mouth
Don't talk to me about ends
I will chief up all of your friends
Everybody knows JME
In videos, on TV
Don't get rude, blud, I said "DON'T GET RUDE"
Look out for my face
You'll see it more and more each day
On billboards, cause I'm the best
You can't ignore, awoh

[Hook 2]
I'm a MC
When I'm not on duty
I go home build tunes on Fruity
I put the TV on mute
Have a drink, but I don't blaze
I'm left-handed
My mum calls me lefty
I got serious lyrics, they're hefty
But my name ain't Geoff
Can you hear me, are you..?
My name's Jamie, I am my own person
Shh, or situation will worsen
I don't try MC like you, cause I don't want to be like..
I'm a badman
I don't run out of fuel
Any MCs wanna come have a duel?
About you ain't heard of me
You dun know I'm the JM...
