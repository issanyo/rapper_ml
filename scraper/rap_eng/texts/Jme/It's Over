[Verse 1: Jme]
Wait, why? All of a sudden, yeah
It seems like I'm the guy who's trying to try
But I swear, three months before this
You was the one who cried
Remember? You was at work, belling me at work
Telling me you can't work cause of me and her
But now it's me belling you
But you don't answer, not even to private number
It seems like your feelings are dead
Why's he on your mind when it should be me in your head?
You won't begin to understand
What goes through my mind, I keep it in like a man
It's cause I don't own you
But I know you properly, and since you've got with me
I've tried to show you
Some nights, I've tried to phone you, but

[Hook: Julie Adenuga]
Jamie, don't you know
I'm not gonna answer my phone
Don't call me at home
It's over
It's over
It's over
It's over, Jamie
It's over

[Verse 2: Jme]
Like Mariah, you hit them high notes
No more fivers, I'm hitting high notes
But I could have all the money in Barclays, Mercedes car keys
With all that, I'd still feel like half of me
Cause you're my other half
And you'll never be whole without me, do the math
Our relationship was real and it weren't a laugh
Or a walk in the park or a date in the caff
But don't hate me and try and get me set up
You can't set me up, I've always got bare man with me
So you can link Tom, Dick and Harry
Tom's a mug, Harry's a prick and Dick's self-explanatory
The relationship was based on other people
So I'm not surprised you had your eye on my friend
But you're too good for him, me and you were equal
I wish I could rewind

[Hook: Julie Adenuga]
Jamie, don't you know
I'm not gonna answer my phone
Don't call me at home
It's over
It's over
It's over
It's over, Jamie
It's over

[Outro: Jme]
It's over
Yeah, I don't even care
I care, yeah, but I don't even care, man
You get me?
I'll just go and write a lyric, you get me?
I don't even care, man
