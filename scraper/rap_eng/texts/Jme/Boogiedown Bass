(Boogiedown bass)

[Verse 1]
My lyrics are fresh like Wrigley's
Believe it or not like Ripley's
Boys on road still wanna chiv me
I don't care though, dance with me
We're dancing, see
And I make this music simply
People get vexed cause they're too complex
Put their track on the decks and
No-no-no people stay seated
Main objective is defeated
You played in the same club we did
When we played, they stampeded
Objective completed
Cause we get the dance all heated
I've done four mixtapes, look me in the face
And tell me that I have cheated

[Verse 2]
Yo, after my performance
Everybody comes round in a swarm and
They're all patting me down like they're doormen
Congratulating and applauding
Bare questions like I'm an informant
And I'm trying not to come across boring
They are all up in the mix cause they think that I'm rich
And MC for the P but -
Nope-nope-nope's for the love of the music
These ain't diamonds, they're cubics
I love the music biz to bits
And I figured it out like my Rubik's
Trust me, it's simple to do this
On your album, you need two hits
They're marketing tools for artists to use
And that's the way you will sell units

[Verse 3]
I'm Jme, mic controller
I no longer walk with a folder
I graduated, I got my education
And I'm prepared for my life when I'm older
Can you smell that odour?
That's the stinking lyrics that I'll show ya
I don't care if you've got a revolver
Have I got a strap?
Nope-nope-nope, trust me, I'm not a gun holder
I just roll with the big boy soldier
If you've got a little beef so you've got a little heat
You need to get that dirt off your shoulder
Cause it gets colder
Living the life of a clip loader
Trust me, bruv, don't let your life
