[Skit: JME]
Sometimes I think
If I wasn't me
I'll either be my best friend or i'll be just my enemy
I think Jme is just a donut bruv
Had enough of this guy
Like allow it bruv
Like whatever bruv
He's either taking things too seriously or he doesn't take me serious enough
He's just an idiot bruv
Like i'd rather just have a life without him
Or i'd be on him like "YES, JME IS THE RIGHT GUY, HE'S THE RIGHT GUY"
So that people not on me, I think why do people even care about him?
