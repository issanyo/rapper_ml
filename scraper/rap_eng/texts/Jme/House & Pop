[Intro: President T]
Large President T, greatest to ever touch down, Splurgeboys on the buttons
Real veterans will do real veteran things
Not clowning around, yo

[Verse 1: President T]
Yo, I know man that are madder, but it ain't Max
"Prez, heard that you're carrying bundles but it ain't Stacks"
Went to a car wash, I was like
Twice the amount of wax
They better know, I do grime
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop
Come to your local, come to your shop
Come to your place of worship
Come to your meeting
No, I ain't talking central when I say heating
Carry on talking, carry on tweeting
So credential, can't wait for the greeting
Nah, I ain't gonna wait
None of these guys could get to my weight

[Pre-Hook: President T]
None of these guys could get to my weight
Don't make me laugh
None of these guys could get to my weight
Carry on talking, carry on tweeting
None of these guys could get to my weight

[Hook: President T]
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop
Come to your house and pop, pop
Come to your house and pop
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop
Come to your house and pop, pop
Come to your house and pop
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop

[Break: President T]
OK, yeah
Large

[Verse 2: Jme]
President T and Jme
Last time you heard that
Man would've come to your drum and rapped
Show you the meaning of brap
Hiding shit behind the car panel
Fuck a shower, use two flannel
And if I got shift
No comment, just like my YouTube channel
Yo, man would've come to your house and popped
Yo, man would've come to your dance and rocked
Yo, man would've hit you in the hip, then hopped
Yo, man would've took your soul with the metal
On a council estate
Rolling with a nank on skates
Not one of these guys would've lasted a day
None of these guys would've come to the gates
Some of these guys need a slap in the face

[Pre-Hook: President T & Jme]
None of these guys could get to my weight (No)
Don't make me laugh (What?)
None of these guys could get to my weight
Carry on talking, carry on tweeting
None of these guys could get to my weight

[Hook: President T]
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop
Come to your house and pop, pop
Come to your house and pop
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop
Come to your house and pop, pop
Come to your house and pop
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop

[Verse 3: President T]
In this game
All I ever see is snakes and bitches
None of these guys could get to my riches
When I say greatest, you better know
The whole bar enriches
Food on scales, tell any tales
Might get stitches
Wow, is this music grime?
I was like, one of a kind
I mean, one of a sound
I know man that'll kill for the team
But they ain't been to the crowd
I said but they ain't been to the platform I'm tryna reach
Come to your house and train
Come to your house and teach
Come with vibes
But I ain't licking no bleach
T on the circuit, screech

[Pre-Hook: President T]
None of these guys could get to my weight
Don't make me laugh
None of these guys could get to my weight
Carry on talking, carry on tweeting
None of these guys could get to my weight

[Hook: President T]
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop
Come to your house and pop, pop
Come to your house and pop
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop
Come to your house and pop, pop
Come to your house and pop
Not really down with the house and pop
I know man that'll come to your house and pop
