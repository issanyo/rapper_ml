[Intro: Wiley]
Yeah, Eskiboy
Right now this is Tunnel Vision
Tunnel Vision (Tunnel Vision)
Do you know what tunnel vision means, blud?
Imagine all this stuff going on around you, like
Bare hype, bare bullshit
Bare drama
But this guy's still focused, like (Still focused)
This guy can still see straight forward (Straight forward)
That's tunnel vision, blud
Tunnel Vision Volume 1
Shut your whole mouth
Yo

[Verse 1: Wiley]
I represent Roll Deep and Boy Better Know
And, Boy Better Know I've got the Boy Better dro
Listen up, you know the boy's got a better flow
Than the average boy from the Boy Better roads
Come to a Boy Better Know show
And I'll show you the power of Boy Better Know
Please don't think I don't do it for the fam
Janaya, Aiesha and Joy Better Know
On the roads, if it's beef and it gets on top then
Jason, Roy and McCoy Better Know
I run up on the stage like Boy Better Know
Crowd of people make noise when I flow
Throw me this mic show, I'm like "oi, get a show"
I'll spray you up onstage, Boy Better Know
Rah, this is the Roll Deep show
If you didn't know original badman flow

[Verse 2: Skepta]
That's why I rep Boy Better Know, there's no better boys
You don't wanna see Jme get annoyed
When he starts shouting "Boy Better Know"
It's not a laugh and joke
So if you wanna play a game, Boy Better go and get a toy
I said Boy Better Know, man should've knew
I never said it by mistake
My T-shirts make more money than your mixtapes
So I tell a boy Boy Better Know it's money-making season
Book a flight to New York for no reason
Niggas wanna buy our CDs? Then I'm selling it
Go to the radio, give out the phone line number
Niggas in Flatbush are belling it
The grime sound, I'm spreading it
I know I've got a big head in it
So you better mind I don't come to your show and Hot 97 it
