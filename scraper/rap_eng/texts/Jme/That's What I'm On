[Verse 1: Lay-Z]
Whoever said money don't change you
Tell them from me that my swagger's all switched up
Chains all tucked in, jeans all ripped up
My horsepower goes mad when I shift up
Brain nigga, round gal I get kissed up
Fresh kanerows make the skirts wanna lift up
Hit them from the back, till she switch and sits up
That's a new meaning of 'it's all gone tits up'
Tell a big man, boy fix up
Don't wanna get kicked down cause you slipped up
No Mocassiono but I've still got my chips up
If I touch bracket we can never get mixed up (Yeah)
This shit's fucked
Niggas stole my swag, now they all wanna switch up
Don't ever slip so I've never been tripped up
Hand us a label, could I get picked up

[Hook: Lay-Z]
Cause that's what I'm on
Duppying tunes, that's what I'm on
Major moves, that's what I'm on
Do as I choose cause that's what I'm on
I said that's what I'm on
Win never lose, that's what I'm on
Wanna be a badboy, that's all long
Now your headtop's gone, that's what I'm on

[Verse 2: Jme]
You know what I'm on, init
My afro's out, Don King it
Blatant, any song, kill it
Your new mixtape, long, bin it
Family and friends, music and food
If you're not on that, come out of here rudeboy
About clash me, you'll lose
You're moving boogs like tracksuit and shoes
I'm on, your TV, I'm on
Making P's, so if you wanna rave with me
I'm on stage at 3
I'm on Earth Agency for the fee
I'm on YouTube still, I'm on
Tunes with Will, so if you want a verse
Chill, I'm on, keeping it real
'Til the beat gets killed, that's what I'm on

[Hook: Lay-Z]
Cause that's what I'm on
Duppying tunes, that's what I'm on
Major moves, that's what I'm on
Do as I choose cause that's what I'm on
I said that's what I'm on
Win never lose, that's what I'm on
Wanna be a badboy, that's all long
Now your headtop's gone, that's what I'm on

[Verse 3: Frisco]
(Sky) That's what I'm on yo
Come through, get all the girls like Bonzo
They can't believe man-a-man's still shelling
Got the game in my hand like a PS4 control
So what do you want though? You wanna battle
With the lyrical skeng when you know it's all long yo?
I'm like Lonyo, I get summer love
But I've gotta walk with the metal when the summer's done
Oh, S-K double Y dem
Thieves ain't ready for the don, come try them
Got a new ting that will sky man so high
When they come down nobody can find them
More the merrier, I get heavier
Bury ya, fling them in the pan then fry them
Them man are moist, somebody dry them
Maggie with a big bag of ashes, that's what I'm on

[Hook: Lay-Z] x2
Cause that's what I'm on
Duppying tunes, that's what I'm on
Major moves, that's what I'm on
Do as I choose cause that's what I'm on
I said that's what I'm on
Win never lose, that's what I'm on
Wanna be a badboy, that's all long
Now your headtop's gone, that's what I'm on
