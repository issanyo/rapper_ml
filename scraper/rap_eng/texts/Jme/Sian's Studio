This flow's so sick it will uppercut Kimbo Slice, Jackie Chan and Jet Li
You people are gonna respect me, I bet I'll make you respect me
This flow's deadly, it will resurrect Bruce Lee to be the famous Deadly
The only day that I don't put in no work is the 30th of February
Do not .. with my money, it can be ten bags or 10p
I used to live off my overdraft but now the account is never empty
All the supporters rep me and half of them ain't even met me

[Verse 5: Grim Sickers]
Yeah, [?]
Run up on man, yeah two year ban
Tag team [?], that's Sickers and Jack
Come to the rave with a bat on my waist

Black bin bag, I ain't got a safe
And we split bread, you already know
Yeah we spitted Kane, ended the rave
Hey, you best hope and prey
Permanent body-bag, put 'em in a grave
Yeah, stop with the fronting

You'll get tucked in for thinking you're above Grim
I'll get the pillowcase, I'll smother him
Tell him to tell him that I run tings
'Cause I'm [?]
You'll get floored face first like Hatton
You'll get cut like cars in the slow lane
The flow petrol, fire and propane
I ain't here to play no games
I went for a top boy from a no name
Swinging MC's with my sword and silver
Man talk crud, get caught in the field
Thinks that I won't but I know that I will
All this buzz and no album deal

Mixed with 2D Duke Nukem

[Verse 6: Jme]
I was like "Brap"
Had a Nokia 3110 and it had WAP
No colour screen
Didn't rate the mandem on TV
I used to think 'I wonder what Bushkin and Mighty look like?'
I was in the rain, upside down pushbike
Fixing my chain
I was too young to roll to the raves
