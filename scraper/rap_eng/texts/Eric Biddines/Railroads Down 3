[Verse 1: Eric Biddines]
Over the hills to the harbor
(Here we come)
Hope to find clean water
(Well to drink from)
Momma yo cheurrn, you'll be proud of
(Daughters and sons)
(All that we have, is all that we want)
Master said he gonna free us
(No he won't)
Master said he gonna free us
(Hell to the naw)
Yes we ain't all that equal
No we not yeah!
(All that we have, is all that we want)

[Bridge]
I'm tired of eating the same stank chitlins
And I'm tired of singing the same old song
I'm tired of the corns on my toes
And the back of my heels feeling like leather
Darkness falls on the shoulders (shoulders)
Of whoever's leading
But ain't way we can ever get paid
From where we crawl from

[Verse 2: Kendra Williams (Eric Biddines)]
Oh I hear my people say (railroads)
Dying for no reason
Like it's open season (railroads)
Say we fight and steal
Broad daylight we're killed (railroads)
People dying with no answer
Spreading worse than cancer (railroads)
But there's power in numbers
We'll come rolling through like thunder

[Outro]
Cause we all got a few kids that
Depend on our ways
Might seem a little crazy to think that my skin
Is no different than your skin
