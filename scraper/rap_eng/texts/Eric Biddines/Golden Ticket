Forgot to set the alarm to eight oâ€™clock
Twenty minutes past hour got me looking at my watch
No time for coffee, I can barely wash my face
Get the boogers out my eyes, almost didn't say my grace
Same shoes that I took off, I put on
Mud still on em, tied tight, nothing here wrong
We don't usually complain about the norm
Out the box, where I be at, forget why I was born
A long walk, a long stride
On the side of the road on my sidewalk vibe

Just bought a ticket to a conversation
I just bought a ticket to a conversation
Just bought a ticket to a conversation
I just bought a ticket, public transportation

Rain drizzle from the heavy clouds falling
Magazine stand cover page, people ballin
No umbrellas never really needed shade
I just take it how it is, never could predict a day
Main thing is to focus on me
I see a lot of fine broads never considering
They'll take you off track, have your mind wandering
If the place you settle at where you really should be
Give me directions if you know of a guide
If you coming to the table empty handed realize
That you don't get no knowledge out here begging
You don't get no balance meal if you don't eat your veggies
Like a burger ain't that good without the lettuce
Tomato make it better, then some ketchup, even dressing

Transportation provided for all the public
Hate the system how it's set up, but it's needed so I love it
A metaphor to bring the people together
Similar to how the man need the womb of a women
When the tire get to turning, motion moving the coming
Of another day we lived just in case you was wondering
I got the hold never looking for fumbling
Of a word I describe from inspirable drumming
I hope you take this in consideration
I look at you and I see the entire generation

Just bought a ticket to a conversation
It took a while complicated but I finally got the destination
Was a place where everybody's faded
Needed wise type of words I delivered patience
With no intent without no obligation
No gratitude never wanted for some compensation
I pay attention if you pay me some mind
Only value in this world is the time saving
Or the moment you remember when you lived
Such an overrated present to go out and buy a gift
I made a vow to keep intentions good
This the stop that I get off another neighborhood
A new community that need a voice
A choice you choose wise like I know you would
