I hope the rain don't fog my window
Took a long way home
I was wondering if the place I'm heading to have a benefit
Started thundering, wasn't supposed to rain
I watched the news this morning, said a sunny day
The weather changed, the clouds came, the sun disappeared into yesterday

I hope the rain don't fog my window

Saw a pretty face, she cried to me
Ask me if a secret something I could keep
I told her yes, yes indeed
A stranger to my soul I have never seen
I talked to her, she ain't have a name
A lonely little girl, where's her family?

I hope the rain don't fog my window
Cuz I won't see before me
Things don't seem as simple
When you’re feeling lonely
The road you travel closed down
Fingers crossed, you’re hoping
Hoping rain would slow down
But if nobody notice...

I hope the rain don't fog my window
