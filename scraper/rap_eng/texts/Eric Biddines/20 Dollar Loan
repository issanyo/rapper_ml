[Verse]
Hand full of dreams, pocket full of hope
Wallet got enough of space to fit whatever what you want
Still fishing for that open moment
Saving whatever I don't already have I'm eating donuts, and drinking coffee
Spending money in my mind for the things ain't even bought yet, we living like we fine
Me and T-green be driving through them neighborhoods
With double front  doors, and balconies, jacuzzi, tubs
Houses like the one the taxi dropped off Will
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air where we from ain't no uncle Phil Background full of alcoholic kinfolk, Shadetree mechanic, GED's, either job corp
The story of the average nigga out the hood
Try to get it how I live don't get stuck like tires in mud
I ain't expecting for nobody here to help me, this ain't a cry for help I'm just venting, excuse my expression
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Don't want the next generation after my family struggle tired Stuck working a job with sorry ass 30-min breaks
'Bout time you warm up your food, you already late

[Hook]
You can't afford to pay attention even nowadays
Need twenty dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Need twenty dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Need twenty dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Hopeless like a penny with a hole I'll say
Need 20 dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Need 20 dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Need 20 dollars that I can borrow till Friday

[Drew Tucker: Solo Vibraphone]

Need twenty dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Need twenty dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Need twenty dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Hopeless like a penny with a hole I'll say
Need 20 dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Need 20 dollars that I can borrow till Friday
Need 20 dollars that I can borrow till Friday
