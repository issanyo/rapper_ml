[Verse 1]
Being pigeon held
Back against the wall, claustrophobic, damn it's hot as Hell
Sweatin' like a slave in a field full of cotton
At the drive thru Taco Bell
From where I'm sittin', you can view the world
You get fucked or you can fuck a girl
You can choose to be a leader or a follower
Respect to all the fathers cause to me it's more than diamond pearls
I mean no judgin', I'm just talkin' from a place of honest
See I'ma star but I'm no different from that fallin' comet
I write these bars hope the universe will listen
See I had to swallow pride even if it made a nigga vomit
Appear to me you want somebody that'll lie to you
But not somebody that'll die for you
Appear to me you want somebody that'll lie to you
But not somebody that'll die for you
Same dude from out the south of Florida
Same street you bought a cigaret that cost a quarter
Haitian lady gave me a couple bag of chips I got a soda
It was free my hunger showed over thirst of water
In desperate times you gone have to decide
To kill yourself so you can make a livin'
If I'm inspired ain't no power alive
To stop my vision, that's just my opinion
And you can quote me you can bring up bout my past
Yu gone notice that I'm well driven
Check my record I got pictures of my shoes I was poor forever
Never ever begged not for nan penny
Momma said it was important that we ate at school
We got off the bus at home it may not be no food
Our refrigerator had more space then our living room
I thought that all kids ain't have a daddy I assumed
Cornered in, fighting suffocation
Sick of being sick and tired I ain't even patient
Racing elevate my stride gotta learn to pace it
And do it all just to dream I can add bacon

[Hook] x2
I'm looking out The Window (I'm looking out the window)
I'm looking out the Window
Ain't no place that you can go so you sitting there at home

[Verse 2]
Sleep on the same flow you spit on
People hate you ain't put them on
Got it twisted thought somebody owed me something like being good was enough
And they was posed to play demo
Looked out the window
If I could blow like cartridges a Nintendo
Would you let me be your hero?
I promise always do it for the fans never for advance
They was nappin so I woke em off they pillow
I never fear no
And I never took a night off
And I still got yo shout out. Some a wright off
Don't extend your hand to all folks
Take your kindness and they will bite yo shit right off

[Hook] x2
