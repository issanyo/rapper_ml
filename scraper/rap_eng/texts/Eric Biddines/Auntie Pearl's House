[Verse 1]
Working the fields the whole yard
Out in the sun it's so hot
Singing a tune to move on
Dat’s how it is, it is lord

Everybody wanna be buddy from the hood with a Chevrolet grill
But nobody wanna do thangs dude did just to get where he is
Raised on a old dirt road front yard with railroad tracks
Snotty nose kid, booger nose drinking outta water hose like that

[Hook]
Sho’nuff, oh why?
There's a lotta wrong things in my life
Turn up turn down
Yesterday is yesterday and no doubt
Hey hey hey...


[Verse 2]
Only had one TV bunk bed with a broke box spring
Shared a bathroom, toilet tissue got wet let it dry on the sink
Bought a loaf bread, mildew on the end we ain't even much complain
Got a couple pots on the living room floor momma said it might rain
You ain't think it no joke
Collard green, stems split peas for the pork
Soaking in the kitchen on the table with the wood cutting board
Playing Al Green from the radio
Daddy had dreams but he never did know
How to provide for a whole household
2 or 3 dogs and cat and small junk yard, fed them for he even fed his own

[Repeat Hook]

Working the fields the whole yard
Out in the sun it's so hot
Singing a tune to move on
Dat’s how it is it is lord
