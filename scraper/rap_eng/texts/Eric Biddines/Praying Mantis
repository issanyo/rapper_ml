[Intro]
Microphone check 1-2-3
Eric Biddines on a beat made by Danny D
If you feeling how the vibe is now
Listen close with your ears they'll become you eyes
Listen close with your ears they'll become your eyes

[Verse 1]

Back with another one story of a mother who
Single parent raising babies in a single room
Have no idea how she gone make it barely pushing through
She hardly make enough to pay the rent and it's reduced
Sister you don't know the challenge when you're worth it
The devil put you under surveillance for a purpose
But you gone flourish I can feel it
That carpet that you cry upon one to lift your spirit

[Hook]

And these bills don't never stop accumulating
And it's a gamble when you filling out applications
The third time this week you don't really want to eat the ramen noodles you making
The only thing you can really do is pray
The only thing you can really do is pray
Yeah

[Verse 2]

Bow your head
We taking chances
Whenever we take glances
Out the window pain but we ain't praying like the mantis
We step on ants and spray the cockroaches
Not their fault where they look for food
The place we call our home it's
Hard being good when you accepted
The shit that come out our mouths we cover Chloraseptic
For when I shout out I hope the lord protect me
Carry that umbrella when it's raining kinda hectic
I once was him who used to travel with no gas
Ignore the blinking light I said I get there if I had
I know it's hope for each and every person lately
I been feeling like it's more to life than just complaining
Forgot bout praying
Forgot bout love
Forgot what I was supposed to write about on this here song

[Hook]

And these bills don't never stop accumulating
And it's a gamble when you filling out applications
The third time this week you don't really want to eat the ramen noodles you making
The only thing you can really do is pray
The only thing you can really do is pray

[Acapella Verse]

Back with another one student try to finish school
Said he don't qualify to get the help he needed so
He work a 9-5 and overtime for minimum
No benefits he don't complain that's what he gotta do
One day he get a check up saying he got cancer
Around the time his doctor say insurance cancelled
There goes his savings now he coming out of pocket
No way to pay tuition now to go to college
