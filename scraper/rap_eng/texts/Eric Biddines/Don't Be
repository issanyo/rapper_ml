I'm standing on edge I'm bout to jump
You nervous looking at me you scared because I'm one
To not be stressin’ whatever said, afraid of gun
Is something that I never had cared for feeling numb
Scurry over properties, this no monopoly
The money in our lives be real you microscopin’
We observe from the distance, be my philosophy
I'm drinking coffee from the pot cold you probably think
That these people with goals afraid to loose
I do it for the love, but love don't pay no dues
Love don’t keep the water and the heat on
I'm boiling ramen noodles with a lighter
So how your day goin’?
You in the lobby eating pork
I visit NY for a week can't get a taxi in New York
I must’ve fit the profile of being broke
True indeed I was down to a dime but my approach
Is different when you living for a purpose
And you know it so you take the longer route
But you know the place you going

I seen a hooker with a stroller on her way to work
A man on crutches thinking how to get his legs to work
A women lusting till a dealer come and snatch her purse
A little boy from South Florida, he hungry stomach hurt
This ain't a rapper wit’ lies I’m writing lines
Suicide from the pen to the pad straight from the mind

[Hook]
You must be pumping something through my veins
I felt you, heard you, but nothing has changed
I don't trip, I don't bleed, I don't want, I don't need
Quite alright yes indeed
If you want to succeed don’t be a bitch

Don't be a fish in the pond that's what they told me
You should be rapping ‘bout hoes that's what they sold me
Go get some jewellery and gold not just some gold teeth
Like it’s a secretive code you could’ve showed me
Lights hit you from the roof of the venue
The bartender serving coffee not your typical menu
What you see me frequent in got some knowledge to lend you
Before you change episodes, this is to be continued
To be continued, to be continued, to be continued

People change when the money right
People change when the money wrong
People change like they borrow clothes
If we listen to whatever hit our eardrums
You might as well kiss your future gone, right or wrong
Young dude with a soul like he a thousand years old
Like mould steady smiling
Figure nothing this cold come to an island
When the water that's around you is the only thing surrounding
Real country with fake rules to benefit
Fake people with with real stress of paying rent
Nightmares we dream of Lamborghinis with
Suicide the doors that make your spirit lift

I seen a hooker with a stroller on her way to work
A man on crutches thinking how to get his legs to work
This ain't a rapper with lies I'm writing lines
Suicide from the pen to the pad straight from the mind

[Hook]
