[Hook]
Coffee in my cup, I hope you understand
It's more like therapy, whenever in my hand
It gets no better than this cup I have of coffee
It gets no better than this cup I have of coffee

[Verse 1]
If I don't wake up in the morning to coffee
I must not have waken up at all, I'm dead in a coffin
Or probably somewhere lost in, trapped in what you call a
Place that every coffee drinker hate to be we all a
Victim of being guilty to being addicted
It's the aroma we long for, provided we lifted
I love the feeling like the moon above the beach
The smell of wet rain on the afternoon concrete
Early dew on freshly cut grass
Drink it slow I take my first sip of the brew like it's my last
Coffee so good you have to look back at the cup
Reminds me why I love this feeling right here so much
You lolly gagging when you lucky to be living
People stressing everyday, lost family that's no longer with 'em
I talk about this coffee but it's way more deeper
It's an expression that we digging for relax a bit
Get up and pour some

[Verse 2]
You could be riding on the bus or subway
With you iPod in your ear lobes, that coffee you might take
Driving to your job and  hope your boss took a vacation
Waiting for you train to come, rely on public transportation
Just seen a text sent from your ex that you was missing
Checking on you like you got over the arguments and tension
Some times you really want to be alone
Gone  come a moment in your life you're looking for this song
Saying that Eric was striking a chord inside my soul
Ain't even know that it existed must be something that he know
Well I don't know everything, but I know life
Is random, and making sure that you stir your coffee right
I'm gifted in a sense to know that happiness is gold
Everybody is unique, we was made a custom mould
I believe in good karma
Locate the place that ease your mind and block the stressfulness with armor

[Hook] (x2)

[Break]
You don't even know what's on my mind
But you don't need a watch to know it's time
I'm tryna fast forward or press rewind
The present is a gift, I realized
So I'm
Drinking (x7)
And I'm
Drinking (x7)
And I'm
Drinking (x7)
My coffee

[Hook] (x2)
