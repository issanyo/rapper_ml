Verse:1

I wasn't always this cool happen to grow into it
The type of flyness only parakeets and eagles do it
Landed on something rugged, turned into smooth sails. Floating like styrofoam I'm lighter than some Nike airs
It's seems as if I'm gliding, surrounded oxygen
These jits around me look up to me saying I'm the man
I don't describe or like to define what style is. It ain't about prices or popular denim I wear

Hook:
Long live. The average Dude
Cool type of fella I'm the shit like a bathroom
Flying down the avenue. Blvd pimpin on the strip in a 3 peace suit. So cold

Verse:2

A podium with reservation written for my squadron

Good job at my service I'm no better than you humans. We get caught up in the image of celebrity computers
Trick us with them YouTube views and random tweeting. Defeating the whole purpose of the image we creating

I'm roller skating on words drifting on sound shaking hands kissing babies and dapping who ever round
Humble like a don't have a name I'm taking vowels for I-O-U all attention if I don't them I'm without
That presence that I dream of. You never seen a, player taking time out for all of his believers
Old school like regale and chevys and chrome vogues tinted windows with the AC on chill picking my nose cuz it's
