Thankful I don't need to kill nobody for some noodles
Or deposit on the lights, the gas bill is gon’ be due soon
Waiting for my fight the battlefield is just a canoe
Paddle up that river where the current flow against you
Popular to what you think about me, I'm just Eric
The version that you thought I'd be was no more than generic
Skies colors of red and autumn browns
Looking like the heavens are bleeding I'm hoping now
The time for us to nourish our souls and feed our minds
No moment more appropriate than what I see designed
Crown made for a king to lead a kingdom
Thrown over thrown by someone who didn't need him
They say that sword you hold was made somewhere in England
From the parts without no habitat the dragons would be breathing
Journey to the forest on a saddle for no reason
You just looking for some proof that many doubt to make believers

Come to terms with what I knew I wouldn't want to
Running from the kitchen where they cooking what would hunt you
Page missing out the book that sit in front you
Probably proof that someday we gon’ find out what we once knew
Was a just a lie and documented was a stage
Cover what you want to protect us from what you made
Double all the pressure, we some of the dumbest slaves
We don't even know the meaning of breathing, we just behave
Like ignorant professor without no student
Teaching science to a empty room of chairs, translucent
Mirrors on the walls show reflections of a fluent
Speaking gentlemen don't understand he sound stupid
He got all the answers
And he seen everything
He say he from another planet come to learn our ways
Didn't believe him said he crazy he was off a frame
We quick to overlook the different but we ask for change
