[Verse 1]
Address the question at hand
Is it a reason you ain't call me back?
I come across a whole lot of pretty girls all the time, but you the one I need in fact
I want to be your man
I want to make you smile
If you got a couple spare lunch breaks, you ain't busy at all
I just need a little bit of your time

[Pre-Hook]
(If you could wait, awhile)
I'ma make sure you believe most of it all
And light your day like a Florida sunrise
(And I can't take, no now)
I been patient like I'm in a waiting room or something
And O-U gone make me buy another vowel

[Hook]
I don't know why I can't
I can't get over you
Why you don't understand
That I only stand for you
I sure don't want to waste time
But the hour glass about thru (bout thru)
I must admit I'm in a rush to spend forever with you

[Verse 2]
Either way it's put it waiting
Waiting for the right time, lady
For you to come and be my baby
I must admit that I'm a bit frustrated
Cause girl I got my feelings involved
And accidentally done let you in
My heart used to have a wall built around
(Round, round, round, round)

[Pre-Hook]
(If you could wait, awhile)
I'ma make sure you believe most of it all
And light your day like a Florida sunrise
(And I can't take, no now)
I been patient like I'm in a waiting room or something
And O-U gone make me buy another vowel

[Hook]
I don't know why I can't
I can't get over you
Why you don't understand
That I only stand for you
I sure don't want to waste time
But the hour glass about thru (bout thru)
I must admit I'm in a rush to spend forever with you

[Verse 3]
I figure from the moment that's it's 'bout time
For me to make a move and get you on the right side
My throat sore because I'm used to always talking reckless
But then you came along and hit me with the Chloraseptic
I had a chick I used to date for bout a week and that experience I told myself that I would never meet
The women from my dreams, she only in my head
And when I go to sleep, the only time she in my bed
Fast forward couple months we get acquainted, thru a mutual friend that say that we should make some babies
We hit it off and I ain't even try to smash you, conversation was enough, hell I had to
Take my time because I figured if I wait
Let you go the pace you go then you would wanna be my mate But now you telling me you scared to make mistakes
You done been in this position, don't wanna run me away

[Hook]
I don't know why I can't
I can't get over you
Why you don't understand
That I only stand for you
I sure don't want to waste time
But the hour glass about thru (bout thru)
I must admit I'm in a rush to spend forever with you
