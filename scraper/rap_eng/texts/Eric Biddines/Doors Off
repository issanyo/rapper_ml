[Verse 1]

Back in this bitch like I missed the whole winter and showed up to late
Chip on my shoulder like somebody forgot to fix me a plate
Story unfold history shows that all can't be great
But the way that my bank account set up. My phone and my internet my not get paid
Money on hold
All of my profit ain't came. Feel like it's taking too long and I'm spending mo money then I ever made
I still feel on the real here we don't live still
I done told y'all all about change we can make bills
Wore the same shirt for the 10th time reminisced I
Not a thing hurt cuz without shit you don't  miss out
Seen a whole lot saw a man shot women pimped out
From a swap shop to a outlet to the hood spot
Taken all names. Further I go with this rappin the closer I get to the top of the ranks. Never no acting bumpy like acne drumming and droppin the bass
Who is it askin probably fascinating they all wanna hate. I'm kicking the doors off

[Hook]
I'm kicking the doors off  (x2)
I'm bringing my folks in I'm, im kicking the doors off. (Repeat twice)

[Verse 2]
I'm kicking the door off. I'm bringing my folks in. We knocking the bolts off. We coming from both ends
We don't  have shit we on got shit, want everything. Stomach on E. Pocket got lint. And my gas tank. Need a hundo, got a bill due and the rent late. Momma feet hurt, cuzzin Torri wanna shirt made
I still feel on the real here we don't live still
I done told y'all all about change we can make bills
This my real name Eric B- I. Double D I n-E-S yes from the first day I be dat guy
People don't that know that we come from the bottom were money don't ever come visit. And  the size of your wallet no bigger you got it for fashion you pinching 4 pennies
You look at me strange. I walk on this concrete Wit the mind frame of a giant untamed. No shackles or chains
Juggernaut running threw walls coming down quicker than Niagrah falls. .Leaving whatever may stop us from reaching  the level to conquer it all

[Hook]
