[Verse 1]
I hope one day that I can touch the sun
And even though that might not be as fun
A simple melody to move the waves
If a seashell wash a shore then that's the day

[Chorus]
I've been searching high and low, and high and low I search
And everywhere I go
Can't seem to leave the hurt
There's a message in the boat
In a bottle waiting to, ship out to sea

[Verse 2]
The bottle that I sent may not return
But that's okay because I feel like I earned
(Like I earned a prize indeed)
Treat myself before anyone could read
Just to let go was enough and all I need

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tug boat paddling against the current
A couple footprints in the sand thinking dernit
Was I left her at a critical moment
At a time I thought I needed more than one could of wanted
Listen to your heart and you don't gotta ask why
Looking through a window like I got a glass eye
From the moment you doubted when everybody who hated
Begin to figure that you never understood why
People sell their dreams and leave docks
Got time to need a third watch
What's a goal he said without a chain
He was thinking of jewelry and me change
Follow what you desire to maintain
Wen the water hit the fire to light up the whole day
Pull the lever to alarm the ship in the third bay
Same ocean that the Santa Maria had sailed away

[Chorus]
