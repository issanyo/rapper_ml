[Verse 1]
When sun down follow the drinking gourd
Let the moonlight take you away
The riverside said'll take you north
Pack no bags you on need no weight
Said the masters on my sole
The shackles on my feet
The blood still in my clothes
But all I see is free
Don't lie me die for no reason
Don't let them take me away
I prey to lord Jesus
I'm bout to loose my faith
That's why the shackles on my feet
And the blood still in my clothes
But all I see is free
Hope the hound dog ain't that close
Try to make it to freedom
I know we will one day
Don't make me out a believer
I'm bout loose my faith

[Hook x2]
I said the rail roads down
It's under

[Verse 2]
I live on the field with the porch the tree with the branches that come with a that rope
My daddy was brought on a boat. Said a nigga had sold em to keep him afloat
Ain't know bout the title of slaves. Born into what we know now as thought
Mommy said one of these days our luck will run up and these shackles be broke
Uncle said must not be no god. If it was this won't happen
Toby said keepin all faith hard but we gotta keep at it
Prayed and we prayed and we pay hard. Til the moment it happen
One of these days we gone come far
I just know with a passion

Finally free x 4

If you asked me where I'd be today I would prolly say Ida never made it out

Possibility went away never came not a thing till the day I

[Verse 1]

Started doing left the doubt in me I had evaporated just like fluid
Said if change was posed to come like early Morning with the rooster on the get up y'all forgive me I was stupid
Ain't know that loosing was loosing your hope and faith. You only die if you give up the day before they make your grave
Too many ppl depending my lead of way, the load you carry when you barely show weakness in others face
You shoulda been there when my life was on the fence, never went to jail but still I always stayed stayed in the pen
Writing history on compositions. This developed from a camera im living inside the prints
Came from a Long dirt roads the crop of farm with no agriculture barely can grow us a stock of corn
Shoulder looking over every lil vulture the term born
What you think I'm posed to Barry my ppl without no funeral
I told my daddy I'm double if it was two of you
I seen London I'm booking a flight to Liverpool
You Caint stay local forever. You need a team but as a individual you gotta never say never
Almost cried the first time I wore genuine leather
It was Cold but see me the type to Preciate weather
Just saying you coulda been somebody ain't wake up. Happiness is free but material sh it'll break us
