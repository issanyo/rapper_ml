[Verse 1]
Walk around my way. You would see no weight
I done been there seen things felt like coulda got way more say
If a moonlight dim in the dark blue sky would a folk have faith?
If a man stand still right against his will did he fail to make?
Many times had the opportunity we be the first one wondering
For the path I made had a shorter glance I gotta real life thang for the older stance
Fear war like a soldier dance in the field bullet fly low key to prance
Over ceilings rooftops a cars
Flow trapped  I'm between the bars
You the one your the gleaming stars
Said we when I meant to feel
Felt fake when I said the real
Got Lost looking back at years
Years never went by safe
Purple goldfish in the back of my mind
Head straight for the lake

[Chorus]
Have you heard about the water
Has anybody ever seen it
I be waiting till the moon come
Purple Goldfish Dreaming
I be ready for war
Purple Gold Fishes
I be ready for war
Purple gold

[Verse 2]
See, what a mother fucker failed to realize that, I done been across that lake
A nigga told me that the purple gold fish didn't exist and that it was fake
Now for the sake of me not just saying some shit, I hope y'all understand my take
Oh you believe cause that what is not in front of your view or vision
Can't be real because you seen everything huh? Trippin
The purple gold fish poses the power and is only given to who that ingulf the essence of fight
The battle within self against others
The alternative gesture to strike
But you too afraid to think I'm right

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Purple gold fish little fishy swim free
Rise above lake so the power I see
Moonshine mill in the woods hid deep
Fighting for the right found war in me
I'm looking for the purple gold fishes
I'm looking for the purple gold fishes I

[Chorus]
