(Oh, oh, ohh)
(Oh, oh, ohh)
(Oh, oh, ohh)

(Oh, oh, ohh)
(Oh, oh, ohh)
(Oh, oh, ohh)

[Chorus: Winston Surfshirt]
Can you be mine?
I could be yours
You can see 'cos
I was always on my way to you
But you don't let me through, I
Can't to you until you do girl
I was always on my way to you...
Yeah I was always on my way to you

[Verse 1: Winston Surfshirt]
I like the way you go
But I hate the way you left me
Standing stupid, convoluted, but it suited me
Make yourself at home now
'Never be alone' is only temporary
If eventually you choose to be
So [?]

I was always on my way to you

[Chorus: Winston Surfshirt]
Can you be mine?
I could be yours
You can see 'cos
I was always on my way to you
But you don't let me through, I
Can't to you until you do girl
I was always on my way to you
Yeah I was always on my way to you

[Verse 2: Winston Surfshirt]
Try on a calmer day?
I ain't well gonna stay?
As soon as I walk out the door
I see myself alone
I was always on my way to you
But you were never home

Yeah I was always on my way to you

[Hook: Winston Surfshirt]
Guess I'm comin' home 'cos I won't let go
So what if I don't?
So would ya wanna..
So would ya wanna take a chance on your old baby?
Yeah I was always... (oh, oh, ohh)
Yeah I was always on my way to you

[Chorus: Winston Surfshirt & Eric Biddines]
Can you be mine?
I could be yours
You can see 'cos
I was always on my way to you
But you don't let me through, I
Can't to you until you do girl (oh)
I was always on my way to you (ok, alright)
Yeah I was always on my way to you

[Verse 3: Eric Biddines]
I was on the phone to my old flame
Hit me with a call sayin'
She feel we mighta grown strange
And my first thought like: "Damn shame"

How you think I'm supposed to feel when the mic here
Making me plays like rugby (rugby)
You want that I makin' these moves to keep lights on
Yeah past be ugly

What if I told you, rainy days we need
So sun can shine?
What if my heart beat stopped beatin'
And you left me alone outside?

[Hook: Winston Surfshirt & Eric Biddines]
So I'm comin' home 'cos I won't let go (Comin' home regardless)
So what if I don't? (What if I don't?)
So would ya wanna..
So would ya wanna take a chance (just take a chance) on your old baby?

Yeah I was always...
Yeah I was always on my way to you

[Chorus: Winston Surfshirt]
Can you be mine?
I could be yours
You can see 'cos
I was always on my way to you
But you don't let me through, I
Can't to you until you do girl
I was always on my way to you
Yeah I was always on my way to you

[Outro]
(Oh, oh, ohh)
(Oh, oh, ohh)
(Oh, oh, ohh)

(Oh, oh, ohh)
(Oh, oh, ohh)
