I'm gon’ take my shirt off
You gon’ take your skirt off
Play some Luther Vandross

Privacy been waiting on
Talked 'bout when we be alone
On silent where I need your phone
You don't have no option everybody gone
Right here is where I need you to be
Come closer girl I got you a seat
Won't bite unless that's what we agree
I'm liable to bring sand to the beach
This what you been waiting on
We been waitin’ way too long

[Hook]
I'm gon’ take my shirt off
You gon’ take your skirt off
Play some Luther Vandross
I'm gon’ take my shirt off
You gon’ take your skirt off
Play some Luther Vandross

Don't wanna pressure into a lot of things
You do what I let you ima fly the plane
Ears popping, how did we get high today
I'm coming down with you, I'm bound to hibernate
This what you been waiting on
We been waiting way too long
Get comfortable get comfortable
Tonight ain't wear my cheap cologne
Right here is where I need you to be
Come closer girl I got you a seat
Won't bite unless that's what we agree
I'm liable to bring sand to the beach

[Hook]

I can hear you breathe when you make that sound
I love the way you move girl, up and down

I want you like sunny weather when the whole day rained
When the wind blow and we come together like this was staged
Got a phone call, I hope no emergency yet was made
Cause you’re bound to drown depending on me, sorry that I'm caught up late
Have you seen the sun that rise on the east end of a morning shore?
You surprised that I said yes when you asked could you have some more?
Got angel wings and you fly like that girl you open doors
There's a lot of things I do wrong, but with you no I can't ignore

[Hook]
