[Verse 1]
Takin' all names
Anybody looking for me, tell them I'm straight
Used to want fame
Nowadays kinda care less, just saying
Sick of these walls
People talk 'bout what are elephant wangs
Shawty got jaws
I know she smart, I can tell because her brain
I ain't got time, I ain't even like your kind
I ain't even got no watch and the break I took come back like spine
Hater I'm fine
I know you hate but to me that's dead
Who the hell let you in this show?
You the only on here ain't bobbin' your head

[Hook]
Oh me, oh my
Oh no, what's up?
By the time you count to 3, I'ma disappear like (Peeuurrnn)
Oh me, oh my
Oh no, what's up?
By the time you count to 3, I'ma disappear like
Peeuurrnn

[Verse 2]
Look at your mouth
Goddamn would you look at your face
Can't even smile
My eyelids hurt, you ugly, I'm straight
Never had beef
If it was some hell I ain't even much know
Did your main chick like my pics?
Better fix your cuffs, we don't love these
Holes in the wall, got leaks in the roof by the bed
Delray, B-town, Lake Worth, Palm Beach
And the raw to the muck projects
Straight to the hood
Bottom of the map where the state got Zoe's
And I rep that F.L.A. like this, like that
Like peeuurrnn, gone!

[Hook]
Oh me, oh my
Oh no, what's up?
By the time you count to 3, I'ma disappear like (Peeuurrnn)
Oh me, oh my
Oh no, what's up?
By the time you count to 3, I'ma disappear like
Peeuurrnn

[Bridge]
Ain't a damn thing fast like peeurrnn
(Oh me, oh my)
When you wanna bih gone say peeuurrnn
(Oh me, oh my)
Got a check and it went like Peeuurrnn
(Oh me, oh my)
By the time you count to three I'mma dissapear then peeuurrnn (peeuurrnn)

[Verse 3]
Lil momma you fine, Lil momma you about my size
Gotta wife I don't wanna lie bout, ain't did nothing wrong just looking ain't a crime
Better be a sign, Better be a clue something
Still planetcoffeebean, still turkey bone chain
Still on my grind nothing changed
I must be high, contact from the second-hand smoke
You done killed my vibe
Don't ask for the money I owe, I'm broke
I ain't got no change
I don't wanna be a member to a club for a cheap discount
I already donate gave a dollar when I came
Don't ask me again when I come out

[Hook]
Oh me, oh my
Oh no, what's up?
By the time you count to 3, I'ma disappear like
Oh me, oh my
Oh no, what's up?
By the time you count to 3, I'ma disappear like
Peeuurrnn

[Spoken Word]
The planetcoffeebean always possessed power in which civilized people on earth would never understand
One magical creature being the mythical winged elephant was told to have special elements and knowledge that citizens alike cherished
Although being extinct for years, the winged elephant with its marble skin did not have the ability to flyâ€”so we are told
But stories of one of these mythical creatures flying across the frozen lake live on for years, and hold the metaphor for doing the impossible
Defying the laws of aerodynamics
And motivating a culture to achieve the unthinkable
