[Verse 1]
Everybody on the dance floor moving all around
Do the Down South Boogie
Shaking ass like a closed milk carton
Little momma on the side poppin’ coochie
We got another one yeah we got another one
Me and Paul White yeah we got another one
Move cool like a rattlesnake in alligator suite
‘bout to make a movie

[Hook]
I said I got a quick story to tell
Would you mind? Could you lend me a ear?
I ain't never seen a dude so cold
Till my reflection when I look right here
Parking lot full of old school cars said she wanna date my automobile
Told her she can have whatever she like
Give anything but my all gold grill

[Verse 2]
I was born had a dollar twenty-five to my name couldn't save not a penny
I drink a Dr. Pepper, me and Forrest Gump
Around the time he was still missing Jenny
We got another one yeah we got another one
Took her to the bathroom she was ready for
Move cool like a rattle snake in alligator suite’ bout to make a movie
They break dance on a old cardboard on the sidewalk spin on head
Spray paint on the street that's cool, got graffiti courtesy artist
She twerk hard like she got no spine, double jointed with the nice bow legs
And did a move I ain't seen before, gotta love a girl with good reflex
Forgot to wipe the vinyl off DJ almost ruined everybody vibe at the party
The needle hit the wax speaker, came alive, went from halfway dead to retarded
Getting hotter then a gas stove, seen flames rise did somebody in here farted
Most of y'all came around for the end, we be gone to my dearly departed

[Hook]
I said I got a quick story to tell
Would you mind? Could you lend me a ear?
I ain't never seen a dude so cold
Till my reflection when I look right here
Parking lot full of old school cars said she wanna date my automobile
Told her she can have whatever she like
Give anything but my all gold grill

[Outro]
Me and Paul White yeah we got another one
Move cool like a rattlesnake in alligator suite bout to make a movie
And cut, that’s a wrap, I guess that's a wrap, I...I can't even lie, I don't think it getin' any better than that
