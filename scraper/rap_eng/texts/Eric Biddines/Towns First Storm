[Verse 1]
I can hear the storm is a coming
From the way that the rain's falling down
The people in the town is a running
Because they unfamiliar with the sound
And the lightning crashed against the window
And the thunder loosen up the wood floors
And the Fire Marshall say he on the way
Ain't believe in the warning that I gave

[Hook]
I said that town's going crazy
I tried to tell them, tried to warn them
I said that town's going crazy
I tried to tell them, tried to warn them

[Verse 2]
Everybody afraid
The dogs at all the homes barking loud
The tree fell, the car hit the light pole
The traffic sign laying on the ground
But I warned them, I told them I said that I warned them
But they didn't listen, they laughed at me, they didn't listen
Now they hoping, they begging they pleading they hoping
That I can provide a way to make it out

[Hook]
I said that town's going crazy
I tried to tell them, tried to warn them
I said that town's going crazy
I tried to tell them, tried to warn them

[Hook]
I said that town's going crazy
I tried to tell them, tried to warn them
I said that town's going crazy
I tried to tell them, tried to warn them

[Spoken Word]
The ground swept up from under our feet
The moon light dull, even the shadows look weak
The local cafe torn down on the street
Water not being drained, even the sidewalks deep
The aftermath of a community grown without fear
Not even love from a fellow neighbor, could hold back tear
