[Verse 1: Eric Biddines]
Swinging away, swinging away coming on through
Follow my lead, follow my lead what about you
Knocking on wood, knocking on wood keeping it cool
Everything good, everything good do what it do
Living my life, doing my thing, I don't want no problem
I'm in a lane, Paul in the same, we finna change all of
You should of came before it rained forgot your umbrella
You gotta know dat I'm forreal, we gotta do better

[Hook]
Holy moly, macaroni, way the cheese
The clock stopped at a quarter past three
Water hose to the fire kill the flame
It's too late to leave you shoulda never came
Holy moly, macaroni, way the cheese
The clock stopped at a quarter past three
Water hose to the fire kill the flame
It's too late to leave you shoulda never came

[Verse 2]
Swinging away, swinging away what do you say
Never seen you, how do you do, have a good day
Loving your voice you from UK, I'm from the States
I don't desire laying on down, gotta stay wake
Sipping my tea, reading the news, look at the world’s problems
What'll you do when you confused who in the hell start a
Revolution, weapons and guns, it's gonna be harder
I’ma do me, y’all can do y’all, I don't want no part of

[Hook]
Holy moly, macaroni, way the cheese
The clock stopped at a quarter past three
Water hose to the fire kill the flame
It's too late to leave you shoulda never came
Holy moly, macaroni, way the cheese
The clock stopped at a quarter past three
Water hose to the fire kill the flame
It's too late to leave you shoulda never came
