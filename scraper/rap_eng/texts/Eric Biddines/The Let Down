[Verse 1]
The day you’re born
The day you die
Something that we never know why
The more you want
The more you need
The money that you save don't even see

[Hook]
Ain't gon’ let you down
Ain't gon’ let you down
Ain't gon’ let you down
Ain't gon’ let you down

[Verse 2]
My momma said
Don't never leave
The mother of your child cheaper to keep
I bought a bed
But I don't sleep
My pillow stay cold would you believe

[Hook]
Ain't gon’ let you down
Ain't gon’ let you down
Ain't gon’ let you down
Ain't gon’ let you down
