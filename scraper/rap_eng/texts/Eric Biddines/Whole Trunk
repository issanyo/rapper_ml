[Hook]
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock

[Verse 1]
Lane flowin', got the game going
Paint dripped out like it rained on me
Same old school, nothing changed, homie
See the whip got wood like a rainforest
Color flip change, re range on me
Could have sworn it was brown, turned green army
Seen parties, I'm a scene hardly
Ever pulled up wrong, never been tardy
Gotta soul way back couple decades
Wrote about a Chevy, third grade on a essay
Now I got a trunk full, little more than plenty
Copper on the dash look just like a penny, see me

[Pre-Hook]
Swang and banging, I'm driving real slow
Windows shaking, vibrating, y'all know

[Hook]
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock

[Verse 2]
Plane gliding, gotta claim pilot
Motor flow feel like I'm hang gliding
Don't even make a sound, even crank quiet
Not noise, nigga, better say my name silent
Same timing, dash lining
Leather console to the pipes shining
All four walls on the wheels winding
Put a wing on the trunk, now the rear flying
Parking lot swang by the Popeye's
Turn too wide, gotta walk on the inside
Still hear the bass coming through like a semi
Yella bone said I remind her of this guy 'cause I...

[Pre-Hook]
Swang and banging, I'm driving real slow
Windows shaking, vibrating, y'all know

[Hook]
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Hook]
Swang and banging, I'm driving real slow
Windows shaking, vibrating, y'all know

[Hook]
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
It don't bang unless the whole trunk knock
