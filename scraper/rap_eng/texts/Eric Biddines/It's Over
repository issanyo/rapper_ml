Our love is like a roller coaster
Spinning in my mind
Coming like locomotive
Wish I could train the time
I think it's over
I think it's over
I think it's over

[Hook]
But if you really think you gonna miss her
I suggest you put the phone down
Is you looking at the bigger picture?
She the one that you should hold down
I think it's over
I think it's over
I think it's over

Last night had a dream â€˜bout
Me and you conversate on a tree top
Said things that I regret
And you said a few things, your demeanor
Made a folk think back and forth
Had a nigga mind spinned, ballerina
Drove off in a Honda Accord
Tail light on the left broke we was
One of those couples people count on
To get through things when you down on
Your luck and the milk from the cow gone
You hate pizza but you like calzone
And I contemplate leaving get scared when the dial tone
Cuz even hills have ups, and downs same thing for a mountain

[Hook]
But if you really think you gonna miss her
I suggest you put the phone down
Is you looking at the bigger picture?
She the one that you should hold down
I think it's over
I think it's over
I think it's over
