[Verse 1]
Poppa said no matter son, the only thing a man really own is his dreams
The realest thing I heard I know it's true because he left and put his own before me
Working the yard he, body mechanic
Pulling motors out a shade tree
Had a dog name Dexter, had food fed him well ate better then we
I got two sisters and a brother from another man momma had bad luck sheesh
Florida weather ain't no better but the ground hot as desert sand standing on the beach
We ain't even worry, momma made sure we had rice
But it was days similar to most of y'all when we didn't have lights

[Hook]
I'm making a move
Back to the other side
I'm making a move (yeah we’re makin’)
Back to the other side

[Verse 2]
Went to school five days a week, three pair of clothes, shoes had holes
The whole year other kids had Superman toys, show and tell I showed toes
We ain't even worry, momma made sure we had rice
But my friend Henry said you can have Spider Man, here it go it's yours
Went to play basketball in the yard, but ain't have a basketball goal
Got a milk crate, kicked the bottom out, hung it up and the I nailed it to a pole
Daddy got another dog, little Chihuahua
Momma said what was you thinking?
The kids need some winter clothes, Jessica got a trip, now what the fuck you been drinking?
