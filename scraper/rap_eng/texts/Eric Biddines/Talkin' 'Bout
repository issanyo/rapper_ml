Grey Poupon up out the window
Old school style i’m a Nintendo
Maybach keys I'm in a bubble
‘92 Caprice Impala logo Barney Rubble
See these shoes was made to walk a decade
Made to be squeezed like homemade lemonade
When I'm home I'm dapping everybody that I see out I get love from my city
Walk real long like ima limo
Paul White beat degree zero
Been long time I never here no
Body do it like I do it Eric Biddines fear no
On telephone with no signal
Checking the rear my view mirror
Fell in the middle of seeing euros
I'm used to counting quarters and dimes or penny nickels

[Hook]
If you ain't rocking like I'm rocking, then you probably should be rocking like me
Middle finger in my pocket trying not to let nobody else see
I'm tap dancin’ under water with no goggles looking at the coral reef
Never tell a person more than a person even care enough to read
Talking ‘bout


Fell off cold I'm ‘bout to go in
Running my nose I need to blow it
Theraflu rhyme you prolly know this
Flipping a dime you know I'm hoping
That nobody steal my flow and that nobody come up with the stuff I come up off the dome
I don't drink, and I don't smoke, and I don't like to do no dishes
Well I thought that you should know

Made new friends ain't even know it
Area codes I'm like who this is?
How did you get my new number really
I'm confused only few was supposed to have this
Hope one day see purple goldfish
Some may say that if with one wish
They make change but I be wondering
If I'm really meant to give the game something
