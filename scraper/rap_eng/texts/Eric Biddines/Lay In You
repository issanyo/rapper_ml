[Chorus]
Tell you all about my day
And how I missed you in every way
And throw my keys on the counter, grab a couple towels, get up out the shower, then I...
Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours
Lay in you for hours girl

[Verse 1]
Just got off work I'm feeling tired put in overtime
My lil momma just want me back In time for dinner time
She send me texts threw the day to speed the clock
Got me looking at my phone more often then my new watch
I can't be late no more this week
Im in the studio a lot I'm busy forget to have Sex and eat
Don't wanna seem like this music and work it come before her
But she know a n*gga trying to build a ark kinda like Noah
To get my partners out the hood and feed the fam
I know she appreciate me out here being who I am
I could be home invading, or distributing grams
But I can't be with her if I'm behind a cell
Pull in the driveway she peaking threw the blinds
The light in the bathroom she turned it on that's a sign
She getting ready for Eric to come inside and I'm ready for whatever know she made me a surprise

[Chorus]
Tell you all about my day
And how I missed you in every way
And throw my keys on the counter, grab a couple towels
Get up out the shower, then I...
Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours
Lay in you for hours girl

[Verse 2]
She cook me breakfast in the night like its morning
I ate it all up even though I'm not that hungry
She made me coffee how I like don't want the strong blend
15 sugars 4 creamers know it's on when
She bring that song out, if this world was mine, by Luther Vandross played it about a hundred times
That music on to make babies when ovulation taken place inside a lady, don't hurt to be educated so
We in a place that only me and her can go
Eric Biddines got the map to wrap ourself around the globe
She don't want me gone but eventually I got to peel
Got some fans although she number  1 I have to go appeal
And leave you alone, I know you held it down
Laid in you for hours and hours I'm talkin owe!
My legs cramping up, where you put that towel
Lay it on this puddle I don't wanna sleep in ours

[Chorus]
Tell you all about my day
And how I missed you in every way
And throw my keys on the counter, grab a couple towels
Get up out the shower, then I...
Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours
Lay in you for hours girl

[Bridge]
I wanna lay, I wanna lay in you. I wanna lay in you. (2x)

[Chorus]
Tell you all about my day
And how I missed you in every way
And throw my keys on the counter, grab a couple towels
Get up out the shower, then I...
Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours, Lay In You For Hours
Lay in you for hours girl
