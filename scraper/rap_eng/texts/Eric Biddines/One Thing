Verse:1

So I'm right here idled at this red ligt some homeless man came came up to me and asked me for some change
I pat my pockets said I'm broke and then he looked into my car and said what's in your ash tray
I was surprised I said I need this for the toll but if I didn't I would give it to you if I had it.  It's hard for me I gotta pay for gas I'm under qtr tank and I won't make it threw the week if I get stuck in traffic
You see I'm riding with no air condition. I'm sweating more then you is. You gotta sign and  I got rent and two kids
My choice to own up to my doings ain't no different  than the things you did. The same color that you got on yo skin
Now if I'm wrong god can strike me down right now. Cuz this is not a phantom, We had to do our homework by a candle
They cut the lights while we was in pajamas. Spoiled milk food went bad had to fix a sandwich. And that was real tho

Chorus:

See Ima man with a plan and I never really had nothing
I understand this a world and you gotta know just one thing

You know it's hard hard hard x2

If you don't wanna starve starve starve

You gotta play your card card cards

Verse:2

Now it's a line between poor and rich thinner than the hairs on your eye brows
Amen
What you can purchase don't equate to making sense cuz even pennies change pronouns
Amen
Not my concern I'm just stirring up the grits until I bubble off the rebound
Amen
Forgive me lord when I sin again keep me in your prayers bow your head down
Amen
Embarrassed human being ain't talk to god since the last time I needed help. You know I'm guilty I done fumbled had excuses up to here slipped and fell doing bad looking out for self
You think you know me cuz you seen me in middle school, yeah I was one who dirty you had gave me some tennis shoes
Was working at Mcdonals I got fired for stealing food. My karma wasn't at the level that it is today I had to make it do what it do

Verse:3 Blaine

I want to be a millionaire but I'm a million short
Nigga it's hard to save money when you living broke
I have a dream and I'm trying to reach it
But it's getting to that point where a 9-5 is looking mighty decent
Lord I can't do this no more
I done been to the valley I ain't seen no hope
Can you guide my hands and show me the ropes
Cause the devil seems to have a tight grip so there for I'm running
Gunning down for them hundreds
If you don't offer me nothing
Then homie ain't no discussion
Gotta offer the dollars
Got problems feeding my todlers
My father told me don't bother
So don't get mad if I rob ya
It's life round here
When you live in fear of cops round here
Niggas poor but rock ice round here
That's what it's like round here
But I'm a man with a plan and I understand the glam make you feel like you a man
But you ain't nigga
