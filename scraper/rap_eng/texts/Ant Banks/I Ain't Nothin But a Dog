I've been a dog ever since I was young
I saw The Mack and got oh so sprung
I couldn't help it, I had to be just like that
With a stable of hoes and my pockets fat
But don't trip, I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I be a player for life
Forget about a wife
She just ain't my type
Cause I mack each ho and get richer
And if it ain't like that then I forget ya
I know you're just a freak, ho
You're so nasty
That's why you're staring
When you walk right pass me
Bitch, now you're looking back
All dogs must chase the cat
So here I come, I just wanna fuck you and cut
Treat you like trampy slut
So much game when a homies' tough
Meet a bitch like you and smooth come up
I have your fake-ass closing out bank accounts
Spitting straight pimp game from the Oakland-town
It's been done before and bitch, I do it again
Break your mama, your sister and all your friends
$hort dog's on the microphone
And I won't stop macking till my bank is long
So try to break me if you wanna
From me you get nothing but drama
If you're a rich bitch, I got a new twist
And if you're with it, bitch
Then we can do this
Put me on the payroll
Kick me down bankroll
Buy me a Benz and keep my tank full
'Cause other than that, I don't want no broad
$hort Dog ain't nothing but a dog

I got all my game from East Oakland streets
So mother fuck you damn shit-head freaks
Couldn't pay me enough to treat you right
'Cause $hort Dog ain't nothing nice
Like a sucker mother fucker let his bitch be boss
Tell him how much she wants
And, "Let me use your car"
I'm from Oakland, bitch
And you can check my rap
And out here fake bitches get slapped
Let a bitch get bold with me
I start acting like Goldy
Tell me who's in the house now?
Shorty The Pimp
And I'm the last mother fucker
That will pay your rent
I ain't blind, I know you're fine as fuck
But you a tramp, bitch
You ain't mine what's up?
Try to give me some pussy but I want some head
And I already know everything you did
They say you fuck like old-ass tired bitch
But the word is out you suck some good ass dick
And I don't want nothing if I can't get it all
You should know
'Cause I ain't nothing but a dog, bitch

$hort dog ain't nothing but a dog
Bitch, fuck with me she got to do it all
Most brothers try to take freaks out
I get a room and stick my dick in her mouth
They spend money on a movie and some dinner
But $hort Dog will go straight up in her
I give bitches no respect
The way I run my game they understand this shit
You couldn't be like me cause you'll just buy her things
Used to be perfume but now it's diamond rings
I remember when I fucked your prom date
You bought her dress and everything
But she just couldn't wait
For the prom to end so she can call me up
It was our very first date
And it was cool to fuck
Now I be doing this shit all the time
I got bitches on my mind
Can't change in 1992
Cause I still gotta find some new
Sweet, black whatchamacallit? I won't say it
But if it's laying in my bed, I'm a fade it
$hort dog ain't nothing but a dog
Use to clown the hoes at the Eastmont Mall
I was acting like a pimp when I was 7
Started sucking up game at 11
And at the age of a young 14
I started knocking young hoes on the scene
Couldn't give a fuck less about a bitch
Thinking like that $hort Dog got rich
Now I'm making ends and you think I'm weak
Cause I'm always down at ? freaks
Tell me who's the man
And who's the mouse, bitch?
I'm Audi-five to my dog house
