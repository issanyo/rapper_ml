Newscaster: In the news tonight rap star Mack 10 releases his second
Solo album titled "Based On A True Story," and according to reliable
Sources Ha, he laughs in the face of the sophomore jinx. After the
Release of Westside Connection and Mack's new record, gangster rap
Seems to be at an all time high

Verse 1
Either the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat
You either got ends or struggle to make ends meet
You can either turn square or keep the mind of a rebel
Some uppity livin' good some faced with death in the ghetto
I'm a product of the streets so I vow to never slip
So I trust no one and keep a P. Coltrane on my hip
I always paid attention while my O.G's was teachin'
Rule number one if it's on blast the first nigga reachin'
Either death or the pen' shit I had to do better
It was a must I moved on and now I'm all about cheddar
A young entrepreneur I rather slang than bang
Now girls be like you go Mack 10 baby do yo thang
So I continue to get down and I keep writin' rhymes
And I parlay every dollar to flip at least a hundred times
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
And everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus ["Story" sung in background throughout]
You can feel nigga
It's based on a true story
You know it's real nigga
Based on a true story

Verse 2
The year 1986 is when it all started
Now eleven years later we still rough and cold hearted
And as the saga continues I ride the wave like a Sea Doo
Not to knock hip hop but gangsta rap is what we do
Niggas on they first album
Already sold a mil'
So before you knock our style
At least admit that it's real
It's all sex drugs and violence
So you pretend you ain't checkin'
You mean to tell me people
Really ain't dyin' every second
Now y'all made the rules
Niggas can say what they choose
So if you gone ban Gangsta rap
Then you got to ban the news
That means no weather report
No Waco and the bad reverand
No channel 4 channel 7 and no film at eleven
With no high school diplomas we became millionaires
Media mad cause we winning and we really playin' fair
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
And everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus

Verse 3
I crumble green on a magazine
Ready to roll a joint
Damn in this billboard
I'm number one with a hollow point
It was a rough road ahead
But for my kids I gotta pave it
So I twist one shake the weed out
Close the book up and save it
Cause my son li'l Mack
Might grow up and have a crew
And he can show all his homies
This what my daddy used to do
See I was raised around gangstas
And grindas since a youth
So the shit I rap abouts like 99% truth
With dedicated fans from bebe kids
To bambinos and niggas that's CEO's
Before they reach they three O's
Maneuver through the corporate world
Makin' moves to take ours
Rolling big German luxury and Italian sports cars
So watch what you do cause you know we playa hated
And everytime it's a homicide they call it gang related
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
And everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus (2X)

Too $hort talking: Say Mack baby, it's yo pa'tna $hort dog man
You know I got yo back boy. You know a nigga like me I just left
The Ferrarri dealer man. I ain't go lie I know you ridin' rims
But the problem is, it's a lot of mothafuckas out there that think we
Rappers man. That think we just sit at home and make this up at
Our momma's house. I hate to tell y'all man some of us are real playas
Real ballers biitch
