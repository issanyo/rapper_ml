[Intro: K-Way]
It's K-Way in this motherfucka, chase a check never chase a bitch
I'm about to kick a little something on the storytelling tip, Ant Banks

[Verse 1]
The fam did me dirty, who can be trusted?
Like the Gram don't do any of these girlies justice
Whatever resolution, bet she look better in person
My resolution is to be a better person, learn lessons
And let the less fortunate lessen their burden, I won't rest
Until there's nothing less than restitution, let's find a solution before we let it worsen
It goes dro in the jar, couple cans of Coors in the yard
Opened window, opened window, step out from behind the curtain
Skate 3, GTA 5, MX vs. ATV Alive, Little League ties
You and I, we been kickin' it side middle school
Cause before it was designer, Dolce and Gabbana
Spend the night in Sean's cabana, I was pissin' in the swimming pool
Maturity occurred to me, I evolved
But a different dude what you switched into, I never got the glimpse of the bitch in you
You my brother, dude I love ya, unconditional
Don't you listen and get it misconstrued, but revenge is like the sweetest joy
Next to gettin' pussy, I'm aggravated and I wanna know how that'll taste
It's like a slap in the face after everything we did for you
Over Obsessed with drinking, didn't know our limits
Young, dumb and broke, so chauvinistic
Used to talk shit about the neighborhood hoes, that's the way this shit goes
It was Mauro's, now Stefano's every night of the week
Ridin' every day, you lived like right up the street
Pirate Camp, Reed Nottingham, you rocked the Vans
And I had them Nikes on my feet, bout a week ago, week ago
Life was right, ripe and so sweet
Whole family in Idaho on vacation, until my homie had to hit me with the home invasion
Only one who know the code to the location opened the door to total strangers
Full investigation, neighbors saw and the cops involved
Did I want this? Hell nah, not at all

[Hook]
I feel too much, but too much of the time I feel like nothing
Or I feel nothing at all, But the feelings go away when the money's involved
The Day the Earth Stood Still, everything's come to stall
At a standstill, I been havin' headaches that Advil can't kill
Don't nobody give a fuck about me but I got love for you all
Tell me why it gotta be like that, oh tell me why it gotta be like that
I never ever, never ever did you no wrong so how you gon' go and do me like that?
In spite of everything I did you just want more, I should've never ever let you step through the front door
Oh, tell me why it gotta be like that?

[Verse 2]
Couple Crown Victoria's pullin' up on me
Tryna trap me with entrapment, I know my rights, not tonight
My willpower told the Wilbur don't be pullin' that on me, my skin a shade darker would've pulled him a homie
Late night insomniac, I know all about that
Who come out is the freaks, I saw them across the street
I was by the roundabout, had a bottle of brandy down in the creek
Neighborhood watch watching, man I thought that I was out of their reach
Rustling in the bushes, cops hoppin' out of the woodwork tryna arrest us
But that was nothing less compared to what's next up
It hurt to see the whole fleet outside for the meth bust
Just finished bingin' Breaking Bad, Jesse remind me of me
School night, it's that time of the week
Countin' my sheep and I'm tryna get sleep, but the silence is breached by some sirens and shrieks
Ambulance lights reflectin' off the dresser, stop out on the front porch
For a front row seat, I see my neighbor I ain't see in a minute
Get hauled off on a stretcher, flailing down front of the paramedics
I'm sober, I'm sober, man I swear to God I'm sober
I hear that shit, and start feelin' the pressure
The parents called the cops on they own son, so when the sun come up
I gotta get my shit together, you ever had the law come through your front door?
It's like love don't live here no more, it's more than four walls and a floor
The cure to all illness, safe and sound security blanket
Way before the era of Sumerians, the feeling is ancient
And I wanna see you free but please don't get it mistaken, it ain't for you to freely just take it
You ever been that problem child, that made your momma cry?
I done seen tears streaming down her pretty cheeks a lot of times
So fuck outta here if you ain't sincere when you apologize, that's a transgression you can't take back
You can't erase that like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
