Larger than life itself, Big Ball the MC
Mad at the world, fuck 'em all if you ask me
Deaf dreamin', fightin' demons in my sleep
I can't fold, cause it's my soul that they seek
They take the weak, quicker than most niggas can speak
I'm a soldier in this shit, fuck with me and see defeat
Hard liquor, and potent dope help a nigga cope
I heard somebody ask why I wrote what I wrote
Lord don't live here no more, that's my explanation
In reality I live the days of revelations
Deep sedation, a thousand feet above the earth
Cursed, I never knew what my own life was worth
Ain't no turnin' back, in deeper than I thought I was
Lookin' for a buzz, that I can't get from drugs
Ridin', cause if you don't ride you die
Ain't no time for bein' fly, ain't no time for askin' why
Dippin' and dodgin', niggas trippin' and flaugin'
Don't believe until my mob invade they secret garden
Right and wrong, fantasy against reality
Me against me, now who will claim victory?

[Hook]
Got a chip up on my shoulder
And it's got me puffin' doja
It's so hard to get over
But I stay true cause I'm a soldier
Playas love me, suckas hate me
Wanna pull they straps and blaze me
But still I keeps my composure
(And stay high 'til I die) I'm never sober

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Evil minds linger despite your destination
It's pitiful, critical when murder's the occupation
Went from the projects to four rooms and a loft
50 inch screens, no more triple beams, oh man it cost to be the boss
Confederates, they're still tryin' to frame us
Welcome to lifestyles of the black and famous
We gets deeper than the Beta Breakers
The more we flip the scripture Dubb it's like the more they hate us
Deep as the abyss, more potent than a spliff, catch three strikes you out
No matter how much you makin', no matter how much clout
Livin' in Hell on Earth, just keep your hustle tight
To all my doggs posted, hope you get your paper right
Them late nights and gang fights just keepin' a nigga reminiscin'
Drunker than a motherfucker, takin' a long ass piss
From beanies to bossalinis, we used to struggle
Surprise, right before they eyes all my niggas bubble

Got a chip up on my shoulder
And it's got me puffin' doja

Playas love me, suckas hate me

But still I keeps my composure
(And stay high 'til I die) I'm never sober

[J-Dubb]
Say I'm a second class citizen in the world we livin' in
Where them dilligent and militant prepare my mind for the real event
Can't fade us or faze us, them black invaders and raiders
KKK'ers is haters and players but never leave they trailors
Niggas is major, I get bread, fuck them fakers
In the mind they wanna rape us, to Hell they wanna take us
Make no mistakers, they got game like the Lakers
With plans to play us, desecrate us, annialate us
Leavin' us breakers, upon rules and laws
And exposin' our flaws, and have us trapped behind bars
With niggas it's hard, whole lives been ripped apart
And shot in the dark, compromisin' with cold hearts
Providin' them foot soldiers, they took us over
And made us slaves in the land of devils, hand to shovel
Now we got a debt to settle, pass the metal
I'm hot as a kettle, 'bout to take it to the next level
