[Verse 1]
It's time to have a party, so get out your seat
Get on the dance floor, and dance to this beat
Everybody get somebody, and let's have fun
Grab a [?] and get busy, party one on one
Turn on your radio, and let's go for a spin
If you like what I'm doing, we can do it again
'Cause I've got the kind of beat that you can't ignore
Everybody, let's party, get on the dance floor!

[Verse 2]
It's about 9 O'clock and the party is packed
The girls got 'em [?] 'cause man, that's where it's at
I'm chillin' with my DJ [?]
I'm lookin' at my posse and my posse is [?]
