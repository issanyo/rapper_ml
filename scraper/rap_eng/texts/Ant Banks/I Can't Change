Trade mark yeah

(Ant Banks)
Up grave and broke in the hood to straight platinum
I hardly underestimated niggas
Started rappin
Made a mill in this shit quick
And flippin birdies
And I'm still in it - gettin richer
I know you heard me I got the money
The power the fame
So why quit it?
My momma says son nigga do that shit
So keep it real and don't ever change
Cuz you only live once in this derty game

(Captain Sav'em)
I hear you Banks but
I'm havin a move swing
I'm startin to split
Sittin here reminiscin about all this bullshit
Motherfuckers ain't knowin IÂ´m like a kilo of them
Try to shake me up and brake me down turned in a mo game
My daddy wasn't around
All I got from him was nathin
My niggas my dogs laced me about the bulletproof waivin
Whether it's in the game or in the gain
Fool I've been told
Done sold more yak and records I guess I 've been so

(chorus) 2x
I can't change the way I flow (I can't change)
I can't speak with I don't know (don't speak on it)
But if you ride for me and I'll ride for you nigga
And that's how we roll

(Rappin 4'Tay)
This is for the ghetto
This is for where we come from
And fuck the punk ass cops
I used to run from
Tryin to give retirement and plushed out environments
Still quick to break when I hear the fuckin sirens
Killaz and cunts timers guns
Ridaz this's for all my niggas on the run
Reminiscin from doin dirt in the game
Pushin work in the game

(Ant Banks)
The feds think I'm mivin keys cuz I'm paper holdin
Supplyin G's
To my homies in the streets rollin
That's what they called em
But never
The niggas been havin paper forever
And puttin it down for years
And nobody could do it better
Always stay heated
For the case and bid
Keep the stinky man
Van in the cut
If ever needed
Don't repeat it
Cuz hear hustlaz
Always listenin
Speakin on shit
And don't even know
Then come up missin

(chorus) 2x
(Captain Sav'em)
I was major
Thursty,had a nap for this shit
Sellin you know
Tryin to get some Uno's
Up in this biatch
Stuck and starvin was on the main menu
And that's all that it was
Had motherfuckers trippin in shit
With all that blood and crip shit
Cuz started out of the street pharmacies to street promotion
It's all the same
Anyway you look at
It's to sale products for the cash and for the fame

(4'Tay)
You can take a man out the ghetto
But can't take the ghetto out the man
Plus we used to fall in the gangin them grands
Raise spot
Pimps,hustlaz and pushers,cold killaz
Northern killa kali so ? my niggas
Upon a cornerblock
Tryin to follow the phat nut
Givin everything you got
Hopin the nigga don't get popped
And if I do it
Then the consequences are the grind
You say how owe you are
But motherfucker get aline

(chorus) 2x
