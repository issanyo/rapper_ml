[MC Eiht]
Geah
C'mon
Geah

Straight outta Compton, crazy muthafucka named Eiht, fool (geah)
From the gang called C-M-W
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off (boom boom!)
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too boy, if you fuck with me
One Time's gon' after come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm goin' out (geah)
With a gat (c'mon, uh!)
Gots pointed at (geah)
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot like gumbo (geah)
Goin' out on a muthafucka like that
With a strap, that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin' when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson (c'mon)
Tec-9 is my muthafuckin' tool
Don't make me act the gangsta fool
Cause me and you can go toe to toe, no maybe (that's right)
Knockin' niggas out the hood daily
Yo weekly, monthly, yearly
Until them mark-ass fools see clearly
That I'm down, it's the capital C-P-T
Marks can't fuck with me!
So when I'm in your neighbourhood, you better duck
Cause Eiht Loc, is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm bustin'
But when I come back, fool (c'mon)
Geah you know it's Compton

[King Tee]
Straight outta Compton
Another crazy-ass nigga
Punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad muthafucka and you know this
But these mark-ass niggas want show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'mma make my snaps
If not from the records to jack in and craps
Like burglary, the definition is jackin'
But when illegally armed it's called packin'
I shoot a muthafucka in a minute
Find a good piece of pussy, and go up in it
So if you're at my show in the front row
I'mma call you a bitch, or a dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows you slut, don't get close to
A crazy muthafucker from the street
Attitude legit because I'm tearin' up shit
King Tee controls the automatic
For any dumb muthafucker, who want static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself
Every time, I pull an A.K. off my shelf
Security is maximum and that's the law
K-I-N-G Tee and I'm raw
See, cause I'm the muthafuckin' baller
And double baller tossin' up the ???
Ah, that ain't a place without a clue
And once their ass is in the scope, their ass is through
Look, you might take it as nigga simple
But a nigga like T is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton

[Dre'sta]
Straight outta Compton
Another brother that'll smother your mother
And make your bitch think I love her
Dangerous
Muthafucka raise in hell
And if I ever get caught
I make bail
See I don't give a fuck nigga
That's the problem
I see a muthafuckin' cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart
Lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass
I smile
To me it's kinda funny
The attitude showin' nigga drivin'
But don't know where the fuck he goin' just rollin'
Lookin' for my lil' nigga Eazy
I just blast, they never seize him
Ruthless; never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
And with the strap I blast, no hesitation
You hear the screams of the one
Who caught the last penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jettin'
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin'
But what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a fuck about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the D
And if you try to fuck with me
You'll be taken, by a stupid-ass nigga that I'll smother
Beggin' like a muthafucka
Straight outta Compton
