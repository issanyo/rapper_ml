[Verse 1: Goldy]

I was born in a fucking alleyway, open cali-way
Moms and Pops had fucking stuck in the streets I was a hard puppy
Nobody got papers on me cause I'm a stray dog
Mack around stragglin' tail-wagglin’ night-time to the day fall
Peein' on trees and telephone poles
All I do is telephone hoes
Can't fuck them bitches with the fleas giving a nigga the itches
Why must I feel like that, why must I chase the cat?
Cause that head be hella boom and that ass be hella fat
So I stand on my hind legs and I bust a fat fine egg
And I'm hearing your mouth moan but feeling what your mind say
I'm a dirty dirty dog bitch I might have rabies
Only thing I’m good for is to fuck and make some babies
Fuckin' all my hoes gettin' stuck and leaving up knocked up
You pregnant ho? you having a miscarriage from a socked gut

[Verse 2: Banks]

Yeah, gorilla style gangsta mackin'
If you talkin' about you pregnant ho you best to be packin'
Cause you ain't getting three hundred 'outta me I'm taking you to the medics
To make sure that yo bitch ass is pregnant
Cause hoes be trying to come up
And niggas be gettin' spooked
Breakin' these bitches off before they find out the truth
Take it upon yourself to stay away for nine months
Then pop up with a baby I ain't fucked yo ass once
Naming it after me and giving it my last name
She made a mistake I slammed her head through a damn glass frame
It's like thinkin' the bright sun is the fog
She thought I was nice but didn't know she had a baby by a dog

[Hook: Banks & Goldy]

Bitch had a baby by a dog
Don't give a fuck about that bitch and please don't even call
You knew I was a dog when you first had dropped your drawers
And I'm not gon’ play the daddy cause I'm not gon’ be involved

[Verse 3: Banks]

All my bitches are back, but all them fuckin' hoes are pregnant
I told her to have an abortion and I’m makin' sure she’s gettin' it
And bitch don’t try to resist cause if you do you’re getting hog-tied
Knocked you out and stomped you until that fucking puppy dog died
You say I’m wrong fuck you, I know, ho
I’m a dog to my death with my High-Pro Glow
I ain’t a junkyard dog or a hound or a mutt
I’m a pitt, takes no shit and I bust big nuts (Biotch)
So back up off me talkin’ about you 6 months
Too late to have an abortion I’m a bust that bitch once
And beat that bitch down cause you know I don’t care
You got a baby by a dog ass Oakland City player

[Verse 4: Goldy]

These hoes are making me holler, damn I need a flea collar
Runnin with a pack of dogs and wet pussy is what we follow
Dogs don’t wear trojans I raw dicked it and dove in
Bust my nut and cut and seen that slut and she was bulgin’
The Dangerous Crew had told me she ain’t puttin that shit on Goldy
I heard that bitch got kitsch fuckin the dirty ass dog named doby
I roam ready to bone I fuck no bitches in particular
As long as her pussy’s wet and I get head I’ll stick my dick in her
I like to fuck ‘em tag team, smack a fucking drag queen
Go to their room and then switch up
Make em think they had a bad dream
Banks my bitch is asleep, what about yours
(banks)yeah, this bitch is sleeping(banks)
Well sneak out of your bed, creep right up under these sheets
I turned her on her side and held her legs up open wide
I jacked my dick until it got hard and then put it up inside
He’s fucking my bitch I’m fucking his bitch
This pussy’s hella popping
Acting like they asleep but they know we switched and we ain’t stopping
We bust nuts
Switch back
Banks is drinking a sixpack
I wanna see if this bitch act
Crazy cause we did that

[Hook]

[Verse 5 Banks & Goldy]

[Banks]

Off to the next episode we bump hoes in couples
And never tell hoes “I love you”
Because we just want to fuck you

[Goldy]

So if you hoes ain’t fuckin’ how you gettin back to your house?
You better start walkin’ now cause its about 200 miles

[Banks]

These bitches still don’t know I guess they won’t until the world ends
Ain’t gon be no babies and ain’t gonna be no girlfriends
So keep on trying to change me, thinkin’ I’ve got a soft spot
Hopin’ I’ll fall in love, I told you I’m a dog
Don’t play me close and don’t be trying to be too fuckin’ friendly
I ain’t Benji ho, I macks more like Spuds Mackenzie
When I say hey what’s up, it’s like saying can I fuck
You ask me how I’m doing it’s like saying yeah I’m screwing
So cut the shit and stop the talking me and you can start the walking
Straight to the room just another bitch I’ll be dogging

[Goldy]

Introduce myself as a canine, fuckin’ hoes that’s way fine
Fuckin’ the ugly hoes at night and fuckin’ the fines one in daytime
Just got let out the kennel, shit been locked up for weeks
Runnin’ from the dogcatchers, man, they always fuckin with me
Cause I don’t wanna be livin’ in one house, I likes to get around
The dog catches player-hating cause I’m dickin ‘em down
Increasing the population so they wanna cut off my nuts
I won’t be runnin’ the streets, I’ll be hangin’ out with the mutts
I can’t help it I’m a dog so let me be me
If you’re fuckin’ me do it equipped and bring your BCP
Cause I be runnin’ with dogs like Short, hoes be actin wild in court
Thinking that they gon’ get me for some fuckin’ child support
Y’all can all suck my balls, we don’t live be no laws cause
We some fucking dogs
Some Dangerous Crew dogs
