*(Too $hort talking)

Eh yo Baby D, get yo lil ass over here on tha mic man, an show these
Other lil niggas, they can't fuck wit the Dangerous Crew man, spit that
Shit, fo' $hort Dog

Verse 1- *(Baby D)*

This is out fo dogs, wit tha fake attack
I put it out two times, now I'm bringin it back
Wit a whole lot of me
The Baby D
You slippin westsider
But it don't mean shit to me
I'm the youngest in the Crew from the Oak-Town
An when I come through
I lay you niggas down
So what up
Get yo gloves an stuff
It's the Dangerous Crew, ain't no love fo punks
An if you dont know what to do, when I come through
Let this young mack show you
Grab the mic, an tighten up yo lyrics
If it ain't real, I ain't really tryin to hear it
See another MC's gettin mad as hell
Ain't nuthin mo funky than to be himself
I gotta make a knot
While I shake the spot
Cuz I can't be stopped

*(Too $hort talking)*

Lil mutha fucka spittin that shit y'all, that's how we do it in East
Oakland, you know what I'm sayin, Dangerous Crew representin, next
Generation step up baby

Verse 2 *(Baby D)*

Baby D takin over like doja
Open ya up wit that north west explosion
Then I'm coastin
(What ya doin nigga??)
Runnin from the scene wit the ghost like Moses
I gotta let em know
If they mess wit the Dangerous they always know
So get on
Befo you get spit on
I'm rollin in knee high, no lie
Finna get my grip on
From mornin to night, I keep it tight
Aiight
Dangerous Crew fo life

*(Too $hort talking)*

Yeah that's juss a lil sample y'all, Baby D comin through, 1996
Dangerous Crew, my nigga ain't but 10 years old y'all, so, umm, before
You start dissin, you betta try an listen, cuz, he got sumpthin fo the
Future that you lil 'ol niggas can't fuck wit. So Baby D, I'm a tell em
Like this, since I know yo mama might get mad if you tell em....
