[Rappin' 4-Tay]
You see you never talk down on a playa, I'll spray ya
Then break it down to your knee, you best to say a prayer
This funk been a part of my life ever since the startin' gate
Remember me and my nigga $hort Dog way back in '88?
Broke them bitches down with some sexual healing
And man the town ain't been the same since "Don't Fight the Feelin'"
But now your new booty, stayed off in this game on a accident
Copied another niggas style
Punk don't let this rap shit get you broke off
Cause see it's potent like that ain't right
Find a maiden name for yourself, but don't believe the hype
Fool, who you think opened the door for your producer?
If it wasn't for the Dog and them hogg's you wouldn't have a future
And let me add that I could never be scared of ya
Rappin' 4', born and raised off in that Bay Area
Stickin' to that ass like a hot bowl of grits
Hits on top of hits, who you think started this shit?

[Hook]
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' with this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga

[Too $hort]
It's goin' down right now, California mackin' at its best
Somethin' for my niggas on the grind from the West
Cali is my home but its just like yours
Niggas love to get money while they fuck they whores
Hit all the parties, and do the same old shit
Bitches gettin' broke cause the game don't quit
I had a flashback, it was the Oakland Raiders at the Coliseum
We ain't nothin' but players - diamonds glistenin', hoes whistlin'
Bitches know my name cause it's a natural thang
I had to bend a corner, really didn't wanna - punk you's a goner
Heard you was on a - stick up mission, triple-beam in the kitchen
Never shot nobody but I'm damn sure itchin' to blast you
Cause in your dream you shot me
Then you woke up and found out you can't stop me

[Hook]
You see you never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
If buckin' a motherfucker on the mic be a crime
Best believe the police got a APB out on mine
Because I gots more disguises than that fool Inspector Gadget
I'm not a witch, but crystal ball let me have it, ahh
I seen playa hatin' way back from the gate
Now everybody wanna be a P-L-A-Y-A
Why lie to yourself and play the role as a simp?
Knowin' damn well your bitch bought "Shorty the Pimp"
Because they smile in your face
And all the while them motherfuckers wanna take your place

[Too $hort]
That's right 4', we from the old school
Been doin' shows, been comin' tight in studios
Songs on the radio, interviews, and laughs
Up at the mall signin' autographs
And ain't nothin' gon' change in '96
Cause this pimp gotta mack all the finest bitches
And get paid from the game
So they never talk down on a playa's name

[Hook]
You never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch

[MC Breed]
4-Tay, Short Dog, and Breed like this, check me out now
Never that, run it back, sayin' Breed is hatin' you
Takin' you to another level nigga makin' you
And got plenty hoes in the back screamin' "okay!"
Breed fuckin' 'round with 4-Tay
Ice like T out to get payed
$hort Dog bringin' hoes to the pimpery
I - be faded off this Tanqueray daily
Niggas wanna play me but plenty of bitches pay me
Over all I balls more and none test
I keep a gun and I put two off in a niggas chest
And see coincide within the same heartbeat
That's right, now give a motherfucker five feet
Further imformation, I get into meditation
I oughta have yo' ass shakin', I conclude my calculation is -

[Hook] - X 2
