-Nothing, not a got damn dime for your time bitch
-So ahh, ya gone let me spit this, can I do it?
-Short Dawg gone spit a little something to ya, check it out

I've been mackin these bitches all my life
And not once have I thought about havin a wife
Short Dawg in the house, once again
The one you couldn't get with, so I fucked your friend
Cause I'm a mack, doin what a mack should do
I get scratch, just to make a rap or two
You got to give to live, then lay up with me
Can't go to streets, stay up with me
Cause I'm a fuck all night, til I turn you out
If the pussy get dry bitch, work ya mouth
I get a Magic City ho and take her cash
I break her old funky ass
It ain't nothin like a player from the O
Lettin you know I'm a pimp you a ho
Nasty ass bitches, wanna fuck with me
I need money, and Short don't fuck for free

Chorus:
My nigga don't fuck for free
You gotta have money for the D-O-G
Us bitches we don't fuck for free
You got to have money to get this pussy

P to the I
M to the P
Niggas in my crew don't fuck for free
P to the I
M to the P
Short Dawg baby don't fuck for free

I ain't nothin like Mike, I don't play the court
I play bitches, don't you wanna be like Short
First off, I never would trick you hoes
You work hard for my money that I get from shows
And some even ask about my Rolex
Bitch this came from my platinum checks
So break yourself and drop to your knees
I'd rather have ya mouth cause you might have fleas
And even mangie mutts love to fuck
They ain't scared to make a buck
So bust a nut bitch
??? the next one fuckin with me
Cause if you be with me, I'll have ya workin the streets
I'm Short Dawg
And ain't no love involved
Do that old slick shit, and lick my balls
Don't pause so y'all niggas listen to me
Won't ya be like Short, and don't fuck for free

Chorus:
