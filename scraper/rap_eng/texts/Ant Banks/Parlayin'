[Ant Banks]
Now, let me take you
Way back to yester-year--
'Cause it's best to hear:
Goldy and Banks was tore up
But now we guest-appear
With my homie T-double--
Now we trouble--
And down with $hort
Always wanted to fold
A Benz and a 'lex to sport
But on the way to the top
They threw a wrench in the game--
'Cause niggas snitching my name
And punk bitches be lame
So I bags up
Pins my ears to the street
And finds out niggas and hoes
Don't want Banks having
Nothing to eat--
[Goldy]
--Shiiit
I feel ya Banks:
When they smile in ya face and shake your hand...
And wonder when they see ya
Why you ain't' saying, "what's up man?"
Cause I be like strikin'
Trying to get where I gotta be
Goldy got love
Why a busta want to be hot at me?
Buster-ass'n brown-nosing Douglas
You say you hate it
But you really love it
When I spits it to the public
I rides through the East Side
Thumpin young tee-ramps--
Cause we champs
Watch the cars sway
As we parlay

[hook]

[Ant Banks]
I can't take the heat
So I'm stepping out the kitchen
'Cause these niggas keep snitchin'
And these hoes keep bitchin'
Like crabs in a bucket
Trying to hold me back
But I told you that
Ain't no stopping
'Til I'm rolling phat
[Goldy]
I think it's too late
'Cause they're all in my koolaide
Talking about if you paid
Who you faded
You running up smiling:
Acting new-made
You want the truth?
I'll tell you "What's up, Doc"
I don't cuts up rock
I bust nuts up cock
Biiitch!
[Ant Banks]
The Oak Town is burned up
I'm tired of
Watching the next body turn up
Fools is broke and trying to earn up
But now it's real that I'm the one
That jackers looking towards
'Cause I get paid
For the beat, bass, raps and the chords
So now they want put a hole in me
And beat me down
They didn't give a fuck when I was hurting--
Get me now!
I'll be damned if I lose my ghetto pass
Fuck driving through the Town
With the pedal smashed
[Goldy]
I ride in the north
And the west side
But live in the middle-east
I makes mail
Takes hoes to hotels
For a little peace
I like to kick it, I'm a kid at heart
Where did it start
Where you can't ride and side
Without being called a "mark"?
So why can't I ride my old-school
With the silver beam and the shift-kit?
So me and him can get lit?
I wanna be at a light and ask a fool
"you wanted one?"
When the light turns green
I hit first, second, third and gun 'em
I like to hit the intersection doing doe-nuts
'Til my tires go out-- hittin' corners
But fuck an old-school--
Why can't I drive a Lexus or a Mercedes?
Hoes wouldn't jock if they were ladies
You're putting too much on the life of luxury
Now I gotta go under like the thugs and Gs
Why can't we kick it our way
With jewels, houses, cars, broads, homies
And Parlay?

[Ant Banks]
This is nineteen nine four
Because I got none for
One hoe
And partner what you
Want to show yo
Gun fo?
I gots to vest-up
And ride with a thang
'Cause if they catch me in the crossfire
Fools is catching blood stains
You think you got a stripe
For knocking one of my old broads--
Laying up pillow-talking about me?
I gotta phone call--
Heard you started player-hating the Dangerous Crew:
Said we ain't shit, we all broke
And the thangs you knew...
Take something off, fool!
You acting like we G'd yo momma
You don't know me. Get to know me
Don't proceed with drama
[Goldy]
Bitches be talking like parrots
14 karats of Goldy--
You never saw me
You never know me
'Cause  you only blow me
Put your head in my lap
I got you dead in my trap
'Cause you ain't feeling what I'm feelin'
And what I said in my rap
I want to saddle up
And get behind that ass you got
Say "Good Day" and blast off
Like an astronaut
And let you gossip
While I sip
Hendu, Cahlua and Bailey's Cream
And wonder why you say these things
Gary Payton got jacked for his 'lex, man
He earned that. Let him sport it like the next man
They didn't want to see us come from rags to riches--
They got jealous and turned straight fags and snitches
[Both]
We got love for the Town that we came from--
Got our game from--
But we can't beat the same drum
So if you don't see us riding like we used to ride
Don't trip because we ain't local-- now we nationwide
We just want to live a player lifestyle
With new hoes, a new houses--
Fuck a wife now
We still kicks it in the town the hard way
But in Atlanta, G.A
We likes to parlay...
