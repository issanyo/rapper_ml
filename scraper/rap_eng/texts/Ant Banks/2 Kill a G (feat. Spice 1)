Now bitches love an old school nigga like me
Cause I got the pimp G-A-M-E
Some niggas get jealous but they way too soft
I had the whole house rock like the Haywood fall
You know you gotta come real, you gotta come with it
Get caught slipping and your ass gonna get it
Life ain't nothing but a stage show bitch
Play your part and get paid for the shit
You can smoke that nigga, and be on top
But living in Oakland you might get shot
Always over that money and them bitches
Cross the game and watch the shit get vicious
And don't think it's gonna be easy, man
Listen to the Short Dog and peep the game
Cause the niggas out there who shot Davey D
They know it's hard to kill a real fucking G
