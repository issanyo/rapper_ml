[Otis & Shug]
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? I just couldn't stay away
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? The player that's here to stay

Started out it went out to the bitches, until the game got vicious
Had a stripper talking bout, digging each other some ditches
We were two hard-headed niggas, with dreams of being major
Now we worldwide players, known for having paper
So they had to separate us, cause the boss couldn't stop us
It was a smooth-ass case of divide and conquer
Now we back on that ass, who be doing Big Thangs
Rolling Benzos, smoking Rolexes and pinky rings

[Pooh-Man]
Now Banks they thought it was over but I return to burn that ass
How I'm living now player? It don't concern that ass
Two of Oaklands original danksters
Ain't fucking with nothing but ballers, G's and gangsters
Been in the game since 1989
And still you young-ass niggas trying to downgrade mine
See I've been rapping since since your ass ing snotty-nose
With holes in your clothes and still got flows like bolos
And fly solos and kedo

[Otis & Shug]
It's some heavy-ass shit for the mind
When I make a G and I reside
It's some heavy-ass shit for the mind
When I make a G and I reside

[Ant Banks]
Real riders, come ride with me
Big timers, get high with me
Real riders, come ride with me
(The player that's here to stay)

[Ant Banks]
While you was writing the rhymes, I was making the beats
We was signed to Jive and now we back on the streets
A nigga loving it, pitch-black owned and independent
Bombay Music making change now we spending it, nigga
Clocking some scrilla, rolling with nothing but killers
Supertimers, superriders, I know they feel us
With this heavy state of mind, sipping on my fire

[Pooh-Man]
Niggas be look who like the hottest, what you looking for I got it
Best believe for three years I kicked back and plotted
It's the return of the bad man, with the bad plan
I'm supersiding for life and got the best hand
Now see I've been to the mountain top
And that's just cool, Mercedes Benz dropped, rocks and Glocks
Paperchasing from the gates trying to stack some cash
And got a pinky ring full of ice to blind your ass

[Otis & Shug]
It's some heavy-ass shit for the mind
When I make a G and I reside
It's some heavy-ass shit for the mind
When I make a G and I reside

[Ant Banks]
Real riders, come and ride with me
Big timers, get high with me
Real riders, come and ride with me
(The player that's here to stay)

[Ant Banks]
I roll with players like Boo, niggas that know what to do
115 oh zoom, got 'em fucking with Pooh
Told me "Be about your paper" Boss major player
Toss a freak up with Keke and don't fuck with them haters
Real riders I'm home cause the bitches are due
They can't fuck with this player, so the bitches try to sue me
When I'm on one
So much love to my nigga that's on the run, Rock Rock

[Pooh-Man]
See Banks them foos talk behind my back plot assassination
But I just chalk it to the game as playa hatin'
Niggas supposed to be my homies, but they hate mo'
But you stay real through it all, they can't do fo'
But while you talking baby, Pooh-Man is taxing
I'm certified gold trying to hit platinum
But now Banks since we fucking again (What's happening?)
Nigga, why don't you ride that forty-ass Benz

[Ant Banks]
Now see we got more bread to make (More bread to make)
We got more hoes to break (More hoes to break)
Niggas got more haters to shake (More haters to shake)
So much game in the shit, nigga, we can't be fake

[Otis & Shug]
It's some heavy-ass shit for the mind
When I make a G and I reside
It's some heavy-ass shit for the mind
When I make a G and I reside

[Ant Banks]
Real riders, come ride with me
Big timers, get high with me
Real riders, come ride with me
