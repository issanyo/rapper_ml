[Verse 1]
Who is it? The black nigga from the Compton
Fucking with that nigga Banks in the old town
Bitches be on my nutts cause I keeps the pen hot
You shoot em up niggas can't fuck with this
Shake the pizzays
That black nigga Ren in the old town
Bitches jockin nigga from the shit I wrote down
10 years motherfuckers these bomb ass raps
Hooked up with Ant Banks make the bay bridge collapse
Bitches be having craps and crabs on the day
I come outta state, like a nigga movie Nate
It's all about Ren and Banks like the who riders
Motherfuckin Compton niggas got them true riders
In the street full of shit, make niggas shake spots
These motherfuckin clone fighting rolling Pac
Fuck magazines, I get 5 mics for The Source
For all this street shit my niggas took it by force
10 years there go the villain, rebulidin' the new texts
Guranteed, legendary endorcing big cheques
Broke off the sex real niggas don't die
Nigga thinking you the shit cause your homey lie

[Hook]
All you bitch ass niggas wanna ride with me
Goin down when ya can't come in sight of me
Now the villain is back again, (who is it?)
The black nigga that they call Ren

[Verse 2]
Bitches be havin signs reading Ren come and fuck
Villain be meditating have the trick yer we made it
Hands on controlling there minds like remote's
Compton niggas be shovin there dick's
Down there deep throat
I'm Compton's Most Wanted like Eiht and Chill
Fuck the radio and that bitch Diana Steel
We don't be givin a fuck like niggas shermed up
Heard I was fuckin wit bass got yo ass hearled up
Lyrically I can't be fucked wit, wit a pen
Bitches say there pussy's hurt again, by that nigga Ren
I'm nigga fine like them do for self soldiers
Street niggas comin up slinging straight boulders
Too much dick to swallow got you ass about to choke
When I nutt on your face creamy white like ya sniffing coke
Fuck dat, my motherfuckin dick weigh a ton
I think you bitch niggas wanna run, uh, uh

[Hook]
All you bitch ass niggas wanna ride with me
Goin down when ya can't come in sight of me
Now the villain is back again, (who is it?)
The black nigga that they call Ren

[Verse 3]
You niggas ridiculous making me laugh like Jamie Foxx
Jacking up with they momma's acting like they Fort Knox
Clone niggas created em all like Ya'qub
Wonder why they getting booed, imitatin' Ice Cube
Khakhi suits niggas perm the fuck up
Westcoast full of trouts wit no clout, uh
Most of ya'll motherfuckers don't know what ya'll
Talking about gotta niggas drinking ya poison like Jim Jones
Villain's shit be gold in three motherfuckin time zones
But the villain reciting on fort rhymes
Amateur niggas thought they could dub but hall mine
Right ya ass Bruce Lee kicks and back flips
Hooked up with this nigga from the big stack chips
Big thangs we entered that shit I'd be the fattest
Black motherfucker real nigga status

[Hook]
