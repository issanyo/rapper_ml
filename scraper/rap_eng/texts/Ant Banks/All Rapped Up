[Verse 1]
I'm all wrapped up in this ghetto shit
So when the task tried to blast I just smashed on the pedal quick
Heading for the hideout, the night wasn't finished so I
Hooked up with Ron, smoked some bomb so we could handle some business
Bad N-Fluenz minds clickin'
Listenin' to Spice 1 so I'm thinking about the nine spittin'
And you know that smoke season's in
But I'm an alcoholic, I'll be back Ron, I'm bout to go get some Seagram's gin
Riding to the motherfucking liquor store
Got the Mini Tec, four extra clips fasho, just so the tricks will know
Pulled in front of the store, this nigga mugging like he know me
I looked at him, walked in the store, got my gin and Ron an O-E
Forty, when I came out this nigga straight drew down on me
Then out my coat came the Tec, 'What you going to do now homie?'
I knew he was going to try to do me soon
But I'm a mack like Goldy and a motherfucking looney toon
So you bout to have a slug in ya
I ain't loving ya, I tax that ass like the Governor
Didn't see his partners in the cuts smoking Newports
They started busting but my clip was long and theirs was too short
They must of thought I sold heavy D
I make they Caddy look like a steel bowl of spaghetti G
Look how these punk ass niggas want to act tonight
It ain't my fault they didn't know I ain't wrapped too tight

[Chorus]
I'm all wrapped up I just can't quit
I'm all wrapped up in this gangsta shit
I'm all wrapped up I just can't quit
I'm all wrapped up in this gangsta shit

[Verse 2]
Drunk the gin and the forty smoked a sack or two
Now I need two pac- I mean go get two packs of brew
So I can go to see this bitch
I got the Mini Tec but I'm licensed too, you know I got to be legit
The popos still pulled me over and they swore me
They had a snoopin' ass dog, plus I had a warrant, G
I ain't got no time for no drama though
So I bust a Tec out the window and watch them fall like a domino
Rode off like a cool G
Wrap the Tec up, rolled up a cool J and smoked it like a doobie
Striking in my long tan Caddy
A motherfucking smooth assassin like Grand Daddy
Still headed for the bitch house, my partner told me
She was a dangerous dame, but I had to check this chick out
Cause I heard she like tough sex
Like MC Lyte, this hoe wanted a ruffneck
And I got to get some cock today
And if I fuck without a rubber I'm a have to go see Dr. Dre
And I don't want to get no D shot
In my ass, shit I rather pass fucking with that weak cock
I'm finally here so I can see whats up
I got a soul full of mischief so you know I'm thinkin' if she will fuck
When I walked in I tried to show some gratitude
But she was a bitch with a problem and a hoe with an attitude
I asked the bitch 'Can I get some iced tea with ice cubes?'
She smacked her lips, she better be cool, I ain't no nice dude
And she might get slapped tonight
Cause Ant Diddley-motherfucking-Dog ain't wrapped too tight

[Chorus]
I'm all wrapped up I just can't quit
I'm all wrapped up in this gangsta shit
I'm all wrapped up I just can't quit
I'm all wrapped up in this gangsta shit

[Verse 3]
I tried to slap this bitch face off
Cause she was in a rage and she straight thought she was the fucking boss
And then the bitch called me out my name
So I went to another level and put her in the house of pain
She didn't know about this hard place
She tried to criss-cross me up, so I left her with a scar face
She thought that Ant bank account was fat
She thought that I was gone save her and let her help me count my stack
She thought that I was richer then Richie Rich
But I ain't falling for no itchy sticky finger ass trippy bitch
I straight left the bitch in shock G, smobbed off
Thought I was a gang star, can't nobody stop me
I felt like a damn outcast
So I went to the church and asked Father Dom to help me out fast
He said he couldn't cause I was naughty by nature
A public enemy and everybody just hate ya
So fuck it, I'm out bumpin MC Eiht
High as fuck and I'm stuck and I can't see straight
I handle business though, yeah it was a cinch job
I'm out to the cut to hook up with the lynch mob
And I'm about to burn ten more sacks tonight
And I don't give a fuck if I ain't wrapped too tight

[Chorus]
I'm all wrapped up I just can't quit
I'm all wrapped up in this gangsta shit
I'm all wrapped up I just can't quit
I'm all wrapped up in this gangsta shit
