[Intro]
Yeah, we gettin' real on this album y'all
You know I'm hearin' all these rumors out here bout
They ran $hort Dogg up outta East Oakland
Nigga moved to Atlanta, ain't got no mo' love in the town
I got much love in Oakland y'all, you know what I'm sayin'?
I been doin' this shit for years
So I'm a tell it to you just like it happened.... BITCH

[Verse 1]
I don't stop rappin
Ever since the very first day
I grabbed the microphone, made a funky ass tape
I had sixteen hoes
Suckin ten toes
Game from the "O"
An any real pimp knows
The only love hoes get is what they paid fo
Gimme my scratch
What the fuck I'm a stay fo?
I gotta make moves bitch
Stack some G's
From the ho stroll
To my fax machine
I got money comin in from everywhere
From New York
To L.A.,
To the mutha fuckin Bay
It's true
I'm the man G
I'm underground 106 can't ban me
All on the air sayin they don't fuck wit me no mo
I go back wit rap like K-P-O-O
From the very first time I grabbed the mic
Niggas smokin burner
Ready to fight
I don't promote violence
I'm from Oakland where the real kick it
You might get killed nigga
Or make a mill ticket
Move down south cuz the town is wild
Now the radio jocks wanna clown my style
I raised too many rappers you support
Ask 'em who they grew up on.... TOO $HORT
Fuck all that black ball shit it won't last
KMEL y'all can kiss my ass

[Hook]
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort

[Verse 2]
It all started back when C & H
Went to TB tryin to playa hate
I flipped a brand new Lexus '93
Joda Balls called me up said ya lyin to me
He said I heard you an Ran got the cash an split it
If I don't get my cut
You mutha fuckaz gonna get it
It was thirteen G's all mine
Didn't give Ted & Rand one dime
Now listen real close cuz it might be
Hard to follow
Chris told Ted it was fifty thousand dollaz
Shit sound petty
An it is
But that's how it goes when you in show biz
Niggas fallin out
Should be makin millions
Instead of studios
We seein lawyers in buildings
Then we stop speakin
Shit got funky
I don't give a fuck
Mutha fucka get my money
I ain't never been a ho you can't pimp me
I do all the work while you pimp me
I tried to buy him out
But right about then
They let the lions out
Niggas start eatin that shit up
You shoulda never listened
I'm always on this money makin mission
Sold a car an a truck in Oakland fo that Lex
Jock loaned me five an I was rollin that bitch

[Interlude]
Don't believe everything you hear nigga

[Verse 3]
I went to the freak-nik
Shit turned me out
Came back fo jack the rapper
Bought me a house
That was August '93 time to dip
I hade warrants in the town an I was hot as shit
Everytime I got stopped
Nigga went to jail
Treat me bad cuz I was hangin wit criminals
I wanted to buy me a house in the Oakland hills
Nice lil sumpthin fo a half a mill
That's was right around the time Chris hooked Dru Down
The Luniz came through an them tricks got clowned
Rappin Ron tore 'em up on the freestyle tip
An niggas ain't ran nobody outta shit
Then they put it on the town
Shit got real
When you was in the fourth grade I had a record deal
You got one hit record now you ballin
You make one fake album you'll be fallin
An that shit don't apply to me
Present or past
You can meet me at the mall an get my autograph
Or you can flash back
If you can do all that
Me Fred Benz
An Freddy Craps
Smokin burner upstairs in hot lips house
It's been fifteen years an I ain't played out
They playin Too $hort steppin on a Chevy pedal
Back in the days KMEL played heavy metal

[Hook]
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort

[Verse 4]
Niggas shootin at the studio late at night
Seen a Cherokee started shootin at Spice
At the E-40 picnic out in the park
Niggas gather round fo some shit to start
They had bullets wit my name
But we never got to me
See me sucka mutha fucka
Shootin at the street
It was me
Boo, Howard, an Jock
A full clip
One in the chamber an it blockin T.B.,
Still tryin to be my pimp
I could lose my life
Or give my money to him
I'd rather die before you use me
I tried to buy him out
The nigga sued me

[Outro]
And that's where it stands right now y'all
For the mutha fuckaz that don't know
Like the Notorious say, "If you don't know, now you know."
BIATCH!
