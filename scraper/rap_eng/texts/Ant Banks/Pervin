Designated driver, tell me what you think
You on the passenger side or are you drivin?
You get to drive, and I'ma keep gettin high then
Let your square-ass get me home
Smoke a few indo joints to the dome
We gettin high like Jimi Hendrix
Smokin that Northern California Tremendous
Hit y'all upside down left-handed

{E-40}
Uugh, I musta woke up early this morning on the wrong side of the bed
Cause the last thing that I can remember is a sap bitch givin me head
I don't know how I got to the crib, can't recall where I parked my stick
All I remember tellin that hoe was, "bitch, don't bite my dick"
Well, did she bite yo dick? yeah, kinda sorta
How you feelin today? shit, I'm kinda sober
What kinda car was you drivin? I think I was in my Nova
What the hell was you drinkin? Everclear on my Mossa

{Rappin' 4-Tay}
I can't hang with you muthafuckas, y'all way past tilt
And 40 Water, you got your homie sprung on that Gorilla Milk
A gang of that Broccoli to the brain
Hurlin all night off them Hurricanes
I think I just might make a new drink
Gettin to the point where I can't think
Woke up talkin what happened last night? I don't remember shit
But I looked down, seen a bad bitch sleep on a nigga's dick
Feelin the aftermath of the hangover
Coulda been that bomb doja
I'm splurgin and swervin

{Ant Banks}
Sippin on Safire mixed with a little bit of whatchamacallit
Burpin, slurpin, I'm a cold-ass alcoholic
Nigga, perkin, and all that anti-high shit ain't workin
If I don't get to Alcoholics Anonymous quick

M-mh, just flashbacks, I think I need a box of Tums
Cos I got a cold case of the runs
Shit, too much alcoholic consumption
Conjunction, junction, what's yo function?

{Captain Save-Em}
Well, [?], when it comes to drinkin I'm a new boy, a boob, a rookie
Last night these niggas had me drinkin somethin called Silky-Silky
I asked if they can make mine just a little bit weaker
That's when that nigga 40 handed me one these liquors named Moesha
It was mixed with Krypton Brothers blended with a swig of ice tea
Muthafucka, what it is the hell you're tryin to do to me?
Had my head spinnin, stomach shittin out some rocks
I rinsed it down with some Evian water, had me pissin on my socks
