[Intro: Ant Banks]
Huh, I mean, this is nothing, man
Bosses will be bosses, man
Hey V, what's happening, baby?
Talk to me

[Vidal Prevost]
Hey man
This ain't no harder than drivin' a big wheel
Through a Georgia cotton field, man
This ruthless
The original game detector
Yeah, you know what I mean?
About you niggas smugglin, switchin, you know what I mean?
Runnin' off with all my game..  "Oh boy"
All over, man

[Too $hort]
Oh, who really made this shit possible, nigga?
Them Town niggas  "Eastside"

[Verse 1: Ant Banks]
Now let me take you to the Land that's still the greatest
Where the game we display is real contagious
It's filled with players, real G's and innovators
Beatin' on haters like the Oakland Raiders
At the club we dance with a gangster limp
Players pop collars and pose like a pimp
Strike out in the fall, ridin' a haul
Now who the hell you thought taught rappers to ball?....

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
10'000 studio sessions
Up all night, gotta count your blessings
You better take lessons
Who you testin?
We taught you everything you know, ain't no guessin'
Like Iceberg Slim and Donald Goines
Town niggas from the Bay got it goin' on
Spittin' game, that's what you like
So when I'm rappin' on the mic
Don't bite, bitch...

[Chorus: Dionne Jackson]
Did you know we do this all the time?
Are you trying to find some peace of mind?
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[Ant Banks]
I mean, Oh boy Pimping
This is what we do all day, every day

[Dionne Jackson]
Are you looking for that place to go
Where the true players kick game for sure
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[Dolla Will]
Bosses will be bosses
So quick

[Verse 3: Dolla Will]
Yeah, it's the new millennium, yeah, Y2Yey
We been puttin' it down right here in the Bay
Keepin' new game to spit, what is it?
While the game ?proof? your ear ?hustle takin' a nap?
Like they invented it
All in your video poppin' your collar, what is it?
That's a Bay thing, take it from Dolla
I'ma tell you what's real, ain't no time to play
We here to stay, the whole damn Yey, let me sweep away.....

[Verse 4: Captain Save'm]
I got kids that look up to me, and you can bet
I even made on-line investments on the internet
With overnight Fed-Ex's and faxes
Young producers and C.E.O.'s worldwide makin' it happen
Independent distribution was the solution
For the CD's and computer-generated barcode we was usin'
Street teams posted at the retail shops
Movin' units out the moms & pops....

[Chorus: Dionne Jackson]
Did you know we do this all the time?
Are you trying to find some peace of mind?
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[Vidal Prevost]
Either you gon' be with it or without it
But us Bay Boys, we gon' be about it

[Dionne Jackson]
Are you looking for that place to go
Where the true players kick game for sure
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[Ant Banks]
I mean, this is a everyday way of living for us pimping
Oh boy

[Verse 5: Vidal Prevost]
From doin' burn-outs in old school Coupe De Villes
To popping X and gettin' court dates for shootin' to kill
Who was the first artist you ever heard to say the 'b-i'
And what was the first CD you ever known to keep it p-i
Who was the first to work the ???? creases with the Levi's
The same soldiers on the frontline claimin' Eastside
Oakland, known for totin, we showboatin'
Rockin Roleys in 500's and keep the tires smokin...

[Verse 6: Ant Banks]
It's rough in the hood tryin' to raise your seed
Wanna hide all your problems, blaze the weed
A lot of homies is dyin, boy, I gots to live
Before I go I better stock a grip for my kids
And that's all that counts to me
But what it amouts to be
Is who will look out for me
(If I) didn't turn out to be
A G, laced with game essential
I'm tryin' to keep my kids from goin' through what I went through...

[Chorus: Dionne Jackson]
Did you know we do this all the time?
Are you trying to find some peace of mind?
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[Vidal Prevost]
It's real simple, man
Follow the boss and you will never get lost like what

[Dionne Jackson]
Are you looking for that place to go
Where the true players kick game for sure
All you need to do is let us lead the way

[Outro: Ant Banks]
Yey Area bosses doin' it so big
J Spencer Oh boy
