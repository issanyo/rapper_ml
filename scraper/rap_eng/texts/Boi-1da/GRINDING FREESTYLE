[VERSE]
First off I go pro like cameras
They couldn't touch this hammer
Mc you see me just go get your camera
I say this correct boy no need to check grammar
I come bearing gifts they should just call me Santa
Shoes black and white they be looking like pandas
Ain't seeing defeat I don't never wear sandals
Yeah I stay lit like a light with no candle
Chris Paul with the handle you will get dismantled
I'm crossing you up then I dip like some ranch ho
Got this shit covered like I had a pancho
Trap out the bando I stay fly like goku
Girl this ain't Facebook ain't trying to poke you
Michael phelps swag girl I'm trying to float through
On the late night watching netflix on roku
If y'all playing 2k my homies will roll through
A grinder some Dutches and yeah we can roll too
Pardon the subject that's just what I wrote dude
My momma know I have matured and I've focused
My mind on that green my ambition was locus
Flow sicker than magic hocus pocus
If you ain't get that line focus focus
What's good with them munchies I'm hungry like roaches
AG been a player don't care who your coach is
Won't stop till my name make it's on way on your poster
My shit give you chills like that glass on the coaster
She came for the ride she call me roller coaster
Six flags I'm dancing like old men in dance shoes
I feast on the track this a plate with utensils
You act like your 10 still what's wrong with your mental
The way I kill tracks it is not accidental
They way I be flossing it's good for my dental
They told me relax it was just instrumental
My fault my bad now I'm the devil
You look at me crazy like I hold the pitch fork
What do the lick read what do it hit for
Fuck do I spit for to get mom a new car
A two door a four door whichever she want more
A lord in ring I am cruising through Mordor
Like Frodo and Sam yeah we went on a long walk
Thought about life and had a really talk
This college shit really taught me so much
Now I murk everything that I touch
And I'm killin it last shot I'm clutch
Watch me run it like old Reggie bush
I was smoking that og and kush
Police came I threw that in the bush
With the apples and such
Yeah you know had the Mac with the book
You would have known I'm type nice if you had happened to look
See what I'm saying Ray Charles what I spit is automatically good
Left the Bronx got up outta the hood
Now my outcome gotta be good
Like Noah's ark made it outta the flood
Karma kills and you drowning in blood
For not showing me love
Anderson paak
Did it for the love of the drugs
Cousin skeeter I was close to the goods
Get it like Megan good
Going hard like I got morning wood
I don't get it I'm just misunderstood
Overpass I be sitting in class
Thinking about all the girls that I smashed
Man my life going by in a flash
See cheese for the cam dipset they be holding it down
Man I miss when Juelz was around
Tic toc I'm the bomb like a soviet now
Knight with the crown
John snow i be like walking nobleman now
This should maybe help you notice me now
Cus I'm moving with the potency now
Not a god but a king to be crowned
Now a days it's not hard to be found
Drop a verse put it right in the ground
Cemetery holy Mary
I'm a goblin you a fairy
Commissary condiments
Demon all up inside of him call up Constantine
911 for the murder seen
Look like a slip up happened in Burger King
I'm gon tell em what's the rule like I'm signing to murder ink
Favorite color pink I be spitting like by sink
I been plotting to buy a mink but tuition I gotta think
Download all my shit yeah I got a link
Sometimes yeah I kinda sing
Momma told me I should do modeling
You know Wearing designer things
That kinda my kinda thing
Spit so much bars I'm kinda tired of it
Flow so tired kinda out of it
Rip I'm signing out of it
And all this real shit I got a lot of it
Living life on the edge I admit I'm kinda high and shit
You know like I'm flying shit
Fresh to death like I died and shit
Still buying shit...
