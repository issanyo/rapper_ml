This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
That chick you work with?
One of your dumbest hoes ever
Goddamn this shit clever
And we on that rule 3
We fuckin' Alison Bries
An' 'e eatin' Wendy's with cheese
But these boppers Whoppers to me
The hoodie's a couple Gs
Drew the strings for the windy breeze
Mardi party in New Orleans
Mean the chinos are pressed and clean
Woo
Batman of the game
And the cash grows fast
Like Wayne is the name
Ah
Bruce or Stilwell
Oh you don't feel well?
Go on take a Benadryl
Go on Cat women
We ain't goofin' tonight
Unless she look like Anne or Halle
And 'dem pants is too tight
Then it might be a'ight
Just bring some cookies and henny
And a party pack from Zax
Before I call Alfred Penny
Worth every fuckin' cent I dropped
On all this 2.0 swirv
Now you on that 2.1
I Put this beat mouth on the curb
Yuck
