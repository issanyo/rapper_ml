[Hook: Haley Hunt]
Fell down
Got up off the ground
Was lost
Was lost but now i am found
And now I'm coming back to say
I found the way [x6]
He is the way
Jesus is the way

[Verse 1: Bizzle]
The world keep telling me to chill
They feel I'm a genius until i tell em that he's real
They kill your credibility for repping him, but still
I'ma tell 'em there's a heaven and your enemy is real
You can let Him be your shield and your luck upon the field
His Word the sword, your weapon, it better be concealed
Ain't no medicine or pill that can heal the void that only Jesus Christ is eligible to fill
I am not just repeating what they told me
I am telling you things the Lord showed me
Faking I don't be, anyone who knows me
Knows the difference between this and the old me
If we were both broke and I got rich
And I came back to show you how the clock shifts
Would you mind then? you shouldn't mind now
I'm just coming back to give you what i found

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bizzle]
I couldn't stand tall till my knees hit the pavement
Sin cost a grip and He was the payment
Heart of stone, coraz√≥n, needs a replacement
Beef or evil deeds lead to the state pen
Leave it to Jesus to break men that have false teachings received from the playpen
And slavery made it easy to hate men of a different color, race, creed or persuasion
Knowing that it had to be mold into cash money, the women, the fashion, the clothes
To cover up the fact that a young black cat feels inadequate without having it close
Looking for a way out, thought it was in the payout
Flirted with the game, then we begin to make out
Killer venom in her, woulda went up in her too
But the Lord came before I could get her to the room

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bizzle]
We all fall, but dog get back up
Your fall isn't your call to act up
If you can hold tight through the flames, know Christ'll carry your soul right through the pain
See I done had Christmases where i couldn't get my chick a gift, but she laced me
So the next Christmas just to get gifts I hit licks and laced her crazy
And cats'll respect that like it's nice where I be at, nobody ever said it ain't right
The funny thing is, in my head it seemed right, and I was still [?] gifts to celebrate Christ
This world got us all so twisted
Heard God calling and almost missed it
Saying I found him, but really He found me
I'm nothing without Him, he's still God without me (a gift)
