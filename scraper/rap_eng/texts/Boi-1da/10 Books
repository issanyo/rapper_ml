[Pre Chorus]
Ten books, fifty books, hundred books
Hand them out, won't read, won't even take a look
Aw, man. Just keep on with the fight
I ain't tripping. They'll come around when the timing's right

[Verse 1]
I can't tell you all that's happened
I feel like I've lived three lives since my mama's passing
She's dirt napping, I'm tapping in to the verses
Converse with a convert, I'm trying to demolish sin
Hold up! Now let me say it with some passion
Cause I am not afraid. This ain't Life.Church, I ain't acting
I ain't fronting, I am stunting on the adversary
Need to read the text; ain't talking 'bout no Blackberry
Let me tell them

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]
I been on my knees praying for us
I just think the world need some more love
I been in the house going crazy
Reaching out, I just need you to save me
World's dark, yeah you know what time it is
Cause of you, now I got a life to live
Sorry that I always let you down
When's somebody gonna help me now

[Pre Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Going on a mission, 'bout to get the two in
Open up your heart. Go ahead an let the truth in
I put aside the women and I stopped making it rain
It finally clicked that I'm forgiven now I'm trying to help him reign
Yeah, babygirl, you real cute. I don't think I need to be alone with you
I'm 'bout to call my boys, cause they're the only ones know how to help me get through
Don't come at me malevolent. I got some evidence and I will make it evident
That what I push is Heaven-sent
And your hate speech ain't relevant
Get them to see that He's the start and end. (Whoo!)
Get them to see that He's the one again
And if you see my ex, tel her I didn't say hi
I don't mean no disrespect but

[Pre Chorus and Chorus]
