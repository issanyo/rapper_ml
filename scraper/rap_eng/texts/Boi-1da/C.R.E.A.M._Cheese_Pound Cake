[Verse 1]
My biggest fear; dyin' alone...or livin' inside of a retirement home
So I climb to the throne; and see the world beneath me
And in my head, I know the birds'll be the first to greet me...
I know the birds'll be the first to greet me, if I make it to heaven
I'm gettin' the urge to see the world from Stevie
Wonder's perception, for just a couple of seconds I know my mother's intentions
Was for me to go to school, but it seems it's overdue;
Thinkin' in her head, "What else is he supposed to do?"
But I don't like college, I like the music more
Plus if I got a diploma, what would I use it for?
But who's the music for? I'm just sittin' here
All alone, nights alone, with this microphone
In this booth made of styrofoam, behind the mic
I'm tryin' to blow up, like dynamite, but I'm the guy
That other people used to take advantage of;
Thinkin' that my hands were cuffed, but fuck it man I've had enough I'm standin' up
Cause I could give a fuck if people listen; they'd probably say my dreams are too "unrealistic", screamin'

[Verse 2]
Then they told me life was about, finishin' school
Finding a spouse, and then buyin' a house, to live in
Watching television as you lie on the couch; reminiscin' and steady wishin' without the slightest of doubt
That you could go back to the days when life was simple and fun
You wish you were young, you're mad, cause you didn't become the man....
That you thought you would be, it's all about the dough, arguably, it's all about the
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake; million dollars you got a pound cake
Labels keep tellin' me that I sound great; "play your cards right, you'll be the brown drake!"
But, I prefer to keep my own style
Paparazzi yellin' cheese, but I won't smile
When it comes to the dough, I'm no dummy; no honey, no cheerio's, that's mo' money
And this morning I spoke to my inner child
He said, "What's up, man?" I told him, "It's been a while"
"I noticed, you've been goin' in and out, of prison, switchin' positions-"
"But what I 'posed to do, sit around?:
I had to move forward to progress; but never thought I'd lose my soul in the process
The older that you grow, the more colder and heartless
Maybe I was better off, all alone in the darkness, screamin'
