[Intro]
Lickwood means "rewind" and gunshot means "forward"
You requested it, so we rewind
You Tryna sneak Diss?
Yo, How's that head doing?
(Chill)

Hook:
I got enemies, that tryna be friends you see
This is why I keep my circle small like a penny b
Everyone on Instagram, always tryna flex on me
But it's really nothing this is no time for discussions

Verse:
You ain't nothing, went egg hunting easter, last sunday and nothing
I found nothing, you ain't nothing I am something i'm not fronting
Because your girl is on me homie, she be feeling lonely
She wanna come home see, she be feeling our team
We ain't kill, we ain't rob and we ain't sell
But I know about your past and I am god so go to hell
Because i'm tryna keep my mouth shut you talking too, well now what
This is really nothing wanna get it we can get it
Because I see a lot of fakes, I see a lot of lames
And i am at your face, if I see you face to face
State to state on my way I will put you in your place
Aye NJ, Aye M-Town, i'm the king and no debate
I been in the basement playing lowkey
I heard you sneak dissing i'm like no please
I heard you be popping like a zit b
While you sipping activist must be so lonely
Case closed I don't want to hear that ish
Everybody Talk now it's clear that's it
I could never ever let my town down
There's so many fakes dog in my town
Everybody be head button this bout to be mass destruction
And i'm the god so go to church and we are gonna have discussions

Outro:
Chill!
