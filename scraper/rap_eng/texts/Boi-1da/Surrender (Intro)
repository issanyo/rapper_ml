[Verse]
Runnin' with the wolves, split a pack of the 'Woods down
Wizard with my words and my lifestyle understood now
Say they wish me well, but this is not the lows now
Say they wish me well, but they don't wish me well
Lighting up the city, ridin' foreign with the hood down
Used to have me blocked, now you checkin' if I'm good now
I had too many switch up on me, I am the only one that I need
Bright lights surrounding me
Wash away your sins in the Hennessy
Surrender your soul to the YYZ
Surrender your soul to the YYZ
Had my first show at the end of '15 (yeah)
First video came summer '16 (yeah)
Success is my revenge and it tasted so sweet (swet)
She left me on seen, now she suck me no teeth (me, me)
Bad yellow bone, she just wanna blow trees
Yellow brick road, red bottom, blood leaves
A few for every throw, that's a band on my feet
I can't text no see 'til I pull up at the scene
