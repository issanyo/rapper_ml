[Hook: Pharrell]
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevard
The rain is gone
The rain is gone
The rain is gone
From the block to boulevard
The rain is gone
The rain...

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
This shit make me feel a certain kind of way
This shit feel good
This shit feel like... some Carol City shit right here
My nigga Peanut rest in peace
See you would felt this right here
I'm on my Convertible Burt shit...

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm feelin' myself, hope you feelin' me too
God forgives and I don't, unforgettable dude
I'm ballin' my nigga, and that's word to your mama
I want you to ride, definition of honor
Honor thy brother, but murder these hoes
Always pay your taxes, never pay these hoes
Always making moves, I didn't make the rules
I'm just making ends meet with this plate of food
Went from Spaghetti-O's to a new set of Vogues
Back to square one, we still was selling those
My Tribe Called Quest, shit was nice dogg
Gucci was Q-Tip, I was Phife Dawg
On the world tours with all the wrong whores
Had the right ideas, and all the wrong stores
Timing is everything, rhyming is everything
Geechi Liberace, put diamonds in everything

[Hook: Pharrell]
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevard
The rain is gone
The rain

[Interlude: Pharrell]
Yeah man, ya heard?
I rock Chanel nigga, yeah, Skateboard, heh

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
They say "Skateboard, you racist
You only hang with white Cubans"
Nonsense, that's the necklace nigga, the light's moving
This is jewelry, that shit is foolery
Frozen water on my neck nigga, who cool as me?
Up in mansion like the black Kurt Cobain
My nigga Ross said he's the boss, cause he works cocaine
And under no certain circumstances
Will the facets of the diamonds not be disrespectful
And hurt your chain, and your feelings
Yeah they villains but I'm chillin, I'm still a N.E.R.D
Millions and millions and millions off of verbs
Well my niggas be stealin and killin and thrillin for the birds
Making deals, squeezing the life out of them Nextel chirps
I'm on my iPhone (uhh)
Bitches put their naked pictures on my iPad
The doors go up and iGone
Black boy scoring his life, I'm scoring the Oscars (I'm really am, nigga)
Remember I used to want a Pasha and eat some lobster
But now I eat the apple with my A-P
Your life and your wrist got the wrong timing, you hate me
Says the little boy that loves you, who had the ashy feet
Now I wear that ashy white suit out in Fashion Week
Where the upper-classes meet, that's just me
...I smash the beat

[Hook: Pharrell]
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevard
The rain is gone
The rain

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uhh, dedication to motivation, gave 'em motives to hate me
Old homies betrayed me, running around saying they made me
But when I had a quarter, they had, four and the baby
It was a whole different story, but fuck them niggas is shady
Now I'm self-made, self-paid, and I give myself a raise
Whole circle shining nigga, never had no selfish ways
Never had nobody tell me 'go and get it' tell me 'save'
Had to learn on my own, ask my Mama I was gone
Puffin purple getting stoned, trying to take the pain away
Now its Rolls Royces, umbrellas for a rainy day
Old heads told me "young fella, this ain't the game to play!"
Had to take the chance, told the dealer, "deal my hand"
And now that nigga's getting murdered, shit is getting scary
I put mirror tint all in the ghost, I'm screaming Bloody Mary
Nigga Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
Let 'em cross the line of scrimmage, they get fucking buried
They had me cutting through that field just like a rushing Barry
Slammers play with hammers
Had them birds but we don't fuck with Larry
I was just trying to ball, ducking D's and grinding raw
But now I pull up in that thing, them niggas gon' need some Tylenol
I'm gone!

[Hook: Pharrell]
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevard
The rain is gone
The rain

[Verse 4: Stalley]
I'm staring at my notepad like goodbye to my broke past
Words full of money, use dollar signs as my periods
I'm gettin money - period!
They said I got a old soul and I'm rich nigga spirited
So one time for the old-timers and two for the new school
Three for my geechie niggas with big rollies in that new coupe
Blowing on loud, sippin on that dirty juice
With a tre duece livin life like they ain't made loot
Cause whats here today could be gone tomorrow
So I'mma get it myself
I ain't known to ball make sure my kids is straight
In case I'm gone tomorrow
Young Bonaparte, I'm noble dog like Drew Ali
Dark shades like Kool Moe Dee, cool fly nigga is who I be
Big chain with a bigger charm
Leave with a bad chick under my arm
Uhh! Geechie Liberace
Diamonds on everything, even my posse
(Diamonds on everything, even my posse)

[Hook: Pharrell]
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevard
The rain is gone
The rain is gone
The rain is gone
From the block to boulevard
The rain is gone
The rain...
