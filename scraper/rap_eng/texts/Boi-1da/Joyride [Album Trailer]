[Intro: Tinashe]
Somehow I found myself here
Alone, trying desperately to get away from the noise, the hatred
I know I have to go back, something inside tells me

Maybe they haven't adequately heard me
Maybe I have more to offer

I've discovered something out here
Something that can't be duplicated
Defaced, simulated, neglected
Something that's so powerful, need to share it with everyone

Haha, I can't be ignored...

Motherfuckers... I can't be ignored!
(I won't be ignored)
