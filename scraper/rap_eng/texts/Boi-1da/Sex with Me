[Chorus 1]
Sex with me, so exclusive
All this all hard work, no excuses
Pussy so good, baby, that it's stupid
Found a nigga in his feelings, hit him up like Cupid
Sex with me, so exclusive
Sex with me, so exclusive

[Verse 1]
Bubblegum, ballet and yoga
And a few other tricks I'm tryna show ya
Boy, you know I ain't the normal type
Yeah, you won the lottery tonight
Grippin so hard when I ride it
Tell me if it's tight enough for you
I'm not stopping there, I'm about to make your face my chair
Lick me like la la, you know that I love it like Lucy

[Chorus 2]
And sex with me so exclusive
Sex with me, so exclusive
Pussy so good, baby, that it's stupid
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me

[Verse 2]
You know I got the sauce, you know I'm saucy
And I keep it so sweet 'til I taste so good, licking on that body
Want you deep inside me
I ain't stopping now, I ain't cum yet
Got a long way to go, let's make it one to remember
Sex with me is exactly why the other shit you had was wrong
The sex doesn't get any better, bet you won't really last too long
Okay, okay, let's get one round out the way
I can keep going all day, you know that I don't play

[Chorus 3]
Sex with me, so exclusive
All this all hard work, no excuses
Pussy so good, baby, that it's stupid
Cut him off, hit a lame nigga with them deuces
