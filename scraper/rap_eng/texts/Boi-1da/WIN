[Verse 2: Jay Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck niggas don't stay outside when I play outside
I put the beats on, I'm like Dre outside
I got the Bay outside, and L.A. outside
And if you act bad, I'll bring the K outside
Go and get your money, bitch, none of my niggas on some funny shit
I can tell real by who you runnin' with
I'm all in the field, duck huntin' shit
Hit my plug just to re-up and he was like, "Boop, here"
Migo knew just what it was, flipped the whole dub and gave it back, "Boop, yeah"
911, no mileage, baby, 9 ball, but no violence, baby
My trigger finger got callus, baby, my bare knuckles got talent, baby
I'm all in the wind with it, on Deuce line, I've been with it
She too fine, I been hit it, crashed two times, I limo-tinted
My new ride, I'm ridin' with the toaster (toaster)
12 better not pull me over (over)
Championship goin' dumb
Nothin' to somethin', I won, bitch (woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)

[Chorus: Jay Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way yeah (yeah)
Get out the way, get the fuck up out my way, yeah (yeah)
You either with me or against me, ho (ho)
You either with me or (wait), win win, win, win, win (yeah)
Fuck everything else, win, win, win, win (win)
These niggas ain't shit (mommy), win, win, win, win
Stop chasin' that bitch (stop), win, win, win, win (yeah)
