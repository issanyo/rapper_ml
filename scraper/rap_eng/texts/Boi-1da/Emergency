[Intro: Mavado]
Yo Khaled! This one is like a movie, he-he
Anyway! Gangsta! Ay!

[Chorus: Mavado]
Emergency! Emergency!
I tried to warn him now, we watchin' B!
You know I told him
Death before dishonor!
Oh, it's death before dishonor!
Don't make me have to put another man down
Just watch your head when you hear that sound, oh
Emergency! (Gangsta!) Emergency! (Gangsta!)
His blood all on his face, he can't no longer breathe
You know I told him
Death before dishonor!
Oh, it's death before dishonor!
Don't even bring it to me if you know it ain't right
You know, I'm a gangsta for life, oh

[Verse 1: Mavado]

[Chorus: Mavado]
Emergency! Emergency!
I tried to warn him now, we watchin' B!
You know I told him

Oh, it's death before dishonor!
Don't make me have to put another man down
Just watch your head when you hear that sound, oh

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Please, Lord, please Lord, watch over my kids!
Nightmares holding the devil within
Pistol by my side I'm replenishin sins (Anyway!)
Niggas try me I'm rearrangin his limbs
Cold heart got it from this cold world
Put the pump to your daughter, poor girl
City of Gods, kill or be killed
I know some [?] do it admire the thrill!
Welcome to hell! Praise to your god
Emergency cause murder may come in disguise (Anyway!)
I hit my knees and hope that my father reply
Man down bury him suit and a tie (Gangsta!)
Now why they made me go and do it?
Now why they made me go and do it?
I ain't no killa but he pushed me!
Look him in the eyes, who pussy?
Stare into your barrel nigga, please, squeeze!
Ain't scared of death, be afraid of me! Be afraid of me!
Exactly how they live in the Gully!

[Chorus: Mavado]
Emergency! Emergency!
I tried to warn him now, we watchin' B!
You know I told him
Death before dishonor!
Oh, it's death before dishonor!
Don't make me have to put another man down
Just watch your head when you hear that sound, oh
Emergency! (Gangsta!) Emergency! (Gangsta!)
His blood all on his face, he can't no longer breathe
You know I told him
Death before dishonor!
Oh, it's death before dishonor!
Don't even bring it to me if you know it ain't right
You know, I'm a gangsta for life, oh

[Outro: Mavado]
Oh! Gangsta!
Gangsta!
Gangsta!
