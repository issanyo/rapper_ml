Jocks call me losers but i’m homies with the school shooter bitches try to play me but on tuesday we gonna do em

Pipe bombs sawed off, take they head all off
Trenchcoat tec 9 run around and flex mine

(verse)

Lost highway speedin driven
Rebel guided vodka driver
10:50 perfect timing plant diversion set and Time it

These other nigga did it wrong
It’ll be strong in Vietnam
Let me go set off these fire bomb
We going to take out like 200 strong

Brains splatter guns explode smile on my face shooting foes me and eric made a plan

Murder as many as we can, let me pop my shooting share blood with ever body

My name is dylan klebal live illegal
Love bust my eagle

My homies got the mode riffle roger so i’m homies with school shooter
