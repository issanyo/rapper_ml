Lyrics from TV Torrance release

[Intro]
I show my colors like a paint pallet
My music going hard
Break you into gray glass shards
My music gonna have great talent
I ain't in a gang, I ain't grunge with rap ballads
Me and Caaden finna break in for the bacon and leave you shaking
Lucky you, yeah
Lucky you, eff you too, woo!

[Refrain]
I for real shoot
I for real shoot
I for real shoot
You are not cool
You are not cool
You are all fool-
You are not cool
You are not cool
You are all fools!

[Verse 1: TV Torrance]
Gave your mom a call, she coming with me to save money at the mall
Is that a dressing room or a recording booth
I use a pen and pencil or a doll of Ken and stencil
It is your end after I send
Older with white hair than creaky broken stairs, look like a bunny
Your colder career ain't crazy, you lazy
Your cussing career ain't sunny
I'm just very lucky
I've got a caring motto stuck to me
It's I'm a god with a flaming rod
I'll beat up and uppercut your dog
Teachers tell me no, no, bro, bro
Lil's look creepy like Momo
So even though you hate me now
Mo' even sowed, you click bait he and broke the vows
Listen, you don't know about my life
You ain't a bro if you lived in a drought and cried
I feel like Joyner with Winter Blues
I for real have fun and respect Pump, sike with the who ever knews
I'll go Em' on 'em with the venom
LebronRapJames.com is the bomb
Bumping my head to my playlist just to say this
And today is a new chapter to indent in
You're lucky, you
You're lucky, too
You got a platinum album
You forgot the fact you can't sit down 'em
Slay the beat, I got a 4K TV
Sit in the electric seat with no leaving
I got 6ix9ine, Pump, and Xan
I got 10 lives, you're dump, man
I just made you smaller than a Runt candy
That was with my ranting
