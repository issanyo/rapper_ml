[Verse 1]
Don't tell me about nothing you heard before
So why you ain't tell me then, that you was plottin' on me, boy?
When I look in the mirror, what I see? Nigga, the real McCoy
So I'm not the one to fuck with, I'm not the one to toy
Rest in peace Blits, they took Nahom, my nigga
My heart hurt everyday and I'm out here living like I'm dying to stay
I could have it that way or this way and any day, I'll pick this way
Chillin' where the thugs stay, where my people love me
Around here and nigga, I'mma make this clear
I'm more than a rapper this year, I'm more than a trapper this year
I'm more than a P.I this year, I'm more than that guy this year
Let me make this shit clear, Flame Boys, nigga, this is our year
We've been getting' money these days, but still won't turn down no favours
But since back in the days, we ain't really change those ways
Still out here on my filthy prep set, money be the motive, nigga, calm and collect
I'm doin' the long way cuz, we all know shortcuts dry blood

[Hook]
Enough is enough, time to get my life right
I've been going in round for round, nigga, I fight the fight
I mean these niggas try to pull me down, but I'll be alright
It ain't nothin' I ain't used to, this ain't shit to me
Now watch a young nigga make history

[Verse 2]
The bitches wanna see a nigga make it
The bitches wanna see a nigga take it
The bitches wanna see a nigga bracelet
And I just wanna see the bitch naked
Photogenic, bitches give me photo credits
Gotta be European if my niggas in it
Throw it in the gear, Flame Boys in here
Movin' through the city how we should
I'm never gon' act Hollywood
And niggas actin' like they made it
Foul shit, nigga, I'm talking flagrant
Niggas ain't livin' like me, niggas ain't driving whips like me
Niggas ain't talking' to bitches like me, I'm on the court side like Spike Lee
Da Degrees, do it like we do it for TV, and I don't need them, they need me
Believe me, believe me, I'm Lean, baby, you could find me in the streets
And we gon' party hard all day, and we gon' party hard all day
I never really had something to celebrate about 'til the fame came out

[Hook]
Enough is enough, time to get my life right
I've been going in round for round, nigga, I fight the fight
I mean these niggas try to pull me down, but I'll be alright
It ain't nothin' I ain't used to, this ain't shit to me
Now watch a young nigga make history
