[Intro: KING SOL]
One of a kind, I say what's on my mind

[Verse 1: KING SOL]
You don’t know, how many times I thought I told myself that I could do this
Day after day I pass my hours feeling like I’m clueless
Nikes on my feet, they telling me just do it
Too many rappers from the hood it’s time to start a movement
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told I’m a fool
Cause I’m not lying I’ve been sunk down by ridicule
Like bro you’re white, you’re such a nerd, you go to private school
Like where’s your backwards hat? You’re wearing glasses that’s not cool
Well, I’m satisfied with it. I like my gray hoodie
I’ve just been drafted to the game I’m feeling like a rookie
I’m smarter than Snookie and boy oh boy I’d vouch for that
A democrat, I drop a verse they want another batch
This ain’t a statement bout race, this ain’t a song about color
Cause man or woman black or white we’re all just like one another
Now I’m not tryna cover or go hide in a gutter
But turn the rudder change your lane so that we all don’t have to suffer
I told you once, now imma tell you twice
See there’s a point to all these songs that I have tried to write
Cause even if you try with all your might and right the wrongs that aren’t right, you’ll end up losing your whole life, like Betty White, don’t try to fight
I won’t drop a finger cause I know I can rap
Some people think that rapping’s swearing but look that’s just crap
Sure man, I want the throne more than y’all could ever know
But sometimes it ain’t about the end it’s all about the road

[Chorus: Elise Marlin]
Lights getting brighter, people raising lighters, feel like I’m about to give it up
And then I reach out through the fire, find what I desire, now I’m lifting up
I see the lights, I see the crowd, someday I’ll be up on stage singing to the crowd
You never know, never know where you’re going, but it’s your life and you gotta start owning

[Verse 2: KING SOL]
People out there try to put me down say I’m not dope
Like, “I see your walk you’re such a wannabe, a joke”
Sure, but not as much as your life
At least I’ve got some purpose...but you don’t even see the light
I thought I told myself just what I wanted
I came in like a force and then I plagued it like bubonic
If you can’t enjoy the journey of finally getting there
Then really you should stop complaining because life just isn’t fair
Flashback to sixth grade, I’m playing Tap Tap
I hear the radio buzz, the car passes a Gap
I know you wanna hear me yell about some chains I been owning
But at that time I realized it was my moment so
The words come on, I’m following them tryna get the story
It’s 50 cent but to be honest his flow is at forty
He talks about some cash, screams out he’s throwing hunnids
Flying across the globe, he’s skipping all the lines at customs
But I don’t need that, man start examining life
Cause there’s a fine line between me and you sharp as a knife
Sometimes you gotta take a risk, you gotta roll the dice
I guess if you wanna be different, well, you should add some spice
So it’s time to ignite, time to put out the flames
I ain’t doing this for myself, I do this thing for the game, man wassup

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: KING SOL]
So I’m just tryna change the road that we on
I’m tryna change the path we head down before it’s so far gone
Where’s the America we dreamed of? Happy people on lawns
The people rapping are the role models and they’re all created wrong
I’ll be the first to say I’m far from perfect
These rappers shooting, drunk driving, who gave them their permits?
Rap is so complicated, and I hope that people learn it
But I’m dreaming of the day we look back, and say that it was worth it
All of the morals and the messages I’m tryna get out
It ain’t the drinking and partying, that’s not what rap’s about
Find love and inspiration, I been through so much work got perspiration
I wanna change the game, but now, I’m just making observations
And I don’t want domination this ain’t me being complacent
See there’s a time and a place for all this rap game
But if you like Pusha T, then you in desperation
This is my declaration, I’m done with explanations
If you can’t see my tears well you should look into my face and
See all the things that I’ve been thinking and the road that has passed
Because your first is never as good as your last
So now, all I can do is hope that you will listen
Jew Chainz doesn’t have to be 2 Chainz, he’s being different
I’m embracing my position, I’m changing liberalism, I’m making a composition so that one day, we can say

[Chorus]

[Outro: KING SOL]
So the next time somebody tells you you can't do something, you prove them wrong
