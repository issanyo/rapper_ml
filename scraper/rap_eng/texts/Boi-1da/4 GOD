[INTRO: TEY BOOGIE]

I'LL ADMIT IT, I'LL ADMIT IT
I'M NOT LYING BOY I DID IT
IF I SAY THEN I DO IT
YOU CAN REALLY GET THE BUSINESS
IAN DID THIS IN A MINUTE
RIDIN' THROUGH THE H WITH THE TINTED
COOKIN' UP LIKE A CHEMIST
AIN'T NO FAKING OVER HERE BOY I'M WITH IT

[VERSE 1: TEY BOOGIE]
STOP PLAYIN' WITH EM TEY
YOU WAS ON THE SAME BLOCK THEY WAS MOVIN' CAINE
WE AINT GIVE A FUCK BOY THAT MONEY WON'T A THING
BIG T USE TO MOVE A 8TH BY THE BANG
TELL IT HOW IT IS AIN'T NO LIES IN MY SHIT
GETTIN' DIRTY MONEY NOW WE BUYING DIFFERENT SHIT
THE REAL EIGHT KING, THE REAL FOUR GOD
ADD A ZERO TO IT CAUSE WE NEVER TOOK A LOSE
MY SQUAD TO SICK, WE DON'T TAKE NO SHIT
RUN UP ON ME THEY GOING TO MAKE THE SEMI SPIT
EVER TRY ME KNOW I KEEP IT BY THE HIP
I'M FROM A DARK PLACE WHERE YOU VOW NOT TO SLIP
I'M FROM A MEAN PART WHERE YOU GOT TO MOVE A ZIP
YOUR BABY NEED FOOD SO YOU GOT TO MAKE A HIT
NIGGAS MOVING HARD, SEE A COP BETTER SPLIT
YOUR BOYS AIN'T GOT NO HEART SO YOU STUCK WITH A BID
25 TO LIFE TRYING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT
YOUR PAST SO BLACK SO YOU WENT TO MOVING WHITE
RIDIN' IN NEW THINGS, FLOSSIN' WITH NEW BLING
BUT WHEN THE SHIT END, BOY YOU BETTER THINK TWICE
I'M GETTIN' LONGWINDED LET ME FINISH MY SENTENCE
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SO YOU KNOW I'M BACK IN IT
RESURRECT THE FLOW FROM THE STREETS I ROSE
THE BITCH BOYS ALWAYS TALKING BOUT GETTIN' CHOSE
ALI WITH THE PUNCH NO SUBLIMINAL
CAUSE IF YOU WANT IT BITCH BOY I'LL FINISH YOU
THE CHICK THAT YOU WITH AIN'T REALLY FEELING YOU
I SIP TEA AND LET YOU DO WHATEVER YOU DO
BACK TO THE BASIC, I SPRAY SHIT
I HEAR YOU TALK ALOT
MAN YOU DON'T SAY SHIT
804, GOT THE CROWN I RUN SHIT
YOUR FLOW SO TRASH MAN I DUMP SHIT
MY MAIN DOG GOT THE CANNON WITH THE DUMB CLIPS
ACT UP AND HE'LL MAKE YOU BALLERINA SPIN
(HOL' UP) I SAID IF YOU ACT UP RUN IT TO MY BIG DOG
AND HE'LL MAKE YOU BALLERINA SPIN, BOY!

[OUTRO: TEY BOOGIE]
804 GOD
I JUST GO WITH IT I'M THE FLOW GOD
THEY FUCK WITH ME CAUSE THEY KNOW MY FLOW HARD
BUT MY CITY ON THE MAP, I'M THE 4 GOD
