Verse:
Cash rules everything around me, it confounds me
I'm the teacher and I'm testing all my boundaries
Now it seems God just has no say in my life style
My brain is so hostile, how much does love cost now?

Uh - I'd want to run away with you
This vision of a dreamer's love is so ambitious
Treat you to a cruise in Bermud for a day or two
PreacherDude moves to California, man it's vicious

So delicious, but it's sin in men
Cinnamon, chasing after buns, then a pound cake
Cause you're worth the "weight," sweetie, you're a synonym
I ain't feeling them, I ain't listening, in the lounge, mate

Chilling with Team Future, we be super, on our "globaleyes"
Started from the bottom, yeah we got 'em with the "localeyes"
Yeah - X Factor since the '95
Man I've always had it - I just finally arrived

Christ rules everything around me, that's a fact
Runaway wherever, us together, we ain't coming back
Tell my homie Jose thanks for always picking up the slack
Kid be ill, Will be trill, Cisco got us on the track to

Fame, Glory to the name above all others
How could two PKs become struck lovers?
My future children couldn't ask me for a better mother
Rhymes are gross when they go in tubes, like a gutter

I'll take this world by storm, on top I'll always "rain"
I'd have y'all feeling like Holy Kingdom 'ready came
Y'all are carbon copies, dated and the same
Too clutch like a double stick, know the game

Man we overcame, they say they don't feel us
For reala', like their hearing really got the novacane
Nothing was the same, but words ain't ever changed
His words stay true forever - like Drake's hot single, mane

I wear Express, I'm for that city...
Rhymes are never less than gritty...
Boo thang always looking pretty...
Wu Tang asking for some pity, say it with me

Runaway, runaway, I just wanna escape
Olive Garden, you on flip side of the table, best date
Press statements: christian rapper got a hottie
No you ain't Illuminati, God illuminates your body

(God, he) knew just what to do with you; I will never halt
Best lines I've ever written, I'm committing cause it is your fault
Uhh - body bags every time I'm preaching
Killin' it and killin' flesh, someone get the deacon

Don't underestimate my flow pattern
Put a ring on it, you're my own Saturn
Lively rhymes, I got a Blake kinda feel
This love is kinda real, what's the deal right?

Jay Z gon' be made at me
We get it poppin' like bad acne - uh
Run away from everything, on this track they yelled
"Money over everything;" really: over everything?

It takes a certain strength to not break a heart
Must be some kind of weakness to break apart
But there's nothing we can't work out, I got my spirits lifted
I said you're worth the "weight" - don't be so dismissive

Rock for la familia, putting beats on death row
Flyer than Amelia, yeah we got the best flow
No se hace eso, King David since day 1
Demons looking like "crap, they won" (DAX)
