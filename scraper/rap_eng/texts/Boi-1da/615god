I'll admit it, I'll admit it!

[Verse]
Watch your juvenile tone, boy
Don't get hurt, boy
I think you lying to me about liking that Merk, boy
Need to focus on the work, boy. Need to focus on the work
I think you told me to get over her so you could swoop in. I'm hurt, boy
We was boys, boy. We was supposed to be
Now where do we stand? Do you oppose me?
Get gone, son. Get gone
I'm about to give you some advice you need to follow it like Monson
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Just because we're through don't mean I'm finished
I am me and she is she
So neither one of us your business
You need to worry about your business
You need to put aside your feelings
You need to worry about your dealings
Why you gotta take when you're already given?
Boy, get out my kitchen
You see me in here flipping
You must be on vacay, cause I know you is tripping
No, I'm not the angry type
But you're making me the angry type
It's a bout to get messy. So, please grab me a Handi Wipe
Boy, you think you something. Well, boy, I know you nothing
You're talking behind my back. And that's how I know you're fronting
Don't come at me with the BS. I don't like to play; no recess
And if you try to play me, you're playing yourself like a DS
I'm not protective over much, but this is something you don't touch
I can list all the plot holes and still stay clutch
I'll admit it, I'll admit it!
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
(Ha, got him!)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it!
