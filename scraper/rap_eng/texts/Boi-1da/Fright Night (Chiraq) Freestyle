[Intro]
So you know what time it is, fire, you dun know
Big up all my fans, team Chip, CM squad, check

[Verse: Chip]
You see, man like me grew up on man like Ghetts
Came through when I said I was next
I can back my talk
Left spitters outlined in chalk
I can name you a list of corpse
But I don’t need man coming back from the dead for more
A quad bike nearly took my life
I hopped up like Jesus walks, so what we sayinl now?
These MCs remember me well
Man like me might go off the rails
Futuristic flows, no behind bars
That’s probably why I ain't been to jail
Or needed bail, turn me up
Man want a hot verse, phone me up
Tell whoever said they're the best MC
Chipmunk, I'm the cunt that will call your bluff, yeah
I ain't bad but I’m bad with the pen
I ain't even from there, I’m the man in your ends, woo
The Weeknd got me gassed up
Might touch the road, skrr in the Benz
You see the windows up, hot box again
I pick weed over oxygen
Whatever genre is long for 'em
'Cause I got more sides to me than an octagon
So go on: rap, pop, grime or take your pick
In it for the hype, you don’t want it with Chip
Can’t even lie, I read all your comments about peanut head
I'll still take your chick
See, man, I shoulda bought a crib before a watch and a chain
Spent a Crib on a watch and a chain
Dumb mistakes I ain't makin' again
But now I’m in the Crib, watch and chain
See I had money, lost money, made back money
Gettin' with the white folks, spend black money
Sell a type of line to slide a hundred niggas
What, you thinkin' I’m gettin' that you can send back for me?
Yeah, can’t lie, I don’t need a promotion
Your flow's dry, oh, you need lotion
Give me the beat, me, I know what I’m doin'
Niggas call for a feature 'cause I bring something to it
Oh, you signed Universal or Sony, blud?
Where your top ten, where your Rollie, blud?
Who lives at 140 Grime Street?
You know Chipmunk's home, open up
I’m like sho sho sho, man show me love
I might show up to your show, show you up
I coulda went first but saved me 'til last
I'm turnin' up, yo, turn me up
I start skippin' double Dutch, know the flow's too much
Old mixtapes what I zone to, blud
I don’t really wanna hear anyone's shit
You UK rappers all moan too much
I’m in a position that they really wanna be
Funny, I ain't even where I really wanna be
I can hear me in all these new niggas
Got me prayin' that my fans can spot the wannabe
Like fuck it, I’m better than, like, all you niggas
Put me on a track, I'll finish all of you niggas
You don’t really want it man, come on then, clash me
Can’t even lie, fam, Kendrick gassed me
This kinda verse saying man haffi pull that
Had girls twerkin' before it was called that
If it ain't money on the phone, call back
DRS zone
Look, I’m still grimey, try me
I'll murder an MC for Wiley
What, you think I’m lyin'? Go on then, try me
Left Atlanta and came back wylin'
Fuck labels for now, don’t sign 'em
Me, myself, and I, I’m doin' my ting
Well, you feelin' some type of way?
Fam, I was really in the A
Spendin' more than I was making dough
Like, thank God I got fans at home, shit
Travelin' just to find myself like
What you know about them journeys, doe?
I step back, analyse the game
Big up Grim, it was harder then
But if history just repeats itself
I, done it before bet I’ll do it again
Somebody give a pen, yeah
'Cause that boy got his focus back
So bun you hoes, I’d rather bash
Taking snaps more than you rap
You man post too much, I’d rather clash
Hmm, somebody try
Who said I’m dead? Somebody lied
Say it to my face, watch a MC cry
Rollie or not I'll stop a MC's time
Back to grime wanna diss Chipmunk, nigga, what are you on?
Tell Tinashe I’m 2 on
If I give you a verse, maybe a hook, no lie dawg I can put your crew on
Killing every remix, get to my part wheel it
If I do a cover everybody run for cover hey Nicki if you see this hope you feel it (Wooo!)
Hey I’m not you though I am not a just come you ain't got a clue though
It’s not about the jewellery I'll back off the Hublot
I can do your flow, better than you bro
Sorry if I use that, don’t get too gassed what’s that skunk?
I don’t want twos that I link the Rastas I want the high grade
Places that It took me I swear I met 2pac, yo
Now they wanna holler I ain't hollering back
But road man the game can I borrow it back
The way I write it’s a lot to bite
You might have a hard time swallowing that
Ain't commitment time nah forget that
There’s bare tings goin on in my head back
I lost friends and I had a couple setbacks
But yo forget that I just wanna get back so
2015 new music, load the cannon and we can shoot it
Ballers saying they’re Danny Welbeck
Watch a real young gunner do this
Still the grime scene saviour
Rudolf raver
Chick-King eater
T-high streeter
Gladesmore jumper
Adidas sneaker
YEEEEEAAAAAH!!

[Outro]
Ya dun' kno', dun' kno'
Believe and achieve, two part project
First chapter Believe, second chapter Achieve
Took my time to try make something that is from the right place in my heart
Been through bare tings, around world and back but I'm back, yh
2015, Team Chip, Paw Gang
