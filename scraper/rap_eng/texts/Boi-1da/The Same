[Verse 1]
How many shots do you miss
Before you get one in?
How many times do you drown
Before you learn to swim? Uh
Been a million places, places
Never heard a new line
I don't know
Seen a million faces, faces
Never recognised one like yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Started with a look across the bar
Barely had a drink, I’m trippin' on
Tattoo of your woman on your arm
Don't know how we wound up in your car
Til’ [?] I'll be CH
[?] so you should stay
And I don't even know your name
And now I know I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I'll never be the same without you
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same without you
No, no oh
I'll never be the same without you
I’ll never be the same
I’ll never be the same without you
No, no oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, how many seeds do you plant
Before it starts to grow?
Guess when they say it's true
And you know, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Started with a look across the bar
Barely had a drink, I’m trippin' on
Tattoo of a woman on your arm
Don't know how we wound up in your car
Til' [?] I’ll be [?]
[?] so you should stay
And I don't even know your name
And now I know I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I'll never be the same without you
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same without you
No, no oh
I'll never be the same without you
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same without you
No, no oh

[Bridge]
They say "why you change?"
I say "why would you wanna be the same?"
"Why you changing?"
I say "why would you wanna?"
They say "why you change?"
I say "why would you wanna be the same?"
"Why you changing?"
I say "why would you wanna"

[Chorus]
I'll never be the same without you
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same without you
No, no oh
I'll never be the same without you
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same without you
No, no oh
