[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeah, let's go in on em Knodge
You already know
Yo keep that vaporizer plugged
In though you already know
I'm be back there in a second
I'm sorry mom I had to do it to em
I mean uhhh yeah yo

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a hard one to get along and get on a song
While I'm smokin' that Godzilla and battlin' King Kong
Straddlin' lovely women and doin' my thing hard
Eatin' rappers on my diet with a Nutri-Grain bar
I still whip the same car, smoke bud out the same jar
And get higher than a fuckin' Quasar
I am a senior to these rappers, never a J.R
And stay rollin' like a cart through the isles of K-Mart
Spit it with flava, don't work but play hard
I'm on my space ship about to invade Mars
Any opposition, I'm embarrassin'
Allergic to wack, so if you steppin' to me, I'll need a Claritin
Rappin' straight heroin, no one can compare to him
Spittin' flames like Eragon, Canada to Maryland
Brazil to Alaska, they know me as a rapper
Stay fly, just turned in my applications to NASA
Roarin' like Mufasa, eligible bachelor
Your girl's like a slice of cheese all up on this cracker
Phenomenal flow, bein' better than Webby is not probable
If it's even possible yo, rockin' a show
Droppin' it, my brain moves very slow
Comin' around like havin' sex on a Mary-go
Killin' any scenario with my man Adam Generio
Who's had faith in me since the beginnin' so there we go
Here we go, and I'm back on a beat
And fact I'm a be, I'm actually
Gradually growin' up, rollin' up a bag of the weed
Dope as fuck, hittin' em' up like Kimbo bitch
Swollen nuts hangin' down lower than a limbo stick
I get it crackin', get your windows fixed
So try to run, I'm a catch em' like we playin' sharks and minnows bitch
Ya'll can't see me like a blind mouse
I'm a bad boy just got off a time out
This is my house you'll get beat without a doubt
Cause ya'll are sittin' ducks, like Daffy on a couch
I get them punchlines know what I'm a fuckin' bout
Haters need to get them selves some scissors bitch, cut it out
I'm a fuckin' grouch, no Oscar
Music runnin' in my veins, learned it from my father
Ho don't even bother, I'm back to chokin' ya
That's why they scared of Web like Arachnophobia
Haha, bitch

[Verse 2: D. Lector]
And he's back, Knowledge
Officially changin' my name to Danimal Lector
Body collector

And you are about to get broken in like a new clutch
Your rockin' with them two fucks
Who killed White Noise, them white boys not the Ku Klux
Don't get it screwed up, I'm too tough
Built like a mothafuckin' GI Joe, minus the crew cut
Holdin' a huge dutch, swollen like it juiced up
I'm doblin like dude what, I don't pass after two puffs
Two words I never heard, "you suck"
Like LeBron fadin' away with the J better suit up
I'm reinvented literally, listen to the differences
Now I got my green growin, call me Photosynthesis
I wrote a song about it and it goes something like this
My dicks at the top of your chick's Christmas list
So bitch let's get it poppin like acne
As we, tag team this rap game, tag me
And I'll gladly jump in and swing for the fences, relentless
So if you wanna step, bring your dentist
Or catch a death sentence, my wordplay's tremendous
And the chronic Super sonic on some Shawn Kemp shit
I'm a problem, matter of fact I'm grimy
Like Mad Max I've been a badass since the 90's
Flashback finally
People startin' to recognize that I'm the shit.com back slash try me
Faggot ass your solved and to add to that, tiny
Push your eyes in traps back try and find me
I'm high so don't mind me
Danimal to cosminot, a lot of pot
Shit hits hard, I call it Ronnie Lott
Kicks like a karate shot, my dicks like a shotty cock
Ready to bang and your chicks like "oh my god he's hot"
No shit bitch, haha, what up Webby!
