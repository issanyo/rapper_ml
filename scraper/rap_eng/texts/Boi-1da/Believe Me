I Ain't really selling what you buying
No I don't
I don't really have what you buying I just double checked
Believe me
Believe me
You see me smile I'm talking joker like I know Jerome
Selling weight inside the party it's time to celebrate
My music like the drugs, yeah, it circulates
I am in this season bout to act a badonkadonk shamone shamone
She only know me by my twitter I just asked her ayo whats her name ayy what's your name
Blowing up my phone but she oh no date
She just wanna hook up I cannot complain
Hit me on another Friday n not today
She call me Stunner she ain't even know my last name
I know you special coz I know too many
My pillow talking always confidential
Say she love me I say she ain't ain't loyal
I'm making private conversations looking like we made it
I'm rocking Japanese
E/C looking I'm made in Tokiyo
Eating sushi this the new japan
I see the jacksons just wanna sell the never land
Lemme buy that bitch n walk in like I'm Peter pan
The boy Just finally turned into a man
Always been the crazy type my mom's praying I turn into a better man
Never need no plug in my life I do everything by myself
Call me on the weekend may just buy you H n M or that new Chanel

I Ain't got no icons all of mines is dead
May you live forever triple x
Told my homies in the projects we ain't never be the same
Selling records on another level
Yeah! Cliff Stunner on a new level
In the streets I'm still the same rebel
Ain't in the industry I am in the music business
I mix rap with some rock n roll fuse it with some trap I call that shit some gangster business

Ayy, ayy
I love the way this beat banging though
I always find myself getting really emotional when, I get speak my shit over such beats
This is me paying homage to wayne, this is from the Carter V right
Believe me

Shout out Boy1da n Vynlz for this instrumental
I may just hold on all my albums till the Carter drops
Now lemme flex
6 albums know I'm always grindin
6 figures for a verse I don't flow for nothing
Yeah yeah
New singles on the way
I still got more than 10 summers left
Standing ovations for days
Bitches say I'm acting less
I want advance for a freestyle
I wanna dance to a prince style
I want a verse yo super-duper kyle
I need a boujee bad chic with class
Others get attached too fast
Dinner plans late night
I got the fans in Dubai
I got More fans in Amsterdam than even in my city
I got some stans in Kazakhstan I don't even know where it is

This is a public service announcement from African Mafia, my name Cliff Stunner, and I love all my fans
