Verse:
(I'm regretting all the times I told myself "you gotta push her away")

...I only kind of mean that, close another door behind me, baby got a mean slap
...I mean, fuh real - no joking like a knee slap, had to please ask
What's the deal? ...you don't want to talk? ...is it my fault?
...had the key to your heart ...now it's in the vault

...the present isn't pleasant when my life's most greatest gift is essentially the past
...screw you, screw them, screw everybody else who said it wouldn't last
...I hate the truth - I love it when we lie together
Now it seems we lie together, lying's better, but I don't want to lie when I say my heart (belongs to you)

...how about now, girl? got me like
What about now girl? I'm putting out an album, it's the only way I'd ever really get on track
(Huh) Get it? - Nope?
I fell in love with a memory - me mori de depresion

Muscle memory, forgot why it didn't work out... Don't say it's cause I don't work out
...I tried giving you my all ...tell me: why doesn't it work now?
...I was never up to par ...now you're calling me a star
Supposed to spit 16; for you I'd raise the bar, used to say "heaven's anywhere you are" but how about now?
