[Verse 1: NAV]
Shop so much, I ain't got no fingers left for my bags
Everytime I get dressed, I pop one or more tags
Bought me a rover truck because I don't want no Jag
Keepin' a 40 tucked, 30 rounds in the mag
Yeah, my stomach hurt 'cause I been rollin' all week
And I've been up for 3 days and I forgot to eat
Doin' donuts in my V, throwin' up in my suite
Every bitch say I'm sweet, but every bitch know I cheat
Car and I'm payin' the [?], breathe air less than I smoke
Can't swallow, my diamonds choke, narcotics inside my coat
Thousand bitches inside my phone, pay for everything that I own
These rappers sound like my clones, but they ain't take me off my throne

[Chorus: NAV & Belly]
Look at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)
Jump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)
My diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)
Stay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)
Look at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)
Jump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt, yeah)
My diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling, yeah)
Stay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah, look)

[Verse 2: Belly]
Drippin', drippin' on 'em, Super Soaker (Super Soaker)
Ooh, I'm lit now, supernova (supernova)
Yeah, I changed, I used to sleep inside the sofa (sofa)
Always high, bitch, I ain't never ever sober (you know I'm not)
I don't gotta look up now, stars alignin' (oh, yeah)
Me and NAV bought matchin' Rolexes, that's perfect timin' (oh, yeah)
I got that dope, no consignment (no consignment)
Catch a fuckin' chest cold from all these diamonds
But you know I'm on fire, fire, fire (fire)
I don't ever tell a lie, lie, lie (woo)
But I can see it in your eye, eye, eye (see it)
I know you wish that you could ride, ride, ride (skrrt)
Yeah

[Chorus: NAV]
Look at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)
Jump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)
My diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)
Stay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)
Look at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)
Jump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)
My diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)
Stay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)

[Verse 3: Derek Wise]
Driver pullin' up, I fill his trunk up with my bag (skrrt, skrrt)
Next, they do the same thing like a stripper's sugar dad (yeah)
First, I bought the Bimmer, but I'd rather the G-Wag (yeah)
19 years of age, was livin' better than my dad (fuck it)
Switchin' up, all my old friends barely know me (barely know me)
Fake niggas 'round my niggas, couldn't fool me (couldn't fool me)
Cash just called my phone, said cut the loosie
Niggas got they motives, fade like Boosie (yeah)
Doin' the dirt on my own, can't track my traphouse (trap, trap)
Nickel and dime for my youngins, I'm movin' the pack now
VLONE all over my jeans, can't rock no Levi (nah)
Don't keep no receipts, I BMF on these sides (BMF, yeah)
30k for a show, that's just a bracelet
My new bitch just got karats for her lasik
Money crypto current, couldn't trace it
Got some people that entitled, never make shit (never make shit)

[Chorus: NAV]
Look at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)
Jump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)
My diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)
Stay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)
Look at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)
Jump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)
My diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)
Stay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)

[Verse 4: 88 Camino]
How you let a lame fuck for free?
When's the last, you can't even see what's up with me (me)
Off the acid drop, you know what's up with me (me)
Got a name from the game, it wasn't cheap
Pockets so fat, I used to stash it inside of that gas tank
Goyard bag, fill it with cash, givin' me back pain (skrrt, skrrt)
Groupies on call, wanna be all part of my campaign
Bitches, they all changed up soon as those racks came
Vampire drip like Dracula (Dracula)
Saint Laurent on my clothes (Dracula)
My life is spectacular ('tacular)
My bitches doin' the most (doin' the most)
Throw ones, watch 'em rack it up (rack it up)
Dollar bills stuck to her toes (stuck to her toes)
Hit, I make it look easy (easy), the triple double in the post (easy)

[Chorus: NAV]
Look at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)
Jump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)
My diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)
Stay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)
Look at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)
Jump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)
My diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)
Stay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)
