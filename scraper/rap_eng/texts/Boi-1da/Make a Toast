[Verse 1]
Yeah, five in the morning
Eighty cash, meet the plug with the .40 on me
I turn the paper into birds call it origami
Fuck a wave, I'm the whole tsunami
Armani on my body like I know the Gottis
8 o'clock in the evening I ain't even ate
Two-liter, fuck a 4, pour an even eight
Tryna keep the faith, sleeping late, but I always deviate
From the love, players club no Lisa Raye
Too up to need a loan, so I sleep alone
It's steaks for all my dogs to each his own
The type of shit I'm on think I need cologne
To any city I roam, they screaming Caeser's home
I signed a deal off a heartbreak
I was stuck between a rock and a hard place
Now I'm in the Barclays, drinking all of Hov's Chardonnay
Writing bars, in my desperado guitar case
Let's make a toast

[Chorus]
Toast, yeah
Make a toast
Make a toast, yeah
Let's make a toast
Make a toast, yeah
Make a toast, yeah
Don't matter what you popping baby, just pop something
Make a toast

[Verse 2]
Hell is hot and only heaven knows
I never sweat, you on forever cold
If you ain't getting paper, hope you taking notes
Fuck bread, made a loaf, now let's make a toast
Ok, it really means nothing if you make it close
I made my own lane, that's my favorite road
I had to bend the rules just to break the code
I dug myself up out this hole, that's what made me whole
Rolling woods, down in Hollywood, where they pay for souls
Pay in gold, for this label clothes and these major roles
Woah, if I don't who gon break the mold
No, I swear the paper never made me fold
I disappear in a breath of smoke
Your whole career need a stethoscope
That new album needed life support
Bitch, you won the battle, couldn't fight the war
Been a week I've been coming down
Maybachs just to run around
They mad I'm styling when I come around
Shoutout to Pun I'm trying to live, I lost a hundred pounds

[Interludes]
I just lost a hundred pounds, I'm tryna live

[Chorus]
Ma-make a toast, yeah
Let's make a toast
Make a toast
Make a toast, yeah
I mean, we can make a toast to that
Let's make a toast
Make a toast, yeah
Make a toast
Rest in peace Big Pun, Big L, B.I.G
Make a toast

[Verse 3]
Getting caught up with religious bands
I guess I'll never see my distant fam or my foreign bitch again
(Switching hands) In the kitchen, hurt my wrist again
(different plan), watched my pops become a different man
I turn a snowflake to an avalanche
I went and made a milli' from a milligram
Hidden hands, Ashley Graham's out the caravan
No more sharing rooms at the Sheraton
Game filthy, tried to kill me for a kilogram
Wave healthy, couldn't stop it if you build a dam
Mattress on the floor I was staring at the ceiling fan
Almost died for this shit, and I'm still a fan
The flow cardiac arrest, why kill em
I could give them heart attacks for less
Oh yeah, please pardon my success
Yall ain't even sick you hypochondriacs at best
Insomniac is prolly from molly that I ingest
Out of breath like I got a Pontiac on my chest
Cognac on my breath, falling back to prometh'
No wonder why you never even called back or just text
I get the message tho, run game so professional
Unfazed on your pedestal
One day never came, someday I'ma let it go
Another day another decimal
Day ones, never tell, Sundays no confessional
Unchanged in my messy clothes
I'm forever cold, hell is hot and only heaven knows
Fuck bread, made a loaf, now let's make a toast

[Chorus]
Toast, yeah
Make a toast
Make a toast, yeah
Make a toast, yeah
Make a toast
Make a toast

[Outro]
Yeah, all of this shit so exaggerated
I mean her ass fat but its saturated
And now my third eye has been activated
This shit ain't really rap related
They couldn't understand so I spoke it clearer
Getting high to reflect, that shit is smoke and mirrors
Wait, just being honest with myself
I'm still doing this shit 'cause I made a promise to myself
That's real
