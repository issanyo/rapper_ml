Was the 3rd grade
Or maybe it was the 5th grade
When I figured
How to get paid
Better watch
What you say
Ig pay
Atin lay
Itch bay
Listen to ya insay
Man
If You gon play
Then earn lay
When and not to alk Tay
You can get
Halked cay
Started me a beef
EatIn Spanish pork
Don't really like the meat
But I love the sport
Since you forgot see
Let me retort
& for this black peace
We designed some forts
And ran a line
From the porch
To let niggas dry
You can die from the force
On Sunday's
Sunrays
Over shadow
Gunplay
Running
Into Andre
One big giant
Who's
Egos definant
In a headlock
Now he's compliant
Done with supplying
Words to opps
Now he's silence
Proceed to the top
When you arrive
Tell em bobby sent cha
Boo gang representer
Cold like Chicago
Winter
Bang Five God
Cause it's in us
(Hello)

Can't hear me
After this year
Bet yall fear me
I bet yall tell me
Ya checked out my latest
Then Blame it on my greatness
