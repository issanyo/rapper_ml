[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Acting like you need me, I guess you changed your mind
Girl I caught you sleeping, now you got your eyes real wide
Got your legs up in the ceiling , we found a different high
Now you acting like you're feining

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Oh you know now baby
You know I found your favourite spot, know I hit in on the dot
Oh you know now baby
Just like I'm working on the clock, you know I hit it on the dot

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Girl I knew from the beginning (it was long gone now)
Get it once and that's the ending (no more, no more chasing you 'round)
Cause I remember in the summer (it was a different game)
Now you wanna be my lover, baby

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Oh you know now baby
You know I found your favourite spot, know I hit in on the dot
Oh you know now baby
Just like I'm working on the clock, you know I hit it on the dot

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Shawty hit it on the dot, she an infrared bone
Come out the blue with the red on
Put the Beats on you like the headphones
You still make me wanna head home
Used to run into you head on
Tried to live right but you dead wrong
Saying I'm close like that red zone
You know I hit that shit dead on, go 'head and get your regret on, gon'

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Girl I know, I know you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I hope, I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Girl I know, I know you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Girl I know, I know you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I hope, I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Girl I know, I know you gon' miss me when I'm gone

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Oh you know now baby
You know I found your favourite spot, know I hit in on the dot
Oh you know now baby
Just like I'm working on the clock, you know I hit it on the dot
