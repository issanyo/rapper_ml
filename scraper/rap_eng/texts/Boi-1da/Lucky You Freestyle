[Chorus]
I’ve been tryina get this money flip this cash and paper
We’ve just been elevating above you bloody haters
Wrighty be on different shit I’ll buck you pussies later
We be on that straight and narrow destined for the greatness
Greatness!

[Verse]

I be that level they wish they were on
Watch me just burry this song
It’s nothing long
Riding the beat like a thong
You know what Wrighty be on
I be on next shit
Yeah the flow sick
Wrighty’s dumb cold
Every bars lit
Every verse writ
I know you felt it
You can’t rub me out like a felt tip
Like nah brudda nah
Tryna be the next super star
I'm about to take this shit so far
Operating like a computer
Facts every time I rhyme
Killing these tracks
Number one spot
Got to get it back
No discrimination allohwthat
I don’t really care coz I’m lyrics sound fat
Every time I spit on the mic you know I’m repping it right you know I get the crowd lively bro
You can act like the Wrighty’s not on the next level with the bars, you can even fight me bro
Check the resume yeah it’s all legit
Can’t really help that I’m born to spit
Wrighty’s back with a banging track
I come every week you can’t handle that
It’s all gravy baby
With the flows they’re ghost
I’m like Patrick Swayze
No chip on my shoulder oppsi daisy
BBk like lazy
Give me my flowers while I’m alive
Inter-flora my them daisies before I go crazy
I do this for my babies
Tianna, Lucas and River  all be winners
Your daddy will just keep on working coz success is certain
I don’t care what the others say
You was once hot but not today
Your bars are sweet like a hot soufflé
I’m bringing the heat I’m not to play with

[Chorus]

Get this money Flip this cash and paper
We’ve just been elevating above you bloody haters
Wrighty be on different shit I’ll buck you pussies later
We be on that straight and narrow destined for the greatness
Greatness!
