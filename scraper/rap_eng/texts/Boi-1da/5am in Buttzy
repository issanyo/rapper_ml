(Feltz)

Okay your see me burning the kush
Got that of yogi it came in a bush
But I'm on some different shit
Cos I'm smoking on every puff

5am fuck it its a shut down
Now everyone noes about my town
We be grinding to find the right pound
People out ere ain't got beds they can't lie down

What do you know about my pain?
Only got one pic of me smiling in a picture frame
My dad he hopped on the plane
Thinking when will i see his face?

Sitting here knowing I'm only getting older
So me i got to be a soldier
Cos theres a lot of weight on my shoulders
That shit heavy like boulders

And along with that is this stress
I swear gods putting me to the test
I need to get shit of my chest
Im not stopping till they say I'm the best

If you hate on me thats fine
Cos your be hating on my grind
Lets hear you on the mic
See if you really got the dynamite

Bitch pussy your be stunting
But i got your boys on a trunk ting
And i got your bitches bumping
Cos they all got my music pumping

Who said i wouldn't well?
So now ima shout out be-real
Cos we in the hood we know the deal
Ill rather pop a pussy then pop a pill

5am and none of us are snoring
Instead were weighing zeds while were yawning
Talking about when were gunna be balling
I'm on my a game thats laurence talking

Thinking if the dj's will play me?
Talking to bailey why she's sipping baileys
I hear the money talk i tell it pay me
I tell that everyday till the money slays me

All your see is me smoking the puffy
I don't drink i won't feel squiffy
I'm out here chasing the lizzy
No time off i keep it busy

I keep it bust cos i love my work
Smoking a zoot why she twerks
Sleep when I'm rich: word
Everyone noes that we swir

And you might see me pop a bottle
Don't mean I'm drinking with these models
Im tryna see my money double
Legit tryna stay out of trouble

But i think that, I'm stuck in the trap
Till i that, i got the tight cash
To start having the game on smash
P m w is all i add

Is you don't know what it is g
Thats pussy, money and weed
Waiting for the day my dons freed
Then were gunna muddafucking party

5am and I'm not even thinking of going bed
All I'm think of is making that shed
But thats just the filling pass me the bread
84 grams like Z Z Z
