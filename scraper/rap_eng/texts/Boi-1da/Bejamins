[Intro]
It's all about the Bejamins, baby
These lames ain't fuckin' with the Flame
Degrees!

[Verse 1]
Everyday, I pray to the most high
I need to be a millionaire, I'm talking' multi
I, be the one in the big body
And my bitch, she got a banging' body, she don't even do pilates
Lean, baby, rollin'
Money stackin', bitches asking' "do you know him?"
Well bitch, you better act like you heard of me
Let's get this money, only worried about my currency, flexin' like I'm Hercules
Finesse dresser, down to my underclothes
Been ballin' before the rap, like Demar DeRoz
See this ice on my neck? My jeweller got me froze
Just take a picture, watch me do my pose
No need for choosin', that bitch she already chose
Been in these streets, came up off of sellin' O's
Ain't bout no Benjis? Ain't nobody got time for that
Point me to where the dollas at, until then, nigga, holla back

[Hook]
It's all about the Bejamins, baby
It's all about the Bejamins, baby
It's all about the Bejamins, baby
It's all about the Bejamins, baby
It's all about the Bejamins, baby
It's all about the Bejamins, baby
It's all about the Bejamins, baby
It's all about the Bejamins, baby

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Is you suckin' dick or not? It's just a question
And if not, today's your lucky day, bitch, come get these lessons
When I cum, it's like a blessin'
So you should get down on your knees and you should catch it
All that money that you showin' I could throw it
All that money that you holdin' I could blow it
Nigga, everything you rentin' I could own it
Including your bitch, I been cleanin' out her colon
Picture me rollin', pockets swollen
Big young poker face, I'm never folding' (make 'em hold it)
Fly nigga, they all want the recipe
But to be as fresh as me, that's just a never be (never!)
They think that it might rub off if they get next me to (however!)
But this gun might go off if you get next to me (Beretta!)
All I do is get it, that's my specialty
Still money over bitches, especially

[Hook]

It's all about the Bejamins, baby
