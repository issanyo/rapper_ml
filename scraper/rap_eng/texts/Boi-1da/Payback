[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, It's 10 O'Clock on a Wednesday and I know your home (Know your home)
Driving up and down your street hoping you that come outside (Come outside)
Cause I just got paid and I'm winning bout to call you on it (Call you on it)
And I just need you to see me, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Charlie says it seems that will make it all better (Better)
Selfish says it is, this just ain’t bout you, no (bout you, no)
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
So that’s why, I’m gonna stunt on you
I’m gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could have made it all on my own
