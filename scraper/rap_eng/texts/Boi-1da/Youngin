[Intro: Huey Freeman]
Vision?
What do you know about my vision?
My vision would turn your world upside-down
Tear asunder your illusions
And send the sanctuary of your own ignorance crashing down around you
Now ask yourself.. are you really ready to see that vision?

[Verse: DJ]

King DJ you feel me, ugh

Working from 8 to 8 straight
Can't get no break there's no brakes
No choice but to stay awake
I used to await the day
Day that I could brake the bank
Whenever I ate I made sure that I scrapped the plate
Adidas and bathing ape
Had that on layaway
Had that snapback just to match with my crazy eights
Had to hit licks on the strip we was flipping stains
Attack and bring the pain, tax everyone till were paid
But those was the crazy days now we don't play these games
Nike box stash I got stacks for the rainy days
Some extra cash in my mattress to play it safe
When shit don't add up subtract yourself, fade away
And don't show off for no one just stay in your lane
Might've just made a case
All cause you ain't put that thing away
Headed to the top and they swear I won't make it
But I'm so focussed all I need is patience
Don't listen to them because they are hating
All I do is win and then win, they can't take it
Oh thats your girl she told me she ain't taken
Your pockets vacant, mine are populated
Nigga I am too real and they cannot take it
But I'm aware of the snakes they can't fake it
Police too impatient
Why don't I feel safe it's a whole nother race
When the one time is chasing after you like franklin
Approach you like satan now your heart is racing
They don't got no patience
Drag you to the pavement now back to the station
Don't make a statement if they get frustrated
They aim it and bang it with no hesitation
On Worldstar we tape it but that do not change shit
Screenshot and repost it
We copy and paste it
Protest we posted
Authorities faded
One thing I've noticed is no one has changed it
Until something changes minorities wasted
You will never know the struggle till you taste it
Life is a game and I'm not one to play with
Gotta turn back to the basics
If I ever get stuck in a situation
I don't believe in luck if i lost its a lesson
Kick my feet up, way up like I'm stretching
Nigga I'm true, better not forget it
Before I count my money know I gotta count my blessings
Easy
