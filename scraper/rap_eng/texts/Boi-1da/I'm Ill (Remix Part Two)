(RAH!!!! RAH!!!!)

[Verse One: Red Cafe]
Iller than your hubby or your ex
I just need the back seat of a Beamer or a Lex
Whenever it get wet, just hit me on the text
And then I'm goin in, hickies on your neck
(WHAT ELSE!) I'm ill, live from the psych ward
Run from me and I'll catch ya like Ty Law
Sixty eight and I'm a owe you one
Young Tiger Woods tryin to get a hole in one
I be needin the baddest chick
With the meanest walk rockin the flyest shit
Lookin live as hell, E or YSL
You a cowgirl that's right ride it well
Vivica, Zoey, Gabrielle Union
Anyone of y'all might have a nigga spoonin
Neck soaked I'm the new Ricky Ruler
Call me Franck White, Franck Lucas, Frank Mueller

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
I'm pass on emergency cause it has been a murder
New designer bodybags, come near me I will burn ya
Better keep your distance, you ain't heard? Oh, I get ill!
Still shiny, real grimey, still sound like 90 mil
I'm ballin so these bitches wanna do me
My life is like a movie, call me Rolie Gucci Louie
Rock the carots usually, girl, the platinum diamond rubies
Some men always 'round the coochie, girl I love those like an uzi!!!
Smoothly copped and can't wait to flaunt it
That new Beem, blue jean with the Hs' on it
Stacks on my sweater, come getcha makeup on it
Let's make a porno, part one and two, watch the paper pour in
Soon as they cut the beat on I go ape all on it
My life is one big show, whole day performin
Night to mornin, I be gettin high scorin
If a nigga run up on 'em, let the thing spat up on 'em like...

[Verse Three: Red Cafe]
Iller than LeBron on a fast break
Iller than Horatio on his last case
Look in the sky, nigga LIVE in that place
If they try to run with R, I'm leavin them in last place (HUH!)
Thuggin in the club, the top off my bottle
Dippin in the spur, the top off my model
I feel like I win in EVERY thing except lotto
Got a dollar and a dream so I still play a lotto
I'm ill - ill like Jiggaman on the hook
Back when I was re'in up, I was the man, I was the cook
Turnin one into three, now I'm runnin in three
R&B chicks, who wouldn't wanna be me?
I'm ILL!!
