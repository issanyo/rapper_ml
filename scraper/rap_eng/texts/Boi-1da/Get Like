[Intro]
The only person in the whole world—ever? Ever?

[Verse 1]
I don't like when I catch them out the corner
Of their, of their eyes, look all hypnotized
I don't mind when I catch you
Stare me all the way down to my thighs
Makes me realize

[Pre-Chorus]
That I'm shy and just a little awkward
But you bring it out of me, out of me cause—

[Chorus]
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)
Ain't nobody else make me feel like
You're the only one that I feel like
(Feel like this for)
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)

[Verse 2]
I confess, after we get down we always leave a mess
Don't wanna get dressed
We get loud, don't think anyone can make me make a sound
Know that make you proud

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I'm shy and just a little awkward
But you bring it out of me, out of me cause—

[Chorus]
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)
Ain't nobody else make me feel like
You're the only one that I feel like
(Feel like this for)
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)

[Bridge]
All you, all yours, it's yours, it's yours (It's yours)
All you, all yours, I'm sure, it's yours (It's yours)
All you, all yours, it's yours, it's yours (It's yours)
All you, all yours, I'm sure, it's yours (It's yours)

[Chorus]
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)
Ain't nobody else make me feel like
You're the only one that I feel like
(Feel like this for)
You're the only one that I get like
You're the only one that I get like
(Get like this for)
