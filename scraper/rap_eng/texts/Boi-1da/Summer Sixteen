I know that shoulders be turning when I come on, yeah
Turn back the dial but I know it was my song, yeah
I’m mixing a track, so don’t bother to call
Got a dent in my skull from my phones, but I keep ‘em on

Yeah
This is that motivation
The most lyrical fixation
I flex through my beats
But I know I got to catch up for real when it comes to engagement

If I got something to say well
You know I typically save it
But now I be spilling my guts, and I’m cutting my heart, put it up on the table

Take a look at the game’s embers
Trying to find the key with a metal detector
Hip-hop’s a haystack of last straws
I’m picking the needle like a vinyl collector

Give weight to my message
If I give direction
To summon the chills
All you need is a lyrical vector

She said
“I got to show you my collection
Made up of the top 100 records
Why you got to be a judge of this, boy?”
I said, “naw I’m like a sewage inspector”

Come and join me on the precipice
Let’s take a leap, and spread ours wings
Trace back the trends to the genesis
See the rise and fall like Daedalus

I don’t see the light in rap no more
My eyes got vantablack cores
Not from the night
Not from the hood
Just know that’s word
To Anish Kapoor

I would like to move to start fresh...
Will you second the motion, my friend?
All in favor say "aye"
If you wish to see the story begin
