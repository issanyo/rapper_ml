[Hook]
Whose house is this? Money out the … can’t count that shit
Stacking death prez, mouth to mouth that shit
When they said a nigga wouldn't amount to shit
Now whose house is this? Laughing so hard my tongue is out and shit
Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch

[Verse 1: Slim The Mobster]
Broadcasting live from south central Los Angeles
Where the babies born scandalous
The street I keep my hand in it
The gun I keep my hand on it
Niggas is going to need bandages
If I brandish it ambulances, the chance you make it slim nigga
I’m good in the hood cause I motivated them niggas
I graduated from dumb hoes and mault liquor
To expensive wine and dime bitches
Red lining the DB9 like it’s my time pimping
Audemar [?] quality time spending
And you niggas is borderline bitches
That’s my opinion
And my niggas is ride or die Aftermath my religion
Talk out but I don’t listen
Act out and come up missing
That click clack pow did it
Like Colin Powell did it
And I’m so west coast, ok corral with it
My new foreign car can't pronounce that shit
You fuck around…count that shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Broadcasting live from Compton California where foreigners never come
Mothers are worrisome and we dislike the governor
I hope these angels can cover us
If the LAPD ain’t doing it then it was a cover up
Coroners about to cover up everybody
I’m serious, every shotty is saw'd off
And every nigga is militant
And your gut like...What?
EBT Cards, no credit can't ease cards
All my life beed OG aw now my life on the billboard soon
Give me room, I react like a wildebeest and
Throw salt inside your wound your just diabetes to me
Ain't shit sweet with these hotels homie
That crip shit got my uncle’s life in jail ho
So if I put the same line, they'll never forgive me
Or worse than that the niggas right around the corner might kill me
I’m fighting back when it’s hard what
No barber my guards up, the author of fallen fathers that did it without much, this my house nigga
