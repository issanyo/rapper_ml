[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Let me give you one to grow on
Me and you have been digging each other now for so long
Like an archaeologist looking for our bones
We used to do it to the slow songs
Then our hormones would mix up from the sweat
Cause I feel it drip drop from my pecs to your chest
I send a text from the jet, just to get you slippery
Memories of you soaking wet
That's the only time I might slip
Then I slide between them thighs, she keeps it tight-lipped
Like a vice grip, it's so private
Mum's the word unless I'm knee deep inside it
Three's company not crowded, I get
Cake, eat it too and apple pie
Slices with the ice cream, icing, à la mode
She inspires and excites me now you know

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you

[Verse 2: André 3000]
(On some cool shit)
Well here's a revolutionary idea
Why don't we both stay home and if the doorbell goes ding-dong
We can act like we not here
Put them house coats on and take them right back off
As a result, like we work at Ikea
Test every piece of furniture to see if it is stable
You wanna take it out on me then do it on the table
Mmm! Blow to the head, it's fatal
Wait til, you get a load of me
I ain't joking, Dark Knight, Batman
And I'm poking that pussy-cat, woman
Poke-it-man, baby gon' push it back on me
Hoping that maybe you'll wake up in the morning
And forget about it all, I hate to see you sad
So if anybody call, tell em that you'll let em know
When we fall back to earth, go berserk, baby

[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]
(I've been looking for you)
Come on in, I've been looking for you
Baby, where you been? (Where you been?)
No more wasting time, let's gone and get it in, get it in
And I won't stop, don't stop, 'til I make that leg drop

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yeah, they wanna follow in my footsteps
But I'mma go something like the Boogie Man, never forget that
You musta fell down and bumped your cranium
Been moving crowds, rock halls and stadiums
Maybe I'm one of the best you'll ever meet
The Greatest Show On Earth, B.I.G
And I'mma make you remember me
I stay colder than December, B
Mr. Freeze, only want to see her on her knees
Throat pregnancies, are at a all time high, keep it sci-fi, wi-fi
Always connected to muchacha, watch out bwoy
The time flies by as the Cadillac glides
It's the Return of the Jedi, niggas know better
Antwan and André together
Dungeon Family for the W, I-N
Like Khaled, all we do is win, win

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you

[Verse 4: André 3000]
I-I-I be on it, in and out it, in and out it
In and out it, in and out it, went about it
Like I owned it, dog it
Gone it, dog and pony show
Said my name repeatedly, repeated me
Like Tony Toni Toné, Tony, Tony
I know, I know, I know I said two too many Tony's
I go, I go, I go, I’m not usually a morning
Person, but certain skirts can makes me
Pull back the curtain and let the sun burst in
She searching for her Ken, Barbie
Her skin makes my Berlin Wall fall down
To the ground, now touché, hardly
A one night stand, number on nightstand
She ain’t gon’ never leave me hanging like an old white man
But she don’t understand that I’m a fan of Steely Dan
And she like everything that’s on the radio and I demand she change it
