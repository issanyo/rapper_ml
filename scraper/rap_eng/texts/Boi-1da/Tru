[Intro]
I lost it all, my friends, my loved ones
But in life there's always a chance to grow
From the struggle, from the pain, from the realness
Here's my story, Lloyd

[Verse 1]
Hey world, yeah I know it's been a while
Thought I'd come around to let you know what's up now
No album lately so my mind is kinda up-down
I still been taking care my mama and them somehow
Disappeared from the scene and left my old team
Had to find a new approach to an old dream
And it's not to take a shot at my old team
I just want you to see

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true

[Verse 2]
Apologies if I ever let you down
But so much shit done happen that it's hard to talk about
So many lawsuits that my lawyer said don't talk about it
Just had to breathe, keep it cool 'til I can walk up out it
Came home helped my sister raise a child
Kinda hurt me cause I could of had my own now
Lost my baby damn it's really hitting home now
I just had to learn

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true

[Bridge]
I look up to the sky, Lord why do I cry
When no one is looking, is the blame for this pain
Even caused by the shame of this fame I've been given
My pride don't cause me to hide my true feelings
Cause I can only be real
Cause I can only be real

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true
Alright, alright
And all I wanna be is true
Alright
And all I wanna be is true
And all I wanna be is true
Alright
And all I wanna be is true
