[Intro: SwankMasterRaw]
Good God almighty, Pro-Era has come
To bless you with another beautiful,beautiful,beautiful track
You got a slacker, you got a dirtbag, you got a cautionary guy
But fuck with it though, on some shit
We bout to kill the game
We comin' for yo life, and we comin' for yo wife
But im just sayin', It's a Pro-Era thing bruh
BEASTCOAST
All that other shit, here today, gone tomorrow bruh

[Verse 1: Dirty Sanchez]
Yeah, Fuck it
Im in outer space right now
Can you feel it?
Cause I can feel it
My track-list heavy metal like blacksmith
Black sabbath, Black list, like Capone
Frontin' like I don't drop dope quotes
I'm back at it, liquor, weed, dope music
I'm a party alone
Leavin' rappers so shook
& the richter scale broke
Build tracks like a railroad
Get bent like an elbow
In rain, sleet, hail, snow
Made my heart grow cold so
Don't get me mad, because you got no hands
Tick tock, get clocked on time
We the cream and the beans of the crop
Who co-sign? Fuck the industry
They fishes in the pail, they ain't great whites they pale
Aligned seven chakaras, I'm enlightened
Something light righteous, that's right like this
Free your mind, I rewind you toys
Paint pictures like rap legends
Your plans unfoiled
Filling bitches with a bundle a joy
You got a seed-filled spliff
Plus you babysittin' the pot boy, let it boil
A lot of jays, I'm still crushing my grapes
Real recognize real, not real recognize fake
Not on BET yet, your best bet is the basement
Case closed dismissed, we underground and there's levels to this shit
Wait, wait, there's no competition
But still I ain't got no pot to piss in
I'm baked, baked, pound cake break it down
Till my whole town ate, hate
It's Dirty

[Verse 2: Dyemond Lewis]
Man fuck y'all, I meditate
It's too easy to be depressed
Slackas fill up ya playlist
Just play this n feel ya chest
Cause if we don't fulfill ya needs
Then our pockets would never stretch like
Mr.Fantastic, classic, not your average
Make em sound irrelevant like Schoolboy's ad-libs
I'll take you on a journey let me know if your for it
Pull the potent, ain't no joking man, got me feelin' euphoric
I rather be broke than dreaming
Than to be broke and scheming
Than to be broke and hope for a quick fix to feed him
Bad habits lust demons baby, suck it like maggie
I know crackers hitting the doobie just don't end up like Shaggy
My 90s niggas know, it's grimy where I'm from
Ask 'em on the killer rhyme
Probably still flip the boards if it wasn't for all the rhyming
They'll call me the rhyming diamond, Dyemond be rhyming
But I ain't eating like ramadaning
Eyeing the mic the food on your plate looks rather inviting
Stop it before you know it bitch, see I'll be dining
On your breakfast, lunch, and dinner
Take your spot, next stop the top and I put that on la familia
It's the motherfucking super duper slackas get familiar
Coming live we the illest niggas swankin' in the Era

[Verse 3: Nyck Caution]
To keep it a 100 I beat when I want it
Other than that, bitch, we ain't speaking in public
The Ceasar republic, the reason I does it for the heart of it
Fuck yourself you narcissist, that's softer than some cartilage
I spit it out my damn mind, till the [shit my man's time],I'm fly like an airline
Part of me just bother with anomalies, and how to get it started
When you from the bottom, since the day my father popped a condom
Back up on my diesel flow, stealth this is eagle mode
Women thirst is lurkin' on me swallow up the leader ho
Dealt with the serpents now my grass cut
Felt fuckin' worthless now my cash up
Punch you like a brass knuck
Mami getting anal get yo ass fucked
Then drop it hot like a potato leave you mashed up
Yeah, classic when I touch I let it perish
You like Robert Parish just a zero to that basket
I'm a hero in this modern era, possum never
But it's possible I'm dwelling by the trees feeling heavenly
I been word-playing since the spelling bee, shit is effortless
Caution been had bars like a felon sheet
Man, and you know this man
