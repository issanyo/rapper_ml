[Verse 1]
It was all a dream
I use to read The Source magazine
In my eyes those guys were more than human beings
Whole lot of cream not a worry in the world
Hurry coat furry and  flurry of them girls
No doubt
One day I’ll be on that route
A fly spouse and a big ass house
Get the clothes for free, put the cheese towards groceries
Lookin’ fresh like yes, and they know its me
Hopefully, the queens want a stroke from me
I put the game where it’s suppose to be
Back on the map
With the fact, kickin’ rap
We ain’t all into trap
If somebody get clapped
Then they prolly black
We gotta stop that
Livin’ in the booth block out wack
There’s bigger things, [?] respect
As a youngin’ couldn’t wait for my chance to flex
Illest lines in the lines knew I’de be up next

Getting’ dough like Oprah
Hangin’ on your poster
World wide shows
Spend 0’s with my bros
Just dreaming, I'm just dreaming
Getting’ dough like Oprah
Hangin’ on your poster
World wide shows
Spend 0’s with my bros
Just dreaming, I'm just dreaming

[Verse 2]
It’s still all a dream, I see myself in magazines
Break up to make up with shorties that can pose in Maybelline
BK nigga got a slice of the pie
Rep for all my dreamers from Flatbush to bed-stuy
Now I’m, all to cool in articles
My arsenal turned haters to particles
Departed those
Blocks that I spent my whole life on
I been getting offers since I turned the mic on
Started of light, now my instagram likes on
The grip like pythons
Please don’t turn the lights on
Sleep has been, very very good to me
And everything I do I do it for the hood to see
To show ‘em that it’s possible
I hop obstacles
Like I hop fences
Lookin’ at Benzes
Thinkin’ one day that’s gone be mine
Now I got the connects, they ain't had to find
See everybody gotta dream some choose igsnore
But open up your eyes yo the world is yours
Everybody got a dream some G’s took a fall
And now they live their dreams through the Brooklyn [?]

Getting’ dough like Oprah
Hangin’ on your poster
World wide shows
Spend 0’s with my bros
Just dreaming, I'm just dreaming
Getting’ dough like Oprah
Hangin’ on your poster
World wide shows
Spend 0’s with my bros
Just dreaming, I'm just dreaming
