[Verse 1]
I know that I should leave
But I'm selfish
Sometimes I change my mind
I just can't help it
I do believe
That we got something special
Really do believe
That we got something special
I tell myself I'll change
I know I'm lying
Just need for you
To see the silver lining
I know I made mistakes
Don't need reminding
I think that we just met
At perfect timing

[Pre-Hook]
I know that I should leave
Yea yea yea yea
I know that I'm a G
Yea yea yea yea
I know that I ain't right
Yea yea yea yea
I know I'm selling lies
Yea yea yea yea

[Hook]
But girl I want you to understand my heart
Do you understand me?
I just want you to understand my heart
Do you understand me?

[Verse 2]
I know that I should leave
But I'm selfish
Sometimes I change my mind
I just can't help it
I do believe
That we got something special
Really do believe
That we got something special
I tell you I'll be different
But I'm lying
I'm asking you
To see the silver lining
I know I made mistakes
Don't need reminding
I think that we just met
At perfect timing

[Pre-Hook] x2
I know that I should leave
Yea yea yea yea
I know that I'm a G
Yea yea yea yea
I know that I ain't right
Yea yea yea yea
I know I'm selling lies
Yea yea yea yea

[Hook]
But girl I want you to understand my heart
Do you understand me?
I just want you to understand my heart
Do you understand me?

[Outro]
Ima take my time
My time, my time
(understand me?)
My time
My time
I just want you to understand my heart
Said I just want you to understand my heart
