[Verse 1]
You knew something was scandalous
You told me you could handle it
If I told you everything
You wouldn’t believe me
It’s someone that you met before
You shook his hand at the door
It was last 4th of July when we got into that big fight
You seemed more concerned with the girls by the pool
He held my conversation, something you don’t do
You left me vulnerable; so irresponsible
Why are you confused?

[Chorus]
If you could handle the truth I'd never lie to you
If you did what you’re supposed to do I’d still be with you
You’re so busy loving yourself
There’s no room for anyone else
(But the truth is)
If you could handle the truth I’d never
I would never lie never lie never lie
But you don’t even try even try even try
I hate lying to you but you can’t handle the truth
I would never lie never lie never lie
But you don’t even try even try even try
I hate lying to you but you can’t handle the truth

[Verse 2]
I’m so fucking mad at you
Look at what you made me do
You turned a good girl so bad and it’s all your fault
But you couldn’t give a little love
Your affection would have been enough
But now I’m the one up in the club and I’m leaving my phone off
Which brings me back to that day by the pool
He invited me out something you used to do
Wanted to tell you but deep down I knew
Your ego’s so big that it might leave you bruised

[Chorus]
If you could handle the truth Id never lie to you
If you did what you’re supposed to do I’d still be with you
You’re so busy loving yourself there’s no room for anyone else (but the truth is)
If you could handle the truth I’d never
I would never lie never lie never lie
But you don’t even try even try even try
I hate lying to you but you can’t handle the truth
I would never lie never lie never lie
But you don’t even try even try even try
I hate lying to you but you can’t handle the truth
