[Verse 1]
I had a premonition of some epiphany shit
Thinking bout my past I was reminiscing and shit
Images vivid as shit
All I saw was my moms
I had to dip cause I was too scared to live with that shit
Now I'm focused on the life ahead of me
Rap heavily
Only kill a beat if the track is a fat melody
Never selling crack I'd rather chop celery
And chef the game up and work for that longevity
Cheese, paper, green, don't matter it's all bread to me
Not amount of it can turn me into a better me
I'm thankful to the homies who know me and all bled for me
And to the snake homies who fake you're all dead to me
Let me summarize I'm cutting ties
You biting lines and glutton eyes
You wonder why I put in work while I'm working to cure my family from this curse
That's stripping us from insanity god damnit I'm back
Spittin facts on the simplest tracks
Fuck reading a book I'd rather speak to a class
And teach them all how to rap
And make an impact on someone's life
To show my mom that I didn't live for the cash
But really

[Verse 2]
As I open up my third eye
You can see my whole entire world from a birds eye view
I'm hurt by a few
And dependent on the words I choose
I could kill you with a rhyme or a word my dudes
And find you come up behind you with a silence on a 45
Pull the trigger leave your whole crew mortified
You can't kill a man if he was born a mort of lies
Borderline pushing out a smorgasbords of rhymes
Try to fortify your minds while you're snorting lines
With a page from the bibles sins come in different kinds
All I ever wondered was why everyone dies
Its probably for these reasons
Drugs, killers, and crimes shit
Now I try to think about it
Maybe life is hell and we never think about it
Pushing out our struggles to end up in a better place
Have you ever considered it yeah I doubt it
