[Verse 1: Phil Ade]
Yeah I keep hearing who is he, who is he
In that Gucci and Louie V. with his Nikes so nicely undone
And under his newly jeans
Who you hear on the radio
????
Where it appears I'm way below
Where I should that Jay Z though
Don't allow it phase me though
I know nothing is handed but man I planning to take it
But though I don’t ask demand it
We live on two different planets
My date too stupid to plan it
I ain't got time for relationships we tell Cupid to can it
In the club taking Candids with bitches better than Janet
Reppin hard for that royal fam and the land of the mary
And you should passing a lot around now my eyes look satanic
I’m on the tree like a hammock
Please don’t judge me by my habits
This prodigy causing havoc
But I’m ain't deep in the mind
The crowd please tell me who have it
Because I’m leaving them robbed
Disrespect and get touch and I won’t be even involved
Don't say I’m sleeping with you girl cause we ain't sleeping at all
I can release her from your lock cause I got it like that
But she see me getting guap no telling how she might act
But I just want what's in that box and then you got it right back
Cause homie I ain’t with that talk unless I’m where I mic at
Aahhhh
Don’t do it, please don’t do it
All my niggas is real and you looking non Jewish
Made a list of my dues that im about finished payin'
Now take a look at the shoes you dudes couldn’t spend a day in
I know

[Bridge]
Man, let me catch my breath
Ok I’m good

[Verse 2: Phil Ade]
I got niggas depending on me like when you gonna get it homie
These niggas is fiendish, phony and soon to be seating lonely
How fresh are we SRT with the 24 sitting on these
You think that your girl a Saint well I think she gon' SuperDome me
Straight Nikes no supras on me
These dropped on the super low key
My tee, I got two for no fee
My cell phone be super OD
It's hard to decipher whose real when everyone is tryin to chill
Tryin to get something about you
And randomly thinking about you
So I just ignore all them texts
Focused in more on them checks
Catch me down town on that brown like Rihanna’s ex
Spillin henny all over my RLX
‘cause the music more rocking like ..
Not congressional but rep for my state
Nigga Your career dont compare to the rest of my tape
And when I step on stage I bet I kill whoever headlines
And if its me then apparently I met my deadline

[Outro]
I got certain goals I want to reach in life
I won’t do it in a certain matter of time
So basically is over for you
Time’s up
Deadlines
