[Intro: Big Tobz]
I swear im just doing this for fun man
I got the whole of Waltham Forest fucking with me now

[Hook]
You know how that should go (x3)
Runnin' through 1-7 with my bros
You know how that should go (x3)
Runnin' through the forest with my bros
You know how that should go (x3)
Runnin' through 1-7 with my bros
You know how that should go (x3)
(Runnin' through 1-7)

[Verse 1: Big Tobz]
I was whizzing thru 1-7 with my bros
Top down in the December in the cold
If its money nigga tell him im involved
Niggas snitching they remembering the code
1-7 1-7 1-7
Got niggas in E10 and E11
E5, E6, E8, E9, E14-15 G im east side reppin'
Fuck your new swag G, I rep my own garms
Have to switch up my ride cuh i got a known car
I make news, don't speak too much, I dont talk
Niggas fallin for these hoes you can't [?] dwag
Im in Spain eaze out on the beach
Im Big Tobz whats a mouse to a beast
You want one, i got a thousand of these
East 1-7 whizzing round with my Gs
Same time still looking out for the D
Still on my grind got me losing hours of my sleep
Still the king man tryna take the crown off of me
I take flights, probably get a town for a week
On the M11 listening to Nipsey (Hussle)
Them man are young
Im sick of all these pickney
On the high road doing 60
I told my ex just link me when you miss me
Fuck a rap nigga I dont need a feature
And im a boss nigga, I dont need a leader
Already fly nigga I dont need a visa
And yeah she looks good but i dont need to keep her
Cus i school niggas I dont to teach her
I got a Paigey I dont need Alisha
Thats good brain nigga I dont need to lease her
I take shots nigga I dont need to kill her
(Whoooah)
Me and Jobey think about a master plan
I remember when they used to laugh at man
SF ask my bro where the hardest at
Kool Nuh, thats my brand im guna market that
I skert in till, I skert out
I put the work in till it works out
Im Big Tobz give a fuck what you heard bout
When you're in OT im in your girls house
Runnin' thru the city with my bros
Money always busy on my dome
Fuck it i came here on my own
She like my voice, i told her kiss me thru the phone
And man dont care about all that
Man just care about more racks
If I give you air dont call back
If you dont want to disappear dont talk bad
Man dont care about all that
Man just care about more racks
So if I give you air dont call back
If you dont want to disappear dont talk bad
