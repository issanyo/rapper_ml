[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bounce wit me now, bounce
Bounce wit me now, bounce
Bounce wit me now, bounce
Uh
I stay fresher than a motherfucker, cleaner than a pimp
Big 40 got me walkin' with a limp
With a limp, little nigga gettin' rich
Started off eatin' noodles, every night steak and shrimp, lord
Little nigga take a glimpse
Pockets say cheese like a nigga takin' flicks
Got a thick ho, she can't even take a dick
Fly nigga blowin' up, you would think I was a blimp
Or a plane in the sky gettin' brain from a dime
In the back of the jet only thing on my mind
Is the money and the clothes, cars and the hoes
And my little nigga probably growin' tall gettin' old
Woah
What your life like, sir
Money machines sounding like a typewriter
Probably eat the pussy but I wouldn't wife her
Off the floor, aventador,  I pull off like skrr (like skrr)
Kitty in the engine might purr
Sippin' on the lean so a nigga might slur
Promethazine make my vision go blur
And these diamonds on my neck and my wrist like burr
So cold, oh no I ain't gotta go go
Cause my prezzy rose gold
And I'm ballin' Pro Bowl
Romo niggas quarterbackin' with my old ho
But I ain't trippin, YOLO nigga

[Hook: T.I.]
Niggas say they keep a flame but it ain't like that
Try me I go hard in the paint right quick
Laugh at a nigga tryna take my bitch
In a new white 6, 4 or 5 white bricks
Bank roll like [?] with a bit like diddy
Broke nigga know you ain't rich as my clique
Got shit on my clique, nigga ask your bitch
I call her right quick, she'll get on my dick
Nigga get like that, get like that
Fuck ass nigga come and get like that
Get like that, get like that
Sucka ass nigga can't get like that
Come and get like that, get like that
Pussy ass niggas can't get like that
Come and get like that, get like that
Ya'll sucka niggas can't get like that

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah
Ridin' in this audi bout to pull up in something you can't claim
Crown me in the city as king it ain't changed
Ain't no nigga hotter then me I'm covered in flames
I renovated the chains so haters could look strange
Young nigga fly on they ass, I got wings
Couple of trained shooters for haters, we got game
Still pull up in the hood get work and dumb change
Then pull up in your city get head and jump planes
Southwest rockstar, guns n roses
Bunch of heavy metal take a bullet to load this
Been a stiff nigga bet yo ass can't fold this
Niggas on dick tell them niggas to hold this
All black coupe you ain't seen how I rolled this
Everything ice nigga ain't I the coldest
Top laid back bitch I'm easy to notice
100 grand cash makes it easy to focus
Rich broke nigga, lord knows I'm hopeless
Straight up out of the gutter with the rest of the roaches
Louis vuitton belt put it right where the toast is
Puttin' bad bitches on my team like coaches
I ain't hit the block i call plays
Run off in that pussy then I probably part ways
Hustle gang bitch, count money all day
At the club  [?]    ball on em all day

[Hook]
Niggas say they keep a flame but it ain't like that

Sucka ass nigga can't get like that
Come and get like that, get like that
Pussy ass niggas can't get like that
Come and get like that, get like that
Ya'll sucka niggas can't get like that

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hundred in my pocket and my partner stayin trippin'
With a bunch of Cali niggas in the neighborhood crippin'
A nigga want to talk, send a nigga on a mission
Hit a nigga with a chopper make a nigga come up missing
Play no game nigga know my real
Save me the trouble nigga check yourself
Extendo clip nigga check my belt
All we do is get money in the game I rep
Hustle gang over everything nigga no exceptions
Talking crazy on the phone, I can't hear you no reception
A nigga try me and it's on, have mercy god bless him
I'm the mothafucking king why i care about a pesant
I'm chasing the  profession all I'm getting is the money
Lame ass niggas can't get shit from me
I got a group of young niggas go and hit licks for me
As for haters,  fuck em mane, never did shit for me
75 on the wrist got a hundred on the neck
Kill a nigga get a life sentence, done it for respect
Black rolls at the red another one in front of that
With a group of bad bitches say they want it from the back
A nigga try to do respect I ain't playin'  none of that
Shawty hit em with the Tech lay the nigga on his back
[?] pull a 9 on a nigga [?]
Nigga don't want this nigga check that

[Hook]
