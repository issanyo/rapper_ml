Let it be known
Ain't nobody better at flowing
Head full of thorns, head for the throne
You got your head in your ass, I keep my head in the zone
I had to behead the head of the home
Oh!
I'm sonning all you motherfuckers
Pulling magazines out I'ma run for covers
Wasn't there for the photo op
So I stopped
Got Photoshop
I'm an entertainer like I'm Cedric
You prolly enter labor like you pregnant
The threat of it at the back of my mind
Spit rhymes while I practice autographic design
Half of the time that I'm passing through
Half your crew is like "I'm a rapper, too!"
Got the mic? I'm the one you wanna pass it to
Cuz if I ain't got next, I'm coming after you
Like V, you might see me in a movie
I'm Bruce Lee and I'm Spike Lee
And Jason Lee
I'ma be on TV
In your stereo, and skating street
Play for keeps, ain't a enemy left
I just do it, Nike should be sending me checks
I flex
So don't be sending me threats
Cuz I could take your life like identity theft
Nah, Lennon the Lord, I let it be
I rock wilder than Red and methamphetamine
That got some rappers wanna steal my identity
That got me feeling like my own worst enemy
Offending me and I'm coming for you
Like it's open season, I'll take the W, too
Like it's tax season, Zach's aiming for you
Like an IRS audit, you ain't paying your dues
Never foot the bill, playing to lose
If hooks could kill, I would bury Earl
I'll never marry
I'm never merry, girl
I'm a sadboy
And a bad boy like Diddy P
You fuck boys could never get rid of me
I am the epitome of what you finna be but never get to be
You are the epitome of "pity me"
Dead in the middle of Little Italy
I belittle the brittle idiots that try to spit at me
Here's a riddle: ever fiddle with the Devil before?
Put your pride in the middle and we can settle the score
I bet you never record, never perform
Never a tour, never adored
Sent shots at me, they were never addressed
They didn't get to me, hey! Ain't I clever as heck?
You were never a threat
Put you down like a veteran vet, better get him a pet
How a president let a fucking resident step?
I cut you off and send a severance check
You're low in the poll, they would never elect you
I be flying in a federal jet
Ever been to Tibet? They saying "Send him direct"
You're a loser, baby, and I'm better than Beck
I be catching the wreck til I'm catching my breath
Even Ali said I'm the best
Never forget, the rest are fronting
I got next they got next to nothing
I got next they got next to nothing
I got next they got next to nothing
