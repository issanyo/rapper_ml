[Verses 1: JayKay]
This rap
Consist of strict facts and riff raff that's in tact
My right from wrong is mismatched
Stability is wick wack
The old cats get pissed at
Make me want to click gats
All up on they motherfucking bitchass
Yo, Loddie roll another one
Representing 901
Trade ya body for a ton
Fuck ya block up just for fun
To be honest, you should run
When you see the badass motherfuckers with humongous guns
Yo, I'm Evel like Knievel
My flow be so damn deep, it's undergo chemo
We balling on a budget, so low key copping a kilo
I'm the number one shooter, I got accuracy on these free throws
Yo bitch, a freak hoe, she ride for dough and deep throat
She tease and blow, scream, moan, and love it when I below
Her waistline, all y'all other bitches just waste time, you ain't fine
Saying I don't like 'em is a hate crime

[Bridge: J. Logan]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit a stride, had to get straight
Just so I could focus on the mixtape
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I will never ever let the streets down
I haven't left the booth for a week now

[Hook: J. Logan]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't tripping, Imma let 'em sleep
I ain't tripping, let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 2: J. Logan]
These niggas think they really hitting, but really, they just beginners
What I do here ain't just spitting, I just do this for the kids
Who do not know what they should listen to
Listen man, I'm slowly killing you, I cannot help that I'm a villain (Ooh)
Been on a mission, I ain't left the house
I had to put a team together, now we going out to Mexico
The steady metronome keeps ticking back and forth, my nigga
I'm 'bout to snap and put you down just like a horse, my nigga
Let's look back for a minute, shall we?
I been cooking up this fire since my trip to Cali
I've been feeling inspired since I was born, my nigga
Fuck you niggas think that I just stumbled up on this shit and just started spitting
Yeah, I said it, I was born for rap
I hit the bottom, my nigga, and I ain't going back
This that struggle rap
We had to struggle to afford the beat
But now they paying us, my nigga, what I sight to see

[Hook: J. Logan]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't tripping, Imma let 'em sleep
I ain't tripping, let 'em rest in peace
