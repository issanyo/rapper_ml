[Intro]
Uh...
Poundcake...
Free Lieks...
Free Ipo...

[Verse]
I'm tryna put some food up on the table
And people talking to me like I'm famous
I ain't even make it
Snakes tryna' scrape whats on my plate I tell ehm take it
Trade it for our mate-ship
But take it to the grave all I need is what I came with
You can take the clothes up off my back and leave me naked
I ain't even fazed everything I have is tainted, yeah
What I'm worth is what is measured on the scales
And that's real I ain't living in a fairytale
I'm tryna make it in a place where I'm meant to fail
I miss Lieks
Free all my fam in jail
He's still got two years and he's been there for ages
I didn't even find out till later
I had to read it in the paper
I hate it
My screams for help are lost in translation
And truth be told I can't explain it, uh
Its been four years since I've seen my cousin
Another two on top of that since I've seen my brother
I just hope they know that I love them
Its got me down thinking fuck it
I'm hungry, a big heart doesn't fill an empty stomach
I still got nothing in my cupboards
Tuna and rice take what I have and turn it into something
I learnt to live without no money
I seem to cope
Even when I'm broke I know that I can function
But I'm 22 now and sick of having nothing (I'm sick)
I'm sick of eating Nutri-grain for lunch with no milk
And I can't fill it up with love
Shits crazy I don't know who to trust
Mates taking what I have like what I give ehms not enough
They kick me when I'm down and smile when I'm up
I've seen the men they've become
It's fucked
The only woman that I listen to is mum
Cause she was there way before the others
I wonder if she's thinking of her son
And if she is then which one, uh
I haven't heard from River in a month last time we spoke he told me [Ibves?] was living in the slums
To slow my thoughts down I'm sipping on a cup drinking whiskey mixed with ginger and a little bit of rum
And I ain't even like the feeling when I'm drunk
It reminds me of the ship that went and sunk
I'm still in line at Centrelink and people think I made it
I can't say shit my brothers still in Brooklyn living in a trailer
I wish that I could fix the situation
I just wanna take him out the basement
He's been by my side since I lived at Grace's
We started SAL together sitting at the station
It's that real
And fuck rap
All he wanted to do was paint it
I've never seen that type of dedication
I just wanna take him out the basement put his feet up on the pavement
Let him show me what he's made of (show me brother)
To pay the bills I'm out working like a slave
Fiends got me running back and forth and they're the ones who chasing
What I sell will turn a man into a traitor
Drugs will turn a family to strangers (yeah)
I watched my team go from the minor to the majors and all it took was time and motivation
Snakes in the grass keep it cut just like a razor
Enemies and friends in the end they're all the same
Life's a game and everybody's just a player
So why would I believe the shit your saying?
It makes no sense I'm just a man whose tryna pay my rent
Tell my family to take whats left
Everybody wants to say we're friends
This year three mates already came and went
But they made their beds
I'm not a leader, I don't say I am
I just love my fam, and will until the day I'm dead
And I ain't living in the ends cause I changed address
I made a move and I ain't talking bout no game of chess
I was brought up taught to break my bread
I was raised to share
They ain't my friends because they shake my hand
Nah...
