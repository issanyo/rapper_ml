Verse 1:
What up brotha give your girl a josh peck
No disrespect, caught up in the mix every time I spit
Space modulator to a hater
You know I'm tryna be the face for Fader
This the young invader, Carlisle the Great
I got a Persian rug with a dead rapper rolled up so take
Everything you heard to the bank
Cash that in and wait
You're having withdrawals now
I brought the flow back
Too invested in this shit to have some fuckin drawbacks
Give my draws back
Bama breed but Harlem when I give shaft
Wearing Polo Jeans to Therapy
No double daring me unless Nick is paying me
I could buy a new Mac, well hell, maybe a new Mac
Either way I’m sendin shots at you so get back
You can guess it's fuckin my house
Man, I’m done with these games and that soft guy Callout
Adventure Time 2 causing a fallout
I’ll make mince meat outta that beat mouse

Verse 2:
I'm about to explode this rappers need some help
Leavin welps Pootie Tang with the belt
I'm over my first two tapes, man that was great
But people need more bars for my family's sake
Whiter than some apple products
Man, they swear I was brought up
By wolves man I'm feelin golden Midus
Man, the flow the tightest no way I can hide it
Goal is to eat everyone even my team I'll bite it
Like the Andes flight, that boy gotta survive
Feel the vibes blowin chronic in the ride
Take it back to 99, 6 with nothin on my mind
But having 151 and dad not comin by
I want to fuck my neighbor, other is a drug dealer
Down the road is a stealer, I was cheeseburger
I'm waitin for that day to get my golden ticket
In a couple bars I could probably fix it

Verse 3:
The boy is hot up in the city
You want some problems try to scrap with me
Bitch here's the birdie fuckin bat mitten me
Make her take a shuttle to get this cock
Who you tryna knock? CJ leave your career open bruh
Not tryna stunt but I'm more fire than Blaine
Bitch you know this insane, shawty what you drank
Hope it's water got Mick Jenkins sayin fuck Gatorade
Can't just give you a little taste
Open up and enjoy everything I put on the plate
Over staying up late
Gotta get up early put some fuckin money in the bank
Step child flow who you tryna spank
Man, she in a land of ooo like she Finn and Jake

Adventure Time 2
