[Intro: Jae Richards, Trey Richards, Phone-EG and reporter]
J: Yeah, I don't know, man, I was justâ€¦just a regular day at work, I was dropping off a shipment of bucket hats, New Era, and all of a sudden this guy dressed in all black came and stuck me up with a pistol, said, um, "Give me all the bucket hats," basically and that's what he did. He took all the bucket hats and ran off
R: What about you, sir?
T: Yeah, I was driving back from work on the 401 and this black car just sped past me, bucket hats flying everywhere. (Chuckles) It was really weird
R: What is it with you and bucket hats?
P: I don't know, I just really like bucket hats, they do something for me, you know what I mean?

[Hook]
Bucket hat on 'cause I'm a real-ass nigga
Slang the rock on the block, no, I'm not Jigga
Call my burner Scarface, smoke you up like a cigar
When I have my bucket hat on, I am just that nigga
Bucket hat on 'cause I'm a real-ass nigga
Slang the rock on the block, no, I'm not Jigga
Call my burner Scarface, smoke you up like a cigar
When I have my bucket hat on, I am just that nigga

[Verse 1]
Black bucket hat on
I shoot you, leave your hat gone
The barrel throw Hadoukens, you would think you're in Capcom
Lights out like "clap off" and "clap on", my mask on
And now you are an orphan, your mom's gone, your dad's gone
Now you look like Annie
I took your fucking granny
You want her back in one piece, at least a fucking grand, G
Hmm, you think it's all fine and dandy
Till you reach home and realize you got the wrong granny
Phone-E draw the burners out on any occasion
Phone-E's kinda shy, my guns have the conversations
My bullets heat-seeking, now what happened to the beakin'?
Someone better bless you when this gun starts sneezing

[Hook]
Bucket hat on 'cause I'm a real-ass nigga
Slang the rock on the block, no, I'm not Jigga
Call my burner Scarface, smoke you up like a cigar
When I have my bucket hat on, I am just that nigga
Bucket hat on 'cause I'm a real-ass nigga
Slang the rock on the block, no, I'm not Jigga
Call my burner Scarface, smoke you up like a cigar
When I have my bucket hat on, I am just that nigga

[Verse 2]
Yo, mandem can't test this
This ting'll leave you chestless
My guns test your cardio
Leave a nigga breathless
Condition's now critical
Big kids will belittle you
My shrink told me, "Open up," I took it literal
Mans won't like me when I'm gone off the Henny
Hit you till your face swell like Francine Frensky (Arthur)
Mean mug, I make you piss, my look is that stern
If he snitchin' like DW, I'll make that rat burn
Told Boi-1da, "Swing a beat and I got it covered"
Sunny Diamonds in the lab, that's my fuckin' brother
A man come at this, you know I'm buckin' at that
I was running through the 6 with my bucket hat

[Hook]
Bucket hat on 'cause I'm a real-ass nigga
Slang the rock on the block, no, I'm not Jigga
Call my burner Scarface, smoke you up like a cigar
When I have my bucket hat on, I am just that nigga
Bucket hat on 'cause I'm a real-ass nigga
Slang the rock on the block, no, I'm not Jigga
Call my burner Scarface, smoke you up like a cigar
When I have my bucket hat on, I am just that nigga

[Outro]
