I'm laughing to the bank but ain't a damn thing funny
About that profit like Muhammed, homie all I want is money
I'm just ducking from the haters, focused on this paper
Tell them niggas on the side see ya' later
Cause I ain't got the time for, no I ain't got the time for
See homie I've been on my grind for, so I ain't got the time for


[Verse 1]
Feel like the top exactly where we supposed to be nigga
[?] And I wonâ€™t let an opportunist close to me nigga
I keep a piece, fuck your peace nigga
My lean budget match your monthly rent and lease nigga
A genius, she give me brain as soon as she meet us
I'm only about a check, even got one outta' Adidas
These niggas mimic my moves, lookin' like a hype man
On molly right now, even her fingers rolling, ice man
George Gervin, coupe swerving while I'm switching lanes
Can't put my trust in these niggas knowing that niggas change
So whats the basis when rappers don't know the basics
Still not taking advice from those I wouldn't trade place with
With all disrespect I ain't on no saving face shit
About to crash and burn, I suggest you hit your brakes quick
Streets ugly, blocks need face lifts
And even knowing that, I still ain't left him on that fake shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This game do something to you, turn you into a beast
I'm on Billboard charts but we still in these streets
Nigga we got to eat, whole squad gotta dine
Besides these rappers talkin' about me, homie my life fine
Lord show me a sign, till then i'm showing no mercy
On this road to the riches but that highway curvy
If they fiendin', I serve em'
If I'm nothing, she's slurping
Keep a pistol on my purse and never claim to be perfect
Both of my hands dirty, we just scratching the surface
Bet your past looking shaky, spent your whole life nervous
Fuck with me while i'm working, we hit your block lurking
We just looking to search him, if we spot him we murking

[Hook]
