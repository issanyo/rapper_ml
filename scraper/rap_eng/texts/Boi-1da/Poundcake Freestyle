Yeah

I've kept it silent nigga
But it's time to let me speak
There aren't that many rappers coming with this typa heat

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the, get the, get the, get the
Get the, get the, get the, get the money, dollar, dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar, dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the, get the, get the, get the
Get the, get the, get the, get the money, dollar, dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar, dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

Yeah

[Verse 1]
4 point 5 dollars for a vest now
9 shots to my head
That's 50 cents now
And after the show, rivals should take a bow
I've evening the odds,lemme show you how
Lemme show you how...
Lemme show you what I'm all about
The wackest rappers at the top and Ima take em out
Without a reason, I'm the nigga you can never doubt
I'm Usain Bolt in this race and ima run em out
13 syllables a line
And this is Ultras art

Yeah
Yeah

I dreamt of giving the crowd my sound
Give them my heart
All I need is some believers who will do their part
A young black boy
Dreams of a better man
I want a better life
Don't wanna fight with uncle Sam
Nowadays, it's everybody but the friends and fam
And if you lack the 2
The question's "who you really have?"
"who you really have?"
I turn my back on them in fear
I'll find a knife stuck in my back

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the, get the, get the, get the
Get the, get the, get the, get the money, dollar, dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar, dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the, get the, get the, get the
Get the, get the, get the, get the money, dollar, dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar, dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 2]
Mic Controller
I control the mic
All my rivals dead call me killer mike
And I knock my rivals out like Mike Tyson
Sing to your girl like I'm Bryson
Whooo!!!

Exciting
Got too much love for the bros that's out trying
Last week I copped the Nike checks
What shoes you buying
An Investment in the future
That's a buy-in
Ralph Lauryn or Hill figure to Zion
My Mom's the man of the house,she's out providing
The Beauty or Bars
I'm Still Deciding
The Throne belongs to me, or me
Its undecided
Look
2030 vision
I'll be 29
Praying to God that I'll be living fine
Praying to God I'm living off my grind
These days I'm working hard
I'm tryna find a peace of mind

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the, get the, get the, get the
Get the, get the, get the, get the money, dollar, dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar, dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the, get the, get the, get the
Get the, get the, get the, get the money, dollar, dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar, dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

Yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm looking up the tunnel
And I can see the light
That's the evidence of all those early nights
My careers kite
My haters missed my flight
Somebody needs some glasses(sunglasses)
Tell them Ultra's futures bright
Played my track today
My family didn't listen
I guess they don't see eye to eye
When its time for vision
I guess they blinded by the
Social media
Television
Lemme listen
To a simple song
It's what I envision
Rappers at my school
Laughing at my rhymes
We can go toe to toe
I'll kill you in a line
Or we go for bars if you really wish
All wack rappers are my favourite dish
I'm a big baller
No-one can belittle me
You already know me
You cannot Lamelo me

Nobody sees it
But I'm royalty
Things are playing out
They breezy like they s'posed to be
We set off
Watch me Takeoff with my Migos
Gavinisto starts to feel like how I feel

No superman

But know YAN's a man of steel

Yeah!
