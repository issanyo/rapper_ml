[Intro]
Dear Lord please hear me this prayer ain't for me
This for the ones that struggle everyday with they belief
That ain't accepted you but still they relate to me
So painfully I pray you make them able to receive

[Verse 1: Bizzle]
I try to tell them about Christ and they ain't trying to feel it
When I act Christ like they say that I'm the realest
But if I'm just a duplicate then who it is I'm trying to be
Is really who they digging they just trying to fight the feeling
Racism got them claiming its the white religion
Scarred by slavery and all the whites that did it
But slave owners just manipulated Bible scriptures
They claimed Christian but never obeyed the writings in it
They stumble off the imagery provided by the pictures
Like why when I look at God he looks nothing like this
You right and that description is not provided by the scriptures
And folks will be held accountable when Christ arrives to get us
And for you I'm just trying to help you make the right decision
There's only one God ain't no black or white religion
The devil used slavery to magnify division
Now you trapped inside the prison of a past you not forgiving
Forgive them

[Chorus]
Cause we done felt a lot of pain
So Lord I know you feel us
And we done seen alot of things
So my prayer is that you heal us
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)

[Verse 2: Bizzle]
Some of them know some been listening to liars though
Some of them just don't care some of them trying though
Without faith in you what do they rely upon to keep them righteous on the same street that guys are dying on
Doctrine of the devils survival of the fittest
Cause all I see it meaning is survival of the wicked
It's like you play a game and somebody starts cheating you
You feel the only way to beat them is to become a cheater too
They call it being tough Its really being weak
Switching teams out of fear that you'll see defeat
That's like a Crip in the room wit a hundred bloods
Given the option to either dying or becoming one
Homie I know it cause I did it
I hustled cause I feared my way of living if I didn't
I'm familiar with the prison of the mind
But in Him there is no fear
Lord save those who though have an ear don't hear

[Chorus]
Cause we done felt a lot of pain
So Lord I know you feel us
And we done seen alot of things
So my prayer is that you heal us
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)


Verse 3
Some think is a wack religion or its not the black religion
In America slavery is the only past were given
Searching for a history that reaches past the masters whippings
Dissing the Bible not knowing how many blacks was in it
So they revert to Egypt we know that they were black
So Moses had to be to fit in when the brought that baby back
Joseph blended in so well his fam ain't recognize him
So how you think Mary took Jesus up to Eygpt to hide him
And honestly back then there wasn't even such a race as black
It wasn't until way later we started claiming that
I can pick the bible up and show you everything that's black
The problem is you should praise him without me even saying that
Worship the Lord who did what you could not do
Cause you were made in is His image
Not cause he looks like you
I'm saying
I understand why you feel how you feel
But feeling don't always tell you what's real
He is the truth and the way and the Life homie

[Chorus]
Cause we done felt a lot of pain
So Lord I know you feel us
And we done seen alot of things
So my prayer is that you heal us
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)
