[Intro: Mavado & DJ Khaled]
Ahhhh haaa (Pass the Guinness)
Yahhh
Gully Gad, from Kingston (We the best music)

[Chorus: Mavado]
So suicidal, first dem ever see this
Gangsta for life, the realist
So suicidal, first dem ever see this
Gangsta for life, the realist

[Verse 1: Mavado]
So mi say be careful a di road dem weh yuh walk
Some a carry grudge and some a dem have dutty heart
Chat in front yuh face, dem wah fi kill you when you pass
You dem woulda lost so its best if you nuh talk
Am on another level like a Noah wid dah Ark
Am mi nuh fear di devil with the fork
Touch Gullyside guns smoke and guns bark
All a mi enemies dead off

[Chorus: Mavado]
So suicial, first dem ever see this
Gangsta for life, the realist
So suicial, first dem ever see this
Gangsta for life, the realist

[Verse 2: Mavado]
Every street, every block
Gullyside and a me
Tell dem we the best is just a family
From Kingston, Jamaica to Miami
We taking over, lead mek dem falla we (Sing it)
Every Gangsta pon dem corner
A smoke the marijuana
Far as dem eyes can see
Mi a di real thing
From New York to California
To Arizona dem haffi set we free
Old Gangalee

[Bridge: Mavado]
God if you with me
Show the light just let me know
Light just let me know you know
Hands in the sky if you with me
Its the Gullyside life you know
You know... you know...

[Chorus: Mavado]
So suicidal, first dem ever see this
Gangsta for life, the realist
So suicidal, first dem ever see this
Gangsta for life, the realist
