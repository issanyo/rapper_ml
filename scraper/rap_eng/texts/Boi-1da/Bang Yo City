[Verse 1: Crooked I]
What do you do if you a rebel
When the whole world around you ain't thinking on your level
Like a stone to a pebble I'm looking at my bezel
I ain't got time to verbally wrestle with you devils
Talking shit and freeze my mind
Till I become a walking stick to lead the blind, yeah
Do you believe my grind?
I spit polished, that's the reason I perceive to shine
Should've knew from "Session One" leave them guys alone
Feel my work is never done, my life's a song
Even though I kept a gun I knew right from wrong
I got wisdom like Reverend Run, I could wise your dome
I put on for my city, got my hood on smash
Riding through Long Beach, foot on gas
TMZ with the pistols, looking for guns to put on blast
Leave me alone and they staying in my good old stash
The hood mess with my scruples
I looked death in the face so closely I saw myself in his pupils
Everybody got a coffin they gone get in time
I'm walking, not running trying to get in mine
My young homies, they'll thug with a cause
My old homies living life behind government walls
Fell victim to Republican laws
Barbara Boxer, Arnold Schwarzenegger, naw I ain't fucking with y'all
The conspiracy theorist that y'all say I be
Thinking a free clinic giving out H-I-V, ugh
Murder the ghetto with A-I-D-S
Preach to the choir, may I please? Chuch
I know you lyric critics wanna give me hell
Just to harming them flow going deeper than any well
Thinking optimistic, 2013 Coupe on reserve
My ward ain't ending in 2012
I'm the best, hating on me's what you better do
Have to talk behind my back cause I'm ahead of you
Hip Hop Weekly new beat killing 'em
Trying to be a synonym to Kool G
And ill as Eminem with the loose leaf
Crazy as Kool Keith, giving them groupies a two drink minimum
When they suck me off, they be working so hard
Like an employee I must be boss, ugh
My little nigga Manny 15 keep a M16
Love to hear that bitch scream
I can tell him to kill you if I wanted to
But why would I tell him to do something I wanna do

Turn on the TV, rappers all sagging
Tell you ain't never had shit, how y'all bragging? Yeah
Nigga 44 Magnum, point it at you industry niggas who false flagging
You false flagging homie, you false flagging
You false flagging homie, you false flagging
You ain't a Crip, Piru or a Blood
And I hope some real bangers kill you, nigga what?
