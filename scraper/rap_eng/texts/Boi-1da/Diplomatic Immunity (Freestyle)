[Verse 1: Vado]

Uh, Diplomatic Immunity, understand who you're standing with
My throw on my Jeff Hamilton like I'm Cameron
Tied around my construct, where my Bandanna went?
Garage full of that white but nothing like Santana's whips
I'm speaking for mostly the heat biz
Them truck promotional street (?)
When windows flooded the (?) all address their feelings
Too many emotional sleeve wearers
Been a menace since I heard that door knock
Opportunities ain't coming, left around 8 somethin'
