[Verse: Damian Lillard]
I don’t talk about fantasy, I’m in touch with reality
Blind to the fact that the setup a catastrophe
Want that for the moment cash – me, I need a salary
They think I’m talking bout some phones when I say the galaxy
But my mind roaming, this life ain't meant for all of us
Problem is we get enticed by everything that’s calling us
Want us all to make it, when you late can’t always start a bus
And baggage get to dragging but this money ain’t a Tonka truck
I take pride in being me because it’s good enough
And I’m a great guy but trust me I could erupt
I decided to betray pride, stood him up
I’m light years ahead of this showing that putty huh
It’s been a minute since people thought I was finished
Took a couple years ‘fore they noticed I was a menace
Dominating comp’ and the country was taking interest
Small school, cold fade, boy I’m on my Scottie Pippen
When it’s hard you see the strong rise above it
Smile when they ask about the grind cuz I love it
Got the game from Pops, mind frame from my cousin
Always in my bag, never lag, easy does it
It’s amazing how this life is what we thirst for
When you make it chances inflate that you hurt more
Like it be tryna take you under, where my surf board?
So my head above water cuz I work sore
You see my lane been changes it’s all a process
Started off a squirrel – changed into Loch Ness
Now I’m in the game and I’m hardly doing side bits
Probably on the plane cuz the fame gotta ride jets
Sometimes it’s hard to digest
Like the weight that’s on my back’ll bring my mind stress
People blowing up my phone I let that line rest
Shooting Js, free my mind I’m launching bomb threats
That chip on my shoulder look like the moon
When my days getting dark I know the morning coming soon
Crowded at the top I’m tryna make a little room
And it’s always a replacement tryna take it, pay your dues, bruh
