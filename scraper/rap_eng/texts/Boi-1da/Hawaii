[Verse 1]
Mama always told me to be careful of your wishes
Daddy always told me, "No such thing as competition"
Females always told me that I need to learn to listen
And my friends are still tellin' me to get money and fuck bitches
Baby, what you on tonight, baby, you so blonde tonight
Like brunettes, but it's okay, you can be my Madonna tonight
We ride, you'll end up my future ex-wife
My daddy's on his fourth wife, so I guess we'll call that foresight
I'm oh-so oh-so oh-so awesome, I could come up out the coffin
Dressin' like I died yesterday, six feet under's where I'm shoppin'
You don't like it, but you love it, probably should be more assertive
And I'm into mornin' sex, but babe, I'm not a mornin' person
Someday Imma get it, right now I'm just talkin' shit
Tell me what to do and I'll probably do the opposite
Twenty-three with a plan, ain't no one holdin' my hand
I hope these motherfuckers understand, that...

[Refrain]
I'm here tonight, take a look at me
I'm what you wish, that you could be
Call me stubborn, I'm an asshole, I'm a liar, and a cheater
I'm so selfish, I can't help it, why am I a non-believer?
Call me stubborn, I'm an asshole, I'm a liar, and a cheater
I'm so selfish, I can't help it, tell me why I'm so conceited

[Hook]
Chop the beat, stop the tape, do your thing, operate
Gotta go, gotta ride, ain't no sleep, we here tonight
DFY, story of my life
DFY, story of the night

[Verse 2]
I lost one of my homies, damn, Sam, may he rest in peace
I always looked up to him, and now he's lookin' down on me
Can't imagine shit I been through, pops was in prison
A few years later someone held my mama hostage in the kitchen
But no one was hurt, my how the tables have turned
Now those motherfuckers are the ones sittin' in a cell
I hope they burn, hope they learn a lesson
We all make mistakes, I count my blessings
As I walk out of confession, lord, forgive my self-obsession
Don't flatter yourself, what I say to myself
Lookin' into the mirror, as I'm askin' for help
And I'm prayin' for health, cancer takes the best of us
And drug overdoses and accidents, they take the rest of us
I'm tellin' y'all, it's fun and games, until you lyin' in a grave
Friends and fam stand all around, call your name, cryin' for days
I'll be damned, I ain't playin' with ya, man, I'm just sayin'
That I hope these motherfuckers understand, that...

[Refrain]
I'm here tonight, take a look at me
I'm what you wish, that you could be
Call me stubborn, I'm an asshole, I'm a liar, and a cheater
I'm so selfish, I can't help it, why am I a non-believer?
Call me stubborn, I'm an asshole, I'm a liar, and a cheater
I'm so selfish, I can't help it, tell me why I'm so conceited

[Hook]
Chop the beat, stop the tape, do your thing, operate
Gotta go, gotta ride, ain't no sleep, we here tonight
DFY, story of my life
DFY, story of the night

[Outro]
Mama always told me to be careful of your wishes
Daddy always told me, "No such thing as competition"
Females always told me that I need to learn to listen
And my friends are still tellin' me to get money and fuck bitches
My friends are still tellin' me to get money and fuck bitches
My friends are still tellin' me to get money and fuck bitches
