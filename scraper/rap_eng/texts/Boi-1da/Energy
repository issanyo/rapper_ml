[Hook]
I got enemies. Got too many enemies
Got too many demons tryna drain me of this energy
Tryna take the light from ya boy
Tryna do me in and say, "goodnight" to ya boy

[Verse]
I just got back from Cali back into by problems
Scripture calculator how I'm gonna solve them
I saw these instrumentals and said, "Boy, I'm on them."
Saw that girl back in Cali; had to fall autumn
All these voices in my head are telling me to quit
Then I had one coming through he said, "Just read a bit."
Lord, bless me with her love, please. If you see it fit
She probably don't love me so I won't read into it
I hate being blunt cause I ain't one for smokin'
Only reason that I'm strong is cause I used to be broken
Twenty-one years old and I know more than your reverend
Twenty-one years old, already ready for Heaven;
Third row. And I see them shadows chasing after me
Black face, white eyes and all they did was laugh at me
Get back into it. I had to do it
But now they can't feed on me, cause they atrophied
Yeah, these people think it's funny. Do you see me laughing?
Yeah, they sleeping on the Gospel. Do you see me napping?
Yeah, they won't hear me out like what the hell happened?
Maybe you will hear me if I start rapping
I hate to bring her up, but she looks like a model
And she [?] like Teresa but her emotions are bottled
She got demons around her. I want to fight them off for her
Send them back down to hell and Lucifer is the coroner
Yeah my God is the highest, the Holy Son the most righteous
Yeah, they stand by my side so I don't hate to be biased
I'm not always the nicest, I defy the defiant
Got my guardian angel, so that means she's the fliest
I'm trying to tell them

[Hook x2]
