[Intro: Samuel L. Jackson]
AK-47, the very best there is
When you absolutely, positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room?
Accept no substitutes

[Hook]
Better run from Phone-E, yeah
Pussyhole, better run from Phone-EG
Bombaclot, see Phone-EG, you better run!
Cause Phone-EG have the guns, yeah
Phone-EG spit for fun!
See Phone-E, better run
Pussyhole, you better run

[Verse]
Phone-E's hungry and you niggas look like Lays chips
Knuckle up, I don't even have to blaze clips
But don't sleep, if a man pulls out the case quick
I'm quick to put the metal in your mouth like braces
I spray him, then bullets raining down on your den bitch
You wish I never came, bitch
Another pussy slain, bitch
My bullets are all psychic
Already know your name, bitch
My gun spray everywhere
It's not really potty-trained, bitch
Rocket launcher wanna shoot, then Phone-E fuckin' let it
There's a fire in the chamber
Bullets racing to the exit
They say if it ain't broke, then don't fix it
But I couldn't stay broke, I need a chain that glistens
Now listen, AK-47 with extension
Big banana clip full of ammo and attention
Because I'm holding back, my bullets don't like detention
But when that ting ring, you better run for your protection

[Hook]
Better run from Phone-E, yeah
Pussyhole, better run from Phone-EG
Bombaclot, see Phone-EG, you better run!
Cause Phone-EG have the guns, yeah
Phone-EG spit for fun!
See Phone-E, better run
Pussyhole, you better run
