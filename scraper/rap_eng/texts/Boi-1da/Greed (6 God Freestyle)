[Intro]
Blat Blat Its Ya Boy Lil Iblis


[Verse]
I made tracks as a joke
And then I spoke
And I spat out fire
Now I'm in the rap game
Now I'ma try to make money
Till I'm not broke anymore
Damn being broke ain't blessed
If you broke I feel you
Cause when u broke
You ain't gonna get a meal
That's why these broke mans steal
But that ain't right
Man greed has poisoned men's soul
It barricaded the world with hate
That's why there's a lot of people
Who are in need
And what do the greed do
They count they're money
While people live in misery
Man we should live
By each others happiness
That's why we gotta
Get rid of the greed
Cause its making people bleed
People of the world stop dis greed
Just now
Cause greed is a way of hate
And you people have the love of humanity
In your hearts so don't hate
Just open the gate of happiness
So the world can be a better place
So I can chase my dreams
And not worry about hate
Cause its chate
JHEEZ the poverty rate
Is on the rise
Damn i hear the cries of people
That want food
Man the passing of greed
Has brought misery upon us
Damn all this shit
Just makes me
Want to cuss
Damn us humans
Want to help each other
But we ain't doing that
Cause we be thinkin too much
And we feelin too little
And hopefully if we start
To feel it'll
Make the world better
The world is a nice place
But it ain't lookin like that right now
Cause of greed its causin people to bleed
Cause of the wars that are happenin
Damn these wars be closin
The doors of opportunity
Cause people be dyin
So lets all do this deed
To stop greed
And lets all smoke some weed
