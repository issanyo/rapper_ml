[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah

[Chorus: Perfekt]
Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right
If everybody eating that's a good night
Had to take a loss 'fore I took flight
Hard times made for a good life
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, never fell in love with the coco, never had to hold up the store with a .44
Never had the door kicked in by the feds while I'm laying in the bed on the bread that I'm gon' blow (woop!), uh
But I do know what it feel like to go to school with the knock off shoes
Eating free lunch trying to act all cool
Boy, you better know that we paid our dues
Never would I trade that (no!), 'cause it made me better
Could've made me bitter
Can't buy that struggle, can't name no figure
But it made me richer
Yeah, being broke made me rich
And being low made you quit
But being low made me high
Take time if you want this, let's go!

[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah

[Chorus: Perfekt]
Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right
If everybody eating that's a good night
Had to take a loss 'fore I took flight
Hard times made for a good life
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Money may have made me richer, but the struggle got me richer than I ever been
Learn to hustle, use your muscle, learn to grind, and keep your mind up on the future, man
We came out them trenches
Government assistance in the beginning
Keep them cans for the pennies
We saving that grease after dinner
Now they counting all my pennies, counting all my figures, all up in my business, man
Now they watching what I'm spending, wondering what I got, and wondering how I get it, man
I was bought before I had a dollar, being empty-handed made me stupid rich
Rich in loyalty, can't pay the lawyer fee, but it's all good, the squad pitching in

[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah

[Chorus: Perfekt]
Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right
If everybody eating that's a good night
Had to take a loss 'fore I took flight
Hard times made for a good life
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah
