[Instrumental: Pound Cake, Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Gatsby]
Okay it’s first name Jay, last name Gatsby
I’m with your girl Daisy
Yeah she's married… maybe
But we still gonna have a baby
I’m still gon’ steal your shawty
I’m still gon’ throw that party
While I’m sippin’ on Bacardi
That liquor it’s all free, cause you know it’s all on me
Got every drink at the bar, screw a Prohibition policy
Don’t ask me how I got it, but I promise it’s high quality
Man, it wasn’t easy making it in this economy

Yeah it’s G A T S B to the Y
Get in my hydroplane, let’s fly
Don’t even ask why
It’ll just be you and I
You don’t have to be shy
Cause you’re my ride or die

Cake cake cake cake cake cake
Got so much money I got a pound cake
But yea I get that green
Like the light I seen
Just across the bay
Just a mile away
I see it everyday
Livin’ day by day

[Verse 2: Gatsby (to Daisy)]
Okay Daisy baby
I was thinkin’ lately, maybe
You could be my lady
It’s crazy
I could love you on the daily
Everything gravy, it’s wavy
Ridin’ in my Mercedes
Don’t be lazy let’s go to town together even if it’s rainy
We haven’t talked in awhile, where did the time go?
You got a new style, I kind of like it though
I was poor back then, but now I got a lotta dough
Let’s head to the altar, Daisy, we can get married yo


[Verse 3: Tom Buchanan and Gatsby (to each other)]
(Tom Buchanan)
What the hell is going on?
You tryna start a row?
You're just a simple con
You tryna stunt bro?
You ain’t who you say you are, you’re James Gatz
Unlike you, I spit facts
You’ll never get Daisy we all know you’re a fake
You know what? Just stay across that lake
While I be eatin’ this real steak
This real cheesecake
By the poundcake

But nah, forreal though
I really wanna know
How’d you get that dough?

(Gatsby)
Pshhhh my parents bro

(Tom Buchanan)
Nah we all know better you a go getter, bootlegger
No Wolfsheim, you’d be a beggar
No cheddar
A Debtor
Bed wetter

(Gatsby)
But I got a Cashmere sweater
Hella clothes in my dresser
My jacket leather

(Tom Buchanan)
Psshhh whatever
It don’t matter
I’m Daisy’s protector
You just send her love letters

Cause you’re a nobody, I’m a somebody
We’re not buddy buddy, it’s not funny funny

Cause fake fake fake fake fake fake
Got rich quick but for your namesake
You changed your name, for pete sake
How many lies can somebody make?

[Verse 4: Nick Carraway]
I guess it’s true - more money more problems
Fancy cars and hydroplanes, I’m lucky I don’t got ‘em
Even if I had the money, I’m sure Jay’s already bought ‘em
Cause isn’t it’s his wealth that makes him so awesome?

Nah, I don’t wanna hear that one bit
It’s amazing how he did all this for Daisy isn’t it?
Does it even matter if his money’s illegal like it’s counterfeit?
Going away to war and making stacks he ain’t the type to quit

And his personality was just so charismatic
Perhaps because he was so idealistic and romantic
Devoted his life to pleasing Daisy, he became an addict
But it was her mistakes that killed him in the end, it’s so damn tragic

He just wasn’t willing to face reality
Shunning his own parents just cause they didn’t make high salaries
Trying to repeat the past and caught up in his fallacies
Surrounded by wealth thinking “Cody would be proud of me”

When George Wilson murdered him it took a lot out of me
His controversial life consisted of romance and Hennessey
But like it or not, that’s his legacy
The legacy of, The Great Gatsby
