[Intro]
Like sands through the hourglass
So are the days of our lives
Take that out
That's my chain
Talk shit at this part?
About how, like, "The world didn't see it coming!"
This is my chain, gonna do that
This is fresh, right?
You didn't know!

[Hook]
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking

[Verse 1 - Heems]
I'm so wild they call me Four Lokos
So loco, puede... do it for coco
Puff like cocoa, til I'm crisp like Coco
Bonobo, iced tea plus coco
Sunoco flow, no Pinocchio, no BP
Just beat me, meet me where I beat beats, drop street heat
I'm on the block like street meat
Call me Dwight Schrute the way that I eat beats
No beet farm, just pharm beats, smarmy
A motherfucker try to harm me, eh?
I scrap happily, smack a lil'-scrappy-type dude for free
Not for a fee, a Rockfort tee
Or maybe just a cup of tea, had enough of me?
I'm just beginning, finna be a minute 'fore the fat lady singin'
I'm swimmin', I'm crazy, I'm wavy pipeline
Rappers lack flow, now they're trying to bite mine
Need like three life lines,, three wives
Three lines of Vic or white, a night to get hype
Three types of Nikes, my four sides is spiked
My Florsheims is tight,, your punchlines is light
The days of our lives, plus the nights
Catch me on the corner drunk and puking
Crazy stupid, Sami and Lucas!

[Spoken: Heems]
That's a reference to the soap opera Days of Our Lives, even though I was a bigger General Hospital fan growing up

[Hook]
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking

[Verse 2 - Kool AD]
Yeah, see, quit smilin' and shut your silly traps
"These zooted brown weirdos is wildin', but they can really rap!"
They saw the cover of the tape, figured it's pretty wack
Later on eventually admitted that it's pretty crack
Snatched the beer can out your hand like "Gimme that!"
I'm all up in the freezer at your crib like, "Where your Jim B at?"
Couple dubbies in the swisher, dougies, and spare me that
Titty fat, jimmy hat, gimme that Similac
Chug it, cut it, print it, I think it's finished but really black
Run it back, tell me if you're feeling that
Ahem, wait a minute like Ray-J
My work is my play-play, every day pay day
Meet me at the mall, it's going down: May Day
Get it? Joke's not the mall, the may say
The joke's not "meses," vajayjays
Hey hey, they say they wanna have my kids like Bebe
No way way, no, bebe, that's eighteen years like 'Ye say
Too much to pay-pay, sweatin' me like Sheneneh
She say she gave me melee three-way-way

[Hook]
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking

[Verse Three: Heems & Kool AD]
You puff herb? Dawg, I smoke weed too
You chief cheeba? Ay yo, dawg, me too!
Yo me, too? You like weed, dude? Me too!
You like smokin' weed? I see you!
These rappers wack as the movie Wackness
They saccharine, but they not Equal! Ohhhhh!
Ohhhh, no, called a cousin Sweet and Low, dude
Crossover numbers for brothas and white demons, too
We not racist, we love white people!
Ford trucks, apple pies! Bald eagles
Yeah, Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos
Pringles, Kraft Singles, Slim Jims, Sierra Mist!
Butter Crunch cookies, Sour Patch Kids!
The block is like a mattress in the hood, I'm flippin' on it!
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
Over-30 actress, Bulova, Cau, Dalier, Chapstick, uhhhh

[Hook]
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking
We're not joking, just joking, we are joking
Just joking, we're not joking (Heh?)
