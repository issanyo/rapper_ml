[Intro/Hook]

[Verse 1: Tom Foolery]
Here we go, one time on em'
Yeah, uhh, yo, yo
Check me out..
Yo, yo...
I don’t need permission to say whatever I think
And everything you spittin' ain't clever it's dry ink
Look I feel like dying, no I feel like flying
Why put in 40hrs just so I can go and buy things?
I got a wife so I ain't out looking for Kate Moss
Pretty soon these goons are gonna call Foolery Cake Boss
Tommy never take loss, I’m only earning W’s
Stayin’ so far in front you, now tell me what you wanna do?
I’m a starter, you playin’ the part of substitute
And you a bugaboo who still rockin’ that bubble goose
I might be down but I’m bound to cut the struggle loose
Hand to the plow and now every other knuckle bruised
Say you going paperless well no one ‘bout to fuck with you
Living dumb and dangerous, I’m out, I’m bout to chuck a deuce
Catch me on the flip-side like Tony Hawk's skate deck
My paycheck? Gave it to my kids cuz I hate latex
Communtin’ to the apex, shootin’ through the matrix
Provin’ to myself, I’m top shelf, hella greatness
The flow flagrant, my blunt so pregnant
Marijuana on us and it smell so fragrant
Outrageous, dead president faces
Stash em' in my wallet like it's Jame Gumb’s basement
I must make it, we chasing after famous
Slowly down the hall like cannon balls to my Oasis

[Hook]

[Verse 2:  Tom Foolery]
So it's like this...
Money is the root of evil, it make us feel unequal
If you don’t got it, you plottin’, maybe out robbin' people
Explored the options, I clock-in, the bottom got him feeble
Little word of caution, I'm toxic, with a colossus ego
A little rock with Chino, flow hotter than jalapeno
Watch me turn this water into lager or a box of Pinot
I got my 3 amigos, out for blood so we mosquitoes
Hit it like my name Ichiro, Foolery he be the hero
I'm going in until the death of me
And secondly
Gotta get to Cali for a taste of Kendrick's Recipe
Women, Weed, Weather, Pleasure always a necessity
And once you flash some cash
It's like that ass had popped some ecstasy

[Verse 3:  Tom Foolery]
I’m on the come up til' sun up so set your son down
Crashing on your couch snoring loud with my tongue out
Cold sweat, working off an old debt
Getting so high man we ain't even rolled yet
Whole set eatin', I mean it see we feastin'
Exceeding expectations while the rest are barely breathing
I practice what I’m preachin', no need for Comeback Season
We goin' undefeated, every moment I am seizin'
The top is where I see me, believe me
My face will grace your T.V.,
I’m so ahead of time, they callin' Foolery a preemie
And everything is peachy when you sleeping with that genie
Gettin' gold out of this feces, man I make it look so easy
Marky Mark Mark Twain pen game, insane in the membrane
Wanna be remembered like the Splinter is at Fenway
Don’t need no Sensei, I’m my own Miyagi
Flow be so atomic drop myself on Nagasaki
Quasi-Rocky, no one stop me, Tommy more like kamikaze
Chillin' sippin' Irish coffee with my posse til' we zombied
Someone dust these haters off me, cuz my stock is swiftly risin'
Foolery feel Sempiternal, Bring Me the Horizon
