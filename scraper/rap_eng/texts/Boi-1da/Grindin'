[Hook]
We come from Fords and expeditions
Slanging papers with ambition
Cause back in my younger days
That's just how we make a living
That's how I was thought to grind
Learned to hustle from my moms
That's that G shit
And the G simply stands for grind

Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind

[Verse]
I'mma drop this shit for the hell of it
Cause I'm outchea griding, can’t tell me shit

People asking me why you took so long, how you go so strong? Cause it’s timing in all this shit
Will a nigga tryna let his past go, get reminded of all his shit?
Niggas don't go as hard as I do, I be fighting for all that I get
I got a question, why you hating on me? Cause I’m probably grinding his bitch
Everybody who was checking for a nigga and was reppin' for a nigga, I appreciate your prayers I respect you my nigga
A lot of these lames kept hatin' on a nigga, when I took a little fall you was steppin' on a nigga
If you keep it one, then I salute you my nigga, if I see you coming for me I shoot you my nigga
But you’re grindin' like I got somethin' to prove my nigga, bet you couldn’t walk a mile in my shoes my nigga
A lot of my niggas ain’t here this year, I cry for all my niggas
Love everybody in my squad, I die for all them niggas
I give a fuck about these rumours, cause the truth will never be in them
And they love to see when I’m losing, so they hate to see when I’m winning
That boat house on the hill I’m in it, only 22 but I'm 'bout my business
If there's a million dollar club I’m in it, determined to get it so this shit don’t phase me
Even though I’m me, I don’t see no competition I refuse to be defeated
A lot of these nigga ain’t working at all, I chase this check for my family and all
I just got out of the coma, it showed me that when God is for me no weapon can hold me
That’s why I go hard for N.O. and my homies and I pay homage to niggas before me
Fool came back and told me go hard like Ginobili and grind for all this shit
Doctor tell me I’m exhausted and shit, can’t stop now I’m never gon' quit
Not until I see my mama not wantin' for nothin'
And I see my brothers just living for a living
And I see my squad spending money like it's nothin'
That's why I’m grinding everyday to make a way because

[Hook]
We come from Fords and expeditions
Slanging papers with ambition
Cause back in my younger day
That's just how we make a living
That's how I was thought to grind
Learned to hustle from my moms
That's that G shit
And the G simply stands for grind
Nigga I'm grinding for all us

[Bridge]
My nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Nigga I'm  grindin’ for all my shit
Nigga grindin’ for all my shit
Nigga grindin’ for all my shit
Nigga grindin’ for all my shit
Nigga grindin’ for all my shit

[Outro]
I'mma drop this shit for the hell of it
Cause I'm outchea griding, can’t tell me shit
