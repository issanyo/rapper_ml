I'm free to live free to love free to get up free to get out and get up and move on x2
From all the pain all the times I ever cried for those who spoke lies I'm gonna make it
From all the days all the rage I felt inside I know I'm still alive not forsaken
I use to want it so bad I was so mad why can't I have a life like he has?
Autographs record tracks to the globe and rap
It was a dream that seemed out of my grasp but wouldn't last
? spent cash all that I had had to borrow just to stay at my pad ?
But dreams turn bitter and I know I'm not a quitter
I repaint the picture and start with something clearer
I know what it's like yo to work so hard
Watch it fall apart after leaving your job
Gods got your back its free at no charge
? and believe with your heart
I'm free to live free to love free to get up free to get out and get up and move on x2
From all the pain all the times I ever cried for those who spoke lies I'm gonna make it
From all the days all the rage I felt inside I know I'm still alive not forsaken
Ayo my road was long I choked and coughed I froze and lost I brushed it off
I wrote to God hear me I got a problem here can't you see I'm sinking
I'm shrinking I'm tripping sipping searching for some wisdom
Since ? I've been thinking I'm a sleeping victim incline my ear to listen
I was blind I'm here to switch it this is when I call to you
I'm calling balling out ? I'm here to put it down
Anything I don't know download to my soul
Let me be free so I can free those in potholes
Let me sleep easy like the beaches in ?
Help me see clearly you preform the impossible
I'm free to live free to love free to get up free to get out and get up and move on x2
From all the pain all the times I ever cried for those who spoke lies I'm gonna make it
From all the days all the rage I felt inside I know I'm still alive not forsaken
I've been on and off searching for a better job
Hip hop gave me an outlet to set it off
My God says I'm free to just sing a song I walk straight to goals as if my team won
Like the pentagon free to drop a bigger bomb
Thinking my sisters and brothers they need a leader son
Teeter todder not wanting to bother children need a father not just payment with dollars
Home of the braves ? in a moment we change we can't settle for slaves
? go big or go home
Freedoms in the heart mind body and soul
I'm free to live free to love free to get up free to get out and get up and move on x2
From all the pain all the times I ever cried for those who spoke lies I'm gonna make it
From all the days all the rage I felt inside I know I'm still alive not forsaken
