[Verse 1]
Population 1493
Killing these bitches like lime disease
It's Adida Gang till I'm deceased
Listen up when a winner speaks
Life sucks so I'm in her cheeks
I'm smoking on that Wintergreen
Everybody ask where the grass cause I hold it, never pass
Paid for it with my own cash
This weed is mine ask Snoop or Wiz
I'm in your city, might scoop your bitch
Smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck
She suck my dick every time I'm rolling up
Uh!
Man I'm getting primed like an Okazaki Fragment
Her eyes have a question but is her mouth gonna ask it?
Getting away from the axis in a marijuana centrifuge
Time Alone 3 the best tape without no interludes
Yo favorite rappers beat is nothing but my dinner food
My name is Stoney so lemme introduce, myself to you Mr/Mrs
I'm a be rapping till my very last sentence
Screaming fuck you to all you bitches
Ugh!

[Bridge - Low Pitch Young Stoney]
Cali weed in the air tonight, you can smell
They will never understand this but oh well
Eyes heavy for real, I can't see you
She just wanna show some love I said

[Verse 2]
Girl go head and come through
Okay now she loving my language, now she loving my language
Talking bout money and smoking a J
She talking bout love while knowing I can't
I'm fucking her good, it's blowing her brain
And when we get done she rolling that Jane
Oh yeah
For real
Yeah
Roll one and light it
Bad bitches invited
You jealous, don't even hide it
Couple weeks in the Den then it's back to the island
Happy Birthday to LB, you just like a brother
You killing that music, I know that they love ya
You doing your thing and I'm doing my own
My kingdom is here, ain't losing my throne
Put a two to my dome if you trying to stop me
I'm a star from Texas but I playing no hockey
Shout out to Dallas and my homie Rafita
Everything on me reads out to Adidas
Me and my gang, you won't ever defeat us
We running this shit without taking no breathers
We taking these chances and taking our time
Stoney an O-G, just happen to rhyme
I'm the shit no lie, no motherfucking lie
Smoking on like bowl five
Getting more baked with Kornflake than you ever did in yo life
That's the truth, just salute like a troop
And I'm the leader
Stripes all on me, I look like a zebra
Don't ask for feature, I'll probably just beat ya, and that shit is on your own song
I'm back in town for now but I won't be home long

[Verse 3]
See I gotta get my ass to Corpus
Where the weather is so gorgeous
Just like these bitches who ignored us
Now they trying to pay a visit but they can't even afford us
My thoughts worth more than yo mortgage
Know these flowers more than a florist
Know the G code, you stick to the Morris
I'm hearing these rumors and wondering the sources
I'm killing these haters just look at the corpses mane

[Outro]
Time Alone 3
