[Verse 1]
Niggas stay approaching in the club
Vocal with the love when they use to [?]
Must have heard that my crew gettin' paper like printers
God with the bars treat vets like beginners
See when I started off with the east coast G funk
Niggas fronted, sent a verse, they didn't want it
They tried to son me
The don from the D to the dundee
But pause, jerk off
You ain't gettin' nothin' from me
It's like my whole life I been indie
Never liked the message niggas tried to send me
They told me that I didn't sell, wasn't takin' my calls
Now I sport fly chicks
And they all on my balls
Ladies fallin' callin'
Fienin' to get they all in
Put my Jimmy in the jones
Cos they heard i was ballin!
But I don't get down like that
I don't erase I trace any face like that

[Hook]
Hey yo Stro, can a get down with your team?
(scratching) Nigga please
New video, can you put me in the scene?
*scratching* Nigga please
Hey what's your email? I'ma send a couple beats
*scratching* Nigga please
I'm on my last dollar, I just need a little cheese
*scratching* Nigga please

[Verse 2]
Illicit Hip hop, makin' ya hits stop
Without talkin' shit about thots and wristwatch
Crazy how cheddar can stop chatter
And we ain't even rich yet
But you see what we after
Niggas hard to find now its easy to catch them
Chillin' by their lonesome waiting till the phone rung
And got hype when they saw my name
I only had a few things to sing
I just called
To say
I  hate you, at award shows with ya date too
They call the winners Syrup like maple
Cats see my face think back try to play fool
Now why the hell I play him on they mind
But Stro's like Pootie Tang
Ahead of his time
Kept my belt on my waist so they said it wasn't street
Wasn't from the dirty D, they ain't like my beats
But its that NY, Killa
Better recognise, [?]
And we don't divide
Keep my day one's with me
Niggas raw as steak these my A1's with me
I dun upped my weight like I pushed one fifty
Really, things change
I use to bang [?]
Now its dimes and rings
So when you see the god no cards exchange
Beyaach, you wasn't watching when my clothes was stained
Word up

[Hook]
Hey yo Stro, can a get down with your team?

*scratching* Nigga please
Hey what's your email? I'ma send a couple beats
