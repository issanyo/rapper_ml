[Intro]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yeah
Ayy

[Chorus]
Talk to the man upstairs, hoping he answers my prayers
Hollywood feel like the jungle, lions and tigers and bears
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Talk to the man upstairs, hoping he answers my prayers
Hollywood feel like the jungle, lions and tigers and bears

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I’ve been California dreaming
Turnt the fuck up for no reason, ayy (Eazy)
Treat a Wednesday like a weekend
She look like an angel, she might be a demon
Solo, it ain’t no redeeming
These women, they plot and they scheming
Do anything to get ahold of my semen
I’m flushing the rubber, you won’t get my children
This is life here, nothing faze me
What can I say? Bruh, this town is crazy
Left the club with my newest lady
Paparazzi outside, all tryna chase me
Grab her hand and put her in the Ghost
And then, we get ghost like Patrick Swayze
Lifestyle of the young and wavy
What can I say? Bruh, you cannot blame me

[Chorus]
Talk to the man upstairs, hoping he answers my prayers
Hollywood feel like the jungle, lions and tigers and bears
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Talk to the man upstairs, hoping he answers my prayers
Hollywood feel like the jungle, lions and tigers and bears
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Talk to the man upstairs, hoping he answers my prayers
Hollywood feel like the jungle, lions and tigers and bears

[Verse 2]
Ayy, L.A., the land of dreams
Turned into the land of fiends (yeah)
They get caught up in the scene
Partying, partying, partying, partying
They say the top is hella lonely
And you ain’t never been the homie
Why the fuck you say you know me?
This industry is hella phony
Never gave a fuck and I probably never will
Only kept it hella real
I ain’t got an ounce of chill
Ayy, ayy
It's what it is, that’s how it is and I won’t change
You’re not accustomed so it all probably seems so strange, I know
The Beautiful & Damned, pop another Xan
Wash the Bulleit down, have to cool it down
Lost my mind, I won’t stop until it’s found
It’s way up there, I might have to pull it down
Must have been around this time last year
Think I might know where I might have left it
It’s crazy, the city I stay in
I’m hoping that somewhere, my grandma is praying for me, ugh

[Chorus]
Talk to the man upstairs, hoping he answers my prayers
Hollywood feel like the jungle, lions and tigers and bears
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me (grandma, pray for me)
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Talk to the man upstairs, hoping he answers my prayers
Hollywood feel like the jungle, lions and tigers and bears
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Talk to the man upstairs, hoping he answers my prayers
Hollywood feel like the jungle, lions and tigers and bears

[Outro]
Somebody pray for me before it’s too late for me
These demons still chasing me
But angels, they stay with me
They wait for me faithfully
When I fall into the dark, they awaken me
They view damned as beauty mistakenly
This is the show people pay to see
Ladies and Gentlemen, The Beautiful and Damned
