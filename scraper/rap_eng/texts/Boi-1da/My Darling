Verse 1
The fans love me but I love them more
I made a Album put on the tour
Christina Grey you look like someone that I knew
Perhaps Jazmarie but she probably likes pikachu
A, my Darling I have a heart, and the love's falling apart
Where were you last night
I never saw you with the bees like
Every time I want to fight
You come home without any might
We don't have to talk about the bear that you stole
Wait a minute I just saw that on google chrome

Hook
My darling a-a
My darling a-a
My darling a
My darling m-my
My darling a
My darling m-my
My darling a

Verse 2
Stuffs not original stuffs not famous
I miss talking bout Mr. West is the bavest
Ain't nobody talking bout the bear that I own
Never talk about the bear that a crawl
You don't ever talk about the world that you live in
Talking bout the mixtape man that stuff is rigged and
I just never talk about yo life
Straight off from the night like lil Weezy might
I'm cathchin every single time they go
A my darling lemme come back to the show
Cuz I know, I know

Hook
You is my darling
M-my darling
My darling
My darling
My Darling
