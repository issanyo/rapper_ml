[Intro]
Ayo, let me Brooklyn this this one time right quick
Something like me, Yaowa
Uh

[Verse]
Summer sixteen, let me get some of this sixteen
Still got one in the chamber, and that shit above sixteen
None of us dissing none of y'all cause this thing
It could get out of hand stupid
My niggas quick to hip hop, and don't give a fuck about music
Different Slaughterhouses, duct-tape ya all the mouths and
Zip shut like quarter ounces, dead presidents, four outfits
Oh yeah
I put out projects boy, but I'm still that projects boy
No helicopter guap, but I know that chopper noise
Blap-ka-blap-ka partner, your parts all over the block
I'm mad I got ya boy
Anyone wanna box, enjoy
Getting Antonio Tarver Roy
Yeah I'm the one you all avoid, stay away from me
Man I'm all annoyed
Can't get a fight so I'll pick one
I'll pick some bulimic ballin' boy, Whoo
As far as these broads
Can somebody please get these bitches up off me
Dick and they singing all off key
Word to the crib up at Fort Lee
Ah man, these Uber niggas
The Uber niggas just gripping up off me
Cheques just say so much, Texas El Pesos
I'm beginning to think
Like I've been thinking since the beginning and I'm still winning with ink
I never ever changed my sentiment, one of you gentlemen blinked
The metal go clink, the letter go pink, Your head'll go incubator
Respirator so your breath'll go blank
But enough of that, I'm cool lets get rich
Only [?] knows what I do with this dick
In Toronto in that BenZ lookin' smooth with this bitch
I tell her hop out walk ahead and call that views from the six
Mmm
Yank tilted, Tee hanging, pants drooping
Low showing, gold glowing, holes open, fan grouping
Hoodie on, Trayvon, one more black man shootin'
I'm black panther, [?] Cam Newton
