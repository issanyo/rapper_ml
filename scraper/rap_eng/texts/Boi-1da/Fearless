[Intro]
I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you
I ain't scared

[Verse 1]
No fear
No, I'm right here
Yeah, wanna love you baby
Gonna love you baby
I ain't going anywhere
Yeah, I won't run
No, I'm all yours
Yeah, wanna love you love you
Gonna love you love you
Boy, you turn me around

[Chorus]
Cause I'm one hell of a lady
No, I'm no longer afraid
Yeah, I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you
I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you

[Verse 2]
I'm not scared
No, I'm right here
Yeah, when the clouds are coming
And the rain is falling
I'll stand right by your side
No, I'm not afraid
No, I'm too brave
Yeah, 'cause I love you love you
Yeah, I love you, I love you
I'm a scream it all out

[Chorus]
Cause I'm one hell of a lady
No, I'm no longer afraid
Yeah, I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you
I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you

[Bridge]
You broke me open
Boy, you know you found the
Pieces of my heart, pieces of my heart, yeah
I'm on top of a mountain
That's how it feels, baby
I wanna fall like I've never been hurt before
Woah

[Chorus]
I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you
I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you
Do you hear me, baby?
I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you
I'm fearless
Ready to follow
Ready to love you
