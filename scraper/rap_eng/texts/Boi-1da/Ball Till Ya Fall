[Birdman:]
Yea... fresh
Late hours

Ocean city view sky line
Straight view bird nest bitch
Big money poppin you understand
Talkin and smokin kush
Every day we all good
Chandeliers marble floors

Ball till ya fall
Ball till ya fall

[Gucci Mane:]
Some of u gunna love this
And some of you gunna like this
I'm ballin outta my mind
So I mite need a psychiatrist
I'm ballin bitch ballin bitch
Sources to new orleans bitch
The shawtys with the stupid
Looks my watch looks like it's
Crawlin bitch I don't get no touch
Downs and I don't have a crossover
I cross the country in your city
Touch down and itsz ova I ball 7/24 ain't
No need to pause I ball
When leave the store I shake down the mall
I'm a dog fuck her like a dog treat her
Like a dog I'm a blob I'm a fuckin
Slob write that in your blog
Me and baby ain't no maybe ain't
No probaly a certain you ain't
Workin then you hurt playboy
Push it back I close the curtains

Bitch bitch ball till you fall bitch bitch ball till you fall bitch
Aligator kush niggas smoking out the pound
