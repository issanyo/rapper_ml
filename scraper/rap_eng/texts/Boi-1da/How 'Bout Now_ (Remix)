[Intro]
"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."

[Verse 1]
(Yeah) Always knew I'd do you better than the niggas that you fucked with
Reminiscing bout your time, & now you see them niggas not it, cause ya little nigga got hits
They can say what they want, but can't get to talking hot shit, cause I'm crazy like all my niggas
I'm crazy just like all my niggas, looking back on old times, when you wasn't mine
I'd listen to my conscience, & hold back, knew them dudes would do you wrong
And you'd try to get me back, baby hold that, (Yeah)
Girl you prolly don't remember all the shit that you put me through

[Hook]
Yea, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl how bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, & you suck right now (Aw)
You thought you had it all figured out back then, girl how bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, & you suck right now (Yeah)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl how bout now? (Yeah)
Girl how bout now? How bout now? Girl what about now? Girl how bout now?

[Interlude]
My heart belongs to you

[Verse 2]
(Yeah) You always told me I should keep eyes focused on the bigger picture
But back then I really focused on was me being with ya, (Yeah)
I was in love with ya, but I was addicted to the music, tryna drop a bunch of new shit
I would send you all the links, & have you listen to my bullshit, back then it was bullshit
But right now I'm dropping hot shit, shut ya mouth trick, you can never go & bash my name
It's not the same, it's funny how this all changed, who, when my fam was going thru it
And I wasn't getting thru it, girl I couldn't even call you, but, when your uncle went to prison
You could call me late nights & you'd have someone to talk to, I was the the only one you talked to
Until I cut you off & made find someone else to talk to, (Girl) I was there for ya
And out of every other nigga I was the one that really cared for ya, & I'll prolly always care for ya
(Girl I think I still care for ya...)

[Hook]

[Breakdown]
-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah

[Outro]
Nah, cause I'm up right now, and you suck right now, Nah
