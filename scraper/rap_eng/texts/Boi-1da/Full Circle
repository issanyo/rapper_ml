[Intro: Jay Whiss + Smoke Dawg]
Prime forever
Ahoolay

[Verse 1: Jimmy Prime]
I don't wanna make you feel a way
I keep my money secret, I'ma take it to the grave
Cause really I could drop out like any given day
Niggas could just hop out and hit me with the K
I wanna leave the world way better than I came
Tryna see the better side but too much haters in the way
Ya-yay-ya-yay
I been gettin' paid
Full Circle war ready, yeah we ready for the stage

[Verse 2: Puffy L'z]
Top 'Mali (Top 1 Top 1 Top 1), downtown general
Full Circle, no squares in our visuals
These other rappers should be prayin' for a miracle
Get money, fuck bitches, niggas know the ritual
Save politics for politicians, y'all political (Obama)
878 and Prime, never break the principle
This is our time, we shine, you can check the digital
Niggas say they outside, I guess these niggas fictional

[Verse 3: Jay Whiss]
My closet's like designer heaven
Whiss been gettin' paper since he was 11
She keep on sayin' that she need me but she need a reverend
Full Circle's all that matters nigga, yeah I said it
You know this Benzo cost a lot, I seen her finger had a rock on it
I still got some top in it, my sneakers got a lock on it
And I don't never clean 'em, I buy new ones
You niggas had your time but we the, new ones

[Verse 4: SAFE]
Forty five minutes in the Escalade
She gon' run me top, watch it elevate
Baby know I always get it my way
Drippin', we been sippin' on the high way
Smoking on the high grade
Full Circle yeah, we dangerous
Why these niggas try to hang with us?
Why these bitches wanna drank out my cup
Wherever I go I'm fuckin' shit up
I came with a plug

[Verse 5: Donnie]
Come in and I fuck it up
Baby girl double my cup
Muddy-muddy feel like Silly Putty
Phony bitches actin' buddy-buddy
Only thing I chase is money honey
How much is you bringin' home?
I'm on the road with the chrome
Chasin' everyone that owes
In the house shit was rough
Flip it, sunny side up
Gettin' money in my blood
I can never give it up
Niggas know we got the touch
It's my niggas who I trust
The Circle's full, it's just us
Full Circle just us

[Verse 6: Smoke Dawg]
Full Circle, Full Circle, Full Circle
Tell me who can do it better?
I got your hoe under pressure
And I'm flexin' like I'm a wrestler
She want the more not the lesser
And I whip it up and get extra
I whip that dope like I'm Dexter
The fiends in love with the texture
Broke boys, broke boys
One call get you wet up
No noise, no noise
Told the ops "you need to catch up"
Grab the .40 off the dresser
Your block's soft, get your rep up
Niggas know we the next up
So come correct when you check us
