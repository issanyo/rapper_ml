[Verse 1]
13 years old, my heart was cold
Got raped in my school they always thought I'm fool
Just because of my stammer, but it won't leave you never
Dad not good, like bad food
Just 10 relationships at that age, yeah sex addict
Couldn't control in myself, so i was just did it
Completely lost, and 2 years without one friend
So I decided to make it easy make and end
Drinks, drugs, cigarettes and only sad songs
Cut my wrist, but my mom helped me, yeah crazy thoughts
Lost my house, memories because of the war
Can you believe it? I just needed a real cure

[Hook]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I've been feeling in happy-pain all the time
They had me feel it so I just act like I'm fine
But nobody knows how I was feeling inside
Only you you helped me clear my mind
So I keep Going, go go
Going to fight for myself
Learn learn
Learn how to create myself
That's what you did and become you
I just want you to know that I'm doing it for you

[Verse 2]
Let it begin cause there is nothing called Game Is Over
You're giving me power so I feel now so stronger
And I'm so hungry, yeah cause I'm ready
I'm ready but I can't start it in my country
And I'm stuck in here cause they are keep refusing me
I tried all the ways and in this maybe you can find me
Please Nicki, can you save me again?
Promise I'll make you proud again
I am your SON you saved me from all the pain

[Hook]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I've been feeling in happy-pain all the time
They had me feel it so I just act like I'm fine
But nobody knows how I was feeling inside
Only you you helped me clear my mind
So I keep Going, go go
Going to fight for myself
Learn learn
Learn how to create myself
That's what you did and become you
I just want you to know that I'm doing it for you

[Outro]
I can't kill myself cause i'm living for you
And I can't do my dream I feel now so gloom
This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
I can't feeling myself but not giving up (not giving up)
