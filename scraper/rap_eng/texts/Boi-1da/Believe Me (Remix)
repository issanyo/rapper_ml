[Verse 3: Jake Elation]

No shit talking
When I walk in
Back pretty tired
Cause it seems to hear it often

Better take caution when you up against the toxin
Time keeps tocking
When the buzzer beater stopping
Linking up wit Joey if I'm up inside of Boston

Clocking tracks with ease
Punching in, I hope you're watching
Finally got the job in
I ain't ever really pausing

The one always working
Putting hours in deposit
-ive direction
Up and I'm just getting started

Fuck affiliation
Family if initiated

Was never one to show some patience
Grew and now i see that time is sacred

Never take that shit for granted
Limited amounts, be careful on how you spend it
Slowing down on all the functions That I am attending

Number one lesson;
Move in positive direction;
Get away from people making you lose your attention
I count every second
As time for improvement
No movement

Means no friction
Cold and fire mixing
Over water twisted
Wind 'em out with my persistence

Awed em all
When I mauled em all
Falling off
Autumn holocaust
Caused by yours truly
Sincerely dawg
Never hear the shit I'm on?
You been sleeping long
Couldn't touch my shit even with tongs;

Too far out a reach;
High in degrees
Never trust a bitch
Cause chances are she'll let you freeze

Cold blooded
Sudden flooded
With affection
Try to hide it all
I'm the last one that she mentions

I'm out of fucks to give
Maybe can finally live
Ignorance is bliss
But I'm too vigilant as shit

Hit 'em with a verse quick
Then you feel the earth shift
Small ass circle that I always seem to work with
Get inside our zone, man we always keep our focus
Living for the day but could die at any moment
Why the fuck you think I strive to live and die the dopest?
