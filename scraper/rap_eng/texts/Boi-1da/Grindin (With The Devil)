(Intro)
Grindin with the devil (x4)

(Verse 1: Aly)
Long ago
Some action was going on, I took
My book of trash and threw it on my stash of wicked rhymes
I’m glad I did that
Cause man how I’ve evolved
I trespassed the land of limits them whacks keep talking on
I smashed the odds
Now I’m even and the fans keep growing
Ain’t that the life? We talkin’ The Matrix
So when I tell you I know Kung Fu, I expect you
To take my word for it or I’ll show you
But something is missing
Perhaps I’m mediocre, perhaps I’m insatiable
I’m capable
Of releasing a track but the feedback
Ain’t the one I was hoping for
These voices tell me so
I tell’em to be patient even though I can’t be no mo’
It’s beautiful pain the conflict we’re on, like Abel and Cain
But the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph
Them demons expect to re-create The Fall of Man, I know this ain’t no Zion
Them lunatics have escaped the asylum, but I’ma be defiant
I think it’s the moment of truth
They made me an offer only a fool would refuse
So crushing and oppressive the brain-fuck like a monstrous
Manhood with no bottle of lube, I’m a noob
In the game and they promise resurrection
They know I’m sentimental and be on they dementor shit and corny-ass affection
“By your sophomore mixtape, you gon’ be a Legend”
But I’m still a freshman fledgling and my flesh is edging
Don’t push me close to the edge, I’m trying not to lose my head
I’ma work without resting
“Hold him”, they said. “We gon’ initiate the ceremony”
Fuck it, this how the conversation went

(Chorus x2)
A talk with the devil might last you forever
A dance with the devil might last you forever
A deal with the devil might last you forever, forever, forever, forever

(Verse 2: Bil)
They say a dance with the devil might last you forever
But man I’m a terrible dancer ain’t nobody dancin’ with me
I’m in this rap game tryna make it while you fake reppin’ being a G
But see you ain’t reaching the same level the devil had with me
I’m talking intimacy
We had a discussion yesterday and even now actually
Man turn this shit up
“I’ma let you in my world even sobies won’t believe the grief jewls hoes and heat”
Man you playin’
I don’t want any of that shit, I just wanna reach with what I spit
Or get a Techa Nina feat
I have the desire burning in me like a holocaust
Burn a beat with the venom fire they desire
And I acquire what they desire with the beat
Just talked with the devil he told me
“Go on fight for your dreams but these dreams have a price to claim”
I told him I don’t need your help
He laughed then angrily answered back
“The price is paid whether you like it or not, go against me your head will be on a knot”
Trying to fight this shit got the whole world on my back
Extra load will tear it and smack it
I'm trying to contain it
While my minds going crazy of the dreams I keep witnessing
I’m even having daymares at daytime wide awake trying to relate
I said it before: my life is short and damn right I gotta buy her some high heels
But all the shit I’m going through and the shit I’m witnessing now is heel breaking
With the pressure pilling up over me
I’m starting to doubt myself with this rap shit and even the motives that for I spit
I wanna tear beats and clits
And I’m fucking hyped for my next clip
Everybody started leaving me
But it’s funny cause they say the top is lonely
Am I on my way or what?
I've made a long way in which I and my homie up in here walked through
Should I now stop?
I mean ain’t gonna give up that easily
The devil is one of them motherfuckers; they pissing me off
Like when the top of my dick is itching me off, it’s getting me off
The target, while supporters yelling me Go
I ain’t stopping while my inner voice screaming to Stop
Man I’d rather have a 9 inch up my ass than giving up
It’s the real world we're living in
Get back on track son you’re living sin
And if my money won’t allow me to travel the world
Then my music will
It was Bil

(Verse 3: Aly)
“Hold on!”
“Worry not, the process is simple
Lay on the floor naked, I’ll brand the symbol
After that disappear for a while
Once you return, it’s gon’ be official
Larger than any rock star
Your idols will idolize you as you’ll sell triple what they do
You drop a single
Billions of nickels you gon’ pay us”
I’m a rip van winkle
But I can’t seem to riddle them with my commingle
Of energy and social awareness, it’s a mess
I’ve created by letting them take over my head
It’s so rare, cause I’m always in control
But it seems I’m controlled by that which matters most
And I’m aghast; cause I may not make it without them
Which road shall I take?
The problem is choice, the right or the fault?
I’ve opened the vault of devils, no angels defend me
I’m anguished, it makes me tormented, but maybe
I meant it to happen cause rappin’ is all I have left
I’m bedazzled, I’ll wail and just lament
The lamp is turned off, the process has started
God, I’m so cold, will it be over soon?
I see signs of assurance, nobody has warned me it’s gon’ be so dreadful
It’s over
Am I successful now? Am I?

(Outro)
You wanna join the Illuminati, fuck it
I’ma wipe you all out this world like a tsunami
And play with your life, yea call me Jumanji
I'm the realest in this shit, just try me
Flesh of my flesh, Blood of my blood
Even money can’t buy me (x3)
