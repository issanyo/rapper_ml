[Verse 1]
Long clip hanging out that P95, Ruger cocked
We mobsters, catch you eating that pasta knock your noodle out
I'm from New Orleans, East Side where make a nigga kill you for a bag of dope
When the drought comes we selling soap, we selling dreams, we selling hope
Assault rifle with a telescope, I can hit a nigga from long distance
Peyton Manning, strong precision, two arms stroking like I'm going swimming
Whats wrong with them, they sleeping on me, I'ma start handing out pillows nigga
Then use the same pillow to muzzle the shot coming of my pistol nigga
Get your issue, and I ain't talking about magazines to read to
I'ma read you with a magazine with 30 shots and leave you
Lethal weapon I'm Danny Glover, shoutout my nigga, Thugga Thugga
Choppas in the backseat, but where I'm from we call em cutters
I'm not the one to be fucked with, don't battle rap with me nigga
Get ampted up to get amputated nigga
Turn the booth to a war zone, any rapper get killed quick, Construction worker with tools on our belts, nigga We drill shit
I spit nothing but ill shit, somebody go call the doc
Make a phone call to my shooter nigga, thats what I call, calling shots
Ridin round bumpin Soulja Slim while my young niggas snort a bag of dope
He got a red rag no stopping him, if I  green light you, you gotta go
I'm in LA with the homie Term, I hit him its emergency
He coming through with them mob niggas, they paint these streets burgundy
I ain't come her to play nigga, its finna be a hot summer
Guddaville 4 coming soon, and LAT its our summer
Niggas sitting on twitter talking that tough shit they hella scary
I send niggas with masks to send your shit back to Neveruary
Shoutout to my team yeah, Carter V on the way
My sis Nicki bout to drop something so you rap bitches move out the way
Drizzy that's my brother nigga he know I'm one call away
Tyga Tyga I see you youngin, don't worry let these niggas hate
'Bout to catch a flight to Miami and sit down with my three bosses
All money, fuck bitches, whole stone cold like Steve Austin
Niggas ask when my album dropping, bitch whenever I want to
I could stand on my own two
But I'm staying loyal to my own crew
Young Money Cash Money, bank accounts on overload
My mixtapes are Free Crack like Lil Bibby make 'em overdose
I been hot, I make these niggas bow down and kiss the ring
Walk straight in K.O.D. and balled on 'em like Mr. Clean
Make your girlfriend polish me, we call it shining head like Mr. Clean
Glock 40 with a beam on it, that red laser don't miss a thing
Young Gudda, high yella, I'm back on my Ross shit
Take it back to '02, I'm back on my squad shit nigga
High yella, Young Gudda, I'm back on my Ross shit
I take it back to '02, I'm back on my squad shit nigga
