Whoah
*Fart* Got him!
Whoah! Whoah. Yeah!

[Chorus]
Envelope coming in the mail; letter opener
I'm hoping for a mission call. ain't no tellin'
She invite me to the crib. Keep the phone on me when I go to kick it with her. Ain't no tellin'
J-Dubs coming round here looking to get they numbers up for church. We never help them
Every night I replay my life and wonder, "Will I even make it in, man?" Ain't no tellin', ain't no tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse One]
Am I going to be ahead of the class?
Am I going to be looking opposite of the grass
Am I going to be punished how I looked at the glass?
Am I going to be condemned for making a joke that was crass?
What's my wife going to look like?
I mean I know she's going to look tight
But is she going to cook right?
I mean we're talking my whole life
She might look like Ye's girl
If she do, then I'll have to say, "No way, girl."
But it could be my old girl
I'd be cool with it. You already know, girl
It might be this girl that I'm texting
It might be this girl down in Texas
It might be this girl that is stressing
It might be I need to learn a lesson

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I mean I really want to know. I hate to harp on it
Where I'm gonna meet her?
You know I'm going to do everything in my power to keep her
I'mma show her off cause she's mine like Adidas
Every night when we go to bed, I'm going to hell her that I need her
My girl. My world
I mean aside from T-Swizzy, you're the one that caught my eye, girl
You're the one I think is fine, girl
You're the one for whom I'd die, girl
Just gotta fight, girl
Come get me. I'm your guy, girl
Will I live a dope life hotel'n?
Will I die tomorrow. no tellin'
Will I die tomorrow. no tellin'
Will I die tomorrow. no tellin'

[Chorus]
