[Intro: Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time (yeah!)
Been a minute since I pulled up outside (skrr, skrr)
Shut it down, yeah, you do that everytime (okay!)
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah (yeah!)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Work it like a stripper, yeah
But you not a stripper, yeah
Dog her down with ya, yeah
Work that nine to five with ya, yeah
After smoke a pound with ya

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Oh my (yeah!), on a vibe, what a wonderful time (it's lit!)
Hundred deep, all my niggas outside
Valet park when I pull up in the ride (yeah, yeah)
Oh it's late you might have to spend the night, yeah

[Verse 2: The Weeknd & Travis Scott]
Oh, I love my city lit at night, yeah (yah)
Oh, I love my bitches when they bite, yeah (yah)
Oh, let's call some up and let's get right, yeah (yah)
Ohhh (yeah!)
We just landed in your city, go time
Driving to the venue, like she's seeing no signs
She got all the passes, she don't ever do lines
Bust it like she's single, she ain't wasting no time (alright!)
You cannot record, that's for the show now (oh no!)
Leave your phone, you get that later on now (straight up!)
Pour that special drink that's for my throat now
And take a sip

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time
Been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, we do that everytime
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Work it like a stripper, yeah
But you not a stripper, yeah
Dog her down with ya, yeah
Work that nine to five with ya, yeah
After smoke a pound with ya

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Oh me, oh my
Why they wonderin' who the kid sleeping side?
I been up sleepless late nights
Override yeah, overdrive yeah
(Oh) Bag it, bag it up, just bag it up
Yeah, wanna try this one more again
I been on the edge (yah, yah)
Scoping through the lens
These thoughts is on my mind
Got me on the drive
Got me on the ride
To a wonderful time

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Travis Scott]
Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time (straight up!)
Been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, we do that everytime
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah (yeah!)
Oh my, what a wonderful time
Been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, you do that everytime
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah

[Post-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Work it like a stripper, yeah
But you not a stripper, yeah
Dog her down with ya, yeah
Work that nine to five with ya, yeah
After smoke a pound with ya, oh
