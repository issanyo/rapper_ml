[Verse 1]
Too close to see so much in love we stop breathing
Sweet history ain't enough to keep my heart beating
So many tears for you I sacrificed
Too many lies for you I justified
How can you stand there sayin you know who's to blame
How can you act like everything is OK?

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, oh
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And pretend we're not dyin'
One of us has gone to be
One of us is gonna be
A casualty

[Verse 2]
It's cold in here
And my heart still wants you to hold me, baby
You never hear
But when you with me I get so lonely
I see you talking but your lips don't make a sound
You see me crying but my tears don't hurt you now
How can you stand there sayin you know who's to blame
How can you act like everything is OK?

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, oh
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And pretend we're not dyin'
One of us has gone to be
One of us is gonna be
A casualty

[Bridge]
Breathe in, breathe out
Defeat that doubt
Over and over again
I stand there, too cold
Remember and I'd fall
Over and over again

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, oh
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And pretend we're not dyin'
One of us has gone to be
One of us is gonna be
A casualty

[Outro]
One of us has gone to be
One of us is gonna be
A casualty
