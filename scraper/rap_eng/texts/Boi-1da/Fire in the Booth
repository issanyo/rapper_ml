YO
Shoutout to all the man back home
Some real shit

YO
Yo my little bro, I hope you're doing well
What i'm going through is hell, and it don't seem real
And I can't hold it to myself, I'm sipping up a drink
And Freezing up at __, We gon' smoke it to the clouds
And just pray for the best, I can't keep doing tunes
I'm thinking about all the things that we used to do
That's why I find comfort in smoking weed in your room
I hope you don't feel all alone, cuz' I'll be with you soon bro
I miss you too much blud, they ain't been a tag team like us since
Legion and the doom, wish it was 3,2,1 and blast me to the moon
I'm grieving, don't ask me when I'm releasing a tune
Cuz' i just lost my best friend, the realest of bredrins
2real tell me that we wasn't destined, making our mums proud
I even stopped chilling with the wrong crowd
I wanna quit this music cause' it's long now
Any wrong how nuff' man never helped ya
These times grams and a voucher
But you never got to do it, alcohol has got me through it
All this skunk that I've been smoking, and I've been drunk for a month
And i ain't gassing, i ain't gassing, I ain't ever lying
Hope the man that done it blud, I hope you're feeling terrified
My boys loved depz, small heath had to ride, black tick certified
Blue tick verified, got me thinking where was I?
Now i ain't scared to die, thinkin' bout' death and how I'm prepared for mine
Bury me a g, when they put me in the sky, my heart bleeds, every time your mommy looks me in the eyes fammo
And that's pure love, not embarrassment, Shoulders still bruised, from when we had to carry him
There's no comparison, doing this for my mum, doing this for Alison, I'm doing this for all of yous
I'm doing this for Rea, Yeah, I'm doing it for Lou, I ain't doing this for me, fam, I'm doing this for you
I'ma do, I'ma do, till it can't be done, your spirits still here, but your heart beats gone
I know he felt safe, when I was by him, who ever said big boys don't cry was lying
Yeah, cuz' i'm the biggest here,  Wish that i could shed a tear
Took a trip up to a pier, just so that i could
Real talk
Shout out to my brudda' rosay, took me out the country, so we could chill the whole day
No way, i'd be lying, if i said I'm okay, and that's why on Friday's i try my best to go pray
Yeah, I know I'm a hypocrite, at least I'd admit to it
Saying how I feel, no not a little bit
Whole bottles empty, started with a little sip
Head starts spinning, when I think of it
Cream, you was only 18
And you was having up the scene, now you're gone, how you mean?
Ima do this for the team, they said it was a nightmare
But it started as a dream, yeah, your dream, our dream
Feels like i'm dreaming, you know why I'm here, and 2real's the reason
Yeah, 2real, who real, All i know is you real
Snowing on my back, I always knew the true real
I'll see you in the new world
Wait for me in paradise, People seeking fame off your name the little parasites
On a bag of hype, Blud it sends me mad at night, trynna' cause trouble on the road
So i can have a fight, going mad, I need help, panicking a free kelp, walking up and down
I've ended up in B12, We got kicked out of green house, my head lights are wrong
Cause it's dark in front of me now, inside I've had enough, but outside I'm acting tough
Cherish all the memories, in Amsterdam and Magaloff
We was meant to this together, without your strength and support, I can't do this my bredda
Cuz you're still that guy, yeah, you're still that fly
I'm still smoking, till I shouldn't feel that high
Yeah you're still the same, and you still killed the game, just another yute that was filled with pain
And it's a shame, and as long as i'm alive, I'm gonna carry out your name, till i see you again
My brudda, depzman rest in peace fam

Hooligan out 2014 that's my album, big up all my mandem
Big up d2, big up yaseen, big up the small heath mandem
Trust me, big up Charlie Sloth one more time, fire in the booth
Big opportunity, danno. 0121

Let me upon my mind and release some tensions
In beef i don't leave my bredrins, trynna' go hard for the next
10 years so when i'm old I don't need my pension, HMP you better free my henchmen
Role true, i'm gonna need my enterance
Don't like going on twitter no more, cuz depz's name, I see in my mentions
Fam i can't cope with it, yeah, i miss them times I smoke with him
Or link up and buss two joke with him, Now i'm upset and i can't hold it in
He was a younger me, I was an older him, bout a month i ain't been sobering
Na i don't wanna do this music ting, but this music ting is what i owe to him
I could quit music, but i probably won't help, I can't be out here, feeling sorry for my self
Need to provide for the ones that I ride for, don't wanna watch no Corry in the cell
Did this ting, yeah we did it by ourselves, from the road trips, to the studios
All those times you were chilling in my house, The times, the times, that I keep thinking about
Yeah, I'm lost without you, & it feels like i can't be a boss without you
Road to success in front of my face, and it feels like I can't make it across without you
Having flashbacks, at night thinking why couldn't that doctor help you?
Yeah, it's mad how things change, trust me it's insane
If i never done music, I'm trynna think where I'd be right now
Probably on the road, where drugs get sold
Watching about when i Leave my house
On these roads  you don't know who to trust
But in this music ting i'm due to bust
So dont ever try get rude to us
You think i'm a cuz i spray bars, my bredrins inside
On a ten stretch, & im pissed cause I was on a
Yeah, so don't talk bad if you ain't' hard
I'm getting all stressed cuz acting there
I'm trynna get rich, when he's in there
When he comes out, he's nice
Jesus Christ, I need to hold up things and make sure things are right
Yeah, i'm standing alone, Working so i won't answer my phone
Yeah i'm bad to the bone
Thinking about cause' your bad, cuz your bredrins there, but there's no-one there when you're alone
Yeah' i'm standing alone, These boys can't stand on my throne
You're mad, If i get locked tomorrow, then who's gonna look after your dad
Real talk
Cause' i only say what I live
Take a seat, get down with my history
My old man never showed me love, that's why he don't mean shit to me
Gotta succeed in life, rub it in his face, smug face with victory
Dont know whats written in the book no more, so the rest of my life is a mystery
Yo, when will it stop, miss them days getting sent to the shop
I was walking around, not a care in the world, but these days now I'm repenting to God
2 years back, I was sending a lot, now man will get aired like a vent in a crop
Nuff man try glamourise this life, but try glamourise when your friends in a box
Yo, when will it stop, got nuff bredrins getting sent down to the block
I don't wanna live that life, so I grip that mic' dont wanna be shotting out 10's on the block
Aid to the kids, we need to change these ways that we live
Don't you want a house? Don't you want a business
Yo i'm gonna stop taking the piss
Cuz not long ago i was low on pee's, bored of the mic
Two two's now i'm a lord of the mic
Give me a time and a place
We will try stay violate, thoughts of a fight
Sick of these yutes getting caught in a hype
Please stop acting a fool, There;s no-one there when your backs to a wall
Im a tell these yutes to go back to school, go and get your grades
Yutes in the ends, im'a set the pace
You don't know about life, I've been stressed for days
Story, ima write an extra page
Getting sawned out when i bun my haze
You know why, these days i've been thinking loads
Probably the reason i've been drinking loads
Got big things to accomplish
But i don't seem to close if I'm honest
Im a keep on trying
ACTIVATE no time for a lying
Wastemans send and i ain't replying
Cuz i don't wanna go pen, i'll fry him
YEAH I'M GROWING UP NOW
Invasion alert we're blowing up now
If a man wants it, I'll show him up now
When will it stop, my team will be the next to the top
So stop hating, thoughts about pen, no we're not racing
Trynna get rich, but the blocks raving
When will it stop
My team will be the next to the top
I tell a man that the leng is there
Thinking about cuz they're hench and stare
Fam i don't care if you're benching bare
