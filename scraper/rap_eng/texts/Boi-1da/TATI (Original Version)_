[Verse]
...stupid, I ain't stupid
Dummy boys fall in love with it, he stupid
All these hoes on my body, cut the bullshit
All these hoes, they ain't loyal, y'all lookin' stupid
I just left Starlets and I ain't even cash out
Back out, straight to the trap house, I blow her back out
Semi-automatics, they gon' get to clappin'
We ain't with the chattin', you lil' niggas cappin'
If we catch you lackin', turn you into has-beens
If he jacking TR3YWAY, then you know he EBK
Don't check in...
