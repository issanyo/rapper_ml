[Hook]
I pour my heart out and you take a shot
I pour my heart out and you take a shot, first

[Verse 1]
Don't say some shit that can't be reversed
Don't make me come and take your bitch, Amber alert
I can't even stand poppin' Xans with the Percs
Crystal's like a sand mix some tan with the purp
My dog said "God can't protect us" (Astaghfirullah)
Now he bring the hammer to church, bang
I can wear the work in my hands doe
You know you never handle the work, mane
Fuck all your pillow talk and the mud slinging
I grew up fighting and I came up swinging
Seen friends die over drug slinging
You got some nerve even bringing up your up-bringing
It ain't no secret how we feel about you, dog
Everybody know there's nothing real about you (you don't know)

[Hook]
I pull my heart out and you take a shot
I pull my heart out and you take a shot, look

[Verse 2]
When I'm with you's when I feel alone
On this road like I'm really home
Throwing money catching feelings for these silly hoes
Truth is before we ever met, I had a million goals
You wanna blame it on the drugs just a little of it
True all I did was get you high when you were feeling low
You could've had a Little Seoul like Korea town
And all you did was let it die in the bitter cold
Welcome to hell, welcome to hell bitch
Welcome to hell, I hope you feel at home
But first there's something you should really know
We could get fucked up but just don't fuck up the zone

[Bridge]
Maison, just don't fuck up the zone
Maison

[Hook]
I pull my heart out and you take a shot
I pull my heart out and you take a shot

[Verse 3]
Talking money bitch, I make a lot
Talking drugs, oh I take a lot
Now I'm the one to watch like it's one o'clock
They never gave me a shot, just my laser dot
I made you hot, yeah bitch I made you hot
Back when you was just a faded thought
Small fry, tater tot, dancin' on them table tops

[Bridge]
Maison, just don't fuck up the zone
Maison, just don't fuck up the zone
Maison, just don't fuck up the zone
Maison, but just don't fuck up the zone
Maison, just don't fuck up the zone
Maison
