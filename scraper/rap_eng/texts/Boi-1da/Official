[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, no no no
Woah
Looking out for you, babe, woah

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
You tell him you hanging with your girls
That ain’t who you gonna see
And as soon that you leave him, girl
You'll be calling me, yeah
No, I ain't saying to leave him, girl
But that ain’t there where you wanna be
Come and join me in my world

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
So you don’t have to be
Lying, cheating, flirting, out all night
Crying 'cause you're so afraid, to hurt him, yeah
I hate to be the one to say it’s over
But baby, you already heading over
So do us all a favor, you, him and me
And let’s make it official, oh yeah
Why don’t we make it official? Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
You can stay with me, let’s just do it right
I don’t wanna be, the nigga on the side
Your body already agrees
So let’s make it official
Why you so afraid, afraid of moving on?
If you don’t wanna let him go
You can let me know, whoa
And I’ll give you your space
Watch the tears fall down your face
Baby, I’ll do what it takes

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
So you don’t have to be
Lying, cheating, flirting, out all night
Crying 'cause you're so afraid, to hurt him, yeah
I hate to be the one to say it’s over
But baby, you already heading over
So do us all a favor, you, him and me
And let’s make it official, oh yeah
Why don’t we make it official? Oh yeah

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
You can stay with me, let’s just do it right
I don’t wanna be, the nigga on the side
Your body already agrees
So let’s make it official

[Verse 3: King Chip]
I am, one of a kind
Yes and you are all on my mind
Yes and we could be, havin' a helluva time
Without all the snoopin' around and lyin'
Told him you was goin' over your cousin’s house
Shit, more like over your future husband’s house
Had to see what this all old, creepy thug about
Tell that man you’re out, make you happy now

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Girl, let’s make it official, oh yeah
Why don’t we make it official? Oh yeah
You can stay with me, let’s just do it right
I don’t wanna be, the nigga on the side
Your body already agrees
So let’s make it official, official, official
Official, official, official, yeah
Just want you to be my girl, oh
Official, official, whoa, now
