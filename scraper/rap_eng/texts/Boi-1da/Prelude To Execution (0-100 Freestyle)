[Verse 1: Laron Pierce]
Its been a long time coming
On these beats so Ima make happen
Ima start executing these broke suckas
But this is the prelude to execution muthafuckas
Sick of y'all taking up space on this industry
Ima start turn my former friends to enemies
Rappers acting like king kong ain't got shit on me
What you talking about is nonsense on honesty
All you pussy broke suckas wanna talk shit
Get on the net get exposed like catfish
Most of these rappers be sounding so garbage
Ill Stomp the fuck out your head like Seth Rollins
Head drive my opponent to the ground
Have these suckas singing run it like chris brown
Go ahead start a war and I'll finish it
Ill cut head off and rip your brain inside of it

[Verse 2: Laron Pierce]
Ima make these ladies dance on this muthafucka
But you ain't gonna see me dance in the muthafucka
Murk these rappers on xxl on this muthafucka
Knock these rappers out with a chain in this muthafucka
Pierce go hard on this muthafucka
Rippin these bars as usual on this muthafucka
These rappers swing doors on this muthafucka
Getting yo ass whooped by solange on this muthafucka
Ima say it one more time on this muthafucka
Getting yo ass whooped by solange on this muthafucka
For real Laron Pierce know the deal
Don't fuck with me i have yo ass killed
Fuck boy I'm the J.J.E
I do this shit so fuck what you suppose to be
Im the real deal when its so lyrical
But every rapper in this game wanna be difficult

[Bridge: Laron Pierce]
Its been a long time coming
On these beats so Ima make happen
Ima start executing these broke suckas
But this is the prelude to execution muthafuckas
