Day job, unable to always show up
Grind for family, question "how the fuck imma gonna blow up/
Crushin me, almost gave up matter of fact
Brothers pushin me, i wonder if they only trust the half/
Of me, coz i am supposed to write raps
Other half says u gotta bring the family to riches from rags/
Caught up in a dilemma
Room for No excuse, so I quit the drama/
Isolated, wonder if I'm even a part of the race
Damn stuck in the cubical, am I even doing my chase/
Haunts me to even look forward
Desperate though, im a success pervert/
They say, to do the runnin, u gotta put’em right shoes on
Ain't even got laces, i run in my slip ons/
Hustlin, since they couldn't fathom, i can do it
Demons whisper to my future that i can’t pull it/
Stretched a mile in the shoes, they said I wouldn't fit
Nah, ain't gon be down in that damn pit/
Been a introvert, friends pushed like a propeller
That's the reason on this beat u hear me holla/
Tortured n toyed by many durin my struggle
No longer complaining now I'm that lost piece of the puzzle/
These rappers be like a 3 course meal for me
Eat'em over a beat, like it's a plate for me/
Bring contiguous hip hop like epidemic of plague maybe
Underground is the place I'd rather be/
Let my grind speak, n make noise, to deafen ur eardrums
Ain’t settling for mere pieces or bread crums/
Suckers dun have the balls to cheat on face
So I’m serving u clowns with some shit on face/
This is the way I flow, unapologetic, kinda steady, I bring the flow so heavy causing a crack in the chevy/
I ain't back bitching, said it all in yo face, already
Let’em angels come get me, I'm a hunnid % ready/
What the fuck u think held me from comin back?
Studied the game, prevented myself from droppin whack/
Hold it down, won't stop till they attend in majority
Won't let myself get misplaced in mediocrity/
Hand on my heart walk this fast lane n stay real
The boy from the bay, brings skills to pay the bills/
It’s like u reap what u sow, i ain't waiting for it to sprout
They takin shortcuts to success, I'm takin a scenic route/
Patiently waitin, never miss an opportunity to seize
Remember my words, as I'm steady pennin these prophesies/
Do it all on your own, if u want it,make moves
When they hold u down like the gravity, don't let loose/
Cz Time fades their feelins n the love that u seek
They Give u all they got, but take it back when u weak/

OUTRO:
They say I got ya back, bt where they are when you need?

Look into yourself, do u love the person you have become
Came too far, but didn't forget from where you begun/
When only you dreamed to shine bright as the sun
When only you believed for this shit, you the chosen one/
Headed up, controlled by gravity upside down
Still I don't see them turn that frown upside down/
Shit, I feel like im just trippin again, like raindrops from the clouds, im drippin again/
Embed these words in the song, ill with the pen im insane
Try n knock me down I'll rise again from the pain, its Lucid/

It's fucked up, music is the only way i escape from this fast life
I do this for the struggle that we all go thru
See I dun fear defeat
I fear not tryin at all
Maybe it'll lead us no where
Still we do it for the passion
We do it for the love
They say life's, a play
But imma play my part right
