[Verse]
I come around like what goes around
What goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down
Might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe
Last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down, bitch, get fucked with a volume knob
Fuck all you snobs
Hoes, I hope all you rot
Two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms
Is that all you brought? And you want a ménage à trois, you twats?
Fuck that, I'd rather turn this club to a bar-room brawl
Get rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech stuck in a vacuum y'all
Ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap
Yeah but I'm home, bad to the bone
Back in the zone, let him alone, you don't want to go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you own, crown so tight that it cuts off
Circulation to the brain, no oxygen
Other words, there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip-hop, Hitchcock of the shit, bitch ask Doc
Got it ziplocked in a bag, you fags ain't been able to fade me
Since Kid Rock had a high top, keep bloggin' while I mind-boggle
And I zone like I'm in the twilight, dog, get off my bone
This is my mic, doggonit; I like hoggin' it
Flow's so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganin', I'm waterloggin' it
I'm soggin' it, pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplexing it on cement
Like I'm on some "Straight Outta Compton" shit
Take this dick and chomp on it, I'm so bad I can bitch-slap
A back-handed compliment, jackass, eat a donkey dick
The game I just about conquered it
Like Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers, bitch
I'm the king of this honkey shit, I reign supreme in this honkey shit
No sense screaming and arguing, makes no difference
Whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamer's the car you in
You think you ball? Well, I palm it, I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy, I throw down in the kitchen
Might hit your mom with my omelette
But you got egg on your face, now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
Bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy, it's obvious
You can tell right off the bat
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do
And make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual and you can get whipped
She can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat or stay the fuck
Outta Hell's kitchen, I came to cock block like a square
Fucking male chicken, yeah, it's Shady, slut
The rest can suck on a big one
'Cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin'
