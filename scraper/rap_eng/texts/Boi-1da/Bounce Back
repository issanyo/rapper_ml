[Intro]
I got mine's too, boy
It's gon' be a hot summer, a very hot summer
Da Degrees, baby
Enzo, 'Rari time

[Verse 1]
The type of shit to make your life change up
If she twerking' right, she'll make you famous
But see me, I'll never give the game up
I know a lot of niggas out here changed up
But she be twerking' for a Birkin, need the Maybach with the curtain
See your whip, that's why you know that shawty workin'
And please don't talk to a nigga if you're hurtin'
'Cause she a boss bitch and that's for certain
Broke nigga? Nah, she don't want that
She know where the rich niggas at
Where my rich niggas in the back?
And where my rich bitches at?

[Hook (x2)]
Let me put the work in it, bounce back
If the head right, I'm about that
You make it look good when you wearing' all black
You remind me of the dope when I catch a contact
(Shorty gon' put the work in it, bounce back
If the head right, I'm about that
Put on for the hood when you wearing' all black
You remind me of the money, I can help you count that)

[Verse 2]
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em who you textin'
You got your own man, but still flexin'
I heard he livin' in the Westin
I hear she livin' with her best friend
She even drive in her man's Benz
And when that nigga call, she say she just friends
She so cold
And she be twerkin' it, twerking' it on the pole
I see work is a million miles away
But she got' travel there to get that pay
And bring it back to daddy, it's okay I mean, okay
Just sayin' she work hard, no playing

[Hook (x2)]
Let me put the work in it, bounce back
If the head right, I'm about that
You make it look good when you wearing' all black
You remind me of the dope when I catch a contact
(Shorty gon' put the work in it, bounce back
If the head right, I'm about that
Put on for the hood when you wearing' all black
You remind me of the money, I can help you count that)

[Outro (Lotto Max)]
Yeah, man
We workin' like a motha fucka
365, 366 on a leap year
10 Times, motha fucka
