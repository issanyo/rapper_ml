[Verse 1: Gangstalicious]
I'm okay I had a dream girl
Pop molly, sip lean girl
Your breath hot you need some Listerine girl
Why all these niggas tryna be me girl?
I roll (?) girl
1-2-3 girl
My name is Z-O-E girl
Zoe (?)

[Hook: Gangstalicious]
I will not die for you
So don't think I'll die for you
And I ride for you
But I'll roll a big spliff and I will get high with you
I just wanna take your panties off
I just wanna put this pipe in you
I wanna spend the night with you
So come over
Come over
So babygirl, come over
Come over

[Verse 2: Gangstalicious]
I'm her favorite nigga
Finger on the trigger
She like me cause my dick's much bigger
She bounce on it like she Tigger
Good pussy make me come quicker
Lick my Reese girl, baby suck my Snicker
Shorty stuck to me like a sticker
I'ma do this shit till I get richer
Stain a drug dealer
Woah
The drug dealer
I'll stain a drug dealer

[Hook: Gangstalicious]
I will not die for you
So don't think I'll die for you
And I ride for you
But I'll roll a big spliff and I will get high with you
I just wanna take your panties off
I just wanna put this pipe in you
I wanna spend the night with you
So come over
Come over
So babygirl, come over
Come over
