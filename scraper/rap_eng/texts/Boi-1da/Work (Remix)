[Intro: G Milano]
This for all my women though
(All the women)
This for all my women
(All my women)
This for all my women, tell my girl that I been sinning
I just hope that she forgive me
Though...

[Verse 1: G Milano]
I just want your love back
Fuck me with your heels on, meet me in the club back
Back of the club, she's hoping i really come
And she decided to leave as I was just pulling up
She decided that she would be better off on her own
Listening to her friends and they been single too long
I decided to ask, how women who never had
Someone they could call their own
Could feel like they know the half...
Nah they don't know the half, girl I did the math
Stop worrying bout yo ex for I dead the past
Cus a hater better pack when I'm in my bag
I'm as good as Mike Jack, when he feeling bad
Did you hear the man?
He must be really bad
Married to the industry, I took it by the fuckin hand
Cherish anniversaries, let Grammy's be the wedding band
You thought I should spice it up
Made a song that had a dance
Forever you and I forever
These other rappers only get as hot as march weather'
And in a few years we'll be living far betta'
Even help produce the kids
I'm the son of Pac and Big
Carefully choose, I'm the heir to the throne
I make music fit for kings
Y'all got ears to the throne
And even though your style changed
I'm here till' you're gone and
You don't get to trippin' cus ya..
Know fi' ah mawning' ah

[Hook: G Milano and Rihanna]
Work, work, work, work, work, work
Cus I be on my job
So I get up and Work, yea
I love the way your smile
Match your your brand new purse, yea
I sing it all the time
Yea that's my girl
