Reporting live from the gutter
Reporting live from the gutter, mayne
Reporting live from the gutter

[Verse 1: Lil Omi G]
Reporting live from the gutter
I always thank god for my mother
I do this just to show her I love her
Even if were alone we have each other
Now thinking way back, when we were just alone
Living in the cold but at least we had a home
We would get in arguments about me skipping like a stone
About me always on my phone
Being lazy like I'm bone
I would tell her I'm writing music it puts me in my zone
I don't even like school they tell me things that I've known
She would tell me "be careful I don't really like your tone"
I said "I would change by the time that I'm grown"
She said "I really hope you do
All I want is that you get through high school
Follow all the rules don't hang out with these fools"
I would say "They're my crew"
She said "If it was money or you, you know what they would choose?"
I never thought that it'd be true
I just assumed that everything would be cool
But out of the blue they turned their face like the moon
The anger I consumed
Set me up for my doom
It would come soon
I felt like I was trapped in a room
Like I just lost my mind
I left it behind
I just could not find
I guess I'm one of a kind
Because I'm in my prime (x2)

[Bridge: Lil Omi G]
Now watch me just shine
Now watch me just grind
They say money is the time
The deadline is at nine
I guess I'm paying a fine
I'm getting out of line
I'm taking what is rightfully mine
You can tell with the way that I grind
That I...

Oooo-oooo-oooh
Live from the gutter

[Verse 2: Forever Dyna]
Live from the gutter
Many places to another
Five races from mother
Too many thoughts, all clutter
Utter stress, get away from the view
Utter mess, shut the shutter, who knew
That this is what it would come to
Ultimately decided
This is safer for me
Seemingly guided
From those who can see
Started with my ABC’s
Moved up to the whole alphabet
Counting money like 123
And it hasn’t changed a bit
Quick wit and I’m proud to admit
Walked out of PE, mentally fit
Trick works so stick with it
Chair’s too inviting, I won’t sit
I got work to do, where my permit
I don’t have to cater to the likes of you
After all I been through
After all the words you never meant
Saying I’m fake 'cus of all the money spent
Being wealthy don’t mean I’m content
Not healthy but nobody wanna hear me vent
I’ve seen and went, disappear without consent
Not a single soul would notice, past or present
Everyone stole happiness, as a last present
More in store for me, worth less than a cent
Repent all my misdeeds and find a new lead
