[Intro: Travis Scott (Oktane)]
Party 101 (Yeah), party 101
Don't you bring that gun
Party 101, party 101
(It sounds exactly how it looks, look)
Party 101 (alright, okay, okay, okay)

[Verse 1: Oktane]
Okay, I'm cruising down the 101, I'm headed to the valley
Temperature out, 101, a hot ass day in Cali
Hit-Boy hit me up and said, "playboy let’s throw a party"
I hit up the squad and I said, "let’s get it started"
Had Caz call the chef, have her cook up while it’s zoomin'
I’mma send that group text, Willie get it boomin'
Couple girls called mad, said they coming by theyself
Mad at me, cause they done  got invited by somebody else
Gotta get that function orchestrated, just called in that liquor
On a truck, for your system, to get wasted with your sister
Y’all ain't sisters, stop playin', I'm lifted, I'm just sayin'
All them niggas know that it's models
So they ain't gettin' in without bottles, zoom

[Hook]
This is how you throw a party (party, party)
This is how you
This is how you, this
This is how you throw a party
This is how, how you throw a party
So give me some damn room and turn up the volume
So give me some damn room and turn up the volume
So give me some damn room and turn up the volume

[Verse 2: Price]
I wake up wired, thank the sire then pick my attire
Roll up some fire, send a flyer only to the fires (Pull up)
(You) Help me clear out all these couches
(You) Go and warn all the neighbors
Get the strap so they know we 'bout it
(You) Go and warn all the haters
Tell them "don't try tonight"
Cause we tryna keep the environment right (Don’t you do it)
She want me to come upstairs and beat it up
It just might be a riot tonight (I might do it)
Cause baby came with her bestie
Off Molly, they wanna molest me
Another pack just texted me
Plus my ex tryna impress me, damn
And the party packing fast
I’m giving out daps and dabs
Cats dropping cuts from the nineties
Thrashed, in the cut where you can find me
Girl Scout in my ashtray
All the pretty bitches shake it
Tight jeans, high waisted
Got the room saying

[Hook]
This is how you throw a party (party, party)
This is how you
This is how you, this
This is how you throw a party
This is how, how you throw a party
So give me some damn room and turn up the volume
So give me some damn room and turn up the volume
So give me some damn room and turn up the volume
So give me some damn room and turn up the volume

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Party 101, don't you bring that gun less you 'bout to do somethin'
Damn I'm way too drunk, just have a little fun
I'ma make her cum, I'ma rum-bum-bum-bum
On her tummy-tum-tum, gimme some, yeah
I need more drugs, need more funds
Yeah step up in this bitch make 'em run, make 'em run
Only trill ones, I'm the only one

[Refrain]
Party 101, party 101
Party 101, party 101
Party 101, party 101

[Outro 1]
Throw a party, party, party, party
Throw a party, party, party, party
Throw a party, playboy let's throw a party

[Outro 2]
From all in the H Town, on the way down
This is how you throw a party
Who tryna party? Throwing molly, going naughty
Who tryna party? Spilling liquor on her body
My kind of party
My kind of party
