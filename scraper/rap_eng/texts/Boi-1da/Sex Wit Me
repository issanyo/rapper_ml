[Intro: Fabolous]
She said I hope your sex game like your flex game, haha
Haha

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
When the flex is amazing, the sex is amazing
Bought her a chain 'cause the neck is amazing
I be on the grind but a woman need time
So she gotta get her Rolex for her patience
No, I can't call it, but I text on occasion
Know I’m pulling up for the sex invitation
All you gotta say is come fuck with me
And skrrt, you my next destination
I ain't thinkin' 'bout your ex situation
If he buggin' then it's extermination
Nigga onto the next lituation
I ain't trippin' so it's up next vacation (hol' up)
Suitcase packed with the new designer (hol' up)
Hopped on a plane and we departed
Walkin' round here like you Rihanna
Girl that ass is RiRi-tarded
She get finished and RiRi-started
Make that movie, I RiRi-cord it
I'ma level up for the RiRi-mix
Throw the alley-oop and RiRi caught it like

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things
Sex with me
Sex with me

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Make your body tingle, have it tingle
We do all positions and angles
Pussy got a nigga whipped, Django
Sweeter than some fresh fruit, mango
Get her body high 'cause I hang low
I'ma keep it comin' 'til she can't go
Chill room, summer like a strangle
She be jumpin' on my head like a Kangol
I kiss your lips, my lingo
She clean that pipe like draino
Wet walls, I ain't talkin' 'bout paint though
Nigga like the way you got anal
2-3-4 more times, can't go more
Bounce on that stick like pogo
Beast in the bed, go loco
Kill that pussy dead like Lobos
Oh no no, don't you ever go Ghost
Back it up on a nigga, low post
Dunkin' in the pussy like and-one
And she can't feel her legs so she can't run
Bluetooth 'cause she never put her hands on it
Hate pork but she love to go ham on it
So wet had to put a goddamn on it
Bring the beach to a nigga, no sand on it, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me
Sex with me
Sex with me

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Put that on everything, girl you gon' love that shit
Put your body on me, girl you gon' love that shit
I know I'm your favourite 'cause I'm so amazing
I know I'm your favourite from the way you taste it

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
You know I got the sauce, sauce, you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’ma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
