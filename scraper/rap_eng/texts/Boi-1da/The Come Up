[Intro: Bizzy Crook]
Yup, good luck good luck
Ayy ayy
No hard feelings

[Hook: Bizzy Crook]
Remember back then
Back when we was workin' every summer
They used to tell us we would never get it
Now they act like they forget it, don't sweat it
Hell nah you won't admit it now
We on the come up, yup
Now we on the come up
Dope boys never wait til summer
To pull up in that drop
Like you must of forgot
Oh you must have forgot
Said I'd never get never get hot boy
Look who on the come up
Now we on the come up
Dope boys never wait til summer

[Verse 1: Bizzy Crook]
Damn how the competition changed
How the competition changed
Now these bad bitches runnin' game
Bad bitches runnin' game
Better call your new girl and your ex girl
We bout to run a train
And they love it cuz we bout to run the gang
Fuck the penalty, they gon remember me
Good luck good luck good luck
Yeah that's what they kept tellin' me
Dropped outta college and I learned one thing
Fuck ya enemies, protect ya energy
Duck fake love, fuck fake friends
And we never care for you like we care bout them
Yeah shit, mama will complain
Sayin' she different, that shit changed
Bout to be young 22 with a Maserati
Funny how I ain't even do this shit to get paid
Rollin' with the same crew from 6th grade
Workin' like a nigga ain't never been laid
Some niggas want, some niggas what hoes
For me I need both
Cuz my type of bitches like niggas with dough
Say you bringin' out the drop in the summer time
But nigga for the summer time?
Real niggas do this shit all the time
RIP brodie, its [?]
I'm not comin' back, but this is the year of return

[Verse 2: Bizzy Crook]
I do this for the niggas in the beamers, dreamers
Provin' it could nobody believe us
Schemers could rather be anything but broke
And they go and get all they dirty money cleaned up
I did a lot today, its my time now
Flex bonds away
And when I get the crown I leave it tucked away
Cuz I'm just a humble king like [?]
You waitin' for the summer to come here
But damn, we already fucked her and her friend
I been so focused on doin' what I love
That I ain't even notice all the money comin' in
I guess I put it on my free time
But I don't even get no free time
I guess that mean I'm wrapped up like a bitch
If I quit right now still be fine
We just tryna eat
Nigga we just tryna eat
We don't want beef
But ain't shit sweet, nigga ain't shit sweet
The goal around me
I just don't hold it
If my niggas ain't roll it
Then I cannot smoke it
You hot in Miami
You jump in that ocean
But we out in Miami
My niggas is hot in the ocean
I just bought the yacht
Never tell me I cannot
Nigga I came from the block
A few of my niggas ain't make it to see this
I came from the bottom
I squeezed to the top
Now we on the come up
