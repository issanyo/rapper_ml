[Verse 1: JackBoi BooMain]
Lil Herb you's a fuck nigga

Wack eddie up nigga count them Digits
If the A chance let my team hit it

Pussy nigga loves gun play enough talk boi

[Verse 2: Lil Jay]
BDK
Pull on your block in full attack
We got 30s and we got Macs
Catch a opp then he getting stretched
Pop his ass like a fucking flat
Got the Mac-11 in my backpack
Yeah that bitch go rat-tat
Try to run, tear down your back
Clout Lord I can't go for that
30 blow like a fucking fan
Doing hits out a fucking van
Then get out the fucking jam
Like Lil Bibby when he fucking ran
Double 0 i'm the fucking man
Yeah I got pounds and I got grams
You can get taxed like Uncle Sam
And I do hits in my Timberlands
Do hits in my Nike Airs
Got a 30 on me I don't fight fair
Yeah my shooter with me and he right there
They got guns and semis shooting in the air
And catch a body and don't even care
Leave the pussy body anywhere
And i'm steady riding through their block
Why the pussy niggas never there?

[Verse 3: LakeSide Viet TBeastie]
Squad, squad, squad
Trixx, I don't really like Tricks
Got me feeling like I'm Jadakiss (braa braa)
If I catch a nigga camping all out imma bring him to his deathwish
