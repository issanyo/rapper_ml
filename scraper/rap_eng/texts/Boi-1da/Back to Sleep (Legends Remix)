[Intro: Chris Brown & Tank]
So let me fuck you back
Ooh, yeah, it's the general
Come on, kick it off one time, yeah, yeah, yeah
So let me fuck you back

[Verse 1: Tank]
Yeah, I'm kissing, I'm sweating, I'm licking all over your body
Yeah, who else gon' beat it like me? Keith Sweat, nobody
Yeah, he was good but I'm really nice
Yeah, you let me shoot a deep blank on his life
Yeah, he fell in love after only one night
Yeah, and then I ran off on that pussy twice (Oh, shit)
You always let me in, I got that slick talk
Keep that good wood on me, you loving that stick talk, stick talk
Used to think that we were so the same
I'm real R&B, these other niggas lame
I'ma wake it up, you got the cake batter
Shit, I'ma bake it up
Put you back to sleep, baby girl, no picture
No ho shit, cause I'm a real nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tank & Both]
Just let me rock (Let me rock, yeah)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl (Ooh), oh
Don't say a word, no, girl, don't you talk, oh yeah
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, ooh yeah, rock you back

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Both fell asleep looking so crazy, like blah blah blah
'Til 6 o'clock in the morning we was going in, like shots shots shots
Hit it from the back on my end tops
But now I'm sober, so baby girl, turn over, oh-woah
'Bout to go down, something like a drop top
Taste so sweet, I'll be calling that a Pop Tart (Oh)
Just let me rock
You get some sleep, I'll drive
Yeah, I'm pimping in it (Oh), 12 Play gang (Oh)
Gangsta leaning in it (Oh), going crazy (Oh)
I'm tweaking, get high off that dope pussy
Every time we freaking, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown, R. Kelly & Both]
Just let me rock, ooh, baby girl
I'ma fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh (Woah)
Don't say a word, no, don't you talk (Ooh), baby
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Oh, fuck you back to sleep, girl (Woah), rock you back (Ow!)

[Verse 3: Anthony Hamilton]
Hard for me to ignore, but I'm really all into you
Staring in your eyes, hugging on your waist like a man should
Can't wait for you to come over, let's get it started on the sofa
Hot thighs, long, strong loving, girl, I'm gonna put it on you
And I'm here to represent, girl
Leave you lying there shaking 'til you just can't take it
And I'm here to put it down, girl
Let me work on you, go to work on you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock (And let me love you, baby, oh yeah)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh
Don't say a word, no, girl, don't you talk (Ooh, ha!)
Just hold on tight to me, girl
I'll fuck you back to sleep, girl, and rock you back

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, gir, oh, yeah, yeahl)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Rock you back, oh)
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl, ooh)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
