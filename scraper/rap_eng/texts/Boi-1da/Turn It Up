[Verse 1]
My first
Birthday was '79, my first worse
Day: when daddy he died. Church on Sun-
Day and you know I would hide, momma dragged
Me I would put up a fight. Let's go
Back to the day when the schools would pray
When you were safe, no guns and rage. We played
Songs from M.J., Heal The World and ate great
I got to say hey, things sure have changed, but uh

[Chorus] (x2)
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live
We all need love so let us give
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live
We all need love so let us give

[Verse 2]
Well I can tell ye what you want love but won't like the outcome
I'd rather be a falcon flying over mountains
Drowning out the voices still doubting, shouting out to
God for a nation through was founded. People wanna
Steal, kill, destroy, try to fill a void
I wanna bring the joy like playing with toys
Joy still comes in the morning, good morning
Fear still comes to bring torment, torment?
I bet your bottom dollar you can still win tomorrow
And maybe the cup could still be won by Toronto
I heard Jesus Christ was a tough act to follow
And that we all die is a tough pill to swallow
We can say forget it and never go check it
You can write a letter but still never send it
Citizens living in fear come on now
Let this light manifest sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live
We all need love so let us give
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live
We all need love so let us give

[Verse 3]
You can go this way, that way, or that way
U-turn, to learn, we all got a have faith
Mayday were going down (down)
No we're not, man were trying to figure it out
About 2000 and something we'll all be wondering:
"Have we moved to Mars, and is the kingdom still coming in?"
Music is the voice of the people, the mind is a
Muscle to fight against evil work it out!

[Chorus]
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live
We all need love so let us give
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live
We all need love so let us give
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live
We all need love so let us give
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live
We all need love so let us give
So turn it up and sing this song a little louder
Shout it out like you got the power
We've only just begun to live

[Scratches]

[Outro]
In the city, in your nation, in your country
Most of all in your heart, y'all
That's where it all begins
Turn it up, one love
