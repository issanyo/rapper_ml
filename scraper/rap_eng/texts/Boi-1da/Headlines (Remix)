[Intro: T.I.]
Yea, Ha! Ok well
I suppose it's safe to say
This is the end for you
And the beginning for me

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm a real nigga, nothing artificial
I run with former drug dealers and they all official
I know you soft as tissue, so ain't no arguing wit you
Say its all fun and games 'til them bottles hit you
Get ya issue if you wanna I don't play it dawg
You don't wanna see them killers wit the K's dawg
Zone One Westside of the A dawg (Bankhead!)
You thinkin we some suckas, you was way off
I ball all night, go hard all day, balls deep up in your broad all day
"T.I. not fly," that's all yall say, big bankrolls and massage all day
Never mind they blasé, blasé, just menagé and parlay
With some Latin hotties, outta Hollywood in my Denali
Aye, flawless bodies, gorgeous faces, safe to say they goin places
Great head, wet pussy, touchin' bust or bases
Aye, shawty goin in, won't ever go away
And all that goin ape shit, ain't no need to tell em they know!

[Hook: Drake]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2: Drake]
I be yelling out, "Money over everything, money on my mind"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her, "I apologize, happened over time"
She says they miss the old Drake, girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like "why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like "All My Children"
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gonna hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it
They know

[Hook]

[Outro]
I be yelling out, "Money over everything, money on my mind"
Tell her, "I apologize, happened over time"
They know
