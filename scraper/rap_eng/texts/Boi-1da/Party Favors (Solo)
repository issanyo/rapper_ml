[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm the highest in the room
I feel like I could fucking kiss the moon
See shawty over there, bitch looking at me, she kinda cute
See a nigga over there, he's steamin' on up like ramen soup

[Pre-Hook]
I’ve been tripping, high off blue dream
Breathe into me, you know
Inhale, exhale, I'm so dizzy
They can't see me, I'm gone
Woah, oh, they don't go as hard as I do, oh
I brought some to the party for you, oh
I'll mix it up and serve it for you
Party favors for you
Party favors for you

[Hook]
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, yeah baby I got that special just for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you

[Verse 2]
Clouds of smoke are rising in the air
I feel their eyes when everybody stare
See a hater over there, they scheming on me cause I'm the truth
I'm with my homies over here and we ain't got no love for you

[Pre-Hook]
I’ve been tripping, high off blue dream
Breathe into me, you know
Inhale, exhale, I'm so dizzy
They can't see me, I'm gone
Woah, oh, they don't go as hard as I do, oh
I brought some to the party for you, oh
I'll mix it up and serve it for you
Party favors for you
Party favors for you

[Hook]
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, yeah baby I got that special just for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you

[Bridge]
What you lookin' for?
I got that for sure
Keep it on the low
Before it goes wrong
Hope we come down slow
Forget tomorrow

[Hook]
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, now baby I got that special just for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you
