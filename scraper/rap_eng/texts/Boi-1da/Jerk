[Verse 1: Riley Simon]
Oh! Oooooooh!
Im right on this spot
Although these niggas think i have moustache
I do without a trace
And i do a lotta change
Smoke a lotta drugs including Cocaine
Niggas dont tease girl just cheat
Bottles in the air and im having a good time
You know im just having a good time
With the girls getting dizzy and i think im gettin' doozy
Im back in the game, and I'mma really go insane
Blaaaah, yeah

Woka! Woka! Woka! Yeah!
Swagin in, we fuckin' in
I got the swagger now this is whats happening
We are the best, Alegators best

[Verse 2: Chris J Martian]
How y'all doing its CJ in the house
Back in the ghetto i was poor as a church mouse
My songs are played in the radio
Next time they will be played in Channel O
Niggas i just flow slow
This is just a fresh start
I dont do freestyle
Thats why i go beastmode
Then turn to a party pooper
Niggas i just go hard
Haters call the cops
Nigga you a snitch

[Verse 3: Shay's Nay]
You a jerk
I got a six pack
Check the tatoo on my back
Hell niggas im black

My girl like my track
All my cars are wrecked
Thousand chainz on my neck
Yeah! Im swimming in a champagne pool like a deck
Yeah i like when its done(yeah)
I whip it like Pac(yeah)
