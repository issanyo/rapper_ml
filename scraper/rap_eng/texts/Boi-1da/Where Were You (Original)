[Verse 1: Drake]
Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
(I love the line about the range with the rims to match)
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…

[Chorus: Drake & Colin Munroe]
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…

[Verse 2: Drake]
Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it'll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah

[Chorus: Drake & Colin Munroe]
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…
