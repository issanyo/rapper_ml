VERSE:
I know you say that as of right now yeah you got a man
And that the boy that you talking to is more than a friend
You so convinced that you ain’t ever feel this way before?
Our fire may have burnt out but it’s you I heat up for

Throwback to them nights that me and you would spend alone
Or all the countless hours blowing up each other’s phones
I’m embarrassed to admit it, I saw that you would kick it
With some dudes from round the block that didn’t wanna see me on

And if you asking me? Yeah I guess that he’s aight
But you a queen and shawty he just doesn’t see your light
I may not have a ring, but this crown is all yours
We share the rock cause we a team baby just like the Spurs

So don't cry baby I know it's been hard lately
Even through the distance I’ll protect your heart baby
And yeah, we could be a couple if you be the one to
Take my hand and be my boo cause baby girl I love you

VERSE:
So shawty stay with me, you know I be down to ride
Tryna find them feelings baby, seeking them but still you hide
The way you work it got me rambling to all my homies
Like "Dawg I know what I said, but shawty truly know me"

See girl? I swear that for you Imma do the most
Constantly be thinking 'bout you, peep the captions on my post
You raising eyebrows like champagne - no toast
When people ask "Yo, is she yours?" I say "Almost"

So what’s it gonna take? Cause I know you the one for me
10 when we together, you a 9 and I’m the 1 you need
So why we faking and delaying what is meant to be?
I ain’t from the hood but it’s you that brings out my inner G

See when it's just me, I'm thinking 'bout you
My thoughts revolve around my world so look around you
And Imma do my best, to deliver you the world
Pull up when you want cause in my heart I saved a spot girl
