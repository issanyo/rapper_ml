Yo I know I
I know I been a little past due for this shit
But I've been going through some shit
And I'm doing some shit

Yo I've been doing this thing for about a minute nigga
I know Milwaukee been looking like who the next to get
But to be honest there's only a hand full of us that been actually putting the work in Like we was bout the business
Like we was out here on them corners
Selling bars like they was rocks to all these savage niggas
Now to get back to business
I've been patiently waiting for this like I was Curtis
Waiting like em for the encore peeking from behind the curtains
But the highs ain't workin
So I'm on my lows hoping that they ride for certain
Before I die for searching
For a life that ain't guaranteed
I've been drinking so much and I know that it ain't fair to meee
And on top of it I see these other little average little stupid little cornballs getting it
With they polished nails and dresses on I know they managers are prolly sticking it
And it makes me sick
I could never let another man fuck me for the bucks that I make from what I spit
I would get
What go bang
From out the trunks
And run up on him while he hanging with his son
And blast him from the dirt that he's done
And leave him lying on the dirt when it's done
Leaving his child traumatized crying from the squirt from the gun
Thats goes for any one
That tries to play with the G
Don't you Eva Eva Eva try to play Wolverine
That's like, the same concept of you trying to play with you're life
You playing with mics
Is like a damn child trying to play with a knife
Deja Eso put it down cause that's a dangerous plight
Come run a track with me
And see how I'm much further than yall
It turns into like a crime scene the way I'm Murdering y'all
They way I end my verse to pass it off
Is like I'm serving a ball
So who you really know that's best in the mill?
Cause techs flex in the mill
Hope that vest protects your fucking chest in the mill
Cause I've been doing those contests for a while now
And all I've got to show for its a couple tracks with minimal vews up on my soundcloud
Known by a few in the mil as that wild child
I've been know to fuckin spaz quick and wild out
And snap in a second
And blast on a record
With this rapping appendage
Thats attached to appendix
Clearing out all of the wack shit that we gettin
You guessed it dawg it's time for a lesson
Put down your silly metaphors and similies
Cause y'all ain't half of the rapper half of a rapper than me
I'm like a father to y'all bars
Yall like attached to my knees
Carrying y'all like I was the star play of the team
Y'all play for the dream
Dawg I pray when the dream is gon stop
I play for the cream
I'm waking up to be the cream of the crop
Demons so stop praying on my downfall or im gon bring you some shots
Know what I mean?
I ain't talking about Jose or the Beam
I'm talking about those aimed at ya knees
40 Glock chromed stainless is free
I need the realest G's banging with me
I'm not talking bout the ones loud popping off at the mouths about some clout or how many Glock they popping out
I'm talking about the ones ready to put in that work after they clocking out
