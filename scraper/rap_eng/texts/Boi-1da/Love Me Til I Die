[Verse 1]
It feels like the time is slower than ever
I'm losing my cool
And in my mind I'm thinking when will I ever
Get closer to you
Way too far, way too far, way too far
That's the part I can't see it was getting hard
Could've at least shown where an angel be back where you are
Where you are, where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I need your love like yesterday
I need your love like yesterday
Spending time apart really helped me realize
You're my other half, just let our bodies free our mind
When we are together, yeah, you know it feels like
It don't get no better, just say it's forever

[Chorus]
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die

[Verse 2]
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder
Every time you leave it's a little reminder
Everything you need, yeah, you got it like that
Baby, bring my heart back

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I need your love like yesterday
I need your love like yesterday
Spending time apart really helped me realize
You're my other half, just let our bodies free our mind
When we are together, yeah, you know it feels like
It don't get no better, just say it's forever

[Chorus]
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die

[Bridge]
I'll be right here, baby don't hold back
Come and get all of this love
I'll be right here, baby don't hold back
Come and get all of this love
I'll be right here, baby don't hold back
Come and get all of this love
Get all of this love, get all of this love
I'll be right here, baby don't hold back
Come and get all of this love
I'll be right here, baby don't hold back
Come and get all of this love
I'll be right here, baby don't hold back
Come and get all of this love
Get all of this love, get all of this love

[Chorus]
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die
You know that I'm yours, love me till I die
