[Intro]
I hate my life

[Verse]
Thirty motherfucking thousand people
Now I got to call my fans
And I did it in a matter on months
Shit's got me feeling like the man, damn
Don't know how I did it, but I did it, now I'm here
30K in six months, I wonder where I'll be next year
Fuck a business plan, I am the plan
Got this game locked in my hand
Sick as shit, trying to spit this, and
Carve competition like a Christmas ham
"Yo, he's stealing Marshall's flow!"
White boys just don't wanna be slammed
I'm my own man, with my own style
And it's dope, so I don't got to pretend
Yeah, I've been the illest since puberty
Vocab like a professor, I'm immune to your scrutiny
Permanent like a tattoo: all you dudes can get used to me
And tell your motherfucking girlfriends they can stop sending nudes to me!
Yeah, I'm living life like I can't die now
Don't know if I've got limits, and I doubt that I'm ever gonna find out
Fuck a beat, I don't need that shit
Got beef, not a vegan, I'mma eat that shit
I'mma take it to the top, and I mean that shit
That's enough, bring the motherfucking beat back in
Yeah, class clown with that hot shit
'Bout to tear this game up like a tissue in a mosh pit!
You could not stop this, no matter how hard you tried to
Without an army twice the size of China right behind you
I'm fine-tuned
A rap machine outside of the mainstream rap regime
All these emcees just seem wack to me
I'll dispose of these has-beens happily
Yeah, you cannot touch me; I'm flawless
This rap game is my office
I'll show these cats who the boss is
Yeah, and I don't need a Beamer or a Benz or Bentley
To fill these kids with envy
Now they jealous, they resent me
Ever since I made my entry, they've been trying to push me out
Got me feeling like Chris Brown, like, "Bitch, look at me now!", wow
Style like James Dean, rebel with no cause, son
Now these ladies looking at me like I'm fucking awesome
And you must be on one, the way that you sweating me
Bars terminal, somebody get a medical remedy
Got an excellent recipe to bring death to my enemies
Call a deputy, my bars so sharp they sever extremities
All these cats trying to step to me, unaware of the penalties
I'll go back in time and give your fucking dad a vasectomy
