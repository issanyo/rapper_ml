Y'all was scared to admit it!

(INDIGO!)

[Verse]
I'm not a typical nigga
Rapping on a beat for the typical niggas
It's like everybody here never seeing the picture
Spittin' mediocre bars so I'm not fuckin' with ya
I don't wanna explain it
Praising the ignoramus
For this picture I painted
Will be one the greatest
Bet you any kind of money anybody complaining
Are the ones with my next mixtape steady playing
Hear the words wotds that  I'm saying
Hear the words that I'm speaking
Weird foing in, can't afford to be tweaking
FuckTypical, fuck nigga, I got me a reason
To be different and apathetic, the logic I'm teaching
Getting rid of my demons
I bury each of 'em alive in the cement
So they can see the type struggles I live
Coming from the evils they was oh so proud to give
Hear the gunshots that had put all the kids in fear
Taste the fuckin' dirt that was talked for many years
Fuck Claritin, I already see clear
Extraordinary, what the fuck is he doing here
Born a visionary with a dictionary
Brutally honest but necessary when the beat is ready
Album be dropping in January, maybe Febuary
If the game not in a cemetery, thta be too scary
Flow too scary
Flow too scary
I'm going back to old one cuz this one's kinda fuckin' ordinary
But who said a nigga was finished
This that Pro Era, Ratt Pack, Indigo, SAVEMONEY, Black Hippy, Royalty
Nigga try to fuck with me
I'ma be the best so everybody can fucking be
So everybody can fucking see
The next generation they was ready to meet
Steady mad cuz they can't see ahead
But their logic is dead, cuz of shit that was read
Cuz of shit that was said
I know you heard things
I know you're hurting
I know you're hurting
Cuz of shit that was said, Iknow you jeard things
But I don't give two fucks
No fucks given
I'm just tryna live the fucking life I was given
FuckTypical, real shit that I'm spittin'
Revolutionary, you can call me John Lennon
Better fucking yet, call a nigga Bruce Willis
Yippie kay yyay, dying hard the buisness
Indigo Squad muthafucka, wwe past the limit
Sophomoric flow, it's kinda fucin' gimmick
Gone!
