[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I love my team, I'll die for them niggas
Hating ass niggas in my circle, had to cut em out
Gold diggin ass bitches, fuck em then it's fuck em all
Had my niggas locked down, so I'm screaming fuck the law
Strap on, clip bent, riding in the Cadillac
Jack boys looking at me, and they know I ain't having that
Let them niggas pump you up, Like you just had an asthma attack
I'll Hit You With That Rat-ta-tat, Bowww
We just like the Mafia, body ya
Break the Code of Silence, and we gon Illuminati ya
Pull up in that black thing, Phantom of the Opera
We be selling fish scales, just to make Tilapia
I be up all night, chasing down them Benjamins
You should see this money, all these pretty hoes I'm swimmin in
Walk onto the stage, singing "Not Afraid" by Eminem
Take me to the boss bitch, I don't deal with middle men

[Hook: Drake]
Im about whatever man, fuck what they talking about
Their opinions doesn't count, We the only thing that matters Ooowww, and we do it how we do it
All up in my face man I hate to put you through it
I be up all night whole crew in here
And I don't really know if Ima lose this year
Man I love my team, man I love my team
I'll die for them niggas Ooowww

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
If Omelly tell me fuck her, Ima fuck her
And if my nigga like I swear to God that I won't touch her
Cause loyalty is everything, them niggas is like my brothers
If you don't see me with them everyday, mostly likely I don't trust em, so fuck em
Ima North Side nigga, with a South Side attitude
Got the streets already, know I'm coming to take the avenues
Broke them niggas love
But when you get money they get mad at you
Like why Tip ain't sign you yet?
Cause I ain't never ask him to, ahhhhhhh
Just look at my wrist (Bling)
You look like that and I look like this
I'm looking Rozayish and you looking like Chris
Old played out ass nigga, hating on me broke bitch
It's whatever mane, fuck what they talking bout
Niggas diss me in they rap, see me and try to talk it out
I just look em in they eyes, ain't shit too talk about
'Cause if we catch em without the crowd, we gon chalk 'em out

[Hook: Drake]
Im about whatever man, fuck what they talking about
Their opinions doesn't count, We the only thing that matters Ooowww, and we do it how we do it
All up in my face man I hate to put you through it
I be up all night whole crew in here
And I don't really know if Ima lose this year
Man I love my team, man I love my team
I'll die for them niggas Ooowww
