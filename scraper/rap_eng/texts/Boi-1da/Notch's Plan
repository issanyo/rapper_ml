[Intro]
And I'm crafting' and crafting' and crafting' and crafting'
You're bad at crafting

[Verse 1]
I been tamin' wolfs, don't try to feed my doggies
Tryna play on hardcore ain't a struggle for me
Donâ€™t mine down while in the end, you'll fall down and bleed
You know that I love it when my emeralds are green
I don't eat a soup mushroom to feel glee
Yes, I have dolphins and they're swimin' with me
Hope I got some vil'gers that trade with me
They gon' sell some armor, chainmail all over me

Chorus 1]
Notch's plan, Notch's plan
I hold sword, never I don't, yuh
I wear gold, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I eat apples that are gold, ayy, gold
Might go down a J.E.B., yeah, Jeb
I farm all the cows and sheep, yuh, wait
I eat bread and you eat wheat

[Post-Chorus]
And still
Crafting
I'm the God of crafting
And I'm crafting' and crafting' and crafting' and crafting'
You're bad at crafting
You're bad
Really bad at dabbing
And I'm dabbing' and dabbing' and dabbing' and dabbing'
I'm dabbing all day
Yuh, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
Steve say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my sword and my creepa, I'm sorry
Diamond club, I even got it crafted on me
Iron blocks, they live in village to make gollies
And you will bleed
Turn the old tool into the new breed, brah
Sword and Armor , Notch made Minecraft for me
Imagine if I never hit my first tree

[Chorus 2]
Notch's plan, Notch's plan
I kill dragon all alone, ayy, woah, ayy
Someone watchin' clorox show, yep, yo
I've hit trees since Notch was born, ayy, born, ayy
Might go down a J.E.B., yeah, Jeb
I farm all the cows and sheep, yuh, wait
I eat bread and you eat wheat

[Post-Chorus]
And still
Crafting
I'm the God of crafting
And I'm crafting' and crafting' and crafting' and crafting'
I'm crafting all day
You're bad
Really bad at dabbing
And I'm dabbing' and dabbing' and dabbing' and dabbing'
You're bad at dabbing
Yeah
