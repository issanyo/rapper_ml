[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Round of applause baby, you should take a bow
Why don't you soak it up, just like a paper towel
I travel round the world, I never stay in town
You never kick or fuss, you never make a sound
'Cause of my situation, it's hard to take you out
That's why I put my all in when I lay you down
Haha, and I'm cheeky but she never stop me
And they say if you gonna do it you should do it properly
Baby you're my superstition
You be doing things to me that ain't even in your tradition
And you're always playing your position
You pick what happens next, baby it's your decision

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
I'm so addicted
To your lovin' and I need a fix yeah
Everytime we get a moment I'm on it
Everytime we get a moment I'm on it
Every second I be thinkin' 'bout you
Yeah, I be thinkin' 'bout you
Everytime we get a moment I'm on it, yeah, yeah

Wayo, wayo, wayo, wayo, way (Yes, aha)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, there's only two ways this is gonna go
You're either gonna end up with me or you're gonna go
And I ain't tryna leave ya feeling insecure and vulnerable
So I ain't gonna front or hide the feelings that I wanna show
You got me actin' kinda different with ya
I must admit, I'm kinda smitten with ya
And every time you come to mine and start cleanin' shit up
I can maybe one day see me livin' with ya
You know you got a winner when your mother miss her
I think you the spittin' image of your mother's younger pictures
You ain't ever round no other nigga
You a bad chick, ain't nobody fuckin' with ya

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
I'm so addicted
To your lovin' and I need a fix yeah
Everytime we get a moment I'm on it
Everytime we get a moment I'm on it
Every second I be thinkin' 'bout you

Everytime we get a moment I'm on it, yeah, yeah

Yo you're like a drug, you the one I fiend on
When I need a shoulder baby you the one I lean on

And every time I need a fix, yo you're like a pill
You know how to make me feel better 'cause you're ill
