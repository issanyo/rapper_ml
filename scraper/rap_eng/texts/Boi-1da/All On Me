[Verse 1]
What if rap wouldn't have worked for me
I can't say I never thought about it
Planning for a rainy day and its partly cloudy
Not going back to the gutta I will not allow it
I got dirt on my hands my momma's not the proudest
I never danced with the devil couple close encounters
I could rap about a Bentley and yacht in Maui
But I'm really in the trap strapped like a Saudi
In a Crown Vic not a Audi
No black card neither my credit lousy
Call this trap nigga outreach
I can't imagine what they would do without me...me

[Hook]
I'm ready for war
As long as I'm here I'm a give it my all
And I can't win if I'm afraid of a lost
No I'm not perfect I'm perfectly flawed
Then it's all on me yeah it's all on me
Cause I gotta fam and they all gotta eat
And I don't make it work then we all in the street
So it's all on me shit its all on me
Cause I got seeds and they got needs
I'm on my feet ain't a damn thing free
So it's all on me

[Verse 2]
Until the wheels break off
We ain't at the top till' all the bills paid off
Hoping that this fuckin' record deal pays off
Coming for my cut like a steel chainsaw
Trapped like a real caged dog
Nine phone lines God still ain't called
Hole in my heart shit still ain't thawed
Gotta book full of problems tryna deal wit em all
And no I don't advise you to get involved
For the record I am not even a Lil Biggie Smalls
Taste my own medicine I'll heal from the scars
I'm just waiting on this pill to dissolve...me

[Hook]
I'm ready for war
As long as I'm here I'm a give it my all
And I can't win if I'm afraid of a lost
No I'm not perfect I'm perfectly flawed
Then it's all on me yeah it's all on me
Cause I gotta fam and they all gotta eat
And I don't make it work then we all in the street
So it's all on me shit its all on me
Cause I got seeds and they got needs
I'm on my feet ain't a damn thing free
So it's all on me

[Verse 3]
Glad you entertained by my bruises
As if my life is for your amusement
I call it pain y'all call it music
It don't matter to you as long as I produce hits
But what do I tell Jaylen if I shoot and miss
Aw well daddy ought to be used to bricks
From chucking don green to 106
And I can fall back to the bottom just as quick
The word rest is in the dictionary next to quit
And if I quit even I would think less of Chris
Waking up taking my pistol with me just to piss
Preparing for the unexpected shit....me

[Hook]
I'm ready for war
As long as I'm here I'm a give it my all
And I can't win if I'm afraid of a lost
No I'm not perfect I'm perfectly flawed
Then it's all on me yeah it's all on me
Cause I gotta fam and they all gotta eat
And I don't make it work then we all in the street
So it's all on me shit its all on me
Cause I got seeds and they got needs
I'm on my feet ain't a damn thing free
So it's all on me
