(Verse 1)

6:55 minus 3 in Seattle
Russell passed the check and then I took it for the battle
Had them, looking for a reason just to sign me
I'm real, it's not that I ain't want it, it's that I'm trying to be
And crying because, I saw the truth from a liar
Repping with his choir, spitting game, I'm spitting fire
Friar Lawrence told me to go for what I love
Now I'm running for the freedom, cause I'll never find enough
But I'm pacing in my room, chasing thoughts, erasing wrongs
Printing half hearted lyrics for my songs
Nocturnal's the tape, I'm gonna mix
Can't sell it, but hell if that shit don't make me rich
Pass the marker, pop the cap, scribble the letter to you
Knew there'd come a day when I'd remember me and you were
Something like a prize, I saw it in your eyes
Can't let it go but now it's just a memory in the sky
And I know it hurts, but stars glisten
See them in the night and now its time I make you listen
That's another reason, that I'm afraid to say it's over
There's just so many things I feel I have that I could show her
And, This is my story, these are my fans
I'm traumatized, it's the last chance
This is my story, these are my fans
I'm traumatized that this may be my last chance

(Hook)

I know, I know, I know, I know know
I know, I know, I know, I know...

(Verse 2)

Riding off into Charlotte, calling up old Harlots
They say blood is blue inside, I'll prove to you that it's scarlet
Rain tapping on my window, telling me that it's simple
Telling me that it's mine in a minute, but now it's them (Oh wait)
Ringing in my pocket, I got it
Brothers bitching at each other, turns out one of them socked him
Popped him up in the face, blood is all on the carpet
I told you I'd prove to you that the blood is as red as scarlet
(Shirts) were both ripped and holy, finish the phrase with moly
Tell 'em the reason that they hate each other is cause they know me
Truth hurts, so do fists
And me and Slug ain't the first to say this
But it's crazy how the money and the honey's ain't involved
And it's crazy how the world could save me, hate me, make me lost
And it's crazy that I'm taking on this world on my own
But it's crazy I'm gonna take it and run it until I'm gone (yeah)

(Hook)

(Verse 3)

Man my life just kills
I started from the bottom, now I'm underground as well
QSJ played my songs on the air
A couple thousand listened but not a one of them cared
I don't, give a damn about the money or the hoes
Or the fame, just the game, I'm jumping like Derrick Rose
I guess it it means, that I'm crippled
Sorry D, that ain't a Diss is just that this is not simple
I'm given a chance, a shot to earn
Respect, and show that while I'm good, I got a learn
But for now, I think it pays just to fight
All I need is four and a half minutes and one mic
Right, go on get me some trouble
Teachers told me smile, but they brought me more struggle
Shoot eleven in the sky, constellations arise
No matter how my life changes, I'll always be traumatized

(Hook)
