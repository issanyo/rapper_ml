Watch cha muhfuckin mouth
Bout to be the hottest thing
Since the bass hit the south
Yeah I know it hurt
Cause we ran up in ya house
And we took everything
& the change in ya couch
Yea I did it first
And we did it worse
Bout to hit cha with the Hearst
Deading scenes
& we came for the thirst
For the bling
Finer things
And yall bitches
Cause they twerk
I'll admit it
I'll admit it
I'm too worried bout the bitch
Cause if it ain't mine
When it's her time
She gon do another nigga dick
I'll admit it
I'll admit it
Imma keep hitting my swisha
Cause when you Michael
You just might go
I ain't worried bout a pippen
I'll admit it
I'll admit it
I gotta lotta love for you niggas
But on this road
Ain't no room fo
Talking drugs & ya hittas
Got a ninna
Named Tina
She ain't fuckin wit you niggas
If ya keep on
She gon turn on
And start squirting at chu niggas
I hear the talk on lord
Cause he the shit right now
But if you touch me boy
Fuck around and get hit right now
Click
Clack
Pow
No gun sound
Trying to Subtract
Bob from digitals
We 5
You one
Surround
33 ain't old
Running circles on the road
10 mil by 35
His story unfold
You can Get it here Sold
Cause the game not told
Trying to get it for the low
Over there you can go
I'm about to set a new thang
I'm about to set a new thang
10k for the showcase
They gon be like
Muhfucka you changed

For the flirting
& They need Back pats
For the burbing
Speak cause they heard things
Bitch I know you heard things
