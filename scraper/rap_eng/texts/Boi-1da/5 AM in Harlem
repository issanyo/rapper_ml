You're now tuning in to greatness
Should be making theme music for the Matrix
Instead I'm on this beat losing it, the basics
You know how we do it, I'm from St. Nich
Hey, bitch, I'm still the same dip
But I'm straight pissed, these niggas ain't shit
I hate Riff, I tell her lay and quit
Take me off your playlist, I ain't the on to play with
Nah, I'm from the era of the bars
Even the mellow know it ain't get no better than JR
I'm peddling the hard pebbles in a jog
Need a pack come and check itinh the God, facts
How could you think we are like?
I'm as potent as a smoke you go to get from The Heights
That's loud raw, what you flipping is light
Call it foul, boy, you ain't pitching it right
Right, I'm from the home of Richard Porter, Alimo
I was born to get the order, pass and go
Daddy-o, catch me in El Barrio
Peas with no patio, D's in the patty though
These niggas have to know, I'm a Diplomat
That mean I'm good anywhere I go to get it at
Don't be thinking rap, you can Twitter that
Only bird you ever touched was a Twitter app
And that's been a fact, where you huste, huh?
You ain't built like that, who your muscle, huh?
You get killed like that, wanna tussle, huh?
You gone feel my gats, here's a couple, huh
That's why I show none of y'all respect
Feeling like the first time they brung me up to Flex
Hungry for a check so I'm dunking on your neck
Hopping out the spur when my dunking's on your neck
How you want it, holmes?
I know exactly how you got my fucking number, holmes
It's in your mother phone, leave me the fuck alone
I ain't wanna bone
But it's okay, see, she gave the thunder dome
Don't talk to me, pay first
Early with the crack, it's all in a day's work
Pearly kind of gat, you talking, that thing squirt
Like the herb you go to snatch, you're all gonna taste dirt
I be out in orbit when I write
Have your bitch logging on to Orbitz for a flight
Start talking to me nice or don't talk to me, I'm nice
What you thought I lost it over night? Motherfucker
Cake run, I'm going for ten mill
Ask about the kid, I can broker you your next deal
I'm dead real, R is a veteran
They should make me the president, the R is development
I show you how it feels to be great
Walk in and get a quarter mill for a tape
Let's separate the real from the fake
Only the real can relate
I'mma tell you how it feel to your face
It's thunder or nothing, double or fronting
Besides that ain't nothing else up for discussion
Shit is broom brazy to J
Two words: can't wait, new tape on the way
