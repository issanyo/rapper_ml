[Pat Chorus Verse #1]

I fell, like soldiers on the front line
Under your spell, in the magic you inspire
Every farewell, sets me on fire
And I find it all so funny
Like a joke without a punchline


Hook

My heart's racing, trying to catch up to you
The light that you let off is gold
I can't shake this feeling it fills the room
These chills didn't come from the cold
They came from you
They came from you


[Pat Chorus Verse #2]

I hear your voice like an ocean
Washing over me I'm frozen stuck in time
And I swear, I never seen the likes of you before
And I promise this ain't difficult, doesn't happen every night


Hook

My heart's racing, trying to catch up to you
The light that you let off is gold
I can't shake this feeling it fills the room
These chills didn't come from the cold
They came from you
They came from you

My world came crashing down right under you
These chills didn't come from the cold
They came from you


[Pat Rap Verse]

See I was doing my own thing 'till you came across my path
Made me feel like singing, but usually I rap
But how can I explain the things you do to me
I'm acting all the proper words and phrases
Hold up lemme get back to that
Because I'm awe struck, star struck
Turned around from my heart, look
Let you know that from bar one
You are the one and that's bar none
I'll try the best to control myself
At least that's what I told myself
But inside I just bought a farm
You're the one that just sold that house
Got my heart in that headlock
I'm holding on and you hold the belt
I mean this in the best way when I tell you that you're cold as hell
That makes no sense, but neither does this feeling
I know that my time is short, but next to you, I touch the ceiling


Hook

My heart's racing, trying to catch up to you
The light that you let off is gold
I can't shake this feeling it fills the room
These chills didn't come from the cold
They came from you
They came from you

My came crashing down right under you
These chills didn't come from the cold
They came from you
