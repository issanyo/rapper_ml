Always knew this would be gold
Ever since I met you in coach in yo fur pink coat
And then I hit it that night, I was somebody who kissed you
Fucked around and missed you

You need somebody to teach you

When I'm callin callin
I don't ever get you get you
For someone so perfect perfect
I wonder what you been through been through
Cus we've got some problems
And we've all got issues
But you just need somebody
Need somebody to miss you

She she she got some kind of stress and stuff
She need a couple dots to connect herself
And she can't find the way to respect herself
And she's all out of people she can text for help
But the switch to her lips will probably through you off
Have you think that she's the one to go and show you off
She wanna push me away, I just wanted to try
You need to call over my phones, but I dial cause

When I'm callin callin
I don't ever get you get you
For someone so perfect perfect
I wonder what you been through been through
Cus we've got some problems
And we've all got issues
But you just need somebody
Need somebody to miss you
