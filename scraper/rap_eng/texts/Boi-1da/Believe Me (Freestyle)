Yeah
I'm The Only one to get the job done
All the others only get hired cause they are their son
You don't take it serious but then you get fired begging on the couch for Obama to raise unemployment benefits

Hook:
Seriously
Believe Me (x2)
Kurt, Kurt Kurt Rock

Verse 1:

Working so i can get started
Making a mixtape just for the sport of rapping
Then I hope i get some good support from it
I don't know 100% people will like it so screw it
Yeah i know i'm white and i don't give a crap
Wait a little bit and i'll be all over the map
Going to a show where i can rap

Hook:
[Bridge 1:]
I want them talking in the streets about me (whispering Kurt Rock twice)

Verse 2:

I'll get out when i'm 21 and go get a Glock, AR-15, AK-47, and a concealed carry permit
I'll carry one for the hell of it
Or maybe for self-defense
If the pigs come i might have to jump the fence
I might be the only one left with some common sense

[Bridge 2:]
I don't care if you think less
Of me
[Hook:]

Verse 3:
Working so i can get a band started
Get us mainstream, so we can hear them scream
Hear me, hear us, hear them
Get us famous so we can get some cheese
Jeas we'll be rolling in them Benjamins
I have a little brother and his name is Benjamin

Hook:
Believe Me
Really
Believe Me (x2)

Verse 4:
Not on speed or weed just adrenaline
If I overdose you can never see me again
Im just joking, joking
I can never overdose like weed

LeBron James went to the cavs he just beat the heat
Chris "Dumb-Face" Bosh is going to the Houston Rockets
Dwayne Wade is good but he couldn't lead a team

Bridge 3:
Truthly (x2)

Verse 5:
Hustling so i can make me something
I want my career to shoot off like I pressed a button

Bridge 4:
More Likely, Most Likely

Hook:
Believe Me (x4)
