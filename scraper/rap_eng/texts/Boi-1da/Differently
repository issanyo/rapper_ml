[Verse 1: Samantha Gongol]
I know this story
I know it well
Know how much you miss him
I can see how far you fell
I know about her
I know she's new
But try to see it from a different point of view
I know you want to see his face
And I know what you wanna say:

[Chorus: Samantha Gongol]
"Tell me, does she kiss like me?
Do you wish that we ended differently?
C'mon
Tell me, can she sing like me?
She a king like me?
Are you lost at sea? I know
Tell me, is she there like me?
Do you care that she runs around till 3, do ya?
Tell me, are you missing me?
Do you wish that we ended differently?"

[Verse 2: Samantha Gongol]
You say she's basic
That might be true
But you don't know her and she's not concerned with you
It's all about him
He hasn't grown
And we both know you're so much better on your own
So let him watch you walk away
I never want to hear you say:

[Chorus: Samantha Gongol]
"Tell me, does she kiss like me?
Do you wish that we ended differently?
C'mon
Tell me, can she sing like me?
She a king like me?
Are you lost at sea? I know
Tell me, is she there like me?
Do you care that she runs around till 3, do ya?
Tell me, are you missing me?
Do you wish that we ended differently?"

Think about it differently

[Bridge: Samantha Gongol]
So let him watch you walk away
And if he stops you, you can say:

[Alternate Chorus: Samantha Gongol]
"I can see you're missing me
And you wish that we ended differently, uh-huh
Even if she sings like me, she's a king like me
You'll be lost at sea, I know
You were never there for me
And I'm sure she'll see what a fool you'll be
We know
Even if you're missing me
I don't wish that we ended differently"

Think about it differently
