[intro:]
Today we are here to memorize the life of Marcel Marcus Jackson Jr

[Verse 1:YM]
Ok got a pound of cake actaully alot more never wanted beef cause i turn a beef into a war
Started from the bottom now i got something to stand for i got alot but want alot more ticking time bomb and can't defuse it yeah the fuse was lit ain't no defusing shit cause this for the trials and tribulations and these other rappers wanna feature but our lifes has no relations they dont know what i been through the hell my nigga young guapa or marcel got his bell dinged now im trying to redeem myself and all the other things
Like the sins and mistakes got my niggas afraid and i say dont let your past effect the future man i can't stay calm cause of all the fucking rumors
Wish i could understand sooner that hate when u are balling like hoosiers and u well protected thanks to shooters have to fight life like mayweather u ask my how i been i said ive been better niggas mad cause u got more cheddar alot fresher and your the fucking aggressor whoever wanted some would get some and then my career ejaculated like cum my nigga young guapa im happy about him he had a good run but we could have ran the game like usaine cut my self dont feel no pain am i human or am i insane do i have post tramatic stress cause all the death i witness
On some niggas hitlist another year is another chapter written in my book of life and im living it pick up the knife and put it down smiling to stay on my feet not the strongest nigga but i won't allow defeat and now hes as hard as concrete but for some reason he feels uncomplete like some one took an eraser and erased his fate and gave it to his nigga and u was in a crowd of whales and u was as small as a chinchilla but now im as big as the kraken call my niggas up like whats good whats cracken rest in peace guapa my nigga was tooken in the drive by i just stood ready to die
Now i got gold like a pirate was the shy nigga now hes the quite after the death he felt determined that he would carry the burden
Throw it down and burn it and laugh while its burning he courage to stand up cause he never gave up now u the chef of the trap kitchen
Cause u made one fucking desicion to not dissapear like a fucking magician damn maybe life does have a reason now i have all my fucking freedom
