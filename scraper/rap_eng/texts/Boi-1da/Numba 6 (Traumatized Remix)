[Verse 1:]
It really hurt me when they killed Red
Looking at my brother dead in this hospital bed
With his eyes wide open, not a breath in his body
Standing right by his door, his momma sitting right beside me
She was crying, I was crying
Lida crying, precious crying, lexis crying [?]
To tell the truth I felt like dying deep inside
Shit is killing me nigga, you ain't feeling me nigga
You only act like you do, cause you fearing me nigga
I swear to god, shit is making me lose faith
I'm watching my own video just to see your face
Still can't believe you're gone, shit feels so fake
But this shit so real it make you feel like it ain't
I remember all them days, fighting over dice games
Get cracked, call black, get right, get back [?]
Real nigga, he remain to the end, stays the same
Same real ass nigga carry foes to his grave
I don't know if you all know, motherfucker but I do
He was with the hustle gang, I ain't talking no Akoo
We was on that murder shit, guns loaded, slide through
Get back to the land that them niggas ride through
It's a homicide, fuck you mean? I go hard for my team nigga
Glock 40, flashlight with the beam
And when I run into his killer, I'mma kill you nigga
Make your momma feel the pain his momma feel lil nigga, yeah

[Hook:]
And when I run into his killer, I'mma kill you nigga
Make your momma feel the pain his momma feel lil nigga
RIP Numba 6, big bro you are truly missed
We ain’t riding round trappin boa we riding with them sticks

[Verse 2:]
Nights get rainy, clouds get darker
Guns getting loaded, knifes getting sharper
Getting ready for war, no mercy, no love
I want you to see my face, no mask, no gloves
So you can look me in my eyes while you die nigga
I watch your get cold while you fry nigga
I swear to god I wanna see your momma cry nigga
Just to look all in her face and go, nah nigga
Yeah them cold words coming from a lost soul
Be this way to the end, meet me at the crossroad
Niggas like, what do you want, cause they turn into some hoes
Saying, when it's about money, only time we hit they phone
When it's for the same cause nigga, you ain't go no balls nigga
Okay I see, you think you bigger then these lost niggas
Niggas ain't no shit, when shit hits the fan
What type of pussy nigga don't ride for they mans
Fuck you saying, huh?

[Hook:]
And when I run into his killer, I'mma kill you nigga
Make your momma feel the pain his momma feel lil nigga
RIP Numba 6, big bro you are truly missed
We ain’t riding round trappin boa we riding with them sticks

[Verse 3:]
I got homies doing 40, who can never see they kids
Brothers in the dirt, I can never see again
They ask me how I feel, just look me in my eyes
Way filled up with with pain, you don't even see me cry
No more tears, swear this shit get harder by the year
Got an angel on my shoulder but this devil in my ear
Say fuck them niggas, kill them all, leave them dead
Me and Red ran the streets until they pronounced my bro dead
Ten shots break his heart, like he just lost his lover
Through life long friends, no I'm just like a brother
Treat them, just like brothers, love them, just like brothers
We rebelled on the streets
And this bitch was like our mother
And we still riding around with the glizzy
Catch a nigga, take him down if he ain't looking [?]
I remember vividly, a lot of memories
Now when I say your name, it's just love and memory
RIP to my bro nigga

[Hook:]
And when I run into his killer, I'mma kill you nigga
Make your momma feel the pain his momma feel lil nigga
RIP Numba 6, big bro you are truly missed
We ain’t riding round trappin boa we riding with them sticks
