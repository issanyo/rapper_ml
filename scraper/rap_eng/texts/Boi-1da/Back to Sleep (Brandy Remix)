[Intro: Chris Brown & Brandy]
So let me fuck you back
So let me fuck you back
You

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I know it's late, I know it's late
And baby I can't focus, focus
I just flew in, in town today
I'm hoping that you notice, did you notice?
I just posted my landing, oh
Wondering if the same old understanding, stands

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know you got work pretty early, I'll be around 'bout 3:30
Usually you done by one, so baby, when I wake you up, up, up

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock, fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh
Don't say a word, no, no, don't you talk (Oh, yeah)
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, rock you back

[Verse 2: Brandy]
You got my whole mind frame feeling out of focus
And now I'm seeing things I ain't never noticed in you
And if you make me feel like nothing else matters
And your love got caught up in a rapture
And if you still sure in the morning after
I want it in the morning after, you
Baby, I can tell it's real, not surfaced
And we fell in love on purpose
Let me ride, I need your body, yeah
Uh-huh, sweet, come down
Just you, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hold on tight to me
Sweet, rock you back, back, back
And your love got caught up in a rapture
And if you still sure in the morning after
I want it in the morning after, you
Baby, I can tell it's real, not surfaced
And we fell in love on purpose
Let me ride, I need your body, yeah
Uh-huh, sweet, come down

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (No)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Hey!)
I know you want me, and you feel me (Feel me) 'cause you never disagree
So when you wake from your sleep, girl

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Brandy & Both]
Just let me rock (Let me love you, baby, oh yeah)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh (Come down)
Don't say a word, no, no, don't you talk (Oh, oh, oh)
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, and rock you back

[Outro: Chris Brown & Brandy]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Rock you back, oh)
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl, ooh)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
Let me rock, yeah
Uh-huh, sweet, come down
