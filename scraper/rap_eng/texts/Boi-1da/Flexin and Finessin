[Hook]
Flexin', flexin'
I be flexin', flexin' and finessin'
Flexin', flexin'
I be flexin', flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'

[Verse 1]
Smokin' on this loud, I be higher than a cloud (dope)
Turn up, turn up, turn up, smokin' kush by the pound
Shoutout to TA, that's my mothafuckin' round
Fuck around with them fuck arounds, you fuck around and get laid down
Flexin' on these niggas, I be stuntin' like it's nothin' (swish)
All my niggas crazy, they shoot guns up like it's nothin' (bow)
Came up from the bottom, I turn nothin' into somethin'
I ain't worried 'bout no ho because these commas steady comin'

[Hook]
Flexin', flexin'
I be flexin', flexin' and finessin'
Flexin', flexin'
I be flexin', flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'

[Verse 2]
Always stayed the same, nigga I will never fall
All these racks on me, I swear my money never fold
Black on black Camaro, I be speedin' past these hoes (Skrrrt)
Nigga run around, my niggas pop you in the throat (bang)
You ain't tryna fuck, bitch, the door is over there (bye bye)
All these bad bitches, man this shit is just unfair
Fuck nigga mad, but guess what, I don't really care (you mad?)
Flexin' and finessin', throwin' money in the air (yeah)

[Hook]
Flexin', flexin'
I be flexin', flexin' and finessin'
Flexin', flexin'

Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
Flexin' and finessin', I be flexin' and finessin'
