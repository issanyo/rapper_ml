[Verse 1]
I woke up in the morning and I phoned my B
Then hit the store then I made some hits
For my parents please do not trip
Could be worse, I could be hittin’ licks
Now I gotta hit the road
It’s time to do another show
Can't complain it's the life I chose
I left the cold all for the gold
I took a trip out to ATL
To put some money in my ATM
Sippin’ like I made a man
Awards at the Adrian
Maybe that my life now
I’ll get you what you like now
I got the juice, don’t get hype now
I got the juice, don’t get hype now

[Hook]
Got the juice (whooooooo)
Got the juice (whooooooo)
Got the juice (whooooooo)
Got the juice (whooooooo)

[Post-Hook]
I got the Space Jam serum in my bottle
Everybody all want a sip
They can’t understand how I got it
I see them out thirstin’ for a drip
I got the Space Jam syrup in my bottle
Everybody all want a sip
They can’t understand how I got it
I see them out thirstin’ for a drip
But they know, yeah they know

[Verse 2]
Boy I got the juice, I sure make the news
It’s a murder scene every time I’m with the crew
Watch your 18 like it’s 2002
I should cop a Coupe, sittin’ on 22s
Rockin’ all white ’cause I’m K-K-Killin’ ya
Coming to America, feeling like Arsenio
Or maybe like Eddie though, cause I’m feeling like a prince Lookin’ at your face, I’m feelin’ like you pissed, aye
In a minute I'll have Minute Maid
That’s the juice, I’ll serve you with some lemonade
That’s the truth, nothin’ sweet, so your face all up in screw
You must not heard the news, that the woe in the crew

[Hook]
Got the juice (whooooooo)
Got the juice (whooooooo)
Got the juice (whooooooo)
Got the juice (whooooooo)

I got the Space Jam serum in my bottle

I got the Space Jam syrup in my bottle
Everybody all want a sip

I see them out thirstin’ for a drip
But they know, yeah they know
