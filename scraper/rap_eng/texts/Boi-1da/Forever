[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
I can see it in their face that they want me to fall
Cause all the little bad bitches I be fucking them all
I want this shit forever
Haters tried to take my life and stop my heart but I'm too clever
Kill me never
Haters trying to prosper
They just want to be me but couldn't see me with binoculars
Rapping ass niggas built for T.V. need an Oscar
I'm not talking De La Hoya but if I was then I'd be Hopkins
First name strongest, last name stronger
Flow so cold listen to it catch Pneumonia
Diesel in the air we don't touch the Arizona
Diamond studded yellow Breitling
Looking like Corona, or Homer
The face blue and yellow like Melo
And my chain multi-colors looking like its frozen jello
Hello, steady eating money for a meal
Drinking Ros√© for a beverage
Let me get some leverage
When I was locked down I was million dollar schemin'
Rolls Royce dreaming
Microphone fiending, I mean it
Hungry like its Ramadan I'm dining
And I ain't mug-meanin' but God keep me breathing
Nineteen years old in the hole
Watching my dreams shatter and praying that all of my goals
Don't fade away like fourth quarter pass to 23
I go hard like I took Viagra before I got the beat
