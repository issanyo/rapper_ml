[Intro: YTN Doog]
Ayy, yuh
Whole lot of gang shit

[Chorus: YTN Doog]
Niggas know not to fuck with the gang
'Cause they ass is smoked
Big black .40 on me I'ma let it poke
My niggas neighborhood, I stayed in the kitchen though
Bullets penetrate his skin, yeah, his ass is smoked
In the gang T'd up, yeah, we go fo' sho'
What's up wit' it Ke?

[Verse 1: YTN Ke]
Ayy
These niggas be talkin', these niggas be dissin'

These niggas is fake, man, niggas set trippin'
Free KFresh, big C's, he was crippin'
Shorty love my ride, she love the way I'm drippin'
Tryna take over, [?] Scottie Pippen
Niggas tryna beef, yeah, money what I'm gettin'
I'm stackin' and flippin', you want it, come get it
You try to rob me, boy, that's a no-no
I'm chasin' that money, you chasin' them hoes
Shout-out to V-Go, he gettin' the dough
No wintertime, [?] you know that I'm cold
Summertime, lil' Ke hot as the heat
Alarm clock set 'cause I'm fallin' asleep
Yeah, I'm next, wake up, this ain't a dream
2417, yeah, that's where I be
If you lookin' for me, it ain't hard to find me

Niggas say they real but really they not
Is you niggas mad, I got money and thots
Or is you niggas mad I got hoes and guap

[Chorus: YTN Doog & YTN Waundoe]
Niggas know not to fuck with the gang
'Cause they ass is smoked
Big black .40 on me I'ma let it poke
My niggas neighborhood, I stayed in the kitchen though
(What's up wit' it Waundoe?)
Ayy
Bullets penetrate his skin, yeah, his ass is smoked

[Verse 2: YTN Waundoe]
Me and my niggas, we stay wit' them sticks
Up it and bust it, put holes in your 'fit
