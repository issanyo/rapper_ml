Damn...

Damn, You ain't have to do me like that
Left me for dead I sweat and bled for you thats a fact
Rumours spread what ya said nobody keep it a stack
Rather get stabbed in the front than to get stabbed in the back
Caught up in a lie all through a hug or dap
I couldn't see it through the eye the hole time it was a trap
They learn you just to hurt you in need of miseducation
They dread it when you score when u miss they celebrating
Embracing the Lord's vibrations they dwell with satan
Presently its one day at a time the gift of patience
Learn to see both sides like fuck a racist
Crowded in the peace makes the zone feel spacious
Been betrayed, been played, Lets call a spade a spade
Check the hand I was dealt the diamond tester on the phrase
Became a lyricist to liberate the pain
Open soul in a frame i'm empathic on the page
I been writing the aura of the author in darkness just tryna see the light in tomorrow, either way its a struggle, I guess its Joe Budden
I'm just a numb young old nigga tryna make you feel something
You could sense the truth I sware you get a chill from it
And the fuck shit at a high we need a chill button
Give em what they ask for and they still fronting
Give em less then what they want they probably steal something...
My heart cold still find a way to spill it
Cup half full half empty am I wrong for tryna fill it?
Figured if i'd give it all away it's less to deal with
Or conceal but you can't reveal
Unaware of how hurt I really was
It caught up to me and I ain't even try to run
Forgive and forget I guess Love is Love
Love is pain, love is pure, love is all of the above
Whats a beautiful vibe with a hideous mug?
Whats a pretty face that won't put down the drug?
I guess love could get you killed and I hate how I feel
So when they hate I bless em up because the karma installed
And they shooting like target practice like dramas a drill
And Dali could die as long as Dot got to heal
But if the pain would subside would I wash away the ills...
Submerged in the truth a verse so real
Pressure busting pipes and I'm searching for the breakthrough
Family...Faces...Who could relate to???
Life's a bitch untamable dog change you
Recreate your own lane the limits that they paint for you
Yea I made a mistake or two I ain't blaming you
Now the glass house is so unbreakable
Redirect whats restraining you and progress in obtainable
I give it my all and I won't ask shit back
The pen mightier than he sword and I could lift that
But the pain I really can't mask that
Ronde on the corner came back with a half back
I am my brothers keeper my daughter gonna be a leader
Just had a son you gotta see em
And I keep growing I refuse to be stuck
Moving in the right direction using faith and gave it trust
