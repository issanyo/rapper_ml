Sway this is a dream of mine
Before I even rhyme
I don't want to be defined by these rhyme scheme of mine
They put me in a box labeled "too ahead of his freaking time"
Too complex, they don't look deep inside
17 designed with a genius mind
That could teach the blind to see a fly
On a piece of lined paper in a secret shrine 80 million feet behind
They ain't gon see my piece of mind
They gon see this piece of mine
Wait, that ain't me, hold the questions
The radio told me this is cool, not a weapon
Boom
No hate, but every spitter who's next
I'm the grim reaper reaping the benefits of your death
Watching me grow and I'm finally here they're dying because it
I'ma shit on your career, that's why you gon plummet
Token the fly and beloved
That's got a nice ring to it like a Golddigger supplied by your husband
Only rhymer who does it
Without a mind that is functioned
To be designed as a puppet
I'ma climb to the summit
Grind till the sun is declining inside the Horizon and I am aligned with O'Ryan at night in the sky and above it
Rappers all over the Internet say that I'm being too rapity-rap but wait till you hear the project, you will see I can adjust it
I have been summoned, to bring this music back, the cocoon just cracked to the butterflies in their stomach
But they don't want me to drop this mixtape
They want me to follow this way
What the contract dictate
But right now I'm just trying to go off for shit sake
And hear Heather B say talk your shit sway
Real shit
And I believe in my craft
Sacrifice my childhood ask my people in mass
I'm used to getting mad left at sway
Bring my backpack backstage
And pass class that way
I do my Spanish project when I plan of content
I do my English essay when I'm scripting with the pen game
I do my course of math when I record the track
Physics when I mix it
I do my world history when a groupie girl's kissing me
No time to waste, I don't ignore the time, I never did
You might be forming rhymes better than a fortified specialist
But you prioritize horrendous with performance like a negligent unorganized special kid
This shit is sort of, kind of effortless
When I don't mortify and horrify with penmanship
The war and crime of organized terrorists
Will borderline be normalized, respected and
Supported by our lord and Christ and president
I import this penmanship
For the poor dependent kids
Who purely pessimist
I pour expression with
My portrait pencil just
To explore the precipice
Of pure impressiveness
That's P's. At ease
Everyone got their opinion but Token don't listen to anyone who don't be working as rigorous as me
Everyone saying that they can do better, if you can do better then please do it better then come to me after, but you show everyone here that you this fucking nasty
I don't believe you. You're thinking's wrong
Them cribs, cars, trips, broads won't last long with no wisdom dawg
We ain't the same, you tripping dawg
That's a fabric of your imagination, we cut from a different cloth
But I reload this penmanship
Like I'm refilling a clip to blow the premises
You could take pictures with a gun just to be posting every flick
You still couldn't pose a threat with this
I control my nemesis
They just puppets, I pull strings like an organ specialist
Wanting to beat me is like watching a Bill O'Riley Rush Limbaugh debate in hopes to grow intelligence
Ain't happening. Peers ain't fathom this
You hear that I'm slacking it's hearsay, blasphemous
All my fan here ain't arrogant
Cuz my tracks open minds like severe brain damages
And I'm a be the first man leading the swarm
Of people spit in the face of everybody who calls themselves an MC but can't even perform
Your fans leave through the door when you go, but when I go
I'm antagonizing the show again
Grabbing mics I am vulgar and
Classified as a chauvinist
Asinine inappropriate
Rapper, writer, vocalist
Battle like I'm Napoleon
Half these rhymes are nowhere as
Agonizing as Token is
My appetite has a rose and these
Average minded opponents are
Appetizing I'm going in
Acting like you're the dopest but
Talent wise, I'm the ultimate
A mastermind, a patch of ice ain't cold as this
My heart is as black as all my attire
Rappers always require
Passion tossed in the dryer
Dad and mom are right by ya
But acting all like a fighter
You tell em they're sick you're a pathological liar
And I ain't finished
I am smarter than 99 percent of every guy you witnessed
Windshield wiper's kicking when I will finish a brainstorm, they're driving in it
So intellectually strong with every rhyme I've written
I could punch a wall, make hieroglyphics
Like I'm Egyptian
You tried but didn't divide the vision of my devision
Inside my skin it is kinda frigid
My own lyrics are stylistically cryogenic
Christ, it's crisis a crime you witness
But I'm the syllabic monster
You'll get schooled more than disciplined scholar
Who's dissing this? I ain't a little bit bothered
You ain't internet bloggers you some twitter shit talkers
You ain't spitting shit proper
Your punch lines, corny, your flow can get a bit awkward
I'll show you how to do this like a generous father
I follow the bar codes like an interested shopper
Call the intellect doctor, I'm sick in the head
Sit in my bed, gripping a pen a limitless author
I'll write forever I work lightly? Never
I work till tare a wrist like an Isis member
I'm so clever when I see letters my mind is pleasured
And pressured to bring 'em right together
Chop 'em up like a knife or blender or slicer shredder
And make a rhyme scheme better than 99 percent of the guys who enter
You're like a feather I will sever
Your career gon be shorter than my temper when hearing you rhyme, remember
These rhymes are wild and I'm the shepherd
Life defines my effort so I grind like Ryan Sheckler
Sway I never came here clueless
My first song sounded like a page cleared by Shakespeare's student
Do it till I got a great beard like I may steer the reindeer's movement
17 and started the same year you did
See, this my life, my manager told me cherish the moment
You haven't been a kid in years, it's apparent you know it
But I'm good, you never seen a kid so there and so focused
That's shy I'm raising profit like marry and Joseph
But to be honest, this bragging shit is worthless
I don't know about you but I got a bigger purpose
You say "fuck the world" but your revelation is pointless
You say "freedom of speech" but
My generation is voiceless
And I'm tired of it. And they not help
You won't love yourself until you are yourself and you are not yourself
Avoidance is a drug
You can't post your whole fucking life on Instagram and expect not to be judged
We vulnerable, we all just vulnerable
But my bucket list will always be full
I'm never satisfied I never had to lie I never havenâ€™t grinded for the team of mine
I'm finally here
And sway this was a dream of mine
