[Intro-King Libra]
We don't live off the hype way
Baltimore
Libra
Down the hill

[Verse 1-King Libra]
East side
Ddh
Where I’m From
Got a couple bars
Only drop some
Couple fake niggas
But they get no love
Niggas mean mugging
They don't really want none
They ain't making no noise
Talking bout they shooting niggas
Where the clip though
Talking bout they killing niggas
They ain't really bout it though
Too trill
Keeping shit real
Really bout to cut niggas
Just cause I feel
Niggas think they that trapping
Selling just candy
Niggas running off the plug
And pockets real empty
Might hit a lick
Might fuck ya bitch
Might take her back to the crib and make ya film
Bout to start putting niggas out on blast
Don't give a fuck
Want a bad bitch
Like she peed on the rug
Usually I don’t contain foolery
Baby they using me
If i don't be addressing these niggas
I'm killing these niggas
Not friends with these niggas
They fake as shit nigga
If i'm dapping these niggas
I'm plastic my nigga
I'm bigger my nigga
They small to me nigga
Thug life in the county
You a clown to me nigga
You columbia niggas
Ain't got shit on me nigga
What you think that you  about it homie
I know these niggas better stop playing on me
I’m rick grimes and steph curry wit the shot
I pop pop pop pop
If you take shots at my block
Suspect niggas getting pushed back on sight
Taking for granted
That is why i am spazzing
Never slipping
And never panic
The quiet ones go insane
Better throw some respeck on my name

[Hook-King Libra]
Ugh
Look what they made me do
I heard it over and over again
It was never sounding just right
They love to talk
Me, I’m just dunning the hype
Me, I’m just dunning the hype
Me, I’m just done
Done Done Done Done

[Verse 2-King Libra]
God damn
Man these niggas jaded
I knew they hate it
Tried to hit me with that bullshit
But I’m in the matrix
I penetrate it
Never doubt myself for a second
I know imma make it
Right from the basement
Young kings over everything
That’s legendary homie
Team lit yeah
Libra wit the beats
Marhi wit heat
Zahny he sing
Nigga my crew looking three black jonas
City like gotham can't find no lois’s
I got it
I got it
I got it
Word to my mama
From the bottom I promise
I see jealousy mama and i’m just being honest
They sent threats to the boy and I’m just being honest
All of the talking is just gossip
Gossiping niggas
They talk like they bout it
You hear a lot more
When you moving in silence
They want spot right next to me
Silly nigga you can't get right next to me
Way too many hoes standing next to me
I hate a goofy especially
I’m not showing niggas no empathy
Done with the fake shit it's killing me
These niggas going die out eventually
Come to my city it’s rest in peace
Shout out to taeo yeah YPC
Shout out to zuriel that's my G
Lotta y'all niggas wanna be friends with me
I hate some of these niggas especially
They always dying to mention me
You can not get it how I get it please
Please no don't not ask for the recipe
They gotta go
They gotta go

[Hook-King Libra]
Ugh
Look what they made me do
I heard it over and over again
It was never sounding just right
They love to talk
Me, I’m just dunning the hype
Me, I’m just dunning the hype
Me, I’m just done
Done Done Done Done
