Part I: Party Hard

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I just need one more dance
And girl, I hate this feeling but it's not going away, I think I'm in love with you
And I can't help myself cause this may be the only chance I've got with you
And I know you gon' show off

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
She likes all them stripper poles, like taking off her clothes
And when you work that girl, you stop my heart

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She's got the perfect lips, the perfect body
She's the life of the party and she likes to party hard
She's such a rock'n'roller but exotic
She's the life of my party, she likes to party hard
She's spilling your drinks on me, living wild and free
Tonight, girl, change my life
I hope you put your lips on me, my mind's playing tricks on me
Tonight we gon' party hard

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
I see straight through your eyes
And girl you might as well just say what you're already thinking cause we on the same page
Take me to ecstasy and far beyond, show me how you have your fun, baby
And girl, we got all night

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
She likes all them stripper poles, like taking off her clothes
And when you work that girl, you stop my heart

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She's got the perfect lips, the perfect body
She's the life of the party and she likes to party hard
She's such a rock'n'roller but exotic
She's the life of my party, she likes to party hard
She's spilling your drinks on me, living wild and free
Tonight, girl, change my life
I hope you put your lips on me, my mind's playing tricks on me
Tonight we gon' party hard

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Can I take your hand?
Can I have a dance with you?
And when we touch
It's like magic and fireworks

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She's got the perfect lips, the perfect body
She's the life of the party and she likes to party hard
She's such a rock'n'roller but exotic
She's the life of my party, she likes to party hard
She's spilling your drinks on me, living wild and free
Tonight, girl, change my life
I hope you put your lips on me, my mind's playing tricks on me
Tonight we gon' party hard



Part II: Cadillac (Interlude)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
In my cadillac moving very fast, got a girl with a big 'ol ass
And we go ho hunna, gonna have a good time
Anything she want, she can get it cause my girl, she be with it
And I want her for the rest of my life

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I love to hear her say that she loves me
I love it when she tells me she needs me
And when she looks in my eyes
It feels like I'm high

[Verse 2: Sevyn]
It don't take a lot, all I need is you to be the man for me
But I want it all and I'm willing to give you what I need
Baby I ain't scared to show you that freaky side of me
Sometimes I fight you off, but I love it rough, when you make love to me

[Chorus: Sevyn]
I love it when he say that he love me
And I love it when he tells me that he needs me
When he looks in my eyes
It feels like I'm high
