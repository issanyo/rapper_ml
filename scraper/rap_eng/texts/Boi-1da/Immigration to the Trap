[Intro]
"Yazan did you deliver the shipment?
Okay good, what about the money?!
May god banish your good health."

[Verse]
Uh, look, immigration to the trap
Generations to adapt
Life sentence in my lap
Now vacations overlap
Still I'm pacin', won't relax
Invitations to relapse
Inspiration through the raps
Watch what I say on the track
Statute of limitation on my back
Investigations comin' up, interrogations never crack
No chiroprac-, Baccarat with the keys, benjamins in the backpack
Impatient off the 'yak
I made a mill' for each year, of education that I lack
Faded in the back 'till I fade to black, bitch I'm wavy to the max
Four Arabs in the truck, location on the map
No patience for the fuck shit, ovation when they clap
Got pale by the pail, Sarah Palin in the trap
Makin' sales out the back, we still mailin' out the packs
They still sailin' on my wave, piggy backin' off the raps
Biggie taught me how to snap
Drugs work until I tweak
Bloodthirsty, I'm a beast
Birds are surely in the seat
They go for 30 and up (dirty dirty in my cup)
Can't get dirty from this mud
Never early if I'm up
Black Suburban in the cut
Wrapped up, Goyard shit like a turban on my skull

[Outro]
Immigration to the trap
Generations to adapt
Mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap
Immigration to the trap
Generations to adapt
Mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap, mumble rap
