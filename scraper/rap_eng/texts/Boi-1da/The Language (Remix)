[Intro]
I got it from here. Royal Fam Remix. Ima just do me on this joint

[Verse 1]
Look!
You niggas same all that you do
You niggas you talking too much
You dope but you hate on the crew
I give two fucks
MTV still play my jams, catch me on BET chillin’
My name sound good, rollin’ of off the tongue
Of Angela Simmons, oh what a feeling
Something like dropping the pill
The juice or recruiting no ceiling
Fooling with women whenever they ask me to save
I just say I’m the new super villian
Who am I kidding I’m too into sinning
No time to lose ‘cause I’m too into winning
Stay with some cheese, ‘cause I’m too integrating
Shawty with you she act too independent
I just might sign em my nikes of designer
Well big bootie bitches no need to me greater
Literally fire, don’t get burnt, young maryland niggas in the house get turned
Tities in the middle of your blouse bitch work
If a weak nigga runnin’ in the mouth bitch curb
Any the new nigga on my couch gets hurt
Relax when this louded you can get this work
A hustle reloaded and the bar taking shots
That’s rocky to pull me up the hand me on the rock
I like nice women, who don't question a lot
Like the old videos, I'm requesting the box
This ain't pop shit, I've invested a lot
Anywhere I go to rap, I'm the best in the spot
Only say facts, you can test what I got
Put the rest of the talks, 'til the feds get to chalk
I’m killing the mob, niggas know the deal
They say I’m being too meek
But that’s ‘cause I’m chasin’ a mill
I’m facing my fears at all
And the band wagon leaving, get on, if you believe it get gone this year I'm acting an animal, we taking over the bar
And your song

[Hook]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh, well
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
