[Intro]
Yeah (Word!)
Yeah man (What?)
(Love me) It’s Drizzy baby (Mayday!)
You know what it is, from T-Dot to the world
My man Rebstar (Rebstar!), T-Williams (Yeah!), Boi-1da

[Verse 1:Drake]
Look, I know you miss me, go on admit it girl
Cause everything he doing for you, I done did it girl
So call me up late, I know you with it girl
I get a rush from it, knowing you commited girl
Beach front properties, panoramic views
You could probably catch him in Atlanta with his crew
Plus his whole vibe like candles and a pool
Cause he’s hot, but you notice how he handles it is cool
The name is Drake dawg, I came here solo
The smell is Dolce, the drawers is Polo
The DJs Future, the clothes is Ransom
The cut’s from J-Mac, ya boy is handsome
Pay me now, nigga cash advance him
Y’all don’t wanna see me throw no tantrum
We blowing up this year, it’s called expansion
Now everybody get to dancing to this, ah…..

[Hook]
I’m trying to make sure that you feel right
Cause you already know what it be like
Well dressed for the evening
Party hard like we ain’t leaving
Now let’s have a toast to the good life (Uh, huh)
Go ahead and keep drinks coming all night
Shoutout to the DJ, now please let me down here tonight
The way this make you feel, say oohhh
Tonight, the way
This make you feel, say oohhh
Toast to the good life…

[Verse 2: Rebstar]
My lawyer J-Money, but it’s not important
She seen the videos, but she don’t know my story
Army greens sneaks, homie GI Jordan
On another time zone, we party ’till the morning
My man looking up to me, he ’bout to sneeze
And she treating me like I be New Year’s Eve
Counting down the seconds untill she sees me (5, 4, 3, 2)
One time for the women that want it with Megan Fox
Two times for the ladies that never use Photoshop
Them other girls, they so vanilla
You gotta certain je ne sais quoi
They need to get their French up to par
And, uh, pardon me for asking
Anything I want, I must have it
I make it happen, poof, magic

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rock City]
To bring life, the infatuation
I’m only a figment of your imagination
When I talk, it’s no exaggeration
You won’t find another dude quite like me
(Uh, uh) Me and my everything crew
Everything’s big, everything’s new
Drinks on me, so what you wanna do?
Chill right here and head bop to the groove
Yeah, and it's VI for life
So if you want, we can fly to the VI tonight
Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, Saint John is nice
So girl, just let me know which one you like
(Uh) My plans now to live it up this year
That’s why I shine from my neck to my wristwear
We off, up in the party like we live here
Lights on, everybody’s gone, but we still here, yeah

[Hook]
