[Verse 1: BAD BOY i]
Expedition led by my boy Lewis
It's just a coincidence that we happened to leave from St. Louis
And it's me dawg William Clark the expert mapmaker
Man I'm out here making dough like a fat baker
Mr. Khan diss track coming but I'll give you that later
We were looking for a water route to the Pacific
I keep spitting bars I'm just being real prolific
And I'm sorry if y'all wanted me to be more specific
We out here driving Lambo's while these boys in Honda Civics
Kids these days they don't wanna test me like I'm physics
Our towbar already broke twice so far
Run up on you with a crowbar but we don't want no war
Y'all tryna get me in your grasp, but don't wanna drop me like a soap bar
Like you lost your WiFi connection you got no bars
Y'all thought when we met the Teton Sioux we had a standoff
But actually I ran off
Hit up the club ran some bands off
You can't touch me get your hands off
But I got more rings than Gandalf
Impacted America's expansion westward
Snort so much cocaine nose looking like Squidward's
Pull up on you any last words
Spit out that safe password
Expedition started a new era not talking snapbacks
We're talking Thanksgiving clapbacks
Jump you take your backpack
Tell my homie snap that put it on Snapchat but I also Instagram that
Increase the abstract put the caption hashtag I nabbed that
Now you begging give me that back but I just laughed at it told Lewis pass that
