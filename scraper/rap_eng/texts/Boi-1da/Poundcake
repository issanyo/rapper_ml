[Verse 1:Master X]
I'm overthrowing rap like France did King Louis
I don't need excuses but y'all do because you foolish
Don't you see I got bliss but y'all shooting and miss
Y'all need to understand I rock like chris
And I got heart like kevin but y'all don't got it
My raps are atomic but y'all raps are like vomit
Isn't it really ironic you got epic
But I make raps flow like Kanye new shit
I flow the rap like a poem
Getting personal like I wrote broken
I'm rapping and I'm floating and Im woken
I'm like I'm in my fifties because I'm golden
I write music like Shakespeare stories classic
When I rap its magic but against you its tragic
Don't like a fake girl because I hate plastic
Shout to natural skinned girls y'all fantastic
I got a flow like Gambino
I don't mean to be a hero someone to fear though
But I got to ask you a question bro (What's on your mind?)
If mo money mean mo problems what if you got no mo

[Verse 2:Master X]
Take caution around me because I'm like a bomb
Even though I stay calm I go crazy like Vietnam
I go crazy like extremist in islam
I've seen a body like I was john
I play with names I put no respeck on it
They classify me as a great cause I mess with it
That's why the great ones and bums are separate
Now you wanna mess with me because you desperate
Well too bad it really ain't my problem
You thought I wouldn't make it but my career began to blossom
Damn man I started from the bottom
Now I'm protective about my feelings like a condom
Come on you must admit that I'm awesome
Trotting the globe as if I'm from harlem
Damn my feelings are becoming numb
Eli take over I'm stuck in my feelings I'm fallen
[Verse 3: Eli 37]
••You ain't gotta put me on the spot 'cause you already know that I'm Hot; number 1 on the block
••Know that I'm never gonna stop, go ahead take a look at the clock; tic toc tic toc
•Go ahead ask my boy Anthony
•I spit on the beat so handsomely
•I write this lines so randomly
•My tongue runs wild like a fantasy
•I’m ‘bout to break it down like an old car
•if you go against me, you won’t go far
•I'm on another level like I'm on Mars
•If I really tried to hit you, you would see stars
•Tu devrais savoir
•I'm too dangerous, boy, I'm the Coast Guard
•Best believe I'm an underground superstar
•You bring disgrace to the game, you discard
•I sound magnificent
And you sound like cinnamon
•Watch a brother make excuses when I get in it
•Pay attention; take notes how I steady take care of business
•God is my witness, how I'm vicious
And I get digits
•I look down on you like I'm on Mount Olympus
•When I'm on the track, I make sure that I keep ripping
•My cup runneth over, yet I keep sipping
•Mess with my crew, then you'll get stitches
BITCH!!!
