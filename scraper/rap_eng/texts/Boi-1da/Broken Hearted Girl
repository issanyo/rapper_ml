[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Boy, I see you looking at me, looking at you
I already know what you want, 'cause I want that shit too

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
It don't matter if you're single, single
Either way, I just wanna take you home, take you home
And it don't matter if you got a past, got a past
'Cause I ain't got nothing to do with that, do with that, do with that, so

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & (Fabolous)]
I wanna touch you
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
I wanna touch you
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
We ain't gotta waste time going out on dates
We ain't gotta count down till you come to my place
We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), we ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) we ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta waste time sending me roses
They gon' die anyway, man that's just boring
You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) you ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
'Cause I want you right now

[Verse 2: Fabolous & Teyana Taylor]
Look you need to stop playing with yourself (what?)
Like I ain't who you playing when you playing with yourself
You playing the shy role, I was playing it myself
But it's no good for you, now you playing with your health like
I ain't who you thinking 'bout (I ain't who you thinkin' bout)
When you layin' by yourself (when you layin' by yourself)
Know you heard it was a movie
Better stop role playing with yourself like
Like, like, stop frontin' (stop)
Know they coming at your neck like a top button (stop)
You need to go ahead and drop it for a nigga
So I can come behind and like, "Miss, you dropped something"
And fuck is these roses for, what all these clothes is for?
I wanna close the door, fuck till we dozin' off
Wake up and go again, what's the mimosas for?
You got the juicy things, champagne toast to yours
Cheers shawty, yeah shawty
Time to face your fears, shawty
Climb up on it and hit them gears shawty
Hashtag BikeLife, hashtag MightWife
Got my heart like likes, looked at her like psych
Looked at her like psych
You ain't gotta
Hey T, stop playin' with me

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
The last nigga broke my heart
You probably break it too, no baby
I'd rather just play my part than to play a fool, no

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
It don't matter if you're single, single
Either way, I just wanna take you home, take you home
And it don't matter if you got a past, got a past
'Cause I ain't got nothing to do with that, do with that, do with that, so

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & (Fabolous)]
I wanna touch you
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
I wanna touch you
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
We ain't gotta waste time going out on dates
We ain't gotta count down till you come to my place
We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), we ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) we ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta waste time sending me roses
They gon' die anyway, man that's just boring
You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) you ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
'Cause I want you right now
