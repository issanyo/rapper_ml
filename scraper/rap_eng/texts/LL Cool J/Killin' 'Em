Attention please, cause it's whoopass season!

You killin em baby, you know that baby

[Busta Rhymes]
It's getting warm in here; lemme roll my sleeves up
You Fettuccine Alfredo niggas is gas
I respect your outfit, but I’m afraid your ass is trash
Funny but I always seem to have the last laugh
And bag a bitch with the potato bag ass
Yesterday I was quiet and made the ass glad
Today I dropped another heater and it made the ass mad
Fuckers, we have got it in a bag and in the stash
Then do the shit that make the bitches act bad
See this moment is addictive motherfucker
How I kill shit, they say, "he a vindictive motherfucker"
I see the way niggas be hating when I get in the spot
They bitches be hallucinating when I spit
Ain’t no replacement for me when I quit so sick
Got them saying I’m amazing when I shit
When they come and see the movie and they sit
They would come to witness it, I was the greatest in the flick

This movie has been brought to you by The Conglomerate
Uncle L, talk to 'em!

Ladies love me, I’m on my Breezy
Uncle L, future of the funk
Without my stamp on it, how this joint gonna bump?
Let them taste the vintage, they want a free lunch
I guess they don’t know we playing ourselves, trump
Our nose in the air looking all stopped up
This is the anti-hista-green for the broke pop slut
You wanna impress me? Start manning up
Say something that sound like you piss standing up
You're lucky I made it out, the hood’s bad enough
Get you for your Gucci, leave your face tatted up
Flash back the skunk, el producto blunt
More green behind me, the fake gold fronts
I ain’t drop a verse in like 36 months
All I see BS, y'all need to quick stunt
Damn, right, it's like you Midas when you touch
Your career's like a hymen: once it's gone, you're fucked

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Now you know it’s impossible to stop me now, right?
You see I’m back to yoke up the game in a chokehold
Put you to shame like the barrel was engraved in your nose hole
You gonna bounce to the next groove: I'm back bitch
Better get to rethinking your best move
Money to get, beating the pavement, gotta go
Where passports and visas and bitches waiting in Monaco
As I return to handle my biz
You know exactly what it is

[Hook]
