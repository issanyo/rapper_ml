[Intro]
I know you made plans, but...
Is there any way possible that those plans could be changed?
I wanna take you somewhere where you’ve never been before...
(Come in my MasterSuite)
To a place where need and want are the same thing
So I want you to relax...and let me be your host
Let these double-doors block out the pain
Come with me

[Verse 1]
Step into my oasis of love, the door is open, girl
To the secret world, where anything is possible
Just as long as it feels good
Let your imagination run free
I want you to come along with me
Come on, girl

[Chorus]
Come in my MasterSuite, I can make it alright tonight
(Alright, alright) I can make it okay (I can make it okay)
Come in my MasterSuite, I can make it alright tonight
(Oh, baby) I can ease the pain (I can ease the pain)
Come in my MasterSuite (Will you do that for me, baby?)

[Verse 2]
Dim the lights and let the love begin
I wanna be your host
Your regular fix-it-man
I’ll do anything I can to love away the pain
I'm going where no man's gone before
To keep you coming back for more, baby!

[Chorus]
Come in my MasterSuite (I can make it alright)
(Alright) I can make it okay (If you come on tonight)
Come in my MasterSuite, I can make it alright tonight
(I can make it alright tonight) I can ease the pain
(Yeah, yeah, come on)
Come in my Master Suite, I can make it alright tonight
I can make it okay
Come in my MasterSuite, I can make it alright tonight
I can ease the pain (Alright, alright)

[Bridge]
(I wanna talk about it)
Secrets, my darling
(Give me a chance, baby)
Make it okay
(I swear I can make everything alright)
Secrets, my darling
(All you gotta do, just lay your little head down on my shoulder)
Make it okay
(Let me make, let me make, let me make it feel real good)

[Chorus]
Come in my MasterSuite, I can make it alright tonight
(I wanna make you feel good all o-, all o-, all o-, all over your body)
MasterSuite, I’ll ease your pain tonight
(Come in my MasterSuite, I wanna make you feel good, yeah)

I want you, I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on
Whoa ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh

Come in my MasterSuite, I can make it alright tonight
(I wanna be your fix-it-man)
(I want you to lay your little head down, my darling)
Secrets, my darling
(I want you to just relax for a  while)
Make it okay
(Everything is gonna be alright…in my MasterSuite)
