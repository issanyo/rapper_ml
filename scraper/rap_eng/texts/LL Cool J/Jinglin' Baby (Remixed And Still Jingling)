[Intro]
And you say New York City
And you say New York City

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 1]
Uncle L, Future of the funk
Records are recorded minus all the junk
People spread gossip and believe what they must
But I slam dunk punks and make 'em bite the dust
A minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed
And put 'em in a bucket like it's chicken feed
Check out the pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice
And I'm-a dust you off and dust you off twice
I heard it's all observant, hysterical fan-
-natics of the Asiatic miracle man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real.
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel
You're so-so, I got the instinct
They call me Deputy Dawg to put your booty in the clink
You're dancin' to a Marley Marl remix single of
Let me see your earrings jingle, love!

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 2]
I chopped you, chewed you, baked you, and stewed you
That slop you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you
No good niggaboo tryin' to base
How you livin', homes? Get out my face!
I'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall
Rise, surprise, and I advise you all
To stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt
My skill'll get ill, I turn the mother out, huh
I'm top-notch, you're playin' hopscotch
Now I'm-a do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really try to go for yours
But I know why, you ain't had no dough before
So you tried and lied to drain my fame
This ain't a game, yo, you know my name
Innovating, devastating, and dope on a single, now
Dance to my remix single

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 3]
When you first walked in, I ain't know what to think
Cause you grabbed the microphone like your booty don't stink
And tried to run down that, I can't get over that
Garbage you were sayin', you call that a battle rap?
How you gonna go against an army with a handgun?
I'm LL, and you don't understand, son
I'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin'
Now you look booty like that bum Miss Givens.
Whoever geesed you up...nah, how should I say it?
Whoever set you up, they knew just how to play it
'Cause man, YO, I feel for ya brother
I'm a baaaaaad... (Word to the mother!)
Takin' out suckers while the ladies pucker
And rollin' over punks like a redneck trucker
Innovating, devastating, and dope on a single, now...
Lemme see your earrings jingle...

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
Break down!
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Yeah, go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) C'mon, go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Yeah, do it, baby

[Verse 4]
Can't believe you tried to get the same mic as me
Your grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B
You can dream of makin' progress and gettin' this nice
But when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice
Serve the curves, I never swerve I'm superb
Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves
Played your hand, lost track of your plan
When I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man
Play you like a poker chip, that's what you get
I bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met
The Titan of Fightin', excitin' when writin'
You triflin' toyboy, I gotta enlighten, so start bitin'
You know you can't create and get mean like this;
When I'm on the court, G, it's strictly SWISSSSHHHH!
When it's all over, said and done, my friend
They'll say, "L.L. Cool J just scored again."
So take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop
Here's your token back, you're gettin' off at the next stop
I'm-a deliver and give a speech with vigor
Pass the wine cooler you big black.... (laughter)

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Yeah, go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Yeah, go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby

[Outro]
And you say New York City
And you say New York City
And you say New York City
And you say New York City
