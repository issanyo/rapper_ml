[Verse 1]
You got to get back every rhyme
Going to jump back
She won't get it
I got a feeling but giving you, I
And I'm so damn
So damn glad about it

I got a feeling
That your jumping around
Going to get back
She won’t  get it
I got to feeling
Like jumping around
And I'm so damn
So damn glad about it

[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Verse 2]
I got to feeling
Of giving you, I
Won't jump back
She won’t let it
I got a feeling
Like nothing around
And I'm so damn
So damn glad about it

She don't smoke
She don't breathe
She don't hash
She don't dope
But she's a liar
I got to feeling
Like nothing around
And I'm so damn
So damn glad about it

[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Verse 3]
She's serious
Makin' me delirious
I'm curious
Next thing I know
Hitting us
Enjoying
The animal magnetism
She's too hot to touch
Too cool for criticism
Each and every things
Like a mini movie being filmed
'Cause I'm the captain
I'm in a body from hell
I'm shivering, quivering
I smile while I'm delivering
Get some love and passion
It's never been
So intense and spiritual like
In sense of above, against
And all off in silence
Then I scream like a man
Out of his rich
'Cause I'm so serious
So serious effecting

[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

Ho!

She mentioned that I was
She mentioned that I was

(Serious)
Jumping around
I got to break down
(Serious)
She's the one who get it
(Serious)
I got a feeling
Like jumping around
(Serious)
Cause I'm so glad
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me

[Chorus]
