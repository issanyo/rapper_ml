The bags under my eyes have my family stressed
My minds full of drama
Each thoughts a screen test
I'm the challenger
Dodgin' in my kevlar vest
Six hours in my lapse
It's the angel of death
Heard you were prayin for my downfall
Cigar on your desk
But this is war
It doesn't matter who's right
It's who's left
I have simple tastes
I'm only satisfied with the best
And Oscar said it best
Nothing succeeds like excess
So I do foolish things
With the noblest motives
Play golf in the sand trap
Filled with explosives
That's music to my ears
But to you it's corrosive
Like tryin to be patient
When you're really impulsive
The fat lady sung
I interrupted the song
Aimed my silencer at those who were singin along
Got creative
Get the hardrive
Find me a break as
Hard as exoskeleton titanium plates
I want it when I want it
Why would I wanna wait
I push the envelope
There's no seal on my fate
Dreams don't have deadlines
It's never to late
Even a broken clocks right
Twice a day and straight
Teamwork makes the dream work
While your awake
I stay under the radar
On my way outta space
When you stand firm
Be sure your feet are in the right place
Forgive your enemies
But take advantage of their mistakes
They watchin
They plottin
They be prayin for my downfall
I'm still
Risin
To the top and
I'm something like Muhammed in his prime and
They watchin
They plottin
Steady prayin for my downfall
I been
In these streets it's kangos and shell toes
For the mote they gon' have to dig deeper for bones

The only easy day was yesterday
Remember the party
That isn't pain
That's weakness leavin' ya body
Adapt or perish
You'll either lead or be elite
And if I'm in a fair fight
I didn't plan it properly
Every promise made comes with a price tag G
And a mouse traps the only place where lunch is free
So overweight
Your bodies buried
I will lose it in sleep
Cause when doin what's necessary
Not many succeed
I swear I coulda been a engineer at Lockheed and Martin
But I was rockin' the garden
When math class was startin
I may come off like a gangster
But I'm beggin ya pardon
Ya see I never liked cuffs
They make ya lifestyle rotten
All I wanted
Was to be what I became
A rocketman
See my atmosphere was full of game
Im something like Muhammed in his prime
I'm snuffin my enemies at the primetime
They watchin
They plottin
They be prayin for my downfall
I'm still
Risin
To the top and
I'm something like Muhammed in his prime and
They watchin
They plottin
Steady prayin for my downfall
I been
In these streets it's kangos and shell toes
For the mote they gon' have to dig deeper for bones

You don't appreciate how right it is til it's wrong
If love is blind then you better put some glasses on
I'm not young enough to know everything
But in the land of the blind
A man with one eye is king
And the question that I really want answered is this
Why is seekin revenge so hard for me to resist?
I know it's better to be feared than it is to be loved
And if your thoughts are your fists
Than your actions are gloves
I ain't no shakespeare
And I'm far from a poet
I don't wanna preserve the status quo
I wanna overthrow it
Know they're plannin my downfall to take them wages
But to do anything great you gotta face some danger
See how I blend with the background
The perfect stranger
I didn't do this alone
I'm not the lone ranger
You can feel it in your spirit
Deep down in your chest
There is no escapin
