"How y'all feel out there?" - [Run]
"...Aw yeah!" - [D.M.C.]

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
No matter how you feel, where you are
Just know that I love you, girl I do
They try to say I wasn't good enough
But I swear you won't find another
Just know that I love you, girl I do
I live for you

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
You're in every breath that I take
Every dream that I dream, every move that I make
My love never sleeps, every moment it's awake
My heart shines like moonlight on the lake
My soul was in prison but you helped it escape
Toned down the ego, mimimize the hate
You add to the magic I was put in to create
You make my vision clearer when I can't see straight
Show me parts of my life that I need to eliminate
Yet and still so many times I didn't demonstrate
The love that I feel, I wasn't bein real
I did so many things you wouldn't appreciate
I was a little naughty, I saw your heart break
Still you was there for me, I never had to wait
So from this day forth my heart's a clean slate
Write what you want just leave your name and date

[Chorus: Brad Paisley (LL Cool J)]
No matter how you feel, where you are
Just know that I love you, girl I do (I do)
They try to say I wasn't good enough (They said it)
But I swear you won't find another (You won't, eh-ha)
Just know that I love you, girl I do
I live for you (I do, I live for you)

[Interlude: Brad Paisley (LL Cool J)]
Ohhhhhhh, ohhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh - for you girl (Girl, we gon' live it up)
Ohhhhhhh, ohhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh - I live for you (I live for you)
Ohhhhhhh, ohhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh (And we gon' live it up)
Just know that I love you, girl I do
I live for you

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Baby girl, when you're standin on this big rock flyin through space
Havin experiences we could never replace
Deep scars on our hearts that are hard to erase
A thorn in your side, I can see it on ya face
And every time we hug, it hurts in the same place
So you build up walls to protect you just in case
I tried to climb over but I fell on my face
I tried to dig beneath it but I couldn't penetrate
Saw a crack in my wall, that raised the stakes
Bright light shine through, help me to find you
Illuminated the inner divine you
A room with no walls, I can't define you
Too many thoughts to force my mind through
But if it hits the fan, I'm right behind you
Or you're beside me, hearts wide open and free
A love is the key

[Chorus: Brad Paisley (LL Cool J)]
No matter how you feel, where you are
Just know that I love you, girl I do (I do)
They try to say I wasn't good enough (They said it)
But I swear you won't find another (You won't, eh-ha)
Just know that I love you, girl I do
I live for you (I do, I live for you)

[Interlude: Brad Paisley (LL Cool J)]
Ohhhhhhh, ohhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh - for you girl (Girl, we gon' live it up)
Ohhhhhhh, ohhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh - I live for you (I live for you)
Ohhhhhhh, ohhhh-ohhhh, ohhhh (And we gon' live it up)
Just know that I love you, girl I do
I live for you

[Outro: LL Cool J]
Knahmsayin, baby? (And we gon' live it up)
Yeah... Gotta open your heart (I live for you)
I had to open mine (And we gon' live it up)
Heh, yeah, yeah.. me too (I live for you)
