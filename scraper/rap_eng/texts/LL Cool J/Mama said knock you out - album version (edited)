C'mon man

And with the local DDC news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
But tonight

Don't call it a comeback I been here for years
I'm Rockin' my peers Puttin' suckers in fear
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowerin'
Over the competition, I'm towerin'
Records shock When I drop
These lyrics That'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare
You betta move Don't ever compare
Me to the rest They'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin' the price

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Don't you call this no regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Mohammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this
Beat like a skull Dontcha know I gotta beef wit'
Why don't you rip with
Me, the maniac psycho
Cuz when I pull out my jammy, get ready cuz it might go
Blauh! How do you like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get wit' Mr. Smith don't risk
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blastin', outlastin'
Colors like shaft, so you could say I'm shaftin'
Old English filled my mind
And I came up with the funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Breakdown!

Gangsta Boogie Gangsta Boogie
Gangsta Boogie Gangsta Boogie
Gangsta Boogie Gangsta Boogie
Gangsta Boogie Gangsta Boogie
Gangsta Boogie Gangsta Boogie
Gangsta Boogie Gangsta Boogie
Gangsta Boogie Gangsta Boogie
Gangsta Boogie Gangsta Boogie

Shadow boxin' when I heard you on the radio
Uh - I just don't know
What made You forget that I was raw
But now I gotta new toy
I'm going insane Frontin' the hurricane
Releasin' pain
Lettin' you know You can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name
Rippin' Killin' Diggin' and drillin' a hole
Pass the ol' goal

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I will devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I gotta jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh
Listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage Damage
Damage Damage
Destruction, terror and mayhem
Pass me a sissy, and suckas I'll slay him
Farmers (WHAT) Farmers (WHAT)
I'm ready! (WE'RE READY) I think I'm gonna bomb a
Town (GET DOWN) Don't you never, ever
Pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock
Hard... knock you out

Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Damn
