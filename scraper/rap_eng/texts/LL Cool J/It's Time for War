[Intro]
Welcome to Exit 13
I am your host
LL Cool J

[Verse 1]
You said I was finished
And Father Time was the blame
You disrespected my legacy
And threw dirt on my name
Told DJs he's over
He ain't spittin' the same
What he says is irrelevant
Hip-Hop culture has changed
When I walk in the room
Young boys look at me strange
As if I am a relic
From some long forgotten game
It makes my blood boil
Turns my eyes to flames
I built an empire
They tried to kick me out in the rain
So I called on an inner power
It's hard to explain
It's like a holy spirit
Utilizing Hip-Hop slang
I'm beyond the gold grills
And logos on chains
You see I changed rap forever
I elevated the game
Launched the greatest label
In the history of rap
And for 24 years
I carried it on my back
I've always shined brighter
When I'm under attack
I might be down for a moment
But I always come back

[Hook]
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war (Check it)
It's time for war

[Verse 2]
This is a resurrection
I'm back from the dead
They told me quit a long time ago
But I conquered instead
I had dreams and visions
Swirling around in my head
I had this hunger deep inside of me
That has to be fed
Hip-Hop will respect
All the blood that I shed
I have a covenant with God
I have swallowed the bread
Hip-Hop my co-defendant
With this mic I thee wed
I made an entire generation
Obey what we said
I'm talkin' France to Germany
From Italy to Japan
From London to Belgium
To Afghanistan
From Farmers Boulevard
Smokin' a blunt with my man
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board
To build Def Jam
You see, I'm the undisputed
King of all Hip-Hop
Everything after is my legacy
Like it or not
And I will keep making history
I can't stop
LL Cool J
Eternally hot

[Hook]
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war

[Verse 3]
Look at how easily I flipped it
And switched the style around
Competition losin' their footing
I see them falling down
They will plot against me
It kills them because I'm ballin' now
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone
But I got you callin' now
This is a job that must get done
Even if I become public enemy number one
If I had to pick up an Uzi
That weighs over a ton
I will attack Hip-Hop
Until competition is none
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L
You end up tortured
And trapped in psychological hell
And this is the beginning
Of a new era in rap
LL Cool J, feel the impact
It's okay if you call it a comeback
And let them know
I'm ready for combat
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back
The crown looks wrong on your head
I want that

[Hook]
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war

It's time for war

It's time for war
