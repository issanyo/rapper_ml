[Intro: LL Cool J]
It's been a long time
People change
I missed you
Word up
I used to always think about you
Even though sometimes I see you
And I try to ignore you
Deep inside I was thinkin' about you
What'd you think

[Verse 1: Tamia & LL Cool J]
You are my life
I have to go on
Havin' me any way you want me baby
Just love me til the tension's gone
And don't you come too soon
I'm patient I never come too soon
When I kissed you you said it was the same old tune
But I missed you my life was filled with gloom
I was hopeless sittin' in an empty room
When you re-appeared I was back in the mix
I put the key up in the lock cause true love fixed
All the drama got to stop baby no more tricks
My broken heart was addicted but now it's fixed
And I cherish you forever believe me you
You's a priceless treasure from my point of veiw
It took time to change I'll admit that
My back in the days love I had to get back

[Chorus: Tamia]
You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon (never that)

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I never thought that I would ever lay beside you again
Tastin' every inch plus being your friend
Romantic nights with shootin' stars and full moons
Kiss the rose better til it come full bloom
Can you feel it passions overflows in waves
Keep it steady providin' everything you crave
Now you ready I like that my love you save
I love it when a bad girl agrees to behave
It's the motion that makes your love affair complete
But devotion makes it all twice as sweet
Back together reunited bonded once more
Before I was hesitant but now I'm sure

[Chorus: Tamia]
You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon (never that)
You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon (never that)

[Outro: LL Cool J]
Well now you know how I feel
And I definetly know how you feel
Word up
I'm feelin' this
Word up
'Cause with you by my side
I'm a take it to the top yeah
