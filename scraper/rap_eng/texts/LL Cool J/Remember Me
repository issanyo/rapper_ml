[Intro: Male Voice LL Cool J Alicia Myers]
Eh yo L! L! Check this out
I know you doing out all thinin' thing, right?
But I was talkin' to Suga Daddy
He said "Why don't you do somethin' for the culture?"
"Why don't you ring it back to the Bentleys"
"That old school club, not the car."
By the way, can I hold your show?
Got applause for the liquors that ain't here
We said some when the people caught up to the struggle
Yeah. Bottom to the top
But we ain't forget you
Let's ride
I've been tryna find my way
Not with all this hurt and pain
I try to bread in that and all the high...
Machines

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
This one for those who feel ignored
My man, Rockstarr getting hit at the board
People boostin' the stores that they can't afford
For my grandmother tellin' me to "Remember the lord"
For all my gangsta that died by the sword
We use to smoke blunt to the back of Encore
Drive up town, I like ten cars or more
Tryin' to see some that we never seen before
For them kids in new town, and new gun laws
That would easily pass if that kid was yours
These are the side effects, what's the cause?
At a minimum, we got to put the shit on pause

[Hook: Alicia Myers LL Cool J]
Whoa! Every grounds
Remember me!
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you...

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
He went to town before his baby was born
Now his baby has a baby and he still ain't home
He cryin' in his cell when he all alone
Wishin he can call up god on the phone
Enough turn a good man his heart is stone
Make his baby mama drank patron
Hipnotic Hustlers ride in chrome
Motherfuckers read like Donna Boy's Poem
For 9/11 for the building's fall
For the misguided minds thats burning in hell
For the cats at the corner got hopes to sell
But never hit the number it never could post bail

[Hook: Alicia Myers LL Cool J]
Whoa! Every grounds
Remember me!
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you...

[Bridge: LL Cool J Alicia Myers]
Swerve it out, Hey, Swerve it out
Hey, Swerve it out, Hey, Swerve it out
Hey, Swerve it out, Hey, Swerve it out
Hey, Swerve it out, Hey, Swerve it out
Keep your hands on the grass
Don't forget about me
Keep your hands on the grass
Don't forget about me
Keep your hands on the grass
Don't forget about me
Keep your hands on the grass

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
He forgot where he came from, Lord forgive him
Protect him from all the mistake that got with em
When bullets unleash, don't let nothin' hit him
Wrap his shoulders for valtures that's out to get him
Flashback, USA what escape with him
Pull the fat boy, ha-ha-ha stick em
So-called best friend tried to trick him
Dear God, we forgive him but we don't forget him

[Hook: Alicia Myers LL Cool J]
Whoa! Every grounds
Remember me!
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you remember me
Do you remember me, Do you...

[Outro: LL Cool J]
To my man, Rashaun. Up North
Don't let them kill your spirt homie

My Man, Marley Marl, we ain't forget you homie
