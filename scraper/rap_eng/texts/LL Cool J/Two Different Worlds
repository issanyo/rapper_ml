(Intro: LL Cool J & Cydne Monet)
You know I don't understand why you treat me like this
It's almost like you feel like you're from two different worlds
(Well, we are Todd) I don't think so
You should have a listen to me right now

(LL Cool J)
I can feel it now baby I can feel it now, I can feel that
Even though you're a queen and I'm only a prince
I felt the magical between us ever since
The first time that I laid eyes on you
I want you to be my girl, so I can hold you
Caress you and let you know that I love you
And day by day my love grows
Heres' where I stand, I gotta be your man
I don't care if we're from two different worlds
But we're from...

(Cydne Monet)
Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds...
I don't understand the way you feel
But it's just a dream and it could never be real
So face to face I can't love you
We're from two, different worlds
Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds...

(LL Cool J)
Many things are different, birds and bees
Flowers and trees, you and me
But it really doesn't matter, it makes us stronger
There's more to talk about, we'll be together longer
Trustin' me, have faith in my love
It goes so deep, girl you're so sweet
As a matter of fact, I want you for my wife
Please be a part of my life

(Cydne Monet)
I can't believe you won't give up
Your love is strong but boy, so what (so what)
You can't love me, I can't love you
We're from two, different worlds... (it doesn't matter)
Two different, (two different) two different
We're from two different worlds (I don't care)
Two different (so what), two different worlds...

(LL Cool J & Cydne Monet)
It could never make a difference in my heart
(It could never make a difference)
Never could keep us apart (Whoooo... yeah)
Hold on (hold on) who cares what the world is sayin'?
(I do) My love goes so deep, (mmmm, baby), hold on
I know baby, let's take it to the climax
Two different, (two different) two different (so different)
We're from two different worlds (I don't care)
Two different (so what), two different worlds...

(LL Cool J)
So what's it gonna be, you wanna be with me?
I wanna be wit'chu, my love is true
All you gotta do is get into love
It's like a blessin' in disguise, sent from up above
This is your last chance, real not fate
Give me a break, don't make a mistake
Cause I'm for real, I want you for my girl
I don't care if we're from different worlds, but we're from

(Cydne Mone & LL Cool J)
Two different, (two different) two different (so different)
We're from two different worlds (uh, I don't care)
Two different, two different worlds... (who cares baby
You gotta understand, you gotta understand, just take my hand, come on baby)
Two different (have a heart honey), two different worlds... (I want you, I need you)
We're from two different worlds (take my hand honey)
Two different, (don't fool with the mood baby) two, different worlds (take me by hand)
You don't seem to understand (I understand baby, we're two, we can work it out)
(We can find a way), we're from, (self will change baby...)
We're from two different worlds
(We're the perfect match, I love you), two different
(trust me, have faith in your heart, baby) worlds
I'll treat you right baby, I'll treat you right baby, I'll promise you)
Two different (you never meant as much to me till tonight), two different
(I'll always love you), we're from two different worlds (I'll never forget you)
Two, two, two, different (trust me, hold my hand, have faith in me baby
Understand me sweet-heart, I love you...)
