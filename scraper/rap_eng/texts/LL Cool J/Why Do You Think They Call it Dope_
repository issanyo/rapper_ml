Warning, MC's stand back
You better take a chill and observe the skill
Of the man who can, so understand god damn
I got a masterpiece a master plan and a brand new
Way to attack the wack cut 'em down to size
To realize LL's back
Don't sleep I'm too sweet to repeat a beat
A lyric or rhyme I wouldn't waste your time
With weak words, that's for nerds, you never heard a rhyme
So you deserve a line rougher than rough enough is enough
I'm, gonna slaughter choke ya smoke ya like a sauna
You don't really wanna
But if you wanna battle on here's a lesson: stop 'fessin
I'm a lethal weapon, you better get to steppin
Off the stage, and outta my face
You're too light *in the asshole* save the bass

Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?

It seems like people'll never understand
On the microphone I'm not your average man
I cool out sometimes, I save my best rhymes
And then the toy boy thinks that he can come and get mine
Let your friends gas him up, talk trash and make bets
Then gets played like those kids who tried to rob Goetz
You don't know what I'm sayin? Yo check it
Give me any microphone and god damnit I'll wreck it!
I'm coldblooded I'm about to mutilate
Last year before I left I told you to wait
But you couldn't stay loyal started goin astray
Thinkin Tom, Dick, and Harry can mess with Cool J
Is you crazy? I'm boomin, got the talent of two men
The stamina and skill in battle to kill a few men
The heart of a lion, the loyalty of a soldier
I wreck your whole mob then tell ya I told ya!

Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?

Cause I don't jab around you, I come inside
Bob and weave, deceive until you get tongue tied
Brawl for all give a lyrical display
And next time you know better than to get in my way
"Yo whassup wit LL?
Will he ever make another 'Rock the Bells'?"
Yo brothers is comin up, "I think he's fallin off
I don't think he's still 'hard as hell'"
See, this is the attitude, of ignorant ones
Cause they don't know, all them MC'sll get done
One or two might say, "Yo L'll be back"
But the rest they be suckin on Sugar Smacks
Talkin that crap about who's better than me
You think so? Just let a MC
Make me mad enough, to really wanna battle
I put a L on his ass like he was cattle!

Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?

Just cause I make a love song, or say a simple rhyme
"Boom, move over L, it's Miller Time"
I don't know whether to laugh, get ill or get wild
Cause brothers don't realize, I got so many styles
Like triplin up the words, confusin all the nerds
Heard put my sights on mics and ?? flippin above the
Word to the mother, no other MC brother
Can mess with Ladies Lover
I'm original, I'm bright under color
And when I get on the mic, yo I burn rubber
Can't stand criticism, give 'em extra jism
Been rockin for years, now I have wisdom
The way I'm kickin the lines you can hear my tongue twist
And it'll have your neck spinnin like you're spineless
I'm pickin 'em up, throwin 'em down
Hypin 'em up and slowin 'em down
All of these words with only one tongue
Shakin 'em up and then bakin 'em up
Smash boom bash scrapin 'em up
Now you thought that was hard, I just begun
Cause I'm a roll on the microphone
And take control just like Al Capone
I'm notorious, you're foolish if you sleep on me
Cause I'm too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch, you melt
Yo I'm crazy dope, with super hype lines
And a lot of hype lines make one dope rhyme

Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?

Cause that's what it is

Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you think they call it dope?
