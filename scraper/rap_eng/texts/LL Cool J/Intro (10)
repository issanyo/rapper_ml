[(Free)+ LL Cool J]
(Wassup ya'll
This is free and today I have the pleasure
Of chillin' and talkin' to the one an' only LL Cool J
Welcome LL, how you doin'?)
What's up Free, what's goin' on?
(Oh good, chillin', glad to be here with you. We're on the verge of a 10th album)
Tenth joint
(From LL)
Yep 10th joint, feel great about it
Happy, you know what I am sayin'
(So yell me what this album means to you)
It's like a milestone in my career, it's just
An opportunity to just show the world
That you can do anything you put your mind to
Because I mean, you know
It just kind of makes me think about when I first signed to
Signed to Def Jam and my first album
And my first deal was for ten albums
(Right, Okay)
And, here I am, you know, my tenth album
Just like we talked about
It's, it's amazing
