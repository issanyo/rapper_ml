Yeah check it out baby
Make it hot, then we drop it
(oh!) Uh, yeah
(oh!) Uptown, you know how we do it
Yeah you know
Make it hot
It's the first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of makin' love kinda bore me
I want to knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft
I'm gonna call you Big Daddy and scream your name
Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain
So what cha sayin', I get my swerve on, bring it live
Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight
Mm daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga Mandingo in a sec
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
No doubt, I'm the playa that you're talkin about
But do you really think that you can work it out
I guarantee shorty it's real, baby stick it out
Here comes the man of steel

[Chorus: x2]
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
(I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn)
I'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot
To hit now, get down
(Damn my lover dig down, you use a rubber?)
Damn right
(You are my lover)
All night
(The putty good to you? Word to momma)
Man tight
The only thing left to do is climax
Let's make it last
(Word we ain't goin' out like that)
(All this time you've been telling that you was a Don)
I tried to warn you girl you wouldn't listen
Now let's get it on
(Baby wild, don't do that)
(Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back)
You talk a good one shorty now you're makin me sweat
How a live nigga like it girl?
(Nice and wet)

(We get it To The Break of Dawn, damn you're large)
(How a big girl like it Daddy?)
Nice and hard
Safe sexing it, flexing it, getting that affectionate
Chewing it, oohing it, all while we're doing it

[Chorus: x2]
Baby, I want to hit it in the worst way
(Make it hot)
Scheming on the ass since the first day
(Don't stop)
(Damn I love it when you talk like that)
(Make it bounce sugar)
Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the Greek Fest
(Roll up the sess)
Pass the Hennessy
(Put my body to the test)
(Way way back many niggas ago)
(I was a young girl listening to how you flow)
(Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown)
(From the back, from the side)
Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit
(Press rewind)
(Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L)
(Laying back in the cut while we're under the spell)
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

[Chorus: x3]
