[1st verse]
I can shut a nigga down so quick my sounds so sick
My talents spread around while I'm holdin my dick
My dingling shit flip emaculate
Evolutionary flows y'all want more dough
Make wit the best get the best all the rest hit 'em less
Rip a nigga from the East to the West
Just a lyrical maze lyrical days
God works in mysterious ways
I'm the warlord of war relieve the raw dog
Niggas ain't even comin close to my low score
Niggas fleein when I'm rippin on the hard core beat
That's slammin through your jeep like a 44 Mack to your back
Nigga L never got rip by a trackI don't fuck around, always come back
For the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the back
Looked at every nigga wit the mic on my arm
A time-bomb blowin up ring the alarm
Cool double O flow well to the LL
I'm leave the world looking hard as hell

[Chorus]
8x I shut 'em down
(Get Off Me!!, You Can't Hold Me!!)

[2nd verse]
To the next plateau niggas bet my flow
Betta bet I role wit more control
Gotta bring the heat that eliminate who can't compete
Spit razors to rip the beat
Relentless endless friendless when it comes to the lyrical mack
Now off my back stack 'em drag 'em now feds waggin
Hear you fassen place on the blood of my veins without passion
Mashin take a little time to think the rhyme out
How to find out
Bump and grind out
Pump the lines out
I'ma show what the microphone is all about without doubt
C to the double O bounce in the bubble eye limo
No I ain't checkin for you bull shit demo
Everytime you hear me in a battle I'm lethal
Nigga too sweet 'n low you ain't equal

[Chorus]
I shut 'em down (16x)
(after the 8th time)Get Off Me!!, You Can't Hold Me!!)

[3rd verse]
I can take you to the level if I let my phantom
Nigga bout to rule the world wit one anthem
Kidnapped rap for a handsome ransom
Smoke a little Branson on the side of the mansion
Keep it thugged out even when a nigga dancing
Branson make that trans and keep it dancing
I'm a murder every nigga in the game
Can't stand the rain
Fuck a maintain
Gotta leave the world in flames
Nigga wanna live life stay out of my lanes
Tryin to read my name
Here's a murderous combo wit you on your pain
Sideways stimulator bringin the flames
Niggas wanna feel me spit the whole clips
Sing along it will split your lip
45 wit an name on the grip
Niggas said you wanna batlle
Nigga now talk shit

[Chorus]
8x I shut 'em down
(Get Off Me!!, You Can't Hold Me!!)
