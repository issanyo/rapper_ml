[Verse 1]
The wind is howlin'
The rain pours down
Eyes are blood-shot
Heartbeat pounds
Lights go out
The whole world's in darkness
The ground is tremblin'
Dogs are barkless
In the sky there appears a great light
Burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night
AAAHHHH!  Cryin' in a childish tone
Terrified of dyin' a painful death alone
Don't smile unless your innocent child
The power of God is gonna get you through your tao
Thrown like a hit from the best
Take it in a slump
Haha
Feel it in your chest
Conquerin' the world with the words
Leadin' the children like herds
I can feel it buildin'
I'm about to explode
I'm walkin' on the crossroad

[Chorus]
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads

[Verse 2]
Violins and trumpets play
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh
On their way to the promised land
Deliverance
But yet some don't understand
Rough on a late night drill
After midnight
Kill or be killed
Soldiers, warriors, mercenaries
Rush at each other
On the combat zone
Supreme power on the throne
Lighting strikes in every home
Terrified men run down the street
So many dead bodies
It's hard to eat
But we gotta rise
Above the wall
To see what no man has seen before
Blindin' light
To guide you through the night
God is on your side
You got to fight!

[Chorus]
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
(Get ready for the battle)

[Verse 3]
Homicide
Suicide
Death
BOOM!
Ain't nobody left
Ooooh! It's startin' to take effect
You're on your knees
You're scared to death
Tornadoes with a thousand people spinnin'
A fight at the cross
And now god is winnin'
The whole Earth cracks in half
The sea turns red from the bloodbath
Abandoned buildings burned into a maze
Terrified, you feel the fire blaze
The ground can't hold your weight
You reach out to grab the pearly gates
Whole continents floatin' out in space
Never again will you see the human race
19 angels lead the devil straight to hell!
Torment!
Pain!
What you see and hear
You can't explain
All your life
So many played the game
Never realizing there's a flame

[Chorus]
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack, at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads
Now they stab you in the back, at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
