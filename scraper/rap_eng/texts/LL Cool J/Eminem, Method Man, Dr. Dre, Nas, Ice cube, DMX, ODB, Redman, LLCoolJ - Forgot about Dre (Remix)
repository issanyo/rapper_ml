[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, Brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten Rhymer
Cursin' at you players than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, Fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I gets down, rip sound, with this stick style
Pist-al, lick round, get off my dick now
Get crabbed, hostile, you kids is all sound timid
Scared to get in it, these dogs is Rockwild'
Unchained, untamed, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame, it's not a game
Just ill flows, that kills shows, you can feel yo
Kickin in you do', like a steel toe, for real doe
Y'all gon' learn, I spit germs
When you come short on Big Worm, you get burned
Punks don't get turned, they get done, and get sun
Come get some, the last vict-im, lie in a ditch
Now who wanna fuck with Hot Nikk'
Niggas chew gum with they ass and pop shit
Me and Funk Doc get, toxic
A bowl of rice and some chopsticks

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It's still Dre Day, nigga, AK, nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
â€˜Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How, nigga? My last album was The Chronic
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves
Still fuck with the beats, still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 4: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 5: Ice Cube]
Bitch we clubbin' (nigga what?)
I'm treated like the Presidential motorcade
Takin' out the residential global persperation
Freaky gyrations close to fornication
Numbers get passed when asked information
Intoxication faded inebriated
Designated driver liver than MacGyver
Blockin' freaks in all of 'em tens
Stallions get them to pile in
Sittin' on 'Lacs bitch we write raps
Backdo' access you gettin' jealous
Standin' all in line with designer umbrellas
Bad fellas runnin' with the Eastside Connection
Any kind of club with a star check they weapons

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 6: DMX]
Yeah baby, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught
Punked up like five new blocks, holding down for it
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Our estate was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
Cause when it's on, it's on
He didn't care
It's like slow down baby
The money ain't going nowhere
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on)
You gotta watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go against the grain

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 7: Ol' Dirty Bastard & Redman]
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
Yo, flipmodes, toilet bowls explode
When Doc, come drop a shitload
Grip fo's, mushrooms, did those
Dee pistol-whip hoes, a bitch owes
Money, bro I stick a zip code
Tiptoed, before Doc hit skid row
Thirsty? Sniffin out a pig nose
My Benz built with wings and 6-0's
My flows is, North Pole cold
My hands got areas to fit snow
Doc, mixin hoes and disco's
My dogs, let em walk with ripped clothes
Shows, niggas pack six rows
We're losin him! His heart won't get pulse

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 8: LL Cool J]
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know
