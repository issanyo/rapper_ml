(J.Lo)Its such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you been treatin me
And its crazy but oh baby
It dont matta whatever dont faze me

(Ll Cool J) I dont believe you wanna leave like this
I dont believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminice
Wait a minute dont bounce baby
Lets talk about this

(J.Lo)well im bouncing and I'm out son
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause im good
Holding down my spot
And I'm good
Reppin the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock!
So without me you'll be fine, right?

J.Lo: My pride is all I have
Ll Cool J: Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
J.Lo: You'll be needing me but too bad
Ll Cool J: Be easy, dont make decisions when you're mad
J.Lo: The path u chose to run along
Ll Cool J: I kno your independent you can make it on ur own
J.Lo: Here with me you have a home
Ll Cool J: Time is of the essence, why spend it alone?

(J.Lo)The nights I've waited up for you
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
Thats why I had to replace you

(Ll Cool J)It makes a chap nervous the thought of settling down
Especially when he's creeping all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock ya down
I knew I had you as cocky as that sounds
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you're angry come here I'll prove it now (come here)

(J.Lo)Stop playing, you gaming, I got to leave you alone

'Cause im good
Holding down my spot
And I'm good
Reppin the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

J.Lo: My pride is all I have
Ll Cool J: Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
J.Lo: You'll be needing me but too bad
Ll Cool J: Be easy, dont make decisions when you're mad
J.Lo: The path u chose to run along
Ll Cool J: I kno your independent you can make it on ur own
J.Lo: Here with me you have a home
Ll Cool J: Time is of the essence, why spend it alone?

(Ll Cool J)People make mistakes, to make up, to break up
To wake up cold and lonely
And chill baby you kno me, you love me, I'm like your homie
Insteada beefing come hold me, I promise I'm not a phony
Dont bounce baby, console me, come here

(J.Lo)Ain't Nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let u go now, Nothin will ever be the same
So just be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now
And theres no more to explain to me ya kno
I know ya game I'm not feelin' what you do(and im good)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out son (im good)
I gotta leave you alone yeah yeah

J.Lo: My pride is all I have
Ll Cool J: Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
J.Lo: You'll be needing me but too bad
Ll Cool J: Be easy, dont make decisions when you're mad
J.Lo: The path u chose to run along
Ll Cool J: I kno your independent you can make it on ur own
J.Lo: Here with me you have a home
Ll Cool J: Time is of the essence, why spend it alone?
