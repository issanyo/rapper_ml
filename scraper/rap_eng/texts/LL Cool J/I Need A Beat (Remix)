[Intro]
I-I-I-I need
I-I-I-I-I need a beat
I need a beat (I need a beat, I need a beat)

[Verse 1]
If it's a malleable beat, subject of discussion
Malleable beat, subject of discuss-cussion
You're motivated-vated with the aid of percussion-cussion
There's no glo-glory, for this story-story
It-it rock-rock in any territory-tory
I syncopate it and design it well-well
Beat elevates-vates, the scratch excels-cels
All techniques are a combination
Of skills that I have for narration

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Lacking a melody, but still complete
Providing musical energy for the street
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect
Drum track patterns are pre-set
Tom-toms, snare, hats, bass, and cymbal
Like that of a cat on the mic, I'm nimble
Basic patterns, groups and chains
Sequence frequent, seek and gain

[Bridge]
Break
Break
For narration
Break two, break two

[Verse 3]
I'm in the center of a, I'm in the center of a
To some citizens, it's a, to some citizens, it's a
They hear me, they fear me, they hear me, they fear me
I'm improvin' the conditions of the rap industry
The beat will expand, to land on foreign lands
Germany, Italy, France and Japan
It'll give you a lift, no need to sniff
No buts, no hows, no whys, or ifs
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it-read it
Rap firepower, a musical shower-shower
A picture-picture of me on the Eiffel-Eiffel Tower-Tower

[Refrain]
I need a beat-beat

[Verse 4]
Doing-doing dirty, I'm your-your-cort
You're bein'-bein' 'tected-'tected, musical-cal fort
I'm infiltrating your eardrums
Increasing their rate of vibration
I wanna rock ya-rock ya, that's all you need to know-know
"I Need a Beat" is the title of the show-show
Providing-viding pleasure of the musical measures
All-all arranged to alleviate pressure-pressure
I'm your vocalist, your party therapist, thera-therapist
Beat programmer and lyri-lyricist
Ladies Love Cool J, studio user
A million or more screamin' people abuser
I predict this jam will hit
The highest plateau in the world of music-music
Paparazzi, wealth and fame
The total propulsion of my name

[Refrain]
I need a beat

[Verse 5]
Computerize, then the engineer's eyes
Have to be very acute, education level high
The product is mine, beat under rhyme
The control board's part of the studio design
Track after track, culminating on wax
The tape has slack, rewind spins back
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel
A perfect place for MCs to duel (duel, duel, duel, duel)

[Outro]
I need a beat, Farmer's Boulevard
Hot as Queens
Ladies Love-Ladies Love Cool J
Cut Cre-ator
