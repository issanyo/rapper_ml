[Intro: LL Cool J]
Remix baby!!! remix baby!!! come on come on!!! remix baby!!! (Rock the bells baby)
Come on come on!!! (Wayne Wonder, LL, Queen Dutchess, official remix) uh! uh!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J] + (Wayne Wonder)
I remember when I had that little shorty uptown
In the drop we would never stop runnin around
She would lay up in the condo I was a clown
Everytime the phone rang I ignored the sound (Whoa oooh whoa oooh whoa!!!)
You would cry up on the doorstep stomp and pound
Throwin up hysterical you fell on the ground
I chose lust over love, as foul as it sounds
But that was then and this is now (LL: Uh huh uh huh)

[Wayne Wonder] + (LL Cool J)
Got somebody (Remix baby) she is a beauty (LL baby)
Very special (Dutchess baby) really and truly (Wayne Wonder baby)
Takes good care of me, like it's her duty
(Bust the dance now, higher level now, higher level now, give me the dance now)
Want you right by my side (Online now, online now) night and day
(Give me the dance now, bust the dance now)

[Chorus: Wayne Wonder] + (LL Cool J)
No letting go no holding back
(Pon the river now, pon the river now, give me the dance now, bust the dance now)
(In the club now, in the club now) Because you are my lady
(Higher level now, higher level now)
(Pon the river now, pon the river now) When I'm with you it's all of that
(Pon the bank pon the river pon the bank now)
Girl I'm so glad we made it (Online now, online now, come on, Dutchess baby)
No letting go (Wayne Wonder) no holding back no holding back no oh oh yeah
(Official remix)
When I'm with you it's all of that (Queen Dutchess: Yeah!)  all of that
(Yeah!) yeah yeah yeah
(Dutchess baby)

[Verse 2: Queen Dutchess]
I knew this was more than a crush (Crush) more than a bust
It had to be much more in storage for us (Us)
And we got a sea coast gettin live on the speed boat
It's like the sea go wherever we go (We go)
We made it now and I'm just glad to be able to let all the fables drown
So you can have more than a piece of my love
And I'm a always great you with more than a hug (LL Cool J: That's right)

[Bridge: Wayne Wonder] + (LL Cool J)

Really appreciate you lovin me (Your by my side the whole time baby)
All time, tiiiiime!!! (Let me finish the story for you check it)

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She caught me in the crib with her I was a fool
That's a major violation baby that wasn't cool
Beyond my manly pride deep down I knew
I was born to spend my life with you cause you were true (True)
So I held you in my arms real tight (Uh)
Made a valent guard that I would treat you right
I realize now it ain't all about ice
You want a good man in your life (I understand baby)

[Chorus: Wayne Wonder] + (LL Cool J)
No letting go no holding back (I understand ma!!!) because you are my lady
