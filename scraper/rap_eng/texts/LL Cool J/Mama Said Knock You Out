[Verse 1]
Don't call it a comeback,  I been here for years
Rockin my peers and puttin suckers in fear
Makin the tears, rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom!
Explosion! Overpowerin'
Over the competition, I'm towerin'
Wreckin shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare
You better move, don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin' the price

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out, mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out, mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out, mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out, mama said knock you out

[Verse 2]
Don't you call this, a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just gettin warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this
Beat like a skull; cause you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go "Bloaw"
How you like me now?
The rhythm will not allow
You to get with Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gears shift
I'm blastin, outlastin'
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shaftin'
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and make you understand
That I'm not yo' average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh
Listen to the way I slay, yo' crew
Damage, damage
Damage, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy soft sucker I'll slay him
Oakland, L.A
Oakland, Oakland

[Hook]

[Interlude]
I don't think they can handle this
I don't think they know what to do
You just got the motherfuckin shit knocked outta ya
Just let that shit rock one more time, let's do it

[Hook]

[Outro]
You have just been rocked, by the Street Sweeper Social Club
We're more than a band, we're a motherfuckin social club
