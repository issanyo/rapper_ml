[Ginuwine]
Gimme all you got girl.. gimme, gimme {*4X*}

[LL Cool J]
Uhh, yeah, uh-huh

If I'm hot for you and you hot for me
What you got for me is no shock to me
Still can't believe you're my property
The sound of you ploppin on top of me
The feelin of, hittin the lottery
Or passin "Go" twice in Mono-poly
Doesn't, dare to compare to what you got for me
The taste of the puddin is so chocolatey
Hope to seein it, so I'm seein it
Still got my sneakers and my chain on lean in it
Moonlight hit it right it start gleamin
Mean faces, for what was the meanin?
Pop it a little bit and, drop it a little bit
It's, hard to read you I feel like I'm illiterate
But I'm ready for the graduation
Yeah, right there, repeat that rotation

[Chorus: Ginuwine]
Give me all you got baby tonight (tonight)
Now's the perfect time; come blow my mind
It's cold out here please let me come inside (let me come inside)
Oooh so warm at night; you blow my mind - hey yeahhh

[LL Cool J]
Yeah baby go ahead and talk greasy
Tell me how you never had it this deeply
I'mma whisper slick, you respond sweetly
Extra freaky, I trick and you treat me
I'll give, you take, but don't hesitate
When you feel it girl, throw it right back
Just let me hold ya by your shoulders
Damn, you can take it like that?
I knew you was a champ girl
You got your leg on the dresser kickin the lamp girl
Run the shower let's head in the bathroom girl
Cause the temperature's hotter than high noon girl
I crack that do', let the steam blow
Ain't nobody here but me and you, let it go
You never had it this good, you already know
Give me all you got tonight, really though

[Chorus]

[LL] Take it to the bridge

[Interlude: Ginuwine]
You're the sexiest woman I've ever known
Baby my mind is blown
It's simply beautiful, how you do it to me (OW!)
You're showin me things I'd never do
A whole 'nother side of you (side of you)
Just keep doin what you do, it feels like ooh wee!

[LL Cool J]
You can go and have the wild climax
Ain't no way I'm 'bout to let you relax
Let me see if you can hold me on your back
Let me see you wind your body to the track
Pop it a little bit and, drop it a little bit
It's, hard to read you I feel like I'm illiterate
But I'm ready for the graduation
Yeah, right there, repeat that rotation

[Chorus]

[Ginuwine]
Gimme all you got girl.. gimme, gimme {*4X*}

[LL over Ginuwine]
Beautiful, yeah, keep it right there
I like that

Yeah, uh-huh, yeah
Awww man, yeah.. {*fades out*}
