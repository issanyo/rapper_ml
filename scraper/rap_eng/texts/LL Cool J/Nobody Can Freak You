[Intro: LL Cool J, Keith Sweat & LeShaun]
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
Nobody
You wanna do this again?
Uh huh, uh huh
You sure?
Uh huh, uh huh
Keep it right there, yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J & (LeShaun)]
A lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
C'mon baby, you gotta gimme mine
Whatever I do, I'm guaranteed to shine
I wanna see if your pony is genuine
(Better ride it right, Hi-ho silver to the early light early light baby
Slow it down a bit, get your face all yet drown in it)
No doubt, the opposite of '96
(You turn me on, sugar, lick your lips)
Girlfriend, keep it right there, face down with your hands in the air
(Yeah)
Watch my rocks
What's my M-O?
(Always hot)
As for my flow?
(It don't stop)
Am I good to go?
(Not my loss)

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you

[Verse 2: LL Cool J & (LeShaun)]
Kitty kat ain't nothin' but skin and bones
You could flip it, lick it, or leave it alone
You could grip, trick it, to each his own
(I'll make your manhood shine like chrome)
What? You could work me out
(I told you my ex-man turned me out, held me 'til I melt it down)
Pound for pound I could freal 'em out
Lover zone
(Unplug the phone)
You wild when your mama not home
(Stop, I'll shut you down, round and round, round and round)
Work it out now, c'mon, here's your reward
All aboard!
Word up, you can't get up, I'll leave your black cherry all split up, uh

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & (LeShaun)]
(Ooh all that drama sound real good, love to ride you)
Wish you would
(Yeah, but you won't call me back
Man can't take it when it's squeezed like that
I bite back, re-mat, strike that, a real live player won't do me like that)
True, what if I strip for you, dance on the bed while you under my leg
Would you suck your fingers, start to beg, or would you crawl like a tiger
And give me some head
Either way you can have it your way
(Four play all day)
A.K.A. John Mickens, so I won't be trickin'
(We doin' it, and doin' it, and  doin' it well
But you ain't gettin' shit 'til I hear weddin' bells)

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
