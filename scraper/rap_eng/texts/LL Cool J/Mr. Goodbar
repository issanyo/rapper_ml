[Intro]
Nah y'all nah y'all uh-uh
I ain't disrespectin' though
I'm just sayin' it happen to me
It can happen to him

How you doin'?
What's your name?
Uh, mmm, haha
Oh you're his girl

[Verse 1]
Hello, my name is Mr. Goodbar
I'm came to offer champagne
Later on maybe I'll tell you my real name
But for now sip your drink and be merry
And be a nice girl and save me a cherry
Me, I'll have a Kaluha and milk
Cause champagne always stains my silk
You got a man? That's somethin' we will talk about
He's smart enough to have ya, but dumb enough to let ya out
I like your Fendi bag, your alligator shoes
Your hairstyle and your whole point of view
The way you lick your lips and stare
You tell me that's a habit hmmm yeah
Honey-coated legs with not one scar
The stylish wardrobe is up to par
Here's my number, call me in my car
You deserve a visit from Mr. Goodbar

[Interlude]
So how long you been talkin' to him...word?
Nah he's cool with me, he's cool with me
Oh, he loves you?

[Verse 2]
Honey, open up a bottle of brandy
Better yet, have a piece of Cool J candy
And sweat the man with the master-disaster
Break-ya-like-plaster-plan and
The cards on the table and the deal is dealt
(Uh) I'm in the mood for a tuna melt
And I can't make you, I sure wouldn't rape you
Feelin' kinda mellow and I sure would hate to
Leave the job half-done (Nah!)
'Cause at a time like this you're the one that I'm lookin' for
Crawlin' on the floor
(WOOF!) I'm comin' back for more
If the Mona Lisa's name was Teresa
I'd get a piece o' the Mona Lisa, then smoke a cigar
You deserve a visit from Mr. Goodbar

[Interlude]
Yeah, so you be callin' on the request line...hahahaha
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh he's my man, word, him too
Yeah I like Bobby Brown
Tellin' you he's cool but...

[Verse 3]
Don't be cruel 'cause you'll be on your own
It's my prerogative and my microphone
Come and get this ice-cream cone
Or I'll deliver it when your daddy ain't home
Grown and healthy, that's how I like 'em
Big juicy legs and a nice pair of kegs
Mmm, Mr. Goodbar style
You haven't met a guy like me in a while
I jump out a cake, dance, play, shake
I ain't got no Body by Jake
Smooth as White star Extra Dry MoÃ«t Chandon
And I'll slip it in your mouth like a Bon-Bon

[Outro]
YaknowhatI'msayin'?
I'm Mr. Goodbar (Goodbar) yeah
So you know next time, uh, your man is out
Check the lobby
Nah, nah he's cool
Who, my girl?
Oh I don't know your man might be with her (uh)
YaknowhatI'msayin'? But I'm with you
Yeah Mr. Goodbar baby, uh
May I say...may I say
That outfit you got on...is slammin'
Juicy lips, so honey coated hmmm
Yo he never says that to you?
He never gives you compliments?
Yo he be givin' you flowers baby
And tellin' you how much he cares for you?
Does he hold you and caress you and give you affection?
I didn't think so...
