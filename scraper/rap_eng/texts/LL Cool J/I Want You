(Intro: LL Cool J)
Look girl, I'm not gonna sing
Cause I just don't do that

(LL Cool J)
I see you in between class and my mind skips a task
One glimpse of your eyes and my heart beats fast
A mysterious fantasy, lovely young queen
You’re pose so subtle, just like a magazine
Come and visit my sister, sit in the livin' room
Eat doughnuts and milk, listen to a pop tune
Used to be my babysitter, I want you for my woman
Without you girl, my life is bitter like a lemon
I want you

(LL Cool J)
I day dream love scenes, girl, when you pass by
I wonder what the future holds for you and I
I tell my friends fairy tales about me and you
My total devotion for you is true
See you on the bus, I trip as I get on
My body gets warm but my mind is torn
I admit you’re the queen of elegance
Maybe I’m just another puppy love nuisance
I will tell you straight up, not cologne on a letter
Opportunity knocks, I feel I just better
Disappear outta sight, rejection is my fright
To me you’re like a drug, boy, a hazy red light
I want you

(LL Cool J)
Too weak, I can’t speak, I’m messin' up in school
Just to hear your name girl, it makes me drool
As you sing falsetto on the college choir
My temperature level grows much higher
Spend the night over my house with my sister and friends
I wish you wouldn’t treat my like I’m your cousin
Your high school yearbook under my pillow
You walk by my window, I see your silhouette
Candle light is want I desire
But all I get to do is fix your flat tire
When you ring my bell purfume I smell
The aroma pierces through my heart’s shell
I tell you that my sister isn’t here today
You go away, but I wish you’d stay
Yes, girl, I’m twisted around your finger
When you leave your purfume lingers
I want you

(LL Cool J)
The clock tick-tocks as I lay in my bed
It’s visions of you circlin' through my head
I sip lemon ice tea, read a magazine
Wish we were involved in a steamy love scene
Saturday night, it’s time to party y'all
But an unseen force has my back on the wall
All eyes hit the door, red dress shines loud
The moment has come, my fantasy’s here now
You sip Gin and Tonic with the double hole straw
Finally I get the nerve to buy you one more
The bartender smirks, I whisper “He’s a jerk”
I’m wearin' leather pants and a thirty dollar shirt
Offer you some Double-Mints, sit back, crack a smile
Try to act like I’m relaxed and not a child
You see I’m sixteen and you’re in college
Lovely sweet thing please give me the knowledge
I want you

(LL Cool J)
It’s easy to detect a line that’s preset
What you don’t know is you’re the woman I’ve wanted to get
For years and now I’m here sweet dear
Cool as the snow under a polar bear
I light your cigarette with the Raphael lighter
Your dress seems like its gettin' tighter and tighter
The ice cubes melt, the heat is felt
The card’s on the table and my deal is dealt
I want you

(LL Cool J)
I had to search through  my soul, cowardice kept a hold on me
As the key was analysin' my role
As a man to instigate romance
Not break down and cry when you ask for a dance
Some fellas talk to her and she walks by
She can only say no its not do or die like Bed-Stuy
It’s Nature’s way
A sweet love story from LL Cool J
I want you
