It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake

Never use a messy recipe

[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
Break it down bitch! Lemme see you back it up!
Drop that ass down low and pick that motherfucker up
Break it down bitch! Lemme see you back it up!

Now back that pussy, tease a motherfucker, Hey!
Now back that pussy, tease a motherfucker, Hey!
Now back that pussy, tease a motherfucker, Hey!
Now back that pussy, tease a motherfucker, Hey!

Rub that shit it's yours, bitch!

Grind on the dick, make it get a little bigger!
Now turn around bitch, put that ass on a nigga
Grind on the dick, make it get a little bigger!

[Outro: Stephanie from Lazy Town]
You gotta do the cookin' by the book! HEY!
