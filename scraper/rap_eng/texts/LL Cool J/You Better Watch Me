Let's get it poppin
They like this boy rotten
I'm like I better pick ? then pick cotton
And sometimes gotta see cats to blow
I was blessed with that 20/20 vision fa sho
See its 20 mil a year 20 years in a row
First 20 mil came when I was 20 years old
I average right around 20% on my dough
Fast farward 20 years then compare my flow
Difference is I own mine and you still owe
Slackin in your mackin can't save a ho
Spekulatin at the bar over mohetoe
Like I betchya fall off, oh no he won't
So I so spit better, oh no he don't
Under 20 ass 50 if you feelin to go
Over 30 ass Rakim I ain't no joke
I'm dirty his jaws drop off wicked and went

Still bangin both, still hangin
Look like a - thank God i'm still reigning
I'm light on my feet, you can't judge me by the weigh-in
I'ts hard to grasp some of the shit I be sayin
It flys over your head like a second string is
You can't comprehend me
You couldn't place a decimal on the paper im makin
Fly man can't appreciate on castles creation
No wonder y'all keep hatin
Is L really ? young boy's debatin'
You play johnny ? i'll keep on cakin'
You can't compare me to them line for line
I'm beyond that I represent ? of time
Classic my style can't be defined
I'll be relavent forever, get it through your mind
Just watch me

With my L in the air
And a bottle of bub

With my L in the air
And a bottle of bub
