[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
I know you like your outfit stylish
Any other line but your Gap is childish
Everybody working there is your personal stylist
You're falling once you hear the Gap calling
You can't resist the shopping, big balling
Non-stop and yes-yalling
Jeans popping in every mall and town and city
G-A-P, gritty
Ready to go
For us, by us, on the low
G - that's for getting it
A - for always
P - that's for power and the people that praise
Backwards
P - for popular
A - for attitude
G - get it going daddy
Gap is on the move
How easy is this?

Fall into the Gap
*kiss peace sign*
