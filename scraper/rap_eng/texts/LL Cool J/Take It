[Verse 1 : LL Cool J]
Looking at my rollie, it’s about that time
For me to paint pictures on the walls of your mind
These quality masterpieces are hard to find
Swap from 6 to 9 to stand online
I feel like an underdog coming from behind
Pressure bus fights, relax, you’ll be fine
Ll got the remedy intervention divine
I gave you the gift for missing me
It’s all bout design

[Hook : Joe & (LL Cool J)]
For your talking, (it’s a privilege to be mine)
For your loving, (i put it all on the line)
(All nights, you can come, all day, you can shop)
(Let the bells jingeling and let the champagne pop)
12 to 6 and 6 to 9, round the clock i’m riding high
Can you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?
Let me love you babe, I won’t make you wait
Can you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?

[Verse 2 : LL Cool J]
Ignore the clock, it’s time to make the bed rock
This hood, we don’t even hear the sirens or gun shots
I’m stroking you’re floating and what not
Skin sticky but no hickies, better knock
The tensions tie, i’m outside the box
I pin on your balloon without making it pop
It feels like new year’s but 2 balls drop
Almost at the top, now you begging me to stop

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : LL Cool J]
Take a ride, look down in my eyes
Flooded like my chain I can drown in your thighs
A little bit of pain brings joy to your life
Lay your head back, relax and get right
Souls unified beneath the moonlight
It’s only you and i, no other invites
I wanna see you naked, watch you take it
Come here… so are you

[Hook] x 2
