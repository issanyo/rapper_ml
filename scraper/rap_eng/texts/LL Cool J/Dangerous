His realm is a new horizon of cuts
They expand from his hand as he conducts
A melodical project, not photography
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography

The lyrical virtuoso makes his return
All adversaries should be concerned
LL Cool J is back again
Allow me to introduce you to my friend, Cut Creator

He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave
In his division, he'll endure any collision
Like a surgeon with a scalpel, he'll make an incision
As for me I'll annihilate, exile, ex-communicate
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter
All you sucker DJ's will scatter
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy
Choreographer of cuts, Cut Creator is his name
The boy's so nice, my vocals will strain
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains
To arrange scratch patterns full of audio change
Not trigonometry, or fundamental geometry
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous

(*"I Need A Beat" - cut and scratched*)

Yeah I made it, don't look astonished
I had to remind you of what I accomplished
My scenario for your stereo
Us being beat, zero is the ratio
Cut Creator, LL Cool J
Say "Ol√©" to what we display
Battles, we don't evade, instead we invade
And all competitors will be slayed
Any comment is a compliment
No group's talent could be the equivalent
Of mine and his combined
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme
Turmoil is erased by the depth of the bass
Takin' out every sucker DJ in the place
A performance underrated, is now narrated
So Cut Creator's social status can be elevated
He's dangerous

Demolishin' DJ's in under a second
I'll quote an old phrase from my last record
The beat elevates, the scratch excels
Except I came here to raise some hell
Servin up slices and cuts like a blade
He could squeeze a dry sponge and make Kool-Aid
Acute and steady, the record turns steady
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete
His cuts evolve to get you involved
As the record revolves, DJ's dissolve
Musically, physically, mentally, he's an innovator, greater
Cut Creator is on the crossfader
So try to digest what I invent
On Farmer's Boulevard is where I rest
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego
Je pan de la francais, and Italiano
From my projects and I'll inject
Into your ears, a new concept
Conceived in silence, to be unveiled
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail
I'm dangerous
