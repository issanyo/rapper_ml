[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, checkin' 'em out
Special shout-out, keepin' on
Check it out y'all, my man in the house...

[Verse 1]
Conquerer, absolute killer of all
Taker of blood, bouncin' heads like balls
Murderer of suckers, mutilater of the meek
I get ill, so blood spills, every time I speak
Droppin bombs to amputate your ego
Suckers all weak, so let the best go, me go
They talk and talk, I invade and take over
Forget Maaco, you gonna need a make-over
I'm ferocious, animalistic, an animal
On the mic - I'm a cannibal
I eat livers, hearts, legs and arms
They crown me the King of doin' nothin' but harm
I'm in tune with the Universe and I'ma make you the first vic I kill quick, so you went from crew to hearse
I'ma Titan, keepin' you frightened
I went to the Motherland, so now I'm enlightened
There's a...

[Chorus]
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland

[Verse 2]
From [?] to [?] to Senegal to Egypt
Cool J I'm slay and I'm fully equipped
To decapitate, amputate and take titles
The legend in leather, I'ma real live idol
And Ima take souls, condemn weak men
And make microphones bend again and again
Cause, I'm bloodthirsty, why'd you try to curse me
You'll lose the battle even if you out-rehearse me
I'ma rip holes watch heads roll, like a mole
When I'm strollin' with a neck full of gold
My battles' like a blackout, you can't back out
Only difference, no time to feel a track out
It's a...

[Chorus]
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland

[Verse 3]
So come forward, admit you're guilty
Admit that your thoughts some New Jack killed me
Admit you were sleepin' on the skills of L
Now know that I handle mine, very well
I burn buildings, eat emcee's
Smack DJ's and tell conceited girls please
They try to ban hard, but I'm a vanguard
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd
King Posse ruler and high roller
You losin' it son, your games' gettin' colder
It's a...

[Chorus]
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland

[Verse 4]
I'm a Monarch, the Warlord of light
The eliminator, and I'ma score tonight
Somethin' like Merlin, but it goes much deeper
Not just another rapper with a chain and a beeper
One sample is ample for emcees'll get trampled
Bein' as you forgot, I'ma give you a sample
My vocabulary's legendary. My brother, you're temporary
So put your name in the obituary
Step back the conquerer spreads his wings
Kindergarten rappers, I'm back to change things
I rock the clearest, one hell of a lyricist
I can't miss and I'm kinda like a chemist
When I put a potion together it's clever and fatal
You can never make a move on me you're still prenatal
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get callouses
And when I'm through, you face paralysis
I'm gettin' thinner, watch me eat dinner
I'm down to skin a beginner to be a winner
It's a...

[Chorus]
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland

[Verse 5]
Who gets the roughest, you know the answer
You're a dandelion, I'm a panther
When I pick up the mic, it's bravissimo
King of braggadocio, I'm magnifico
When I rock hard, stroll long, and walk bad
Cause I know it's makes the fake sucker ducks mad
I came back to smack wacks and pull cards
Introducin' the original Todd
Just like a bloodhound but I gotcha spellbound
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throwdown
I'm like a thundercloud, I drop heavy
Hold steady, get ready, you're petty confetti
Techniques and styles - they ain't ready
Ah, ah, yeah - full of horsepower and I'ma devour
Steam-clean when I scream you're soft as cauliflower
I set the trap and caught you like a brown mouse
Then flip and do a Bruce Lee roundhouse
No threat exist, no man can stand
Say mic check and expect to take command

[Chorus]
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
