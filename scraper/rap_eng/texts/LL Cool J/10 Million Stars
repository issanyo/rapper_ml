[LL Cool J]
You can't call it a comeback
I lay back, analyse the rhymes and realise
I own that crown for lyrical
Combat
Spit more raps to count more stacks
Kickin back in the coup
I got loops relax, I'm hotness
Monotonous fans is runnin bizzack
L please don't leave the game like thizzat
Never in a million years
L'll never let you down baby
I drop 50, I steal gravy

[Hook: repeat 2X] (LL)
I look back on Venus
I look (I look) back on Mars
And (and) I burn with the fire
Of ten (of ten) million stars (guess who's back, uh)

[LL Cool J]
I'm more then a conqueror
Double up your bets
Come and rumble with the decks
I know you had that clown picked
Mind blowin out cos L still sound sick
You dream you was me
I gleam lyrically
I love 'em for it it's the highest form of flattery
Doin' the buck 10 chrome skating on the battery
My, clutch burnin' on top of the world turnin'
Rippers is just learnin by stacks I been earnin'
I'm the uncle L, future of the funk
Turn my joint up, find out why I'm different from all these chumps
And tell your favourite rapper that I'm ready to dump
For real cat, that represented rap from the jump

[Hook]

[LL Cool J]
Six figure interest on the cheddar
From music, fashion, film and televison
Poppin amaretto, so what'chu got a vendetta?
I never felt better
Now forever competition get severed by skills you can't measure
I'm a champ, you a peon
Kiss the ring, begone
Known and respected on any block you be on
And be on, stand there, get your md on
I chuckle 'cos there's nuthin' to waste energy on
There you have it
The uncut raw for rap addicts
Waited three years to see if L still had it
Ten million stars
Got beef to the death
End of my contract, I'm the last one left!

[Hook]

[Background: repeat 2X]
L worth paper
Ask Def Jam who put em up in that skyscraper
(Yeah, I take them seriously baby)
Ask my dogs up in old five, who made a major?
LL playa
Now who's next to need a paper, drop a bomb on em

[Hook plays]

[LL talking]
I look back on Venus
I look back on mars
And I burn with the fire
Of ten million stars
