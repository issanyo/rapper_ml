Mmmm yeah (mmmmm) check it out baby
Make it hot... then we drop it
(oooooooh!) Uh, yeah
(oooooooh!) Uptown, you know how we do it
Yeah you know
Make it hot

LL Cool J: It's our first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of making love kinda bore me
I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft

LeShaun: I'm gonna call you big daddy and scream your name
Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain

J: So watcha sayin', I get my swerve on, bring it live
Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight

L: Mmm... Daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like a G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga mandingo in a sec
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back

J: No doubt, I'm the player that you're talkin' about

L: Mmm...But do you really think that you can work it out?

J: I guarantee you shorty it's real, baby stick it out
Here comes the man of steel

Chorus X2:
L: Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
J: I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn

I'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot
To hit now, get down

L: Damn my lover dig down
You use a rubber?

J: Damn right

L: You are my lover?

J: All night

L: The putty good to you? Word to motha?

J: Man tight
The only thing left to do is climax
Let's make it last

L: Word we ain't goin' out like that
All this time you've been telling me that you was a Don

J: I tried to warn you girl you wouldn't listen
Now let's get it on

L: Mmm make me wild.. don't do that
Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back

J: You talk good one shorty love you're makin' me sweat
How a live nigga like it girl?

L: Nice and wet
We get it on to the break of dawn, damn your large
How a big girl like it daddy?

J: Nice and hard
Safe sexin' it, flexin' it, gettin' mad affectionate
Chewin' it, doin' it, all while we're doin' it

Chorus X2

J: Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way

L: Make it hot

J: Scheming on the ass since the first day

L: Don't stop
Damn I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce sugar

J: Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the greek fest

L: Roll up the sess

J: Pass the Hennessee

L: Put my body to the test
Way way back many niggas ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side

J: Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit

L: Press rewind
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin' back in the cut while we're under the spell

J: Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

(Chorus X3)
