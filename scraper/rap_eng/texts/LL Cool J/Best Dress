[Intro: LL Cool J (Jamie Foxx)]
Hey, hey, (ooohh), hey, hey

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx, (LL Cool J) & Both]
We gon' get it poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)
Once we start it ain't no stoppin', girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)
This is for the girls
With all those ghetto curves (hey, hey, hey!!)
But we gon' keep it poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)

[Verse 1: LL Cool J, (Jamie Foxx) + Both]
54-11's poppin' wheelies front of Willyburgers
Candy apple M3's, slidin' out gently
Rollin' up in Bentleys, Tyson was the champ then
Right after the Rooftop, years before the Hamptons
You was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough
You was so beautiful and the world was so rough
Your man was locked up 'cause the cops popped up
You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up
He was yo' crush, you was his crutch
He'll be gone a dime and it's hard to stay in touch
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much (ooh)
Now it's, broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust
Standin' up on a crowded bus, for college courses
Stay on course when it gets rough, you never lost it
Stay strong baby trust, you'll be back flossin'
Diamond studs and linen crush, keep your head up

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (LL Cool J)]
We gon' get it poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)
Once we start it ain't no stoppin', girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)
This is for the girls
With all those ghetto curves (hey, hey, hey!!)
But we gon' keep it poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)

[Verse 2: LL Cool J + Both]
Her boyfriend's comin' through with them hickeys on his neck
He claims he's lovin' her but never shows her no respect
All she knows is neglect, a lifetime of stress
Big momma, her momma, now lil' momma is next
You can see the effects of gettin' treated incorrect
'Cause she let the cycle continue, make excuses for his steps
Her girlfriends tried to warn her, all he wanted was the sex
Once he get it, then he gone, then it's on to somethin' fresh
Somethin' new, nuttin' borrowed, nuttin' blue, no wedding dress
But that's aight, you still young, you got your lifetime left
You gotta leave all that alone, find yourself
There's no love until you love you, remind yourself

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx, (LL Cool J) & Both]
We gon' get it poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)
Once we start it ain't no stoppin', girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)
This is for the girls
With all those ghetto curves (hey, hey, hey!!)
But we gon' keep it poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)

[Bridge: LL Cool J, (Jamie Foxx) + Both]
To all my ghetto girls all around the world
You know the ones with the weaves and the Shirley Temple curls
Keep fightin', uhh
Baby girl keep fightin', yeah
To all my ghetto queens survivin' by all means
There's a rock and a hard place you somewhere in between
Baby girl keep fightin', uhh
Baby girl keep fightin', yeah
To all my single mommas you been strugglin' with drama (ooh)
Doin what'chu gotta but still keepin' your honor
Baby girl keep fightin', uhh
Baby girl keep fightin', yeah yeah, sing it

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx, (LL Cool J) & Both]
We gon' get it poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)
Once we start it ain't no stoppin', girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)
This is for the girls
With all those ghetto curves (hey, hey, hey!!)
But we gon' keep it poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)

[Outro: Jamie Foxx (LL Cool J)]
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)
Get your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)
Get your best dress on tonight
