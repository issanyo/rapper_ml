[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
(Why, why me, baby) Girl, I need to know why
(Why me, baby) What did I do, girl, what did I do
(Why, why me, baby)
You broke my heart

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin' so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you'd jump out of my car
And I'd chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day (Where were you baby)
Where were you, baby (Where were you)
Who was you seein', it's a hurtin' feelin', sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin' me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin' (Nothing to you baby)
(Nothing to you baby)
I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late (No)
You hurt me, baby (No)
But hey, I'm man enough to admit it (No)
What I wanna know is why (No baby)

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
(Why, why me, baby) [Tell me why, baby, tell me why]
(Why, why me, baby) Tell me, baby
(Why, why me, baby) Tell me, baby
You broke my heart, baby [Check this out]
(Why)

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Yo, the way it happened was crazy (Umm)
We had a argument (Umm)
I didn't see you for two or three days
And then when I go to the movies to get you off my mind (Off my mind)
I see you sittin' there holdin' hands with the next man
Caught you on the phone a couple of times, but it was always your cousin
(You lie) Step off, just a friend (You used to lie to me baby)
People used to tell me, "L, she was fakin'"
But I couldn't see it, I was blinded by love (Got nothing on me baby)
Nothin' was too expensive
No night was too rainy
I was always there for you (I did everything baby)
I did things few call me a fool for doin'
Droppin' your friends off, all that
All I wanted in return was your undivided attention and love
(I need love baby)
If my heart had eyes it would cry
You're still in my world (Ooh you're still in my world)
Life is worth livin' love
Tell me why

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
(Why, why me, baby) Why would you do it to me, baby, yeah, yeah
(Why, why me, baby) Hurt me so bad when you left me, baby
(Why, why me, baby)
You broke myyyyy baby [Tell 'em what time it is, Keith]
(Why) [Tell 'em what time it is]

[Outro: Keith Sweat]
I walk around talkin' to myself
Do another day gets nothin'
Am I goin' crazy, baby
I look at the photograph that we once shared
And think about the moment, yeah, yeah
About each other
Remember the things I used to say to you, girl
There's a right and a wrong way to love somebody
I'll always give all my love to you
I'm on a merry-go-round and round
Girl, how deep is your love
I've got to go outside in the rain
It's not to late too make it last forever
Why, why, why, why me
Why, why, why, why me
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no, baby
No, no, no, no, no
Tell me not true
Ooh, do you know, do you know how much I love you
You were my woman and I was your man
Oh, girl, I'll never, never, never, never, never, never understand
