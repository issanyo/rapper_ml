[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
I got no yug lip, every brake to gale and flip the switch
Give em some you can dig out as you get out the dige
Dont matter if you rich and you stunning like you a bitch
While your brother come and erve, can't get em bag of chips
No clear necessary when Im leaning in the risk
Thou remaining the fold building baby is fighting over kicks
And find em in this frizzy, that why you talk slick
Every time you try to ball its like the world sets some ?
I see the pain in your eyes, when you alone you cry
Buff south and drink liquor for the once that die
I use to be just like you
Doffing back with the watchful
When the projects on my way to see a chick
Thats on the Bible
Grand mama pray for me, my mama slave for me
I work to become a master as cool as Jay Sourly
I wanted just too more money, fame, glory
Meditation, mental gymnastic, flip the story

Can't wait to tell the world (Tell the world)

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I wanted cheese after track
But my man got knock
He was divide intervention when the blows got back
Wasn't no loyal on my street
Wasn't no doctors on my block
Sometime I couldn't sleep thinking bout how got shot
I will hit gun shots, house I crack spots
Catch diam and getting main for gold chain
And get yourself a ring
No legend Stevie, I wander why your visions blurry
Fast lean to pain, want the meds and the hurry
One is the knowledge, two is the wisdom
Three the understand and four to catch your ? hope you God listen
Probably quality, godless build
Destroy before you born like analogy in this side for kills
Every day like hit rappers getting in plane
Is hard on the brick, say no more fucking holidays
Pow your head sownty
Then dont got love for ya
You was born a king, no matter what the world call ya

[Verse 3: Lil' Leak]
I got the school all locked I got the hit full on block
And I just told my brother, he ain't gotta sell no rack
Remember rocks in the sap, pay the block with the glop
I just try to get a mil, I will be on top
They told me hustles dont sleep
Too busy chasing that guap
So I ain't gonna sleep, I go chasing that guap
And I ain't stop until hit the top
And I came from nothing, I gotta get to the money
Cuz my family hungry
Can't wait to show that world that Imma be on that stage
Imma make it just to put a smile on my mamma face
And this struggle got me stressing
Need a mil plan from the city where nigga shutting case ery day
Show the world
