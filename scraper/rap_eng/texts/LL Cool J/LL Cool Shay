[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
I need lust
Is that aight?

[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
You looking at me like this guy looks familiar
If you don't remember from where, it's probably gonna kill you
But I'll give you a hint: I'm there when you sleep
Not the Sandman, it's me, the man of your dreams
Sheesh, I think this is the house that love built
For two, I love you like cookies love milk
Even if the milk spilled, I wouldn't shed a tear
I'm a man, even better, I'm your man
For real, so baby, let's make a deal, let's set off like rockets
And kick it, we can do something that's easy on my pockets
"How we gonna fun when he ain't got no funds?"
Well, I may not have ones, but change gonna come
Get it? Like toll booths, I told you the truth, let's split
I think I see your ex over there talking shit
Y'all been broke up, this ain't recent
I want to talk man-to-man, but he on some zone defense
He making me laugh, this dude is bitch
Can't let go of the past with that kung fu grip
[?] I think we're about to finally get managed
Telling me how she met Casey back in Los Angeles
"Didn't he tell you I'm the one with no panties?"
Boo, you know how many it be with no panties?
Please, but I do remember your eyes
And I remember your thighs, it was December, that's right
Then we jet off in the ride to my humble abode
It ain't take us no time to come out of them clothes
She wanted me to take it slow, I wanted her to take it off
We ended up doing both, now nobody gets a loss
Usually, I want to hit it fast like speed bags
But for you, I'ma take it slow like relax
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics
And if you need them, I got crazy
There's more space in my room, it's galactic
Chiropractic, there is where all of the backs spent
My bedroom is my workplace
My dick hate to babysit, so I dropped the kids off at her place
Or I drop my kids off at her face
Oh, oh I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
Uh, we need to turn this music up louder
Skeet on her like rain, now that's what I call a baby shower

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah, I'm sorry
I need lust
And let's keep it moving
