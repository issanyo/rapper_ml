[Hook - 50 Cent]
You know for sure we ain't playin'
When you hear us sayin'
It's a Queens thing, mayne
If ya ask us what zip we claim and what hood we from
We say Queens! Queens! Queens!

[First Verse - Prodigy]
Now we're tuned with the sounds of the best
Niggas that ever do it and still doin' it the best
This is what it sound like, over in QU
The projects is haunted houses, real demons and ghouls
Ya shakin' in ya shoes, get some henny, light a dutch
Smokin' back to back bogies, you scared to death son
Out here is real tough, niggas'll line you up
Real sharp like the barber, get your hair cut!

[Second Verse - 50 Cent]
I bang bang and boogie, ya blood on my hoodie
You outside stuntin' with ya jewellery all goodie
Is easy, mayne, believe me mayne
When I heard of a jux that'll ease the pain
I'm the shittiest nigga, I cut the prettiest nigga
From his ear to his chin, I don't care if you his friends
Yeah, I did it back then, and I'll do it again
I catch a flashback on ya jack and wave the Mac 10, "Man, Take That Shit Off!"

[Hook - 50 Cent]
You know for sure we ain't playin'
When you hear us sayin'
It's a Queens thing, mayne
If ya ask us what zip we claim and what hood we from
We say Queens! Queens! Queens!

[Verse 3 - LL Cool J]
I don't slide like Usher, I don't make no bands
I ain't a frontin' ass coward, I don't rinse soundscans
I wish Rick 'n' Russell was back, I miss tha old Def Jam
Cos them new monkies act like they don't know who I am!
The promotion and marketing wasn't worth a damn
Now they on the balls again, cos Fifty my man?!
It's a Queens thing, doofy, this is how we do
We rep our hood, goofy, how bout you?
This is L talkin' not some Patr√≥n and trees
Look at the calibre of playas that roll with me
Now I'm back on top where I'm 'posed to be
And ya'll payin' the respect that niggas owe to me
Queens, nigga!

[Hook - 50 Cent]
You know for sure we ain't playin'
When you hear us sayin'
It's a Queens thing, mayne
If ya ask us what zip we claim and what hood we from
We say Queens! Queens! Queens!

[Verse 4 - Kool G]
Yeah we Queens dude, ya know what it is pap
They walk upon you force you in the whip, barrels poked in ya ribs pap
Glare from a six shot, bills wallin' the hiccup
Apes with a shaper from C76 block
Queens home of the gulliest goons fuzzy the goon
With fifty calibre gun smoke, mac 1 and 1 toast
Back when I slung dope, sling a batch
Stainless gat packed it back to the D.O.C. and the Run crew
Played the P.E. logo, put in front of the gun scope
Queens hear me boy boy, bring it here where they slump folks
Dizzy with the cateridge -n - ready on your marks you spin
Got their hands shakin' like parkinson ya feel me?

[Hook - 50 Cent]
You know for sure we ain't playin'
When you hear us sayin'
It's a Queens thing, mayne
If ya ask us what zip we claim and what hood we from
We say Queens! Queens! Queens!

[Verse 5 - Tony Yayo]
My seat laid back
Finger on the trigger
Tints on the hoopty, listenin' to Thriller
"Mama se, mama sa, Mama coo sa"
I got sixteen shots in my Ruger
I put one in ya brain, ya medulla
I'm in Southside Queens with my Luger
I'll turn ya dreams into nightmares like Kruger
But I'm not from Elm Street, I'm from GUY BREWER R
Yeah!

[Hook - 50 Cent]
You know for sure we ain't playin'
When you hear us sayin'
It's a Queens thing, mayne
If ya ask us what zip we claim and what hood we from
We say Queens! Queens! Queens!
