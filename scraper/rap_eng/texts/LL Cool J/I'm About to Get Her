[LL Cool J] (R. Kelly)
Woo, and you say New York City, ah uh
Back by popular demand (ah yayaya yaya yaya)
You been waitin' in the baby for so long baby
We had 'em starvin', ay yo E, the big homey

[LL Cool J]
Star studded, my ear lobes is flooded
DJ's wanna rub it, bootleggers wanna dub it
Easy does it, ladies love it, cats with big budgets
BB Jay, two jets and Tar Smith luggage
Clowns talkin' rubbish and pretending they thuggish
But I'm a young living legend like Pee Wee at the ruckus
I was raised out of Queens but rap kept me off it
Cover of Feds Magazine, put me in the Gulf stream
Ya man done it, push the E-X one hundred
And you don't want it, I got the whole rap game cornered
Watch me flaunt it, damn right I'm iconic
Soon as next find a icey track, I slide on it

[R. Kelly]
I know there's gotta be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I'm about to get her
And I know there's gotta be some kinda chick up off in here that's got the hots for me
I'm about to get her
See I know there's gotta be one sexy little freak that wanna leave with me
I'm about to get her
I know it's gotta be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I'm about to get her

[LL Cool J]
The beach front estate, mega yacht by the lake
The safe in the floor with a lifetime of cake
Wifey email and make my side vibrate
Cats still can't believe I'm hot, I got 'em irate
The hip-hop boss of the empire state
Cats never front on me, they know I drive weight
It's the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J
Been platinum so long, my skin's turning grey
Ok, they don't know how to act
And my BDS was miles ago to Cali and back
Minimum, private jets in the millennium
Plenty of Benjamins, hot ladies and gentlemen

[R. Kelly]
Girls, they girls, they girls, so sexy
Girls, they girls, they got much body
Girls, they girls, they showin' bellies
You're the girl in my fantasy

I know that it's ridiculous for y'all to picture this
The way I keep rein' up, servin' and flippin' this
Dot the I's, cross the T's, meticulous
The coldest Winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish
The movement is flavor, full bags of licorice
The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
There's no forgettin' this, the way I'm reppin' this
My bodyguard's big but do that make me rebellish
I'm in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson
That's why I'm still a teen pop idol like Hanson
Young, black and handsome, movin' with the cheddar
Bring honey to the V.I.P., I'm about to get her, let's go
