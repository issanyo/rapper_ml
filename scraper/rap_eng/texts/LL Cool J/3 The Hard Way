You ready killa

So let's do a little somethin' like this

El Shabazz! Yo J! It's time to rock a rhyme
What kind of rhyme? The kind of rhyme that digs y'all behind
I'll rhyme it, I'll mix it, and we both do fine
Take a skeezer to the (?) (?) Calvin Klein
El Shabazz! Yo J! Our rhymes are fly
How fly? So fly that they're sweet like pie
And the pie is so fly, the girls will all wanna try
El Shabazz! Yo J! It's time to rock our shit
What kinda shit? The kinda shit that made Wilson Flip
So you use a brush, I use a comb not a pick
El Shabazz! Yo J! El Shabazz! Yo J!
We gonna rock this mother fucker like Three The Hard Way
Like this y'all! This y'all, This y'all, This y'all
Dededede dededede this y'all

Yeah boy
Now that you done bought it, ha ha ha ha
Check this shit out, Check this shit out
Yo, turn this shit on the other side, I'm tellin' you, the other side is liver than this side
You like this side, but you'll like the other side, cause the other side is better

Yo, Shabazz, is it live? It's definitely live. Is it live? It's live
It's live? It's live. It's live, it's live, it's live, it's live
Like this y'all, this y'all, this y'all, this y'all
Rock it to the beat, to the beat y'all
