[Intro]
Ayo this is the infinite, intelligent, extravagant and eloquent
That shit y'all talkin' is irrelevant
I put it down from the gutter to the tenement
It's LL Cool J, nigga, everything I do is excellent
And I got to represent, Q-Boro, the thorough
Y'knawmean? We get down, we get down baby
Check this shit out right here, uh

[Verse]
E Pluribus Unum is the album I'ma drop
It'll make your bitch nipples as hard as rocks
Givin' head to the Glock, pretend it's hard cock
Splashin' niggas, I came slow through the block
I, the original, visual, individual
Ten times platinum, your career's lookin' critical
Rich from this, motherfuck bein' a criminal
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal
You wanna freestyle? Fuck that
I need at least seven figures to even touch that
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fuckin' with me
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four
And 2001 will be mine, by law
Why'd I name it 'Greatest Of All Times?'
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standin' in line
Lovin' the way I shine and my lyrics combine
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch
Back in the days it was the M-5 stick
But now the Bentley Azure get more whores on the dick
This one's for Clue and my Rikers Island niggas
That remember when I came through
The bing O B C C H D M 2 C 74
Little Nasi and the crew, y'all niggas come home

[Outro]
Word up, the new album gon' be the shit baby
Ain't no doubt about it, E Pluribus Unum
Out of many, one, The G.O.A.T., Greatest Of All Time...
