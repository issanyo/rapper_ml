[Intro]
Uh he huh, remix that joint, word up
We had to remix that joint, smooth it out
Uh he huh, yeah, no doubt, doin' it, yeah
Yeah, uh uh doin' it, woo
Feeling is strong, uh doin' it
Yeah uh, yeah, it's me and Jimmy

[Verse 1]
I'm in the mood for something wild and obscene
I hear that, I'm gettin' tired of the same ol' routine
I need some drama, oh, here I come L, tattoos and dim lights
Black young niggette want you's to get it right
Huh, that's all I need, we got two mouths to feed
You talkin' about some love to the six indeed, so uhh
Lay back and let'cha Daddy do it
A real mack stay on track, he got the run, right through it

[Chorus]
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn

[Verse 2]
I slowed it down 'cause we was amplifore
Halfway, all the way, now ya gettin'
Raw to the [?], sick wit' it
Ain't to proud to beg, boy, that's why I had to hit it, uhh
I'm in the zone gettin' bedrooms props
I'm talkin' outside scenarios, Ac's and parking lots
Word, you goin' there, can back seats and wild treats
Daddy do his thing, it's part of my mystique
I'm havin' visions on sunsets and waterfalls
Your hands are in the air, you're up against the wall
What you lookin' for? Point it out
Promise I'ma get it, send it to me, right away rule, wanna hit it

[Chorus]
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn

[Verse 3]
I need that new Benz, you in it, testin' my limits
Laid back, cut, now I twist some lyrics
Sharin' cream like it's love, I'm ready now
What you say when I put it on, you lovely girl
You can never hesitate to do your thang, true
Although you come from Queens, I'ma treat you like a king
Where you from? Brooklyn
Honey-coated, in front of genius, gettin' [?] in the 'lacs
Tell me why you never wanna see your ex again?
Hey Lover, you separate the Boyz from the Men, that's a fact
It's well known why you lick your lips
Yeah, blowin' bubbles in blup-blup-blup
You makin' me wonder if doin' it's everything it seems
You make me shiver, standing up in ya straight and then I lean
Tell me here, I love it when ya way up in my mix
Everything is butter in the 9-to-the-6

[Chorus]
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn

[Outro]
