(Remix time!)

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Tellin’ me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
It's like the second time around, a teenage love
I won't won't won't hurt you again
This time I'm holdin’ you down ‘til the end
We back bouncin’ again
Back seat of the jeep
Make you bounce like the 6-4 with Snoop and his friends, uh

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
Nothin’ really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Can't wait to get home
Baby, dial your number
Can your pick up the phone?
‘Cause I wanna holla
Daydreamin' ‘bout you
All day in school
Can't concentrate
Tryna keep my cool
‘Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
I just don't want, I just don't want, to say goodbye

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
Nothin’ really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
I love our secret meetings
On the 5th floor staircase
I wanna give you this letter
Of all the things I can't say
Want you to be
My first, my last, my ending and beginning (Yeah)
I'll write your name in my book
Your last name, my first, I'm your misses
‘Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
I just don't want, I just don't want, to say goodbye
(LL: Damn, baby, got me feeling like I’m 17 or somethin’
Check it)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Excuse me, Miss Keys, you’re on
Uh uh on; uh uh on
Back to basics before the Louis Vuitton
Hand in hand with matching sweatsuits on
I wrote you love letters to make you feel better
We'd spend the day together when you fightin’ with ya mom
Sippin’ on quarter waters, too broke for champagne
Sayin’ ‘Don't, don't, don't hurt me again’

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
Nothin’ really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
A teenage love
Whoa whoa whoa
Don’t, don’t hurt me again
Don’t, don’t, don’t hurt me again

Teenage love
Whoa whoa whoa
Don’t hurt me again
Don’t, don’t hurt me again

[Slick Rick “Teenage Love” sample]
A teenage love
A teenage love
Don’t, don’t hurt me again
Don’t, don’t, don’t hurt me again
A teenage love
(Repeat until end)

(Swizz Beatz over sample)
You’re listening to the sounds of Alicia Keys
Y’all know who it is
Rock…rock…rock on…rock, rock on
