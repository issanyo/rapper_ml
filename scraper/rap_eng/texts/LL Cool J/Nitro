[LL Cool J]
Check this
I excel, they fell, I said - well, hell
L can yell or make em melt like gel
I signed the contracts that bills'll stack
Play the wall or fall I stand tall you're small in fact
Step aside, you might get fried
By the super technique that the rapper applied
As a matter of fact, the impact will distract
Your attention away, from the rest who say
They can mess with Cool J the best of today
You fess cause the rhymes are so funky fresh
I'mma attack smack and make em stand back
Black strong as Cognac I got the knack
To rhyme to the rhythm of this, and give em a gift
That's swift, other rappers are stiff and don't riff with
Mr. Smith, cause that ain't safe
I get you wide open like an uncut eighth
I write to fight, don't bite, to reach heights
The mic makes right, give me the spotlight
So I can prove the pen is mightier than the sword
LL hard as hell, the lyrical lord
The counterfeit misfits that rap had to admit that
My rhymes are so dangerous, I need a permit to rap
Solo, on the microphone
MC's -- don't let me catch you alone
I'm nitro!

Yo, I got the kick of a kettle drum, guaranteed to overcome
You're just a minimum, messin with the maximum
And when I swung my tongue among the high strung
Young MC's, they all got done by the legend
Every second I'm wreckin
Not a mistake you'll find, but you can keep checkin
Out the sound you'll find that it's genuine
Bet that you'll rewind this a thousand times
You can taste the bass like it's filet-of-sole
I leave the microphone full of bullet holes
I drop the bomb like I'm in 'Nam and go beyond
The normal boundaries of too much harm
To MC's, but as they say please I freeze
Rhymes like these kill like a disease
Tried to fill my shoes, and caught the blues
Because they get bruised by the rhymes I choose
I kill rappers at random, I don't understand em
The ones I didn't get, are on a memorandum
Lines I recite are spontaneous
The nursery rhymes you write, are miscellaneous
So pass the crown, bow down and give in
I'm the Prince of Rap, that's how we livin
Settin milestones on the microphone
Empires are overthrown, and I ain't even baritone
No joke I spoke then God stroke
As Job tried to sweat the style and got soaked
Conquered and killed on the microphone
MC's -- don't let me catch you alone
LL's nitro!
Nitro!

Yo, flammable -- like gasoline
Threatening -- like a guillotine
It's like a bad dream when you battle my team
I go to every extreme to make MC's scream
I'm clever, I last forever, we can do whatever
With whoever, whenever, I never
Ever got rocked, stopped or dropped
They got popped, by the hip-hop rock that I concoct
I'm so nice yo, flowin with the maestro
Murderin and hurtin MC's because I'm nitro
The earthquakes'll kill snakes and fakes
You can't flake, you made a mistake, give me a break, thanks
Now that we're straight and that's clear
Watch all the big mouths - dissapear
Disintergrate, deteriorate, fall
I demonstrate, and devastate you all
There's no doubt about the fact I turn it out, the wack
Be on the lookout, LL made a comeback
Full of power, I'mma devour
I stand tall as a tower, I won't allow a
MC to C-O-M-E, C-L-O-S-E
Play me long D-I-S-T-A-N-C-E, M-C's
On the microphone, I'm nitro!
Nitro!
Yo (funky)

I daze amaze faze blaze and beat em down
Nowadays they crave and praise, the funky sound I pound
Rhymes I write em in, recite em and then slide em in
Order to slaughter comp and stomp soon as I begin
Total domination, across the nation
Devestation, cut sensation, it's the invasion
Of L the Terrible, devastating rhymin wiz
I cut through through do and chew, you know what time it is
Slick, I kill for kicks, vic you quick
Hard as bricks, rock ya sick over the mix
The L, L, C, O, O -- L J Period now you know bro!
N-I-T-R-O yo, go for what you know
Unless you're dumb cause yo, I'm nitro-glycerin
Listenin and takin notes
Icin enticin and slicin throats
