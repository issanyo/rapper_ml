[LL Cool J]
Uhh, yeah (si papi.. uhh, uh-huh)
Uh-huh (I see you papi, si)

I was in Madrid yo
Had this hot club shootin my video
They was burnin up the floor to that reggaeton
Estaba bailando soon as they put the record on
I was sweatin like a bullfighting matador
It was the sexiest scene that I ever saw
(La fiesta, tu mi a fuego)
But I was still cool in my light blue Kangol
I met this girl, she was off the chain yo
Cooley head model from San Diego
Father was from Trinidad, Tobago
Mother was from Rio, de Janeiro
She said please don't think I'm crazy
But I've been in love with you since the 80's
{?} cansando baby
Have you ever been with a latin lady?

[Chorus]
Uhh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)
Uh-huh (and I'll do anything to prove it)
(If I can get wit'cha)
Uhh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)
Uh-huh (and there's so much I would do if)
(If I can get wit'cha)

[LL Cool J]
She said I wanna get wit'cha
I'm talkin more than an autograph and picture
(Tu quiere, benita mi casa)
I mumbled to myself, she's a monster
She said (yo no se lo que no habla)
Don't worry 'bout it lil' mama nada
The chemistry and energy was gettin hotter
This ain't like me but I feel like I gotta
She started movin near me
Whispered in my ear so I could hear more clearly
Said grab my waist and look in the mirror
Then started windin it like Shakira
All that shakin and belly dancin
I was goin under, I ain't stand a chance man
If I do this, will I love it or regret it
Tempted and I don't know where this is headed

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
(Wit'cha, wit'cha) Uhh (uhh)
Yeah (si papi, uhh)
(If I can get wit'cha)
(Si papi, si) Uh-huh
(Papi) If I can't get wit'cha

Then she kept beggin sayin let's go
Pullin on my arm, wouldn't let go
Rubbin my face, kissin my neck slow
Muy dulce, hanblando con carino
She said (ooh papi te quiero mucho)
(I love you better than any woman you know)
Just then my lady hit my cell phone
I'll let y'all figure out the rest yo

[Chorus]
