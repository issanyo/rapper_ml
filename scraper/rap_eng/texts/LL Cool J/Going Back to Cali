I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, I don't think so
Going back to Cali, stylin', profilin'
Growlin' and smilin' while in the sun
The top is down on the black Corvette
And it's fly 'cause it's sittin' on Dayton's
Laurents steering wheel, plushed out
Gold-leaf phantom top and three girls wait
Engine's blowin', the chrome is shining
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind, back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, shakin' 'em, bakin' 'em
Takin' 'em to spots they never before hung
But fuck that place, on Sunset it's a trip
Where the AC's cold and the girls still strip
The record skip but this girl kept dancin'
Prancin', grindin', grinnin', romancin'
I asked her to the barn so we could hit the hay
I wanna do this, Brutus but I don't wanna pay
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, no man, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, fuck that, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, risin', surprisin'
Advisin', realizin', she's sizin' me up
Her bikini, small heels, tall
She said, she liked the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast but this girl was faster
She's lookin' for a real good time
I said, "Close your eyes, I got a surprise"
And I ran away with the bottle of wine
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, no man, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, fuck that, I don't think so
