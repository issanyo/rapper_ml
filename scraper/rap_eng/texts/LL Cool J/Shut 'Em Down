[Verse 1]
I can shut a nigga down so quick my sounds so sick
My talents spread around while I'm holdin' my dick
Ridiculous shit flip immaculate
Evolutionary flows y'all want more dough
Bang with the best, get a vest, all the rest, should've blessed
Rip a nigga from the East to the West
Just a lyrical maze, lyrical days
God works in mysterious ways
I'm the warlord of war relieve the raw dog
Niggas ain't even comin' close to my low score
Niggas fleein' when I'm rippin' on the hardcore beat
That's slammin' through your jeep like a .44 MAC to your back
Nigga L never got ripped by a track
I don't fuck around, always come back
For the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the bat
Looked at every nigga with the mic on my arm
A time-bomb blowin' up ring the alarm
Cool double O flow well to the LL
I'm leave the world looking hard as hell

[Chorus]
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)

[Verse 2]
To the next plateau niggas bet my flow
Betta bet I role with more control
Gotta bring the heat that eliminate who can't compete
Spit razors to rip the beat
Relentless endless friendless when it comes to the lyrical mack
Now off my back stack 'em drag 'em now feds waggin'
Hear you fasten place on the blood of my veins without passion
Mashin take a little time to think the rhyme out
How to find out
Bump and grind out
Pump the lines out
I'ma show what the microphone is all about without doubt
C to the double O bounce in the bubble eye limo
No I ain't checkin' for you bull shit demo
Every time you hear me in a battle I'm lethal
Nigga too sweet 'n low you ain't equal

[Chorus]
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)

[Verse 3]
I can take you to the level if I let my phantom
Nigga bout to rule the world with one anthem
Kidnapped rap for a handsome ransom
Smoke a little Branson on the side of the mansion
Keep it thugged out even when a nigga dancing
Branson make that trans and keep it dancing
I'ma murder every nigga in the game
Can't stand the rain
Fuck a maintain
Gotta leave the world in flames
Nigga wanna live life stay out of my lanes
Tryin' to read my name
Here's a murderous combo with you on your pain
Sideways stimulator bringin' the flames
Niggas wanna feel me spit the whole clips
Sing along it will split your lip
.45 with a name on the grip
Niggas said you wanna battle
Nigga now talk shit

[Chorus]
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
I shut 'em down (get off me, you can't hold me)
