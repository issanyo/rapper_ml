When Im Alone In My Room Sometimes I Stare At The Wall
But In The Back Of My Mine I Hear my conscience Call
Telling Me I Need A Girl Who's As Sweet As A Dove
But Fuck That My Name HOV And You know Im Thug
So If You Stuck Off Love i Suggest You Get Over It
Ma Cry Me A River Build A Bridge And Get Over It
They Love It When Im Hard On Hoes
They Said A G Don't Give A Bitch No Keys Or Security Codes
I Agree My Lady AinÂ´t No Bitch She Get Whatever I Own
So When You See Understand Thats Me Nigga
Understand Im still the same OG Nigga
I know the difference between a bitch and a B, Nigga
