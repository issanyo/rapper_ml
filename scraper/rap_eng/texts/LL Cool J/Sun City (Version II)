Aaah, Sun City
Na na na na na, Sun City
Na na na na na.....
A way to South Africa

We got to say I, I, I
Ain't gonna play Sun City
I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City
Everybody say I, I, I
Ain't gonna play Sun City
I, I, I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City

Relocation to phony homelands
Separation of families
I can't understand

23 million can't vote
'Cause they're black
We're stabbing our brothers
And sisters in the back

I wanna say I, I, I
Ain't gonna play Sun City
I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City

Our government tells us
We're doing all we can
Constructive engagement is
Ronald Reagan's plan
Meanwhile people are dying
And giving up hope
Well, this quiet diplomacy
Ain't nothing but a joke

I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City
I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City

It's time to accept our responsibility
Freedom is a privilege
Nobody rides for free
Look around the world, baby
It cannot be denied
Somebody tell me why
We're always on the wrong side

I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City
I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City

Na na na na na, Sun City
Na na na na na.....
A way to South Africa

Boputhuswana is far away
But we know it's in South Africa
No matter what they say
You can't buy me
I don't care what you pay
Don't ask me Sun City
Because I ain't gonna play

I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City
Lemme hear you say
I, I, I, I, I, I
Ain't gonna play Sun City
I don't wanna play Sun City

Relocation to phony homelands
Separation of families
I can't understand

23 million can't vote
'Cause they're black
We're stabbing our brothers
And sisters in the back

I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City
I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City.........
