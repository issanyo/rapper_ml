It's real funny youknowhatImean?
I like can't believe this y'know
Jealousy like tried to move on me youknowhatI'msayin?
So I said nah I ain't gonna, y'know
Make no energetic hyped up yellin, type joint, knowhatImean?
I'm just gon' cool back, youknowhatI'msayin?
Word up to this slow gangster beat type thing
Check it out yo..

Jealousy - I wanna kill him and shoot him
He's a sucker - I'd like to execute him
Recruit him - put him in my school and school him
I said somethin simple, and I knew that I'd fool him
He's only mediocre, jealousy can't get with me
Hang up your clothes, cause jealousy ain't spent to me
He's just a monkey, ridin my back
In fact I kidnap, ramsack, hijack and backslap the fool..
.. see my name is Cool J
I play for keeps, the microphone's my tool
I've been holdin back long enough I had to bring it
Jealousy is in the house y'all, fellas sing it

Jealous.. Jealous..
There's no need to be
Jealous.. Jealous..
Bih mellow, youknowhatI'msayin?
Jealous.. Jealous..
Gangster groove, word up knowhatI'msayin?
Jealous.. Jealous..
Check it out y'all

I'm not lackadaisical or lazy on the microphone
I bring the bacon home so jealousy go home
Or play the wall and pout about the way the prince is rollin
So when they give it up, stand back and start foldin
All your jealous show clothes, I think you need to grab a
Half-pint of Cisco and hang out with Backstabber
Cause I'mma break down all walls Jealousy built
And then walk tall, like I'm standin on stilts yeah
Jealousy the jam is mean you'll have to rewind it
If you didn't know about him, you must have been blinded
Ask him if I'm right, he'll tell you he sure is
Excuse me for a moment, fellas sing a smooth chorus

Jealous.. Jealous..
KnowhatI'msayin? Smooth, word up
Jealous.. Jealous..
Huh, crazy gangster beat, youknowhatI'msayin?
It's like a gangster lean
Jealous.. Jealous..
Yeah yeah youknowhatI'msayin?
It's Cool J in the house, youknowhatI'msayin?
Jealous.. Jealous..
Word up, check it out
Check it, yo

Thank you fellas, the way you sung the chorus was swift
But now it's time to pump lyrics, and shoot the gift
His name is Jealousy fellas see what I mean now turn it out
Without a doubt and if it hits you in the heart don't pout
Cause I'mma hit Jealousy and his posse where it hurts a lot
Him and his boys have a habit, they always smirk a lot
And make mean faces, I see em in many places
Scared to face us, they wish they could erase us
Or outdo us, can't do damage and never will
The Legend in Leather is clever, man I'mma never chill
Allah take a break from this, yo I love swingin
Yo E, pop the bubbly, fellas, start singin

Jealous.. Jealous..
KnowhatI'msayin?
It's like a crazy gangster groove, youknowhatImean?
Jealous.. Jealous..
Huh-huh, Jealousy ain't got no wins, youknowhatI'msayin?
Jealous.. Jealous..
Yo but it ain't nuttin youknowhatI'msayin?
Cause yo I'm the prince of rap knowhatI'msayin? Word up
Jealous.. Jealous..
Yo.. it's crazy.. I am the one
Bust it

Oooh yeah, now I'mma wind it up
It's time to move on and end the Jealousy cut
And head off with a bang that sang and kicked your brain in
I flowed like water now I'm finished explainin
In the spotlight tonight his name was Jealousy
And for some strange reason, it seems fellas be
Fallin for him, I hope you understood
Stay away from him he ain't no good

YouknowhatI'msayin man yo (that's word yeah I hear that)
Yeah word up (can't hang out man)
Yo it ain't nuttin yo yaknowwhatI'msayin
