[Verse 1: Julian Nuller]
It's 4 I'm getting kind've lonely
She wanna ride a nigga said baby show me ha
Take you out of state take you outer space
All I do is magic baby call me Johnson for the taste
Now look tell me how you kick it
Finger lickin' freak is somethin' not to mention
All the positions are relentless and you trippin'
Cause I've been teachin' shit I'm the one with the lessons
Now hold up step one, two
How many bitches know the deal when it's just us dudes?
How come act I act up real you act a fool?
This game ain't for real if you got no tools ha
Damn this flow type Cool J
You know me but nigga's salty as frito lay
Told the baby girl I'm on my way
Read between the lines girl kiss kiss bang bang ha
I call the shots on the whole damn thang
Patron, Vodka and the fuckin' ice cold dranks
With the cheese, crackers and the whole damn trays
I'm 'bout to call Trish up and you would hear me say
"Bitch you ain't shit you think you slay?"
"With the mindset from the third grade"
"Watch a real one walk my way my way"
"Cause she doin' it well baby all day"

[Hook: Julian Nuller + Cheer Dolor]x2
And we doin' it well now yeah
How we doin' it well now yeah
How doin' it well
How we doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well now

[Verse 2: Cheer Dolor]
I say cheese
Photo with a couple of a ting a ting sheesh
Mama recognizes the bling the bling
She notices I'm doin' it well
So we sparked a conversation then we lit double L's
Now we drippin'  lickin' lickin' mama callin' me J
Leave ya drippin' drip drippin now I'm lickin' my way
To your palace how I'm wildin' I ain't cuffin' today
Had my keys cause Khaled done sold his away
I say cheese
Photo with a couple of a ting a ting sheesh
Mama recognizes the bling the bling
She notices I'm doin' it well
So we sparked a conversation then we lit double L's
