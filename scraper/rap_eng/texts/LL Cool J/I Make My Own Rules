You know the rules of the game, baby
We can handle this like gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
This is big time rock'n'roll, baby

Nobody can tell me what to do!
I'm the rebel, with a cause, breakin the curfew
An international threat to the power structure
Scream when your eardrums rupture
Anarchy, primal terror!
My God!.. It's a brand new era!
The world revolves on an economic axis
And if it slips, everybody drips
Black and white in a fight for green
While the yellow and red get caught between
Wannabe gangstas livin a lie
Gettin rich while they glorify genocide
Homicide, suicide, politicians tounge-tied
Westside, Eastside
What's the difference? If you ride, you ride
If you live, you live but if you die, you die
And I...

(Back on up!) I make my own rules!
(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!
(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Check it out, ha!
(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!

Uh! Gimme mine, give it up
Give it back, I can't let it slide like that (Nah!)
Everybody want a free ride
And most of my fake-ass friends got snake eyes
Ready for a fight to the death
Protect the innocent, 'til it ain't none left
Homeboy - guilty, homegirl - guilty
Who are you to play judge and jury?
Filled with fury, the wrath of a tyrant
Who's to blame when the young get violent? (Uh!)
When the Glock cocks, it pops, many drop
And if his momma get him help, will he stop?
Dangerous, walkin' on the edge
No aim to us, stop blamin' us!
For the rules that you made, games that you played
Seems you got it made, why are you so afraid?!

(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Watch out now!
(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!
(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Check it out now!
(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!

Harlem, Bosnia
Church burnin, the Middle East
No justice, no peace
Gangsta rapper, now deceased
And what can we learn from this?
Eventually the guilty burn from this
It's a universal threat
Time bomb tickin, the clock is set
Generation X, live and direct
The Constitution, execution
Emancipation, annihilation
Inferior rights for all stereotypes
Amsterdam got bright red lights
New York's the apple, Hollywood's the dream
Ll Cool J must see cream!
Red Hot Chili Peppers down with the team
From the cradle to the grave, we will sing this theme!

(Back on up!) I make my own rules! C'mon now!
(Back on up!) Ha! I'm my own man, I make my own rules!
(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Check it out now!
(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!

Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules!

(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Ah!
(Back on up!) Ha! I'm my own man, I make my own rules!
(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Check it out now!
(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!

Break it down!

Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules
Make the rules, break the rules!
