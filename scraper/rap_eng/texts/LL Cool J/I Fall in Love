[Elan sings something incomprehensible]

[LL Cool J]
Uhh, uhh
Girl when I watch you it's like a dream
You look like you stepped out a magazine
I feel like an addict, you make me fiend
As if you were dancin on a triple beam
I watch your body move back and forth
That's the shit that make Strahan want a divorce
The move is such a seductive way
I feel like Reg in the bush with Kincaid
Never seen a girl in the world
That moves her body, like you do
Have to party, invitin you
Wish I could spend my whole life with you
If that's too much just a night with you
Kick back and turn off the lights with you
As long as it's, exciting you
Whatever it is, I like it too

[Chorus: LL Cool J] + (Elan)
When I look in your eyes, I fall in love
Girl every time I look at your thighs, I fall in love
You're number one - tell all the guys I fell in love
You make me feel like I won a prize, I'm so in love
That good good love (I'm gonna make you love me)
(I'm gonna make you love me)
(I'm gonna make you love me)
(Love me, loooooove) Stop playin girl

[LL Cool J]
If I'm victim of circumstance
It's because you're killin me when you dance
I jump right out of that ambulance
Like B.I.G. I want "One More Chance"
I got questions, you got the answers
Your body is a {?} but you have to master
I'm not your slave but I'm willin to play
I'll search for oil, start drillin away
Turn off your iPhone, we chillin and hey
We'll be sippin Patron, couple gallons a day
Let's take our clothes off, bombs away
Pick a song, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo or Ray J
To get you in the mood, now you ready to play
Come to my house, put your clothes away
There's no commitment, you don't have to stay
Just come with me, I'll set you free

[Chorus]

[Interlude: LL Cool J]
WHAT CAN I DO?!
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU!
WHAT CAN I DO?!
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU~! (Stop playin girl)

The more I look at you, the more I get
Hypnotized, my nature rise
Before your eyes, I know you're sick
Of all the lies and alibis
From other guys, when I'm watchin you
I get energized, I realize
We need surprise, variety
Is the spice of life, so I eat you up
Like apple pie, I like your flow
You're the star, this is your show
Speed it up, take it slow
Push it out, take it low
That helps a love like this to grow
If you're feelin me girl let me know
I know that you are respectable
But this type of healin is sexual

[Chorus] + [Interlude]
