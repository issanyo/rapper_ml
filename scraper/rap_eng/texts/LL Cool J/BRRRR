[Intro: Rick Ross]
They know I run the game there
Nobody did it like me
Lucia know I run the game
Stunna gave me the keys
Puff gave me the keys, my nigga
I want that oil money, nigga

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Self made so respect the hustle
Made a hundred million did it off the muscle
Walkin' Def Jam bitches think I'm russell
Pull up on you, BRRRR fuck a tussle
My whole squad be on that kill shit
My whole squad be on that real shit
Pull up on you, BRRRR, full clip
My whole squad be on that kill shit

[Verse 1: Wale]
Hey, royal blood, royal blood
Niggas show you pistols before they could show you love
Miss me with that dissin' that issue can get resolved
Double M that been my clique and Ambition ain't just a song
Live from the SLS, give them bitches new life and then I fuck 'em to death
Not jail this ain't a test, every move's a precise and I'm writin' finesse
Mad at everyone one of you, be a hunnid or nothin'
You niggas suck with the syllables, I'm the one with that number two
Rumble you, stomach shot, done with you, not right now
Some of you niggas [?] but don't let the hungry ones humble you

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Self made so respect the hustle
Made a hundred million did it off the muscle
Walkin' Def Jam bitches think I'm russell
Pull up on you, BRRRR fuck a tussle
My whole squad be on that kill shit
My whole squad be on that real shit
Pull up on you, BRRRR, full clip
My whole squad be on that kill shit

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
It's no secrets that you niggas look like police
A couple figures for every killer, my home streets
Plane landed in Miami I'm the youngest brother
A fat, ugly motherfucker smokin' burnin' rubber
Police see us they say they need us, but can't touch us
They want to be us it's clear to see, it need no discussion
I'm pill poppin', I'm askin' Ricky which one you fuckin'?
My plane comin' so show me somethin', I'm fuckin' rushin'
A couple killers say they the realest they really wasn't
Im from the city [?] baby we really pumpin'
Wayne Perry them bodies droppin' we really dumpin'
Never runnin' that money countin' gon' keep us comin'

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Self made so respect the hustle
Made a hundred million did it off the muscle
Walkin' Def Jam bitches think I'm russell
Pull up on you, BRRRR fuck a tussle
My whole squad be on that kill shit
My whole squad be on that real shit
Pull up on you, BRRRR, full clip
My whole squad be on that kill shit
