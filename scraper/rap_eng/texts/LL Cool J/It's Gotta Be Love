[Intro]
Gotta be love
Gotta be love
Gotta be love

[Verse 1]
Staring out my window pane
Waiting for the phone to ring
All I want is just to see you again
Oooh baby I miss you so
So much that I can't sleep
So much that I can't breathe
My heart it skips a beat
When I think of you and me

[Chorus]
It's gotta be love
Something about you boy (It's gotta be love)
You bring me so much joy (It's gotta be love)
I can't wait no more
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everything you wanna do
And when you're next to me (It's gotta be love)
Feels like a fantasy (It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe (It's like I died and gone to heaven)

[Verse 2]
Feels like I wasn't living before I met you
Don't think that I can go a day without you
I spend my days planning to be around you
(Nobody else, there's only you)
No doubt this must be love
You're all I'm thinking of
It's taking over me
So what else could this be?

[Chorus:]
It's gotta be love
Something about you boy (It's gotta be love)
You bring me so much joy (It's gotta be love)
I can't wait no more
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everything you wanna do
And when you're next to me (It's gotta be love)
Feels like a fantasy (It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe (It's like I died and gone to heaven)

[Bridge]
Always keep your picture in my bag
Always looking at that photograph
It's crazy
I don't usually act like that
Guess I must be in love
Sometimes I wanna call when I know you're not home
Just to hear your voice and your sexy little tone
What you do to me boy
You don't even know
It's gotta be (it's gotta be, it's gotta be)

[Chorus x2]
It's gotta be love
Something about you boy (It's gotta be love)
You bring me so much joy (It's gotta be love)
I can't wait no more
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everything you wanna do
And when you're next to me (It's gotta be love)
Feels like a fantasy (It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe (It's like I died and gone to heaven)
