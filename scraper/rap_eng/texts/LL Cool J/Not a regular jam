[Hook]

Dont you call, this a regular jam
Im gone to rock this land
Im gone to take this itty bitty world by storm
And im just getting warm

[Verse 1: Gripz]

This, woooo, not a regular jam a perpetual plan
They demand i put the weapon in hand i ablouge
You a facade, you diss i regard, so listen to god
As they applaud, victims and all
Studied the gods, jigga and nas, em, banks, 50, tech ninna, biggie and pac, come on
Speed racer, meet the beat slayer
You rolling round with some light bars, thats weak data
Please player, prepare for defeat neighbor
Im praying you leap hater, three eight make you sleep trader
You done stepped in a pile of shit
Your mileage with this rhyming shit is moderate
Equivalent what a doller get
Full time scholarship
My accomplishments meet the level of god and shit
Obvious im a novelist prevalence to your consciousness
Ain't no stopping this, lava bricks what im hotter then
Wizardry with my pen im condemned as a harry potter fan
You dont want it fam, trust me you dont want it fam
Im riding round with that street sweeper
Guzzle gas light a match nigga eat ether
Listen to the bass go
Real rap, multi schemes delivery where your skills at?
Im a creature with features that of a poltergeist
That scolding light shining up on that mic as i get my vocals rite
Now its time to educate them, lyrics hitting harder then thunder god, raiden
They delaying the mortuary they staying
The pavement over they body yes he'll fire, satan

[Hook] x2

Dont you call, this a regular jam
Im gone to rock this land
Im gone to take this itty bitty world by storm
And im just gettin warm

[Verse 2: Gripz]

Look, a lack of inspiration haulting my progress
Its hard to get inspired hearing this nonsense
I turn the radio on, i hear a radio song
And contemplate sending that station a couple bomb threats
No presence, autotune and some filters
Swallow glass eat a brick, that ain't real shit
I gives a fuck about your team, that cal. Rip kin
Silencer sound like a computer mouse is clicking
Listen to the bass go
While your daughter house sitting
Kill the pets, frogs, birds and drowned the house kitten
Not your average human being used to seeing
A demon screaming inside of my inner thoughts as im bleeding
Mentaly yall ain't ready b, im entity sent from heavens serenity to kill every whack rapper breathing
It ain't no regular jam if my voice on it
Its a journey through a intellectual psychopaths, thoughts

[Hook] x2

Dont you call, this a regular jam
Im gone to rock this land
Im gone to take this itty bitty world by storm
And im just getting warm
