[Intro: LL Cool J]
I love you too baby
I really do

[Hook: Mickey Shiloh]
I'm a tell you a lil secret
Do you think you could keep it?
Keep it between these sheets
Keep it between these sheets aha
Baby, no need to ask questions
'Cause you already know the answer
Keep it between these sheets
These sheets, these sheets
Ah ah yea

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
I won't tell nobody baby, you can trust me
You swearin that it's good, I'm thinkin it must be
I'm kissin on your thighs, relax, don't rush me
Let me take my time, make your pretty face ugly
Hands by your side, stop tryin to touch me
Let me soak it in, breathe, you smellin lovely
Kiss yo belly button, and fill it with bubbly
Take a taste, let it drip down your waste
Have it all over my face, outer body experience like you're floating out of space
Come back down gently
Grind your hips on me, you set with the melody
And let the words that I say live on in your memory

[Hook: Mickey Shiloh]
I'm a tell you a lil secret
Do you think you could keep it?
Keep it between these sheets
Keep it between these sheets aha
Baby, no need to ask questions
'Cause you already know the answer
Keep it between these sheets
These sheets, these sheets
Ah ah yea

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Eye contact, kiss me, I kiss back
Right there, I miss that, I can't resist that
And I'll be climbing up over walls and ignoring all of my calls
Stuff all the things, pause, 'cause you're giving me your all
But I never had a lover make me feel this real
Hold it up in the room, all night, all day
All week I'm strung out like a freak
Got me tapping on my arm for a fix
In-between your sheets
Work you out to this beat, it's just you and me in the suite
My tongue is all on your feet, sheets covering me
I'm kissing all that I see, exactly how it should be
