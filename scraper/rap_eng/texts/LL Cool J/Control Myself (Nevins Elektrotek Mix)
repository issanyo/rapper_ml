[Intro: LL Cool J, Jermaine Dupri & Jennifer Lopez]
The strobelights are flashing
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
I need everybody to report to the dance floor right now
No me puedo controlar
Aqui con el Se√±or LL Cool J
Y aqui estoy... ya tu sabes
Uno, dos, tres, muevete!
Y'all know what this is...So...So...Def!
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
The strobelights are flashing

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The club was far from empty (Uh)
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning (Uh)
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined (Uh-huh!)
My brain began to sizzle (Come on)
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself (Haha)
It's hard to control myself (Come on)
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 2: LL Cool J with Jennifer Lopez]
Temptation is a mother (Uh-huh)
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers (Uh-huh)
The air is full of passion (Haha)
The strobe lights are flashin' (Yeah)
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin' (Uh)
Her moves were so erotic (Come on)
Her gaze was so hypnotic (Come on)
I begged this girl to stop it (Ha)
But she continued to pop it (Woo!)
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick (Yeah)
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me, you're invited
She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself (Haha)
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Say what?)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jermaine Dupri]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss (Oh)
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth (Uh-huh)
Side, to side, and up, and down (Hey, haha)
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire (Uh-huh)
Lord help me douse this fire (Uh-huh)
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo (Come on)
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it, don't make me hurt you
She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Say what)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya (Uh-huh)
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna
