(Verse 1 Typ iLL)
Finished the Final Chapter, Beginning another novel
King Arthur, King of the castle take on another title
Sword in the stone with my poems, only I condone
Medieval took its toll, lost souls, cross roads
The dark ages await us again, Spark Gauges, my rages within
Mark pages, say its safe predict
History repeats itself, I'm beyond that
Another level, I'm a rebel, clutching metal contact
I've seen it all before, Crews year long strong, Vanished and gone
I've managed to bandage my wounds and maintain form
My closest homeys are frozen homeys that's stuck in time
Running from whats right, plus they lost they're fucking mind
So i am...
Given a choice, ride with 'em, side with 'em
Love 'em but keep it moving 'cause i can't survive with 'em (uh)
I'm a simple man, but I'm only me
T-Y-P, Soldier M C

(Hook)
Just Me...
(yea yea yea)
Just Me
(yea yea yea)
Just Me
(yea yea yea)
Just Me (Just me just me)
Yo,  I see you mother fuckers eyeing me
The Fuck is you trying me for?
The last of a dying breed, hoe

(Nature Verse 2)
We're in a Kings robe, I sit on a King throne
I'm moving how Kings rule, i follow the street code
Drinking out the bottle, tomorrow may never happen
So today, map it right then proceed rapping
Players gone' play, no coaching or team captain
Watch what you say on the jack, police tapping
Eves drop, knees drop, damn them bitches backwards
Selective with my friends, everyday I be subtracting
In other words, I'm erasing you
Like the military killing occupational
In my dreams I see the the same things I see on screens
Just a Kingpin, I started off with 3 OZ's
And my P O V is self, Me come first, I help
Nobody else but me, fuck who else agree
My people Gotta feel the same way
Nothing new nigga, do the same shit everyday, this is..

(Hook)

(Typ iLL Verse 3)
Same story, different setting different place
Different landscape, handshakes all the same
So I size a fucker up, whether I act on it or not
I'm tough, did my dirt on the side now
Typ's a nice guy, I pray a man don't ever find out
What I've been holding back, hold a gat
Box cutter in my black, leather jacket
Smiling at a couple shorties then i break eye contact
No time to expose myself
They can trust me or not
I'm confident I know myself
I can't be 2 guys at once, I can't clone myself
But i know a couple wanna be clones
Funny style Fucking followers and wanna be drones
Fucking comedy. Enter my commodity zone
Halloweens gone', and they still got their mask on
Get my back hand on
Wax off, wax on. Get my grown man on with slacks on
Gripping that black chrome, what i stand for????

(Hook)
