[Verse 1]
[Carl Thomas]
I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes, I didn't see all the things
I used to see, what's going on?

[Faith Evans]
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases, no more, no more
(Never imagined...)

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (so emotional)

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were warm
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching
From the door so hurt, there you were
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases no more, no more

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be
A faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional

[Bridge: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
You had your chance (had your chance)
But you threw it all away (yes, you did)
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness (unhappiness)

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official, I'm emotional)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
(no more baby, baby, please)
I'm emotional (you threw it all away)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
(just a faded picture, faded picture) (gotta leave you, baby)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (baby, could you hear me, oh)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official, I'm emotional)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (never imagined, oh)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional

[Outro: Carl Thomas]
Yes, I'm looking at the front door, baby, whoa
So, so, so very emotional
Baby, I'm emotional
