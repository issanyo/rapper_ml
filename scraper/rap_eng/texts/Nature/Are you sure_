Weird kid
Back of the class
Headphones in and the music on blast
Studying shit that I will never pass
Too fucking slow and the teacher too fast

Chillin' at home and I lay in my bed
Writing down thoughts as they go thru my head
I never cared about what people said
I'm tryna live I don't talk to the dead

Tell me to leave and I'll go
I don't need you to add on to my low
Cut off your weeds or you will never grow
You gotta break in the dark before you glow

I'm fallin' down I get back up
I fall again never enoguh
Life is a bitch gotta get tough
Don't ever hope that shit a bluff

Fuck approval
You ain't useful
Ima get to starting my removal
I'm the new cool
Fuckin' crucial
The way I'm cutting off it is brutal
