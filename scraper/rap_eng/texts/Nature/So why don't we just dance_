I get many dreams of you and I
Never forget how we danced the night
Babe I can see you in the lights
Take me higher than the clouds
Know that we are just right!
I got a feeling that the nights not over
You got me luckier than a four leaf clover
I know that you're the one that I need
And I'm the one for you can't you see

Ca you feel my heart?
Can you feel it beating?
I know it's the start of all these weird feelings
Can you take a chance?
So why don't we just dance the night away

Take my hand, I'll teach ya to dance
Who cares who's watching
They all got their own plans, babe
Don't be shy, i'm right by your side
We can dance all night till we see the sunlight yeah

Take me higher than the moon
Take me higher than the stars
Got me spinning round and round
But we'll never fall apart
But we'll never fall apart

Take me higher than the moon, take me higher than
I get many dreams of you and I
Never forget how we danced the night
Babe I can see you in the lights
Take me higher than the clouds
Know that we are just right
I got a feeling that the nights not over
You got me luckier than a four leaf clover
I know that you're the one that I need
And I'm the one for you can't you see
Got me spinning round and round
But we'll never fall apart
But we'll never fall apart
