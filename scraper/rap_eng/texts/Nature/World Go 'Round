[verse 1: nature]
My nigga i don't even feel right rhyming to this
You can find me on the hill when the violence exist dogg
All we ever think about is pussy and cash
On the streets hustlin' i turn cookies to cash
Break em off n sell em
There's times i give em away
And if the block gets too hot
I gotta send them away
They'll be back guaranteed
10 minutes it takes
And if they don't
The next time, bet i'll spit in they face dogg
They don't want no problem with us
When you catch us in the club
There's a thousand of us
Mix and mingle with the thugs
Them ol sourest nuts
But not me, i stay fresh
That's why shorties say yes
Shop at prada or payless
Rock the same guess
5 days a week
Switchin' shirts like shit could work
Go outside
Straight into the devil's domain
Nowadays all they want is cocaine
But we got that
[hook: nature] 2x
Pussy make the world go round (pussy make the world go round)
Money make the world go round (money make the world go round)
Guns make the thugs go down (guns make the thugs)
Slow down (slow down)
Slow down (slow down)
[verse 2: nature]
Ayo i'm the type a nigga that your mother would love
Cause when i come into her crib i give her hundreds of hugs
And even tho i call her ma, you know niggas is foul
I'm comin' back to her door later, kickin it down - why?
Her son owes money, and he's a known crook
It may hurt to see me shoot him, so ma don't look
And on the strength of you, i just might aim for the knee
Get some head for collateral, embarass you
Windows be shatter proof, every car that i'm in
I got a paid lawyer and a case hard to defend
Ayo i used to have the hot hand - i got it again
Queensbridge niggas started the trend
Nigga what what
[hook: nature] 2x
Pussy make the world go round (pussy make the world go round)
Money make the world go round (money make the world go round)
Guns make the thugs go down (guns make the thugs)
Slow down (slow down)
Slow down (slow down)
