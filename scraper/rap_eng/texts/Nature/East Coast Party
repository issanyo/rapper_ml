(hook)
It  ain't no party like a east coast party cuz a east coast party don’t stop
Repeat 4xs
(Verse)
Ayo rolling up a blunt as I listen to my instincts
The music bump till a nigga start to lip sync
Words get to forming until I get a song in
Got em going crazy for latest installment
Line around the block like they dropping new jordans
Since its new York ima keep it blue and orange
Blue yankee fitted even skullys and fidoras
Waking every morning to shorties that be gorgeous
New ? time piece, no its not a replica no its not a duplicate
Got me doing stupid shit
Everywhere I go in every hood I get a head nod
Real motherfuckers on the corner drinking egg nog
Mixed with some hennesy mixed with some mouth wash
9 oclock in the morning funnier than south park
Or that martin episode when he got dropped
By Tommy Hearnes gotta live and you learn
(Hook)
(Verse 2)
Ayo I brung this together like a young chris webber
If I just keep working and the buzz keep spreading I can be rich forever
But what ever that means
Go and get your fix homie, cocaine or caffeine
Back up on the rap scene But I never left though
You can call me oldschool, you can call me retro
You can call me ten o o a m
If its ‘bout money and I don’t pick up, call again
Im a gentleman, motherfucking gremelin
Motherfucking killer like my last name was Zimmerman
Get away scot free get away top speed
In the 911 carera on the L.I.E
On my way to Josh crib, something like a mosh pit
Or maybe to Vics spot gotta make a pit stop
Gotta get ditches and my charger and my ziplock
If im gonna make some motherfucking real hip hop
(HooK)
