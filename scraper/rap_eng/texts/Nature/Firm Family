[Intro]
A tale of two cities
Right here

[Verse 1: Nature]
It's time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way
Predictin' platinum in less then a day
So, for that we toast, amongst us while y'all lackin' hope
All I do is write raps, stack, relax and smoke
Seein' my dreams come true stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politickin' with the wisest brothers
It's Nature one of the greatest, peep how I play this
Straight from the Bridge, one of your kids' favorites
From now 'till the day that I'm stiff
Fowl flagerant pay the rent, always stay swift
Stuck in my ways, type shovanistic
Since a youth, I had a thing for big Coups
Flooded rings and older bitches
Holdin' my riches in lump sums for trust funds
Fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns
While niggas get drunk, beat wives and cuss sons
A slow process called life, let's show progress

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Don Cortes, white rags cherry Bentley
Cop shines from Italy, speak money language fluently
Never fuck with the nastiest, flashiest
Bought a house as big as Scarface to show my happiness
Rackin' the 6-0's, for those that want to get personal to home
Cock the heavy metal, rollin' with my stones
Prominent with flashy garments, spread a mill'
Small bills bring a smile to an ice grill
Popular, loved throughout the industry
If they sue, light a Philly 'cause the judge has gotta Free Willy
Salute with chill Remy, gently escort four ladies an arm
The 3 Caesars at the club, Pentleys condo suites, I'm fancy
20 floors up, overlookin' ladies, boomerang they panties
Bump the Firm Family's latest, takin' trips to Las Dregas
That's how we do it, Aftermath Incorporated

[Hook]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
It's the motherfuckin' Firm Family, oooooh, yeah
I better pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreamin', oooohh
'Cause the way you make me feel I feel like, oooooh, screamin'

[Verse 3: Nature]
I spit rhymes for the radio and spit for tours
Spend doe that I never thought I'd hold before
Now, if you just wanna front, you know my style's tight
Niggas never should of plugged up the motherfuckin' mic
Sippin' Tanqueray, 60 inch screen when we hang with Dre
I just flew in from Queens, no bag and plan to stay
In the heat, park this Rolls Royce on Venice Beach
Seein' topless bitches rollerbladin' in the street

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
While I lounge in a Jacuzzi, sky cliff blue, got the whole crew
Nas, AZ, Nature, Foxy there too
How we do? Hit trees, Cristal bottles
Breeze tropical, spread love till we wobble
It's time to give, let the kids live comfortable
Anybody pumpin' beef between the East and West? Fuck you!
Make moves political, hit this revenue
Set examples, respect every individual

[Hook]
