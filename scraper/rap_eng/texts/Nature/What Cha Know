Yeah, gotta give 'em what they want
Yeah, make it hurt, make it hurt (Nature)
Gotta give 'em what they want
Uh huh, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Now who the one that got it locked down
The top down
In the coupe or the yacht now
Just watch out
I'm comin' thru for the block now (Heard it's on)
Niggas front, they gettin' knocked out (Word is bond)
When you pump, you gotta work til the bird is gone
I love a low, but your ho in a dirty thong
Cuz I'm a crazy nigga (and)
Keep it gravy nigga (and)
She wanna fuck with me, but need a babysitter, listen up
I drive home, switchin' lanes, still twistin' up
In the club getcha witcha one, c'mon getcha cup
I feel the hate on my back when it's inchin' up
I got the eight on my back so I wish 'em luck
And it don't matter if you're black or white, hermaphrodite
Slip, it's a rap tonite
I give it all for the cause, for the sacrifice
For my dogs cuz we after life
Make noise

[Chorus]
Make noise in the streets
For the fellas and freaks
In the club with the thugs
Inhalin' the weed
When you see somethin' nice
And you ready to leave
Tell me what you know about (What you know about this)
Everyday we be ready to play
Callin' shorty to the crib
She be ready to stay
I'm a pimp by blood
Makin' all of 'em pay
Tell me what you know about (What you know about this)

[Verse 2]
The first CL5 with four doors
And it's on, the female's eyes is like dog
It even got a fridge and a toaster in it
Like every time I'm in the hood
I be approached in it
No surprise to the hood
When my soldiers in it
Every nigga on my team is a co-defendant
I be, team captain, call me the coach (Nature)
If things happen, call me the loc
And I'll be right there
Like the black knight, minus the jokes (Get a feelin')
Y'all invited to smoke
What's the dealy with the ladies that be doin' it right, like
Fuck a car, comin' through on a bike, like
Snowflakes, no two is alike, right
It's OK, we can do it tonite
And if you can't do it good then it won't be done
The one and only, the only one
Now make noise

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Drinks in the air, bottles on us
Niggas ain't partyin', probably on dust
Bitches knock it off, somebody gon' touch
Tellin' all ya friends we party all rough
We Queensbridge niggas don't like to dance (Do we)
Comin' out the club, fightin' for cabs (Do we)
Fight the bouncers, light the hash and ???
Stay away, if ya face look like the cooties
Otherwise you can tell me ya name and image
Where you be, where you work and explain the business
What ya check say, roastin' it
Black jack be the game, betta know what to bet
When I reach for the thang, betta know when to jet
Got a decent little team, you ain't notice it yet?
You never know when you're chasin' the dough, chasin' the hoes
Laid back nigga full of gangsta soul

[Chorus]
All day everyday
In the streets and the clubs
Wild Gremlinz
Nuthin' but gangstas (What you know about this)
Hustlas, pimps, hoes
Smell me, ya understand
Fa sheezy
