[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I ever go broke, I'ma kick in your door, waving the four
Screaming "Get the fuck on the floor, and gimme the raw!"
Listen, killing rap niggas wasn't part of the plan
It's the way these niggas talk man, they forcing my hand
I'm the same over beats, as I am on the streets
If I have to, I'll kill a motherfucker to eat
I got gats, clips, chips, whips
Bricks to flip, and a flow that's sick
My rhyming time is precise like I'm doing the heist, I'm nice
Get out of line and you'll get sacrificed like Christ
Look at these fake playa niggas fronting like they macking
Drop the "m" off of macking, then you have it they acting
In Queens we got lil' niggas running around packing
Not little guns, this shit is bigger than Pun
Let me find out you thinking about thumping with me
The pussy club on your nine won't rump with me

[Verse 2: Nature]
Now that Martin Luther King know his time was short, being pro-black
Turn the other cheek, nigga hold that
It's gain my niggas respect, it's V-I-O-
L-E-N-C-E is what I be when I see my foes
It's automatic, anytime, anywhere, grizzly bears
Shots going off, kids get scared
I go from Queensbridge to park slow. Across the world
Leaving trails of hoes that got they heart broke
I puff the dark smoke, usually, mix it with greens, look what it do to me:
Have me fucked up before puberty
If I had one wish and the shit'll come true
A nigga live to be a hundred and two
All I need is a two-pay, call it a new day
Immigrant prostitutes like "papa how much you pay?"
Got to lose weight, niggas say I'm way too big
Bad habits, call a shop, and stay way too jigg, motherfucker
