Do you see what I see...do you smoke what I smoke....

Verse 1:
When I walk up in a room niggas feel a slight breeze
Stay a little while 'till they feel they might freeze
Never understood why they never liked me
'cause when I lock the door they turn into iceys
Starin' at my feet all you see is Nikes
Bet you never seen a ill pair like these
Size Ten, never find me in a tight squeeze
At the airport minutes before my flight leaves
Round trip tickets to who knows where
Stay boardin' with never atleast a day's warning
Previous plans, they spoilin'
A dollar and a dream, the theme of NewYork state drawings
Rep from Saint Johns to Wake Forest
Wait for us, straight ballers
You're hearin' it first, Nate flawless
In almost every event puttin' up points
While niggas like you stay scoreless

Chorus 2x - (Nas and Nature)
All my niggas from the Projects light one up
To my bitches from the Projects light one up
And stay high....high...
And pass me a cup of that good shit
We on some hood shit

Verse 2:
It's like hoppin' in a glass pool half full
Niggas only hit the bottom when they crash through
Mash fools out like they fast food
Bone appetite
Whether Platinum or not it ain't no match for me
I sum niggas whole careers up
Scared tough niggas, bluff niggas into thinkin' that their years up
It ain't a game, I took since months off
Then shit jumps off
Mini me's are gettin' punched in they jaw
Some call this shit animal rap, me? I call it dumbin'
My nearsighted niggas saw it comin'
More stunnin', brand new flows to toy wit'
Neck flooded on some hurricane Floyd shit
Back and forth to Saint Croix kid, same plan
Playin' Sega Dreamcast to the plain lands, a changed Man
Niggas don't know, they never will
And if they don't understand then they ain't fam
Simple as that...

Chorus 4x
