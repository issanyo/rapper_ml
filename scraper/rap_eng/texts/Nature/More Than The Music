[Verse One: Heather B]
Must be the music that's turning me on
Don't wanna feel no more pain or hear another sad song
I'm sick of days where everything goes wrong
See I done hit rock bottom and life still goes on
Somewhere out there over the rainbow over the moon
There's a pot of gold and a silver spoon
I'm gonna eat soon
I'm all woman, may God bless my womb
To be fruitful and beautiful, opponents make room
The game is game but I will rise like the phoenix
And get to serving some of y'all like Serena
Like Venus
I've been misled and mistreated
I've overreacted, became heated, I blame the world and it's teachers
I pointed fingers and made a wishlist
Felt like the Grinch That Stole Christmas
And wished [?] on craft bitches in my mist
So as the [?] I feel it's on now
Here's where I belong now

[Hook: Heather B] {x2}
It's more than the music (the music)
More than the melody
Never believe once what these fools try to tell me
It's more than the songs and the samples and the lyrics
I'm gonna go above and beyond any limit

[Verse Two: Heather B]
Sticks and stones never broke my bones
But some of these critics tried to hurt me
What you gon' say now when I make the Power 30?
And live like everyday's my birthday
"Oh she must have a ghostwriter"
Nothing left to do but smile
I'm too experienced
I could battle for play play using my inner child on some of y'all
Running circles around your many styles
Leaping over MC's waving white towels in a single bow
Look up in sky
Heather B be the movement
Don't make me get rowdy and ruthless
Over something stupid
It's more than simple
I warn you, I can get on you and in you
And cleanse you and clean you
Ms. Thing I read you
Getting paid in the process
Separate the news from the nonsense
The chaotic from the conscious
The mentors from the monsters
The preachers from the prophets
The hook

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Nature]
On my thirteenth birthday, my wish was
A Casio keyboard, a quick buzz
Every critic in the hood knew who the kid was
Sneaking up on y'all just like the hiccups
Check it, Marley in control days, niggas sold treys
Now it's the Flex time, kick ya best rhymes
Toe to toe, neck to neck, down to the line
Can't talk about the best without mentioning mine
Cause I'm everything you wanted to be but just couldn't
Everything you wanted to see but just wouldn't
Everything you imitate and try to mimic
You need to stop trying to be me, go find a gimmick
Don't try to limit, multi-[?]
When I honk the horn I got no time for bitches
Rather make money than be chewing the fat
With you, with ch'all and them dudes in the back
Like a breath of fresh air set to move to the track
You better change you D I'm the new running back
A lot of y'all is porn stars, niggas going hard
Knock niggas off guard on verbal assault charge

[Hook]
