[Pre-Chorus]
I said you kids best show respect, said no one done it like we done (like we)
Came out the Hole and got the whole world showin' love, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, we workin' over here (you know!)
So whyn't you work it over here? (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Feelin' so tall
Measure me up 'cause my back's to the wall (to the wall, wall, wall)
This shit is happy, I'm buildin' but I know they pray for the fall
(Feelin' so) feelin' so tall
(Feelin' so) feelin' so tall
Livin' a life that you don't understand and you couldn't at all

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' tall, tall, tall (tall)
Know they wanna see me fall, fall, fall (you know)
But we ain't really stressin' over here
My perception's twenty stories from up here
I'm feelin' tall, tall, tall (tall)
Know they wanna see me fall, fall, fall (you know)
But we ain't really stressin' over here
My perception's twenty stories from up here (okay)

[Verse 1]
Let the beat drop out, you would cop out
Get you knocked out, yeah, man's sayin', "Lights out"
Hatin' on a kid comin' up all nice
Not one tape, two tapeâ€”two more; strike's out!
You don't wanna run that bass? Like, hit the track!
You don't wanna run that race?
Couldn't run that pace? Like, bring it back!
Can't say it to my face? Like
This is my vent
My place to forget that's forever and always
Built a home of emotion I've coast in alone and confine in the hallways
And only did those who do visit should know that I love them in all ways
For now I stay post twenty stories, that most don't, which I remain always
That's a fast flow
For those who don't know
Sorry, feel I gotta coach hoes
Mainstream full of bad acts, spread the boatloads
All 'cause y'all 'bouta write these [?] with your parents' cards in your motherfuckin' cell phones
Motherfuckin' hell no
Not my team, they into that real though
Call the track fire, they talkin' the real smoke
Call they raps lies, they talkin' the real broke
Hooks crack with the flow, I would kill for a fans
White kids goin' broke, payin' the meal for
They say truth with a voice fined to rise above all
I guess that's a reason I'm feelin' so tall

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' tall, tall, tall (tall)
Know they wanna see me fall, fall, fall (you know)
But we ain't really stressin' over here
My perception's twenty stories from up here
I'm feelin' tall, tall, tall (tall)
Know they wanna see me fall, fall, fall (you know)
But we ain't really stressin' over here
My perception's twenty stories from up here (okay)

[Verse 2]
Couldn't get to my height
Not with the ladder or rope or a light
No one know what it's like
Tryna take off while life keep delayin' my flight
Rode that internet wave
Man, you don't know what the internet saved
Gave me somethin' to vent through
Fans understood while they said "I don't get you"
Now I'm out of they face
Country to country, they reppin' the A's
Man, look what we made
Word to my fans, I am what you create
Twenty stories and buildin'
Still a long way to the top
But look what we already got

[Pre-Chorus]
I said you kids best show respect, said no one done it like we done (like we)
Came out the Hole and got the whole world showin' love, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, we workin' over here (you know!)
So whyn't you work it over here? (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Feelin' so tall
Measure me up 'cause my back's to the wall (to the wall, wall, wall)
This shit is happy, I'm buildin' but I know they pray for the fall
(Feelin' so) feelin' so tall
(Feelin' so) feelin' so tall
Livin' a life that you don't understand and you couldn't at all

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' tall, tall, tall (tall)
Know they wanna see me fall, fall, fall (you know)
But we ain't really stressin' over here
My perception's twenty stories from up here
I'm feelin' tall, tall, tall (tall)
Know they wanna see me fall, fall, fall (you know)
But we ain't really stressin' over here
My perception's twenty stories from up here (okay)
