[Intro]
We don't play around, we don't wait around for the cops to cruise
When they come we gon' lay 'em down

[Verse One]
I think it's going down tonight G
You think I care about them niggas that don't like me?
I got my niggas right here and they quite deep
We quick to split a nigga head to the white meat
We like beef, I ain't playing, I don't tell lies
Never learn, made the same mistake twelve times
My head is hurting, go to court play the bail fine
Getting paid, this and that doing real crime
I get away
Too smart to get arrested
A new charge for the niggas they want to question
A new trick for the bitches that want to test it
A new bitch for the bitches that want to exit
Yo let's [?]
Yo I'm a big dog 22's
I never walk
If I catch you wearing funny shoes
I tear it off
If I catch you with a funny dude
I scare 'em off
Killa hit me with that weed again
It's wearing off

[Hook]
Take that
We don't play around, we don't wait around for the cops to cruise
When they come we gon' lay 'em down
Take that
We don't wanna talk we don't wanna joke when it's on
You see us running through the clouds of smoke
Take that
Any avenue, any afternoon
Hammers ring, never thought it could happen to you
Take that
Anyone you with, anyone you get
When you caught off guard, niggas laughing at you

[Verse Two]
I got a face niggas recognize
And a gun just in case niggas jeopardize
I ain't the one though
My dogs living separate lives
We still a team and the plan is to terrorize
In Killer Queens niggas know me as Nate
They know me as Dunn, they know me to fight
They know you to hide they know you to run
According to some your gun game is suspect
Follow in my footsteps young nigga, what's next?
Gather up enough heart before you throw in a punch
But at first, you better know when to punch
You better know when to bob and weave
Young niggas calm to leave
Put my hands around your throat make it harder to breathe
In a scuffle my legs gave, dunn forced me to fall
Like a slave in the dirt we was caught in a brawl
I had the eight on my waist, dunn forced me to draw
And like that we wasn't fighting no more
Take that

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I watched part of 'em die, watched part of 'em leave
But still, part of 'em live, still part of 'em breathes
Through the tube, I bet his whole meal comes in a jar
Got a close friend killed though he wasn't involved
Close my eyes when I run through the fog
Run through the wind like God
Influence those that just want me to sin but it's hard
At times I gotta change the whole score summary
No matter if it's next door or one floor under me
When niggas gotta get it they get it
Nobody's with it, I'm with it
Put the mask on, get my blast on
Local beef never lasts long
Fizzling quick, they probably realized we mad strong
Niggas is sick
Illegal screen that considered a pick
Before I pick and I roll
Pull out the gun, aim, click and I blow
Spitting shit quick to get in your soul
A different flow for now, I put it down so that niggas could know

[Hook]
