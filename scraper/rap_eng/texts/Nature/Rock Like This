When I rock like this
Rappers start to panic, Changing up the flows everybody gets doe
When I rock like this
Radio ready got the city moving with me everyday heavy
When I rock like this
Everybody love it, Money in my pocket and my face in the public
When I rock like this
Strictly for the street, Guaranteed you'll put it on repeat
(Verse 1)
Ayo the moon be in crescent my mood be aggressive
My music is money my music be impressive
They say that i'm talking the murder one two excessive
And if it ain't that then it's crack and how to stretch it
To the fiends that be fiending, the fees in agreement
The shit that i be pushing feed the needs of a demon
The shit that I say attract niggas like cleavage
Quarterbacks looking for some new wide recievers
I’m too fly for demons I’m too high for Jesus
Maybach money but I saved to get a prius
Married to marijuana smile when you see us
Gun on my lap looking like we hunt Deers
Facing all my fears with cognac and beers
Clue freestyle sparked a whole rap career
Now i'm right here in the front now
Shooters on deck whos next to get gunned down (Bloaw!)

(When I rock like this) I got the eye of the tiger
The buyers they get excited when the fire’s ignited
Or they dying from anxiety quietly hating
Uninspired almost forget how much vagina be waiting
When you rock like this everybody notice
On the mic been nice since telephones and rotters
Ripping down shows and telling all the promotors
Only 21 and over gettin money like a Jonas
I make the record stores wanna lift the gates up
And make these little niggas run and get a pay stub
Stay away from facebook keep a 38 snub
Bitches wanna make love to me on the wake up
Never slipping unless i was mopping
Niggas never see it coming even if i see them watching
You will never understand  I'm a rubberband popper
Falling victim to my trap I think I gotcha
