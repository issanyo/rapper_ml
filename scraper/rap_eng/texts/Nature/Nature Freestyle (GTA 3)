[Intro]
All the way live, from the bridge
Nature, Big Stretch, this is what we do, KO

Ey yo, 60 inch screen
Dvd, nekkid on the couch, with 2 (hoes) feedin me
The rap game treated me, gave me blessings
It's better than that wack (shit) you press
And You can find me
Puffing trees in the Summer League
NBA, against the wannabees
5 on 5, Me and (Big) Stretch
And (DJ)Whookid is in the front row, iced out
Not even watching the game we know
You know the type that I holla first at,you Thirstmaster
Actin' too fly, we curse at ya
Walk on by, boo!
My sunshine turnt into clouds
I'm the reason behind shooutouts, murdering styles
In the bridge, cool out, my (niggas) wild
At award shows, I spit in the crowd
On your girlfriend wig, meet again because the world ain't big
And when we do you duck, you hurl, or play sick
Basic flows got the block flockin at me
You can know me by my government (name), but not in the street, lovin it
Every minute of it, spins is coming
And if it ain't real, then pretend to love it
Holla at you dog
