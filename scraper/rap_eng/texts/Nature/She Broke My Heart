[Intro]
In the studio, out the studio
Another hit? Another hit
Can't do it like this. Can't do it like me nigga?
Nobody can do it like me
Do it like this kid
Nature
My nigga yo
Second go round
You know me yo
The worlds greatest ..


[Nature]
I face hurtle after hurtle, leap after leap
Seen murder after murder, week after week
Same product i was pumpin some half a dirt cheap
Tryna cut my dough, some niggas is thirsty
I try to front it off like it wouldn't hurt me
Fiends walking away, like my name was Herpes
I never had a job so they never worked me
Besides how much money do a fucking clerk see Nigga
I got a brother tryna walk in my steps Nigga
Heard ya'll cowards talking under ya'll breath
Wanna talk about my album some say that it flop
I heard niggas crack jokes on the day that it drop
They hit ya, whole album nigga no samples nigga
No features, credits, no leeches
I never gave a fuck about who it reaches
Once I put it out they heat it up, my niggas need this
And those'll be the ones that'll carry the weight
They let me know when I'm carried away
Fuck the label Fuck sony's whole staff just for having me wait
Three years in advance, scaring my fans
I thought rap was supposed to be fun
Second go round, it goes down, this how it's posed to be done
Interfere in your face, i'll be pokin a gun
Never smile, you're my dawg if it close you my dun
I run game to a chicken just to make her cluck
In the projects i'm best known for taking a buck
If a nigga's too sleepy I'll be waking him up
If a bitch is too sleepy I'll be making her fuck
She could cook a little, clean a little check in the mail
Had her gased up she told me every record was real
And I never would've thought that she was your wife
You was my best friend, we was all right
