[Intro: Nas]
You ever dance with the Devil under the pale moonlight?
Desperados travelling
What the fuck's up son?
We could do this word up, we could do this

[Chorus: Nas]
Spend too many nights on the Henny getting right
Breaking big face Bennies, betting against the friendly dice
I can't call it, it's going too good to spoil it
Tell it like it is, the raw shit never recorded

[Verse 1: Canibus]
At a thousand degree Celsius I make MCs melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself
Let me explain how I maintain thresholds to pain
I walk across the Sun barefoot looking for shade
I rearrange your ribcage like a twelve gauge at close range
And change the position of your brain
My hard raps penetrate through your hardhats and all that
Nigga, get ya wig peeled back
I scalp you like the Indians on horseback
Running Bull will hit you harder than running back
Stunning man with brave and cunning raps
Swiftly running laps around 48 tracks
Like uncut crack you fiends keep coming back
Heads is flipping like acrobats on gym mats
From wax to analogue tapes to digital DATs
It's critical black, that Canibus is ill like that
In fact perhaps you should quit rap, instead of always tryna diss back
If niggas keep telling you that your shit's wack
I rip raps, hardcore raps wrestle you to the floor mat
Put you in the figure four, break your thorax
Jump off the top turnbuckle and land on your back
Till I hear it snap or crackle, the ref says chill black
You get clapped bringing the wrong raps to combat
Like bringing a paint gun to a shoot out with real gats
Y'all niggas is wack, rapping over microphone feedback
My intelligence begins where yours peaks at
From Fox Boogie in the see-through brassiere to Nasty Nas here
My nigga Nature'll explain it further if it's not clear

[Nas and Foxy Brown]
Millionaire look at the sky make sure it's still there
Ice grill stares and my jewellery is in every year
Pierre Cardin back in a Dapper Dan time
Now flex, angle wrecks, Foxy rock Anne Klein

[Nas]
Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick
Sit back and feel the ultimate hit
Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick
Sit back and feel the ultimate hit

[Verse 2: AZ]
Yo lock in, do the knowledge, follow the doctrine
We clocking, on your airwaves, keeping it rocking
Blaze up, make fire, light your Purple Haze up
Betcha tired, bitch ass niggas need to be caged up
So raise up fuck the playing, I'm sick of laying
I can picture spraying off an SK, shells ricocheting
Snatched up, in Supreme Court, eyes half shut
Co-defendant caught a life sentence, see him crack up
React what, who will, bail two mill'
Nigga cool still bet I'll be home before the news will
Blast fuse and leave purple Frank Matthews
Perhaps you confuse the concept black, cash rules
Incog another HAMO- Dâ€™s involved
Known freeze condo seize seven keys dissolved
Daily routine, speaking up for niggas who sling
Hand to hand on them street corners claiming you king
It's time to lock this, join with us, let your Glock spit
Guzzle the toxic, only fake niggas dry snitch
Get your guns out, it don't take much for me to dumb out
Play one route, lay ya shit down and run South

[Verse 3: Nature]
Here's the cause of this shit, more statistics
Deeper than the laws of physics, Malibu sand, the gorgeous bitches
Weed from 1-2-5, my whole crew live
A true Desperado, one that never choose sides
And show sympathy, just QB, an entity
Stock exchange, top of the game, watch you mention me
Image is nothing just obey your thirst
I blaze the Purple Haze, sit in a daze then display a verse
For those concerned or just eager to learn
I speak for The Firm, when zonin' keep the cheeba to burn
Stashing my riches, pass traditions like Olympics pass the torch flip shit so y'all could picture my thoughts
I'm drifting, it's type ill waking up looking like Phil
Twenty years younger same hunger same ice grill
Genetically form grade A pedigree
Born to carve rhymes, a swift tongue helped to set it free
Theoretically peep how we bless this, young and restless
Guns and westerns, learning to connect through lessons
From cool feats to camps, niggas shoot back
It's a proven fact, '97's mine, y'all niggas move back

[Hook]
