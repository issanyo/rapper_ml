[Hook]
We ain't friends.. no more..
(I guess it gotta be like this)
How'd it end?.. cold war..
(You made it like this)
We ain't close.. like we use to be..
(I thought we gon' be here forever)
(You and me, on my side, my dawg, my nephew)
We ain't friends..

[Hook]
Yo, how long did you think you could get away with it?
Did you think that the bullshit would stay hidden?
Y'all niggas fucked up, makin' me choose
Yo I use to have love for ya, now I refuse
To have anythin' other than hate
My brothers fate's in it
I wonder how the evil got up in us
You throw dirt on my name
And when you bleed then you game
When you need, then you came
Not now we ain't friends

[Verse 1]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, do the math yo, add and subtract
Every year I lose a close friend
Too many haven't came back
I seen niggas on the night of their death
I sat in on niggas baggin' up
Goin' home inspired the chef
I tried to make a 'lil money dunn, n buy it myself
Not knowin' that this drug shit required some help
I had no where to turn yo, what could I do?
When you gave me your back like "NIGGA FUCK YOU"
Now I see what I couldn't before
Your nose divin' like that Egypt air
I put y'all writin' in the Morgue
It ain't a line that y'all couldn't absorb
I makes it clear for y'all
And quickly gets up in your area
Handle y'all business, let it be known that I know
Fuck tryin' to spread a rumor, the lead's goin' through ya
You never grow too old to get your revenge
When it's on than it's on, don't talk, we ain't friends

[Hook]
Ayo, how long did you think you could get away with it?
Did you think that the bullshit would stay hidden?
Y'all niggas fucked up, by makin' me choose
Yo I use to have love for ya, now I refuse
To have anythin' other than hate
My brothers fate's in it
I wonder how the evil got up in us
You throw dirt on my name
And when you bleed then you game
When you need, then you came
Not now we ain't friends

[Verse 2]
I know niggas that's neutral n niggas that move
Quick to shoot to do your snitchin'
Stop your twitchin'
Can't sell no rocks without my permission
Knuckle heads mean alot of friction
The bullshit be none existences
So.. if you livin' a lie
That means you're welcomed dawg for a limited time
I don't care who you know
Interfere with my doe, than I come where you stay
We was cool yesterday, but.. now I'm livin' for tomorrow
A brand new me, I'll move on, never hesitate when you wrong
Catch me in the crib with one shoe on
Gettin' the mail, nuttin' but bills and coupons
Over power y'all, I'm too strong, appealin' to kids
They gon' crazy in the crib when the juice gon'
Are you stubborn as me?, is it love?, is it beef?
Do we all make amends?, if not, we ain't friends

[Hook]
Now how long did you think you could get away with it?
Did you think that the bullshit would stay hidden?
Y'all niggas fucked up, by makin' me choose
Yo I use to have love for ya, now I refuse
To have anythin' other than hate
My brothers fate's in it
I wonder how the evil got up in us
You throw dirt on my name
And when you bleed then you game
When you need, then you came
Not now we ain't friends

[Hook]
We ain't friends.. no more..
How'd it end?.. cold war..
We ain't close.. like we use to be..
We ain't friends..
