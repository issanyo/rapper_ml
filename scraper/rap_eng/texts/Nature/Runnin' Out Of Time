[Chorus]:
It's all in your mind
Hip hop's alive but it's on the decline
New York, New York niggas runnin' out of time
Whatchu gon' do nigga? How you gon' shine?
We runnin' out of time
You can see the sun till your eyes go blind
You can be the one that meet the chrome .45
You can be the one that don't die
So run and hide
You runnin' out of time

[Verse One]:
Music I make is like, somethin' to take at night
Stronger than Vicodin, music will save your life
I can't prescribe it to you, only describe it for you
It's like a bitch tryin' to squeeze money out of dudes
First time she meet him, try to beat him and bait him
I'm like a pimp that keep the key to every suite that I stay in
All the freaks that I dated ain't get their numbers deleted
It's called emergency ass, I call 'em whenever needed
Years thinkin' I could never get that swag back
Whatever you thinkin', I'm thinkin' ten steps past that
I seen what you drivin' nigga go 'head just crash that
I'd rather flip crack with heavy checks from ASCAP
My niggas will love me and some might hate me
Don't wanna cross the line young blood, don't make me
I'll hurt you up severely, I know that you hear me
Just before you got scared and your eyes was teary
You heard me say...

[Chorus]:
It's all in your mind
If hip hop's alive then it's on the decline
New York, New York niggas runnin' out of time
Whatchu gon' do nigga? How you gon' shine?
We runnin' out of time
You can see the sun till your eyes go blind
You can be the one that meet the chrome .45
You can be the one that don't die
So run and hide
You runnin' out of time

[Verse Two]:
Ayo, some of my songs get your kids suspended
I'm talkin' shootings and gangs instead of finger paintin'
Things they ain't supposed to be hearin' unless they livin' it
Project environment, playtime is limited
The father gettin' cussed out
Baby know the bus route
She only three years old, now she turnin' on the stove
While you in the back sleep, you never hear the tickin'
Little piece of paper, big fires in the kitchen
Yo we livin' that hood life
The cameras in my buildin' can prove that
We movin' like it's boot camp
Don diva shoe champ
Nike Air's every color, summertime make a color
Fake niggas come around
Growl but they ain't gorilla
More like orangutang, all bark but never bang
When we go to war niggas never show they fang
They only wanna talk about rap
When they see me like it's all about that
What's up nigga?

[Chorus]:
It's all in your mind
If hip hop's alive then it's on the decline
New York, New York niggas runnin' out of time
Whatchu gon' do nigga? How you gon' shine?
We runnin' out of time
You can see the sun till your eyes go blind
You can be the one that meet the chrome .45
You can be the one that don't die
So run and hide
You runnin' out of time

[Verse Three]:
Niggas fixin' they resumes after 30 somethin' years
Havin' kid and no Medicaid
On the streets runnin' wild like I'm down with the Blue Cross
With a blue cross, Bluetooth and a blue Porsche
Fresh pack of Newports
Best rapper, who thought?
Scoopin' up your bitch at the mall in the food court
Eatin' with the kid and she even got the stroller with the shop type
My type
Till she got to know a nigga now she wanna kiss and tell
How she used to give me head
Then she smoke a cigarette, chase it with the Ginger Ale
Puttin' on the lipstick, she headin' back out
Headed to the mall, sneaky rat tryin' to mack out
Any nigga shoppin', spot him when he pull his stack out
Don't matter if he rappin' if he got it, it could happen
Her baby daddy waitin' at the crib with the ratchet
Thinkin' she was shoppin', if he knew he would clap her
If he knew what she was after

[Chorus]:
It's all in your mind
If hip hop's alive then it's on the decline
New York, New York niggas runnin' out of time
Whatchu gon' do nigga? How you gon' shine?
We runnin' out of time
You can see the sun till your eyes go blind
You can be the one that meet the chrome .45
You can be the one that don't die
So run and hide
You runnin' out of time
