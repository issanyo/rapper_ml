[Intro: Nas]
QB, the whole NYC
We gon' bounce to this
All my niggas (yeah, yeah)
All the ladies

[Hook: Nas]
Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

[Verse 1: Nas]
Top of the world is what I'm aimin' at
These niggas is flamin' gats at my circle
I catch you, my first reaction's to hurt you; I'll hit your bird, too
Two in your scalp, then you out, your thug crew is out
Blood oozin' out, some servin' caine
Knowin' nothin' about this murder game
It's easily told but hard to hear
When niggas finally find out it's real
That's when they heart pumps fear
The real remain, the weak will disappear
My words are 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear
911 style sits on your mind like chrome
Let's say your brain's a V12, put it in drive, let it roam
What color? Might as well make it the same as your dome
You need your thoughts together means destination is unknown
As we travel on this road, an infinite path
I get into this math, drop and get intense for the cash
Will I be subject to kill? Live my life by the gat?
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back

[Hook: Nas]
Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

[Verse 2: Nature]
I know a lot of fiends by their first name, livin' in Queens
A lot of cats gettin' stuck for they chains
Holdin' dirty guns, the young old dirty ones
Runnin' wild, nigga, I raise hell above ground
Live in sin, holdin' rocks, Benjamin Grimm
Figure once I got knocked, it would end—never that
They try to tell me I don't love my own
The thugs know, they ride my zone, like The Cyclone
Trademark for Coney Isle, yeah, they know me now
I'm givin' niggas fake hugs, phony smiles
Stack profits, you know how niggas on the block get
Try to give you dap just to stare at your pockets
Crews advance, nothin' new, just the rules of the land
You couldn't tell if they wolves or lamb (Ha, word)
You could fight like a few, there's a few that ran
Or you could feed them and lose your hand
What you wanna do?

[Hook: Nas]
Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

[Verse 3: Nas]
Blessings be to the ones who left us
To transcend into spiritual essence, in Allah's arms you restin'
To Him we pray for my peeps
Louie Lloyd Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sonny back in the day
"Get that money, yam," he used to say
Not only nice with hands but street smarts, he was twice a man
I try to understand life's deep plot, I think of Weewop
Shikeisha, they both was mad nice on the rock
They woulda went pro, but only God, he only knows why not
Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers be not clean
You come around, he start snappin' on you, makin' a scene
Kept the lye, cool nigga, warm heart, and stayed fly
You still alive, I see you in your sister's face
Are you nearby or lookin' on, just from a distant place?
My thoroughbreds, Black Ed, quiet but real
Expect to see your black Jeep come fly over the hill
In the spirit of Richie Lou, tribute
Remind the world of the crime that NY pigs do, we miss you
Never forget you, Harry and Sonia
Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier
T.J. Black, better known as Killer
I can't replace you, but in me
Havoc will always have a brother, my nigga
My man Will, until we meet again
You hold it up there, I'll hold it down here
I hope y'all hear my prayers clear

[Outro: Nas]
Rest in peace to my grandfathers, Papa Charlie...
(Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?)
Rest in peace to my man's Horse pops, nam'sayin'? One love
(If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?)
Can't forget Nana, my man L.E.S. grandmom, nam'sayin'?
(All these niggas flippin' on me ‘cause I won't give no loot to 'em)
They still wit' us, though; I wonder where they at?
(Sometimes I...) How near, how far?
Sometimes I wonder (What?)
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger? (Can't go under)
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
