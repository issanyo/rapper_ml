(Hook)
Uh, you don’t wanna fuck around with me
(keep it real kid cuz you don’t know who you fucking with)
You don’t want to go a round with
(hit you with so many rights your gonna beg for a left)
Uh, hard work is what im putting in
(im far from being god but I work god damn hard)
God knows that you wouldn’t win
(Im the best and I ain't even gotta say that shit)
(Verse 1)
Selling crack while you mow the lawn
While you sit behind your desk this is going on
While you driving and adjusting on your volume
Ill be out in Hollywood doing what the stars do
Hardboiled attitude something like jon woo
Something light on my wrist moving that dog food
In the streets or any network that be social
I don’t need courage like the lion to approach you
Homicidal thoughts in my head when im smoking
Shooting up the Barclay center before it opens
Shooting up the KFC while you was eating
Rubbing coke on the babies gums while he teething
5 in the morning hustling while you be dreaming
Finding out your best friends baby moms ?beaming?
Finding out your best friends for the wrong reason
Been the best way before for all seasons, understand
(hook)
(Verse 2)
A bad bitch and some Netflix
Dirty pair of sweats we be having the best sex
Phone off the hook voicemails is death threats
Running on the tread mill doing some bench press
Working on my stomach ready for the summer
Stay away from ihop heavy on the butter
Stay away from project hallways and clutter
Hoodrat running her mouth ima cut her
Drunk I be tweeking Drunk every weekend
Partying in jersey go across the Lincoln
Bodies in the trunk getting found when they stinking
Never trust a nigga that’s talking and keep blinking
Street niggas linking Corners get cornered
Drugs get sold, smoked, shot, some snorted
You could look a fiend in his eye know when hes on it
This is for the G’s on the rise who get rewarded, understand
(Hook)
