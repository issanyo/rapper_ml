See a lot of niggas talking bout war, you understand what I'm saying, war
But now as a nigga grow, he progresses and he has a lot more happier things
To talk about (more happy), jigga kick that shit

Yo you can catch Norea
In L.A
Wit mo bitches, and I tough titties some fly ho's
Wit a pound double o's
B-12's extroidinary pushing a man wit (errrr) exquisite
Watch em lock, pivot
Move lemme get it
Straight dig in it
Penetrate till you get straight Bo Riddick
Half of ya friends said they ain't see him, and him
From A.M. (M), To P.M. (M)
I'll be chillin' wit a ho in the next B.M
Yo I dodge fast
Can't mess wit es crack-heads
Back spreads
Puerto Ricans wit dreads
Yo mamacita
I'm not virg just like the margarita
Guanamena, Guantanamena
Jose its like Juan, back at Bia-bone
Born alone, die alone
Never known to cry alone
I hold it down till Capone come home
I used to never drink, now I'm known to drink plenty
Cristal, Henny, Mo get me on the RÃ©my
Packers sent me dolo, but I order beef semi
Don't make me and my click just down many
Guinnesses
(whut) stay high like the blimpses
Nemesis, blow holes through the premises

***Chorus***
Noreaga: Gettin hed in the whip, and not crashing it
Gettin hed in the whip, and not crashing it

Nature: yo doggystyle was my favorite position, until I switched shit
Dead shit, got on some hed shit
Doggystyle was my favorite position, until I switched shit
Dead shit, got on some hed shit

Noreaga: gimme some hed
Gimme some hed
Gimme some hed
Gimme some hed

A yo I cock a cannon
Me and French canannon
Travel to the top of the Grand Canyon
We don't fuck, still instead yo our click gettin hed
Then we hit the next state
In the next bitch bed
Its all fun to us
When we in the tour bus
Pola-tickin about which bitches we fucked
Same hoochie that same bitch tha happened in Queens
Seeing lil bitches from the hood stripping in dreams
(whut) in it for once
Now toked out and smoke blunts
Then the pussy, still rock gold fronts
Turned out, no doubt
All tha sons showed her the route
Yo I did it all when I was fuckin wit the thugs
Traditional, plus a nigga pops sold drugs
Yo impeccable like the fuckin Chinese rugs
Still sexual, bone'en bitches right in the clubs
Yo inadequate
Deep just like devil's advocate
I bless that, C-N-N shirt plus a Guess hat
My whole click touched that bitch and caressed that

***Chorus***
Noreaga: Gettin hed in the whip, and not crashing it
Gettin hed in the whip, and not crashing it

Nature: yo doggystyle was my favorite position, until I switched shit
Dead shit, got on some hed shit
Doggystyle was my favorite position, until I switched shit
Dead shit, got on some hed shit

Noreaga: gimme some hed
Gimme some hed

A yo peep the verse
Cause Iraq like Strange Universe
My chest glow, from the ice left in my gold
It was war when, we used buy weed from Norven
Now we straight Bransoned out, Man shit out
Condo three floors, Benz four doors
Lookin' for your Victoria Secret in draws
Yo, I love hoes who blow dick without asking
Waking up in the morning, hed action
Yo peep it, Nore wasn't always on some freak shit
Fell in love once with this shortie on some weak shit
Things is over, I'm on like the Latola
Carani, Catch me wit the next mans lady
Drinking Don P. gettin bent crazy
Cristal is for the ones that only drink babies
Yo I love hoes in them g-strings and bow legged
So help me God, my dick get hard
See you noticed
Most hoes stay focused
Below the abdomen
Her bell on my scale when I'm stabbing it
And I bless you wit
Niggas take out yall small intestines, mad hoes get addicted
And get domestic
Mad cause I dont fuck em like I use to
Bone they ass like I used to
Cause now I'm used to, just gettin hed
Get one nut and hit the bed
Instead
You know my lah still laying spread

***Chorus*** (x2)
Noreaga: Gettin hed in the whip, and not crashing it
Gettin hed in the whip, and not crashing it

Nature: yo doggystyle was my favorite position, until I switched shit
Dead shit, got on some hed shit
Doggystyle was my favorite position, until I switched shit
Dead shit, got on some hed shit

Noreaga: gimme some hed
Gimme some hed
Gimme some hed
Gimme some hed

Yo (whut, whut) its like type crazy, crazy growing up, doin' the
Same shit I did, doin' a lil bid. Three and a half years, shit
Felt like a skid nah sayin', you know? I just went and enjoyed
My motherfucking self, throw my guns in the air
