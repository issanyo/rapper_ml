[Verse 1: Nature]
Yo.. yo.. yo
Typing my life on a Blackberry keypad
Nigga from the street
Nigga get the street feedback
Nigga pitching crack
Nigga could have won a Cy Young
So I attack 'cause the good niggas die young
I never try nigga all I do is triumph
Weed in my hand, nigga, David and Goliath
Praying to God the oil spills will dry up
While we looking for millionaires to tie up
Me and Mega so close we like twins, nigga
Reporting news like it's 1010 Wins
Around the way Big Willies going MIA
And I ain't talking about Florida, bodies decay
When I be drunk never stumbling on that pink Ros√©
Keep at least a shooter with me that won't think to aim
And when the smoke clears you get it the worst way
Rest in peace all of y'all
I'ma get the shirts made, motherfuckers

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Sometimes it seems like there's no more real niggas
So-called real niggas told on real niggas
Had shit sewn, parole-holds hem niggas
Ain't green with envy, that's state greens they still bidding
In the beast's abdomen, sleep is hazardous
When you share air with dealers, fiends and savages
Freedom is every nigga dream even when life challenges
I'd rather be here than eating three squares and circle in the yard
As a man it hurts you even more to know
Before a visit they search a nigga moms
Or thinking who's sleeping with your girl in his arms
Out of sight, out of mind, it's like the world disregards you
This is food for thought, never will I starve you
Lies mean nothing ever since I found truth
I stay clear of snakeheads with venomous thoughts
Poison your mind, resist if you're mentally strong

[Intermezzo]
If we had more unity out here man, we'd be unstopable
Like nobody, nobody in the world could fuck with us
I don't think anybody know that though

[Verse 3: Nature]
Under the seven train by the magazine store
Rikers Island bus stop, niggas get the Queens tour
Starting with the hood bulletproof the whole city up
Dirty money on the table, niggas try to Willie up
Some niggas testify, walk the streets petrified
Paranoid niggas stay smoking on them pesticides
I never lie, use gunshots to rectify
Two wrongs don't make it right, nigga, better change your life

[Verse 4: Cormega]
You know how I give it up
Replace hate with the love
Death comes to all
Might as well live it up
Every man has a purpose, I'm here to crush the mic
It's addictive, when I'm near it I feel a rush
The same faces that frown when a nigga up
Smile when a nigga down
That's what they really want
To throw salt in the wound, I'm in the cut
I lost more grams cooking up than they picking up
