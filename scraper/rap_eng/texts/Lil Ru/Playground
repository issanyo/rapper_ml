[Intro]
Yo, This is for real people real life what goes up must come down
But just hang around on the playground baby, lets ride

[Chorus]
What goes up must come down livin life on the playground
The more money we make the more it doesn't last
Livin life on the playground
You need to get up get out and get something
I Feel like I'm wastin time life on the play ground
You need to get up get out and get something
And get back to livin life on the playground

[Verse 1]
Get up in the morning no gimmics no games
I be sick sometimes but i gotta make gains
My girl be up too be at the job too
Hit the time clock after kids get to school
Natalac Lil Ru make grown music too
Adult playground you gotta pay ya way
Rent mortgage lights water gotta get paid
Work all day so i wanna play
My girl say hey i need money
I'm like wow but its ok
We got each out back sweet lady
Whacha say ya lil girl need braces
She need my whole check so i can't play
She got my cold beer and my favorite dish
Run my bath but she still my freak chick
I missed a weekend but family is the Shh

[Chorus]
What goes up must come down livin life on the playground
The more money we make the more it doesn't last
Livin life on the playground
You need to get up get out and get something
I Feel like im wastin time life on the play ground
You need to get up get out and get something
And get back to livin life on the playground

[Verse 2]
Aye Aye I see lil mama she 18
Living with 2 kids but she got great dreams
Flew her to burmuda I'm tryin to clear my head
Problems all around me my mom still she dead
But im just trying to stand on legs
Hopin i can stand adjustin this pressure on me
Gotta be a man sometimes i dont understand
If im comin but im going & im going
And I knowin  one day I'm gone be growin
I'm Focused I'm all in all where it started
Get the dirt off my shoulders throw it in the water
I'm still movin them boulders we done told ya we some soldiers
Keep ya head up yeah im gettin money out here get ya head up
You know it Ain't no bluffin ain't no blowin
I just got one life to live and im gonna live it my way

[Chorus]
What goes up must come down livin life on the playground
The more money we make the more it doesn't last
Livin life on the playground
You need to get up get out and get something
I Feel like im wastin time life on the play ground
You need to get up get out and get something
And get back to livin life on the playground
