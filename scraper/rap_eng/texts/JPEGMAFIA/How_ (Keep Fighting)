[Intro]
Coming from the slums of never more
Is a child who can't take no more
A discounted hood champion
A nigga that made short comings his cum
But yet I still get no fucking love
I'm on the verge of blacking out
The forecast is looking like red clouds
The seas are becoming diseased
There's no light, no life getting to the trees
So I can't even really fucking breathe

[Chorus]
Is this the reality?
How am I suppose to be?

[Verse 1]
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying
No more, no more, no more fucking crying
I can't let them take me the fuck down!
I'm the ghost of king Mike Brown!
I'm coming with the mothafuckin g123
These white mothafuckas can't even touch me!
BRRRR KAT BRRR KAT!
I'm a crazy mothafuckin bat
Fight back, fight back, fight back!
