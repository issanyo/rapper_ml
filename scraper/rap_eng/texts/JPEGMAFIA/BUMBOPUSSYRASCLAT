"BUMBOPUSSYRASCLAT" (wow)
Yeah, niggas ain't hip to the new traps (no)
Who's that?
Niggas get clapped in a group chat (no)
Two rats, got 'em on scope where the brew at
Cops ain't ready for this shit
Bad to the bone
Fuck a badge and a gun (damn, Peggy)
Gat in my lap
Get your badge, nigga run (wow)
Imma go OJ on this shit (damn, Peggy)
Imma go Bill Cosby on a bitch

Always running to the feds (this is true)
All these fucking tats but you got no bread (wow, sorry)
No fucking guap (none)
No fucking clout (none at all)
You acting like a bitch
Boy, you scared to come out the house (he is a bitch)
You scared to come to my place (that's true)
You scared to talk in my face (that's also true)
You filing paper work cause you scared of catching this fade
It's better have No Malice cause I'm good with the Clipse (shoutout Pusha-T)
You better have a chalice cause I "shoot" from the hip (I'm gonna kill you)
Metal Gear Solid, I got rockets in my crew (solid snake, nigga)
You don't know the shooters but the shooters know you (you're fucked)
My lawyer asked me, "Peggy, why you going so hard?" (what?)
I told that bitch, "Shut up, hoe, this my fucking job" (indeed)
This my fucking squad (uh huh)
That's my fucking pot
This my fucking city, bitch
Fuck out me yard (me yard)

[Outro]
"Um, final question in this poll: 30% of Americans, only 30%, see Hilary Clinton as being honest and trustworthy but 34% only see you as being honest and trustworthy. Again, are you gonna tell a message that might get that number up?" "Um, I'm honest, I'm trustworthy, I tell it like it is, I'm here, I didn't need to do this, I'm enjoying it, but I'm enjoying it because we're going to make America great again. We are going to make America great again. We're also going to make America safe again, Bill."
