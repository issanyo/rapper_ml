[Intro]
Bitch I shop Whole Foods like I'm booooujie!
Pass the blunt, my mind is missing
Tweet my shit I need the mentions
Stop pretending
Look!

[Verse 1]
Riding round the city like a side bitch
Hermit till I die, close the blinds bitch
Momma told me baby you's a prophet, so profit
And treat these fucking labels like a side, hold up
Fuck it dog had do it
Reviewers looking stupid, stick to music
I'm am the Black God, fuck a human, Stanley Kubrick
You know the rapping shit be therapeutic
Pitchfork told me to never be abusive unless I'm moving units
I see what the truth is
'Cause niggas preaching bout the pussy be the biggest douches
Wow

[Verse 2]
I'm out the window looking real stupid
Fuck that, it's young Sully how I peep the ruins
Trust that, I whip the whip like the shit been boosted
My bus pass ain't been legit since I smashed Karrueche (not true)
These people thinking that they warriors, they straight kabuki
I hit your momma with Conker's Bad Fur Day
Goldeneye hit em up
Perfect Dark nigga for the job so I zip em up
And put em in a bag like I'm picking up dog shit
