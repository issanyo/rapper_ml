Part 1: Big Data (Produced by JPEGMAFIA)

[Intro: Freaky]
Dot, dot, data
Data (data)

[Hook: Freaky]
Data, big data, big data
I got a big data
Thousand exas, couple zettas
I need every last pizza data
Still the beta, million peda's
Big data, big data, big data
If you don't wanna give it to me, imma steal your data
I need more data
I got big data
I know your behavior
You're on my radar
Got your meta data and date a birth
A big data

[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
Fresh gigabytes
Dropbox fiend
.zip for the files
.rar for the win
Ike & Tina Turna flac
To a .wav, man
We can get you high
Just don't play me cheap, yeah
Bitcoin poppin' out my pocket
Like I was Satoshi, yeah
Henrik, hat trick
You can't touch my goalie, yeah
Pedabyte
Terabyte
You know I'm moving lowkey, yeah
Bounce like a check while she sucking on my trophies, yeah
Damn, I got these putos jumping like they was an uso, yeah
How you try fee come Peggy neck with so-so music, hah?
Bufferin', bufferin'
Bitch, you never answer
The man talk slick, I got nothing but the ganja
Keyboard killers always trying to load they Mac's up
Ain't did shit in 5 seasons like Sansa
Fuck all your banter
I move like a panther
Smokin' on that I am not a human, click a Captcha

[Instrumental Break]

[Hook: Freaky]
Big data, big data, big data
I got a big data
Thousand pixels, couple zetas
I need every last piece of data
Steal the beta, million peta's
Big data, big data, big data
If you don't wanna give it to me, imma steal your data
I need more data
I got big data
I know your behavior
You're on my radar
Got your meta data and your date of a birth of big data

[Verse 2: Freaky]
Raahh, she glad I date her
Cause I got a big data
Wanted me to date her
Cause my big, big, big data
Big data, big data
She all on my big data
They all on my big data
Canâ€™t get off of my big data
Why are y'all on my big data?
Hop off my big data
Big data

[Verse 3: JPEGMAFIA]
Big data, big data
No debater
Pop them like the percolator
And she on me cause I'm solid like Terminator
Peggy run it like Wayne in like '07 but I'm not a skater
Off addy, off the gas, gotta get that paper
Heath Slater, hold your gut like you in labor
She too sweet to savor
Damn, I guess I got your data
You be trying to save her
But I'm that bitch savior

[Verse 4: Freaky]
Frozen in my exabyte trove
Big data sets
Weaponizing drones
Cameras on my phone
Never home alone
@ symbol my icy database
Karma whore hoarding info like the digi bit
With a gun barrel between your teeth
You only speak in vowels
Data only compiles
People only complain
The internet ain't safe

Part 2: The Internet Ain't Safe (Produced by Freaky)

[Intro: The Kid's Guide To The Internet]
"Set! We're riding on the internet! Cyberspace, set free! Hello virtual reality! Interactive appetite, searching for a website, a window to the world that to get online. Take the spin, now your in with the techno set. You're going surfing on the internet!"
"Hey there it's us again. This is my brother, Peter, mom and dad, and I'm Dasha. Today, we're going to be showing our friends, Andrew and Lisa, the basics of the internet and we thought you might wanna come along."
"Hey, it'll be cool!"
"Now here's a little background: when we installed internet access on our computer I got the whole family involved."
"It's true. Everybody had their own task to do."
"It's a lot of work but it was really worth it"
"Now are we're gonna go on the internet? I'd rather be on my computer doing just about anything."
"It's really cool."

[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
Shout out Chelsea Manning (skrr)
Shout out Edward Snowden (skrr)
Cursor on my head
Cursor on my head
I hope I'm never chosen, uh (skrr, skrr, skrr..)
Niggas thinking that their data safe (skrr)
But it ain't safe no more, bitch (skrr)
Keep on thinking that the fader safe (skrr)
Cause they ain't safe no more, bitch (skrr, skrr, skrr)
I heard that you think your lady safe (skrr)
But she ain't safe no more, bitch (aye, aye)
Internet ain't gonna keep you safe (aye)
W3, fucking with me (aye)
All that shit is mine (aye, aye)
I can't get enough
I'm off that .PDF (whoo)
I'm Debo in my mind (skohh)
Debo in my mind (skoh, skoh)
Yeah, new wrist rockin' ice glist often (skrr)
Can't stop copping (skrr)
Shop until dropping (skr, skr, skr...)
Get these bitches popping off my address (whoo)
Click it and ticket
They think that I'm fresh (whoo, whoo)
Never put your dick and your face in the same pic (skrr, skrr, skrr)
Upload your shit to my cloud
Like I claimed it (rrr)
Passwords is old, usernames ain't the same, bitch (SKEE. skee.)
Back slash, back slash, watch me switch up the language (skee, skeee)

[Verse 2: Freaky]
Ew, ew, ew
Boobs and face in the same picture
She says I'm her main mister
I said that shit ain't safe, yo
That shit ain't safe, yo
Nudies ain't safe, yo
Your dick pics ain't safe, yo
That shit ain't safe, yo
Fuck
W3 ain't safe dot com
Trolls spam and bots
Surveil your thoughts
Upload, upload, upload
Over throw, over throw, over throw
Over load, over load, over load
Digital embryo, evermore
Torrent my life sell it for a price
Advertise, advertise
Apple pies, iPhone 9
You ain't safe when you online
Don't believe me?
Google your whole mind
Update
A couple times a day
Check in, never really checked out
Chest out when I die
Put my IP on my tombstone, bury me alive
With my ID and all my hard drives
Imma die online
Feds tap my line
Imma kill myself online
Imma put it all online
Imma let you inside my mind
No warrant
