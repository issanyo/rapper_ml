[Verse]
Hulk hogan known to keep the thang smokin'
Steady fuckin' with a blonde I think I’m Frank Ocea-
(DJ Snitch Bitch)
Be still... I can’t deal with all these sudden motions
Mac high as Sierra, your updates is frozen
Crouching in the bushes like I’m jailposing
That 38 special team, I don’t need coaching
You are not a man bitch, you're a fucking token
Giuliani, suck a dick, that’s the fucking slogan
Black market shawty, keep the thang on me
Blood on my money but ain’t a stain on me
Ridge racer, no games for me
New money new habits
Make you disappear with no trace that’s tragic
Riding down Calvert in a caddy with the ratchet
Pussy call the cops so much
The cops should give him badges
Hold up let me hear that back?

[Chorus]
Alright!
