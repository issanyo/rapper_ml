[Intro]
AHHHHHHHHHHHH

[Verse 1: Abdu Ali]
How the fuck you feeling, feeling?
You ain't got no feelings, feelings
The matrix got you dreaming
False creaming, take the bug out
So you can see what I'm sanging
Ha, what you scared now nigga?
Put down the god damn phone my nigga
You see the bombs they drop my nigga?
Then drugged bitches with some soda pop
Many of the fam took a shot
Then got hung with bible locks
No pop and lock
Niggas ain't got no freedom
And now Machines our fuckin leaders?
How the fuck you leading?
Who the fuck you leading?

[Chorus]
You don't even realize
We become mechanical
Drinking from the chemicals of our end

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
I kissed the world
Baby girl and I liked it
Looked her in the eye
And told that bitch to be my sidekick
Never met a nigga with a chip like me
I'm priceless
Then I went straight for the head like Isis
Young peg Tyson
Anytime and anyplace
I hack your wifi
Fuck the machine
Ima take your life friend
So stop fucking around bitch
And gimme all my damn chips

[Outro]
Da da da dot dot dot dot dao!
You gotta move now
