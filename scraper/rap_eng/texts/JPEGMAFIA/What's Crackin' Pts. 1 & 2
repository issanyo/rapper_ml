[Verse]
Bitch nigga, what's crackin', dog?
Heard you 'bout that action, dog
My flow tight, no slackin', dog
My pants fit loose, no fashion, dog

Catch a pop kettle, black after dawn
Made the guest list, never changed my song
I still call these snakes like Otacon
I'm a straight black male, bitch
You can't take that
Ooh you hate that
Run up on O'Malley like, "Here's the payback"
Spoke on the wheel like I'm Pat Sajak
So Mobb Deep, Rick Ross, your Maybach
Burn down your house and erase your ASCAP
Young Karen O, black Dave Sitek
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm in debt, now pay that
Ross, Rachel, Chandler Bing
You niggas ain't funny with or without a laugh track
Wish a nigga would, boy
I'm bringing the Kliq back
Reach for the belts
Vince won't let me snatch that
Kill a cop, bill a cop, call me young Peggy rock
Whatchu gonna do when that motherfucking elbow drop?
Fuckboys can't stir the pot
Cuz' I shut niggas down like they working for Birkenstock
I do it for my niggas and my niggas only
Cause don't nobody like us and not even lowkey
My niggas untouched like KONY
Your niggas like snitches, they run to the police
Boko Haram I'm a God to my homies
Cut up your fam boy and mail you the proceeds
Anti-brony
Pussy, blow me
Peggy Paccino
Fuck a Tony
Uh

Popeye my spincach, we cashin' I'm zooted
Play with my money, I do you like Luther
Martin the King, or I X you like Malcolm
Fuck what you heard bitch, I'm changing the outcome
Thoughts be too loud, need to turn down the volume

I be too high and my thoughts be too slow
But I can let up, I go for the gold
