[Intro: JPEGMAFIA]
Motherfucker

[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
If I hear one more nigga saying #alllivesmatter (all lives matter)
Gat to your back, bitch
All lives splatter
No love lost in the land of the free

[Hook: JPEGMAFIA]
When your race be on the I.D
#Trussmidaddi
When your race be on the I.D
#Trussmidaddi
"What is so controversial?"
When your race be on the I.D
#Trussmidaddi
"Plantation politics"
When your race be on the I.D
Now, #Trussmidaddi

[Instrumental Break]
(Trust me! Trust me, uh while you-)

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
Uh, while you niggas bumpin'
Lightskin dance hall tracks
I was clicking and picking all my guns off of Amazon
Trust me
I shoot real good
Never fake it
I had to hit the marksmen
To make out of basic
All my bitch niggas know what I'm talking about
I had to take it back to '05 and walk it out
Why every woke song you niggas make
You be shitting on yourselves?
Pathetic, somebody gotta be Ice Cube and dead it
Now if I said it I meant it
You run this verse back enough times u get infected
I got the antiseptic
I dropped BBC three months ago
And haven’t heard shit that I’m impressed with
So fuck it, imma press this
That good shit you got
The one you keep in a secret folder
And stay trying to flex with
Ain’t fucking with my next shit
Shout out to my nigga Micah Johnson down in Texas
He fucked them cops good I can’t wait for the next hit
Hit after hit after hit after hit
Since you crackers loves stats and percentages
I got a fresh one for you and it goes like this:
Every last cop that died in Dallas can suck my dick
In the afterlife
And if a war comes I’m shooting husbands after wives
They don’t want me in the suburbs
Giving your girl that good wood, cracker
She said I’m suberp, superb like no other
I grip that ass tight when I’m doggystyling your mother
She keep throwing it back imma give u some tanned brothers
I’ll be damned if I hold hands with a cop like he my cousin
You rock a blue uniform then? Peggy don’t see color
But I ain’t trying to get smothered
I just wanna bust a nut in her
Plan B Peggy such a sinner
I want that John Oliver, Bill Maher, real sex, HBO Go money,  nigga

[Refrain: Freaky]
DON'T SHOOT!
*bullets*

[Outro]
"That's what he wants."
"And if he wins here, so be there. That's what happened"

"Bumping in early. Woah, two [?]"
"One of the---"
"Now, back. Ain't no [?], boy"
"How you doin'?"
"Right now we got SP"
