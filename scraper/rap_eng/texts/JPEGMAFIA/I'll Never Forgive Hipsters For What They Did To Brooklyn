[Intro]
Escape from New York
Why I say "escape from New York?"
Cause a lot of fuck niggas about to drop man

Better get the fuck out the city man
We taking that shit back man
Hipsters get the fuck out of this motherfucker man

[Verse]
What you know about coming out hard
Put you life in a bar turn a man into a God nigga
What you know about the infrared beam
Put a dot on your head while we plot on a scheme nigga
What you know about robbing your own folks
Taking out loans just pay for your home nigga
What you know about cussing out God
Cause you can't get a job and you need money now nigga
What you know about that?
What you know about this?
What you know about the deuce or the fist nigga
What you know about the world
What you know about caine/Kane
What you know about bigs
Top shot a nigga
What you know about a quarter-life crisis
Hands on my wallet

What you know about stepping outside
Fees on the line
Like they waiting on a ride nigga
Nigga what you know
I was raised in the [?]
What you know about the 56 yards
99 niggas who's getting robbed for their charzards
What you know about that white girl dog
Won't take you home cause you look like a red guard
What you know about the wages, signed to the grind
Give a fuck about a major my nigga
Tell me what you know about strangers

So you ain't know?
What you know about BK?
Fuck a hipster

Let him gentrify the freeway
What you know about keys in a bag
Fedora on the curb with my foot in your ass
D.O.A. no time for a mass
Trying to take over our culture with your PBR sipping ass
