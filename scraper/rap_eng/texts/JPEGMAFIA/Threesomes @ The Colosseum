[Intro]

Sticks and Stones

[Verse 1: NeroScream]
I just turned another stick to stone
I just turned another brick to bones!

Intrest loans
Why dont people just leave me alone
Just leave me alone in peace for me to sing my songs

I need a Nia Long
But like three of those
And some condoms for the threesomes at the Colosseum

Im like Mia Wallace when it comes to being conscious
Im like the Son of Sam when I got the gun in hand

Hundred grand
You thought you understand my plans
But youre a scam
You really thought that you my mans
I do my dance
The groovy tunes ensue at last

I just turned another stick to stone

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
Sticks and stones, stocks and bonds. Bitch im Chaka Khan
I run it back, I get the sack, I keep it under arms
My daddy told me dont amuse these negros, keep your calm
Im fucking smash brothers, your squad be the power stones

Profits, Profits, Profits, Profits
Will my margins every close
Can't keep up this happy home
Fuck the Johnsons, And the Jones

I dig that ditch, i keep that chrome
I fuck that bitch, you love that hoe

I just passed that bitch to my bros
Because they'll keep her safe when you not at home

Everything effortless nigga, you dont pay the piper you pray to the prophet
Real niggas talking, so stop it
And keep your body out my moshpit

Imma keep speaking this nonsense
Shooting blank nuts at your consience
Im your consequence and your god
Hillary Clinton with nuts on her spine

Peggy the martian im not of this kind
Im Wayne in his prime
Im pre culture Shyne
Im Pink Floyd with a dirty mind
