[Intro]
Message..
Put my phone in there..
Sin city..
Yo..

[Verse 1]
Only the strong survive in the land of the beast
I can't feel where I sleep
I can't shit where I eat
So how I'm supposed to win (women)
Sin city

[Hook 1]
Baby I'm a ratchet
I don't bury hatchets
I just bury bodies
AK or shotty
Pull up to your 'rari
Nigga think he gnarly
But not me
Br-br-br-br, yo

[Verse 2]
New phone who dis?
It's my nigga Peggy on the other line
He said, "These niggas pressed for the pussy
Trying to be rappers, I just don't know why.."
Niggas can't rap so they just act
Never seen a brick but they want trap
Always in my face trying to give dap
Now watch Peggy turn all your leaders
Into motherfucking hashtags
Bitch, I'm on the cash grab
I ain't brown I'm a black man
Swinging up all in your girl crib like I'm Batman
Keep that whack shit in the trash can
Hype beast chinks wanna be black so bad
Oh. Hey, nice to meet ya
Fucked your girl and gave you a feature
You call it lust? I call it ether
But I'll take that free pizza

[Hook 2]
I got a motor
Motor, motor, motor, motor
On my mouth
I'm a coder
Coder, coder, coder
Killing for the south
Fuck your friends
Fuck your intelligence
Bitch, I'm at your crib
With your chick
And she all on my dick
You can't fuck with this
Cause I'm always
Always, always, always
Walking with my nine
Wanna try me
Try me, try me
Bitch, I always got the time
Up in this
Bitch, I'm making hits
All in my apartment
I'll pay my rent
Down the dollars and cents
Your girl keep whispering (bih?)
She said

[Bridge]
Baby, (talk to you)
I wanna do (talk to you)
All the (talk to you)
Things your (talk to you)
Man won't do
I'll do it for you (talk to you)
(talk to you, talk to you)
I said
Baby (baby)
I wanna do (wanna do)
All the (all the)
Things your man won't do
(talk to you, talk to you)
I'll do them for you
(talk to you, talk to you)

[Verse 3]
Oh my god it's a new man
Coming outside with the rock like Hujan
I sell to the blue man
I sell to the babies
I sling to the Klux Klan
I don't take chances
I rap like a panther
You rap like you want answers
Even If I had cancer
I'd spit to the death
And change my name to "Bald head propaganda"
You don't know what you wanna be
So you sing like Aubrey
And spit like a wannabe
But bitch, I'm what you want to be
I rap with the spirit of Cube and P. Easy
I can't help that you're not a factor
No service, you Sprint
I lap you
No offense to Adam Sandler
But I had enough of this Jewish actor

[Hook 3]
Got a motor
Motor, motor, motor, motor
On my mouth
I'm a coder
Coder, coder, coder
Killing for the south
Fuck your prince
Fuck your intelligence
Bitch, I'm at your crib
With your bitch
And she all on my dick
You can't fuck with this
Bitch, I'm always
Always, always, always
Walking with my nine
Wanna try me
Try me, try me
Bitch I always got the time
Oh shit
Drop my nine
If you touch it
It's a crime
Niggas want me
Come and get me
Bitch, I shine
Bitch, I shine
I ain't hiding
From no nigga

[Outro]

"[?] because of their race, because they're not supposed to think like this and talk like this and all the white liberals just don't like it, do you?"
"Well, I uh.. they're the most racist people there are because y'know they put you in a little categorized box 'You have to think this way' 'How could you dare come off the plantation?' (scream)
