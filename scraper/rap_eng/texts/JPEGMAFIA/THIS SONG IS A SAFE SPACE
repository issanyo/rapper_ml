[Intro: JPEGMAFIA]
I don't wanna cry no more, yah
I don't wanna die no more, yah
Cause I don't wanna rap no more

[1st Verse: JPEGMAFIA]
When white people rap I think of suicide (Cuck, cuck)
Heard your track bro, now I wanna die (Cuck, cuck, cuck)
Tats on my face I'm so fucking pie(?) (Cuck)
Imma turn the damn trap into Columbine (Cuck)
Where my deal at? Where my steel at?
Boy I kill cacs, [?]
I ain't a rapper bruh
I don't feel that
I'm just a cracker bro
Get hated everywhere I go
I pulled up on a trust fund kid
Made him beg for his iPhone 6
I know his momma paid all that shit
I caught that cracker with a banzai kick
I take snaps when I hit that lick
I'm too cold when I'm sipping on the apple berry
I change modes when I'm kicking it with Katy Perry's
My black soul ain't enough for me to make a living
White girl got an ass like Meg Griffin
I told that bitch to grab a fork and hit the damn kitchen
Bust a nut up on her face and call it reparitions (hold up) reparations
My reputation got me banned from all of your fucking safe spaces
All them pronouns you still racist

[Hook: Freaky]
They don't wanna be white anymore
They don't wanna be white anymore
They're more than just white now

Swagger

[2nd Verse: Freaky]
I got a white boy I think I finna tat his face
Got (a) white boy who rap I think he's trans-race
I know an asian girl with cornrolls she says cause she based
I know a white girl with grills she says it's cause she's from the bay
I know a white girl who think she ain't cause she speak "Ã¡ndale"
I know white people who think they very fond of me
I know white people rap only cause the economy
(They don't wanna be white anymore)
(They're more than just white now)

Facetime my white boy
Facetime his white mom
Face palm his white (d)ad
Face fuck my white girl
Facetime her white dad
Facetime my white girl
Facetime her white mom
Facepalm his white dad
Facefuck my white boy
Facetime her white mom

When white people rap I think of suicide (suicide)
When white people rap, feel like I've lost some shit that's mine (I lost my mind)
When white people rap I feel like it's not mine (I lost my mind)
When white people rap they make a pretty (dime) (I wanna cry)

[3rd Verse: Black Sheep Refugees]

[Buffalo: Hook]
I don't wanna lie no more
I don't have to try no more
I can never cry no more
*cut*

[Buffalo: Verse]
I don't even wanna hear a white nigga speak
I dont ever wanna see a white nigga teach
If me and a white nigga ever meet
I'ma turn his ass into..
Dark Meat!
Food ass niggas
Make a nigga wanna eat
Fruity ass niggas
Make a nigga want beef

[Drug Dillon aka Deej Cokane]
Fucking white boys keep wearing shark teeth

[Buffalo]
Niggas talk money
But I know that talk cheap
You gon learn today
If you try and chalk me

[Farraji]
Bitch you better pray
Before you try and cross me

[Buffalo]
You just hardly living
I'm just killing softly

[Farraji]
Snatch you at that starbucks
While you drinking coffee
Catch you in the club
While you dancing off beat

[Buffalo]
All of us in the VIP
Some of us in here
All fake I.D.'s
Shallow ass niggas know
We came here deep

[Drug Dillon aka Deej Cokane]
Grew up on a farm
And you used to heard sheep
But we the black sheep
White sheep
Can't beat

[Farraji]
Soon as I roll my weed
They wanna hang by me
I'm not the type of nigga
You can hang by tree
Bitch I'll beat your ass
Like my name Ali

[Mikey S]
And I'll get you laid under a white sheet
Shoutout JPEG man this a nice beat!

[Black Sheep Refugees]
WE HATE YALL
WE HATE YALL

[Farraji]
