[Chorus]
'Fraid to leave a stoop, 'fraid to leave a stoop
'Fraid to leave a stoop, 'fraid to leave a stoop
I'm a stoop, kid, afraid to leave a stoop
'Fraid to leave a stoop, uh

[Verse 1]
Uh, young nigga on a stoop with a shotgun
Baby I'm a slave to the profit
Lost kid and my girlfriend a boss bitch
Sling around, throw the page in the garbage
Baby said she only beg for the paper
Lick the bowl, bring the pot to the neighbour
Like, how you want, how you want, how you want it
I got that fucking flavour

[Verse 2]
(Niggas on the roof with a shotgun)
Fuck the devil
Black man's choice: spit rhymes or peddle
Seen both sides on the pot and kettle
Oh my gosh, I'm a seed of the Based God
Fuck love and peace, I spit hate crimes
No deal for me, fuck a co-sign
'Cause if I want mine, nigga, I'mma take mine

[Verse 3]
(Niggas on the roof with a shotgun)
Fuck that bitch
Stoop kid afraid of the change and shit
Stuck in my ways I'm a young old kid
25 in my right mind, voice of the youth it's a sign of the times
Generation Y, 1989
(Niggas on the roof with a shotgun)

[Chorus]
'Fraid to leave a stoop, 'fraid to leave a stoop
'Fraid to leave a stoop, 'fraid to leave a stoop
I'm a stoop, kid, afraid to leave a stoop
'Fraid to leave a stoop, uh

(Niggas on the roof with a shotgun)
