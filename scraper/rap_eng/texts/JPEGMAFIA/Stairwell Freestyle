Any left wing motherfucker trying to be your friend is an enemy
Don't believe in his frenemy tactics
These niggas do backflips to get a pat on the head
You step to me and you're dead
Get your liberal ass kicked
Same bitch memorized every Chief Keef verse
The same one to call the cops
Think you want to steal her purse
It hurts to say this
Niggas think they doing favors but these hipster motherfuckers
Wanna steal all our creations and claim credit for 'em
Rewrite history, Chuck Berry to Elvis
Make our shit a mystery, rock, blues, techno, soul, jazz, and R&B
What do they have in common?
Niggas started it, now they barely have a part in it
Now some kids wanna be a fireman, a doctor
A rapper, a ball player, even a fucking dog watcher
Go to the NFL, be a teacher or a chemist
Make an app for iPhone and get paid for your inventions
But think real hard, think one long minute
I never heard one kid say they wanna be a critic
See, that's every single hipster's backup plan
They failed at everything else, they need some backup, man
They spend all their parents' money
All their trust fund cash, and flunk out
And these are the niggas y'all let run rap, god damn
See, these 90's babies scared to talk shit
So if I gotta be that nigga I'mma be that nigga, call you out
Grimes vinyl in a beartrap, I'mma draw you out
Take you in the back of an alley somewhere and maul you out
Then hop up in my whip and tell you to gentrify this dick
You hipster bitch
Fuck outta here, man
