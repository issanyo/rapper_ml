[Chorus]
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right

[Verse]
Fucking with the six everywhere I go
I got a million dollars but I'll never ever show
If I can't get the bread, believe I got the butter
Riding around my city looking for a baby mother
Seen a girl outside, and I know what she been doing
She alert, I am too, and I know she want that action
Baby I'm sorry, put a refund in the mattress
Baby all my meat got a passion for the flashing baby
Passion of the Christ all around the fucking world
Basking in the lights, diamonds, rubies, fucking pearls
Bitch you know I'm good, everywhere's a fucking show
I can put you on, it's all about who you fucking know
So do me a favor and let me be your caper
I'll be your favorite John baby I know you
Don't want it if I cannot afford it
But I want passion over action imma take you on tour, rich nigga

[Bridge with Sample]
I know you want this dick, baby
I know you want it baby
You want all this shit
I say I know you want it baby
Stop fuckin' playin'
I know you want it baby
Now suck this dick
I say I know you want it baby (ho)

[Chorus]
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
Get yo mind right, nigga get yo mind right
