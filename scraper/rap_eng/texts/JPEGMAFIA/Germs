Part I

[Verse 1]
Off top, bitch I'm rolling
Can't stay focused
I'm hopeless
I want white like a token
Blunts stay rolling, I’m posted
Catch you home alone Macaulay Culkin
Matt Hardy, my gun you getting broken
Your bitch wet and she throatin'
My girl blonde like Goten

[Bridge]
It’s no shade (Not at all baby)
You can’t take (Easy money)
You know that I’m grand prize
Ahhhh you know I-

Part II

[Verse 2]
Bitch I got the sauce and It's wopped up
Stocks up
I might slip and shoot a cop up
They not us
I'ma make em put his guard / god up
Jesus
Hot sauce
With the cross up
(Can’t take!)
I finesse em with a better body
Fresh Prince, no prints on a severed shotty
Kill Trump, do 'em like Floyd did Gatti
(It’s no shade)

[Break]
Man, look it ain't no motherfucking shade, I'm just talking
You the one that got that liberal arts degree

[Outro]
Yahhhhh whoooooooo!
It’s no shade! (YOWWWWWW!)
You can’t take! (Whooooo! Yea)
You know I give it (Yea!)
I serve it
You know that I’m grand prize
It’s no shade
You can't take
You know I give it, I serve it
You know that I’m grand prize
