[Intro]
I can turn a god to man
I can turn a brick , to a band
I can turn a house to a hen
I can put your girl on plan
...Trips to japan
I can watch Akira with your girl
I can put my hand on her curves
I can run the game on the bird
I can never put shame on my word
I can't give you the world

[Verse 1]
I can make a mountain, from a rainbow
I can get a perfect score in Halo
I can do the thing though
Work it from you body to your ankles
But I can never give you all my bankroll
Cause baby who are you?

[Chorus]
She's got the most beautiful pussy
She's got the most beautiful pussy
(My girl, My girl, My girl)
She's got the most beautiful pussy
She's got the most beautiful pussy

[Break]
I can turn a man to a bitch
I can turn a hoe to a snitch
I can turn band to a brick
I can put the gun to your dome
I put the holes in the chrome
Fuck with me...
I heard they looking for your boy
I just hope they find em
Cause a nigga, ain't employed
Hiding in the church
I'm blending in nicely
Cause i'm a not a black pope
The pope is a white me, nigga

[Verse 2]
I can turn a man from a slob
I can turn a girl to a god
I can work the middle
Oh i promise
Baby I'm so honest
Hunt you until I fucking make a profit
Cause baby where are you..


[Chorus]
She's got the most beautiful pussy
She's got the most beautiful pussy
(I know, I know, I know)
She's got the most beautiful pussy
She's got the most beautiful pussy

I never seen it real good
Just a quick glimpse
When she's over my house
And she's trying on clothes
