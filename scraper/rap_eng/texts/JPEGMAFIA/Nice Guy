[Intro: JPEGMAFIA]
Bobbi! Bobbi!
Let's do it

[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
You gots to show up, I gots to show out
Gotta keep my head down, 'till a nigga get left out
And then stepped on, talk shit, how?
'Cause my kick's up, and I'm kicked out
And I'm stepped on, my lies, out like fuck truth
Tweet big shit but don't come through, fuck boy
Bring guns through, but he don't shoot
Gotta... Got a hundred proof, and I'm bulletproof
Yeah. Hol' up. Yeah

[Hook 1: Micah E. Wood]
I've been thinking, we've been thinking
You don't really know
I've been thinking, we've been thinking
You don't really know

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
Nah, you ain't no nice guy, I ain't no nice guy
Thought I was the right guy, but I'm outta sight, bye
Past tense, in another land, sippin' french
All of this money, [?]
You labyrinth, I put a car in it, then [?]
For the last time, take a hit, go slow, I'm taking chips
[?]
I don't give two shits about that, this, or any other shit, yeah

[Hook 2: Bobbi Rush & JPEGMAFIA]
You don't even realize
You're not the nice guy
[x8]

[Verse 3: JPEGMAFIA]
I ain't no nice guy, I got the price wide
I gotta sell goods, I gotta get pie
Gotta flip chips, I gotta get cash
I gotta stay on, I gotta stay [?]
I can't be a nice guy
Baby I'm the wrong one, you need a fucking white guy
Not a fucking [?], [?] a nigga from the south side

[Hook 1: Micah E. Wood]
I've been thinking, we've been thinking
You don't really know
I've been thinking, we've been thinking
You don't really know
