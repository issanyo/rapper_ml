[Verse 1]
Gotta get my ends up
Gotta get my friends up
Tired of being in the friendzone
I 've been out in the endzone
Touchdown on a real place
Got down in the real space
I've been down on my space
Ever since the days of Myspace
I was driving in the tri-state
You got expired plates
I've been outside waiting
For the right moment
To talk, To talk, To you oh

[Verse 2]
Oh my god
These pigs want to take my life
26 no job
And now they're gonna take away my license
I'm a failure
Hope my niggas can bail me
Out of this cell that I'm goin' it
Fuck all you bitches I'm going in
My momma told me I'd be dead when I'm 25 (25)
Jokes on you, bitch, I'm still alive (still alive)
He came closer
I grabbed my toaster
Put the gun to the dome of a dead cop
Who's the owner
(gunshot)

[Bridge]
Been in all, been in all, been in all, been in all
I
That I know, that I know, that I know, that I know, know
I

[Verse 3]
I've been on Xans
Keep the coke in the can so you punks understand me (punks understand me)
I've been on pills
Keep the grams in the seal so you punks understand me (punks understand me)
I've been all night
With my hand on the pipe so you punks understand me (punks understand me)
Send a pig to the grave
Bad with the brains punks understand me

[Outro]
Gotta get them ends, get them ends
Hope the cops don't shoot my friends, shoot my friends
(hey, yeah)
"-that's right."
"Your god and your gun."
"Your what?"
"Your god and your gun."
"My god and my gun. What'd I say?"
"My god and my gun."
