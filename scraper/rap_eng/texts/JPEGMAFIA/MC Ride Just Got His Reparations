It's like Ghostface and I'm twice the killer
Twin Peaks shoot boy, I'm gonna clap me a nigga
Like he gave a good performance, catch him while he yawnin'
The best part of your mamma wakin' up is mornin'

Riding down the street I'm lookin at this white boy
He's staring back at me, I'm like "What the fuck you lookin' at cracker?" (Boy)
That's for slavery nigga, and all your grandfathers puttin' chains on me nigga

Know this girl named Alexis
Say that I'm sexist
I ain't down with feminists
So I don't fuck with that shit
Sounding like a bitter angry bitch undercover
Silly rabbit milk is for brown people and single mothers

Somebody love you
Don't let them slide
I got the message
I know you stressin'
We gon' get by
Just take my hand
And close your eyes
Open your mind
Open your thighs
Take on my lust
I'm MC Ride
