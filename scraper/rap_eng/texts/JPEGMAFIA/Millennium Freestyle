[Intro]
Fire and ash
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
At night I, at night I think of you
I want to be your baby, you know you want me to
And if your game is on, got to give me a call boo
And if your love is strong, got to give my all to
And if my baby is wrong, I got that thing tucked inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Break]
You're not black, so drop the racism crap

[Bridge]
Girl, you should know that, I got a pound on me
And I'm on probation so they gonna violate me
Cholo, cholo, cholo

[Verse 2]
Fuck the beat, let me ends speak, yeah
Fuck the streets let this benz speak (Talk!)
Veterans and we ten deep, heh
Fuck me in the right way (The right way)
Get me booked for the nice dates (Fuck)
Oh, man, I'm a soloist (Okay!)
Can't break no bread with no label, bitch!
No, you cannot have my masters, no
Cause I made that beat from scratch, bitch, no
Where the fuck do they do that shit? No

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you are my fire, the one desire
Believe when I say, I want it that way
I hate your bloodline, I can't make shoreline
I won't when I say, I want it that way, for real, for real, for real
(You finally called me)
Ain't nothing but a heartache, ain't nothing but a mistake
I never wanna hear you say, I want it that way
I never wanna hear you say, I want it that way

[Break]
You're not black, so drop the racism crap
