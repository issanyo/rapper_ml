[Hook: Butch Dawson]
Look me in my face, won't you?
Look me in my eyes, won't you?
You ain't feeling great, On you?
In that case then, I don't want you
Hey, oh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Butch Dawson]
Look at me straight
Then glad at me
Ready to give me the love then?
Fantastic
Attitude vivid, I run and y'all panic
Can run with the rough
You niggas is plastic
Hustle back with a bag
Fag through a factory
Track a chapter from great times
You had it
Jared bought a nice style colorful canvas
S class finessed fans double my catches
So and so
And dust to ashes
Funeral fig cleaned up
Check the fabric
I come quick like some neck with talent
Pump the vehic's
Buckle would to 3 6
I'm in a league of my own
Breathe on a bead
Imma leave it alone (alone)
Little OD
Get the fees and your gone
Believe that I've been reading it wrong

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
Oh my God
I bet y'all wanna live my life
I'm the young Earnheart
Hit curbs when I bang them rights
A-Rod when hit them strikes
Snoop Dogg when I hit that pipe
Based God when I wear them tight-
Jeans
Young Peglord
Pop shit, catch a crime scene
Pussy nigga on my dick like a high beam
Double barrel on my hip, I'm Bison
Two hits, one round, I'm Tyson
No bank, just cash
I'm priceless
We not the same
Bet you will see
The guns come together like intimacy
Who gave a fuck?
Never did we
Peggy on bat
Then imma flee, hm

[Hook: Butch Dawson]
Look me in my face, won't you?
Look me in my eyes, won't you?
You ain't feeling great, On you?
In that case then, I don't want you
Look me in my face, won't you?
Look me in my eyes, won't you?
You ain't feeling great, On you?
In that case then, I don't want you
Hey, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
"He asked me to join the mafia
I was like 'JPEG, nah nigga'"
