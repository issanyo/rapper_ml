[Intro]
Beefing with me, you gon' die
Y'all niggas talking about me we gonna see what the fuck you got to say now, nigga

[Verse]
These pussy niggas on a war path
Fucking around with JPEG you will get six shots to the head
Black Sean Penn I beat that bitch
All my niggas stay refocused
You don't really want it with the JPEG, trick
Choke you with a MIDI cable make you sing a hit, boy
Niggas think they can get to my bands
With your fake rapping ass always looking for a handout
You gonna see six niggas on the bus
Three shots and one jump below, hit the canvas
I can get you anywhere fuckboy I'm random
Kill at will I am O'Shay Jackson
Young black and gifted but don't get it twisted
I take a cracker's soul out his body leave him uplifted, bitch

[Break]

Pussy nigga want me in the war path
Hold up bitch, I am the star of the cast
Talk a lot of shit, never hit, do the math
I don't fuck around
You don't wanna wrestle because you green in this town
Put you on the car but you never see the map
For that fronting like you hard you gonna die in a dark match
Fuck nigga this ain't what you want
Fuck nigga this ain't what you want
You know me, no tweets, no blogs, no pics if you wanna do something nigga show me
Before your life gets hacked like Sony
White Jesus said he don't know thee
Now you can mine for your life, you can mine for your wife
White boy you gon' pay what you owe me
