[Verse]
Bitch you know I'm saucin'

Beat my bitch ass like a young Steve Austin
Keep that heat stashed cuz' I'm cold like Boston
Pin that hoe down and she spread like frosting
Young Andy Kaufman
Bitch, I'm in a coffin
Rose from the dead
Got that head
Like a Petraeus
No, I don't give a fuck
Bout' how the media portray us
Cause I know pussy niggas always come in different flavors
It's like black ones
White ones
Skinny, fat, and dyke ones
Clothesline, suplex
Bitch, I might fight one
Beat my bitch ass like a young Chris Brown
The only difference is Steve pale, Chris brown
I beat my bitch ass cuz' it's only thing I'm good at
I beat my bitch ass cause I'm white and I can do that
