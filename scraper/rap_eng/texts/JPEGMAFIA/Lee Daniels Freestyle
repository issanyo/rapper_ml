Man one take this shit, man, I don't give a fuck
Uh

[Verse 1]
Turn on my TV see nothing but bullshit around me
Niggas in dresses, niggas in kitchens
Niggas acting like bitches
Fuck Lee Daniels
You could be a beacon of hope, but why bother
Tryna feminize all us niggas
Knowing most of us ain't got no father
I wish you the best, man
But you a hoe for this Empire shit
My grandfather had to die for the same rights that they just gave to you, bitch
So don't step to me with no "gay is the new black"
Acting like we some kinda brothers
Y'all done stole my past, you done stole my land
But you won't fucking take my color
Faggot

[Chorus]
I'm a G [repeated]
Fuck you nigga


[Verse 2]
Tired of that "Yes We Can" clip
My generation's so weak, fuck all this Kumbaya shit
I go for mine, and if I gotta fight, then I gotta fight
These coon ass niggas tell me work in a system
Nigga, you just wanna be white
But I love my skin, tell me nigga, do you love yours?
'Cause the asians don't
They spend so much time kissing white peoples' ass
You would think they in love with them
Thats why I don't fuck with them stupid ass niggas
Wanna follow me around your store
Giving me a hurry up and buy shtick
While crackers take all that shit, man, fuck you

[Chorus]
I'm a G [repeated]
Fuck nigga
Put that Menace II Society sample
Hurry up and buy, hurry up and buy

[Verse 3]
Holocaust, Holocaust
Every single day in class, all I heard was Holocaust
One day I asked my teacher
"What's the difference between me and them?"
He said "All y'all niggas was slaves, and the jews got paid"
Six million of y'all, yeah
A hundred million of us, or more
So excuse, 'cause I'm all out of sympathy
2015, it's a sign of the times
My best friend is a nine
If you ain't a fag, or dressed up in drag, you better know
Being black is a crime

[Chorus]
I'm a G [repeated]

[Outro]
Lil' nigga
How you expect to hold it down
When you gon' correct me
And tell me Street Fighter 1 ain't never had a bonus round
Pff, Clips killed that nigga bruh
