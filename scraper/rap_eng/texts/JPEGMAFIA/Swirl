[Intro]
Leave these little sluts man
Those sluts like that, they want Jake man
Little sluts, they want, they want niggas man
Blonde hoes, white hoes
Yeah, little white hoes
Cave bitches
Fuck white bitches, man

[Verse]
Affirmative action is for white women
I thought you knew this by now, but it seems you wasn't listening
A lot of feminists be acting like they down with it
But when it comes down to it, trust me they ain't down with it
Piggybacking off our struggles, who you fooling
They be talking down on black women and y'all wanna recruit em
Nah, I never had jungle fever, y'all don't please me
I just bust a nut in you ducks because you easy
I never vibe with feminists
Cause every time we move the needle
Y'all go Michelle Beadle and play that victim shit
White hoes like Mega Man, blast you til you drop
Take all of your powers and keep gunning for the top
Where were y'all feminists when Emmett Till got killed and George Stinney Jr. was murdered
Making picket signs?
I'm spitting facts, unbiased
How can you trust a group whose only goal is to be white men's sidekick
And you age like leather bags, you zombies
Binders full of women but my name ain't Romney
With those lips and those hips, you ain't down mommy
Stop fronting, acting black is your damn hobby
Don't trust em, just fuck em, don't love em
They are not your friends, they are cacs stop frontin
Fuck they race, fuck they creeds, fuck they world
It'd be a cold day in hell before I'm down with a swirl (nigga)
