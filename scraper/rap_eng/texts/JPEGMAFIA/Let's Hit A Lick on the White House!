[Verse 1: Freaky]
Xanned out, pissed off
Plan out, think squad
Drag out, big balls
Pass out, big gas
Chuh-chang, with that
Get back, stink pack
6 zips, 1 liter
Drank that
Picture perfect, paint that
All black, bald cap
Call back, ASAP
Where your racks?, lay flat
Payback, roll up
Haystack, made that
50 Xans, 25 dollars
Fade that
Real racks, wood grain
Maybach, I want that
Moved to Baltimore
I ain't gone back
Sold smack, no stacks
Can't lose focus
Fuck all y'all orgy
Listening to N.O.R.E
2 liter pouring
You people boring
Sippin' on the Jordan
Wake up from the dead
Like 4-5, I'm back
All your shit is horse shit
Stay rollin' Lotus
I'm off several doses
I'm super-freaky-llama-expialidocious
Oh shit
Makin' no sense
Fuego

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
Squad autonomous
Shooters anonymous
Women androgynous
We do the opposite
Peggy so dominant
Stay with one pistol like
Bitch I'm monogamous
Married to opulence
Fuck your accomplishments
Prenup my documents
Sign 'em with confidence
Fuck all the consequence
Need a Janelle Monae
So I can I can start my metropolis
These bitches incompetent
Weapons with silencers
Now killed or be killed
Decision unanimous
Not with the indie shit
No Titus Andronicus
More like Tidus up in Zanarkand
Banging Yuna and her guardians
High summon
Bringing calm again
Sinners need not to prey for Peggy
Wash you niggas cause my load is heavy
Baby fro but my spirit dreaded
When I crack the code
Watch you get embedded
