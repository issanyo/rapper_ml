[Intro: Ice Cube]
"Now let's play big bank take little bank"

[Hook: Butch Dawson]
I might rob a bank
Cause I got a tank
High up in the ranks
I might rob a bank
Cause a nigga broke
But you smoke a lot of stank
What the fuck you think?
I don't give a fuck
Had that nina tuck
Crashed the party up
Put them fingers up
Jerry Springer'd up
And stick the lobby up

[Verse 1: Butch Dawson]
I was in the crib
Grubbin' on some ribs
Fuckin' on your bitch
That's when I got a call
From my nigga Josh
He said he need a job
Push that shorty off
I told my nigga Josh, "Look here, I'm with you, dog"
We wasn't getting paid
It started as a joke
Like we can rob a bank? (one, two)

[Hook: Butch Dawson]
I might rob a bank
Cause I got a tank
High up in the ranks
I might rob a bank
Cause a nigga broke
But you smoke a lot of stank
What the fuck you think?
I don't give a fuck
Had that nina tuck
Crashed the party up
Put them fingers up
Jerry Springer'd up
And stick the lobby up

[Verse 2: Freaky]
Robbed the bank now we
Slidin' cross the interstate
Ridin' kush to the face
That candle lit like dinner dates
Smoke the shit like andale
How I smoke so much
When the rent is late
How I pull that out my ass
I swear the boy is like Cirque Du Soleil
Hip hip hooray
I fill a soda with xans
Pour a cup to my man
Sanji
Break the damn beat up
Like it's Pangea
Sing it to it like Mari Maria
Lean in my sangria
Blood on my Adidas
Icy like margaritas

[Hook: Butch Dawson]
I might rob a bank
Cause I got a tank
High up in the ranks
I might rob a bank
Cause a nigga broke
But you smoke a lot of stank
What the fuck you think?
I don't give a fuck
Had that nina tuck

[Verse 3: JPEGMAFIA]
Hit the plug
Got a new gun that bitch fat and privileged
Call her Amy Schumer
Iliza Shlesinger when I get the hammer
Bang bang shooting at the shooters
Form it up like clayface
Then I'm swingin' on 'em like Batman
The front door won't open up
We gon' have to hit the back
Sticking up Hilary for her chips
Before I vote for her
Robbing my bank
She said I overdraft too much for her
I whip a tank
5 star GTA
Fuck up off me
Queen Latifah Cheefah
But these pigs ain't set it offing me
Joanne how I scam the courthouse
Judge said I got 30 days in the pen
Told him, "Fuck that, I ain't going back in"
Grab his left wrist, take his watch, then I scram
Robbing niggas, stalling niggas
If the cops come then we dodging niggas
Straight licks fuck a hostage, nigga
I need all that money in my pocket, nigga

[Hook: Butch Dawson]
I might rob a bank
Cause I got a tank
High up in the ranks
I might rob a bank
Cause a nigga broke
But you smoke a lot of stank
What the fuck you think?
I don't give a fuck
Had that nina tuck
Crashed the party up
Put them fingers up
Jerry Springer'd up
And stick the lobby up

"-and they are not responsible citizens. Until they live like we are... we don't want 'em."
"I don't want to live with me, tell you the truth, whether they take care or not I don't wanna live with them cause they ran away from 'em. If I wanted to live with 'em I wouldn't be saying, 'High taxes like [?].' I would wanna stay as I was."
"More than half of whites in our survey believe Negros are more likely than whites to run down their own neighborhoods."
