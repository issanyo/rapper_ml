[Intro]
I don't ask nobody for nothing
I don't beg nobody to do nothing for me
And they say: "why you say that?"
I say: "cause nigga I make money"
I put heads in seats
That's why ain't [beep] fake about me
If you don't like what I do, turn the channel
Watch the fake [beep]

Too much, too much
Put on a show

Put on a show for me

[Verse 1]

Fuck my lease, I just want the (dope)
No family bitch I just got this (dope)
Do not police I'm tryna smoke this (dope)
Darkskin girl baby you're so (dope)
Lightskin girl bitch you ain't that (dope)
All I fucking have is my bitches and my (dope)

[Verse 2]
These pussy niggas on a warpath
Fucking around with JPEG
You'll get six shots to the head
Young nigga shared no tears for the feds
Black Oswalt bitch I came for the head
No tame thoughts I'm a maverick
All these hits I'm an addict (damn)
Communist tactics, youth
Got it backwards niggas too passive
25 years shead a tear for a savage
Loaded AR put the case to a Cactholic
Fuck the lynches
And fuck the system
Nigga white Jesus never did shit for me
Now let's put on a show for these Christians
Voice of the voiceless
Fuck Phil Brooks nigga I run shit
Bare arms on a suspect
Your limbs too short to reach for this gun bitch
Bible and convicts go
Hand to hand like crackers and conflict
Water for chocolate
Compress me a check my passion is profit nigga
Now let's put on a show
You're gonna put on a show for me
