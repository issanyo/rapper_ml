[Intro/ Guitar Solo]
1, 2

[Verse 1]
Oh you ain't got your flag now, nigga what
No badge no gun you is not tuff
Got the Benilli M4 with the big nuts
Toucan Sam whip it like big bruh, pay homage
You are not a guest, you're a hostage
Rap game thirsty, piss same color as Logic
White boys act tough, I don't give no fucks
Heard he acting like Dex, beat his ass till he Russ

[Chorus]
Keep it on the hush
I heard that yo momma, sister, auntie, getting touched
Gat in my lap, catch me surfin stormfront

[Verse 2]
I put the Judge in seat, I send that bitch to the bing
I heard she pray to Allah, nah bitch you praying to me
I do this shit for Kalief, these coppers begging for war
You niggas marching for peace, I make they family weep
Kill em or give em the beats, we point the gun at your seed
Nigga

[Chorus 2]
And Iâ€™m riding in that Bentley coupe bitch
Fuck a Trump and a fucking coon Bitch yea
This is not for no interviews bitch
Or the evening news bitch

[Beat Switch / Outro]
Yeee
Yea
Fucking dry
I'm out of weed
I'm irritable
Fuck all my bands, fuck all my friends
I got the weed, I got the stems
Fuck you I'm paid, baby I'm ___
I got these (Bills!)
I got these (Bills!)
I got these bills!!

[Brad Paisley]
