[Intro]
"You are watching a master at work"

[Hook: Scale Wop]
All I do is count the guap
Bad bitch, panties dropped
Pussy wet, need a mop
Pussy nigga get dropped
Outfit comes from Wop
Whip comes from the lot
Ball hard, never flop
Tryna take it to the top
What I do never stop
(hey)

[Verse 1: Scale Wop]
Kitchen blurry still sippin' dirty
Flick of the wrist, feel like Stephen Curry
Pack of thirty if its necessary
And I'm masked up, feel like Jim Carey
Your bitch gave me brain now I'm feelin' nerdy
Plug hit me, told me hurry
I came quick and he threw me thirty
Told him I got him, you don't gotta worry
Popped a xan I'm in another land
Plus I'm leanin' no kickstand
Money always come in rubber bands
Too busy I can't shake a hand
If you not my mans you not makin' bands
Blue hundas got me feeling French
And I'm skating ramps
Call me elephant
You not talking money it's irrelevant

[Hook: Scale Wop]
All I do is count the guap
Bad bitch, panties dropped
Pussy wet, need a mop
Pussy nigga get dropped
Outfit comes from Wop
Whip comes from the lot
Ball hard, never flop
Tryna take it to the top
What I do never stop
(hey)

[Hook: Scale Wop]
All I do is count the guap
Bad bitch, panties dropped
Pussy wet, need a mop
Pussy nigga get dropped
Outfit comes from Wop
Whip comes from the lot
Ball hard, never flop
Tryna take it to the top
What I do never stop
(hey)

[Verse 2: Freaky]
All I do is count the guap, damn
That's so somethin' you can't knock hmm
Peace out to all my jock
Llama on me that's a must
Damn, already how we rot
Yeah, I ain't with the Drake and Josh
Hmm, middle finger to the cops, yeah
Talk like my jaw loth, yeah
My demeanor is Chris Posh, yeah
One hand catch the pack like Randy Moss
Niger as we put the D like N-E-R-E
Been an OG, been an OG
Been an OG, I've been on my OG
Been on lowkey, been with the piece of young mama
Piece of woadie

[Instrumental Break]
Hey
"You are watching a master at work"

[Refrain]
Love me
Llama
Love me
Llama

"A separate separate Negro compound is out of the question. We all gotta live here in this world. All of us and it is impossible for this world to be seperated. Impossible."
"I think it's horrible. I think it's the worst thing that they can really set up. We askin' for equality!"
"An eye for an eye and a life for a life. From the billions that we see are merely dress rehearsals for the revolution that's to come. We better get ourselves some guns and prepare ourselves!"
