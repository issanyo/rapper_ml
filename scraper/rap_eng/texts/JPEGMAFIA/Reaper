[Verse]
I'm watching
On the sidelines like Robin
I told them let me get the hostage
They told me Batman runs Gotham
Uh God
And I feel no sympathy
For those niggas that got the last laughin'
This is what happens
When everybody directing
And ain't no fucking action
But I don't feel you
Kill have will I'm the new Ice Cube
I'm in your rear view
Sticking up crews for their fake ass jewels
I'm a fiend
I will do anything wrong for the place I rule
You cacs ain't no Jews
And your fake lawns can't replace my fuels
(Beeyatch)
Two marks your heart
Is what I can't pace
Prophecy 101 never give a date
No scripture
We are on ElimiDate
Take your time with it baby
Whipping out the minutemaid
You got a bible
I got a rifle
Who's gonna win at the end of this title?
Please
(Get on your knees bitch)
Stress
Guns
All that shit for fun
Getting killed
