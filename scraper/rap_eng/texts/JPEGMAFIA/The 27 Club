[Intro]
*Bell Chimes*
And we on…

[Chorus]
Welcome to the 27 club
And if I die before I wake yea
At the 27 club
I pray the lord my soul to take
Welcome to the 27 club
And if I die before I wake yea
To the 27…
Say [?] Jimi Hendrix

[Verse]
I'm Jimi Hendrix
Baby I’m Jimi Hendrix
Throw that pussy at me
I’ma take it if you lending
Party hardly
Never talk cop
And my tracks make these white hoes strip
Nigga dead-ass
I love rap but I never buy the music
I just download it for free
Then I talk shit
Rhyming’s easy
Anyone can do it
That’s why I say fuck that new
I want that old shit
I’m all indie baby I love garbage
Sling out wack tracks & pitchfork loves it
Critic-core legend
Certified bitch-made
Asshole niggas
Thinking they got the best taste
At 27 I’ma asphyxiate
On my own bullshit
While I’m looking for a fix
So fuck a black fan..
Crackas make figures
Cuz’ God don’t like ugly and no one likes niggas

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
And If I stunt before I front
I pray the lord just give me what I want
And If I flash before that cash
I pray the lord give me all of that
And if I ain’t rich before 26, well fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club

[Verse 2]
I’m Janis Joplin
I sing like an old time slave
Plus I look twice my age
Live from summertime
An OG vulture
Mother-fuck a spook
I'ma profit off the culture
Real nigga lover
I used to play the backroom
Trouble on my mind
I fuck hippies in the bathroom
Big Momma Thorton
My ball and chain
Bitch I'ma do you like Elvis did
Never get credited
Overdose on sedatives and heroin and medicine
Oppressed white female
I'm a mother-fucking feminist
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me who I'm better than
Bitch you not heaven sent
A thief is all you ever been
On the road to riches
They gon' catch me out my element
But if I play the victim
They gon' treat me like a veteran
Pot kettle rhetoric
Vocal chords need severing
I never had an original bone in my skeleton

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
And If I stunt before I front
I pray the lord just give me what I want
And If I flash before that cash
I pray the lord give me all of that
And if I ain’t rich before 26, well fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club

[Verse 3]
They call me Kurt Kobain
I don't like fame
I strum guitars
I snort cocaine
I am..
One fucked up nigga
The Earth is my bedroom
The sky is mirror
And I look up in that bitch like errrday
Smile to myself and thank God I'm paid
Because I could be like you
A keyboard warrior
Youtube confessin' in the comment section
Dick getting hard off a thumbs up blessing
And when you get ignored
It's like fuck! now I'm stressing
I took the high road
Instead of being the nigga that talks shit
I'd rather be the nigga that walks it
Hop skip and jump
Cuz I'm rich as hell
Stick to the script
Like an actor
But I don't play no roles
I'm hip hops Death Note
And I'm killing off
Every single fucking blog rapper bitch

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
And If I stunt before I front
I pray the lord just give me what I want
And If I flash before that cash
I pray the lord give me all of that
And if I ain’t rich before 26, well fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club
