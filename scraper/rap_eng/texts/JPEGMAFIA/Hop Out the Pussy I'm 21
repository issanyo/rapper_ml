[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
Momma told me I'm too cool to be young
Hop out that pussy I'm 21
Hop out that pussy I'm Jesus
Black savior with a Caesar
I traveled the world with no Visa
Kissin' white ass like Koreans
Young Leonard every season
I'm always on defense
Now hop out that pussy I'm 21
License to kill with a dirty gun
My girl said only I make her cum
Told her ex man the same shit
Playing cards like Gambit
Wolverine claws out in Hampden
Cops come niggas scramblin'
Peggy stand still like a mannequin, nigga

[Verse 2: Freaky]
On wax
It go wiki, wiki, wiki on the track
You can't see me like Houdini
Who he to me?
Do I Dijonay?
Just Sticky like I'm hangin' with Penny Proud
Look at me
Ow, popped out the pussy
23 year old child
Split the Dutch like Moses split the Nile
That was then, this is now
Wet Willy gone digital
Don't ask me how
Actually child, sit your ass down

[Hook: JPEGMAFIA]
Hop out that pussy I'm 21
Hop out that pussy I'm
Hop out that pussy I'm 21, 21
Hop out that, uh
Hop out that pussy I'm 21
Hop out that pussy I'm
Hop out that pussy I'm 21, 21
Hop out that, uh

[Verse 3: JPEGMAFIA]
Bitch, I am not with the fuck shit
I bring the dope to your function
I bring the dope to your momma house
Just to show you I ain’t frontin'
Neptunes with the drum hits
MF DOOM with the sample flips
Peggy should have his own drum kit
Peggy should have his own ooh
I deny my identity like I was Bill Maher
Cause I steal cars and drive across the country looking for niggas to kill off
I'm not the one
I'm just a spark in the Sun and I'm blocking your moonlight
Cause I'm so bright, and I'm so hard, and I'm such a bitch
Niggas scratching for shit while my finger itch
Trigger glitching in the system, The Matrix
I play for Pistons, this a defensive year
Ask about me, I don't care
Ask about me, I ain't there
Snitches are pawns
Make 'em get off of my lawn
Tie 'em up and hit the river at dawn
Make 'em learn every last word to this song
Hop out pussy, that oh shit 21

[Verse 4: Freaky]
Hopped out the pussy I'm 21
Learned how to walk 20 som'
Fresh out of prison I'm 40
I ain't got shit, I ain't worthy
They tryin' retire my jersey
They wanna do the boy dirty
They wanna give me a purpose
They monetize feelin' worthless
They cut me out of the surplus
The fuck did I do to deserve this?
I'm on foreign land and deserted
Run for your lives, you heard me
Run for your life, you heard me
Mobility's life, you heard me
Mobility's life, you heard me
I'm in a foreign institute
I heard the warden drive a coupé
I'm in a fuckin' chicken coop
It's like 10 by fuckin' 2"
Hop out the pussy I'm 21
License to kill with dirty gun

[Outro]
"We hear so much about the slavery. 300 years ago our grandfathers were slaves or 200 years ago our grandfathers were slaves. Oh for god sakes, did we have anything to do with that? I have no part in it. I have no slaves. Are they blaming us for what happened 300 years ago? Let's forget the past! Think of the future, build up the future and why keep hemming and hawing over the same thing over and over and over again and they say, 'You must give me land because my grandfather was a slave!' Well then, I would say, 'For God sakes, find the man who had your grandfather as a slave and then demand the land from him.' Don't bother me because I had no part of it."
