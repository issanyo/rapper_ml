[Intro]
It's real, it's real
(Coughing and mumbling)
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
You see me & you see terror (oh yeah)
I got stripes like a flag bearer
Peggy, Peggy, I'm the new young Mayweather
I'm just trying to take hip-hop out the Drake era
Fuck a mob
Fuck a squad
Fuck your mans and them
You singing ass niggas don't know how to be men
I hit your baby mama
Gave that bitch a new tan
I talk that greasy shit
And hit them with a new dance
Oh my god (oh)
Peggy, Peggy
You're so good
Fuck whoever said you up you up to no good
Cause I'm the man in the street
The man with the beats
And the man holding heat
I drop bombs like I drop science (whoo)
Drop a body off like a dropped client
Drop 6
Drop Top
Drop FaceTime
I give a fuck about peace
I spit hate crimes
Who the fuck you know could kill 'em with these cold lines?
Young Peglord on the mic
Bitch, it's go time
I piss white boys off in my spare time
Tugging at your heart I'm the black Ben Carson
So try me if you really wanna
No seriously (yeah)
Try me if you really wanna
Who the fuck told you Peggy wasn't getting paid?
I square up with a square nigga and catch a fade

[Hook]
Swisher sweet (swisher sweet)
Ain't nobody can fuck with me
Kill the beat (kill the beat)
Backpackers they loving me
Oh my god (god)
OH GOD (oh god)
Huh, huh
Swisher sweet (swisher sweet)
Ain't nobody can fuck with me
Kill the beat (kill the beat)
Backpackers they loving me
Oh my god (god)
OH GOD (oh god)

[Verse 2]
Uh, fuck you coon ass niggas that don't like rap
But you rap
How fucking dumb is that?
Bitch ass niggas be too committed to the act
I know you wanna jock
Imma take you off the atlas
With your Indie ass
And you Metacritic rappers don't get no pass
You got these white girls singing
These white girls singing
But niggas never feel you so you play it like you different
I'm a fucking grave digger
I don't see these boys
You step in my sandbox
You gon' see these toys
You suburban ass niggas need to stay in your place
No snaps, no tweets
This is straight to your face
Fuck 'em
I bring death to any nigga that try to rattle me
You casualties actually factually you ain't as bad as me
Niggas say they charged up
Imma drain your fucking battery
Split your ass in two and you still will never be half of me, Buster!
Fuck your mob
Fuck your squad
Fuck your mans and them
You indie niggas just wanna be black men
I've been real all my life
You're like MC Ride
Two crackers call your album "nigga" and you let that slide, pussy
Get the fuck out of my genre, my genre
Get the fuck out of my genre, my genre
Rich kids trying to go urban no shaman
But this a new era
I took hip-hop hostage, fucker

[Bridge]
Life is like a box of chocolate
Life is like a box of chocolate girls
(mumbling)
Life is like a box of chocolate girls
I don't want you in my world
But these people
Fucking other niggas bitches
Let the bass hit 'em
Fuck it, imma split 'em
Kill a nigga for the ribbons
Yeah, uh

[Verse 3]
I don't get mad
I get rich
I don't get sad
I get tips
I'm not a waitress
I'm not a waiter
I don't
Confer
I just
Counter, counter, counter
Counter attack
Bitch I know you, know you, know you
Know you wanna react
But you can't, but you can't, but you can't
You can't
You gon' dance, you gon' dance, you gon' dance
You dance
I hear your Hotline Blinging
Got a whole generation of pussy niggas singing
Niggas don't even know what they want no more
No
