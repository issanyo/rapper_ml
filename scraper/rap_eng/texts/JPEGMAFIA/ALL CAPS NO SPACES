[Verse 1]
Money talks
Niggas walk
Young Reagan
I'll be damned if I take a loss
I cut it up
I ship it off
Young vet
I triple debt
I'm never wrong
Bitch nigga
I'm the bad man, the bad man
Made a mil' from the acting, the acting
Where the stacks?
I put crack on spreadsheets
I wish a bitch nigga would try forgetting me
I said I'm JPEGMAFIA all caps no spaces
You coons be catching feelings
My niggas catch cases
I open hand
Slap a closed-minded nigga, face in
Wish a nigga wood like a tree at the base end
Root for the home team
Ran for the bases
Niggas wanna be white
Go and get a face-lift
You don't dapwell, we can't chill
Yo, Das Racist
Rapping is my hobby
I am not an artist
I'm a ghost in a black body
Roll deep, white Caddy with a black shotty
Looking for that bitch nigga Hopsin in the lobby
Like damn..
Shout out to the 'burbs
And all my niggas spitting fast to hide they shitty words, yo
One thing on my mind I can't figure?
Is why every rapper shady influence is a bitch nigga
Fucker
(yeah, any of you bitch ass trust fund kids come fucking near me y'all niggas dead..
Fuck outta here)

[Refrain]
Trust fund kids don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight (fuck nigga)

[Hook 1]
Oh shit, bitch it's lit!
Got a four-fifth
Aim it your head
Make an emo nigga slit his fucking wrists
I'm the man
And I got Stans
Fuck Eminem
I put that on the Quaran
Pussy nigga ran
Pussy nigga ran
Imma get your momma hit
Make you understand
Post it on the gram
I'm the new Cam
Crackers want beef?
I don't even like Spam
Damn

[Refrain]
Trust fund kids don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight (fucker)
Trust fund kids don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight (lil' nigga)

[Hook 2]
Heard you like Pantera
Bitch, not me!
Heard you like Burzum
Bitch, not me!
Heard you bumpin' Rolling Stones
Pussy nigga, please!
You play that shit around me
Imma put your ass to sleep
You fuckin fucking creep
I'm neo-nazi chic
Got guns under arms
And I'm aiming at elites
I heard you fucking metalheads looking for some beats
I wish Varg would
Come to B'more we gon' see
Fucker
(fuck outta here man
You talk shit you gonna get your fucking head cracked open pussy
Fuck outta here)

[Refrain]
Trust fund kids don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight (fuck nigga)

[Outro]
"I ain't never heard something..
So..
Yo..
What the fuck was that shit you just played for me, yo..
Nah, for real, what the fuck was that shit, nah..
I ain't wanna hear that shit again I gotta, yo what..
That shit went so hard..
Yo..

I'm on planet mafia and shit..
Shit ridiculous in these headphones..
Ri-DICULOUS in these headphones"
