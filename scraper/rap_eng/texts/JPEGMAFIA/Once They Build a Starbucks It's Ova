Any left-wing motherfucker
Trying to be your friend is enemy
Don't believe in his frenemy tactics
These niggas do backflips
To get a pat on the head
You step me and you're dead
Get your liberal ass kicked
Same bitch memorized every Chief Keef verse
Same one to call the cops
Think you wanna steal her purse
It hurts to say this
Niggas think they doing favors
But these hipster motherfuckers wanna steal all our creations
And claim credit for 'em
Rewrite history:
Chuck Berry to Elvis
Make our shit a mystery
Rock, blues, techno, soul, jazz, and r&b
What do they have in common?
Niggas started it
Now we barely have a part in it
(Ain't nothing out there for us)
(What chu wanna be when you grow up?)
Now some kids wanna be a fireman, a doctor, a rapper, a ballplayer
Even a fucking dogwatcher
Go to the NFL, be a teacher, or a chemist
Make an app for iPhones and get paid for your inventions
But think real hard
Think one long minute
I never heard one kid say they wanna be a critic
(You're all experts your stealing...)
See that's every single hipsters back-up plan
They fail at everything else
They need some back-up man
They spend all their parents money
All their trust-fund cash and flunk out
And these the people that ya'll let run rap
God damn
(God damn)
See these 90s babies scared to talk shit
So if I got to be that nigga, Imma be that nigga
Call you out
Grimes vinyl in a bear trap
Imma draw you out
Take you in the back of an alley somewhere
And maul you out
Then hop up in my whip until you gentrify this dick
You hipster bitch
