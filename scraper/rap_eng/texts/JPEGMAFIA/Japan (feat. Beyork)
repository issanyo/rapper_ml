[Intro]
Mhmm
Pay me nigga
Be yourself
JPEGMAFIA
And I come up in the chorus like
([?])
And then I'm coming in the thang like
Yeah
It's real shit nigga

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm going back to Osaka without a Father
I'm a bastard without a battery in my Acura
Yeah
Take my time
I'm going back to Osaka without a Father
I'm a bastard without a battery in my Acura
I'm stranded
Branded as nigga is my doom to my tome
I dad two strikes up out the womb
Too many MCs and not enough letter Gs
Bungee-cording to the rap game like it's their destiny
And I'm no Angel
Ain't got no halo around my feelers
If I could torrent cars I'd have twenty 2-seaters
I'm like War Machine's wife to your fucking wife-beater
With a bunch of rhymes in Adobe Reader bitch
I've been all around the world seen some fucked up shit
Seen a Zionist-Pious jump on Allah's dick
I hope you niggas find Allah quick
So you can tweet that black power shit
Playing with a Zionist
I'm Jay Electronica piloting this pirate ship
Jamaican Pirates of the Carribean
Man I feel like Gilligan
Switching from the light to the dark on the fly
I'm reverse Aunt Vivian
And my thoughts stronger than [?]
So if I die [?]

[Hook]
Finding me out in Japan (x9)

[Verse 2]
And I rather die like a man
Than be crucified to the palms of a bitch hand
These trust-fund kids would rather rap about animators
Spit some real fucking shit for their fellow man
And I lived there
So I'll be the first to tell you
The yellow man ain't fucking with your black ass
Get your mind out the gutter nigga
Take a hint
Take a charge
Fuck a beef
Man we brothers nigga
Cut from the same mother nigga
When the cops pull you over
They shoot you not them other niggas
And I'd take a hit for any of my niggas
That's more than I can say for anybody in Japan
Go figure
Man your records gonna sit on the shelf
They hate you like America and everybody else
Through all my travels
I've been with nerds
Been with killers
And the only one constant is nobody likes niggas
Through all my travels
I've been with nerds
Been with killers
And the only one constant is nobody likes niggas
Through all my travels
I've been with nerds
Been with killers
And the only one constant is nobody likes you nigga
