[Intro]
Yesterday I thought I was having a heart attack
Panic attack
Made a wack beat yesterday
I get ideas in my
I keep smoking weed
And I masturbate constantly

[Verse 1]
Keep hustling, keep moving
I'm a nuisance, I'm useless
We fucked, this hurts

[Chorus]
I'm a nuisance
DOA to the base
Face wet, legs shake
Grab my chest, feeling faint
These symptoms, can't help them
Where my health went
This hurts

[Break]
Crackers keep calling me Aces
I put the spade on hook
All of you yuppies is pussy
You ain't never hit a jugg
Ain't no money on your books
I put Lemmy in the grave
I push the golden gun up on ya braids
Pew! Fade

[Verse 2]
And I'm getting cash you ain't never there, oooh, yeah
Oh, you fucking mad, 'cause I'm counting swag, oooh, yeah
Nigga, you’s a bitch, you’s a fucking hoe, oooh, yeah
I can’t tell you
Pull up on 'em with the stick talk
Nigga you ain’t bout that brick talk
Fuck with me you get shot (Shoo, shoo)
I am a thot
Fuck it, I am a opp
Wrist cut, wrist cut, wrist cut
Grey death on the block

[Outro]
It's really just a panic attack
