[Intro]
I used to be into dope
Now I'm into racism

[Verse 1]
Straight killer bruh
I know what you're feeling bruh
People say I'm prejudice
I say that's what a villain does
Yeah take me back
All my niggas starting up
5 39s don't startle us
Pardon us we got too much
Everywhere we go we got a crew cut
Coon-ass niggas low-key down with the GOP
Bitch-ass crackers wanna be down with prophet
Barry got the key let the master unlock it
Lock-picking no wishlisting
Started from the bible now it's fuck Christians
No DEVOs just New Editions
Fuck Clapton his soul's missing
I know it must be heartbreaking stealing from spooks
But you a good damn vulture so you ain't got no culture nigga

[Bridge]
Get the foreigners out
Get the wogs out
Get the coons out
Keep Britain white
I used to be into dope nigga now I'm into racism
It's much heavier man
Fucking wogs man
Fucking Saudis taking over London
(Come again)
Eric Clapton 1974 ya'll hero

[Verse 2]
I've been getting treated for a chronic lack of fucks
Man these pussy ass cops always tryin' lock me up
Talking 'bout "I'm oppressed"
Man these cacs don't know what oppressed is
We getting shot in the street
They just gotta hear about the death
But you know fo sho
And that's just how it goes
We make all the hits, labels they take all the gold
Slap my girl with a kiss
Tell my daddy I'll be rich
Mom I'm sorry for this shit
But I can't always stay your kid
Pack my bags
Take two steps in the grass
Out my house oh yeah
I'm the man
Got my cash and a plan
To get rich off this land
Watch where you live, baby watch where you stand
I won't be no bitch cause Uncle Sam will lose his mind
To see this little nigga rich man
