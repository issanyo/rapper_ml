[Verse 1]
I'm mad as shit
Call me the black Katniss
Storming from distract triple 6
On the road i go
With flames in my tits
You already know
I'm the creator
The dictator
The destroyer
When i bleed you bleed
What i speak is belief
When i scream you queef
Baby just look at me
Don't you fucking see?
Look into my eyes
Don't you see the sunrise
1, 2, 3
333
Fuck I'm so holy HA!

[Chorus]
I'm alive don't be surprised (x 5)
I want ever die
Until I'm humanized

[Verse 2]
Imma real strong mother fucka
Coming thru u like no other
I woke up
And realized I have a face
I'm coming with that di di di di da
You can't ever take me down
I'm Mike Tyson with a limp wrist
I'm Angela Davis with a long dick
I'm that sin you can't resist
I exist when it rains like this
Fuck your text books
I'm realer than a white crook

[Chorus]
I'm alive don't be surprised (x 5)
I want ever die
Until I'm humanized

[Bridge]
I told these niggas don't fuck with me
So I gotta give them the pedagogy (x3)
Pedagogy of me
