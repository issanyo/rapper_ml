Welcome to New York this the b-side
Leave a blank space in your fucking ride
Generation Y 1989
Everybody got a style but this one is mine (bam!)
I'm the anti-Nickelback
How I come up out the woods with the starter pack
You going out of bounds like GTA
Probably would've lived all you had to do was stay (bang!)
I shake it off cut losses
Wish a n*** would throw rocks at the prophet
03 bad blood bitch this a burial
Cannabis in your stereo breaking the walls of Jericho
Cut scenes in your wildest dreams to show you how to get the girl but I rather get the cream
Is it love that you feel when you fiend
I know places where Haitians will take you out clean off the scene
