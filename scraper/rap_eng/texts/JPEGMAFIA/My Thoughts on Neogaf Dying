[Chorus]
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

[Verse]
(Let's get it!)
I don’t care about the cars
I don’t care about your flash
I don’t care about your phone
I don’t...
I don’t care about the beats
I don’t care about your plays
I don’t care about the bass
I don’t care
(Ride em' cowboy, nigga!)
I don’t care about your bank (Okay!)
I don’t care about your fees
Give a fuck 'bout your degrees
I don’t care
I don’t care
Give a fuck about your life
I don’t care
(That's what we like to call big damage, nigga!)

[Chorus]
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
(I don't give a fuck about it...)
(Mad now, I get around to)
I don't care
*cough* (One, two)
