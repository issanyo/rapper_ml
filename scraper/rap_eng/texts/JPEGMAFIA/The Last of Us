[Verse]
Punks jump up and get they ass kicked
America done turned me to a bastard
40 acres and a mule I got a bad hand
So I keep the smoke for escape like I'm Batman
Queens [?] syndicate in the motherland
Raping her for resources niggas got me fucked up
Don't let them fool you
Over hills and valleys don't believe for a minute that these chimps won't screw you
Free [?] 2014 I learned that dark skin is [?] crackers might shoot you
Scouts wanna recruit you, spics wanna replace you
The world going to war nigga, everybody hates you
Talk about the struggle some cracker wanna debate you
Talk about the hustle, some fake jew wanna pay you
2015 I hope you niggas get away dude
Cause everyone in Israel's a motherfucking fake [?]
I speak softly on the matters of trust
Cause I don't want my kids in similar situations growing up
I treat you like my daughters and this is the last of us
I passed the knife to Ellie, tell the truth these clippers like some niggas
