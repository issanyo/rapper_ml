[Verse: Dyyo Faccina]
Can't keep my dick in my pants
So fucked up I just spilled my drink on my manz
I'm throwin up pourin up more
I roll up a stoge
And I don't give a fuck bout your stance

People only see the surface
Peace can be your purpose
Peep the potency of me it's perfect
Fuck with me its worth it

And If you do
You can get residuals
All you individuals is pitiful
You'll never be original

Your the typical type
You stuck on your digital hype
Ain't shit without political ties
If you ask me
You got wack beats and despicable rhymes
Worthless

Im the vaccine for your medical purpose
Fuck with me and its worth it
Im a lyrical circus
While Your shit is as boring
As episcopal church's

Ain't no need to be nervous
I got the heat in the furnace

*Real trap shit*
