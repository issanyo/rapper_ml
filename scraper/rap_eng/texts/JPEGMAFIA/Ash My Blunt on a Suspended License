[Intro]
"Japanese news clip"

(GET READY TO KICK BUTT!)

[Chorus]
(FIRST ATTACK)
Ash the Blunt on a suspended license
Counting votes while I soak in the silence
Ash the blunt on your dead daddy tombstone
Oh my God fuck a squad on my vlone

[Verse]
Ash the blunt on a fuck nigga tombstone
I been out for that mouth like a group
So sincere I don't hear all that bullshit
Station north niggas stay mad cuz I pull they cards
On some hood shit
Never bite always barks fucking lapdogs
I been here for 1 year and I lapped y'all
Shows make no bands shows but no fans boi
WTF bruh?
I be moving round the city with my bruh bruh
Have u rolling round the city like your brother
(KO)

[Chorus]
Ash the Blunt on a suspended license
OMG fuck a squad I don't like them

[Instrumental Break]
(It Cuts)
(YOU LOSE)

"Inaudible mumbling"
"Violent Screams"
(Your not brave...Men are Brave)
(NO BOURBON)

[Chorus]

Ash the Blunt on fuck nigga license (GREAT JOB)
Counting votes while I soak in the silence
Ash the blunt on your dead daddy tombstone
Oh my God fuck a squad on my vlone

[Outro]
(AIR COMBO)
"Calm music plays"
