[Intro]
Here’s a lil story bout a kid from the swampy
Laurens and Division bred
Got it tatted on me
Raised by my auntie
Mommy they got me
But it’s nothing like the love coming from the blocky

[Chorus]
I don’t feel nobody
I don’t feel nobody
I’m like who are you?
I don’t know yo like Gotti
I don’t feel nobody
I do this shit for ollie
The world wanna stop me
I don’t feel nobody

[Verse 1]
Call me white killer to the max
For the shine Ima go black
Black out in the projects
Black out with the Rolex
Tap out, Cobra clutch neck
Pass out, take the cash out
Then I jet
Trap house I ain’t assed out
Not yet
Hands down I’m the man now with a check
Touchdown up in sand town with a tec
Pop off nigga got heart like Bret
Drippin hot sauce on a cop car
I bet
Not y’all or your top dog could wreck
When I got swamp in the pores of my sweat
Father Ima sinner to the rest
I'ma monster
I'ma starter
Nonetheless
If you thought of who could bother with the best
You’ll get slaughtered
Cut ya noggin from ya neck

[Bridge]
All I see is green
I spot money on my fiends
What you mean?
Who in every scene?
Posing in a zine
Coming clean trouble on my mind
Butchy on the rise
You see blood sweat tears trapped in a nigga eyes

[Chorus]
I don’t feel nobody
I don’t feel nobody
I’m like who are you?
I don’t know yo like Gotti
I don’t feel nobody
I do this shit for ollie
The world wanna stop me
I don’t feel nobody
I don’t feel nobody
I don’t feel nobody
I’m like who are you?
I don’t know yo like Gotti
I don’t feel nobody
I do this shit for ollie
The world wanna stop me
I don’t feel nobody

[Verse 2]
325 for the pants
Cops never give me a chance
I’m giving niggas the hands
I be ahead of the plan
She give me head in a van
Made her my number one fan
Winning I’m doing my dance
I am too humble to rant
But when I get off on a track
I ran that shit like a track
Fuckin that bih with the tracks
Ima go dumb on dumb on the track
Sleeping on me that’s a nap
Call me white killer to the max
For the shine Ima go black
Black out in the projects
Black out with the Rolex
