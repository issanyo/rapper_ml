[Intro]
You come out to show them
Like, open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood
Come out to show them

[Bridge]
Yeah...yeah...uh...
(Gangstas [?])
I'm in the [?], acting [?] is my meal of choice
(All around)
(All right)
Till Polly came around
(Polly)
Took it all from me
(Polly)
Damn Polly
Fuck you Polly
(Polly)
And I stay with her

[Verse 1]
Hit like the Flint god damn
(Polly)
You know who the fuck I am
(Hello)
I'm a cowboy nigga with my finger on the trigger and I don't give a fuck about the man
(Bullshit)
(Polly) gon' ride with pig in a heartbeat
Hop up out the whip with the shit
Pussy ass (Polly) want war with the wick
I'm gonna come with the motherfucking clip
And a (Polly) wanna do me favor?
Kill a cop
Kill a bird, kill your fucking neighbor
I want blood, it doesn't matter the fucking flavor
Act up you'll end up in the fucking paper
Front page with a real nice taper
Taking over the globe with a bottle of something (gnarly)
Fuck out of my face with that buttermilk Jesus bitch ass bullshit you be preaching
(Polly)

[Chorus]
[?] will cry
[?] will cry
[?] will cry
On my feet
[?] will cry
[?] will cry

[Verse 2]
Straight from Jamaica, here come the raider
(Polly) want a piece of the land he invaded
I never found the right girl in nightstands
And never in my life worked for a fucking (white man)
Straight up this ain't your country
You are hostages
Kill your invaders
I don't give two shits about crime
Barbecue confederate flags over spare time
Two Glocks one [?] for a fifth
Put it to the neck of every governor in office
Fuck your democracy this a tec-nocracy
One (*whistle*) will have you on the ground I'm a monster beast
So don't get speed dialed
And motherfuck these trust fund kids that think rap started with 8 Mile
Met Rip the Jacker
Gun to your mouth cac (Polly) born cracker
Nah (Polly) want some backup admitted it
(Polly) want to put me in the ground
And push me out of the culture and claimed he invented it
(Polly) probably want a (bigger dick)
(Polly) scared cause the scares been getting into this nigga shit
(Polly) really doesn't know what a victim is
(Polly) top of the world but he still be playing that victim shit
And (Polly) don't care
(Polly) wanna chill, wanna hang, wanna stare
(Polly) thinks racism is some kind of fucking girl scout badge that he never gets to wear
(Polly) colonized half the fucking world
(Polly) gets mad when you banging out his girl
(Polly) he brave as fuck on the Reddit but (Polly) would never step to my face with that bullshit
(Polly)

[Chorus]
[?] will cry
[?] will cry
[?] will cry
On my feet
[?] will cry
[?] will cry

[Outro]
JPEG
(Sundown all around)
Because I like JPEGs
(Walking through the summer's end
Waves crash baby, don't look back
I won't walk away again)
