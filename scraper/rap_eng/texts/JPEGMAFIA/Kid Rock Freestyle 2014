[Opening Sample / JPEGMAFIA]
We all know exactly who I am
Only in L.A. (Yeah)
Who the hell are you?

[Verse 1:]
Stick up kid on a rooftop
I scope a dead man while he still breathe (Naw Bitch)
No tax on it, it's a flat rate
Flatline and get (future get the fucking duct tape)
I'm the anti-Slim Shady
White Trash in my yard, get the gat, Baby
You get popped on the curb, feel the fire
While I deny my identity, Bitch, I'm Bill Myer
Bloody mask and a gold ring
Choke a politician out, it's a Black thing

[Very Short "Instrumental" Interlude]

[Verse 2:]
Niggas yelling action but I'm not actin'
Rednecks hanging from a tree while I'm laughin'
Say my name
Indistinguishable vocal sample
Niggas know I'm too hot to handle
Hit the drive-by on the Hollywood sign
Straight dumpin' out the roof screaming "Fuck Lee Daniels"

[Hook:]
Keep thinkin' they your friends
Keep thinkin' they your friends
Keep thinkin' they your friends, nigga (x3)

[Verse 3:]
I don't wanna be a star
I just wanna grip a 5th, shoot a cop car
Kid Rock called, said he was a rockstar
The check ran out, he ain't Black anymore
Fake Cracker from Detroit talkin' stupid
I got a full clip for that diet Ted Nugent
White Trash Icon, Wigga-fied pussy
Put yo head on a stick, fuck nigga don't push me
Strapped to the T, guns in the air
I hope you shoot well 'cause bitch, I ain't a deer
Wiggas talk shit 'til the shit gets real
This ain't a diss, White boy, you gettin' killed
You was in the house, Cracker, I was in the field
I got a sixth sense, smell a Trust Fund Kid like a meal
So fuck Lynyrd Skynyrd, fuck your flag and [?]
Watch your mouth or I'll send your pussy ass up to Cracker Heaven (Bitch, BITCH)

[Hook:]
Keep thinkin' they your friends
Keep thinkin' they your friends
Keep thinkin' they your friends, nigga (x3)
