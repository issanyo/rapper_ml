[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
Bitch you know I got a lotta motherfucking money in my pocket and I'm goin in
Sick sicka, take a sip of liquor
Niggas wanna fight me I don't get the swishers
Sicker than your average nigga, I'm a boss bitch
Catch the opposition with the rocket or the cross bitch
Ready to catch a loss bitch, I don't give a fuck ho
Cracker think he gnarly? Nigga imma - (coughs)
But no matter where you go I gotta million things I can do to you pussys
Body after body I been catching all the rookies
I'm a gangsta nigga I tax that ??? (shit, fuck)
Passport
Mississippi burning I'm itching to get yo ass caught
Bomb in yo Jansports
Spirits taking over me
Open up my eyes and suddenly you overseas
Guess those vines were for me
I like those chickens you grind them for me
Everybody wanna play Mayan for me
But I like those bitches you find them for me
Niggas thinking every ball figures in the gray
But everywhere you go I got a million on yo block nigga
Never on my knees for the cross or the rock
Cause I don't play nice with the pops
Motherfuck the cops
[Outro 1: Sample]
You people in New York City
You better listen up
Cause you're living in the historical land
Ellis Island
The Empire State Building
The World Trade Center
When you live in a place, you have a habit to take it all for granted
Well don't take your city for granted anymore
Go out and see your sights
Cause JPEGMAFIA is comin to your town boys
And the sights ain't gonna be there anymore!
I'm gonna send your city crumbling down!
[Outro 2: Sample]
Do you like hip hop?
