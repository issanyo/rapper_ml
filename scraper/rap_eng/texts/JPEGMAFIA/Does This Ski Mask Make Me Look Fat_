[Intro]
I've named this one JPEG

[Chorus: JPEGMAFIA]
Uh, no debit, I want credit, these dudes actors
Straight jackers, never learned to be a rapper, kill masters
Ice white like Casper, all these pussy niggas passive
JPEG presentation

[Break: JPEGMAFIA]
Garçon, Garçon, Garçon, Garçon
Does this ski mask make me look fat?

[Pre-Verse: JPEGMAFIA]
And I'm fresh out the bag, on my life, yeah
Nigga, go on bust a sag, on my life

[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
Uh, my homie told me, "Kick that Super Saiyan as long as it can cell"
25 packs on the real, I feel like another spoke on the wheel
Two kills, one shot, the crack rock hit your face like Botox
I won't stop you on 4chan, bitch, I got the fo' cocked
And when I pull it you gonna call cops, hoe stop
I'm on the coast now, niggas playing with the Peg, no sound
Rappers coming at me smoking on that PCP
Fuck around and end up on Smack DVD
I wonder if my momma ever seen me cheese
Nigga, I been wild ever since I passed my CDCs, 25 cities in a row
I'm switching up the coast, give my ego some hope, I tell 'em

[Chorus: JPEGMAFIA]
No debit, I want credit, these dudes actors
Straight jackers, never learned to be a rapper
I kill masters, bringing math to disasters
Toe-tagging, ice white like Casper
Flow tragic, you should pick another tactic
I'm so ratchet, all these pussy niggas passive
I'm too graphic, more blunt ashes
Nigga, fuck your fabric, you average

[Verse 2: Heno.]
All the pain and suffering was temporary
Nowadays, I swear that they was never ready
For me coming from nothing to get it varied
Determined to prove that I would be legendary (sheesh)
I only got one life to live, yeah
But I'm gonna do whatever's necessary
Until I'm dead and buried up in the cemetery
All that other shit is secondary to me
I put that on my life, that's word to my momma
That's why I grind and I serve for them commas
Because that's what it's like being birthed from the bottom, ayy
I know you heard that I'm poppin', ayy
Came from the dirt now I got it, ooh
No way on Earth that I'm stopping, no
Quit trying to ride on my wave, yeah, like I'ma surf in the tropics

[Chorus: JPEGMAFIA]
No debit, I want credit, these dudes actors
Straight jackers, never learned to be a rapper
I kill masters, bringing math to disasters
Toe-tagging, ice white like Casper
Flow tragic, you should pick another tactic
I'm so ratchet, all these pussy niggas passive
I'm too graphic, more blunt ashes
Nigga, fuck your fabric, you average

[Outro: Heno]
Fuck your fabric, you average, fuck all your fabric, you average
All of these niggas is passive, they pussy, they better pick tactics
Learn to be rappers, I swear these dudes is some actors
Pussies is passive, niggas is passive Ha-ha
