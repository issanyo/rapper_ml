[Verse 1]
5 am, friday morning
Thursday night, far from sleep
I'm still up and driving
Can't go home obviously
So I'll just change direction
Cause they'll soon know where I live
And I wanna live
Got a full tank and some chips

[Chorus]
It was me and a gun
And a man on my back
And I sang "holy holy"
As he buttoned down his pants

[Verse 2]
You can laugh, it's kind of funny
Things you think at times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
