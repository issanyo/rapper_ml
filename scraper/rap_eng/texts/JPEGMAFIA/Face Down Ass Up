[Intro]

[Verse: JPEGMAFIA]
Face down, ass up, boy I'm on a roll
Put that pussy on the ground like I'm out control
Motherfucker had your bitch you know I got the ratchet
I don't follow rules I follow clues like an assassin
Everybody knows that Peggy Peggy is a bastard
My momma hate rappers
My daddy need his [?]
That's why I'm in the street
I'm in the hood, I'm in demand
Glock in my hand
And fuck Donald Trump I'm a grown ass man
Black hands, black gloves
Colt .45 with a black snub
My girl can't pay rent cuz
So I'mma hold yo block, that's black love
Nigga

[Verse 4: Freaky]
Begging for the crumbs that fall from the man's table
Integrating to the house of my former slave owner
That ain't all faced on 'em dollar bills
I'mma catch you by the collar, Bill
I can serve white rocks straight collard greens
Just to pay off Blue Collar bills
[?]
I'mma show you how it feels
Cotton turned into
Now I know how Gaddafi felt
[?]
[?]
Ship it ugly
Que es eso?
What I got in this blunt? Taste like tres leche
It's a movie in the making
Truly it's a safe haven, not safe from Satan
Long beard [?]
But the cops around, I can taste the bacon
[?]
No names and no faces
I'm the type that throw feces
