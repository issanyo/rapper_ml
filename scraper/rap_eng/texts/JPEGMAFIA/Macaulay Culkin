[Verse]
I got my hands on my face like Macaulay Culkin
Gave her the cig, but I let the smoke in
And it’s the same dude
Black pants, brown boots, chest open
I traveled down the road and back again
My girls golden
Black man, white fam
I feel like Jason Jordan
I play my albums front to back and make it feel important
Apply compression when I spit so it don’t get distorted
Piper Chap
With the strap
Fuck the talk
Get the warden
I think I'm Rick and Morty
In the lab I take precaution
Snipe 'em out
Burn the body
Stash the Glock
Buy the coffin (Nasty)
Just for me
Yo style is my custody
Man I should charge a shipping fee
These rappers don't mean shit to me
2 guns, Mulder and Scully, I'm solving mysteries
Feminist, pistol whip your wife first, that's chivalry
Sounding like my minimes
But you ain't got the heart to do these evil deeds
Debra pack
Turn Stone Cold into Simple Steve
Where it at
Slap a nigga up
Then I get the cream
5 buck, 6 cookies
Sounding like a deal to me
Yo shit don't appeal to me
My fans going heel for me
Gots to keep it real for me
Shouldn't even be on no bills with me
These punk niggas be killing me
That wack shit ain't trill to me
Fuck y'all niggas, I take the heat
Don shit
