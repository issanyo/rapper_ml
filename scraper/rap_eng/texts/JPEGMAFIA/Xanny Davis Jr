[Intro: JPEGMAFIA]
Two xans, two xans
Look at all these xans, all two of 'em
Two xans (wow)
Three xans, messy

[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
Fuck out my lane
Driving these vultures the fuck out the game
The fuck is he saying?
I got a million special moves
That I call upon like the Pok√©mon game
That's fucking bat shit
Sleeping with so many lies in my mattress
Getting head like Petraeus
Not getting caught like Hernandez
Then I go to court in my pajamas
I might take a MARC train to my lawyer's house
So I can in get in her panties
She hop out the bed
I pull out my meds
And told her I'm voting for Sanchez
I mean Pedro, I'm a bastard
For them pesos get yo' ass kicked
Hop out the bed and turn my swag on, pimpin'
U got a lot to say but you ain't really saying shit like Ashlee Simpson
I stomp on every Kirk Franklin track that I come across
Just to get my point across
That's a line you never cross
I was in them project halls while you was in a fucking loft
My passion for Christ became a passion for MIDI's and DAW's
Reasons for regrets and loss
Fruity niggas acting soft
Hit 'em with that 808 boom
Take your high end off
Jesus was a carpenter
Malcolm was a boss, Ghandi was a pussy
He'll catch a bullet like Randy Moss
Word to my niggas in Pike County
I'm going off

[Refrain]
"Oooh aahhh the coppers in the attic"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Freaky]
If it don't come to me
Dont force it
If it ain't it write itself
He ain't wrote it
If it weren't for the drugs
He'd lose focus
Lately I been feelin' like I am not a rapper
Being behind this mic ain't makin' shit happen
Tryna get to the root of my words
Fuck Greek or Latin
I ain't got shit to say
Like Charlie Chaplin
Clutching the only dollar in my pocket
Tryna not rob some fuckin' body
Wake up nauseated
Cause I been going to sleep hungry
Only thing I own is a pile of fuckin' undies
They tryna pull the rug from under me
Old me askin' questions bout the younger me
Like, "Why's he rappin'?"
XYZ plannin'
That's why they ran in
It's never random
The shorty keeps his pants on
All's I need is a dag gon' slice to land on
I don't need a fake patoi
At the end of the movie like ha, ha
Off in the sunset I go
Like can I kick it
Thai bow
What type bull shit you on?
It's Freaky

[Refrain]
"Oooh aahhh the coppers in the attic"

[Outro]
I KNOW

"Some black militants are urging to go build their own separate politics and economics on black pride and black power within the black community. As for white America-"
"We must start to turn our backs on this country."
