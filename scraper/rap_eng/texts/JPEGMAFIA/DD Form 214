[Intro: Bobbi Rush]
Say it baby
Say it baby
You know it baby
Show it baby
Slower baby

[Bridge: Bobbi Rush]
Call me
Call me
When you get lonely
Darlin' you don't have to worry
I'll be there
Be there in a hurry
Say it!
Say it and I got you
No need to worry
Oooooo

Mmmmmm
Mmmmmmm
I don't
I get so lonely
I can't let just anybody hold me

[Chorus: Bobbi Rush]
You are the one
That lives in me
My dear
I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one but you

[Verse: JPEGMAFIA]
I'm doing favors for petty pay
Run through the track like I'm Cirque du Soleil
All of this pain that I feel inside
Baby's you'd got to be shitting me
Sicker than all of your sickest shit
Flipping your heart like I'm flipping bricks
Niggas be talking that triple shit
Like triple six, don't exist
I am more Hades than Heracles
Baggin these bitches, I'm Birkin, b
You think your ____ is hurting me
Homie come back when u get to my rank
Call me young Peggy the skank
I get the Ratchet and Clank
I whip yo ass like Sasha Banks
I whip dat ass like I'm Bruce Wayne with the cape nigga
I can’t be sullied and ain’t a damn thing changed on em
I won’t be bullied (Girls you know what I mean)
Y'all know what the fuck I mean

[Chorus 2: Bobbi Rush]
You know just how it goes so long
Jus so your own you know it
I'm giving u water
Baby I'm a veteran
Baby I'm a veteran
Baby I'm a veteran
There's no need to question
There's no second guessing
Baby I'm a veteran
Baby I'm a veteran
