Really Wanna walk with ya x7

Ha.. Ha.. Ha.. Ha..

I really wanna walk with ya x2
Wanna talk with ya..
I really wanna walk with ya x2
Maybe spark with ya..
Maybe lil talk with ya..
Mostly wanna talk with ya..

Fasho..

This is something new
This somethings for you
Ain't no lying when im sliding thru
I defy the truth
Then get high and shoot
High as shit
My incline is frightening
Time and time again I vitalize environments for my events
Im spiraling
Lost control
My life as nihilist
Enlightenments impossible entitlement has got your soul
As my thoughts become audible
I become unstoppable
Life is just an obstacle
Your existence is volatile


You gotta let me know if your with it or not
Its limited stock, my nigga
Get the shit while is hot
The netflix pressed quick when she get to the spot
She gets dick exits what a typical plot
Oh
I get hot like piss in a pot and
Oh
I get lit like a digital clock
And got damn im like a lyrical god
My heads spinning while im riddled with ridiculous thoughts

Fuck the maliciousness
Im the antithesis
And Im shifting ambivalence to ambitiousness
And im turning Leviticus into incubus
And im using my skillfulness as my instrument
Intuition is limitless
Stimulus so ubiquitous
Its all synthesis
Im so meticulous When it comes to this written shit

And when im lost i miss this
If its walking distance
Imma walk the distance
Don't forget it baby

[Hook]
People only see the surface
If you want something deeper fuck with me
People only see the surface
But peace can really be your purpose
People only see the surface
If you want to fuck with me its worth it
People only see the surface
But peace can really be your purpose

If it was walking distance i would have walked the distance in an instant and in this instance i might be distant if only for an instant so if you miss this then play the song back for a real nigga

If it was walking distance i would have walked the distance in an instant and in this instance i might be distant so if you miss this replay the song and walk with a nigga
