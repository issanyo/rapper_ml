[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah, it's the embassy
Sing-Sing Regime, understand, yeah

[La the Darkman]
Darkman's driving in the cockpit, spitting hot shit
Niggas better move when the Glock spit
Ever since a teenager, I had flavor
B.M.W., new sneakers and a sky pager
Aim my gun like a lazer, and when I squeeze
Better hope that Jesus gonna save ya
Focus on my pocket sweller, one time felon
Took, every case to trial, my niggas ain't telling
I'm on the phone, youth have grown
I've really lived the way of the Corleone

[Chorus: La the Darkman]
Respect, loyalty, death, revenge
Life, riches, made, men

[La the Darkman]
You don't understand, chain of command
Bosses, generals, and, captains
The embassy, everybody gotta vote
Money in the walls, with the dead bolt
Locked, currency and stocked
Once straight from the block, the H&R Block

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
I got rules, morals, codes
But some niggas just think I got flows
It's a way of life, a culture
Civilized, but hungry as a volture
Steadily planning, to build my empire
Be a multi-millionaire before I expire
Only the strong survive, life's a jungle
My man Left sell roy by the bundle

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
I'm the truth, over achiever
Some same I'm the don, I believe ya
So make way, for the new king
B.K. boy, straight outta Sing-Sing
Hollow tips, to leave ya momma lonely
Like Sosa told Face, "Don't ever fuck me, Tony"
I'm authentic, raw, official
Tried to use my mind before I use my pistol
But most times it's animal instinct
Cuz most niggas don't think shit stink

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
A few years, I cop shit out of Forbes
Selling more blow, than Boston George
Went to G5's from Honda Accord's
'04, twelve don, '06, rap lord

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
The embassy, businessmen, war veterans
Study the word, in the order that I settle in

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
Don't lay the first two, you see the next two
Like the nigga you bench next to
Then the other four, don't worry him no more
You going straight to hell, one way tour
Now take it for real, or just talk
Even Sammy the Bull is a dead man walking

[Chorus]
