[Intro: La the Darkman]
Uh, yeah... uh, yeah...
Yeah...

[La the Darkman]
Niggas that ain't fam, I give a fuck about cha
Rob you like a bank, get some money up out cha
Two faced faggot ass, backstabbing punks
Waiting on you to move, so I can pull out and dump
It's a cold cold world, and niggas are weeded up
So I keep gats, so I can heat it up
Winter, spring, summer, fall, I prepare to brawl
Fuck some, I want it all, La quick on the draw
Hard nosed nigga with a Sing Sing click
Lock on a nigga, like a red nosed pick
Tired of these broads with this 'love you' shit
Love ain't for me, but you can love my dick
Or all this cake, that you seeing me get
Or all these whips, that you seeing me switch
You get the money, the power, then the bitch
Niggas choose getting high over getting rich, so I

[Chorus 2X: La the Darkman]
Shoot 'em, nigga, shoot 'em, nigga, shoot 'em, nigga
Guns don't kill, it's the nigga behind the trigger, I

[La the Darkman]
I'm a specialist, move like a cat burglar
La, real life stocking cap murderer
Leave you filled with holes, blood all over your nice clothes
I never sleep like I took a million No-Doze
Most niggas don't trust me, but, they can't touch me
Real bad boy, and I ain't down with Puffy
Niggas must be, out they God damn mind
Thinking my Sing Sing regime ain't gon' shine
Thinking I only get my money from a rhyme
I cop, cook, pack and sell, I'm on my grind
And I stay in the hottest whips, that foreigners design
With houses like Saddam and Osama, hard to find
I'm a don, you get shot going against me
Leave a bag where you shit, leave a straw where you pee
I'm that deal, turn your two legs to two wheels
You'll never walk again, believe I'm that chill, I

[Chorus 2X]
