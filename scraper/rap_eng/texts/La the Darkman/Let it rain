[Intro: Prodigal Sunn (60 Second Assassin)]
The game was funny for ten (10) years god (9)
Right now son (8), eating niggas plates (7)
Biting the forks and all of that shit (6)
Breaking that shit (5)
Eat to live (4), shit is real son (3)
FA Rock (2) and we don't stop (1)
(Zero)

[Verse 1: Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, it's like the game stay changing like gats, heat banging
I'mma keep flaming, while my clique stay reigning
And we done came a long ways, no time for playing
No time for faking, respect what I'm saying and DJ's know I'm not paying
I paid my dues, we slayed them crews
That slayed our jewels
And now y'all want to take us for fools
Cash Rules as I want some sell they soul like shoes
The new improved Sun-Zini the Great
Y'all niggas cornflake
Dying for the love of money, bitches and fame
Snitches and lames, now y'all want to scream my name
Shut the fuck up! y'all niggas get duct taped up
Scraped up, that's the ways of the game, your ate up
Feel me?

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin]
(Let it Rain)
Look as FA Rock to the Far Rock, I got head from the Bed-stuy
(Let it pour)
From the third to the eye, 60 Sec news, no one else did it sweeter
(Let it rain)
All the way from the desert to Medina, know what I mean?
(Let it pour)
And made ends meet, I came up hard in these streets

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
Sometimes I sit back and pray to Allah that I'll be a star
Thank you for my jewels and my house and my car
And the fish that I eat, and the dimes that I meet
All my niggas that's locked down, please let them out the beast
Let them see the street, have a fat pussy to beat
Watch the Tyson fight, sitting in the thousand dollar seats
That's my culture, talk about guns I got the most-a
My heart's made of stone like a ancient Greek sculpture
LA son, trapped in Babylon, think like a ex-con
Built like a Yukon, deadly as a python
Champion decathlon, terrifying amazon
From Taiwan, militant as the Pentagon
Get out

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin]
(Let it Rain)
When I say unto the wicked, thou shalt surely die
(Let it pour)
And thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life
(Let it rain)
The same wicked man shall die in his iniquity
(Let it pour)
But his blood will I require at thine hand

[Outro: 60 Second Assassin]
And that servant, which knew his lord's will
And prepared not himself, neither did according to his will
Shall be beaten with many stripes
The reason why it rains back on our planet
Is because the water cannot get out of the earth's atmosphere
By its high speed of rotating around the sun Makes it impossible
See earthquakes is caused by the son of man
By experiment with high explosives
In fact, all that stuff is caused by the Wu, the S.O.M
La the Darkman, you know what I'm saying?
Sophisticated gyps, the black pimps of the biz
