[Verse 1: Outloud]
Now there's multi, styles in my possession
No question I be nice rappers lose like Masta Ace rollin' dice
Too precise, check the visuals, we'll leave no residuals
Individuals makin gold diggers miserable
So no-no for beef, smoke the coco leaf
Its no relief, as this rap door revolves and I enter
Tecs enter strong like people homes
Blow up mics like I blow illegal phones
Homes is flesh and bones not the fraud you're looking for
The plunder, go under think we one hit wonder yo I spoil it
Flush that 'tuh' down the toiled sip the alcoholic uh
Then Blahzay hit ya with the Whatchamacallit
You bleed red water step into my headquarter out of order
Medina, animals eat you like Purina
Catch how I never bow still I am to please
Drain what you got like if I was your main squeeze
Wack MC's ease, the end is here at last
Jet real fast with your tail between your ass

[Hook]
(Scratching) "The more dangerous"
