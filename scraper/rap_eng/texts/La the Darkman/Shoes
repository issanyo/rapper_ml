[Intro: DJ Drama]
Shout out to LA the Dark
Monday through Sunday, we rock different pairs
Feel me, Gangsta Grillz

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I gotta problem, I got the answer now
No more singing chicks I'm messing with a dancer now
She got a stripper pole, know how to break it down
She went from nothing to something, she tryna make it now
She's original I boosted up her style
She's got her down town pierced just to make me smile
We was finna go but she naked now
And she did it in front of an audience

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty got ass, skinny lil waist, I ain't stupid can't let it go to waste
Man damn she got swag, temperatures heat, picture perfect every scene
Any camera flash, go and try to get her, but when you do she says that I'm with her
They got the last, I'm chasing with the mask, tell me who's meaner when I switch 'em like sneakers

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And you know I never never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothing from me cause I live that life
And you know I never never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothing from me cause I live that life

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I can't get rid of her, can't understand it now
I got the fresh girl nigga you got the hand me down
You got the sloppy seconds, already dug it out
I did my dougie, sat down and let her work it out
She got them cakes out, I call her Betty Crock
Mr. Flintstone I can make your bed rock
When I was tryna go, she got naked now
Shawty took it off in a Dolorian

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty got ass, skinny lil waist, I ain't stupid can't let it go to waste
Man damn she got swag, temperatures heat, picture perfect every scene
Any camera flash, go and try to get her, but when you do she says that I'm with her
They got the last, I'm chasing with the mask, tell me who's meaner when I switch 'em like sneakers

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And you know I never never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothing from me cause I live that life
And you know I never never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothing from me cause I live that life
Cause I treat them like shoes

[Verse 3: LA the Darkman]
Whether Jordan 13s or Jordan D-wades
With every new pair my old pair feel played
New Carmello's, new Chris Paul's
Little do they know I love all y'all
I treat 'em like pros, high top or lows
Space Jam, Bugs Bunny, Jordan retros
She bring it back, Barkley's all black
Or the red, white and grey Air Macs
I like that, a closet full of sneakers
Just like my black book full of freakers
LA dark men, L.A deep
Only wear Nike or the Timberland shoes

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
I treat 'em like shoes, yeah that's what I do, nanny nanny boo boo, I'm shitting on you
I treat 'em all like shoes, some rough and some smooth, hust like shoes
More than ones that I use, she gotta a dunk, alley-oop
Nike's like new, treat 'em all like shoes, treat 'em all like shoes

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Never never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothing from me cause I live that life
Never never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothing from me cause I live that life
