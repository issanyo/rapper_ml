[Intro: Rayson, Zu Keeper]

[Hook: Rayson]
We some GQ, get fresh, lamp a lot niggas

*repeat 3x*

[12 O'Clock]
What's up, nigga? What, you strung out, you ain't workin no more?
Got that ho-ass bitch tellin' you you ain't worth it no more
She fuckin' while you on tour, the nigga next door
Y'all even played basketball, ya should've punched in the jaw
Na, nigga need to stay on tour, 10 g's is worth more
She's a chickenhead whore, tryin' to score
I knew a bitch like that before, named Mo'
What a mink in the snow, a ring on the toe
12 O'Clock know, a bitch never want a bitch
Bitch!

[La the Darkman]
Yo 12, this bitch Sky livin' in Bed-stuy
Hon' used to be a dime 'til she started gettin' high
The high school prom queen, now she prom fiend
Her man was 85, so he sold her a dream
Told her he was rich, so she sucked his dick
Swallowed all his cum and she didn't even spit
Suckin' him off in the whip, he loved that bitch
He loved that bitch.. he loved that bitch

[Hook: repeat 3x]

[Shorty Shit Stain]
I know this nigga on the Hill who got mad mils
Some masses, got credit cards, I mean this nigga got big bills
Well, anyway, I'mma sick him
He trust this girl named Dawn, put me on, took the ho Vic 'em
She say he don't be home to caress her
So I undressed her and made her feel better
He got the safe in the basement under the cemented floor
So what more, could you ask for?

[Outro: Zu Keeper]
