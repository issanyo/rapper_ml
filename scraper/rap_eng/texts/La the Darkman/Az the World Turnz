[Intro: La The Darkman, (Raekwon)]
Word up. La The Dark' and Chef
(True, let's get it right.)
Aiyyo. Fourth
(Let's get it right like white.)
Burning that ass. Sniff it up
(You know how we go, kid.)
Like a hound on dope
(Yeah. Yeah.)
Word. Word life. La The Dark'
Big up to my many Buck-Buck
Don't sweat that
(What up, son.)
It's all good
(Check it. Check it.)

[Raekwon]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Aiyyo La, what's up son
Aiyyo, you read the papers
2 Columbian niggas hit these moneymakers
A heavy routine, Chevy, Yukon green
Had crazy coke up in that piece by all means

[La The Darkman]
The kids was mad flonting, Rae', it had to go down
Killers be coming for your neck, when you wearing a crown
4-5's and AK's, kids ready to spray
The cats got nine lives from around my way
Timb boots and overlord, two techs by the door
So, when the po-po come, I can take them to war

[Raekwon]
Same subject, techs and royalty checks
Plus marketing the drugs, equal mad respect
I gotta get mine, blast mad nines on a regular
Fake competitor or player,will meet his maker

[La The Darkman]
Who's the rap mayor, it's me, I be the slayer
The dark's in the realm, you contemplate your prayers
Meteorite of clips hitting in the 9-5th
All you yapping MC's, like pancakes you get flipped
I got a thirty shot clip at the grip of the hip
A mad av. warrior, young tale from the crypt, kid

[Chorus: Raekwon, (La The Darkman)] (x2)
As the world goes round yo the same is the same
(Same junkies on the corners shooting shit in their vein)
But still, black man must rise up to the top
(Representing Darkman with this real hip hop)

[Interlude: Raekwon, (La The Darkman)]
And you don't stop (and you don't stop)
Yeah! (and you can't stop) and you can't stop
(Word up! word drop that style)

[La The Darkman]
You only live once, execute your dreams
A third real triple beam, weighed out my scheme
For the cream, I sold cracks, never could relax
Now build with Wu-Tang, spitting lyrical facts
Young black mad bastard from the concrete street
And I never leave the land without strapping my heat
Keep peace and don't beef, word life Tariq
I stole the million dollar show cause I'm that dark thief
Part Dark part spark, ready to rip you apart
I was born with a gold shield over my heart
So, don't start none, it won't be none
I'm dominating the screen, my reign just begun
I got raw and uncut for the kids doing bids
You can't figure my physical like a pyramid
I'm that wicked dark star, may La now rise
I switch to warp space 5 like the Starship Enterprise

[Chorus to fade]
