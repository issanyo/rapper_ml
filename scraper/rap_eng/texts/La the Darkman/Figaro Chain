[Chorus: La the Darkman]
We deal with lucci, knowledge, bitches that go to college
Niggas bubbling bricks, that see twenty million dollars
I move wise, Chinese secret enterprise
Black spies giving niggas Darkman neck ties, so civilize

[Verse 1: Havoc]
What up nigga, Havoc, yeah that grimy bastard
Get outlasted, you on some pretty rap shit
Fucking with thugs, violate this, one in the mug
Show no love, four-pounders was holding us, that's a must
Straight up and down, in gats we trust
Think you bust, touch the stainless steel gats that never rust
It's the lust, to get me vexed, don't take much
You get blitzed on, shitted on, TNT rush
Through the door, knocked off the motherfucking hinges
Relentless, running through your hood right off the hit list

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
Between the gods and the goddesses, devils and demons
I'm weed steaming, gold 32 karat tech gleaming
Cream feening, like Casino, Trafficante, Gambino
Rollin strapped on a bike, New Jack sit, like G and Nino
Shit is real dunn, me and Hav rap for guns
You just a son, you be hung by the skin on your tongue
P.R.'s on the run, change my name, identity
Got a dynasty of clanmen wit cheese like the Kennedy's
Non-friendly, see me in Brazil sipping Henny
Check my pinky ring medallion, it's a form gold penny
I'm drug, put my foot in my victims in cold blood
Life is cheap for you thugs when you give the dirt a hug
You move slow, direct effect of sniffing snow
Lason, home alone smoking with a red bone
That gets messy, Darkman blow spots like Joe Pesci
In bars, wit twenty yards, "Get out of jail free" cards
You can't fuck wit this Monopoly, knocker, dumb blocker
Dreaded one, straight vodka, best selling crime shocker
Telling street stories, famous in the ghetto, knife glory
Taking lives 'cause the RZA shouldn't have let me out the hive
Darkman

[Chorus x2: La the Darkman]
We deal with lucci, knowledge, bitches that go to college
Niggas bubbling bricks, that see twenty million dollars
I move wise, Chinese secret enterprise
Black spies giving niggas Darkman neck ties, so civilize

[Outro: La the Darkman]
Word up, civilize, know what I'm saying? La the Darkman
Mobb Deep, get sniped in your sleep, word up, word up
Triple Darkness
