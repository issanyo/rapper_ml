[Intro]
Word up!
Yeah! La the Darkman, you know what I''m saying?
Word up! takin' you on this expedition, Trafficante
Word up! the underworld mission
You know what I''m saying?
Revolution, yo
Check it out, yo

[Chorus]
The La's invincible
You thug cats, I'ma stab on principal
Better off dead working with a glass forehead
You got star dreams on a corner drinking gasoline
My man threw you up in a fiend no contest
Dunn I'm blessed and you a devil in a blue dress
Dunn I'm blessed and you a devil in a blue dress

[Pre-verse]
You know what I''m saying? Word up! La the Dark

[Verse 1]
Yo, this brilliant companion piece to the original
Approach my slang and end up in critical condition
When I lick my shells, I ain't missing
Technician, you get stabbed back in position
I know that money bring bitches and bitches aren't to be trusted
Some rappers sniff coke and others be getting dusted
City lights, I'm in it with new books to read
I feed my man locked down, my physicals and my seed
I ain't got shit, while you rap niggas be playing rich
Send you to Vegas in a ditch, making life cold switch
I'm invincible, you get dead before you start
My knife is sharp, push rap spikes through your heart
La fight dirty, I strike first like snatching a purse
Inside my verse, take you to the edge of the earth
And throw you over, son you drunk I smack you sober
Assassin, blasting up your Range Rover

[Chorus]
The La's invincible
You thug cats, I'ma stab on principal
Better off dead working with a glass forehead
You got star dreams on a corner drinking gasoline
My man threw you up in a fiend no contest
Dunn I'm blessed and you a devil in a blue dress
Dunn I'm blessed and you a devil in a blue dress

[Verse 2]
Triple darkness, yo, expedition
Yo, I'm from a long breed of stick up kids
Coking hustlers, Gods
Foreign cars, strong arm Tech tusslers
The streets got me in a hold chin deep
Quantum leap, a bum told me life is cheap
My lyrics dancing, lamping, eating fish in a Wu mansion
At Park Place I'ma dance and only my wiz I'm romancing
Posted all you chicken niggas get roasted
I read manuscripts, in 97 whips L's is toasted
I said something, I meant it, your Benz'll get dented
My guns get more open than a envelope with money in it
Where I live it's only crack, fiends and dirty jeans
Shorties on the block with the platinum drug dreams
Everything ain't how it seems, I got bagged at 14
On a highway running guns outta New Orleans
It's La, what you think them niggas tremble in pink
Stumbling, you a cat that turn tough when he drink
Keeping you lifted, reminisce on what Chris did
Pull out the mac and shot five cats and a civilian
Right in front of the building with kids playing, Shells is spraying
On the second floor Shelly mom's praying
Got caught by a stray in a window in broad day
And she die, fucked up it had to be that way
It was a drunk nigga who done it
Word up! You know what I''m saying? Yo

[Chorus]
The La's invincible
You thug cats, I'ma stab on principal
Better off dead working with a glass forehead
You got star dreams on a corner drinking gasoline
My man threw you up in a fiend no contest
Dunn I'm blessed and you a devil in a blue dress
Dunn I'm blessed and you a devil in a blue dress

[Outro]
Word up!
La Trafficante, you know what I''m saying?
You kids better walk straight and master your high
You know what I''m saying? Or you'll be the next to die
Word up! Sending hands to Allah
You know what I''m saying? Word up!
Triple darkness, Supreme, word up!
Power, and my whole unit!
