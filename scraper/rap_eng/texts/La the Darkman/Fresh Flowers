[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah... fresh flowers...
La the Dark... yo...

[La the Darkman]
Figaro chains, Cuban Linx, three quarter minks
Private planes, jet lear, bull horn, cardiere
Insight done told me that I live, elevator in my crib
Backyard, full court, literature, Rob Report
Blue diamond, BBS, double breast, bulletproof vest
Two g stack, bulging out my coochie sweats
Forever in competition, Cryst' pissing, roley glisten
Type nigga been baking pies, in my momma kitchen
While she at work, fucking virgins, screaming in hurt
Lift they tennis skirt, seventeen pumps, then I squirt
Favorite bitch; Mary Blige, favorite gun; four-five
Been in multiple shoot-outs, three times, I almost died
I ride, like a cowboy, B.K. wild boy
Heartless child, like to play with forty cal. toys
Half a millionaire, try'nna be a billionaire
Osama Bin Ladin's father's an oil zillionaire
Tycoon, causing mass destructions, like typhoons
Believe, you cross the Clan, you die soon
But rather than later, have you breathing on the respirator
Busting at your click, niggas running out of they data's
It's La...

[Interlude: La the Darkman]
Understand... it's just the life, man
Get a load of me... yeah...

[La the Darkman]
Feel like I'm locked in the cellar, La the Darkman, Nelson Mandela
Smoke scents in suites, Penn & Teller, cigarello fella
Momma wished I went to Yale, but I ended up in jail
Making collect calls, try'nna post bail
And that wasn't where I planned to be, fighting for my sanity
This world is about money, not about humanity
Young dude, taught to do math, eat food
Older Gods, from the yards, trained my attitude rude
I'm Godly, but when I'm pissed, I'm devilish
Malcolm X type, with a John Gotti twist
Stay blitzed, on the daily, except when I'm with my baby
I gave out consignment, fuck you, nigga, pay me
Elementary Dear Watson, gats keep popping
Drugs keep clocking, the feds keep watching
So I stay low-pro, always keep a calico
Beemer or the Benz, both got the stash, yo
It's ridiculous, my style is sicker than cyphillis
Don't laugh much, cuz my heart ain't ticklish
It's La...

[Outro: La the Darkman]
Nigga, yeah, fresh flowers, nigga
