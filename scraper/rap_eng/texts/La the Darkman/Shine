[Chorus]
Uh uh, for the niggas in black Vigors
Behind the wheel drinking liquors
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas rocking Tims, fuck cars and rims
Yo, everybody wanna shine

[Verse 1]
Yo, my dimensions, possessed, lucci, bitches, cess
Lessons, computers, whips, and bulletproof vests
I can't be done, me and Screwface one on one
I drink wit bums in the slums where I shoot my guns
Enforce ones, up north in the Ac, throw a strap
I got niggas down south, holding nines in Cadillacs
Letting trees blow, for niggas sniff snow inside the disco
I hold a big pistol, to crack your brain crystal
Cream like Joe Pisco', I fuck your bitch yo
Right through her piss hole
Long dick like a missile
Split the black dutch, while the bracelet on my wrist glow
Cough if I spit mo', sold my Lex, cop the Benzo
My niggas come outta Sing Sing buff like Lou Ferrigno
The rhyme sayer, quicker Ruger nine sprayer
Rich lifestyle like a young NBA player
And I'm tied to the mob like that gun, called Tommy
Shoot through your Armani, shoot at Giuliani
Shoot at Illuminati, fuck everybody, it's the Darkman
(understand that right there)

[Chorus]
For the niggas in black Vigors, behind the wheel drinking liquors
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas is rocking Tims, fuck cars and rims
Yo, everybody wanna shine
For the niggas that lock downed for busting caps wit four pounds
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas in Lexus Cruisers wit cocked back Rugers
Yo, everybody wanna shine

[Verse 2]
Yo, you wanna be me
Sometimes I'm on the block, sometimes I'm on the TV
My crew's greedy, like Boom Boom Mancini
La's song buy weedy, Swahili, Saadiqi
Professional, hold my toast by my testicles
I used to peddle, but three times two equal the devil
Blinded by the ice, and the savage way of life
To no avail, niggas get money in small scales
Start smoking, like they don't know crack kills
A freak nigga, got turned down by a female
Didn't know he sucked death, when he just inhale
I rap life, cocaine, niggas wit no brain
Selling crack for fifteen years with no gain
That's a damn shame, check the result of being broke
Having no whip, no lab, no money for smoke
He stressed out, really not knowing what life's about
Jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels

[Chorus]
For the niggas in black Vigors, behind the wheel drinking liquors
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas is rocking Tims, fuck cars and rims
Yo, everybody wanna shine
For the niggas that lock downed for busting caps wit four pounds
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas in Lexus Cruisers wit cocked back Rugers
Yo, everybody wanna shine

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, dunn I'm felt
Gun in my waist, tight belt
New York streets hot, the bottom of my Wallees melt
I need wealth, puffing my lah by myself
Blessed, with food clothes and health
And big whips, shorties say I got a big dick
My first video, I rock twenty outfits
The Benz 6, got me wanna flip ten bricks
VCR headrest watching Scarface flicks
I politic, with ex cons, old cats, drug dons
Niggas that's known to take a arm for a arm
I move calm as a lion of Judah, black [?] of Buddha
Silent as a basehead, sucking on his hooter
'Cause Cash Rules, that's why I study new jewels
And keep tools, to create blood pools
For new crews, rappers, on my territory
I cock back the fifth, and make 'em his-story
Remember him, the kid wit the big Jesus em-blem
Threw shells from the toast, had his bones trembling
Nigga, I'm the cat y'all be talking about dunn

[Chorus]
For the niggas in black Vigors, behind the wheel drinking liquors
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas is rocking Tims, fuck cars and rims
Yo, everybody wanna shine
For the niggas that lock downed for busting caps wit four pounds
Everybody wanna shine
For the niggas in Lexus Cruisers wit cocked back Rugers
Yo, everybody wanna shine

[Outro]
'Cause I shine nigga, shine on nigga (what)
Straight shine nigga, know what I mean? Word up
The sun gon' burn out (stay shining, and stay spicy)
I'ma shine till the sun burn out
Straight up, word, the Embassy, my family
The Embassy, my family, yeah
