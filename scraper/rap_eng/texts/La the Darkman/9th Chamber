{*evil laughter*}

[La the Darkman]
Yeah, INS, yo
La the Darkman
Hit 'em with the death blow
Yo

Yo, I'm known to spit poems, throw dice and hold tones
Show ice, puff bones, hit beats like Larry Holmes
Through the Valley of Kings, you catch the Killa Bee sting
Tryin to pick up, you fuckin with the archbishop
Defyin me is like startin Rap World War 3
You rather sell your key to NYPD
My style's vicious, I rap in the lab and break dishes
My words wear jet black hoods, lookin suspicious
Darkman

[Beretta 9]
Behold the struggle fire ultra harmonizer, track paralyzer
Artist he the real, blood spilled on the synthesizer
4th, turn it up a peak, make the speaker tweet
Iron Sheik camel clutch a beat, rappers take your seat
In fact punch a clock, it's my time to rock, dock the known like a scott
Engineered this thought that I present, so just
Comprehend, while I fill you in, with a bar or ten
And clear the path for the god Sin, do 'em in kid (Yo)

[Killa Sin]
I stay lurkin, circlin the premises
Dart chemist sent on a search for arch nemesis
Concoctin neurotoxins out of synonyms
Send your physical in triple shock, crippled in a detox with no rememberance
While I rocks the maximum shows for no minimum
Capacity to pack the front row but flow naturally
Killin 'em, swing on the stage like jagged pendulums
And blow like thirty shrapnel grenades with no pins in 'em

[Street Life]
Why risk it? Killah Hill District, we flip shit
Egotistic, I hold grounds with twin biscuits
Put it up, I lay it down, my streets sound surround
Shaolin bound, flash flood watch you might drown
Headliner, move through the city like a sidewinder
Island drifter, black vagina finder
Loungin by the seashore, switch like Bloody Roar
And slap hardcore dick to your main wiz, bitch

[Inspectah Deck]
Toxi' on Bacardi Pina, low crawlin through Medina
Slumped in the seven-seater
Dumpin heaters, to bite might cause seizures
Weak MC's take me to your leader
We the true source, movin off on uncharted course
My thoughts come across with a blindin force
Killa Bees plant seeds, log on
Or get knocked off like a pawn if you dare lock horns

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
You are now in the 9th chamber
Where the falls of reality close in fast on the world of make-believe
And your fantasy is nothin more but a memory
Now bear witness to the realness
Shown and proven
We live by the sword...
