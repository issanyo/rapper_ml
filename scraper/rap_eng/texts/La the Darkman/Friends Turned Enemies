(LA the Darkman)
Dead presidents is a dead white boy's face
They say, the prison yard is a criminals myspace
Where we learn treachery, how to be Scarface
In the casket or in jail seems to be our place
I'm the truest to ever do this, patient as a buddhist
Smoking on Popeye, fighting like Brutus
I used to be foolish now I'm grown with my own
A couple companies couple cars a couple homes
My niggas come to me when they need a small loan
People getting brain tumors where they hold their cell phone
High science, ghetto CNN with the pen
Little nigga I don't follow, I set the trend
Keeping the feds out, keep money coming in
My hardest accomplishment is staying out the pen
I got my first 16 grams when I was 10
Imagine how much coke I've sold since then?
I'm a champion, like the hoody blowing on pounds of goody
He never stopped hustling, why would he?
He never loved these hoes, why should he?

Hook
Enemies want to be friends and friends turned to enemies
The only thing don't change is your family
I lay back, burning wood like a chimney
Forever and ever and ever we the Embassy (x2)

(Willie the Kid)
Wear gators, different color flavors
Willie overlooking acres clay shooting with my neighbors
And plus I got my name engraved in my gauge ageless
Cognac sipping getting paper by the pages
Me, never change never phased by the change
Niggas going through a phase they amazed by the thing
They poppin' champagne spend they last on a chain
So when you ain't save a thing can't blame John McCain
A father to your child gotta school them to the game
Your son sipping syrup can't blame Little Wayne
We must become accountable, thinking's what we gotta do
Consuming fast food wash it down with a Mountain Dew
That's why we crazy, with headaches we feeling lazy
We need some hey young worlds, Brenda's got a baby
To balance out all the gun talk my rims my wrist
My gat my ice my cash my bricks my bitch
Sing sing battalion, button up Italian
I'm styling, I miss the child with a stallion

Hook
Enemies want to be friends and friends turned to enemies
The only thing don't change is your family
I lay back, burning wood like a chimney
Forever and ever and ever we the Embassy (x2)
