[Verse 1: Kobe]
Nigga you know I'm a rider, nickel plated llama
Pull up right beside ya, yup (you know this)
I don't give a fuck bout, What you niggas talk bout
Now you fuckers chalked out, yup (you know this)
True killas, No tellin'
Drug dealin' and convicted felons
Staged that, Drop top seat pushed way back
This is ya funeral service, Switch it to the all black Maybach
Things change nigga this our year
The game need a change, Cold killa right here
Nightmares, For niggas gettin' they sleep on
We keepin' the streets warm
Real rich young niggas
Street Fam for life they can't fuck with us

[Hook: Kobe]
Now I-I-I, Go hard
Yea yea yea, So hard [x3]
SO hard, So hard, So hard, So hard

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Time to send em flowers and cards with our regards
A special rest in peace goes to all you cowards and frauds
Like water in the freezer that's how I go hard
Fly in ya bitches' legs, Twin Tower ya broad
Gotta check ya boy dougie, Check a boy luggy
I scare the shit out niggas, Check ya boy huggies
Death to the competition, Die slow bastard
Black G top on call it closed casket
Black card titanium, No plastic
Black henny shots to the head I'm so blasted
They call me young funeral
And the bitch with badder than my two year old
You niggas softer than a tuna roll, Sushi ass niggas
Bougi ass niggas, With my blues brother's shades I'll Belushi past niggas
Nigga I make it hard like a pretty naked braud
Wassup son

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Cain]
You know ya boy flow extra, I'm harder than concrete
Gimme a couple minutes with a blunt and a hard beat
I'm all street, The hottest niggas is all sweet
I'm listenin', And ain't heard nothin' strong all week
Bury you right beside the gat you in the booth with
I eat ya favorite rapper for breakfast, Gimme a toothpick
These niggas appetizers, Way to bring the entree
I put on for my city so amazing, No Kanye
We runnin' this town, Studda gang all day
We in house and you a Outkast, No Andre
I chase it all day, If I ain't pushin' bomb yay
Remember jack move, Hands up like the song say
Play with Paul pay, I give it up the wrong way
Chrome 44 bulldog pointed the long way
Without the second thought of a doubt
The competition all dead call the coroner out

[Verse 4: La the Darkman]
I'm Hard like Rikers Island bars
Hard, like a inmate from oz
La the Dark, I'll pull ya card
I lead my allegiance like Master Furrah
Oppose me must be a retard
Get ya brain ajarred
Bullets like Brett Favre
Then beat the charge
I'll beat the odds
Big and black
With black cards and black cars
All black everything
Cartel Medillin
Specialize in coke and Methamphetamines
See things cheddar brings
Bisexual hoes, impeccable flows, murcielagos
Car and truck combos
How my song goes
Bang hammers at niggas like africans on congos
Let me slow it down a bit
I'm hard they soft as baby shit
LA!
