[Interlude]
Yeah come on, yeah, word

[Verse 1]
Woke up early afternoon, just after two
It's Saturday contemplating what I'm gon' do
Had a long night last night leaving the studio
Headed to the kitchen and make me some cereal
Fruity Pebbles or Fruit Loops, that's how I do
Sit down at the table, read my two-way through
Twelve unread messages, damn I was buggin'
Last night I didn't feel it vibrating or nothing
Up in Speed Henny'd out, I don't fuck with Grey Goose
Give white liquor to bitches, it make 'em loose
Left out with two dames, my lab, got brains
Blindfolded them on the way, they'll never know they way
To my hideout, it's like a cave, come there, you be amazed
So many left and right turns, you'll think you in a maze
LaSon, Bruce Wayne, Darkman, Batman
With gadgets like guns and shit, tons of clips
Butterfly knives and box cutters all within my grip
Been stabbin' niggas and shit, better check my rap sheet
Matter fact, all them punk ass cases, I've beat
By threatenin' the witness, or hittin' them off with digits
Talkin' with they mothers, or puttin' pressure on brothers
I'm the purest, some cases didn't have to pick the jurors
It didn't go that far, good lawyers know the law
Threw out on the preliminaries, yeah, I've been there
It's the Dark, L-A-S-O-N, polly with the best of men
Generals and kings, Brooklyn to Queens
The Bronx back to Harlem, I know niggas is starvin'
Staten Island they wildin', those my brothers, beg 'em pardon

[Chorus x2]
In this life, we hustle for all we got
There's two sides of the system, have and have nots
Some get dough, some get robbed and shot
For all your tribulations, I recommends a lot

[Verse 2]
Staying to win, thorough from beginning to the end
Everybody that I shake hands with ain't my friends
Just associates, let them get close as they suppose to get
Close enough to see that rifle, I'ma scope them with
Close enough to see that knife, I'ma poke 'em with
Not that friendly, don't laugh at all the jokes and shit
Dead serious, most times furious
Like a nigga on a bitch, if she miss the period
This shit is chess, not checkers, the IRS gon' check us
The DEA gon' check us, the ATF gon' check us
If the FBI don't check us first, murders make it worse
It's ill seein' your right hand, ride off in a hearse
But without bloodshed, there'll be no peace
I read that in the Qur'an, Surah number three
Only the strong survive, the weak shall perish
Got that out of the Bible, so many didn't hear it
The stories, how Moses and Jesus, struggled to feed us
Abraham and Mohamed, all the above were prophets
Do you history, you'll find out, life ain't a mystery
There's always been conflicts, with crews and cliques
Like back in the ocean, if you ran into pirates
They'll blast they cannons and rob your whole ship
For your jewels, your food, all your values
Predators eat prey, the same goin' today

[Chorus x2]
In this life, we hustle for all we got
There's two sides of the system, have and have nots
Some get dough, some get robbed and shot
For all your tribulations, I recommends a lot
