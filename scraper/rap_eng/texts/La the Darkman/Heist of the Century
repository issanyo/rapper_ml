[Verse 1: Killa Sin]
Ski masked, the First National for a half a mill'
It's real, fuck rational
Your armored truck stuck like dustheads for my collateral
Certified criminal, gun smuggling villain who be filling clips
Fuller than cum swelling your genitals

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
Specialist, cat burglar, stocking cap murder
Uzi clip inserterer, you got cheese, I heard of ya
You dirty rat, maneuvered through traps and torched doors
Plastic explosives, bags of C-4

[Verse 3: Killa Sin]
Yo, flash a cannon, deliver these clowns an understanding
That Cash Rules don't nothing move kid, five-hundred grand an'
The raw son, making assault when armor wait till the gold lock
Fuck the wreck, fumbled up the wrong time

[Verse 4: La the Darkman]
Yo, I clip the phone lines, cut the alarm, the pipe bomb
Detonation, seven minutes the first task, we in it
Lace the tear gas, put on your mask, load the bags
Check the roof for the jake, I'mma climb the gate last

[Verse 5: Killa Sin]
Scan the Internet, copy the floppy shut the drive off
'cinerate the whole data bank before we slide off
Time check: twenty-four hundred and still wasting
The minutes keep racing, let's blow this foundation

[Verse 6: La the Darkman]
Keep patient, I got the whole Dole administration
On CD-Rom, smuggling firearms
And the date to attempt assassinate Farrakhan
From his Middle East trips and building with Saddam
Yo hold the laptop

[Chorus: Killa Sin and La the Darkman] (x2)
Yo it's the Heist of the Century kid we execute right
We going down in history, get the loot and live life
How it's meant to be
A stolen legacy, live Egyptian mystery, (word up)

[Verse 7: Killa Sin]
We on the way out (stolen Legacy), the future laid out
Our brain scrambling Arnez
Break a cold sweat but never panicking
Shooken up, two officers looking up, we spot 'em
Pull the heat out, and have both they asses red-dotted

[Verse 8: La the Darkman]
Don't move, we got the bank money not yours
Think of your kids and calmly lay on the floor
Put your hands high, dunn get they guns
Then break 'em, slap one with the barrel
Make 'em bleed then tape 'em

[Verse 9: Killa Sin]
It's like a minute and ten left, we playing with death
And I can hear the bomb tick
Sweat drip on the back my palm grip
Final mission, completed all bank funds depleted
Hit the turnpike, bounce to the stash, let's split it even

[Verse 10: La the Darkman]
Yo, the blueprint went excellent
Wisdom-God seconds for the dynamite
On the next flight before daylight
Exit through the back entrance, jump the fence
Then slide in the Rover with the triple black tints
We hit the government, word up Dunn
We hit the government, know what I'm saying?

[Chorus: Killa Sin and La the Darkman] (x2)
