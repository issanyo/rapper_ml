[Intro]
Word up, it's La
It's rough out here God, you know?
Word up, yeah

[Chorus x2]
It's only love, doing this thing, paw
It's only love that I'm giving

[Verse 1]
Yo, Earths are crying, as they see their sons dying
In the streets, bitches are burning like the bottom of an iron
Negativity is all that brothers see in my environment
I don't work for the white man 'cause cocaine is hiring
My times is expiring, but I don't care
All I do is buy sneakers, new cars and beer
When I need to buy estates 'fore it get too late
But furnished basements, have my all crew, lifting weights
Drinking liquor, see the real picture, your life is too short
Will you make that million dollars, paw, before you get caught?
Between stick-up kids and Jake, you got to make your own fate
It was another kid's beef, my son got caught by a stray
And he passed, gone in a flash from a four-five shell
And I gotta believe in heaven 'cause the ghetto is hell
What is reality, and the lifestyle of all men?
I need a mansion, twins, Heinekens and skins
I don't drink Gin to sin, leave that to raw-dick Kim
'Cause he too light to fight, so he shoot to win in the end

[Chorus x2]
It's only love, doing this thing, paw
It's only love that I'm giving

[Verse 2]
Madmen disappear here over the years
Accept collect calls from my penitentiary peers
It's locked down for snow, I wanna live a better life
Know mad niggas caught by the Germans and drugs twice
Now they behind bars, told when to eat, sleep and shit
Transformed a three-year to a eight-year bid
'Cause he jooked a kid, peace to Mena, Big E, now Wayne
You'll be home son, sporting fly Air ones
But in the world, yeah there's still shorties bugging
On a block at night busting off guns for nothing
I've done that, I'm trying to escape that, black
Little Mike just came back from doing four years flat
He was a hostage, trapped in a four-corner room
Shipped far upstate, seen light to the moon
Never snitched, that's why he doing six plus six
While half y'all cats'll go to court, singing like a bitch
These are the true facts of it, either hate it or love it
Stash your toast in my whip, in the wood grain, covered
But it's peace, cause I'ma fuck up cats with no grease
This track is for the niggas locked down and deceased
R.I.P., R.I.P

[Chorus x4]
It's only love, doing this thing, paw
It's only love that I'm giving

[Outro: La the Darkman *during Chorus*]
Word up, Parada
Liz, Big Gus, all my maniacs
Tracks, cousin Facts
Word up, Mena, Slow Joe
You know? Word up
All mine, you know what I mean?
Gotti, word up
Selassie, know what I'm saying? Word up
You know? My man King, Ced Demon
King Gunner, word up
Know what I'm saying?? Ugh!
