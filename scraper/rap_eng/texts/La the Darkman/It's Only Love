[Intro: La the Darkman]
Word up, it's La
It's rough out here God, you know?
Word up, yea..

[Chorus 2X: La the Darkman]
It's only love, doin this thing, pa
It's only love that I'm givin

[La the Darkman]
Yo, Earths are cryin, as they see their son's dyin
In the streets, bitches are burnin like the bottom of an iron
Negativity is all that brothers see in my environment
I don't work for the white man, cuz coccaine is hirin
My times is expirin, but I don't care
All I do is buy sneakers, new cars and beer
When I need to buy estates, 'fore it get too late
But furnished basements, have my all crew, liftin weights
Drinkin liquor, see the real picture, your life is too short
Will you make that million dollars, pa, before you get caught?
Between stick-up kids and jakes, you got to make your own fate
It was another kid's beef, my son got caught by a stray
And he passed on in a flash from a four-five shell
And I gotta believe in Heaven cuz the ghetto is Hell
What is reality, and the lifestyle of all men?
I need a mansion, twins, Heineken's and skins
I don't drink Gin to sin, leave that to raw-dick Kim
Cuz he too light to fight, so he shoot to win in the end

[Chorus 2X]

[La the Darkman]
Madmen disappear here over the years
Accept collect calls from my penetentiary peers
It's locked down for snow, I wanna live a better life
Know mad niggas caught by the Germans and drugs twice
Now they behind bars, told when to eat, sleep and shit
Transformed a three-year to a eight-year bid
Cuz he jooked a kid, peace to Mena, Big E, now Wayne
You'll be home son, sportin fly Air ones
But in the world, yea there's still shorties buggin
On a block at night bustin off guns for nothin
I've done that, I'm tryin to escape that, black
Little Mike just came back from doin four years flat
He was a hostage, trapped in a four-corner room
Shipped far upstate, seen light to the moon
Never snitched, that's why he's doin six plus six
While half y'all cats'll go to court, singin like a bitch
These are the true facts of it, either hate it or love it
Stash your toast in my whip, in the wood grain, covered
But it's peace, cuz I'ma fuck up cats with no grease
This track is for the niggas locked down and deceased
R.I.P., R.I.P

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: La the Darkman *during Chorus*]
Word up, Parada
Liz, Big Gus, all my maniacs

Word up, Mena, Slow Joe
You know? Word up
All mine, yaknowImean?
Gotti, word up

You know? My man King, Ced Demon
King Gunner, word up
