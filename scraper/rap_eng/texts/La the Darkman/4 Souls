Intro:

This is how we goin' do
We goin' do this right
Word, word is bond
Know what I'm sayin'
Six July with the track
Know what I'm sayin
You know how we do
Word up, yo
Let Dark pass no stunting
]From the real
Better get your 4 pound God
Let's proceed
Yo, what yo, yo

Verse 1: LA

I run up on rap like Boo Smith on a halfback
Put my patch down, cause a head crack
I'm trapped, in a hole filled with guns and drugs
Beheaders, notty dreaders, 5%'s and thugs
Style tight like O.J. gloves
Niggas state to state think I'm bugged
Cause I burn bitch niggas with hot slugs
It's the coke that got me caught
In this dead train of thought
D-Cepticon and Teflon from the Bronx New York
Holding a pitchfork for cream
Eyes on high beams, 13
Cooking up coke, selling to dope fiends
Now realise my anger as I craft my chamber
With no parental vision, made a fucking head-banger
Who's in danger? You dis this judge you get sentenced
Disrespect Darkman you get slapped with a Guinness
Kid finished, baby MC's I'm just choking 'em
My script hits your town like 300 pounds of opium
What, turbulence, this is your first defense
Scripts stay strapped to kill in action-packed suspense
Cocoa plants, I payed the cost in a loft
Now lyrics machete-chopping niggas that's butter soft
At the holocaust

Verse 2: Shotti

Prepare for this killin' chain
Fight you lose to nightmares
Sandman and my desert's diesel losin'
This non-script, to the US, it's bare
In a battle thought you had me, Screwface, hologrammed
You'se half-stickin' to death
To a me in disguise
Einstein dangerous mind
2 heads and 4 eyes
This man X
I'm known when I'm off my shade
Scorcher on my waist pull then I'll scorch your face
I'm like the copy-cat killer
Boss of strangling niggas in full figures
Proceed to rob the spot like Dillinger
Battle cap like Crenshaw
I'm saber-toothed coming at you
45th, the mind can't win wit' your .22
Get loose with henny rock 80 proof
In the hood, never sipping while I'm drinking my juice
Dance to my ritual, lower you into my seance
Bitch wearing Avon
Mr. Miyagi Wax On
I'm buff, you frontin' without that BK button stuff
Chain gang's the crew, that's why your whole shit gets laced up
With the mic as my staff
And then splash my witchcraft with full blast
Voodoo cut, Shotti screw cats

Verse 3: LA

When I'm lifted
Twisted, dusted,  kid I'm busted
On any demon puffing hydro, can't be trusted
Lusted lyrical flood, filthy like mud
DARKMAN IS KING, lampin' on my throne of blood
Lynch men, verbal henchmen, kickin' your door in
Thrash your script, splittin' your skin, rippin' your organs
Triple darkness, La Trafficante, rib juggler
Snake eyes dedicated undercover smuggler
As I cut you
I slice your brain right without the mic
Vivid literature pictures shine like four nine lights
Time in space, classic head-bands, suffocate
Call me Chester, for adolescent rappers I rape
Then fuck 'em great
I hold crack like your ass
Lick shots from the tech then jet through the wet grass
Bubble work like a bath
Darkman entity, since cannabis
Lyrics partin' the Caribbean Sea
Do your history, the dark seed will make you ears bleed
Talking 'bout hitting raps, bitch sit back and hit your weed
La can walk through walls stand straight up in fire
Look at your eyes look at my eyes pussy
And tell me who's higher
Dark vampire, guard you now like a gun
Rolling with nine rich niggas and I'm bound to be the tenth one

Verse 4: Shotti

Read my jungle
Rastafari big shot predator
Detonator blowin' up city blocks
With a large watt
About six crops
That's high potent killers on each corner
With guns ready for smoking
Sing sing Indian head honcho
Yo mafioso got foiled by Screw Castro
Operation stick em, my technique will be the spearmint
For my alliance I attach strength of ten lions
What you trying facing this sawed off iron
Adjustable punk fashion take out your whole bat
My plan to wrap this town like Saran
All I need is guns and a few good men
Shotti, ill like Scarface with a key to shoot somebody
Don't tempt me, my fingers itchy
Who's coming with me, I'm a hit the
First enemy who's feelin' filthy
Size 'em up break 'em down I'm guilty
My sons is wit' me
Shot like 150 watts, invincible like Kung-Fu brothers
With my sing-sing shot
You form something that can't be stopped
Got a plot to fuck up your snot box with a shot
What!

Outro:

Sing-sing
Knaw what I mean
LA The Darkman
Shot these fool faced keep your boots laced
Many many fakes and gun rules
M-A-D, wealthy
Killa Bees
