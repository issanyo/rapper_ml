[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo
Once, once again
Know what I'm saying?

[Hook]
Darkman stay on the street with a tool
For these devil workers wit' gats and these ignorant fools
Find yourself in the Hudson rocking ce-ment shoes
Middle East, Michigan Grand Rap and gun rule

[Verse 1]
Me and my man contemplating on these future operations
For night clubs two four shit packed like cases
I'm nineteen paid young can only get better
Got cheese in the war trying to see enormous cheddar
Fuck a Gucci sweater stay Wu-Wear, fly polo
Pepe jeans new boots kid labeled Asolo
Rolled for dolo, killed from the east
Me and Reef left them twenty hour stole four bricks 100 G's
Twenty-five a piece straight in they mind that's what it's like
Peace to my man Sed who got hit on New Jersey's turnpike
I send a kite, with a hundred in your money order
Hold it down in your cage see you back at headquarters
Everything is fine La blow spots like landmines
Do the knowledge as I kick seven deadly signs
I'm the Glock that'll make city streets boondocks
The industry is calling me like Pookie with rocks
And I can't stop, cocoa plants grow in large crops
Darkman east coast hip hop pad lock
I'm determined to kill the mic like Jews and Germans
Shoot a shell through your chest to leave your ribcage burning
While you smiling I got forty-five to life on Riker's Island
49507 what you dialing
Fight faster twisting up deluxe Dutchmaster
Enter my Peninsula script it might thrash you
With impact, of a two hundred pound weight
Being chased by Wu-wolves with no way to escape
Do it from the mouth, crush bones cause this is my house
And I'm prejudice against non-Clansmen like whiteys down south

[Hook]
Darkman stay on the street with a tool
For these devil workers wit' gats and these ignorant fools
Find yourself in the Hudson rocking ce-ment shoes
Middle East, Michigan Grand Rap and gun rule

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I'm hungry like 3 lions starving in a crack house
With guns galore taking Jake to war
Don't challenge the sword from here to Vancouver
I stand with this Lex Luger stashed in the Cruiser
Going through you like needles from Phd's
On any demon, drunken with 41 thieves
Crack fiends drug dealers and killers flood the block
DT's with binoculars surveillance the drop
It's crazy hot, little Nookie got hit with a shot
From a 4-4 caliber government Glock
In front of the shop, equivalent to gun galleries
I dedicate to Allah, show and prove I'm doing these
Trying to see these 100 Gs, if I hold nine I freaked it
To getting all this money is a ancient Chinese secret
Delinquent, lockin' shit down like a precinct
I'm flipping on you MCs for no fucking reason

[Hook]
Darkman stay on the street with a tool
For these devil workers wit' gats and these ignorant fools
Find yourself in the Hudson rocking ce-ment shoes
Middle East, Michigan Grand Rap and gun rule

[Break]
Yeah, You know what time it is
Gun Rules, You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Word Up, Yo, yo

[Verse 3]
I spent about 20 Gs on weed as I proceed
To drug deal my way to 100 Gs
Stacking loot, known to catch blood on my boots
Trafficante burners blazing outta six hundred coupes
So what you stup'? I freeze niggas' lines to sub-zero
Protect all devil killers like Robert Shapiro
The La brings action packed heat like De Niro
I'm ancient in this rap shit king like a Pharaoh
A terror, terminate Schwarzenegger style
Kill a man, and a woman, MC and a child
Shit is wild, I hold niggas hostage like Riker's Isle
Gotta deceptive, murderous money getting smile
I'm the judge while you on trial, Supreme, Killa Bee
A serpent La can bite the whole industry, Darkman
..Motherfucker

[Hook]
Darkman stay on the street with a tool
For these devil workers wit' gats and these ignorant fools
Find yourself in the Hudson rocking ce-ment shoes
Middle East, Michigan Grand Rap and gun rule

[Break]
Gun rule, Gun rule

[Hook]
Darkman stay on the street with a tool
For these devil workers wit' gats and these ignorant fools
Find yourself in the Hudson rocking ce-ment shoes
Middle East, Michigan Grand Rap and gun rule

[Outro]
Triple Darkness
Sing-sing
