['Five Deadly Venoms' sample]
I came from a wealthy family
I joined the clan because I wanted to learn
A special kung-fu and be a real expert
But in actual fact I've just become a killer, killing
That's all I know death every day, another

[Intro: La the Darkman]
Gun Rule. We gon' make this spicy
It's La Traficante right here
You know? And we gon' do it like this
Yeah. Darkman

[Verse 1: La the Darkman]
Watch the Corleone who give neck ties and puff bones
Stick Arabs for the crystals like Indiana Jones
Witness La, hands of stone, on this action packed odyssey
Majesty, living out the golden book prophecy
Unstoppable, Iron Sheik of rap speaks
Blaze a tree in the street, blue and gray Benz jeep
Tazmanian, rebel, new Wu tycoon
Two thousand-five lyrics, you'll catch on soon
Young entrepreneur, blow Macs to go to war
On tour, blowing smoke out the four by four
Enjoying life, I don't know a man who live twice
Cee-Lo king, shooting dice, holding Glaciers of Ice
Playing '97 Madden at the Loft in Manhattan
While I get blitzed and rich, watch him run short flicks
With a bad chick, La been raw since eighty-six
On the block, new kicks with chocolate skunk nicks
Son, I'm fortunate to still be here, shells is close
City Lights, La The Dark, stay concealing the toast
'Cause thieves who deceive get loot the most
But thieves that see me are left Holy as the Ghost

[Hook: La the Darkman] (x2)
For that lucci, it's all about that lucci
For that lucci, it's all about that
Getting money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays, kid lucci

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
I'd rather die if I'm not living fly, Now Y
Can't get a job with a corporate, fuck it, I'm getting high
Suicide committed in cells, dwellers square as hell
Children can't have a pants with impairable bells
Suffering in a jail, I don't recognize a soul
Each one with a cold war story that has to be told
Behold the son of God with a scroll
Flame throwing lyrics, niggas best stop, drop and roll
Lyrics is gold, Darkman pushing up in the land
Hit a spot for a Rolex watch, two thousand grams
Then I dip, 'cause loose lip sure sink ships
But in this drug rap, I bang like the Bloods and the Crips
Guns and clips seem to make my state rotate
Stay on corners till morning, drinking, busting at jakes
Holding my weight, now a purchase 'bout two cakes
When I cook 'em and drop 'em it equal Cali earthquakes
I escape, bagging work, pawn porcelain plates
Get ill like Al Capone after sniffing an eighth
And I'm straight from the halls of Hell, Sing-Sing
Stick a spear through your chest like an ear and an earring

[Hook: La the Darkman] (x2)
For that lucci, it's all about that lucci
For that lucci, it's all about that
Getting money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays, kid lucci

[Verse 3: La the Darkman]
Niggas' sneakers and overnight knight crawler creepers
Crack junkies on the Jones planning a heist to get ya speakers
And that Acura, same soldiers attacking ya
Desert chameleon, no civilian, better know as Blackula
Son, I'm 'bout to see about a half a mil'
With twenty niggas perfecting in kung-fu skills
And fuck bitches, they only want they name on my will
And all you half-ass rappers, kid, you need to be killed
My shit is ill, the ills gave birth to my brain
I represent on all tracks like the Number Four train
Maintain, it's all about the cheese you gain
I get the studies, then the money and the business, fuck the fame

[Hook: La the Darkman] (x2)
For that lucci, it's all about that lucci
For that lucci, it's all about that
Getting money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays, kid lucci

[Outro]
*ringing*
Trying to be broke black
Not me, like these cats say
Fuck that, what you mean, fuck that
How ya live now, fuck that
Fuck you shining right now
You shine, you just beeming
Seed grow up, for him and shit
