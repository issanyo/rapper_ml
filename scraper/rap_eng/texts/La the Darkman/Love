[Chorus: sample] (x4)
If you had the strength to walk out that door

[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah, 4th Disciple
Word up, you know women dunn?
Can't live with 'em
Can't live without 'em, uhh
But one thing they have to understand
Is that knowledge is first
Word up, You know
Love

[Verse 1: La The Darkman]
We started off back in high school my new boo
She stunted at first but I seen right through
Her whole chemistry so I behaved rather friendly
A fly rude boy and she seen the truth in me
She was a natural beautiful skin and white teeth
Her sandals displayed her feet
I like her technique she wasn't in the street most of the time
Pure personality which labeled her a dime
She had a virgin mind, style with good conversation
Knew the important virtue of patience
Stay wonderful respectable middle class queen
But I ran the street been indulged with other things
Time passed our relationship elevated
She wrote my man letters while he was incarcerated
I remember we thought she was pregnant one time
I stayed by her side and she wouldn't let me rhyme
It was love at first touch for me and this miss
She only complained about the time that I spent
In her hands, I told her love understand as a man
I gotta live out my plan providing for my family is a must
And all I ask from my woman is love and trust
My life is difficult being a businessman artist
I might be out of state but I think of you regardless
I'm bogged, I look into your eyes and get hard
I'll make you my planet and I'll be the God
Don't make me choose between you and my career
Gotta take this opportunity love while it's here
I care, completion is man woman and child
Montego Bay trips just to make you smile
I know every woman's dream is to have a ring
A strong man to hold and the finer things
So you can cook and clean keep the Power-U tight
Be a wifey I'm coming home on the next flight
But if you can't respect my laws and be what I need
The God has to leave 'cause life will proceed, I still love

[Outro: La the Darkman, Mala Campbell, (sample)]
(walk out that door), word up
If you had the strength to walk out that door
To all the boos I still love, you know
(I gave you all I had and all I have is love
When you're in love, when you're in love)
I gave you all I had and all I have is love
When you're in love, when you're in love
When you're in love, ohoh
I gave you all I had
I gave you all I had

[Outro: sample]
If you had the strength to walk out that door
If you had the strength to walk out that door
If you had the strength to walk out that door
If you had the strength to walk out that door
If you had the strength to walk out that door
If you had the strength to walk out that door
If you had the strength to walk out that door
If you had the strength...
