[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane, life in the fast lane
Man, I ain't got nothing to lose, everything to gain
Life in the fast lane, life in the fast lane
Man, I ain't got nothing to lose, everything to gain

[50 Cent]
Either you with me or against me, man, ain't nothing change
Nigga, you, go against the grain, I'll make you, walk with a cane
Now nigga now, who you gon' blame, when shit ain't the same
Nigga nobody hears your name, you got down wit a gang
Oh thirty, one blood, ya'll niggas do your thing
You got these felonies, fuck it, go out with a bang
Ya'll niggas wanna hang, with niggas that, filthy rich
They ain't even got to talk, to take your bitch
One look was all it took, she seen the Benz-o
She seen them TV's, and them big ol' rizzos

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
Another Benz or a hoopty, I'mma scoop me a coupie
Only bad bitches suit me, I'm a dog, like Snoopy
It's LaSon, the don, keep a gat in my palm
I'm a motherfuckin' killer, put my hand on the Qu'ran
Seven sixty BM, think like Iceberg Slim
And I got a broad look like the first Lil' Kim
Taking late night trips, on the highway to pump
And I'm feeling like I got my whole life in a trunk
I'm a certified hustler, purple kush crusher
Boy, try to play with my paper, I'mma bust ya
Homey, get with me, cuz I move that work quickly
It's that nigga, La Sing-Sing, and that chamber 50, muthafucka

[Chorus 2X]
