Contemplating on riches, same place I rest my fitted
As coincidental as that is I wear my heart on my sleeve
But bitch you see it, got my moms name in it
So don't ever think you getting chips, Yeah So
Say I'm tripping cause I blew up on a zip in two days, huh
Mad cause you still smoking haze, huh
Drop a few videos, mixtapes, and
Now this young nigga got your bitch up in craze, huh
Heir Gang, Fast Money, what I'm screaming out
And by the fucking title you can see what my team about
Head honcho, the commander and chief
Executive decisions, Nas before he fucking Kelis
HD what they call me in the streets
D-A-dolla-sign-H is what she call me in the sheets
I get's it popping, lyrically I'm [?], saying I'm a weed rapper
Comedian ass niggas, they talking knee slappers
Weed is at the bottom of the jar
I'm rolling papers man, I ran out of cigars
Get you high like a package of that raw
And sorry this is the music, break the speakers in your car
Speakers in your car

Or maybe I'm just fucked up
(Or maybe I'm just fucked up)
Or maybe I'm just fucked up
(Or maybe I'm just fucked up)
Or maybe I'm just fucked up
(Or maybe I'm just fucked up)
Or maybe I'm just fucked up
So
