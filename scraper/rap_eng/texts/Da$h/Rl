[Intro]

[Hook]
Left, Right
Right, Left
Left, Right
Move like, soldiers, all night
My type, pop off, on sight
He might, just take, yo' life
White cup, red sprite, no ice
No hype, my mind, so trife
I like, counting dough, shooting dice
That's right, that's right, that's right

[Verse]
I been on, where I'm going, yeah
I'm in constant motion, locomotive, nigga
And the motive money, get it sinning, bitch
And I sealed the pound, 'fore I sent it, pussy
I was your hitter, your pistol rented, yeah
I heard that's your wife, I think I hit it, sorry
Cruising through the city, wheels is spinning
Nigga gave the lawyer cases, and get acquitted, yeah, so
Shoot it like niggas the family
Spin it like food at the county
And snatch the bitch
She the classic bitch
With the nasty shit to come down me
I'm just a hound from the pound
Dolla a dog from the yard
Choppers get held like guitars
[No media shooting your stars?]

[Hook]
Left, Right
Right, Left
Left, Right
Move like, soldiers, all night
My type, pop off, on sight
He might, just take, yo' life
White cup, red sprite, no ice
No hype, my mind, so trife
I like, counting dough, shooting dice
That's right, that's right, that's right
