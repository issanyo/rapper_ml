[Verse 1: Da$H]
Young never been dumb, hunnit round drum
Feeling like the Iron Sheik
Global gang, fast money made man
Bitch we the secret society
Young niggas, hammers twice they age
And I know that they gon' ride for me
I could get you wacked for a quarter P
I make the right call and you gon' die for free
Who the fuck you niggas thought it was
D-O-double-L-A, robbing all the plugs
Mami with me, saying fuck her with the slugs
So I'm drugging and thugging, sinning and winning
I'm paid for speaking english, you would think I passed
Chewing on these flats, burning up this gas
Drinking on this mud, thinking will I last
Why I'm moving fast, getting to this cash
Still with that action
I still get it bracking, I'm still really macking
I still get it popping
I'm still on that block, going broke is no option
Still got that work
Its 8th letter 'til dirt, niggas going berserk
We got it for cheap
Niggas fuck with the squad, you be dead in a week

[Verse 2: Chynna]
You wanna tell me the definition of real rap
And differentiate trill rap and drill rap
If I left it up to you niggas, you prolly kill rap
You could thank your guardian angels that Chizzy still rap
Cause niggas needing more then some helping hands
Whole bunch of yes men, lying to you, fronting on the next man
Knowing damn well that's they best man
Back an fourth an round an round an never was your goddamn
Let me sip this chamomile and chill
Getting turnt up, still all indecisive 'bout the pills
Feeling burnt out, wishing that another bitch would
Or her nigga will, acting like they really in the field
Fuck you to do when they don't keep it real
Tell me what the deal fool, tell me how you feel
Cause I'm feeling shade, they ask me about the moves I make
And my pocket change (tell me 'bout yo pocket change, nigga)
Is it cause I copped an ounce, then I rolled an eighth
Then I sold a half, sold a dime of shake
Stayed away from weight, gained some weight
Never stopped for breaks, when it's fuck the cake
Fuck you saying, counting bands, selling Xans with my mans
As it stands, I'm the plug should you need one
Niggas on the 'gram selling grams, you should see them
Shit is like a rerun, now they screaming "free them heathens"
Never any better, on my carpe diem
