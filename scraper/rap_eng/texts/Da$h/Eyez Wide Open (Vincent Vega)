So high I'm 'bout to die, a nigga so convinced
Blunt lit, got a pez dispenser full of opiates
Eyes blood shot while I'm bumping this Flying Lotus shit
Ain't even in my 20s nigga, who else you know that's flowing this
Nobody, looking for me at a show, prolly
[?] make your bitch, cause this money make me crazy
Say I'm donuts, your bitch suck and fuck the whole team
Stay sedated while I'm chasing more cream
Fried up by this good green, Cali medical from the dispensary
She was serving me weed and now she texting me
Simple niggas would think I'm worried about her sexting me
Know I go back East and I'ma get that killer sent to me
Trill, keep it real from my toes to my crown
Only young nigga from Jersey they say putting it down
Hz, counting faces while I'm getting blazed
My mother said it was a phase and now I'm out here getting paid
Yeah so...
