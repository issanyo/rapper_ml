[Verse 1: Boldy James]
I'm a lunatic, I got 5 on it once the doobie lit
We was lockin' my room door stuffin the Boosie clips
Runnin' with hooligans I put in my work
Wipe the slugs and guns off, with the tip of my shirt
Two .23's, when we ride on our enemies
And hit em up if they don't hit me up first
And my army fatigued, it's still gunpowder on the sleeve
Niggas get shot every day B pull down ya skirt
Before I lift it up, show the whole world ya pussy
And how you niggas been some bitches since birth
Cause we them Sig Sauer boys hittin' em where it hurts
Twistin nigga's cap back and pop a nigga
With a squig and a squirt
He dug his own grave, I'm just revealin' the dirt
Got some bullets to chase a nigga, to the end of the earth
Until we meet again, I think with death ima flirt
Give her that old evil grin and my devilish smirk

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Fuck y'all niggas what y'all wanna do
Bumpin' my new shit mobbin' with the crew
Stuck to the blueprint and ride with the tool
Let me know if it's a problem cause the solving we could do

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Dead bullies and Red Bull is all in his stomach
With a couple bitches with whom relations ended abruptly
Grab the mickey and the coaster and sit it
Now I been sober a minute, ho tell your soldiers forget it
Spit it as cold as the frigid, dare me to host it and shit
Just carry the flow to the clinic, carry the coast on my shoulders
Various hoes in the whip and they blowin' smoke at the chauffeur
Carry the dope in they britches, bury a foe in the ocean
I can't help it it's Tan Cressida, gram sellers
Pantera records and bodies stuffed in the damp cellar
Far from the fronting, my niggas was in the back
Yelling cause we came from nothing like everything that you can't tell us
Speak soft, sock a fan, shut the camera off
Ramp camp Camelot, canon cocked, lick a shot
Bop, bop liquor slosh bottom of the belly
Bars lock hard hitting like they squabbing with the celly

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Fuck y'all niggas what y'all wanna do
Bumpin' my new shit mobbin' with the crew
Stuck to the blueprint and ride with the tool
Let me know if it's a problem cause the solving we could do

[Verse 3: Da$h]
Smokin' all the green, exhalin' dragon breath up out my nasal
Order steak, rosemary with the basil
It's too rare, get it off my table, way I pimp
Should of stuck with the shrimp, dick stuck to her lips
The money stuck to my thumbs, I'm spittin' rounds like a drum
Bitch said her man was a bum and he think he got that bag
Get her high and dog her ass, she tellin' me 'bout homie stash
I listen up and roll my grass, before the blunt was even ashed
I hit my homie on the jack like
Just got the word on what the lick read
Essex county, and he sitting on 'bout six Ps
Is you 'bout it? he say "for sure" we rushed to move
Riding with my top gun like Tom fucking Cruise
No license behind the wheel, blowing red signs
I push that red line before fed time
Get the flip and write a verse or two
Nah, us niggas never heard of you
Denzel in training day, motherfucker I'm getting surgical
