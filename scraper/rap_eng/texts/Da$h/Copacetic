[Verse]
Got me thinking like I need that new Mazarati truck
Thinking like I need a lot of bucks
Thinking like talking that fly shit is gon' get that thottie fucked
Thinking like she fucked a lot of us
Thinking like I need to cop me some hammers
Thinking like free all my dogs out the slammer
Thinking like I'm losing track
Of all of these groupies, this show money, all of these cameras
Thinking like I need to find me a grower
Thinking like I need a bitch from Samoa
Thinking that she should respect me like H.O.V.A
Thinking that rifle would sound like a mower
Thinking that I just believe I'm the realest
Thinking that all of these pistols conceiling
Thinking that all of them cases appealing
Thinking of stacking this bread to the ceiling
Thinking like, where was you when I was struggling?
Thinking like I was just sleeping on floors
Thinking like I was just resting on couches
Thinking like I was just kicking in doors
Thinking like I was just robbing from houses
Bounce to this, know it
You can't deny my influence
Everything they bragging 'bout, man I do it
You talking money, then prove it

[Outro]
Everything is copacetic
Everything is copacetic
And I never did regret it
Everywhere I got the leaded
Everything is copacetic
Everything is copacetic
Fuck on your bitch just to prove it
Everything is copacetic
