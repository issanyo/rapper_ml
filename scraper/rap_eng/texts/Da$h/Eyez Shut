[Verse 1]
On revolt like Nat Turner, problems on my back burner
In between the Lauren slacks, cause I'm with all of that
I'm twacked from that flight back to the land, roll an imported pack
Your life is what it costs, in case a nigga could afford a jet
Riding through the streets, you hiding if it's beef
I'm sliding on your freak, I got it for the cheap
Dying every week, the title of a Sheikh
Gotta play to win, product of the set, my mama from the Sack
Shit, all I know is Jerz, I'm plotting on you birds all lacking
Remember days I had a dutch, a motherfucker couldn't even put a sack in
Meeko was a down bitch, Johnny wasn't ratting
Show showed me my first twenty racks off of fucking trapping
And now I'm like what happened, nigga's is acting, acting like bitches
And these bitches be trapping these nigga's with fucking babies
And my mama always told me a nigga was fucking lazy
'Til they paid me for my words, people saying I'm crazy still

[Hook]
To be doper than Saddam, believe the nation of Islam
(At the time I’m more than high)
Fuck the police and them dogs sniffing that dope up out yo car
(I tend to make habits when I try stuff)
Think they overstep they boundaries
(What’s on my mind is more than fried)
OJ, not guilty, that's how they found me
(But I ain't afraid to die cause you see more with your eyez shut)
Doper than Saddam, believe the nation of Islam
(You see more with your eyez shut)
Fuck the police and them dogs sniffing that dope up out yo car
(You see more with your eyez shut)
Think they overstep they boundaries
(You see more with your eyez shut)
OJ, not guilty, that's how they...
(I ain't afraid to die cause you see more with your eyez...)

[Verse 2]
My brain unstable as the cables in the tub
Three-legged tables, a baby born on drugs
It got me questioning everything, like what's stronger, a bible or a snub
Since when did being dumb make you a thug
Since when did being smart make you soft
And why when nigga's get around police do they talk
I came up out my mother running, nigga never walked
Chalk me up in fucking prison pose
I ain't say it's allergies every time that I itch my nose
Flipping flows like I'm Tony Hawk, he pick and roll like he Johnny Starks
Hit it twice, forget I'm smoking with nigga's and end up facing a blunt
Saw his face on a bitch, second nature to some
The world is crazy, got me feeling like no place for the young
Scared of raising a son, afraid of wearing my *static* never
Catching three to five just to stay alive
At birth we're fitted for our suit and ties, H'z, nigga
