[Hook]
Momma said be careful son
Well momma I'm on one
Got my Newports and I roll one
We gon' flip and let the dough come

[Verse 1: Muggs]
Day by day youngin' getting smart
Come to think, shit, I'm walking art
Tryna line me up but can't catch the part
Broke together, fuck that rich apart shit
All this pain in my heart shit
Gotta nigga leanin' on my Mr. Clark shit
The game fucked, got me blowin' on my cartridge
So much drive that I had to go and park it
Now I'm boostin, but I'm stealin' so I'm losin'
That's how I feel test myself so I'm improvin'
Tired of runnin, all my life ya boy been movin'
Gotta constantly tell myself we gettin' through it
Ratchets on the left side, Henny on the right
Lighter on the dashboard, spark 'em at the light
Jake on the corner gotta catch me on a flight
FA$TMONEY slowin' up, only on the Sprite
If any first niggas know how we go
Fuck hoes, get dough and some mo'
Any nigga that'll pose that's foe
Eighth letter, couple lifers that's 'lo

[Verse 2: Da$H]
My love for the game still intact, get paid for making them tracks
Still I'm exchanging a pack, cause I ain't aight, I need stacks
Mother saying I've changed, content with being insane
It's tears when she hearing my name, and I can't lie I'm ashamed
But I'm just scared for my brothers
Closer we get to this money, farther we get from each other
Closer I get to my dreams the farther I get from my woman Grandma say I need patience, and I'm just thinking, what's coming
Or what the fuck I'm becoming, I'm just pouring my syrup
Percocet in my body, shit, I'm just searching for clearance
My niggas say I've got problems and I ain't trying to hear it
All this pain on my brain, my nigga, I know that you hear it
Rap shit like crabs in a bucket
Feel like taking this barrel inside this bucket and dumping
Numb to it all, don't know which way to feel like I'm drumming
When they box a nigga up, hope I ain't do it for nothing
Hope I ain't do it for nothing, no I ain't bluffing
All of this syrup I'm guzzling, yeah, so
