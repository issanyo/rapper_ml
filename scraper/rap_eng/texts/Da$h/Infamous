Please don't think cause I smoke a lil more than a lot that I'm slipping
Any point in time a nigga tripping
About fifteen deep, me and my gang of misfits
We been smoking, we been sipping, and we looking for the mischief
My word is bond, we keep it calm as long as you play it cool
Just like the breeze, inhaling weed, exhaling jewels
Like the logo on my hooded sweatshirt
Niggas bitches giving head until they fucking necks hurt
Couldn't please her, now she skeezing, know you did your best work
For what it's worth the haze was just a phase, more sour, more purp
Just stay one up on your pimping, stay out other niggas business
Roll and smoke up on ya winnins, only worrying 'bout them digits
Do you feel me?
