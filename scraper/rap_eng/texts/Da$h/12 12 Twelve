This my burial scene, nigga

[Verse]
High off a substance, glad I said that I wasn't
And now I got a reason to try and grab her ass in public
Like fuck it, can't say I'm new to this, must say I'm true to this
I'm tryna get stupid rich, like Ludacris with braids, bitch
Get out my way bitch, t-bone and crash the car
Try and swerve in my lane shit, you think I won't then try me Speak! is the man behind me, they dreaming of Gwen Stefani
Or when she used to sing for No Doubt
No doubt, I still want that bitch throat now
See her later, me and the pussy have a showdown (straight)
The game I raid to my whole team, got a dinner plate
Off a pint of your grandpa moonshine, you niggas minute maid
Getting paid to live it
Although a few of my niggas still getting paid to weigh and zip it
Distribute shipments, light up the splidiff
Can't learn to die and lay like [?]
Niggas talking, I really did it
Continue business, nigga
