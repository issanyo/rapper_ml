Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Young nigga put it down from across the water
Going deep up in somebody daughter
Hz global nigga, know me and my nigga Porter
Do I gotta drug problem? baby kinda sorta
No lacking, putting it down for the East side
Muhfuckas know how we ride, OG backwood for the leaf high
Hits of Lucy got a nigga with the three eyes
That's my word though, coupe it be swervin'
Popping them percs, think I'm going berserk
Moving real fast cause that cash be the purpose
Most of my niggas still trafficking work
All my moms do is ask me if it's worth it
And I tell her every second
Blackout Boyz, nigga don't you dare forget it
Put it on my stone, if I said it then I meant it
Got the world coming to me, muhthafucka I'mma get it
And I'm gone

[Hook]
See a nigga gettin' known (Gettin' known)
See a nigga gettin' known, and I'm smokin' on that strong
See a nigga gettin' known (Gettin' known) (x2)
Young nigga but I'm grown (But I'm grown)
See a nigga gettin' known (Gettin' known) (x2)
All this po' got me gone (Got me gone)
See a nigga getting known (Gettin' known) (x3)
Yeah, see a nigga too shaded (Shaded x3)
Muhfuckas hate that I made it (Made it x3)
Yeah, see a nigga too shaded (Shaded x3)
Muhfuckas hate that I made it

[Verse 2]
Yeah, but fuck what y'all say
See, I been about the dollar since I came up out the womb
Been about the drama, gon' show you to your tomb
Child of the night, came out in the moon
Always into trouble every time I left my room
When they clipped my county bracelet, hit the radio station
Said fuck LAPD and whoever wear the blues
Put one in your daughter, sent the bitch to fuck the crew
Nigga what it do, quarter ounce of shrooms
Sandwich bag of pills, 'bout to crack the seal
Looking for a mil' but I probably find a thrill first, nigga
You fucking know nigga
Said I'm lookin for a mil' but I probably find a thrill first
Never learned to ask, only learned to steal first
Yeah, all my niggas learned to kill first
Global, bitch
