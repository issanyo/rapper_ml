[Intro]
Rio
Aye, so, aye
Said I want what I need, aye, aye, aye
Said I want what I need me, what I, aye, aye, aye, so
Said I want what I need me, what I, so

[Hook]
Said I want what I need me, what I want, hey
Soon as I hit it from the back, leave out the front, hey
We smokin' all the dead opps just like the blunt, hey
You talkin' 'bout what you gon' do, I know you won't, hey
Said I want what I need me, what I want, hey
Soon as I hit it from the back, leave out the front, hey
We smokin' all the dead opps just like the blunt, hey
You talkin' 'bout what you gon' do, I know you won't, hey

[Verse]
The way I'm movin' in this bitch, you gotta hear me
The Devil in me, bustin' off this pale and Remy
I'm talkin' to your hoe to pipe her, she gon' see me
Ain't got no chopper but it's 30 in the semi
I'm poppin' out, some motherfuckers know it's crucial
I'm countin' paper with my niggas just like usual
You talkin' hotter, then my partner, he might shoot you
I told that bitch, "I'm anything but what you used to"
We got the Tec-9 clips flipped just like the Pyrex
Fuck hoes, get chips, we gotta lot of haters
Smoke weed, big sips, puffin' a lot of thraxx
Still got shit, Glock cocked shit, Global Gang, so on top shit

[Hook]
Said I want what I need me, what I want, hey
Soon as I hit it from the back, leave out the front, hey
We smokin' all the dead opps just like the blunt, hey
You talkin' 'bout what you gon' do, I know you won't, hey
Said I want what I need me, what I want, hey
Soon as I hit it from the back, leave out the front, hey
We smokin' all the dead opps just like the blunt, hey
You talkin' 'bout what you gon' do, I know you won't, hey
