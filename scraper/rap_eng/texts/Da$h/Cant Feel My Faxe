[Verse 1: Da$H]
I'm the reason why you rappers in extinction
Seen niggas whip work, no stove in the kitchen
Microwave the pyrex, butter turn to chicken
Family MOB ties like the road to perdition
Bitch it's Dolla or it's Dillinger, don't address me as nothin' else
Now cause I'm an artist, don't think my gun on the fuckin' shelf
This bitch say she love me, don't even love herself
Came on her face so many times, look like she tryna melt

[Verse 2: Robb Bank$]
I can get my dick sucked anyway you feel entitled
You ride waves, I got .wav files on Tidal
Robb in my black tee, Bank$ like Simon
Ruger gon' stutter, sing like American Idol
Shootin' from the side, you ain't go outside
You coolin' at your window, I know that you pipe

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$ & Da$H]
Like Eddy Murphy doin' life, a nigga gonna eat regardless
Know that the iron hot, could care less if you die or not
Dirt Nap Saibamen, bitch is you hearin' me?
Knowin' that you're scared of me, real nigga parody
Apple store gang member, iPhone thug, phone swung on 'em
Wait Da$H don't bust
Nigga don't wanna get touched by the boy, they think I'm crazy
I let them off easy, niggas die everyday B
Your bitch screamin' "slave me!"

[Verse: 4 Da$H & Robb Bank$]
Shit you would think it's Game of Thrones
Never left a thing at home, make thousands off of Boost Mobile
Chirp chirp, don't serve you if I don't know you
Test fuck nigga guarantee I will show you
Just how violent it get, lost my mind in this shit
I've kept it soo real sometimes I wish I lied in this bitch
