[Intro]
Still the same nigga that's with paper, still counting paper
Still beat the fucking blood up out a hating nigga
Still the same nigga that's with Porter, smoke a whole quarter
Pound take the plug down for the order nigga
Still the same nigga that's with Flee, thirty blunts in the V Global nigga, ride down if it's beef nigga
Still the same nigga that's with Cash, backwood full of grass Some chunky hoe, twelve in the stash bitch

[Verse]
All you motherfuckers know what DA$H on
No you don't, be a hand full of shit
My Gran prolly die if she knew
I'm off more pills than the medication hand
On the grip of a bimmer
Hitting corners like I'm Buns
Tommy Brown in the flesh
Pound for pound I'm the best
Know the crown be the set
Aiming at your wig, fuck a vest
Fuck the judge and the cops
Ain't my side you's a op
Slide through in the drop
Same nigga fuck the pack up
Snatch a nigga chain, get it back up
Bumping Yo Gotti, get your sack up
Now I got a Glock on me
Turn the house function to a block party
Fucking with me you are not shorty
'Lo down to my fucking dick, yeah they know
Young boys'll bust your head if you say so

[Hook]

Another bitch nigga got got
Knock knock
Another pussy nigga bitch getting popped
