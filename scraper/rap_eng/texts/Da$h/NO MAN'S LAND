Chapter One: Self Defense

[Verse]
Precise as a heart surgeon when I'm palmin' that pistol
Won't miss you like I seen you yesterday, it's something
Then someone press a button and the engine start
Part your head from your body if you try me
Like a sandal, trophy sittin' on the mantel
Gettin' sucked from [?], I'm up in Gucci sandals
Smoking Newies 'cause life is hard to handle
Blunts the size of fuckin' candles
As I channel a young Brad Norton, Mr. Know-It-All
And since the money was the protocol, I'm so involved
I've been a terrorist since the tontine era
And now my weed from where from the palm trees-

Chapter Two: No Man's Land

[Chorus]
What's the difference between your needs and your desires?
Walkin' on water as I'm rollin' on that fire
Funerals the only time for suit and ties
Weed in my cuticles and blood up in my eyes, yeah
What's the difference between your needs and your desires?
Walkin' on water as I'm rollin' on that fire
Funerals the only time for suit and ties
Weed in my cuticles and blood up in my eyes

[Verse]
They say that trouble gon' follow you
I'm vacuum sealing, sell that pound for double, only logical
Crustaceans in my pasta bowl
See what you feel impossible, to me it ain't no obstacle
I'm just tryna be a, made man-
