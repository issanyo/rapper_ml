This one's for my drug users who puff buddah
Always high in school screaming "fuck tutors, I must do this"
To be honest joint ain't give me a choice
My lil brother Stevie don't rap, so I give him a voice
In return he coordinate all are moves to bring us riches
Fucking bitches, tripping suckers in they ditches, do you feel me?
I hit the top, they'll try to kill me, I'm a Kennedy
Nowadays my enemies always tryna be friends with me, so?
Stick my hand out and I dame these niggas
Saying they coming from my clan but we don't claim these niggas, nah
Can't lie man I don't blame these niggas
Seeing we bossing, women is flawless, no limits my fortress
Higher than the bitch who sending pics to my cordless
Ain't ask her but the caption read "no bra and no shorts"
Running game on these hoes, I play these bitches for sport
My team is "18-0" you tryna run on my court
Yeah, yeah, you tryna run on my court
My team is "18-0" I play these bitches for sport

Light the dope up x4
