Yeah so

Free Castro, Hz

[Verse 1: Da$H]
You looking at the immaculate conception of a God, bitch
Gain my knowledge getting high and watching mob flicks
I'm living like a king, you just a pawn trick
Chilling with some bitch up outta Florida and she porn thick
Head good too, did a semester at Miami U
And once you niggas heard my camp was on, you knew your camp was through
Smoking weed, sipping on syrup like I got the flu
This how we living, like '96, shit, I thought you knew
My name Da$H, love, and this here is the H'z crew
And if you fuck with us then we could take you places boo
True, shit, where my nigga $ha Hef
Smoked about a ounce today, I only got a dub left
Catch me up at Sway, yeah, that's the fucking club, stretched out
High as fuck, half a cup of Rem' up in my mouth
Prolly a singer or actress sitting on that couch
And just to think I'm living shit that I could go without

[Hook: Da$H]
Tryna be Vito, ended up being Santino
I'm sipping promethazine yo, and smoking on sour diesel
Counting money with machines though, I'm repping hard for my team know
And I go out like a G yo, know, I did it for the green hoe

[Verse 2: RetcH]
It's hard feeling like a rap nigga
When you smoking out the front like it's the trap, nigga
And you always running in and out the trap, nigga
Posted with a couple of a street savvy trap niggas
Huh, and we get it how we live
Fucking bad bitches raw but we ain't tryna have no kids
I mean, call it living on the edge
And living with my moms is like living with the feds
Yeah, no wonder I ain't there much
We falling off, but man, I don't really care much
We live together, but convo, we never shared much
But nah I don't cry my nigga, just roll the tears up
Huh, and then I pass it to my homie
'Bout to drop a tape and call it real niggas only
Cause I don't want you listening my nigga if you phony
Cause you end up knowing a lil too much like a cody
And thats a no b
