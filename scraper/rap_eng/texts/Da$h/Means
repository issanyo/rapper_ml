[Verse 1]
Living life like a pirate, took it, nah I ain't buy it
Back then they ain't mind us, been going hard since a minor
On point like a stylus, you ain't a thug, you a stylist
Act wild, trey pound, put your brain on a diet
Half my niggas demented, I'm going hard as cement is
Count my first mil' at 20 so that I never forget it
Thinking back how we started, came alive in that darkness
Duffing random niggas out, see who hitting the hardest
Bagging O's in apartments, and selling shows like a partridge
Breaking bread with my niggas, we multiplying them figures
Only time that I fucked her is if her face on a pin up
Busting six packs at a time, I got the trap doing sit-ups
You know my face cause it's flawless, lawless, I look like a bandit
A cowboy with the pistol, snub sound like a canon
I've been getting so high, think I'ma crash at the landing
Won't deal with them answers, so with the devil I'm dancing
Have you ever bought everything you want
Heard some niggas screaming sentences, what you had thought

[Chorus]
Guess what I did, cop the foreign
Hop in, hop out, brand new Glock out, bitch it's real lit
I saw your bitch, I thought I only wanted mouth and I still hit
No tussling, we busting shit, they shuffling, who you dealing with

[Verse 2]
It's Mr. Top-Tier, still the nigga who the opps fear
Lying in your raps like you got squares, I woulda robbed you
Twisted mind, I'm sipping Henney out the big bottle
Full throttle when it's fast lane living
You rap niggas could always get it if you asking opinions
Never hesitating when it's come to spending them digits
It's still drop top shawty, new Glock 40, and this bitch let it off
I fucked the party up and shit cause I'm a big baller, shot caller
40 inch rims, on the Impala, rolling, getting lit tonight
You niggas act up, getting sprayed tonight
I'm on the highway, getting money the fly way
And it gotta be a bag, to-day
(Bag today, bag today)

[Chorus]
Guess what I did, cop the foreign
Hop in, hop out, brand new Glock out, bitch it's real lit
I saw your bitch, I thought I only wanted mouth and I still hit
No tussling, we busting shit, you shuffling, who you deal with
