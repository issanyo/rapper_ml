[Intro: (Da$H) & RetcH]
Smoke your fuckin' life away
(Smoke the sherm)
Kill yourself
(Hit the sherm)
Get fuckin' murdered if you 'bout that life, nigga
(Light that wooly up, nigga)
Shoot yourself in the fuckin' head if you 'bout that shit, nigga
Retweet that nigga, like

[Verse 1: RetcH]
Showed up to court shirtless
Fuck the charges, we got money in the furnace
Fresh off retirement, Brenda brought in the lemonade
She 40 and she drive a Audi
The sweatsuit it was sporty
Your life is corny

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Applaud me
Snuff the dame, went threatening with suspension
Extort him for his pension, he learned a lesson
Ingest the Lucy, if life's a bitch, caress the coochie
My breath and hold descending
New leased Benz, the color coogi

[Verse 3: $ha Hef]
I slid your bitch, we did the do
She's not that innocent
She gave me head while watching tennis at the Wimbledon
I been a Don, you deal with middle men
You just a simpleton
Niggas know I've been about my Benjamins

[Verse 4: RetcH]
A gentlemen, grind the hash in the cinnamon
No fingerprints, licks get hit with the vigilance
Ridiculous, cops I burn 'em like syphilis
Who swift as this, sit in six, with the Glycerius

[Verse 5: Da$H]
The kinmanship ignited me, smoked a papaya tree
Allah himself isnt as high as me, shit
Connect was Panamanian, bitch Scandinavian
She good with numbers, like a nerdy Asian, burn the fragrance

[Verse 6: $ha Hef]
I killed the plaintiff, jury said the act was heinous
Learned the crack was buried in the anus, so degrading
I keep the mask low, clap slower than grass grow
Them slugs be hot as Tabasco you asshole
