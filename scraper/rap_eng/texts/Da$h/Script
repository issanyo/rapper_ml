Blackout Boyz, we don't overdose we just die
And I ain't thinking 'bout shit, baby I'm just fried
Heard you saying you wavy, you ain't on this tide
Sorry dog for being that nigga, you still ain't this guy
I done woke up, two bitches in my bed
Three times in the past four weeks
I had five grams of shrooms, six grams of weed
The bag weighed out to seven cause I had a lil bubble hashish
What I remember at least, cause it's kinda fuzzy
Friends is acting kinda funny, couple more bitches want me
It's all about the money, young rapping druggy
Continue [?]
Stay with some model, she [?] just like I'm in a go
Cause [?], kinky hoes is all I seem to care 'bout
Old niggas hating on young niggas, forgetting it what I hear about
[?], kinky hoes is all I seem to care 'bout
Old niggas hating on young niggas, forgetting it what I hear about
My V.I.C.E.S, yeah I love 'em
Lost my train  of thought and I found it in this cup
Said "fuck college, cut the pro tools on and roll a blunt"
I'm tryna go gold like my nigga Twelvyy fronts
I need a couple million, twenty feet up on the ceiling
And a whip that's real appealing too
Yeah, go and tell 'em who you feeling boo
D-A-DOLLA-SIGN from the H'z crew
Yeah so
