[Beat: "Devil in a New Dress" by Kanye West, produced by Bink!]

[Verse 1: Da$h]
Sinisters giving Manson literature to children
Thoughts of a youthful villain
Windows from floor to ceiling
Feeling like Patrick Bateman off that medication
Only paying my patience ‘cause I’m knowing hell is waiting
Still a shit talking
Blunt sparking, Henny bottle to the face type nigga
Take your momma on a date type nigga
Half a pint, I mean an eight my nigga
Straight Act’ bitch, I’m too throwed to react shit
The Black Jack measuring, Xannies and the sess green
Load up like a motherfucking chess team
You know him, it’s Dolla ho
Bitches blowing yada off the Ivory Coast
Having dinner on a lobster boat
I spit the shit to give Barack a poke
Give the cop a choke
Bumping Flocka in the chopper smoke
Nigga, like the dope, like the dope nigga, like the yo yo
Like the dope, no hope for the weak
Four O’s in the cream whip, four hoes in the Jeep
Two cups ‘cause it’s only for me
You know, came up off of too many Narcos in ponchos shit
Dolla Darko, Backwood full of all gold
Opiates flowing to hope my heart go
Still jumping niggas after rap shows
Still rob a nigga if the cash low
Same nigga sleeping back in class yo
Miseducation getting bad doe
The government is like the fuckin Muppets
Obama just another fuckin puppet
You know it and you motherfuckers love it, what
Ain’t shit changed unless you do it my nigga

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I feel like I’m finished soul searching
I feel like I know my soul purpose
I appreciate your purpose
From what I got from that I know what I’m doing is worth it
And aside from that I know
That I can give it all back with interest
To show my sentiments that they be interested in Soul
Glow like Afro sheen, I always been a natural
Disasters happen everyday I wakeup, asshole
Take us for what we make up, that’s cold
As a chain from Jacob
Ain’t no limitation to my style
I go to hell with a barrel of Arrowhead and put the fire out
I’m off a high amount of reefer, a bean of three, a four of lean
Exposing the holes and the hoaxes effecting us globally in a flow nobly
To most it is so serene, I told Nicole at Rap Genius I’m just sowin' seeds
It’s just a little inception to get your thoughts processing on the way to the club
I figured it out, I’m Lupe Fiasco on drugs
No religious preference, just bundles of love
I must admit, I kinda like a chick that call herself a “bad bitch”
She took the power out of the word and made it fit
Like we did with nigga, my nigga that’s real shit
That’s innovation and I’m so sorry if that’s degrading
It’s the great [?] the subject to the real truth
They say the West Coast is back, that’s real cute
But where was you when me and Rock, Dot, and Q was in the stu’
Beating the mic up black and blue, watching the sky turn black and blue
Wishing one day you get a clue that was like ’06 bitch
And my whole squad sick, you got the flu
Like flying in past tense, meaning I’m past this, past you
(Solo nigga)
