[Verse 1: RetcH]
I said cough drop, phone pause, black on the red horse
Headed up [?] the East, smoking out a red Porsch
With a stoner chick, play two college sports
Say she wanna be a model, but she think she kinda short
Around 5"nothing, guess she right, kinda sort
How the fuck I'm 'posed to know, my forehead alre' kinda sore
But I gas her up, let her get a little hope
So when she suck it later on she use a little throat
Call it strategy, how could you be mad at me
Just tryna insure her that I hit it, call it accuracy
A little flattery'll get me in, allen key
New body casualty, beat it up, battery
I mean battle league, going on hour three
Got a little to caught up, [?] she pull a [?] on me
Steamer, I'm such a day dreamer
Just tryna get her home so I can bone, femur

[Hook: Retch x2]
Blinded by the smoke of the indo
I just wanna feel the wind blow, yeah, yeah
Just crack a window, yeah, yeah
Just crack a window

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Smoking reefer while I'm peeping out my landscape
Retch told me to do this verse so he could drop his damn tape
The Chayce is on, playing haters neighbors of mine
Started rapping, only way to get paid wages in crime
For other niggas, but I don't fuck with them sucker niggas
Only three concerns in this world, money, my brothers, nigga
And the lil girl this tape is named after
Bitches say when I'm famous, hope I'm the same after
But I can't make promises
Dropped a couple videos, did a tour, now Adidas wanna sponsor him
Don't you try to stop him, crib, faded, bumping Goblin, bitch
Cooking, and I swear her body crazier than robbing in the '90s 201, Hackensack is where you'll find me
Yes, this weed I'm puffing purple and it got me looking Chinese
But bae, see, don't question my appearance
And yes, this that good music that you hearing

[Hook: Retch x2]
Blinded by the smoke of the indo
I just wanna feel the wind blow, yeah, yeah
Just crack a window, yeah, yeah
Just crack a window
