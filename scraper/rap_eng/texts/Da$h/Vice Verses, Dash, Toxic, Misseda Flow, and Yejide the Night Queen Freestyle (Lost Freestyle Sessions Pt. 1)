[Intro: Vice Verses]
Uh, uh, uh.  Vice Verses.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hahaha, for the mixtapes in six dates.  Feel me.  Yo

[Verse 1: Vice Verses]
Bear witness: the sickest lyricist in existence
Inflicting your mind every time that I spit this
Technique of torture.  Let’s meet the author
Of the best-selling head-swelling the felon has to offer
Cross the line of logic, intro to insanity
Hand me a mic, watch me wipe out humanity
Calamities and chaos way off in a séance
Pack a 9-iron but a nigga never play golf
You ain’t up to par.  I’m verbally bizarre
Bypassing your operations, taking your heart
Transplanting, your man’s standing with a dose of humility
You lied ‘cause you can’t stand it.  Damn, dude, you killing me
What I recite’s last Vice will and testament to the ill emcee
Bugging out, make ‘em need more repeat than a millipede
So will you please see who you fucking with?
I won’t let you slide—you ain’t saying nothing slick
Of course you want to bite my styles, you suckling
Get you open like Sesame—yo, on these Streets, you can’t see me
Like Snuffleupagus.  And I’m done with this

[Interlude 1: Dash (of Network Reps)]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yo.  Stat Quo, that’s my man.  Ayyo, listen, Dub Z, that’s my man.  Ayyo, listen, Tru P, that’s my man.  Ayyo, there ain’t a thing we can’t do or place we can’t go

[Verse 2: Dash (of Network Reps)]
Yo, heavyweight material on the plate
Every state I done hit, I just flip and celebrate
Stay traveling: Florida, New York, Maryland
Camcorder when a brother want to flash back again
Told my people, “Tell ‘em I ain’t home when they call Dash”
With the amount of payphone cats calling, it’s all trash
If you don’t know it by now, we in and out, dipping
No place to hang around—downtown, got recognition
For hardheads that never listen, they got the roof off
And the signs for the entrance and exit missing
Don’t got to worry ‘bout my life—I stay peace, Most High
Let me walk with closed eyes, but don’t sleep
‘Cause ain’t a category made yet for cats that stick around
But where your tape end?  Fake friends, I’ll spray friends regardless
Rap cartridge in a compartment slot
Target locked, so keep the door to the apartment locked, then
Put the knob on your system to ten, stay tuned
Live and direct with volume, listening in before you
Ask questions on how Dash session’s run.  Lesson one
The whole deal—stop half-stepping, son

[Interlude 2: Dash (of Network Reps) and Toxic]
Dash (of Network Reps): Aight?  Aight?
Toxic: Aight.  Eddie Ill & D.L.  Yo, yo

[Verse 3: Toxic]
I’m off the hook like
I gotta quit it.  I’ll shove a pencil in your temple
Write my name in your brain, leave a message in your mental
Write some rhymes in your memory, make sure you remember me
I ran up on niggas like calling Ferguson, caught ‘em on
The train, ain’t give a fuck who I was murdering
Innocent bystanders became a victim of a violent crime
In their nightmare, they’re seeing me busting a shiny 9
I’m so ill, the Ebola virus told me to chill.  I’m ill
I’m so ill, my fucking tape come with a pack of penicillin pills
Top of the line.  You know thrills, man.  I’ll spark this
No grimy niggas that sold their seed to the black market
A moving target?  I’ll make ‘em mumble, bust ‘em in their kneecaps
Such a waste of sticky like tree sap when it involves
The big stack for currency.  Evade tax, make
The IRS want to murder me.  No emcees equivalent
Like manslaughter or murder or homicide, I kill shit
I’m out of order, run up in a church, commit a holy slaughter
Guzzle all the blood and his blood, come walking out
Pissing holy water.  Respect me like Pope John Paul
Before I get the pounds for you clowns.  I got the deuce pounds
The trey pounds and four pounds and the trey-pound-sevens
I’m sinister—before you see me, I’ll burn your eyes out
Bomb ultraviolet shit to make the ozone layer die out
I’m solar-hot, hot like heat lightning when I’ll be striking
Spit three raps that melt the polar caps.  My style’s
Grown fully—never prenatal, I’m fatal with mice
Like ninjas with katana knives.  If we were joints
You’d be [?], I’d be [?].  If we was alcohol
We’d be [?] and you’d be [?]
I’ll flow like H2—add some oxygen, that equals water
Rhymes I kick, my styles be magnificent
Like manslaughter or murder homicide, I’m killing shit

[Interlude 3: Misseda Flow]
One time.  Eddie Ill, D.L.  It’s the Flow who’s wrecking.  Yo, yo

[Verse 4: Misseda Flow]
So you heard Flow in the show when you’re looking for more taste
I’m seeing more flavor than the lips on a whore’s face
Tracks I rip can knock the shit out of Conrail
Having your mom turning back for my raps like they’re on sale
Will impale and rip the new songs with just my two arms
I’ll rip more mics than bitches clip coupons
I’m scary like two blondes driving a u-corn
In an obstacle course with some high-heeled shoes on
Too strong, got it going on whenever night
Or day I rhyme, your girlfriend say I’m fine and, plus, smooth
I'll "Rule the World" like Kurtis Blow in the movie Krush Groove
I starting rhyming in ’89 and now I’m a pro at it
Got your mind robbing stores to support him—it’s the Flow habit
Intelligent, handsome, and blessed since my born day
Even crippled people breakdance when my song play
I’m staggering, so anyday’s a wrong day for battling
We could stay at the roots or take it up to Madison
Square.  God, you’ll pull your hair hard like some chickens wrestling
Am I nice or am I fucking nice?  Pick the question
Challenging me?  Come equipped with your best game
You’re stupid like bitches writing checks in the express lane
I’ll dress plain—conservative time swerve with the mic
Like I was driving on the Hawk's Nest nervous at night

[Interlude 4: Misseda Flow]
Word up.  And I’m out like that

[Verse 5: Yejide the Night Queen]
Chocolate-complected, heavily respected.  My mannerisms
Reflected by my seeds, then interjected
How their respective traits, intellect projects their fate
On this Earth as I birth this sense of self-worth
So what you saying?  I’ll be the Mama Wise, the elder wisdom
Recognize my stamina.  I damage your aura
Lack of horror on the Freedom Enterprise
Without this black woman, yo, you can’t rise
To the level you was destined to be at.  Some cats
Don’t see that and bring strife when I bring forth my light
But that’s aight.  I still persevere.  My peace and love
Disseminates throughout the atmosphere.  I’ll cut ties
Like Geppetto when I let go of energy not conducive
To my growth.  I’ll take an oath to be three sea-level
Above my adversaries.  Their levels vary but never
Reaching mine.  I’m teaching rhyme skills that many, many ladies
Don’t possess.  Since the eighties, I’ve been blessed
With seeds, so Mama Wise know what the babies need.  Now what
You talking?  You flossing with your fake hairdress
Enhancing your breasts and your name-brand dress
You can’t contest without profanity.  You say you not
A role model—yo, that’s insanity.  When you in the public eye
Then all of us are watching you—young and old look up to you
But make sure you’re a queen, not a sex fiend

[Outro: Yejide the Night Queen]
Yeah, Brooklyn representing hard up in this piece.  What the deal?  Yejide the Night Queen
