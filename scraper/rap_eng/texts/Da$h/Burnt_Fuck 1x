[Burnt]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so
Act like you fucking know, nigga

[Verse]
No suit, I'm handling business
My weed so loud in public some get offended
Like 2 Chainz said, I'm riding round and I'm getting it
You ain't make not a dollar of this money, bitch
So you damn sure ain't gon' spend it
I'm in it to win it, there's no second place, taking joints to the face
Took ya bitch to my place, suck me off for a hour, said I had good taste
Seen the views in the crib, yeah, said she dig where I live
Left the lab around 2, 2:30, yeah, you know ya boy up in her ribs
D-A-DOLLA, young real nigga, junior in high school a lean sipping pill dealer
Only been a few years since then, couple labels wanna offer me a deal nigga
Words kinda slurred cause I'm off the cup
Smoking on a joint but they offering blunts
Models from the club to the loft to fuck
And these niggas keep saying I ain't talking much
And these niggas keep saying I ain't talking much
And a nigga won't stop rapping 'til I'm lost in bucks
Niggas keep saying I ain't talking much
I take models from the club to the loft to fuck
Yeah So, Yeah So

[Hook]
This the part you get turnt up
This the part you get turnt up
This the part you get turnt up
This the part you get turnt up
This the part you get turnt up
This the part you get turnt up
Pop the pill, smoke the blunt
This the part you get turnt up
This the part you get turnt up
This the part you get turnt up
Grab a bitch, pour your cup
I said this the part you get turnt up
I said this the part you get turnt up
I said this the part you get turnt up
Pop a zip, we don't give a fuck
I said this the part you get turnt up
I said this the part you get turnt up
I said this the part you get turnt up

[Outro]
Yeah So, Hz nigga

[Fuck 1x​​]

[Intro]
Yeah So
Hz nigga
Cause if you ain't know
Dub 12 shit

[Verse]
Claiming we homies, they don't even know me
Can't even tell 'em my real name, I treat 'em like the police
You guessed it, Da$H Dillinger, lyrical god
Blows a ounce with the council, my team be the fucking mob
Couple niggas in jail, few niggas on bail
A few niggas in Hell, my motivation for rapping so well
And my haters in a corner with a dunce cap
While I roll sacks and I count stacks
Fuck a bad bitch 'til her back break
Minus bullshit nigga life's great
Breaking down this elbow
Blasting T and 101 in my black and white shell toes
And I'm plotting on a million, fuck how you feeling
Bad bitch in a convertible, drop the ceiling
When I think I lost my mind, shorty blew it out
You already know what my motherfucking crew about
Rare crew of dudes, man I bet your fucking boo could vouch
Free the Bigga, 'til he home I'ma bring the wave my nigga
Yeah, so

[Outro]
H'z
Eat a dick if you ain't with it, nigga
