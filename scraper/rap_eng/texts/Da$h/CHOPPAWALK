[Hook: Lil Gnar]
Choppawalkin with ya bitch
Might just hit you and ya kids
Extended clippin, call it dick
Stack it up I need my chips, All this guwap, I need a crib
Stack it up I need my chips, All this guwap, I need a crib
All this guwap, I need a crib
Choppawalkin with ya bitch
Might just hit you and ya kids
Extended clippin, call it dick
Stack it up I need my chips, All this guwap, I need a crib
All this guwap, I need a crib, Stack it up I need my chips
Stack it up I need my chips

[Verse 1: Da$h]
Gold tints so slayer, rag on so slayer
Need your neck up out your bitch
Drunk hanging out the whip
16 up in the clip
Missed five hit six
I need a mountain of them chips
Keep on counting all the chips
Pistol just like an eraser
Fuck that lil hoe, I'm chaser
Hop in that foreign, I'm racing
Nigga just dodging these cases
My bitch is foreign, no she isn't born
I'm toting something you can not pronounce
Talking bout weed nigga bring an ounce
Need a 100k up in the couch
Need a 100k up in the basement
Shit I need a 100k up in the attic
Pussy, money, weed nigga that's my habit
Pussy, money, weed nigga I'm an addict
If dollar dared [?]
Motherfuckers know destro
If the ops out we bringing shots out
8 gang nigga that's all
