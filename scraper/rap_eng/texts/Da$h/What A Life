[Verse 1: GLC]
Emancipate this ism and free the nation
I use these women as motivation
But they gotta know they places soft that I confuse my seventh, that my eighth bitch
And know they wanna say I ain't shit
That's when I be like ok split
And now she getting wasted
Everytime I leave, tears cover her face
Been to school, every test I aced it
Baby is a fool, thinking you replaced this
Knife persuasion, mac and game embrace is gracious
Made my list of chicks, something you should embrace
Mo' money mo' problems like Ma$e
Mo' kush mo' bottles by the case
Mo' money mo' models in my face
I've been pimping strong since first and second grade
Ain't no way I can deal with second rate
Only special head, I guess I got it made
Terminator-ism, manifest with the maids
Oh what a life, the ism has been displayed

[Verse 2: Mckenzie Eddy]
[?]

[Hook: Mckenzie Eddy x3]
What a life, what a life, what a life, what a life

[Verse 3: Da$H]
I'm tangled in a web, but the women in drugs
Niggas greet me handshakes, they bitches with hugs
Know I do what I does, chinky eyed, smooth talker, high player
Shit I'm all of the above
Living fast but I know I probably told you on my last song
They telling me slow down or you won't last long
To be honest I ain't tryna live forever
Just long enough to get the 911 Carerra
With the black piping on the leather
White seats looking milky
Fuck Dirty Money, young and tryna be filthy
Came to separate the fake from the real B
Smoking on this reefer, won't stop 'til it kill me
So they asking "what a life, what a life"
My drink getting warm, where the ice, where the ice
And my joint getting off where my light, where my light
Can't pay dues if you ain't know the price, nigga
Yeah, So
