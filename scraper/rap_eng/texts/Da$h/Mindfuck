[Intro]

[Verse: Da$H]
Reputation like Saddam, bet that I'm complex
Get in your head, like the Quran
Bitch I'm a [arm?] next to perfect
Want it all, what you did to deserve it
Thought you was deep, but they scratching the surface
Gun clip look like a broken rib
Show respect when talking to the kid
Anything other and we removing lips
Moving Mare back before you ever had a blunt tucked
Say I'm breath taking like a gut punch
Here to show you who's who, and what's what
I put my [bitted?] and I double dare
Double back like a nigga forgot something
Not fronting, back up my team
We had the block jumping
Turned a seven into a half, before I copped onions
True still, before crack, I was moving them blue pills
Had ya bitches rolling off Red Dragons like Drew Hill
Who you thought
The walking corpse up in that Lauren Sport
I seen that opp, and had the strap
So you was sure we fought
Bosses taught me better
I'm down to cause a Holocaust
If it's involving cheddar
I heard you said riding pussy
Hurry up and get in
Yeah, I'm just waiting for these drugs to set in
So you can take a ride with me
Ask my bitch would she die with me
You know, thought provoking, always smoking
Outspoken, young and fucking bugging
Jump him 'til he turn to pumpkin
Never bluffing, I'm the best and their ain't no discussion
Motherfucker, it's Dolla

[Hook: J.I.D]

[Verse: J.I.D]
I've been sittin' on my hands
Havin' the world at my feet
-unknown-
Saddle my steed like it's 1873
But I got a weapon with me
And I'm ready to eat
Metal to meat to settle the beef
You got a vendetta with me?
Niggas get dragged like Edelman in a Cover 3
I'm on your bitch ass
Beretta hit him, he fell asleep
You such a sick ass
I did it nigga, you tellin' me
Intelligently though
So for the bills we might
Better check your bro
We in a field if I recollect
Correct, with hella debt and neck to neck
Better yet, get a Tec for disrespect
Ready set go, steady and slow, let it explode
Eyes on the road
They lookin for niggas like me and you
They scared of the future scared of what we could do
I jumped off the stoop at 4' 2"
Shit I jumped off the roof with those dudes
Mama asked "If they did it what you gon' do?"
Drop with a parachute
Gotta get the guap keep the pots full of callaloo
I'm gon' shine but what's lights to a caribou
Got my nine while your niggas been backstabbing you
I'mma skedaddle watch your life crackle
You a chip in the gravel
I done added up every atom and assessed the compatibles
Manifested the antidote
And the flow that can catapult me up of Atlanta
Pose for all my fans, Please excuse my manners
Crack a smile for the camera, turn my bandana up
Sag my pants a little, swag my stance a little
Just take a trip to my city it's a landfill
-unknown-

[Hook: J.I.D]
