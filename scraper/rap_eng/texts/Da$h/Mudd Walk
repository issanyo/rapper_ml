[Hook]
Blunt spark, tech got a nigga with the muddwalk
Tough talk’ll get a fucking chump chalked
Shake that pump, make motherfuckers bloodwalk
Niggas know what’s on soon as that blunt spark

[Verse]
Shit, there ain’t no patience just profit
Cess is up, elimination
Niggas think cause I rap like I got a education
I ain’t turn my motherfucking crib into Ammunation
Bitch you been mistaken
Go and ask my nigga *bleep*
Got a rack then I grabbed the gat
Flew back home just to bust a pack
Ain't front me shit, homie got it snatched
You can hit my line if you need whatever
It’s FMH'z so just bring the cheddar
Fiends touching needles like they knitting sweaters
This for all my niggas doing bids together
In the cell straight raising hell
Been fuck 12 since Sean Bell
And all them niggas sitting in departments
Singing off they ass like R.Kell
These rap niggas playing pin the tail
I tell my bitch to go and get the scale
White chest my hoes like it's Chip and Dale
When my set is done I got a zip for sale
Ain’t shit changed but the address
Sex, money, drugs, madness
This rap games like mad stress
It’s like thank god for that bag, yes
For that bag, yes
All of these niggas be talking about it
Sure don’t be walking about it
Be in the spot and some shit’ll pop off
And these niggas be walking around it

[Hook]
Blunt spark, tech got a nigga with the muddwalk
Tough talk’ll get a fucking chump chalked
Shake that pump, make motherfuckers bloodwalk
Niggas know it’s on soon as that blunt spark

[Outro]
Soon as that blunt spark (blunt spark)
Blunt spark
Soon as that Tech spark
Blunt spark
Tech spark
Muddwalk (muddwalk)
Get a fucking chump chalked
Soon as that blunt spark
