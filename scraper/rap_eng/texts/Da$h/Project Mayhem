[Intro]
Alright, we on
Hold on, you know who the fuck it is
Aye, yeah, know what the fuck it was
Aye, so, aye, so
Sledgren
So, so

[Verse 1]
Hide up like top gun, makin' new plans to get some new paper
New nine with a old beam, nigga saw it, thought it was a lightsaber
Bitch told me that I'm a pimp, said "Nah, baby, I'm a life changer"
T-Ray said fuck suckers and I hope all you niggas die haters
Master manipulator, Larry told me I'm doin' good
Get a kick out of pullin' capers, got it on me, I wish you would
Hop a Russian chopper, shit is half steel, shit is half wood
Take a nigga wifey, had to treat the bitch like a dad should

[Chorus]
Way that me and my niggas movin', you would think it's Project Mayhem
Ask them bitches "Who that nigga?" and I bet that gonna say "Him"
Countin' money on the floor, my nigga, this is Project Mayhem
By the way a nigga feelin', I fuck you and all your eight friends

[Verse 2]
Aye, aye, aye, Tyler Dirt Junior, tote the Ruger, know my lungs polluted
I be with the troopers, get to shootin', we ain't talkin' hoopin'
Wanna fuck the ho but hit her sister 'cause the bitch was cuter
Say we in the spot and it's a problem, bitch, I be lootin'
Gang bangers, card crackers, dope slangers
Heard you in the closet like a coat hangers
Shit, you need the bitch, I don't talk, I bleed the bitch
Know I'm speedin', shit, you seen me, you seen I'm rich

[Chorus]
Way that me and my niggas movin', you would think it's Project Mayhem
Ask them bitches "Who that nigga?" and I bet that gonna say "Him"
Countin' money on the floor, my nigga, this is Project Mayhem
By the way a nigga feelin', I fuck you and all your eight friends
