I play the cut until it scabs
Sit in a pumpkin color Jag
The one who got your older brother mad
Sister sad that I won't choose her
Have her blow me in a uber, roll the buddah
Then leap up out the Garden of Eden
I'm giving b-cops beatings
Run the street with some fucking cretins
All my women talk with foreign speeches
Pillowcase is silk [?], nigga
Spit in the face of your boss
Fuck front row at the Olympics
Lit the haze with the torch
I'm on the curb while you play on the porch
New bitch resemble Kate Moss
Hot box her daddy gravy Porche
Rich hoe, she sport the Prada bubble
The lawyer say I'm in a lot of trouble
I get convicted, give the sentence to my body double
Kingpin, super villain like the Penguin
Doing all these drugs just so reality can sink in
You cuffing bitches like [?]
They print my face on bills just like I'm Lincoln, bitch
Give me five feet, the crew beyond sweet
My words are straight out the Abyss, the flow beyond deep
A white yacht across the black sea
Shit I'm smoking smell like cat pee
No collection like I'm Jay Gatsby
Them Newports got my throat raspy
Going hard 'til the law snatch me
Or the devil catch me, faggot

Eat a dick nigga

Sitting [?]
Rolling up a heap of hay
With a bitch you lay...with
