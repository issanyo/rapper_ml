[Intro]
You gotta nother swisher?
Alright
Yeah so

[Verse 1: Da$H]
Shit, I stopped smoking with haters back in '06
You wasn't leanin or [?] breathing, nigga, you ain't pour shit
I'm arguably one of the dopest
I come through your label cause an explosion, boom, Okinawa
With a bitch who look like Yoko Ono, we smoking sour
Clip the blunt, and then we film a porno, iPhone 4 flow
Cutting on my HDR, she screaming "fuck me hard"
I hit it in her husband car
Feeling like Mojo Risin, dangerously high
Before his bitch walked in that bathroom and said that he died
Ain't worried 'bout no overdose
This dead head OG that I'm toking, got a nigga comatose
They telling me I over smoke and over sip
Really I don't give no shits
Puffing Newports, pimping hoes
Like Too $hort on these fucking simps
With ten toes on the pavement
Living what I'm saying, over here we ain't conforming
Just adapting like we cavemen
Yeah so

[Hook: Da$H & RetcH]
Motherfuck the opposition
Roll it, smoke it, pop it, sip it
Motherfuck the opposition
Rolling, smoking, popping, sipping
Motherfuck the opposition
Fuck the opposition
Motherfuck the opposition
Roll it, smoke it, pop it, sip it
Motherfuck the opposition
Fuck the opposition
Motherfuck the opposition
Rolling, smoking, popping, sipping
Motherfuck the opposition
Roll it, smoke it, pop it, sip it
Motherfuck the opposition

[Verse 2: Da$H]
My friends call me a alcoholic
All of this drinking in the morning
Tell em mind they fuckin business, Henny bottle keep on pouring
Y'all listen to my recordings
And say all I talk about is money, drugs, and bitches
Not the nights I had to hustle, struggle, run ya pockets
Snatch ya chain off ya neck, half your re-up pay my debts
Other half I flip for profits, split the cheese with my set
Major players in the field, dawg
Knievel crew, what the fuck the meaning of fear, dawg
Just to see how far niggas came in the past year, dawg
This shit is like a sick dream, cause Mav still facing 15
Tryna get rich off 16's, and the greats die round 28
I got 8 and a half and I can't be late
Tryna get us straight, tape my work while I blaze my herb
I play the street, while you bitch niggas play the curb
Control ya mind when I play with words
Food for thought and your plate is served
Nigga
