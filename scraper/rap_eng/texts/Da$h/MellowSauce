[Verse 1: Da$h]
She popping X, more Oz
Smell me as soon as I walk through the do'
Said it before, Hz nd coke
OG and Sour, don't pass me no dro
Or you catch me fucking leaning, eyes looking real Krispy Kremeish
Glazed over, can't remain sober, days like Hangover
'cain Range Rover, so you hear a nigga sincere
Cobain reincarnated, feel like I already been here
And I'm queasy off the White Remy, don't believe me?
Bitches in bikinis down to testify, like a nigga pleading, I'm
Feeling like Eazy, black skully under that Cali sun
Hoes wanna go skiing in Hollywood but that snow goin come
To the hills, eat what you kill, you niggas meals, so fucking real
Them niggas at CNN offering deals, bitch

[Verse 2: RetcH]
Open a pound, break that shit down
Distribute the work and shut down the town
Bitch I want money and want that shit now
Pass the Febreeze cause this shit really loud
My mom going trip at the smell of this shit
Kicked out for the night had to call up my bitch
Woke up to hot tea, pancakes, and grits
Before I hit the strip, had to suck on the tits
Fuck on the clit, she suck on my dick
I give her a kiss, that's my motherfucking bitch
I'mma nasty ass nigga, yeah I motherfucking know
Asking bout my fit, yeah that's motherfucking 'Lo
If it ain't 'Lo that's motherfucking slow
If you ain't know that's a motherfucking no
P to the O to the L to the O
Niggas already know I be 'Lo to the flo'
And that's ER-Day, ho! Ain't no, say so
Might throw on that Champ hoody if I'm tryna be on my lay low
Trap wear, Trap gear, BC, we trap here
Got a yellow bitch rolling off a pill and she stunting in the black dress with the black hair
She love when I fuck her on the walls
Me and her scalp play tug of war
Her tongue and her throat, yeah they love my balls
She always in them Vickies, yeah I love them draws
I call my dick "Chachi" and he love them jaws
Cops and the judge, yeah fuck em all
Hating on a nigga, I brush em off
Left a bitch crib like, "We fuck tomorrow?"
Yeah we fuck tomorrow, said we fuck tomorrow, we can fuck tomorrow, we can fuck all day
To that Lou Rawls shit from back in the day, Early Morning Love will be the song I sing
Tell a lil bitch whatchu know bout me? I be on that pimp shit
Can't fuck with you fuck niggas call yall niggas be simping
Bitches..

Tell that bitch she better call Tyrone!
