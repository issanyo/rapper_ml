[Verse]
Said it's smelling like teen spirit, can you hear it
I told her if she hit that bong she better clear it
My appearance and these lyrics got me clearance at the airport
Smelling like dope high off all types of other shit, fuck
Beware of who you fucking with
Another hit of that Lucy, jumped on that mothership
These fucking drugs they got me schitzed
Still, somehow they tryna pay me just to publish this
It's brazy, yeah
And my mother call me lazy for a while
First child and I'm wild too (wild too)
But when she see me in them magazines she smile boo
I swear
Look in that mirror take a deep inhale
I'm losing hair, so I'm starting not to care about much
Except these drugs and these dollas
I fucked the [?]
Fucked a couple of these sluts too
Yeah
Been a couple places, seen a couple faces
You prolly seen me, I ain't even famous
As for this life, I got to taste it and got fucking wasted
Forreal
Yeah So...
Alright lemme hear that
