[Verse 1]
Catch me ass naked, windows ceiling, Caesar's palace
Just a role, feeling like Alice in a rabbit hole
My bitch look like she from Maxim yo
Spit the type of shit your dad'll quote
Since I went on tour with Rock you niggas think I'm rich
Nah dog, you still look like a lick
And yo bitch, she still be on my dick
My homies still be out here making flips
My cup, it still do got a couple sips
As if you ain't know that
Ashing a blunt in a Mercedes Benz floor mat
The color srirachi, with rapping I'm cocky
My bloodline has got me so many fucking horses
That I look like a jockey, a flatline couldn't stop me
That's on my life, I eat drugs, sleep drugs
So these lil niggas know that I speak drugs
When they at my shows, downloading my tapes
Now that I rap I got this white actress on a date
I'll probably fuck it up, just a nigga anyway
But I changed my everyday from sitting on Park
Selling dimes of weed, from the sun turn to dark
Now I'm rolling up my drugs when the tour bus is parked
It's life nigga

[Hook]
Got the government tryna brainwash us
And them coppers tryna to clock us nigga
But they wonder why they can't stop us
Our own mother's couldn't watch us nigga
Out late tryna regulate (x4)
Time to regulate
It's time to regulate (x6)

[Verse 2/Outro]
Feeling like Tony before he made the call
To kill Sosa's man and end it all
He took that nigga life for what he felt was right
Died the same night
Fuck it, I'm with it, you know I dug the commitment
Ended the same way for the paper and my clique
In the same Bimmer tears was shed by Money Mitch
With a honey bitch, she putting wax in a joint
Twisting a honey spliff
In the pursuit of money life has come to this
Shit...
