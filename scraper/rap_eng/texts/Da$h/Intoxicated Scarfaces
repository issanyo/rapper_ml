[Intro]
Yo, did you not see that fucking red light man?
Man you think I give a fuck about a motherfucking red light?
These faggot cops can't touch me
I'm out here smoking weed, speeding
All that yo, fuck that, that's me

[Verse 1: Remy Banks]
Stepped in the function with my hoodie up
Yankee fitted, brim low
Sipped the Henny straight
Eyeing shorty white as snow in Agano, in the spandex
Finger waved at her, Ma it's time to go
Hit the cut and roll the dope
She had the Uber waiting, feeling like Lucifer
I know I'm sinning as we speed across the [?]
She got some thighs on her so I'm feeling on them curves
Roll the window down, she lit her [?] so I lit the herb

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Catch me jumping out the rafters like I'm Owen Hart
Exotic villa full of stolen art
Aquarium don't got no fish in it but only shark
Grain and the seven came from Noah's Ark, conceited, nigga
The chair pulled out before the Don is seated
Bitch on my arm is Swedish
Face of the karma's heathen
Salmon with garlic season
It was the chef's choice
Get your bitch to leave my head moist, it's him

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Remy Banks]
My high kicked in soon as she kissed my neck
Hand out the window, streetlights dancing off my VVS
Diamonds in the ring, quality the best
Just like my bitches, running like a villain
Thoughts full of lost visions
Elevated backyards, futuristic Don living
I'm so cozy feel like my soul's risen
Chain gleaming, street dreaming
Traveling around the globe just to feel my leisure
I'm winning

[Interlude]

[Verse 4: Da$h]
Living the fucking dream
Half a million stashed inside a sunken submarine
Bensen get the scuba gear, go and fetch the cream
We need to make investments
Drunk-drive the Lexus out in Texas, defining reckless
Wind was crescent, said soda complete the essence
Mood was adolescent, teach the lessons on how to do this
Since a truant been a nuisance, turn yo women to a nudist
Light the sewage nigga

Cause if you ain't know
Got yo grandmother tap dancing on broken glass
No socks

(Walter White)
