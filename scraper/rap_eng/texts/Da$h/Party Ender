[Intro]
Free RetcH
Yeah, So

[Hook]
I know I ain't right
I ain't right upping the fucking heat
I know I ain't right
Walking 'round like I was fucking deep
I know I ain't right
I ain't right upping the fucking heat
Fuck, what, motherfuck
I know I ain't right
I ain't right upping the fucking heat
I know I ain't right
Walking 'round like I was fucking deep
I know I ain't right
I ain't right upping the fucking heat
Fuck, what, motherfuck

[Verse]
Da$H on a rampage
Free my brother Mugga, still the campaign
Pussy ass rappers getting chain snatched
Ain't shit cracking, say that, get ya chain back
This a product of the 90s
Across the water, where you find me
Money equal out my timing
Your women crushing, I'm behind it
Take up your soldiers to sport
Catching flights on the day that I got court
It's the life a nigga sought
Paying mortgage from the drugs a nigga bought
Point is you niggas soft
Twist my fingers, get 'em off
Beat the cases that I fought
But motherfuck getting caught

[Hook]
I know I ain't right
I ain't right upping the fucking heat
I know I ain't right
Walking 'round like I was fucking deep
I know I ain't right
I ain't right upping the fucking heat
Fuck, what, motherfuck
I know I ain't right
I ain't right upping the fucking heat
I know I ain't right
Walking 'round like I was fucking deep
I know I ain't right
I ain't right upping the fucking heat
Fuck, what, motherfuck

[Verse 2]
We got guns in the party, we just came to party
Don't end up a body, don't end up a body
My man got his pistol, in the car he got his shotty
Don't end up a body, don't end up a body
We got guns in the party, we just came to party
Don't end up a body, don't end up a body
My man got his pistol, in the car he got his shotty
Don't end up a body, don't end up a body
Yeah, So
Stomp a nigga 'til they stop the party
Said stomp a nigga 'til they stop the party
Yeah, Yeah, So
