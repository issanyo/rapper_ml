I told 'em hold up, got this weed to roll up
Hate when people in my business, told my mother keep my door shut
She telling me to slow up, told myself to pour up
Man, I'm half way through this bottle, I'm just hoping I don't throw up
Convince myself it's helping, but I know it's only hurting me
Certain thoughts of uncertainty seem to give me an urgency to get bent
Another swig up out this bottle then I bounce
Hold up, I'm back inside, I left my keys up on the couch
Mom shouting every time it smell like weed I'm in the house
I reply, you don't want me here then kick a nigga out, yeah
Tryna avoid the argument
Hit the front door, jump in my homie crib
Rolled a blunt and sparked the shit
Caught in a fork behind the tints, we creeping through the streets
Speakers booming, heat on in case we run into police
Girl buzzing me, thinking another bitch between my sheets
Guess she don't know involvement cheese the only time I cheat
King of my time, because I'm working while these niggas sleep
On my grind with these rhymes, ain't got a cut in some weeks
Hustle like a motherfucker trapping
But I'm just tryna get a mil' off this rapping
Get a mil' off this rapping
On my hustle you'd think a lil nigga trapping
Yeah, tryna get a mil' off this, yeah, yeah, yeah so...
