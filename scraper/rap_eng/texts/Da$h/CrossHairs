[Intro]
Hide my emotions with the dope
[?] exhale, nigga my stress floats
I'm on the highway to life with my seatbelt off
Seatbelt off, seatbelt off
And I got my dick down her throat
Coke in her nose, baby girl sniff the co'
Cause I'm on the highway to life with my seatbelt off
Seatbelt off, seatbelt off
And my shorty say I need to take it slow
Say you know, more xans, more pour
And I'm on the highway to life with my seatbelt off
Seatbelt off, seatbelt off
And a nigga doing all these shows
Just so they could quote my suicide note
Cause I'm on the highway to life with my seatbelt off
Seatbelt off, seatbelt off
And I know life's a bitch but she let me poke
Do she love me? say you know
I think so

Yo
(Burning throat, a nigga so motherfucking high nigga)

[Verse]
The flow was mastered
In the same kitchen Show was chopping five hunnit pieces
Smell the mob cooking chicken grease
You know I'm hungry cause I'm kicked out
Burning about ten pounds on a beige couch
Went to Joes, no hoes
But I found out the Oxy went for 4-O
If they was yellow, 80 if they was green
The footballs went for 7
5 if you was  my mans b
We four deep in a Camry, it's 'bout 2008
Two of them niggas was gone
One was snake, one was jake
Sad story, no guts for the glory
Found [?] in the [?], rest assuredly
Catch me in a silver Benz, feeling like Larenz Tate
Shotty pumped under that armour truck, nigga
Need it all, spring homes in the fall
Summer houses in the winter, I'm a fucking winner
Ordered shuma for the dinner cause the bitch was Japanese
With five g's of the kill pack
Ain't a rapper crack then I kill that
Big shark in this small pond
No wonder niggas can't bring the real back, yeah
Here to take these racks from [?]
I know you feel that
One without the seal cracked
Roll up another sack
Cause if you ain't motherfucking know something

[Hook x2]
See my self portrait on the wanted poster
When you hear this shit you'll run it back
Wontcha, wontcha
Nigga roll another blunt
Wontcha, wontcha
Girl I know you wanna fuck
Dontcha, dontcha
