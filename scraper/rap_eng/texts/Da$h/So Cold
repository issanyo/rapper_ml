[Intro: A$AP Nast]
Yeah
A$AP Mob in this mothafucka
Tried to told ya
Yo Yams what's up

[Verse 1: A$AP Nast]
Skinny black nigga, all black get-up
Calvin Klein trench, make me look trap killa
I am rap skrilla, Michael Jack back, in my rap
Check the trap, trilla, Nasty back, track killa
Call me young Jack Ripper, rest in peace wack niggas
With this rap, Nast sicker than the sickest of the sickest generation
Ya'll just hating, cause we made it, celebration got me faded
Blazing up, I feel amazing, but I'm just saying
Like what you saying, y'all be playing
All are prey to a pack of wolves, that never ate
Or so they say, they could be fake, whoever know
We sold our souls, we sold our minds
I lost my mind, but that's all lies, because I'm all fine
I got this game, this bitch is mine, nigga

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Roll a couple grams, black hoe with a tan
Bands don't just make her dance, bet the bitch will fuck my friends
Feeling like I'm Cam nigga, put her on the cam nigga
And she got a man, she only love me for my jams, damn
I'm drunk as a fish, inhaling a spliff, can't you see I'm loaded
And I won't stop till I'm dead or I'm rich, young niggas control it
Fold niggas like clothing, say my side what you opposing?
Leave him stiff like he was posing, never scared of overdosing, yup
Asked for a pill, handed her two
Say you get high, well prove it then boo
Ordered a 'tel, call up your crew
And we set it off just like Jada would do
True, they say the real niggas don't lie
You was never close to I so I suggest you never try, yeah so

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Trap lord and I'm righteous
Cozy boy and I'm still reclining
Bad bitch in manolo blahnik
I pump that ass like that colonic
Feel the bass and that beat knocking
Can't see my face, I'm beneath the stocking
Stocky nigga but the heat brolic
Get your head chopped like supersonic
Yamborghini in a Lamborghini
Margiela bitch in that red bikini
French bitch suck seven weewees
Ask Rock if you don't believe me
Mobbing hard with my mob
Trap lord the young god
A$AP we go hard
Brraaap boy in yo car
Lay flat boy, it's yo gun
Feeling like a task force with that chrome
Feeling like I'm Flex boy with that bomb (BOOM)
Tec spray like cologne
Better get that tec boy, you're so gone
Hit him in the neck, jaw or his arm
You better not flex boy when I zone
Cause I draw guns like Crayons

[Hook: A$AP Nast]
