Yeah, yeah so
Niggas know what I claim
Fast Money Heirs, bitch you know it stay the same
Yeah so, D-A-dolla-sign-H, nigga
Look

[Verse]
Yeah I'm claiming FMH's, trained to go nigga
Hit the door nigga, leaving with your hoe nigga
G's fasho nigga, all about that fucking bread
Dillinger family living, heard they got a ticket on my head
Yeah right, every night, kush joints air tight
Off of one the motto, niggas never heard of fair fights
If that bitch is rolling, know she twisting on a heirs flight
Never hesitate just do it, why you think I wear Nikes
Collecting cheese my niggas call from jail, so I accept the fees
They tell me get these cheques, stop acting reckless please
For what it's worth, put it down for my turf
Ride around with the Crown getting slurped
Cigarillo full of purp (purp)
You could smell it on my shirt
If you try to intervene you getting hurt
And I put that on my earth, I know they sick of this shit
These niggas Donovan McNabb, I'm Mike Vick in this shit
Faggots ain't even in the draft, I'm first pick in this shit
Bully niggas like [?] with a brick in this shit, bitch
And you wonder why you broke go figure
Drinking Henn 'til they free my nigga Bigga
I'm all eight wonders of the world in one fly young nigga
Yeah I got taught the game by the pimps and drug dealers
Real recognize real so you know I stay familiar
You would think they on E by the way them bitches feel us, so
My brim niggas love it when I throw my H'z up
Call me locked but he told me go get that paper cuz
And people thinking it's a wedding way we caking up
(Inhaling reefer while I kick my Jordan laces up)
Facing what, never pass my J's to paper chasing sluts
Unless my brothers tell me that this bitch is facing us
And they tell me that I sound quite hostile
Fuck ya bitch is my lifestyle, yeah so
