[Verse: Da$H]
I just wanna give you that same feeling that yo' momma had seen in yo' daddy for the first time
So when I called her, I just got to answering and asking questions
Testing keys that I thought opened yo' mind
Tell me 'bout yo' problems, wanna hear about yo' issues
Ain't saying I can solve 'em, perspectives may help me fix 'em
But when we taking chances, your body's like a dancers
I'm thinking how I fuck you out in France so it's romantic, baby
Do you think that I'd be too blunt if I woke up and I told you
That I thought this was lovely when you said I didn't know you
Oh, you, insult you, oh, you, yeah, yeah
Baby, tell me that you heard it before
Your facial expression, all I need to know, hoe
Yeah baby, I know you heard it before
We did all this talking, I'm ready to show, hoe
Cause you tell me that you heard it before
So you [?]
And baby tell me that you heard it before
And baby you tell me that you heard it before
That's it
