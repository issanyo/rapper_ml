[Intro]
Like Al Green when the tints is up
Courtest of nothing, courtesy of the label, courtesy of us
Aye, so, so, so, so, so, so
So, so, so, so, so, so

[Verse]
Bitch, I'm wavy, come out to see
Pick a side, it's the Hennessy
Hella [?], baby, said I'm in too deep
In the two door so you know I'm gon' speed
Aye, need the shit I want, I want the shit I need
Searchin' out, she don't know me
Feelin' like I'm poppin', this shit down, ooh
Feelin' like I'm poppin', this shit down, ooh
And they say, "Dolla, he ain't changed much
Still on the same stuff", said, "He still be with the gangsters"
These niggas switchin', that's some shit I can't relate to
Swear you get rich and love, your bitch is gon' hate you
It's just reality, I swear my life a tragedy
I'm out in public and you know I got that bag with me
And bae go 'round, so, no, no, no, I ain't got no drugs today
You call me on another day and I can plug you, bae
The semi-automatic pop they ass, nigga geekin'
With some bitches who'll probably give up for the weekend

[Outro]
Let me hear it
You just gotta talk your water, like
