[Verse 1]
Took the bitch to Hibatchi
She down to cum like Asaki
I got the beef and broccoli
You can't stop me, I'm the chief Apache
Peel your scalp, take your village and your women
Don't even know what you've done
You bitch niggas talk, it's for living, promise
My head piece look like a grizzly ate me
Probably the father of Brenda's baby
I'm from the 90's, so you know I'm crazy
They know I'm wit-it, I'm with the shit-its
Hit the liddick, then we count the digits
Say she only counting pounds, I think the chick was British
Suck my diddick, so she show commitment, shit
Light up the spliff, the cuban link the color of my bitch
Chase the pinch while I grab the grip, nigga

[Hook]
Posted on the golf course with the horses
They say I'm looking like a whore's gift
You niggas know I eat the pasta with the swordfish
Nigga, it's just the Lord's wish
I'm posted on the golf course with the horses
They say I'm looking like a whore's gift
You niggas know I eat the pasta with the swordfish
Promise, this is the Lord's wish

[Verse 2]
Cash we earning up in Nashville, sip the nasty bourbon
Wrap the grass up like a cabbie turban
The hashish burning, got it smelling like heroine and lemon
Dog my life is splendid
Popped a Vicodin with Eva Mendes
Put on the garments, then I hit the exit
You know the method to my madness
Steam the cabbage while finger fucking your dad's bitch
I'm such a savage
When will it stop, never
Watch the sun climb up the mountain top
Then bungee jump into the fountain drop
The seats was aqua
So fucking drunk that the nigga ruined the opera
You can see the mobster in my posture
Sock a nigga out his Chakra, it's Dolla
Light up the skama, nigga
