[Intro]
Niggas know
As if you ain't mafucka
Free Porter
Yeah, So
Yeah, So
Uh

[Verse]
Sippin' hectic (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, as of late I debate the decisions I've made
They call me reckless
No love is stronger than hate
So I keep a tre eight within arms reach
Going hard 'til I'm under palm trees
Cop my momma that crib 'cross seas
Red dot your eye, nigga cross me
That mean I'm crossin' my T's and I'm dottin' my I's
Lost in the world like the Lord of the Flies
They in the whip but will these niggas ride
Hell no, you screamin' "Don't pull the car over!"
Can't even come  into my mom's sober
Sendin' packs out Daytona
Sign' that deal, now it's game on ya
Young nigga move like ya big homie
Sold over time, so the trap on me
Roll up my billies they black for me
Bompton P's they cap for me
Mannerisms of a maniac
Plot on coppin' me a baby Mac
Sold out shows, you know they payin' racks
Some young hoe gave me brain in fact
Habits they turn into needs and worse
To be honest really need a blunt
Spun around the block and then we seen a chump
Let off a- *gun shots*

[Hook x4]
Drugs in my body that shouldn't be
Fuckin' these bitches you couldn't be
Doin' shit they say we wouldn't be
Yeah, So, Yeah, So
