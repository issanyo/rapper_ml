Yeah yeah, Yeah So

[Verse 1]
Just got a text message from God
Tryna collect off a bet that I lost
Delete the convo because I was sauced
Them cigarettes got me with death in my cough
Eighth letter member, you know it's the squad
First nigga flexing, the next to get robbed
Gave her some X, now I'm sexing your broad
Skin look like I'm in the Mexican mob
Drugs smell like murder, raps are superb
Dropping my shit, that keeps breaking the server
Never did college, ain't flipping no burgers
Do it for nigga's that serve in the earner
Dolla, 'bout money nigga, holla
Tell ya main bitch swallow
Never did pradas, mad crimes white collar
Ralph got me looking like a scholar
Father the flow y'all tryna bite
Down on 'em like ya sniffing on a ball of ice
Way I spit it motherfucker like I'm Walter White
Way I whip it motherfucker I can name the price
So I'm breaking mad bread, whether good or bad
Glad or sad, 'til I pull up in that '97 Jag
Dead face is off the dope smoke
Foreign model gone off them orange bottle drugs
I introduced her to cocaine in the cuticles
I'm showing you just who is who
Due praise, I'm the highest
A fucking god like Poseidon
I brought that wave that you riding, nigga

17 More Minutes every time, every time you see me
Just know it's 17 More Minutes you not gon' see me
Global (bitch ass niggas) you know the rest

[Verse 2]
Still the same nigga mama told you not to hang with
Smoking 'til the whip turn to spaceship
Nigga's said that I wouldn't make it
Now I'm getting paid just to say shit
Dope got a nigga with a facelift
Hoes, only know 'em by they faces
Catch a charge, pay the Jew, what it do?
Lawyer beat the shit, no matter what the case is
Plot to hoes with [?]
You would think my vocab float
Whip the color casserole
Posted bumping Chad and Hov
That smoking out, pouring up
Keep that lean up in my cup
X-A-N-A-X in my system
OG kush up in my blunt
Got my heart feeling like a slug
Damn, I think my shit gon' stop
Said you got a problem nigga
When you see me, go and pop
Guaranteed you getting hopped
Cause nigga we don't do the feds, really

(Weed got me 9th Grade high)
Really

I don't understand
Stop, spark it, light it back up
Smoking out something

[Hook x2]
Still throwed off the dope (pour)
Still fucking hoes
Still getting dough
I still be needing more
Still faded, still faded
That don't mean you made it
I ain't make this shit so that the radio could play it

[Outro/Breakdown]
So, act like you fucking know
Act like you fucking know, nigga
Nigga, act like you fucking know
Said act like you fucking know
Act like you fucking know, nigga
Act like you fucking know
Said act like you fucking know
Act like you fucking know, nigga
Act like you fucking know
Said act like you fucking know, nigga
