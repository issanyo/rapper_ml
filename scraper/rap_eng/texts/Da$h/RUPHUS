[Intro]
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Yeah so
Yeah so
Free Mav, nigga
Yo

[Verse 1]
Been getting high since it wasn't cool
Soul provider of the fucking school
All that cotton had me popping like a set of tools
Stretching workout like a octopus tentacles
Getting top in the citadel
Futuristic, dreamt it, then I lived it
To do the drugs you gotta know the physics
Never limping from the pimping
Weighed down from what I got that clip in, hammer back
Paranoia from the hammer pack
Attila the hun, with a gun and a dub in a rum backwood
Ahead of my time, be the nigga my dad should
Coulda, woulda, booger sugar got me hype
Well you "tomorrow never promised" ass niggas die tonight
You a stain like some wine on white
Them dime bitches like to dine on rice
Drinking so much think I signed on Sprite
When I'm under I'll be high off life, nigga
The day I'm under I'll be high off life
Dime bitches like to dine on rice
The day I'm under I'll be high off life, nigga
Fuck you dog
Fuck you thought it was?
Cause if you ain't know
Cause if you ain't know
Cause if you ain't know

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo
Why the ones I say I love hate me most
These snake niggas and groupies play me close, afraid to know
Hate to show this little thing we call emotion
Rather lie and say I'm fine, high, hoping you wouldn't notice
But you know this, still, you coping
Blame my name in the game, saying money my only focus
And I can't tell you no
But, from my angle, baby girl you just my Angel
Cause I swear I been to Hell before
Wrote it down hoping you believe me
My momma seen me on the TV, this is anything but easy
Lately, I been feeling crazy but that ain't new
The pills I ate blue, the weed tasting like grapefruit
So what's the point in knowing if it isn't true
And what the fuck you tryna be if it isn't you
Emulating is degrading and aspiring is tiring
In these streets just like a tyrant, only see me when I'm firing

[Outro]
It's Dolla
Nigga
That's it
