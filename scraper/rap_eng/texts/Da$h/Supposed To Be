Life is just what it's supposed to be
Can't let nobody get close to me

And I'm up in a foreign bitch ovaries
Yeah, so, life is just what it's supposed to be
Yeah, so, swear that the money controllin' me
Life is just what it's supposed to be
Can't let nobody get close to me
Catch me a flight to go overseas
And I'm up in a foreign bitch ovaries
Yeah, so, life is just what it's supposed to be
Yeah, so, swear that the money controllin' me

[Verse 1]
Give me the whip and I overspeed
Get a bad bitch, put her on her knees
Shit, they only tryna lock up the gang in here
Niggas been throwin' ones, there's a camera here
Give me the mention, I overdo it
Tell me the moves and I oversteer
Count it, lil nigga, we gettin' to it
He keep talkin' that hot shit, we get him wet
Aye, where the dope nigga roll at?
Get the dope, nigga, hold that
Said smoke blow the door back

Say I need the bitches, leave with her and her
Know I'm in the Benzes, I'm gonna swerve
Like yeah, so, so

[Chorus]
Life is just what it's supposed to be
Can't let nobody get close to me
Catch me a flight to go overseas
And I'm up in a foreign bitch ovaries
Yeah, so, life is just what it's supposed to be
Yeah, so, swear that the money controllin' me
Life is just what it's supposed to be
Can't let nobody get close to me
Catch me a flight to go overseas
And I'm up in a foreign bitch ovaries
Yeah, so, life is just what it's supposed to be
Yeah, so, swear that the money controllin' me

[Verse 2]
Aye, they know I can serve it
Aye, ride around, bitch, I am whippin' that shit and she perfect
