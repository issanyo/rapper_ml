[Intro]
Fuck 12 *distorted*
About like half a pint in, ain't even 10 AM
Radric Davis would be proud, and be ashamed of you faggot ass niggas
RIP Screw, Blackout Boyz, uh

[Hook: Da$H]
Mask up on our faces so we never caught the cases
Young niggas trapping, rapping, now we living dangerous
Never gave a shit, so what we wanted, yeah, we take it
Pistol in my lap, I'm just avoiding complications
This .30 in this bitch, I get to busting, ain't no aiming
It's Mr. Never Lacking, packing every situation
My bitch think I’m gon' die from this fucking high that I'm chasing
Fuck 'bout being famous, my niggas popping, I make it

[Verse 1: Da$H]
I'm sick of niggas lying 'bout everything that they rhyming
I'm riding through your hood, you ain't never there, you hiding
It's like the playing manhunt, these pussy niggas ain't stand-up
Before they throw they hands up these faggots'll pull they cam up
RIP [?], I'm on my Pimp C diet
Shit, I wonder why a nigga ain't died yet
Six lines, seven ounces, ain't high yet
Nine blunts, ten pills, I ain't flying yet
B-L-K-O-U-T-B-O-Y-Z
'Til I'm six F-E-E-T, yeah, you know me
Dolla general, second in command
Got the bag of rolled greens in the middle of my hand
You wasn't down with the fucking clique if you ain't have no bread
Just understand, but enough with the sentiment
Intelligent degenerate, you buying it, I'm selling it
Rolling with some predicates, going where the cheddar is
You fucking know

[Hook: Da$H]
Mask up on our faces so we never caught the cases
Young niggas trapping, rapping, now we living dangerous
Never gave a shit, so what we wanted, yeah, we take it
Pistol in my lap, I'm just avoiding complications
This .30 in this bitch, I get to busting, ain't no aiming
It's Mr. Never Lacking, packing every situation
My bitch think I’m gon' die from this fucking high that I'm chasing
Fuck 'bout being famous, my niggas popping, I make it

[Verse 2: $ha Hef]
Fuck aiming, I'm shooting at will
He dead but I'm shooting him still
My pops told me shoot 'til he still
He pussy, go in for the kill
Black Market be killing for real
My young niggas shoot for a thrill
Where I'm from we don't pray for a deal
Miracle, you get bond or appeal
Every night I sleep tight with the steel
My lil billies go fight for a meal
I pour fo's in my Sprite 'til it spill
You might just lose your life on a drill
Da$H told me "get 'em" I got 'em all
Wasn't gon' leave 'til I shot 'em all
Scope on the pistol, I spot 'em all
If it's a stain, then we spot 'em all
Bitch watchu need, know I got it all
Roxies, got oxies, got Tylenol
Po'd up an eighth then I nodded off
He was running his mouth 'til I shot it off
Chopped up the body, then drop it off
Nose on the shotty, we chop it off
If it's a problem then pop it off
'Fore I have to cock the rocket, knock it off
I was really getting trap money
Percocet and that crack money
You can come and get a pack from me
Still clap a nigga if he act funny
Off every drug, I'ma blackout
Still ride around with the Mac out
Water whipping, beat the pack out
Now it got me bringing all these racks out

[Hook: Da$H]

[Verse: Man Z]
Mugga back up on his grind, I think I'm losing my mind
Niggas be lying, niggas be dropping them dimes
Baby girl don't waste my time, [?] is fine
Business calls all on my line, all 'bout them B's and I'm fine
Nigga that's righteous, all of my niggas they tight
They gon' get money and fight, then hop on the flight
Squad deep, know the set I claim, always let it reign on my side of town
Graduated from the streets nigga with some Henny stains on my cap and gown
Xans all in my draws homie, that white man in my pocket
Fuck 12, I don't know shit, bitch KOD, you can't knock it
Locked in the studio we stay, life of them diamonds everyday
Run to the money, no relay, bring that shit back like a replay
Shorty let's kick it like East bay, she wanna fuck me what she say
Gimme a minute then we play, M-I, Dama Quince
I just be tryna get my chicken, niggas cry broke, yeah they all bitching
Over the stove where the hoes whipping, after they done, clean the whole kitchen
I'm a real nigga, don't know snitching, all by the bag, all I know riches
All on the fill, all my foes pitching, slice up your neck, have your throat missing

[Hook: Da$H]
