(Blunts smell like Jungle Love)

17 More Minutes nigga

[Verse]
They pinning stripes on the Lieutenant
My woman fulfilling the manuals written
Your crew get diminished
The motherfucking food chain, you in it
Appearance of a spirit, tend to the business
Tinted windows, hoes froze in a cement pose
[?] of the Jag, the color of a dead rose
Tony Stark the way the chest glow
Blow a gauge Rudolph the red nose
Skybox at the Jets home
Rest assured, lock it down like some prison doors
Import the whore from Singapore, marble my kitchen floor
I like my brain on the prescription drawer
The prey stray when the lion roar
Remove the sword from the sheathe
The war the only thing that brought the peace
We taught to never talk to the police
Another wolf hunting the sheep
Rolling up that pack by the heat
Turning rappers to the walking deceased, nigga

If you ain't know

Headshots

[Hook]
Just a shit talking, blunt sparking
Pill popping, pint drinking
Ain't no telling what my mind thinking
Type of nigga, I guess it figgaz
You got the frame without the picture
I guess it figgaz, I guess it figgaz
Since they cut the cord I been that nigga
I guess it figgaz, I guess it figgaz, you see
That Ralph Lauren be the stiching
I guess it figgaz, I guess it figgaz
Bitch is never rolling swishers
I guess it figgaz, I'm getting figures
Fucking on y'all bitches
Getting figures, guess it figgaz
Getting figures, guess it figgaz
Getting figures
It's global, nigga

{​​​​​​Hopscotch}​​​​​​

[Verse]
With both of my eyelids closed I'm seeing through you niggas
Painting pictures that were shown before
The way I'm rapping got 'em hoping I ain't on they tour
The Doors bumping through Accord speakers
Getting paid from corner store speeches
Jesus got leeches removing toxins from the overdose
It ain't the first one or the last either
I craft ether and attract divas
Snuff suckers and deny preachers
I'm most hated like your math teacher
Distribute the kill cause rap don't pay the bills yet
I lead the team like Belichick, it's all dubs
And don't ever think because you saw respect it's all love
I don't fuck with you, Heisenberg, you niggas more than Huxtables
Puffing something new that my grower just grew
Another wolf leading the sheep to the slaughter
Another nigga sliding dick in ya daughter
Another rapper from right over that water
Live nigga, throw my face on the hunnit
Write philosophies at home getting blunted
Drug experiments have turned into habits
All my days have fucking turned into madness
They say I'm snapping cause I'm reaching the masses
With whatever when it comes to that cabbage, nigga

[Hook x2]
Charlie Manson skill set
Jack and Jill ain't never left the hill that's why they still bent
Drugs where the steel kept
They fear the real so I ain't got no fucking deal yet
