[Verse]
My name DA$H, I like Polo linen and foreign women
Good weed and nice jaws, striving to be a rap star
18 years old, I'm always high, a few tattoos
Ask the right people, they'll tell you I got some loose screws
But anyway that's besides the point
Couple trees, I roll my joint and then I think some
Scheming on ways to expand my income
Cop my Moms a crib, a couple Benzes
And have my niece sitting up in more diamonds than a prism
While my eyez glazed, wipe the ashes from my pants
Smoking on this earth, I guess the world is in my hands
Lately man the devil, she's been asking me to dance
Doing the money shuffle can't lie I'm tempted to take her hand
Yeah, hoping my angels understand
Yeah, I'm hoping my angels understand
Eyez glazed as I wipe the ashes from my pants
Smoking on this earth, I guess the world is in my...yeah so
