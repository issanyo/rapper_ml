Yeah, yeah so
Heirs to the throne
Why your bitch ain't coming home
Yeah so, Ski Beatz
Yeah, so
D-A-dolla-sign-H, nigga
Yeah

[Verse 1]
High enough to keep my eyes shut
The moneys where you'll find us
This shit got me in heaven, baby I think you should try some
Let our love blossom, she gone enough to take my words
She fine as hell, I'm tryna do her body what that bitch deserve
Plug your vein, baby let me ease your pain
She said she drink and smoke, I said I do the same
Chiefing on this reefer got her feeling strange
I'm in your mind, mama I'm just running game
Running game, baby I'm just running game
She said she drink and smoke, I said I do the same
Running game, baby I'm just running game
Running game...yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
It's 3:30 AM the time I come down
Tell my brother roll up
I pour up because I'm young, wild, and reckless
Live it 'til I'm breathless
Eighteen, I'm doing shit thats on your fathers checklist
Say you recollect this then miss me
Wrote a book, it couldn't convince me
Killing niggas, Iceman RicHie Kuklinski
Pen in my right hand, joint in my left
And this weed is so loud that I think I'm going deaf, so
Way I'm feeling got my top pushed back
Another hit of this, another sip of that
Way I'm feeling got my top pushed back
Another sip of this, another hit of that
I ain't smoking on no piff, pass me that Cognac
Another hit of this, another sip of that, yeah
Way I'm feeling got my top pushed back
Another hit of this, another sip of...yeah so
