[Intro]
Yeah So, Yeah So
Keep me in 17 More
I don't know where it's going, any time

[Hook]
Now or Never, fuck what's later
Have you ever fucked up paper
Life a jungle, couldn't tame us
Momma tried, but couldn't save us
Now or Never, the fuck is later
Have you ever fucked up paper
Drug related, gang related
Momma tried, couldn't save us

[Verse 1]
Still just a nigga from that 2-0-UNO
You ain't heard about my set, bitch what the fuck do you know
One fifty what it be when I was in that two door
No license, riding, we kicking like it was judo
You know, yeah, so
I ain't a simple man, I'm into sinful things
I get to pulling at mental strings
You looking for freaks to bring
I'm hoping that you ain't possess
It's that I be excessive, I just thought I should mention
I ain't the one you should question
If you talk a lil less it would learn you a lesson

[Pre-Hook]
I'm never lacking, thought you knew it
Say he thugging, nigga here your chance to prove it
Peak in Heaven, life can't fade me
90's baby, grimy, brazy, 'til they come and pay me, pay me

[Hook]
Now or Never, fuck what's later
Have you ever fucked up paper
Life a jungle, couldn't tame us
Momma tried, but couldn't save us
Now or Never, the fuck is later
Have you ever fucked up paper
Drug related, gang related
Momma tried, couldn't save us

[Verse 2]
It's Mr. State-To-State and rocking shit
Continent to continent
Pop him if he popping shit
No gun, then we hopping shit
Better call the doctor bitch
Said it then I did it too
Trouble then a physical
Count up my residuals, yeah
Don't try and be me, it's difficult
This shit is chess it ain't checkers
Just tryna fuck me a check up
Fuck on your bitch and I left her
Cannot explain it, I'm living different
Amber Alert to my mind, it's missing
Nose on the strap look like Scotty Pippen
Wifey so dirty like Kathy Griffin

[Pre-Hook]
I'm never lacking, thought you knew it
Say he thugging, nigga here your chance to prove it
Peak in Heaven, life can't fade me
90's baby, grimy, brazy, 'til they come and pay me, pay me
