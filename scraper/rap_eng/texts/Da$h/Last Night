My crib smells of best trees and mahogany
Breathe smelling like Hennesse and lobster
That's why your bitch so fond of me
Real pimp shit player, don't act like you ain't know
Got a boss bitch, fuck I look like with some skank hoe?
Counting my bankrolls, Jose Canseco
How I hit it out the park
Fuck with bad hoes, only hit 'em after dark
Cause see in the daytime I grind
Clearly getting what's mine
Quarters, nickels, dimes, and dollas
If you need something then holler
Only 'bout my paper though
What the fuck was you thinking? I'm smoking and drinking
I want something then like a pirate I take it
It's a cold world someone get 'em a blanket
Jeez, at ease, I'm high up off these trees
It's tasting like it's diesel, Dan said it was sour cheese
I believed 'em
Put it in the jar, departed to the cave
Now I'm in front this mic recording shit I'll do onstage
And I'll prolly be getting paid
But that's just what I see in the future
And this life that I'm leading alluring
Cause money and weed ain't that hard to get used to
Word is bond yeah, I'm on that
That Hiroshima bomb rap
That I just smoked a eighth of weed and hash up out this bong
I can't control it, power I gotta hold it
Respect I have it, money, tryna stack more
I was a pharaoh in my past life
I went to sleep and had a dream I sat and counted a million cash
Just, just, just (Last Night)
Yeah so
