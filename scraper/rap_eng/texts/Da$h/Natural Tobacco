Proficient drug user
Hello, hello, hello
Yeah, So
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, parents proud and shamed, their little boy ain't quite the same
Crime from pay, my family members had a lot to say
I disregard it, crumble reefers while cigar split
Getting a blow job from a dog bitch
Sipping the Henny on the park bench
Now all my hoes is foreign
It's palm trees in places I'm recording
Just touched down a couple months a touring
George and Diego with the money hoarding
I die enormous before living dormant
And still I need more
Four door, the same color as s'mores
Eight story loft, can't see my shit from the floor
Rub my gudda, actress crushing a raw, yeah
From afar I hear the wave to the shore
I know they see the decor

[Hook x2]
What is life for a nigga like me
Backwood leafs, bad bitch on both knees
Riding with my team
Plotting on some more cheese
Roll some more trees
It's all I need, it's all I need

[Verse 2]
Shouts to all them niggas packs that I ripped
Back in school, so I ain't have to brown bag it and shit
Now they call my raps classic and shit
Every track is a flip, the cabbage gets split
So everybody eat
Road to riches, take the highway or the fucking streets
I take the path not traveled then sail the English Channel
Spit the psychobabble
I pray the judge don't drop the gavel
Mashed potatoes with the prime rib, or the cattle
Don't tell the tales, I never tattle, trust me
Watch my main man turn to a junkie
I swear, this game of life ain't always fun b
Lost a few friends over this thing called money too
And know it is, I wish it wasn't true, fuck
So with the ones that remain through these escapades
Execute the plan and all the cheques is made
Niggas find your remains if all your debts ain't paid
The board is chess whenever checkers played
H'z, bitch

[Hook 2x]
What is life for a nigga like me
Backwood leafs, bad bitch on both knees
Riding with my team
Plotting on some more cheese
Roll some more trees
It's all I need, it's all I need
