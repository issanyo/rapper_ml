Gun smoke, gun smoke, everywhere I go it's gun smoke
Niggas 'round me, they some Cutthroats
Need the bread, getting dumb loaves
Like, fuck with us, you getting fucked off
In a whip, colour duck sauce
Say I need me a benz and I need me a Guatti
I got me some hoes and these drugs in they body
Don't need me no convo, just need you to top me
Really man, ain't feel this way in a minute, rack up them digits
Ain't keeping count, what the fuck am I spending
Check 'round my neck, I got two chainz like I'm Tiddy Boy
Ride with the fire through the city, boy
Shit I got might clear the block
Neighbours hitting floors when they hear the noise
Like huh, yeah

We taking risks for the change, so
We did this shit with a stain, yeah
We ain't do shit for the clout, so
We did this shit for the gang, yeah
Niggas know they can't relate, huh
None of us 'round here is fake, huh
Counting up all of this pay, huh
Eighth letter gang, get it straight
Cleaning up the diamonds, toothbrush [?]
FTP sitting on top the vest
Diamonds double dutching around my neck
Feel like Big Soulja, got stacks on deck
