And it was all good just a week ago
But now it's next Monday and these niggas acting funny
Well that's what happen ([?])
Cause mothafucker, only worried 'bout my H'z and my money (Dummy, yeah so, look)
High as hell, living that YSL
Shouts out to Niko Jersey, looking through my peep-hole
Gotta make sure I know the nigga, don't fuck with certain people
Get some change, you'll see how they'll treat you
Got the joint burning to the point it sting my finger
Lil brother calling I can tell it by the ringer
He put me on these dates, yeah I'm talking 'bout these shows
Watch these hoes about their dough, cuz some agents turn to essence
Shit you know how that go...nigga, yeah so
