[Intro]
Fuck you doin'
Yeah, yeah, so, bitch
Yeah, yeah, so, yeah, yeah, so
You wanna smoke?
Yeah, yeah, so, yeah, yeah, so
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Told that bitch like hold up, shawty, where you goin’?
Bitch, come pull up and show me some, show me some
Told that bitch like hold up, shawty, where you goin'?
Bitch, come pull up and show me some, show me some
With my niggas countin' paper just like usual
Aye, just like usual, woah, aye, just like usual
With my niggas countin’ paper just like usual
Aye, just like usual, woah, just like usual

[Verse]
Ho, you know I got that Rollie 'cause a nigga pressed for time
Came up on that block where niggas known for sellin' dimes
And niggas known for doin' crimes, but catch me doin' rap shit
All you niggas clap shit, my niggas come through, clap shit
The fuck is you? Fuck is you from?
Came up in this bitch like too deep, me and my gun
Hoes, they look at him like, "Who's he?"
Yeah, they know that nigga Dolla, baby
Come through, I'ma catch your baby momma
Make her swallow, baby, huh
Catch me ridin' Bimmer, no S
With some bitches sniffin’ so much powder, they hear snow bells
Fuck her for a couple hours, as soon as my phone ringin’
Can't fuck with you or your mans
I heard that you was both singin’, so
Private location, can't see me
European bitch always askin' for the wi-fi
Told that bitch to shake it fast like I was Lil Weezy
And she baby father, bitch, you know you wanna be me

[Chorus]
Told that bitch like hold up, shawty, where you goin'?
Bitch, come pull up and show me some, show me some
Told that bitch like hold up, shawty, where you goin’?
Bitch, come pull up and show me some, show me some
With my niggas countin' paper just like usual
Aye, just like usual, woah, aye, just like usual
With my niggas countin' paper just like usual
Aye, just like usual
