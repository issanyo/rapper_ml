Say Jude I really wanna see you nude
I don't mean to be rude though (yeah)
Say Jude I really wanna see you nude
I don't mean to be rude though (yeah)
Yeah so, nigga

[Verse 1: Da$h]
King of spades, bitch from Spain, it's the kitchen maid
Gettin' paid at a rate my mother in disarray
Wrote the book and never read a page
Burnin' a 50 feel like Nickie Cage
Gone in 60 seconds
Every time we speak you cry, that's why I stick to textin'
Smoked a bowl before I sent the message
Sayin' we homies 'til the very endin'
Say without me you'll die
Can't reply so I just hit the exit
Fuck, just my luck, in the terminal, pissy drunk
Catch a flight across the country just to chase a buck
Rollin' stone, rollin' stone, call too many places home at times
How many lives I'm livin? four or five
Each one I'm surely high
Yuri Orlov
Fake ID as I'm checking in the Waldorf
A fuckin' warlord
Russian escort who going to blow me 'til my balls sore
Fuck you think I laid these bars for?
Car door open backwards
Bitch's ass like an allergic reaction
She service my faction
Smoke some shit that should've came with a caption
All my actions be considered as classic
Free Maverick, nigga, I fuckin' meant that, uh
Free Maverick and all my other cold b's
Every chance I get I tell a cop to blow me
Breath smell like a 40 and a half an ounce
Bitches hometowns be some shit a nigga can't pronounce
Stash the drugs in her lips that's under her salmon blouse
Life a movie by the way this shit is pannin' out, ya nah mean?
Caught up with my greens, endo and cash flow
Own mother think I'm an asshole
So? think I care about about a bashful nigga?
You better hope that I don't catch you, nigga
Stomp your boss your team'll take the loss
Slide off in the beigest Porsche, nigga
Your team'll make the rules, my niggas break the laws
Just a corpse, yeah so
