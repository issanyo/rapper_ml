[Verse 1: RetcH]
Break up and roll it, light it then smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, loud pack, that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rolling, this pill got me open
These bad hoes is grunting, they bootys is poking
Out them little dresses, and a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke, but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk, and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own drugs, and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wylin, new drugs, I try 'em
Hood call me RetcH, but your bitch call me Brian
In Polo, I'm styling, that's all that I'm rocking
And if you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm trapping
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from rapping
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clapping
Seen it on a video, he yapping to the captain
That nigga snitching, R86 him
These niggas trannies cause these niggas switching
And these niggas bitching more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds and bitches all day
Take her out to eat, then I make a bitch pay
And my wine on chill, and my shrimps saut√©ed
And I'm chilling in LA with a bitch from the bay

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found E.T
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some game
Just to get up in her brain and now she out making me change
I'm really dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
Throw the pad at Christ, they asking God how do I write this stuff
Don't know if he ever liked me much, but I'm saying oh well
Blazing L's with the devil, watching old Hell in a Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blasted, naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break you say I ain't the illest nigga rapping
And fucking captain of this multi-million dollar faction
Commander and chief, my sons the son of Sam with the beef
We get loot, always ran from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew to [?], cheffing out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches telling me they do sniff, what do you know
So much wax in this blunt I'm smoking you'd think I'm fucking Madame Tussauds
Shit, I'm out of it yo, nah, fuck that, bring them fucking drums back
Light a dub sack for my niggas locked who slung crack
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
Fucker I'm the greatest, carve a statue from my face, bitch
