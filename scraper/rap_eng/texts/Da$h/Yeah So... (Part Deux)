Just copped this quarter, 'bout to go to the store
For some backwoods, threw on my ACGs, don't fuck with them [?]
Them whores outside too, even though it's cold
Young'n bold, never doing what I'm told
You would think I sold my soul to the Devil, a rebel
These rap niggas is puppets, bitch you looking at Geppetto
I'm only rolling fifties, any less I'll never settle
Had her screaming now she dreaming
Put the bitch in a falsetto, like damn...
(Yeah) but don't mind me, I'm on some high shit
Not that five niggas putting ten up for a dime shit
Quarter whole and half zips, when it's getting passed bitch
I'm only blowing sour and kush, niggas is passed piff
Pothead, don't smoke? then drop dead
Copping so much that my bud-man always seem to give me cred and
Swear these trees the only thing keeping me sane
I'm so muhfucking high I think a cloud replaced my brain
It's not a game
Yeah, yeah, it's not a game
Yeah, yeah, it's not a game
Only thing keeping me sane
So muhfucking high I think a cloud replaced my brain, like

Aight

Yeah So Yeah So Yeah So Yeah So
Yeah So Yeah So Yeah So Yeah So
Yeah So Yeah So Yeah So Yeah So
