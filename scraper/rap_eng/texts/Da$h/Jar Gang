So I'm fighting my cotton mouth with this lemonade
Plan to make it seemed to turn me to a renegade
Pen and page, show 'em I ain't scared to say shit
How college ain't for me, and a degree? I couldn't chase it
Have to make it
Fuck I look like stressing writing papers, needing cake
And knowing that my fucking talent being wasted, nah
Not me, shout out Nasty Nell
These women and my vices made that cash appeal
Because I'm slipping for the paper, nigga that's for real
Blunt facing everyday, just tryna catch a thrill
These hoes tell me what I'm spitting, nigga kinda far out
Ran out of weed, told my brother break the jar out

Yeah, told my brother break the jar out
Got no Ls, told that nigga bring the car out
Tell me what I'm spitting is far out
Ran outta weed tell that nigga break the jar out
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Did somebody just come up here?
