[The Unsual Suspects]

Yeah So
Free Castro, Hz
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
Young nigga trill, like a S-U-C tape
Tryna get high to the point I can't see straight
Mix these beats with the grapes, man, then I see pape'
I'm on my second tour, I hit a whore in 'bout every state
Yeah, D-A-DOLLA, from the motherfucking Hz tribe
Living fast, they asking how the fuck I stay alive
I gives it up, I'm only worried 'bout my chips and bucks
These simping fucks study my game because they pimp and suck
It's evident, treated like the motherfucking president
High up in my air force one, top gun
You know Tom Cruise on these hoes, I move on these hoes
Only tongue these bitches see is from my shoes on these hoes
Middle finger and my dick to anybody that appose me
Got money in the street from what my older brother showed me
Now I get money off rap from what I learned from the big homies
That nigga George Lucas couldn't motherfucking clone me

Yeah So
Hz nigga
Fast Money
Free Cash
