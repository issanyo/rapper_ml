[Intro]
I get my work from a Narco
Yeah, yeah, so, so, yeah, yeah, so
So, yeah, yeah, so, so, yeah, yeah, so
Yeah, yeah, so, go super
Yeah, so

[Verse]
I'm tryna fuck the city up like I was Two-Face
My bitch, she doin' them pills, she havin' mood swings like she Two-Face
I only grab the grip if it's a Tuesday
Swervin' lane-to-lane, I'm takin' police on a goose chase
And if I hit this cup, I get a toothache
Baker hit my line, we got a deal for some new cake
Nigga, I'd be lyin', sayin' I didn't see it
Ridin' in the Bimmer, hoe mouth a vacuum cleaner
And I'm finna duck them hoes, they say I'm meaner now
Fuck the Jordans, cop abortions, I don't need a child
Ain't nobody heard the shots because the speakers loud
Them hoes that left me when I'm down, blow the smoke on them then smile
Throw a band on a nigga bitch, bet she pick it up
Can't record 'em dance, I'm mad I gave a fuck
Probably back in days when we was up in Kiefer truck
I ain't seen it, then a nigga, you should fuckin' duck
But on another note, I'm smokin' on some other smoke
Something you ain't tasted, something you ain't smelled before
Fuckin' with a bitch, she said she never took a pill before
But we gon' change that, give me my change back

[Chorus]
You get your chain snatched, we can arrange that
We can arrange that, nigga, we can arrange that
We can arrange that, we can arrange that
We can arrange that, nigga, we can arrange that
