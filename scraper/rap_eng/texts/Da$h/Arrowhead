[Verse 1: DA$H]
Feeling higher than the dirt sitting on Zeus's shoulders
Lifting boulders, take a *sniff* and then she getting colder
Dank aroma, with a bitch the same color as cola
Prescription medicine up in my soda
Motorola pager clicking O, all about my chicken, hoe
I'm super saiyan four, you weak ass niggas playing piccolo
Sipping while I'm gripping wheels, you know that I'm riding
Drinking while I'm driving, and I still ain't got no license
Convinced this bitch to lick me while I down my mickey's
Straight whore out your daughter, telling Porter, "roll a fifty"
Better yet a quarter, ash it 'til I'm feeling misty
But never pass it, cause I don't fuck with niggas, Clayton Bigsby
So miss me with the tough shit
Cause I'm on my call your bluff shit
Flow harder than a drunk fist
After a 40, couple blunts, and a rum 1/5th
Don't want it if it ain't deluxe bitch
H'z nigga, that's what I rep, I got the set blasted
To the box shit, couple white bitches on suboxone
Latina bitch like that oxy, black bitch molly, tonight she doing roxie
Intelligent, degenerate, you buying it, I'm selling it
I'm breaking down a backwood filled with dope and I'm inhaling it
Mind, I'm expelling it to bass and instrumentals
She asked me what I like, money and drugs is what I'm into

[Verse 2: RetcH]
Forever thugging, du-rag with my shirt open
When I walk past, you smell potent, got your girl open
She wan' smoke, finger her over, bring your friend witcha'
Can't cop dutchess because these fuckers only sell swishers
Fuck it it's whatever, I'm still gon' be high as ever
Because I'm smoking on better, weed crumbs on a Polo sweater
AKA my life in a nutshell
Shit I grew up and that's wherever blunts fell
Remember I had a bitch, her name was Vivica
Went to meet her parents, was smelling like heavy indica
We ain't work out, I'ma come clean, I got cursed out
Finished eating my dinner and merked out
Finna go lay up with my safe bitch
Goddamn, I swear that ain't the same bitch
But guess we all change, some for the better
Some be for the worst, I can't front it fucking hurt
Somedays catch me thinking where the fun go now
I'm still that motherfucking nigga when the sun go down
When the sun go down
Somedays I be thinking, where the fun go now
Somedays catch me thinking, where the fun go now
Where the fun go now, where the motherfucking fun go now
