[Verse 1: SONNYJIM]

I'm in the new BM bumping Brand Nubian
Q of peng in the super slim
The exclusive elusive prince excuse my French
I cop Peruvian and rock the Cuban link
Kid tuck ya dookie in, the born again Oakland pimp
High exulted in a golden mink
Bitch wilin off the leash like a Dobermann
Prince of Zamunda when I preach from my podium
Bureaucrat dabbin this imported hash
Got here by wateraft now eat the soft shell tempura crab
The belvedere on ice that blueberry pie
Im too weird to live too rare to die
Take a look at shorty
She say love my story, and if I get nicked shell cover for me
Life is hunkydory I'm in the german whip something sporty
Hit a lick and send some money to my uncle Paulie
I'm powerlifting til the albums finished
For now its all about the vegetables and salmon fillets
I'm a gambler fam I do it how my daddy it
And this is hometown family business
Trees are twisted like Neneh Cherry talkin 80/20
With a dime that's down to dyke it out like Katy Perry
She been good since day she met me, life is good
I blaze the henry while she make spaghetti

[Hook / Scratches x2] (Prodigy/Havoc)

Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
My theme is all about making the green
Living up in luxury, pushing phat whips and living comfortably

[Verse 2: Da$H]

Fucking on a damsel in distress, I'm just another manic that's depressed
Smoking cannabis to cancel out my stress
My hoes is saying I'm a mess, counting money, know I'm caring less
Doing chowder while the xanax getting pressed
I'm just a trap nigga rapping, known to make it happen
Mr. 'fore he started asking questions, started clapping
The captain of the pirate ship, been on this wyling shit
Half these faggots need a motherfucking stylist
Same outfit three weeks, I probably got more in my pockets than your album did
You motherfuckers counterfit
Don't need an ounce, I need a pound of it
Shopping for hammers, thinking 'bout what type of rounds to get
Our problems ain't the same, a product of the game
Counting change, fuck a hoe, don't even know her name
The devil don't sleep, and neither do I
Never do speak, cause nigga I'm high
Ready to die like Christopher Wallace, we pitching that product
You niggas is watchers, got coppers for coppers
If it's 'bout money than holla, nigga, nigga
Yeah, you know that it's Dolla, shit, if it's 'bout money then holla, nigga

[Hook / Scratches x2] (Prodigy/Havoc)

Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
My theme is all about making the green
Living up in luxury, pushing phat whips and living comfortably
