[Intro: A$AP Ant]
In a trance take a glance
This casino life, [?] rolling dice
Toking weed at stoplights
Fly [?] with night
Ocean dreaming, cat litter, trife life
Smoking backwoods out the windpipe
Model shorty looking right
I think I might fuck tonight
In a trance take a glance
In a trance take a glance
In a trance take a glance

[Verse: Da$H]
I am smoking on that dope
Throwing ones at the stripper poll
Ice cold like my Jordan soles
And my London bitch she gonna have to roll
I smash her ass like she casserole
Hit the blunt and never ash at all
Hit the blunt and never pass it though
Nigga, never move unless cash involved
I'm tatted like a gang member
Bitch I am a gang member
Eighth letter nigga, none better
I feed my hoes cocaine dinners
Like Fergenstein, big money shit
Xan with that lean, yeah the druggy shit
MC Hammer, don't touch me bitch
Unless you tryna suck and fuck the clique
And never I'm lying
Think I ain't scared of dying
All these drugs that I'm trying
Brain, yeah I fried it
Smoking sour with Rico, he fresh off the island
And I'm fresh off a plane
Chasing what rhyme with my name
Come up the name of the game
And a young nigga know how to play, ay, ay
Yeah so, nigga
