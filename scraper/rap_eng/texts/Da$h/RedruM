[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Yeah, yo, yeah, yeah, yeah
17 More Minutes nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
It's Clark Bent behind a dark tint
I'm in the streets just like the park bench
Chain smoke cigar ends, they ain't no cigars left
My weed loud just like a bitch out the piece
They wanna blow me while I'm counting my cheese, Jesus
[?], snitch don't [?]
I see no honor in this thieving shit
Probably why I don't trust with niggas
If you ask me how I'm feeling then it's fuck you niggas
Look here, copped that ducy off a jackpot
Hoe had the blow in nose, Pinocchio
Plugs got hit with the okie doe
Started barking, had these niggas dancing, hokey pokey
Holy smokes he really burnt, Cobain, no chain
Get a shopper for his gold rings, I need them blunts too
Pocket full of dead crackers, living ass backwards
Tryna front for who, rap so my mama living comfortable
But who the fuck is you to judge me, my white cup is muddy
I'm bloody, hoes wanna fuck me
Doing all these drugs you think I must be
Off my fucking bike right, light it up
V'Don made the beat and then I scribed it up
This the type of shit you snatch up out your speakers
Load that pipe and beam up the scotty, illuminati
Got my mind, soul, and my body trapped or am I just smacked
Don't give me dap when you see me wearing trends
And don't hit my fucking line if you ain't talking 'bout no ends
Is how I'm feeling, wheeling and dealing, stealing and killing
Tryna make a motherfucking million, cause if you ain't know

[Hook: Da$H & Marz Lovejoy]
Said yo bitch only chill if she's fucking the team
If it's drama my nigga we bringing them thangs
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa
Murder scene, murder scene
Murder scene, murder scene
Murder scene, murder scene
