[Intro]
Members of the citizen's coucil, I am a simple soldier
And as a soldier I see things simply
I don't say all humans are evil, simply because their skin is white
No!
But our great law giver tells us that never, never will the humans have ape's divine facility
For being able to distinguish between evil and good
The only good human-is a dead human!

[Verse]
Nowadays I find myself smoking more than I used to
Arguing with my bitch a lil more than usual
I'm getting famous now, tryna to figure out who's who
Sacrificing somethings, sometimes it feels like a lose-lose
Some say I act the same age as my Jordan's
I feel the most at home when I'm in front this mic, recording
I slept my way through school cause I felt like the shit was boring
Teacher said I wouldn't be shit, in November I was touring
Now I'm packing up my suitcase, a new stage, new state
Some new weed, a new bitch who's fixing me up a new plate
With some new pussy and Newport, my mom say I should quit
My reply is life is too short, tryna cop shit out the Dupont
Registry to be exact, 2-0-1 is where I'm at
But I'm scheming on this cheese like a New York City rat
You can bet it, shooting movies, Heir Gang on the credits
Never taking no days off, bitch my name isn't Ferris
Blame my age cause I'm careless
Give a fuck 'bout what they saying, no
You getting in your bitch car, my CD is always playing, yo
Knocking haters off they ass, "why you had to slay 'em for?"
I tell 'em "what the fuck you think this rap shit isn't paying for"
A few things to be honest, I ain't tryna to be modest though I'm arrogant, lobster tail, and cheese on my asparagus
When somebody say "better" I hear "never"
Eighth letter representer 'til they put me in a carriage, kid
I meant a casket, lost a few eggs out my basket
On the way to 18, chasing bitches, making cream
You think I'm lying, you ain't know me
I'm looking for Naomi, Campbell for example
Drank about half of this handle

Fuck it, roll another one, I guess...
