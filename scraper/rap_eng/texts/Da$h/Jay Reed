[Verse 1: ASAP Twelvvy]
Many snakes in the grass, faith in my past
December 21st coming straight for that ass
No gay slander, but I'm not a fan of
Bitch made niggas just posing for the cameras
We know who you really are, internet superstar
Mr. Orange leave your dog drowning in the reservoir
You could never get the best of us
Mac live yo neck ajar yeah, that is Hollywood repertoire
Niggas be acting, my niggas be rappin'
Money and traffic, inglorious bastards
Mel Tarantino, Twelvy F Pachino
6 inch blacks in my Tee by Marino
Whore for the C-Notes
Some more with a Cee-Lo
Four, five, six pass me all that grip
Fly young fella, pro-tools terror
Words to my mom, we gon' own this era
Clever with the password, don't even ask for it
Twelvy know to blast first, even had a cash verse
Like a bank nigga, blowing on some dank
Getting higher than that plane shorty tell me what you think
'bout a bachelor slash trapper slash rapper
All that fly shit come after, no pastor
Flow NASA, with my brother Nasty
I highly doubt I’ll let these niggas get past me

[Hook]
Cause there ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, he scared to look, he shook
Catch a nigga on the late night
While he with his bitch like Cam at the brake light
Cause there ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, he scared to look, he shook
Catch a nigga on the late night
Why a nigga slipping like Harold at the brake light

[Verse 2: Da$h]
I'm only 19 but my mind is older
When this shit get for real my warm heart turn cold
Snuff a hipster rapper, knock the fucking chip off his shoulder
Later I have his main bitch coming over, she roll his weed
'fore she do the deed, studio with a jar of weed
Tryna turn a couple raps into a couple hundred Gs
Living out my dreams, I feel like I ain't slept in fucking weeks
Just to think this come from what I speak
Got my stain in this game, from stacking bread and pimping whores
Know I keep it low-key like a motherfucking midget door
High school I was pitching pills, a couple niggas did the raw
Sitting on a couple P's this rap shit was the other door
Yeah nigga chose it, now I got these hoes open
I fuck them, they tell they man their phone was broken
And I'm blowing on that potent whipping in the seven like it's stolen
Lots of niggas tellin´ me and my team was showin
And I'm riding east side till the spokes break
Leave the studio for a motherfucking smoke break
Get your main ho to come through for a throat break
Doin niggas like Richie
I'm Alpo, you don't know AZ, nigga

[Hook]
Cause there ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, he scared to look, he shook
Catch a nigga on the late night
While he with his bitch like Cam at the brake light
Cause there ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, he scared to look, he shook
Catch a nigga on the late night
Why a nigga slipping like Harold at the brake light
