[Verse 1: $LICK $LOTH]
Pale faces that surround me, eyes looking like round three
Cup looking like nosebleed, only sippin' hydro-codeine
Da$h riding, Ruby sitting shotty
They said, "you see 'em?"—I said, "I got 'em"
Bottom lurkers, snakes out the lake
Ball and chain, ain't no escape
Fuck the fame, I just want the change
Fuck a name, I just want a grave
Spit in your face, Grey be the apes
You sippin' grape? I don't want a taste
Cooking dance when I cook the base
Hit the lace, now I'm feelin' spaced
You see the tape where the bodies lay?
Say you real, but I see the fake
Fuck out of my face, yeah, so?
Am I in love with drugs? Yeah, hoe
All my plugs got a mug on the record
Warzone in the slums like a desert

[Verse 2: ODDY NUFF DA $NOW LEOPARD]
Uh, $uicideboy$ still alive, "why haven't they died?"
17 More Minutes 'till I'm bled dry, gotta get my head right
Tighten up the noose, now my neck tied
No more breath hidin' in my lungs, I'm feeling calmer
I'm the shepherd with a flock of sheep, claimin' they want the slaughter
Fathers sacrificin' they daughters so their sons don't have to be offered up
I often off 'em anyway, 'cause I'm the soul marauder
I toss 'em off and sail away to the devil to barter
Take 'em underwater, take 'em to the altar of Hell
And let them wander while the devil separates the martyrs
Whoever's left will be turned into walkers and crawlers
Wait until the sky is darker, and now they're ready for departure
Ruby da fire-starter, Ruby da one who lets 'em all burn
Screaming, "Ruby, fuck my bitch!"—I tell 'em all to wait their turn
Snap my fingers, now they're feelin' how the flames burn
Then I extinguish 'em, and assume that it's a lesson learned

[Verse 3: Da$H]
Yeah so, yeah so
It's a dead man walking, ain't too big on talking
Chalk laying in the places I be stalking
Coughing off the nicotine, living dreams, and coughing
You ever vision me, bitch get the hearse
Doing dirt, check my fingernails
Living swell, throwing hunnids in a wishing well
Vicious sales from all the shit that's being shipped in mail
This some shit I didn't think that I would live and tell
Hell couldn't hold me, the one and only
D-O-double-L-A, ain't into fair play
Do crimes, stack cheddar
Whole grain, nothing better
Shoot first, ask never
No bet, I'm suicidal, homicidal
Grab the rifle
Prolly die of overdose, I'm fucking bitches on the Eiffel
The only time that I'm ever arrogant is outta spite
And we getting high in the area that's black and white
'Cause if you ain't know
