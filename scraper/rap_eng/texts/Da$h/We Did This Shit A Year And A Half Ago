Advanced drug use
The drugs is buffering

[Verse 1: RetcH]
I'm drenched in Bacardi, stepped in the party
Grass stains on her knees and my jeans are wylin'
Everybody looked in awkward silence
I screamed "Hi, I'm David Hasselhoff"
Hit the cabbage patch and then I laugh it off
Spark the wooly then I pass it off
To the chick with big tits and a ass of course
I mean a ass of course, I'm slightly off
Bought the car then crashed of course
Empty cans they dangle from the gas exhaust
Exchange the vowels in Vegas cause she was Asian
Told her I paint painting's
With a anus, pussy sweeter than apple danish
I only eat it from the back so I can lick her butt
And say I didn't mean it, when really I'm just a nasty fuck
That's how I give it up, me and two fat jawns
Posted at the KFC, looking for something to snack on
Forgot the biscuit, so I'm bugging out
Fatty tripping, tired of her fucking mouth
Grab her tongue and cut it out

[Interlude: Da$H]
Just cut it out bitch (fucking tramp)
D-A-DOLLA, nigga (fuck your whole existence)
As if you ain't fucking know
Where the Newports? (nicotine for the dream)
Tell your bitch go get the Newports
Send your mom to the store for the magnums
I ain't fucking around
Fuck all you niggas (Fuck us)
Nah (Fuck you)

[Verse 2: Da$H]
All of the power got me drunk
2.5 of all them sour getting puffed
White slut, ate the powder in her butt
Devour chowder at the lunch
At the brunch, rum punch, leave slumped
Flow holier than the fiend's chucks
Get it popping like a teen's bumps
Insecure, big fish was caught with a lure
Pinky to the gums, make sure it's pure, plant the C4
Blow the fucking door off the hinges
Put the Clorox in the syringes
Punch to the neck of all the Henchmen
She got the [?] on her Winston
Eyes glistening, bitch is high as fuck
Young MacGyver, skydive in a designer truck
No shoot though, eating bruschudo with the jew hoe
Weighed in the weed, it equaled out to a sumo
Fed the beef to my dog Cujo
From Atlanta, love the hammer dance
Money long like Montana pants
Perform a tantrum with a dancer in a ambulance
Screaming save me, I'm only in it to get paid baby

[Verse 3: RetcH]
I'm only in it for the paper, toss the scrapers
Exhaling vapors, screaming "fuck the neighbors"
Flex in a Challenger, hammer to your melon like Gallagher
My caliber is a massacre, give you agida
Jump out the blimp, quadruple flip onto the ship
I'm such a pimp, powder dish with a side of shrimp
The bitch a dime, her man he do construction
In the midst of the function she gave me suction
It's nothing, this feather ascot got me stunting
Bang the puss like percussion, sweet muffin, fuck it

[Verse 4: Da$H]
The bitch from Venice with the tuckus
Punch the king up out his Penit, he tried to stunt it
Shoulda tucked it, had to call his bluff quick
Made the nigga put the cards down
Tombstone him through the hard ground
Now he stuck, what the fuck
Wife tripping, throw her into submission
Treat her like a exhibition
Chase the mil' while you penny pinching
Telling Benson grab the Smith'n, bitch
