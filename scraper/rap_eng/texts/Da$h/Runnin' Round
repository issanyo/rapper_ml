[Intro]
Stevie World, Stevie Gang
You already fucking know, Global

[Verse]
Big strapped like I'm Elmer Fudd
All my niggas off of hella drugs
Drinking hella mud, smoking hella bud
And we in the hood, we don't fuck with clubs
Global gang, we the new nothing
First niggas to ever do something
We don't do fronting, all we do is stunting
Got a slug on like I blew something
Smoking my loud through my magazine
Half of my bitches in magazines
I get a flip and then I stash the cream
See this fucking life is such a savage thing
Dare a nigga go and say something
Gang members are my day ones
Blackout Boyz, no we never die
But we going hard 'til that day come
RIP King Yambo
Shirt off like I'm Rambo
Going off in this rap shit
Til I'm nodding off in that Lambo
Fast life really is for me
My new bitch got a bitch for me
I'm Globetrottin, just left touring
Cause this getting money don't get boring
My nigga with me got a dirty gun
My other mans got a half a pint
My other nigga got a quarter pound
And the bitch I'm with getting wrecked tonight
You looking at the deluxe picture
Main motto be, "fuck niggas"
Got the drugs I can fucks with you
If I don't know you don't fucks with you, like

[Hook]
