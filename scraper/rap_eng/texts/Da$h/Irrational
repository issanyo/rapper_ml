[Intro: (Slug Christ) & DA$H]
(SLUGGA, YAH)
Off the shit, got me in the head, higher than you
(You're acting irrational)
It's always been some, acting irrational
You acting irrational, I'm acting irrational
Yeah so, yeah so, yeah so

[Verse 1: Slug Christ]
Were stopping your acting irrational
Watching and studying how I move
You imitate God cause it's beautiful
She calling me God, and it's usual

[Verse 2: DA$H]
Ayy, Ayy Slugga, I'm acting irrational
I had to pop me a cap or two
I had just robbed it for capitols
Hollow tips, look like a rabbit's shoes

[Verse 3: Slug Christ]
Me and DA$H did a whole sack or two
I step up the swag and it's radical
But Slugga like [?] bashing you
They climb out the door like a animal

[Verse 4: DA$H]
Don't talk if you ain't got cash with you
Tell a bitch change how you acting boo
No, I won't get on no tracks with you
All these self proclaimed trappers is ratting too

[Verse 5: Slug Christ]
Don't you think it's funny how I started getting money and they claim I'm irrational
The shit these people start assuming man, it's got me acting irrational
Slugga, I act a fool, off a pint, it's not unusual
Swag in the national, this swag is irrational

[Hook: Slug Christ]
No, no, feeling irrational, shit
I'm feeling irrational, shit
With all the shit I won
I got it out the mud, and boy it's a [?]
Kicking, went splits and it's casual
I laid that bitch up for the fucking kill
Boy, I'm acting irrational
DA$H, I'm acting irrational

[Verse 6: DA$H]
Looking like a pirate, nigga I'm a captain
Pack, sit back, [?] brought the racks in
[?], cause I'm with the action
Niggas banged on me but I keep it clapping
See that's the difference between me and you
Between him and I, no soda, we're sipping
Just give me a eight, pour it over ice
They know I got vices still, the type that'll get you killed
Don't call me for prices, in crisis we're popping pills
They know what I'm writing real, fuck on your bitch out of spite
I'm the nicest, no argument
If I'm ever in beef then I started it
Motherfuckers know they want no part of it
Turn your motherfucking life to a horror flick
Yeah so, bitch

[Verse 7: Slugga Christ]
Goddamn, bitch I make it look easy
Pull up to the club, so queazy
Awful Records, [?], yeah I'm easy
Fucked your bitch, fucked your bitch, Chris Breezy
Yah, yah, I'm on a few, I can't lie to you
I feel like a God, call me Xenu
I'm emo not emu and all this illegal
Give dick to a diva and Tevas
I feel like shit and I mean it
I don't want your bitch, you can keep it
We done hit that lick, so we leaving
Out the back door, God fleeing
Ya night come, we creeping
Off the front porch, so we can eat and
We eating
Can you excuse me, I'm feeling so

[Hook: Slug Christ]
I feel so irrational, I'm feeling irrational
With all the shit I won
I got it out the mud, and boy it's a [?]
Kicking, went splits and it's casual
I laid that bitch up for the fucking kill
Boy, I'm acting irrational
DA$H, I'm acting irrational
