Long Live Yambo

[Hook: Da$H]
Time goes by, puffing on la
Hoping that it get me by
Got a nigga going brazy
It got a nigga going brazy
Said, time goes by, so pour another line
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going brazy
It got a nigga going brazy

[Verse 1: Da$H]
So now, so now
So now I'm riding round
On your side of town
Just got a four of Dot
Pour me up
Pulled up on my round
He had 2 Oâ€™s of snop
We split that shit
And we sip that shit
So now I'm moving slow
I hit my whore up
Said she need that [?]
I'm runnin' round
Got that gun around
That's just in case for 'plexing
Safety sex
Have her giving head until she break her neck
I been that nigga, nah
I been that nigga since the fucking gat
Well respected, nah
I'm well connected
Getting fucking cheques
Spiking the soda
Ride like a soldier
Feel like I'm rolling
Shooting down Collins
Just me and Porter
Do what we oughta
Pouring some more up
Rolling the dope up
[?]
When I'm in Rome
I do what I wanna, yeah
I'm with the same gang since grade school
Like we say shit
We break rules
Doing all the things that you can't do
Fucking bad hoes
Eating great food
Address me as Big Skrewface
Five Backwoods
Rolling two eighths
Backseat boyz
Bumping skrew tapes
Act like you fucking know, nigga

[Hook: Da$H]
Time goes by, puffing on la
Hoping that it get me by
Got a nigga going brazy
It got a nigga going brazy
Time goes by, so pour another line
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going brazy
It got a nigga going brazy

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Xan and lean, going crazy
Eyes hazy, smoking on daisies
Backwoods, I'm smoking Slim Shady's
Sip lazy, thick like gravy
Like the zip, I used the .380
Split the O three ways like Mercedes
Got a [?]
Caucasian bitch named Katie
Suck dick and eat all the babies
Her friend Stacey just wanna face me
Head wavy, say my dick tasty
I can never let the bitch fade me
Dark hoes, I heard they got rabies
I can never let a nigga play me
Above clouds, their word is so shady
Get high off lows on the daily
I'm on some other shit, lighting up another spliff
Wishing that Lil Woodrow and Lil Betho come and hit this shit
Lost another homie now I'm standing 'bout to jump the cliff
30 rounds inside my clip, contemplating psycho shit
Handle bars, I'm cycling
Hella broads, I'm piping them
Pass them off like swisher sweets
We popping them like Vicodins
Few drugs to ease the pain
My sober brain is insane
Out the mud, I got it out the grain
Trill nigga, tryna maintain

[Hook: Da$H]
Time goes by, puffing on la
Hoping that it get me by
Got a nigga going brazy
It got a nigga going brazy
Time goes by, so pour another line
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going brazy
It got a nigga going brazy
