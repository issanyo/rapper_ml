(Moving so slowly)

[Verse]
When I'm dead and gone
I bet you I'm the realist nigga in that cemetery
Rather rap off a obituary, get you buried
Smoke the blunts that's of preliminary, weed is hairy
Fucking on a bitch you marry, look like Jimmy Carey
Masked up for that fast buck, guess who
The human cesspool, skydive in a wetsuit
Dance with my demons with two left shoes
The vehicle resemble pet food (faggot, pussy)
I'm Jesse James in some J's and a 'Lo bucket
The flow I mustered keep hoes running
Mac 1-0 busting, sound like war drumming
Foes ducking, mugging, say I'm bugging
Controlled substance, roll with the punches
I'm lunching in Beelzebub's bathtub
Mad drugs, sold the Adderall to the math club
Get dough, sold the Ecstasy to the freak hoes
Then I hit the park and lost it all in a cee-lo
I said fuck it, stuck the game up after
About my collections like a pastor, my mental is NASA
Eighth letter global nigga, ain't nothing after
You say this is your page, faggot I'm burning the chapter

[Hook]
You know my eyes wide shut for whatever going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out, feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up and whoever in that motherfucker
Word to mother, there won't be another, nah
Word to mother, there won't be another
Ready to wet the party up and whoever in that motherfucker
Word to mother, there won't be another, nah
Word to mother, there won't be another
