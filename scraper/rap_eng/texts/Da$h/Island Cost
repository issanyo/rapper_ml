Speak threats, live life just to cheat death
I love expensive drugs and cheap sex
Deep breathes and shallow thoughts, am I found or lost
Anti-social, tryna figure what an island cost
Sauce, vodka, steak, lobster, light beams on that court
Tryna keep my state proper and nigga
See the get down, you know the rest
Niggas lurking, tryna murk you at your home address
That's for certain, keep the weed lit cause you the stress linger And success is only bringing you more, shit
Felt more at peace when I was sleeping on floors
Mistreating a whore, you had the keys to the door, honestly

Deep breathes and shallow thoughts, am I found or lost
Anti-social, tryna figure what an island cost
