[Intro]
When I was in the fifth grade
I had three white bitches
Bringing me candy by the bags right
You know what I'm saying
Then all of a sudden years later
Here I am again right
Getting Money out a bitch ass
But this time it wasn't no candy this time
It was some major money

I was born like this man
I been breaking girlfriends since like 15, 16 years old
You know a nigga ain't gonna wake up one morning
And say I'm a go pimp
Nah it dont work like that
Pimping starts off from way back

[Verse 1: Da$H]
My motivation come from intoxication along with paper chasing
Mama receive this picture I'm painting, please, jeez
Ain't seen sober in like a year and change
So my mother think I'm going insane, my father say the same
Ain't in position to tell 'em different
It's hard to agree when I blow my weed up out a sixth story window pane
In the business district, young nigga getting it
And I'm in love with it, I can't lie
See my eyes, they red fried
Smoke 'em out 'til they seem dead
Her woman cooking me cheese eggs
Her other friend got them mean legs and I'm tryna fuck
What you thought we was just kicking it, couple blunts and that liquor
My music playing, saying that she digging it, turned into me dicking it
Fucking of course, does it for sport
I die young and leave a good looking corpse
My type of thoughts, shit
Embroid my skin in case the plan don't work
Wear my memories on my arm just like a god damn shirt

Word, word, word, word
Word, word, word, word
Word, word, word, word
Word, word, word

[Verse 2: Retch]
Last night I had smoked until my lungs hurt
Woke up with a white bitch from a concert
This shit is cool but I got to get these one's first
In Polo denim that be tailored like some converse
My kicks by Jordan, jeans by Lauren, skully 'Lo too
You always wondering 'bout this lifesyle, I could show you
I'm in a taxi uptown, I got the window cracked
Said I could smoke, I sparked the blunt and took a hit of that
Gold digital watches with gold squares in my pockets
Cause a nigga can't afford to leave gold diggers with profit
Sucka nigga, I'm not it, I be styling on these freak hoes
Met her and fucked her man that story about a week old
She woke up and cooked scrambled eggs on wheat toast
I banged her sister and she kept it on the lee low
Kinda embarrassed, tried to blame it on the tree smoke
She said she tried it, but she never smoke what we smoke
Bitch, cause this a blunt full of dust baby
She looked at me like I'm fucking crazy
Laughed a bit, I'm just fucking with ya
Now roll over, let a nigga put something in ya
She abided my dick, she rided
Booty it be clapping all melodic
Making beats in the sheets
But you don't hear me though
To her ass is where her hair be though
Sipping light but we heavy though
