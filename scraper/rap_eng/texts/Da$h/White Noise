While I'm riding in a vehicle, off a lil weed and brew
Yeah, got your bitches peeking through
This five percent tint for a young pimp
Love shrimp like this young bitch love dick
And it's money on my motherfucking mind
So if you say you got a lick then just gimme the place and time
And I'll take whatever mine, yeah and whatever yours
Got this towel by the door, Remy coming through my pores
While I'm waiting on a score, asylum raps
Deadly, in a spinal tap, spinal crack, acid trip flashback
Killing shit, gladbag, dead beat the pussy like a bad dad
Smash that, smash out, cash out
Niggas know what Da$H 'bout, don't act like you didn't
Heirs to the throne, motherfucker stay committed
High every day ignoring rules, more cool on you fool
Bust a moves, made ditching school cool
Randy Moss catch a fade, pay the cost, I'm the boss
W's never loss, her nipples hard she doing soft, dig it
Need a couple mil, sitting on my fucking ticket
Until then [?] or getting lifted, bitch

Cause if you ain't know
Hz nigga, Free Mav
