[Intro]
This that word
Yeah So, Yeah So

[Hook]
It's just me and my attorney, doing thirty, car converty
Fuck, fuck, I'm searching, fuck, fuck...
The drugs don't hurt me, no, no, no, no, no...
And now it's just me and my attorney, doing thirty, the car converty
Fuck, and fuck, I'm searching, fuck, fuck...
The drugs don't hurt me, no, no, no, no, no...

[Verse]
Inhaling ether through the handkerchief
Lay on the boulder, smoke the anchor spliff
It hold me down, just like gangster bitch
I'm in a six, the color stanky piss
The pen and the pad about to make me rich
I'm smelling like dope
Committed to pimping, my bitch is a pitcher, she pitching her throat
Are shit is much different, you talking, we living, we getting the most
Are feelings approach
I said, I'll smoke...(fuck all that x3)
Nah, fuck that, yo
Catharsis, doing numbers, Dustin Hoffman
And I split it with my family, like I'm Danny Partridge
I did all this, Ichabod Crane couldn't behead the horseman
The flawless foreign, skin color porridge
The activis I poured it, boss shit
Keep it same through my recordings, people shall applaud him
Went to Hell and came back cause it was boring
In the same Jag Travolta had in Swordfish
Seize the day, you niggas starving like Korean slaves
I steam the hay, the women bathe me in Montego Bay
My teachers said it wouldn't be this way
Nigga, teachers said it wouldn't be this way
Steam the hay, women bathe me in Montego Bay
Seize the day, teachers said it wouldn't be this way

Nigga, cause if you ain't know
Free Mav
