The name's Dolla and I'm majoring in disrespect
Grip the Tec, left his fucking whip with a mess
Architect, build bridges with the bricks I serve

Feeling like Jada on Ryder, I'm gripping grain
Double the cup, cause my nigga I'm drinking, pain

When I'm counting that money, I swear that I don't feel the same
Counting that money, I swear that I...
Glock 40, the pistol, a issue
