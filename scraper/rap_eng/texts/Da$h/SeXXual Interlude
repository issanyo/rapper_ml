Dillinger nigga
(Yeah)

[Verse]
1:50 something AM and I'm thinking: should I call your phone?
But you texting mine, saying "whats goin' on?"
Now thats what I call perfect timing
I just left the lab, got four grams up up in this bag
Tryna seep out to smoke and smash
Don't be defensive or rather submissive
And you used to do gymnastics, imagine positions
We can try out, see if she tryna ride out
I'm on your side of town with idle time, I'm tryna find out
I'ma follow through
I know you probably heard some stories, they ain't all true
So disregard 'em
You answer the door no draws, breath smelling like alcohol
Feel like I'm ditching class the way I'm in between your walls Yes
If that was made we made a mess of it
Had the bitch screaming, think the pussy in distress and shit
All I'm hearing is my first name
And oh my god you think I blessed the chick
I killed it and left the scene, I guess (this sex is a weapon shit)
I guess this sex is a weapon shit
Yeah so...

[Outro]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundays is getting touched
Scooped in my ice cream truck, lets hit it up
