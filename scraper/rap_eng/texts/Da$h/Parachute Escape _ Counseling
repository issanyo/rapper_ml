[Intro]
Tell your mother I love her, nigga

[Verse 1]
As the captain survive the battle
Jacket made from Norwegian cattle
Pills in my pocket sound like a baby rattle
Stomp into the cockpit of the stealth bomber, fuck karma
Resemble Che Guevara in my recent pictures
Piss expensive liquors
Sexin' on eccentric bitches, it was in the scriptures
Of the good book, Salmon filleted by the good cook
King of my castle through a shook crook
Or a pawn piece, silk on the Don's sheets
Hooked on the pharmies, my head stashed where the bong be
Da$H the field, you catch me where the Gods be
Mt. Olympus, Hera as my mistress
Eating shrimp up off a discus, bitch I really live this
Check the quota, smoking SOMA out in Wigoma
I'm on the Motorola, discussing cash of course
A left jab from Zab had paid the mansion off
Motherfucker it's him

[Hook]
And I ain't prayed in motherfucking months
So a nigga wonder where I'm going when I die
And lately I been talking to these blunts
Cause they the only ones that never ever told a lie
I'm either flying or I'm frying
I'm either flying or I'm frying nigga
I'm either flying or I'm frying
I'm either flying or I'm frying nigga

[Verse 2]
Yo, my self esteems on amphetamines, I'm a walking benzo
Got a bitch named Mckenzie but I just call her Kenzo
Stole her father Enzo, smoking in it with the tints low
Now I'm schizo off the blunt
Did it for the stunt, nah, did it for the bread
You in it for the love, bitch I'm in it for the head
Get it right, give a nigga wife rice out of spite
Made the game, you're playing Fischer Price
Throw the dice, hit the trips, bitches licking dick
Kiss the 'wood, grip the Remy fifth, now I'm feeling tips
Get it jumping, some pussy niggas think they pumping
My homie showing up with something sure to end the function
Ain't sane, whole squad got the set banged
And most of these rappers need a sex change
Chief hash, eyes lower than my jeans sag
It's "Free Mav" 'til they free Mav

[Hook]
And I ain't prayed in motherfucking months
So a nigga wonder where I'm going when I die
And lately I been talking to these blunts
Cause they the only ones that never ever told a lie
I'm either flying or I'm frying
I'm either flying or I'm frying nigga
I'm either flying or I'm frying
I'm either flying or I'm frying nigga

{​Counseling}​

[Verse 1]
Young and high as if Medusa cut her eyes at me
Cry when I'm happy, laugh when I'm sad
Sayin' she only going to college cause she trying to make her mom happy
Strung out so she don't fuck with her dad
And she'll do whatever it takes just so I could see the bigger picture
Realest nigga, roll the dope before a nigga dick her
Said she was a sniffer, but only on occasions
And I couldn't say I minded all these drugs that I be taking
Conversations, situation got her ridin' like she brakeless

But maybe she wanted out, I never asked the bitch
But that actavis and hash and cabbage spliff will have you on some bastard shit
Muscle relaxers injested after I crashed the whip
She started screamin' so loud that a nigga had to smack her, shit
Now I'm a lone ranger
Saddle crafted after mastiff skin, so you can see I'm on my bullshit
Like a preacher from the pulpit
Or a skeezer with a full lip schemin' on a full grip
"Fuck 'em", ain't much more that a nigga could tell her
Heads spinnin' like propellors, vision impaired, Helen Keller
From this Crown that I'm drowning in

I found a pool full of liquor and I dived in it
Ride tinted, lime scented, dimes in it
All these rap lines is just the life that I'm livin'
