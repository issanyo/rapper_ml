[Verse 1]
Still high off them pain pills you got from the dentist
My crib smell like pot and some incense
Plot on a yacht, cash crops and a drop color spinach
You said the money's there I woulda been left
Hang the phone up, light the dope up
Tell the hoe to clean her coke up
And she wait to get her throat fucked
Them bad habits, whole faculty some trife bastards
We doing anything to live lavish
I came a long way from burning dimes of weed in a fiend house
Tell my bitch to count my money 'fore she pull her weave out
Slang got into where you can't understand what we speak 'bout
Mix a half of green with the blue dream ounce
Flip it for double, I feel like Barney Rubble
Ten toes in the gravel, I'm finding trouble in any form
Hustles the fucking norm, riding a fucking storm
Feeling like Morrison
The fucking Lizard King, I swear I could do anything

[Hook x2]
Said on the real
All these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, roll up that kill

[Verse 2]
I'm penning this rap from the backseat of my car service
Backwoods cigar burning, suck 'til her jaw hurting
Cash is the Gods purpose, they ask is it all worth it
The money say so, with color Jango play the block like legos
Moved up from Eggos, all the waffles Belgian
Spitting snot from all the pot I'm inhaling
I plot on a scale of the globe
Metal won't mold, you let it get cold
For the price your boss' soul'll get sold, nigga
Move like Capone through the park with all my henchman
I pass the cheque to my assistant
Snuff a nigga, tell him hold that
Grab the phone back, pardon the interruptions
Back to discussing bread I should be touching
Drug consumption on the daily, my women hate Israeli's
Skin color Baileys, driver ditch the fed tailing, never fail me
They say I'm fucking lucky, nah, just a druggy 'til they kill me or they cuff me, nigga

[Hook x2]
Said on the real
All these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, roll up that kill
