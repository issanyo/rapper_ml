[Intro]
A metal, a fucking metal
D-D-D-DJ Nick exclusive

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
Loud packs smellin' like mustard
Diamonds be shinin', they clustered
Baby, I don't need no huggin'
Baby, I don't do no cuddlin'
Damn, I did it myself
Played with the hands I was dealt
Praying to God everyday, uh
Stacking the chip, Frito-Lay

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
Rockin' around with that lava
Glocky was poppin', we mobbin'
Partly we trappin', we wylin'
Straight from the clubbin, no coppers
Flacko just bought a new chopper
I matched my pants with my lambo
Car keys got bullets in pockets
I sound like couple revolvers
Plug gettin' hit with them charges
Fuck it, I'm good like regardless
Posted, I'm building up Harlem
[?] stories

[Chorus: K$upreme]
K-preme
Bring my team together on my huddle shit
My niggas water on that puddle shit
Pack came in, nigga, I'm on that jungle shit
Gwap came in, nigga, I'm on that double shit
Flex on these niggas, on my big muscle shit

[Verse 4: A$AP Twelvyy]
Ay, thinkin' 'bout changin' my government
Pulled up with rifles and we hunt again
Changing my name to a gun again
Forty got Twelvyy in love again
Cutthroat, I get you through publishing
Spend it on curfew and rub it in
Wylin' out just like Republicans
Ain't bringin' no duffles, they told you don't fuck with him

[Chorus: K$upreme]
Bring my team together on my huddle shit
My niggas water on that puddle shit
Pack came in, nigga, I'm on that jungle shit
Gwap came in, nigga, I'm on that double shit
Flex on these niggas, on my big muscle shit

[Verse 5: Da$h]
Top, top, top
H is the click that I'm mobbin'
Ain't even know niggas was stylin'
They know that niggas was robbin', huh
Punching niggas out at shows, fuckin' niggas' hoes
We been on that shit, yeah
Nigga, I been had a grip, uh
Thirty, my neck look like Steph Curry
Fuck with me, you getting burned
Gold in my mouth like C-Murder
Yeah, I'm that nigga, you heard it
Yeah, make a dollar, make bitches hollar
Go off a squalor, we gon' go off and profit
Motherfuckas, stop me

[Chorus: K$upreme]
Bring my team together on my huddle shit
My niggas water on that puddle shit
Pack came in, nigga, I'm on that jungle shit
Gwap came in, nigga, I'm on that double shit
Flex on these niggas, on my big muscle shit
K-preme
Bring my team together on my huddle shit
My niggas water on that puddle shit
Pack came in, nigga, I'm on that jungle shit
Gwap came in, nigga, I'm on that double shit
Flex on these niggas, on my big muscle shit
