[Verse]
It's a dead man walkin'
Ain't too big on talkin'
Chalk leadin' in the places I be stalkin'
Coughin' off the nicotine, livin' dreams and coughin'
You ever vision me
Bitch, get the hearse
Doin' dirt, check my fingernails
Livin' swell, throwin' hunnids in a wishin' well
Makin' sales from all the shit that being shipped in mail
This some shit I didn't think that I would live and tell
Hell couldn't hold me, the one and only
D-O-double-L-A, ain't into fair play
Do crimes, stack cheddar
Whole rank, nothin' better
Shoot first, ask never
No bet, I'm suicidal, homicidal
Grab the rifle
Prolly die of overdose, I'm fuckin' bitches on the Eiffel
The only time that I'm ever arrogant is outta spite
And we gettin' high in the area that's grey and white
