[Verse 1: Da$H]
I ain't really write no raps since of recently
Been locked up in my fucking head like felons in the precinct
Better than half of these niggas favorites, fuck is decent bitch
The only time we speaking when I'm tryna get the neck
H'z in this motherfucker show respect
Still can't figure why I'm right handed, I'm always going left
And the only time I wanna see your face is when you catch a breath
Young and ruthless, since a toddler been a nuisance
And my sneakers they're the newest, no I'm lying they're the oldest
I don't wear retros Space Jam soles the coldest, hold up
I need to know the name of weed in this blunt
You fucking scrub at doing drugs, a fucking dub ain't enough
So I'm smoking on this blocka, listening to Flocka
[?] the game, somebody call a doctor
Every nigga out here swear that he toting a chopper
Man I'm smacking these lil niggas just like I was they mama
And you swear you puffing schama
Well that's reggie in that dutch, I get my sour on the cuff
Fast money made men, I ain't never roll with chumps
These niggas partying at [?], I'm at Sway drunk as fuck
You stuck in a sweatbox, I'm with white bitches doing bumps
Inhale on that Charlie Sheen
[?], HD
Why your arm is green, you know I'm 'bout them bills be
I'm living for the thrill, throw the set-up if you feel me

[Verse 2: RetcH]
H'z bitch, ain't nothing after
Watching Family Guy [?], still a nigga laughing
Yes, I'm high, I'm high, I'm NASA
Screaming "free Cash" like it's faster
Cause I only got my brothers in this world, I'm such a bastard
Such a misfit, getting shoes, but I'm knowing [?]
I spend most of my time trying different weed and bitches
Got served the other day, you bitches trash, you smoking haze
We ain't in the same lane, not even on the same page
You's a bum, you's a dweeb, you's a nerd, you's a geek
In a pair of seven J's, seven days you niggas weak
Like the weed in that poorly rolled dutchmaster blunt
You in the crib cuddling, I'm in the telly smashing sluts
With a cup full of Henny and this bitch twisting up
Like the blunt in my hand, I completely forgot to puff
Light it up, I'm soaring, Polo Ralph Lauren
Every single day, bitch it never gets boring
Blunt in my hand, getting stupid on the Westside
Nah, I ain't riding in the best ride
No, the shit a hoopty, [?] my shit gucci
Who he? nutty from uptown, full of loopy
'Bout to take a slut in the cut, she was thinking movies
Now she here giving me noggin, I'm rolling doobies
Spitting shit you couldn't even fabricate
Bitch you think I'm killing now, just wait until I graduate
