[Verse 1: Da$H]
(Sparking and exhaust tear, yeah so)
Fuck you and everything you fucking represent
(You know the rest nigga)
You piece of shit
I mean it
Swim in Fallopian's of Ethiopian women
The wheels are spinning, moon is glistening, view exquisite
Now viewing witness, a youth that's twisted
Off purple liquid made to cure the sickness
Feel like my vision took a pitch shift
Smoking that Samson got me lifted
I'm the one who gave your girl cousin them drugs
Your little brother's plug, spit inside your mother's mug
Take her finest bottle, pour the liquor out for all my one's above
The last shot is for the homie's locked
Lit the crop, hit the lot
Double spin into the Guinness drop, pull off in fourth gear
Put it in park, the whores, they see me, say the Lord's here
My voice is hoarse from them 'Ports dear
Over here we don't support fear
Road to the riches and the course clear
I'm riding 'til the tires sparking and exhaust tear, it's on, yeah
Yeah so, nigga

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
We couldn't come up with a hook so we gon' just use this
I don't like ad-libs
Amen
Actavis in cactus cooler
I bit the Apple on the Mac computer, you a loser
There ain't a subject I can't tackle, either now or sooner
Ain't got no shoulder pads, but collateral pass to her
Running back, running rap, I bet you wish she knew ya'
Black Lip Pastor, hallelujah (Soulo, Soulo)
Soulo in this ho, that mean this church up in this bitch
Gave her a sermon then I hit, God
I'm an entity into titties, a fat ass, some clean pussy, and some good weed
Knowledge and wisdom in abundance, infinite energy
And I'll be sure to write night and day, literally
Deadline snapback, Backwoods in my backpack
Xan with that lean nigga, shit you never seen nigga
Put that on my team nigga, 3 i's, you see me bruh
Careful, you know the game's T-D-E, us
Amen

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
I heard they out there praying for the death of me
I been down to knock, it's my destiny
I been 'round the block, it's no testing me
We been ran the north, it's no extra key
So whatchu' got on lock my nigga?
I tried to tell him, they ain't gon' get it
I been prolific, been on this shit
You can check mo millie, that was like 08's
You niggas ain't no factors, just come around cause we ain't no actors
It's no scenes cut, just checks
Don't want 25, but I'll take my time
If a nigga come around, tryna take what's mine
Tryna take my life? good luck with that
We got guns for that, you not coming back
I got Fade in the bushes, lurking & looking
Bout' that life, don't get your's took quick
Just a story of some kids left stranded
Couple of the homies and a couple automatics
Come to the hood, get a good pack out
Tombstone read RIP, with your hood whacked out
You know what he about, at Ramona Park 'til after dark
They drain they pool, we swam with sharks
We shooting fools off 7th street
You make the bed in which you sleep
I stay awake like visiting dead
With the hammer sitting indiscreet, in the streets

[Verse 4: RetcH]
(So sinister, so sinister, so sinister, the lone visitor)
Lo God nigga, coming through your motherfucking speakers, bitch ass nigga
Sold drugs in your granny building, in front the children
A piece of shit, I'll be considered the most
Baby hen on the dinner plate, I start the meal with a toast
Three assorted cheeses, they garnish the loaf
Cut the slices even
Distribute them to my assemblage of these fucking heathens
A bunch of demons in these Polo fleeces
I clutch the reefers and evade polices
I burn the Priest and vanish in the breezes
I talk to Jesus, reconsidered features
Rain dance on black sanded beaches
Pick from the tree that bare the fruit of peaches
Slaying these skeezers and then feel the Eden
These backwoods got me with the heavy breathing
Connecting Venus and the shit the cheapest
I hit the party with the Sherm perm, ear-rings look like strobe lights
I cop the goldfish platforms for the cold price
Hop out the V in all sequence, bitch is Swedish
Suede Fedora, yeah my shit the meanest, you need it
And I'm the founder of the shit
On the forty-sixth floor, eating flounder with the shrimp
Got a awfully thick splore and I just pound her with the dick
Get the dope from out abroad, destroy the county with the shit
Piece of shit records, where dreams come true
You saying fuck me? nah, fuck you
And fuck your moms and 'em
Go fuck your Aunts daughter
You piece of shit, you're disgusting, I hate you
