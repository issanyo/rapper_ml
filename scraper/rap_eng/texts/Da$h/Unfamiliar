[Intro]
As if you ain't know
As if you ain't know
Yeah, So

[Verse]
The night was immature
Plotting on trips to Singapore
Needa bitch like Margot Robbie
Screaming "Fuck the police!"
Walking grim, love interest act like Harley Quinn
Super villain, young Joker with the heartless grin
Ever since an early age we been involved with sin
Whatever it takes, just as long we win
I tell that bitch, hit the strip, run laps, get the cash for me
Riding harder than a fucking crash dumby, ask for me
And ain't no driving by, my clique is walking up
They hear our name, the coroner's going to get that chalky up
That pop pop, brap brap
Fly the work in, check the number like I'm NASDAQ
Ship the work out, fiends test it like a lab rat
Feeling like a scientist, Bill Nye
Yeah I'm quite high, nigga live wire
Just starting to find myself
And niggas really think they know me
You ain't my friend, no we ain't fucking homies
Yeah, So
If it ain't about no bread, don't even fucking call
I need it all, whether Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall
And yet we take the cake to bake so it's fuck it we ball
Yeah, So
So it's fuck it we ball

[Hook]
All this shit I know been unfamiliar
Stuck to the floor
Ain't even thinking 'bout the ceiling bruh
And they know if Dolla feeling up
Like that bitch, she got a pill in her
And all this shit I know been unfamiliar
Stuck to the floor
Ain't even thinking 'bout the ceiling bruh
And they know if Dolla feeling up
Like that bitch, she got a pill in her

[Verse]
Top gun like Ethan Hunt
Getting sucked in my deepest thoughts
Steam a 'Port and make a exit, Lethal Weapon
And my attire won't leave no room for the second guessing
Something foreign texting once I had the french connection
That was another day, grab my Jack, make another play
That was on Mother's Day, never could you fuck with me
Best in my bracket, champion without the ring
Heard your man, got snagged up by them peoples in the city
Ain't no room for no rats in the trap, it's only cheese
Surrounded by only [?] it's a fact, they know it's me
Bi-polar, schizophrenic, make it faster than I spend it
If I said it then I meant it, and I'm bent like I was dented
Yeah, So

[Hook]
All this shit I know been unfamiliar
Stuck to the floor
Ain't even thinking 'bout the ceiling bruh
And they know if Dolla feeling up
Like that bitch, she got a pill in her
And all this shit I know been unfamiliar
Stuck to the floor
Ain't even thinking 'bout the ceiling bruh
And they know if Dolla feeling up
Like that bitch, she got a pill in her
