[Intro]
Open the door nigga, I'm out here nigga
Open the fucking door nigga, I'm fucking out here nigga
Open the door

[Hook]
Young Billy Badass
High and I'm drunk and addicted to fast cash
You niggas is mad ass
Fucking with us, you'll come wearing a Glad bag
Young Billy Badass
High and I'm drunk and addicted to fast cash
You niggas is mad ass
Fucking with us, you'll come wearing a Glad bag

[Verse]
Could view all of the world from just my patio
Drugs the color of Rosario Dawson
Polo Sport fit at the auction
Outbid me, you in the creek like Dawson
Eating crawfish with Cyndi Lauper
Shit every state I go I got a loft in
Bossing in large proportion, the game extorted
Won't stop until the family got a fleet of Porsches
Regardless, I'm lawless, my bitch is gorgeous
Reporters, catch a glimpse of gangster
Become a banker when I throw the shakers
Whip aerodynamic just like a windbreaker
Getting this paper right, grinding all day and night
Skimming that saved my life
Now all this rapping shit got us so bracking
And I'm getting high with two Asian dykes
Laying the pipe and escape
Captain save 'em ass niggas, strangle you with your cape
I stay draped up and dripped out
8th Of Acty got me sipped out
Burning Backwoods in your bitch house
Draped up and dripped out
You niggas talking with the shits now
You already know what the clique 'bout
