[Hook: RetcH x2]
All my niggas drinking, smoking, fucking bitches, getting money
Throw ya hands up in the air my dealers and they fucking druggies
All my niggas drinking, smoking, fucking bitches, getting money
Throw ya hands up in the air my trappers and their fucking custies

[Verse 1: RetcH]
Wake up in the morning take a hot one
Going hard nigga 'til the cops come
And these motherfucking bands and my polo down'd stance
In the car and I think I might box one
High as fuck with the windows up
Got dirty dirty in that sippy cup
Nigga fuck a sprite and fuck a 7-Up
Nigga mix that shit with some fruit punch
Purple punch got me sipped out
Knocked out on Freddie Gibbs couch
Smoking on a codeine blunt
Plenty purple kisses for your bitch mouth
Shouts out nigga Da$H, he be turnt up
Shouts out Shorty K, he be turnt up
Nigga know me, I be turnt up
Nigga and we finna take your bitch out
I'ma eat all that bitch food
Bring all my friends to that bitch house
I'ma ash where the fuck I want
Smoking hella weed on that bitch couch
Look her in the eyes like, 'bitch what's good?'
Acting like she ain't know niggas was hood
All up in the shit like I pays the bills
Ash on the couch so she know it's real

All my niggas drinking, smoking, fucking bitches, getting money
Throw ya hands up in the air my dealers and they fucking druggies
All my niggas drinking, smoking, fucking bitches, getting money
Throw ya hands up in the air my trappers and their fucking custies

[Verse 2: Da$H]
I'm Sosa, you niggas more like Casper Gomez and the Diaz brothers
Ride through your wifey crib, clog her toilet up with double rubbers
Dick head, live to really ditch feds, ginger bread be stacked
Bread, loaves of it see shit I'm fucking loaded
Roll the dope up bitch, you know I'm tryna smoke it
Shit I'm roasting got me floating and my third eye fully open
Yelling fuck illuminati, riding shotty up La Brea Ave
Aiming at a copper badge, dreams that I constantly have
Of raping the system, rather see me in prison than make it
Want it I take it, lobster tail and steak on my plate
Just the Don in me, crew teflon, they think of harming me
So many drugs up in my system I feel like a moving pharmacy
Say I got a problem, solve it, live it 'til I'm in my coffin
Lay some boomers out in Austin, never mind because I lost it
I'm fucking bossing, yeah, yeah, yeah so
Yeah so, yeah so, yeah so, yeah so, yeah so, yeah so
