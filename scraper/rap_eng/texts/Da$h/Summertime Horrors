[Verse 1:Lucki]

I could give you summertime horrors
You could stay around if you love me
Bitch don't count my blessings, so I'm Lucki
Bro we gon' be rich if this go right
Bitch I got that act in my system 'cause it's showtime
Percocet bandito back then when they ain't know rhymes
Deception in my blood, yup Imma pay you back in no time
You worry 'bout that whole line
You trippin' hoe, this yo' time
I can go at anybody, any order
I got ten zips in my duffy
I can't do the satchel, but the Supreme
I don't know who payin' for this Uber
If the hoe leave me she know game 'cause I schooled her
Steal propane in these washed up ksubis
Finesse game strong if the cops come prove it
Still with my slime, guess I love bein' stupid


[Verse 2:Da$h]

Y'all don't even say it, you'on mean that
And sit your bitches down, and I ain't seen head
In the mirror is the only time I see threats
Chase death, not 'nuff, try and chase checks
The pills she sniffin, grainy shit, I'm sippin' brown
I'm lying like it's Henny Kramer tied me down
Pop star get high with me, bet she die with me
That bitch won't ride for you, that bitch gon' lie to you
Who the fuck you think you talkin' to-a Skrewface
Duckin' out a warrant in like two states
Probably make a mill, get 'Lo, and cop a new face
Bitch I would be lying to you sayin' I only get high with you babe
But you knew that
