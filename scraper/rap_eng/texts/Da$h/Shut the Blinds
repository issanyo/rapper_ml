Red eyes, car tires, late nights
Pretty women, my main guys, late flights
Living through my days like this ain't life
Dreams I can't lose so you know I press snooze twice
Focused on survival
While I get my cake because the game a vicious cycle
Going for the title, respected by my idols
Living by the Bible now, so they calling me a psycho
See, that's why I say the world's iffy
Thoughts move through swiftly while I'm breaking down this fifty
And I'm screaming "free Mike, Ness, and Spiffy"
Til they let my niggas free or the lord come and get me
It's just the way I'm feeling
I see these clown niggas slipping
But my lil bro tell me they all banana peeling
On the top chilling
Waking up in a young actress' loft
All the windows from the floor to ceiling
Rolling weed as I rise from my sleep
Constant reminders why I find her a freak is what follows
And no matter, stripper, actress, or a model
Guarantee you by the end of that bottle they all swallow, fool
