Young nigga rolling cold, word to King James
Looking for me? pictures prolly on your bitch page
I wake up every day, schemes to get paid, get made
I been the fucking man since the fifth grade
Forever faded, young Jimmy Rothstein
In a dark Caeser speeding and my speakers loud as my reefer Chiefing, leaving a permanent smell off in the car
Nah, this ain't that bag weed, I get mine in a jar
And it taste so good that I don't usually do cigars
Just papers, but on this occasion I have no patience
Cause after we finish blazing baby my dick meeting your jaws
And I hope you give a performance worthy of an applause
Pause, or did you get it? shorty no hands
Name is D-A-DOLLA, never was a Ronny Romance
Living too fast, never learned how to slow dance
And my cousins told me money be the only time you hold hands
Damn
