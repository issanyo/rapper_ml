[Verse]
The weed looking like the lawn in the winter
Crew is full of karma and sinners, working for shit that the world gon' deliver
Just tryna get my bread straight, referred to as a head case
Takes the blunt lit to the face because the cess laced
I holds it down just like a lead weight
You niggas dead weight for what we tryna do with this here
I always hear 'em talking about this year
Or how they got they album out with this peer
But honestly that shit trash like dumpster filling
[?] for them blunts we're killing, and show 'em a thug appeal
I'm coming up in a time where being fake is accepted
So every time you say you trill, I swear, I'm often skeptic
See in the field stealing and dealing is the best investments
They say I'm tripping cause I'm burning whoolies, check the method
Fucking on ticallion stallions, everywhere I go they say I'm wylin'
Nigga if I'm bugging why the fuck they bite my style then
I'm just another nigga from Jersey is what they said when they heard me
Dropped that Caveman Files, the druggy just became worthy
La Cienega popped up and niggas act like they heard of me
Yeah, they heard of us, the barrel brothers, they still murder stuff
He, still on them drugs as much
Got his own but he drown his kids in another slut
It's just the fucking creed, wanting more than you need
That shit you writing ain't heightened, mainly cause y'all don't fucking read
See the knowledge is power, yo' dollars is ours
The truth is only bittersweet cause I'm burning the sour
Step up your crew get devoured, y'all niggas run with cowards
They only calling us Global because the world is ours
Nigga, yeah, because the world is ours
Said the knowledge is power, yo' dollars is ours
