[Hook 1: Da$H, Chyna]
Two cups, blunt lit, one strap, on my way to the bank, ayy
Next show I get, I'ma take that bread, cop a K, ayy
On your block, let it spray, mayday, don't do play, pay
Say less, talk tough, they stressed, new mess
Just copped a new Tec, sipping new Tech
Smell like a pound, I got the loud
Running around, hammers still out, bitch try me now
Still paying bills, so I sold pills
I got the instant I got the extended, I just got a fill
Smell like a pound, I got the loud
Running around, hammers still out, bitch try me now
Still paying bills, so I sold pills
I got the instant I got the extended, I just got a fill

[Verse 1: Chynna]
I just got a script for my nigga Leeks
We went through like three or four pharmacies
The craziest shit b, it ain't for me
I cut up the jug just so I could eat
But after that Act I ain't sip no lean
Tech and the Quali don't feel quite as clean
But trust it's around, I still got what you need
No less than a deuce than you copping from me
But this ain't no druggy shit
Life is as brazy as brazy could get
Flew out the country for legal money
That's the land of finessing and hitting licks
But after conversion my pockets lit
[?] I'm with the shit
They taped up the border cause I'm the shit
[?]
Trucking and tracing and tracking shit
This ain't the son, ain't no lacking bitch
Facing the blunt like the savage kid
If you play with a problem addiction hit, but ayy

[Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas Scene]
How long could we maintain, How long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? What will he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family. Would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats...

[Verse 2: Chynna]
If you say it's a problem you getting split
If I say it's a problem you better dip
Cause ain't no saving you after I'm stressing shit
Ain't no playing, no laughing, I'm pressing shit
I'm pressing lines like it's really an issue
Your squad ain't official, so how you the realest
You look at the team and see who really with it
Once you saw niggas, you hanging with bitches
Hoes, bitches, hoes and business
Don't beg forgiveness, you know the sin
Don't beg for shit than who really win
You don't do well, we see evidence
Only real ones with experience
Not with a million appearances
Gotta whole lot of plugs, lot of clearances
Notta whole lot of dumb interferences
I take any and everything serious
I make any and everything serious
Don't pray for miracles, make a plan
No reason for patience with work in hands
Don't fuck with [?] see it all
Ayy, might be the adderall
Or might be the ski-trips
And might be the last call

On your block, let it spray, mayday, don't do play, pay
Say less, talk tough, they stressed, new mess
Just copped a new Tec, sipping new Tech
All my niggas fuck with villains
All I do is go and [?]
[?] seeing Hell or we seeing Heaven
Anything is better, nigga fuck jail
Smell like a pound, I got the loud
Running around, hammers still out, bitch try me now
Still paying bills, so I sold pills
I got the instant I got the extended, I just got a fill
