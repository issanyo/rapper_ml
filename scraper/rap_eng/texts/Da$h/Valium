Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, So
H'z, nigga
Free Castro

[Verse]
I'm smoking 'til I can't see
I'm the nigga every bitch want, and who you can't be
Plus this weed I'm smoking on is tasting like some candy
The way that me and my niggas balling call me Marcus Camby
In the Knicks of '96, only quarters, halfs, no nicks hoe
'87 raps, I'm on my Freeway Rick flow
Never homegrown, see I'm smoking on that endo
And this model is a freak, believe I only fuck with nymphos
Or stripper out in Dallas, left my grind out in Nashville
Never was a flossy nigga, but they know my cash real
Really live this druggy life, only whole, never half pills
And they say I'm living too fast, 19, and the staff real
What I feels is worth it
I ain't tryna be known as the best rapper
But lyrically just the realest person
And I'ma make it happen
Word to this bong I'm snapping
I'm the nicest young nigga out and I'm reallyï»¿ 'bout that action
I'm screaming free him 'til they let my brother Cash out
Strippers in the shed, [?] out the bottle, what that 'bout
My life nigga, never lived it right, nigga
Gone, living  like I'm overdosing every night, nigga

Yeah and I'm faded, every fucking night has been lately
And I'm gone, can't see why I say I'm in my zone
You ain't heard, eyez shut
'90s baby, grimey, crazy
H'z nigga, I don't give a fuck
