Leave the crib
Lace my shoes everyday my nigga cause I ain't tripping on shit
& if you can't take a bad bitch
Turn her to a boss, best believe that your pimping ain't shit
& that's word to my clique
Don't send me no track, cause my nigga I ain't getting on shit
If it ain't for no chips
& if you got a problem motherfucker you can suck on this dick
Bitch nigga get your money right
Running 'round acting like a hoe
Tryna see what another nigga money like
Cause your money tight & my pockets getting heavy
Got a bad model bitch on the other side of the celly
Telling me she arranged the weed in a telly
Spark a cigarette after I'm in her belly
Make my escape, no laying up, I'm chasing this paper
War going on outside no man is safe from
But I finish everything thats on my plate
Like I'm working for a bakery, I'm always on a cake
& they telling me I'm speeding & they telling me to pace
& I tell 'em "I ain't been told what to do since I was eight" done
These niggas try & tell me what success mean
Life's a game & I'm captain of the chess team
Brett Favre for the pack is how I get green
Young rich nigga, living bitch niggas wet dreams
Steak & lobster, yeah I'm eating like a boss do
High off the chronic & I'm sauced too
Ain't talking a dollar then get lost fool
Think you got what it takes, my nigga it'll cost you
