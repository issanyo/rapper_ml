[Intro]
Yeah, So

[Verse 1]
Feel abandoned, life demanding
I lose a lot to gain a little
Getting paid for making riddles
Pull up, skrt, hang out the window
Banging 'til this shit is clicking
No regret then want forgiveness
Niggas pray, I think they Christians
Predator, on a mission, fuck around, end up missing
Tryna tip on fo-fo's, slim thug, busting packs in your post code
Loco, be the label that they gave me
No pastors at the church coulda saved me
Swear to God, Man, the Devil couldn't tame me
Going hard 'til them motherfuckers grave me
Young and Brazy, & ain't no one in Jesery that made me that
You in the field with the income, you laying flat

[Hook]
Looking passed all the ones that I looked up to
All my stress, I got a blunt full
Complications, got a cup full
And if you don't feel me, then it's fuck you
Swear I want everything to work out
I'm burnt out, she turnt out
Swear I just want everything to work out
I'm burnt out, the one you heard 'bout
Word is you been taking lotta percocets
I'm hoping that it don't kill how you feel about me
Heard that you been popping all them bannies
I'm just hoping you ain't forgetting to think about me

[Verse 2]
And you can't relate
Unless there was days where you looked in the mirror at someone you hate
And all them drugs that you doing ain't there, so you getting the shakes
On top of that man, the man that you call your right hand ain't around because y'all isn't straight
And your little brother won't leave your side, cause he feel like any minute you'll die
Don't act surprised, yeah I can come with some baggage
But I'm never lacking, know I'm packing something there to fuck the party up
Move it from my lap to under the seat just to get some head from your shorty, yup
[Take the mood like we from Saudi?]
Look when niggas had it started, lived my life like I was heartless
Nigga don't become a target

[Hook]
Looking passed all the ones that I looked up to
All my stress, I got a blunt full
Complications, got a cup full
And if you don't feel me, then it's fuck you
Swear I just want everything to work out
I'm burnt out, she turnt out
Swear I just want everything to work out
I'm burnt out, the one you heard 'bout
