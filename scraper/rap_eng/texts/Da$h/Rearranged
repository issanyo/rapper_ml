[Intro]
You didn't have to do that shit, nah mean?
Know what I mean, D2 on that, you know what I mean?
Aye, so, aye, so, aye, so, aye

[Verse 1]
Ain't no more to say, I'm just tryna score a play
I call your ho today, a nigga tryna fornicate
I thumb through all this cake, bet your nigga surely hate
Lil bro just copped the K, we move just like the IRA
Aye, after the uniform, move with the toolie on
We with unruly guys, lifestyle scrutinized
Nigga, we get it together, we split it together, I'm gonna quit
See who'll diss me, she jump in the whip and she blowin' the dick
Speed in the foreign, I crash it like fuck it, I'm doin' a stunt
Holdin' the wheel while I'm sippin' my liquor and rollin' a blunt
Frontin', no cappin', I'm livin' your dreams and I'm goin' in hot
In the field with the pen, in the field with the gang, you niggas can die

[Chorus]
Aye, and I swear they say I changed
Circle may get smaller but the shit got rearranged
Aye, aye, and I swear they say I changed
Swear that half my bitches out the screen or off the page
Aye, aye, and I swear they say I changed
Circle may get smaller but the shit got rearranged
Aye, aye, and I swear they say I changed
Swear that half my bitches out the screen or off the page

[Verse 2]
Uh, snakin', uh, geekin'
Say that I did it before and I'll do it again, nigga, fuck what you talkin'
.40 go up, took one in the head, you keep barkin', we get you a coffin
Swear that the bitches want headache, the ho wouldn't buy if there was a auction
Swear that I need all my work for the show and if not, then I promise you talkin'
Coughin' off that thraxx, my nigga, grew up in the North and I had
Been with all the shit since niggas jumped up off the porch and I been
Doin' all these raps so I might slide up in a Porsche, you know you
See me out in public, then I'm with the torchin'

[Outro]
Man, fuck all y'all niggas, it's still the same shit
Global Gang ISIS, all y'all niggas suck my dick if it's opposite like that
Y'all know who it is, y'all know who it was, you know what it's been
Pussy, fuck outta here
