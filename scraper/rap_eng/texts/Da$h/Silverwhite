We could sneak in and smoke a dutch up in that park
After dark, going hard from start to finish
While a nigga heart diminished, they keep telling me it's art
Yeah, I'm starting not to know the difference
I'm just chasing after digits, trying not to fall apart
And so I put the shrimp on dishes
Fucking on these nasty bitches, so I'm pointing like a dart
It got me moving like a sniper
Tryna cop out on a viper, motherfucker hit your mark
And so I'm flying down the highway
Left lane on a Friday, I ain't throwing it in park
Y'all running with a school of guppies
Guaranteed your bitches love me, I'm just living like a shark
He just a predator for cheddar, bruh
I'm with it for the extras like etcetera, etcetera
Know she came naked, just knew I wasn't undressing her
Ben Franklin's what I'm attaining, spraying the messenger
Brain tainted, know I been faded just like your favourite jeans
Got it by any means
It ain't no in betweens, it ain't no in betweens
