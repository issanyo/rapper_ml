[Intro]
17 More Minutes, nigga
I'ma set it off for y'all
I'ma set it off for y'all
I'ma set it off for y'all

[Verse 1]
Living like a nigga waiting for his heart to pop
Came up on heartless blocks (Sack)
When niggas grabbed the habit of bagging up
Like heroin and shit was hard to drop
Rappers sounding like the toilet, stop, yo shit not flowing
Pot blowing while I stop growing
Attain the knowledge by evading college
Displaying violence just to gain a comma
Them shells is copper and gon' hop up out that seven
And go tell 'em when the deed done, spark the weed
Sunshine had made the summers cold
Losing niggas to the system, feed a number of addictions
Contradicting what you kicking, got these bitches soul
Like James Bond, know the vision gold
Solid, mission accomplish until I'm a corpse
Catch a charge and then I'm high in court
Looking for the real, nigga you found the source
In my mind it made me wonder, am I found or lost
Still anti-social, tryna figure what a Island Cost

[Hook]
To all my niggas in the back nigga
Burning backwoods busting down a pack
RIP to all my niggas who got clapped
That's why we run around with the straps
Live nigga rap
To all my niggas getting bands
Run around in the hood with them grams
All my niggas down to catch a body for they mans
Tell 'em we living off the land
Live nigga rap

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm the last nigga with my last name who ain't lost it
Eldridge Cleaver with a heater and a deeper love for reefer
I'm just looking for the change
And like looking at the cartridge and seeing another name
My nigga this not your game
I'm first to take control just like it's my grip
And I'm getting blasted off that Tech just like it's Talib
Kweli, tested well before it's cut and sold
Medication mother load, getting fellatio in bungalows
Ten hits of lucy out in the Sahara, on my mojo shit
Risen to the occasion just like a pogo stick
Swear to god my every day could be in slow-mo, bitch
Risen to the occasion just like a pogo stick
Swear to god my every day could be in...yeah so

[Hook]
To all my niggas in the back nigga
Burning backwoods busting down a pack
RIP to all my niggas who got clapped
That's why we run around with the straps
Live nigga rap
To all my niggas getting bands
Run around in the hood with them grams
All my niggas down to catch a body for they mans
Tell 'em we living off the land
Live nigga rap
