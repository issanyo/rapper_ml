[PART ONE: "JUST HAVE FUN", produced by Like]

[Intro: Ab-Soul & Da$H]
Have some fun out there
Smells like fuckin' dope in here
So, do the drugs, don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs, don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs, don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs, don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs, don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs, don't let drugs do you

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Up jumps the Boogie bitch, I boogie board on these instruments
(Roll that weed, nigga)
Riding the wave like a lie detector, if I'm lying I'm flying, nah
(Shake that ass, ho!)
If I'm lying I'm lying, in dirt, that's a metaphor for dying
Miming like Morpheus foresaw me saving Zion, that's
More fire, that's more fire, that's more fire, that's more
(Roll that weed, nigga)
Set that mouse trap, you fuck around, yeah you fuck around and get smoked
Got that loud pack in these Backwoods like summer camp,  dwell on that (roll that weed, nigga)
We used to dub cassettes, but now we poppin' Percocets
I don't be in no pain, I just like how it feels
I close my eyes and follow beetles in strawberry fields
Munchie munchie, Welch's fruit snacks and Mrs. Fields
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, you niggas know the deal
(Son, do the drugs, don't let the drugs do you)
Psy-Psy-Psychedelic savage and I'm telepathic too
(Shake that ass, ho!)
Ask Al Boy and A-Mack about when me and Q did shrooms!
And that one ho was getting grooved in the next room
I flow like, Russell Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind" (roll that weed, nigga)
That's a colorful touch like homosexual hugs (shake that ass, ho!)
And I try to tell these motherfuckers all of the time (roll that weed, nigga)
Don't forget my dash, or you'll get left behind! (shake that ass, ho!)
I'm fast, another one bites the dust just at the sight of us
They liking us, to lightening striking over Mount Everest
That ever so, talented establishment
TDE. Jay Rock, K Dot, ScHoolboy, me... Soul
(What up, Zay? What up, SZA?)

[Hook]
When I cross the street I look both ways
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
And the new drugs got a nigga trippy these days!
Just have some fun (got that dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just have some fun (that dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just have fun

[Verse 2]
I just wanna teach you all about the mind (roll that weed, nigga)
The power in it, the very power of mine (shake that ass, ho!)
It makes sense I take interest in the third eye
Due to my lack of sight, I guess it's a sacrifice
Cause I've already envisioned what the world looks like
So when it's handed to me, I won't need to look twice
They swear I read a lot of books, or I got straight A’s
Katrina cleared my absences so I could walk the stage
I never paid tuition, but I paid attention
That's why I gotta make it count when they pay admission
Took my third hit of DMT and then I melted in
(Met the devil in God's elbow)
And this is what he said...

[Hook]
When I cross the street I look both ways
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
And the new drugs got a nigga trippy these days!
Just have some fun (got that dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just have some fun (that dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just have fun

[Skit]
Hi, my name is Jimmy
(Hi Jimmy)
I'm a friend of a rapper
You may, you may, also know me as the white Ab-Soul
I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
I like Denim Jeans
And I'm an alcoholic...

[PART TWO: "THESE DAYS", produced by Blended Babies]

[Hook: The O'My's]
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
Smoke, drink, relieve my stress
Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
Smoke, drink, relieve my stress
Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess
These days I've seen my best
Need be lay me to rest
Smoke, drink, relieve my stress
Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess

[Verse: Ab-Soul]
(Swear to God, this the only time I’ve used this flow)
I'm more than man, I died and I rose again
I left these holes in my hand just so you know who I am
An alien, extraterrestrial, ET's a mini me, you understand?
Look what I did, smoke like a chimney
Then add to that, that I smoke like the hippies did back in the 70's
So many styles I write with a ghost
Like I had assistance, but this is just dope
Bottles of Belaire, the prince is the freshest
Tree by the elbo we get for the LO
So I should be happy, but this shit is stressin'
Staring at heaven like ''Fuck is perfection?''
I'm popping downers to deal with depression
Cause when you the plug here come the finessing, finessing
Smoking dope with the hitters
Don't know no new niggas and business is business
Can I get a motherfucking witness?
