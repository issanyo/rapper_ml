Wanna know what happen when you cross me?
Bang, bang, no Chief Keef
Throw 'em in the Lake with Shorty K from the Chi'
And my nigga D-A-DOLLA, that's my motherfucking guy
Yeah we in the fucking booth, getting motherfucking high
Off a cup of purp, feeling motherfucking right
Really off the purp, I ain't say it cause it rhyme
Yeah these fucking rap niggas, they don't live a life of crime
But I'm still up and running cause I’m still up in coming
So everything you talking about you did it, bruh, I does it
Do it, do it, I motherfucking do it
Riding no L’s, making stops in a Buick
Everything I made last night, bruh, I blew it
Fuck it, think about some days that I couldn’t
Pull my dick out and I made the bitch do it
When she swore up and down on the cross that she wouldn't
Ha, now you going to Hell, bitch
Remember all them fucking cold nights in the cell, bitch
You know how it feel to wake up in the cell, bitch?
So when I'm on my bully don't be thinking I'm selfish
Nah bitch, cause I know what I dealt with
Talking out your lip like you're trying to get dealt with
These other niggas crabs, I ain't fucking with shellfish
Thinking I'm a rapper but really I sell shit

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Volume on zero, nigga talking 'bout he turnt up
Perc' in my purp, nigga 'bout to get slurped up
Burnt nigga from the turf
Chump wavy motherfucker hoes talking 'bout surf's up
Flier than yesterday, higher than yesterday
Run through my enemies, seeing who next to pay
Blunt in my mouth, see which bitch next to lay next to me
Long as her head is especially good
Rolling up a Backwood, like you should
And I'm high as hell, know why it sell
Shouts out to Q, room 22 at the fountain blue
And they blowing lines, popping pills
Drop a ounce in the Rémy so they know it's real
Hoe went down on me like a Navy SEAL
No coming up for air, thought she had the gills
So I put the rail away and I skated
Y.N.R.E. what I'm claiming
Prescriptions got me sedated
Throat on the counter, so bitch we ain’t dating
Fuck is you saying, talking 'bout you better than who?
Fuck being a crip but your [?]
Only time a young nigga catching the blues
H’z

[Verse 3: Shorty K]
All I know is getting cash bitch
Fucking hoes and hitting Saks Fifth
These niggas hate and I love that shit
But stay off my dick cause it's in your bitch
I'm on paper so I'm on the drops
But I'm on this paper, that's why I own a drop
I'm 'bout that bitch, take a photo op
Off lean I move like RoboCop
Nigga why she bald, CNT
Bitch give me head, DDT
She fuck me good then roll my tree
And she got a man, EVE
My neck hurt, this big chain
I'm a little nigga with that big change
Nigga think that I'm a quick stain
And just put the chop on my bitch name
I'm swagging out in them red bottoms
I keep spikes, mixed game
In the club with a hundred bottles
Standing on the couch, Rick James
Turnt up with my New York niggas
Foreign bitch, she a Euro, nigga
Only thing I fear is that bureau, nigga
Hoe try me, and you're a mural, nigga
Uh

[Outro: Da$H]
That’s that work
