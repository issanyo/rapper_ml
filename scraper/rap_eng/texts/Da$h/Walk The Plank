[Verse]
Got my thumb on the hammer
Index on trigger
Three hundred and fifty-seven [?] barrel
Ain't tryna scare you
Just tellin' y'all niggas
I dare you to fuck around
Catch me out when the sun is down
On a slow-mo creak
[?] in a fishbowl
Ridin' 'round with a coke nose freak
Bet ya bitch know that boy Dolla diabolical
Rap until my pockets full
Knock the pack off in a school zone
Keep it going while you home
The forty was two-tone
And I'm sliding in town with that crew
Feeling like we fresh out the zoo, oh yeah
If you was me you couldn't do it
I'm still out here losing my screws

Fuck what you thought
Motherfuck what you thinking
[?]
Fuck what you thought
Motherfuck what you thinking
[?]

[Verse 2]
Young Blood tripping
But my palms is steady itching
If they get to [bringing?] that bitch get to singing
Never been no pussy
If it's drama nigga bring it
[?] still be smoking
And that liquor still be drinking
They want me [the spoken son?]
But there cannot be more than one
Pussy nigga I'm running up
Bitch you dumb, I could kill for a half a P
When I'm blacking out there somewhere half a G
Yeah, yeah
It's a classic, a masterpeice
Actually
They know why I'm finding your drugs
Or your plug up in traffic me
And clapping off capping B
