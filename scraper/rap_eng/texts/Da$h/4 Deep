[Intro]
Yeah, So (FMH'z 'til I'm under)
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
Said it's FMH'z 'til I'm under six feet (FA$TMONEY H'z nigga)
And I'm pushing the flowers, these hours that I spent recording
The reason why bitches adore me and rappers is cowards
It's just my opinion (it's my opinion) nigga
It's the plot that thickens, see the shit I'm kicking
To be from rolling dimes, to blowing fifty pieces up at Kathy Griffin's
See who really listening (my niggas listening and allat)
Yeah, I did this shit off the flow, nigga
Ain't dark enough to pour more, nigga (pour more)
Know I need three zero's at the door, nigga
Brought the pack out 'fore I did a show, nigga
Home invasion, face painted like The Crow, nigga
Now the crowd screaming out "Yeah So", nigga (yeah, so, yeah, so)
From the county where the boys got a bounty on a young man
Wanna get lit (fucking see me and allat)
Where a bitch get gassed by a bag
Set her baby father up for a lick
Same nigga that eat at your mama dinner table
At the feds station, turned snitch
Where a couple pounds of weed and a hundred pills
Help a young nigga get rich

[Hook]
Four deep, real G's roll four deep
Hold heat, fish bowling on a slow creek
Blow trees, codeine, don't get no sleep
More loot, more cream, I need more cheese
Four deep, real G's rolling four deep
Four deep, real G's rolling four deep
Four deep, real G's rolling four deep
Hold heat, blow trees, sipping codeine

(Yeah So, nigga)

[Hook]
Four deep, real G's roll four deep
Hold heat, fish bowling on a slow creek
Blow trees, codeine, don't get no sleep
More loot, more cream, I need more cheese
Four deep, real G's rolling four deep
Four deep, real G's rolling four deep
Four deep, real G's rolling four deep
Hold heat, blow trees, sipping codeine
