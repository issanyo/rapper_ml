[Hook: RetcH]
I be riding, I be rolling
I be drinking, I be smoking
I get so high, I get so high that I be floating
Rolling off a pill or two, I'm feeling like the ocean
I'm in constant motion, sour diesel potent
Henny be the potion, Molly got me open
I get so high, I get so high that I be floating
Ain't looking too good but for tomorrow I am hoping

[Verse 1: RetcH]
What you niggas really know about living fast
Roll my blunt and pour my glass, start the car and hit the gas
Speeding while I'm rolling, cruising while I'm smoking
Swerving while I'm sipping, tryna push it to the limit
You would swear I'm tryna kill myself
I ain't worried 'bout my health
The mottos for tomorrow
If we make it we go harder than we did the last night
Think I missed that last light
And I ain't got no L's, oh well, the feds can go to Hell cause

[Hook: RetcH]
I be riding, I be rolling
I be drinking, I be smoking
I get so high, I get so high that I be floating
Rolling off a pill or two, I'm feeling like the ocean
I'm in constant motion, sour diesel potent
Henny be the potion, Molly got me open
I get so high, I get so high that I be floating
Ain't looking too good but for tomorrow I am hoping

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Red star, blue star
I'm off 'em both, now life looking like cop cars
I'm at the bar, pour me another drink
I got a problem, bitch, I give a fuck 'bout what you think
This dark and cranberry got me in a wave
She started tripping off the whip and now that bitch my slave
Living like the left lane on the highway
I'm sideways, drug life, nigga getting high pay
While timeflies, my eyes closing
Try and get up, bitch and just try and focus
18, [?] the flow, way that I'm rolling
I dare somebody to try and tell me I'm not loaded
Sour diesel blunts, I'm on my seventh bitch
So high when it's not lit you could still smell the shit
And I'm smoking more than the niggas who sell the shit
Heir Gang, Fast Money dope, just go inhale it, bitch

[Hook: RetcH]
I be riding, I be rolling
I be drinking, I be smoking
I get so high, I get so high that I be floating
Rolling off a pill or two, I'm feeling like the ocean
I'm in constant motion, sour diesel potent
Henny be the potion, Molly got me open
I get so high, I get so high that I be floating
Ain't looking too good but for tomorrow I am hoping
