[Intro]
(Yeah, So x4)
(Bud, Grade-A, Bitch, Grade-A, Gun, Grade-A)
(Bitch, Grade-A, Drugs, Grade-A)
*Woman Screams* (Shut the fuck up bitch, if you wanna live)
(Ayy, Grade-A, Grade-A, Grade-A)

[Hook]
Fuck the cops, fuck the judge, fuck the DEA
Sippin' jugg, DE for a rainy day
If my teacher saw me now what would she say
Same thing that the fiends say, Grade-A
Grade-A (x17)
Fuck the cops, fuck the Judge, fuck the DEA
Yeah, So (x8)

[Verse]
Bendin' corners, burnin' bridges, breakin' bitches
All while tryna duck a sentence too
Young and troubled, I'm the pinnacle
Getting who, tre eight on the physical
Snub turn your brain to noodle soup
Came to show these niggas who is who
Packs that I flew and sold in school, Grade-A
Mayday, don't fuck with no naysay, I ain't seen shit
Walter P with the beam kit
Need some cut to mix the lean with
Turn your wife into a scene bitch, all facts
Got some niggas servin' life times cause most of y'all niggas all rats
Observe from the top, blowin' pot, sippin' drop
And I swear I ain't lonely now that my demons my homies
I swear if they could they would clone me
Completin' the mission, my flow is forbidden
I swear you too big for your britches, I'm fuckin' they bitches
I'm from the era where you bang and you givin' out stitches You faggots wouldn't known, I'm gettin' to the dough
Anyway I can, Moore's fatha kitchen, then we baggin' dope
Out a fuckin' brick, doing hand-to-hands
You would think we playin' ring around the rose
London town, a couple thousand pound a show
Bitch, don't you say that I ain't international
Ever been to places when you go to other places
Their customs will hassle you, trappin' for capital
All off of rappin', know that I'm snappin'
Young and I'm active
You try to interfere, my instinct is clappin'
I'm true to my faction
We move out the tightest of regiments
Surrounding myself with some predicates
Destination, where the cheddar is
Slidin' down, off the sedatives
Ridin' 'round, off the medicine
Weapons is guns and intelligence
Say that the Devil sent, I'm sure I ain't Heaven sent
But then again, yeah I'm hella bent
Yeah, I'm hella bent
But then again, yeah I'm hella bent
They say that we Devil sent
I'm just sure I ain't Heaven sent
Then again, yeah I'm hella bent
Hella bent, then again, yeah I'm hella bent

[Hook]
Fuck the cops, fuck the Judge, fuck the DEA
Sippin' jugg, DE for a rainy day
If my teacher saw me now what would she say
Same thing that the fiends say, Grade A
Grade-A (x17)
Fuck the cops, fuck the judge, fuck the DEA
Yeah, So (x8)

[Outro: Da$H & Stevie]
No stress, more checks, more sex. What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?

What you smokin' on? You smokin' on some fire?

Might be some Ammi, might be some mafuckin' Cheese, it just might be some Hogs Breath. I just know I smokin' better than y'all niggas is smokin' at home

Aww yeah (True)

And they gave me a school bus

Right, not a green room, but a green bus

Nigga, I'mma professor nigga

That's life

I'm professor nigga

That's progress

I'm professin' nigga

My profession is; livin' like a wild mafucka and makin' y'all niggas hate y'all shit or just wanna do it like me. Cause don't front you wanna do it like me

PREACH

Real talk. RIP Yams, Free Mugga nigga, I don't give a fuck 'bout nothin' else. My niggas or nothin'

It's all love
