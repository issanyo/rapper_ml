[Intro]
Come into the motherfucking room like lightening, man
Ya nah mean, you ain't even see me and niggas already know I'm there and shit
Ya nah mean?

Said these drugs got the best of me
Bitch got the worst
And this rap shit got the rest of me

Fuck are y'all niggas really doing, man
Yeah *clears throat* yeah, yeah
Free Mav, yeah so, yeah so, yo

[Verse]
The drugs clear like the liquor
Stare at the dealer just by looking in the mirror
Hear a woman's nose working while I'm still in a dream
Dick in her mouth before I woke up out and pack exchange
Dough is counted
Still the same nigga on the train, nodding out
No bed, drool stains on my mother's suede couch
Before these bitches started fucking for these words from out my mouth
I would cop another pack so I could smoke another ounce
Sex a hoe and pawn her father jewels, shallow as the kiddie pool
Living by them gritty rules, you take or get took
Face of a crook, he fucking both the maid and the cook
They double as college students, I'm just paying for books
We making trips to the lake for the shook ones, garbage disposal
Crash the whip and jump out the shit like the car wasn't totaled
Became a czar with the vocals, infest your hood through the postal
Poppin' on a nigga just because my dog doesn't know you
It's that guy, Smacktrick Bateman
Stomach full of someone else's medication
Telling Satan I'm gladly waiting, rushing to finish
Clutching the spinach, alias cause I'm ducking the sentence
He live life bolder, I'm a pimp like Dola
Might spike sodas, Klondike Rover
Don't like sober, shit, but I hate the system more
We come together ain't no prison they can send us all
What options did they really give us y'all?
The only shit a nigga saw was motherfucking being rich or poor, or

I think these drugs got the best of me
Bitch got the worst
And this rap shit got the rest of me

I said I think these drugs got the best of me
My bitch, she got the worst
And this rap shit got the rest of me

It's what I'm guessing b
If you ain't know, nigga
Yeah, So
