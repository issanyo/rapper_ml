[Verse 1: Da$H]
Yeah, So
Polo Sporting Goods
Mr. Eon is here
Shit I'm inhalin' got me smellin' like death in the place
Foreign substance, only thing keep the stress off my face
Ones I run with man they usually keep weapons on waist
Cheddar to chase
He dead in face and got bread in the safe, game over
Flame quoter when I ain't sober
Engage hoes up in a Range Rover
Exchange flows for niggas payin' quota
Exchange Yola for the bitch ovaries
Please give me my cheese
Preyin' on rappers, I swear I'm never hitting my knees
Cold as a fuck, I hit the room, you feelin' a breeze
Domin' me up, a Roman slut I flew in from Greece
It's me and him or whatever you call me, show me the utmost
Feelin' like I'm Thutmose, french inhalin' gun smoke
Savior to my brothers, to my mother I'm a thug though
Everything thats wrong or right just blame it on the plug yo
Uh, I never blame it on the drugs though

[Hook: Retch]
If you my mans, the only way it should be
If it's more problems for you, that's more problems for me
So more problems for us, that's more problems for them
I ride with you 'til the end, which means the grave or the pen

[Verse 2: Retch]
Started eatin' acid tabs, I ain't been the same since
Hands shakin', smoking the dope
Picture my life as getting throat on a boat
Chauffeured around gettin' lit in the car
Barely old enough to drink at the bar
A lil woozy off the shit in the jar
Came up with coke, I keep the drugs in my coat
I like to wake up, take a piss off the roof
Old heads salute the kid as the truth
I tell tales, identify with the youth
That's the reason they ain't fuckin' with you
They can't relate with anything that you do
I learned my thuggish way via the strip
This thump provided, that was via the blip
I'm in the lot blowin' tree in the whip
The leaves is scattered cause approachin' is Fall
All my life I just wanted to ball
Now I'm slam-dunking, all in the paint
My new bitch provide a foreign escape
I'm smokin' loud, pack throughout the estate
The view is aerial, observing the lake, nigga

[Hook]
If you my mans, the only way it should be
If it's more problems for you, that's more problems for me
So more problems for us, that's more problems for them
I ride with you 'til the end, which means the grave or the pen
