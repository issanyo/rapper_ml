[Verse]
And I just want some things to change momma
I just want some things to change
I just want some things to change momma
They been calling me insane kinda
They been calling me insane
They been calling me insane
Just tryna put you in that range momma
Just tryna put you in that range
Just tryna put you in that range momma
Living dangerous just to chase commas
Living dangerous just to chase commas
And I'm like, baby would you still love a nigga
If I up and went broke
Would you go and put that bread up on my books
I seen the judge and got smoked
I said I needa know
I needa know
Shit, I needa know
Tell me an answer, I figured no
I figured so

[Verse]
Yo, your style need a DNA test, who's the father?
Rolling a blunt up in the barber chair
They see my face and say that god is near
Business, I'm in it, don't involve a queer
Niggas know me, got the knowledge like I'm Obi
Sons don't go to war, you niggas hard, you gotta show me
Living out my years, Kobe, that's deuce-four
Fuck a cute whore, up in the two door, fucked up on Route 4
Just a Jersey boy, across the world, the people heard the noise
I take your girl and turn her to a coin, shit
That's head and tail, the rifle like a mop, it need a pail
Whip the color kale, wylin' 'long as I got the bail, nigga
