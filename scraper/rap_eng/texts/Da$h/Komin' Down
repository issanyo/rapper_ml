[Intro: ???]
Oh no, no, no
I'm coming down now
Oh no, no, no
I'm coming down now
Oh no, no, no
I'm coming down now
Oh no, no, no
Yeah
Yeah
I been lit too long
I been lit too long
I been lit too long
I been lit too long
I been lit too long
I been lit too long
I been lit too long
Oh no, no, no
I'm coming down now

[Verse: Da$H]
In continuous motion
Just causing commotion
I tell myself that all this shit ain't that potent
Or maybe need more doses
My body keeps telling me no
And my mind is just telling me don't
And your bitch she just telling me go
Even though she got a man she give me her throat
It's an even exchange, on the road for the change
I'm just tryna bring change to my niggas
See the picture get bigger
I'm chasing these bills, making thrills
And I'm popping these pills with no consequence
So you know these drugs have been my problem since
I was ducking my momma since
Bagging them 10-per-10s
Bumping Thug Motivation
Waiting for niggas hating
Know they can get replacing
I don't do no statements
Free all my niggas that's in them cages
Just count my paper
