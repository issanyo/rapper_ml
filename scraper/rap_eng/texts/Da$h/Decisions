[Verse 1: Da$H]
Dolla, been going hard
Fuck is a job, fuck is your squad
[?], need a minaj
Told her were friends, and I got me some hammers, [?]
[?] sucks, [?]
[?], holding onto a [?]
And I won't need the padding, I got dough in the attic
I got dope in the fridge, I got guns in the cabinet
I got shells on the dresser, remember days I was stressing
All them lines I was pressing, get the etch and then sketch it
Shit, I got me the pound and I gave her a pack, I put her in traffic
Nigga packing, no lacking
If I want it, I go and I get it, I've having it
Niggas is acting

[Hook x2: Man-Z]
Come and fuck with us, baby girl this shit is different
Take another puff, put you in a new dimension
Take another puff, you ain't never seen us living
Tryna fuck with what, that just might be a decision

[Verse 2: Man-Z]

[Hook x3: Man-Z]
Come and fuck with us, baby girl this shit is different
Take another puff, put you in a new dimension
Take another puff, you ain't never seen us living
Tryna fuck with what, that just might be a decision
