[Verse 1: Marc MavriÂ¢k]
Hit a lick

Then she sucked the dick
Yeah I told her strip
Yeah I told her strip
Mothafucka you fuckin' with

Chillin' wit' the 'files

Crackers gave me 5 shoulda gave me 6
Suck the dick

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Risk taker like Evel Knievel
Mickey Knox wit' the box cutter
Woulda play a dead bolt the way it lock butter
Cop hunter, invest in the block in case the stocks plunger
Rap is cock munching
I'm top tier, let it off and then the block clear
I'm who opps fear, you faker than a croc's tears
Straight for sauce and the taker here to steak the odds
Play the cards right, you end up a dealer with pounds to the ceiling
Assorting paper work, you a squealer
I don't need partners, in and outta state, counting mounds of cake
Cross the map, price is see-sawing up and down the rate
Saw your bitch had some lips on her so I drown her face
Same newspaper, different story, niggas really bore me
Rhyming poorly, say you real but repping all your homies stories
Living like a [?], mob connected nigga, drama tested
Mac-11 with the cooler out is turning problems wretched
Mind infested, devious thoughts help me pay the cost
Living wild, appointment with the reaper get filed
Problem child, going hard until my number dialed
I turn the phone off, fuck it nigga I'm thrown off
The Captain make it happen, ran myself into a gold Porche
Porter need a Mazi, and the [?] end up a body
Mav did 5, came home brolic, we need the profit
Want the drop 6, live off experience, on some lock shit
Dead man walking, I'm sparking anything cross my path
4 pound larking, it turn a faggot to walking scabs
Test my word, my niggas flexing, bending, and stretching birds
All my men absurd, mess of murder so that the message heard
Yeah, pussy nigga cut that text alert

Cause if you ain't know, and so you do now
Global Gang, Black Market
