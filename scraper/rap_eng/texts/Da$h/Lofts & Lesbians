Uh. Some women showed up (showed up)
Liquor got po'd up (po'd up)
Killer got rolled up, your friend told me to grow up
So I laugh a bit, po' me a fo' of this Actavis
Sip it real slow, mama have a sip
Twist me a blunt but I ain't passin' shit (passin' shit)
Yeah you can roll ya own, not for nuttin' baby girl but we both us grown (both us grown)
Doin' drugs what I do condone, have a stick on the east side of my tongue that gotta nigga in the zone, oh
Can't lie, beyond high, and I can see it in your eyes (eyes)
You start askin' me these questions and I start feelin' all on your thigh
So what that lead to? Plus you keep checkin' your peoples
But by how the bitch starin' look like the drugs got affectin' her carin'
You pulled out my dick and she asked if you sharin' (asked if you sharin')
And you concur (and you concur)
Molly and the Henny and we fuck all night 'til it feel like a blur. Yeah
Jumped in the deep end, feel like I drowned in ya waters
Blew like a motherfuckin' seven, hood they call that a quarter
Hard-wood floors on the loft so you know all the neighbors heard the sounds
And don't worry baby we'll sleep when we comin' down (lofts and lesbians)
