[Verse 1]
I was mummified in my other lives
Bucket high, the blood in my eyes
From the tide while they run inside
Telling Benson "fucking drive"
Burning a shrine, the world is surely mine
Nothing will suffice, I place my bet and then I roll the dice
Remy red, and tell the waiter hold the ice
I'm an example of the difference between men and mice
You disrespect we give your life a price, nigga
Proceed with doubt you'll only see the clout
Ingesting acid as I ski the alps
Posted in Sweden but receiving some Parisian mouth
The whip the color of an eagles scalp
It seems the shit I now achieved I couldn't be without
It figures, until the pine box it's me and my niggas
Tryna blow up, just so that the picture get bigger
Rolling dope up, that's what make my vision get clearer
Ask who the greatest, look myself in the mirror

[Hook]
As of late I mix the hash up with the grass more
Another stamp off in the passport
Tryna see the otherside like a glass door
But dog this is what we asked for, this is what we asked for
And now I pour the lean off in the glass more
Another stamp off in the passport
Tryna see the otherside like a glass door
But baby this is what we asked for, this is what we asked for

[Verse 2]
Slid out the Nebuchadnezzar, in search of cheddar
Found a plethora, a couple heifers, etcetera cetera
Your life whatever, mines is better, tie dye Carrera
Dining in a lion sweater, all off rhyming clever
Wearing latex to escape death
All my J's have taken great steps
Evade press, blunt is filled up with that apex
Drunk off in a five star, I ain't even get my plate yet
Said it was no smoking but I wouldn't have it
Wine glass look like a bowl of carrots
By the end of the meal I cut the veal with a switchblade
Hit the valet, and I make your bitch pay
Pull off, bumping Say What by Donell Jones
She only fuck me cause I write these poems
Live my days is how I write these songs
I fuck the game when she ask for it
God damn I'm living fast [?] last long

[Hook]
