[Intro]
Fuck is y'all doing
I'm drinking that liquor nigga, drinking that prohibition
The fuck is you talking 'bout
The fuck is you talking 'bout

Stay on that, ayy, stay on that, stay on that, yeah
Talking shit, laying facts, yeah

Yeah, So (x3)
Uh

[Verse]
Sleep with my Glock like my bitch (yeah)
I'm on a plot to get rich (so)
Hoping my niggas get closer (yeah)
Drugs what I'm doing the most of (so)
Ain't tryna brag or boast (yeah)
Get money over every coast (so)
Bullets trapping like the post (yeah)
Talk tough, you niggas toast (so)
Been through some shit you ain't get used to
Way that I'm living ain't usual
Showed up to show you who's who
Hear you missing like the Blues Clue
Opposition get decapitated
Lapping niggas in the track, I'm racing
Blunt was laced, you know I had to face it
Beat the shit if ever caught the cases

We tryna bug tonight, we got the burners tightest
Feeling like [?], I try my luck tonight
Call up your bitch, I'm like, "I'm tryna fuck tonight"
I been drinking as of late, pardon my intoxication
Take your bitch out for a steak, all my hoes in publications
Doing shit, you can't relate, packs up on the interstate
Level [?], I been [?]
You niggas bluffing, niggas fake
Packs up on the interstate, bitch, don't act like you ain't know
Take your bitch up on a date, bitch, don't act like you ain't know
Pack up on the interstate, bitch, don't act like you ain't know
Take your girl up on a date, bitch, don't act like you ain't know
Act like you ain't know, as if you ain't know
As if you ain't know, and act like you ain't know
As if you ain't know, as if you ain't know
As if you ain't know, as if you ain't know
