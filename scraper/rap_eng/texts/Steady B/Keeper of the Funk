Yo yo man fix the box man, its out of sync man get it right!
Yeah right there, we flowing now!
Got the [? 0:16] right!
You know, check it out man let me put these rhymes up on this [? 0:20]
Start the into, me I'm so low
Hit the beat, you wanna learn have a seat
Now pay attention, the lesson is taught
Try to hang on but you're coming up short
Playing for keys now allow me to be frank
Showing that ass therefore I'ma spank
Providing the sound, yo Eaze in the back
Step to the stage then commence to attack
Your eardrum, with some funky sensation
I've been blessed, on a hilltop quest
[? 0:45-0:47] to uplift
Lost souls, get money in rolls
So I think its time for me to get mine
As I continue to climb the climb
Without the help of a ladder, I never jump
Cause' I'm the keeper of the funk

(Scratched Sample)
Steady B get wicked! (x4)

(Steady B)
Funk of the temple, the beats in motion
Not the same hype but a total different type
So you know I'ma capture ya'
You're scared as hell when I'm after ya'
The hilltop sucker you can never stop
Never escape, cause' I'm the real great
Seize ya' soul, control the mole
When hands of life you gotta pay the toll [? 1:34]
To be in effect, when ya' climbing a mountain
Reaching the top, so hard you might drop
So few can dwell in the realm of dopeness
It's a fact, to label you wack
In this feel, I shine like a star, riding this street like a brand new car
Crusin' just like a missile your ship has sunk
By the keeper of the funk

(Scratched Sample)
Steady B get wicked (x5)

(Steady B)
Yeah I know, check it out, Steady B and I'm the keeper of the funk you know what I'm sayin'? ha!
All the way live from the hilltop hustlers nation
Gots' to be Cool C, L.G. the teacher, DJ Ultimate Eaze in the place, Clever Dancer, E Marbles, JoJo Dancer, Mentally Gifted and Grand Dragon K.D
[? 2:38-2:41]
So we gon' take this all the way to the 2000, you know what I'm sayin'?
And I'm outta here, peace
