The Hilltop is where I roam
The only place I call home
It's the place where the brothers are right
You just call em hustlers and they come out at night
The boys up on the Ave keep things up tight
We're just like a party sometimes we fight
Yeah up on the Ave in a jump skip or hop
Get the fresh cut at Watson's barbershop
I'm proud to say this is my part of town
Cold chillin', 60 Landsdown
The Hilltop

The storyteller, with a story to tell
Without Steady B, man rock so well
Pull a gangster beat, that's my reason why
I can rock the microphone, and you'll say I'm live
Cause I'm a beat rhyme composer, rhymes I compose
You'll line up in rows, saw you in the shows
The gladiator of the mic, gain this battle of words
When I say it you'll agree I'm the best ya heard
Fresh from the start precise like a dart
Think ya got heart, I'll rip it apart
A poetic rhyme speaker, born to be a teacher
Can't wait to see me you're like a [?]
And when I rock I can't be stopped
My part of town is called the Hilltop

Steady B reignin' and the time has risen
For you to get back up dance and then listen
To the explanation of how I rock so well
Make ya stand in amazement, then make ya yell
I keep the Hill hype, certainly the type
To keep beats, ideas, rhymes fresh so right
I really can't explain it, it's just my job
I make people jams relate it or I get fine
I love what I'm doin', wouldn't trade it for nothin'
The heat of the stage, with the woofers steady pumpin'
The holler of my name when I'm introduced
Jumpin' around, sweat pourin', get loose
Then I'll do whatever you say, yeah that's it
I'm hot like a fire by the audience lit
Takin' the time cause I would never stop
And you know where I'm from
The Hilltop

Yeah and I know y'all down with Steady B
So just flip it over to the fresh side
