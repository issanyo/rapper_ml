[Verse 1]
It's been said before, Steady B has the knack
To come exact with the stupid fly rap
Just like routine if you know what I mean
I create easily but so it seems
Electrifyin', no one is denyin'
The fact that I made it because I kept tryin'
Suckers keep talkin' and I don't know why
Just to say they dissed Steady, they keep livin' a lie
But yet I'm on wax, and they're still schemin'
Wishin' they was me, they need to stop pipe dreamin'
I have no mercy, it's a dog eat dog
And when it comes to eatin' I'm a greedy hog
It don't take a high IQ to understand what I'm speakin'
Lyrical genius, and I'm teachin'
Suckers, ducks, and toys that are mad
But deep inside they wanna say
[Believe me das bad]

[Verse 2]
I really don't brag I let the people brag for me
So pump my beats cause that's what reassures me
That when I rock, you're gonna listen
Or either dance as long as I have your attention
Yes I been taught and the best I fought
To gain a recognition and I think I ought to
Be gettin', not by sittin'
While Steady B rocks parties for a livin'
Yes I get paid after I rock each place
I'm lookin' at my pockets with a grin on my face
Yes I stand kind of loose with the gold that I'm sportin'
Suckers are the ones that make me feel important
Never uptight, I get even not mad
Tat what do the people say?
[That sure that bad, dat right]

[Verse 3]
Believe me I'm bad like I said it before
Steady B is back, begin to see with some more
Don't carry a gun cause my mouth does the shootin'
Walk into a jam, you hears the fans rootin'
Takin' out suckers at the blast of a whistle
Packin' more power than a 9mm pistol
Focused, pinpoint and on target
You have every reason to regard it
As the freshest lyrical displayment
If you want me, then there's a payment
When I hold the mic, take cover I'm ready
I rock this way that's why my name's Steady
Motivated by the cuts, I have risen
By means of Tat Money, with sharp precision
Hip Hop could never be a fad
And the words I just said
[Believe me, believe
Believe me das bad, believe]
