Steady B, the ultimate and back on track
Let the rhyming I design to be right and exact
I'm staying right here so you won't forget me
Hey DJ, just hit—
(Me)

Well just bust a move, cause I'm ready to soothe
Sit down and relax to the Steady B groove
On the mic agile, all you fakers will smile
"Can you stop?" No, never. At the top of the pile
(Hit) That's right, that's the name of the tune
And now that I'm in the place, everything can resume
The way it was when I first left
Just walking out the door, people say "He's def"
Going for the gold, can't be held back
Grabbing the mic just like a quarter back sack
Once more must say, you won't forget me
Assault me, hurt me, what, just—
(Hit)
(Me)

The beat will be perfected by the way that I rhyme
So enhance your better chance cause you know it's due time
For me to put it together so precise
You can't help but to say that the boy is nice
I keep the party hot, never left in the cold
Steady B, that's me, 17 years old
That's [?] and still so clever
Check out the tongue and watch it sever
The beat it has the micstand left in half
It'll [?] I have the last laugh
To be the best, my ambition is set
To use the mic, now how good could you get?
Now it was stated before, you won't forget me
I can't get enough voltage, just—
(Hit)
(Me)

Just a microphone addict who's always at it
Some people say I'm just a fanatic
The greatest drama that you will ever hear
Don't mistake what I'm saying cause I'm saying it clear
Could switch it up or even turn it back
Transform into a discipline a sample of rap
For me, myself, and I stand alone
Proving I'm def, and so I have shown
Breaking all rappers from coast to coast
And if you want to be next to become my rap roast
Then say a line; give me a sign
Open your mouth and then you speak your rhyme
(Rock) (1) (it)
(Rock) (2) (it)
(Rock) (3) (it)

Eliminate MCs who still persist
That think they can deal with something like this
The words out my mouth will let them know
If you're not my friend then you are my foe
I'm been banned from jams, people won't let me in
Because the loud-mouthed sucker, man he just can't win
Against me, Steady B, the ultimate MC
And if I'm not a [?] say that's the way it should be
I don't brag about my style or things that I've accomplished
When I say I'll take you out, you can keep my promise
Man, I'm the master of the lyrical kingdom
To gather [?] MCs and I'll ring 'em
Check out the DJs across the cross fader
People think they're rhyming, they're just a perpetrator
Everybody says Steady B is himself
Not like other people trying to be somebody else
People on a line, man they're ready to fight
While I sneak up and attack them like a thief in the night
I take my time to write my rhymes, I never [?] 'em
Wake up the next morning with bite marks in 'em
Like I said before, you won't forget me
That's right everybody, just—
(Hit)
(Me)
