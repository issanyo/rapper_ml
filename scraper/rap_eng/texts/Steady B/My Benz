My Benz and I cruisin' on the block
And that's the reason why everyone's on my jock
When I park it, it's like it's on display
They all pass, their eyes pop and then they say (hey!)
I used to dream about the Benz but now I'm ready
Shiny black Benz, license plate reads STEADY
My Mercedes and I, man we keep cookin'
I'm only 17, that's why they keep lookin'
At me and my Benz are like best friends
The way that I got it, because I got ends
Which means money if you wanna term it
It's parked in the garage so jealousy won't hurt it

My Benz
[Cruisin' down the street]
[Repeat 3x]

[Verse 2]
Shot out the spot like a bat out of hell
Picked up Tat with the 560SEL
And people wanna speak who never spoke before
"What's up Stead?" Don't wanna hear get your hands off the door
It's cause of the Benz, just like a magnet
Just say Mercedes and they try to get at it
Tri-star emblem at the front of the hood
Go ahead and try to take it cause I wish that ya would
Ya wanna wear it on your neck, then wear it alright
I pulled out the 9, it wouldn't be a fight
I challenge my Mercedes just like my lady
Her name's Lynette and she's my black [?]

My Benz
[Cruisin' down the street]
[Repeat 3x]

[Verse 3]
It's built for speed with independent suspension
Covered leather seats for added dimension
It's waterproof but I'm not James Bond
I'm 007 secret agent of rhyme
I just washed my hair, a car wash might scuff it
[??] wax it and I buff it
My Benz is sparklin' shiny like a mirror
You can stand next to her and won't hear 'er
Take my word or even ask my friends
When I die I'll get get buried in my Benz
I'm covered with insurance cause people wanna steal 'er
I don't know why I guess they wanna feel 'er

My Benz
[Cruisin' down the street]
[Repeat 4x]
