[Verse 1]
(Down By Law)
Must be talking about me
The one and only almighty Cool C
You're reaching for your goal now I'm reaching for mine
Yo you can kiss me where the sun don't shine
Don't sit there looking dumb
It seems you forgot where you came from
You and Shante I know where you got your start
Right here in Philly on Pop Art
What I'm saying is true, you're just illing
Label to label, Bridge to Cold Chillin'
I'm standing here telling you the deal
And I'm going by what my heart feel
J-u-ice is what I'm serving
Listen to the rhyme cause it's self deserving
Come to the show bringing all my boys
The Juice Crew won't you (kill that noise)
I'm rocking all parties and I'm dissing juice
The Juice Crew Dis so I gotta get loose

[Verse 2]
Listen close to the rhyme cause I'm doing the do
It may be a story but it's all true
Jack, you're all about fronting
Before you met L.G. you was nothing
Living in a project looking for more
Yours was D9, Shante's on the sixth floor
You went with her to every show
But Shante's nothing but a (project ho)
Just ask Marley, I know he heard
Ask him if he did it (W-w-word-word!)
Boy, you want to do this right
We can drink Pepsi and then we'll fight
But I'm not making nothing on the mellow side
But something definitely to hurt your pride
You can get mad, scream and have a fit
But I don't give a bit cause I ain't hopping your bandwagon
You soft sucker you ain't nothing but a itchbay
I come from Philly so ixnay the idgebray
Six rhymes ready and I bet I won't miss
My name is Cool C and this is Juice Crew Dis

[Verse 3]
Boy playing games, do you wanna play
I know everybody knows around your way
That day you got dropped off NIA
I know never in your life will you forget that day
Sucker you know I'm dissing
It's all facts so you better listen
Wouldn't you believe it, I'm taking you out
The Juice Crew Dis is what it's all about
First in line man you know it's you
Ha ha man your butt is through
The true story's being told to the world
While you're out on tour I don't want your stinking girl
It's dedicated to you, you chump
You hear my record, I bet Kool-Aid pumps
I'm dissing you and I ain't thinking twice
This time boy, you better be nice
Sucker, I got a lot of spunk
When I get on stage, I ain't popping no junk
I don't know how hard you can max
But you best believe it boy, your butt'll get waxed
I hope you went to school and learned comprehension
Cause these are facts that I'm not scared to mention
It's a true rumor that's going around
That I'm stating facts that you're not down
Cause when it comes to dissing, jack I don't play
Cause y'all ain't nothing but anyway
(Have a nice day)
