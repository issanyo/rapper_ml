[Verse 1]
Steady B reignin' with this hardcore speech
And I'm back, yes back, and I'm bound to reach
This point that I'm achievin', I'm a rapper not a prankster
Hard as hell, rock so well— a rhyme gangster
Like Al Capone— I've shown
That I'm vicious when it comes to the throne
Lyrics— my ammo, mic's—the gun
I'm like a automatic— yes you'll run
The underworld ruler, big daddy of rhyme
And cold gettin' paid without commitin' a crime
I say Valentine's massacre and shockin', plus hip hoppin'
A description of me and I'm gangster rockin'

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I'm back in the flow
Microphone controller and the king of disco
I'm smooth as silk when I'm doin' the do
And I'm down with the Hilltop crew
So suckers all hail, the gangster has spoken
And ya wonder why MCs start croakin'
I'm dealin' in rhymes, so don't bite
Cause I'm deadly, 5'8" in height
My voice will never crack— stays clear, straight momentum
A gangster rock brother dope rhymes— I invent them
With ease, sucker MCs don't even bother
Cause you know it, you can grease
Cause when I rock no one is stoppin'
Me Steady B and I'm gangster rockin'

[Verse 3]
I value life, come correct with the supreme subject
I keep schoolin', rhymes I perfect
Tat up on the wheels, Steady to the rear
When it's time to throw the turntables— he tears
A finger on a scratch, a rotate the wax
Sit back, relax, cause I begin to tax
I got nerves of steel, heart like stone
First name is Warren, last name McGlone
As I begin to analyze rhymes I provide
When it comes to rappers Steady's your best buy
Got the reputation for bonafide lyrics
So move when you hear it
Sucker MCs I say your soft like cotton
Don't pay it no mind, you might as well be forgotten
Steady B, the people keep jockin'
You know why? Cause I'm gangster rockin'

[Verse 4]
The overlord of the mic, stand alone against foes
If any wants to beat me, only heaven knows
So stand back, I'm on attack
Relinquish all doubts
About the capability this man pulls out
So I say some go, Steady B's on the flow
Before I reach my conclusion I'ma start the show
Can get a party jumpin' if ya mention my name
I long it to the rappers, that's how I reign
I'm here to prevail, don't fail
Get down on your hands and knees and all hail
Hip Hop it won't stop, don't stop the Hip Hop
Cause I'm rarin', ready, huh what's Steady B
And Tat Money, the people keep clockin'
And why? Cause we're gangster rockin'
