[KRS-One]
Come again!  Steady B like this

[Steady B]
I'm serious, as serious can get
Especially when the mic's involved I won't sweat
I came here tonight to do what's right
To make you move, make you groove, with the rhymes I recite

[KRS-One]
I was listening to BDP when suddenly...
Believe it or not, this is a remix, this is a remix
Yo Doc, break it down like this!

Believe it or not, this is a remix, this is a remix
Believe it or not, this is a remix
So we're gonna have to break it down for Steady B
My name is Blastmaster KRS-One
Yo Doc, break it down like this!

[Steady B]
I'm serious, as serious can get
Especially when the mic's involved I won't sweat
I came here tonight to do what's right
To make you move, make you groove, with the rhymes I recite
I'm so serious, I won't tolerate
Any posse, any crew, any single fake
Serious, when it comes to women
Ain't about games so make sure you're given
The S to the T, E-A-D-Y-B
Microphone sets fire, don't ask why a
It don't for me, and you plus your crew
And if you miss it now, then you boo
Cause I'm going straight ahead, it ain't no reversing
Steady B is in the place so stop searching
I came to rock you, that's the main reason
And as the best one, I still ain't leaving
Til I catch a couple beats, start to freak
And then you know, my job's complete, cause I'm serious

[KRS-One]
Because of the fact that this is a remix
We will now take the time...to remix it

Yes man, and BDP is definitely serious
Steady B, definitely serious, Cool C, definitely serious
Tat Money, definitely serious, Ms. Melody, definitely serious
DJ Doc, definitely serious, come again Steady B like this!

[Steady B]
I'm gifted, physically and mentally
To make a rhyme as serious as I can be
Better and better I get rough and rougher
The MC's suffer, they had enough of
Maybe young poor they're scared and I'm fearless
Of my attitude, is serious
The pressure's on, all joking aside
Cause I'm a maniac, so you suckers better hide
Time to get paid, don't act funny
Especially when it comes to my money
MC to the death, my last breath
Will be kicking the rhyme til there ain't none left
Man I'm not crazy, MC's don't faze me
Amateurs, just don't amaze me
Yo listen up, Tat is on the cut
And if you don't like it, who gives a --

[KRS-One]
Wait wait hold it!
Weirdos! Shockos! BDP is cold rocking terrorizing suckers again
Yes man, yes man
And we are definitely serious in today's 1999 society
BDP is always ahead of their time and so is Steady B
So we're on the label called J-I-V-E
And of course on the mix is D-O-C
And we gonna do it a little something like this
Cause the name of the crew is BDP
