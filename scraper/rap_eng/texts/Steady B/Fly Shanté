(Intro)
Yo Stead, where's Shanté?
Man, she dumped me
She dumped you?
Yeah, man
How you get involved with her anyway?

(Steady B)
Now it was this girl I seen her everyday
In school she looked cool I wanted to relay
This message that I had all bottled up
Beside me, you can  it was my destiny
To have this girl I didn't have a chance
I used to think about me and her romancin'
And everyday I used to see her just a-comin' my way
And woulda someday, (Fly Shanté!)

I'm Shanté! (cut and scratched)

(Steady B)
She would come to school, walkin' up that hill
I would say to myself, "Lay down the deal"
I get a glimpse of that face, turn around she's gone
And I would hit myself, saying "Damn, what's wrong?"
(Damn, what's wrong?)

(Shanté)
My rhymes are def, I put them at the top
And you got mad, cause it's you who got dropped! (what!)
Picture, a sucker like you dropping me
So listen very close to what I say
Cause I go by the name of (Fly Shanté!)

I'm Shanté! (cut and scratched)

Suddenly...that I wish this girl belonged to me...

Fly Shanté!

I'm Shanté! (cut and scratched)

(Steady B)
Now me and this girl..
She treats me like a boy...
She treats me like I was a master of work...
My heart starts yearnin' for this thing that I call a young lady..
For gettin' involved with (Fly Shanté!)

I'm Shanté! (cut and scratched)

Fly Shanté!

Shanté! (cut and scratched)

Say hello to her ? time of day!

If you think I'm with Shanté, I'll say I gotcha
Cause the girl in a dream was named Natasha

I'm Shanté! (cut and scratched)
