[Verse 1]
Well stop, look observe as the lyrics excel
(?For this order they create?) with the words that I tell
And pursue the fame the crowd I persuade
Control this mic— that's how I get paid
(So what's your name!?)
Steady B— yeah you got it right
The MC, the master of the ceremony tonight
So no more delayin' with the beats of my playin'
With a rap legend, people think I'm a mint
Cause I'm the greatest rap warrior, suckers gettin' sorrier
Fans want enough sayin' "Steady we adore ya"
Add this, I must insist
Sucker dope assist, or you will get dissed
Tat, keep spinnin' is his claim to fame
Just open your mouth and shout what's my name!
Steady B!

Yo Steady
Get Stupid
(Repeat 3x)

[Verse 2]
Man I keep the party rockin' rather whole half the night
And if biters want to bite that'll lead to a fight
People know I'm bad, therefore I don't front
Say yo my name is Steady and I get what I want
I'm always connected body movement is swift
Biggest dudes eats words to enhance the gift
Of rappers like that I'll do until I retire
Tat control the wheels but get my mic wire
So I can get some crowd up and jumpin'
Not by singin' but just rhymin' somethin'
I'm number one, my success is my reign
Tat where's it at? Yo what's my name!?
Steady B!

Yo Steady
Get Stupid
(Repeat 3x)

[Verse 3]
Showin' you I'm the greatest, so I have shown
I've reached the battlefield and I'm standin' alone
I don't stroll see manifest might even say that I strut
Fans, those who don't like me and I say so what
Cause I'm here to stay, yes I'm long lastin'
Rhymes in over suckers, dark shadows I'm castin'
My rhymes are boil when a step that sworn
Won't try to cut the vinyl cause it's already torn
But Tat a DJ, others he's waxin'
And while I'm busy brother the Hill will start taxin'
Microphone filled that's how I get into it
But yo Tat show 'em how you (do it)

Tat Money
(6x)

[Verse 4]
Yes, yes, yes
Yes come on down I suppose on my path
And Tat— sharp cuts DJ's in half
And I punish thin rappers just for no reason
Maybe it's because it's the sucker MC season
The meaning of my name Steady is terrorizin'
And sizin' up rappers to a steel risin'
I knock 'em out with a one two punch
And after that it's done, me and Tat get lunch
It's Steady B, I cite when I write
Just pause— the black hat is my mic
Well it's '87 time to stack bills
With the legendary lyrics, like a villain they kill
Along with my beat when the rocks increase
I'm beatin' down rappers, so MC's don't sleep
You'll get lost in the (source I'll bust when I reign?)
Just bow on your knees and tell me my name
Steady B!
