Let's all get physical, I'll say it loud
With the mic in my hand for me to lift the crowd
Let's get physical, and do what I sing
Get your body so shaky, it's your bell I'll ring
Let me hear your body talk, I want it to scream
[?] say back, I [?]
Girl let's get down, let's start the action
[?] that physical attraction
Let's all [?] when you walk in the place
See you got [?] not [?] your face
[?] wanna get-get physical right now
Betcha did it last night, so don't ask me how
So get physical

When I say get physical, I don't mean fight
That's not what I'm about, I just use my mic
So y'all just listen to me, get physical, they insist me
For [?] so they can't resist me
So get out your seat, get physical on the floor
While Steady B rocks the crowd you'll surely ask for more
Look at the people, see how they get physical
A jam into the [?] middle
When the only thing that I want you to do
Is get physical

Well I'm activated, I know that they didn't miss me
You know I'm gettin' physical, girl you can't frisk me
I'm talkin' to girls, ladies or females
Steady B can get physical and hit the bells
[?] get physical before it [?]
Make your body want to talk and never [?]
I [?] get busy
[?] get dizzy
Get physical

Get physicalâ€”I'm doin' bodily harm
With the movement of my lips, not swingin' my arm
I taught you MCs with verbal abuse
So you better keep your distance when Steady gettin' loose
When I get loose it's loose I get
So all you suckers better duck or you might get hit
It's all but guaranteed to take you out on sight
So B will paint a rhyme, we just might fight
Get physical
