[Verse 1]
I'm distinguished
The competition is relinquished
I'm standin' in amazement after you've seen this
Words are put together are then translated
Inside the microphone you won't debate it
Hear the choice and the fact that I'm back in the spot
Steady B, me, rock nonstop
No one is parallel to the sound that I'm usin'
I'm like a bomb and there's no defusin'
No other can contend, oh no, NO NO!
But when I rock the microphone beginning to the end
Tat up on the cut like a nympho slut
Rotate the tables, I move my butt
So don't be slow when it's time to move
I don't care what you do don't disturb this groove!

[Verse 2]
If you're bettin' I'm steppin', MC's don't sleep
Cause Steady B the rhyme master is about to leap
Into new heights, I'm a poet when I write
Focus attentions on the mic, not fights
Beats so hard and I choose to pick
The man on the drums poundin' with two sticks
His foot on the bass, the combination is completed
You can't delete it, you surely can't beat it
Come on funky drummer, catch the suckas in a slumber
Takin' control, who know is my number
Yes I like the rap, let my rhymes commence
You wanna beef but do so at your own expense
I create the rhymes that make perfect sense
Don't claim that I'm the king, cause I'm the hip hop prince
Voice so seductive, aw yes move
And when I'm in control don't disturb this groove!

[Verse 3]
The (better jam ya most?) cause the best arrive
And you can take my word I will never deprive
You, or anybody else for that matter
Cause after you hear this jam you will chatter
Sayin' that you heard it, sayin' Steady did it
I keep the fire burnin', cause of course I lit it
DJ Tat like a one man band
Blendin' sendin' beats with his hands
My groove will keep you swayin', so.. don't disturb it
Just rock along and with me you can word it
There's no disruption, I'm serious
Pay attention, I don't care if you're delirious
Lyrics so def, not easy to digest
And even harder.. was the (feelin' depressed?)
Got the mouth of a preacher but I'm not a faker
Like Jim Baker, a scandalous maker
I rock the mic, and you move
I bet you can't bust this groove!

[Verse 4]
Don't bet it, you won't forget it
The groove will make you move if you just let it
Don't break the floor, make sure you know
Imagination is the key in order to grow
I'm internationally known, the mic I own
And when I start to use it, minds get blown
I mean what I say, not known for schemin'
Makin' rappers bite their tongue, when I rock I'm supremin'
I got rhymes like (boast?), create beats like symphonies
So def that's why I make so many enemies
My groove is unsurpassed
Won't break, or tilt, and built to last
Through thick and thin, in all kinds of weather
With patented lyrics, it's put together
With the style that sure to sooth
Well Tat Money cut the funky groove!
