[Hook]
We don't have no time
(No time in these streets, everybody's hungry and trying to eat)
In the city of gold
(Everybody's out for their own, it's hot round here even when you're out in the cold)
Trying to get me some sunshine
(It's hard to find peace here, never can you be easy, always gotta beware)
And avoid the patrol, oh yeah
(But that's life in the inner city: up to no bother, trying not to get collared by the piggies)

[Verse 1]
I'm fed up, all I want is a little nice weather when I get up
A lot of people arrive zealous
But life here's less a dream, more a nightmare
Welcome to the city of gold, the city I roam
Home to the grittiest roads
It's hardly a party, getting our Ps on the same corner where woman sell Narni
I live amongst vermin, I'm stuck, but I couldn't give a fuck as long as I'm earning
Long been accustomed to the ways of the manor
The filth are an occupational hazard
Parked chilling in a car park, grinning, it's gone midnight and I'm half passed sinning
Got a dark heart wicked with my rasclart lyrics, I'm a bad boy you don't wanna start no shit with

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Time's precious and it moves fast in a city of bright lights and tight dresses
Medusas' that'll seduce ya if ya ain't ready
A city that makes few and breaks many
The city I'm in's less like the city of gold, more like the city of sin
Where everybody's in it to win, from villainous nippers to city slickers with sinister grins
Straight ain't religious, never been into hymns, and I pushed bars before I'd ever been in a gym
So for my freedom I keep hoping, cause I don't wanna walk through the doors these keys open
I don't know if you think it's nice or something?
But I can show you a different side to London
To think you came here for the treasures, but nobody ever came here for the weather

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Jack the Lad, I put the work in, for the wage of sin
Even if by some poor sod's loss, I care not, I will take the win
So many came so full of hope, only to be deflated
The roads we walk ain't paved in gold
Alone is how our day's spent
Don't think cause I'm polite I'm nice G
Or cause I'm well dressed I ain't grimy
I got food for them city heads, just another aggie youth that the city bred
The cloud I'm under thunder's loud, I ain't waiting for the day that the sun comes out
If you wonder what I'm under now? The same shit I was and will be 'till I'm underground

[Hook]
