[Intro: Max Elto]
They say that life is always easier
After you let yourself come undone
They say they'll give you whatever you want
And they'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
Till I'm in the ground

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Keep your past your own, I don't care about before
I don't wanna know your secrets, I wanna help you keep yours
No one needs to, no one'll ever know what we do
Where we go, why don't we go to a place where only we know?
Where we escape from real life and it feels good and it feels nice
That we ain't yet but we still might
Cause we go with it if it feels right
And it feels... feels amazing
We ain't ready to see the day

[Hook: Max Elto]
And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
Seizing time where no one's been before
Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
And I'll be keeping secrets
Till I'm in the ground

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
Let go of fear
This can be a secret that we both keep, that we both share
Hidden behind the smiles we both wear
As the sun creeps through the curtains
On the walls we become two silhouettes
As we close our eyes
Let go of the lies that fill our heads
Let's light it up, live life in the moment
Why would we worry about where we might end up?
They can't see us, they can't judge us, it's just us
They might wonder but only know where we go when the sun comes up

[Hook: Max Elto]

[Bridge: Max Elto]
I'm in the shadow of, the shadow of the the sun
Where I belong, girl, there's something coming on
I'm in the shadow of, the shadow of the the sun
Oh, and I need you

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
Chasing it, chasing it
I don't know what I'm chasing is
All I know is I've been craving it
Ever since I had a taste of it
Life is what you make of it
We're just here writing our own books
This is just a page of it
Before you wave your fingers at us
You better make sure your hands are clean
We all obey, our hands are tied
And I don't wanna have to leave
I don't wanna say goodbye
They say life is always easier when you come undone
When I go, you'll know where I've gone

[Hook: Max Elto]
