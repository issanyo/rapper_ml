[Verse 1: Professor Green]
First off, I know I ain't no angel
But silly me for thinking that I could save you
For thinking that I might be the one that could change you
Said you would change but all you did was pretend to
So is it any wonder why I resent you?
And I knew you were wild but I thought I could tame you
Fell for the you that you were, then wanted to change you
Guess it's unfair to blame you if you're unable to change you
For you to be any different just ain't you
You ain't ever been anything other than unfaithful
What should I do? Cause I could stay with you and just make do
But I ain't ever met a woman so fucking ungrateful
I grew so sick of your fables, can't even bear
To be in places I used to take you, I used to love you
But now I hate you, can't bear to see you on the TV
So I even got rid of my cable

[Hook: Tori Kelly]
Don't mess with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't mess with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
Really, what was it all for? It was awful
For a minute it was hot but it so quickly
Started to cool, couldn't have written this shit
If you were an author, it was so different in
The beginning, a couple friends were telling me I was tripping
But you can't help who you fall for, guess you were tricking me
But if you were ever in trouble, I was always the one that you'd call for
This is torture, I always dealt with you calling
Couldn't even tell me the truth, it was your friend who was informing me
What was you even with me for? Was it all a [?]?
Instead of you cheating, couldn't you have thought to leave?
You must hate me, why? I can say that I did
But I don't ever wanna hear you say that we tried
I don't love the way that you lie, I'm giving you the boot
A little like Dane Bowers to Katie Price
