[Intro: The Fray]
You got your plan

[Verse 1: The Fray]
I was so blind, now I can see
You got your plan to bury me
But I'm still here, I will hold on
I won't let go cause I'm so strong

[Hook: The Fray]
I just can't listen anymore
Because I've heard it all before
I can't fulfill it anymore
So now we're breaking down the doors

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
People say I changed but I didn't flip, we were never a lie
All the thing did was emphasize our differences
The difference is I didn't stop, I didn't rest, I didn't quit
Still, as was, we both know who the one acting different is
Grew up in the same track, trying to find our way out
Eventually I skipped the shortcuts and went the long way round
The game ain't for everybody, maybe it just ain't for you
Me, I carve the path I walk, you took the path they paved for you
Finally I made it through, now you’re trying to break me down
I’m everywhere, you’re never there, yet you complain I ain't around
What, to keep it real, I got to pick up a bag and shot again?
You're not a friend, fuck it, I'll see you next time I'm on the ends!

[Hook: The Fray]

[Outro: The Fray]
I just can't take it anymore
Because I've heard it all before
I can't fulfill it anymore
I can't fulfill it anymore
Forever more
