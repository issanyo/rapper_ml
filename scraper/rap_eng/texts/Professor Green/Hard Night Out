Cause I’m in a rave with a chick
You think I ain't with my clique
You’re gone, they’re in the background waiting for it
I’m drunk Blazing a spliff
Minding my own vibes
And with two fingers in the sky if I’m liking the show

I’m sick of all the bullshit, though I hear it all the, time
I wasn’t watching you it was your chick that caught my eye
So talk to your girl don’t be all mad at Green
I ain’t looking at her backside it’s looking at me

I wasn’t looking for a hard night, maybe a lady, nothing crazy, no bar fights, but this prick at the bar’s still getting quite loud so I guess it’s gonna be another hard night out

I wasn’t looking for a hard night, maybe a lady, nothing crazy, no bar fights, but this prick at the bar’s still getting quite loud so I guess it’s gonna be another hard night out

If I ain’t got my blade in a jam
I’ll be throwing bottles at babies in prams
Acting like a mug, but could I give a fuck, no?
Fuck no! I won’t remember none of it tomorrow

So I lie I’m a white light
Drink liquore and smoke bud until I white out
I was looking a half pint, not a night out
But I guess it’s gonna be a hard night naaa!

I wasn’t looking for a hard night, na
I wasn’t looking for a hard night out
I wasn’t looking for a hard night, na
I wasn’t looking for a hard night aaaaaaaout!

I admitt that I‘m wreckless, and a bit demented
At the bar taking more shots that 50 cent did
I don’t sip drinks I down mine
And not a rap in the club until I get picked up and kicked out side

And get picked up by policemen, Who cares
At least I get a free bed even if it is freezing
I believe in releasing
I work hard all week then get battered at weekends, what?
