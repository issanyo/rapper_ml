Make, make, cheddar, cheddar
Lecture number 1, learn something
Professor Green, yeah

(Hook)

For all my dealers that
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick
For all my dealers that
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots

(Verse 1)

This is for those who do a little more than weed smoking
You know, pay in, pay out, re up then re load it
Fuck fame, the aim is to make them papers
Made it from an O to more Ki's than caretakers
Had to slow down it was taking my time
Didn't have time to make up my rhymes
Not that I make up my rhymes
Life don't imitate I or imitates life
I, use to lick shots all over L-O-N
But picture me pushing brown when I lost a friend to heroine
Picture me pushing rocks when I seen that look in the man's Lost all the fiends, waving dreams goodbye
Gone, if you're gonna lick shots shift crops
And if you want that link Profs

(Hook)

For all my dealers that
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick
For all my dealers that
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots

(Verse 2)

I got that high grade in pounds
You're paying 180 on the O
I'm paying that minus the 80 on the ounce
Not to glamorise, this life can be quite lethal
In this day and age for half a Ki they'll tie you up and beat you
Man have made mistakes thinking i'm mashing when i'm not
Look I've seen the ups and down, see I've won and I've lost
See I mixed the po with the home grown, that's 2-8 a Ki
So that it's po and made a lot of profits off of weed
Done someone a favour licked a shot for a few Ki's
And some pussy pulled a bucky on me
A couple days later I'm arrested and the pigs took half a Ki
And my close friend got beat up by the police
The boys yard it was a B and his girl over the situation
I'm here thinking that it was all because of me
So here's my apology, I'm sorry
It's all my fault and all because I do it

(Hook)

Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick
For all my dealers that
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots

(Verse 3)

Haters wanna diss Profs but their shit's soft
And their pissed cause, they lick crops
And their shits not, as sick
Or even nearly as nang as Pro's, this pro-er flower
With something a little different, each and every time
Excel at each and every grind I try
I guess i'm destined to suceed, arrested over weed
But not convicted so the kid can still go over sea's
Find a rapper with a sicker flow
No, i'm more sicker than you spitters so
If you're licking shots stick to flipping coke
Or else you'll end up flipping broke
Pissed at Pro cause i'm the shit, you're just shit so sit and soak
You're full of old ideas you need a different bone
If you ever thought for a single second that this isn't Pro
Think I'm just bullshitting and it's a flipping joke
Come see me you'll get shown ya dunknow!

(Hook)

Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick
For all my dealers that
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots

(Outro)

P-G's got that crazy shit, blazing the skunk up
Whilst i'm making hit's
P-G's got that crazy shit, blazing the skunk up
