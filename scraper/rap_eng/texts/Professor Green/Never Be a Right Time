[Verse 1: Professor Green]
This is stressing me
It's really beginning to get to me
You've always been the best to me
And I've never given you any less of me
You never been in a negative energy
I'm stressing
You tell me never to let it get to me
There's never been another next to me
That means
What you meant to me
I said meant but that's mean
I meant mean to me
Not meant to me
But I don't know if it's meant to be
I wanna tell you
But nothing's coming out when I speak
I can't find the words to say
It's like the words evade
Me
Struggling to find a way to word it
And I'm supposed to be a word-smith
It's as hard to find the words to say
It's hard to find the words to say

[Hook: Ed Drewett]
They'll never be a right time
The time will never be right
They'll never be a right time
For me to tell you
It's over

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I was selling white
You were telling me I could do better
I told you
If I was you I'd leave
But you never
Forever had faith in me
Even when I never did
I'd said I'd never let her slip
Like her ex-fella did
Been trying to disguise it and dress it up
I wanna tell her but I can't bear to see her welling up
I gotta find the strength to let her know
I gotta find the strength to let her go
But I know if I let her go
I'll never know if things will get better with her
See
This could be a hiccup and not the end of the road
I'd do better to never get involved
She deserves better
Than a fella with a fear of being alone
Struggling to find a way to word it
And I'm supposed to be a word-smith
It's as hard to find the words to say
It's hard to find the words to say

[Hook: Ed Drewett]
They'll never be a right time
The time will never be right
They'll never be a right time
For me to tell you
It's over

[Bridge: Ed Drewett]
I can't help the way I feel
I don't want us to end
But I can't help the way I feel
I really can't pretend
No
I can't help the way I feel
But I don't want us to end
Cause it would never be enough
For us to just be friends

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
Nah
It'll never be enough
So I think we both know what it means for us
I see the look on your face and I hate it
But I finally pluck up enough courage to say it
That's when she spins me around
And tells me I ain't never leaving
To tell her I take it back
And tell her I don't mean it
To look her dead in the eye
And tell her I don't feel it
But I don't feel it

[Hook: Ed Drewett]
They'll never be a right time
The time will never be right
They'll never be a right time
For me to tell you
It's over
