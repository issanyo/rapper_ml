How many moons
How many mornings
How many moons
How many mornings

[Link: Professor Green]
Have I got left til' I've no breath left to breathe
How longs left for me
For whatever the time, for the rest of mine
I'm gonna spend time
Putting an end to my
Enemies who wanna put an end to my shine
Why bother try offending me?
Its off with the heads of these swines
When I sign out you're gonna remember me

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Remember me?
Don't nobody wanna send for me
The only time they mention me or speak of me disrespectfully is when they sleep
I've been between a lot of legs, like a body of a centipede
Please enemies be more courteous, save me the sweat and forget to breath
Life could be easier, I could ease it up
Instead I look like someone tryna squeeze a dump
And I haven't eaten in months, any of these MCs on the edge?
I'll be the reason they jump off
Remember the Jump Off?
When I come forth
You don't wanna be the MC I run toward
I like my liquor like I - straight, I ain't no Dumbledore
Untoward to sluts, like I love and adore you
But it's custom, I come before you
And it's cool if I can't it up, cause I've got a cucumber for you
Fuck the world I'm a stick in the mud
And stingy, wanna' drink? You can piss in a cup
I leave women as livid as stunned
So run your lips, I've been itching to give a chick a bit of a cunt punt

[Hook]
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left til' I've no breath left to breathe
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left

[Verse 2: Dream Mclean]
I'm a genie in a bottle of Lambrini
Baby, rub it and you'll see me, easy
Have a walk in the cemetery
You might see me stalking my enemy
Yeah, or you might see me on ITV1 talking to Jeremy
Cause I got issues, I drink lots
And I got big shoes, big socks
And I tell the girls I'm soon to be famous
I'm just abusing my status
Like "baby let me sign your boobies, I've made it"
And I ain't being rude when I say this
But through my telescope, I see the full moon on Uranus
They call me Dream Mclean, but you won't be calling me that later
When I meet the moon my name changes, call me Kat Slater
So get back and be careful, it's a fact, I'm a werewolf
I'm a lion, with a mouth full a fire and you're a cat with a hairball
So tell me, how many moons round Saturn bruv?
Why you tryna' count moons? I'll be Count Dracula
Whacking ya, slapping ya with a spatula
Rinse, Dream and Green, all out massacre

[Hook]
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left til' I've no breath left to breathe
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left

[Verse 3: Rinse]
When the full moon's out, the loons are out
When the bassline hits, the goons come out
You might get hit up, don't rule it out
You hear (ooh) when the wolves are out
Cause I don't lay weed, I just date rape
And get chicks higher than Rick James's on a space space
They call me Cap Kirk, because I slap skirts
I'll mack an alien as long as the flaps work
I'll make a fat girl moan when I splash her boat
I'll beat it with the Billy in my jeans so bad she's hitting Jackson notes
So it's socks up, with my zipper down
I'm on some arsed Kelly shit but I don't piss around
You think I'm kidding now? No, I ain't Gary Glitter
I'm just that low-down dirty spitter stalking you on Twitter
A full moon and I'm a sinner, wooing you out to dinner
A lunatic, luring chicks to the loo with a pineapple pitter
A wolf in yeaps clothing, I take these sheep home and
Ride em in the hood but when I run their reds that's when they're deep throating
I've got police patrolling, aware that the beast is roaming
So how many more moons before a single silver bullet holds him?

[Hook]
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left til' I've no breath left to breathe
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left

[Verse 4: Professor Green]
Sanity I squandered it
I think I've gone too far in darkness I'm wondering
Ghetts is pissed he ain't on the list
Well I'm pissed off I'm not at the top of it
Deep in thought conspiring, get the firemen called
My thoughts are firing, for I'm not twiddling thumbs
I’m playing the world’s smallest violin
Inconsiderate, like I give a fuck how they feel
Kidnapping rappers and having them as microwave meals
I know my meal's ready when the microwave stops
I'm a lot more Jack Nicholson than I am Michael J. Fox
The creep that crept up on Daisy Lowe
In a baby grow
Sat on her knee and told her to touch me inappropriately until my daisy grows
I'm not a man or of mankind
A mechanical, mad mind
I make Hannibal look more like an Annabelle
I'm an animal at night

[Hook x2]
How many moons (how many moons)
How many mornings
Have I got left til' I've no breath left to breathe
How many moons (how many moons)
