[Verse 1: Emeli Sandé]
Feel like a superhero, what type of dreams are these
I’m as high as a eagle, I’m taller than the trees
And I can’t turn back, I tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted

[Verse 2: Emeli Sandé]
All I hear is music, I’m losing all control
I have no excuses, can’t say I wasn't told
If the sky turns black, I’ll tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted

[Bridge: Emeli Sandé]
Feels like I finally finally found it
More than I, than I could have ever imagined
After all this waiting and this holding on
Suddenly everything was gone

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
Let's double our joys
Divide our griefs
I know that it's been hard
And the heart never forgets what the eyes have seen
The pain and the stress
I know what it's like when all you want is a rest
It ain't about having the strength to carry on
It's about carrying on when you ain't got the strength
Look at where we are
Hotel Cabana, man, and I don't think we'd be here
If we weren't strong
Cause there ain't no weak here, I was who I was
When I got here, and you can bet your bottom dollar
That I'll be the same person when I leave here
It's fine to be scared at times
Cause without a little hope, there won't be fear

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
