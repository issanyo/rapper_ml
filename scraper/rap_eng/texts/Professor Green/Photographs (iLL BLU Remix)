[Verse 1: Professor Green]
I can't believe I left you feeling solo
I was just at Nan's going through old photos
And you ain't in many of them, you're barely in any of them
Three or four of 'em I wish you were in more of them
I just wish there were more of them
'Cause now all I got is memories
And I cry but that river's run dry
If only time was something money could buy

[Refrain: Professor Green]
Goodbye (Oh-oh-oh), but it ain't
With words there's only so many pictures I can paint (Oh-oh-oh)
And I'm running out of film now
There's only so many pictures I can take
How does Faith feel looking at pictures of Biggie? (Oh-oh-oh)
How does Courtney feel looking at pictures of Kurt?
Is the pain worth the thousand words, I love you (Oh-oh-oh)
But I hate looking at pictures of you 'cause it hurts

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye, now our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I wish that I took more photographs of us
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I wish that I took more photographs of us

[Bridge: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Last time we met, I saw change in you
You sat there calm and explained the truth
How addiction ain't nothing but greed and guilt
Could just eat the whole world like a Baby Ruth
And you got under my skin
All the nights that eyes-rolled sunken in gin
'Cause I don't want you to go and die like Owen
And bruv, I really wish I had a picture of him

[Refrain: Professor Green]
Goodbye (Oh-oh-oh), but it ain't
With words there's only so many pictures I can paint (Oh-oh-oh)
And I'm running out of film now
There's only so many pictures I can take
How does Faith feel looking at pictures of Biggie? (Oh-oh-oh)
How does Courtney feel looking at pictures of Kurt?
Is the pain worth the thousand words, I love you (Oh-oh-oh)
But I hate looking at pictures of you 'cause it hurts

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye, now our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I wish that I took more photographs of us
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I wish that I took more photographs of us
