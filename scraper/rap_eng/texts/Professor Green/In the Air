[Intro - Maverick Sabre]
I feel it coming in the air
Save me

[Verse 1 - Professor Green]
I never was a warrior
But I'm always on edge now
Paranoias a corner that I can't get my head round
My life changed cause' I rap well
I rose where some man fell
And I find it hard to watch this
I move boxes but I never stack shelves

Used to be the filth now my worries have changed
I awake from dreams where I'm running afraid
Up against those with nothing to lose and something to gain
Just know that when I wake I ain't running from what's coming my way

[Hook - Maverick Sabre & Professor Green]
I feel it coming in the air
Save me
Save me, if I should die before I wake, take me

I feel it coming in the air
Save me
Save me, if I should die before I wake, take me

[Verse 2 - Professor Green]
I sink into my chair and ink the thoughts that think with my brain
My minds plagued
My train of thought it sticks to my faith
I couldn't fault ya' for thinking that I like pain
I've been tryin to wash away my sins but I'm stained

With a face everybody knows now
Everybody knows me but I don't know how
Cars pass me and they slow down
Tinted windows roll down
And don't know if they know me as pro g or the old me
Some old beef
Somebody looking to give me something back they owe me

[Outro - Maverick Sabre & Professor Green]
I feel it coming in the air
Save me, save me if I should die before I wake, take me
(Repeats till the end)
