[Verse 1: Professor Green]
I can't handle my drugs
So blame Shah and his handful a buds
Before these vocals I was T-total
Till that AK now I'm back and I'm buzzed
Get funky, light one up, get skunky
Let's all toast to me
Toast to green
About to take hold and take over the scene
Or maybe that should be ether it?
Either way, I ain't an idiot
I did quit smoking weed
But that didn't stop me eating it
P's raw, an I been poor
So I could never get enough P, I need more
See-saw, there's 5 saturdays
And I won't be happy till I've hit at least 4

[Hook: Emeli Sande]
It's a long day
When you're rollin' an rocking
And the spin isn't stopping
When you don't care where you are
It's the wrong place
If your looking for sober
You can find him hungover
With the kids that love to dance

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
The professor of rhymes
Mr. Dexter met Lector and had one hell of a time
A devil disguised, lies
You can tell that I'm high by my festival eyes
Festival eyes? Ain't it a Monday?
Fuck knows! May as well be a Sunday
Runway when I take off 6 val's
Whoops, straight lost six hours
I'm back in effect
Got shanked in my neck now I'm back from the dead
But adjusting has been hard
Like I give a shit man? Chicks dig scars
Chicks dig me so I dig 'em out
But I keep 'em all, I never let 'em out
Got about 16 in my cellar now
Yeah I still take bus but I get about

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
The bad boy's back boy
On road with my iPod on singing along to black boys
Then skipping along to Take That
So take that, say what? I hate rap
Ain't that funny
Shitting on rappers like I ate that curry
So? So mind your business
Or wind up with stitches, bitches
Dickless with your wanna-be bars
Impotent rappers- all wanna be hard
Diss me? You must wanna get parred
Faux- par you're so 'barge
Ain't seen a rapper like me yet so far
Nah, I'm gonna take getting used to
The pupil nobody could get through to
On YouTube, in a tutu

[Hook]
