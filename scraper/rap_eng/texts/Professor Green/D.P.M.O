I don't know what that is, but I know that it flows sick
Oh shit, there I go being a dick again
Look at me I can say the longest word in the dictiona
Ry ry ry...
I don't know much but I know the future's bright, the future's green
The future's me, the future's I
Maybe you'd understand me a little better if you were high
Too like my DJ I-I-I-IQ
Make no mistake, I'm just as high-igh-igh too
If you say the wrong thing about me
Your career is something that you can say goodbye, bye, bye to
How's your album doing? Mine flew
This time around I'm doing what I did on the last one times two
And some, damn son!
Have you seen the state of your eyeballs?

[Hook]
Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off
Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off
'Til we stop there will be no falling, no we're giving everything we've got
'Til the wheels fall off we'll be rolling, yeah we go anywhere we want

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Meet at track meet, I eat tracks; that's me
Jack D, Hackney's in my blood, and weed
Accede to the throne, taxi and I'm home
Bad B, black sheep, bag of beans and an O
Yo, I'm getting high tonight
With women who make do; getting bi tonight
I like the life, I ain't into courting
I'm only into spooning if it leads to forking
I'm back buzzing, I'd shag Eva Mendes
Even if she was my damn cousin, please don't think I am bluffin'
Even though I'm swimming and women throw the pussy at me
I ain't tryna catch nothing
I ain't lightening up, I'm still as mean
Still as drunk, still as high, still as lean
Still as Green, stood still
On a pair of stilts in a distillery, sket
The last time I got head, it involved a guillotine

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I don't know what it is man, but
Something about this beat just kinda makes me feel invincible
Yeah, like I could do anything I wanted without any question
I might even cover my naked body in sticky tape and run through All Saints and come out doing my JLS impression
Don't piss me off, (don't piss me off)

[Hook]
