I sell it by the bottle
Oh I'll make it last all night
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh-oh, oh, I got the remedy
Oh, we let it go
So won't you come sit next to me
I got the remedy oh, you never know
Oh I could give you what you need
I got the remedy

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
My life's enough for anyone to get gassed
I could hit a bungalow
8 in a bin bag and still get a quick lash table looking like November the 5th
I won't remember anything memories are myths I'm a piss artist
It's an art to me last seen partying with Charlie Sheen
True its half ten. and I'm looking in the mirror at me so how come I can see two and a half men?

[Hook: Ruth-Anne & Professor Green]
I sell it by the bottle (I ship it by the crate)
Oh I'll make it last all night (Well, I'm wide awake)
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow (I got the energy)
Oh, oh-oh, oh (I got the remedy)
Oh, we let it go
So won't you come sit next to me
I got the remedy, oh, you never know
Oh I could give you what you need
I got the remedy
