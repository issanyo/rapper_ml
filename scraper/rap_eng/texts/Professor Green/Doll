[Verse 1]
I don't know how long I can remain composed
All I did was say a flow, In life I always told
You should play your part, but I never said I'd take the role
Now every fucking thing I say's a quote
And they take shit out of context, I'd be lying if I said I was not vexed
Pick up a paper flick a page and see a picture of me on my latest conquest
Fuck it, it all helps
I'm not just gonna stand here making out it's all hell
And all's well and good if I put on a pair of rose tits
Yeah bare arms, just to show ink
Might show ink off, but I'm not showing off
I would be if I were to let you know what this costs
Lucky for you I'm more subtle than I am flashy though init man
Just know if you don't see it on the wrist it's in the bank
On a mission with a plan, life's a journey and I don't wanna end up in a jam
Where I end ups in the hands, of the Gods, when I'm gone, I'll be going with a bang
But for now I'm flying high and I ain't coming in to land
I'm up high and I like life up here, you're running behind
Somewhere in front of you is my rear

[Hook]
They wanna pick me up, yeah, they wanna hold me
Show me off and talk about me as if I'm their own
How long until they wanna let me go?
They play with me like I'm their doll

[Verse 2]
I'm in the mood, in a feud with myself
The chair's wobbling, and my neck is in the noose
See what I do, I don't ever get to choose
And today there's been a few too many interviews
I mean can I breathe? This new attitude
Is probably gonna leave a lot of people mad at me
It'll have to be, I'll be glad to see some anarchy
It wasn't the money that changed me it was the lack of sleep
To get to sleep I need more than a bag of weed
What happened last year? I can't even remember back a week
It just became a blur, don't believe everything you've heard
Although I heard Peter Burns just became a her
All these people sucking me and telling me that I'm the shit
Ain't any less annoying than those who told me that I should quit
Feel like saying fuck it on a whim, chucking it all in
I ain't some fucking puppet on a string

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I came into this polite, and well mannered
You know I've always believed that you should learn to tolerate things
Cause the world's full of them
I seem to have misplaced my patience
There's how many of you and there's only one of me
I can't keep everyone happy

[Hook x2]
