[Verse 1: Professor Green]
3am on the night bus
Rolling through the city that I love
Illuminated by bright lights
Where there ain't ever a quiet night
LDN the big smoke
A mix of broke and rich folk
Broken dreams and big hopes
On these streets you can see both
Let it all stand still, it gets so loud but feels so tranquil to me
I found peace in the noise
See I'm surrounded but I noticed
The light glimmers my eyes lose focus
But no matter where I go I know where my home is
I'm almost home now
For the people from my hometown

[Hook: Adele]
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
Although it's tough in the bits and it gets rough in the bits
I've got love for the bits, it's gritty but I love where I live
The city
Where kids are looked down upon
But it's hard to flower in the shadow of a tower block
From where we know what it's like not to have and to want
Until one day a flower pops up between the weeds
One of us succeeds, achieves what was once a dream
And it means so much more
I love it just to see it
Success a middle finger to all of our non believers

[Bridge: Adele]
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

[Hook: Adele]
Round my hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, ooh, the people I've met
(Do da di di da da da da do do do do oh oh oh yaaaaaa yaa aye)
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world
Yeah
Of my world
Of my world yeah
