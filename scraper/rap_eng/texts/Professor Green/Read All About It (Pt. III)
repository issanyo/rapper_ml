You've got the words to change a nation
But you're biting your tongue
You've spent a life time stuck in silence
Afraid you'll say something wrong
If no one ever hears it how we gonna learn your song?
So come, on come on
Come on, come on
You've got a heart as loud as lions
So why let your voice be tamed?
Baby we're a little different
There's no need to be ashamed
You've got the light to fight the shadows
So stop hiding it away
Come on, Come on
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers
I'm not afraid
They can read all about it
Read all about it oh
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh..
At night we're waking up the neighbours
While we sing away the blues
Making sure that we remember yeah
Cause we all matter too
If the truth has been forbidden
Then we're breaking all the rules
So come on, come on
Come on, come on
Let's get the TV and the radio
To play our tune again
It's 'bout time we got some airplay of our version of events
There's no need to be afraid
I will sing with you my friend
Come on, come on
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers
I'm not afraid
They can read all about it
Read all about it oh
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh..
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh..
Oh-oh-oh..
Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people
So when did we all get so fearful?
Now we're finally finding our voices
So take a chance, come help me sing this
Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people
So when did we all get so fearful?
And now we're finally finding our voices
So take a chance, come help me sing this
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers
