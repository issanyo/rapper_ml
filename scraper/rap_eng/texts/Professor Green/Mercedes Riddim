[Professor Green - Verse 1]
My skin colour ain't nothing to make light of
We're all the same colour when you turn the light off
If you don't wanna hear this then turn the mic off
I drive women crazy I left your bitch a write-off
Only if the head's right
I forget her name you know what it gets like
Like my whiskey sour, with no egg white
Rolling up a big spliff sipping on a Red Stripe
My bread's sweet, I got that hard dough
Making it look easier, you make it look harder
If I'm ordering food I ain't calling up Ocado
Might fling it in an Uber but I got a couple car though
AMG GT S it up and down the road you might see me wet it
Your lines like coke that I keep re-pressing
My rhymes like coke that I keep repressing
Where's the Merc, I thought you were mashing work
Ping ping I thought you were clapping thing
Where's the cash, I thought you was in the trap
And what's with all the front 'cause ain't nobody got your back

[Dutch]
Look, the place I'm from ain't nothing to make light off
Ride around and turn your lights off
Aww you wanna play, you know no gangsta
The flip it back, ride around and turn your lights off
Cutting through the city, big body Benz
Talking to Pro Green about cuttin' ends
Every time they see us in the streets they're like there they go
Got my bro looking out the window like "that's one of them"
What's with all the gossip, what's with all the chat
If we pull up to the front they're running out the back
You know that I'm getting money, you know that's a fact
With my tools on you know how the goons are
Spray spray we about to take the roof off
Then I shoot off in a new car
It's easy, you're making it look too hard
Slow down, you're taking this shit too far

[Hook]
Where's the Merc, I thought you were mashing work
Ping ping I thought you were clapping thing
Where's the cash, I thought you was in the trap
And what's with all the front 'cause ain't nobody got your back
Got your back, got your back
Ain't nobody got your back
Ain't nobody got your back
Got your back, got your back
Ain't nobody got your back
So what's with all the front?

[Professor Green - Verse 2]
I got that hard shit, download it and bang it in your car shit
Give me the spliff yeah I'm past it
Crack shy but I'm plastered, I ain't a {?}
But everywhere I go I get my arse kicked
See a fan give them a hug though
Don't give a fuck though 'less I wanna fuck though
Give you a quick spud tell you it's all love bro
I couldn't give a fuck if you got hit by a bus though
I buy in bulk, Costco
Umbro, I will soccer if she cost though
Love? No. Me I just run through it
Everything is custom I'm accustomed to it
Work

[Hook]
Where's the Merc, I thought you were mashing work
Ping ping I thought you were clapping thing
Where's the cash, I thought you was in the trap
And what's with all the front 'cause ain't nobody got your back
Got your back, got your back
Ain't nobody got your back
Ain't nobody got your back
Got your back, got your back
Ain't nobody got your back
So what's with all the front?
