[Hook: Luciana]
They told me you were trouble
But I never knew I'd feel like this
We're caught up in a struggle
Can't let you go
I can't let go of trouble
No, I never thought I'd feel like this
Isn't it ironic, you got me in your pocket
Break me down with a little kiss

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Highly reputable
Therefore I got a reputation
I can see them in your ear
I know what your friend's are saying
You're just tonight to him
He lives his life on the road
It's difficult now I am known
Why can't we get some time alone?
I ain't trying to sell you dreams
I just wanna sit and vibe
There's a lot of fellas hollering
I know you're sick of lines
I can't say I ain't the same
And I ain't into lies
But I know you'll figure that
I'm different if you give it time

[Pre-Hook: Professor Green]
Your friends told you I'm trouble
Yeah, I bet you've heard a lot about me
There's a lot about me
That you might've heard
So are you gonna listen
Or just take me as you find me?
Am I gonna get the chance
That I deserve?
Cause I deserve it
And I promise it's worth it
I'll work you out
Yeah, I'll work you out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
Look, we could sit and talk about
The way you heard I used to be
But I find it hard to see
How that relates to you and me
See it ain't about what I've got
Or what I get
It's not that I'm tight with dough
But time is all I wanna spend
And you ain't gotta tell me
That you ain't a groupie
I know you ain't talking to me
Cause of my fame or jewellery
I used to play games
But I put the pad down
I was a boy then
I'm a man now

[Pre-Hook]
Friends told you I'm trouble
Yeah I bet you've heard a lot about me
There's a lot about me that you might've heard
So are you gonna listen or just take me as you find me
Am I gonna get the chance that I deserve
Cause I deserve it
And I promise it's worth it
I'll work you out
(Yeah, I'll work you out) yeah, I'll work you out

[Hook]

[Bridge: Professor Green]
Yeah I deserve it
I promise it's worth it
I'll work you out
Yeah, I'll work you out
Yeah I deserve it
You know it's worth it
I'll work you out
We can work it out

[Hook]
