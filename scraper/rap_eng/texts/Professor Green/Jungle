[Intro Maverick Sabre]
I see no point in living life that right
So I just take what I can find
I see no point in living life that right

[Hook: Professor Green & Maverick Sabre]
When you're out here in this jungle
It's wild round here, you don't wanna spend a night round here
When you're out here in this jungle
Ain't nothing nice around here
Trouble's what you find around here
When you're out here in this jungle (in this jungle)
You're always caught in this struggle (in this jungle)
But you keep asking for trouble
You love, you love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way

[Verse 1 Professor Green]
Welcome to Hackney
A place where I think somebody's been playing Jumanji
A Manor where men are like animals
And they'll yam on you like they yam on food
Cats with claws that'll stab a youth, act bad and catch a slap or two
We don't applaud success, all we clap are tools
London ain't cool to cruise through where the hunters prey
Looking to lunch today
And your chains looking like fresh fruit to a hungry ape
They'll eat on you, then laugh about it like Hyenas do
So stick to breezing through, like cheetahs do, or be a piece of food

[Hook: Professor Green & Maverick Sabre]
When you're out here in this jungle
It's wild round here, you don't wanna spend a night round here
When you're out here in this jungle
Ain't nothing nice around here
Trouble's what you find around here
When you're out here in this jungle (in this jungle)
You're always caught in this struggle, (in this jungle)
But you keep asking for trouble
You love, you love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
It's blitz amidst the strife here, got kids with sticks and knives here
It's hype here, we know no different prick;
It's just life here, life the way we know from young the way we're shown
Stacked trapped in flats where our front doors don't face the road
Got CID spinning round in cars, shifting criminals at large
It's hard, not to think the bits are just a bing without the bars
Jealousy's what the cheddar brings
For the cheddar it's anything goes
Low enough to rob newlyweds for their wedding ring

[Bridge: Maverick Sabre]
Every day is warring, never give a warning
Violence is the only way you settle things
Every day is hating, money that I'm making
Jealous cause I'm moving on to better things
Every day is fighting, rolling in the night now
All you do is watch everyone else get far, you say that life is hard
When you're out here in this jungle

[Hook: Professor Green & Maverick Sabre]
When you're out here in this jungle
It's wild round here, you don't wanna spend a night round here
When you're out here in this jungle
Ain't nothing nice around here
Trouble's what you find around here
When you're out here in this jungle (in this jungle)
You're always caught in this struggle, (in this jungle)
But you keep asking for trouble
You love, you love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way
