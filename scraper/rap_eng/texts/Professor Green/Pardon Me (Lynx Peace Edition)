[Verse 1: Ava Lily]
Excuse me if
I'm filling up your inbox with my messages
Every now and then I think I make a mess
I can't even try and keep control
The other night
Heaven knows I'm smashing things, I'm madder now
Falling in the wilderness, so wild now
I've been caught dying on your floor

[Chorus: Ava Lily]
Pardon me, but you said that you'd always love me
So how come you're tryna run from me?
Pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me
Pardon me, but you said you'd always talk to me
So how come you're keeping things from me?
Pardon me, pardon me

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
Ain't you done yet?
Ain't you sick of all the upset and all of the stress?
I'm sick of you being so suspicious
And of you looking at me like a suspect
I wish that we could go back in time
I wish that we'd never have met
Cause I'm sick I keep getting it in the neck
And you remind me of when I got shanked in mine
Long all the BS
Not really with of the stree-ess either
I'd rather have a dance in my Gucci loafers
Tell me to go but call me when I leave you
Sick of keep getting your messages
One minute you love me, one minute you hate me
Sure that there's somebody out there for you but it ain't me

[Chorus: Ava Lily]

[Bridge: Laura Mvula]
Tomorrow's another day
You can find love again
Remember how you felt before
The only thing worth fighting for
Tomorrow's another day
You can find love again
Remember how you felt before
The only thing worth fighting for

[Chorus: Ava Lily]
