[Verse 1: Professor Green]
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
I'm a liar, my pants are on fire
So is my hair, yeah this new hair style
Takes so much much fucking hairspray that if anybody
Gets anywhere near me with a lighter
Up in flames, red carpet in a suit
Next minute a fitted red cap and a couple of chains
Look what I've done for the game
It all popped off, now they're telling me I'm pop
I just got started, they're telling me to stop
Fuck what they're telling me
I got papers cuz, I'm a pedigree
Bygones are bygones, brudda better let it be
Otherwise leg it when you see the Rottweiler
Scheiße, now you're a munch in the eyes of a dog
I feel like Jay, they must need a reminder
I don't know why, man, it's like they forgot
I know I said I was a liar but
I was lying, a liar I'm not
What about all of the green and white I shot?
I might keep my eyes on the prize
But I still keep my eyes on the price of a box
I'm a tyrant, like it or not
And I still got a bag of man around me
That are gonna ride whether they got a license or not
They might act like they're hot for my name
But trust, they ain't ever gonna try for my spot

[Chorus: Kay Willz]
We ah gon' bun the place down down
Rudeboy, fire up, fire up, flame on
Turn it up loud, loud
Rudegirl light 'em up, we running London town
We'll raise the underground
Nah fool, you ain't fucking with a Rascal

[Verse 2: Shizz]
Kill off
Off your CD case I'll bill off
This time last year you was cold
But now you're old and dead and fell off
You know me, bro
White kid with a boasy flow
I will tell man once
I will raise hell If it's hell man want
And my name rings bells
When I'm here, my don
My don, you can't pull 'em off
Can't run with the style, you ain't cool enough
Loud ras, they think that I talk a lot
Underground scene, I'll leave it cornered off
I'm totally hot, hot, you're not, not
E3 L-O-N, we bop, bop
Eyes locked when I bop to the shop
Cause I'm a real don, ain't costing a lot

[Chorus: Kay Willz]
We ah gon' bun the place down down
Rudeboy, fire up, fire up, flame on
Turn it up loud, loud
Rudegirl light 'em up, we running London town
We'll raise the underground
Nah fool, you ain't fucking with a Rascal

[Verse 3: Tempz]
Hell living
And nah, it won't change and no, you cannot relate
Cah my world's different, and new day, a new wave
And these fakes wanna hop on my page cah it's well written
Yeah, basic, no help given
Yeah that ape shit but it smells different
You know what it is, me and Scribz up in Hell's Kitchen
And we’re cooking up, with food for thought and plates to serve
Stir it up, mixing flames with words
And you fools best duck, when it sprays, it burns
'Cause when I take a track, it’s a wrap like a parcel
You might get lapped on a track in going past all
Can’t be touched, can’t fuck with a rascal

[Chorus: Kay Willz]
We ah gon' bun the place down down
Rudeboy, fire up, fire up, flame on
Turn it up loud, loud
Rudegirl light 'em up, we running London town
We'll raise the underground
Nah fool, you ain't fucking with a Rascal

[Verse 4: Merkz]
Living that real life
Real guy with a ill mind
My cup, fill mine
A$AP, trill life
Drinking up
Whatever’s in my cup
And we live it up
'Cause it feels right
Rip him up
If he’s spitting tough
We’ll fuck him up
'Cause we kill guys
Physically or mentally
We run the game, fuck a referee
Class 90 till the death of me
And I ain’t got energy
To think about my enemies
Especially when all they have for me is jealousy
But you can hate while I’m raising that temperature
We be putting in work while you're resting up

[Chorus: Kay Willz]
We ah gon' bun the place down down
Rudeboy, fire up, fire up, flame on
Turn it up loud, loud
Rudegirl light 'em up, we running London town
We'll raise the underground
Nah fool, you ain't fucking with a Rascal
