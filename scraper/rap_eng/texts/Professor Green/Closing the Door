[Verse 1: Professor Green]
I don't mean to be ungrateful
And I could never tell you something if it ain't true
I'm stable and I find it's easier for me
Being single than it is being faithful
I guess I'm where I gotta be and I can't take you
And you deserve more so why would you make do?
I ain't no angel, and there ain't nothing you can say to me
To save us cause it ain't you
I hold onto everything we went to
I'll always remember what you meant to me
Now there's business I've got to attend to
Money for nothing and the drinks are free
Where I'm going, there's no place for
All the little things we kinda got a taste for
But you know, there's a lot I'm gonna miss
There ain't a page long enough for me to write a list

[Hook: Fink]
Is this as good as it gets?
Is this situation gonna turn into one of life's regrets?
Is this as good as it gets?
Is this situation gonna turn into one of life's regrets?
This is how it goes
Everything around me's so full of possibles
Close the door behind me, start thinking bout what's in front of me
Ooh

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I don't mean to be ungrateful
And I could never tell you something if it ain't true
I'm stable and I find it's easier for me
Being single than it is being faithful
I'm not alone cause I know you've got needs too
And from a distance it's nothing I'd concede to
I'd rather leave you than insult you with the lies
Cause I'm really not as sly as to deceive you
Time for us both is so precious
But selfish is never what I meant to be
A business where sin is relentless
And nobody sees nothing in the VIP
I don't know if it's a place I was meant for
Or if it's everything I always ever dreamt for
But I know there's a lot I'm gonna miss
There ain't a page long enough for me to write a list

[Hook: Fink]

[Outro: Professor Green]
Only time will tell if I'm doing the right thing
See, honesty's all about the timing
It's frightening but I'm tryna make it easier for you
By closing the door behind me
