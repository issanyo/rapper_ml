[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
(Oh-oh-oh)
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye, now our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Wish that I took more photographs of us (Oh-oh-oh)
Wish that I took more photographs of us (Oh-oh-oh)
Wish that I took more photographs of us

[Verse: Professor Green]
I just wish there were more of them
We all thought we'd live forever
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
What about the moments that we forget?
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
(Oh-oh-oh)
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye, now our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough (Oh)
Wish that I took more photographs of us (Oh)
(Oh)
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye, now our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
Wish that I took more photographs of us

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, wish that, oh-oh-oh, wish that)
(Oh-oh-oh, wish that, oh-oh-oh, wish that)
(Oh-oh-oh, wish that, oh-oh-oh, wish that)
(Oh-oh-oh, wish that, oh-oh-oh, wish that)
(I wish that, I wish that, I wish that, I wish that)
Wish that I took more photographs of us
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Verse: Professor Green]
I just wish there were more of them
We all thought we'd live forever
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
What about the moments that we forget?
