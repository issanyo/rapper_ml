[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Are you ready for the revolution?
My elocution is execution, I am electrocuting
What the hell I'm doing? I've no idea
But catch a whiff of my fingers and you can still smell Susan
Mouth like ashtray, breath stinking a liquor
Pocket full of change in yesterdays get up
The same jeans I had on the day before last
I guess I'm rap's George Best with a lot more cess
That's a little more liqour and a lot more sex

[Hook: Labrinth]
Sometimes we take it to far
Knocked out sick on my guitar
And I hear them say oh my God
Say oh my God, say oh my God
Lay my head down on the bar
Cause whisky never tastes so good
When I hear them say oh my God
Say oh my God, say oh my God

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
The first toke on the piggy made me shiver
Sip a, K, while picking at yesterday's dinner, plate
The way I say things it figures I'm paid
Slicker when I think say, spitters made victims a they
If your insane and wanna get in my way pic a
Day when you wanna get hit with a rake
Mr diss me not, I'm frisky, what?
Still itching to stick me cock in Pixie Lott
Just call me rap's George Best with a lot more cess
A little more liqour and a lot more sex, yes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
I do drugs cause I like the buzz
Go sleep and wake up feeling like I tried to fight a bus
A barely functioning alcoholic
Living life like a student with a popstar's wallet
Always smiling with my new teeth
Two E's, two pupils, two two P's
In a chemical romance and I'm loved up
The mascot for a generation full of fuck ups

[Bridge: Labrinth & Professor Green x2]
Don't be afraid, it's alright
Don't be afraid, it's all good
I'm in a daze
Always my yesterday's a blur

[Hook]
