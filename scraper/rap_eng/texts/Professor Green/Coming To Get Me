They're coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me

They're coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame that I've got
They're coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame but I'm not

From whatever his name is, Mr errr name is
To A list I'm on every playlist, how quick things changes
Man how quick it changes, ain't it
Who'd have thought that I'd be so famous
Definitely not me, but little old Prof be cockney's
Got lyrics so watch me I'm bad ya know
Mmmmmmm M.. M... M...M .. M ...M ... mad ya know
Matters not cause I'm the man here now
Nnnn... na na na ... got a couple fans here now
Then got a couple more
Before I got 'em I was sure it was what I wanted
But now it's poppin' I'm not so sure, cause I get spotted
Even when I'm popping out my door
Whats that mean?

My face is painted unlike I'd like it to be
But this is what I signed on the dotted line for
They ain't no way that I would want it to see
But things are getting a little out of control

They're coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me

They're coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame that I've got
They're coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame but I'm not

I'm frightened look at the tattoo's on my neck
How can I hide them, their ain't a disguise that works
I've tried them, aside for a turtle neck jumper
Which ain't exactly practical with summer I'm stuck
What can I do, I put myself in, I got myself in the stew
Got myself in the charts then got myself in the news
How long until they get a picture of myself in the nude, Ah
Cause now people wanna sell a story
It;s my life how can they tell it for me
I'm sorry I'm just trying to find a way to manage the stress
The thought of a kiss & tellers doing *into a mumble*
I can't even get impressed without worrying & getting about being paranoid
At a chick I date to say ... a quick to the tabloid ah
It's a lot different now it has happened
But even though I had it, when I'm smling
Believe I am annoyed cause ...

They're coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me

They're coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame that I've got
They've coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame but I'm not
