[Intro: Neon Hitch (Professor Green)]
Friends tell me I am crazy
That I’m wasting time with you
You’ll never be mine
(Just be good to me)
Just be good to me

[Verse 1: Professor Green (Neon Hitch)]
Huh, just be good to Green
All I need is a woman to be good to me
I'm an easy man, I’m easily pleased
And you provide me with everything that I need
Look, you know I make ends, I grind
So hold on to yours, we’re spending mine
Though you try, I never let you buy
But if I was broke, would you still be spending time? (Yes)
And I believe you would
Don’t think P’s too fucked to treat you good
I’ll walk street with you (Yes)
Talk deep with you (Yes)
Even sleep and spend all week with you
And I’m off
You wish I’d put an end to the torment
Stop, but one thing it’s not ever is boring
What would you rather me be that?
I ain’t ever gonna change; are you ever gonna to realize?

[Hook: Neon Hitch] (Professor Green)
People always talk about
(Look, people are always going to talk, babes)
Reputation
(I ain't even gonna lie, shit
But it ain't like you don't know what mine is)
I don’t care what you do to them (Nah?)
Just be good to me
(I’ll try, I’ll try, I’ll try)

[Verse 2: Professor Green (Neon Hitch)]
Look, babes, you know who I am
But as crooked as I am, I’ll be as good as I can
I can try and try, though it's evident
My angel face is disguise for the devil inside
You’re good to me; I ain’t good to girls, me
I’m a bad boy, something every good girl needs
Hey, honesty could avoid all your tantrums
But I’m a naughty boy and I always have been
What? And that ain’t changing anytime soon
I can’t have you with me whenever I move
Whatever I do, I come back to you
See, the good attracts me and the crook attracts you (Whatever)
What? We all got our ways, remember us talking
Of course it was game
But it’s all gonna change. Now she got me cutting off links
Like I’m trying to shorten my chain

Friends are always telling me
You’re a user
(Not me, not ever; ain’t no other man gonna treat you better)
I don’t care what you do to them (Nah?)
Just be good to me
(I’ll try, I’ll try, I’ll try)

[Coda: Neon Hitch (Professor Green)]
I’ll be good to you, you’ll be good to me
We can be together, be together (just be good to me)
I’ll be good to you, you’ll be good to me
We can be together, be together (just be good to me)

I don’t care what you do to them
Just be good to me
Just be good to me
