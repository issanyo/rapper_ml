[Verse]
Who's saying names?
Who thinks they're fucking clever?
You ain't a bloke, you're a bird
And I'm back to ruffle feathers
They call me the professor
Though I never got a degree
But right now, anything's possible
Leicester were top of the league
I'm having a party, like Jamie Vardy
I'm celebrating too
Cause somebody gave me an E
Why would I break it in two?
I don't do things by halves
A whole E is as holy as I get
Take care of you and your dargs
What you know about me? I'm a vet
I can kill, I don't play, I rap skilled
I quit rap and then I got a tax bill
Heap up, better speed up
Speak on it, better speak up
Don't worry about what I'm lean off
Or pee'd off cause I'm P'd up
Pigs took away my license
You see all that laughter? Dead it
Cause last July, when I got a new whip
Parked it outside the police station
Waited till I seen that pig and then revved it
Commotion, I'm bursting
Somebody hand me a little potion
What's the motion [?], feel a lot of demotion
Feel a lot of emotion
I'm emotive
Anybody saying they're the boss has since been demoted
What? Demotion
Look, it's hard out here in these times
These guys have got no hope
Their flow's coke, it's been stepped on
Like three times, they've got weak lines
Dead lines, they've got no shots
These shots at me? I mean, these swines
I grew up in E5
Where you hear shots and then police sirens
Your girl's a groupie, blud
I see her preeing me
Your life's a movie, but
It went straight to DVD
I'm still the pro, bro
I'm still a fiend
So who's got all the pills?
Somebody spill the beans
Blimey, I'm grimy
The way I'm rhyming just might be
The reason all of these hot spices
Wanna season my meat
It's all about the timing
Don't watch mine
Just went and copped a new watch
To make up for lost time
I've got a new watch, it's a Hublot
Or is it Hublot? Fuck it, who knows
I'm lying anyway, it's an AP
Don't make me get old school, put on my AP
Big up Time, big up AP
Virgin ain't the label that pays me
Virgin ain't the label that pays me
Virgin ain't the label-
Back in it, give me the jab like a vaccine and
Sit back and relax a bit
As I strap you in and inject the vaccination
You ain't ever gonna rap dissing
Keep practising
You never know, it might pay off
If you see Jammz or Ethan
Know that it's day dot
Badboys from day, from day, no, day
Army? Are you barmy
You'll need an army to harm me
PG, but I yell out "cunt"
On live TV like Harvey
"Hello, you cunt"
I said hello, you cunt, not Ella, you cunt
But Ella's a cunt
You can tell I'm a cunt, one hell of a cunt
Cause I tend to get ahead of myself
So full of shit, I need an enema
I would rather listen to Enya
Than any of you on my stereo
Wickedest ting to come out of my area
It's Pro, dig a hole, I'll bury ya
Why in the world would I ever remarry her?
Marry her? I've got all these hoes in the Marriott
Give me that spliff and let me spark it
Boy, I ain't even started
I don't miss any exes
I'm always on the target
Scarlet in my glass
With a whip that'll make you car-sick
Footloose and fancy free
Yeah, I'm back on the market
A platinum artist
But I'll still shit on your carpet
Back on the market
Piss on your parade
Back on the market
Money can't buy you class
Back on the market
But it can buy you class A
Back on the market
