[Intro: Professor Green]
Yeah I'm-
Told her I was done with all the-
Uh, yeah I'm active
Went out and then came home with a-
Told her I was done with all the-
Then she found a-
Uh, mate

[Bridge: Professor Green]
I'm active
Went out and I came home with an actress
I told her I was done with all the madness
Then she found a (click) under my mattress
I'm active, I'm active, I'm-

[Hook: Dream Mclean]
Active, ooh
That back's got me doing backflips
I'm wavey, I'm Swayze, I'm Patrick
Tennis, tennis, tennis, tennis racket
I'm active, I'm active

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
I'm PG, I'm dead cool
Vodka and Red Bull
Superhero, Deadpool
Learn a lesson, boy, get schooled
Crush you out, I'll X you
Fuck you and my ex too
I ain't talking about my ex-wife
I'm unique, I'm special
I'm active
Tennis racket, racket, racket, racket, racket
Tell me, whose coat is that jacket?
And then tell me whose coke is that packet?
'Cause I'm active, I'm active
I'm active, I'm batshit
Crazy (I'm crazy)
Broke into a flat through a cat flap
Then took a shit in the catnip
I'm that sick, three birds
One rubber, Jimmy hat trick
And I'll be this way 'til I'm a geriatric
I'm active, I'm-

[Hook: Dream Mclean]
Active, ooh
That back's got me doing backflips
I'm wavey, I'm Swayze, I'm Patrick
Tennis, tennis, tennis, tennis racket
I'm active, I'm active

[Bridge: Professor Green]
I'm active
Went out and I came home with an actress
I told her I was done with all the madness
Then she found a (click) under my mattress
I'm active, I'm active, I'm-

[Verse 2: Dream Mclean]
Wow, Savagery
Andre Agassi
I'm on centre court like "racket, please
Can you give me the racket, please?"
Don't make me go John McEnroe
Kick down the door to your happy home
I'm back in this, I'm backing Pro'
Like Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole
Play a ball in
Yeah, your wifey's a whore, init
Relationship goals, I scored it
In the box, I'm onside
I'm off nut, I'm online, I'm on stuff
And at band camp this one time, I was active
Two girls in one night, I smacked it
I told her just let me wet the head like a baptist
Next thing you know, woosh, Atlantis
I'm active, I'm active, I'm-

[Bridge: Professor Green]
I'm active
Went out and I came home with an actress
I told her I was done with all the madness
Then she found a (click) under my mattress
I'm active, I'm active, I'm-

[Hook: Dream Mclean]
Active, ooh
That back's got me doing backflips
I'm wavey, I'm Swayze, I'm Patrick
Tennis, tennis, tennis, tennis racket
I'm active, I'm active, I'm-
