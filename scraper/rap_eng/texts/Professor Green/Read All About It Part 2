[Chorus: Fink]
Sing, shout
Scream 'til the words dry out
Put it in all of the papers
You can read all about it
Sing, shout
Scream 'til the words dry out
Put it in all of the papers
Read all about it

[Verse: Professor Green]
It's been a couple years since your eyes closed
I used to wanna know the answers, now I don't
I don't ever wanna be where you been, dad
I already see enough of you and me
Fright, what if I'd grown up to be just like you
But isn't that what all kids should aspire to?
Even for all of the shit I admired you
I could have drowned in a pillow while I cried to
All I ever wanted was a little time with you
But that's time I ain't ever gonna get now
How am I ever gonna get my head round this
When I get down the whole world's grey to me
There isn't anything that anyone can say to me
I couldn't care less what people make of me
What they never gave to me, they can never take from me

[Chorus: Fink]
Sing, shout
Scream 'til the words dry out
Put it in all of the papers
You can read all about it
Sing, shout
Scream 'til the words dry out
Put it in all of the papers
Read all about it
