[Verse 1]
I'm more than one person, lately two
I need someone to save me and save me too
A devil on my shoulder, an angel too
And I'm tryna figure out who I favour, who
Made me do the things you made me do?
Forever blaming you, I guess my favourite's you
The angel can take a pew for now, I'm cool for now
You ain't ever seen an adult so juvenile
Sicker than baby puke, dribbling days were cute
And I'm tryna take a lady home, maybe two
Though if you spill your drink on my shoes again
Darling, it's toys out of the pram, baby too
Getting a little waved and the club's getting boring
But I want to carry on till morning
Lady I'm bad, I should come with a warning
What's wrong with your engine? Done with the stalling, come on

[Hook 1]
I'm open to suggestion
Evolve without question
Won't be going to heaven
Without salvation or redemption
I need church
I need prayer
On my knees in the dirt looking up to the sky
Wondering if anyone's there
I need church
I need church
On my knees in the dirt looking up to the sky
Wondering if anyone's there, I need church

[Verse 2]
I know what I should and I should not do
But what I should do ain't always what I want to
If you're lucky, I'll let you have your wicked way with me
Come on baby, it would be rude not to
We were there chatting, it wasn't flirting, it was foreplay
She said she ain't really into music and hardly
Even listens to the top 40
Though she did say somebody should tell Danny O'Donoghue
To stick to the scripts, rap really isn't his fort√©
Um, Danny O'Donog-who-what?
I would rather listen to Rudebox
By Robbie Williams, that's a lie
I would rather not listen to either of these two knobs
Why don't we order a few shots?
Then in a few me and you hop
In a cab and go back to my flat
Where I can play you lots of my new tracks
Sex with me is safe baby, tamper-proof
And I'm a pro at pulling out, that's tamper-proof
I'm a mack and here's the proof, when she said her name was Honesty
I said I'm looking forward to tackling the truth

[Hook 2]
I'm open to suggestion
Evolve without question
Won't be going to heaven
Without salvation or redemption
Woke up in a bed next to a bird
And I hope I used protection
We all need a cure cause
We don't worry about prevention, I need church
I need church
I need church
On my knees in the dirt looking up to the sky
Wondering if anyone's there, I need church

[Outro]
Hello, welcome to the voice mail of me
You should know who I am if you're phoning my phone
Please do leave me a voice mail cause I don't check them
Please don't send me a text because then I have no excuse for not getting back to you
Bye

*beep*

Green, it's Robbie Williams

A, keep my name out of your mouth
B, why did you have to go and mention Rudebox? It was a pretty shitty time of my--
And C, C is fuck you Green!
