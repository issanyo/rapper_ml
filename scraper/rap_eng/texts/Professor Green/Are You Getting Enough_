[Hook: Miles Kane]
Are you getting enough?
Are you getting enough?
Are you getting enough?
Ahh yeah
Are you getting enough?
Are you getting enough?
Are you getting enough?
Ahh yeah

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
You want for it, feel for it
Rob for it, steal for it
Shot for it, deal for it
Pop for it, kill for it
Some are born with it, some are born without
Can hardly afford what they’re forking out
Time is money, talk is cheap
Money talks, what we talking about?
Piggishness edacity poverty born depravity
Gluttony over luxuries all ravenous voracity
Insanity avidity salacity lust
Anything I want I need for me to have it’s a must

[Bridge: Miles Kane]
You're draining my blood

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I shop therefore I am, I am therefore I shop
Until I drop, I will not stop
‘Til I cop everything I want
I spend money I ain't got
Anything I want I get
I buy what I want, period
I don't really mind if I'm in the red
Credit cards, debit cards, store cards, more cards
The poor pay while the rich are spending
It's all as is intended
Can you feel it heating up?
Can you feel the climate change?
In our eyes you see the hunger
All you feed’s a primal rage

[Hook: Miles Kane]

[Bridge: Miles Kane]
Keep on, keep on
Keep on chasing money
Keep on, keep on
Keep on chasing money
Keep on, keep on
Keep on chasing money
Keep on, keep on
Keep on chasing money

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
The mad man with his megaphone said we can only serve one master
We’re consumed by social evils and all what we lust after
Satisfaction ain't for sale, and we’re all going to Hell
But who were we supposed to hail to, when we don't know our father?

[Hook: Miles Kane]
