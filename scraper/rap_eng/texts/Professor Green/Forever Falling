[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Never needed a hand up, I did it all alone
With no dad to make a man of me, I did it on my own
A victim of condition, now I'm conditioned for the cold
Even though I know what's missing there's no filling this hole
Escaping a whole heap of problems
Isolating instead of facing
I always attract the women who think that I need saving
Even though I'm the only person I could put any faith in
Face it, I'm jaded and happily so
What would I have to hold it if I let all the anarchy go?
Can't take the praise, I just climb my patrol
Just know I better deal with hatred and handle it so

[Hook: Haydon]
My back's against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
And I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
See what I got in this world? That's how come
I can't sleep without popping a pill now
Felt it come back up but I'm still down
Just back to convincing myself that I'm ill now
See with me the stress manifests physically, still in me
Is this fear of happiness and it's killing me
I can't control it yet I worry about things that are out of my control and I'm folded
I ain't never letting this introvert out
In a lonely home that could have been but isn't our house
But I ain't in the mood to have any visitors round
So I hide away, my curtains have been drawn so long
I couldn't tell you if its night or day
So how I feel is the only way that I can hide the pain
People try and help but I shy away
A problem shared is a problem halved
But I care for you too much to make this problem ours
Who knows where this problem starts
Come on Stephen, get to manning up
Scared ain't something that I'm man enough to be
Or even you get to be, how am I meant to handle what I'm seeing?
They just found my daddy hanging from a tree

[Hook: Haydon]

[Bridge: Haydon]
Trying to find myself
I don't know where to go from here
Losing my strength
So save me again

[Hook: Haydon]

So save me again
