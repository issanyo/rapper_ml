[Verse 1: Bigz]
Uh oh, they say that Bigz on some next shit
I dress slick so the chicks wanna mess with
What I'm blessed with cause I'm on some jet shit
Fly, so I don't even bother with domestics
He's so grown and he's so frozen
So he rolls in the roley with the stones in
Only for the chosen, living the life
So we don't think of the price cause we're living it right
Yeah, and if we came to stunt
Then it's ros√© hoes, [?] for lunch
So we ain't the punks that you're used to, baby
So tell me how you want it, you could cruise through, baby
And you choose, maybe, choose the rags
Cause you're messing with a crew with some ruthless swag
Had your cutie Louboutins and Gucci bags
F the dudes that you used to have

[Hook: Bigz]
So we could do the hotel, motel, only if you won't tell
Maybe even Holiday Inn
They say that it ain't clicking if you got it
You ain't gotta switch the topic, if you want it you ain't gotta pretend
Do you like it when I do it like that?
(Uh huh, yeah I like it when you do it like that)
Uh huh, OK, so you can holla when there's no plans cause I'm on my grown man
Maybe we'll link up with a friend

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
I'm on my grown man shit, I'm responsible for me
See me? I don't owe man's shit
Grown man shit, not old man shit
But old enough to tell a younger "roll man's spliff"
See, baby, what you're dealing with's a big man
Even from a little nipper, always had a big plan
From Ps off bars to Ps on yards
Everything's upfront, no need for cards
You can't be dinging down my phone when man are gone
I need a partner, I ain't looking for a tag-along
I ain't into that madness
Me, I find independence attractive
And I can't have you in my business
But know that I get it, get it when I'm on my grind
So you be on your shit and I'll be on mine
But when I say that I'll be there, I'll be on time

[Hook: Bigz]
So we could do the hotel, motel, only if you won't tell
Maybe even Holiday Inn
They say that it ain't clicking if you got it

(Uh huh, yeah I like it when you do it like that)
Uh huh, OK, so you can holla when there's no plans cause I'm on my grown man

[Verse 3: Shalo]
Born 1991 but I'll teach you to drive in the fast lane
Keep aisle 55 in outfits they can't claim
Your baby daddy might be older, I'll flex much colder
Flitsy toy boy, Paul Smith older
If I call you over, can I take you out
Or we can hit the town or we can hit my pad
I'm living lavish, got you thinking 'bout marriage
Baby, I can feel the static, I know that we click
I'm on my grown up ish
Got you chilling with the people that I've grown up with
And at my mum's, you're one of the only ones I've shown up with
Different day, same stuff, different hotel, pick a place
Catch my bluff, I won't fail to amaze, you don't need to go to work, B
I'll double that wage, I'm in love with that shape
I'm in love with that face
Don't you feel the swagger?
Watch me kill this girl matter with a Louis V dagger

[Hook: Bigz]
