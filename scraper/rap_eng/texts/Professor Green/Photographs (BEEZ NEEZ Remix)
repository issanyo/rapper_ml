[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye now, our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
I wish that I took more photographs of us
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: BEEZ NEEZ]

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
I can't believe I left you feeling solo
I was just at Nan's going through old photos
And you ain't in many of them, you're barely in any of them
Three or four of 'em I wish you were in more of them
I just wish there were more of them
'Cause now all I got is memories
And I cry but that river's run dry
If only time was something money could buy

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye, now our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
Wish that I took more photographs of us

[Post-Chorus: BEEZ NEEZ]

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
We all thought we'd live forever
We all thought that the moments would last
But the moments don't last, the moments pass
And the only thing that lasts is the photograph
But what about the pictures we didn't take?
What about the moments that we forget?
What about the memories that we've lost?
That only leave you full of feelings and regret
