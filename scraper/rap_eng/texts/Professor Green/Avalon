[Verse 1: Professor Green]
It's time to even it up
I guess a round table weren't equal enough
You can't contain me with chains, I'm free and I run free
Any enemy is coming with me when I'm done
Whatever's asked of me I've performed
I rid through the rain into the eye of the storm
Still carrying the flame, I've the torch
Failure comes at a price I can't afford
Never been half-hearted, I put my all in
Forfeited all just to answer my calling
Wearing the scars of the wars that I fought in
Should've been heading for the stars but I'm falling

[Pre-Hook: Sierra Kusterbeck]
I have your sword and cape
If you need them, I'll be swimming in the lake
Oh baby, don't look down
Just take the crown

[Hook: Sierra Kusterbeck]
We'll be kings forever, ooh
Holding on together, ooh
Feeling so much better, ooh
When everything was wrong, and everything was gone, we ran to Avalon

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
Fought till I had no fight left, risked my death
Walked with conviction in everyone of my steps
My strengths water enough, to wash away any of the stains on my rep
Yeah, I fought off vultures, when against odds when I was short on soldiers
I asked not for my burden to be lightened but if I may have broader shoulders
So as I may carry the weight
All the doubt I had in me has been allayed
So from now till the day that I'm carried away
I will never walk around what stands in my way
Fuck if they ain't letting up, because neither will I
When I die from the ashes an eagle will rise
As long as my blade and my faith will keep me alive
Fear ain't something that you'll see in my eyes

[Hook: Sierra Kusterbeck]
We'll be kings forever, ooh
Holding on together, ooh
Feeling so much better, ooh
When everything was wrong, and everything was gone, we ran to Avalon
We ran to Avalon

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
I left competition out for the count, no abacus
Fought for the crown, thwart thy challengers
When my massacre was ordained I remained
And through pain forged my sword
I left competition out for the count, no abacus
Fought for the crown, thwart thy challengers
When my massacre was ordained I remained
And through pain forged my sword
My Excalibur

[Hook: Sierra Kusterbeck]
We'll be kings forever, ooh
Holding on together, ooh
Feeling so much better, ooh
When everything was wrong, and everything was gone...
We'll be kings forever, ooh
Holding on together, ooh
Feeling so much better, ooh
When everything was wrong, and everything was gone, we ran to Avalon
We ran to Avalon
We ran to Avalon

[Outro: Professor Green]
You know it's been said that
The damaged become dangerous because
We know we can survive
