[Hook]
You're there when I need you
You're always on cue
How can I leave you when I can count on you
You're there when I need you
You're always on cue
How can I leave you when I can count on you

[Verse 1]
I couldn't count the amount of times you stopped me from going out my mind
One of the things that I love you for, everyday it's like I love you more
I adore you and all the things you do for me right now it's rapping
But if I was trapping you would catch a cab with food for me
I wouldn't have you do it, that's what workers do
I do what works for me, you do what works for you (you)
[?] Face it we hard to miss
I know god played a part in it
See your face would be my parting wish I'd put a heart in it
Falling no safety net or harnesses
Being with me comes with its advantages
Show you things you've never seen before
Take you to places you've never been before
But you can't come with me on tour are you mad love?

[Hook x3]
You're there when I need you
You're always on cue (always)
How can I leave you when I can count on you
You're there when I need you
You're always on cue
(You stop my world from falling)
How can I leave you when I can count on you
(Easy like Sunday morning)


[Verse 2]
I hope I get to you what you've done for me
You're my number two, you're the one for me
Ineluctabley in touch with me
You ain't just a someone, you're that somebody
And that somebody, woah yeah I like that
Bite me and I bite back
Back late though I said I'd be right back
You still never question me about where I'm at (no)
Cause when I say I love you I mean it
And I know that you would cut off my... (no)
No messing around, no getting around
No building you up and then letting you down
Mickey and Mallory
I love it when you're mad at me
I hope one day you would...
I hope one day you would...
I can't say that in the song


[Hook & Outro]
You're there when I need you
You're always on cue
How can I leave you when I can count on you
You're there when I need you
You're always on cue
How can I leave you when I can count on you
You're there when I need you
You're always on cue
(You stop my world from falling)
How can I leave you when I can count on you
(Easy like Sunday morning)
You're there when I need you
You're always on cue
(You stop my world from falling down)
How can I leave you when I can count on you
