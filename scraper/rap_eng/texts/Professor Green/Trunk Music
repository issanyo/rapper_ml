[Verse 1]
Put in the power[?]
Pushing for mine
You can try and 8 ball me
[?]
Rappers talk alota shit but they don't wanna back it up
Because when it comes down to it they know they ain't bad enough[?]
[?]
The cockiest cockney from east
I'm a beast over beats
I eat up rappers
Get street - beat up rappers
I'm raw with the tightest flows
You got freestyles? I got 4 or 5 of those
Best of the best
I'm clever with words
[?]
They couldn't bet on my worst[?]
You're all jokers with punter rhymes
Your punches are [?]
I don't sound like Slim
[?]
I got signed by Mike but I don't sound like Him

[Hook]
I got the trunk shit
Play my CD and bump it
I'm PG and I run shit
How dare you run lips
And what how quick I run this
I'm not to be fucked with

[Verse 2]
I could be [?]
Charged off a knee[?]
I could still bury these rappers in half of a key[?]
Thats two bars[?]
Buddy your new sound weak[?]
I will succeed like a budgie with no teeth
My old bars make your new sound sound dated
In fact my old bars make you new sound ancient
So run and hide before you get mummified and wrapped up quick
Your man suck dick
You lick balls for a living
I lick 8 balls for a living
[?]
[?]
I'm cool because I live it
[?]
My cockney swagger could not be badder
For east and polite[?]
You could not be madder
From now til the day they lock me in the slammer
You know I bangers up[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don't think I don't need nothing
Dogs are your companions
Cats only come back when they need something
I'm a shopper I know what cash is
Keep notes in 10 folds elastic bandages[?]
Balls in my reefa[?]
Walking through the streets of East looking like I need to pull my jeans up
I'll be sagging my jeans in my 30's
I'm dirty I'll be bagging green till they hurl me [?]
Breath ingest [?]
Trying to breath for stress
[?]
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Dragging on a big spliff, I ain't high
A real man talk softly but be carries a big stick
Fuck life I'm getting a .9 to get you[?]
[?]
I'm going to where I'm trying to get to
High speed so you best move

[Hook]
