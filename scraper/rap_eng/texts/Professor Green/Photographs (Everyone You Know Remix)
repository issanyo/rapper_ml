[Intro: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye now, our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
Wish that I took more photographs of us

[Post-Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Wish that I took more photographs of us

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
We all thought we'd live forever
We all thought that the moments would last
But the moments don't last, the moments pass
And the only thing that lasts is the photograph
But what about the pictures we didn't take?
What about the moments that we forget?
What about the memories that we've lost?
That only leave you full of feelings and regret (Oh-oh-oh)
Over the people we neglected
And the time we took for granted (Oh-oh-oh)
When all you can do is close your eyes
And hope that the memories develop in the darkness (Oh-oh-oh)
Like photos do, I wish I had a time-machine and a photo-booth
I know to grow I've got to learn to let go (Oh-oh-oh)
But I just wish that I had something I could hold on to

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye, now our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
Wish that I took more photographs of us

[Post-Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Wish that I took more photographs of us

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
Wish that I took more photographs of us
Said goodbye, now our love's collecting dust
Just a memory of you is not enough
Wish that I took more photographs of us
