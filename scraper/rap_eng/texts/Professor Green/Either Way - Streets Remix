Yeah I feel better today
I think that it was just a phase
My whole outlook's changed
I've even stopped feelin' strange
I can understand why you was mad now
Why should you be the one who has to lose out
Just cuz I'm on one?
I said I'm always gonna have things going on
I feel so much better today
Chase the bad things away
I was glad I turned the corner man
Cuz I was sick of feelin' rough
I was getting paranoid about the silliest of stuff
I was at me wit's end pulling my hair out
I'd just about had enough
And all I needed was a hug and that little bit of love
I feel so much better today
I'll chase the bad things away
And I really do feel so much better
I really do feel so much better
And I've gotta find my phone to tell ya
Maybe even write you a love letter
Either way I've gotta tell ya
Either way I've gotta tell ya
I feel so much better today
I'll chase the bad things away
And yeah I really do feel better
And it almost don't feel right
So I'm gonna store this thought away for a bit
And I'm not saying it ain't gonna be hard at times
Cuz it's always your favourite top you bin
But think man it could have been your skin
And I think that we might just be OK
But what does it matter either way?
Cuz she's the one that's always there
Yeah she's the one that always cares
Yeah she's the one that always there
Cuz you're the one that always cares
I love ya
I've gotta find my phone to tell 'er
Ahh, maybe even write her a love letter
Ahh, either way I've gotta tell ya
Ahh, either way I've gotta tell ya
Ahh either way I've gotta tell ya
Ahh, either way I've gotta tell ya
Either way either way
Either way either way
Either way either way
Either way either way
