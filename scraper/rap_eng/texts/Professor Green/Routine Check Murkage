[Verse: Professor Green]
Why's my name green because I blaze the herb
Why are The Streets called The Streets when they came from the 'burbs
It's the kid you might've heard of him, rappers I've been burnin' em
And Mike when did a cockney ever come from Birmingham
Why even try to spit
Mike's rhymes are about as tight as Jordan's vagina is
I'm nice at this, rhymes I spit dozens
I was just wondering why the Mitchell Brothers are called brother when they're cousins
Look, it's not like I care but I swear the original Mitchell Brothers Phil and Grant come from Alberts Square
I don't get it what is it?
Why is a millionaire moaning about women
Mike dry your eyes and stop whingin'
And stop singing, stick to rap
Where's the gold rings come on mate I thought you were a chav
Feel free to answer back, if you're mad at me then my teeth are then just like your sexuality
