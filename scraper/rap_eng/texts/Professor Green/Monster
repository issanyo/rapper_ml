[Hook: Example]
I’ll give you anything you’ll ever need
And I’ll find a way to turn you into a monster
Me and you, we can rule the world cause no ones gonna mess with me, I’m a monster
I’ll give you anything you’ll ever need and I’ll find a way to turn you into a monster
Me and you we can rule the world cause no ones gonna fuck with me I’m a monster

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
Saw a chick walking with a big behind
Now I’m stalking my victim
I’m unrecognizable ’cause I’m in disguise
Into eyes and hers were green
Crept up behind but she turned and screamed
Everybody turned to see
I tried to run, tripped up and hurt my knee
I can’t believe that she got away
Think of all the love that we could of made that day
Jade, I really did mess it up
I ruined my only chance with a Sugababe
Now I’m a bit ticked off
Back to the flat, hat and kicks off
To relax with a glass of milk, apparently Pixie drinks Lotts?

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
No so so shit, not from me, not Pro
Not me, my flows so piff
Quasimodo with a dick bigger than both my legs
It looks like a pogo stick
Admitted I am a fruit loop
Frankenstein with a screw loose
In search of a new neck bolt
How long will this neck hold?
I’ll be fine with a needle and thread
A little Jack an I’m evil again, scheming again
Introduce me to anyone decent, I will find evil in them
Everybody’s PC, I don’t feel them
If I could I would kill them
Before I go I’d like to say thanks to Peter Andre for looking after my children

[Bridge: Professor Green]
There ain't a line I ain't took too far
To find me you ain't even gotta look hard
Don’t get it confused I’m a crook star
Pubert, I was born with a moustache
There ain't a line I ain't took too far
To find me you ain't even gotta look hard
Don’t get it confused I’m a crook star
Pubert, I was born with a moustache

You're a monster
You're a monster
You're a monster
You're a monster
You're a monster
You're a monster
I’m a monster!
I’m a monster!
I’m a monster!
I’m a monster!
I’m a monster!
I’m a monster!
