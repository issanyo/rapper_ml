[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I came up in this party, time to twerk
I came up in this party and I'm turnt
I came up in this party, time to twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Hey pretty girl, tell me your name
The way you moving girl, I'm happy you came
Girl, I've been looking for you for a while now
I would come and talk to you, but it's loud now
Girl, we can take it slow
Don't need nobody to know
Let me see you get out on the floor, girl
We gon' party all night until it's over

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I came up in this party, time to twerk
I came up in this party and I'm turnt
I came up in this party, time to twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I'll valet the car, throw me the keys
It's time to go, girl you're coming with me
Girl, I've been looking for you for a while now
I would come and talk to you, but it's loud now
Girl, we can take it slow
Don't need nobody to know
Let me see you get out on the floor, girl
We gon' party all night until it's over

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I came up in this party, time to twerk
I came up in this party and I'm turnt
I came up in this party, time to twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, girl, I can't believe what you do to me
Got a feeling that I'm running out of time
And I really hope that you come closer
Closer, closer, closer, closer

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I came up in this party, time to twerk
I came up in this party and I'm turnt
I came up in this party, time to twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
