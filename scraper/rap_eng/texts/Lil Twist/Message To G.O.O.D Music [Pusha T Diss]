You know I'on give a fuck (no, bitch)
You know I dun give two fucks

Hook:
You know I dun give a fuck, In this Bentley truck
Better put them bitches up, we quick to pick em up
Know my niggas leave a mess we ain't with the famous stuff
And we keep the semi tucked that's the quick-to-pick-her-up
Make me swingin' in the demon got to put the hammers up
Shooting in the whip and text the boss the b'ness done
If the nigga still breathin' spin it back and finish him
Trappin' in the hood we trappin' out the renaissance
Wrap the birds and let em fly them bitches bring back ten a month

Verse 1:
Strap a nigga to the bag time is tickin' ticking bomb
Find his mom find his son I swear to God job is done
Trick a nigga like John Lennon say that till the cops come (Ugh)
Pushin' me ain't no fuckin' pushin' me
We take a nigga to the cliff and push em off Pusha T
Who's he? shit I heard 'bout where you chill
Shit I heard 'bout where you live
And now you heard is how I'll run all off in a nigga crib
Nah for real you niggas weak G.O.O.D music need to chill
'For I show em what's real Ice Cube, Cypress Hill
Mike Tyson, Holyfield, Sin City, Kill Bill
Pourin' cups, poppin' pills and still...

Verse 2:
Bitches bring back twelve a month, light a blunt then light him up
Bad bitch invite her up she chilling with the higher ups
Twizzy F and the 'F' is for frequent flyer Uh huh
Young Hot boy to the fucking third degree
It ain't no fucking serving me I swear the block is courtesy
Get that clear clarities, stuffing packs and cherokees
Ice cream paint job oreo McFlurry seeds
Cashing out signing deals a couple mills a couple bills
A couple houses on the hills a couple pints a couple seals
A couple steels got this niggas running drills getting chills
Pouring cups and popping pills and still...
