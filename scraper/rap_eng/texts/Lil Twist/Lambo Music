Id Be Riding With The Top Back When I Cruise Through
Fly Whips I Ain't In Unless She Brand New
Lil Trips Vacating Out The Cancun
Spend The Weekend Let Your Girl Get A Tattoo
Top Back When I Cruise Through
Fly Whips I Ain't In It Unless She Brand New
Lil Trips Vacating Out The Cancun
Spend The Weekend Let Your Girl Get A Tattoo

[Bridge - Lil Twist]
Gets Me One Bad Chick And A Lambo To Get Me Right
This The Life Now Tell Me What You Feeling Like
Lean And Drop A Cruise Under The City Lights
So They Can Watch And Wonder How We Living Life
Hopping Out The Lambo Door
Fresh Out The Showroom Floor
So Take Your Homegirl Say Alavie
And It's Our Own YMCMB

[Verse 1 - Lil Twist]
Rolling Through Dallas Streets
I'm Jamming Lambo Music With My Top Down In A Recliner Seat
Going Fast Over 200 Is Where You See Me Like
Going Fast Like A Motorbike Iight
And When I Shop I'm The Demon Type
Catch You Over There You Crotching From A to B
This Lambo Gets Me Everywhere and Where I Be You'll Never Dash
So I Never Care About The Speed Limit They Can Tell When He In It
More Hot Shawty And Shawty That's Me In It
I Say This Is A Lambo You're Supposed To Speed In It
Ha! Now Get Your Miles Up
I'm A Whiz Kid High Tech You Just A Dial Up
Now Put Your Coin In I'm About To Lamb [?]
Yea I'm In The Booth Ballin Feeling like Jordan
Yea His Prime 23 His Bulls Are In

[Bridge - Lil Twist]

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
Buckle Up Let's Max Out At The Clipboard
Runway Running In This Lamb Dear Lord
Make Sure I'm Good But I'm Bout To Run It Into The Ground
Homie Check Under The Hood
V12 Baby Where Did You Look
V12 Ready To See
I Put That On Me
V12 Baby Where Did You Look
Even V12 Under The G Screen Gs
I'm Getting Teased Like I'm Supposed To
Grinding Girls Hanging Me on They Posters
Bullets For Each Bars Packing Guns With Holsters
But Asking if I Got Bread I Got Loafers
Bringing Stacks To Disnetland With No Chauffers
It's Me And You Baby Here To Takeover
Weezy Told Me When I Wasd Younger Money Was The Motive
I Get Alot Of That Now Girl Look
