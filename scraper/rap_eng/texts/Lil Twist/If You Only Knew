Walking on this journey of love and this road just goes on
And I'mma hold on, hold on

And girl I know we're young
But baby I know what you want
And with this love we can't go wrong
Just wake up your love is right here
And I'm done just living in fear you gotta know that I'm right

And my mind is made up my heart is right here
I'll never give to your love unless I'm gonna find

She said I never ever planned on letting go
Matter fact I think I'm ready boo as far as marriage go
I say I know I'm still young but I'm really thinking so shit
All I know was I never gotta this feeling once before
And yo you make me feel different girl when I'm around ya
First day meeting you I crowned ya
I'm calling too fast, trying not to harass
But I'mma make sure I'm better than your last
Put his ass in the past and yeah
