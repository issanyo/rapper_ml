[Intro: Irv Gotti]
Let's talk about it, let's talk about it for one second
Shouldn't that had been in a real world, the death blow?
The guy who's proclaiming to be the roughest, toughest don dava, bully
You got beat up and spoked up and you ran to the precinct and press charges on us
And you took on all the protection
That's like your baby mama does
And you say, "I smell pussy," it's you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Paperwork, haha
All these niggas signin' paperwork, pussy
You gon' make us put you on a shirt, pussy
All these niggas signin' paperwork, pussy, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Put your bread up
I wanna take that fade
I don't gotta fuck your hoe
I'ma just take your chain
Bitch, I'm fed up
Fuck yo' set you claim
Pull up right now
Pussy nigga, let's do this thing
Y'all niggas ain't bangers
Y'all niggas ain't players
You don't do no favors
Y'all niggas ain't gangsters
Y'all niggas just betas
Y'all niggas ain't alpha's
Keep throwin' up fingers
Make you eat one of them fingers
Gon' doubt us
Shit be brazy
Shit be wild, wild
None of y'all tellin' the truth, damn
I see the bitch all in you, bang
You better be ready to shoot, yeah
Or better be ready to move, damn
Jarheads with the warhead
Wakin' you up from my mini van
Yeah, yeah, I'ma make bail
A pussy nigga, you about to tell

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Paperwork, haha
All these niggas signin' paperwork, pussy
You gon' make us put you on a shirt, pussy
All these niggas signin' paperwork, pussy, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
Mula, alright
Niggas snitchin', niggas bitchin'
Niggas snakin', niggas hissin'
That's how pussys end up missin'
Oh, did I forget to mention?
I was 14 on this mission
I was 16 with extended clips
Smith & Wesson wouldn't grip
Pistol on me, hollow tips
Kill a nigga, no attempt
Shoot a nigga in the head
Dye his tips, let it drip
Put his body in a box
Ship it out from the Fifth
Mail that shit to his Momma
Or his Pops as a gift, yeah
Niggas be rattin' on me (Yeah)
Niggas be tellin' on me (Pussy)
Niggas be gangster, tell him he gangster
Now I'm a failin' homie (Huh)
I hit the gang from Tunechi (Yeah)
I be from mailin' homie, quit
I done laid the work
And I don't do paper work, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pussy, haha
All these niggas signin' paperwork, pussy
You gon' make us put you on a shirt, pussy
All these niggas signin' paperwork, pussy, yeah
