(Chorus)
[Lil Twist & T-Pain]
What's left?, What's right?
I fall in love with you for one night
You a bad bitch, my type
You be on them shit that I like
Wanna get right? (x7)
Oh yes!

[Verse 1]
Been up in this bitch kinda late
Came up all alone but I'm leaving with a date
Seen something looking like my soul mate
Said what it do? there's no need to hesitate
From the club to the crib by the lake
I can hear you better there its too noisy up in here
And I'm turnt up hope you can relate
Just wanna do the most leave a smile up on your face yeah
Show you what your body missing
We don't need no intermission
Keep it coming is my only mission
Baby listen, listen
Let me take away the tension
With a whole lot of love attention
Burn it up like we in the kitchen
Did I mention?

(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
Now lady can I get a taste?
With the top down get it sticky like paste
Don't wanna seem like I'm in a race
Just want to kill the pussy dead let murder be the case
Run it back double up like Mase
I'm in it for the thrill, I ain't in it for the chase
Let your breath try to keep up with my pace
Got to put the glove on I ain't tryna leave a chase lord,nah
Show you what your body missing
We don't need no intermission
Keep it coming is my only mission
Baby listen, listen
Let me take away the tension
With a whole lot of love attention
Burn it up like we in the kitchen
Did I mention?

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
We could take it to the studio
Singing on my mic, turn up the level
Then we could make a music video,video
But you gotta let the big get a cameo
Huh, yeah pull that string to the side
Call me impatient I ain't waiting tonight
Take advantage of me I ain't putting up a fight
Then we could smoke a blunt girl I know you gotta like

(Chorus)
