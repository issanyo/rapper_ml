( chorus )
She got me patiently waiting always thinking for her love
And i've been meaning to tell ya ' girl how I feel bout us
So let me take the time , so speak my mind because I wrote this
Song for you ( wrote this song for you )
And baby I know ; you ain't use to me but
I can be the man you need , you know it to ; that's why I wrote
This song foryou ( wrote this song for you )

LIL TWIST:
Yeaah , I wrote this song for yous ' ah , don't worry bout them
Other losers ' I would neva use ya . Think enough like a zombie
Baby I would neva sculze ya and no need for a lost and found
Cause I would neva lose ya . If I had ya I would grab ya ;
Every part of me is an example , so I sat back and thought
That I would give you a sample of " TWIST " I mean " CHRIS "
That's who you needa know ; and when I see ya on stage girl
You like the walking float . welcome to the twista show , I swear it's
Not straight to go , and I hope that one year block game nothin
To my pick and roll . so I picked and rolled , now girl lets go ;
On to the next thing , our love is rolled up , let's go

( chorus )
She got me patiently waiting always thinking for her love
And i've been meaning to tell ya ' girl how I feel bout us
So let me take the time , so speak my mind because I wrote this
Song for you ( wrote this song for you )
And baby I know ; you ain't use to me but
I can be the man you need , you know it to ; that's why I wrote
This song foryou ( wrote this song for you )

T-REAL:
Make a minds , tell and tale . keep on driving I might as well
I don't get down like man oh well , if time will fail ; then
Time will sail ; Lil ' mama bad and all , mama sad and all
How ya acting yall yeah , if she blow me off then i'll play it
Off say nothing ever happend yall

- cause when I see ya pretty face , don't give up all ready
I be like oh no baby I should though , and I'm trying not to dance
I see the way you lookn at me ; man I hope so , saying damn
I want her . yeaaah

And we can ball in any way you want to , the other side
Feels good don't it and you know that it's true , that's why
I wrote this song for you
