[Intro: Lil Twist]
Youngin'

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
Mango fanta [?] foreign
Pineapple fanta turned orange
Double cup shawty got me snoring
And you know my motherfucking [?] name, Jason Bourne
All these other lil niggas so boring
They like "Twizzy, where you been? Go show em"
I tell em Motherfuckers I been in a foreign
And ain't no telling where I'm going

[Chorus: Lil Twist]
I'm in a foreign
And ain't no telling where I'm going
I'm putting on
In a drop top Bently all alone
Im in the zone
Shift the packs with a motherfucking Drone
I'm putting on
Like gates nigga got two phones

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
Benz back out
Drugs and everything out in the back house
Nigga tied down
Guns in the back pull a mack out
Shift the size [?] fucking lil Bow wow
You don't wanna see a nigga pull his shack out
Before somebody getting packed out
We stomp a nigga like came up in a frat house
Huh, Click clack nigga Pow Pow
I done turned into a wow child (Twizzy)
All these bitches want hand-outs
And all these nigga want shout-outs
Take your bitch and blow her back out
Got the hoe bout to tap out
Pulling up to the trap house
Big Phantoms no Lex out

[Chorus: Lil Twist]
I'm in a foreign
And ain't no telling where I'm going
I'm putting on
In a drop top Bently all alone
I'm in the zone
Shift the packs with a motherfucking Drone
I'm putting on
Like gates nigga got two phones

[Verse 2: Mango Foo]
Hello
The plug keep calling on my phones (prrt prrt)
Bently GT got no dome (Skrt)
Dirty fanta, I don't do the Patron (Lean)
This bitches on a nigga like my ice be
Put your bitch in a Movie like I'm Spike Lee
I'm just [?]
I done made a 100,000 in this white Tee (hunnid thou)
VVS with the diamonds where your Ice Tea
And my rollie moonwalking just like how Mike be
I pull up with my steering wheel on the right seat
I don't play tennis but you know i keep the racks on me
Shoot like a soldier pull up my trunk here be by the motor
My diamonds colder, I mean Lil Yatchy, they Minnesotas
These bitches know it, they know we fucking no sleeping over
Your [?] is stolen I'm in a foreign, no with a chauffeur

[Chorus: Lil Twist]
I'm in a foreign
And ain't no telling where I'm going
I'm putting on
In a drop top Bently all alone
Im in the zone
Shift the packs with a motherfucking Drone
I'm putting on
Like gates nigga got two phones
