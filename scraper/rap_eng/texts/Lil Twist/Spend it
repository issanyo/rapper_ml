Spend that money make it all back
No discussion I need all that
Did me wrong had to fall back
Independent how we on that
Where you from yea we run there
Same one from the 1s yea
Diamonds shining like the sun yea
A lot can happen just in one year


Trey [verse}
Put in pain for a minute
Off the plane now I'm in it
You a lame you ain't winning
Call the gang pull up wit it
Said I put that on the map
I ain't never switch the motion
Tattoos on her ass bust a bag bust it open
All these bands on me I ain't never told lie
Told her dance her dance on me (yeah yeah)
I ain't worried rolling dirty police tripping
Who ya kidding, Young & Livin
Stack it all spend & spend it (yeah yeah)
Fly em over
Jewelry ice cold keep the lights low
Keep the lights low she can keep her eyes closed
Put that on the map I ain't never switch the motion
Tattoos on her ass bust a bag bust it open
(Oh No No)
Said I never meet anyone like you (Oh No No hey)
Wonder where you at can a n***a slide through

Shaq [Verse]
Uh
Fresh off the plane to meeting
Labels wanna talk agreements
Cold hearted like a anemick
We the wave in the deep end
You gotta pay dues just to make moves
You can't even get your feet in
Im in the stu every weekend
Kinda hard for me to sleep in
We the hottest in the region
Now they hating when they see him
I ain't change for no reason
I was stuck at the precent
Trynna figure what Id be then
E-white brought the beat in
I ain't hear for no sneak diss
Prezi on pledge of allegiance
Use to come through
When you Had that flat (name 1)
Name me one time I ain't have your back
See I'm getting rich now you want me back
Petite lil jawn  plus your ass getting fat
Night shift kept the lights on
Game day threw my ice on
Louboutins on python
Like I jumped out the right pond
All this money I done lost track
Spend it all get it all back
Kenan & Kel how we all that
At ya head like a ball cap
Pulling up in that all back
Difference is it be all facts
Got em wondering how them
Young boys they ain't never fall off yet


Spend that money make it all back
No discussion I need all that
Did me wrong had to fall back
Independent how we on that
Where you from yea we run there
Same ones from the 1s year

Lil Twist [Verse]
Well Alright
