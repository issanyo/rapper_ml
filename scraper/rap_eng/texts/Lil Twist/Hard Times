[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
Everytime I leave town, she want me back all the time
All we do is face time
She want me to make time
I swear, I really miss her
Wanna hold her and kiss her
But shit, I'm getting busy. The kid is only getting bigger
Sometimes, it's in the air. Do I do biz, or go be with her?
Take her on the town, show her the life of the lil sister
This YMCMB life is the life, it's a lil different
Iced up by the tiffany's and minc for when you're shivering
She thought I was some God the way this life is a giving
Oh yeah, we just imagine. I do the same with your sibling
Ha, I'm just joking. Just Kick back, zonin' and smoking
Reminiscing on the times our love was provoked and..
Lost. In the open. Fields, or in the ocean
Getting drowned, maybe drenched, or even soaking
Drained. Lose nothing but champagne and stomach pains
Raging dumb arguments through texts, and childish games
Oh my! I can't explain

[Hook: Lil Twist]
Seems like the same old thing
Everytime we talk about it, it's the same old game
Yeah you're gonna want me back. That's just same old same
I just hope I don't fall for it, I'mma end up staying
I'm just saying
It's the same old thing
Everytime we talk about it, it's the same old game
Yeah you're gonna want me back. That's just same old same
I just hope I don't fall for it, I'mma end up staying
I'm just saying

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
I hate the way you make me feel
Now I'm faded off these cups of Hennessy
You said you got a dude
So I drop another dose of medicine
Really trying not to show jealousy
But this shit that I'm on got me speaking
Out my mind and how I feel
And right now, it's not that. So baby I bounce back
To her crib, hit the door she answered that
Yeah I know about the date she had tonight, I canceled that
Told her I had a couple problems, now's the time to handle that
So baby, slowly take your clothes off, and where them candles at?
Ha. She tried to make me slow up. I mean halt
I'm talking hands up and all. Like shit's against the law. Maaan
Like shawty what's up with that?
She said, I told you, you was gonna want me back, huh?
You're gonna need me
Theres days you're gonna wanna see me
You got these hoes round the world wanna be me. But they can't be me
Then you up and leave me? I swear to God lil nigga, you mislead me
Guess you would've been better off cheating
And oh my, I can't explain!

[Closing: Lil Twist]
It's funny how the story flips sometimes, ya know?
Just gotta deal with it, I guess
I'm just saying. YMCMB. WildKidz
