[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I Wanna See You Wind It Wind It
Now Let Me Get It Behind It
I Can't Make You Popular Baby With No Timing
You Want The Lime Light, The Star Shining
Well Let Me Show You What I Mean When I Say I'm Grinding
Follow My Lead Do what Twist says so F Simon
Playing Touch Football Baby I Be Linesman
Hut Pitch That I Promise I Won't Miss That
But When I Throw It Off You Better Get That
Badda Bing I Gotta Hit That
Then I Get Back To The Hard Work I Was Doing Before It Paid Off
If I Do A Another Worldwide Tour
Maybe I Can Get A Couple Of These Days Off
Kick My J's Off
Relax In The Shade
Shades Off
Chilling with a dime on South Beach now stand up cause...
