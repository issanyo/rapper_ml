[Intro: Lil Chuckee]
Nothin' make a man feel better than his ladies (Cuz girl I got you)

[Hook: Lil' Chuckee & Lil' Twist]
I know I'm always gone and I'm hardly never home don't worry bout' Nothin. (Baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down I'mma buy you everything
You ain't gotta want for nothin (Cuz girl I got you)
Don't worry what your friends say cuz' they be hating anyway they mad when I tell ya (Baby girl I got you)
It's just me and you against the world baby girl
I know you got my back ( Cuz girl I got you)

[Verse 1: Lil' Twist]
As I was walking by I seen you standing there with a smile
Looking shy, caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang a while
I15 on the beat and I ain't cruising highways
So baby lets get away, save the troubles for another day
Jammin escapade in the lot with escalade on the back
Ya' homies wack I promise that
It ain't trickin if you got it
Might as well spend a stack
I hit the mall and ball down call me Young Steven Jackson
I'm the one, and I won with no games played
Never have to work in our life day we got it made
Every days a Vaca M.I.ami like Dade
And we ain't ever clean up cuz baby I got maids
Young money we so paid and if you ever get hurt baby I'm ya band-aid
While im lookin at you never worry bout nuthin (cuz girl I got you)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil' Chuckee]
Shawty, I'm here any time that you need me
Fasheezy
I'm here to make your life Easy
They say every good dude theres a good lady
And I have mine already ain't no need to keep lookin
And when I'm on the road you come to my house
And walk my bulldog,and help my moms out
And play wit my sister you know I love that
Thats why what ever you want I'mma cop that
Im Rashaad, you my NewNew
Im ya Will Smith,baby you my Jada Pooh
And when I'm in the studio you come chill with me
Play around wit my hair you keep me motivated
If we had a team id be Reggie Bush you'd be Kim Kardashian your bodies so amazing
And when im not with you I'm on my iPod
Bumpin forever my lady (I love ya)
