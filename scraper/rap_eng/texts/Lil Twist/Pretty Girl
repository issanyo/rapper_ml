[Verse 3: Lil Twist]
You the baddest chick I've ever seen
Oops pretty I mean, I'm kinda lean
I'm attracted to the older things like
Softball coaches and school deans
Drop right in school like what's up
Tell your nurse I need a touch up
Oops my bad, I mean a check up
And tell a dude gets his check up
It's Twizzy F and MB
With Walter and Carter in the front seat
I met shawty at the meet and greet
Now it's me and her
and nothing gets between
Our love
N-nothing sits above
Nah ay baby girl hold up
It's YMCMB and you can be the princess
Girl wassup?
