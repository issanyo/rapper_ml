[Chorus: Fooly Faime]
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Hop in the 'rari and swerve
Kick a broad bitch to the curb
I'm gettin' paid like the first
I'm with your bitch and she slurrin'
She suck on the dick 'til she burp
She suck on the dick 'til she burp
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
Mansion house, trappin' out
Cashin' out, Twizzy baby, blackin' out
Actin' out, gas is out
Runnin' in, masses down, ammo round
Hoes in shirts, hand me downs
Young Carter, need no brown
Need no brown? Yeah
Take a moment for the nino brown
Play smart ass pussies to your cap and gown
Like ooh, you must got that nerve
Double cup, full of dat syrup
I come up under Lil Tunechi
Had to let loose of dat bird
Had to let loose of the Xannies
Couldn't let loose of the Perc's, no
We hit your block and disturb
Run juice all over your turf

[Chorus: Fooly Faime]
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Hop in the 'rari and swerve
Kick a broad bitch to the curb
I'm gettin' paid like the first
I'm with your bitch and she slurrin'
She suck on the dick 'til she burp
She suck on the dick 'til she burp
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Pl-pl-plan it out, ran ‘em out
Standin’ out, stand ‘em down
Candles out, airin' it out
Man is down and they found his family down
Just layin' around, layin' ‘em down
They stand around, I'm tearin' it down
I'm tatted up, I'm Xannied down
I'm Addy’d up, I'm addin’ up
My ante up, now pat ‘em down
He good, he get coke and a smile
I panned around, we safe and sound
We ate some clowns, we take 'em down
We take they child out, made the style
It takes a while to break it down
I break it down and make my rounds
The label down but I ain't down
They fakin' files, they break their vows
I'm makin' magic, say Ta-da and
Make it happen and all I gotta say to that shit
Is fuck you all day like rabbits, nigga
You, you must got the nerve
Tune gon' get on your nerves
Ooh, you must got the curse
Ooh, you must got the hearse
Ooh, you must got the box
Ooh, we cut off your arms
Ooh, you can't even box
Wings that can't even flock
You remind me of slop
Ooh, she not even hot
And Twizzy F. yeah, that my son
And his siblings are all the habits I adopt
I just tell her let one stop
You came through, who the fuck, the fuck is wearin' flip flops?
Buy his whole backpack every time I shop
We been seein' eye to eye for years, whose Cyclops?
I'm sayin'
Ooh, you must got the nerve
I am so tired of you lil' bitches
Boy, I am so proud of my lil' bitches
Boy, money talks, I know that shit by his voice
Ooh, you must got that work
Ooh, you must got them birds
Ooh, we might got the work
Ooh, we about to purge!

[Chorus: Fooly Faime & Lil Wayne]
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve (mula)
Hop in the 'rari and swerve
Kick a broad bitch to the curb
I'm gettin' paid like the first
I'm with your bitch and she slurrin'
She suck on the dick 'til she burp
She suck on the dick 'til she burp
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, you must got the curse
Ooh, I must have got first
Ooh, you musta got third
Ooh, you must got the nerve
Ooh, we must got the work

That's for sure, that's for sure
And two white cups, that's for sure

That's for sure, that's for sure
