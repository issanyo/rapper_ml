Scorp Diesel on the track

[Verse:]
Youngin', Young Carter
Well, I'm goin' crazy (Wooo)
I'm goin' stupid, I'm goin' crazy (Wooo)
It's Twizzy Baby (Yeah)
Bitch, look what you made me
Look what you started, I go retarded (I do)
I kill a nigga off quickly regardless (Ugh)
This sound dearly departed (Twist)
Dearly departed, my mama's a gansta (Wooo)
Found her gun on the table (Wah)
I found drugs in the couch then I catered the neighbors (Wooo)
Then got cable from neighbors (Huh)
I hang with the greatest, I smoke with the skaters (Yeah)
And I take with the takers (Yeah)
The boy still on papers, still pop shit in Vegas (Huh)
Gettin' pussy from Asians (Yeah)
You get pussy for cheap, I get pussy for free
Talkin' off my conversations (Him)
Niggas they hate on the kid and it's off with they head
And I'm with amputations (Ugh)
Back to the basics, it's regulations
This MAC-11 it tasty
This MAC-11 got black on it handle
This MAC-11 is racist
This MAC-11 it face it
This MAC-11 a break shit
This MAC-11 don't take shit
This MAC-11 ain't with that little fake shit
This MAC-11 go apeshit
This MAC-11 do facelifts
This MAC-11 amazing
Make you put use to your ASICS (God damn)
Bullets start flyin' like The Matrix
Still doin' coke like the 80s (Hm)
