[Chorus: Mishon]
Girl that's new money right there
Yea that's new money right there, gonna see how crispy that feel
How good that looks, how good that smells
Soon as they make it, I get it
Soon as I get it, I spend it
Yea that's new money right there, yea that's new money right there

[Bridge: Mishon]
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh (New Money)
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh (New Money)
Oh Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh (Yea that's new money right there)

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
New money right here
This is Lil Twist and Mishon's year with no fear
Cause we eating them haters steady tweeting
Top of the game while them sucka's steady peakin'
So hush up, yea be quiet when I'm speakin'
Big money talk Twizzy F., the deacon preachin'
I'm just takin' off and from them suckas' that's leechin'
For instance I'm ballin', them other lil' suckas' is reachin'
Kinda foul, especially now that I'm what them other girls talk about
Especially now that I'm legal baby, I'm wildin' out
The young boss ballin' baby girl YM the scout
You wanna know if its clout? No doubt, count it out

[Chorus: Mishon]
Girl that's new money right there
Yea that's new money right there, gonna see how crispy that feel
How good that looks, how good that smells
Soon as they make it, I get it
Soon as I get it, I spend it
Yea that's new money right there, yea that's new money right there

[Post-Chorus: Mishon]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (New Money)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (New Money)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Yea that's new money right there)

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
This how money really feel
Never slowing down, none cash in on year
Bumpin and jukin, I rather have a bill
And me I'm just a chef tryna make another meal
Please hand it over, Young Money Soldier
Meditate on cash, Lil Twist doin' yoga
So much green like the kid mixed with ogre
And I'm so paid wonder why they call me broker
Sandy-like smell, that's my black card odour
Star on this track, Lil Twist the young Yoda
In a minute I'ma have my momma like Oprah
But for now I'm gettin' new money like I told ya

[Chorus: Mishon]
Girl that's new money right there
Yea that's new money right there, gonna see how crispy that feel
How good that looks, how good that smells
Soon as they make it, I get it
Soon as I get it, I spend it
Yea that's new money right there, yea that's new money right there

[Post-Chorus: Mishon]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (New Money)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (New Money)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Yea that's new money right there)

[Bridge: Mishon]
New money right here, young money right here, old money ova' there, move ova'
Mo'money, who cares, throw money like yea, new money right here it's ova
New money right here, young money right here, old money ova' there, move ova'
Mo'money, who cares, throw money like yea, new money right here it's ova'

[Hook: Mishon]
Girl that's new money right there
