(Intro)
Yep

(Verse)
Now I’m turnt up, super fucked up
Eyes low like a flat tire
I smoke big like a wild fire
Getting giggity gig like Quagmire
Rep wild kidz, you know it
Yea, every night be a wild night
From weed, drink to percocets
I’m getting high as hell, reaching new heights

(Hook)
Wild for the night fuck being polite

Wild for the night fuck being polite
We going...
Wild for the night fuck being polite

Wild for the night fuck being polite

(Verse)
Look, it’s the weekend and I’m chilling with the wild kidz
Givency straight out of Paris, fuck your stylist
I don’t mean no harm but these pussy’s keep bitching
Wondering why I’m smoking and where the fuck I’m living
They on my dick and they think I’m tripping
Once I'm on the ground, then they all start kicking
But when I get up then they all start running well
Salute this pimping
Won't your man quit acting like a bitch though
I smoke weed, I guess that’s why they on my dick so

(Verse)
Turn up
Back to the lac yeah back to the trap
Give me 2 cups, I’m back to the act
Yeah I sip slow, treat this shit like yak
With Gucci all on my hat
It's Twizzy fly, no wings bitch
This shit easy, no practice
I’m rolling up that good kush
Yeah blueish green, Dallas Mavericks
My whole clique eating like fat kids
You try to fuck us over, that’s bad bitch
Showing up to your Ghost throwing hand grenades
And them mac-10’s like come again
If you reppin bitch, scream wild kidz
If you reppin bitch, scream wild kidz
Me and Mazy in the back of the bach
With your chick, smoking loud bitch
We getting…

(Hook)
Wild for the night fuck being polite
We going...
Wild for the night fuck being polite
We going...
Wild for the night fuck being polite
We going...
Wild for the night fuck being polite
We going...
