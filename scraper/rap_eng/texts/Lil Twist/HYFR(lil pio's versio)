HYFR(HELL YEAH FUCKING RIGHT)
Lil pio’s version
(lil pio)
Money over bitches
Never kill a women unless she a witness
All about my business
Survival of the fitness
I never smoked a joint
Nigga what is the point
I had a thought in my head and I could never get it out my fucking head
A lot of girls tried to sleep in my bed
My nigga can talk the talk but he can't walk the walk
Come on girl suck my dick for a new outfit
Im telling the whole world something
The world is never gonna end as long as I am around
I am the nigga
You know where it at
Oregon is the place for them bitches to be fucking me
I know my nigga piozon
Not even better than the seahawks in the endzone
I have my thoughts to myself
Let me explain
I love my life and the bitches
People would ask me
You really never puffed a joint
Have you ever fucked you girl
Yawl still together
Is all you care about the is the money
I am saying
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Fucking right
Fucking right
Alright
(lil twist)
Damn I could really fill the skys right now
I see the fucking clouds
They say the color purple is now a pimp color
My nigga lil pio tearing shit up
I am so high right now damn Im so loopy
Im gonna live it up like snoopy
Being successful is all I care about right now
I want to be at the top with my nigga
But people don’t think I can make but this mother fucking
Cracker will prove them wrong
It will be like game over mother fucker
People ask me
(lil pio)
You really never puffed a joint before
Have you ever fucked your girl
Yawl still together
Is all you care about is the money
(lil twist)
