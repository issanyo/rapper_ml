(Lil Wayne's Verse)
Brand new money, Brand new Boston
You act brand new, and get a brand new coffin
Little bro, I gotcha, hold ya weight and ima spot ya
All I you need is the combination to the locker
I'm the hip hop rocker
I'm the hip hop doctor
I'm in tip top shape
And my flip flops Gucci, drinkin sake eatin sushi wit a bunch of bad groupies
I swear I'm a walkin movie, u ain even gotta cue me
And baby I'm the shit, you ain't even gota do me
Cuz ain't no one gon do, me better than ima do me, so so ima do me
My watch say time a do me, you don't kick it like a kick it bitch I kick it, I'm kinda bruce lee
Ima shooter behind the shooting, I'm the looter behind the looting
And I got so much swagger I swear swagger tryna sue me
Your girlfriend tryna knew me, I mean she tryn to get ta no me
She said that she can do all I kinds of crazy shit to get to know me
Ok lil twist I'm kobe but im shooting like ginobili
No one after nor before me I go to earth wen mars is boring
Wat am I work you can't afford me but your baby moms addore me
She wanna read my tattooos like a muthafukin story
That's another fuckin story but ima get to that later
You don't know what your in for and call me mr data
Or you can call me it's the greatest or for short just the greatest
I swear I walk right on the lot and bought the longest Mercedes
It's weezy baby ho turn up ur radio
I'm in the penthouse fuckin on the patio
She call me daddy yo she don't wear panny hoes
And when I'm done watch I do magic, make her vanish yo
But she was Spanish though and I like the Spanish hoes
Yea two of them and one of me it's a Weezy sandwich ho
I be like "damn them hoes"
I am an animal
I am the chief of the tribe like a Seminole
Crazy like Anne Nicole but I'm expandin though
Man I swear I don't need security I need fan patrol
And I am young mula and so is twisty baby
And don't you ever forget that and don't forget the baby
Gone
