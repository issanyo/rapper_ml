[Verse 1: Lil Twist]

Ugh I get that cake light then I shine
I show my swagg they tryna take mine
Its Twizzy Baby in the right mind
Switchin out hoes like playing date line
Ima do this here for for my team Y-Y-YMCMB
And girl I gots a lot of green
So put that pussy all on me
Since a youngin baby one hundred baby
Everything they doing I been done it baby
I dont rock with them and Im underrated
But they washed up like the laundry lady
Ima young nigga with old paper
I stay high as a skyscraper
And me I scream eff a hater
Who needs them they're annihilated
Been round the world and back ho
You can tell from the way I act doe
Gotta new girl for each state
You can tell Im Wayne and Mac bro
Twizzy F leave nothin left
Cause I lay em down by myself
Bill Gates wealth made hearts melt
Got em watchin me like Rockwell
Im goin in you ain't gotta tell me
Since a youngster gettin mad bread like a deli
Hit the club make it flood like a broke levy
Leave the club with a set of twins like Mary Mary
Hit the Telli get it poppin let em know how Twizzy rockin
Soon as we done lettin em rock
Two minutes past couple mo knocking
Rockstar lifestyle I tried to be the nice child
Still made it now half a Mill in my bank account shit keep hatin

[Hook]
Godzilla, Godzilla, I swear to god I'm as hard as Godzilla
Godzilla, Godzilla, I'm a monster, I swear to god nigga
Godzilla, Godzilla, I swear to god I'm as hard as Godzilla
Godzilla, Godzilla, bigger than life

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]

Look, stop comparing, I'm better
Young money forever
Gold around my neck look like I found me fucking treasure
Balling with no turnovers but you just gaining several
And for instance I'm something like Sheed and you something like Webber
Damn, Me hungry for what I want so watch me get it, get it
Luxury living Miami drive benz kitty
They say I'm a kid, but I Ain't kidding, no not at all and uhh
Big money tall, crib big as the taj mahal
T.O.S to the death of me that's ef-ing mean, can't believe I spent 600 on
This ef-ing jeans get your money right, I got my money right
Spend ten in one night
Spend 5 on your sister flight
Do what I do, give her to my crew give her back in the same night
I do it like no other, I say I'm mighty blessed
Plus I'm hard to impress, protégée of the best

[Hook]
Godzilla, Godzilla, I swear to god I'm as hard as Godzilla
Godzilla, Godzilla, I'm a monster, I swear to god nigga
Godzilla, Godzilla, I swear to god I'm as hard as Godzilla
Godzilla, Godzilla, bigger than life
