What's the use of being lonely when I'm offering my company?
You could be my lover, hold me, I'll give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We can intertwine, we can intertwine, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
Had the whole hood shook when you moved in
Face like a goddess, body on ten
Had to be back in the crib before the streets lights
That was back when you wasn't allowed to have friends
Now you grown up, features all swole up
Seen you at the club had me like "Hol' up"
What you doing, who you with, what you sipping on?
Who you doing, where you been? Let me take you home
And if you hungry we can stop at the Waffle House
I'm on that shit it's whatever what you talking 'bout?
Take that time to get to know me
Cause baby what's the use of being lonely?

What's the use of being lonely when I'm offering my company?
You could be my lover, hold me, I'll give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We should make some time, so I can intertwine with you

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
We can intertwine, just let me get behind
And watch me run up in that thang like the finish line
To end it like it's Christmas time, I eat it like it's dinner time
She said let's do it like at 86, I said let's do it like 69
Give her a bit a this it ain't no way she getting tired
Introduced to the molly now she's amp'd and she's wired
Get her back to the room, she said "Twizzy is who I desire"
I said let's get in the shower girl that ass is on fire
I pay you with attention, direct deposit wire
That shit don't need even matter as long as love transpires
And after all that, baby you should really know me
Now you ain't got never be lonely

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Tell me do you really want it? Wake up in the morning
Right next to me baby, right next to me baby
Tell me do you really want it? Wake up in the morning
Right next to me baby, right next to me baby
