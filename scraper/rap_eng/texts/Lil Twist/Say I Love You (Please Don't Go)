[Verse 1: Tyler Medeiros]
I never wanted to leave you
And lead you away
Now i just wish I can hold you
You told me to stay
I, I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna hear you say "I love you"
(2x)

[Chorus: Tyler Medeiros]
Baby, I love you so
And I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door
Please don't go, please don't go,no no
Please don't go, please don't go no no
Please don't go, please don't go, no no
Please don't go, please don't go no no

[Verse 2: Tyler Medeiros]
I always wanted to love you
Thinkin' of you everyday
Baby tell me you love me
Just hug me and say
I, I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna hear you say "I love you"
(2x)

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you so
And I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door
Please don't go, please don't go,no no
Please don't go, please don't go no no
Please don't go, please don't go, no no
Please don't go, please don't go no no

Young Money
Please don't go
Go nowhere
I just really want you to stay right here
Reminice in the times you'll whisper in my ear
And say that you love me
But now you disappear like poof
A magic trick
Got me asking like how real does magic gets
I only messed up once - ugh fabulous
But this shows your girl bout to lavish ish
You better than average
Ill move you out to dallas on some averic ish
Mark humbin cupbin surrounded by savages
And give you the world on some happy ish
You digg
Not stunt this is how i live
This is how i was raised
This is how we give
And yo before you go i think its best that i let you know OH

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you so
And I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door
Please don't go, please don't go,no no
Please don't go, please don't go no no
Please don't go, please don't go, no no
Please don't go, please don't go no no
