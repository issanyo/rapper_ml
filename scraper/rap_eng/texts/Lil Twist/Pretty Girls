[Verse 3: Lil Twist]
You the baddest chick I've ever seen
Oops pretty I mean, I'm kinda lean

Drop right in school like what's up
Tell your nurse I need a touch up
Oops my bad, I mean a check up
And tell a dude to get his check up
It's Twizzy F and MB
With Walter and Carter in the front seat
I met shawty at the meet and greet
Now it's me and her
And nothing gets between
Our love
N-nothing sits above
Now ay baby girl hold up
It's YMCMB and you can be the princess
Girl what's up?
