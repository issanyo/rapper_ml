Well everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High shining on me, so
Let's get this party started
Everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High smiling on me, come on
Let's get this party started
Blind-sided by the blitz, come on baby, it's on
I couldn't wait to get on this, you ain't no quiet storm
I'm gonna tell it like it is, there ain't no stopping us now
Somebody shut me up so I can live out loud
Well everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High shining on me, so
Let's get this party started
Them people thought I was gone, it's been a long time comin'
But straight out the box we got the dark side runnin'
So Father, Most High won't You show yourself
And shine on this record like nobody else?
Everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High shining on me, so
Let's get this party started
Well everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High smiling on me, come on
Let's get this party started
Well everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High shining on me, come on
Let's get this party started
Well everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High smiling on me, come on
Let's get this party started
