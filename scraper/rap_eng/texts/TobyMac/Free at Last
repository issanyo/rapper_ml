Won't you please turn in your hymnals to page 333
Sister mildred, we're gonna play free at last
Free at last, thank god almighty

Free at last, free at last
I thank god I'm free at last
Free at last, free at last
I thank god I'm free at last

[have you heard?]
[listen carefully]
[I can't stop]

[Chorus 1]
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank god almighty I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank god almighty I'm free

[Chorus 2]
Cause I'm free, free at last
And I'm free, from my past, and I'm free
Free from sin, and I'm free
And I ain't going back again

Shackles had me down but he gave me a new sound
So reclaim my name from the lost and found
Ya see, something's got me jumpin'
And I think it's the way
That he can take a hard man
And turn him into soft clay
Out of the darkness, the father has sparked this
The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well I once was lost but I'm free at last!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

Oppression was in session and my life was the term
But when I heard about the word I was willing to learn
About a flavor I could savor and a brighter tomorrow
Cause this could never be endeavored by a wish on a star
The father first receives us, the truth then frees us
Forgiven, now I'm living like a man full of jesus
It was hell until I fell upon my knees and prayed
But now the yoke that I was totin' has been taken away

[Chorus 1]

Cause I'm free, free at last, free
From my past, free from sin, and I'm free
And down on my knees when my life passed me by
And I ain't, no I ain't going back again

F r to the e e
L a to the s t
Out of the darkness, the father has sparked this
The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well I was once lost but I'm free at last

I'm here to tell you what he did for me and
I'm here to tell you that he set me free and
I know that he can do the same for you, too
He did it, I'm wit it, so come and get it
Be free at last!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

When all of god's children: black men and white men
Jews and gentiles, protestants and catholics
Will be able to join hands and
Sing in the words of the old negro spiritual...

[Chorus 1]

Cause I'm free, free at last, cause I'm free
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Down on my knees when my life passed me by
And I ain't, no I ain't going back again
Thank god I'm free

Free at last, free at last
Thank god almighty we are free at last!
