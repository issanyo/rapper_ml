Do what you love
And you'll love what you do
(that's what they say)
That's only true
When I'm following you
Cause you are my shade
On those hot southern days
You're the hand I live to hold
You fill up this space
Put love where it ain't
And you're patient as I grow
So I know

Love is in the house
And the house is packed
So much soul I left the back door cracked
Mama always said it's a matter of fact
That when love is in the house
The house is packed
Love is in the house
And the house is packed
Daddy always said it's a matter of fact
That when love is in the house
The house is packed

Your love is patient
Your love it shines
I'll never capture all its beauty in my dopest rhymes
Your love is Tru-Blue
Your love's The Twins
Your love's a girl from Jamaica
Who is still my best friend
You brought life to me
So on the mic
I'm communicatin' everything you've done for me
You filled the halls of my house with your love
So I'm lifting you up

Government checks they flex with no dollars
Two turn tables and a plate full of collards
Royalty checks we flex with few dollars
But amazing grace makes the people wanna holla

Love is in the house
And the house is packed
So much soul I left the back door cracked
Mama always said it's a matter of fact
That when love is in the house
The house is packed
Love is in the house
And the house is packed
So much soul I left the back door cracked
Daddy always said it's a matter of fact
That when love is in the house
The house is packed

Woke up this morning
Didn't know what to do
There was people all around me
Tellin' me to sing the blues
Said they ain't seen no happy since 1992
Then they turned to me thinkin' I'd agree
And I offered this humble view
And I said

Naaah nah nah nah naah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Love is in the house is packed
Sing:
Naaah nah nah nah naah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Love is in the house is packed

Woke up this morning
Spend some time with you

Love is in the house and the house is packed
