[Intro: TobyMac]
Yeah
This the one right here

[Verse 1: TobyMac]
Silly me, silly me, aye
Revertin' back to my old ways
Them got to be in control days
Jump before I pray
Yo, I'm headed out the doorway
But I want Your way, Yahweh
From dirt roads to highways
You're showin' me a beautiful view from this backseat
But there's lots of room and I never would have seen it if I wasn't rolling with you

[Hook: Hollyn]
I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver
I don't wanna navigate, (don't wanna, uh), won't You take it over (take it over)
I don't wanna ever doubt You, I'm lost without You Lord
I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver

[Post-Chorus: Hollyn]
You got the wheel, take me where You wanna go
My heart is Your's, no matter where we roll

[Verse 2: TRU]
Been backseat my whole life
Now I turned 16 so it's time to drive
Buckle up, TRU behind the wheel
Got my iPhone bumping like (dom da dom)
GPS locked and the map was set
Thought I had it all right till the road went left
Spinning outta control in this Coupe de Ville
Now I'm sittin' shotgun, Jesus take the wheeel

[Hook: Hollyn]
I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver
I don't wanna navigate, (don't wanna, uh), won't You take it over (take it over)
I don't wanna ever doubt You, I'm lost without You Lord
I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver

[Bridge: TobyMac]
I'm putting my trust in You, putting my trust in You
It's a little bit overdue, but I'm putting my trust in You
I'm putting my trust in You, putting my trust in You
It's a little bit overdue, but I'm putting my trust in You
I'm putting my trust in You, putting my trust in You
It's a little bit overdue, but I'm putting my trust in You

[Verse 3: TobyMac]
It's a whole new journey, a brand new path
And Imma fix my eyes so I won't look back
Tame this beating heart in my chest
Cause everything in me wants to jump ahead
So light it up, up
Don't let it fade
Light it up, up
Show me the way
Light it up Lord, just like You do
No second guessin', Imma move with You

[Hook: Hollyn]
I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver
I don't wanna navigate, (don't wanna, uh), won't You take it over (take it over)
I don't wanna ever doubt You, I'm lost without You Lord
I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver

[Hook: Hollyn]
I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver
I don't wanna navigate, (don't wanna, uh), won't You take it over (take it over)
I don't wanna ever doubt You, I'm lost without You Lord
I don't wanna be no backseat, (don't wanna be) no backseat driver
