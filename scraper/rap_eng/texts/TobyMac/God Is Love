[Hook]
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
We sing it, like
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above

[Verse 1: John Reuben]
Thinkin' of my past motivates my future
Will I make or break, love or hate?
Now tell me, who's the fake and who's the snake, man?
Who can I trust? So many promises I seen bust
Justice never accomplished right so I gotta let that go and keep movin'
Yeshua, illuminate my path and keep me tuned in
So much negative around for me
To still get consumed in, but I still have peace in the midst of confusion
I still have peace in the midst of confusion
Even though I know my life has purpose
I find myself down and out, feelin' worthless
And defenseless against them that rise against me
But I still call no man my enemy
Cause competition is none no competitors
Matthew 5:44's got me prayin' for predators
Turnin' cheeks on the regular so throw your dart
And chances are you'll hit the heart
But never take me apart because I'm founded in Yeshua
So who can be against me?
That's what I thought, nobody

[Hook]
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
We sing it, like
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
We sing it, like
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
TobyMac and I'm here to drop this on you
I got a fresh point of view
John Reuben, let me tell you what I'm tryin' to say
The world can't take these smiles away
Sunny days, though they may be gray
And by the way, some people just love to hate
But I got love for 'em all so much love for 'em all
God is love with a capital L
And it's the last thing he told us through Christ as well
You got to love God with all your heart
And love your brother like you love yourself
Love your brother like you love yourself, man
And for you, John, that's a whole lot of love

[Hook]
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
We sing it, like
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
We sing it, like
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above

[Bridge: John Reuben & tobyMac]
Love, huh? No one's above it or below it
Love, right? Some think they're tough cause they don't show it
Love, huh? We make it plain to see
That we got love, even if they haven't for we
Love, huh? No one's above it or below it
Love, right? Some think they're tough cause they don't show it
Love, huh? We make it plain to see
That we got love, even if they haven't for we

[Hook]
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
We sing it, like
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
We sing it, like
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
We sing it, like
Love is God and God is love
No one's below, no one's above
