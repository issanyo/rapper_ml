[Sample]
It's time to jam!

[Hook]
When dc talks
When dc talks
When dc talks
When dc talks

When I talk, I talk about The Lord
You can be sure that you can't afford
To miss a lyric, a rhyming line
You know, they got meaning, they're right on time
Totally true and to the last letter
If its christian, it ought to be better
Omit a bit, it should be the best
If it's of the king, you know it's blessed

[Hook]

D is for decent, I mean what I say
But obscene, I don't play that way
C is for Christ, to the i-a-n
That's right y'all, I am born again
That's my tool, my gift to use
R-a-p to spread the news of god
So you know the part now
Now tell the world what's on your heart

[Hook]
