A little something like, a little something like
A little something like this
A little something like, a little something like
A little something like, a little something like this

I clear my throat before I grab the mic, I need uno momento
Them cynics gonna ride me like a pinto
No resentment do you comprehend my innuendo
You still can't leave the party 'til you drop your crucial info

Am I jaded in assumin' that you're simply bound to do me
Like them other lyricists who's message ain't so gloomy
Pan my positivity, 'cause love has let you down
'Cause if they taste the love you tasted
They'd be making sweeter sounds T

Government checks they flex with no dollars
Two turntables and a plate full of collards
Royalty checks reflects with few dollars
But my DJ makes the people wanna holler

Love is in the house and the house is packed
So much so I left the back door cracked
Mama always said it's a matter of fact
That when love is in the house the house is packed

Love is in the house and the house is packed
So much so I left the back door cracked
Daddy always said that I wish I was black
And when love is in the house the house is packed

Packed like a baby nine months in the womb
Man it was packed like the closet full of Nike's in my room
Singin' "Oh sweet Lord take me to the next level
Where the love's much thicker than the stares of my devils"

So whether or not this is a dream or reality
Let me appeal to the graces of His majesty
Amazin' it will be when this tree bears life
My roots run to the river and the Giver of Life

Corporate jets they flex with big dollars
Two palm pilots and a room full of bawlers
Royalty checks reflects with few dollars
But amazin' grace makes the people wanna holler

Love is in the house and the house is packed
So much so I left the back door cracked
Mama always said it's a matter of fact
That when love is in the house the house is packed

Love is in the house and the house is packed
So much so I left the back door cracked
Daddy always said that I wish I was black
And when love is in the house the house is packed

Woke up this morning, I didn't know what to do
There was people all around me tellin' me to sing the blues
Said they ain't seen no happy since 1992
Then they turned to me thinking I'd agree and I offered this humble view

Well now sing
Na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na
Love is in the house and the house is packed, sing
Na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na
Love is in the house and the house is packed

Love is in the house and the house is packed
So much so I left the back door cracked
Mama always said it's a matter of fact
That when love is in the house the house is packed

Love is in the house and the house is packed
So much so I left the back door cracked
Daddy always said that I wish I was black
And when love is in the house the house is

C'mon, na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na
Love is in the house and the house is packed, sing
Na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na
Love is in the house and the house is packed

Sing, Na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na
Love is in the house and the house is packed, sing
Na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na
Love is in the house and the house is packed

Na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na
Love is in the house and the house is packed, sing
Na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na
Love is in the house and the house is packed
