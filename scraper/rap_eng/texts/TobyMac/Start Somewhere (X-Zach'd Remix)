Last night, everything was movinÃ¢Â€Â™ so fast
I could barely keep track
Oh, of my offenses or your defenses
In hindsight, I woulda, coulda, shoulda not gone there
But left without a word to spare
Was it your offenses or my defensiveness?
ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s got me thinkinÃ¢Â€Â™ that weÃ¢Â€Â™re never gonna get it right
I wanna straighten this before the sun goes down tonight
If I could only fight the bitterness I feel inside
This thing is eatinÃ¢Â€Â™ me alive
Well IÃ¢Â€Â™m right here
And youÃ¢Â€Â™re right there
And God knows weÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to start somewhere
Ã¢Â€Â˜Cause IÃ¢Â€Â™m messed up
And youÃ¢Â€Â™re broken
And those shots we fired are still smokinÃ¢Â€Â™
IÃ¢Â€Â™m tossinÃ¢Â€Â™ and turninÃ¢Â€Â™ on the things IÃ¢Â€Â™d undo
As I wrestle with the painful truth
Oh, my sleep escapes me as guilt berates me
Exhausted, the memories are drawing so near
I can see it like a world premiere
When did my objective lose all objectiveness?
If I need you, and you need me
How can you turn your back and just leave me?
When IÃ¢Â€Â™m right here, and youÃ¢Â€Â™re right there
And God knows weÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to start somewhere
I said some things that I regret
And if I could, IÃ¢Â€Â™d take Ã¢Â€Â˜em back
If I could turn my words around
You wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t hear a sound
But here I am, and there you are
The space between us is not so far
IÃ¢Â€Â™m reaching out my hand in love
Before the fading sun, forgive me for what IÃ¢Â€Â™ve done
Hey, hey Ã¢Â€Â¦
Ã¢Â€ÂœThe gun shotÃ¢Â€Â™s gotta go, man. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s it. I mean, enough is enough. Good grief
