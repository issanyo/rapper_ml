Arrows flying into silence
Broken pieces lying around where it went down
Water rising back to silence, quietly crying
Wondering how and look at us now
We thought our love would take the world by storm

Are we too far apart?
Two worlds among the stars
You're gonna take a piece of my heart
If you leave

So it's two separate ways
Or am I too late to say?
I wanna fight for what we got
'Cause I believe in family
In family

So are we still trying?
Or simply surviving?
We're facing these giants
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

But I still believe in
They dreams we've been dreaming
The hope that we build on
It's never too far, it's never too far
If we choose to turn and let these walls fall down

Are we too far apart?
Two worlds among the stars
You're gonna take a piece of my heart
If you leave

So it's two separate ways
Or am I too late to say?
I wanna fight for what we got
'Cause I believe in family
In family
In family!

I still believe
I still believe that we're not too far apart
Two worlds among the stars
Don't take a piece of my heart
Please, don't leave

It's not too late to say
Father, show us the way
To fight for what we got 'cause you believe in family
In family
In family
In family
