[Verse 1]
I've always been a dreamer, a soul seeker
I knew my life was meant for something deeper
You showed me, there's beauty all along the way
I've been walking 'til my feet hurt, holes in my t-shirt
Caught me at the Goodwill, 'cuz you know it's cheaper
I've only got a few dollars to my name

[Pre-Chorus]
No I, I, I, I'm, never gonna stop believing
I, I, I, Imma let 'em know till the day I die

[Chorus 1]
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
We'll lift You up
'Til this place erupts
We'll lift You up
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's been a long road, but Imma still flow
I keep pouring out my heart for the people
I'll never let the passion fade away
And You're the only reason, I'm preaching freedom
I'll be turning every eye to the kingdom, yeah
There ain't no way that'll ever change
No, no, no...

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I'm, never gonna stop believing
I, I, I, Imma let 'em know till the day I die

[Chorus 2]
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
We'll lift You up
'Til this place erupts
We'll lift You up
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
You ain't ever gonna let us down

[Bridge]
I'm never gonna stop believing
Imma let 'em know, yea
Imma let 'em know...

[Chorus 3]
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
We'll lift You up
'Til this place erupts
We'll lift You up
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
'Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
