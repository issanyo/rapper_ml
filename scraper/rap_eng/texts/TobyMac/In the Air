Doo, doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo
There in the air

I had a dream last night about the other side
And I must confess that it was quite the ride
I had a dream last night and the fact that you weren't there
Gave me quite the scare (Uh-huh)
You see people were afloat all around me
Yet their weightless state never seemed to astound me
Everything was grand till I noticed one thing
That you my friend weren't on the scene

Doo, doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo
There in the air

I've been working all morning trying to spin my dream
Cuz I just can't believe you weren't in my dream
Remember you and I said we would paint the sky
And the leaves on the trees and the stars at night
We made beats and we even wrote rhymes
And played golf I think a million times
Now we never got around to spiritual matters
But we sure made time for our mindless chatter

Doo, doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo
Whether here, there or in the air

I wanna see you there in the air (See you there, see you there)
One day we'll we be singin' (Singin) (Alleluia)
I wanna see you there in the air (See you there, see you there)
One day we'll we be singin' (Singin) (Alleluia)

*Phone dialing*
(other guy) Hello?
(Toby) Wassup?
Wassup?
How you doin'?
Just fine!
I was sort of wondering, could we make a time?
Just to kick it?
Why not? At our usual spot
Lattes in May
Mine cold yours hot
So where we goin?
Much deeper than our usual chat
Like whose beats is weak and whose (both) beats is phat
(Toby) Nah my man just some next level junk
Like when we discussed if Tiger Woods could dunk?
Just meet me there, seven o'clock
Rain or shine yo
With a fat cup of bean and a wide open mind (wide open mind)
Man that's heavy

Doo, doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo
There in the air

I wanna see you there in the air (See you there, see you there)
One day we'll we be singin' (Singin) (Alleluia)
I wanna see you there in the air (See you there, see you there)
One day we'll we be singin' (Singin) (Alleluia)
