As fall rides off in the sunset
I sweep the snow from my doorstep
I just can't help but stop and grin
It's like I'm ten years old again
And everywhere I go I can feel it

Some say it moves like a spirit
It falls on us once a year
Like it came on a midnight clear
It's all love
The season is a gift
When love came down to let us live
Let's open up and let our hearts embrace this moment

For Christmas this year
Gonna make a sound
Gonna make it loud
For Christmas this year
We're gonna make some noise
Let the world rejoice
For Christmas this year
For Christmas
For Christmas this year

The laughter starts before the sunrise
I sneak downstairs at the sparklin' lights
And oh what joy it brings to me
Our family around our Christmas tree
And I thank the Lord for His favor
As we sing the songs of the Savior
Our Savior

It's all love
The season is a gift
When love came down to let us live
Let's open up and let our hearts embrace this moment

For Christmas this year
Gonna make a sound
Gonna make it loud
For Christmas this year
We're gonna make some noise
Let the world rejoice

For Christmas this year
For Christmas
For Christmas this year

Holy Holy holy
God is coming near
Unto us a Savior's born
On a midnight clear

Holy Holy holy
God is coming near
Unto us a Savior's born
On a midnight clear
Oh

For Christmas this year
Gonna make a sound
Gonna make it loud
For Christmas this year
We're gonna make some noise
Let the world rejoice
For Christmas this year
For Christmas
For Christmas this year

For Christmas this year
Gonna make a sound
Gonna make it loud
For Christmas this year
We're gonna make some noise
Let the world rejoice
For Christmas this year
For Christmas
For Christmas this year

Holy Holy holy
God is coming near
Unto us a savior born
On a midnight clear
