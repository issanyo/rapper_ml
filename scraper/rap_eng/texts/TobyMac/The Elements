[Verse 1]
I lace the boots up, it's straight to the door
'Cause this, is worth fighting for
I get my head right, the heart's gotta follow
Whisper a prayer like there ain't no tomorrow
Take a breath, and I exhale slow
I wasn't made for this kind of cold
This ain't the kind of place that you wanna know
These are the elements, I'm telling you bro
This world, is up in my grill
This world, is shooting to kill
This world always gotta be stealing my heart
This world always tryin' to rip my family apart (Apart, apart, apart)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll fight the elements (Elements, elements, elements)
I'll fight the elements (Elements, elements, elements)
I got spirit, I got faith
I might bend but I won't break
I'll fight the elements (Elements, elements, elements)

[Chorus]
And I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down
I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down
I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down
I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down

[Verse 2]
This ain't our home, nah, not even close
They camouflage like we're fighting some ghost
You start to doubt everything that you know
I feel the heat and it's starting to show
They try to break us, break us, make us wanna give in
Lay down our arms, Novocain us again
Lay down a fight, I could never relent
And I'ma take it all the way to the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll fight the elements (Elements, elements, elements)
I'll fight the elements (Elements, elements, elements)
I got spirit, I got faith
I might bend but I won't break
I'll fight the elements (Elements, elements, elements)

[Chorus]
And I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down
I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down
I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down
I'ma gonna go down swinging, if I go down
Let's go

[Refrain]
Elements, the elem-elements
Elements, the elem-elements
Elements, the elem-elements
Elements, the elem-elements
Elements, the elem-elements
Elements, the elem-elements
Elements, the elem-elements
Elements, the elem-elements

[Bridge]
Father, God, let me see it for what it is
This ain't neutral we're up against
These elements push me to the fence
And then I end up on top of it
If I'm not careful
To recognize what is pushing in
Open my eyes to these elements
Stand up and rise to these elements
I'm willing to fight, willing to fight
The elements

[Refrain]
Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
Elements, the elem-elements (Let's go)
Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
Elements, the elem-elements

[Outro]
Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
Elements, the elem-elements (I can feel it)
Elements, the elem-elements
Elements, the elem-elements
