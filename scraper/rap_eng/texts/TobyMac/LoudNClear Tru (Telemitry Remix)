To all you playa haters
Hate at the playa, not the game, baby

Uh, we goin' put it on ya
Make it loud n clear
All of my shorties
Whether far or near
Since the last tru Dog
It's been three long years
So we goin' make it loud

I'mma make it clearer
Than a Southern California day
And even louder
'Cause the song I sing will never fade
You really thought that T-R-U to D-O-G was ending?
Listen, homie, you don't even know me
This is just beginnin'
Ten-year veteran
Servin' up the medicine
I rock a mic
You rock a trike
Oops! Your diaper's wet again
Uh!

We goin' put it on ya
Make it loud n clear
All of my shorties
Whether far or near
Since the last
It's been three long years
So we goin' make it loud

We goin' put it on ya
Make it loud n clear
All of my shorties
Whether far or near
Since the last
It's been three long years
So we goin' make it loud

Ten-year veteran
Servin' up the medicine
I rock a mic
You rock a trike

We goin' put it on ya
Make it loud n clear
