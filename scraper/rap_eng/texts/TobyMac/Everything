[Verse 1]
I'm captivated, I'll say it
I'm on a whole new intrigue
My space invaded, upgraded
I hear You talkin' to me
It's in the boom of the thunder, it's in the cool of the rain
And I'll say I don't ever want to get away

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight is beautiful
It's got my mind on You
And everywhere I turn is a reminder (Reminder, reminder)

[Chorus]
I see You in everything, all day
And every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
I see You in every little thing, all day
No matter where I go I know Your love is findin' me
I see You in everything
You're all up in everything

[Verse 2]
My soul's awaken
I'm taken by all the beauty You bring
You got it blarin', I'm starin'
Love watchin' You do Your thing
There's no mistakin' Your style
No mistakin' Your touch
I see the grand, I see the subtle of Your love

[Chorus]
Lord, I see You in everything all day
And every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
I see You in every little thing, all day
No matter where I go I know Your love is findin' me
It's findin' me in everything, all day
And every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
I see You in every little thing, all day
No matter where I go I know Your love is findin' me

[Bridge]
Tonight is beautiful
It's got my mind on You (Got my mind on You)
And everywhere I turn is a reminder (Ooh, ooh)
From the sparkle in her eyes to the starlit open skies
You bring my heart to life, fill me with wonder (With wonder, with wonder, with wonder)

[Chorus]
I see You in everything all day (All day)
And every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
I see You in every little thing, all day (All day)
No matter where I go I know Your love is findin' me
I see You in, aye, aye, aye, everything
You're all up in, aye, aye, aye, everything
I see You in, aye, aye, aye, everything
You're all up in, aye, aye, aye, everything

[Outro]
Oh, I can see Your love, Your love in everything
And that's why You'll always be my everything
Yeah, I can see Your love, Your love in everything
And that's why You'll always be my everything
