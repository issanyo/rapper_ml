[Verse 1]
They say picture perfect, filter do your thing
They floating lies, make this young girl doubt what she think
Not showing enough, not sexy enough, no way
Too dark, too light for us, nah, that look ain’t gon’ play

[Pre-Chorus]
Words are bouncin' 'round my head
I can’t stop their echoing
Trippin’ on that negative

[Chorus]
But You call me lovely
You say I’m wonderfully made
Your river floods me
Your Words feel like a serenade

I love that You are thinkin’ of me
All of those voices fade away
When You call me lovely
Lo-o-ovely

Lovely, You call me lovely
You call me lovely
And I’ma soak in it
And I’ma soak in it
And I’ma soak in it

[Verse 2]
No I ain’t even gonna fake it
Don’t wanna leave without no make-up
This ain’t made up
When I ain’t made up

Always wonderin’ what they thinkin’
So afraid of what they sayin’
When I ain’t fixed up
Got me mixed up, no-no

[Pre-Chorus]
Words are bouncin’ 'round my head
I can’t stop their echoing (echoing)
Trippin’ on that negative

[Chorus]
But You call me lovely
You say I’m wonderfully made
Your river floods me
Your Words feel like a serenade

I love that You are thinkin’ of me
All of those voices fade away
When You call me lovely, (hey!)
Lo-o-ovely

And I’ma soak in it (soak in it)
And I’ma soak in it (soak in it)
And I’ma soak in it (soak in it)

[Bridge]
The way You love me
The way You know me
The way You always got the time for me
I’ma soak in it
I’ma soak in it

The way You see me
The way You keep me
And I know that I don’t make it easy
I’ma soak in it (I'ma soak in it)
I’ma soak in it (I'ma soak in it, soak in it; hey!)

Oh-oh-oh-ohh
I’ma soak in it (I'ma soak in it)
I’ma soak in it (I'ma soak in it)

[Chorus]
And You call me lovely
You say I’m wonderfully made
Your river floods me (oh, Your river floods me)
Your Words feel like a serenade

I love that You are thinkin’ of me (thinkin’ of me)
All of those voices fade away
When You call me lovely, hey! (You call me, You call me)
Lo-o-ovely

[Outro]
You call me lovely
Lo-o-ovely
You call me lovely
Lo-o-ovely ...
