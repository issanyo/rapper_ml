[Intro: tobyMac]
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you, the way you

[Verse I: Jamie Grace]
I've had a long day, I just wanna relax
Don't have time for my friends, no time to chit chat
Problems at my job, wonderin' what to do
I know I should be working but I'm thinking of you and

[Channel I: Jamie Grace]
Just when I feel this crazy world is gonna bring me down
That's when your smile comes around

[Chorus: Jamie Grace]
[1] Oh, I love the way you hold me, by my side you'll always be
You take each and every day, make it special in some way
I love the way you hold me, in your arms I'll always be
You take each and every day, make it special in some way
I love you more than the words in my brain can express
I can't imagine even loving you less
[2] Lord, I love the way you hold me
Whoa, oh, I love the way you hold me
Whoa, oh

[Verse II: Jamie Grace]
Well ya, took my day and you flipped it around
Calmed the tidal wave and put my feet on the ground
Forever in my heart, always on my mind
It's crazy how I think about you all of the time

[Channel II: Jamie Grace]
And just when I think I'm 'bout to figure you out
You make me wanna sing and shout

[Chorus: Jamie Grace]
[1] I love the way you hold me, by my side you'll always be
You take each and every day, make it special in some way
I love the way you hold me, in your arms I'll always be
You take each and every day, make it special in some way
I love you more than the words in my brain can express
I can't imagine even loving you less
[2] Lord, I love the way you hold me
Whoa, oh, I love the way you hold me
Whoa, oh

[Bridge: Jamie Grace and tobyMac]
[1] I'm so grateful and thankful for all you've done
Wish I could tell you in a short story or poem
But all I have is my voice and this guitar
And you have my heart
[2] Oh, I love the way you hold me, by my side you'll always be
You take each and every day, make it special in some way
I love the way you hold me, in your arms I'll always be
You take each and every day, every day, every

[Chorus II: Jamie Grace]
[1] I love the way you hold me, by my side you'll always be
You take each and every day oh-so-special
I love the way you hold me, in your arms I'll always be
You take each and every day, make it special in some way
I love you more than the words in my brain can express
I can't imagine even loving you less
[2] Lord, I love the way you hold me
Whoa, oh, I love the way you hold me
Whoa, oh
Oh, I love

[Outro: tobyMac]
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me, hold me, hold me
