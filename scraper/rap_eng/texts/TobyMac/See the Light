[Verse 1]
I know this road is gettin' hard
I heard you say it's overwhelming
I said I'd never be too far
And I meant that from the heart

[Verse 2]
I see the mountain gettin' higher
I see it stackin' up against you
I always said you were a fighter
But you've got your doubts tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm here to remind you
It don't matter where you come from
I know we can get through this
It might feel it's been so long
But we keep on keepin' on (Keepin' on)
It might feel like an uphill climb
Always some kind of battle (Battle)
But you got more than you on your side

[Chorus]
And we gon' see the light (See the light)
We gon' see the light (See the light)
We gon' see the light (See the light)
You and me, yeah, you and me
We gon' see the light

[Verse 3]
Some things will never be the same
Some things are only for a season (Season)
And just the thought of letting go
Well, it's brought you to your knees (To your knees, to your knees)

[Verse 4]
Oh, but if you can make it, you can make it through the ni-ight
I can promise that the sun is gonna ri-ise
You wake up just a little bit stronger
So hold on just a little bit longer

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it don't matter where you come from
I know we can get through this (Ooh)
It might feel like it's been so long
But we keep on keepin' on (Keepin' on) (Ooh)
It might feel like an uphill climb
Always some kind of battle (Battle)
But you got more than you on your side

[Chorus]
And we gon' see the light (See the light)
We gon' see the light (See the light)
We gon' see the light (See the light)
You and me, yeah, you and me
We gon' see the light (We gon' see)
We gon' see the light (See the light)
We gon' see the light (Ho, ah-oh ah-oh ah-oh)
You and me, yeah, you and me (You and me)

[Bridge]
So go on and lift your hands up to where your help is comin' from
And let your burdens, let 'em fade away (Fade away, fade away)
So go on and lift your hands up to where your help is comin' from
And let your burdens, let 'em fade away
(We gon' see the light, we gon' see the light)
So go on and lift your hands up to where your help is comin' from
(We gon' see the light, we gon' see the light)
And let your burdens, let 'em fade away
(We gon' see the light)
So go on and lift your hands up to where your help is comin' from
And let your burdens, let 'em fade away

[Outro]
'Cause it don't matter where you come from
I know we can get through this
You got more than you on your side
And we gon' see the light
We gon' see the light
