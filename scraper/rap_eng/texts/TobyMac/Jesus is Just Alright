[Hook]
Jesus is still alright with me
Jesus is still alright, oh yeah
Jesus is still alright with me
Jesus is still alright

[Verse 1]
Toby Mac, and the Mac is back no slack
On a DC track that's jacked, beyond comprehension
I believe that I failed to mention
That there's a lack of recognition
When it comes to His position
Cause if Christ can't be crossed over
Then I'll keep my beat up nova

I don't care what they may say
I don't care what they may do
I don't care what they may say
Jesus is still alright

[Hook]
Jesus is still alright with me
Jesus is still alright, oh yeah
Jesus is still alright with me
Jesus is still alright

[Verse 2]
Back in place, and I'm all up in your face
With a rhyme that I embrace
Like a mother to her child
I'm kickin' it Jesus style
To the ones that think they heard
I did use the "J" word
Cause I ain't too soft to say it
Even if DJ's don't play it

Jesus is alright, I know
He's alright Jesus is alright, you know
He's alright Jesus is alright, we know
He's alright Jesus is alright, we know
He's alright

[Verse 3]
I'm down with the one that is known as the
Son Of the G to the O to the D never done
With the flow, in the know, on the go like a pro
Not for show cause I ain't in the biz for the dough
Or the me, or the ray, all the dough's gotta stay
Cause I can't, no I can't, take it home anyway
Never trite when I write cause the Lord is my light
And His Word is my bond so ya know, He's alright

[Hook]
