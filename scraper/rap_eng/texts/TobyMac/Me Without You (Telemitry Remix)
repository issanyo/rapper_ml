[Verse 1]
Raindrops rolling off my brim
Street lights got the pavement glistening
Touchdown, I fall into Your arms
Right where I belong, Your everlasting arms

[Hook]
And where would I be without You?
I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be buildin' my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without You
Without You
That's me without You
Don't know where I'd be without you

[Verse 2]
Flashback, stepping through the scene
There's You and there's a very different Me
Touchdown, You had me at believe
You had me at believe, You did

[Hook]
And where would I be without You?
Without You
I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be buildin' my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without You
Without You
That's me without You
Don't know where I'd be without you
That's me without You
Without You
That's me without You
Don't know where I'd be without you

[Bridge]
(Where would I be)
I was in deep
So incomplete
'Til you rescued me
Yeah, you rescued me

[Hook]
I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be buildin' my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without You
Without You
That's me without You
Don't know where I'd be without you
(That's me without You)
(That's me without You)
That's me without (You)
