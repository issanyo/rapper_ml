[Intro]
Man: Thiessen, I don't know about you
But I love this time of the year
Kid: Me too

[Verse 1: tobyMac]
I love the lights, the trees, the giant parades
I love the joy, I feel around the holidays
I love the snow that falls and covers the Earth
I love to sing songs of the Savior's birth
Can't wait for Christmas
Can't wait for Christmas
I love the way Main Street, looks at night
I love the sparkle that I see, in everybody's eyes
The claymation shows, take us back in time
And then we watch Elf, at a minimum twice
Can't wait for Christmas
Can't wait for Christmas
I love snow days (no school!)
We head to the hill
Pile three on a saucer, can bet on a spill
Stacking gloves on the furnace, at the end of the day
And as we sit by the fire, tell me who wouldn't say

[Chorus: Relient K]
Can't wait for Christmas
Can't wait for Christmas
'Cause when you think it's gonna end
It's coming back around again
Can't wait for Christmas
Can't wait for Christmas
Can't wait for Christmas
'Cause snow is falling everywhere
And love is always in the air
Can't wait for Christmas
(Can't wait for Christmas)
I can't wait for, Christmas
I can't wait for, Christmas
I can't wait for, Christmas!...

[Bridge: tobyMac & Relient K]
Snow is falling everywhere
Love is always in the air
I can't wait for, I can't wait for
I can't wait for...
(l can't wait for Christmas)
Snow is falling everywhere
Love is always in the air
I can't wait for, I can't wait for
I can't wait for, I can't wait for
I can't wait for, I can't wait for
I can't wait for, I can't wait for

[Verse: 2 tobyMac]
We awake to laughter, at the foot of our bed
Hold up some mistletoe, over my baby's head
Open the Good Book, and we turn to look
And read of love coming down, for me and for you

[Chorus: Relient K]
Can't wait for Christmas
Can't wait for Christmas
'Cause when you think it's gonna end
It's coming back around again
Can't wait for Christmas
Can't wait for Christmas
Can't wait for Christmas
'Cause snow is falling everywhere
And love is always in the air
Can't wait for Christmas

[Outro: tobyMac]
I can't wait for Christmas!
