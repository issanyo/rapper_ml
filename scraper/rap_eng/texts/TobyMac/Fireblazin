[Verse 1]
You came from heaven down to earth
And carried the weight of every pain and every hurt
Your life was a portrait of Your love
And like a beating drum now You are alive in us

[Chorus]
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
(2x)

[Verse 2:]
We are a city that believes
That when we're lost in You we find everything we need
So let our lives be a portrait of Your love
And just like the rising sun break out and shine through us

[Chorus]
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are

[Bridge]
You wreck us, You wreck us with Your love
And forever we are Yours, we are Yours
We are Yours
You wreck us, You wreck us with Your love
And forever we are Yours, we are Yours

[Chorus]
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
(2x)

[Bridge]
You wreck us, You wreck us with Your love
And forever we are Yours, we are Yours
We are Yours
You wreck us, You wreck us with Your love
And forever we are Yours, we are Yours
