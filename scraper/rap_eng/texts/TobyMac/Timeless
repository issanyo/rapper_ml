[Intro]
Welcome to the show, yeah!
Check it out, ya'll know what time it is
Back in the flesh (L.A. Symphony)
5-4-3-2-1
It goes like

[Verse 1]
You know who the crew is energetic, ruthless
Radio gonna play this til you're old and toothless
Even your mom like the L.A. Symph crew
More than just music life channeled through the binsu

Even if it ain't what you into we kick the essentials
Stainless and sinful, complex and simple
We're steady moving with our eyes on the prize
You're never gonna shake us we ain't them other guys

So we sock it to the brain then we spit it through mesh
I bring life to every word so they can penetrate flesh
It's like the key on a kite sparking thoughts to bring light
I threw caution to the wind and let my words take flight

You can forget the fads, you can forget the trends
I'm finding a meaning, a force that transcends
All culture, race, space and all of time
With others in my heart and there's peace in my mind

From birth til death
[?]
Above your view of the sky stands out weightless
Speak life to the breathless, [?]

I'm trying to make it in a world full of apathy
Asking God what else does He have for me
I'm timeless, I'm a beautiful mess
Through the joy and the pain the worst and best
I'm timeless (make it look like no other)
I'm timeless (over the years to advent)
I'm timeless (it's time tell me what to expect)
I'm timeless (everywhere [?])

[?], anger and violence
Racism, hate crimes, peace rallies and riots
Timeline it, find it without measure
And there you will find a little glimpse of forever

Hey yo we smile when we rap, ironic we walk
It's more than a moment, we live what we talk
So timeless you'll find us still doing our thing
Many moons from now, the Symph shall remain

It's that voice in your head speaking life to your thoughts
It's your mind over matter when it's money you ain't got
Through the highs and the lows, and the blows that life throws
It's the things that make you grow like when you reap what you sow

I'm praying for wisdom cause we all have influence
Somebody's watching me, making mental notes of my movements
It's not just music, it's my life and how I use it
Don't want to be foolish and leave my family clueless

[?] yo forever twenty one
Nevermind the time, remind myself there's plenty to be done
And when it's said and done and the music still remains
Musicians come and go but my legacy sustains

[Chorus]
I'm trying to make it in a world full of apathy
Asking God what else does He have for me
I'm timeless, I'm a beautiful mess
Through the joy and the pain through the worst and best
I'm timeless ([?])
I'm timeless (meant to be, written the history)
I'm timeless (simple words spoke here for clarity)
I'm timeless (take hip hop to new heights)

[Outro]
Time is less
Time is less
Time is less
Time is less

I'm timeless
Timeless
Yeah [?]
Time is less
