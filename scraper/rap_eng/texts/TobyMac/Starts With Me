[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
One day (One day, one day, one day, one day)
This nation will rise up (Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up)
Rise up (Rise up, rise up)

[Verse 1: TobyMac]
There's a million reasons to hesitate
With a history that’s filled with hate
Have we ever been united states? I wonder (Oh, oh, oh)
So who can blame us for the doubt?
Forgive me if I think out loud
But when justice just won't come around, you wonder (Wonder, wonder) (Oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus: TobyMac & Aaron Cole]
I was born with two (Two) dirty hands
Somethin' my daddy didn’t understand
Somethin' his daddy didn't understand
So it starts with me
And I was raised with distrust in my heart
Mama told me we're worlds apart
Her mama told her don't even bother
So it starts with me

[Chorus: TobyMac & Aaron Cole]
'Cause we can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
Let's try to fix the things that's been broke down
We can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
And it starts with me (Freedom)
’Cause we can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
Let’s try to fix the things that's been broke down
We can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
And it starts with me (Freedom)

[Verse 2: Aaron Cole]
With a heavy road in front of us
And a system that has lost our trust
Can we ever find the strength to rise from ashes? (Ashes) (Oh, oh, oh)
In lookin’ at the heart of it
The healing really can't begin
Without confession, and forgiveness, and compassion (Oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus: TobyMac & Aaron Cole]
I was born with two (two) dirty hands
Somethin' my daddy didn't understand
Somethin’ his daddy didn't understand
So it starts with me
And I was raised with distrust in my heart
Mama told me we're worlds apart
Her mama told her don't even bother
So it starts with me

[Chorus: TobyMac & Aaron Cole]
'Cause we can be free, yeah, yeah I know that (Oh, oh, oh)
Let's try to fix the things that's been broken
We can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
And it starts with me (Freedom)
'Cause we can be free, yeah, yeah I know that (Oh, oh, oh)
Let's try to fix the things that's been broken
We can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
And it starts with me (Freedom)

[Break: Martin Luther King Jr.]
One day (One day, one day, one day, one day)
This nation will rise up (Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up) (Freedom)
Rise up (Rise up, rise up) (Freedom)

[Bridge: TobyMac & Aaron Cole]
Can you feel it in your heart tonight? (Freedom)
Love is gonna move the needle (Freedom)
I can feel it in my heart tonight (Freedom)
Oh yeah
Can you feel it in your heart tonight? (Freedom)
Love is gonna move the needle (Freedom)
I can feel it in my heart tonight (Freedom)
Oh yeah
Can you feel it in your heart tonight? (Freedom)
(Can you feel it in your heart tonight?)
Love is gonna move the needle (Freedom)
(Love is gonna move the needle)
I can feel it in my heart tonight (Freedom)
(I can feel it in my heart tonight)

[Refrain: TobyMac & Aaron Cole]
I need you, you need me
One more step, we're almost free (Almost free, almost free)
Said I need you, and you need me
Father give us eyes to see (Hey, aye, yeah, give us eyes to see)

[Chorus: TobyMac & Aaron Cole]
'Cause we can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
Let's try to fix the things that's been broken
We can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
And it starts with me (Freedom)
'Cause we can be free, yeah, yeah I know that (Oh, oh, oh)
Let's try to fix the things that's been broken
We can be free, yeah, yeah I know that
And it starts with me (Freedom)

[Outro: TobyMac & Aaron Cole]
This dream could set us free (Yeah, I know that)
This dream of you and me (Yeah, I know that)
We're one choice from together (Yeah, I know that)
And it starts with me (Yeah, I know that) (Freedom)
This dream could set us free (Yeah, I know that)
This dream of you and me (Yeah, I know that)
We're one choice from together (Yeah, I know that) (We can be free)
And it starts with me (Freedom)

(Yeah, I know that)
(Yeah, I know that)
(Yeah, I know that)

Now is the time (Now is the time)
