You know what I'm going through
I know this is true
Cause you stood in my shoes
Desires inside of me
It's hard to believe
In what you cannot have seen

Can you catch the wind?
See a breeze?
It's presence which you feel by the leaves of a tree
An image of my faith in the old TV

In my mind's eye
I see your patience
Smile as you show me grace
In my mind's eye
You take my hand
We walk through foreign lands
Foreign lands of love
In my mind's eye (x4)

In my mind I'm where I belong
As I rest in your arms
And like a child I hold onto you
In my moment of truth
I hold onto you
Yes I do
We can ride the storm
Into the pain
You comfort me in my hurricane
And I will never be alone again

In my minds eye
I see your face
You smile as you show me grace
In my minds eye
You take my hand
We walk through foreign lands
The foreign lands of love
In my minds eye (x4)

In my mind I can see your face
Love poured down in a shower of grace
Life is a gift that you chose to give
I believe we eternally live
They don't know you like I do
You're the one I live to pursue

Can you see God? Have you ever seen him?
I've never seen the wind
I've seen the effects of the wind but never the wind
There's a mystery here

In my minds eye
I see your face
You smile as you show me grace
In my mind's eye
You take my hand
We walk through foreign lands
The foreign lands of love
In my minds eye (x4)
