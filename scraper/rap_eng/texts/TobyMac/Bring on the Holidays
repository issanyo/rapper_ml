[Verse 1]
Come on baby let's not fight
I'm gonna catch the early flight
Before our streets our dressed in white, I'll be there
And please don't decorate the tree
Have a little heart and wait for me
I love the night especially, I'll be there

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause this is the season I love
Yeah, this is the season for love

[Chorus 1]
I love the holidays
Never too far away
Cause no matter where I go
I find my way back home
So happy holidays
Oh, happy holidays

[Verse 2]
Cause this is the season I love
Yeah, I still believe in, in love

[Chorus 1]
I love the holidays
Never too far away
Cause no matter where I go
I find my way back home
So happy holidays
Oh, happy holidays

[Bridge]
So come on baby let's not fight
It's Christmas Eve tomorrow night
Before the streets are dressed in white, I'll be there
To celebrate our savior's birth
And we will pray for peace on earth
It's Christmas all around the world

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I love the holidays
No matter where I go
Baby I'm coming home

[Chorus 3]
So bring on the holidays
Never too far away
Cause no matter where I go
Oh, I find my way back home
So happy holidays
Oh, happy holidays
Bring on the holidays
So happy holidays
