[Intro: TobyMac]
Clap your hands, everybody
Everybody just clap your hands
Clap your hands, everybody
Everybody just clap your hands
Clap your hands, everybody
Everybody just clap your hands
Clap your hands, everybody
Everybody just clap your hands

You gotta step to it
C'mon, step to it
You gotta step to it
C'mon, step to it

[Verse 1: Peter Furler (TobyMac)]
You don't understand
This is not what you think it is
You don't get it man
(You don't get it)
You want to boil it down to show biz
Your in-depth research shows
(It shows nothing)
Drop the God, emphasize the beat
I've heard that positive pop you dig
I'd rather be buried in wet concrete

[Chorus: Peter Furler (TobyMac)]
Take back your free advice
I don't accept
(You gotta step to it)
I will not play those games
God is not a secret to be kept (to be kept)
God is not a secret to be kept (to be kept)

[Verse 2: Peter Furler (TobyMac)]
You don't understand
I'm not talking multiple choice
You don't get it man
(You don't get it)
If the cross offends you, find another voice
I am not running for office here
(I ain't Clinton)
I won't keep it purposefully vague
I've heard New Age life-force trip
I'd rather be dipped in bubonic plague

[Chorus: Peter Furler (TobyMac)]
Take back your free advice
I don't accept
(You gotta step to it)
I will not play those games
God is not a secret to be kept (to be kept)
God is not a secret to be kept (to be kept)

If we keep silent
If we mass defect
(You gotta step to it)
These very rocks will scream
God is not a secret to be kept
God is not a secret to be kept

[Bridge: TobyMac]
Faith ain't easy to understand
When a bird in the bush beats two in the hand
But the truth ain't nothing to taste and hide
You gotta get up, put up
Get off your backside

I said faith ain't easy to understand
When a bird in the bush beats two in the hand
But truth ain't nothing to hide
You gotta get up, put up
Get off your backside
Get up, put up
Get off your backside

[Chorus: Peter Furler (TobyMac)]
Take back your free advice
I don't accept
(You gotta step to it)
I will not play those games
God is not a secret to be kept (to be kept)
God is not a secret to be kept (to be kept)

If we keep silent
If we mass defect
(I'm gonna step to it)
These very rocks will scream
God is not a secret to be kept
God is not a secret to be kept
God is not a secret to be kept
God is not a secret to be kept

(Got nothing to hide)
