(chorus)
Priase Him
Praise Him
Voices raisin'
Priase Him
Praise Him
Voices raisin'

Praise Him, my friend, cause He sits on high
He's the Lord God almighty so don't ask why
Just worship Him, adore Him, and sing this praise
Ignite it, don't fight it, light it, leave it ablaze
Let it burn in your heart, stir in your soul
Proclaim honor to the Father as your lifelong goal
So sing allelujah and let the Word ring
Praise Him, voices raise Him as we worship the King

(repeat chorus)
When we praise, we raise the mighty name of the King
We're born again, y'all, we got a song to sing
He died, He's our guide, and we call Him Christ
A man, a hill, a cross and a price
The King of Kings, Rose of Sharon, the Savior of men
He's the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and End
The sure Lord of Lords, the Creator on high
Praise Him, voices raisin' as it rings in the sky

(repeat chorus)
Praise, let's raise the roof tonight
We're children of the Lord, we're soldiers of light
Rejoice, let's voice His name on high
For He has given us all the gift of life

(bridge)
Let everything that has breath
Praise Him
Praise Him
In one accord unto the Lord
Praise Him

Allelu, do the do and begin to rejoice
Sing aloud, y'all, make a joyful noise
Young David used to rave it when he played on his harp
He wrote the Psalms, a book of songs from His heart
Two thousand years later still a craze to praise
Not a phase, stand amazed at the infinate blaze
It's eternal, that's a fact, and I use rap
To bring glory mandatory cause the King will be back

(repeat chorus)
