Well it started out in the spare bedroom
Two turned tables uh and a microphone
I was flipping over 33's
Working on rhymes and melodies
Searching for some more of You
(and little less of me)

It's never been my dream
To see my face in magazines
It's always been about the music
Hoping God would use it
To set some people free

But I can say without a doubt
I never had it figured out
Lord you've opened every door
I've stepped through yea
And I try to keep my head about me
I'm thankful for the friends around me
I'm thankful for You yeah
I'm thankful for You

I've been on this road
But you come to my shows
Sometimes just a few of y'all
(other times in troops)

But you've been right there to rock with us
We come together, we lift Him up
Seeing You there inspires me, put Your fire in me

It's never been my dream
To read my name in magazines
It's always been about the music
Praying God would use it to set some people free

But I can say without a doubt
I never had it figured out
Lord you've opened every door
I've stepped through yea
And I try to keep my head about me
So thankful for the friends around me
I'm thankful for You yeah
I'm thankful for You yeah
I'm thankful for You

It's such a free feeling that You got me feeling
We're all good all good all good
I love this free feeling that You got me feeling
We're all good all good all good
Said I love that free feeling
That You got me feeling
We're all good all good all good

Yea
They say you become who you hang out with
Well I can tell you for sure
You made me a better man

And I can say without a doubt
I never had it figured out
Lord you've opened every door
I've stepped through yea
And I try to keep my head about me
So thankful for the friends around me
I'm thankful for You yeah
I'm thankful for You yeah
I'm thankful for You

Thankful for You
Thankful for You

That's it
