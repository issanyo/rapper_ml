[Intro: Tree Giants & Hollyn]
Ooh, girl, whatcha feel
Tell me just a little bit about your deal
I said ooh girl
Give us a little bit about you, Hollyn

[Verse 1: Hollyn]
They say having fame is a fortune
But lately, I don't think it's that important
Expectations trying to captivate 'em
But what I'm doing ain't what they used to
Yeah I used to daydream in English
Chasing down songs instead of working on my thesis
I've done so much in a year and a half
Standing in wonder how I got where I'm at
And friends who knew me in the eighth grade
Still, treat me like I'm in the eighth grade
And friends that see me on the main stage
Won't say what they sayin' to my face
Nobody knows, nobody sees
The real me
Does anybody knows, does anybody see

[Hook: Tree Giants ]
Ooh, girl, whatcha feel
Tell me just a little bit about your deal
I said ooh girl
Give us a little bit about you, Hollyn

[Bridge: Tree Giants]
Come and let us get to know ya
We can hardly wait to know ya
But you'll probably say, "I'll just tell ya later"

[Verse 2: Hollyn]
I won't lie
It's lonely at night when I turn out the lights
But I don't mind
'Cause doing what you love's a sacrifice
And I see clearly, And I got you near me
And I love that you made me to do
What I love to do
Soaking in all of you
Soaking in all of you
The view is nice from right here

[Hook: Tree Giants]
Ooh, girl, whatcha feel
Tell me just a little bit about your deal
I said ooh girl
Give us a little bit about you, Hollyn

[Outro: Hollyn & Tree Giants]
What's next
One step
At a time
Enjoy the ride
