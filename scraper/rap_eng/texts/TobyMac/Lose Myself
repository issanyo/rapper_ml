Take all of the good and all of the bad
'Cause all of it's on me
Take all of my ways, the things that I chase
The things that control me

And all that I hide, could you bring me to life?
Could you open my eyes and show me?
Take all that was me and shape it to be
Reflecting you solely

I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find you
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find you

I don't care how it sounds
Burn it up to the ground
Your kingdom, my desire
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find
To find you
(I need to find you/I need to find you)

As all of the fates, I'll be on my way
The wreckage behind me
My feet on the ground, Two hands reaching out
The future is blinding

So what is stirring in you? May you stir up in me
All the dreams that you placed inside me
Take all that you see and shape it to be
The story you're writing

I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find you
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find you

I don't care how it sounds
Burn it all to the ground
Consume me with your fire
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find
To find you

I need to find you...
I need to find you...
I need to find you...

I need to find you...
I need to find you...
I need to find you...

So do not hide your face from me
Do not hide your face
Do not hide your face from me
Please don't hide

I'm gonna lose myself, lose myself to find
To find you
I need to find you...
I need to find you...
I need to find you...
I need to find you...

So do not hide your face from me
Do not hide
So do not hide your face from me
Do not hide

I need to find you..

So do not hide your face from me
Do not hide
So do not hide your face from me
Do not hide

So do not hide your face from me
Please don't hide your face
