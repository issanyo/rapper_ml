You ain't got nothing left to prove today
Unlikely heroes from around the way
Come back tomorrow and we'll save the day
It's on me, it's on you
So tell me what we gonna do?
Tell me what we gonna do, what you wanna do?
About to drop us like a habit
The future's ours if we just grab it
Don't need no clutch, it's automatic
We just can't ignore what we came here for
It's only fear that would prevent us
All that we need is deep within us
They've just started something we're gonna finish
And we can't ignore what we came here for
You ain't got nothing left to prove today
Unlikely heroes from around the way
Come back tomorrow and we'll save the day
It's on me it's on you
So tell me what we gonna do?
Tell me what we gonna do
What you gonna do?
I'm moving these shoes like monopoly
Ain't ever gonna count what it's costing me
We run the show about twenty below
From the Banks and the Grille to the streets of SoHo
I'm moving these shoes like monopoly
Ain't ever gonna count what it's costing me
Say we run the show about 20 below
From the Banks and the Brille to the streets of SoHo
It's our time to shine, we gonna do it right
It's our time to blind them, we gonna do it right now
It's our time to shine
We gonna do it right
And we can't ignore what we came here for
You ain't got nothing left to prove today
Unlikely heroes from around the way
Come back tomorrow and we'll save the day
It's on me, it's on you so tell me what we gonna do
You ain't got nothing left to prove today
Unlikely heroes from around the way
Come back tomorrow and we'll save the day
It's on me, it's on you so tell me what we gonna do
Tell me what we gonna do
It's our time to shine, tell me what we gonna do
It's our time to shine
