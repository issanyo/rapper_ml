[Verse 1]
Start it up
Turn it on
We can ride this storm
A grip of hope in our hands
For the coming dawn
Up to our necks in complexities
Causing us to pause
As we collect our thoughts

[Pre-Hook]
So don't blink when you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'till we see the morning
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits

[Hook]
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition

(uh-oh uh-oh) x2

[Verse 2]
Comatose
Half-hearted
Room temperatures fine
Sleep walking', no dream is even fillin' our minds
Earth shakin'
We be quakin' like a wake up bomb
This ain't no trouble overseas
No Vietnam

[Pre-Hook]
So don't blink when you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'till we see the morning
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits
Take it up a notch
Take it up a notch

[Hook]
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition

[Bridge]
Sleep walkin'
I'm sleep walkin'
Sleep walkin'
I'm still talkin'
Come spark the parts in me that all but died, died, died
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside, inside, inside
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
Hold up the flag cause it's ride or die
Hold up the flag cause it's ride or die

Turn on the ignition, turn on
Turn on the ignition, turn on
Turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Hook]
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Turn on the ignition
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Turn on the ignition
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
Turn on
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Turn on
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
