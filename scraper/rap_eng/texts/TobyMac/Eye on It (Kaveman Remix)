Eye on it, eye on it
Eye on it, eye on it
Eye on it
Eye on it
Eye on it, eye on it
I set my eyes to the west, walking away from it all
Reaching for what lies ahead, I got my eye on it
I see my sweat hit the ground
I put my foot in the block
This is the race of my life
And I can't wait for this shot
'Cause I can feel the wind at my back
Chest is pumping like a heart attack
Feet are moving and my mind is locked
Pressing on with everything I got
I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
Eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize and I will not quit
I've got a new passenger to help me navigate the way
So when my heart hits the floor I can re-calibrate
I feel the deeper call in me, all else is fading in the past
So let me run in the race that I know is built last
'Cause I can feel the wind at my back
Chest is pumping like a heart attack
Feet are moving and my mind is locked
Pressing on, I gotta take my shot
I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
Eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize and I will not quit
I will not quit
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize, I've got my eye on it
I've got my eye on the prize and I will not quit
