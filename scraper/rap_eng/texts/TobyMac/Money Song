[Joey The Jerk]
Yes, Yes You don't even understand me
What I'm going through right now
In my lifetime. Yep Yep
Show me the hey hey, yo yo

I need money but not just me but for the fam
If I don't bring home the bacon, you say I ain't the man
Jehovah Jira he's the great I am
And I've been praying and believing for three hundred grand
I'm great with the pen but I suck with the plan
My money running out like some cheating husband
I'm so broke and dope I'm a great has been
I'm a crying man, trying to find fifteen cents

[CookBook]
You could be as good as the best of them or as bad as worst
You can be bronze and broke or platinum and still thirst
You could be perceived a success with a pentium brain
Signing your name for your fans without a penny to your name
You know how I know? That's where I stand everyday
Don't know weather to sit, stand, or run away
Should I pray, put my gun away, or get thugged out?
Jesus or G's up these thoughts got me bugged out

[Hook]
Now here we go again, the usual predicament
No means to an end the debt I can't get rid of it
A money song again can't it be a different subject?
When it come to being broke it's the usual suspects

Now here we go again, the usual predicament
No means to an end the debt I can't get rid of it
A money song again can't a different subject?
When it come to being broke it's the usual suspects

[Flynn ADAM]
I can't borrow a dollar without paying back seven
I'm worth more dead than alive cause at least I'm in heaven and
Everything you hear about in songs I don't possess
Cause truth rests on my chest and won't let me invest in
Anything conterfeit, contrived or pretentious
Or happens to jive with worlds consensus
I'm an odd man out trying to break even
Stuck in the negative for positive believing

[Sharlok Poems]
Chasing the all mighty dollar sign still way far behind
Stay at my house cash flow effect my hang time
Exchange rhymes with customers getting CD's signed
My signature will cost you a hundred dimes
One for the mind, how 'bout one for my pocket
One hundred grand crammed hard in my wallet
Any form of work it seems I just don't got it
Never have so I guess that I can just do without it

[UNO Mas]
The more some things change the more they stay the same
You can claim a little fame but still be losing the game
What's the cost of building a name? Being broke as a joke
I need a permanent vacation like a pig in a poke
You invoke a state of mind that as free as a bird
But I'mma live in Downtown just a part of the herd
It's like Groundhogs Day and I done seen it before
So God you gots to help me, I can't take it anymore

[Hook]

It's the Money Song ya'll (put a dollar in the sky)
Another Money Song ya'll (buy low, sell high)
It's the Money Song ya'll (yes it's time to sell out)
Another Money Song ya'll (borrow a dollar to bail out)
