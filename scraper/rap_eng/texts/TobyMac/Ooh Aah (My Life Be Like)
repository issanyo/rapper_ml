[Intro]
My life be like
Ooh Aah (yeah), Ooh Ooh
My life be like (yeah)
Ooh Aah, Ooh Aah (yeah), Ooh Ooh
Ooh Aah (yeah), Ooh Ooh
My life be like (yeah)
Ooh Aah, Ooh Aah (yeah), Ooh Ooh
My life be like (yeah)

[Chorus]
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me please come my way
Leaving bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

[Verse 1: Coffee]
I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded
Low key and staying candid
Reflect on all the things I try my hand at
Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
A mountainous fountain, spinning and monsooning
Grinning it's high octane, explosive how I came
Rolling down hills cause life's a hassle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat, catch a second wind, thin is the air I breathe
Teary eyed, nose running, wipe the snot on my sleeve
I'm calling on the Savior to be all that I need
Please forgive me, my behavior had me lost at light speed

[Chorus]
My Life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me please come my way
Leaving bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

[Verse 2: Bonafide]
The fear of never falling in love, and the tears after losing the feelings of what you thought love was
Like the dirt still up under the rug (My life be like)
Bad characteristics covered in Christ's blood
The joy of new birth and the pain of growing up
The bliss between giving my all and giving up
The highs and lows, paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze, trying to ease my woes
In this world of sin, clothes too thin to fend
So to God I send, words of help to win
In grumblings so deep letters could never express
So the sound of Ooh Aah beneath my breath projects

[Chorus]
My life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me please come my way
Leaving bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

[Verse 3: TobyMac]
(TobyMac)
My life be like ooh aah ooh, dum dum ditty
Here come that boy from the Capitol City
Last up on the Grits new ditty
But eight bars of the truth will do (uh)
I believe there's a bride that's stunning
And I believe in the Kingdom Coming
I believe if you seek the Truth
You don't need to look far cause it's gonna find you
So why, oh why, do I trip and stumble?
And ooh aah as commitment crumbles?
I can't believe that I'm here again....

[Chorus]
My life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me please come my way
Leaving bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do
My life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if you see me please come my way
Leaving bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

[Outro]
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
My life be like
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
My life be like
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
My life be like
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip
My life be like
