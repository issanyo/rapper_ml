[Verse 1: Hollyn]
Fell for you first day that I met you
Never dreamed that I ever could forget you
But black and white make a mess when it turn to grey
Sunlight came sweeping 'cross the window
Rewind to the time when we were so close
Got me longin' for yesterday

[Pre-Chorus: Hollyn]
But Lord, you know me so well
I can be a little punk sometimes

[Chorus: Hollyn]
But don't leave me, leave me alone
Bust down the door to my heart like it's your home
Don't need no keys
I'm on my knees begging you please
I gotta settle this thing once and for all
You got my heart, my soul
You can have it all
I'm on my knees begging you please
Beggin' you please, Lord
Don't leave me alone

[Verse 2: Hollyn]
Through the tears, through the pain comes a new day
Blown away, still amazed you pursue me
Ain't no limit to the way you love (don't stop)
Lord I need You like a heartbeat (concrete)
Rock solid under my feet
And you're calling me, you're calling me up

[Pre-Chorus: Hollyn]
Cause you know me so well
And I can be a little punk sometimes

[Chorus: Hollyn]
But don't leave me, leave me alone
Bust down the door to my heart like it's your home
Don't need no keys
I'm on my knees begging you please
I gotta settle this thing once and for all
You got my heart, my soul
You can have it all
I'm on my knees begging you please
Beggin' you please, Lord
Don't leave me alone

[Bridge: shiloh]
I said you had me in your arms but I fell through the grasp
And yep, I had you in my heart but I guess I relapsed
Like I'm livin' for the wrong reasons, through the seasons
Tryna fall for you but then they put me on blast
It's like I try to speak my mind because I know that I'm His
And, yep, I try to speak my mind but it don't fly with them kids
Man if I'm not talking 'bout the newest Nikes or releases
They put the mute on me
I can't speak about my Jesus?
Like I'm living for Him, I'm slipping to sin
I turn around and make the amends, I try to fit in
I mess it up and stumble again, I'm takin' this pen
And writin' everything so I remember just how sweet that it is
Yeah, man, I got issues, I can't even lie
My only savin' grace is knowin' I got you inside
I'm done with savin' face, I don't got a thing to hide
So don't leave me alone
Keep comin' day and night

[Chorus: Hollyn]
But don't leave me, leave me alone
Bust down the door to my heart like it's your home
You don't need no keys
I'm on my knees begging you please
I've gotta settle this thing once and for all
You got my heart, my soul
You can have it all
I'm on my knees begging you please
Beggin' you please, Lord
I'm on my knees begging you please
Begging you please, Lord
Don't leave me alone
