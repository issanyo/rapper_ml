I’ve heard life is like a box of sweet delights
But in reality every day is a fight
So we hold on to the promise that things happen for reasons
We may not understand it but faith keeps us believin’

And I know that we can make it
With faith in our hearts we can face it
Any mountain that comes our way we can move

(Chorus)
There’s never a right time to get up and live life
You only got one try (andale, andale)
So take what you’ve been given and
Make time to turn someone’s day bright
And change how we live life (andale, andale)

The future’s what we make it so let’s go (to the beat ya'll)
So let’s go (to the beat ya'll)
So let’s go (one life, one world ya’ll)
(x2)

The future’s what we make it so let’s go

We in a time when sun don’t shine in all places
Typically nose to the grind just to make it
Take the same old, see the same faces
Sayin’ it’s the hand we’ve been dealt so we take it
But if life’s what we make it
I’ma turn the world around, make the poor people famous
Make the B the new A list
Give your Facebook page a new facelift
And every status you post will compliment who you are
The whole world’s dark while you shine like a star
Then bring hatred to an end
And watch the honor of our generation come alive again

There’s never a right time to get up and live life
You only got one try (andale, andale)
So take what you’ve been given and
Make time to turn someone’s day bright
And change how we live life (andale, andale)

The future’s what we make it
