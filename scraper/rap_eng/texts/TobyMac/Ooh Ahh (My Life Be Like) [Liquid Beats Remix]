My life be like Ooh Ahh (yeah)
Ooooooh
My life be like Ooh Ahh, Ooh Ahh (yeah)
Ooooooh

CHORUS:
It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me please come my way
Leavin bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip
(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire by the things that i do

I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded
Low key and stayin candid
Reflectin on the things I try my hand at
Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Findin comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
A mountainous fontaine
Spinnin and monsoonin
Grinnin its high octane
This flow's how I came
Rollin down the hills cause lifes a hassle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat
Catch a second wind thin is the air I breathe
Teary-eyed nose runnin, wipe the snot on my sleeve
I'm callin on my savior to be all that I need
Please forgive me my behavior had me lost at light speed

CHORUS

The fear of never falling in love
And the tears after losing the feelings
Of what you thought love was
Like the dirt still up under the rug
(My life be like)
Bad characteristics covered in Christ's blood
The joy of new birth and the pain of growing up
The bliss between giving my all and giving up
The highs and lows
Paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze
Trying to ease my woes
In this world of sin
Clothes to thin to fend
So to God I send
Words of help to win
In grumblings so deep letters could never express
So the sounds of Ooh Ahh beneath my breath projects

CHORUS

(Toby Mac)

My life be like ooh aah ooh
Dum dum diddy
Here comes that boy from the capital city
Last up on the Grits new ditty
But eight bars of the truth will do, uhh
I believe there's a pride thats stunning
And I believe in the kingdom coming
I believe if you seek the truth
You don't need to look far cuz it's gonna find you

So why, oh why, do I trip and stumble?
And ooh ahh as commitments crumble?
I can't believe that I'm here again...'gain....'gain....

My life be like

CHORUS (x2)

(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
My life be like
(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
My life be like

(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
My life be like
(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
(flow fingertip flow fingertip)
My life be like
