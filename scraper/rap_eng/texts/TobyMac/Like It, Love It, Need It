[Verse 1:]
Under these circumstances, they can hardly cope
Notice their fleeting glances and their lack of hope
I offer this suggestion, they don't seem to care
This is my generation, drowning in despair

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
You'll never find peace of mind in your pool of self
You'll never find peace of mind in a sea of wealth
You'll never find peace of mind in your rock and roll
You'll never find peace of mind if you sell your soul

[Chorus:]
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some freedom from the strife
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some Jesus in your life
[Some Jesus in your life, some Jesus in your life]

[Verse 2:]
We circumvent our feelings through an angry sound
He who complains the loudest, wears the fattest crown
We're anti-everybody, call it paranoia
Well I ain't no judge or jury, but I'm praying for ya

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
You'll never find peace of mind in your lucky charm
You'll never find peace of mind on a hippie farm
You'll never find peace of mind in a one-night stand
You'll never find peace of mind in your superman

[Chorus:]
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some freedom from the strife
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some Jesus in your life
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some freedom from the strife
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some Jesus...

[Bridge:]
Ya dropped right into the middle of a freak attack
Cause we're back and we're comin' like that
Ya see we're lowerin' the boom in the middle of the tune
Cause the funk is always heavy where it's at
And while you're whining all the time
Never changing any minds
It is clear to see your lip has lost its button
Cause if ya take a think at this
Then it's easy to admit
That the selfish way you're livin' is for nothing

You gotta like it
You know you need some freedom from the strife
You gotta love it
You know you need some Jesus in your life

[Chorus:]
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need some freedom from the strife
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you need it...

[Outro:]
You gotta like it, you gotta love it
I know you, I know you need it
Some Jesus in your life
Jesus in your life
