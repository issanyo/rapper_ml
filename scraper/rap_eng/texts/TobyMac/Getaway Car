I said I need to get away. I gotta spend some time with you again, whoa

I'm staring unaware ‘cause I'm in the zone
It moves in like a fog on a seaside road
Paralyzed by the signs and the deafening tone
I'm on a lock like a jock with a broken bone
I can see the real game and I wanna get in it
I can read your headline and I’m dying to spin it
Man down in the clutches of his own desire
I gotta find the kind of speed that will put out a fire

I need a getaway car, I gotta get out of here fast and far
I need a getaway car, I wanna flee what I see, wanna be where you are
I need a getaway car, I gotta get out of here fast and far
I need a getaway car

I put my hand on the wheel before I change my mind
I put my foot to the floor and I start to fly
I keep my eyes on the road so I don't get spun around
To the nightmare I've been delivered from
It's a brand new day, I drove hard all night
I thank God for the sun as it starts to rise
I take a peek in the mirror and my past is gone
I'm feeling free as a bird with a new song

I need a getaway car, I gotta get out of here fast and far
I need a getaway car, I wanna flee what I see, wanna be where you are
I need a getaway car, I gotta get out of here fast and far
I need a getaway car

Now I ain’t gonna stop ‘till I find your peace
I gotta get to the place where it's you and me
So fill her up now, and let's roll
Gonna drive through the night ‘till you touch my soul
Said I ain’t gonna stop ‘till I find your peace
I gotta get to the place where you're all I need
So fill her up, let's roll
I'm gonna ride through the night ‘till you touch my soul

Rock the beat!

Let's ride all night, let's shift this thing into overdrive
Let's ride all night, let's shift this thing into overdrive
Let's ride all night, let's shift this thing into overdrive
Let's ride all night, let's shift this thing into overdrive
