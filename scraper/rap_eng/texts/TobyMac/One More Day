[Verse 1]
Got up before the alarm
Sunlight replacing the stars
Finding my phone in the dark
Putting my life on restart
So many places to go
Asking what's best? I don't know
Each hour's an hour You make
So I know it's gonna be straight

[Pre-Chorus]
One more day
I believe, I believe, I believe
That it's gonna be all ok with You

[Chorus]
And now, I got air to breathe
I'm awake, my heart is beating for You
Your love is all I need
Another day, I'm gonna live it for You
I'm giving thanks for another day
Giving thanks for another day (thank you for one more day)
I'm giving thanks for another day
Giving thanks for another day

[Verse 2]
No one can tell me what's next
Or just how much time I got left
Hourglass half full of sand
But I know it's all in Your hands
There is no me, only us
It's only in You I would trust yeah
Goodbye to fear and to doubt
Hello to Your love reaching out

[Pre-Chorus]
One more day
Wanna show, wanna show, wanna show
That I'm gonna go all the way with You

[Chorus]
And now, I got air to breathe
I'm awake, my heart is beating for You
Your love is all I need
Another day, I'm gonna live it for You
I'm giving thanks for another day
Giving thanks for another day (thank you for one more day)
I'm giving thanks for another day
Giving thanks for another day (thank you for one more day)
I'm giving thanks for another day
Giving thanks for another day (thank you for one more day)
I'm giving thanks for another day
Giving thanks for another day

[Bridge]
This heart so young, it's Yours, it's Yours
All of my days, my hours, their Yours, just Yours
This heart so young, it's Yours, it's Yours
All of my days, my hours, their Yours, just Yours

[Chorus]
And now, I got air to breathe
I'm awake, my heart is beating for You
Your love is all I need
Another day, I'm gonna live it for You
I'm giving thanks for another day
Giving thanks for another day (I just want to thank you)
I'm giving thanks for another day, giving thanks for another day
I'm giving thanks for another day, giving thanks for another day
I'm giving thanks for another day, giving thanks for another day Thank you for one more day
