And we're back...it's me
Your around-the-way girl
Rollin' through the night on the
Quiet Storm
Tonight is kinda special...
We got Toby Mckheen up in here
So let's get down to it
Now, Toby-
What's up?
In studying the landscape of your musical evolution
It appeared as though you were maturing beyond your
"so-called" rap years... (toby chuckles in background)
Now suddenly like a ghost from the past
You present the public with this....
Toby Mac CD??
