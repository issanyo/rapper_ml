Hush lil baby don't you cry, daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby
Everythings gonna be alright, the Lord's gonna answer ya prayer tonight
Hush lil baby don't you cry, daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby

[Verse 1]
Last night you had a dream you was the homecoming queen
Today you're 18, happy birthday Irene
Quit school, you had to drop out to raise your little child
(There doesn't seem to be anyone around!)
You got to reach up to touch rock bottom
The powers that be keep you downtrodden
Daughter of Zion, I heard your prayer
Just cast your cares and please beware of snakes
They come in all shapes and sizes
Tempt you, put scales on your eyelids
Don't waste your sorrows they give you strength tomorrow (Tomorrow?)
Your calvary's about to come so
Keep ya head up don't you ever let up
The storm will pass you'll be ready for the next one

[Pre-Hook]
(Hey, little girl, with the pressures of the world on your shoulders, don't say that it's over)

(I said hey, little girl, with the pressures of the world on your shoulders, don't say that it's over)

Everything's gonna be alright, the Lord's gonna answer your prayer tonight

[Verse 2]
Irene, I carried you when you was too weak to walk
I took to you when you gave your heart to God
Faithful and true, that's what I'll always be to you
Believe in you, believe in me and these mountains have to move
You have dreams and aspirations (Aspirations!)
I knew you before creation your foundations solid
I will build you a palace restore your soul
You'll be in for any challenge, many storms are on the way
You better sharpen your faith, count the cost
Take up your cross, and wear it everyday
Rest in me, and I will give you strength
Blessed is she, Irene, who seeks my face
