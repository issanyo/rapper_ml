[Verse 1]
Another cold night
Another Late Flight
It's almost show time, and Diverse City's waiting on me
We got a packed house, the crowd is calling out
They want the beat to drop, but what we really need is you

[Chorus]
If you wanna steal my show, I'll sit back and watch you go
If you got something to say, go on and take it away
Need you to steal my show, can't wait to watch you go-o-o-o
So take it away

[Verse 2]
So now the crowd is hype, that you showed up tonight
Anticipating, craving, something more than smoke and lights
So I'll step out the way, I'll give you center stage
Alright, Spotlight give 'em what they came for

[Chorus]
If you wanna steal my show, I'll sit back and watch you go
If you got something to say, go on and take it away
Need you to steal my show, can't wait to watch you go-o-o-o
So take it away

[Bridge 1]
When you arrive, we come to life
Our hearts collide, they're beating in the same time
You're comin' through, all eyes on you
Our hearts collide they're beating in the same time
Beating in the same time

[Half-Verse]
No matter who we are, no matter what we do
Every day we can choose to say

[Chorus]
If you wanna steal my show, I'll sit back and watch you go
If you got something to say, go on and take it away
Need you to steal my show, can't wait to watch you go-o-o-o
So take it away

[Bridge 2]
My Life, my friends, my heart, it's all yours, God, take it away, my dreams
My fears, my family, my career, take it away, it's all yours, God
Take it away, take it away, it's you I wanna live for

[Chorus]
If you wanna steal my show, I'll sit back and watch you go
If you got something to say, go on and take it away
Need you to steal my show, can't wait to watch you go-o-o-o
So take it away
