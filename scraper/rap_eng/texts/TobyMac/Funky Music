[Intro]
What's up
Ya yep yep yep yep yep
Ya yep yep yep yep yep

[Hook]
[?] the rhythm just won't do it
Let your guard down, dance to the music
You can do it, get loose to it
Feel the music, funky music (2x)

[Verse 1]
Haha, bum raps, bum tracks, what else do you need
The best in America? Yes indeed
A rap for white collar criminals locked up for greed
Eating gourmet meals, watching cable TV

I drive a black jeep, in the concrete jungle
Nike Dunks [?] punks, no I don't stumble
Gotta stay fresh, you know, SFTL
Strictly for the ladies and the Lord as well

[?] marvelous, downright outstanding (lose it)
Take what mommy and daddy gave you (move to it)
Slow music, move to it, do it, do it
[?] end up high and just clap to it

[Hook]
[?] the rhythm just won't do it
Let your guard down, dance to the music
You can do it, get loose to it
Feel the music, funky music (2x)

[Verse 2]
Sharlok Poems in your area, check him out
He's got the flow that everybody in town talking about
Blow 'em out like candles, competition is none
Rock the mic til death do me then call me dumb

Yo, slide around, slide around, to this rhythmic track
Ride about town right about now then come back
We bring it to the basics, dope beats, dope raps
We three kings bring gold to [?]

Everybody playing catch up, just follow me
On a journey to see a for real emcee
Can't nobody do it like the L.A. Symphony
All original eight, or five, or maybe three

[Hook]
[?] the rhythm just won't do it
Let your guard down, dance to the music
You can do it, get loose to it
Feel the music, funky music (2x)

[Verse]
Yo, hey yo we keep you on your toes, with flows and finesse
Quite frankly not concerned with learning the rest
Politics are shady, selfish and cold
So many people shady, it's getting so old

My brother breaking solid concrete block when him walk
Delivering art that come straight from the heart
Get smart dummy, money don't make the man
You're just an idiot with a couple of grand in your hand

I'm selling free keychains, watch a brother come up
Would ya'll like the [?], I got the African look
Eight years of making records never heard of me but
I'm still making records hanging out with such and such

[Hook]
[?] the rhythm just won't do it
Let your guard down, dance to the music
You can do it, get loose to it
Feel the music, funky music (2x)
