[Intro]
Rock, rock
Give me that rock
That hip, that rock
Give me that funky (funky funky)
Give me that funky (funky funky)

[Verse 1]
Yo stick it in red, we got the cred
No need to say what's already been said
Don't need to please when we got the proof
We be on our knees when we raise the roof
Cause we got the one pot mix of flavor
We got the funky Jesus blazer
No equal, diverse people
Come get it now, won't be a sequel

[Pre-Chorus]
None of that mumbo jumbo (mumbo jumbo)
Give me that hip hop funk soul (that funk soul)
Give me that funky Jesus music
Give me that soulful gumbo

[Chorus]
Give me that funky
Funky Jesus Music
Give me that hip, that rock, that funk and soul
Give me that juicy flow
Give me that funky
Funky Jesus Music
Give me that hip, that rock, that funk and soul
And watch this party grow
Let's go
Let's go

[Verse 2]
Look at them freaks, they fashion loud
Makin' that hotness, movin' that crowd
Bumpin' that jumk with a life injection
Sweet to the ears like the candy section
Is to the eyes, feels so fine
Passion that just won't subside
We got this winner's ball (hey!)
So check it out, gonna' watch 'em fall

[Pre-Chorus]
None of that mumbo jumbo
Give me that hip hop funk soul
Give me that funky Jesus music
Give me that soulful gumbo

[Chorus]
Give me that funky
Funky Jesus Music
Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul
Give me that juicy flow
Give me that funky
Funky Jesus Music
Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul
And watch this party grow
Let's go

[Verse 3]
From coast to coast this is the most
We got beats and rhymes and aftershows
We got funky people on the highs and lows
MC's like Wiggy, they call us pros
So, sure shot, I could take stock of this
I'll play the post in the b-boy bliss
See, we bum rush with no discussion
A red hot show with freak production

[Pre-Chorus]
None of that mumbo jumbo
Give me that hip hop funk soul
Give me that funky Jesus music
Give me that soulful gumbo

[Chorus]
Give me that funky
Funky Jesus Music
Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul
Give me that juicy flow
Give me that funky
Funky Jesus Music
Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul
And watch this party grow
Let's go
