[Intro]
Now when you're down and feelin' out
I know ya take it to the lord
But those times when ya got the clout
Do you take it to the lord?
When you're outta cash and ya rent is due
I know ya take it to the lord
But when you're livin' large and ya got the juice
Do ya take it to the mighty lord?

[Chorus]
Take it to the lord
Who ya take it to?
Take it to the lord y'all
Ya gotta take it to the lord
Take it to the lord
Who ya take it to?
Take it to the lord y'all
Ya gotta take it to the mighty lord

Ya tend to take it ta god when ya losin' grip
Ya got christ in ya heart, but ya livin' a trip
I mean, when ya got trouble, ya call his name
But, everybody prays when it comes ta pain
Or, when you're feelin' down and ya need a burst
Say a short prayer, read a bible verse
And then expect my father to honor that
Yo, the life thatcha livin' is straight up wack
Ya gotta

[Chorus]

Now this song ain't to dis your name
And it sure ain't to get me fame
I just gotta explain that it ain't no game
Call him when ya need him, then forget the name
Yo, that's lame, and I will proclaim
Stop usin' god for your personal gain
Cause in the end, you'll be left ta hang, boy
Check the word, it'll tell ya the same

[Chorus]

Ya need to take it ta god on the regular tip
When things go right, it seems that ya forget
That he wants your attention, he wants ya praise
Unsituational, regardless of days
It's a 24-7 type-a-sich at hand
Based upon grace, god's love for man
And he's ready and waitin', arms open wide
So take it ta god, cause he's on ya side
Ya gotta

[Chorus] - 2X

When you're down and feelin' out
Who ya take it to?
Even when you've got the clout ya need to
Take it to the lord
When you're out of cash, and your rent is due
Who ya take it to?
When you're livin' large and you've got the juice
Do you take it to the mighty lord?

Who ya take it to, who ya take it to, who ya take it to?
DC in the house
Who ya take it to, who ya take it to, who ya take it to?
Take it to the lord
Who ya take it to, who ya take it to, who ya take it to?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who ya take it to, who ya take it to, who ya take it to?
DC in the house
