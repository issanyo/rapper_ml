Father God, I am clay in Your hands
Help me to stay that way through all life's demands
'Cause they chip and they nag and they pull at me
And every little thing I make up my mind to be
Like I'm gonna be a daddy whose in the mix
And I'm gonna be a husband who stays legit
And I pray that I'm an artist to rise above
The road that is wide and filled with self love

Every thing that I see draws me
Though it's only in you that I can truly see
That it's a feast full of eyes - a low blow to purpose
And I'm a little kid at a three rink circus

I don't wanna gain the whole world! and lose my soul!
I don't wanna gain the whole world! and lose my soul!
Don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say

The paparazzi flashes and that they think that it's you
But they don't know that who you are is not what you do
True, we get it twisted when we peak at the charts
Yo before we part from the start where's your heart?
You a pimp, hustler? tell me what's your title
America has no more stores now we call them idols, you sit idle
While we teach prosperity
The first thing to prosper should be inside of me. We're free!
Not because of 22's on the range
But Christ came in range we said yes now we changed
Not the same even though I made a fall
Since I got the call, no more Saul, now I'm Paul

I don't wanna gain the whole world! and lose my soul!
Don't wanna walk away, let me hear the people say
