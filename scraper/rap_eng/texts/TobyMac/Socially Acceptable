[Intro]
(It's okay, it's all right)
(It's okay, it's all right)
Okay, here we go
DCT is in the house, boy

[Verse 1: Michael Tait]
Whatcha thinking, doing the things you do
Whose opinion are you listening to?
Justifying, you turn it all to gray
Synchronizing to society's ways

[Rap 1: TobyMac]
Society has gotten to be all outta whack
And don't bother with excuses, whether white or black
To blame it on a color won't get a result
Because history reveals to me how ethics were lost
In reality, our decency has taken a plunge
"In God We Trust" is an American pun
Funny how it happened so suddenly
Hey yo fellas, kick the melody

[Chorus]
Socially acceptable
It's okay
(Is it okay?)
It's all right
(Is it all right?)
Socially acceptable
It's okay
(Is it okay?)
In whose sight?
(Whose sight?)
Socially acceptable

[Verse 2: Kevin Max]
Times are changing, with morals in decay
Human rights have made the wrongs okay
Something's missing, and if you're asking me
I think that something is the G-O-D

[Rap 2: TobyMac]
To label wrong or right by the people's sight
Is like going to a loser to ask advice
And by basing your plans on another man's way of living life
Is creating a brand of ethics sure to be missing the punch
No-count morals that are out to lunch
They're sliding away 'cause everything is okay
It was taboo back then, but today you say, "what the hey?"

[Chorus]
Socially acceptable
It's okay
(Is it okay?)
It's all right
(Is it all right?)
Socially acceptable
It's okay
(Is it okay?)
In whose sight?
(Whose sight?)
Socially acceptable
Socially acceptable
It's okay
(Is it okay?)
It's all right
(Is it all right?)
Socially acceptable

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here we go, here we go
A come on, a come on
Here we go, here we go
A come on, a come on
Here we go, here we go
A come on, a come on
Here we go, here we go
A come on, a come on
Everybody's doing it
Who's doing it?
Everybody's doing it
Yo, who's doing it?
Everybody's doing it
Who's doing it?
Everybody's doing it?
Yo, yo, yo, who's doing it?
Oh, alright
Oh, come on

[Rap 3: TobyMac]
We gotta back to the principles found in the word
A little G-O-D could be society's cure
From the state that we're in cause again we're slipping
So pray for america cause time is ticking

[Chorus]
Socially acceptable
It's okay
It's all right
Socially acceptable
It's okay
In whose sight?
Socially acceptable
Socially acceptable
It's okay
(Everybody's doing it)
It's all right
(Everybody's doing it)
Socially acceptable
It's okay
(It's okay)
In whose sight?
(All right)

[Outro]
Socially acceptable
Socially respectable
Socially acceptable
Socially respectable
