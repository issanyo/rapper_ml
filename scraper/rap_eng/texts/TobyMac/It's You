[Verse 1]
Lookin' for a way out, for a way out
I was so caught up that I couldn’t find a way out
Find a way out, yeah
Playin' through my weakness, can I beat this?
Can I crack this surface?
Into to the deepness, the deepness
Oh, where I've exhausted all my ways, all my ways
And all the noise begins to fade

[Chorus]
It’s You
Then everything else just falls in line
You
You will always hold this heart of mine
It's You, it's You
Lord, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

[Verse 2]
I’m into the newness, the new bliss (Bliss)
Me and You together, tell me how to loop this, to loop this-this-this-this-this
To go on forever, road of crescendo, goodbye limbo
Like a new day dawnin’, show me the window, the window

[Chorus]
Where I can see it's You
Then everything else just falls in line
You
You will always hold this heart of mine
It’s You (You), it's You (You)
Lord, it's You (You)
Then everything else just falls in line
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
It's You (You), it’s You (You)
Then everything else just falls in line
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
It's You (You), it's You (You)
Then everything else just falls in line

[Bridge]
Don't make no sense without You (Without You)
Don't make no sense at all (No sense at all)
Don't make no sense without You (Without You)
Don't make no sense at all (No sense at all, no sense at all)
It don't make no sense without You
It don't make no sense at all (No sense at all)
Don't make no sense without You
Don't make no sense at all (No sense at all)
I can't do this life without You
I can't do this life at all (This life at all)
It don't make no sense without You
It don't make no sense at all (No sense at all)

[Chorus]
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
It's You (You, You, You)
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
It's You (You, You, You)
Then everything else just falls in line
You (You)
You will always hold this heart of mine
It's You (You), it's You (You)
Lord, it's You (You)
Then everything else just falls in line

[Outro]
Ain't no one else
Ain't no one else will do
It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line
Ain't no one else
Ain't no one else will do
It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line
Don't make no sense without You
(Ain't no one else, ain't no one else will do)
Don't make no sense at all
(It's You, it's You)
Don't make no sense without You
(Ain't no one else, ain't no one else will do)
Don't make no sense at all
(It's You, it's You)
