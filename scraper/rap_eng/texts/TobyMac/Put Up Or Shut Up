[Sharlok Poems]
Never hold it, your tongue that is
Speak on it, tell like it is
On the ears of the deaf, let your words live
A piece of your mind with thoughts in side give

[Flynn ADAM]
And don't forget to live like this could be your last
Dance, chance, or written paragraph
So push the pedal to the metal, rock medallions if you wish
Just never underestimate the effects of death's kiss

[Sharlok Poems]
Leather bracelet on my wrist, fist bald up tight
Ready to fight the power to uphold my rights
Speak strong like Malcolm, Martin Luther, and Fredrick
End up on the triple K's next to hang list
I say this with force blow a grown man down
With two hands tearing down barriers of sound
Let the truth be found through book and voice told
As stone in raging water on your word stand bold

[Hook]
Put or shut up, lay down or get up
Push on, stand strong or give up
Say what you feel but don't say nothing
Just know that nothing will never produce something
Put or shut up, lay down or get up
Push on, stand strong or give up
Say what you feel but don't say nothing
Just know that nothing will never produce something

[Flynn ADAM]
Anything can be said, it's all in your approach
Grace is the key and it's never used by most
Neither is wisdom, we prefer to stay dumb
Entertained by idiots, and we just praise them

[Sharlok Poems]
Think or say them, good or bad words
Don't say nothing, you'll never be heard
Speak your own words, not his and hers
You’re just another mocking bird, repeating what's heard

[Flynn ADAM]
Hey I'm an oddball, a freak, an artist, a misfit
I stand out like a giant in a room full of midgets
I travel as a nomad where music is my trade
And rock in spots you've never heard and chart in CMJ
But at least I'm living outside the Matrix
Doing what I love even though I haven't made it
I'm faithful with the little, yes you reap what you sow
So here's another flyer, uh huh, another show

[Hook]

[Joey The Jerk]
Don’t be intimidated, fools try to act hard
Or cater to crybabies who’s emotionally scared
Manipulating situations, acting impatient
Put you in a corner, pointing fingers in your face
And saying anything just to get their way
Switching they pitch up, man you can’t trick me
Roll your eyes, pout, cry, throw a fit, like you’re two
I say what needs to be said even if its mean to you
