The showstopper!
The showstopper!
Yeah, this is the day we came to get down
We came to play the game in your town
You came to ride the highs of this junk
Baby, we came to guarantee the big crunk
So if you or your people ever wanna doubt
This showstoppin' party rockin'
Tell 'em all about this
Truth from the village of the diverse citizens
One stop one shot
Livin like a kid again
So turn off the lights
They've been waitin' all night
For the
The showstopper (stopper, stopper&)
The jaw dropper (dropper...)
The big papa
We gonna get it right (right)
We gonna get it good (good...)
The showstopper (stopper)
The jaw dropper (dropper)
The big papa
We gonna get it right, get it right
We gonna get it good (good, good, good, good&)
Hope just broke right through the door
So why you gotta ask what I came here for
Man we 'bout to light the night with that flare
Job from the gun in the hand of the spare
With the kick so hard that you gotta be strong
It's so hottah
You can barely hold on
So rock me drop me
But you will never stop me
From takin' this show to a full room of monopoly
So turn off the lights
Pass me the mic
Bring on the lights
You been waitin all night all night all night all night all night all night all night all night all night...
