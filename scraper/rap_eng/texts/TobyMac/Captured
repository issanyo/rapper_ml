All I wanna do
All I wanna do
I'm Your prisoner by choice
I will rest at Your feet
And I'll only lift my voice
When You want me to sing
It's the beauty of Your covering that's stealing my heart
And it's the mystery of You that tears me apart
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And if I should get a peaceful sleep
I wanna wake at my Father's feet
All I wanna do is get into You
You got me captured (By Your love)
All I wanna do is stay here with You
You got me raptured (Can't get enough)
Let's go
The sun's on the rise
The sleep's in my eyes
The dew's on the ground
The night is disguised
There's hope in the air
I'm fresh off a prayer
The blue mountain bean is clearin' my stare
I make recompense
It's all makin' sense
Like blood in my veins
You're my sustenance
The moment of trust
The "me" becomes "us"
The "we" become "one"
Your gift is my gust of wind
'Til we meet again
So faith, don't fail me now
If you touch my heart
You can feel it pound
So faith, don't fail me now
So faith, don't fail me now
If you touch my heart
You can feel it poundin'
So faith, don't fail me now
So faith, don't fail me now
When I touch my heart
I can feel it pound
Gotta get myself up off this ground
Faith, don't fail me now
You got me, and You won't let go
