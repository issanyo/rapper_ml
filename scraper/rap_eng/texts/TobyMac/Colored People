[Intro: Ayiesha Woods and (John Reuben)]
Aw yeah
All God's children
Ooh ooh
(1... 2... 3... 4... huh)

[Verse 1: Ayiesha Woods & (John Reuben)]
Pardon me, your epidermis is showing, sir
I couldn't help but note your shade of melanin (Shade of melanin)
I tip my hat to the colorful arrangement
'Cause I see the beauty in the tones of our skin

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ayiesha Woods & The Gotee Brothers]
We've gotta come together
And thank the Maker of us all

[Chorus: The Gotee Brothers & (Ayiesha Woods)]
We're colored people, and we live in a tainted place (Colored people)
We're colored people, and they call us the human race (Colored people)
We've got a history so full of mistakes (Colored People)
And we are colored people who depend on a Holy Grace

[Verse 2: Ayiesha Woods]
A piece of canvas is only the beginning for
It takes on character with every loving stroke
This thing of beauty is the passion of an Artist's heart
By God's design, we are a skin kaleidoscope

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ayiesha Woods & The Gotee Brothers]
We've gotta come together
Aren't we all human, after all

[Chorus: The Gotee Brothers & (Ayiesha Woods)]
We're colored people, and we live in a tainted place (Colored People)
We're colored people, and they call us the human race (Colored People)
We've got a history so full of mistakes (Colored People, Colored People)
And we are colored people who depend on a Holy Grace

[Bridge: The Gotee Brothers & (Ayiesha Woods)]
Ignorance has wronged some races (Ignorance has wronged)
And vengeance is the Lord's (Vengeance is the Lord's)
If we aspire to share this space (Oh, If we aspire)
Repentance is, Repentance is the cure, Ooh yeah

[Interlude: John Reuben]
1... 2... 3... 4... uh, huh

[Rap: John Reuben]
Well, just a day in the shoes of a colorblind man
Should make it easy for you to see (you to see)
That these diverse tones do more than cover our bones
As a part of our anatomy (Woo-ah)

[Chorus: The Gotee Brothers & (Ayiesha Woods)]
We're colored people, and we live in a tainted place (Colored People)
We're colored people, and they call us the human race (Colored People)
We've got a history so full of mistakes (Colored People, Colored People)
And we are colored people who depend on a Holy Grace

[Hook: The Gotee Brothers]
We're colored people, and they call us the human race (Repentance is the cure)
We're colored people, and we all gotta share this space (Repentance is the cure)
We're colored people, and we live in a tainted world (Repentance is the cure)
We're colored people, every man, woman, boy, and girl (Repentance is the cure)

[Outro: The Gotee Brothers & (Ayiesha Woods)]
(Oh, we have to come together somehow)
(Colored people, colored people, yeah-ah, yeah)
(Oh, red, yellow, black and white)
(Colored People, colored people)
Repentance is the cure (Ooh yeah)
