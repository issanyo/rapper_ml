Arrows flying, into silence
Broken pieces, lying around where it went down
Waters risin, back to silence
Quietly crying, wondering how
And look at us now

We thought our love would take the world by storm

Are we too far apart?
Two worlds among the stars
You're gonna take a piece of my heart if you leave
So its two separate ways
Or am I too late to say "I wanna fight for what we got
Cause I believe in family"
In family

So are we still trying, or simply surviving
Facing these giants, the bigger they are the harder they fall
But I still believe in the dreams we've been dreamin
The hope that we built on
Its never too far, never too far

If we choose to turn and let these walls fall down

Are we too far apart?
Two worlds among the stars
You're gonna take a piece of my heart if you leave
So its two separate ways
Or am I too late to say "I wanna fight for what we got
Cause I believe in family"
In family, in family

I still believe…
I still believe…

That were not too far apart?
Two worlds among the stars
Don't take a piece of my heart please don't leave
It's not too late to say: "Father show us the way
To fight for what we got
Cause You believe in family, in family"

In family, In family
