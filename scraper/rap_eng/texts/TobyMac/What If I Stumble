[Verse 1:]
Is this one for the people?
Is this one for the Lord?
Or do I simply serenade
For things I must afford?

You can jumble them together
My conflict still remains
Holiness is calling
In the midst of courting fame

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I see the trust in their eyes
Though the sky is falling
They need your love in their lives
Compromise is calling

[Chorus:]
What if I stumble, what if I fall
What if I lose my step and I make fools of us all
Will the love continue when the walk becomes a crawl
What if I stumble, and what if I?

[Verse 2:]
Father please forgive me
For I cannot compose
The fear that lives within me
Or the rate at which it grows

If struggle has a purpose
On the narrow road you've crossed
Or do I dread my trespasses
Will leave a deadly scar

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do they see the fear in my eyes
Are they so revealing?
This time I cannot disguise
All the doubt I'm feeling

[Chorus:]
What if I stumble, what if I fall
What if I lose my step and I make fools of us all
Will the love continue when the walk becomes a crawl
What if I stumble, and what if I fall?
What if I fall, what if I?
What if I fall?

[Bridge:]
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that
You're up against the wall, it's about to fall
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that
You're up against the wall, it's about to fall

Everyone's got to crawl when you know that
You're up against the wall, it's about to fall
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that
You're up against the wall, it's about to fall

Everyone's got to crawl when you know that
You're up against the wall, it's about to fall
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that
You're up against the wall, it's about to fall

Everyone's got to crawl when you know that
You're up against the wall, it's about to fall
