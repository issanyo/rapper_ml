(TruDog)
Yeah! truDeezy
For the two thousand and tweezy
To all you playa haters
Hate the playa, not the game, baby
Uh, we gonna put it on ya
Make it loud n clear
All of my shorties
Whether far or near
Since the last (truDog)
It's been three long years
So we gonna make it loud
We gonna make it loud n clear
I'm gonna make it clearer
Than a Southern California day
And even louder
Cause the song I sing will never fade
You really thought that T-R-U to D-O-G was ending?
Listen, homie, you don't even know me
This is just beginnin'

Ten-year veteran
Servin' up the medicine
I rock a mic
You rock a trike
Oops! Your diaper's wet again
Uh!
"Stop Truey!(what!) I wear Pull-Ups(smirk), and I'm tellin'! Daddy!"
We goin' put it on ya
Make it loud n clear
All of my shorties
Whether far or near
Since the last (truDog)
It's been three long years
So we gonna make it loud
We gonna make it loud n clear
We gonna put it on ya
Make it loud 'n' clear
All of God's soldiers
Whether far or near
Since the last (truDog)
It's been three long years
So we gonna make it loud
We gonna make it loud 'n' clear
Truett!
"Dad, he's the one that wanted to have a freestyle battle."
"Truett, he's three-years-old."
