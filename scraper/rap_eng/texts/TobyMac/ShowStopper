[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is the day we came to get down
We came to play the game in your town
You came to ride the highs of this junk
Baby, we came to guarantee the big crunk
So if you or your people ever wanna doubt
This showstoppin' party rockin'
Tell 'em all about this
Truth from the village of the diverse citizens
One stop one shot
Livin like a kid again

[Pre-Chorus]
So turn off the lights
They've been waitin' all night
For the

[Chorus]
The showstopper
The jaw dropper
The big papa
We gonna get it, get it right
We gonna get it good
The showstopper
The jaw dropper
The big papa
We gonna get it right
We gonna get it good

[Verse 2]
Hope just broke right through the door
So why you gotta ask what I came here for
Man we 'bout to light the night with that flare
Shot from the gun in the hand of the spare
With the kick so hard that you gotta be strong
It's so hot
You can barely hold on
So rock me drop me
But you will never stop me
From takin' this show to a full on monopoly

[Pre-Chorus]
So turn off the lights
Pass me the mic
Bring on the lights
You been waitin all night

[Chorus]
For the
The show stopper
The jaw dropper
The big papa
We gonna get it, get it right
We gonna get it good
The showstopper
The jaw dropper
The big papa
We gonna get it right
We gonna get it we gonna get it good

Don't mind the static (hey)
We all fanatic (hey)
Jesus fanatic
It's automatic
Don't mind the static (hey)
Jesus fanatic (hey)
Jesus fanatic
Don't mind the static

[Chorus]
