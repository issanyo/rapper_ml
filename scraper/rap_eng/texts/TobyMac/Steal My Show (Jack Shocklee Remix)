Another cold night
Another late flight
It’s almost show time and Denver city’s waiting on me
We’ve got a packed house
The crowd is calling out
They want the beat to drop but what we really need is you
If you wanna steal my show
I’ll sit back and watch you go
If you got something to say
Go on and take it away
Need you to steal my show
Can’t wait to watch you go oh oh oh
So take it away ay ay ay ay..
So now the crowd is hyped
That you showed up tonight
Anticipating, craving something more than smoke and lights
So I’ll step out the way
I’ll give you set a stage
Alright, spotlight, give ‘em what they came for
If you wanna steal my show
I’ll sit back and watch you go
If you got something to say
Go on and take it away
Need you to steal my show
Can’t wait to watch you go oh oh oh
So take it away ay ay ay ay..
When you arrive
We come to life
Our hearts collide, they’re beating in the same time
You’re coming through
All eyes on you
Our hearts collide, they’re beating in the same time
Beating in the same time
No matter who we are
No matter what we do
Every day we can choose
To say..
If you wanna steal my show
I’ll sit back and watch you go
If you got something to say
Go on and take it away
Need you to steal my show
Can’t wait to watch you watch you go oh oh oh
So take it away
My life!
My pride!
My heart!
It’s all yours now
Take it away
My fame!
My feet!
My family, my career
Take it away
Take it away
It’s all yours now
So take it away
Take it away
It’s you I wanna live for
