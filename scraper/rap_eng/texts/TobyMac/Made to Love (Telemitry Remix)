[Verse 1]
The dream is fading, now I'm staring at the door
I know its over cause my feet have hit the cold floor
Check my reflection, I ain't feelin what I see
It's no mystery
Whatever happened to a passion I could live for
What became of the flame that made me feel more
And when did I forget that

[Hook]
I was made to love you
I was made to find you
I was made just for you
Made to adore you
I was made to love
And be loved by you
Loved by you

[Verse 2]
The dream's alive with my eyes opened wide
Back in the ring you've got me swinging for the grand prize
I feel the haters spittin' vapors on my dreams
But I still believe
I'm reachin' out, reachin' up, reaching over
I feel a breeze cover me called Jehovah
And daddy I'm on my way
'Cause I was made to love

[Hook]
I was made to love you
I was made to find you
I was made just for you
Made to adore you
I was made to love
And be loved by you
You were here before me
You were waiting on me
And you said you'd keep me
Never would you leave me
I was made to love and be loved by you

I was to love you
I was to love you
And be loved by you

[Bridge]
Anything I would give up for you
Everything, I'd give it all away
Anything I would give up for you
Everything, I'd give it all away
Anything I would give up for you
Everything, I'd give it, I'd give it all away
Oh yeah

[Outro]
'Cause I was made to love you
Yeah I was made to love you
'Cause I was made to love you
I was made to love you
