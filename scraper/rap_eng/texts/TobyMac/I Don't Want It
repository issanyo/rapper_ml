[do you copy?]

S-e-x is test when I'm pressed
So back up off with less of that zest
Impress this brother with a life of virtue
The innocence that's spent is gonna hurt you
Safe is the way they say to play
Then again safe ain't safe at all today
So just wait for the mate that's straight from god
Don't have sex 'til you tie the knot

[Hook]
I don't want it, I don't want it, want it
I don't want it, want your sex for now
I don't want it, I don't want it, want it
I don't want it, 'til we take the vows

Girl, it's gonna take a little time
For us to see [the truth]
That love is simply more
Than fulfilling the need [for s-e-x]
Respect is what we need to find the cure
For this disease [of lust]
And trust in god above
To shape our lives in harmony
[do you copy?]
That's why I'm saying

[Hook]

[ah yeah, red leader, I don't think I copy that
Uh, did you say you don't want sex for now?
I'm confused, could you clarify? over.]

Girl, they say that it takes two
To make a thing go right (for love)
But girl, we gotta remember
There's another in our lives (in god we trust)
We must add up the cost
Before indulging in the heat (for now)
And trust that god will give us
Something better if we wait
That's why we got to say...

[Hook]

1-900-love, s-e-x is on the tv
Too much skin is in your vision
You gotta make the right decision
God has set his standard higher
Purity is his desire, I'm gonna choose to wait

I don't want it, I don't want it
I don't want your sex for now

Yo, s-e-x is a test when I'm pressed
So back off with less of that zest
Impress this brother with a life of virtue
The innocence that's spent is gonna hurt you
Safe is the way they say to play
But then again safe ain't safe at all today
So just wait for the mate that's straight from god
Don't give it up 'til you tie the knot

I don't want it, I don't want it, want it
I don't want it, your sex for now
I don't want it, I don't want it, want it
I don't want it, I don't want your sex

I don't want your sex for now
Until we take the vows
Even if they dog me out
I don't want your sex (4x)

[red leader, red leader, I don't think I copy]
[your sex for now!]
