[Verse 1]
Nothin' in this world
Nothin' in this whole wide world could ever take me from your hand
Even if I run away and I don't have the strength to make it back home
I know that you will guide me
Cause you were the one who picked me up
Brushed me off and called me loved
You showed me I'm yours

[Chorus]
And you are mine
Jesus, you are mine
I know that I'm unworthy
Completely undeserving
I'm amazed, I'm amazed that I'm yours
And you are mine
You are mine, mine

[Verse 2]
Even when I can't feel you
Even when my soul is cryin' out and looks like I have nobody
Lord, you'd be the one to pick me up
Brush me off and call me loved
Yes, I know that I am yours

[Chorus]
And you are mine
Jesus, you are mine
I know that I'm unworthy
Completely undeserving
I'm amazed, I'm amazed that I am yours
And you are mine

[Bridge]
I am home, I am home
I am home, here with you
I am home, I am home
I am home, here with you
Oh, Jesus
I am home (you're my friend and my savior)
I am home (You alone are my healer)
I am home, right here with you (you're my everything, my everything)
I'm blessed to call you mine
I'm amazed that you are mine

[Chorus]
I know that I'm unworthy
Completely undeserving
I'm amazed, I'm amazed that I am yours
I'm amazed, I'm amazed that I am yours
And you are mine
You are mine
