[Truett "truDog" McKeehan]
TruDog's back
Player from another layer

[tobyMac]
Alright, I'ma show you how this thing works
I'll be your hype man
We gon' start it out like this

[Hook: tobyMac]

True D-O-G, whatcha got for me
True D-O-G, whatcha got boy
True D-O-G, make it hot for we
True D-O-G, make it hot

[Verse 1: truDog]
True D-O-G, that's who I am
With the sun in my eyes
And a mic in my hand
I'ma rock this party
Like an old school jam
That's what I got, Pops

[Hook]

[Verse 2: truDog] (tobyMac)
I gotta get this off my chest
I like recess
And I like the best when I'm ballin'
Shot callin'
Bouncin' off the walls
(Whatchu know about shot callin' man?)
(Cause everybody gonna move when I rock the mic)
(I...)
Yo! Hold up, Dad!
Don't you have 11 other joints on this record?
What's the name of this track anyway?
Cause everybody gonna move when I rock the mic
I keep it lyrically smooth
Like I'm riding my bike
And every once in a while
Just to see if they feel me
I'm gonna pop a wheelie
Uh
I'm gonna pop a wheelie

[Outro]
(Man, whatchu talkin' 'bout man)
(You can't pop no wheelie)
Yes I can, ask Mom
(Hold up)
(You said something about old school)
(Whatchu know about old school?)
Check this
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shake it, don't break it
It took your momma nine months to make it
(This track's gettin' outta control)
But, Dad
That's not a very good hype man
(Hey, I heard that)
