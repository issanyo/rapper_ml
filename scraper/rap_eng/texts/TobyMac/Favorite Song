[Verse 1: tobyMac]
My whole life I've wondered how
This wanderin' heart could turn around
It's over now, yeah
I'ma leave my selfish melodies
Wanna be in you beautiful symphony
It's over now

[Pre-Hook]
You sing to me and my heart comes to life
Beating for you every time (it's beating, beating)
And now that I hear you, oh
I love the way your chorus gets stuck in my mind

[Hook]
Like a lyric to my favorite song
You stick with me all day long
And when I reach the end
I wanna hear it again
Like a lyric to my favorite song
You stick with me all day long
And when I reach the end, oh, oh
I wanna hear it again

[Verse 2: Jamie Grace]
Well, your remix is so surprisin'
Like raindrops when the sun is shinin'
It's beautiful to me
Lord, you flip my words and change the tempo
And somehow you just make it simple
So beautiful to see

[Pre-Hook]
You sing to me and my heart comes to life
Beating for you every time (it's beating, beating)
And now that I hear you, oh
I love the way your chorus gets stuck in my mind

[Hook]
Like a lyric to my favorite song
You stick with me all day long
And when I reach the end
I wanna hear it again
Like a lyric to my favorite song
You stick with me all day long
And when I reach the end, oh, oh
I wanna hear it again

[Bridge]
I am a man in need, You are my remedy
I love the way that you sing through me, sing through me
Your soothing melodies have got me listening
I can't wait to hear you sing through me, sing through me
I am a man in need, You are my remedy
I love the way that you sing through me, sing through me
Your soothing melodies have got me listening
I can't wait to hear you sing through me, sing

[Hook]
Like a lyric to my favorite song
You stick with me all day long
And when I reach the end
I wanna hear it again
Like a lyric to my favorite song
You stick with me all day long
And when I reach the end, oh, oh
I wanna hear it again

[Outro]
You're my favorite song, all day long
Oh, oh, I wanna hear it again
