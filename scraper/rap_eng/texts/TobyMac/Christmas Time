Wait a second â€¦
Is it Christmas?
It's Christmas!
Wake up everybody, it's Christmas!

I, I love it when it's Christmas time
'Cause everything feels so right
Everybody's here
Spreadin' Christmas cheer
Best time of the year

I, I love to feel Christmas peace
The joy and the love it brings
Good will to men
The J train is coming
Rum pum pum pum
Drum it now

When I close my eyes on the night before Christmas
I dream of the miracle of His birth
It makes me feel so warm inside (inside)
Hey, I'm so excited (excited) to wake up
And say a prayer of thanks to the Savior
'Cause Jesus is the reason that we celebrate this day (this day)

I, I love it when it's Christmas time
'Cause everything feels so right
Everybody's here
Spreadin' Christmas cheer
Best time of the year

I, I love to feel Christmas peace
The joy and the love it brings
Good will to men
The J train is coming
Rum pum pum pum
Drum it now

We got family, friends, and loved ones gathering
Sure to be a great day 'round the Christmas tree
With Mom, Dad, Aunt Betty, and Grandma too
Giving gifts to show our thanks to you
Playing music on the box that makes your heart rejoice
It's time for us to make a joyful noise
Singing Joy To The World
With Jingle Bells
All the kids join in to give thanks as well

I, I love it when it's Christmas time
'Cause everything feels so right
Everybody's here
Spreadin' Christmas cheer
Best time of the year

I, I love to feel Christmas peace
The joy and the love it brings
Good will to men
The J train is coming
Rum pum pum pum
Drum it now

Look in the sky
Can you see that star?
Three wise men
Came from afar
A babe was born
In a manger lain
Shepherds rejoice
And angels sing
Glory to the newborn king!

I love it when it's Christmas time
Happy thoughts rolling all through my mind
It's not about the gifts piled under the tree
But it's about my Savior, how He came to be
I woke up today, I can't deny
The joy that I felt down deep inside
Don't come from the things that are temporary
It comes from the Lord
You know Him, JC

I, I love it when it's Christmas time
'Cause everything feels so right
Everybody's here
Spreadin' Christmas cheer
Best time of the year

I, I love to feel Christmas peace
The joy and the love it brings
Good will to men
The J train is coming
Rum pum pum pum
Drum it now
