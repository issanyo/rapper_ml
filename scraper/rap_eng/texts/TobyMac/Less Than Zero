[Verse 1]
Yo yo
It's a dog eat dog, piranhas eat sharks
Might as well quit before you even start
They say until you know where these dreams are sold
Rubber bank rolls backed by fools gold
Masses heading west to Los Angeles
Told they were the best back in their little nest
Somewhere, nowhere, but not from here
Once they arrive, ambition meets with fear
Insecurities change smiles to more denial
The only constant is "No" struggles and trials
It's a long road to the top of nothing
No morals, no friends, just a love for something
Never to be attained it drains the soul dry
Under a bridge downtown the soul cry
Feeling like the city is all you really have
But when you take a look back, that's really sad

[Chorus]
In L.A. things don't always work out quite like they should
(scratches)
In L.A. things don't always work out quite like they should
(scratches)

[Verse 2: Sareem Poems]
Young, dumb and sprung on fantasy
Wants nothing more than to escape reality
Needs them badly, glitz, glamour and fame
Eyes set on neon lights illuminating her name
Wearing shame like an overcoat, awkward and obvious
Did porn for cash, so tasteless and heartless
Welcome to darkness, turned out the light
Geeked out, by L.A.'s nightlife
Not one thing's right, everything's gone wrong
Supposed to be an actress, not dancing in a thong
Stomach coke lines long, heroin in her arm
Touching parts of men that she lapdance on
There's no quiet to her storm, forever it roars loud
Every single day, wishing she was a child
Swearing to make the family proud, she starts over new
Pushing 50, she figured she'd have her breakthrough

[Chorus]
In L.A. things don't always work out quite like they should
(scratches)
In L.A. things don't always work out quite like they should
(scratches)

[Verse 3]
It's got to be more than this, big game, big risk
The bold and the beautiful, young and reckless
The Hollywood dream, heroin Santa Fe
The rich and the poor live a few blocks away
And it's all in Los Angeles home of the schemes
Where the rich get richer trying to sell you a dream
Young girls' self-esteem falls prey to the scene
Tall, thin sex symbol is all she seen
And that's all he expects, nothing more, nothing less
New car, clean shoes, gotta stay well dressed
Needs the best of the best to compete with the rest
Passes on 22's Mercedes 500S
They say you've gone Hollywood, the saying stands true
Cause if you live in LA, you might lose a piece of you
Innocence isn't something to have
It can't last in a city that requires a mask

[Chorus]
In L.A. things don't always work out quite like they should
(scratches)
In L.A. things don't always work out quite like they should
(scratches)
