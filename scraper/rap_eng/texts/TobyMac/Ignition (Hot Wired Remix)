Start it up
Turn it on
We can ride this storm
A grip of hope in our hands
For the coming dawn
Up to our necks in complexities
Causing us to pause
As we collect our thoughts
So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'till we see the morning
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition [x3]
Comatose
Half-hearted
Room temperature's fine
Sleep walking, no dream is even filling our minds
Earth shaking
We be quaking like a wake up bomb
This ain't no trouble overseas
No Vietnam
So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'till we see the morning
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits
(Take it up a notch, come on, come on turn it up a notch.)
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition [x3]
Your sleep walking
I'm sleep walking
Your sleep walking
I'm still talking
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
Hold up the flag 'cause it's ride or die
Hold up the flag 'cause it's ride or die
