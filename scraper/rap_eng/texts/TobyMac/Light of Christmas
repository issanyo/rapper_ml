[Verse 1: Owl City]
Build a snowman with the wind at his back
Got the day planned and presents to wrap
Fight the wind chill with all of my friends
Because it's Christmas time again
Going downtown and spreading good cheer
Handing gloves out when we volunteer
For the children, greeting from ear to ear
Singing Christmas time is here

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
And everybody's like ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho
Four wheel driving through the snow
Fighting the cold with some hot coco
Grab your grandma, to the mall we go
And there's a man outside with a bucket and a bell
Wants to go home with a story to tell
And he's reminding us
That his Christmas got nothing to do
And if a boy himself sings like

[Pre-Chorus: tobyMac]
Light of Christmas shining through
Our eyes, our smiles, you know we could
Shine on through
The good that we do for the people that don't have it so good

[Chorus: Owl City]
Light me up and I'll show you the way
Every year can't wait for Christmas day
Light me up, I finally figured out
What Christmas is all about

Oh oh, oh oh oh [x2]

[Verse 3: Owl City]
Here's a gift card for your new winter coat
Because the backyard is covered with snow
And the sleigh rides, they don't cost a cent
Yeah, it's Christmas time again

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Owl City]
Do you hear the sound?
A thousand angels are singing out
To God Almighty we're bowing down
And that's what Christmas is all about
(2x)

[Chorus]

And everybody's like

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro: Owl City & tobyMac]
Light me up, I finally figured out
What Christmas is all about
(For the people that don't have it so good)
I finally figured out
What Christmas is all about
