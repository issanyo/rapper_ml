You turned away when I looked you in the eye
And hesitated when I asked if you were alright
Seems like you're fighting for you life
But why? oh why?
Wide awake in the middle of your nightmare
You saw it comin' but it hit you outta no where
And theres always scars
When you fall back far
We lose our way
We get back up again
It's never too late to get back up again
One day you will shine again
You may be knocked down
But not out forever
Lose our way
We get back up again
So get up, get up
You gonna shine again
Never too late to get back up again
You may be knocked down
But not out forever
[May be knocked down but not out forever]
You're rolled out at the dawning of the day
Heart racin' as you made you little get away
It feels like you've been runnin' all your life
But, why? Oh why?
So you've pulled away from the love that wou'd've been there
You start believin' that your situation's unfair
But there's always scars
When you fall back far
We lose our way
We get back up again
Never too late to get back up again
One day, you gonna shine again
You may be knocked down but not out forever
Lose our way, we get back up again
So get up, get up
You gonna shine again
It's never too late, to get back up again
You may be knocked down, but not out forever
May be knocked down, but not out forever!
This is love callin', love callin', out to the broken
This is love callin'
This is love callin', love callin', out to the broken
This is love callin'
This is love callin', love callin'
I am so broken
This is love callin' love callin
Lose our way, [way way way ay ay ay]
We get back up, [get back up again]
It's never too late [late late late ate ate ate]
You may be knocked down but not out forever!
Lose our way
We get back up again
So get up get up
You gonna shine again
Never too late to get back up again
You may be knocked down
But not out forever
This is love [lose our way] callin' love callin' [get back up again]
To the broken
This is love [never too late] callin'
[may be knocked down but not out forever]
This is love [lose our way] callin' love callin' [we get back up again]
To the broken
This is love [never too late] callin'
[may be knocked down but not out forever]
This is love callin' love callin'
Out to the broken
