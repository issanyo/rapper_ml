Raindrops rollin' off my brim
Streetlights got the pavement glistenin'
Touchdown, I fall into Your arms
Right where I belong
Your everlasting arms

And where would I be
Without You

And where would I be
Without You

I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away

I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without
That's me without You
That's me
That's me without You

Flashback, stepping through the scene
There's You and there's a very different me
Touchdown, You had me at belief
You had me at belief, You did

And where would I be
Without You, without You

I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-uo-ou-ou
Don't know where I'd be without You

(Don't know where I'd be without You)

That's me without
That's me without You
That's me
That's me without You

You rescued me
You are mine and I am Yours
You rescued me
And I am Yours forever
You saved me, remade me

Where would I be?

I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
So true
That's me without You (That's me without You)
That's me without You (That's me without You)
That's me without You (That's me without You)
Don't know where I'd be without You

That's me without You-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou
Don't know where I'd be without You
