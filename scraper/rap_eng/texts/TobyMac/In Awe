[Verse 1]
Can't speak
So close I can feel You breathe
You're so holy and worthy
You know what I've been
Can't move
So close to You I'm see through
No, not innocent like you
Oh God, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I'm livin' in awe
You don't need me at all
But You couldn't love me more
Ohhh
I'm livin' in awe
Every day I fall
But You never let me go
Ohhh
I'm livin' in awe, awe
Livin' in awe
Ohhh

[Verse 2]
Can't speak
So close I can feel You breathe
You're so holy and worthy
You know what I've been
Can't move
So close to You I'm see through
No, not innocent like you
Oh God, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I'm livin' in awe
'Cause You don't need me at all
But You couldn't love me more
Ohhh
I'm livin' in awe
And every day I fall
But You never let me go
Ohhh
I'm livin' in awe, awe
Livin' in awe
Ohhh
I'm livin' in awe of You
Livin' in awe of You

[Bridge]
'Cause Your love is overwhelming
Your love is overwhelming
It's only You and me here
And Your love is overwhelming
Your love is overwhelming
I can barely breathe here

[Outro]
I'm livin' in awe
'Cause You don't need me at all
But You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love me more
