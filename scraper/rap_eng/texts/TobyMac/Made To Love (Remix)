[Verse 1:]
The dream is fading, now I'm staring at the door
I know its over cause my feet have hit the cold floor
Check my reflection, I ain't feelin' what I see
It's no mystery
Whatever happened to a passion I could live for
What became of the flame that made me feel more
And when did I forget that...

[Hook:]
I was made to love You
I was made to find You
I was made just for You
Made to adore You
I was made to love
And be loved by You
You were here before me
You were waiting on me
And You said You'd keep me
Never would You leave me I was made to love
And be loved by You

[Verse 2:]
The dream's alive with my eyes opened wide
Back in the ring you've got me swinging for the grand prize
I feel the haters spittin' vapors on my dreams
But I still believe
I'm reachin' out, reachin' up, reachin' over
I feel a breeze cover me called Jehovah
And Daddy I'm on my way
Cause I was made to love...!

[Hook:]
I was made to love You
I was made to find You
I was made just for You
Made to adore You
I was made to love
And be loved by You
You were here before me
You were waiting on me
And You said You'd keep me
Never would You leave me I was made to love
And be loved by You
(x2)

[Outro:]
Anything I would give up for You
Everything, I'd give it all away
(x3)
