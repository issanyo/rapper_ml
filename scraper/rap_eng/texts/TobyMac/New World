[Verse 1]
No one believed her
No one imagined it was true
No one could see her winter haven coming into view
She says she's seen the land beyond
She said she's walked her Babylon
She felt the cold beneath her feet
And time stood still where the winter won't sleep (where the winter won't sleep)

[Chorus]
I've seen a new world... Like nothing before... Just step through the door right
Into a new world... Into Narnia
I've seen a new world... Like nothing before... Just step through the door right
Into a new world... Into Narnia

[Verse 2]
All hope was fading...(all hope was fading)... A darkness far beyond their might
But love came crusading on the wings of healing sacrifice
He gave them something to believe
Came back in all His majesty
He conquered evil through His love and handed them the land they were dreaming of (love came crusading)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I never dreamed it but it seems that He's alive again
Shaking His mane He's just the same as I remembered Him
The spell is weakening with every breath He's breathing in
And when He roars... She can't ignore that He's our king again

I've seen, I've seen, I've seen a new world...
Into a new world... Into Narnia

[Chorus]

Into a new world... Narnia
