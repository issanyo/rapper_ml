[Verse 1: Jon White]
Said I'd follow you
Said I'd follow you for the rest of my days
But the truth is I don't know
Where I let you go and lost my way

[Pre-Chorus: Cole Walowac & Jon White]
Said it would never happen then walked out the door, yeah, once again
Can't even start to imagine a life with you I can't understand
Can't believe I lost my way, tell me that it's not too late
Gravity come do your thing, cause I can't trust these broken wings, no

[Chorus: Jon White & Cole Walowac]
I'm falling into your arms again, into your arms again
I'm falling to where it all began, where it all began
Call it my only shot, cause you're the only hope I got
No looking down I'm jumping off head first I'm falling
I'm falling into your arms again into your arms again

[Verse 2: Jon White]
Breathing in new air
Nothing can compare to a new sunrise
Back where I belong
In the comfort of your arms the future looks bright

[Pre-Chorus: Cole Walowac & Jon White]
Said it would never happen then walked out the door, yeah, once again
Can't even start to imagine a life with you I can't understand
Can't believe I lost my way, tell me that it's not too late
Gravity come do your thing, cause I can't trust these broken wings no

[Chorus: Jon White & Cole Walowac]
I'm falling into your arms again, into your arms again
I'm falling to where it all began, where it all began
Call it my only shot, cause you're the only hope I got
No looking down I'm jumping off head first I'm falling
I'm falling into your arms again into your arms again

[Bridge: Cole Walowac]
Even when I slip and fall even when I drop the ball
Ya its you you're always there to wrap me in your arms
Even when I slip and fall you're with me through it all
Through it all I know you'll be there

[Chorus: Jon White & Cole Walowac]
I'm falling into your arms again, into your arms again
I'm falling to where it all began, where it all began
Call it my only shot, cause you're the only hope I got
No looking down I'm jumping off head first I'm falling
I'm falling into your arms again into your arms again

[Outro: Jon White]
Oh yeah, I'm falling
Into your arms again
