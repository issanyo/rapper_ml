So many different versions of a word that's been distorted
Twisted into something that it's not
Yeah love's just an expression
No I don't think that we get it
Cause the truth of the meaning's been lost
I won't live my whole life and be desensitized, missing all You have for me

Give me that love, that Jesus love
Give me that Jesus love
Give me that love, that Jesus love
Give me that Jesus love
No greater love, than Jesus love
His love's more than enough
I'm lost without it, now I've found it
All about it, Jesus love

I don't understand it, no my mind can't comprehend it
Something worth more than a billion is free
The sacrifice was given so my sin would be forgiven
Cause I'm loved unconditionally
I won't live my whole life and be desensitized, missing all You have for me

This love is greater, this love is stronger
This love is deeper than any other

Love came callin, came knockin
A young punk in these dunks, I'm rockin'
Just 13 with that young boy, lean
No gotee, the face was clean
Dozens of friends, but then I ran with the cousins
Head to the sky, you could never tell me nothin'
But You called, I heard and just soon enough
I got trucked by that Jesus Love
