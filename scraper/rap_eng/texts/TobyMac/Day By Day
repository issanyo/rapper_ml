[Intro]
Ohh oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1:]
I live a simple life, I take a day at a time
I spend my mornings with God before I hit the grind
The subtleties of darkness never cease to amaze
As a physical world creates a spiritual haze

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
Blinded by distractions
Lost in matterless affairs
Reaching through the darkness
Trusting You will meet me there

[Chorus:]
Day by day, day by day
Day by day, day by day
Oh dear Lord, three things I pray
To see Thee more clearly [day by day]
To love You more dearly [day by day]
To follow You more nearly
Day by day

[Intro]
Ohh oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2:]
You sweep your feet down alley streets
Sometimes you creep, I never see you coming
Monday, man you're on my back
Like a knapsack strapped with my heavy burden

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
No, You cannot condemn me
I won't buy your bag of goods
You've got nothing for me anyway
That's why I pray

[Chorus:]
Day by day, day by day
Day by day, day by day
Oh dear Lord, three things I pray
To see Thee more clearly [day by day]
To love You more dearly [day by day]
To follow You more nearly
Day by day

[Bridge:]
These three things, I do pray
Day by day

Day by day, by day, by day
[Day by day]
Day by day, by day, by day
[Day by day]
Day by day, by day, by day, by day [Day by day, Day by day, Day by day] (2x)

[Chorus:]
Day by day, day by day
Day by day, day by day
Oh dear Lord, three things I pray [one, two, three]
To see Thee more clearly [day by day]
To love You more dearly [day by day]
To follow You more nearly
Day by day

As you walk (Day by Day)
Oh, Day by day (Day by day)
Oh you gotta pray (Oh dear Lord)
"I'm gonna go Your way" (Three things I pray)

[Outro:]
[?]
See Thee more clearly [oooh, every day]
Love Thee more dearly [oooh, oh yeah]
Follow Thee more nearly [I'm gonna go your way]
Can anybody hear me?

Day by day, by day, by day
Day by day, by day, by day
Day by day, by day, by day, by day
