[Verse 1: Michael Tait]
I am tired, I am drained
But the fight in me remains
I am weary, I am worn
Like I've never been before

[Pre-Chorus: tobyMac]
This is harder than I thought
Harder than I thought it'd be
Harder than I thought
Takin' every part of me
Harder than I thought
So much harder than I thought it'd be
But empty's never felt so full

[Chorus]
This is what love (this is what love)
This is what love feels like
This is what love (this is what love)
This is what love feels like
Poured out, used up, still givin'
Stretching me out to the end of my limits
This is what love (this is what love)
This is what real love feels like
This is what love feels like
Poured out, used up, still willin' to fight for it
This is what love feels like
Yea this is what it feels like

[Verse 2: Kevin Max]
Like floating confetti
The beautiful gets messy
When the fall out finds the floor
But in the depths of the trenches
Is the richest of riches
Love is calling us to more

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Spoken: Michael Tait]
And now these three remain: faith, hope, & love. But the greatest of these, is love

[Bridge: tobyMac]
It's worth everything you put in
Everything you put in
(2x)
It's worth everything you put in
Love
This is what it feels like

[Outro]
Poured out, used up, still givin'
Stretching me out to the end of my limits
This is what love feels like
This is what love feels like
This is what love feels like
This is what love
Yea this is what it feels like
This is what love feels like
This is what love feels like
This is what love feels like
This is what love
This is what love
Yea this is what it feels like
Poured out, used up, still givin'
Poured out, used up, still givin'
Poured out, used up, still givin'
Stretching me out to the end of my limits
