[Intro]
Select a song
1, 2, 3, 4
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I keep hearing people say
I need to get away
We got that getaway
That takes 'em to a whole new place
Won't leave us empty
Won't leave us craving more
We've found that fulfillin' fire
That they've been looking for

[Refrain]
If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

[Chorus]
You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world, we're burning for the world
Burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match

[Verse 2]
Ever tasted something sweet
Knock you off your feet
Or bumped a song all night long, kept it on repeat
I call up all my friends
I've gotta let 'em in
I tell them take a drink of this and never thirst again

[Refrain]
If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

[Chorus: tobyMac]
You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world, we're burning for the world
Burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match

[Bridge]
That's who we are, who we are
That's who we are, oh oh oh oh
That's who we are, who we are
That's who we are, oh oh oh oh

[Refrain]
If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it
If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

[Chorus]
You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world, we're burning for the world
Burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
