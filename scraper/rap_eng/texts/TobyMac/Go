[Verse 1: Hollyn]
Lost in the color of your eyes again
Everybody telling me “Look out for him”
I’m throwin’ up my hands, I can’t stop
Gettin’ close to the flame, it’s too hot

[Verse 2: Hollyn]
Been here, and I don’t wanna stay
Prayin’ for my out, gotta get away
Everything I wanna do, I don’t do
Can’t see beyond the past or what’s true

[Pre-Chorus: Hollyn]
You must have some magnet in your soul
Pullin’ me away from what I know

[Chorus: Hollyn & tobyMac & DiverseCity & (Both)]
I betta go, yeah (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go-o-o , huh
I betta go
(Where there’s fire, there’s smoke, and I’m 'bout to choke)

I betta go (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go, o-o-oo
I betta go (go-o-o-o-o)
('Cause where there’s fire, there’s smoke, fire, there’s smoke)

[Verse 3: Hollyn]
All I gotta do, is just turn around
Keep on walkin’, don’t slow it down
No matter what I do I can’t move
You keep winnin’, every time and I lose

[Pre-Chorus: Hollyn]
You must have some magnet in your soul
Pullin’ me away from what I know

[Chorus: Hollyn & tobyMac & DiverseCity & (Both)]
I betta go, yeah (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go-o-o (o-o)
I betta go huh
I betta go-o
(Where there’s fire, there’s smoke, and I’m 'bout to choke)

I betta go (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go, o-o-oo
I betta go huh (go-o-o-o-o)
I betta go-o
('Cause where there’s fire, there’s smoke, and I’m 'bout to choke)

[Bridge 1: Hollyn]
I keep on foolin', myself every time
Runnin’ back to you, to you-ou-o
This love is toxic, it’s pullin’ me further from the truth
But you, you-ou-ou

[Bridge 2: Hollyn & tobyMac & Diverse city]
She don’t wanna talk to you
There’s nothing you can say
She gone wait, for something true
There’s nothing you can say

She don’t, wanna talk to you
She gon’ wait, for something true
Mess with her, you face this crew (Diverse City!)
Nah, she ain’t staying with you

[Chorus: Hollyn & tobyMac & DiverseCity & (Both)]
I betta go, yeah (go-o-o-o-o)
Betta go-o-o (o-o)
I betta go, huh
(Where there’s fire, there’s smoke, and I’m 'bout to choke)

[Outro: Hollyn & tobyMac & DiverseCity & (Both)]
I betta go
There’s nothing you can say (I betta go, o-o-oo)
Nothing you can say, (I betta go) ,huh
('Cause where there's fire, there’s smoke, fire, there’s smoke)

There’s nothing you can say (I betta go)
To make me stay (I betta go, o-o-oo)
There’s nothing you can say-ay... (I betta go)
(Where there’s fire, there’s smoke and I’m 'bout to choke)

There’s nothing you can say (I betta go)
To make me stay (I betta go, o-o-oo)
There’s nothing you can say-ay (I betta go)
('Cause where there’s fire smoke, fire, smoke)
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke ...
