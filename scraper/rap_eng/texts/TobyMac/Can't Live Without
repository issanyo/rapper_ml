[Verse 1]
California drivin’ had to get out
Distance got me wonderin’ where You are right now
One-way conversations got me worn down
Pouring out my heart wish You would speak a sound

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don’t know what I’m after
I don’t know what I’m doin’
I don’t know what I’m after
All I know is I’m lost
I don’t know what I’m after
I don’t know what I’m doin’
I don’t know what I’m after
All I know is I’m lost

[Chorus]
Without Your love
There’s no point in even wakin’ up
No, no, no, no
Without Your love
Nothin’s ever gonna be enough
No, no, no, no, no, no
I can’t get you outta my head
And I don’t wanna ever forget
You give me what the world could never give
I can’t live without Your love

[Verse 2]
Starin’ at the ceiling after midnight
Over-thinkin’ everything in my whole life
All of these regrets are clouding my mind
Lord I need the strength to try it one more time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cuz now I know what I’m after
Now I know what I’m doin’
Now I know what I’m after
Now I know that I’m lost
'Cuz now I know what I’m after
Now I know what I’m doin’
Now I know what I’m after
Now I know that I’m lost

[Chorus]
Without Your love
There’s no point in even wakin’ up
No, no, no, no
Without Your love
Nothin’s ever gonna be enough
No, no, no, no, no, no
I can’t get you outta my head
And I don’t wanna ever forget
You give me what the world could never give
I can’t live without Your love

[Bridge]
Some people gotta lose it all
To find out what they really want
Some people gotta lose it all
To find out what they really want
What I want is You
I can’t live without Your love
