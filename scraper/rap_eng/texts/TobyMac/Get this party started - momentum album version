Everybody everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High shining on me, so …
Let’s get this party started
Everybody everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High smiling on we, so …
Let’s get this party started
Blind-sided by the blitz
Come on baby it’s on
I couldn’t wait to get on this
You ain’t no quiet storm
I’m gonna tell it like it is
There ain’t no stopping us now
Somebody shut me up so I can live out loud

[Chorus]
Them people thought I was gone
It’s been a long time comin’
But straight out the box
We got the dark side runnin’
So Father, Most High won’t You show Yourself
And shine on this record like nobody else
