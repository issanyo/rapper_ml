Slackin' off like a bum, I'm feelin' ho-hum
I'm feelin' lukewarm like the water in my tub
Started out and we was hot, looked up and now we're not
We had that fire like we was boilin' in a pot

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Fire, I'm feelin' for a flicker
Then we'll fan the flame up into something bigger
Started out and we was hot, looked up and now we're not
We gonna catch a fire, catch a fire for God

(Come on)

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that
Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Fire, takin' it from warm to hot
Fire, gonna give it all we got
Fire, whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

MOC, what you got for me?
Yeah, what you got for me?

Spark to a flame, I'm flippin' up my game
I caught the fire and I'll never be the same
So unexplainable, I can't contain it, son
And my retaining it would only be a shame
So let me hear you say

Heat, like the Kingston concrete
There ain't no stoppin' the fire
We're straight breakin' ground
There ain't no cooling this thing down
We burnin' up and keep'n it krunk as we know how
Hear me now people

Whoopsi-daisy
(Whoopsi-daisy)
Whoopsi-daisy
(Whoopsi-daisy)
Whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Whoopsi-daisy
(Whoopsi-daisy)
Call me crazy
(Call me crazy)
Whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Fire, taking it from warm to hot
(Warm to hot)
Fire, gonna give it all we got
(All we got)
Fire, whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that
Fire, fire
Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh
Here come that boy from Tennessee town
Ooh, ah, ooh
Jamaica bound
Here come that boy

[Rap Break]

Catch a fire, let it burn within
Catch a fire, let it burn for him

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy

[Rap Break]

Catch a fire, let it burn within
Catch a fire, let it burn for him

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that
Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that
(Fire)
Come, we gonna catch that
(Fire)
Come, we gonna catch that
(Fire)
Come, we gonna catch that
