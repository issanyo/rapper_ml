Well every time I turn my back, I get the feelin' that
I'm 'bout to take a shot to the skully with a bat
I'm out of control need You to fill my soul up
And could You shed a little light on the skeletons holed up
My past is taking me to task
And I can't guarantee how much longer I'll last
Without You I'm a hopeless wreck
So I cry out Your name as I drop to the deck
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
I'm Yours, take me as I am
I'm Yours, so won't You take this space between us
And fill it up again?
I'm Yours, take me as I am
I'm Yours, so won't You take this space between us
And fill it up?
Simple-minded little punk, thought I was the junk
Nobody ever told me that my doodoo stunk
What was I out of my mind or was I just trippin' on an ego
But You filled up this space and You never let me go
Bullseye to the center of my soul
One shot but it rocked like a fatal blow
This love was Your gun, mercy Your shells
Now I'm a dead man walking down a skinny trail
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
I'm Yours, take me as I am
I'm Yours, so won't You take this space between us
And fill it up again?
I'm Yours, take me as I am
I'm Yours, so won't You take this space between us
And fill it up?
Dead man
Dead man walking
Dead man
Dead man walking down the boulevard
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from rooftops, so You can take Your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from rooftops, so You can take Your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops, so You can take Your best shot
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from rooftops, so You can take Your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops, like it or not
I'm Yours, take me as I am
I'm Yours, so won't You take this space between us
And fill it up again?
I'm Yours, take me as I am
I'm Yours, so won't You take this space between us
And fill it up?
Take this space between us and fill it up again
Take this space between us and fill it up
Take this space between us and fill it up again
Take this space between us and fill it up
Take this space between us and fill it up again
Take this space between us and fill it up
Take this space between us and fill it up again
Take this space between us and fill it up
