[Verse 1]
I just want to talk to ya
But I know you're in a, in a pretty rough place
And I just wanna walk with ya
But I always wanna, wanna give you your space

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know where you're standing
I can't help you, if you don't let your walls fall down
Let your walls fall down (down, down, down, down)

[Chorus]
Isn't it obvious?
Take off your shades, look me in the face
Isn't it obvious?
Don't you know what you're missing?
Isn't it obvious?
Ob-obvious

[Verse 2]
I can feel it, when you talk to me
Behind the walls you built
I feel your pain, this ain't a game
But this ain't the end of the world
I can't help you, if you don't let your walls fall down
Just let those walls fall down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're running around in circles
Yeah, you're running around in circles
I don't think this is working

[Chorus 2]
Isn't it obvious?
Take off your shades, look me in the face, hmm
Isn't it obvious?
Let's make it plain, there ain't no shame here
Isn't it obvious?
Just give me a minute, I wanna listen
Isn't it obvious?
Don't you know what you're missing?
Isn't it obvious?
Ob-obvious
Isn't it obvious?
Ob-obvious

[Bridge]
I know that it's hard
What you're doing to yourself
You're locked in these bars
But these prison walls are falling
I'm standing arms wide open
I'm standing waiting for ya
Come running (running, running)
You can be free, if you want to

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you keep running around in circles
Yeah, you're running around in circles
I don't think this is working

[Chorus]
Isn't it obvious?
Ob-obvious
Isn't it obvious?
Lose the disguise, look me in the eyes
Ob-obvious
Let's make it plain, there ain't no shame
Isn't it obvious?
Just give me a minute, I want to listen
Ob-obvious

[Outro]
Don't you know what you're missing?
Can you see it in the distance?
If you'd turn around, you would see
Don't you know what you're missing?
Can you see it in the distance?
Don't you know what you're missing?
If you'd turn around you would see
Don't you know what you're missing?
Can you see it in the distance?
