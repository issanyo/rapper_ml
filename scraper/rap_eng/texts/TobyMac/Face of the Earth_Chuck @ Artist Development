Its been a long time coming
Since I saw your face
Since we held it down
Since we were in the chase
It was the road less traveled
The path less formed
A skinny trail
It was barely worn

But we kept walkin'
And slippin' and talking'
And runnin' and fallin'
And cryin' and crawlin'

We were in the trenches
On top of the world
Young refugees but we were momma's pearls
Where you been dog?
Where you been?

I thought you fell off the face of the earth
I thought you fell, I thought you fell
I thought you fell off the face of the earth
I thought you fell, I thought you fell

Its been way too long and we've come too far
For you to drop out of my life like a falling star
Right off my radar
Not a sign or a trace
You know I had love for you that's Bigger than mistakes

Now Hope Road is calling
Let's pack you up and move
'Cause real friends are willing to intrude
So I'm gonna push you in because I wanna love you well
Let the ghosts of your past rest

Open up the door
This is the first day of the rest of your life
What are you waiting for?
This is the first day of the rest of your life
Open up the door

To life ...
Behold I stand at the door and knock
If anyone hears my voice and opens the door
I will come in ...
