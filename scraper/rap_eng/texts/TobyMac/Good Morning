[Verse 1: Mandisa]
Wave away my yesterday
Cause I'm leaving it behind me
Hello sunshine, come what may
I feel something new inside me
I hear the birds singing
Now my alarm's ringing
Get up, get up, hey

[Hook: Mandisa]
It's a good morning
Wake up to a brand new day
This morning
I'm stepping, stepping
Stepping on my way
Good morning
You give me strength
You give me just what I need
And I can feel the hope
That's rising in me
It's a good morning

[Verse 2: Mandisa]
Slow down, breathe in
Don't move ahead
I'm just living in this moment
I've got my arms raised, un-phased
Jump out of bed
Gotta get this party going, hmmm
I went to bed dreaming
You woke me up singing
Get up, get up, hey

[Hook: Mandisa]
Cause it's a good morning
Wake up to a brand new day
This morning
I'm stepping, stepping
Stepping on my way
Good morning
You give me strength
You give me just what I need
And I can feel the hope
That's rising in me
It's a good morning

[Verse 3: Mandisa]
Now I'm smiling, and I'm kissing
All my worries goodbye
Got the feeling, if I spread my wings
I might even fly
You are my truth, my way
Give me the strength to say
Get up, get up, get up
Cause it's a good morning, yeahh oh yeah
Mr. Mac to the mic

[Verse 4: tobyMac]
Hey, top of the morning to you, 'Disa
You smoothie, me ice cold pizza
Cafe au lait, latte dah
You do the zumba, but I do not
Give me like half a marathon
I'll give you the gospel of St. John
Hits me like a wake up bomb
Cause we both know that His mercy flows
In the morning

[Hook: Mandisa]
Wake up to a brand new day
This morning
I'm stepping, stepping
Stepping on my way
Good morning
You give me strength
You give me just what I need
And I can feel the hope
That's rising in me
It's a good morning

Wake up to a brand new day
This morning
I'm stepping, stepping
Stepping on my way
Good morning
You give me strength
You give me just what I need
And I can feel the hope
That's rising in me
It's a good morning

[Bridge: tobyMac]
Top of the morning to you, 'Disa
Hey, top of the morning to you, girl
To-to-top of the morning to you, 'Disa
Morning little miss sunshine

[Outro: tobyMac]
Man, you morning people
No, I'm serious
