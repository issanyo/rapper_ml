Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say
Mary’s boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas day

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a King is born today
And man will live forevermore, because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night
They saw a brand new shining star
They heard a choir sing, the music seemed to come from afar

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a King is born today
And man will live forevermore, because of Christmas day

Sing na, na, na… Hallelujah
Na, na, na, na, na, na…
Na, na, na…
Sing Hallelujah
Na, na, na ey…

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, come to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room in sight
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger, cold and dark, Mary’s little boy was born

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a King is born today
And man will live forevermore, because of Christmas day

Sing na, na, na… Hallelujah
Na, na, na, na, na, na…
Na, na, na…
Sing Hallelujah

Sing na, na, na… Hallelujah
Na, na, na, na, na, na…
Na, na, na…
Sing Hallelujah
Because of Christmas day
