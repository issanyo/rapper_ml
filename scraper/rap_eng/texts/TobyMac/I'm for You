Tell me where it's hurting
Are you burning?
Running just to catch your breath
And going nowhere
It's getting old when you feel like you got nothing left
Well it ain't over 'til it's over
I told you since the day we met
So let me be the voice through all the noise
Whatever I gotta be
I'll be for you

Whatever you need from me
To see you through
Everyone of us has stumbled
Everybody's humbled
We hit the ground and our lives crumble

Whatever I gotta be
I'll be for you
I'm for you
If you never knew
If you never knew
I'm for you
You know it's true

I know the feeling
I know it's real when the drama's all in your face
You see a mountain
I hear a promise - it's never more than we can take
Well it ain't over, 'til it's over
We can learn from our mistakes
So let me be the voice through all the noise

Everyone of us will fall
Have our backs against the wall
And everyone shares a need to be loved

You've always been for me
So I will be for you
That's just what it means to love

Whatever I gotta be
I'll be for you
I'm for you
If you never knew
If you never knew
I'm for you
You know it's true

Whatever I gotta be
I'll be for you
I'm for you
If you never knew
If you never knew
I'm for you
You know it's true

Everytime you fall, I'll be for you
If you back's against the wall, I'll be for you
Cause you've always been for me, I'll be for you
I'll be for you, I'm for you
If you never knew
If you never knew
I'm for you

I'm for you, like your for me, like I'm for you
I'm for you, like your for me, like your for me, like I'm for you
I'm for you like your for me, like I'm for you
I'm for you like your for me, like your for me, like I'm for you
I'm for you like your for me, like your for me, like I'm for you
I'm for you
