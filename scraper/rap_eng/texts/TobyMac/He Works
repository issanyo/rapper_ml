Well I'm a Christian, and you know that's true
But sometimes things are lookin' blue
Because, I lose sight, and I fall back
I start chillin' to the wrong kinda rap
Suddenly I look to see where I am
I call upon the lord to give me a hand
My nature is sin, my flesh corrupt, y'all
But, thank god, things are lookin' up, cause
He works

[Chorus]
He's workin' on my walk
And I know he works
He's workin' on my talk
And, my god, he works
He's workin' in my life
And I said, he works
And we will get it right

In school monday mornin' at 8 a.m
First period and I'm stuck with gym
Get dressed in the locker room and head out the door
Not quite feelin' like i've felt before
My boys grab my arm and pull me aside
"yo t," [yo, what?], "it's time to get high"
I thought for a second, didn't utter a word
Looked 'em in the eyes, said haven't ya heard
About a change in my life, now I'm free
Christ took time on a brother like me
I turned, took a step, as I walked away
I just smiled and couldn't help but say
He works

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
God is always workin'
God is always workin'

Now ya know what I'm sayin when I tell it like this
Some brothers might ill, in the form of a dis
But I know one thing that is guaranteed
Through Christ, I can do anything
For him to work in ya life, ya gotta be on track
Commit ya heart, then live like that
I guess it does take two to make a thing go right
But the two that I'm talkin' of is you and Christ
He works

[Chorus] 4X

[Bridge] 2X
