[Verse 1: tobyMac]
I heard Your name but never seen Your face
Been touched before but never Your embrace
Had a soul to lose and the world to gain
But then You whispered my name

And I heard the truth but never from Your lips
Bought the lies of many counterfeits
Dreamed my dreams but they were never in color
And I searched for You in many others
I was down for the count

[Chorus: Nirva Ready]
Then I saw Your face
Just a glimpse of Your face
And my whole world changed

Then I saw Your face
And I was changed forever
Changed forever now

Then I saw Your face
One glimpse of Your face
It's a whole new game

Then I saw Your face
And I was changed forever
Yours forever now

[Verse 2]
If I could reach the stars, I could touch the sky
And if I spread my wings, I could almost fly
I had everything paper could buy
I was lost in my disguise

And if I played my role, they would feel my style
If I bought the night, they would buy my smile
I've been runnin' this game for a million miles
Believin' my own lies
I was down, I was out

[Chorus: Nirva Ready]
Then I saw Your face
Just a glimpse of Your face
And my whole world changed

Then I saw Your face
And I was changed forever
I'm Yours forever now

Then I saw Your face
One glimpse of Your face
It's a whole new game

Then I saw Your face
And I was changed forever
Yours forever now

Then I saw Your face

[Bridge]
I was blinded by my selfish dreams
Everything ain't what it seems
From inside to out, there ain't no doubt
I been changed

Nothing short of satisfaction
Your love caused a change reaction
I can tell You this much, I felt Your touch
And I'm changed

When I was down for the count
Your love surrounded me
Blink of an eye
I saw my destiny

Change rearranged cause I couldn't maintain
The heart it took to even stay in the game
One look in Your eyes, even I realized
A fellow like me had been put down to size

To be built up in a better way, Your way
Your way ain't about to fade
Bombastic, ain't no way to mask it
I saw Your face and my old ways blasted

[Chorus: Nirva Ready]
Then I saw Your face
Just a glimpse of Your face
And my whole world changed

Then I saw Your face
And I was changed forever
I'm Yours forever now

Then I saw Your face
One glimpse of Your face
It's a whole new game

Then I saw Your face
And I was changed forever
I'm Yours forever now

Then I saw Your face
Just a glimpse of Your face
And my whole world changed

Then I saw Your face
One glimpse of Your face
It's a whole new game

I'm Yours forever now
Yours forever now
I'm Yours forever now
