[Interlude]

[Bridge]
To the break of dawn, we're gonna sing this song
Celebrate the day that our Saviorâ€™s born
When Love reached down to all of mankind
Born of a virgin on a starry night
So I'll set the clock back, so we can go long
'Cause you and you and you, we all belong
To the one King, the real thing, we sing

[Chorus]
Come let us adore Him, come let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him; let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him, come let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him; let us adore Him!...
Come let us adore Him, come let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him; let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him, come let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him; let us adore Him

[Post-Chorus 2]
Our Savior's born tonight, our Savior's born tonight
Gonna lift His name on high, gonna lift His name
Our Savior's born tonight, our Savior's born tonight
Gonna lift His name on high, gonna lift His name
We adore You, we adore You
Gonna lift Your name on high, gonna lift Your name
We adore You, we adore You
Gonna lift Your name on high, gonna lift Your name

[Outro]
It's a Merry Christmas
A Merry Christmas
Our Savior's born tonight
