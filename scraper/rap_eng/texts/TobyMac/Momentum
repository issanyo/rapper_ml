Somebody said you better let go, cause they said so
But I could never let this thing go
Don't they even know what that means
They call me obscene, say I wear my faith on my sleeve

But I ain't here to seek no glory, end of story
I know the judge and the jury
People always gotta ask who, what, when, and why
But never wanna step to the light

So I hear you say you wanna come and get some
Should I mention I got your attention
Know that I'm a man on a mission
My position is momentum, baby

Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum, baby
Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got, we've got momentum

Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum, baby
Been on a roll, we've got some more
We've got the momentum for sure

Livin' on the edge of obnoxious, they call me raucous
I'm a freak, I can't stop this
Ardently enthused about God
No hand-me-down nod, you're gonna get all I got

High-steppin' from the twenty on in, knees to my chin
I'm rollin' deep in momentum
Burnin' with the hard core flame, no shame in this game
I'm followin' my heart not my brain

So I hear you say you wanna come and get some
Should I mention I got your attention
I know that I'm a man on a mission
My position is momentum, baby

Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum, baby
Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got, we've got momentum

Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum, baby
Been on a roll, we've got some more
We've got the momentum for sure

Well we been on a roll, cause we got souls that won't die
And this party ain't over 'til we take flight
You've been told that we come bold on this side
You ain't never known the dilly 'til we testify

Cause have you ever heard of turnin' water into wine
And have you ever heard of givin' sight back to the blind
It's undeniable we're droppin' the truth on this track
Cause once you start an avalanche there ain't no turnin' back

So I hear you say you wanna come and get some
Should I mention I got your attention
I know that I'm a man on a mission
My position is momentum, baby

So you say you wanna come and get some
Should I mention I got your attention
I know that I'm a man on a mission
My position is momentum

Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum, baby
Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got, we've got momentum

Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum, baby
Been on a roll, we've got some more
We've got the momentum for sure

Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum, baby
Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got, we've got momentum

Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum, baby
Been on a roll, we've got some more
We've got, we've got momentum
