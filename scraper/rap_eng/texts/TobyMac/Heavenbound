[Hook]
Heavenbound
Don't you know I'm heavenbound
Heavenbound
Reachin' for that higher ground
Heavenbound
Don't you know I'm heavenbound
Heavenbound
Reachin' for that higher ground

[Verse 1: TobyMac]
Cold rappin' for the king with a sting in my voice
Not condemnin' men or women, but relayin' a choice
Higher groud is the sound that I'm talkin of
Opportunity knocks through a different love
Not love like we know it, like ya love your girl
It's a love from above not of this world
It's kinda profound, a trump will sound
And all god's children are heavenbound

[Hook]

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
Jump on the job and live for him
Do you lie satisfied in a state of sin
Listen while I Christen a serious sound
Rap cold revin' cause I'm heavenbound
Serious lyrics don't disregard
No treason, gotta reason that I rap so hard
Don't look down or stand around
But keep on reachin' for higher ground

[Hook]

[Verse 3: tobyMac]
Call us the heavenbound crew and you can be too
If you only knew what he did for you
Christ died, don't ya see to set us free
Look in the word unblurred, you can find the key
Gotta choice to be voiced, receive him or not
Like right or left, cold on the spot
It seems kinda easy when ya break it down
As for me and my boys, we're heavenbound

[Bridge]
If you want eternal life
Choose my friend, he's Jesus Christ
Only he can set you free
From your sin and misery
God has promised us a home in glory
Trust in him
The trump will sound
And all god's children are heavenbound

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don't look down, stand around
Keep on reachin' for higher ground
Kinda profound, a trump will sound
And all god's children are heavenbound
