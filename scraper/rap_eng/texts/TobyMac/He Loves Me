[Intro]
Jesus loves me this I know
For the Bible tells me so
All of us to Him belong
We are so weak, but our God, He is strong

[Verse 1]
As I sit and ponder I begin to wonder why
God would send His only Son upon this Earth to die
The conviction of my heart brings a tear to my eye
And keep reality far from me, I just want to hide
Christ endured such cruelty for a sinner like me
He paid the price when He died for me on calvary's tree
I once was blind, but now my eyes clearly see
The sacrifice Christ became for you and me
Because Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Word of God tells me so
All of us to Him belong, it's true
That we are weak, yet He is strong

[Chorus]
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so

[Verse 2]
He will stand by like no other man
Two sets of footprints within the sand
But at times looking back one is all I see
These are the days that He carried me
He has proven His love time and again
Pulled me from the fire, a result of my sin
Compare where I am now to where I might have been
Get on my knees just to praise Him again and again
Thank you for loving me, it's undeserved
It doesn't make sense, I mean the picture is blurred
I'm the one that owes the debt, but you paid my price
Now Jesus Christ, I owe you my life

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now that I can see it, will the life I lead change
It's kinda strange we make decisions
When they're out of our range
But in day to day living, we tend to give up
On commitments that were made before life got tough
With compromise in our eyes and pressure from peers
We renig on a decision that we once held so dear
But let's try keep sight of this vision foreseen
Hold tight day and night beyond the point of a dream
Because Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Word of God it tells me so
Everyone of us to Him belong, it's true
We are so weak, yet He is so strong

[Chorus]
