[Intro]
No, no
Yeah I'm
Just beepin' right now
I gotta go
Hey

[Verse 1]
Had you on my mind
I had a little time
I know we kinda overdue (Overdue, overdue)
Turnin' back the pages
To our younger days, yeah
I can still imagine you (Imagine you, imagine you)

[Verse 2]
Boomin' like the thunder
Chasin' life with wonder
With fire that could light a room
Bottom kinda fell out
Waited for the rebound
But you never made a move

[Pre-Chorus]
When life cuts so deep
Try and remember

[Chorus]
You, you're not alone
We've all been there (Been there, been there)
Scars come with livin'
You, you're not alone
We've all been there (Been there, been there, oh), oh
So lift your head, lift your head
Lift your head to where your help comes from
Yeah, you, you're not alone
We've all been there
Scars come with livin' (With livin', with livin')

[Verse 3]
Life ain't got no sequel
We all broken people
The only road to found is lost (Found is lost, found is lost)
Oversimplifyin' (oversimplifyin')
Ain't no shame in tryin' (Ain't no shame in trying)
Passion never counts the cost (Counts the cost)

[Verse 4]
Now you won't take my phone calls
You won't text me back at all
I just want to see you
I can't stand to see you gone
Yesterday I missed you
Yesterday I played your song
I'm oversimplifyin', I'm oversimplifyin'
(I'm oversimplifying, I'm oversimplifying, I'm oversimplifying)

[Pre-Chorus]
But try and remember

[Chorus]
You, you're not alone
We've all been there (Been there, been there)
Scars come with livin'
You, you're not alone
We've all been there (Been there, been there, oh), oh
So lift your head, lift your head
Lift your head to where your help comes from
Yeah, you, you're not alone
We've all been there
Scars come with livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Scars come, scars come, oh, scars come
Oh, scars come with livin'
Scars come, scars come, oh, scars come
Oh, scars come with livin'

[Bridge]
It doesn't matter who you are (Who you are)
This world gon' leave some battle scars (Battle scars)
It doesn't matter who you are (Who you are)
This world gon' leave some battle scars (Battle scars)
It doesn't matter who you are (Who you are)
This world gon' leave some battle scars (Battle scars)
It doesn't matter who you are (Who you are)
This world gon' leave some battle scars (Ooh)

[Chorus]
You, you're not alone
We've all been there
Scars come with livin'
You, you're not alone, you're not alone
So lift your head up (Scars come, scars come) (Head up)
To where your help comes from
Lift your head up (Scars come, scars come) (Head up, head up)
Oh, scars come with livin'
Lift your head up (Scars come, scars come), (Lift your head, lift your head, lift your hea-hea-head)
To where your help comes from
Lift your head up (Scars come, scars come), (Lift your head, lift your head, lift your head)
Oh, scars come with livin'
Lift your head up (Scars come, scars come) (Head up, head up)

[Outro]
It doesn't matter who you are (Who you are)
This world gon' leave some battle scars (Battle scars)
Lift your head up (Scars come, scars come), (Lift your head, lift your head, lift your head)
It doesn't matter who you are (Who you are)
This world gon' leave some battle scars (Battle scars)
It doesn't matter who you are (Who you are)
This world gon' leave some battle scars
