She dialed him about 6:00 PM
She checked her hair in the mirror
And she stepped through the door like this
Three flights down
And she's out on the streets
Walking brick sidewalks lined in grey concrete

He saw her coming from a few blocks away
Red scarf in the wind as it started to rain a bit
Shuffled down the boulevard
Cut me like a deck of cards
I thought you had me
You thought that you had me

But hey, Devil, go on
Get your junk out of here
I don't need you
I don't need you
Hey, Devil, go on
Get your junk out of here
I don't need you
So move on

I stepped to it like I knew what I was doing
I'm a moth
You're the flame
Never knew you'd be my ruin
In the blink of an eye
Element of surprise
Got my feet on the earth
But my face to the sky

Shuffled down the boulevard
Cut me like a deck of cards
I thought you had me
You thought you had me
Now the plot is thickening
Pushing deep under my skin
I thought you had me
You that that you had me

But hey, Devil, go on
Get your junk out of here
I don't need you
I don't need you
Hey, Devil, go on
Get your junk out of here
I don't need you
So move on

You're a beauty and A beast
You're the pressure never cease
You're the straight other side

And they say you never sleep
