[Verse 1]
I've seen life through the eyes of a different soul
I left my past so my future would be under control
Now I've got nothin' standin' in my way
I gave it all away
I gave it all away

Whoa
I gave it all
You've got me livin' how I've wanted
All along
Now all my tears are dried away
You've got me livin' how I've wanted
All along

[Chorus]
I feel so alive, alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived

[Verse 2]
How was I supposed to survive in this vast sea
I was so scared my own heart would try to abandon me
Now I've got nothin' standin' in my way
I gave it all away
I gave it all away

You've got me livin' how I've wanted
All along
Now all my fears have run away
You've got me livin' how I've wanted
All along

[Chorus]
(x2)

[Bridge]
I feel a fire inside
It's like a whole new ride
I feel a sweet increase
Consuming all of me
[3x]

I feel a fire inside
It's like a whole new ride
It's like a whole new ride
It's like a whole new ride

[Chorus]
(x2)

I feel so alive
(Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh [4x])
I feel so alive
