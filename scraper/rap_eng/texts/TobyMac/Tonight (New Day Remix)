Every time I try to go it alone
I get shut down
Locked up and held captive
In the clutches of my town

We go back, we go forth, we go back
I'm sick with vertigo
Weary of my ways, my days
My lips are frozen

I wanna feel a new day
(There's gotta be more than this)
I wanna live a new way
(There's gotta be more)

I wanna feel a new day
(There's gotta be more than this)
I wanna live a new way
(There's just gotta be more)

Right here, right now
Under the stars
I promise you my heart
('Cause it starts tonight)

We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight)

We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
('Cause it starts tonight)

We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight)

We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
('Cause it starts tonight)

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight

Can't feel like any night before
Under the sky full of stars
With hearts that want more
(Tonight)

Like the rhythm no dam can hold
Bein' driven by a source
Overflowin' our souls
(Tonight)

Won't be like any night we have seen
It changes everything
(Everything)

Right here, right now
Under the stars
I promise you my heart

('Cause it starts tonight)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight)

We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
('Cause it starts tonight)

We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight)

We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
('Cause it starts tonight)

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight

So let us seize this night
Let us make our play
It's on like the break of dawn
Come on, lady

So let us seize this night
Let us make our play
It's on like the break of dawn

Tonight, tonight

('Cause it starts tonight)
('Cause it starts tonight)
I wanna feel a new day
I wanna live a new way
(It starts tonight)

I wanna feel a new day
I wanna live a new way
(We don't wanna fall tonight)

We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(We wanna shine tonight)

We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(We don't wanna fall tonight)

We wanna rise
(We wanna touch the other side)
We wanna shine tonight

We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more

(We don't wanna fall tonight)
Tonight, tonight, tonight
(We wanna shine tonight)
Tonight, tonight, tonight

('Cause it starts tonight)
