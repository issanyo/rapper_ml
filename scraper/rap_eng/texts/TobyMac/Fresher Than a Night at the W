Hey yo, it's me, Tobymac and I don't mean to trouble you
I'm feelin' fresher than a night at the W
You probably sayin', "yo, we've heard quite enough of you"
With God and your rhymes and that freaky Jesus stuff you do
Like always pushin' for that racial diversity
Leave us alone we're at home in our fantasies
I know a guy who knows a guy who has brown skin
Once in a while if it so happens I'm around him
We'll never be that shinin' city on a hill y'all
Until we show and prove to the people what is real y'all
It's like we're stale dirty water in the tub of life
Give me a fire that inspires all the world tonight
Give me a fire that inspires all the world tonight
