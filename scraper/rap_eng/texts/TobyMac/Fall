[Verse 1]
One thing leads to another
It was a Garden of Eden, it was like no other
Everything I needed, everything I could wanted
And every time I turn around, I'm singing our song

[Verse 2]
So what happened girl? How could I forget?
We always asked something since we was kids
I may dip in it now, but no matter how I stack this
I conclude, you're matchless

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a star dust bound for Earth
All the leaves have just let go
Your gravity takes me like a domino

[Chorus]
I fall for you again
Every time just like the first time
I fade away, you draw me back
Your love will 'main over us
I fall for you again
I can't believe after all this time, you're still mine
I'm still your's, your love will 'main over us
I fall for, I fall for you (your love will 'main over us)
I fall for, I fall for you

[Verse 3]
Some say it's a little romantic
But me? Imma have to chance it
If they can talk about their love is like there ain't no other
Surely I can tell 'em 'bout the real I discovered
I know they gonna call it old fashioned
But they ain't about to rattle my passion
Cuz it's you and me, label me the dreamer
It's a wrap girl, I'm around your finger

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a star dust bound for Earth
All the leaves have just let go
Your gravity takes me like a domino

[Chorus]
I fall for you again
Every time just like the first time
I fade away, you draw me back
Your love will 'main over us
I fall for you again
I can't believe after all this time, you're still mine
I'm still your's, your love will 'main over us
I fall for, I fall for you (your love will 'main over us)
I fall for, I fall for you

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Everyday's a new day to love you
Oh, oh, oh
All my dreams lead back to you
Oh, oh, oh
I can't count the ways, the ways I love you
Oh, oh, oh
You're my God-send, baby it's true

[Chorus]
I fall for you again
Every time just like the first time
I fade away, you draw me back
Your love will 'main over us
I fall for you again
I can't believe after all this time, you're still mine
I'm still your's, your love will 'main over us
I fall for, I fall for you (your love will 'main over us)
I fall for, I fall for you
