[Hook: Aaron Cole]
Don't worry
Just lay it down, it's not your fight
Don't worry
It'll be alright
Don't worry
He will make your heavy light
Don't worry at all, worry at all
His love is always right on time

[Verse 1: Aaron Cole]
I been tryna figure out my own way
Tryna put it all on me
Weighed down by the pressure
Without looking up, I know You see me cause
On and on and on You keep blessing me
But on and on and on I keep worrying
Why I'm always running when You're telling me
You're telling me

[Hook: Aaron Cole]
Don't worry
Just lay it down, it's not your fight
Don't worry
It'll be alright
Don't worry
He will make your heavy light
Don't worry at all, worry at all
His love is always right on time
Right on time

[Verse 2: TobyMac]
Rise up, get clean, threw 'em on like I'ma wear em
Ain't got the shoulders for these burdens I'm bearing
Broke down and pulling over by the wayside
Was never made for this type of weight so I
Throw my hands up and my load gets lighter
I throw my hands up and then burn like fire
Float up to heaven like the smoke in the air
I flip my worries into prayers, leave 'em right there

[Hook: Aaron Cole & TobyMac]
Don't worry
Just lay it down, it's not your fight
Don't worry
It'll be alright (yeah, it'll be alright)
Don't worry
He will make your heavy light
Don't worry at all, worry at all
His love is always right on time (right on time, right on time)
Right on time (right on time, right on time)

[Refrain: TobyMac]
Tell 'em A-Cole

[Bridge: Aaron Cole & TobyMac]
Yeah, I know your problems seem God sized (uh)
If you can see 'em through God eyes (take a looksie)
If you could only see em through God's eyes, yeah (c'mon, c'mon)
I know your problems seem God sized
If you can see 'em through God's eyes (take a looksie)
Yeah, He's right on time, right on time

[Hook: Aaron Cole & TobyMac]
Don't worry
Just lay it down, it's not your fight
Don't worry
It'll be alright (be alright)
Don't worry
He will make your heavy light
Don't worry at all, worry at all
His love is always right
Don't worry at all, worry at all
His love is always right on time (right on time, right on time)

[Outro: Aaron Cole & TobyMac]
Right on time (right on time, right on time)
Right on time (right on time, right on time)
Right on time (right on time, right on time)
Right on time (on and on, you're carrying me)
Right on time (right on time, right on time)
Right on time (can't thank you enough that you're right on time)
Right on time (yeah, yeah)
