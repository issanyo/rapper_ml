[Verse 1]
Rolled in, like a fresh breeze
Pretty sure, you were feeling me
Could you see my heart, skip a beat?
Tell me boy, did you see me stumble when my knees got weak

Took me to a place, I wasn't ready for
Showed me things in me, that I just can't ignore
Everything about us, was a perfect storm
But it's all clear now

[Chorus]
How could I think that you were
How could I think that you were
How could I think that you were ...
All, I've been waiting for?

How could I think that you were
How could I think that you were
How could I think that you were ...
All, I've been waiting for?

[Verse 2]
No, I, don't, need
No more time, no more time to think about it
I, just, want, this
Over and done, I'm done with it
I don't wanna see you ...

No more (no more)
Standing on my door step
Keeping score
Standing on my doorstep
Tryna do us again (no-no-no, no-no)
I can't do us again

[Chorus]
How could I think that you were
How could I think that you were
How could I think that you were ...
All, I've been waiting for?

How could I think that you were
How could I think that you were
How could I think that you were ...
All, I've been waiting for?

[Outro]
Baby I'm alright
It's all in perfect timing
I know I'll be alright
The sun will keep on shining

Baby I'm alright
It's all in perfect timing
I know I'll be alright
The sun will keep on shining
