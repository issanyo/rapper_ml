[Intro: Jon]
Ready for home
Ready for home

[Verse 1: Cole]
I wish that I could find a way
To hit fast forward
Just to get through this maze
And see that day when I'm finally headed home
Forget that feeling
Being lost and on the roam
Yeah, I know that I've been out of whack
But, I know you know how to bring me back
Cause even when I slip and fall
You've always got my back through the thick of it all

[Pre-Chorus: Jon]
Walkin' these circles got me comin' unglued
Gave You my heart and then I stole it from You
My weary head is swimmin' straight for Your shore
I feel a calling from the One I adore

[Chorus]
Ready for home
So won't you take me there
Ready for home
Out of this atmosphere
I'm runnin' into Your arms
I'm steppin' out of the cold
Ready for home
I'm ready for home

[Verse 2: Cole]
I remember that very day
I said I would be different
That I'd always find a way
To let you know that you'd always be the one
I kept my eyes on
But that's not what I've done
Cause you know I try to play my part
And you know I always come up short
I know I should be forever in debt
But that's something that you said you'd always choose to forget

[Pre-Chorus: Jon]
Walkin' these circles got me comin' unglued
Gave You my heart and then I stole it from You
My weary head is swimmin' straight for Your shore
I feel a calling from the One I adore

[Chorus]
Ready for home
So won't you take me there
Ready for home
Out of this atmosphere
I'm runnin' into Your arms
I'm steppin' out of the cold
Ready for home

[Bridge: Cole]
So if you're leavin' with us sing it out loud
Livin' it right there ain't no doubt
If you're with us sing it out loud
We're following the light
(2x)

Ready for home

[Chorus]
Ready for home
So won't you take me there
Ready for home
Out of this atmosphere
I'm runnin' into Your arms
I'm steppin' out of the cold
Ready for home

[Bridge: Cole]
So if you're leavin' with us sing it out loud
Livin' it right there ain't no doubt
If you're with us sing it out loud
We're following the light
(2x)
