Every time I turn my back I get the feeling that
I'm 'bout to take a shot to the skully with a bat
I'm out of control, need you to fill my soul up
And could you shed a little light on the skeletons holed up

My past is taking me to task and I can't guarantee
How much longer I'll last
Without you I'm a hopeless wreck
So I cry out your name as I drop to the deck

Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started

I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours, so won't you take this space
Between us and fill it up again
I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours, so won't you take this space
Between us and fill it up

Simple minded little punk, thought I was the junk
Nobody ever told me that my doo-doo stunk
What was I out of my mind or was I just trippin' on an ego
But you filled up the space and you never let me go

Bullseye to the center of my soul
One shot but it rocked like a fatal blow
This love was your gun, mercy your shells
Now I'm a dead man walkin' down a skinny trail

Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started

I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours, so won't you take this space
Between us and fill it up again
I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours, so won't you take this space
Between us and fill it up

Give me
Give me more
Give me
Give me more

I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops so you can take your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops

I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops so you can take your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops so you can take your best shot

I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops so you can take your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops, give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops like it or not

Shout, shout
Shout, shout
Shout, shout

I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours
I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours

I'm a dead man walkin' down the boulevard
I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours, so won't you take this space
Between us and fill it up

I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours, so won't you take this space
Between us and fill it up again
I'm yours, take me as I am
I'm yours, so won't you take this space
Between us and fill it up

Take this space between us and fill it up again
Take this space between us and fill it up
Take this space between us and fill it up again
Take this space between us and fill it up

Take this space between us and fill it up again
Take this space between us and fill it up
Take this space between us and fill it up again
Take this space between us
