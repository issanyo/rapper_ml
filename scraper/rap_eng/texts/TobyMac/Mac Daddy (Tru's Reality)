[Intro: tobyMac and TRU]
TRU: "Dad, uh when we gonna order this Mac?"
TobyMac: "You got the cash"
TRU: "I'm close"
TobyMac: "That's what I thought"

[Hook]
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (Them apples don't grow on trees)

[Verse 1]
I want a Macintosh laptop, packaging so posh
Fits like a glove in that tiny little white box
Pretty as a picture but it ain't all show
At 8 RAM deep, I'll be running Logic Pro
To make my own beats, dad
Keep me off the streets, dad
And Xbox would even take a back seat
So please give me a job so I can stack that paper
Cause this is major

[Hook]
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (so I can make my own beats)
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (Them apples don't grow on trees)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm saving for a laptop and looking for some work
5 bucks an hour and I'm willing to serve
Ain't no job too U-G-L to the Y
I'll do almost anything to make that MacBook fly
Yo, I'd teach Judah to cross it over
Then play chess all day with Moses
I'll take Leo to the Franklin Fair
Dad, I'd even braid Marlee's hair (Come on man)

[Hook]
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (so I can make my own beats)
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (Them apples don't grow on trees)
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (so I can make my own beats)
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (Serving up them Jesus Freaks)

[Bridge]
Show me how to do it, drop that beat
Show me how to do it, drop that beat

[Hook]
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (so I can make my own beats)
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (Them apples don't grow on trees)
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (so I can make my own beats)
I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy
I need a Mac (Serving up them Jesus Freaks)

[Outro: tobyMac & TRU]
TobyMac: "So you really want to earn a Mac this summer"
TRU: "Yessir"
TobyMac: "Music for the people"
TRU: "Yeah, man we got that soul sauce"
TobyMac: "Soul sauce!?!"
