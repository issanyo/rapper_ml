Art is in motion, look around
At the everyday people in the everyday town
Love is an ocean as deep as the sky
Gotta keep our arms open if we're ever gonna fly

Chorus
It's a tragedy
All the hate I see
Am I left to be
A slave to history
Love's our common ground
Yeah, my skin is brown
Ain't no sweeter sound
Walls are tumblin' down

I can't deny it overwhelms
That changin' your world is changin' yourself
You can't tell me that you've already tried
Cause we're never gonna shine until we swallow our pride

Chorus

Love, ooh love

Chorus

The questions in you are the questions in me
And I'm no closer to answers than you are to me
If we just believe that we all can be free
