[Intro:]
So if you're wondering why I
Continue to try my
Skills in this rap game
Girl, I can't get enough
I been rockin' the black folks
And tellin' those white jokes
And people are people
So just throw your hands up

[Verse 1:]
I've played in L.A. and D.C., Manhattan and Sydney
And Kingston, Jamaica where my Mandy was made
It's 98 degrees in the straight-up shade
I say I'm stickin' with her for the rest of my given days

"Somebody told me that you're takin' a break
A sabbatical from rhymin' on the records that you make
A little birdie said that wasn't the case
They blamed your exodus on "DC" partners Kevin and Tait"

"Hold up, I didn't say all that"

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
I wanna move the people on a hot summer's day
I wanna serve up the Truth like it's pink lemonade

[Chorus:]
So if you're wonderin' why I
Continue to try my
Skills at this rap game
Girl, I can't get enough
I been rockin' the black folks
And tellin' those white jokes
And people are people
So just throw your hands up
If you're wonderin' why I
Continue to try my
Skills at this rap game
Girl, I can't get enough
I been rockin' the church folks
And tellin' those same jokes
So all of God's people
Won't ya throw your hands up

(Where my freaks at? Where my freaks at?)

[Verse 2:]
I've been away for some down time
But thought it was 'bout time
To give my freaky people what they came here for
I guess I needed some head space
And felt that by God's grace
My homosapiens would still be up for some more
I'm talkin' God in my hip-hop
If not, then my show stops
And everyone around me knows I ain't gonna sell -out
To those bad guys, they pushin' them white lies
Tweak the word freak and you'll be airing tonight guys

Well, somebody told me that you're takin' a break
A sabbatical from rhymin' on the records that you make
(Who said it?)
A little birdie said that wasn't the case
They blamed your exodus on "DC" partners Kevin and Tait

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
I wanna move the people on a hot summer's day
I wanna serve up the Truth like it's pink lemonade
I wanna give my people what they can't deny
I wanna light up the skies like the Fourth of July

[Chorus:]
So if you're wonderin' why I
Continue to try my
Skills at this rap game
Girl, I can't get enough
I been rockin' the black folks
And tellin' those white jokes
And people are people
So just throw your hands up
If you're wonderin' why I
Continue to try my
Skills at this rap game
Girl, I can't get enough
I been rockin' the church folks
And tellin' those same jokes
So all of God's people
Won't ya throw your hands up

[Bridge:]
Where my freaks at?
Where my freaks at, baby
Where my freaks?
Where my Jesus Freaks? (2x)

[Chorus]
