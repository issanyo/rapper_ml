[Verse 1]
Well I walk through this world livin' day to day
I see the people, hear what they have to say
Take a look at the ethics, morals, and goals
Makin' Gods outta men that rock 'n roll
Like Sodom and Gomorrah, this world will fall
A total destruction, destiny of all
Who have mocked the name of Jesus, the Savior and Lord
In the battle of Armageddon and a two-edged sword
Satan in a day he will never forget
When the King hurls him into a bottomless pit
So keep your eyes on the Lord, don't follow human ways
Cause it's written in the Word, these are the final days

[Chorus]
Final days
Change your ways
Final days

[Verse 2]
The final days is what my song's about
Words so intense I might have to shout
Some might play hard and say I'm wack
But I'm talkin' about truth not egomaniac
And as long as they listen, they won't be dissin'
Cause rappin' final days is a serious mission
Just so they learn, I will stand stern
I hope my words make ya start to churn
I'm concerned with the life that you're livin' now
Your's ego's so bad that ya can't even bow
To the Master of all, Creator of creation
I'm talkin' bout God no misinterpretation
Rappin' hard for the One who deserves the best
Speakin' rhymes that will try and put your heart to test
Don't stop and stare me down with that b-boy haze
Get busy, cause these are the final days

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The words of my rap are not what you think
But so secure I suggest you take 'em to the bank
Or better yet take these words to heart
Don't wait until tomorrow, now's the time to start
I'm not askin' for your money or rappin' for a fee
Think upon the words is my only plea
Cause this song's about to end, your time is runnin' thin
And now that my time is up, it's time for you to begin
To do this job is my only request
A basic rap exam puts MC's to test
Spread these words like a fire ablaze
Cause I'm tellin' ya we're livin' in the final days

[Chorus]
