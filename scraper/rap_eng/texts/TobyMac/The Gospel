[Verse 1]
A restless generation
We're turning over every stone
Hoping to find salvation
In a world that's left us cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we get back to the altar?
Back to the arms of our first love
There's only one way to the Father
And He's calling out to us

[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way

[Verse 2]
It's the cure for our condition
It's the good news for us all
It's greater than religion
It's the power of the Cross

[Pre-Chorus]
So can we get back to the altar?
Back to the arms of our first love
There's only one way to the Father
And He's calling out to us

[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way!
It's the Gospel that makes a way

[Spoken Word]
The amazing news of the Gospel
Is not that we can receive Jesus into our lives
But that He's already received us
Intoâ€‹ His

[Bridge]
In my own life, it means forgiveness
When I know I deserved the fall
It called me out of my darkness
And carried me to the Cross
In a moment, my eyes were opened
In that moment, my heart was changed
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
Ohh!..

[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way!
It's the Gospel that makes a way

[Outro]
It's the Gospel
The Gospel that makes a way...
