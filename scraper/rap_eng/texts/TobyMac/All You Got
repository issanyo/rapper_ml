I heard you say that no one seems to care 'bout you
It's in your eyes, you think that life's unfair to you
Just give it all you got, my friend
Just give it all you got, it's not the end
Cause you oughta know
There's a reason for these changin' seasons
God only knows how much your heart can bare
So don't you let go
Everybody has their up and down times
Everybody needs to know how much they're loved
My friend
So hold on, it's not the end
As I remember everything you touch
Would turn to gold
You have the secrets
To make your grandest dreams unfold
You are the very best of us all
But the sun that rises still falls
Cause you oughta know
There's a reason for these changin' seasons
God only knows how much your heart can bare
So don't you let go
Everybody has their up and down times
Everybody needs to know how much they're loved
My friend
So hold on, it's not the end
It's just a love song
'Cause everybody needs a friend
I'll be right here for you
It's just a simple prayer
It's from the bottom of my heart
That He'll never let you go
'Cause you oughta know
There's a reason for these changin' seasons
God only knows how much your heart can bear
So don't you let go
Everybody has their up and down times
Everybody needs to know how much they're loved
My friend
So hold on, it's not the end
