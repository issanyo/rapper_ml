Momma never said it would be like this
I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it's just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted
She never told me
But if she tried
I was a little to young it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfilling
It's simply killing and over spilling on me
It goes on and on and on and on and on
Its over spillin' on me 2 Times
It goes on and on, Yo
This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love[2 times]
This ain't no ordinary
Mmmmm mmmmm
Mmmmm mmmmm
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun
I refuse to believe we're a dying breed
Children of peace, hope and harmony
Ordinary folks extraordinary love
Something from above
Something we fall short of
You can't see with an untrained eye
But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic
But once you taste it, you gonna chase it like me
It goes on and on, Yo
It goes on and on
This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love[2 times]
This ain't no ordinary
Mmmmm mmmmm
Mmmmm mmmmm
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun
Iiits the Reeemmix
A-yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow..
.
A-yo here we go, Love's gonna take us higher
A-yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow..
.
A-yo here we go, Love's gonna take us higher
A-yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow
.
A-yo here we go, Love's gonna take us higher
This ain't no ordinary...
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun
This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love[2 times]
This ain't no ordinary
Mmmmm mmmmm
Mmmmm mmmmm
This ain't no ordinary love
It's extraordinary love
This ain't no ordinary love
It's extraordinary love
