[Verse 1]
Hey mama
It's been a while since we've talked
But I all I really need right now is a voice to pull me out of the dark
Hey mama
I know we are worlds apart
But is there anything you can say to mend this broken heart

[Chorus]
Cause I'm feelin' all alone
My heart is longin' to be home
Hopin' I could catch you on the phone

[Verse 2]
Hey mama
So many questions on my mind
And if I could go back, oh
Yeah, I would hold the hands of time
Hey mama
I never thought I'd lose my way
But all I really want right now is to hear what you would say
You tell me baby hold on
After the dark comes a dawn
And there's a new sun risin', a new sun risin'
No matter when or where God will always hear your prayer
Yeah, He will always be, He will always be right there, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Cause I'm feelin' all alone
My heart is longin' to be home
Hopin' I could catch you on the phone
Oh, no, no, no
No, I'm feelin' down and out
Losin' myself in this big town
And I could use some you right now

[Verse 3]
Hey mama
It's been a while since we've talked
But I all I really need right now is a voice to pull me out of the dark
Hey mama
I know we are worlds apart
But you've always given me a place to open up my heart
Open up my heart, to open up my heart
