[Verse 1: tobyMac]
There are moments that I doubt You
Blind to the beauty that surrounds me
I try to push away the need that I'm needin' proof
And this struggle that I have, it ain't nothing new
But the evidence is piling up, yup
You change my heart isn't that enough
You give me life that I can't take credit for
Call me to walk through an open door

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Undeniable, You are, You are, You are
Unmistakable, You are, You are
You're the bright and morning star
But still You speak to my heart
Undeniable, You are, You are

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
Your work doesn't stop with me
Your signature's on everything we see
From the hills of Negril, Jamaica
To the kid that the doctor said would never make it
Which is harder to believe that You don't exist
Or that You orchestrated all of this
Living in the world that is so confusing
You're the argument I'm never losing
'Cause I believe

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Undeniable, You are, You are, You are
Unmistakable, You are, You are
You're the bright and morning star
But still You speak to my heart
Undeniable, You are, You are

{Bridge: tobyMac]
From the hymns that my Daddy sang
I know I was made to glorify Your name
And from the prayers that my Momma prayed
I know I was made to glorify Your name

From the hymns that my Daddy sang
I know I was made to glorify Your name
And from the prayers that my Momma prayed
I know I was made to glorify Your name

From the hymns that my Daddy sang
I know I was made to glorify Your name
And from the prayers that my Momma prayed
I know I was made to glorify Your name

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Undeniable, You are, You are, You are
Unmistakable, You are, You are
You're the bright and morning star
But still You speak to my heart
Undeniable, You are, You are

[Verse 3: tobyMac]
Which is harder to believe: That You don't exist?
Or that you orchestrated all of this?
Living in the world that is so confusing
You're the passion that I'm never losing
