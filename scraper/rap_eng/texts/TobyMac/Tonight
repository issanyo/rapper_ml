[Intro: tobyMac]
Hey!

[Verse 1: tobyMac]
Every time I try to go in alone
I get shut down, locked up
And held captive in the clutches of my doubt
We go back, we go forth, we go back
I'm sick with vertigo
Weary of my ways, my days
My ebbs and flows, so...

[Bridge: tobyMac & (John Cooper)]
I wanna feel a new day
(There's gotta be more than this)
I wanna live a new way
(There's gotta be more)
I wanna feel a new day
(There's gotta be more than this)
I wanna live a new way
(There's just gotta be more)

[Pre-Hook: tobyMac]
Right here, right now
Under the stars
I promise you my heart
Cause it starts tonight

[Hook: John Cooper & (tobyMac)]
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight!)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(Cause it starts tonight!)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(Cause it starts tonight)
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
Can't be like any night before
Under a sky full of stars
With hearts that want more
(Tonight)
Like a river no dam can hold
Bein' driven by a source overflowin' our souls
(Tonight)
Won't be like any night we've seen
It changes everything (e-e-e-everything)

[Pre-Hook: tobyMac]
Right here, right now
Under the stars
I promise you my heart
Cause it starts tonight

[Hook: John Cooper & (tobyMac)]
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight!)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(Cause it starts tonight!)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(Cause it starts tonight)
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight

[Bridge: tobyMac]
So let us seize this night
Let us make our play
It's on like the break of dawn
Come what may
So let us seize this night
Let us make our play
It's on like the break of dawn
Tonight, tonight
Cause it starts tonight
Cause it starts tonight

[Outro: tobyMac & (John Cooper)]
I wanna feel a new day
I wanna live a new way
(It starts tonight)
I wanna feel a new day
I wanna live a new way
(We want more tonight)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(We want You tonight)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(We want more tonight)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(We want You tonight)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(We want more tonight)
Tonight tonight tonight
(We want You tonight)
Tonight tonight tonight
Cause it starts tonight
