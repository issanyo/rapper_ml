Well, every time I turn my back I get the feeling that
I'm 'bout to take a shot to the skully with a bat
I'm out of control, need You to fill my soul up
And could You shed a little light on the skeletons holed up
My past is taking me to task
And I can't guarantee how much longer I'll last
Without You I'm a hopeless wreck
So I cry out Your name as I drop to the deck
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So won't take this space between us
And fill it up again
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So won't take this space between us
And fill it up again
Simple minded little punk, thought I was the junk
Nobody ever told me that my doo-doo stunk
What was I out of my mind or was I just trippin' on an ego
But You filled up the space and You never let me go
Bullseye to the center of my soul
One shot but it rocked like a fatal blow
This love was Your gun, mercy Your shells
Now I'm a dead man walkin' down a skinny trail
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So won't take this space between us
And fill it up again
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So won't take this space between us
And fill it up
Dead man, dead man walkin'
Dead man, dead man walkin'
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
So You can take Your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
Dead man walkin'
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
So You can take Your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
So You can take Your best shot
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
So You can take Your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
Like it or not
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
So You can take Your best shot
Shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
Like it or not
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So won't take this space between us
And fill it up
