(Paul Wright)

And I'm a East coast kid
Livin' in Nashville

(Paul)

Yo I'm a West coast kid

(Toby)

And I'm a East coast kid

(Paul and Toby)

Yo I'm a West coast, East coast, West coast, East coast

VERSE 1

(Paul)

Yo I'm a West coast kid
Livin' in Nashville
Moved here in the summer when I got my record deal
Plan to make a mil' but I've only sold a thousand
So I relocated to low-income housing
I'm all about singing the blues
Take a walk in my shoes
You can see my point of view
Country folk on the back porch, pickin' banjos
Grams and Gramps are bustin' a move with the dosey-doe's

CHORUS

Paul (and Toby)

It's all hip-hop to me yeah
(It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me)

It's all hip-hop to me alright
(It's all hip-hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me)

It's all hip-hop to me
(I'm a grab my guitar)
(It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me)

It's all hip-hop to me so tight
(It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me)

VERSE 2

Paul (and Toby)

(And I'm a grab my guitar)
(And play you this song)
(And all the people come on now)
(And sing along)

West coast kid
Living in Nashville
Moved here in the summer when i got my record deal

(Toby)

And I'm a East coast kid
Livin' in Nashville
Moved here in the winter when I got my record deal
Started with some vinyl and a mic in D.C
Suburban little punk with an urban degree
I'm all about makin' some noise
And givin' people a choice
Long as I'm hearin' God's voice
All my folk on the back porch
Tru, me, and Moses
Mandy, Marley, ain't it sweet how it grows
Sweet how it grows
Sweet how it grows us

CHORUS

Paul (and Toby)

It's all hip-hop to me yeah
(It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me)

It's all hip-hop to me alright
(It's all hip-hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me)

It's all hip-hop to me
(I'm a grab my guitar)
(It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me)

It's all hip-hop to me so tight
(It's all hip hop to me. It's all hip-hop to me)

VERSE 3

My mother used to sing me rhymes
(Sing me rhymes)

When she put me to sleep
(C'mon, c'mon)

I wonder if she realized

She was sowing seeds
(Sowing seeds)

And now they're growing growin'

Growing to the sky
(To the sky)

And now I'm flowin' flowing
(Flowin')

Flowing on this mic
(What ya got, c'mon, what ya got, what ya got)

It's all hip-hop to me

BGV CHORUS

(Free your mind and free your soul)
(Listen to the rhyme in stereo)
(Turn the music up so that you can hear a sweet sound coming down)
