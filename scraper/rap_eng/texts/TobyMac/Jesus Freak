[Verse 1:]
Separated, I cut myself clean
From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams
Been apprehended by a spiritual force
And a grace that replaced all the me I've divorced

I saw a man with tat on his big fat belly
Wiggled around like marmalade jelly
Took a little while to read what it said
Trying to match rhythms; belly, head
'Jesus Saves' is what it raved in a typical tattoo green
He stood on a box in the middle of the block
And claimed he had a dream, Come on, come on

[Chorus:]
What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak
What will people do when they find that it's true
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguising the truth

[Verse 2:]
Kamikaze, my death is gain
I've been marked by my Maker
A peculiar display
The high and lofty, they see me as weak
Cause I won't live and die for the power they seek

There was a man from the desert with naps in his head
The sand that he walked was also his bed
The words that he spoke made the people assume
There wasn't too much left in the upper room
With skins on his back and hair on his face
Thought he was strange by the locusts he ate
Man, the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak
'Til the king took the head of this Jesus freak

[Chorus:]
What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak
What will people do when they find that it's true
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguising the truth

(No I ain't into hiding...)
(People say I'm strange...)
(Does it make me a stranger...No...)

[Bridge:]
People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger
That my Best Friend was born in a manger (Born in a manger...)
People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger (My Friend...)
That my Best Friend was born in a manger

[Chorus:]
What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak
What will people do when they find that it's true
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguising the truth (People say I'm strange...)

[Outro:]
What will people think [What will people think]
What will people do [What will people do] (People say I'm strange...)
I don't really care (My Friend...) [What else can I say]
There ain't no disguising the truth [Jesus is the way]
