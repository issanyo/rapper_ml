[Intro: Mandisa]
We all bleed the same
We're more beautiful when we come together
We all bleed the same
So tell me why, tell me why
We're divided

[Verse 1: tobyMac]
Woke up today
Another headline
Another innocent life is taken
In the name of hatred
So hard to take (hey!)
And if we think that it's all good
Then we're mistaken
'Cause my heart is breaking
(Tell em' Dis)

[Pre-Chorus 1: tobyMac & Mandisa]
Are you left?
Are you right?
Pointing fingers, taking sides
When are we gonna realize?

[Chorus 1: Mandisa]
We all bleed the same
We're more beautiful when we come together
We all bleed the same
So tell me why, tell me why
We're divided
If we're gonna fight
Let's fight for each other
If we're gonna shout
Let love be the cry
We all bleed the same
So tell me why, tell me why
We're divided

[Verse 2: Mandisa]
Tell me, who are we
To judge someone
By the kind of clothes they're wearing
Or the color of their skin?

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mandisa & tobyMac]
Are you black? (black)
Are you white? (white)
Aren't we all the same inside? (the same inside)
Father, open our eyes to see!

[Chorus 1: Mandisa & tobyMac]
We all bleed the same (we all bleed the same)
We're more beautiful when we come together
We all bleed the same (we all bleed the same)
So tell me why, tell me why
We're divided
If we're gonna fight
Let's fight for each other (fight for each other!)
If we're gonna shout
Let love be the cry (be the cry!)
We all bleed the same (we all bleed the same)
So tell me why, tell me why
We're divided

[Bridge: tobyMac & Mandisa]
Only love can drive out all the darkness
What are we fighting for?
We were made to carry one another
We were made for more, said...
Only love can drive out all the darkness
What are we fighting for?
We were made to carry one another
We were made for more!

[Chorus 2: Mandisa & tobyMac]
We all bleed the same (we all bleed the same)
We're more beautiful when we come together...
Let's stand united!
We all bleed the same (we all bleed the same)
So tell me why, tell me why
We're divided
If we're gonna fight
Let's fight for each other (fight for each other!)
If we're gonna shout
Let love be the cry (be the cry!)
We all bleed the same (we all bleed the same)
Bleed the same
Let's stand united (let's stand united)
Let's stand united!

[Outro: Kirk Franklin]
So Father God, I pray
That our families will come together right now
And seek your face
You will forgive our sins
And You will heal our incredible land
In the name of the only Savior, Jesus Christ
Amen
