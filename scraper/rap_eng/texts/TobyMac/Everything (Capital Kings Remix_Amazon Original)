[Verse 1]
I'm captivated, I'll say it
I'm on a whole new intrigue
My space invaded, upgraded
I hear You talkin' to me
It's in the boom of the thunder, it's in the cool of the rain
And I'll say (I'll say) I don't ever want to get away

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight is beautiful
It's got my mind on You
And everywhere I turn is a reminder (Reminder)

[Chorus]
I see You in everything, all day
And every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
I see You in every little thing all day
No matter where I go I know Your love is findin' me
I see You in (Everything, everything) everything
You're all up in (Everything, everything) everything (Everything, everything, everything, everything)
Everything (Everything, everything)
You're all up in (Everything, everything) everything (Everything, everything)

[Verse 2]
My soul's awaken
I'm taken by all the beauty You bring
You got it blarin', I'm starin'
Love watchin' You do Your thing
There's no mistakin' Your style
No mistakin' Your touch
I see the grand, I see the subtle of Your love

[Chorus]
Yeah, I see You in everything all day
And every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
I see You in every little thing all day
No matter where I go I know Your love is findin' me
I see You in (Everything, everything) everything
You're all up in (Everything, everything) everything (Everything, everything)
I see You in every little thing all day (Everything, everything)
You're all up in (Everything, everything) everything (Everything, everything)

[Bridge]
Tonight is beautiful
It's got my mind on You
And everywhere I turn is a reminder
From the sparkle in her eyes to the starlit open skies
You bring my heart to life, fill me with wonder (With wonder)

[Chorus]
I see You in everything all day (All day)
And every beat of my heart keeps remindin' me
I see You in every little thing all day (All day)
No matter where I go I know Your love is findin' me
I see You in (Everything, everything) everything
You're all up in (Everything, everything) everything (Everything, everything)
I see You in (Everything, everything) everything
You're all up in (Everything, everything) everything (Everything, everything)
