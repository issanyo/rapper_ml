I'm a brand new man, I'm a conscious man
I'm a man who's burnin' for you
The mistakes I've made have been chased away to the bottom of the ocean blue
I'm a brand new man in a foreign land, I'm a man who's feelin' that fire
And it's all so clear when I'm standing here at the peak of my desire

So won't you move me like you used to
I want the world to know I burn for you

I feel revived again, I am alive again
(Burnin' for you)
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up
I feel revived again, I'm energized again
(Burnin' for you)
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up

(Let the smoke clear)

Woke up in a sweat, there was ghosts in my head
Had a grip, but I slipped on by
It's a whole new day as the darkness fades
And the sun's climbing in the sky
I concede, my love, that I need your love
I'm before you, a broken man
And it's only you, no substitutes, who can renew this soul again

So won't you move me like you used to
I want the world to know I burn for you

I feel revived again, I am alive again
(Burnin' for you)
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up
I feel revived again, I'm energized again
(Burnin' for you)
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up

I feel revived again, I am alive again
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me

You got me higher than Kilimanjaro
Got me believin' I can save the day
I'm up and running like there ain't no tomorrow
I'd rather burn for you than fade away
I'd rather burn for you than go my way

I'm a whole new guy with a whole new vibe
Changed inside, more flame in the fire
Can't stop, won't stop, brand new desire
Like the bunny on the screen, feel so energized
Old shell, gone without a trace, new face
No more shortness of breath, new pace
Live life now without the taste of fear
TobyMac, Double Dutch now, let the smoke clear

(Let the smoke clear)

(I want the world to know I burn for you)
(â€˜Vived again, again)

I feel revived again, I am alive again
(Burnin' for you)
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up
I feel revived again, I'm energized again
(Burnin' for you)
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up

I feel revived again, I am alive again
(Burnin' for you)
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up
I feel revived again, I'm energized again
(Burnin' for you)
You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up

(I am alive again)
(You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up)
(Energized again)
(You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up)
I am alive again
(You got me lifted, lifted, you lift me up)
(You lift me up)
