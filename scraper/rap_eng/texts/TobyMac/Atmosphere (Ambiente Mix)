I'll leave the light on for you
I'll leave the light on for you
I know you keep a journal and every page is rippled
From the tears that you cry, ain't no meanin' to your scribble
'Cause words can't describe what you've been feelin' inside
It's like thousand foot walls and they're still on the rise
But look up to a beautiful sound
And see for yourself, you're not that far down
And know this, I cannot love a little
My promise to you is unconditional
I'll leave the light on for you
(Just keep the course, you can weather the storm)
I'll leave the light on for you
(You've come this far, don't you ever lose heart, now)

I know you're all alone in a crowd full of friends
I can see it in your eyes that your fadin' again
Checking out, moving into your hole
Where the light can't touch any part of your soul
But hold up and let the river rush in
You can turn around and start livin' again
'Cause your life is a beautiful bloom
In the image of the one that created you
I'll leave the light on for you
(Just keep the course, you can weather the storm)
I'll leave the light on for you
(You've come this far, don't you ever lose heart, now)

Don't cry
I will always be here
Moving in your atmosphere

Said I be, said I be, said I be
Said I be always forever
Said I be, said I be, said I be
Said I be always forever
Said I be, said I be, said I be
Said I be always forever
