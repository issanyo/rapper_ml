You're standing right behind me
I feel you breathing down my neck
I try to catch you, but you're gone
You whisper words that draw me
Into your web of influence
Your sweet illusion's like a song
You say my name
Like I'm the only game in this town
But just the same
You know you gotta stop hangin' around

Chorus
I'm carried away
A full-on freak display
I've got so much to say
No you're never gonna get my crown
No you're never gonna shut me down

You're such the fallen angel
You're such the villain in disguise
Tellin' dark and lovely lies
I dove right into your ocean
Tasted the salt of murky seas
I've seen beyond your mysteries
And I'm to blame
Thought I was the only game in this town
But you're so vain
That you're never gonna figure it out

Chorus

Cause I'm carried away
So carried away
I'm carried away, so carried away

Sticks and stones from you lofty throne
My soul's been set free
