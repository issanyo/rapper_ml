[Verse 1]
Been goin' 'round, goin' 'round thinkin' you would
I tell myself, tell myself "Give it time, you'd be good"
I'd read the signs, read the signs if I knew that I should
I tell my friends, tell my friends he's just misunderstood

[Pre-Chorus]
There's so much of you that I ignore
'Cause every time you hold me, I feel warm
The ground beneath our feet is never sure
So you always had one out the door

[Chorus]
You won't give your heart a chance to break
Standing in the shallows safe
Wish I could make you want to
'Cause you're something I can't undo
People say whatever falls just breaks
But we could be the ones who stay
Wish I could make you want to
But I know it's something that you won't do

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of you, sick of you always sayin' you're gonna do
Do you think of me, think of me and the point that you've taken me to?

[Pre-Chorus]
There's so much of you that I ignore
'Cause every time you hold me, I feel warm
The ground beneath our feet is never sure
So you always had one out the door

[Chorus]
You won't give your heart a chance to break
Standing in the shallows safe
Wish I could make you want to
'Cause you're something I can't undo
People say whatever falls just breaks
But we could be the ones who stay
Wish I could make you want to
But I know it's something that you won't do
It's just something that you won'tâ€“

[Bridge]
It's just lyin' when you say you're in love with me
But undecided on just where that's supposed to lead
Whatchu want from me? Whatchu want from me?
It's just lyin' when you say you're in love with me
But undecided on just where that's supposed to lead
Whatchu want from me? Whatchu want from me?
Whatchu want from me? Oh

[Chorus]
You won't give your heart a chance to break (yeah)
Standing in the shallows safe (no, no, oh)
Wish I could make you want to (make you want to)
'Cause you're something I can't undo (you're something I can't undo)
People say whatever falls just breaks
But we could be the ones who stay (stay)
Wish I could make you want to (wish I could make you want to)
But I know it's something that you won't do (it's something that you won't do)

[Outro]
It's something that you won't, you won't
It's something that you won't do, you won't do
You won't, you won't, it's something that you won't
It's something that you won't do
