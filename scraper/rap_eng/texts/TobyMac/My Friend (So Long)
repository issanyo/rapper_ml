[Kevin Max]
I heard your record on the telephone
It was my cousin Joan
She picked it up on the Top 40 rack and then

[Michael Tait]
I read your interview on Rolling Stone
You threw the boys a bone
And so I genuinally felt obliged to call

[tobyMac]
I know you never meant to hurt us, man
We're just a baby band
You found a quicker way to scale the wall of fame

[Hook]
The situation's awfully dim
Should we up and go with him?
No wait.........no wait..........!
1, 2, 3, 4...

[All]
We know exactly where you are when you're gone (My friend)
Don't know exactly where you're coming from
(You've gone away...ooohhhh...[my friend])
We know exactly where you are when you're gone (My friend)
Don't know exactly where you're coming from
(You've gone astray......)

[tobyMac]
I saw your video on VH1
Looks like they spent a ton
How does it feel to be the flavor for a spell?

[Michael Tait]
And I remember when you used to say
"Jesus is the way"
I never thought I'd see your light begin to fade

[Hook]

[All]
We know exactly where you are when you're gone (My friend)
Don't know exactly where you're coming from
(You've gone away so long [my friend])
We know exactly where you are when you're gone (My friend)
Don't know exactly where you're coming from
(Have you gone astray?)

[Bridge]
Don't think we don't miss you (We think about you every day)
We still love you anyway (His love don't go away)
There's still this burning question (I got to know)
WHY?!?!?!?!??!?! (What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus Freak?)

[All]
We know exactly where you are when you're gone (My friend)
Don't know exactly where you're coming from
(You've gone away so long [my friend])
We know exactly where you are when you're gone (My friend)
Don't know exactly where you're coming from
(Have you gone astray? [So long, my friend])
Nananananananana and you're gone (my friend)
Nananananananana so long (You've gone away [my friend])
Nananananananana and you're gone (my friend)
Nananananannanaa so long (We'll see you someday)
Farewell, nanananana my friend!
