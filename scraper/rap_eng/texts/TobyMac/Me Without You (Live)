[Verse 1]
Raindrops rolling off my brim
Street lights got the pavement glistening
Touchdown, I fall into Your arms
Right where I belong, Your everlasting arms

[Hook]
And where would I be without You?
I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be buildin' my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without You (x3)
Don't know where I'd be without you

[Verse 2]
Flashback, stepping through the scene
There's You and there's a very different Me
Touchdown, You had me at believe
You had me at believe, You did

[Hook]
And where would I be without You?
I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be buildin' my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without You (x3)
Don't know where I'd be without you


[Bridge]
I was in deep
So incomplete
Til you rescued me
Yeah, you rescued me
Where would I be?
You rescued me
Now You are mine and I am Yours
You rescued me
And I am Yours forever
You saved me, remade me
Where would I be?

[Extended Hook]
I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be buildin' my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true

I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be buildin' my kingdom just to watch it fade away
So true

[Outro]
That's me without You (That's me without You)
That's me without You (That's me without You)
That's me without You (That's me without You)
Don't know where I'd be without You
That's me without You
Don't know where I'd be without You
