I'm living for a time of change
I'm living for what there is to gain
With nothing standing in my way
I will never go astray
The future is a beautiful sight
When you can turn the darkness into light
There is no more living in black and white
When you see what I see

We belong as one
We belong as one
When all is said and all is done
We belong as one
We belong as one
We belong as one
Following the son
We belong as one
We belong as one
When all is said and all is done
We belong as one
We belong as one
We belong as one
Following the son

Come on let our worlds collide
We'll be gaining ground with every stride
There's no need to run and hide
When you can be set free
We are living for the change we've made
We're living for what we've gained
And nothing's standing in our way
We will never go astray

Leave it all behind
Break through your disguise
Turn darkness into light
Leave it all behind
Break through your disguise
Turn darkness into light
It'll feel so right
Let the flame ignite

Don't call this a comeback
Cap Kings and T-mac
Unifyin', finalizin', synchronizin' we rap
One body
One soul
One king to make us whole
This time I can't be wrong
I'm fellin' strong
