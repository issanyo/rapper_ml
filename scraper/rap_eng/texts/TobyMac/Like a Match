[Intro]
Select a song
1, 2, 3, 4
Woah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I keep hearing people say
I need to get away
We got that getaway
That takes 'em to a whole new place
Won't leave us empty
Won't leave us craving more
We've found that fulfillin' fire
That they've been looking for

[Refrain]
Oh, If it's real, we've gotta show it
Oh, cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

[Chorus]
You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world, we're burning for the world
Burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match

[Verse 2]
Ever tasted something sweet
Knock you off your feet
Or bumped a song all night long, kept it on repeat
I call up all my friends
I've gotta let 'em in
I tell them take a drink of this and never thirst again

[Refrain]
Oh, If it's real, we've gotta show it
Oh, cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

[Chorus]
You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world, we're burning for the world
Burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match

[Bridge]
That's who we are, who we are oh
That's who we are, oh oh oh oh
That's who we are, who we are oh
That's who we are, oh oh oh oh

[Refrain]
If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it, yeah
If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

They're gonna know it

[Chorus]
You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world, we're burning for the world
We'll be burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
We've gotta lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove
Ooh
Strike it up, like a match
We've gotta lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove
Ooh
Strike it up, like a match
