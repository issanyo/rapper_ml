[Chorus]
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
Time for me to hit the road
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
We'll talk later on the phone
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
Behind me close the door
C'est la vie love (c'est la vie love)
La vie la love

[Verse 1]
On the road again as Willie Nelson once sung
With a familiar name hanging from my tongue
Where'd you come from
You got my heartstrings undone
Your sweet honey bun package can't be outdone
You're my numero uno, my [?]
Who am I with in my freetime girl you know
I'm into your eyes, style, smile and figure
You hold a gold medal baby girl you're a winner
Over dinner and a movie we talk about life
Across the sky we write, under the pale moonlight
Talking about what might come [?]
If we love fearless and don't become afraid
We've played hide and seek, now we playing peekaboo
You see me and I see you
We've been through ups and downs
Still we walk side by side
Nothing can keep us apart, not even time

[Chorus]
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
It's time for me to hit the road
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
We'll talk later on the phone
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
Behind me close the door
C'est la vie love (c'est la vie love)
C'est la vie love, la vie la love

[Verse 2]
I know the passenger seat of your car is mad cold
When I'm out on the road, being alone gets mad old
You're sad when I'm gone, I know you're crying a lot
But you know what I'm out here doing trying to blow up the spot
So when we're tying the knot you got a little less stress
Every bill's paid plus a little excess
We've got enough in the bank so you can hop on the bus
And bring your laptop computer while you travel with us
To give you plenty of time to write your cinema scripts
You know this, so why must you continue to trip
At the end of the day honey I still gotta go
No matter what anyone says but I want you to know
That when it's show to show, and it's city to city
And my crew is blowing up, and the ladies a pretty
I keep a picture of you, in the front of my mind
I love you won't forget that I'm yours in your mind

[Chorus]
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
It's time for me to hit the road
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
We'll talk later on the phone (ooh c'est la vie)
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
Behind me close the door
C'est la vie love (c'est la vie love)
C'est la vie love, la vie la love

[Verse 3]
Yo before there was an us there was a dream that belonged to me
And now they're we're together we both share and agree
To support one another through the thick and the thin
Your loss is my loss your win is my win
And when I'm off on the road we keep in touch via phone
Which will never compare to being together at home
And I'm never prepared to leave you sad and alone
But it's nice [?], I know my fondness has grown
In a perfect world we'd have more time of our own
But you've got a good job and I've got show, after show, after show, after show, after show, after show, after show
But hey oh I gotta go
I miss you more than ever, I miss you more every time
But I gotta see the world and let my light shine
Which is what I chose, and you chose me
Write raps, do shows, you and I c'est la vie

[Chorus]
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
It's time for me to hit the road
C'est la vie love
I gotta go now
We'll talk later on the phone (on the phone)
C'est la vie love (yeah)
I gotta go now
Behind me close the door (close the door
C'est la vie love (c'est la vie love)
C'est la vie love, la vie la love

[Outro]
Gotta gotta go (I gotta go now)
Gotta gotta go
Gotta gotta go (I gotta go now)
[?], oh yeah
