[Intro]
Was at the end of my rope, had nowhere to go
Was at the end of my rope, I had nothing to show
Until the day I turned to You, was at the end of my

[What?]
[You talking to me?]
[You talking to me?]
[You call me crazy] - [4X]

You call me crazy, man you make my day
My state of residence was disarray
At every party and as far as anybody knew - everything was cool, but
The truth was bottled up inside of me
I was as lonely as a man could be
And my 200 friends couldn't fill the void in my soul
It was a giant hole

Nothing made any sense
I thought there would never be an end
Then love came knocking at my door

[Chorus]
Since I met You I've been alright
You turn all my darkness into light
Since I met You I've been okay, I've been alright
[Ya know I've been alright]
Since I met You I've been okay
You're rolling my winter into may
And since I met You I've been alright
I've been okay [since I met you]
I've been okay [since I met you]

You got me feeling like a million bucks
Some people write it OFF as Irish luck
But I know better, cause my rabbit's foot never did me a bit of good
The truth hit me like a sock in the eye
A revelation that I can't deny
Your love has overtaken every little part of me
You were what I needed

I'm carried away
Never seen the sunshine like today
You made something of my life

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Was at the end of my rope
I had no where to go, go
Was at the end of my rope
I had nothing to show
Until the day that I turned to you
Was at the end of my rope
I had nowhere to go, go, go
Was at the end of my rope
I had nothing to show
Until the day that I turned to you
Was at the end of my rope

[Yeah, that's right, I'm talkin' to you]
Sick and tired [4X]

Sick and tired of the same ol' fluff
You came along and You shook me up
You got me tripping on a vision of eternity
I can see it clearly

[Chorus]

Was at the end of my rope
[With nowhere to go]
I had nowhere to go, go
[Nowhere to go]
Was at the end of my rope
[With nothing to show]
Had nowhere to go, go, go
[I had nowhere to go]
Was at the end [I had nowhere to go] [come on] of my rope
[I had nowhere to go] [come on]
Was at the end [nowhere to go] [come on] of my rope
[I had nowhere to go] Was at the end, then I met you

[Nowhere to go]
