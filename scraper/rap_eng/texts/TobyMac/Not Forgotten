[Verse 1]
Nobody knows the mountains
We've been climbing
Nobody sees the valleys
We are barely surviving

[Pre-Chorus]
His eyes are on us tonight
We got to believe
His eyes are on us tonight

[Chorus]
We are not forgotten
We are not alone
He is holding us and
He'll never let go
He'll never let go

[Verse 2]
Nobody sees the fires
We are facing (No, no)
Nobody knows the future
We're embracing

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, His eyes are on us tonight
We got to believe that
His eyes are on us tonight

[Chorus]
We are not forgotten
We are not alone
He is holding us and
He'll never let go
He'll never let go

We are not forgotten
We are not alone
He is holding us and
He'll never let go
He'll never let go
He'll never let go
He'll never let go

[Bridge]
We are counting on You
We're counting on You
We're counting on You

[Chorus]
We are not forgotten (We are not forgotten)
We are not alone (We are not alone)
He is holding us and
He'll never let go
He'll never let go

We are not forgotten (We are not forgotten)
We are not alone (We are not alone)
He is holding us and
He'll never let go
He'll never let go

[Outro]
He'll never let go
We're counting on You
