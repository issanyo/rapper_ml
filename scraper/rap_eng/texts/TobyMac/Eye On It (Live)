[Intro: tobyMac]
Eye on it, eye on it
Eye on it, eye on it
Eye on it
Eye on it
Eye on it, eye on it

[Verse 1: tobyMac]
I set my eyes to the west, walkin' away from it all
Reachin' for what lies ahead, I got my eye on it
I see my sweat hit the ground
I put my foot in the block
This is the race of my life
And I can't wait for this shot

[Bridge: tobyMac]
Cause I can feel the wind at my back
Chest is pumpin' like a heart attack
Feet are moving and my mind is locked
Pressin' on with everything I got

[Hook: tobyMac]
I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it
Eye on it
I got my eye on the prize, I got my eye on it
I got my eye on the prize, I got my eye on it
I got my eye on the prize, I got my eye on it
I got my eye on it, and I will not quit

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
I got a new passenger to help me navigate the way
So when my heart hits the floor I can recalibrate
I feel the deeper callin' me, all else is fadin' in the past
So let me run in the race that I know is built to last

[Bridge 2: tobyMac]
Cause I can feel the wind at my back
Chest is pumpin' like a heart attack
Feet are moving and my mind is locked
Pressin' on I gotta take my shot

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Britt Nicole]
Eye on it
Eye on it
Eye on it
Eye on it

[Outro: tobyMac & (Britt Nicole)]
Eye on it
I got my (Eye on it)
I got my (Eye on it)
I got my eye on the prize, I got my (Eye on it)
I got my eye on the prize and I will not quit
And I will not quit
