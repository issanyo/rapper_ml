Hey!
Everytime I try to go in alone I get shut down
Locked up and held captive in the clutches of my down
We go back, we go forth
We go back
I'm sick with vertigo
Weary of my ways, my days
My lips are frozen
I wanna feel a new day
(There's gotta be more than this)
I wanna live a new way
(There's gotta be more)
I wanna feel a new day
(There's gotta be more)
I wanna live a new way
(There's just gotta be more)
Right here, right now
Under the stars, I promise you my heart
Cause it starts tonight!
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight!)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(Cause it starts tonight!)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(Cause it starts tonight)
Tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight
Can't feel like any night before
Under the sky full of stars
With hearts that want more
(Tonight)
Like the rhythm no dam can hold
Bein' drivin by a source overflowin our souls
(Tonight)
Won't be like any night we have seen
It changes everything (e-e-e-e-everything)
Right here right now
Under the stars
I promise you my heart
Cause it starts tonight!
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It start tonight!)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(Cause it starts tonight!)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight!)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(Cause it starts tonight!)
Tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight
So let us seize this night
Let us make off great
It's on like the break of dawn
So let us seize this night
Let us make our flight
It's on like the break of dawn
Tonight
Tonight
Cause it starts tonight!...
Cause it starts tonight!
I wanna feel a new day
I wanna live a new way
(It starts tonight)
I wanna feel a new day
I wanna live a new way
(We don't wanna fall tonight!)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(We wanna shine tonight!)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(We don't wanna fall tonight)
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(We wanna shine tonight!)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(We don't wanna fall tonight)
Tonight tonight
(We wanna shine tonight!)
Tonight tonight
Cause it starts tonight!
