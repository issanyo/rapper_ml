Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be?
Which inspire your heavenly song

Gloria, (Gloria), Gloria
Sing merrily, shout joyfully, sing merrily, shout joyfully
Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess you alone are God, ahhh

See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise

The greatest expression of love ever shown
Happened on this night
When the angel appeared to the shepherds and said
"Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be for all people
For unto you is born this day
In the city of David
A Savior who is Christ the Lord
Glory to God in the highest
Emmanuel
The word made flesh
Lamb of God
Sing praises to His name"

(Gloria)
Come let us adore
For unto us is born
A Savior who is Christ our Lord
Emmanuel, Elshaddia
Singing praises to the Lord most high
Our King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Sing Gloria
Gloriaâ€¦

Shout joyfully to the Lord
My soul does magnify you
Holy is the Lord
The mighty One of Israel
And You alone are God
And You have done great things for us
