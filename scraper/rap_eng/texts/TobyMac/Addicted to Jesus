Yo, what up fellas?
Hey, have you heard A to J?
I'm talking A to J?
As in are you A to J?
Let me take you to school

Gimme a J
J, you got your J
Give me an E
E, you got your E
Gimme an S U S
S U S, you got your S U S
Boys, what does it spell?
Ah, Jesus, ah, Jesus, break it down

People get addicted to new things everyday
Television, video's, yo what can I say?
Shoppin till they droppin', hoppin' at the mall
Yakin', yakin' on the phone, who else should we call?

But I'll stand with the man who made the blind to see
Livin' large, super charged, He did something in me
Check it out, it's about a total change of mind
Don't wait too late, you may run out of time

Stand tall, stand tall, stand strong, stand strong
Say it loud, sat it loud, say it along
Bust the Devil, up in pieces
Get alive with God
Addicted To Jesus

People they go crazy and don't know when to stop
Running, jogging, exercising, I'm gonna pump you up
Smokin' in the boys room, drink up all the booze
Drug and crack and heart attack and what do you lose

In common sight, crime at night, danger 'round the bend
No way out, yo, it's about being born again
He paid your price, sacrifice, the cross of Calvery
It's done, be one and you can be free

Stand tall, stand tall, stand strong, stand strong
Say it loud, sat it loud, say it along
Bust the Devil, up in pieces
Get alive with God
Addicted To Jesus

I'm addicted, I-I'm addicted
A-a-addicted to Jesus
I'm addicted
A-a-addicted, a-a-addicted to Jesus, yeah
It's Toby time

Addiction, you know everbody's got it
From top to the very bottom of the list
So don't gimme the fist on addiction
You don't wanna miss

To Christ who paid the price
Died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sin
So I'll say it again
Me and my boys are addicted to Him

Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
Praise the Lord with your feet

Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
Praise the Lord with your feet

Rewind, rewind, rewind

Stand tall, stand tall, stand strong, stand strong
Say it loud, sat it loud, say it along
Bust the Devil, up in pieces
Get alive with God
Addicted To Jesus

Stand tall, stand tall, stand strong, stand strong
Say it loud, sat it loud, say it along
Bust the Devil, up in pieces
Get alive with God
Addicted To Jesus
