[Joey The Jerk]
Everybody needs somebody to love
Not only a mate but a father or a mother to hug
A little cousin or a brother to slug
A good friend that door is always open and we never feel bugged
If you give than you shall receive
So let your shoulder be the one they cry on and as their tears hit your sleeve
Believe when you're in need your gonna reap from that seed
So you won't be alone in good health or disease
God so loved the world he sent his Son down to bleed
And if I never share this than what is this to me
Empty words and a great tragedy
But its worth so much more to me and my family

[Hook]
What's the point of a song if you sing it all alone
What's the point of life if you only live it on your own
There's a song waiting to be sung
And a life that's here to live
The only way to have them both is for you to forgive

[UNO Mas]
Life is like a door that you open in and out
It's as quiet as a mouse or a loud as a shout
It's the person deep within no matter what type of skin
It's the influence on others like the ones you let in
To share a thought or a gift, death and life is in a voice
The plan for your soul is the next man's choice
Some know the truth but hide it like they're scared to get poor
We're in a world full of hurt we can't afford to ignore
Whether you're good at public speakin' or rappin' over these beats
If you catch more air than Kobe gettin' people out they seats
It's unique, no one else has been given what you got
And a gift is only good when we use it a lot

October 16th, '04 the day I dreaded
The family and I in suit and tie, church headed
To pay my final respects to my father
Heart heavy, eyes bloodshot red and filled with water
As I stand to briefly speak, for a moment I was hushed
To look across the sanctuary at the lives that he touched
400 plus, that day in attendance
Caused me to think about my selfish ways with repentance
As I sit and write this sentence, the things I remember most
The love language of giving that he spoke, and folks
Don't remember his career or the acquiring of wealth
More than the things he did for people that are other than himself

[Hook]
