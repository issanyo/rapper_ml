I got a ticket, I got a ticket
I got a ticket to ride
(Gotta a ticket to ride to the other side)
I got a ticket, I got a ticket
I got a ticket to ride
(Gotta ticket to ride to the other side)

Ride ride wanna ride on the J-Train
On the J-Train wanna ride on the J-Train
Ride ride wanna ride on the J-Train
On the J-Train wanna ride on the J-Train

Sit back, relax put on your travelin' gear
No need to doubt so put aside your fear
Destination: out of this atmosphere
It's the J-Train baby, we depart from right here
No lines to fight no ticket to price
I'm rollin' first class cause I've seen the light
Try as you may but your money can't buy
A ticket on the J-Line to the other side

Now I missed the Train more than once in my life
Til' the good conductor heard my Momma's cry
Hades to Glory in the blink of an eye
Hear me now, hear me now while I testify
Heard the whistle blow I felt a chill to the bone
All aboard is what I heard it I was headed for home
Had a reclinable seat but I just had to stand
Up on the "J" all the way to the promise land

Do you wanna ride say
To the other side say
If you wanna ride say
Get on the Freak-Line
