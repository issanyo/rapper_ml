[Verse 1]
Another heartbreak day
Feels like you're miles away
Don't even need no shade
When your sun don't shine, shine
Too many passin' dreams
Roll by like limousines
It's hard to keep believin'
When they pass you by and by

[Pre-Chorus]
I know your heart been broke again
(Oh)
I know your prayers ain’t been answered yet
(Oh)
I know you're feeling like you got nothing left
Well, lift your head
It ain't over yet, it ain't over yet, so

[Chorus]
(Move)
Keep walkin'
Soldier keep movin' on
(Move)
Keep walkin'
Until the mornin' comes
(Move)
Keep walkin'
Soldier keep movin' on
And lift your head
It ain't over yet, it ain't over yet

[Verse 2]
Echoin' inside your head
Are the words that your sweet mama said
(Hey)
"Shoot for the moon, my dear"
So you took aim out of this atmosphere
(Hey)
Between high stakes and pump fakes
You're feelin' like you can't buy a break
I can hold your hand but I can't turn your eyes to freedom
(Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know your heart been broke again
(Oh)
I know your prayers ain’t been answered yet
(Oh)
I know you're feeling like you got nothing left
Well, lift your head
(Lift your head)
It ain't over yet, it ain't over yet, so

[Chorus]
(Move)
Keep walkin'
Soldier keep movin' on
(Movin' on)
(Move)
Keep walkin'
Until the mornin' comes
(Mornin' comes)
(Move)
Keep walkin'
Soldier keep movin' on
And lift your head
(Lift your head)
It ain't over yet, it ain't over yet

[Bridge]
Hold on, hold on
Lord ain't finished yet
Hold on, hold on
He'll get you through this
Hold on, hold on
These are the promises
I never will forget
I never will forget, so
Hold on, hold on
The Lord ain't finished yet
Hold on, hold on
He'll get you through this
Hold on, hold on
These are the promises
I never will forget
I never will forget

[Pre-Chorus]
I know your heart been broke again
I know your prayers ain't been answered yet
But it ain't over yet
(No)
It ain't over yet
So get up and

[Chorus]
(Move)
Keep walkin'
Soldier keep movin' on
(Move)
Keep walkin'
Until the mornin' comes
(You've got to move, move, move, move, move)
Keep walkin'
Soldier keep movin' on
And lift your head
(Lift your head)
It ain't over yet, it ain't over yet
(Lift up your head now)
Keep walkin'
(Yeah)
Soldier keep movin' on
(Lift up your head now)
Keep walkin'
(Oh)
Until the mornin' comes
(Keep believin')
Keep walkin'
Soldier keep movin' on
And lift your head
(Lift your head)
It ain't over yet, it ain't over yet

[Outro]
Keep walkin'
(Keep walkin')
Soldier keep movin' on
Keep walkin'
(Keep walkin')
Soldier keep movin' on
Keep walkin'
Soldier keep movin' on
