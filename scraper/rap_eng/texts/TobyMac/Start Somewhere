Last night, everything was movin' so fast
I could barely keep track
Oh, of my offenses or your defenses
In hindsight, I woulda, coulda, shoulda not gone there
But left without a word to spare
Was it your offenses or my defensiveness?

That's got me thinkin' that we're never gonna get it right
I wanna straighten this before the sun goes down tonight
If I could only fight the bitterness I feel inside
This thing is eatin' me alive

[Chorus]
Well I'm right here
And you're right there
And God knows we've got to start somewhere
'Cause I'm messed up
And you're broken
And those shots we fired are still smokin'

[Chorus]
Well I'm right here
And you're right there
And God knows we've got to start somewhere
'Cause I'm messed up
And you're broken
And those shots we fired are still smokin'

I'm tossin' and turnin' on the things I'd undo
As I wrestle with the painful truth
Oh, my sleep escapes me as guilt berates me
Exhausted, the memories are drawing so near
I can see it like a world premiere
When did my objective lose all objectiveness?

That's got me thinkin' that we're never gonna get it right
I wanna straighten this before the sun goes down tonight
If I could only fight the bitterness I feel inside
This thing is eatin' me alive

[Chorus]
Well I'm right here
And you're right there
And God knows we've got to start somewhere
'Cause I'm messed up
And you're broken
And those shots we fired are still smokin'

If I need you, and you need me
How can you turn your back and just leave me?
When I'm right here, and you're right there
And God knows we've got to start somewhere

I said some things that I regret
And if I could, I'd take 'em back
If I could turn my words around
You wouldn't hear a sound

But here I am, and there you are
The space between us is not so far
I'm reaching out my hand in love
Before the fading sun, forgive me for what I've done

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
Well I'm right here
And you're right there
And God knows we've got to start somewhere
'Cause I'm messed up
And you're broken
And those shots we fired are still smokin'

If I need you, and you need me
How can you turn your back and just leave me?
When I'm right here, and you're right there
And God knows we've got to start somewhere

The gun shot's gotta go, man. That's it
I mean, enough is enough
Good grief
