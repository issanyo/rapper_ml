[Verse 1: tobyMac]
The other night I met a girl and she looked to be so nice
I asked her for the digits and she didn't think twice
A couple of days later called her up and asked her out
She said "With you?" I said "With me" and then she said "Without a doubt."
I took her to the Garden where I guess they grow the olives
She wore a tighter skirt than any I had seen in college
She said "I love to smoke and drink while cursing like a sailor"
I asked her where she got her mouth and if she had a tailor
Finally I walked her to the door to say good night
She said, "I am an apple would you care to take a bite."
Politely I refused and said, "I'm looking for a lady."
So she slapped me in my face and said "Boy you must be crazy."

[Hook]
She's that kinda girl
Different from the ones before
Cause I know she loves the Lord
She's that kinda girl
Virtuous in every way
The kinda girl that makes you say
"I hope she comes my way."

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
Well I'm looking for a girl who's virtuous
Cause God laid it on my heart to search for this
So I open up the Word to the book of Proverbs
The 31st chapter tells me all about her
Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain
A woman who fears the Lord, she ain't playin'
Hear what I'm saying cause I'm saying it clearly
She's the kinda girl I gots to have near me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: tobyMac]
Well I'm lookin' into hookin' with a lady
And not a girly of the worldy that's shady
But the kinda girl you meet behind the doors of the church
You see, God will bring her to me so I don't have to search
Too hard, I've been scarred by the ones of the past
So put an APB out on the one that'll last
A little longer than a roll in the hay for sure
But a bonafide lady's what I'm praying for

[Bridge]
When I finally meet her
I'll know how to treat her
By fulfilling all her needs
Love her and respect her
Cherish her forever
She's the kinda girl for me

[Outro]
She's that kinda girl
Different from the ones before
Cause I know she loves the Lord
She's that kinda girl
Perfect for each other
There'll never be another for me
She's that kinda girl
Virtuous in every way
The kinda girl that makes you say
"I hope she comes my way."

[Bridge]
