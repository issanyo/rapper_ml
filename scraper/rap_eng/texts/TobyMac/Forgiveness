[Intro: TobyMac]
Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we all step across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find, we find...

[Verse 1: TobyMac]
It's hangin' over him like the clouds of Seattle
And rainin' on his swag, falling deeper in the saddle
Its written on his face, he don't have to speak a sound
Somebody call the Five-0, we gotta man down

[Bridge: TobyMac]
You can go and play it like you're all rock and roll
But guilt does a job on each and every man's soul
And when your head hits the pillow at the nightfall
You can bet your life that it's gonna be a fight, y'all

[Hook: TobyMac]
Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness, forgiveness
And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day
Sweeter than the day we call
Out for forgiveness
(We all need, we all need, we all need)
Forgiveness
(We all need, we all need, we all need)
Mr. Lecrae

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
My momma told me what I would be in for
If I kept all this anger inside of me pent up
My heart been broken, my wounds been open
And I don't know if I can hear "I'm sorry" being spoken
But those forgiven much should be quicker to give it
And God forgave me for it all, Jesus bled forgiveness
So when the stones fly, and they aimed at you
Just say, "Forgive 'em, Father, they know not what they do"

[Bridge: TobyMac & Nirva Ready]
You can go and play it like you're all rock and roll
But guilt does a job on each and every man's soul
And when your head hits the pillow at the nightfall
You can bet your life that it's gonna be a fight, y'all

[Hook: TobyMac]
Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness, forgiveness
And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day
Sweeter than the day we call
Out for forgiveness
We all need, we all need, we all need
Forgiveness
We all need, we all need, we all need

[Bridge: Lecrae]
We all need that that that
We all need that that that
We all need that that that
We all need that that that

[Bridge: TobyMac]
No matter how lost you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
No matter how hurt you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
No matter how wrong you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
No matter who you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
From forgiveness
Ask for forgiveness

[Hook: TobyMac]
Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness, forgiveness
And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day
Sweeter than the day we call
Out for forgiveness
We all need, we all need, we all need
Forgiveness
We all need, we all need, we all need
