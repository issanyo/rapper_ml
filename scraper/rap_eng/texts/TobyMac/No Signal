I'm on Flight 92, stuck on this runway
Waiting for a storm to pass before we take
Off, I just wanna get home, Lord
I'm getting no signal on my cellular phone

I got my wife and my kids waiting for their daddy
At the baggage claim, Lord, I miss my family
I just wanna get home, Lord
I'm getting no signal on my cellular phone

I just want to wake up, talk to the morning sun
Kiss my Mandy on the cheek, grab some breakfast and run
I love my family, Lord, bless my family
Please tell my family I'll be home soon

I love my kids, y'know they love their dad
And I'm with them no matter where i'm at
So they know, I love my family, Lord, bless my family
Please tell my family I'll be home soon

I'm on Flight 92, stuck on this runway
Waiting for a storm to pass before we take
Off, I just wanna get home, Lord
I'm getting no signal on my cellular phone

(This is your captain speaking, and we are clear to take off.)
