[Intro: tobyMac]
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before time to react
This means war ready to attack
I've been transformed

[Verse 1: Shonlock]
Funny how everything change
New main-framed
Know I got life in my veins
Being reborn far from the norm
My soul transformed
We are connected
Brand new perspective
Synchronized digitized solar reflective
Love so obsesive
Served and protected
Locked and I'm loaded
This weapons perfected

[Bridge: Shonlock]
All alone
I'm a one man army, oh
But with you
I stand a trillion strong

[Hook: tobyMac]
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before time to react
This means war ready to attack
I've been transformed
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before time to react
This means war ready to attack
I've been transformed

[Verse 2: Shonlock]
Picture me (as) paper in the hands of my creator
I'm pressed and fine creased
Origami caterpillar cocoon butterfly by noon
Shape shifting of clouds the beautiful blossoms bloom
Respect it color corrected beyond the science of human genetics
Love so obsessive
Served and protected
Locked and I'm loaded this weapons perfected

[Bridge: Shonlock]
All alone
I'm a one man army
But with you
I stand a trillion strong

[Hook: tobyMac]
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before time to react
This means war ready to attack
I've been transformed
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before timd to react
This means war ready to attack
I've been transformed

[Bridge]
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before
Never going back
I've been transformed
Never going back
This means war
Ready for attack
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before
Never going back
I've been transformed
Never going back
This means war
Ready for attack

[Hook: tobyMac]
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before time to react
This means war ready to attack
I've been transformed
I've been transformed
Never going back
Better than before time to react
This means war ready to attack
I've been transformed
