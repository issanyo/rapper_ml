Well it started out in the spare bedroom
Two turned tables uh and a microphone
I was flipping over 33's
Working on rhymes and melodies
Searching for some more review (can't hear the less of me)
It's never been my dream
To see my face in magazines
It's always been about the music
Hoping God would use it to set some people free
But I can say without a doubt
I never had it figured out
Won't you open every door I've stepped through yea?
And I try to keep my head about it
I'm thankful for the friends around me
I'm thankful for You yea yea yea
I'm thankful for You
I've been on this road
But you come to my shows
Sometimes just to feel what y'all
(But at times we're closed)
But you've been right there to rock with us
We come together, we lift him up
Seeing You there inspires me, put Your fire in me
It's never been my dream
To read my name in magazines
It's always been about the music
Praying God would use it to set some people free
But I can say without a doubt
I never had it figured out
Won't you open every door I've stepped through yea?
And I try to keep my head about it
So thankful for the friends around me
I'm thankful for You yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
I'm thankful for You yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
I'm thankful for You
It's such a free feeling that You got me feeling
We're all good all good all good
I love this free feeling that You got me feeling
We're all good all good all good
Said I love that free feeling that You got me feeling
We're all good all good all good
Yea they say you become who you hang out with
Well I can tell you for sure
You made me a better man
And I can say without a doubt
I never had it figured out
Won't you open every door I've stepped through yea?
And I try to keep my head about it
So thankful for the friends around me
I'm thankful for You yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
I'm thankful for You yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
I'm thankful for You
Thankful for You
Thankful for You
That's it
