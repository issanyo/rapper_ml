[Verse 1]
Are you tired of the life
That leaves us begging for more?
We got our heads in the clouds
But our feet on the floor
We tend to chase everything
That ends up leaving us dry
We need a voice, one voice that is amplified

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel momentum shifting?
Can you hear the sound?
We were once among the missing
But we have been found
It starts now

[Chorus]
So raise a fist high
This is the first night
The beginning of forever
Now let the old die
Cause there is new life
Forever starts tonight
Our time is now, now, now, now

[Verse 2]
It only takes one second
To turn it around
We got our minds made up
Let's put our stake in the ground
All the pain, all the shame
Have you had enough of it?
Are you ready for the change?

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Nothing can divide or take away
That our time is now
We rise from ashes
Kings and queens
Our time is now
Our time is now

[Chorus]

Now, now, now, now
