[Verse 1]
Well, I thought that I had seen most everything
And if jaded was a people, I'd be the king
So cold to what a brand new day could bring
So icy cold to all the wonder that should be movin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Overthinking You ('Ing you), hot like June (Like June)
I'm jumpin' out my skin just tryin' to catch of a view (Catch a view), Woo

[Chorus]
You got me on the edge
Got me on the edge of my seat
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
You got me on the edge
I am on the edge of my seat
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Lost all my worries, feels like Christmas came early (Hey)
Yeah, I can stay here day and night and never feel no hurry
Needless to mention, Lord, You got my attention (My attention)
My eyes are wide with wonder, feelin' for the soul ascension (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause no one else is ever gonna do for me
Ever gonna do for me what You'd do for me, yeah
Ain't no one ever gonna steal the mystery You put right in front o' me
Right in front o' me, yeah

[Chorus]
You got me on the edge
Got me on the edge of my seat
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
You got me on the edge
I am on the edge of my seat
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
You got me on the edge (Woo)
I am on the edge of my seat
And I can feel the wonder rushin' over me

[Bridge]
You are openin' my eyes
You're openin' my eyes, Lord
To brand new possibilities
You are openin' my eyes
Openin' my eyes, Lord (Yes, Lord)
To brand new possibilities
You are openin' my eyes
Openin' my eyes, Lord
To brand new possibilities (Yeah)
You are openin' my eyes
Openin' my eyes, Lord (My eyes, Lord)
To brand new possibilities ('Bilities, 'bilities)

[Interlude]
Behold, I am doin' a new thing in the land
It's springin' forth
Do you believe it? (Hey!)

[Chorus]
You got me on the edge
I am on the edge of my seat
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
You got me on the edge
I am on the edge of my seat
I can feel it rushin' over me (Yeah)
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
You got me on the edge
I am on the edge of my seat
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
You got me, You got me on the edge
I am on the edge of my seat
I can feel it rushin' over me (Woo)
(To brand new possibilities)
I can feel it rushin' over me

[Outro]
You are openin' my eyes (Yes, yes, yes)
Openin' my eyes, Lord (You got)
To brand new possibilities
(You got me on the edge, the edge)
You are openin' my eyes
Openin' my eyes, Lord
