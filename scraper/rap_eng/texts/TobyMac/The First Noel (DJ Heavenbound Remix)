[Verse 1: tobyMac]
The first Noel, the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds, in fields where they lay
In fields where they, lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

[Chorus: tobyMac]
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

[Verse 2: Owl City]
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

[Chorus: Owl City]
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel (Noel!) Noel (Noel!)
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

[Bridge: tobyMac]
The love You shared, even scared
Oh, the shepherds they were so afraid
You flipped it all on, that very first Christmas day
So I'ma yell "Noel," on the streets like a newsie
And sing Emmanuel, 'til this earth gotta lose me

[Chorus: tobyMac]
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel (Noel!) Noel (Noel!)
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
