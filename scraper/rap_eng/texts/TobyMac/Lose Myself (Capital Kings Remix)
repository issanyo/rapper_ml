Take all of the good and all of the bad
‘Cause all of it’s on me
Take all of my ways, the things that I chase
The things that control me
And all that I hide, could You bring me to life?
Could You open my eyes and show me?
Take all that was me and shape it to be
Reflecting You soully
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find You
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find You
I don’t care how it sounds
Burn it up to the ground
Your kingdom, my desire
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find.. to find You..
As all of the fates, I’ll be on my way
The wreckage behind me
My feet on the ground
Two hands reaching out
The future is blinding
So what is stirring in You?
Please, stir up in me
All the dreams that You placed inside me
Take all that You see and shape it to be
The story You’re writing
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find You
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find You
I don’t care how it sounds
Burn it all to the ground
Consume me with Your fire
I wanna lose myself, lose myself to find.. to find You..
I need to find You..
I need to find You..
I need to find You..
I need to find You..
So do not turn Your face from me, do not turn Your face
Do not turn Your face from me, do not turn Your face
Do not turn Your face from me, please don’t turn
I’m gonna lose myself, lose myself to find.. to find You..
I need to find You.. (so don’t)
I need to find You.. (so don’t)
I need to find You.. (so don’t)
I need to find You.. (so don’t)
I need to find You.. (so don’t)
I need to find You.. (so don’t.. Your face)
