[Verse 1: Jon White]
You came from heaven down to earth
And carried the weight of every pain and every hurt
Your life was a portrait of Your love
And like a beating drum now You are alive in us

[Chorus: Jon White]
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are

[Verse 2: Chris Tomlin]
We are a city that believes
That when we're lost in You we find everything we need
So let our lives be a portrait of Your love
And just like the rising sun break out and shine through us

[Chorus: John White & Chris Tomlin]
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are

[Bridge: Chris Tomlin]
You wreck us, You wreck us with Your love
And forever we are Yours, we are Yours
We are Yours
You wreck us, You wreck us with Your love
And forever we are Yours, we are Yours

[Chorus: Jon White & Chris Tomlin]
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No were never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are

[Bridge: Chris Tomlin]
You wreck us, You wreck us with Your love
And forever we are Yours, we are Yours
We are Yours
You wreck us, You wreck us with Your love
And forever we are Yours, we are Yours
