Do you remember
The southern breakfast treat
Referred to as grits
But it looks like cream of wheat

(chorus:)
Don't bring me down
Please, please
Don't bring me down

(repeat chorus)
Check this
Yo, I know a secret
Too hard not to tell

(Don't bring me down)
If grits was locked up
Gotee would post bail

(repeat chorus x2)
Are you familiar
With the southern breakfast treat
(Don't bring me down)
Referred to as breads
But to me it looks like
Spooky cream of wheat

(repeat chorus x3)
