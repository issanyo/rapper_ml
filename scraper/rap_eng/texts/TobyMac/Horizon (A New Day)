[Verse 1]
I feel the blood rushin' through my veins
I'm ready for change
They keep tellin' me to stay in my lane
But it's screamin' my name (Name, name)

[Verse 2]
My heart is racin' the elements we're facin'
Got us pushin' through the night (Night, night)
I feel the pressure, but when we come together
We'll journey to the morning light (Light, light)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's our destiny
No separatin' us 'cause we're family
Beautiful together
I do believe we can do anything in His name

[Chorus]
(A new day)
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon
(A new day)
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon
If you can see it, I can see it, we can be it
I believe in nothin' gonna stand in our way
(A new day)
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon (Horizon)

[Verse 3]
Uh, thicker than blood, thicker than earth
Soup ties so deep and wide (Wide)
There's comin' a day, comin' a day we gonna rise up
We won't give up the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's our destiny
No separatin' us 'cause we're family
Beautiful together
I do believe we can do anything in His name

[Chorus]
(A new day)
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon
(A new day)
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon
If you can see it, I can see it, we can be it
I believe it, nothin' gon' stand in our way
(A new day)
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon (Horizon)

[Bridge]
Takin' all we are and bindin' it forever (Ever)
Together, never severed a song so much deeper than the skin
We're in a creator culture, even our names (Even our names)
Fall straight into the shadows of the depths of how we relate
Our body, our family, different parts but one and the same
Spiritual shame again, I can't 'cause the love we have is different
You could say what you say
But nothin' could stand in the way
Of the rising on the horizon
Open your eyes (Eyes, eyes, eyes) to a new day

[Chorus]
(A new day)
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon
(A new day)
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon
If you can see it, I can see it, we can be it
I believe it, nothin' gon' stand in our way
A new day (A new day) is on the horizon

[Outro]
Rise up if you're tired of the replay
And fists high if you're ready for a new day
Rise up if you're tired of the replay (Hey-ey)
Tired of the replay
Rise up if you're tired of the replay
And fists high if you're ready for a new day
Rise up if you're tired of the replay (Hey-ey)
Tired of the replay
