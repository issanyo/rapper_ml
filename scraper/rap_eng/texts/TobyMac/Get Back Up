[Verse 1]
You turned away when I looked you in the eye
And hesitated when I asked if you were alright
Seems like you're fighting for your life
But why, oh, why?

Wide awake in the middle of your nightmare
You saw it comin' but it hit you outta nowhere
And there's always scars
When you fall that far

[Chorus]
We lose our way, we get back up again
It's never too late to get back up again
And one day you gonna shine again
You may be knocked down but not out forever

Lose our way, we get back up again
So get up, get up, you gonna shine again
It's never too late to get back up again
You may be knocked down but not out forever
(May be knocked down but not out forever)

[Verse 2]
You rolled out at the dawning of the day
Heart racin' as you make your little get-away
It feels like you've been runnin' all your life
But why, oh, why?

So you pulled away from the love that would've been there
And start believin' that your situation's unfair
But there's always scars
When you fall that far

[Chorus]
We lose our way, we get back up again
It's never too late to get back up again
And one day you gonna shine again
You may be knocked down but not out forever

Lose our way, we get back up again
So get up, get up, you gonna shine again
It's never too late to get back up again
You may be knocked down but not out forever
(May be knocked down but not out forever)

[Bridge]
This is love callin', love callin'
Out to the broken
This is love callin' (3x)

[Chorus]
We lose our way, we get back up again
It's never too late
You may be knocked down but not out forever

We lose our way, we get back up again
So get up, get up, you gonna shine again
It's never too late to get back up again
You may be knocked down but not out forever

[Bridge]
This is love callin', love callin'
(Lose our way, we get back up again)
Out to the broken
This is love callin'
(It's never too late)
(You may be knocked down but not out forever)

This is love callin', love callin'
(Lose our way, we get back up again)
Out to the broken
This is love callin'
(It's never too late)
(You may be knocked down but not out forever)

[Outro]
This is love callin', love callin'
Out to the broken
This is love callin'
