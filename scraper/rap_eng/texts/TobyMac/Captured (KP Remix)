All I wanna do
All I wanna do
Iâ€™m Your prisoner by choice
I will rest at Your feet
And Iâ€™ll only lift my voice
When You want me to sing
Itâ€™s the beauty of Your covering thatâ€™s stealing my heart
And itâ€™s the mystery of You that tears me apart
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And if I should get a peaceful sleep
I wanna wake at my Fatherâ€™s feet
All I wanna do is get into You
You got me captured
By Your love
All I wanna do is stay here with You
You got me raptured
Canâ€™t get enough
Letâ€™s go
The sunâ€™s on the rise
The sleepâ€™s in my eyes
The dewâ€™s on the ground
The night is disguised
Thereâ€™s hope in the air
Iâ€™m fresh off a prayer
The blue mountain bean is clearinâ€™ my stare
I make recompense
Itâ€™s all makinâ€™ sense
Like blood in my veins
Youâ€™re my sustenance
A moment of trust
The â€œmeâ€ becomes â€œusâ€
The â€œweâ€ become â€œoneâ€
Your gift is my gust of wind
â€˜Til we meet again
So faith, donâ€™t fail me now
If you touch my heart
You can feel it pound
So faith, donâ€™t fail me now
So faith, donâ€™t fail me now
If you touch my heart
You can feel it poundinâ€™
So faith, donâ€™t fail me now
So faith, donâ€™t fail me now
When I touch my heart
I can feel it pound
Gotta get myself up off this ground
Faith, donâ€™t fail me now
You got me, and You wonâ€™t let go
