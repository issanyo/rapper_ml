[Verse 1: tobyMac & Capital Kings]
Fell out of the sky
Hit the ground running
The future is tonight
They'll never see us coming
Takin' by this urgency, won't let this moment pass
The Kingdom is alive
We're stepping on the gas

This is life, this is life
This is life, this is life
This is life, this is life
This is life, this is life
Life, life, life, life, life
This is not a test

[Drop]
This is not a, this is not a test
This is not a, this is not a test
This is not a, this is not a test
This is not a, this is not a test

[Refrain: tobyMac & Capital Kings]
We're checking in, so check it out
We're dropping in, there ain't no stopping us now
We're breathing in, we're breathing out
We're dropping in, there ain't no stopping us now
We've only got one shot
Gonna take it now
Going all in, gonna make it count
Won't look back, gotta set my eyes
Cause there ain't no practice runs in life

[Bridge: tobyMac & Capital Kings]
This is life, this is life
This is life, this is life
This is life, this is life
This is life, this is life
Life, life, life, life, life
This is not a test

[Drop]
Woooaahh!
Woooaahh!
This is not a test
This is not a test
This is not a test, test, test, t-t-t-t-t-test
Test, test, t-t-t-t-t-test
Test, test, t-t-t-t-t-test
This is not a test!
