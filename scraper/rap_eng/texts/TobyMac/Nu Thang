[Bridge]
Ya know He's doin' it
God is doin' a nu thang
Ya know He's doin' it
God is doin' a nu thang
[x2]

[Verse 1: TobyMac]
My God is doin' a brand nu thang
But, since time began, He remains the same
Faithful, forever to His word
And solid, a cornerstone unstirred
But, look down through the ages and you will find
God doesn't change, but He knows the time
From harp to piano, and song to rap
Ya know, God's wit' us, so we can not lack and so

[Hook: Kevin Max & Michael Tait]
God is doin' a nu thang
In our lives so
We're doin' a nu thang
Through Jesus Christ
God is doin' a nu thang
Through our music
We're doin' a nu thang
So He can use it

[Verse 2: TobyMac]
God's usin' this music and we're comin' strong
DC Talkin', often singin' a song
To make ya think twice 'bout the way thatcha live
And, let ya know Christ is the one that'll give
Peace in ya heart, a nu start
Call on the Lord and He'll do His part
A brand nu thang to ya raggedy walk
He might just match it up to that big ol' talk

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: TobyMac]
Like an MC, I'm here to boast
I rap about Christ, yo here's a dose
So loud and proud of the God I serve
Try to say He ain't wit' it, huh, ya got nerve
Christ is the reason for DC Talk
He's the focus of our daily walk, y'all
Without Him, we ain't nothin' but names
But through God, we're doin' brand nu thangs

[Hook]

[Outro]
God is doin' a nu thang
We're doin' a nu thang
God is doin' a nu thang
We're doin' a nu thang

God is doin' a nu thang
We're doin' a nu thang
God is doin' a nu thang
We're doin' a nu thang

God is doin' a nu thang
We're doin' a nu thang
God is doin' a nu thang
We're doin' a nu thang
