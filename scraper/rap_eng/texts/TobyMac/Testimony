Hey, yo, yo, T. What's up man?
Why don't you tell em that story
About how you went back in the day
In the hip hop day, ya know what I'm sayin
Yeah, tell 'em that story, man

We're gonna go back to the basics
Of the hip hop scene

Just a loop and some lyrics and a mike
Ya know what I mean?

I was just a mere child in
The capital of the nation

When I heard 'Sugar Hill'
On my favorite station

I dropped all I was doin'
Took a train to the city

To douglas records and the wizz
'Rappers Delight' was the ditty

No scritty for my palitty, no pop for my cicle
And since that day, I was never ever fickle

(Ahhhh yeah, yo that was smooth T
That was smooth, that real real smooth
I like that story...)
