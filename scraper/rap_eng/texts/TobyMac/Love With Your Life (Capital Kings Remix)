[Intro]
Yeah we got
Yeah we got
Yeah we got
(4x)

[Verse 1]
There's only so much you can say
Till words turn into noise
Yeah we go round and round again
But people we were meant to blaze
A life that's beautiful
Yeah we got so much love to give

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look to the left or right
You know the future's worth the fight
Don't look to the left or right
Hey yeah
L-O-V-E rolls off the tongue
But sometimes the word's just not enough
Gotta dig a little, dig a little deeper
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
You gotta love with your life
Like a fire burning strong
Till the night has come and gone
There's a hope that lives in you
You gotta love with your life
Like a warrior
Fight, lay it on the line
If you wanna see a change
You gotta love with your life
If you wanna see a change
You gotta love with your life

[Refrain]
Yeah we got (8x)
You gotta love with your life
(2x)

[Verse 3]
You crash into a brand new day
The world's up in your face
And they gon' whisper in your ear
Just push 'em back you need your space
To be who you gon' be
You got so much more to give

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look to the left or right
You know the future's worth the fight
Don't look to the left or right
Hey yeah
L-O-V-E rolls off the tongue
But sometimes the word's just not enough
Gotta dig a little, dig a little deeper
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
You gotta love with your life
Like a fire burning strong
Til' the night has come and gone
There's a hope that lives in you
You gotta love with your life
Like a warrior
Fight, lay it on the line
If you wanna see a change
You gotta love with your life
If you wanna see a change
You gotta love with your life
If you wanna see a change
You gotta love with your life

[Bridge]
Don't let it pass us by
Every day and night
Gotta love with your life
Every day and night
Don't let it pass us by

[Refrain]
Yeah we got (8x)
You gotta love with your life
(2x)
