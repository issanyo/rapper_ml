[Intro: Nirva Ready]
Oh-oh--oh-ooh
Oh-oh--oh-oh
Oh-oh--oh-ooh

[Verse 1: tobyMac]
Now Jonnie never got his wish, December 25th
That's what he said when we left the orphanage
Nine years old but Jonnie was an old soul
Gonna spend his first Christmas in a real home
Then he showed me a picture, he made the night before
A drawing of a man standin' outside the door
He said, "I see him in my dreams
He comforts me when I can't sleep"

[Chorus 1: Nirva Ready]
Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters
This Christmas, this Christmas

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
"Believe in angels?", He asked starin' at the sky
I said, "I do" and saw a sparkle in his eye
Big brother for the weekend, respondin' to the season
I took the chance, that givin's better than receivin'
Two nights, a new family, some holiday cheer
We laughed and sang, came on a midnight clear
We gave, received, and as we headed to a close
We looked to the heavens and it started snowing blessings

[Chorus 2: Nirva Ready]
Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters
This Christmas, this Christmas
Father, let us not forget
The children who are all alone
This Christmas, this Christmas

[Monologue: Kid]
Religion that God our Father
Accepts as pure and faultless is this:
That we look after orphans, and widows
In their distress
Merry Christmas everyone

[Bridge: Nirva Ready]
Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let Heaven and nature sing
Let Heaven and nature sing
Let Heaven and nature si-i-i-ing!...

[Verse 3: tobyMac]
Big brother turned dad in a couple weeks
Some gifts give more than you could ever dream
Started out as a plan just to do my part
But that little man went and stole my heart

[Chorus 2: Nirva Ready]
Ooh! Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters
This Christmas, this Christmas
Father, let us not forget
The children who are all alone
This Christmas, this Christmas

[Post-Chorus: Nirva Ready]
Oh-oh--oh-ooh, oh-oh--oh-ooh
Let Heaven and nature sing
Let Heaven and nature sing
Oh-oh--oh-ooh, oh-oh--oh-ooh
Let Heaven and nature sing
Let Heaven and nature sing

[Outro: tobyMac]
From me and mine, to you and yours
Merry Christmas
This year; reach out and love somebody, y'all
