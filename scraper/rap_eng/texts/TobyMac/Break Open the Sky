From the lips of desperation
Different nations, every man's cry
Comes a song of anticipation
As we wait for a crack in the sky
Side by side, we recognize that
Hope has brought us together tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Break open the sky
Won't You turn off gravity so we can fly?
We wanna see Your face
So tear the roof off this place
Jesus, break open the sky
So we sing
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We believe, and we imagine
'Til the dawn of our beautiful dreams
Through the noise, I hear the voices
Melodies that are flooding our streets
Not forgotten, are your people
So let a thousand church bells ring
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Come, Jesus, come
Come quickly
Come quickly
Break open, open the sky
