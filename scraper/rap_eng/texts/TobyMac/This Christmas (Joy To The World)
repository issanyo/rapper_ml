Joy to the world
Let Heaven and nature sing
Let Heaven and nature sing
Now Jonnie's never got his wish on December 25th
That's what he said when he left the orphanage
9 years old, but Jonnie was an old soul
Gonna spend his first Christmas in a real home
Showed me a picture that he drew the night before
Was a picture of a man standin' outside a door
I asked him who it was and he said someone I only see in dreams
Comforts me when I cry myself to sleep
Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters this Christmas, this Christmas
"Believe in angels?" Jonnie asked me starin' at the sky
I said, "I do" and saw a sparkle in his eye
Big brother for the weekend respondin' to the season
Took the chance that giving's better than recievin'
Two nights, a new family, some holiday cheer
We laughed and sang, came on a midnight clear
We gave, received, and as we headed to close
We looked to the heavens and it started to snow down blessings
Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters this Christmas, this Christmas
Father let us not forget
The children who are all alone this Christmas, this Christmas
Religion that God our Father
Accepts as pure and faultless is this
To look after orphans and widows in their distress
Merry Christmas everyone
Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let Heaven and nature sing
Let Heaven and nature sing
Let Heaven and nature sing
Let Heaven and nature sing
"Believe in angels?" Jonnie asked me starin' at the sky
I said, "I do", and saw a sparkle in his eye
9 years old, but Jonnie was an old soul
Gonna spend is next Christmas in a real home
Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters this Christmas, this Christmas
Father let us not forget
The children who are all alone this Christmas, this Christmas
Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters this Christmas, this Christmas
Father, let us not forget
The children who are all alone this Christmas, this Christmas
You ain't livin', you ain't livin'
Father, this Christmas
You ain't livin', you ain't livin'
You ain't livin' till you choose to give
Merry Christmas, everyone
