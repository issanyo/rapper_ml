[Intro: Ayiesha Woods and (Paul Wright)]
Ooh, oooh, ooh
(Just between you and me, I've got something to say...)
Hey, hey, hey...

[Verse 1: Paul Wright and Ayiesha Woods]
Sorrow is a lonely feeling
Unsettled is a painful place
I've lived with both for far too long now
Since we've parted ways
And I've been wrestling with my conscience
And I found myself to blame
If there's to be any resolution
I've got to peel my pride away

[Chorus: Ayiesha Woods and (Paul Wright)]
Just between you and me
I've got something' to say (I've got something to say)
I wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down
Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made (Confession needs to be made)
Recompense is my way to freedom now
Just between you and me
I've got something to say (I've got something to say)

[Verse 2: Paul Wright and Ayiesha Woods]
Confession is the road to healing
Forgiveness is the promised land
I'm reaching out in my conviction
I'm longing to make amends
So, I'm sorry for the words I've spoken
For I've betrayed a friend
We've got a love that's worth preserving
And a bond I will defend

[Chorus: Ayiesha Woods and (Paul Wright)]
Just between you and me
I've got something' to say (I've got something to say)
I wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down
Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made (Confession needs to be made)
Recompense is my way to freedom now
Just between you and me
I've got something to say (I've got something to say)

[Bridge: Paul Wright]
In my pursuit of God, I thirst for holiness
As I approach the Son, I must consider this
Offenses unresolved, they'll keep me from the throne
Before I go to Him my wrong must be atoned

[Pre-Chorus: Ayiesha Woods]
If there's to be any resolution
I've got to peel my pride away

[Chorus 2: Ayiesha Woods]
Just between you and me
I've got something' to say
I wanna get it straight (Wanna get it straight)
Before the sun goes down
Just between you and me (Just between you and me)
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom

[Outro: Paul Wright and (Ayiesha Woods)]
(It's the way to freedom, Ohh, oh, oh)
It's my way to freedom, It's my way to freedom (Ooh, I've got something to say, so let me, so let me say it today)
It's my way to freedom, It's my way to freedom (Said, I've got something to say, Confession, Confession needs to made)
It's my way to freedom, It's my way to freedom (I've got something to say, so let me say it today)
It's my way to freedom, It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom, It's my way to freedom
