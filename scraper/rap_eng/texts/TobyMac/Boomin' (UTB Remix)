[Intro]
This goes out to anyone
Out the stereo system

[Verse 1: tobyMac]
I've been around the way
I've been around the block
I got the keys to the city if the gates are locked
And a freak like me ain't ‘bout to stop
I got a hand full of dreams and a heart full of God
Everywhere we go they wonder where we're from
Well its diverse city ya'll welcome to come
It sits high on a hill you can see it for days
And even if you can't you can hear our praise
We go ...

[Hook: tobyMac]
Cause we're boomin' out the stereo system
This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
(Here to rep the most high with this one)
Boomin' out the stereo system
This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
Cause we rock for sure in stereo

[Verse 2: tobyMac]
If you're looking to slide, come slide with us
And if you're looking for a ride, it's a big old bus
We got black folk, white folk and Middle East
Mexican, Filipino - Jesus Freaks
Got a Haitian Princess, an Aussie Mate
East Coast, Midwest to left side of the states
And when the bus rolls, it’s out the dirty south
Tennessee and we keepin' it good and loud we go

[Hook: tobyMac]
Cause we're boomin' out the stereo system
This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
Here to rep the most high with this one
Boomin' out the stereo system
This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
Cause we rock for sure in stereo

[Bridge: tobyMac]
I got portable sounds to lift me up
Portable sounds to take me higher
Portable sounds to lift me up
So don't even try to get in my head (x2)
We got
Portable sounds, portable sounds, portable sounds, portable sounds
Portable sounds, portable sounds, portable sounds, portable sounds
Take us higher
Portable sounds to lift us up (portable sounds, portable sounds)
Portable sounds to take us higher (portable sounds, portable sounds)
Portable sounds to lift us up (portable sounds, portable sounds)
Portable sounds to take (portable sounds, portable sounds)

[Verse 3: Shonlock]
We go boom
Shakalaka I got 'em poppin' 'n' lockin' 'n' lockin' 'n' poppin'
I thinkin' they stopping 'bout to say somethin'
Boom
Let me check your technique
I speak life in riddle with a flow that you need
Boom
They mic every word that I utter
So tasty tantalising make room for stutter
Now here we go
Check out the scenario in the flow
Got it banging, boomin' out the stereo

[Hook: tobyMac]
Cause we're boomin' out the stereo system
This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
Here to represent the most high with this one
Boomin' out the stereo system
This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
Cause we rock for sho in stereo
Cause we rock for sho in stereo
