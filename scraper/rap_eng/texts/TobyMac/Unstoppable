We are, we are
We are, we are
We are, we are
We are, we are

We are the travelers, we look to the ever after
We are the strangers, we’re practically endangered
We know these roads here, they never seem to bode well
It's our predicament and we ain’t even sick of it

We make our moves in mysterious ways
We’d rather burn up, than stick to the shade
Not of this world so we live on the run
We keep our eyes set on what is to come

We are, we are (we are unstoppable)
We are, we are (for the impossible)
We are, we are (we are the kingdom come)
That’s who we are, that’s who we are

We are, we are (we are unstoppable)
We are, we are (for the impossible)
We are, we are (we are the kingdom come)
That’s who we are, that’s who we are

We keep it moving, this path is by our choosing
When we get tripped up we call above for lift up
Stay busy bashing while we proceed with passion
They say we missing it but I’m inclined to stick with this

We make our moves in mysterious ways
We’d rather burn up, than stick to the shade
Not of this world so we live on the run
We’ve got our hearts set on what is to come

We are, we are (we are unstoppable)
We are, we are (for the impossible)
We are, we are (we are the kingdom come)
That’s who we are, that’s who we are

We are, we are (we are unstoppable)
We are, we are (for the impossible)
We are, we are (we are the kingdom come)
That’s who we are, that’s who we are

There’s no disguising, the truth is rising
There’s no disguising, the truth is rising

To live is Christ, to die is Gain
We’re not afraid, we’re not afraid
To live is Christ, to die is Gain
So break the noise, we’re not afraid

We are, we are
We are, we are

We are, we are (we are unstoppable)
We are, we are (for the impossible)
We are, we are (we are the kingdom come)
That’s who we are, that’s who we are

We are unstoppable
That’s who we are, that’s who we are
For the impossible
That’s who we are, that’s who we are
Unstoppable
We are, that’s who we are
For the impossible
That’s who we are, that’s who we are
