[Intro]
Clap your hands, everybody
Everybody, just clap your hands
Clap your hands, everybody
Everybody, just clap your hands

[Verse 1]
Some things money can't buy but a man's gotta eat
Bread don't just fall out the sky and land at your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
I was tryin' to fly high but I ran low like I'm sittin' on E
And my well ran dry 'til You came and made it rain on me

[Chorus]
You fill my cup up 'till it overflows
And it's the sweetest love that I've ever known
So pour it on me, all that I need, deep down in my soul
Fill my cup up 'til it overflows

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
They say nothin' is perfect, that ain't true (No, sir)
'Cause You came and opened these eyes to the glory of You
You turned water to wine, You make a new man in me
And every time I'm runnin' empty

[Chorus]
You fill my cup up 'til it overflows
And it's the sweetest love that I've ever known
So pour it on me, all that I need, deep down in my soul
Fill my cup up 'til it overflows

[Post-Chorus]
Overflows
Overflows

[Bridge]
One, two, three, four
It ain't a glass half full or a glass half empty
It's runnin' over, it can't fit me
Down every side to the ground
Mo' than enough to go around
So come and get it, come and get it while it's hot
Come and get it, come and get it nonstop
'Cause the only thing sweeter than a love song
Is singin' of love that goes on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
You fill my cup up 'til it overflows
You are the sweetest love, sweetest love that I've ever known
So pour it on me, all that I need, deep down in my soul
Fill my cup up 'til it overflows

[Post-Chorus]
That's what I'm talkin' about
Overflows
Uh
Overflows
(Bubblin', bubblin', bubblin', bubblin', bubblin', bubblin', bubblin', bubblin')

[Outro]
Clap your hands, everybody
Everybody, just clap your hands
Clap your hands, everybody
Everybody, just clap your hands
