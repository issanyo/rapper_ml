Well I'm wonderin' bout the road ahead of me
Wonderin' bout the things you said to me
Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do
And I'm wonderin' 'bout the way I spend my days
Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase
Wonderin' if they're stealin' me from you

Uh! We didn't know what to do
But you were lookin at me and I was lookin at you
And we were thinkin' it odd but we were thankin' our God
For the hope that He put down deep in our hearts
And yo, without a second to think
We was tourin' around and we were making that bank
And we was ridin' in style clockin' them miles
With the songs that He put down deep in our hearts

Well I'm wonderin' bout the road ahead of me
Wonderin' bout the things you said to me
Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do
And I'm wonderin' 'bout the way I spend my days
Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase
Wonderin' if they're stealin' me from you

Yeah, it's been a minute my friend
And you and I, we never thought it would end
But when we stopped to pause, it opens the doors
On some dreams that were put down deep in my heart
But hey, I'm always thinkin' of you
And I can see your influence in the things that I do
Thick and thin, forever my friend
Cause there's a bond that was put down deep in our hearts

Well I'm wonderin' bout the road ahead of me
Wonderin' bout the things you said to me
Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do
And I'm wonderin' 'bout the way I spend my days
Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase
Wonderin' if they're stealin' me from you

We didn't know what to do
You were lookin at me and I was lookin at you
We were thinkin' it odd but we were thankin' our God
For the hope that He put down deep in our hearts
And hey, if I could turn back time
I wouldn't touch a day, I wouldn't shade the shine
Cause I do know this, I won't be remiss
With the memories locked away in my heart (locked away in my heart..)

Well I'm wonderin' bout the road ahead of me
Wonderin' bout the things you said to me
Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do
And I'm wonderin' 'bout the way I spend my days
Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase
Wonderin' if they're stealin' me from you

Wonderin' if we ever had a clue
