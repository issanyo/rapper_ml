[Hook: Kevin Max]
Some people gotta learn the hardway
I guess I'm the kinda guy
That has to find out for myself
I had to learn the hardway, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm crying for help

[Verse 1: tobyMac & Michael Tait]
Now I've been high and I've been low
I've been some places that you would not go
I never thought there would come the day
When I wished I never would've lived this way
But I've been searching for a long, long time
I thought the devil was a friend of mine
I turned my back on everything that was true
And wasted years that belong to you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: tobyMac & Michael Tait]
It took so long for me to see
That I'm a victim of nature and me
Left to myself I realize
I am a maker of my own demise
But you accept me every time and again
And never mention just how selfish i've been
Why must it always take me so long to see
That I have fallen but you will forgive me?

[Hook x2]

[Outro: tobyMac]
The warning signs are like flares in the night
Still I proceed my greed is in spite of the fire
I know that's bound to burn
Why is it that I always gotta learn...
The hard way, the hard way, I had to learn the hard way
The hard way, the hard way, I had to learn the hard way
