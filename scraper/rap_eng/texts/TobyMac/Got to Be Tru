G-O-T-T-O-B-T-R-U

[Verse 1: Steven Curtis Chapman]
Well normally at this point you'd hear me sing
And I'd be doing that acoustic guitar thing
So by now you're probably wondering what's going on
'Cause this is really starting to sound like one of those rap songs
Well let me tell you what the boy's up to
You see I like rap music and the beat box groove
And sometimes I gotta admit I close all the doors
And wave my arms around and I pace the floor
But then I crack up laughing, I gotta stop
And just face the facts the boy don't hip hop
You see I grew up in a state where the grass is blue
So if it's gonna be believable it's got to b tru

[Chorus]
It's got to b tru I've gotta be living what I say I believe
It's got to b tru even when nobody but Jesus is watching me
It's got to b tru every single minute of every day
If anybody's ever gonna look at me and say hey it's got to b tru

[Steven Curtis Chapman]
You hear me saying that it's got to b tru
And no my homeboy Toby wants to talk to you

[Verse 2: Tobymac]
Tru check it out I got a next door neighbor
And I can tell he's been watching my behavior
Yo he's heard that I'm a Christian guy
He wants to know if that's the truth or a lie
He's got a list of reasons not to believe
Like doubt, dissolution, hypocrisy
It's gonna take some living proof to break through those walls
Yea, it's got to b tru if he'll believe at all

(Chorus)

Whoa it's got to b tru, gotta let the light of Jesus' love come shining thru

(Chorus)

So yo

(Chorus)

It's got to b tru

(3x)

I gotta let the light of Jesus' love come shining thru

(Chorus)
