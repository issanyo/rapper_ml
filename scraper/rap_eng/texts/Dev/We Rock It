[Intro]
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it

[Verse 1]
It's Sunday night, it's Monday morning
I give you warning that I might have to board this flight, flight
Just to board it cause life is boring and I might be snoring
But I'll still pour this drink up, up, and then destroy it
If you drive it, floor it, if you hide it, store it
Cause I'll find it and I'll take it, and I won't ignore it
That I'm creating what you're imitating
Bitch, calm down, you know my situation

[Break]

[Chorus]
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it all night
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it all night

[Verse 2]
I need a drink, and a late night dream, but watch out
I place my own team, I shoot with my own gun
Throw it away and find another one
When I hit the club, I need head room so I can turn the dance floor into my bedroom
I got a sweet tooth for brandy, I like strangers with candy
My policy is privacy, in the driver's seat
I'd probably let you in my property, but that don't mean monogamy
No, there's no stopping me, I like to play Monopoly
As long as you keep watching me, flocking to me and talking to me

[Break]

[Chorus]
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it all night
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it all night

[Bridge]
It feels so right, it must be wrong
Please excuse me while I rock you all night long, all night long
When I go left, you go right
You and me on track, we rock it all night
All night long, all night long
You and me on track, we rock it all night
All night long, all night long
You and me on track, we rock it all night

[Chorus]
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it all night
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it
We rock it all night
