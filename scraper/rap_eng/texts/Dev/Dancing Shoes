[Chorus]
I'm putting on my dancing shoes tonight
Ten thousand people waiting for me
I can hear them outside from the curtain I sit behind
The drums kick in and the lights go down
My heartbeat drowns out the sound
My hands go up, I sing my song
And a thousand voices sing along

[Verse 1]
I used to lay awake
Hear a crowd roar to every word I say
Now the stars, they used to shine so bright
They were all replaced by candle lights
And they grow, whoa
Makes it harder to find the places that we know

[Chorus]
I'm putting on my dancing shoes tonight
Ten thousand people waiting for me
I can hear them outside from the curtain I sit behind
The drums kick in and the lights go down
My heartbeat drowns out the sound
My hands go up, I sing my song
And a thousand voices sing along

[Post-Chorus]
Can you hear? Close your eyes
Hearts are racing side by side
For you I sing, I sing for you
For you, I wear these dancing shoes
I wear these dancing shoes

[Bridge]
Are you out there? Can you hear me?
Are you out there? Can you hear me?
Are you out there? Can you hear me?
Are you out there? Can you hear me?

[Partial Chorus]
I'm putting on my dancing shoes tonight
Ten thousand people waiting for me
I can hear them outside

[Post-Chorus]
Can you hear? Close your eyes
Hearts are racing side-by-side
For you I sing, I sing for you
For you, I wear these dancing shoes
I wear these dancing shoes
I wear these dancing shoes
