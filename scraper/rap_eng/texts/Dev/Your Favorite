(Shit)

I wake up to a blunt brunch
And get head from a girl I've only met once. (once)
My day is looking pretty up
Cause I got a swag step in my lil' giddy-up
Let the weed burn
Drink a lil something
Cause I'm thirsty bitch!
You can't tell me nothing
I'm your girlfriends favorite
In a drop top cruising down Lankershim
(Get in)
I'm the shit, so you know she down to go
Got my hat to the side and my eyes real low
(What up?!)
Hit the clinic we can smoke a lil' more
And roll and roll and roll!

I'm her F-A-V-O-R-I-T-E
I'm her height man
You say 5 feet
Feeling like 10 feet
Hotter then Tempe
In the summer with no A.C
Driving girls crazy
Eyes telling stories
Ya'll looking boring
I've been up on my grind
While you mother fuckers snoring
Girls looking gorgeous
Breasts all enormous
And they let me feel'em
Young faves they adore us
Haaa, now I'll laugh for a little
Damn your boyfriend gets treated like a middle man
Or a minute man
Fruit like minute maid
Time is money so you know I get minute paid

I'm your favorite
And you can't get enough
