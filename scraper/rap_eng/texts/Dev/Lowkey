[Chorus]
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
Who's down to kick it with the homies
She don't complain when we get no sleep
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
Up late night eating macaroni, yeah
And she ain't worried about the old me, no
I need a girl who keep it lowkey

[Verse 1]
I need a girl who don't get stressed out
Cause long as she know she the best out
She need me, she just sent a text right now
I need a girl who sip horchata
Who ain't about the drama
A girl that gets down to bachata
Down to fuck a couple commas
I need a girl who says she loves me
Who makes me feel all bubbly
When we ain't sippin' on some bubbly
But we should go sip on some bubbly

[Chorus]
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
Who's down to kick it with the homies
She don't complain when we get no sleep
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
Up late night eating macaroni, yeah
And she ain't worried about the old me, no
I need a girl who keep it lowkey

[Bridge: Harmonization]

[Chorus]
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
Who's down to kick it with the homies
She don't complain when we get no sleep
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
Up late night eating macaroni, yeah
And she ain't worried about the old me, no
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
Who's down to kick it with the homies
She don't complain when we get no sleep
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
Up late night eating macaroni, yeah
And she ain't worried about the old me, no
I need a girl who keep it lowkey
