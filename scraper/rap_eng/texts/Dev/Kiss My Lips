[Intro: Fabolous]
Yeah
Hand up this high
Tell em haters kiss my
Hand up this high
Tell em i said kiss my
Hand up this high
Tell em do it

[Verse 1: Dev]
I was sittin' on the beach, starin' at the nite
Pulled out a ciggarette, and you were there with the light
What you tryin' to do, lookin' in my eyes
Pretty boy step back, you don't wanna take this fight
But if you wanna talk, well first you gotta listen
I ain't like those other girls that you been missin'
I knew it all along, queen of my throne
One of a kind, I'm in a league of my own

[Chorus: Dev]
And get your hand off my hip and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk?
Cause we're only gettin' older
I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over
I know you weren't expectin' this tonight
But, baby, that's me

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Ain't got an answer, but which lips are you talkin
Exotic dancer strut, I would tip you for walkin
We could role play, I'm Christopher Walken
I treat you like a queen, and I'm king of New York an
Welcome to my city, pretty fast pace, ain't it
I put on weight but the pockets the only place gained it
Life's better when sippin glasses of ace ain't it
Them other boys are jokers without they face painted
You play your cards right, you might get lucky tonight
Bring the vampire out, I suck and I bite
I'm a fuckin rapper, I fuck and I write
I got em throwin jabs, I'm duckin the rights
And bobbin the lefts, but I'm ready to counter
Lay out for the count, on the kitchen counter
Yeah the kitchen counter, call me Mr. Anywhere
What you think I'mma do when you whisper in my ear?

[Chorus: Dev]
And get your hand off my hip and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk?
Cause we're only gettin' older
I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over
I know you weren't expectin' this tonite
But, baby, that's me

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Bridge: Dev]
I know what you want, you know what I need
Show me what I came for
There's only one thing you gotta do for me
Just promise not to stop when I say so
I know what you want, you know what I need
Show me what I came for
There's only one thing you gotta do for me
Just promise not to stop when I say so

[Chorus: Dev]
And get your hand off my hip and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk?
Cause we're only gettin' older
I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over
I know you weren't expectin' this tonite
But, baby, that's me

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
