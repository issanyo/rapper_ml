[Hook]
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk

[Verse 1]
It was late night, no Scrabble, game night
I'm a handful, ain't I? Ain't I, ain't I?
Let me show you
Backseat, front door you
Pop the trunk, shut your mouth and turn that up

[Pre-Hook]
We ride by like there's no one there
And they stop and stare, yeah, they stop and stare
We ride by like nobody knows what's in my trunk
What's in my trunk)

[Hook]
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk

[Verse 2]
Riding in a saucy whip even if it's costly
I'mma be flossy, Maybeline shit, glossy
Watch out, spending it
Got bitches on deck and they mexican
Another street, green line
Don't stop 'til I hit the bay side

[Pre-Hook]
We ride by like there's no one there
And they stop and stare, yeah they stop and stare
We ride by like nobody knows what's in my trunk
What's in my trunk

[Hook]
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk

[Bridge]
Got the North, got the East, got the West with me
So I suggest you better not mess with me
Be cool, you don't wanna squat 'em
We could do the fool, but you dont want no problems
I put that on something, I put that on fathers
Put that on something, I put that on mamas
Put that on something, I put that on [?]
You run up on me, get your man beat up

[Hook]
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
