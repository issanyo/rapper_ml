[Verse 1]
Say you want a taste, get freaky, bruh
All up, all up in my face, want a piece of us
And there's enough Bombay for the each of us
We should throw a party in my place like the lease is up
Wait, wait, where my keys?
So much ganja in the sauna I can barely breathe
Got your bitch hitting licks, it's a rarity
Throwing hundreds in the cut, charity

[Chorus]
It's my party, so I'ma do it my way
Throwing bills, bills, bills, no Beyoncé
Ooh, that's my way, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's my party and somebody's birthday
Dollar bills, bills, bills on your body
Ooh, that's my way

[Verse 2]
Uh, flipping dimes, I'ma double up
Sipping slime from a double cup
Smoking sour in the shower, call it double dutch
While I'm rolling up a blunt on a bubble butt
Wait, sorry, I'm not sorry
It's non-stop when I hop out the Ferrari
One of one, bitch I'm a rarity
Throwing hundreds in the cut, charity

[Chorus]
It's my party, so I'ma do it my way
Throwing bills, bills, bills, no Beyoncé
Ooh, that's my way, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's my party and somebody's birthday
Dollar bills, bills, bills on your body
Ooh, that's my way

[Bridge]
It's my party, it, it, it, it
It's my party, party

[Chorus]
It's my party, so I'ma do it my way
Throwing bills, bills, bills, no Beyoncé
Ooh, that's my way, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's my party and somebody's birthday
Dollar bills, bills, bills on your body
Ooh, that's my way
