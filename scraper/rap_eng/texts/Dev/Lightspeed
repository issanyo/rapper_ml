[Verse 1]
They say I got to have a plan
I say if you don't burn, you won't tan
They say I gotta watch myself
I have my cake and watch it melt
Uh, I'm in a pocket with a rocket
I'mma cock it and blow the roof off this bougie club
Fuck the haters, give me some love
Don't be so pretentious
I fit gold like a dentist
And if I said it, then I meant it
He a soccer player, he head it
I'm going light speed
Drinking rice dream, dripping Visine
Bitch cover your eyes you won't find me
Even beside me, you behind me

[Chorus]
By the time you on it, I'll be off it
By the time you get it, I'll be done with it
You know that we be going light speed
Ahead, everybody told me I should slow down
But instead, all I can do is take it light speed
Outer space and there is no calculation
Tell me am I outta my head
Or are we really going light speed?
We are experiencing some turbulence

[Verse 2]
If you ain't on my flight, you gettin' flown over
Under a palm tree, that's where I'm lying
Like when I tell people I'm sober
Got a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other one
But I ain't never listen to none of 'em
It's been a crazy road runnin'
And I, I ain't never stop runnin'
People talking, 'bout somethin'
But I, I ain't never heard nothin'
The sun is set and the clouds are movin'
The sky is black and I'm used to it
We awake all night who knew it
I got a dark soul you can never see through it

[Chorus]
By the time you on it, I'll be off it
By the time you get it, I'll be done with it
You know that we be going light speed
Ahead, everybody told me I should slow down
But instead, all I can do is take it light speed
Outer space and there is no calculation
Tell me am I outta my head
Or are we really going light speed?
We are experiencing some turbulence

[Outro]
Are we really going light speed
Are we really going light speed
Are we really going light speed
