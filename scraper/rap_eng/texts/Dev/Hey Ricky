Kreayshawn, Dev, Alisa
And my girls NERVO

[Hook: All]
Ricky, you're a star fucker
Dumb tucker, love sucker
Ricky, you're a star fucker
And you blowin' it

[Verse 1: Dev]
You have everyone thinking that you wanna be their friend
When all you wanna do is, all you wanna do is
Fuck your way up to the top
Who knows where you have been
I don't know how you do it, don't know how you do it

[Hook: All]
Ricky, you're a star fucker
Dumb tucker, love sucker

Hey, and you blowin' it
Hey, and you blowin' it

[Verse 2: Dev]
I hope you're realizing what goes up will then come down
You know what's coming around, you know what's coming 'round
You're gonna lose the one thing everybody wish they had found
Don't you come crying to me now, don't you come crying now

[Verse 3: Kreayshawn]
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, such an innocent flirt
Scumbag bros gettin' lower than dirt
Hollywood know-it-alls, skinny moaning boner bras
She smell worse than your girlfriend's underdrawers
Fuckin' all the groupie hoes just to be in videos
I can't believe I fall for the individuals
Oh what? You thought I was done? Hey!
Get a little fame, now you wanna have some fun?
Go ahead and fuck with those sweet chicks
And see what kind of spots pop up, up on your dick (Ew!)
Ricky, Ricky, I thought I knew you better
Ricky, Ricky, I thought I blew you better

[Hook: All]
Ricky, you're a star fucker
Dumb tucker, love sucker
Ricky, you're a star fucker
And you know it
Ricky, you're a star fucker
Dumb tucker, love sucker
Ricky, you're a star fucker
And you blowin' it

Hey

[Verse 3: Alisa]
(Here we go!)
Hey, Ricky, Ricky, sticky
You think you're number one
But you ain't nothing, baby
Get your panties on the run
My girls are wicked, we can keep it up with anyone
Don't need your lame ass with us
Get the fuck out, we done

[Outro: All]
You blowin' it, you blowin' it
You blowin' it, you blowin' it (Hey, Ricky)
You blowin' it, you blowin' it
You blowin' it, you blowin' it
You're a star fucker
You blowin' it, you blowin' it

A star fucker
