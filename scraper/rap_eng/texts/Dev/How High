Hook (Ivy Sole):
Left the windows open
Letting all the smoke get outside
Tell me that you’re floating
But how high?
Tell me that you’re hoping
That you can take these wings for a ride
Now’s the time to show me
How high?

Verse 1 (Ivy Sole):
I’ve been looking for a smile that I can cling to
You’ve been looking for a sky to spread your wings to
So show me what they’re made of
Are they feathers or wax?
Will we see the sun or end up flat on our backs?
Gazing up at stormy eyes or cloudy hair or sunny cheeks
Are you every bit of heaven I seek?
Is this height how you like it? Are you close to your peak?
Is this twice striking lightning and thunder shaking our knees?
You tell me to breathe
But the air is thin between us
This altitude is usually too far from out our reaches
This breeze is stealing heat and all this smoky sweetness
But it’s you that leaves me smoldering and speechless

Hook (Ivy Sole):
Left the windows open
Letting all the smoke get outside
Tell me that you’re floating
But how high?
Tell me that you’re hoping
That you can take these wings for a ride
So now’s the time to show me
How high?


Verse 2 (Dev*):
How high
Where eyes don't reach
Swan dive
On Zion's Beach
While
We whisper prayers
That whip through air
Like missiles
Aimed at angels
That whistle credos
Hallelujah
To you and that God you praise
And the ones you don't
Cause the God you love
Ain't the one that that rolled these J's
That was me
So when we crash land
Finding comfort
In ashed hands
And you ask how high
I'll reply in a line
Like confiding in blue bird's
Hashtags
Way way way up
You don't have to say say say much
Let Womack lift you
And when the silence reminds of the sky
I promise to go back with you

Hook (Ivy Sole & Dev):
Left the windows open
Letting all the smoke get outside
Tell me that you’re floating
But how high?
Tell me that you’re hoping
That you can take these wings for a ride
So now’s the time to show me
How high?
