Me and my boys rolling
Steady down the strip
We got money on our minds
With our hands on the clip

Henny in the cups
Got the speakers on loud
It's a nice day out
Roll the windows down (and say)

Hey, it's just another day
And, hey, it's just another day
And we got it laid
Just another day
Another day gettin' down

Such a good life to it
On a small town tip
Kickin' back all day
And on that we get ripped

We love what we do
Another day, another dollar
And another chance to party
Is another chance to holler

We do that easy living
We get whatever we need
We do whatever we want
When-whenever we please

Such a good life to live
On a small town tip
Kickin' back all day
And all night we get ripped

And this is how it goes
Dippin' on you hoes
Your back, turn it up
Get a swisher and blow

And It's just another day
And it's just another day
We are gettin' paid
Just another day
Another day gettin' down

And It's just another day
And it's just another day
Riding by like aye
Just another day
Another day gettin' down

We all hit at my spot
Once the part is done
Finish up the bottles
And put away the gun

We eat all of my food
And watch us on TV
And if you aren't sleeping here
Then you all better leave

Yeah, I'm off to bed
I gotta get some sleep
Cause we all know tomorrow
We will be doing the same thing

If you staying up all night
Say yeah
If you staying up all night
Say yeah

Put your hands in the air
If you're a true player
Do what you want
Just don't fuck up my hair

If you staying up all night
Say yeah
If you staying up all night
Say yeah

Put your hands in the air
If you're a true player
Do what you want
And just chill

And It's just another day
And it's just another day
We are gettin' paid
Just another day
Another day gettin' down

And It's just another day
And it's just another day
Riding by like aye
Just another day
Another day gettin' down

Gettin' down
Gettin' down
