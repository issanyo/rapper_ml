Do it tonight, forever
Do it tonight, together

[Cyrano]
It's Friday night, and I've been working all week
So I call my crew, and they were headed to the beach
Watchu wanna do, I'm tryna get my new shorty tonight
Johnny said, come through
We better get up on some hunnies tonight (some hunnies tonight)

A tonight x5

[Chorus(Dev)]
Do it tonight, do it forever
Do it for me, do it for us

Do it tonight, do it together
Do it for peace, do it for love

[Campa]
I'm sittin' on an all night flight
Dippin' with the freak
Slapping old school hood
Baby please please please

Watchu wanna do, I got a pocket full of money tonight
Johnny said, come through
Cus we bout to go dommy tonight (dommy tonight)

A tonight x5

[Chorus(Dev)]
Do it tonight, do it forever
Do it for me, do it for us

Do it tonight, do it together
Do it for peace, do it for love

[Dev]
Do it right, get down, I'm your fun now
Wanna be hard, put your gun down
Silly boy come back and rewind now
Money pocket [?] come from behind now

Yep yep, up and down like see-saw
Me and you stay tight like a leotard
And it's all, gone like all night
Hands up so going to the sunlight

Hold up, hold up
Do these jeans make my ass look fat
Okay

Do it tonight, forever
Do it tonight, together

[Chorus(Dev)]
Do it tonight, do it forever
Do it for me, do it for us

Do it tonight, do it together
Do it for peace, do it for love
