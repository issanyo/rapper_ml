[Verse 1]
The sky is purple, I'm running on turbo
I got 20 fake bitches that I draw in a circle and stay away from
I'm gonna get my makeup in a rich sense, not the pig sense
My flow exotic, incense, intense
I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hear me on the radio
All they do is replay
I used to turn it off but now I turn it up
I turn it up, I turn it up
They call me Dev

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it, turn it, turn it up

[Chorus]
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young

[Verse 2]
I see you chewing on your upper lip
Brain fried, come and take a ride on the mothership
Do you know who you fucking with?
Be the Dean's list, queen bitch
Leave your king speechless
Spitting your weakness and it ain't the same
Wanna piece of my peach? Press, press play
So here we go, spending winters on the beaches
By the way, we don't even want to sleep in

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it, turn it, turn it up

[Chorus]
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it, turn it, turn it up

[Chorus]
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
