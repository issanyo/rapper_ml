[Intro: Dev]
I want to get you by yourself, yeah, have you to myself
I don't need nobody else, don't want nobody else
He's special, I know
His smile, it glows
He's perfect, it shows
Let's go

[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
I've been staring at you
And I could do it all night
You're looking like an angel with that kind of body
Needs a spotlight

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Ain't nobody know your name
But looking like you do, could be famous
I could see us making waves
From the back of the club, to a bed in the shade, now

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I don't know who you are, but you look like a star
And everybody here be thinking
Who's that boy?
Want to take you home and get you all alone
And everybody here is thinking
Who's that boy?

[Post-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen no one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy?
Who's that boy?

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
You could say that I'm distracted
At how you got me so attracted
But boy, I tell you what the fact is
Is no one else in this room that could rock it like you, you do

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Ain't nobody know your name
But looking like you do, could be famous
I could see us making waves
From the back of the club, to a bed in the shade, now

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I don't know who you are, but you look like a star
And everybody here be thinking
Who's that boy?
Want to take you home and get you all alone
And everybody here is thinking
Who's that boy?

[Post-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen no one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy?
Who's that boy?

[Bridge: Demi Lovato]
Everybody in the club turn around saying
Who's that?
Who's that?
Beautiful boy with them big brown eyes
Tell me, who's that?
Who's that?

[Verse 3: Dev]
I got my eye on this boy
Can't get him off my mind
He's one of a kind
The cherry to my pie
I just want to get him close
Want to make him mine
Come hold my hand and dance away the night
Give me the green light, kiss my lips
Who's that boy watching my hips?
I-I-I want to know who you are
My name is Dev and you can be my star

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I don't know who you are, but you look like a star
And everybody here be thinking
Who's that boy?
Want to take you home and get you all alone
And everybody here is thinking
Who's that boy?

[Post-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen no one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy?
Who's that boy?
