[Verse 1]
Live fast die young, go all-in
Record labels in my phone stay calling
First they couldn't figure me out
Funny how they all want a piece of me now and
Who's hot, tell me who's really balling
Whats the number on the phone they dialing
Never would've pictured me now
Bet you wanna take a pic with me now

[Chorus]
And ooh, who ever would have known
Tell me who you're looking at when you're all alone
And ooh, who ever would have known
Tell me who you're looking at when you're all alone
Is it me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
I used to live in a little ass town
Now I sell out shows, bouncing up and down
Flying all around, doing my thing and
Don't be mad cause they calling my name
Stunting on these hoes, brand new frames
Brand new rides with the candy paint
Damn who knew I could shine so bright
I want to feel this way every day of my life

[Chorus]
And ooh, who ever would have known
Tell me who you're looking at when you're all alone
And ooh, who ever would have known
Tell me who you're looking at when you're all alone
Is it me, me, me, me
Is it me?

[Break]
What you looking at?
What you, what you look, what you looking at? Me?
Looking, looking, looking at me?
What you looking at?
What you, what you looking at?
What ever you're looking for, you ain't gotta look past me
Oh, you like that? Oh, you, oh, you like that?
Looking at me, looking, looking at me?
What you, what you look, what you looking at?
Looking, at me, looking, looking at me?
Oh, you like that? Oh, you, oh, you like that?
Oh, you like that? Oh, you, oh, you like that?

[Outro]
Where you at?
On to the next thing, on to the next thing
Where you at?
On to the next thing, on to the next thing
On to the next thing
