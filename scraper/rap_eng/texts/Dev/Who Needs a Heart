[Verse 1]
Tell me what good are you if all you ever do is hate?
I wonder if you’ll ever work out for me, out for me
You ain’t nothing but trouble
You’ll fall for almost anything
And guess who’s left to take the hit?

[Chorus]
So who needs a heart anyway?
We always break, what a shame
So who needs a heart anyway?
We always break, what a shame

[Verse 2]
You force me to give chances, knowing that he’ll never change
Still you’ll rather play the game
You must like to be broken, ‘cause when you ever gonna learn?
That always was a stupid word

[Chorus]
So who needs a heart anyway?
We always break, what a shame
So who needs a heart anyway?
We always break, what a shame
