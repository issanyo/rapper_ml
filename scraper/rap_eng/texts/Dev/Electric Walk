[Verse 1: DEV]
Licking your lips you want all of this
I tell em take a number cause I ain't that bitch
Pretty snow bunnies in my ride rollin up a splif
And i got hunnies on my line who be hidding clips
Money stacks in the back of the Maybach
Gotta re up, callem play back
Get smack, losing track of the daylight
Hands on deck, even when we play fight
In the middle of the night I’m gone
Going off while you try and turn me on

[Hook]
Show me your electric walk

[Verse 2: DEV]
Alleyways light up like a runway
We on one, even on a sunday
On the way to the bay hit a double play
Always getting into trouble tryna runaway
D.E.V. gottem sippin till they hic up
Slidding through whichya girl tryna cuddle up
Fuckin up messing up her make up

[Hook]
Show me your electric walk

[Bridge: DEV]
I’ll show you how i move
I’ll show you how i go
I’ll show what it do
I gave you more more more

[Hook]
Show me your electric walk
