[Hook]
Fireball, I'm atomic all day now
Talking bout game, got bars like a playground
Hey now, I hope you're ready for the take down
Tell Cyranizzy to hit me with the break down

[Bridge: Cyrano & Dev]
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere
Ay, she a fireball, ay, she a fireball
I'm a fireball, bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm a fireball, baby, I get money
What's funny? Dollar bills in my tummy
I'mma keep it moving, moving, stay runnin'
Boppers keep on hopping, playboy bunnin'

[Pre-Hook]
Keep the money coming, keep the money coming, coming
Keep the money coming, keep the money coming, coming
Now I got the world humming, I got the world humming, humming
What you looking at, trick?

[Hook]
Fireball, I'm atomic all day now
Talking bout game, got bars like a playground
Hey now, I hope you're ready for the take down
Tell Cyranizzy to hit me with the break down

[Bridge: Cyrano & Dev]
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere
Ay, she a fireball, ay, she a fireball
I'm a fireball, bitch

[Verse 2]
Now I'm ridin', baby, it's a late night
Got purp on deck in a straight light
I create hype while you sit tight
Don't think twice, when I spit, I always hit it right

[Pre-Hook]
Keep the money coming, keep the money coming, coming
Keep the money coming, keep the money coming, coming
Now I got the world humming, I got the world humming, humming
What you looking at, trick?

[Hook]
Fireball, I'm atomic all day now
Talking bout game, got bars like a playground
Hey now, I hope you're ready for the take down
Tell Cyranizzy to hit me with the break down

[Bridge: Cyrano & Dev]
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere
Ay, she a fireball, ay, she a fireball
I'm a fireball, bitch

[Verse 3]
I, I just want to have it all
Seeing everything I dream of
Watch me rising like a phoenix
And I, I'm never gonna fall
Cause I'm hotter than the rest of them
And I think I got, the best of them
I'm a fireball, baby, I'm a fireball, baby
And I'm driving you crazy 'cause I'm that lady

[Bridge 2: Cyrano & Dev]
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere
Ay, she a fireball, ay, she a fireball
I'm a fireball, bitch
You got me running over here, running over there
Baby tell me, can I holla? I been running everywhere
Ay, she a fireball, ay, she a fireball
I'm a fireball, bitch

[Outro: Cyrano & Dev]
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere
Ay, ay ay, a-ay, ay ay
You got me running over here, running over there
Baby tell me, can I holla? I been running everywhere
Ay, ay ay, a-ay, ay ay
I'm a fireball, bitch
