[Verse 1]
Sitting up here in my own stratosphere
Don't see it rainin', not one single tear; for you
Swallow the sun, now I'm bleeding out gold
Think I'ma ride on the side for a year or two

[Pre-Chorus]
Who do you think you're talking to?
Too good for you

[Chorus]
I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry
Cry if you want to, it's your party
You got a problem, it's not my problem
I am above all of this, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on my, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit
I'm on my, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit

[Verse 2]
Way up, way up, I can't hear what you saying
I don't have the time, I got no Cartier for you
Gems on my neck like I'm bleeding out gold
Pardon my, pardon my French, s'il vous pla√Æt, fuck you

[Pre-Chorus]
Who do you think you're talking to?
Too good for you

[Chorus]
I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry
Cry if you want to, it's your party
You got a problem, it's not my problem
I am above all of this, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on my, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit
I'm on my, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit

[Bridge]
Looking down on you looking up, looking up to me
Looking down on you looking up, looking up to me
Looking down on you looking up, looking up to me
Looking down on you looking up, looking up to me

[Chorus]
I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry
Cry if you want to, it's your party
You got a problem, it's not my problem
I am above all of this, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on my, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit
I'm on my, I'm on my Cloud 9 shit
