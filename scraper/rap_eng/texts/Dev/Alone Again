[Chorus]
Waking up in a cold sweat
I'm wondering if you're gone yet
Will I watch the sunset alone, alone again?
Reminiscing 'bout the past year
I'm wondering how we got here
Moving on without you alone, alone again
Alone, alone again

[Verse 1]
Trying hard just to forget, but maybe I'm over my head
Did you mean those things you said
When you were packing up your shit?
If I could just move on, maybe I could stop

[Chorus]
Waking up in a cold sweat
I'm wondering if you're gone yet
Will I watch the sunset alone, alone again?
Reminiscing 'bout the past year
I'm wondering how we got here
Moving on without you alone, alone again
Alone, alone again, alone, alone again, yeah

[Verse 2]
And when you hear our record spin
I hope you think of me again
If I could just move on, maybe I could stop

[Chorus]
Waking up in a cold sweat
I'm wondering if you're gone yet
Will I watch the sunset alone, alone again?
Reminiscing 'bout the past year
I'm wondering how we got here
Moving on without you alone, alone again

[Outro]
Alone, alone again, alone, alone again
Alone, alone again, alone, alone again
Alone, alone again, alone, alone again
Alone, alone again, alone, alone again
Alone, alone again
