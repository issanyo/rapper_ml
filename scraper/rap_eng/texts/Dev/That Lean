[Verse 1: Carnage]
This game lookin so mean (so mean)
Purple smell like that lean (that lean)
Bad bitches flockin
Leather's not rockin

Chilling with the captain, chilling with the goose
Getting bitches drunk, getting bitches loose
Shows up as a rich bitch living as a gore whore
All the bitches love me cuz I'm mother fucking BORGORE!

Purple smell like that lean
