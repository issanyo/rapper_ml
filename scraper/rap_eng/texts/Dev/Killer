I'll wait, for you
Time might take, to see it through
Now I got you, at the barrel of my gun
Gonna keep you, gonna freak you, until I have my fun

[Chorus]
Boy, you can't run, you can't hide from me
I'm a killer
You can't run, once I like what I see
I'm a killer (k-k-k-k-killing for fun)
Oh! Nothing like when you touch me
Oh! I'm gonna make you love me
U-o-oh, u-o-oh, oh!
I'm a killer (killing for fun)
Fire up shades, of blue
Whenever I'm away, from you
Now I got you, at the barrel of my gun (my gun)
Gonna keep you, gonna freak you, until I have my fun

[Chorus]
Boy, you can't run, you can't hide from me
I'm a killer
You can't run, once I like what I see
I'm a killer (k-k-k-k-killing for fun)
Oh! Nothing like when you touch me
Oh! I'm gonna make you love me
U-o-oh, u-o-oh, oh!
I'm a killer (killing for fun)
Well they say you can't have, everything you want
All of the time (all of the time)
But I won't sleep and I won't stop
Until you're mine (mine, mine, mine..)
Until you're mine (mine, mine..)
Because!
Oh! Nothing like when you touch me
Oh! I'm gonna make you love me
U-o-oh, u-o-oh, oh!
I'm a killer (killing for fun)
Boy, you can't run, you can't hide from me
I'm a killer (k-k-k-k-killing for fun)
You can't run, once I like what I see
I'm a killer (k-k-k-k-killing for fun)
Oh! Nothing like when you touch me
Oh! I'm gonna make you love me
U-o-oh, u-o-oh, oh!
I'm a killer (killing for fun)
