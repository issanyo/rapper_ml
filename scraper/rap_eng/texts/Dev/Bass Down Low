If you wanna get with me there's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Bass bass bass down low
Bass bass bass down low

It was a late night (late night) gettin' ripped
Saw this chick looking kinda thick
Red bone, yellow bone
How can I get you up in my home?
Turn off your phone, take off your clothes
No drink - just smoke
Mother fuck with me
Get down and roll it up with me
'Cuz I got a sound system and I like it really loud
And I'm only gunna slap it if we make each other shout

Drop it to the floor x4
Bass x11

Look hold up got me on you like a magnet
What you talkin' bout I don't give it up that quick
(Huh) like we heard that shit
She freak under the cover like a mattress
What a coincidence that is I'm trying to get you in after this
Back to my house
Like the Black Eyed Peas give her Boom Boom Pow
She like to get loud, any mess can't turn her down
Worst night out, I'mma turn her out
Like MJ's perm she's burnin OW!
