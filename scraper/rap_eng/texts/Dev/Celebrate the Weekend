[Pre-Chorus]
Our dreams are feeling heavy
We have no time to wait
Hurry, we're getting ready
It's already late
Our dreams are feeling heavy
We have no time to wait
Hurry, we're getting ready
It's already late

[Chorus]
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate the weekend
Me and my best friend
Call us on our phones, no one's home
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate the weekend
Me and my best friend
Call us on our phones, no one's home

[Verse 1]
I just clocked out
It's our time now
Gonna spend the whole check on the west with my best friends
We gonna get it
We gonna finish first place everyday like it's our birthday

[Pre-Chorus]
Our dreams are feeling heavy
We have no time to wait
Hurry, we're getting ready
It's already late
Our dreams are feeling heavy
We have no time to wait
Hurry, we're getting ready
It's already late

[Chorus]
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate the weekend
Me and my best friend
Call us on our phones, no one's home
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate the weekend
Me and my best friend
Call us on our phones, no one's home

[Verse 2]
Keep on the lookout
Got some money stashed in my pocket
She hopping in the car now
Let's run away, be my sweet escape
We gonna get it
We gonna finish first place everyday like it's our birthday

[Pre-Chorus]
Our dreams are feeling heavy
We have no time to wait
Hurry, we're getting ready
It's already late
Our dreams are feeling heavy
We have no time to wait
Hurry, we're getting ready
It's already late

[Chorus]
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate the weekend
Me and my best friend
Call us on our phones, no one's home
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate the weekend
Celebrate the weekend
Me and my best friend
Call us on our phones, no one's home
