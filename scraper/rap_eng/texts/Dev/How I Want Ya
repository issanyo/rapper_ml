[Verse 1]
Never believed in love, didn't need anyone
Baby, until I met you
Tried to play hard to get, but you were all over it
Didn't know what to do, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't been the same since the second you came
To say hello, say hello, say hello
I get weak in the knees when you're looking at me
Now I know, now I know, now I know
(You're gonna make me sing)

[Chorus]
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling

[Verse 2]
Started off kinda slow, then you said please don't go
And ever since, I've been right here
Now that we're more than friends, I don't want it to end
Baby, you've got me good, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't been the same since the second you came
To say hello, say hello, say hello
I get weak in the knees when you're looking at me
Now I know, now I know, now I know
(You're gonna make me sing)

[Chorus]
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling

[Bridge]
Ooh, how I love to love to love ya
Ooh, how I love to love to love ya
Ooh, how I love to love to love ya
Love to love ya, love to love ya
Ooh, how I love to love to love ya
Ooh, how I love to love to love ya
Ooh, how I love to love to love ya
Love to love ya, love to love ya

[Chorus]
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
