[Verse 1]
Say you're walking away, say you're walking away
Feelin' my face change
Feelin' my space get smaller by the second
Why'd you leave in the night?
Why'd you leave in the night?
Tried to catch the first flight
I love these tears, just show my reflection

[Pre-Chorus]
I fuck with you so tough
Consider you my first love
This ain't something I can turn off
Boy, you're all I ever think of

[Chorus]
Let's star over (start over)
Let's say hello
When we're together (we're together)
Baby we go
Go, we go
Here we go
Baby, we go

[Verse 2]
Almost lost you once
That was more than enough
I realize you were meant to hold my hand
Now I'll never let you leave
This ain't make believe
We got too much to lose and understand

[Pre-Chorus]
I fuck with you so tough
Consider you my first love
This ain't something I can turn off
Boy, you're all I ever think of

[Chorus]
Let's star over (start over)
Let's say hello
When we're together (we're together)
Baby we go
Go, we go
Here we go
Baby, we go

[Pre-Chorus]
I fuck with you so tough
Consider you my first love
This ain't something I can turn off
Boy, you're all I ever think of

[Chorus]
Let's star over (start over)
Let's say hello
When we're together (we're together)
Baby we go
Go, we go
Here we go
Baby, we go
