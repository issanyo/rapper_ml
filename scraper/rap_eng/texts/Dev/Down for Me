[Intro]
This must be Saint
It sounds beautiful

[Verse 1]
When I speak, you listen
Show you what you're missing
My way, every minute, minute, minute (minute)

[Pre-Chorus]
Finally get it
You finally, finally get it, don't you?
When you get it, you like the way I did it, don't you?
Come in closer, when you know it, better own it, babe
All in your feels, you know It's really, really, really, babe

Tell me what you're thinking
Late night, spend it dreaming
Have my way all weekend, weekend

[Chorus]
All I wanna know is if you're down for me
All I wanna know is can you handle me?
Do what I say, wait around for me
Ain't no other bitch can wear a crown like me

All I wanna know is if you're down for me
All I wanna know is can you handle me?
Do what I say, wait around for me
Ain't no other bitch can wear a crown like me

[Verse 2]
Follow my lead, gravitate to me
I'm who they wanna be, they play catch up to me
Don't play games, don't compete
I'm the only thing that you need
We can stay shallow but get deep
[?] around to see

[Pre-Chorus]
Finally get it
You finally, finally get it, don't you?
When you get it, you like the way I did it, don't you?
Come in closer, when you know it, better own it, babe
All in your feels, you know It's really, really, really, babe

Tell me what you're thinking
Late night, spend it dreaming
Have my way all weekend, weekend

[Chorus]
All I wanna know is if you're down for me
All I wanna know is can you handle me?
Do what I say, wait around for me
Ain't no other bitch can wear a crown like me

All I wanna know is if you're down for me
All I wanna know is can you handle me?
Do what I say, wait around for me
Ain't no other bitch can wear a crown like me
