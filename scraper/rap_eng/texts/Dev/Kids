[Verse 1]
You try to talk, but I'm already gone
You want a sip, the drink's already done
My phone is off, I'm already on
All I want to do is dance
I keep moving, moving, these bitches are see-through
I think I've been steering and they're in the rear view
I'm in my car going back to the bay
Bad girls in a bad world, let me hear you say

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get down tonight
I'm on that shit that I know you like
Don't judge me cause I'm about this life
Yeah, the kid's gonna be alright
All I wanna do is get down tonight
I'm on that shit that I know you like
Don't judge me cause I'm about this life
Yeah, the kid's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we always did it our way
Wanna celebrate and misbehave
Fuck around downtown and act like nothing
Wait around for everyone to say they love us
To kiss us and hug us, and come undone
The day is dead, the night is young
I get in my car and go back to the teek
Bad girls and the bad boy, let me hear you scream

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get down tonight
I'm on that shit that I know you like
Don't judge me cause I'm about this life
Yeah, the kid's gonna be alright
All I wanna do is get down tonight
I'm on that shit that I know you like
Don't judge me cause I'm about this life
Yeah, the kid's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
Betcha, betcha wanna do it like this, this, this
You like it, like it when I do it like this, this, this
All I wanna do is
All I, all I wanna do is get down, get down, g-get down tonight
Get down, get down tonight
(All I wanna do, all I wanna do)
Get down, get down tonight

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get down tonight
I'm on that shit that I know you like
Don't judge me cause I'm about this life
Yeah, the kid's gonna be alright
All I wanna do is get down tonight
I'm on that shit that I know you like
Don't judge me cause I'm about this life
Yeah, the kid's gonna be alright

Betcha wanna do it like this, this, this
You like it when I do it like this, this, this
All I wanna do is (this)
All I wanna do is (this)
All I wanna do is (this)
All I wanna do is (this)
