[Verse 1: Dev*]:

I woke up amongst the leaves and made my way outside of Eden
As the wind forewarned of evening, even light takes time to sleep
As the sun began to flicker, I asked Father
Why he formed them in his figure from the dust beneath my feet and
Heaven opened up as if to answer
But this atmosphere's too thick for me to capture explanations that he speaks
Like why have you forsaken your creation, clipped my wings and leave me naked
Like these small impatient beasts that you call man, but you named me son
Meanwhile, you give them choice but you gave me none
So I take it and run, to the nearest clearing where the shade comes from a tree
She sings to you but see, she's calling to me
She feels my fire were human, I tell her take this and eat
Yeah you seem weary, but really, if it is peace that you seek, then you don't need me
I'm cursed and forever rotten in a bottomless pit
But you're part of me, although you're part of his rib

[Chorus x2]
If you give it time, you'll know
Everything that shines ain't gold
But heaven's in your mind & soul
But that's fine with me

[Verse 2: Ivy Sole]
They didn't mean to set me free, but the chains got sick of rusting, restless rungs and heaving lungs, my chest a walking drum the beat
Of sun on skin and dandelion, I left the shackles in my mind behind, the forest floor beneath my feet
The clearing up ahead, must be as good as up above, this heaven hollowed like my heart, my inner tree
I run like all creation, hear the cadence of my muscles stretch and ache and call for refuge, I've been sleep
Next to man or next to beast, next to god or next to master, all these creatures blessed with faster ways to flee
A stranger in the shadows, could be friend or could be furnace, burning softly with exactly what I need
Anything but Adam, every atom of my being set adrift with the persistence of a dream
A compass pointing anywhere but paradise, a serpentine sonata willing to take the lead

[Chorus]

[Ivy Sole and Dev*]
I didn't ask for this, I'm soiled at the thought of growing old without my basilisk
Our love is spoiled by asterisks and rotten apple remnants
In a garden where man fell only to rise again like Lazareth
This atlas we made from borrowed bones and kingdoms overthrown
I shed my skin and hope with you I make a home
But home is heaven,. not this dirt we die on
This humble earth we lie on, this bare and battered skin we try on
That's what I'm made of, playing clavicle a radical invention
Of whom I'm supposed to be afraid of
What are you afraid of? God is what you're made of
His hands are an extension of his brace that made to make love
So lets make love, so lets make love
So lets make love, lets make love
