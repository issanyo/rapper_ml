[Chorus]
Don't say that word (word) unless you mean it (unless you mean it)
Some things die and it don’t come back (back)
Don't say that word (word) if you don't believe it (don’t believe it)
There's no time for that (for that)
I'll be gone (be gone)
I'll be gone (be gone)

[Verse 1]
I don't know why you'd ever say you love me
If you've never been around long enough
I cook us dinner and eat all by myself
Now yeah, it's so sad, it’s been real tough
Well fuck you, then you say all these sweet things
But never do you ever show me in person
By the time you’ve realized what you lost (lost)
I'll be gone (gone), yeah, I’ll be the one you'll be searching for

[Pre-Chorus]
Courtesy smiles
Losing meaning, have no meaning (have no meaning)
Make it worth your while (worth your while)
Lose all feeling (lose all feeling), there's no feeling

[Chorus]
Don't say that word (word) unless you mean it (unless you mean it)
Some things die and it don’t come back (back)
Don't say that word (word) if you don't believe it (don't believe it)
There's no time for that (for that)
I'll be gone (be gone)
I'll be gone (be gone)

[Verse 2]
I remember the first time you told me you loved me
And we had the best night of our lives (night of our lives)
Laying side by side for hours after playing around
Until late in the night (late in the night)
And I believed how you said, you were so good in bed
But now I know so much better (now I know so much better)
So I moved on, the lining in your palm is drawn (drawn)
And I'll be the one you'll be searching for (for)

[Pre-Chorus]
Courtesy smiles
Losing meaning, have no meaning (have no meaning)
Make it worth your while (worth your while)
Lose all feeling (lose all feeling), there's no feeling

[Chorus]
Don't say that word (word) unless you mean it (unless you mean it)
Some things die and it don't come back (back)
Don't say that word (word) if you don't believe it (don't believe it)
There's no time for that (for that)
I'll be gone (be gone)
I'll be gone (be gone)
Don't say that word  unless you mean it
Some things die and it don't come back
Don't say that word if you don't believe it
There's no time for that (for that, for that, for that)
I'll be gone (be gone)
I'll be gone (be gone)
I'll be gone
