[Chorus:]
I don't miss you
I don't want you
The sky's not blue
I haven't been thinking of you
And girl's don't lie

[Verse 1:]
Reason I took two hours to reply
It's 'cause I've just been busy
Not 'cause I know that is what I have to do
Keep you interested in me
Haven't told my friends about last night
And how your eyes did nothin' to me
And how you kissed me on that hotel balcony
Over the city

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't wanna mess it up
I don't wanna call it love
I don't wanna feel for you
I don't wanna tell the truth

[Chorus:]
No, I don't miss you
I don't want you
The sky's not blue
I haven't been thinking of you
And girl's don't lie
Girls don't ...
No, I don't miss you
I don't want you
The sky's not blue
I haven't been thinking of you
And girl's don't lie
Girls don't ...

[Verse 2:]
I'm cool with keepin' it all casual
I won't fall in the deep end
I'm not wearin' your t-shirt
In bed all alone with all my feelings
This isn't hard for me, I got no scars
And my heart was never broken
And I'm not terrified
I don't get butterflies seeing you calling

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't wanna mess it up
I don't wanna call it love
I don't wanna feel for you
I don't wanna tell the truth

[Chorus:]
No, I don't miss you
I don't want you
The sky's not blue
I haven't been thinking of you
And girl's don't lie
Girls don't ...
No, I don't miss you
I don't want you
The sky's not blue
I haven't been thinking of you
And girl's don't lie
Girls don't ...

[Outro:]
Girls don't lie, girls, girls don't lie
Girls don't lie, girls, girls don't lie
Girls don't lie, girls, girls don't lie
