[Verse 1 (Hadji Gaviota & Dev*)]
(I know we shouldn't fly so high)
In hindsight, what's a kite without the wind, so
(We don't have to last forever)
Forever ever? Like the head is severed? Doc's mask off, no future, he said that we did all we could do but
(I know we shouldn't fly so high)
What good is should to me know? The drop's 200 feet down
(We don't have to last forever)
If I'm this high, than what's a little further? Hit the bourbon
Hope no troopers hide in clouds, I'm in my angel wings swerving
Shit I'm Icarus Icarus, sickest shit is that I witnessed it
Homie moved close to the sun, burnt up
Thought he in Miami just turnt up
I ain't check in I was busy with her, just mincing my words
We was the golden children, holy gifted, oh the places we could go
And so it goes, I'm lonely and the road feel like the solar system
It hurts me knowing that you ain't here to witness
I had the same bit of sickness and Philly told me trust the process
Up from under, Ben Simmons, remember what that jawn said

[Hook: Hadji Gaviota & Dev*]
What is the point of
Falling in love
When you ain't got all the answers, no Sway
I'll sway in the wind with
All of the birds
And they don't know where they're nesting today
And it's okay to feel some
Pain, still
Remind you that you're still alive, still alive, oh
And there'll be someone at your bedside
With grayed hair, yeah
So just sit back enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride, oh

[Verse 2]
Stonehenge love, your light made pretty shadows out of pillars that was really filler when they don't have sun
Bowflex guns, you could say I was afraid of the weight that I had to push so I let both legs run
Quad ceps bum, from treadmilling dead feelings
If Vine's dead you couldn't tell from my head
But in the end the good guy won out like the right pretend would happen if they both had guns
And Hadji got his groove back, Gaviota flew the bird flu out
No mood last forever if they getting tattoos out
And now I'm plotting on a third inking, summers in Helsinki
Feet cooling off, not getting higher it's just Hell sinking
Me and myself collude like suits the NFL bringing
Suits me well, this confidence shit
And what we not finna do is slip back in bottomless pits
So I'mma sip a mimosa and toast to all that we get in this life like

[Hook: Hadji Gaviota & Dev*]
What is the point of
Falling in love
When you ain't got all the answers, no Sway
I'll sway in the wind with
All of the birds
And they don't know where they're nesting today
And it's okay to feel some
Pain, still
Remind you that you're still alive, still alive, oh
And there'll be someone at your bedside
With grayed hair, yeah
So just sit back enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride, oh

[Outro: Dev*]
What is the point of
Falling in love
When you ain't got all the answers, no Sway
I'll sway in the wind with
All of the birds
And they don't know where they're nesting today
And it's okay to feel some
Pain, still
Remind you that you're still alive, still alive, oh
And there'll be someone at your bedside
With grayed hair, yeah
So just sit back enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride, oh
