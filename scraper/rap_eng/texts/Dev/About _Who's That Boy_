[Demi Lovato talking about "Who's That Boy"]
"Who's That Boy" is personally probably one of my favorites of the album. I recorded it with Dev and it was actually written by Ryan Tedder, who is the lead singer of OneRepublic, and he is really cool guy. We had a really great time in the studio. Really funny! He's awesome, and I'm really excited to say that I've been able to work with such a talented writer and producer.
