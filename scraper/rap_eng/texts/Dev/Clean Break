[Intro]
(Hey
Clean break)
Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You should just take your things and go
You can leave your key on the counter
I heard it all a million times before
You don't need to say it any louder

[Pre-Chorus]
When it was good it was so good
We both know
I’m sick of pickin' up the pieces
That door is closed

[Chorus]
I need a clean break
No more your place, no more my place
No more drama, no more I'ma take it personal (hey!)
I need a clean break
I’m over me not ever fighting
Tryna find out why you're always so emotional (hey!)
I can't do this anymore
Letting you go, oh
I need a clean break
I need a clean slate
I need my own space
I need a clean break, clean break

Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah (Clean break, hey)
Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah (Clean break, hey)

[Verse 2]
Why do I do this to myself?
Wish I could forget you existed
3AM you call me up again
To tell me how much you missed it

[Pre-Chorus]
When it was good it was so good
We both know
I'm sick of pickin' up the pieces
That door is closed

[Chorus]
I need a clean break
No more your place, no more my place
No more drama, no more I'ma take it personal (hey!)
I need a clean break
I'm over me not ever fighting
Tryna find out why you're always so emotional (hey!)
I can’t do this anymore
Letting you go, oh
I need a clean break
I need a clean slate
I need my own space
I need a clean break, clean break

Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah (Clean break, hey!)
Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah (Clean break, hey!)

(Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah
I need a clean break)
Hey!

[Chorus]
I need a clean break
No more your place, no more my place
No more drama, no more I’ma take it personal (hey!)
I need a clean break
I'm over me not ever fighting
Tryna find out why you’re always so emotional (hey!)
I can't do this anymore
Letting you go, oh
I need a clean break
I need a clean slate
I need my own space
I need a clean break, clean break

[Outro]
Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah (Clean break, hey!)
Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah (Clean break, hey!)
