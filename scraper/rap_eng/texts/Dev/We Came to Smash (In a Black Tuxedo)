You clap your hands, you're turning heads
Jumping ship, jumping on my bed
You snuck into my room, danced away the night
I turned off my light, I turned off my light
So watch me baby follow my lead
They can't stop us now, take what you need
You came to smash it all
What we got to lose
In a black tuxedo and shiny shoes

Chorus:
We came to smash smash
We came to smash
We came to smash smash
We came to smash
Smash, smash
We came to smash

In black tux
In black tux
We came to smash smash

We came to smash in black tux
We came to smash smash
In the black tuxedo

It's not too late, I swear it's not
Your friend's asleep, the sky is polka dot
Pack up your car in the parking lot
Let's take a ride to my vacation spot
The streets are full, fuck it we'll walk
Call my phone if you wanna talk
We got no bars it's dark in here
I only shine so I can disappear

[Chorus:]
In black tux
In black tux
We came to smash smash
We came to smash in black tux
We came to smash in the black tuxedo
