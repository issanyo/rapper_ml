[Intro: 50 Cent]
Make it hot, all I do is make it hot
50 Cent, I make it hot, Dev up in the spot
Need to turn it up a notch

[Chorus: Dev]
On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night, I pretend we are
Dance, dance, da-dance, dancing in the dark

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Break it down
Give it to me, I'm an addict, I got to have
I wanna see shit get [?]
You got me addicted, I'm trying to kick it
There's a after party after the party in the bedroom at my house
We can get to acting naughty, I'll explore your body
Music playing with the lights out
You wanna play? Let's play in the bedroom at my house
We can get to acting naughty, I'll explore your body
Music playing with the lights out

[Chorus: Dev]
On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night, I pretend we are
Dancing in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark

[Verse 2: Dev]
Can you work on me?
Open my body up and do some surgery
Now that you got me up, I wanna taste it, taste it
And see those pocket aces
Wanna see who you are
Got a sex drive, it's push to start
Got a sex drive, it's push to start
Push, push, push, push to start
Push, push, push, push to start
I got a sex drive, it's push to start

[Chorus: Dev]
On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night, I pretend we are
Dancing in the dark

[Bridge: Dev & (50 Cent)]
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
(50 Cent, I'll make it hot, Dev up in the spot
You need to turn it up a notch)
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
(Turn it up, turn it up a notch
You need to turn it up a notch, turn it up a notch)
To let my hands do what they want
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
(Turn it up, turn it up a notch
You need to turn it up a notch)
Dancing in the dark

[Outro: Dev]
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark
