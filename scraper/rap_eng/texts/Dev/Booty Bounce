[Intro]
DJ, DJ, DJ

[Chorus]
DJ put that record on, that's my song, that's my shit
Poppin' Henny XO, all these hoes on my dick
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
B-bounce, bounce, booty bounce

[Verse 1]
They call me Dev, I ain't your average bitch
I'm in the club every weekend on some sav-ass shit
And-and I ain't too pretty to slap a ho
So all you girls acting shitty, better hit the back door

[Verse 2]
Where they at? (Where they at?)
I think I saw them in the back (In the back)
I think we're out numbered, fuck it (fuck it)
I got a baseball bat (I got a baseball bat)
Where the hell'd you get your man like that?
Put his number in my hand like that
Ripped it up like I didn't give a fuck
Didn't even give him a chance like that

[Chorus]
DJ put that record on, that's my song, that's my shit
Poppin' Henny XO, all these hoes on my dick
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
B-bounce, bounce, booty bounce

[Verse 3]
Ridin' in a saucy whip
Never give a fuck, it don't cost me shit
I'm a gangsta baby, just kidding
Oh no she didn't
You can't do it like me, uh uh, nah, you can't do it like me
(N-n-n-nah, you can't do it like me)
I bet you wish you could do it like me

[Verse 4]
Poppin' bottles in the ice like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Chorus]
DJ put that record on, that's my song, that's my shit
Poppin' Henny XO, all these hoes on my dick
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
B-bounce, bounce, booty bounce

[Bridge]
Poppin' bottles in the ice like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G, like a G6, like a G6
Now, n-now, n-now, now, now, now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6


[Chorus]
DJ put that record on, that's my song, that's my shit
Poppin' Henny XO, all these hoes on my dick
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
Bet you wanna see this booty bounce
B-bounce, bounce, booty bounce
