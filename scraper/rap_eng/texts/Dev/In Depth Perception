I've become
An error to the whom
A constant burden
The idealist
You never understand
And all I ever wanted was
You to lock me in your arms
So he couldn't lock his hands around my life
Is this tough love

We are the future
We are the past
And we are the present
So hear us out

Since I can remember
I was always one to blame
For the loss of his honor
He held my mothers name in vein
I will always remember
(but you can't remember
Cause you're just a boy
Placing blame upon himself)
Your misconception

We are the future
We are the past
And we are the present
So hear us out

We!
We are the past
The present
The future
So hear us out

Can you hear me now!
