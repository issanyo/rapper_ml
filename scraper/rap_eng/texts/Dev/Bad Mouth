[Verse 1]
I ain't nobody's side bitch, no no no
Got a boy who is my bitch, oh oh oh
I say what's on my mind, I don't fuck with being polite
On my first class shit, and I am the pilot

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I might talk a little trash, I, I might shake a little ass
I, I, I bite harder than you thought I could

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got a bad mouth
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good

[Verse 2]
I'm the captain of my ship, oh oh oh
You go down like Titanic, oh oh oh
I say what's on my brain, I might not remember your name
On my Cloud 9 shit, yeah, I am the flyest

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I might talk a little trash, I, I might shake a little ass
I, I, I bite harder than you thought I could

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got a bad mouth
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good
But it taste so good

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I might talk a little trash, I, I might shake a little ass
I, I, I bite harder than you thought I could

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got a bad mouth
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good, good, good, good, good, good
But it taste so good
