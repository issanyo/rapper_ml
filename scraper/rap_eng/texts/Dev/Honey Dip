[Intro]
Honey dip
Honey dip
Honey dip

[Verse 1]
You could be my honey dip, my honey dip
Watch me make my money flip, oh yeah
Baby, I can be your real girl, fuckin' around in this fake world, this fake world
And you could be my best friend, My best friend
Or you could be my enemy, keep me guessin'
You can be my kerosene, I light you up in the dark
Don't be scared baby, we can carry heat
You can be my idol, I can worship you
Like a tidal wave, I'm a warship
Baby if you listen up, I got you
You could be my swisher guts, yeah I got you
Baby you could be my raindrops in my ocean
Like I'm swimming with a speedin' star, feels good
If you close your mouth, admire it
Hold it in, let your mind bleed

[Chorus]
You could be my honey dip
Watch me make my honey flip, oh yeah
I could be your real girl in this fake world
Or you could be my best friend
Or you could be my enemy, keep me guessin'
I could be your real girl
Now you're fuckin' with a real girl

[Refrain]
Honey dip
Honey dip
Honey dip
Honey dip

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a windtalker, a binge drinker, little mama
I'm a long story with the end open
I'm sin committer, a roller coaster
Young go-getter, never lose hope
When people do one way, I can do four
When they do less, I can do more
Like love you a little bit longer
For sure, for sure

[Verse 2]
I can be your left overs, missed call
But then you'd be my side bitch, and that's weak
I want you for keeps
I need you like a christian needs Christ
Like my sweet and sour chicken needs rice
I got enough money in my life but I don't got a bitch to run it

[Chorus 2]
You could be my honey dip, honey dip
Watch me make my honey flip, oh yeah
I could be your real girl in this fake world
Or you could be my best friend
Or you could be my enemy, keep me guessin'
I can be your real girl
Now you fuckin with a real girl
I can be your real girl
I can be your real girl, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a windtalker, a binge drinker, little mama
I'm a long story with the end open
I'm sin committer, a roller coaster
Young go-getter, never lose hope
When people do one way, I can do four
When they do less, I can do more
Like love you a little bit longer
For sure, for sure

[Chorus 2]
You could be my honey dip, honey dip
Watch me make my honey flip, oh yeah
I could be your real girl in this fake world
Or you could be my best friend
Or you could be my enemy, keep me guessin'
I can be your real girl
Now you fuckin with a real girl
I can be your real girl
I can be your real girl, yeah

[Bridge]
I got so much to show you
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus 3]
And now I'm fucking with my honey dip, my honey dip, yeah
Make my money flip, oh yeah
Cuz I'm your real girl
And I'm living in your real world, your real world
Oh I'm your best friend, your best friend
Never your enemy, fuck your enemies
That's what I tell him
