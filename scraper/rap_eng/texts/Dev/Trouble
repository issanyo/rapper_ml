[Chorus: Dev]
Where is my ride? I've been waiting outside
If I don't leave in five, then it's gon' be some trouble
Little peace of mind is what I need in my life
If I don't leave tonight, then it's gon' be some trouble

[Post-Chorus: Marko Penn]
Hold up, wait, back up, bitch
You might live like [?]

[Verse 1: Dev]
Back up, bitch, whoa
Back up, bitch, can't take my light
Back up, bitch
Glamorous, glamorous, I'm that bitch
Even my diamonds are lit, you can't have my light
The shade can't dim my light
Double cup with no ice (hey)
Dippin' in the sauce all night, let me live my life
Back up, bitch (whoa)
The shade can't dim my light
I don't really care about a price
Spend my own money like twice
All I wanna do is ball, ballin' on your hoes like Mike

[Chorus: Dev]
Where is my ride? I've been waiting outside
If I don't leave in five, then it's gon' be some trouble
Little peace of mind is what I need in my life
If I don't leave tonight, then it's gon' be some trouble
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, then it's gon' be some trouble
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, oh, it's gon' be some trouble

[Post-Chorus: Marko Penn]
Hold up, wait, back up, bitch
You might live like [?]

[Verse 2: Dev]
Back up, bitch (whoa)
Back up, bitch, can't take my light
Back up, bitch
Get on my level, I'm on my shit
Even my baby look rich, you can't have my light
The shade can't dim my light
All of my nights is on pilot, they goin' up, bih
All of my nights is never silent, we stayin' up
Just give me the drink and I'll be fine, yeah, pour that shit up
Don't even think when I'm vibin', you know what's up

[Chorus: Dev]
Where is my ride? I've been waiting outside
If I don't leave in five, then it's gon' be some trouble
Little peace of mind is what I need in my life
If I don't leave tonight, then it's gon' be some trouble
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, then it's gon' be some trouble
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, oh, it's gon' be some trouble

[Verse 3: Marko Penn]
Hold up, wait, back up, bitch
You might live like [?]
Bitch like you're so fine [?]
All i need's my dollar sign[?]

[Chorus: Dev]
Where is my ride? I've been waiting outside
If I don't leave in five, then it's gon' be some trouble
Little peace of mind is what I need in my life
If I don't leave tonight, then it's gon' be some trouble
