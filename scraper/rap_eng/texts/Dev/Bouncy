[Chorus]
I got cash, all I need is a little more bounce
Just a little more bounce
She got ass, what she need is a little more bounce
Just a little more bounce
Keep it bouncy, keep it bouncy, yeah
I need a little more bounce
Keep it bouncy, keep it bouncy, yeah
I need a little more bounce

[Verse 1]
Down with the clique, I'm that bitch
My lifestyle lit, I ain't never gon' quit
Took another sip, my drinks don't mix
Took a photo, can't bomb that shit
Pourin' up the juice, throwing up the deuce
Ridin' 'round drunk, doin' what I wanna do
In a big room, yeah, we gettin' loose
Ball like KD every time you see me

[Chorus]
I got cash, all I need is a little more bounce
Just a little more bounce
She got ass, what she need is a little more bounce
Just a little more bounce
Keep it bouncy, keep it bouncy, yeah
I need a little more bounce
Keep it bouncy, keep it bouncy, yeah
I need a little more bounce

[Verse 2]
Drip, drip all over her hips
Lemonade, champagne all over her lips
More bottles and it's all on me
More models and they all on me
Tips, tips all over her hips
[?], Bombay, make a Hershey kiss
More problems when the money come in
More bounce when you got rich friends

[Chorus]
I got cash, all I need is a little more bounce
Just a little more bounce
She got ass, what she need is a little more bounce
Just a little more bounce
Keep it bouncy, keep it bouncy, yeah
I need a little more bounce
Keep it bouncy, keep it bouncy, yeah
I need a little more bounce
