[Chorus: Chrish]
Oh, I never should've dropped the gun down, baby
Oh, I never should've trusted you, I'm crazy
Have I been attacked? Took two shots to my heart
I'm like oh, oh, I never should've dropped the gun

[Post-Chorus]
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang
Bang bang, chicka, chicka, bang bang

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
I need liquor in my system, man, less emotion
Ten shots in my glass, baby, now I'm loaded
I'm looking for love, baby, with no devotion
Get your mind off my money, bitch, or get demoted
I thought love was the motive, I was wrong
Trust issues, bitch, I got a stone
I let it rain, let it rain, let it pour
Here's a few things that I think you should know
These girls ain't loyal, so I can't trust no bitch
These girls don't love you, so they can't come get shit
Can't get a whip, no she can't
Can't get a purse, no she can't
Can't get my heart, no she can't
Don't every try to shoot me down or I'mma bang bang
James

[Chorus: Chrish]
Oh, I never should've dropped the gun down, baby
Oh, I never should've trusted you, I'm crazy
Have I been attacked? Took two shots to my heart
I'm like oh, oh, I never should've dropped the gun

[Post-Chorus]
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang
Bang bang, chicka, chicka, bang bang

[Verse 2: Dev]
He cocked it first, dropped it back
I let him have it, heart attack
Kiss him then miss him, cardiac
Then put him in the back of the Cadillac
Tuck the gun for some fun
Turn it around, give me some
Whose gun's big now? Showed up, showdown
I made him my playmate, and this is my playground
Work, one round, two rounds
I wanna party, pour a Bacardi
Work, one round, two rounds
I wanna party, pour a Bacardi
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la

[Chorus: Chrish]
Oh, I never should've dropped the gun down, baby
Oh, I never should've trusted you, I'm crazy
Have I been attacked? Took two shots to my heart
I'm like oh, oh, I never should've dropped the gun

[Post-Chorus]
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang
Bang bang, chicka, bang bang, chicka
Bang, chicka, bang, chicka, bang, chicka, bang, chicka
Bang bang, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang, chicka, bang bang

[Outro: Chrish]
Never should've dropped the gun
Bang bang, chicka, chicka, bang bang
