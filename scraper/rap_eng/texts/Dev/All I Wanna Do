[Verse 1]
Staring at you all night
If you were to come a little closer
Then I might just have to touch my, yeah
Saw you in the spotlight
The way you move, I'm hungry for a piece of you
I wanna take a big bite, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you make me feel like, hoo
You know it's all I wanna do, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't care if you know me
Taste my lips and blow me
Touch your body, you know it's all I wanna do
Don't care if you know me
Just shut up and show me
Fuck your body, you know it's all I wanna do

[Verse 2]
I got your attention
I can't stop my mind from thinking
'Bout those dirty things I shouldn't mention
I forgot to mention
Fuck what kind of car you're driving
Boy, I only wanna see the engine

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you make me feel like, hoo
You know it's all I wanna do

[Chorus]
Don't care if you know me
Taste my lips and blow me
Touch your body, you know it's all I wanna do
Don't care if you know me
Just shut up and show me
Fuck your body, you know it's all I wanna do

[Bridge]
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you make me feel like, hoo
You know it's all I wanna do

[Chorus]
Don't care if you know me
Taste my lips and blow me
Touch your body, you know it's all I wanna do
Don't care if you know me
Just shut up and show me
Fuck your body, you know it's all I wanna do
