Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizzurred
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Hey, hey, hey
We balling, another grand, another grand
When I roll 50 deep I blow a 100 grand
This the way I play ya'll understand?
Champagne bottle after bottle, damn
Glass after glass til you feel a buzz
Baby bring it over, let me fill it up
I ain't did little shit since a little kid
I'm a big boy now so I do it big
Rose, Moet, Dom P, just a taste of Hennessy
Crystal it go down how it supposed to go down
When you fuck with me
I mean my paper straight, I blow the cake
We bounce to the 808
I mean I'm super rich, su-super rich
Never mind why we do this ish

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
She ain't drunk, she acting like she drunk
So I can do what I want
I'm touching her where I want
From behind and up front
She's a freak, I'm a freak
Funny how we just meet
Right here out on the floor
Give me more, give me more

[Bridge: The Cataracs]
Hell Yeaa
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin like they drunk
They be actin like they drunk, actin-actin like they drunk
When sober girls around me actin-actin like they drunk

[Bridge: The Cataracs]
It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't Touch this)
It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't Touch this)
Hell Yeah, Make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up
Hell Yeah, Make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up
