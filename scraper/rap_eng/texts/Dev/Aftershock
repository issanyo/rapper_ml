[Verse 1: Dev]
This feels familiar
I remember these steps
Oh break me down
Pick up the pieces

[Pre-Chorus: Dev]
You're dangerous, I know
So unpredictable
Destructive, I know
You're so critical

[Chorus: Dev]
Sweet mistake, watch me break
When I've had enough
I want it all, all your love
Aftershock

[Verse 2: Dev]
We've been here before
Back and forth
Even when I paid the price
I can't let go

[Pre-Chorus: Dev]
You're dangerous, I know
So unpredictable
Destructive, I know
You're so critical

[Chorus: Dev]
Sweet mistake, watch me break
When I've had enough
I want it all, all your love
Aftershock
Aftershock
