[Verse 1]
In a painting crystal clear we are waiting
All the colors cause emotions
It was just like yesterday, oh
The ocean shined bright blue
Everything that we said was true
Though we hope that we'll never change
There's just nothing left to say

[Chorus]
We're fading out, we're fading out
We're fading out, we're fading out
We're fading out
This is the way I feel, I feel now
We're fading out
This is the way I feel, I fee now
I wasn't meant to just go through the motions
This is the way I feel, I feel now

[Verse 2]
You're groping
In your tower, you're wasting
Looking backwards, we can't move forward
Don't wanna talk 'bout yesterday, no
Now the ocean's saying it too
The sea stone is the saw one through
Sometimes you pick up right where you left off
Now there's nothing left
Now there's, now there's nothing left

[Chorus]
We're fading out, we're fading out
We're fading out, we're fading out
We're fading out
This is the way I feel, I feel now
We're fading out
This is the way I feel, I fee now
I wasn't meant to just go through the motions
This is the way I feel, I feel now

A E I O U U U U
A E I O U U U U
A E I O U U U U
A E I O U U U U
A E I O U U U U
A E I O U U U U
A E I O U U U U
A E I O U U U U

[Chorus 2]
This is the way I feel, I feel it
This is the way I feel, I feel now
This is the way I feel, I feel it
I wasn't meant to just go through the motions
This is the way I feel, I feel it
