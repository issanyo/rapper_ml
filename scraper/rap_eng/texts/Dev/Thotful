[Hook: Gxlden Child]
Know the devil tryina play me on some fake shit
Always pray the Lord is on my side, oh why?
Cuz these niggas always pull-up on some lame shit
Tryina see a nigga fall right on sight

[Hook: Dev]
But I don't mind
Never been a bow tie
Nigga fuck a co-sign
Diamonds make you go blind
Did this on my own grind
Baby girl she won't lie
Guaranteed she gonna ride
I be feeling so high, yeah

[Hook: Gxlden Child]
She was fucking with a nigga for a ride last night, uh
Shawty was a stripper till 9:05
Ouh she thotful
Ouh she thotful

[Verse: Gxlden Child]
And she can't find her way back
Lemme pick you up girl I'ma pullup in the maybach
She like goldie always sippin on that lean
If you love me won't you show me what it means, ugh
More like what you hiding? Girl you ain't exciting
I know that you're the reason all these niggas always buying
Shawty straight from China looking like she from the islands
Now I'm lost in Helladise with all these diamonds

[Hook: Gxlden Child]
Know the devil tryina play me on some fake shit
Always pray the Lord is on my side, oh why?
Cuz these niggas always pull-up on some lame shit
Tryina see a nigga fall right on sight

[Hook: Dev]
But I don't mind
Never been a bow tie
Nigga fuck a co-sign
Diamonds make you go blind
Did this on my own grind
Baby girl she won't lie
Guaranteed she gonna ride
I be feeling so high, yeah

[Hook: Gxlden Child]
She was fucking with a nigga for a ride last night, uh
Shawty was a stripper till 9:05
Ouh she thotful
Ouh she thotful
