[Intro]
I wanna take this money, get out of town
Buy some time we can make it some how
Waitin' for a dream to come around
You know me better than that
Baby, I'm not down

[Verse 1]
I left a letter for my sister in a bottle full of booze
One day I'm gonna love you, too
But for now, I'm runnin', oh
I'm runnin' south
They say you better have a way back home
But I know, they won't forget my name back home
But for now, I'm runnin', oh
I'm runnin' south

[Verse 2]
Can you see it on my face?
Small town girl, never new my place
So I got first in line for the race
People tellin' me, "Don't let your dreams go to waste"
But what are dreams if you never sleep
Now my dreams are alive and this life is sweet
Drippin' in my lights
A piece of the pie, I think I need a slice
How can I be lost in the dark?
I thought I was walkin' on stars
And even if I wanted to restart
I can't go back home cause I came this far
So, can you see it on my face, man?
Are you amazed, the way I make magic in the wasteland?
Los Angeles, California I love you bitch
Let me lick you and put a stamp up on ya
A flower blooms, then a bug eats it
I heard a rumor, should I feed it?
I got a secret, can you keep it?
Shhh, listen, listen, listen
