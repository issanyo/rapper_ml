I can never sleep when you come
I play your game, and I play it all night long
I can never fake it out [?]
I'm tired in this Wednesday, feels too long

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

And we rolling, rolling like the wheels on a Benz
And we going, going and there's no end
Got bills, got dollars but I didn't pay rent
We decide to go, leave without our friends

Everybody is working for the weekend
Everybody needs a little romance
Everybody is goin' off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance

You got a piece of my heart
You got a piece of my heart
You got a piece of my heart
You got a piece of my heart

Dirty diamond, but you shine so bright
[?] filling this room
Blame it on you, we can blame it on you
Blame it on you, [?] filling this room

And we rolling, rolling like the wheels on a Benz
And we going, going and there's no end
Got bills, got dollars but I didn't pay rent
We decide to go , leave without our friends

Everybody is working for the weekend
Everybody needs a little romance
Everybody is goin' off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance

You got a piece of my heart
You got a piece of my heart
You got a piece of my heart
You got a piece of my heart
