[Chorus]Baby I'm not usually a shy dude
And I know we use to date in high school
No more
It's just a little something that I wrote
Love letter just a little love letter
Saying hey girl I know you don't know me
But maybe we could chill some time
Drink a little wine
You'll find
Everything you need is right in front of your eyes
Got me singing hey girl I know you don't know me
And I betcha get this all the time
But I can't lie
Every time you leave I want to press rewind
Say hey hey hey
I love you
(chica chica chica)
Hey hey hey
I love you
See what I was really trying to say was well uh

[Verse 1]L-O-V-E is a four letter word
She got me looking for a better herb
Cause she getting highest
Higher than the clouds
On my flight to L.A. and I'm looking for the flyest
If love is a drug I just want to try it
One hit of her lips is like a coke diet
Can't eat can't sleep
I can't silence what I feel so deep
And my heartbeats for her
And she don't want me
But all I need is time and time is money
And I'm a grown man just trying to be funny
But I guess this is about money
And cars so I close my tab at the bar
So I close my tab at the bar
And just then she walked in
I had to to tell her

[Chorus]I'm not usually a shy dude
And I know we use to date in high school
No more
It's just a little something that I wrote
Love letter just a little love letter
Saying hey girl I know you don't know me
But maybe we could chill some time
Drink a little wine
You'll find
Everything you need is right in front of your eyes
Got me singing hey girl I know you don't know me
And I betcha get this all the time
But I can't lie
Every time you leave I want to press rewind
Say hey hey hey
I love you
(chica chica chica)
Hey hey hey
I love you
See what I was really trying to say was well um

[Verse 2]she's a saint I'm a sinner
She want to drink wine I got a vineyard
I'm straight but a little off centered
And it would mean the world if you wanted to enter
I let ya up inside my she could ride my
(step)
Lady gaga
(ohh)
Shenana
I'm feeling good but I need her love
Cause when it all adds up
(chica chica)
A plus
I'm just a regular guy who's gettin' paid
Every single day, dancing in the rain
Bitch I'm on and I want you
I even wrote this song just to flaunt you
I love you

[Chorus]Baby I'm not usually a shy dude
And I know we use to date in high school
No more
It's just a little something that I wrote
Love letter just a little love letter
Saying hey girl I know you don't know me
But maybe we could chill some time
Drink a little wine
You'll find
Everything you need is right in front of your eyes
Got me singing hey girl I know you don't know me
And I betcha get this all the time
But I can't lie
Every time you leave I want to press rewind
Say hey hey hey
I love you
(chica chica chica)
Hey hey hey
I love you
See what I was really trying to say was well um
