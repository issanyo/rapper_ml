[Chorus]
Everywhere I look, everywhere I look
I see shadows haunting over me
And I wonder when they'll let me be

[Verse 1]
Lost in my mind late at night
And you're who I see in my dreams
Deepest eyes tucked aside
A pain that doesn't sting

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I've ran and I know I hide
I know I've changed, I know I lied
I knew I should but I couldn't see
Bridges burnin' in back of me
Oh, help me out, holy ghost
I have lost the only thing I know
And all, all I have left are shadows

[Chorus]
Everywhere I look, everywhere I look
I see shadows haunting over me
And I wonder when they'll let me be

[Bridge]
I wonder as the morning news
I wonder when tomorrow's done
The words you never got to hear
They were just right there on the tip of my tongue

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I scare myself
By my own lies that I once bought
They cannot be resold
Sometimes I feel the hurt
If I was gold, I'd turn to sand
And in the end, it could not hold

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I've ran and I know I hide
I know I've changed, I know I lied
I knew I should but I couldn't see
Bridges burnin' in back of me
Ooh, help me out, holy ghost
I have lost my way from your road
And all, all I have left are shadows

[Chorus]
Everywhere I look, everywhere I look
I see shadows haunting over me
And I wonder when they'll let me be

[Outro]
Oh, help me out, holy ghost
I have lost the only thing I know
And all, all I have left are shadows
