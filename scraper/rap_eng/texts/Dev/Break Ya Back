[Verse 1: Timbaland]
(Go on, Tim)
Timmy is my nickname, making beats' my main thing
When it comes to women, if you know you're working bootey
Money is no object, what I want I got that
Don't get it twisted, cause I still hand in the budgets
Platinum plaques from way back, look what I provided
Virginia on the map now we causing a riot
And the Virginia Islands, Belly you's a hot-head
I'm so fly, can't tell I switched to chocolate
Back to this clubin' "Lady where's your husband?"
I got you thighs rubbin from this bass I be pumpin
(Bum bum bum bum bum) Timbaland I be buzzing
Haters I hear ya talking but ya be soundin' fuzza'
When I know you love me, only God above me
Timbaland, Timbaland got to got to cry out for me
Go and toast your bluntly, Act a fool, get ugly
Cause I'm bout to beak ya, break ya
Break yo back homie

[Verse 2: Dev]
Dev out here from Cali, no one in my alley
All the boys is at me tryna find my hidden valley
All dressed in Cavalli, in a black Denali
My swagger is so, so, so hot, I can start a pep rally
The game, they can't deny me, bitches is gon' try me
I just keep on going cause I'm cooler than ice-cream
Dev on your flatscreen, yes, I rap plus sing
I know you wanna be my be like me but you can be my offspring
Hehe hehe hehe, boys, calm yo pee pee
I know you see this phatty but no touchies and no feelies
Boom boom boom boom boom, the bass breaking ceiling
I'm the top, bitch, don't get caught in your feeling
Get used to hear me, better yet, just kill me
I'm gon' be around for a while, you feel me?
Club in the frizzy, all my girls tipsy
Now who in the world, the world you know fucking with me? Imma

[Pre-Hook: Dev Timbaland]

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
My gatorade is different, Girl's like body piercing
I'm here right now in your town and down *Phew* like a worldwind
My-my-my master done this darling, but who been really carin'
L-L-long as it sounds good and my bass hit was a low hit
F-F-fella keep that chosen, cause you don't really know them
Some girls they look clean, but they clean is really poison
A.B. is the foundation, and MoNiKe is dispose
You all be callin' us if you don't heat up precation
Uh-uh-uh, I'm nauseous, I'm so cold you frost-bit
I still got it, my crew got it, but nigga you lost it
Be machine incause it, put it in your closet
And don't try to compete with me
People be nigga forfeit
You need to make wise choice, cause I'm like fresh big porget
My engine is like, like-like-like 700 hundred horses
Orianous light your torches
Act a fool get towards it
Cause I'm bout to break-break-break
Break ya back, homie

[Outro: Timbaland]
Break your back homie, Break your back homie
Break-break-break-break, Break-break-break-break
Break your back homie
Break your back homie, Break your back homie
Break-break-break-break, Break-break-break-break
Break your back homie
