[Chorus]
I could be your Costa Rica chica fo' the weekend
Strawberita bonita out in the deep end
Arms 'round your waist, catchin' waves, jet skiin'
You gonna like the way I look, guarantee it
I could be your Costa Rica chica fo' the weekend
Strawberita bonita out in the deep end
Arms 'round your waist, catchin' waves, jet skiin'
You gonna like the way I look, guarantee it

[Verse 1]
They say, "Honesty's the best policy"
But honestly, I want you all over all of me
Baby, you know I'm just a call away
And I'm so sick of waitin' for you to start callin' me

I always hit you up when I'm drunk as fuck
And you only ever respond at 3 in the morn'
I'm just sayin', we both need a vacation
And I'm sick of FaceTime and you playin' PlayStationÂ®

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I been thinkin' 'bout you lately
Skinny dippin' in a daydream
Got me all caught up in my feelins
Maybe we should take a trip

[Chorus]
I could be your Costa Rica chica fo' the weekend
Strawberita bonita out in the deep end
Arms 'round your waist, catchin' waves, jet skiin'
You gonna like the way I look, guarantee it
I could be your Costa Rica chica fo' the weekend
Strawberita bonita out in the deep end
Arms 'round your waist, catchin' waves, jet skiin'
You gonna like the way I look, guarantee it

[Verse 2]
They say, "Distance make the heart grow fonder"
But add a little time, it gets a little harder
When I close my eyes, see you by my side
And in my mind, we're layin' by the water

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I been thinkin' 'bout you lately
Skinny dippin' in a daydream
Got me all caught up in my feelins
Maybe we should take a trip

[Chorus]
I could be your Costa Rica chica fo' the weekend
Strawberita bonita out in the deep end
Arms 'round your waist, catchin' waves, jet skiin'
You gonna like the way I look, guarantee it
I could be your Costa Rica chica fo' the weekend
Strawberita bonita out in the deep end
Arms 'round your waist, catchin' waves, jet skiin'
You gonna like the way I look, guarantee it

[Outro]
Skinny dippin', skinny dippin' in, day
Skinny dippin' in a daydream
Skinny dippin', skinny dippin' in, day
