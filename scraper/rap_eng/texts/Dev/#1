[Chorus: Dev]
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, get it, 1

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Boyfriend number 2, but I was number 1
And I hardly hear your voice, it's like you up to somethin'
Why do I always feel alone, but you don't owe me nothin'
Deja vu, we did it trice, I think I'm Obie's cousin
Was always somethin' to me, but obviously was nothin'
Love from my backstroke, I could tell you wasn't frontin'
On a G6 in the mile high club
Never was a gentleman, I was always your thug

[Chorus: Dev]
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, get it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
Number 1 fan, now forget it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, get it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
Number 1 fan, now forget it

[Verse 2: Dev]
Last summer, I was riding in your Hummer
Baby, isn't it a bummer that it's over?
Crazy, I used to call you "baby," now you hate me
We used to go all night, but now it's just a fuckin' bar fight
I know you hate it when I talk like that
Alright, you remember prom night
Yeah, that was a bomb night

[Pre-Chorus: Dev]
Try to stay committed
But you never stick around, I don't get it
I used to be your number 1 fan, now forget it
I used to be your number 1 fan
Try to stay committed
But you never stick around, I don't get it
I used to be your number 1 fan, now forget it
I used to be your number 1 fan

[Chorus: Dev]
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, get it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
Number 1 fan, now forget it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, get it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
Number 1 fan, now forget it

[Verse 3: Dev]
Remember, in the middle of December
You were practically a member of my family
It kinda sucks that I always have this kinda love
We used to drink all day, stay up listenin' to Kanye
He used to love to take the long way home
But these days, all I have is keepsakes locked inside a briefcase

[Pre-Chorus: Dev]
Try to stay committed
But you never stick around, I don't get it
I used to be your number 1 fan, now forget it
I used to be your number 1 fan
Try to stay committed
But you never stick around, I don't get it
I used to be your number 1 fan, now forget it
I used to be your number 1 fan

[Chorus: Dev]
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, get it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
Number 1 fan, now forget it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
1, 1, get it
1, 1, 1, get it, 1
Number 1 fan, now forget it
