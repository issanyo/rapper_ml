[Verse 1]
I don't know who you are
Or who you believe to be
But I, I like what I see
And, you don't gotta be on movie screens
Cause god damn boy, you're for me
And don't call me a star in these old denim jeans
You are that thing that's setting me free
So, stay the night, talk to me, let's have a dream
Boy, get lost with me

[Chorus]
When you need to breathe
I'll make your heart beat twice as fast
Like a cigarette and I will be your perfect match
Perfect match, perfect match

[Verse 2]
I wanna stay up late and laugh a few all night
Story tell about both of our lives and
We can lay side by side
Boy, hold on for the ride, one night
You know I love your style
And the taste of your bittersweet smile
Won't you scream with me?
A little nightmare and a dream with me

[Chorus]
When you need to breathe
I'll make your heart beat twice as fast
Like a cigarette and I will be your perfect match
Perfect match, perfect match

[Bridge]
Whispers, calling, falling
Don't let me
I have just a spark left
Let me up and I'll set us both free

[Outro]
So close your eyes, close your eyes
