[Intro: Fabolous]
Yeah
Hands up this high, tell 'em haters kiss my
Hands up this high, tell 'em I said kiss my
Hands up this high, tell 'em Dev

[Verse 1: Dev]
I was sittin' on the beach, starin' at the nite
Pulled out a ciggarette, and you were there with the light
What you tryin' to do, lookin' in my eyes
Pretty boy step back, you don't wanna take this fight
But if you wanna talk, well first you gotta listen
I ain't like those other girls that you been missin'
I knew it all along, queen of my throne
One of a kind, I'm in a league of my own

[Chorus: Dev]
And get your hand off my hip and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk?
Cause we're only gettin' older
I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over
I know you weren't expectin' this tonite
But, baby, that's me

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Ain't gotta answer, but which lips are you talking?
Exotic dancers strut, I would tip you for walking
We could role-play, I'm Christopher Walken
I treat you like a queen and I'm king of New Yorkin'
Welcome to my city, pretty fast paced, ain't it?
I put on weight but the pockets the only place gained it
Life's better when sipping glasses of Ace, ain't it?
Them other boys are jokers without they face painted
You play your cards right, you might get lucky tonight
Bring the vampire out, I suck and I bite
I'm a fucking rapper, I fuck and I write
I got 'em throwing jabs, I'm ducking the rights
And bobbing the lefts but I'm ready to counter
Lay you out for the count on the kitchen counter
Yeah, they kitchen counter, call me Mr. Anywhere
What you think I'mma do when you whisper in my ear?

[Chorus: Dev]
And get your hand off my hip and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk?
Cause we're only gettin' older
I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over
I know you weren't expectin' this tonite
But, baby, that's me

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, that's me

[Bridge: Dev]
I know what you want, you know what I need
Show me what I came for
There's only one thing you gotta do for me
Just promise not to stop when I say so
I know what you want, you know what I need
Show me what I came for
There's only one thing you gotta do for me
Just promise not to stop when I say so

[Chorus: Dev]
And get your hand off my hip and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk?
Cause we're only gettin' older
I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over
I know you weren't expectin' this tonite
But, baby, that's me

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
