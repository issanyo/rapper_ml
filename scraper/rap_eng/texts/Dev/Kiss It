[Verse 1: Dev]
Let me make it clear
I don't want you here
Feels like it's been years
Only been a month
Looking in the mirror
I had more beers than I shed tears
I don't even drink
Drink, drink, drink

[Chorus: Dev]
You say you wasn't even mad
So why you gotta be like that?
I told you I would be right back
Don't like it? You can kiss my ass
Don't you worry about my heart
Knew you would break it from the start
I thought that we could make it last
Now I'd rather you kiss my ass

[Post-Chorus: Dev)
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
Yeah, what? What up, Dev?
I enter through the exer
Girls giving me numbers, telling me text her
Me and Dev be hotter than Texas
Taught her the MTV, the way all these dudes get Next-ed
He getting hectic, living life so reckless
My money Tetris, play you instrument Nexus
And [?] got shot with a 12 gauge
Spoil your ass and dream like 12 play
Since you left me, I'm a new man
You wanted space, here's some new RAM
All my exes, I dodge 'em like new rims
Racing to that money in that new Ram

[Chorus: Dev]
You say you wasn't even mad
So why you gotta be like that?
I told you I would be right back
Don't like it? You can kiss my ass
Don't you worry about my heart
You would break it from the start
I thought that we could make it last
Now I'd rather you kiss my ass

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it

[Verse 3: Dev]
Didn't work out, gym
Couldn't fuck with him
He won't take a hint
He should get a clue
He was more broke
Than he was a joke
I don't even smoke
I should be more blunt
Blunt, blunt, blunt

[Chorus: Dev]
You say you wasn't even mad
So why you gotta be like that?
I told you I would be right back
Don't like it? You can kiss my ass
Don't you worry about my heart
You would break it from the start
I thought that we could make it last
Now I'd rather you kiss my ass

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
