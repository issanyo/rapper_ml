[Intro: Dev]
Boy you know you get me high
Won't you take me for a ride
Tell me where you want to go, Ooooh
Tell me where you want to go, Ooooh

It's The Cataracs

[Verse 1: The Cataracs]
Yo, it's that dancefloor, 808
She hit me like a 808
Have you all night, vodka straight
Bottles up, you and me

Me and you, on a trip
All night flight, girl let's dip
Lickin' my lips I'm in the zone
And I can't really say what I'm sippin' on

You taste good to me
Girls like you make history
Sure does sound like a hit to me
Now che-e-e-ck out this beat

[Hook: The Cataracs]
Now, you got it
You got it goin' on,goin' on
And on, and on, and on, and on

[Dev]
Boy you know you get me high
Won't you take me for a ride
Tell me where you want to go, Ooooh
Tell me where you want to go, Ooooh
I'm your Bonnie, you're my Clyde
I'll be your "ride or die"
Tell me where you want to go, Ooooh
Tell me where you want to go, Ooooh

[The Cataracs]
T-t-t-to the top of the world (x2)

[Verse 2: The Cataracs]
Your daddy must have been a drug dealer (Why?)
Cause you dope
You the Bonnie to my Clyde, Juliet and Romeo
Your daddy must have been a drug dealer (Why?)
I don't know
I'm just saying anything to get me up inside your throat
Is it workin'? I'm just playin
Man this bottle got me sayin'
I don't ever wanna lose, lose ya right now

[Hook: Cataracs]
T-t-t-to the top of the world

[Dev]
Tell me where you want to go (x4)
Where, you want, where you wanna go? (x4)

[The Cataracs]
T-t-t-to the top of the world

[Dev]
It's The Cataracs
