[Chorus]
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
I'mma show you how I want it, so you can give me something
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
You can gimmie some, gimmie some of it

[Verse 1]
My breathless impatience grows with every moment
I'm waiting, I'm counting, 1, 2, 3
You're killing me with just one look
And you don't have to say a word
For every little glance I hurt
So I don't wanna hear it

[Chorus]
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
I'mma show you how I want it, so you can give me something
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
You can gimmie some, gimmie some of it

[Verse 2]
My tensions, ambitions fulfill with every moment
Together, I'm counting, 1, 2, 3
You're killing me with just one look
And you don't have to say a word
For every little glance I hurt
So I don't wanna hear it

[Chorus]
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
I'mma show you how I want it, so you can give me something
Gimmie some, gimmie some of it
You can gimmie some, gimmie some of it
