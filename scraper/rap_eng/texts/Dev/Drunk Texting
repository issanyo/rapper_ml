[Verse 1]
Sitting on my bed like, thinking 'bout you all night
I wonder what you're up to, it's 3 am, I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
There's liquor in my bloodstream
My heartbeat is starting to race, oh
And, oh, my temptations stay dragging me back to this place, ayo

[Chorus]
Someone save me 'fore I lose control
My glass is empty and your voicemail full
I'm not the type to keep on typing
I was sure those things I shoulda said out loud
Call me crazy, but I'm vulnerable
I'm drunk texting and I'm drunk calling
I'm not known for being reckless, I'm just drunk
I'm drunk texting and I'm drunk calling
I'm not known for being reckless, I'm just drunk

[Verse 2]
Crawling in the sheets like, I miss you on the right side
I wonder why we don't talk, you don't return my phone calls

[Pre-Chorus]
There's liquor in my bloodstream
My heartbeat is starting to race, oh
And, oh, my temptations stay dragging me back to this place, ayo

[Chorus]
Someone save me 'fore I lose control
My glass is empty and your voicemail full
I'm not the type to keep on typing
I was sure those things I shoulda said out loud
Call me crazy, but I'm vulnerable
I'm drunk texting and I'm drunk calling
I'm not known for being reckless, I'm just drunk
I'm drunk texting and I'm drunk calling
I'm not known for being reckless, I'm just drunk
