[Verse 1]
You say you know her
Well I know her too
You say you know her
But you don't know her like I do
You say you love her
Once upon a time I loved her too
You say you love her
But you don't love her like I do
You've got to give me that girl
Or I will take her from you

[Chorus]
Love me like you say you do
Love me like you say you do
Love me like you say

[Verse 2]
You say you're over
I say over who?
It's gonna be over my dead body
The day she finds someone new
You've got to give me that girl
Or I will take her from you

[Chorus]
Love me like you say you do
Love me like you say you do
Love me like you say you do
Love me like you say you do

[Bridge]
You know that I want you
And if I can't have you, then no one can
But I need you, and when I find you
You've got to give me that girl
Or I...

[Chorus]
Love me like you say you do
Love me like you say you do
