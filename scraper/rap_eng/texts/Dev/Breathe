[Intro]
Breath, breathe
Breathe, breathe
It's Dev
Breathe, breathe

[Hook]
Are you gonna make me breathe?
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Are you gonna make me breathe?
Breathe, breathe, breathe

[Verse 1]
I ain't a stripper, but you're making me wanna strip
Ain't no beginner, but you make me feel like it's my first trip

[Pre-Hook]
So give me back the feeling only you can bring me
Away from all the lights of the floor
Way above the ceiling, this night's what you make it
So wanna pass out
We bout to spark it up, up, up

[Hook]
And if I take it way too far tonight
Out of control, lost in the light
Before everything fades to black
Put your lips on me and breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Are you gonna make me breathe?
Breathe, breathe, breathe

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna get ya, gonna, gonna make you fall in love
Take a hold of my body, tell me what you're dreaming of

[Pre-Hook]
Give me back the feeling only you can bring me
Away from all the lights of the floor
Way above the ceiling, this night's what you make it
So wanna pass out
We bout to spark it up, up, up

[Hook]
And if I take it way too far tonight
Out of control, lost in the light
Before everything fades to black
Put your lips on me and breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe
You just gotta help me breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Are you gonna make me breathe?

[Bridge]
I see you standing there
Why are you just standing there?
Better come over here
I need you right now
This is the night the sun came up
Right here, right now

[Hook]
Breathe, breathe, breathe
You just gotta help me breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Are you gonna make me breathe?
Breathe, breathe, breathe
You just gotta help me breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe
