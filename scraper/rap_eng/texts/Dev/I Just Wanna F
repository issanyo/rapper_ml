[Verse 1: Timbaland & Dev]
Take you to my house, put you on my couch
Put this in your mouth, then I'm going south
Say my name! What's your name again?
What's your name again?
Say my name! What's your name again?
What's your name again?
Take you to my room, have you saying "Ooh!"
Baby like that? Yeah, you know what to do
Say my name! What's your name again?
What's your name again?
Say my name! What's your name again?
What's your name again?
Baby I don't know, I don't usually do
Listen to me know, but you can have my two
Lips on your... yeah I know what to do
Baby it don't matter, I've been drinkin'
Do whatever, boy!

[Verse 3: Dev]
You can be my student, give you schoolin'
Show you how to make it bounce like a bad check
I can be your teacher, I can teach you
How to get straight A's but you really want an F!
You can bite, go fetch
I know it's right, but go left
Living in the night, but we hardly dream
In the club going Charlie Sheen
