[Verse 1]
How many numbers you got on that phone?
How many girls you gonna use that line on?
How many hearts you breaking on the regular?
Another level son, what's up with that?
Yeah, lover you has gone way too far
How many times you gonna talk about your new car?
And the icing on the cake is that you pretend
You got no girlfriend, but she at home again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you la, l-l-la, l-l-lock and load
I'm like, yo, that is not how you float the boat
I'm like no, no, you don't know, know
There's a lot, l-l-lot, a lot more to me
And there's a lot more sharks swimming in the sea
I'm like no, no, you don't know, know

[Chorus]
So if you wanna come at me
Slow down like a melody
No matter how far you go
Boy, the answer is no
If you wanna come at me
Don't hit hard like an enemy
No matter how far you go
Boy, the answer is no

[Verse 2]
How do you think that you can have your way?
What made you think that I would be your baby?
Making me laugh, you think you're so incredible
Another level son, you're an animal
Nobody's got the key to my house
Nobody's paying, I built this kingdom
Who do you think you are, coming like royalty?
Enough of flattery, you're getting out on me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you la, l-l-la, l-l-lock and load
I'm like, yo, that is not how you float the boat
I'm like no, no, you don't know, know
There's a lot, l-l-lot, a lot more to me
And there's a lot more sharks swimming in the sea
I'm like no, no, you don't know, know

[Chorus]
So if you wanna come at me
Slow down like a melody
No matter how far you go
Boy, the answer is no
If you wanna come at me
Don't hit hard like an enemy
No matter how far you go
Boy, the answer is no
