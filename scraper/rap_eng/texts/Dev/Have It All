[Verse 1]
Remember when we had it all
Remember the midnight phone calls
You used to take me out to dinner at the food court
Now I don't got no one beside me eating Chinese at the mall
I thought you had a ball
Thought it was forever, but not at all
I used to take you to the movies, that was my treat
Now I ain't gotta split my money, I deserve to have it all

[Chorus]
Deserve to have it all, I deserve to have it all
Deserve to have it all, I deserve to have it all

[Verse 2]
Your bedroom, my fortress, money on the mattress
I hate you, I love you, there's plenty more where that came from
I lied, I'm sorry, you partied and partied
You gave up, I just started, this is all we ever wanted
Now, I only see you when I'm dreaming
Now, I never, ever regret leaving

[Chorus]
I deserve to have it all, I deserve to have it all
I deserve to have it all, I deserve to have it all
