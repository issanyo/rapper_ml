[Verse 1: Dev & Enrique Iglesias]
You got a girl that doesn't look a thing like me
The girl your mother always said it would be
So, you could say that, you could say that I'm hopeless
But that ain't the girl, that ain't the girl I want you to be
The girl that keeps me up and I see in my dreams
So, you could say that, you could say that I love her

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
So I don't care what they say, it's our life, life, life
We can dance if we want, make it feel alright
Temperature's rising, I feel the fire
Tonight, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Both]
Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up?
Even with no make up, I don't want to fake it
And you don't gotta doubt a second if I miss you
Everytime I'm with you, I feel naked

[Post-Chorus]
I feel naked
I want it, so let me get it
You say you got it, what you gon' do with it?

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias & Dev]
If I told you girl, "Come and run away with me"
Now would you throw it all away for me
I need to know that, need to know that it's not over
Cause you were the boy Daddy told you to stay away from me
But you're nothing but a fantasy
I need to know that, need to know that
You'd be strong enough to believe in us

[Hook: Both]
Cause I don't care what they say, it's our life, life, life
We can dance if we want, make it feel alright
Temperature's rising, I feel the fire
Tonight, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Both]
Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up?
Even with no make up, I don't want to fake it
And you don't gotta doubt a second if I miss you
Everytime I'm with you, I feel naked

[Post-Chorus: Both]
I feel naked
I want it, so let me get it
You say you got it, what you gon' do with it?

[Bridge: Both]
I don't care what they say, it's our life, life, life
We can dance if we want, make it feel alright
Temperature's rising, I feel the fire
Tonight, it's just me and you
Tonight, it's just me and you
So tell me, baby, will you be here when I wake up?

[Outro: Both]
I feel naked
I want it, so let me get it
You say you got it
I feel naked
I want it, so let me get it
You say you got it, what you gon' do with it?
Tonight, it's just me and you
