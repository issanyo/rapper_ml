[Chorus: Dev]

Bitches And they know
That I'm back up on the Crove
Got these hoes on they toes
Yeah I'm back up on the Crove

[Verse 1: Jonny English]

Back up In the basement
Feeding all them patients
Floating through the matrix
Feeling like a fucking agent
Free the free masons, this our nation
Mother fucker 50 grand on the bracelet
Thats the fragrance, marijuana smoke
So it's back on the Crove

[Verse 2: Breeze]

Yeah, Yeah
And we back on road, just back to this doe
Trying to get throwed
Smoking so much man that time getting slow
Back on the Crove, yeah
We back on the Crove, we back on the Crove
Yeah, Yeah we back on the Crove
Prism Gang

[Chorus: Dev]

Bitches And they know
That I'm back up on the Crove
Got these hoes on they toes
Yeah I'm back up on the Crove

[Outro: Dev]

Ohhhh, Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
