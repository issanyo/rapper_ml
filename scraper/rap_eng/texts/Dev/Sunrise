[Chorus: Dev]
I'm staying up late tonight, I'm in a foreign city
Poppin' bottles in the ice, and all these girls are pretty
I'm staying up late tonight, me and my best friends gettin' shitty
Poppin' bottles in the club, and you know we gettin' drunk
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up

[Verse 1: Campa & Cyrano]
I just did a car bar in the back seat of a car
I'm like a cell phone with no bars
Swing, motherfucker on par
We are here for one reason, so keep the ratio even
And keep the radio beeping (on and on) like Simpsons seasons
Bleaking, on the bathroom floor
Got her wet like a thunderstorm
Sleep with me, you're not a whore (no)
Daddy breaking down the back door
Ain't fucking, what the fuck you for?
Work it, where you get our source?
Twister, get on all fours, off the lights, on the floor

[Chorus: Dev]
I'm staying up late tonight, I'm in a foreign city
Poppin' bottles in the ice, and all these girls are pretty
I'm staying up late tonight, me and my best friends gettin' shitty
Poppin' bottles in the club, and you know we gettin' drunk
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up

[Verse 2: Cyrano & Campa]
Yeah, you're looking at the sunrise, dumb high
Got game to get you, girl, tongue-tied, untied
All of that from B-town where the ballers at
Hollaback if you my homie
If you're not, then get to know me
No snake but I might bite, girl
Half baked with a half white, girl
Ride it like a half pipe, turn you on like a flashlight, go ham
Hop on my bike, like, "Look ma, no hands"
No plans, but I'm Spiderman, you Mary Jane, my fighter man
[?], stop the beat, the sunrise look new to me

[Bridge: Campa & Cyrano]
Can you see it? What, where is it?
It's over there, yeah it is
Over the horizon
The sun, the sun, it's rising

[Chorus: Dev]
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
'Til the sunrise up, the sunrise up
