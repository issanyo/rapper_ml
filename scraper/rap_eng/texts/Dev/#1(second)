[Chorus: Dev]
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one

[Verse 1: Nef the Pharaoh]
Boyfriend number 2, but I was number 1
And I hardly hear your voice, it's like you up to somethin'
Why do I always feel alone, but you don't owe me nothin'
Deja vu, we did it trice, I think I'm Obie cousin
Was always somethin' to me, but obviously it's nothin'
Love from my backstroke, I could tell you wasn't frontin'
Sex
On a G6 in the mile high club
Never was a gentleman, I was always your thug!

[Chorus: Dev]
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
Number one fan, don't forget it
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
Number one fan, don't forget it

[Verse2: Dev]
Last summer I was riding in your Hummer
Baby, itsn't it a bummer that it's over
Crazy, I used to call you baby
But now you hate me
We used to go all night
But now it's just a fuckin' bar fight
I know you hate it when I talk like that
Alright, you remember prom night
Yeah that was a bomb night

[Pre-Chorus: Dev]
Try to stay committed
But you never don't stick a minute, I don't get it
I used to be your number one fan, don't forget it
I used to be your number one fan
I try to stay committed
But you never don't stick a minute, I don't get it
I used to be your number one fan, don't forget it
I used to be your number one fan

[Chorus: Dev]
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
Number one fan, get it one
One one, get it, don't forget it
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
Number one fan, get it one

[Verse 3: Dev]
Remember, in the middle of December
You were practically a member of my family
It kinda sucks that I always have this kinda luck
We used to drink all day, stay up listenin' to Kanye
He used to love to take the long way home
But these days, all I have it keepsakes
Packed inside a briefcase

[Pre-Chorus: Dev]
Try to stay committed
But you never don't stick a minute, I don't get it
I used to be your number one fan, don't forget it
I used to be your number one fan
I try to stay committed
But you never don't stick a minute, I don't get it
I used to be your number one fan, don't forget it
I used to be your number one fan

[Chorus: Dev]
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
Number one fan, get it one
One one, get it, don't forget it
One one, get it, get it one
One one, get it, get it one
Number one fan, get it one
