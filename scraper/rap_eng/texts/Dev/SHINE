Hook:
Thumbin through blues then i hop in the coupe
Up in the hills sippin wok at the view
Wood on the dash and i pull up and shoot
Diamonds they shining, im balling like drew
Oouu yuh
Diamonds they dancin, the choppa at you
She get alarmed, so i put her on snooze
Vvs neck and its shining like glue

Verse:
I got ice
Lookin nice
My fit clean
Like old spice
Rappers all runnin from the choppa like mice
Listerene
My teeth bright
Actin mean, but he won't fight
Pop a bean
Like mike ike
Got a couple hunnids, so catch a flight
To dubai, ball like mike
Snatch a cross, she get clout then she dip oouu
Preme cloth, get the guap then we split oou
Collin sexton how i ball on yo bih oouu
Killstreak mobbin up yo block you get hit aye
Run it up, I don’t need LV on my hip (on my hip)
Cop it anyway, you runnin from that clip
Said I dont need gucci, pull up and I drip
Like im eatin sushi, pull up wit that stick
He want smoke, he want smoke
He a goofy, he a joke
I’m thumbin through a stack i give her one night like lil boat
Yea she float, like my flow
She a hoe, got to go
Stuck in 1849 cuz she was diggin for some gold

Hook:
Thumbin through blues then i hop in the coupe
Up in the hills sippin wok at the view
Wood on the dash and i pull up and shoot
Diamonds they shining, im balling like drew
Oouu yuh
Diamonds they dancin, the choppa at you
She get alarmed, so i put her on snooze
Vvs neck and its shining like glue

Verse 2 (kill$treakmobalex)
You don’t want no smoke you run up on me comfortable, look
When i bring that tooly you gon be uncomfortable, look
I don’t play no games i’m bout to make you vulnerable, look
Imma put you in your grave and make you memorable
2-2-3 w that beam right at your face
We can pull up on your block if you want it today
Imma flex all these bands w the stars in my wraith
Your girl givin me face yeah that hoe give me faith, damn
Pow, pow, i might just let off some shots
Pow, pow, i might just let off some shots
Pow, pow, i might just let off some shots
Pow, pow, i might just let off some shots
