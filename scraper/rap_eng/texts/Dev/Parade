[Chorus]
I see the way you look when you looking my way
I see the way you look when you looking my way
Walking down the street and you know what they say
Walking, walking down the street and you know what they say
The boys go "Hi" and the girls go "Hey"
It's like a damn parade
The boys go "Hi" and the girls go "Hey" everyday

[Verse 1]
Damn, I'm out of control and I'm riding around on empty
But my glass is full so none of y'all better tempt me
I already been here before, I already did this
So I'll have another drink
Give you all a few minutes

[Pre-Chorus]
They try to get the best of me, ain't impressing me
Get obsessed with me
But I still love them, cuff them
Like "You're welcome"

[Chorus]
I see the way you look when you looking my way
I see the way you look when you looking my way
Walking down the street and you know what they say
Walking, walking down the street and you know what they say
The boys go "Hi" and the girls go "Hey"
It's like a damn parade
The boys go "Hi" and the girls go "Hey" everyday

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I'm so cold and I can't help it
When I walk down the street, baby, it's selfish
I'm in the building and I'm being so rebellious
The night is young, I'm finna be on
And everybody jealous

[Pre-Chorus]
They try to get the best of me, ain't impressing me
Get obsessed with me
But I still love them, cuff them
Like "You're welcome"

[Chorus]
I see the way you look when you looking my way
I see the way you look when you looking my way
Walking down the street and you know what they say
Walking, walking down the street and you know what they say
The boys go "Hi" and the girls go "Hey"
It's like a damn parade
The boys go "Hi" and the girls go "Hey" everyday

[Bridge]
Where all my boys at? Where all my boys?
Where all my girls at?
They making noise
Where all my boys at? Where all my boys?
Where all my girls at?
They making noise
Hey, hey
Where all my girls at?
They making noise

[Chorus]
I see the way you look when you looking my way
I see the way you look when you looking my way
Walking down the street and you know what they say
Walking, walking down the street and you know what they say
The boys go "Hi" and the girls go "Hey"
It's like a damn parade
The boys go "Hi" and the girls go "Hey" everyday
