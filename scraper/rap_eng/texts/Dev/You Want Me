[Chorus]
You want me, you want me, you want me, you want me
These bitches is phony, bitches bologna, I just go salami
We came with the honey, the money you dummy, it's stuffed in our tummies
We touchin' the city, crushin' the city and fuckin' the city
You want me, you want me, you want me, you want me
These bitches is phony, bitches bologna, I just go salami
We came with the honey, the money you dummy, it's stuffed in our tummies
We touchin' the city, crushin' the city and fuckin' the city

[Verse 1]
Aye, I'm on a whole 'nother level
You riding some wave, I'm dancing with the devil
And I'm tipsy, like "Oh no, she didn't"
Let's sit back and watch all these-all these bitches feel pretty

[Pre-Chorus]
Clap clap clap for 'em, make it go plow
Like all these hoes better, watch their motherfuckin' mouth
Show me, show me just how well you know me
Champagne all bust on me, it's about to go down

[Chorus]
You want me, you want me, you want me, you want me
These bitches is phony, bitches bologna, I just go salami
We came with the honey, the money you dummy, it's stuffed in our tummies
We touchin' the city, crushin' the city and fuckin' the city
You want me, you want me, you want me, you want me
These bitches is phony, bitches bologna, I just go salami
We came with the honey, the money you dummy, it's stuffed in our tummies
We touchin' the city, crushin' the city and fuckin' the city

[Verse 2]
Wait, hold up, no we ain't the same
My baby daddy winning and not just for the day, aye
We do clock-in, clock-out, we turn up, turn the lights out
Big schemes, big dreams and takin' hella flights out

[Pre-Chorus]
Clap clap clap for 'em, make it go plow
Like all these hoes better, watch their motherfuckin' mouth
Show me, show me just how well you know me
Champagne all bust on me, it's about to go down

[Chorus]
You want me, you want me, you want me, you want me
These bitches is phony, bitches bologna, I just go salami
We came with the honey, the money you dummy, it's stuffed in our tummies
We touchin' the city, crushin' the city and fuckin' the city
You want me, you want me, you want me, you want me
These bitches is phony, bitches bologna, I just go salami
We came with the honey, the money you dummy, it's stuffed in our tummies
We touchin' the city, crushin' the city and fuckin' the city
