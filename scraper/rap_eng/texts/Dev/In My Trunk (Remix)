[Hook: Dev]
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
You know what? I thought about it
I drive her crazy and yo, you just rode around that
She so astoundin' and pull up to your bumper, baby
Let me get your number, baby
Maybe we can have another baby

[Verse 2: Dev]
It was late night, no Scrabble, game night
I'm a handful, ain't I? Ain't I, ain't I?
Let me show you
Backseat, front door you
Pop the trunk, shut your mouth and turn that up

[Pre-Hook: Dev]
We ride by like there's no one there
And they stop and stare, yeah they stop and stare
We ride by like nobody knows what's in my trunk
What's in my trunk

[Hook: Dev]
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Boom boom, turn it up
I'm so cool, I'mma burn it up
Wife beater, tatted up
Know my plans but add it up
Long hair, matted up
She got a big trunk, so back it up
I got a bad bitch, with a bad bitch
But that last bitch ain't bad enough
W W W do
Get money, that big money
I walk around with your rent money
Straight up and down, six thirty
My crib big, my car big
The ass on my broad big
My weed smell like armpit
What's in that trunk? Aw shit

[Hook: Dev]
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk

[Bridge: Dev]
Got the North, got the East, got the West with me
So I suggest you better not mess with me
Be cool, you don't wanna squat 'em
We could do the fool, but you don't want no problems
I put that on something, I put that on fathers
I put that on something, I put that on mamas
I put that on something, I put that on [?]
You run up on me, get your man beat up

[Hook: Dev]
It's in my trunk, it's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
It's in my trunk
I got that thump, it's in my trunk
