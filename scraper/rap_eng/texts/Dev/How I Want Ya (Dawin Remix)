It's the King of the dance floor

[Verse 1: Hudson Thames]
All you want, all you need
I could be your anything
Tell me, girl, what you need
Honest eyes, no disguise
You know where I'll be tonight
Tell me, girl, what you need

[Pre-Chorus: Hudson Thames]
Cause I'll be waiting for you
Trying just to get through
Tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do
And I've been up the whole night
Trying to get my head right
No matter what I do, all I want is you

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling

[Verse 2: Hudson Thames]
What's the play in this game?
Tell me if you feel the same
Do you care either way?
You can't fight what feels right
I can see it in your eyes
Say what you want to say

[Pre-Chorus: Hudson Thames]
Cause I'll be waiting for you
Trying just to get through
Tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do
And I've been up the whole night
Trying to get my head right
No matter what I do, all I want is you

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Hudson Thames]
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling

Let's go

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Hudson Thames]
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
