[Chorus]
On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night, I pretend we are
Dancing in the dark

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I'm like, come on, let me get that, love when it's pitch black
Girl, I can't see but I'mma roll through your six pack
Thinking 'bout nothing but us causing an impact
Freaking in the dark, tryna find where your lips at
Cause I like your sexy over me
I gotta have it like a habit, ain't ready to leave
I'm talking magic when it's happening under the sheets
We get it cracking in the passion, a moment of peace
Ball, she know I want it all, be all up in them drawers
Might run into a wall, like stop
It's hide-and-go-seek and I'mma go with the night out
So fly with the beauty, got the booty I like, round
So yeah, that's where my hands went, got lil mama dancing
Got her wanna bust like she hopping on a transit
Just like a bandit, Flo Rida so candid
Shorty, I know you like where my palms just landed

[Chorus: Dev]
On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night, I pretend we are
Dancing in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Dev]
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark

[Verse 2: Dev]
Can you work on me?
Open my body up and do some surgery
Now that you got me up, I wanna taste it, taste it
And see those pocket aces
Wanna see who you are
Got a sex drive, just push to start
Got a sex drive, just push to start
Push, push, push, push to start
Push, push, push, push to start
I got a sex drive just push to start

[Chorus: Dev]
On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night, I pretend we are
Dancing in the dark

[Bridge: Dev]
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
To let my hands do what they want
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark

[Outro: Dev]
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
Dancing in the dark
