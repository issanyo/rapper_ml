Smelling like your new perfume
On the way to lunch for two
Money calling all day
So we hit the mall aye

Cause we stuntin’ always
Let’s go get your hair done
Makeup and your nails done
Baby you’re a superstar
Fly enough to spare some
Sacred like a prayer huh?
If you stare in too long he gone get a fail one
Sorry that I care hun
You can’t change the way I feel
Feeling like i struck a deal
I cut all them bitches off just to let you know it’s real
Babygirl you super ill

You got it so just floan it baby
Come and get up on it baby
