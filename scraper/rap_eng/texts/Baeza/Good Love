(Chorus x2:)
You got that good love
I want it all from you
You can depend on me
To put it all on you
Baby depend on me
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

(Verse 1:)
Yeah
Give me rondevu for the weekend
I don't even need to get sleep in
Get it poppin' like the champagne
Get to freakin' and I'm goin' deep in
Ride it like a surfboard
Ride it like a surfboard
Can you handle that wave?
Tell me do you want more
Vicky secrets on the floor
Put that "Don't Disturb" on the door
She said "daddy follow me and put it in the air just to tell me that's yours"
You respect the hustle
And you respect the grind
But when I'm home and we all alone you know I'm going overtime
I told you "girl I gotta shine"
Won't let no nigga fuck with mine
And I ain't worried bout them hoes only need your lovin' in my life
Only need your lovin' yeah I said it
That feeling just like heaven
We sweat it out in every session
I ain't pull out and won't regret it

(Chorus x2)

(Verse 2:)
I need all that love
Come and bring it to me
And when we in the sheets
It's like you singing to me
Me and you we got history
Them other bitches ain't shit to me
For your love I come swiftly
Fuck it up and double dip in it
Henny in my cup sippin it
Round tour you know I'm with the shit
You lovin' how I'm steady grippin' it
You love it how I'm always diligent
Get to scratchin' when you feelin' it
I'm Michael Myers how I'm killin' it
I'm Mr. Spielberg how I'm filming it
I flip it over like I'm grillin' it
I picked you up on the West Side
Cause you said you feelin' stressed out
Now I got you on my bedside
Music playin legs stretched out
Like every time it ain't nothing new
Conversations lead to touching you
I just can't seem to get enough of you
I get a rush from when I'm loving you that's why I fuck with you
Yeah

(Chorus x2)
