[Verse 1: Baeza]
She said life ain't about smoking weed and fucking bitches grow up
Tears rollin' down my face heavily so I smoked one
I loved you girl I swear I did I never meant to hurt you
But what goes around comes around and I was in the circle
Now im feelin helpless, words can't explain my fuckin pain
But I dont expect for you to feel bad cause I put you through the same
My friends like ' Man lets hit the club ' and right now gettin gone sounds pretty good
Cause I dont wanna think about you anymore
But whats love if it ain't worth dying for

[Hook]
I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready
So far from ready, far from ready, far from ready baby
Baby let me, Baby let me, Baby let me, tell you that im sorry
I wasn't thinking about you your right
Going out partying all night
It was wrong but it felt so right
But it ain't worth this crying

[Verse 2]
Remember four years back when we first met up at the movies
Thats when I fell inlove just me and you no groupies
I said my lips was chapped so you kissed me and I kissed you back back
Everything fell in place, right after that
And I held you close and I loved you girl
I did the most and I loved it girl
You were number one, No one above you girl
I was blind towards all these other girls
Now you say that you dont even know me, I know I was wrong but fuck the old me
I Love You babe, Don't leave me lonely

[Hook]
I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready
So far from ready, far from ready, far from ready baby
Baby let me, Baby let me, Baby let me, tell you that im sorry
I wasn't thinking about you your right
Going out partying all night
It was wrong but it felt so right
But it ain't worth this crying

[Verse 3]
Yeah, three years passed and things started to get a little rocky
So we broke up and me and my ex started talkin
Didn't hear from you for like three months thought we was done for good but
I couldn't stand thinkin of you with some other dude
So I picked up my phone hopin I didn't wait too long
Cause I just miss hearin your tone and the love that we had was so strong
I told you I'd never leave you, So sorry that I decieved you
I hope you understand baby

[Hook]
I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready
So far from ready, far from ready, far from ready baby
Baby let me, Baby let me, Baby let me, tell you that im sorry
I wasn't thinking about you your right
Going out partying all night
It was wrong but it felt so right
But it ain't worth this crying

Im so sorry, so sorry, so sorry baby

I wasn't thinking about you your right
Going out partying all night
It was wrong but it felt so right
But it ain't worth this crying
