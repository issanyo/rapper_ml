I know you want me back, I ain’t trusting you (oh yeah)
Were you mad that I busted you (oh yeah)
Had a nigga on the side, hope you really down to ride
Cuz I don’t wanna fuck with you

I don’t wanna fuck with you x2

Had a nigga on the side, hope you really down to ride
Cuz I don’t wanna fuck with you

[Verse: 1]
Girl I don’t wanna fuck with you
You be in the club looking for me, i be ducking you
Just to keep it 100 i ain't never really trusted you
Fucked up, now your friends wanna fuck me too
If you see me with them, than i did em’
These bitches choosing up me, i don’t ever have to pick em’
Tell them that i miss them, but I just wanna get them down
Tell them that I’m wit em’, but I don’t ever stick around
Yeah, hoes come fast like the cash flow
Collect 200 I ain’t even pass go
I just bought a foreign, you could do the math hoe
Red bone riding shotgun countin’ cash yup
That’s all me, I’m swerving on these hoe’s till i’m on e (till I’m on e)
I got a bunch of bad bitches put em’ on d
I promise I ain’t fucking with chu and thats on me

I know you want me back, I ain’t trusting you (oh yeah)
Were you mad that I busted you (oh yeah)
Had a nigga on the side, hope you really down to ride
Cuz I don’t wanna fuck with you

I don’t wanna fuck with you x2

Had a nigga on the side, hope you really down to ride
Cuz I don’t wanna fuck with you

[Verse: 2]
Girl I don’t fuck with you, I just dropped the top on that brand new coupe
You had a nigga on the side, I hope you really down to ride
Cuz I’m laughing to the bank, and he don’t even drive, ye
I’m smoking on this swisher, i don’t miss ya
Creppin’ through my insta linking all my newest pictures, ye
That’s that shit that I don’t like, you trippin’ like you smoking on a dope pipe
I got 99 problems but the cash ain't one, I got 99 baddies and yo ass ain't one
How you feel right now?
Cuz I’m the man in this bitch, you ain't shit right now, uh
That’s all me, I’m swerving on these hoe’s till i’m on e (till I’m on e)
I got a bunch of bad bitches put em’ on d
I promise I ain’t fucking with chu and thats on me

I know you want me back, I ain’t trusting you (oh yeah)
Were you mad that I busted you (oh yeah)
Had a nigga on the side, hope you really down to ride
Cuz I don’t wanna fuck with you

I don’t wanna fuck with you x2

Had a nigga on the side, hope you really down to ride
Cuz I don’t wanna fuck with you

I don’t wanna fuck with you x5

I know you want me back, I ain’t trusting you (oh yeah)
Were you mad that I busted you (oh yeah)
Had a nigga on the side, hope you really down to ride
Cuz I don’t wanna fuck with you

Had a nigga on the side, hope you really down to ride
Cuz I don’t wanna fuck with you
