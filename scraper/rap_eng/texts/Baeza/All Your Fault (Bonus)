[Chorus]
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"

[Verse 1]
I just remember the feeling, the feeling that can make a man want to kill himself
Make everything he believed in go out the door and never wanna reveal himself
That's why you never caught me cheating, I mean I partied on the weekends
But never thought about creeping and never let them intervene us
But you was out doing you, fuck you, fuck you
Bitch I did my part, I always stayed true
And fuck all your friends, 'cause I know they knew
And this is isn't what it look like well...
Bitch fuck your view

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
And now I'm fucked up
And I'm calling you
And I'm telling you
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
And now I'm fucked up
And I'm calling you
And I'm telling you
That I've been

[Chorus]
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Nooo, no, no
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault

[Verse 2]
Now I'm on the roll couple K's fasho
When I'm always getting blowed ain't that ever getting old
Popping bottles till the morning
Til it getting gone, fucking bitches getting money
Sipping purple, moving slow, no love for these hoes
Yeah, no love for these hoes
Weak days like the weekend opened eyes when I'm freaking
Making moves while you sleeping with him, now you feeling mistreated
Push me off the deep end, go ahead, go be with him
'Cause I'm good now, come back, but you wishing that you could now
I'm living good, I can take you out the hood now
I'm just hoping you can get it understood now

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
And now I'm fucked up
And I'm calling you
And I'm telling you
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
And now I'm fucked up
And I'm calling you
And I'm telling you
That I've been

[Chorus]
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Nooo, no, no
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault

[Bridge]
I bet you're wishing that you'd never played me
Play me like a fool (play me like a fool)

[Chorus]
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Ridin' around like fuck these hoes
Screaming out "I don't love these hoes"
Nooo, no, no
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault
