[Intro]
Ooh wee, Cierra
Take a sip with me, faded
Take a sip with me, faded
Take a sip with me, faded
Your lips on me now

[Verse 1]
I can see you now with your hands on me
Glass half full, but your cup empty
You can be my Jack, I can be your Brandy
What you know about that, know about that?
Clink clink, lemon drop to the floor
Ooh we slow wine, sipping Bordeaux
Take another sip, now we moving slow-mo
What you know about that, what you know about that?

[Pre-Chorus]
So intoxicated tonight
So let's get lost, get under the lights

[Chorus]
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
Bottoms up, bottoms up, know you're thirsty
Your lips on me, now we faded
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
One, two, body shocked when you kiss me
Your lips on me, now we faded
Yeah, faded, yeah, faded

[Verse 3]
Hold up, hand me your keys
So so drunk, drunk, sex on the beach
Feel it, warm it up like we down in Belize
What you know about that, know about that?
Stay on one, we be up all night
One more round, baby, I just might
One more round, baby, I just might
What you know about that, know about that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Because we so intoxicated tonight
So let's get lost, get under the lights

[Chorus]
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
Bottoms up, bottoms up, know you're thirsty
Your lips on me, now we faded
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
One, two, body shocked when you kiss me
Your lips on me, now we faded

[Bridge]
So faded, faded, so faded, faded
Your lips on me, now we faded

[BAEZA'S VERSE]

[Chorus]
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
Bottoms up, bottoms up, know you're thirsty
Your lips on me, now we faded
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
One, two, body shocked when you kiss me
Your lips on me (your lips on me), now we faded

[Outro]
Take a sip with me, faded
Take a sip with me, faded
Your lips on me, now we faded
