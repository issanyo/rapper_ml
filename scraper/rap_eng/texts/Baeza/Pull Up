[Hook: Rayven Justice]
We ain't got much time (no)
My girl gone be here in a minute (in a minute)
But I know what we gone what we gone do
Even if my bitch pull up (pull up)
I won't pull out
(I won't pull out)
Even if my bitch pull up (pull up)
I won't pull out
(I won't pull out)

[Verse 1: Rayven Justice]
Even if my bitch pull up
I know it sound ridiculous (I know it sound ridiculous)
It's feeling so good but it's 'bout to get serious ('bout to get serious)
I think I'm losing my mind (my mind)
I'm so caught up in your vibe (your vibe)
While I hit it from behind
My bitch 'bout to be tripping

[Hook]
We ain't got much time (no)
My girl gone be here in a minute (in a minute)

I won't pull out
(I won't pull out)

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
What you know about?
My pics or holding hands when we going out
I got bands I'mma throw 'em out
You see my hair getting long I'mma grow 'em out
Let me switch it up
I can never ever let the rumours get to us
And them bitches their conversations can't get to us
Cause if it get back to my girl bet her feelings get crushed
Gotta put they phone down when their dealing with us
Gotta leave them coons alone theres a million of them
But I can't blame y'all if I wasn't me I would copy
She anxious to get it popping
But Franklin is in my wallet, come on

[Hook]
We ain't got much time (Let's get it)
My girl gone be here in a minute (in a minute)
But I know what we gone what we gone do
Even if my bitch pull up (pull up)
I won't pull out
(I won't pull out)
Even if my bitch pull up (pull up)
I won't pull out
(I won't pull out)

[Verse 3: Baeza]
When I'm in the bath with you
Make me wanna break the [?] with you
Up and down you go
Slide right down the pole
You know I can't leave ya alone
So why won't you come to my home?
My girl coming home soon
Damn girl, I'll better told you
You can come around like that
I fuck around and pipe your ass
You stretch your time and miss her calls
Your ass up, hands against the wall

[Hook]
We ain't got much time (no no)
My girl gone be here in a minute (in a minute)
But I know what we gone what we gone do (do yeah, do yeah)
Even if my bitch pull up (pull up)
I won't pull out
(I won't pull out)
Even if my bitch pull up (pull up)
I won't pull out
(I won't pull out)
