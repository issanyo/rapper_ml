(Verse 1)
It's 2 in the mornin'
Where you've been? Where you've been?
You told me yo were
With yo friends, with yo friends
My Nigga hit me with this

Explain yourself...

You'll be crying out for me
Cus I ain't got no time
For you bitches out here lying

You've been so selfish with yo time...yo time
And I think it's bout that time...that time

And it's clear you ain't type
So say goodbye to this...
Say good bye to this
And wait for Karma girl...

(Outro) x2
When I pull up with my new bitch
Don't you trip
Just know you're slippin'
When I pull up in that new whip
That's my shit
Look what you're missing
When I pull up with my new bitch
Don't you trip
Just know you're slippin'
When you girl see me with
A brand new chick
They gone see who winning
Yeah!
