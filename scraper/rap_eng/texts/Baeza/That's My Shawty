Pull up on ya
Be ready
I've been stressing shoulders feeling heavy

You can- you can go and turn the lights down
All up in my face girl
Show me what you working with girl
Yeah that hunny with the stick girl
You the shit girl
Woah
Love it when you go slow
Then you hang on like the rodeo
We hit the drough and rush to round two
You know I'm down if you down too
You should know I don't get tired
Working 9-5 baby you should get high
I'm looking at the view and I'm about to get high
While them niggas sittin' wonderin' what yo shit like
And I already got that get right
The last sucker didn't hit right
Boy you better get yo grip right

(Chorus:)
I pull up in my city

Fuck you riding you don't ever gotta lurk
On some late night shit

Fresh up off the plane
