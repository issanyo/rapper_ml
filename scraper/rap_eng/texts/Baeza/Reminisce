[Intro]
I feel like a young 2Pac or some shit, I don't know

[Verse]
Felt like yesterday
I was young and shy
Felt like yesterday
I was young and shy
Now i gotta pay taxes
And im getting high
Who woulda thought
I’d be this man today
Who woulda thought all of
My homies would be selling yay
I mean it don’t matter to
Me get it how you live
I'm doing my thing grindin for pay ask me
What my motive is
I dunno im livin This day for day
I gotta baby on the way
Mia i love you
I’ll kill for my blood
I’ll put no one above you
Promise i won’t leave
You like he did me
Nobody has the right
To kill another dream
Gotta little dough so
They think i’ve changed
Still the same player
If i pull up in a range
People love me
But only for my fame
Let me roll another up
So i can ease my pains

[Chorus]
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Smoke weed
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Get high
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Reminisce
And i Just, and i Just
Bout the days that i miss
And i Just

[Verse 2]
Lookin back i see
Mistakes that i made
But when you young it’s
All fun untill you have to pay
Momma let me take the
Time to say i love you
Pops let me tell you i
Appriciate your struggle
These words ain’t enough
I needa make it up
But i can never touch enough
Dedication take my compenation
Im forever loyal
Say it with no hesitation
Now i realize Just what i got
Stealin was cool untill i slipped and got
Caught
Posted on the east
Runnin through the streets
Got kicked out the crib
And started selling trees
Feelin like the world is against
Me me and my notepad
Lettin all this stress free
People love me now
But it's only for my fame
Let me roll another up
So i can ease up on my pain

[Chorus]
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Smoke weed
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Get high
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Reminisce
And i Just, and i Just
Bout the days that i miss
And i Just

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Smoke weed
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Get high
And i Just, and i Just, and i Just
Reminisce
And i Just, and i Just
Bout the days that i miss
And i Just
