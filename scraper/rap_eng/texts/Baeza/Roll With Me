Ft. Clyde Carson
(Intro)
55 Nina, all the way to the back

(Hook)
When I pull up on em 24's
All the bad bitches wanna roll
Wanna roll with me
Wanna roll with me

(Verse)
Uh, look, hottest nigga, I'm a city member
One they didn't wanna fuck with me
Yeah, now I'm on a thang, sittin' so pretty
Bad bitches with the waist,  itty biddy and them big titties
Uh, they wanna roll with me
Kick back, smoke dro, get blown with me
Count stacks, rock shows with me
They can try, but these hoes, they controllin' me
No no, I'm a playa, if I'm bout one thang, then I'm bout that paper
I see you boys upset cuz I ball like a playa
Ride through the cuss when I'm blowin' on these vapors
I ain't worried bout nothin', boy
Ha

(Hook)
When I pull up on em 24's
All the bad bitches wanna roll
Wanna roll with me
Wanna roll with me

(Verse 2)
Muscle cars and foreign I got a couple you could choose from
Show stop every time I put my jewels on
Blowin' chops out the window when on cruise control
28, 26's, 22s unfold
Marijuana in the ashtray
Chronic smoke, 91 up in the gas tank
Now a joke, but we laugh and play tennis
Fog in the coupe, clouds in the sky if I let down the roof
Neva seen myself workin' in the cubical
Paycheck to paycheck wasn't suitable
I had to get my ass out and hustle, that's what you should do
Bad bitches and some drank, yeah we do the full... course

(Hook)
When I pull up on em 24's
All the bad bitches wanna roll
Wanna roll with me
Wanna roll with me

(Verse 3)
Got a lil money but I swear I neva change
Still the same playa if I pull up in a Range
Smokin' on that West Coast, hoppin' out them thangs
I had a bad bitch before I had the fame, real shit all day
I'm posted with the clique, yup, she wanna post it on this dick
Yup, girl, if you broke, you betta quit
Yup, I ain't yo man, girl, I'm the shit, yup
Drop money, get it back, you savin' up, I figured that
Uh, so lil momma, I'mma get it back
She said I'm 24s where the business at
Ha, B-ae

(Hook)
When I pull up on em 24's
All the bad bitches wanna roll
Wanna roll with me
Wanna roll with me
