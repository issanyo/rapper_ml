[Intro]
You know what it is
B.A.E.Z.A
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeahee yeah. Oooh
Yeeeeah, yeeeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeahee yeah. Oooh
Yeeeeah, yeeeah

[Verse 1]
What you wanna do?
I got time and pleasure
Spend it all on you
And you'll love my drive
Got you feeling like a flight for two
And you feelin' high
Cause a nigga know what to do
Ha, lemme bite yo' lip
Lemme kiss yo' neck
Lemme grab yo' hips girl
Yo' body's tight
And that mood is right
Think you know what we about to do tonight, uh

[Chorus]
Put-Put-Put it down on you
Take yo' panties off so I can see that view
I'mma do you right
I'mma eat that too
And I swear girl I'mma have you feeling brand new
When I do the things I do
When I get on top of you
I'mma test yo' vocals up and I'mma have you singing "Oooh!"
When I do the things I do
When I get on top of you
I'mma test yo' vocals up and I'mma have you singing "Oooh!"
Girl, you know it's nothin'
Baby girl I ain't fronting
I can tell you really want it
So why don't you get up on it, on it
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide

[Verse 2]
Baby stop playin'
I hit it where you layin'
And you ain't had it like this, ha!
I'm just saying
And once you get me started
I promise I ain't stoppin'
Until you tap out baby, cause you ain't got an option
Eat you like a toppin'
And then I do you like my beats
I keep that shit knockin'
I get it on and poppin'
I keep that thang rockin'
I've had enough talking...
Lay back and just watch me. Ha!

[Chorus]
Put-Put-Put it down on you
Take yo' panties off so I can see that view
I'mma do you right
I'mma eat that too
And I swear girl I'mma have you feeling brand new
When I do the things I do
When I get on top of you
I'mma test yo' vocals up and I'mma have you singing "Oooh!"
When I do the things I do
When I get on top of you
I'mma test yo' vocals up and I'mma have you singing "Oooh!"
Girl, you know it's nothin'
Baby girl I ain't fronting
I can tell you really want it
So why don't you get up on it, on it
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide
Yeeeah!
You know its nothin'
Baby girl I ain't fronting
I can tell you really want it
So why don't you get up on it, on it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide
You can ride, then slip and slide
Yeah, yeah!
