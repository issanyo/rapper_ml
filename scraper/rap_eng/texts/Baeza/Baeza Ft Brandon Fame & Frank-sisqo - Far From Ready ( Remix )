[Verse 1: Brandon Fame]

I wanna apologize for everything I did wrong
I know we didn't last long but I know your the one
You repeatedly tell me that we ain't nothin that we done
If you say you hate me I'll understand where you coming from
I know I messed up with all this partying but I wasn't thinking about how you would react
But tell me is there any way that you would take me back
My friends all say to quit stressing over you that theirs more girls
But I wouldn't imagine being with anyone else in this world
So I'm guessin'

[Hook: Baeza]
I wasn't ready x3
So far from ready
Far from ready x2
Baby
Baby let me x3
Tell you that I'm sorry
I wasn't thinking about you, you're right
Going out, partying all night
It was wrong but it felt so right
But it ain't worth this crying

[Verse 2: Brandon Fame]

Seems like yesterday we were just together
But in reality I haven't seen you in forever
If its so easy to switch from heart broken to in love wheres the lever
Do you still wanna be with me or stay with him tell me what you rather, do
After everything we had two simple words changed everything, "its through."
You made it look so easy to just throw everything away
I needa do something quick to get you back or our love will just fade
Not a day goes by that I don't think bout what we had but now I'm too late
So I'm guessin'

[Hook: Baeza]
I wasn't ready x3
So far from ready
Far from ready x2
Baby
Baby let me x3
Tell you that I'm sorry
I wasn't thinking about you, you're right
Going out, partying all night
It was wrong but it felt so right
But it ain't worth this crying

[Verse 2: Frank-Sisqo]

She said I fucked up the relationship & she ain't gonna come back
I'm sorry for everything, I'm in love with you now please believe that
I bet that you don't know how much you really meant to me
Everybody saw you as just another person but I saw you differently
Baby please face the fact that me & you were meant to be
& for you to just walk out the door, You'll leave me so lonely
Stay close to me girl we need to be in this together
If you come back to my arms, my life would be way better

[Hook: Baeza]
I wasn't ready x3
So far from ready
Far from ready x2
Baby
Baby let me x3
Tell you that I'm sorry
I wasn't thinking about you, you're right
Going out, partying all night
It was wrong but it felt so right
But it ain't worth this crying

[Outro : Baeza]
I'm so sorry
So sorry x2
Baby wooo wooo wooo
I wasn't thinking about you, you're right
Going out, partying all night
It was wrong but it felt so right
But it ain't worth this crying
