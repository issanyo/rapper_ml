[Intro:]
Baby Just Ba-Ba Baby Just
Baby Just Ba-Ba Baby Just
Baby Just Ba-Ba Baby Just
Baby Just Ba-Ba Baby Just

[Chorus:]
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going
I be goin' I be goin'

[Verse 1:]
Yeah we fight now, fuck later
She bring it back she a cold waiter
Ridin' waves I'm a cold sailor
No survey but she a poll taker
She call me papi chulo, from the back im hittin that culo
I can't run no E baby I'm eating it like menudo
Who know, how to please you like me?
Get, you grabbin' all on those sheets
Get, you scratching all up on me
Hit it G double-O d
In the backseat get you gasping
When I hit it from the back and I be trashin'
Clap clap, it be smacking
Oh you love this, so you make it bring it back
Then I go into your heart like a crash landing
Relax it, slow down, baby grind it
Don't rush, don't rush it, tonight baby we timeless
Relax it, slow down, baby grind it
Don't rush, don't rush it, tonight baby we timeless

[Chorus:]
Slow down, just slow down
Ride it, grind it
Baby just slow down, ride it
(let me do my thing)
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going, and I be going

[Verse 2:]
I told her leave that G-string
Ima' pull it to the side, put that ass in park
And Ima' put this dick in drive
Spread them legs apart, baby Ima' need em' open wide
I'm the best she ever had and I ain't ever lied
I'm a fool with it, know what to do with it
She said "I ain't your girl but I'll only let you hit it"
Put that thing on me baby, put that thing on me baby
Ima' call you up tomorrow so you can put that on me, maybe
Trace your body with my hands, you strip down
And then you dance for me, we roll play
And then you tell me you got plans for me
Uh, you hit that crazy love stands for me
Then we sweat it every time you put your hands on me

[Chorus:]
Slow down, just slow down
Ride it, just ride it
Baby just slow down, ride it
(let me do my thing)
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going, and I be going

[Bridge:]
I be pulling on your hair, you don't even care
I be pulling on your hair, you don't even care
I be in it from the back and you like it like that
I be in it from the back and you like it like that

[Chorus:]
Slow down, just slow down
Ride it, just ride it
Baby just slow down, ride it
(hold on, and let me do my thing)
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going, and I be going

[Outro:]
Slow down, just slow down
Ride it, just ride it
Baby just slow down, ride it
(hold on, and let me do my thing)
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going, and I be going
And I be going, and I be going
