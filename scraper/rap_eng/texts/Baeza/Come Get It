(Intro: Tue$day)
Come get it
C-come get it
Come get it
C-come get it

(Verse 1: Baeza)
Let me hit ya with the hurricane
Reminiscing bout that weekend
Sipping on this sluricane
Killed the pussy
Baby could've hit me with the murder case
But she know i might still dealin with my current case
She know how to speak my language
So i free her mind when a nigga get anguish
Young fly nigga and she love me cause I’m famous
Fuck her til the morning liquor got us faded
I tell her baby come get it
Go ahead and tell him that you done with him
You ain’t gotta lie, don’t front with him
I can tell you really don't fuck with him
Pull up to the spot
I ain’t frontin’ baby I’mma give you what I got
Work you like a shift and then forget about the clock
Lick it how you like it from the bottom to the top now stop

(Chorus Tue$day:) (x2)
Ooh babygirl come get it
Go ahead and tell him that you done with him
Cause you be in my text when you all alone
Only want the sex when you call my phone

(Verse 2 Tue$day:)
Look, I beat that up best believe that like grippies
I be up in bae like I’m suzy six speed
Nothing like these other hoes I’m dickin dodging
If you bring a stripper friend, Nicki we Minajing
Fuck another give her ‘less a nigga want a problem
Beat it like I’m Tyson sure to leave the pussy throbbing
At the supper club, I hit the west end
And I see my nigga Baeza had ya best friend
Come and get it, come and get it like the food ready
I tell her drop it on me slowly like it’s too heavy
You say you gotta be my main and not a side chick
Spit that game you fuck around and fuck my sidechick
Tue$day but everyday I’m on some fly shit
You with ya man, I bet you hop up out the ride quick
You know I be dipped when they see me
You call me so quick when you need D
Daily not weekly

(Chourus x2)

(Verse 3 Baeza & Tue$day:)
She gone let me pipe that
Fuck a mic check
Slide right in it from behind I know you like that
I only need her for the night, I’ll give her right back
Fuck her right and now she leaving with an icepack
Don’t want a skank tramp I’m tryna make a movie ho’
Then pass it to my homies like I’m Ricky Rubio
I get her singing we ain't even in the studio
It ain't a beauty it’s a mothafuckin booty though
You can hit me on a late night when he ain’t around you
Beat it like I’m Tyson, then we going round two
Do it like I’m supposed to
Kitchen or the sofa
Smoke break and we steady blowing on the doughja
That is your gang
When I go back bang bang
You gone say more than my name
And your nigga so lame
I said come and get a taste
You gone pull up in a range
You don’t say no to me but you tell him you can’t
So I say

(Chorus x2)
