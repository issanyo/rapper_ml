[Hook]
Who you know shining in these streets like a light mane
Who you know stay the same Sunday to Sunday
Who you know taking off on tracks like a runway
Who you know beat the odds even when they say he can’t

Who you know
Who you know
Who you know, ah (x4)

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Who you know that hop on tracks
And act like he done lost his mind
Who you know that love The Lord
And ain’t gone trip if you don’t like
Who you know that’s RMG but unashamed until he die
Who you know that talk bout God
And still out rap your trappest guy
Who do you know that could care less
About how much money you making
Cause that don’t impress him
Who do you know that know he ain’t supposed to be here
So tomorrow he counting his blessings
Who do you know that’s gone
Steer clear of people that stay in some drama
Cause they looking messy
Who do you know gone keep real in the message

Who you know (x4)

[Bridge]
People gone say that I’m crazy
I stepped out on my own, on a plane with no parachute
Turbulence it will not phase me
Float right over problems inside my hot air balloon
You know what I been on (know what I been on)
That ain’t gone change whether suburb or ghetto
Faith what I live on (faith what I live on)
Full speed ahead boy it’s pedal to metal now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I hear a whole lot of talking. Sit back and listen
Why you make so many assumptions (so many assumptions)
Soon as they hear that you Christian
Like bet that he all about money
I bet he only rock gators and suits on a Sunday
I bet that he think that he perfect
I don’t see nothing but hypocrites all in them churches
Yall lying. Holla at Canon. You’ll see that he is who he say he is
Tone or Chad Jones
You gone see fathers that’s off in they home and they living it
Deraj and B Coop, bout dat life
Lecrae 116 bout dat life
You think this way more than music, hwah, you guessed it you right
I wrote this for every person, know that we not perfect
But through Jesus purchase, we gone keep on working
Fakin we allergic, on our grind till the wheels, wheels, wheels fall off (till the wheels fall off)
Its all about Jesus. He got a people that He been redeeming
The world is so tired of the fake so they look for the real they ask you these questions like

[Hook]
