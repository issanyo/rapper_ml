[Verse 1: Tony Tillman]
No more going in circles we know His way at last
And we ain't straying He gave us power to stay the path
And we don't sleep on His teachings we stay awake in class
And find faithful men to break bread like its made of glass
We wake up early and crash late
In the word seeking Jesus with the mad face
Exhorting brothas live ya life like its your last day
In worship being taught the same things like sum classmates

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Gimme a fork, I'm at the Lordâ€™s table with my kin
I need a bib, I'm so sloppy when I get it in
We on that soul food, help us loose the taste for sin
Gave me the itis, got me sleeping on haters again
You say you hungry, I'm telling you come eat
Give me some of your portion, you know that I'm greedy
And I'mma give you mine, nourish the body
Break bread, let's finish the plate, communally

[Hook: ALL]
I'm sitting at the Lord's table tryna break bread
What you holding on, better break bread
We eating over here, get a chair you can break bread
Aye what you got over there, I'm coming over trying break bread
Break bread [16x]

[Verse 3: Canon]
Many have one gift or got a talent to give to papa
Better worship him and edify your sister and your brosha
The spirit gave birth to your talent kinda like a masha
They ask use these gifts for the devil I tell them nada
Now And Our  Talents did we get it from the spirit, then why
Do we Act selfish to those who helpless we sit by
Black ow blow black ow
Come to my house, with a big cow and
Come and sit down, come and get down
Serve it all and give 'em all your best now

[Verse 4: Chad Jones]
Ok that bread ain't yours did you earn whatcha holdin on
It's the baker whose the maker
We should take and put our focus on
The savior said to take the oats and quake 'em microwave 'em bro
Oatmeal beat no meal the Spirit got you so filled
Cheers to life Ted Danson, we work as family Hanson
Or Jacksons, our talents, It's all for one put hands in
If i got it, you got it, By Gods grace you profit
If you offer me nada, Hakuna Matata

[Hook: ALL]
I'm sitting at the Lord's table tryna break bread
What you holding on, better break bread
We eating over here, get a chair you can break bread
Aye what you got over there, I'm coming over trying break bread
Break bread [16x]

[Verse 5: Tony Tillman]
We wrestle through the darkness with people until the day come
We take the truth and shoot it strait like a ray gun
And we strive to be diverse in our communities
All these colors got us looking like a box of crayons
In one faith and baptism we sharing them
With one God who's high and flier than seraphims
So we sit at the table of the Lord God
Breaking bread looking like a bunch of vegetarians

[Hook: ALL]
I'm sitting at the Lord's table tryna break bread
What you holding on, better break bread
We eating over here, get a chair you can break bread
Aye what you got over there, I'm coming over trying break bread
Break bread [16x]
