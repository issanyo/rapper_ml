I've always felt like my life was a maze, full of dark nights and delays
Somebody hit the lights now let me display my life from the stage
Boy this is life from a grave, raised up from trifling ways


From a town when beef is high don't speak cause them rifles will wave
Most of my patnas don't rap, they're clapped or spend nights in a cage
Where i'm from youngins don't scrap they strapped and they're liable to spray
Words of OG's is like the bible, idols rolling in regals
I know at least twelve disciples on sight who's never met Jesus
Bloods and crips on a power trip, fighting over whose block is this
Mamas on their knees praying asking God if He's watching this
It's common to be fatherless, heroes far from metropolis
They got two middle fingers up, thugging like tupacalyps
I grew up, hitting licks like a new stamp
Run up on that new truck, get you for that new amp. Come up off them eighteens, run them junks like bootcamp it's drama, when stomachs rumble and mama ain't got no foodstamps
I wasn't raised on caillou, just neighborhood crip and piru
Whole family from the hood, violate their laws and they'll try you
Youngin told me "Christians don't know disfunction" well i do
My daddy's alcoholic my older sister gets high too. Cause life can get depressing, it'll drive you crazy
Homies drop out of school get GEDs and join the Navy. Or they get locked up when they 20, and parole in eighty
Or they get zipped up while they mama scream they killed my baby
This is for every kid from my city to yours who live in a duplex
In hand-me-downs admiring trappers wrapped in a new lex
Im trying to be your light through this darkness i've been where you at that's why i keep my ear to the streets it's like i've been suplexed
Ain't caught up in no rap politics i rather let you flex
Hear Camden in my speech, I could give 2 bleeps about who's next. Or who's best in your top five, i'm Tony they say who that
Ex-crip from Camden hoping you hear what i say and shoot less
This testimony serves and my treasure from deep within, pour my soul out through this pin, hope to reach you where ever you at
So here's my story how God delivered me from that blue set
I'm broken like the rest, God is beauty i'm just His cute mess
Camden
