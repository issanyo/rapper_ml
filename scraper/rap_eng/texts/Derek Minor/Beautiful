[Hook – PK]
Something like my Maker, I say you the best
I know you can’t see it all by yourself
But you are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
‘Cause God ain’t made you like anybody else
Don’t let nobody tell you that you anything less
‘Cause you are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, yeah

She check out her reflection in the mirror
But some reason, she don’t see that beauty is in the picture
Thinking her image flawed ‘cause he ain’t made her like these models
Or her figure’s a mistake, he only making Coke bottles
Naw, Coke bottles are plastic
Mannequins are plastic but you are fantastic
She don’t believe it so it’s driving her insane
This diet don’t seem to work, she eating to ease the pain
The world tell her that somehow she doesn’t matter
Besides, the perfect girls live happily ever after
No idea she been crafted by the Master
Uniquely in his image baby, that is no disaster

[Hook]

She begging for a hero, but villains is all she see though
Thinks she’s less than other people, she is a size zero
Her ribs touching, not ‘cause of a lack of food
But after every meal, she heads to the bathroom
Stick her finger down her throat, thinking that will give her hope
If her weight will never grow, maybe they will love her more
On a journey to acceptance ‘cause she ain’t been there before
She ain’t perfect, and commercials do their best to let her know
But if she only knew who she was in God’s view
Made his children with a purpose, girl and that includes you
Let this statement give you comfort boo, ‘cause that includes truth
God is in love with you, you ain’t gotta look far for proof

[Hook]


I wrote this for you, this is your song
You his baby doll, I know I ain’t wrong
Beauty’s from the Creator, and it ain’t measured in weight
You are great just how you are, I don’t care what that TV say
Your DNA is complete, his artistry’s in your genes
That don’t make him less creative ‘cause you don’t fit in them jeans
You ain’t got a clue the way he see you
This planet is his canvas, and you his Mona Lisa …
