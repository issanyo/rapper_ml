See I grew up like "screw the world, " it's me against it
And if it's life after death, then I don't wanna live it
So confused man, 2Pac he discipled me, Biggie he made me classy
In a fatherless household, hip-hop became my pappy
The rage grew inside of me, I hated my daddy
But when I seen him in the summer I can't front, it made me happy
Thank the Lord for my momma, did the best that she can
But ain't no way a woman could ever show a man to be a man
Raised two kids on her own, with a small amount of cash
But it really got bad when she married my stepdad
'Cause he put poison in his body, fiendin' for that white
Got his check, hit the block, couple weeks, he outta sight
Couldn't trust him 'cause he was always tryna get me beat
Said if he did it one more time I swear I'd kill him in his sleep
But even though the pain made it hurt to grow
I love you to this day, I forgive you and want you to know
Can't nobody take your place
And even though you make mistakes
I pray the Lord'll give you grace 'cause I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know you
Your son who took the pain away
I hope one day you'll feel the same
But even if you never change I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know you
Before I was married, me and my wife got into it real bad
Called my momma's house, and guess who picked up? My stepdad
I was cursing up a storm, he'd just listen and laugh
Said if you love I need to turn around and try to have a dad
And right then, something in my heart began to crack
He had never dealt with me any way like Daddy
Didn't come to the wedding, but for some reason I wasn't mad
Had to realize the frailty of him and my dad
Then it really got real when he fell into that coma
Died a couple weeks later, couldn't hug him if I wanna
And when I saw him in that casket, couldn't stop myself from crying
Look how petty we can be, had to've wasted a lot of time
Instead of loving like Christ, I would hate like a fool
'Cause true love go beyond the way that people treat you
See even though the pain made it hurt to grow
I love you to this day, I forgive you and want you to know
Can't nobody take your place
And even though you make mistakes
I pray the Lord'll give you grace 'cause I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know you
Your son who took the pain away
I hope one day you'll feel the same
But even if you never change I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know you
I wish that I could take back every time I said in my heart "I wish you was dead"
And wrap my arms around your neck and told you "I love you" instead
That's what Christ did for us, we were enemies at one time
Then he indwelled me with the Spirit for the renewing of my mind
See I deserved the cross, shoulda been me that was scourged
But the Father called us up to my place with his son
Washed me in the blood of his perfect sacrifice
And though I shoulda ate death, I was fed the bread of life
So a Christian means that we supposed to look like God
Then the debt I owe him is more than you could ever charge
But the truth
I should be dead off principle
But the gospel is that we are to forgive the unforgivable
Bless the despicable, we are all fallen men
They were used by the Lord to put my faith in his hand
So even though the pain made it hurt to grow
I love you to this day, I forgive you and want you to know
Can't nobody take your place
And even though you make mistakes
I pray the Lord'll give you grace 'cause I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know you
Your son who took the pain away
I hope one day you'll feel the same
But even if you never change I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
I just wanna know you
I just wanna know you
