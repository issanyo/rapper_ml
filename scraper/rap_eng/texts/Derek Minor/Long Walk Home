[Hook: Jayme Pearl]
Storms will come
But after the rain comes the sun
You’ll survive
Just stick to it you’ll be fine
I know you can make it if you try
You can make it if you try

[Verse 1: Chad Jones]
No career, job waiting tables
Every day a step further from her graduation
Dag, been working her hardest
This mediocre money wasn’t promised after college
Competition too crazy, the job market crowded
Overqualified and they ain’t paying for your doctorate
She settles. Scared the dream is gon’ remain a dream
Momma’s basement is the only place to lay her head and sleep
Many nameless faces got the same story she do
Embrace it while you’re winning
Don’t be finished at the prelude
It’s a long walk home after heroes climb mountains
We thirsting for the wind and at the end find fountains

[Hook]
Storms will come
But after the rain comes the sun
You’ll survive
Just stick to it you’ll be fine
I know you can make it if you try
You can make it if you try

[Verse 2: Chad Jones]
I keep fighting, chronic urges not to blow the loud
Purple clouds, pain simmers down when I leave the ground
I ain’t on trial, don’t judge what I done let go
Sometimes I shut down and go into reset mode
I’m safe, man I’m feeling like I stole something
I could be on base, I know I’m owed nothing
Pain over being numb it helped me know I need the love
That the only thing that’s stopping me from ever keeping on
And racing while you living, keep watching ‘til it climax
The bigger picture is here, got tickets for the IMAX
A long walk home after heroes climb mountains
And yeah I know we coming back but I stress despite the outcome
In the meantime, in between time
Yo the enemy is telling me it’s disbelieve time
But I’m deaf to all of that, I’m Beethoven when I rap
And this symphony inside my mind is telling me to…

[Hook]
Storms will come
But after the rain comes the sun
You’ll survive
Just stick to it you’ll be fine
I know you can make it if you try
You can make it if you try

[Outro] [4x]
You can make it if you try
