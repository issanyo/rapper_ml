Now when I'm done I know a lot a y'all will say that I'm a hater
But y'all treat the Holy Spirit like Magic, Lakers
If the pastor to Kamehameha ya and you fall on the ground
If you ain't living like Christ, what's the point of jumpin' 'round?
I think we need to see clear about the power that was given
Not a genie in a bottle for you to have better livin'
He's a untamed lion sent to make you go harder
In Acts, he took 12 cowards turned most of 'em into martyrs
Being Christian wasn't cliche, like it is today
It was death on the cross or being burned at the stake
Now please, don't get me wrong I believe that we can prosper
But turning God to your butler to me is not proper
Peter was crucified, John was boiled alive (and he survived)
And they knew Christ in the flesh and was a spared by God
See what I'm getting at, some of you cats are liars
He ain't power to be comfortable, but power to expire
Now when the fight gets realer with the man in the mirror
We got
Power to die
He gave us
Power to die
No this is not suicide, but I'm willing to give my life
We got
Power to die
He gave us
Power to die
I yell His name on the earth till they put me in the dirt
We got
Power to die
He gave us
Power to die
So if it mean I don't survive to see His glory on high
We got
Power to die
He gave us
Power to die
Ay it's crazy how we live like we still slaves
Like Jesus never came
Like God is never pleased
And we forever chained
But maybe we ain't condemned for Him we give up everythang
Every desire and breath in us just to let Him reign
Submitting to the will of His Spirit and not for better thangs
But we die to gain new life from a God Who never change
Peep the new covenant relationship we can now exchange
"A Sunday Kind of Love"... Call it the Etta James
Love beyond the weekend, trust to the last Scripture
We rise before Easter and follow 'em past Christmas
We wrestle with bad habits, break 'em like glass fixtures
Pick up our cross and walk till our shoulder blades have blisters
We got power dawg, we can do it all through Christ
Focus on the sacrifice, you can't afford to lose sight
Continue to follow right, pursue it with all your might
And deny yourself, you call it death, we call it new life!
Pick up your cross and stand
Flat footed on the Word no matter how life turns
To equate your life with worth without the Lord is absurd, sir
Sin will try to put you in a "backyard fight"
But the Spirit God'll right like, Kimbo Slice
Uppercut like Tyson roundhouse like Van Dam
One inch punch like Bruce Lee, resourceful like Jackie Chan
So what you gettin' whooped for
I suggest you scrap folk
Then one day we will be glorified- that's a fact bro
But till He come back to overcome evil for good
We must kill our sin nature everyday, understood
By fasting you deny yourself and bring it to submission
Prayer reminds you Who the captain is
Humbling to His mission
Read the Scriptures, they reveal God and His purpose
What's the point having a weapon if ya don't know how to work it
There's strength in unity so fight with a community
These tools the Spirit use to help you die to you and me
