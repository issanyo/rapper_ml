[Hook: Tiffany Michelle]
When I look around there’s an echo
Way past scared, need a place I can let go
Oh I need a friend, that’ll love me through the mess
Oh what you need
Need somebody, want somebody, got somebody
To love me, love me, love me, love me

[Verse 1: Canon]
Now this type of love I've been Is getting is so rare
Last time I checked everybody was hated down here
My perspectives of love wasn't the love He shared
How you care people who don't reciprocate care
I said truth dare promise to repeat or double dare
I said I dare you to love if me if its true He said yeah
Rolling with four tires to Hell, didn't care
But when they ran out, I was the only one He spared
The way I was feeling so bonkers
Saw the train of His robe was greater than any Tonka
I felt like only through Him it's nothing I couldn't conquer
Blown away by the gift that's temporarily offered
I was problem, and He was good with mathematics
Cause He subtracted my sins and mercy was then added
He tore down the division and multiplied massively
Eatin' pie to glory
Now Calculate His majesty
I'm so glad to see

[Hook: Tiffany Michelle]
When I look around there’s an echo
Way past scared, need a place I can let go
Oh I need a friend, that’ll love me through the mess
Oh what you need
Need somebody, want somebody, got somebody
To love me, love me, love me, love me

[Verse 2: Tony Tillman]
Well ok, the Father's love is rich
Got us asking what type of love is this
That He would love us with
When everybody else’s love would quit
It's counterfeited but His love's legit
It's like His love was script
Scribbled in truth forever no better love known
We all look for somebody that we can love on
But I've been drawn with loving kindness He tugs strong
The Savior's love atones call it the love song
It may be shocking like Electro
No matter what becomes He promised to never let go, heck no
I’m, forever in the Son like Fresno
Burning with true desire you can call it the Petro
His faithfulness is displayed call it the expo
His xo's got me in a trance like some techno
I found a place where I can rest
In a God who's in love with us and covers us in grace
That's His dress code

[Hook: Tiffany Michelle]
When I look around there’s an echo
Way past scared, need a place I can let go
Oh I need a friend, that’ll love me through the mess
Oh what you need
Need somebody, want somebody, got somebody
To love me, love me, love me, love me

[Verse 3: Chad Jones]
Please don't be embarrassed by your failures and the errors
You got me, an example of a man been given chances
The Cross should be a good reason, shows you running is foolish
Jesus saved you while filthy, and left Heaven to do it
Now we, wait in line for some J's on Saturday
Cop 'em brand new, so we could be braggin' mayne
But would you drop a bill-fifty for some muddy Spaulding's?
Of course not! But you were in the pig slop crawling!

[Verse 4: Derek Minor]
You say that you love me
At shows you take pictures hug me
I ain't crazy, just cause you follow my Twitter feed
That don't mean that you're feeling me unconditionally
If you seen my thoughts, would you still look over my faults?
I don't think so
But my Father, He sent His son to bleed though
And He love me, in spite of the fact I'm weak folk

[Hook: Tiffany Michelle]
When I look around there’s an echo

Oh what you need

To love me, love me, love me, love me
