[Pre-Chorus]
I can only be me, I don't fit in
That's Steph Curry from the 3 point for the win
Reflect God, reflect greatness that's the movement
And I stay real and I stay true

[Chorus] (x2)
You know, know, know, know, know, know, know it (x2)
I can only be me, I can only be me (x2)

[Verse 1]
You be in jeopardy tryna fit me in a category (yeah)
I mean I hate boxes that's a common fact if you know me
Bounce through my life like its Safari looking for old news
The history's deleted like I'm looking at things I ain't supposed to
The old me is gone I buried it next to the beats that I murdered
You want the same thing yes I would urge it
I don't concur with ideas opposite of my purpose (nah)
And you shouldn't either (uh uh)
Time to be you now (time to be you)
They said we would fail now they eating them words like its alphabet soup now
Enjoy it

[Pre-Chorus]
I can only be me, I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
That's Steph Curry from the 3 point for the win (swish)
Reflect God, reflect greatness that's the movement (whoo!)
And I stay real and I stay true

[Chorus] (x2)
You know, know, know, know, know, know, know it (x2)
I can only be me, I can only be me (x2)

[Verse 2]
I want you to win (I want you to win)
I want you to raise up the trophy
I want to lock arms with all of my dogs
Don't want to see no one below me
I want to see you be the person you meant to be
I want you to see your potential
Regardless if they all dismiss you
Even when you feel the planet's against you
Just remember who made it
Remember who hung every star in the sky
Like (?) got it don't you worry 'bout another comment
Even when they try to shoot you down like comets
Honestly, time to be you now
And if you live being who you meant to be that's a taste success now
Enjoy it

[Pre-Chorus]
I can only be me, I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
That's Steph Curry from the 3 point for the win (swish)
Reflect God, reflect greatness that's the movement (whoo!)
And I stay real and I stay true

[Chorus] (x2)
You know, know, know, know, know, know, know it (x2)
I can only be me, I can only be me (x2)

[Verse 3]
This is when you realize what you're looking at is really quite rare
I don't gotta brag on my accomplishments cause my wiki page is over there
I rather talk about Christ blood
Still here when the hype is done
And if I ever crossover know I'm tryna revolutionize it like Iverson (ugh)
I heard a lot of people say some things about these years
I've been an outcast with 3000 problems but I'm big-boying these fears
They wanna try to pull me in the game, turn me to pawn I can't believe it
But I never trust a blind referee cause he will only call it like he see it
Listen, you got a purpose
Hold it tighter than a python at all costs
Cause there's a lot of snakes that will crush your dreams until the life's gone
One of a kind, don't ever despise the person that you're made to be
Cause you can only be you and I can only be me
