[Intro]
Whoaaa

[Verse 1: Canon]
Ball game, I'm Sammy Sosa with the work that's a home run
SAFE! You know we acting up, matter a fact, we jack & beat em to a pulp with they own drums
I'm might just over do it, bring the AK40 Canon busting I go dumb
Comin' in with it with the snare and the high hats
I'm crashing the party with 4 nuns
Take a skillet and fry an egg on these artists
They scrambling to hide from us
I might just over do it with dances hitting high notes Chris Brown-ing on 'em
I wonder how the 808 a sound up on em
Whenever coming up with the rhythm I'm a wild up on em
If God gave me the gift to shine brighter then sorry to all you haters in the game cuz styling on you
Touchdown open wide at the gates
I'm coming breaking records get the crates

[Break]
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Stand up over there
It's okay, right there
Cause I don't stand with the snakes

[Verse 1 Continued]
Again and Again
And even Derek thought he got me when sending over this heater and oh believing that he had a win
That's Foolish!
Whenever coming on the track the killer canon I'm coming to put the bullets in em, get the funeral, If you don't know you better ask somebody when I come with squad getting ignat for no reason, Boy I might over do it over I might over bruise em make it hard for you to breath

[Chorus]
Just know when you step in this mi Casa
They say that I'm too extra my problem
Word up on the street is that you knew this
They look at me, Oh no oh I knew it
He might over do it, over do it, over do it
Over do it, over do it, over do it
Over do it, over do it, over do it
Over do it, over do it, over do it

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
I just mixed a red bull with a 5 hour
If the bass is not distorted, turn my music louder
At the front row of my show, then you gone need a shower
Cause the turn up prolly last till they cut the power
Lately, I been spazzing
Every single beat, if you can't see, here's some Visine
Try me, Please try me I might overdue it
Well done, till he say well done, overdue it
I'm a pull up, like I'm finna do a drive by, likes its 99
Like its boys in the hood When they shot Ricky bye bye
Oh my, I blend these styles like tie dye
Every hater, they get high fives
Reflect greatness, that's why I shine
Canon RMG, that's my guy
You can't stop us tell me why try

[Chorus]
Just know when you step in this mi Casa
They say that I'm too extra my problem
Word up on the street is that you knew this
They look at me, Oh no oh I knew it
He might over do it, over do it, over do it
Over do it, over do it, over do it
Over do it, over do it, over do it
Over do it, over do it, over do it
