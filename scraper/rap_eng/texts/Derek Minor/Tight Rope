[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Now, let me tell you my story this evening
And try to say it to you all without sounding conceited
I feed my family with these thoughts I write in these pages
And people finally know the words when I step on these stages
These accolades make me feel like the one
Who am I kidding? I'm reflecting the Son, but that's the tension
It seem like the higher up that you go, you forget what lift you up off the floor
The air is thin up here
All this sun's reflection
It feel like so much pressure
One step, wrong direction
Everything comes down, down, down
Yeah, you do love all my verses
Sometimes these gifts are just curses
And no, I'm not perfect
But neither are you, neither are you

[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
How much it cost for me to follow You and still have it all?
I want it all
I can't afford to miss another step 'cause I might just fall
No I can't fall

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Tight rope
Don't look down
Don't look down
Aye, don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Aye, don't look down
Tight rope

[Bridge: Roz]
High above the stars, the sky
Touch the moon, the clouds, and I
Can't come down, not if I try
Up above, so high, so high
Fight the feeling of the fall
To and by, we're stuck to crawl
And I bet you feel it, too
Gravity wants us to lose, oh

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Man, who we all on the surface?
Walking a thin line tryna get to our purpose
Way on top of the mount, where we all wanna live
But the higher up that you go, the colder it get
How you define success? What is life about?
What you chased in the past, would you chase it now?
Money, power, respect really key to the locks?
I learned one thing in this life, you either free or you not

[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
Message:
How much it cost for me to follow You and still have it all?
I want it all
Fact:
I can't afford to miss another step 'cause I might just fall
No I can't fall

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Tight rope
Don't look down
Don't look down
Aye, don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Aye, don't look down
Tight rope
