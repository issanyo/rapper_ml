They tell us that we savages 'cause where them hard, not classes is
Dudes will leave you in bandages
It's only one rule where the cashless live
Survive or reside where them caskets is
Yeah, they roll they problems in swishers and blow 'em in the sky
Born in hell but hoping that they can get high and rise
Tired of steppin' over crack fiends
Rather deal it to smoke it, he got crack dreams
They broke it so drug dealing is his only hoping
And ain't no doctors and lawyers living out where he posted
When he see doctors and lawyers, his yellow liquor pourin'
On the curb 'cause his homie got his head exploded
And as I sit on this stage
And the drummer play these symbols and thangs
Somebody round the corner on a mission trying to get him some change
Hoping he can pay for a change, for real...
I wish that things was different...
And we was really livin'...
It must be something missin'...
'Cause yesterday I felt that this can't be life
Today it seem we only getting by
See I remember when me and Tommy was barreling down the country road
He smoking strong, I'm coming up with the sickest flows
At least to me they was, I'm like "you feel that, cause?"
He blew the smoke in my face so I could get a buzz
Fast forward, I'm rappin' and tryna get a buzz
Think if you knew who I was that would replace the love
That was gon' cause I rarely had a daddy home
And when I did it was different 'cause I wasn't his own
I bet you wanna be a rock star
Mix the white with the soda and get rock hard
But remember, while you tryna hit your quota
There's a kid at home losin' his parents to buy your new car
And as I sit on this stage
And the drummer play these symbols and thangs
Somebody round the corner on a mission trying to get him some change
Hoping he can pay for a change, for real...
I wish that things was different...
And we was really livin'...
It must be something missin'...
'Cause yesterday I felt that this can't be life
Today it seem we only getting by
Yes sir, hey I remember as a young buck
All I wanted outta life was dumb luck
Enough money that I could fill up a dump truck
And a whip that I could swing like nunchucks
But both of those came second to the females
Staring at they backsides, but I couldn't see well
Caught up in a chase, would holler for my sake
I guess knowing I can pull them would help me to feel safe
But them girls wasn't safe though
'Cause I was done when I had what I came for
It made me feel like I was livin', it ain't so
Wish I could go back and take away the pain, bro
Now as I sit on the stage
And 'em drummers play them symbols and thangs
Somebody round the corner on a mission trying to get him some change
Hoping they can pay for a change
I wish that things was different...
And we was really livin'...
It must be something missin'...
'Cause yesterday I felt that this can't be life
Today it seem we only getting by
