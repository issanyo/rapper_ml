I-I-I-I-I'm a full court mess if the Lord don't use me
Cause I'm a full court mess if the Lord don't use me
I'm a full court mess if the Lord don't use me
Running from my trials, thinking everything's groovy
I'm a full court mess if the Lord don't use me
Running from my trials, thinking everything's groovy

Y'all see the way that I am now
Love out for the king, I'mma stand now
Y'all don't know if it wasn't for the lamb now
Ain't no telling what I would be minus his hand now

When I gang bang, when I slang 'caine
Riding with a chopper when I change lanes
When I chase fame, full of hate mayne
Tryna get a couple ohs in my bank mayne
What I face mayne, what I break mayne
If I fall, tell me would I ever get up
I don't even know why the Lord forgive us
Look at this chance at life that he give us
Now I'm rappin' for him when I do perform
And I take the storm, while I'm waitin' for him
If I break for him, love of the spirit is in me
I let it be great for him

So unashamed, I take hate for him
Even if that mean that I can't even pay for him
You know I give everything for him
Some say that they down, but they ain't for him

I know there's nothing good inside me
My evil mind used to blind me
'Till the spirit came to unbind me
Now I'm like, use me or otherwise grind me

J-E-S-U-S that's all I gotta say to my final (breath)
K-B got OCD, I'm obsessing for Christ like something wrong with me
"Me, Me" and "I" can't breath
Homie "I" gotta die so that I can breath
Through the Christ In me
I proceed
Speaking about and preaching about the glory of the gospel/

Hold up A

With everything inside of me I gotta be anomaly
I gotta be really modeling what I'm saying audibly- grippen' the microphone I gotta give it to them mightily
Hold up A
Don't nobody wanna hear somebody who ain't living what the "spitting in the booth"(tongue roll)
Continually you know I gotta go and "put it in this dude"(tongue roll) oh my God to be used!
Plus I got disciples that making sure that I mean this they like
So what you got the crowd in all A's! Like the deans list
We've been seasoned, sing for a single reason
It's in my genes kid, I pen hymns like a seamstress
Was living loosely, until the Lord pursued me
Induced me, then He moved me to see- that gospel and it's beauty
(I could be) bleeding profusely but if He's in my viewing than He can use me up...truly
