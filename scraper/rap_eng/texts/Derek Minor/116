Now lemme hear you say
One one six!
Everybody say

Everybody say
One one six!
Now tell 'em I'm unashamed! (I'm unashamed!!)
I'm unashamed! (I'm unashamed!)

[Verse 1 - Derek Minor]
Now who I be? "P-R-O!"
But it don't matter who I is, I tell you who I rep for
It be that K-I-N-G O-F K-I-N-G oh yes
I'mma put it down for the cross anytime I get a microphone
Guarantee to put my flesh in a catacomb
Hit 'em wit' a little bit of truth, little bit of proof
Little bitty dudes wanna say the Lord don't exist
I'mma hit 'em with the fire, let 'em know that they alive
Help 'em see God created this
Back on another track
Saved from the world ain't no way I'm turnin' back
Free indeed as a matter of fact
My life for the King you can run and tell that
Homeboy, at the throne boy
You know what I'm on, boy
Too real, this is no toy
Rep God, I have no choice
But I don't want one either, can't you see the King is cleanin' me?
I gotta backpack fulla tracks and I keep a Johnny Mac
Better yet a ESV
Oh you ain't feelin' me? I'm cool, don't need your accolades
You can keep the fortune [and] fame
That's just your misfortune man
Not because I'm tight or wack, the Lord the only one that's great
Through Him now I have been saved
For Him I am unashamed

[Verse 2 - KB]
My boasting's in the Savior homie, normally I don't showboat
But I do cruise on His Lordship, so welcome to the boat show
Lemme get that
I'ma be up in it for a little minute finna ROCK THIS THANG
They be wantin' me to stop
But they gotta deal with it dirty I am NOT ASHAMED
And we spread His fame
Spot to spot drop the plot of God
Front of the gun, 100 to 1
If I'm under the sun it's gospel mayne
This is how the show goes, for those of you who don't know
Perfectly purchased me purposely purging me
Gotta be, gotta be Jesus
By the power of the Lord man my homies hit the street block
Like I don't care about a wristwatch, they leave a G shocked
This is real, got a brother in Indonesia
Where their persecutors bear arms, white beater
So I can't (can't what?) ease up, I've been put (put what?) He's up
Jesus my Ebenezer, if He leads us, who can defeat us?
So we livin' it holy homie you know that we be gettin' it
Say what you want but homie we know that we gon' live again
My wife to my life to my days and my nights it's gotta be gotta be Jesus
