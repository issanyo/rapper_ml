[Intro]
It's like they want me in a padded room
Through the glass they point and laugh at you
And they say there is no place for me, (echo)

[Verse 1]
Uh, Give me the beat and a couple minutes to breathe and at the speed of Vegeta best believe I give it to you all
To show the people they need Him Imma run upon them with the truth and leave em hard but they see that Imma show em off, Imma show em off
Unbelievers and other people that blow em off
I proceed with the bag of seeds Imma throw em off
Imma sow em and water em till the grow
Till I got the critics calling me crazy like I was going off
Yeah many gave their life without a limit
Fully automatic gave my life and He did mend it
The love He got for us, went on the cross
Tried to win it, homie I've tried to own to sin
The moment I repented, already criticizing when I say that Imma win this, when I tell them that I was chosen, like I made my own decision, I be in it forever, but they never wanna level with me, never be, cause they probably start where I probably would've fi, and I'm the only one that let my glow show
City on the hill, this is what I flow fo'
