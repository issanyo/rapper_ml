Top Rope

[HOOK]
I’m with it, I’m with it
Let’s get it, let’s get it
I’m with it, I’m with it
Let’s get it, let’s get it
This one off the top, this one off the top
Off tha, off tha
This one off the top, this one off the top
Off tha tope rope!

This one, off the, wooo
This one, off the, wooo
Top rope!

This one, off the, wooo
This one, off the, wooo
Top, rope!

[VERSE 1: Corey Paul]
Bout 4 feet in the air, peep the vertical
Probably could of hooped for the Rockets
Me and my homies broke the mold
Out of town on the road
Hit the show got the whole stage rocking
Since tha thang jumping we don’t plan on landing
Macho Man when the mic get handed
Rip into a beat like it’s beef I’m a savage
And since we pump base you can call it drum-attic
Now…
Let me tell you what it’s really bout
I done hit the A gap cause I got it off the block
My lil brother got locked
My lil homie got shot
My lil cousin dropped out
My lil potna got knocked
In the hood they don’t really think God concern with the block
Faith in that coke and they whip it in pots
And The devil got his eyes on my burial plot
So I’m climbing the rope and my click is coming straight off the top

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2: Derek Minor]
It’s Minor boy you know me
Young king that’s my homie
Ain’t never been a phony
Rep the rock you jabroni
I came up where them goons at
40 cal tools at
Smoking on that 808 (They smoking!)
That’s that loud pack
Off the top rope cause they think we losing
I be going hard cause I gotta do it
If you in the streets watch what you doing
Choppas smoking boys like they barbecuing
A lot of these wrestlers is just like these rappers
I use to think they was real (But they not)
Until you find out they ain’t lost no one off in the hood
They don’t know how that feel
