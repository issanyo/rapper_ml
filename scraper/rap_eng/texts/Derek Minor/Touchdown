[Hook: Derek Minor x2]
I'm the RMG quarterback
I give you game that you better catch
Aww yeah, that's a touchdown
Aww yeah, that's a touchdown

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Pay attention, let me give you game
Run the play, man, run the play
We work together, we can change the country
And all that hating, ain't gon' get you nuthin'
Riding in the 96' Cutlass, I got PT on the phone
Told em open up the budget
I got something that I need to say
God said get to busting
Told the Lord, "Send me, I'll go, let me run it, Eyyy"
My way will teach you something, that's a scholarship
My way not of this world though, that's a spaceship
That's why I stand next to the sun and feel like Superman
Now, go and re-listen to that line before you say I brag

[Hook: Derek Minor x2]
I'm the RMG quarterback
I give you game that you better catch
Aww yeah, that's a touchdown
Aww yeah, that's a touchdown

[Verse 2: Canon]
I know the tricks of the trade like the back of my hand
I supply my own material so I can demand
I'm a business, let me handle my business
My knee ain't, but I paper clip
Ya'll ain't about the business
I locked up my own money, can't nobody spend this
I'm self-motivated, call it entrepreneurship
I'm tense when I squeeze on it
Kinda like how sugar gets disturbed in the peace on em'
Kinda how Luda gets
Ya'll don't wanna play, don't play with me
With them mind games
Thinking bigger picture, that's a bar, that's a mindframe
Shout out to my newest single "Eagles", that's a live-change
They don't want a single pushing album with a time-frame
But, I take off when I get charged
I spit raw when I'm in this
I lift off like a rocket that'll break the Guiness
I'm Luke Canon, kick around
Stick a fork in em', better let me finish em'
I crush the game with my bare hands
But I let the vocal diminish em'
Get the Canon

I'm the RMG quarterback
I give you game that you better catch
Aww yeah, that's a touchdown
Aww yeah, that's a touchdown

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
Now, it's a lot of people trying to play the game
Outside the rules
For those that didn't get the memo, let me spell it out for you
Rule 10: make sure your team always shining
They done put in all that work, they need to know they on your mind
Now, rule 9: never be lazy, to step it up
Won't happen if you ain't sitting on yo' oo too much
Rule 8: Uhh, that's easy, never hate
That don't need no explanation, please don't be lame
Rule 7: Know your work, this industry is cold
They'll take your royalties like they wrote them songs
Rule 6: Watch the person watching the person
That's watching the person watching your money, Capisce?
Rule 5: Keep dream killers out of your circle
Rule 4: Cool is cool, but you gon' need some Urkels
Cuz' Cool will say, "You got paid, go get them J's"
While Urkel saying, "If you go broke, you eat those J's"
Rule 3: Won't work for me, won't always work for you
You can learn from my mistakes, don't need to make them too
Rule 2: Never let money get in the way of family
Cuz' they gon' hold you down whether it's garbage cans or Grammys
Rule 1: Never forget who you was made to be
Reflect God, reflect greatness
I said never forget who you was made to be
Reflect God, reflect greatness
Touchdown, RMG
