[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Used to be off of them boats was Africans in ropes
Now what get off of these boats is pounds of coke
Or sex slaves … ain’t it sick?
What you prefer? Take your pick
High schools got armed guards ‘cause teenagers bear arms
And they’ll crack your head and put that video on World Star
That boy you callin’ a nerd got a bomb off in his backpack
Plan to get revenge and leave a crater where his class at
I saw the sickest thing when Channel 4 News was on
A momma put a two-year-old inside a stove
We look at third worlds and turn up our nose
Got the nerve to tell God we got it on our own

[Hook: Thi’sl]
One nation under God
That’s what we supposed to be, that’s why I’m praying hard
In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust
In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Had a cold, so I went to Walgreens
Entered the pharmacy and asked for codeine
Told them I’m a rapper, they laughed and told me to leave
I left with Vitamin C and an itchy throat for weeks
We traded cocaine for mollies, heroin for sizzurp
The devil eatin’ the hood, I think America’s for dessert
The suburbs love rappers, just come to one of our shows
You’ll see Tabitha and Matthew repeating all our flows
While you think she tryna get that tat, but think you wearin’ a snapback
‘Cause culture don’t discriminate and you just thinkin’ it’s black rap
The poor tryna survive, we forgot about the ghetto
Now my hood is famous, and Satan is Geppetto

[Hook: Thi’sl]
To the republic, for which it stands
Please take the government and put it in his hands
In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust
In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
To all the patriots who died in war bloody, every slave
I lift this country to the Lord and in Jesus’ name I pray
That the gospel grip our heart, and we turn from wicked ways
I know you gave us this country and they takin’ it to date
So listen to me, politician: I’m not talking superstition
It’s the fight and the survival of a nation, and we gon’ need way more than religion
In a tragedy we run to he who gives us hope and then we get up fixedly
But I pray that we forever let America submit to the King so one day we’ll be …

[Hook: Thi’sl]
One nation under God
That’s what we supposed to be, that’s why I’m praying hard
In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust
In God We Trust
I said In God We Trust
