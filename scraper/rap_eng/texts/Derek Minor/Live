[Chorus]
Not a day goes by
I don't pray with all my life
You do more than thrive
Please do more than survive
Live x2
I want you to live
Live
I want you to live

[Verse 1]
First time I held you in my arms
Swore to God I would die 'fore I let somebody hurt you
Make life as sweet as I can, but I never will dessert you
A blessing from God and I don't know if I deserve you
I think about your future all the time
And I know you'll change the world, you already changed mine
Wanna shelter you from my life
Make the best men froze
May your smile stay warm and heart never cold
And if you fall I'll be your parachute
That means I tried to help you fly, but gravity's bigger than me and you
I apologize in advance
I know I let you down, cause dad's still a man
I pray through my imperfections you'll see God on the throne
Cause he'll be there to comfort you on that day He call me home
You have a purpose, never question why you're here
As long as you're alive, you gotta live, you gotta live

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by
I don't pray with all my life
You do more than derive
Please do more than survive
Live x2
I want you to live
Live
I want you to live

[Verse 2]
Because you only get one life
One time to leave your imprint
One time to make people around you better, one time to enjoy these minutes, one time to prepare for forever
Follow your dreams, don't want you to have regrets
Never let people define you, they words'll talk you to death
You ever meet the day that you don't feel you measure up
Know you're accepted by God, and son, that is enough
Smile as much as you can, this world'll throw you some curves
Be thankful for what we have, it's more than we deserve
Give to people that need it, greed'll tear you apart
And it's okay to cry sometimes, that's good for your heart
Everybody you love, hold them close
Be quick to reconcile, cause when they gone, they gone
Guess the best way to sum it up is this:
It's God first, family after
The only way to live

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by
I don't pray with all my life
You do more than derive
Please do more than survive
Live x2
I want you to live
Live
I want you to live
