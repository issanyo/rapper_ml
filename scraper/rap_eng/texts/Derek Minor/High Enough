[Intro: WHATUPRG]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got, I got
I feel like PRo 2008
I got, I got, yeah

[Hook: WHATUPRG]
I got angels all around me
So don't ask the boy what's up
You can ask the one's around you
They gonna tell you that it sucks
High enough
I can hear the Lord calling
I don't feel like picking up
Who'd have thought the higher up
The more you get out of touch
High enough

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I been out here tryna climb this ladder am I high enough?
I been turning everything into gold I got the Midas touch
They like you done made it boy
How you feed your family yeah
Pat you on the back and give you thumbs up way to go
I remember when I used to dream about it
Now I'm here I could care less about it
Am I ungrateful?
6 figures on the table, stacking shrimp on the table
I treat it like it ain't a thing though
I been out on the road I been doing these shows
Telling you all how to go up
But I ain't been to church in 4 months
I be the first to admit
I ain't talked to God why
I been way to focused on the climb

[Hook: WHATUPRG]
I got angels all around me
So don't ask the boy what's up
You can ask the one's around you
They gonna tell you that it sucks
High enough
I can hear the Lord calling
I don't feel like picking up
Who'd have thought the higher up
The more you get out of touch
High enough

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Check up, plug them rights, stunt on my haters, go hate on that
I bought a new thing, newer than your thing
I can have everything and feel like I don't have anything oh
Maybe high enough ain't high enough
I've been trying to get to God my plan ain't flying off
That's cause I'm confusing Him with everything I got
I'm confusing what I got with everything I need
I got blessings all around me, I got angels all around me
I got life all around me, how I make it all about me? That's the trap
Spend your whole life chasing nothing
Please don't take the bait let your soul fly high above it

[Hook: WHATUPRG]
I got angels all around me
So don't ask the boy what's up
You can ask the one's around you
They gonna tell you that it sucks
High enough
I can hear the Lord calling
I don't feel like picking up
Who'd have thought the higher up
The more you get out of touch
High enough
