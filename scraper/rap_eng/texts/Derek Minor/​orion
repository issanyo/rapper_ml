[Intro]
Yeah
La la la la la

[Chorus]
All my people, push back evil thatʼs on sight
We gon' fight, we gon' rage against the dying of the light
I’m a giant, I feel like Goliath, but I’m righteous
Know we gon' make it, we donʼt need a psychic
So, if you gonna riot, do it right
They canʼt keep you silent, well alright
Shining like Orion, see the light now
If you gonna riot, do it right now, do it right

[Verse 1]
Ainʼt it true that all we need is love
I’m solar powered, I donʼt need a plug
Standing up ainʼt no lean in my cup
But I still feel depression creeping up
I’m in a dark place, it kinda feel like space
I need more light for it to penetrate
I need more life, I kinda feel like Drake
I been in more fights than men in MMA
Many faces showed me plenty hate
But I been given grace that I can demonstrate
Yeah, I’m straight, and I fix my face when I pen my fate
Loneliness can happen in a very crowded room
Especially when they know who you are but do not know you
I seen many smiling faces that feel miserable inside
And I admit I been that guy at times I’m pitiful too
Shout to XXX I know that life has brought you stress
I really mean it if I could I’d send an SMS
Anyway, I know a way to send an SOS
I put my message in my songs and pray that you are blessed

[Chorus]
All my people, push back evil thatʼs on sight
We gon' fight, we gon' rage against the dying of the light
I’m a giant, I feel like Goliath, but I’m righteous
Know we gon' make it, we donʼt need a psychic
So, if you gonna riot, do it right
They canʼt keep you silent, well alright
Shining like Orion, see the light now
If you gonna riot, do it right now, do it right

[Verse 2]
Shining my light, little light
If you gonna fight, get it right
All of your problems, minimize
They will be solved in the dead of night
I wear all black like a Mennonite
I been this way since like Nick at Nite
All of my pain got legitimized
The son of David epitomized
What it means to be loved
They donʼt care about us
They disparaging us
Nancy Kerrigan us
But my advocate He ainʼt havin’ it
Put all time in my blood
On my axis I spun
In the path of the sun

[Chorus]
All my people, push back evil thatʼs on sight
We gon' fight, we gon' rage against the dying of the light
I’m a giant, I feel like Goliath, but I’m righteous
Know we gon' make it, we donʼt need a psychic
So, if you gonna riot, do it right
They canʼt keep you silent, well alright
Shining like Orion, see the light now
If you gonna riot, do it right now, do it right

[Interlude]
Lighting up the night time
Imma let my light shine
Thatʼs how we do on my side
Thatʼs how we do on my side
Lighting up the night time
Imma let my light shine
Thatʼs how we do on my side
Thatʼs how we do on my side
Lighting up the night time
Imma let my light shine
Thatʼs how we do on my side
Thatʼs how we do on my side
Lighting up the night time
Imma let my light shine
Thatʼs how we do on my side
Thatʼs how we do on my side

[Outro]
God and His Word all through scripture
They're compared to the sun
As soon as the sun gets out of the the centre of the solar system
Everything crashes. Everything goes chaotic
God is light and there is absolutely no darkness in him
The light shines in the darkness and yet the darkness did not overcome it
