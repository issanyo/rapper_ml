[Verse 1]
I don't like the view from here
No I don't like the view from here
This mountain top is cloudy yeah
And everything is not as clear
This altitude starting to make me dizzy
I can't tell my friends from my enimies
I just see green the scenery is pretty
Everything is calm
Yeah everything is calm

[Pre hook]
Whoa oh oh oh
Thought the higher up I got
That the Devil would leave me alone
Whoa oh oh oh
Giving me everything I want in exchange for my soul

[Hook]
I have visions from the top now
I might take the bottom over this
I have visions from the top now
I might take the bottom over this
I have visions from the top now
I might take the bottom over this
I have visions from the top now
I might take the bottom over this

[Verse 2]
They stab you in the back
Smile in your face
Been trying to avoid these Freddy Kruger handshakes
See you in my nightmares your love calls pain
Told me you my brother
Yeah they say you was Cain
It was way more simple when I ate off brand cereal
People hit new lows when all they want is more materials
It's probably my fault I always try to see the best of people
You ain't gotta read the bible to see that we full of evil

[Pre hook]
Thought the higher up I got
That the Devil would leave me alone
Whoa oh oh oh
Giving me everything I want in exchange for my soul

[Hook]
I have visions from the top now
I might take the bottom over this
I have visions from the top now
I might take the bottom over this
I have visions from the top now
I might take the bottom over this
I have visions from the top now
I might take the bottom over this

[Outro]
I tried I tried so hard so hard
I, I, I've been waiting (waiting)
I tried I tried so hard so hard
Yeah, I tried I tried so hard so hard
I tried I tried so hard so hard to come down
Down, down, come down, come down
Yeah, come down yeah woah
