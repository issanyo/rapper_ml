[Intro]
No timeouts
Welcome, so glad you could finally make it
And we've got something to see
Just for you, ha

[Chorus]
Welcome to the revolution
Welcome to the revolution
They been looking for the blueprint
You been gettin' hear some exclusives
Welcome to the revolution
Welcome to the revolution
They been looking for the blueprint
You been gettin' hear some exclusives

[Verse 1]
I am nothing like you rap guys
You should never get it confused
I don't fall for them cornball moves
You should work on your kung fu
Sensei how I kick game, even if they don't listen
Sell your soul to 'em, if you want to your career be missing
Insult the culture vulture, RMG like cosa nostra, mean we family
Murder everything, off of G.O.D, off of G.O.D
Learn from my losses
Started Amplify, now we fittin' to make everybody bosses
Y'all should be cautious
If you check 'cause I check the contract, don't look at me
'Cause that sell your dreams then buy 'em back with your royalties, worries me
Went from robbing hoods to Robin Hood
I can not complain 'cause Yah' is good
Even when they try to overlook
I can not complain 'cause Yah' is good

[Chorus]
Welcome to the revolution
Welcome to the revolution
They been looking for the blueprint
You can get to hear exclusives
Welcome to the revolution
They been looking for the blueprint
You can get to hear exclusives

[Break]
Hey, shouts out Jimmy O
Hey, Kalley G. set aside like I been rapping for my gut on these records
Hey what up Doc. Weezy that's my day one
Tone we fittin' to turn up on this boy real quick you know what I'm saying

[Verse 2]
I've been trying hard to not look down on people I looked up to
I'm just trying to thrive and be a king like I'm supposed to
I've been cast out by people who have called me brother
Now I murder everything you put me on like I'm Killmonger
Umm, whatever I got my things together
I don't sweat it even in hell with three sweaters
The flow frozen on a new level
I could build a snowman on the head of the devil, sheesh
Look what the game did done to me
I watch you get fat while I starved out with my team
But He taught us how to hunt, our aim is pristine
He invent us and sent all the fix-ins with my regime
Glory to God He give grace
He said before you get up finish your plate
So I tell the whole world I'm a sinner and Christ saves
I tell the whole world I'm a sinner and Christ saves
Still talking that talk, this my lane
You know, old dawgs, new tricks, I can't change
That a had you lookin' like you lost your brain
Everybody confused but my mission still the same
Get my family out the hood before I enter my grave
My mind, body, and soul, my faith in the name
Jesus

[Outro]
Welcome to the revolution
Welcome to the revolution
You can get to hear exclusives
Welcome to the revolution
