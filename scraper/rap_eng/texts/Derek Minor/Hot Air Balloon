[Verse 1]
You up in your cubicle
Worked 7 hours got 1 to go
Dinner waitin’ for you at home
But you gotta finish this project though
It’s almost time to get off
So you take it up to your boss
All your co-workers impressed
But he don’t like it at all
So, you gonna have to stay late (what?)
You gonna have to stay late (dang!)
Gary get on your nerves
He always findin’ ways to hate
But what you don’t know is he insecure
And he always fail himself, plus
Life smashed his dreams, so he crush everyone else
And that’s the way that it  is
Even though it ain’t right
Cus he might of bought those problems
But you payin’ the price

[Hook]
Move around and ’round like a tornado that…
Tearin’ everything down
Trying to blow us all away

You so full of hot air, and that’s on my momma
Imma put it in a balloon and float over all that drama

I see stars shining bright below my feet
You can’t bring me down, no you can’t, you can’t bring me down
So just keep giving me everything  I need
You can’t bring me down, no you can’t, you can’t bring me down

I’m floatin’ so high, you can’t bring me down [repeats]

[Verse 2]
Ok now I’m off in this studio
Puttin’ finishin’ touches on all these songs
I’ll probably shoot a video
Unless of course my album budget is all gone
I turn it in to my label, everybody like “whoo”
All these fans say that they love it, bought two copies off of iTunes
Then I get a mention on my timeline, with some random blogger review
Said the whole album is garbage, he hate everything that I do
Well what I ain’t know is he insecure, cus he used to rap himself till
Life smashed his dreams, now he crush everyone else
And that’s the way that is, even though it ain’t right
He might of bought those problems, but we payin’ the price

[Hook]
