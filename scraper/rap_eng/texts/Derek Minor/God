Redemption, found only through the blood of Christ
By definition the payment of a ransom
A gift that none of us could afford
Or that none of us deserve
And although many of us believe that we're the main character in this story
It begins and it ends... with God
In the beginning there was nothin
No earth no you no me
Just a void and the God who existed in three
Created heaven and earth from nothin, one God no discussion
Try to create somethin from nothin if you think I'm bluffin
We are all a product of the Lord's imagination
He manufactured light and darkness from His conversation
The universe and it's inhabitants, He sustainin
The only logical conclusion is to praise and thank Him
With hands lifted up high we submit all of our lives
To the will and the service of our only perfect God
Yahweh sent Yeshua for His glory
Yeshua sent His spirit to indwell us, make us holy
Before that He was slain in exchange for our sin
And then rose from the grave so that we may get to live
We were once enemies now adopted as His kids
And crafted in His body so holla at ya kin
I'm talkin bout God, Father, Son, Spirit
Never have an end he's been here since the beginning
I'm talkin' bout
I'm talkin bout God, Father, Son, Spirit
Never have an end he's been here since the beginning
I'm talkin' bout
God
Now who can roll like King, never frail, never suffer damage
Way bigger than life, prop His feet on top of planets
Never slumber or sleep, keep the earth on it's axis
Know every breath that you breathe, He the artist we the canvas
Every star in the sky, He know em all by name
Every hair on yo head, He can tell you where it lay
In disaster or in famine more reliable than FEMA
Created for his glory homie we are His poema
Satan, demons, angels, seraphim
Trees, creation, will all bow before Him
Bind oxygen with oxygen, hydrogen with oxygen
Give us air and water to sustain us as we follow Him
Sent His Son to earth, told everyone to model Him
Made man from clay with His hands, just to model Him
We are in His image this position is an honor
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Father
I'm talkin bout God, Father, Son, Spirit
Never have an end he's been here since the beginning
I'm talkin' bout
I'm talkin bout God, Father, Son, Spirit
Never have an end he's been here since the beginning
I'm talkin' bout
