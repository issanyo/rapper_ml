Yeah I'm on a mission, Yeah I'm on a mission
Yeah I'm on a mission, Yeah I'm on a mission
P-p-p-playing my position, playing my position
Playing my position, playing my position
I-I-I-I am blasting off to Mars and you know I ain't stopping
I am blasting off to Mars and you know I ain't stopping
I am blasting off to Mars and you know I ain't stopping

Ok I'm blasting off to Mars, (Houston we have a problem)
Soaring like a rocket, but I'm not Kevin Martin
I'm so unashamed for this cross I got my heart in
He set me ablaze I'm on fire, arson
Ain't no turning back boy, I have just departed
It'd be Looney Tunes to quit, Marvin Martian
Yeah I'm on a mission, I ain't worried 'bout no hate-or
I'm blowing up this gospel with my space modulator

Wait a minute it's the grace of the king coming forward, no opposition
In a marathon running for the cross
I can see the finish line and there ain't no quitting
Everybody wanna rep for the Lord
What you asking for, boy yes I'm with it
Our hearts are ready for the takeoff, do we have ignition?

[Hook]

Ok I'm blasting off to Mars, yes sir I'm 'bout to leave Earth
And if I fall Christ catch me like a wide receiver
Bye-bye to my problems, they are old like a beeper
I hope you hear me loud and clear let me adjust my tweeters
The stars have war 'till they get crushed by Darth Vader
But I walk on that sky and be at peace with my maker
I don't need your fame, addicted to the Lord's name
I'm a fiend while my heart beat, Eddie King

I don't ever wanna be the one the Lord said lived his life in vain
If that sounds crazy, then guess I am clinically insane
I'm not of this world, boy you should get that up in your brain
I-I am taking off, but I-I-I ain't on a plane
