[Hook]
They wanna see us fall, but we gon' set it off
Take it to another level till we dead and gone
That's why we gon' get it in, in, in
We gon' get it in, in, in
I'm reppin' for the King, put that on His name
Won't a thang change till they put us in the grave
That's why we gon' get it in, in, in
We gon' get it in, in, in

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Now till they put me in the grave I'm a ride
My homies by my side
Yes sir I'm on my grind to let them know He live and died
On the third day Christ came out the ground
That's why I got to lay it down
Blind till He elected me, so how you like me now?
Choppin' on the block when I hit 'em with a little bit of truth of the King who rose
Humble when He came the first time
But the next time He come he gon' smash his foes
That's why I pack my clothes
When He come back homeboy I'm gone
Feel the same way I feel then let's roll
But till that day I'm into my soul PRo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Suzy Rock]
Like Aaron Rodge(rs) on the 10, You know we gettin' in
We recruitin' for the Saints but this ain't New Orleans
And you can check our roster baby we bear no impostors
But the merits of our cross is crazy go off-off our rockers
If your step is your game DJ please turn up the volume
DJ please turn up the volume so the world can hear the gospel
Preach Christ even if they put the heater to my tonsils
I'm a King James, Dwayne Wade, and Bosch 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: D-Maub]
You know me and P-R-O gon' G-E-T I-T I-N
Ain't no shadow of a doubt and I would never doubt
That with Christ in my life I win
Always on the move, always on the go
Always tryna keep him on the high, never on the low
So don't be surprised when I come to show
His character in my lifestyle and when I flow
Yeah, ya boy grind like bad breaks
Hopin' I can get a message across to slow up the crime rates
I put my faith in action cause God ain't no time wait
And with Jesus I'm straight

[Hook]
