Ay, they don't know how to take it
Cold wylin in Wylie Texas they don't know how to shake it
On operating your rules they don't know how to play me
And I'm the boss in 2010 they don't know how to fade me, haha
Ain't no Christian that's listenin my competition is the
Man in the mirror I see as my opposition
Trying to be the goal is Derek Minor
More bass and treble
If I blindly follow Jesus I guess that I'm Daredevil
Please don't call me a trap rapper
I get tired of 808's and embarrassing back packin
Don't get along, I'ma get to braggin
But just know that I rap about God my choice, and no way is the skill lackin
That's for the naysayers
That's for the ones hopin we fall in their late prayers
They call me Minor but dang I'm trying to live major
Why you think I live my life for the Savior with no time for a hater?
I don't know why I'm here, the Lord got me
This is not my plan I'm supposed to been done, man
Not runnin round tellin people God tan
Not in hotels, on the fifth floor, Bruh Man
I was talkin to BJ about the mission and wondering if I'm the only one that sees some things missing
More shows than we ever had
Sellin more verse than we ever had, it ain't lookin bad
But I'm wondering if these young boys know
That before we had all that, huh, we had to grow
Cause believe me, it's so easy when you weakly? to fall for the sleazy and lose everything
I ain't hating, I'm just saying
I ain't baitin, I'm just praying
Yeah, I know you feel me though
That's what you get at 2AM in the studio
Minor
