[Introduction]
Yeah, it’s PSA Volume 3
The final conclusion. Pay attention

[Verse 1]
I came in the game stuntin’ on my haters
Who knew I would be praying for ‘em years later
Mayne, what I ride, I went from being most wanted
To signed to a label whose music is most wanted
Some would say I came up, finally built my name up
You doing pretty good, why you changing everything up?
Let me explain, I’ve been forced through adversity
I’ll school you to the rules of Derek Minor University
Keep God at the center of your plans
Family is important, so be a man
Life is more than whip whippin’ in the Benz
And if they see you wrong, then you better clean the lens
I never planned to be on entertainment
‘Cause my family in the hood
Y’all ain’t seeing the picture, I’m here to paint it
You looking for that bubble gum, candy coated, I ain’t it
I gotta keep it real, ‘cause the truth you can’t replace it

[Hook]
So come aboard this plane, please let me take you higher
Let me take you higher, let me take you higher
There’ll probably be some turbulence, but
Let me take you higher, let me take you higher
Let me take you higher
We know who’s in control and I bet He take us higher
Bet He take us higher, bet He take us higher
PSA Vol. 3, let my symphony take you higher
And I’m no longer PRo, introducing Derek Minor

[Verse 2]
Ok, I’m putting on for my city, New Jerus. my home boy
You could find me in Yak Town, in Cashville I roam boy
Shout out to BJ, the mayor of M-Town
RMG, Reach Records, we shut this thing down
What a world we living in, Imma let you know about it
Dirty where we work, this time I flow about it
My people going to jail, they ain’t got no hope about it
So I’m screaming out Jesus, my faith in His throne around it
116 when I claim, man we sort of like a gang
‘Cause we rep ourselves proud, ain’t no lames where I stay
Yelling “God Over Money”, shout to Bizzle in the H
And my name may have changed, but the mission still the same
The Lord told me He making me something greater
Scales gone from my eyes, I see the savior
If you don’t like where I’m going then give me prayer
But I prefer you ride, let’s see where this journey take us

[Hook]
So come aboard this plane, please let me take you higher
Let me take you higher, let me take you higher
There’ll probably be some turbulence, but
Let me take you higher, let me take you higher
Let me take you higher
We know who’s in control and I bet He take us higher
Bet He take us higher, bet He take us higher
PSA Vol. 3, let my symphony take you higher
And I’m no longer PRo, introducing Derek Minor
