[Chorus]
We all came from nothing
Everything that we got is out the mud, out the mud no lie
You were made for greatness
And if I can do it you can do it too
But your soul must fly
Your soul must fly-y-y-y-y-y
Your soul must fly-y-y-y-y-y

[Verse 1]
See I been to the top of the mountain
And have in my possessions things that you calling astounding Accomplished most the things I want now I'm guessing my purpose
A lot of dreams I put my worth in starting to feel worthless
Can gold plaques bring my dad back
Or some of these trophies and awards help get my people on track
Or can my Spotify streams help that cop think before he pull the trigger
I can't fix that with ten figures
Over property that we don't own, we gunning down each other
Trying to make them ends meet but that EBT don't cover
Rob, cheat, sell dope, even if that mean killing each other
Then the prison system eat off all our death just like vultures
I just call it like it is
I know that sin killing friends
Yea I know that we all see it, we don't know we'll live again
We chase the American dream for a long price
But before you die, let your soul fly

[Chorus]
We all came from nothing
Everything that we got is out the mud, out the mud no lie
You were made for greatness
And if I can do it you can do it too
But your soul must fly
Your soul must fly-y-y-y-y-y
Your soul must fly-y-y-y-y-y

[Verse 2]
Your soul must fly, High above the trap
By any means, what happened to your wings
What happened to your dreams
Did this world snatch 'em
You can float above it all
Why let the devil drag you
May not reach perfection but here's a valuable lesson
More money that you get, the more stressing, Big taught me that
At all times keep your head up, 'Pac taught me that
No possession on this earth can match my worth, God taught me that
In this May weather, the sun out but I'm feeling cold as December
Trying to dodge God's hand but my arms way too short to box with Him
What I mean is I been disconnected from the one that really show me how to live
I been trying to feel, I been trying to feel, I been trying to feel, I been trying to feel
I found out some friends will turn they back on you
Love of money the root of evil
How we value the talent but not value the people
Some even use God's name for money and fame
But you can never fly carrying all of those weights

[Chorus]
We all came from nothing
Everything that we got is out the mud, out the mud no lie
You were made for greatness
And if I can do it you can do it too
But your soul must fly
Your soul must fly-y-y-y-y-y
Your soul must fly-y-y-y-y-y
