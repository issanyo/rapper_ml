[Intro: Woodsy Jr.]
Woodsy Jr

[Verse 1: Woodsy Jr.]
You got the ice, rings with the rocks
But I am on Saturn
You ride the foreign, keys in the cars
But I’m ‘bout to blast off
I’m goin’ for a trip in my favorite rocket ship
Gravity and I, we are opposites
Some people said I was a problem kid
Houston don’t know what my problem is
I’m a Space Ranger, you in grave danger
If you doubt the One born in the manger
He’s a game changer, He’s a playmaker
And first and foremost, He’s my savior
So when it comes to this music, I’m raisin’ my bar
I’ll hit my peak when I’m rovin’ on Mars
I’ll shoot for the moon, I’ll shoot for the stars
If I miss then I’m walkin’ with God, blast off

[Hook: Derek Minor]
And I been feelin’ like they tryna hold me down, hold me down, yeah
But every time I fall I never touch the ground, touch the ground, yeah
I keep blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh

[Verse 2: Woodsy Jr.]
I wake up in the morning, give God a high five
Woo, smile at those who say I’m too nice
Rap every line like it’s my last breath
Make every move like it’s my last step
Made to rap my dude, check my aptitude
I can’t wear a mask like the actors do
They say stay in your lane, check my latitude
Cause I’m just doin’ what He asked me to
I’m all about the Son like Malibu
So I rap the truth, yeah, I’m a canon dude
I’m like Jackie Moon with a pack of fools
And we semi-pro with a attitude
Hungry for the beats like a lack of food, need a track or two
You don’t like me, who’s askin’ you?
I only seek Heaven so what do I have to lose?
That said, I’mma do what I have to do, blast off

[Hook: Derek Minor]
And I been feelin’ like they tryna hold me down, hold me down, yeah
But every time I fall I never touch the ground, touch the ground, yeah
I keep blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh

[Verse 3: Clout King Cory]
On this track with Woodsy Jr
We just had to do it to ya
Oh my gosh, we takin’ off
Neil Armstrong, we some astronauts
Champions with rings like Saturn
Spittin’ heat, third degree burn
Get up outta where my space is
‘Fore I have to kick Uranus
Clout King Cory what my name is
In outer space, I'll still claim it
Maybe one day I'll be famous
Me and Woodsy, we gon’ make it
On God's team, we never changin’
That's no KD with OKC, yeah
Venus, Mercury, and Mars
We takin’ off, shooting stars

[Hook: Derek Minor]
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh
Blastin’ off like a astronaut, yeah, oh my gosh

[Outro: Byron Juane]
Feel a little good, yeah, feel a little good, hey, yeah
Outta my head, nothin’ like this
Nothin’ like this, takin’ off, here
Space Jam, feel, rocket built
Feel a little good, skrrt
Nothin’ like this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
