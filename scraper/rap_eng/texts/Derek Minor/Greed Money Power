[Verse 1: Beleaf]
Yeah, shots fired but they missed (missed)
When I go outside I take a risk, put my hands up and make a fist
Excuse the slits on my wrist
Aristocrats think they sit in highness (highness)
We live inside of violence (violence) and I don't blame the Lord I blame my soul
And I'll do anything to police their call
Cookouts, or pool party at Starbucks but no coffee, selling water
Lemonade and I ain't even gotta a gun but you're still afraid
Need a permit 'cause your salty
It don't matter what the government taught me
Everything that they do is come into the light
If you're walking with the Son, then you can see us all bright
Look at

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa
Aye, aye, Lord help us, Lord help us, Lord help us
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa
Aye, aye, Lord help us, yeah Lord help us

[Verse 2: Aaron Cole]
They said I wouldn't make it out unless I had a jump shot
But I stay be dodging bullets yeah, I always jump shots
Sending prayers up every day, but corruption it won't stop
Like who really on my side about to hire my own cops
It's like America tryna kill me but first, you gotta find me
Yeah I'm at the top of Hilfiger like I'm Tommy
They want it and want it, but just flown in, flown in
They in office when they should be America's most wanted
All I see is

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa
Aye, aye, Lord help us, Lord help us, Lord help us
Here we go
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa
Aye, aye, Lord help us, Lord help us, aye

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
I got dogs out there running on those blocks (on those blocks)
They got pills probably lean in they shots (in they shots)
Don't be square if you ever call the cops (ever call the cops)
Blow your brains out now you think outside the box
I cannot tell the difference between dope boys, preachers and
The politician wanna try though
One trap home, one trap fear
Let me make it clear they all rap trash full of cheese
What's the motivation? money, pride, green for the green
We turn the world to the perch (perch)
What do they worship all over the earth?
It's that

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa
Aye, aye, Lord help us, Lord help us, Lord help us
Here we go
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa (whoa)
Greed, money, power, whoa
Aye, aye, Lord help us, Lord help us
