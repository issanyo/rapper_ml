[Chorus: Byron Juane]
Swish
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, on God
Yeah, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
Uh, I been taking risks (Taking risks)
See them how they play, got me shooting with the wrists (With the wrists)
Made my own lane then I pull up like swish (Like swish)
Y'all hate how I’m playin', y'all can get a load of this (Load of this)
Swish like
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam, bam (Yeah)
Bam, bam, bam, bam (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Canon]
Ha, ha, ha
Ha ha
AM to PM to PM to early morning, I’m petty (I'm petty)
Forget the party, nowhere near confetti
Not havin' good grip done taught me already
Better get up to come down and I'm up to throw down when I'm up in your town
I, I gotta hand you waves, I gotta make some shake
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta run my race, take your place
Hit the jumper, three points shootin' the shot is all I got, we want the rings
But we came from nothing
But I ain't gotta work alone, this fight is fought within the team
Then we hit the lockers
Shower with the grace of God I'm dripping fluid all over my callous stepping, well God got us
I pray for haters and even pray for my blockers yeah

[Chorus]
Uh, I been taking risks (Taking risks)
See them how they play, got me shooting with the wrists (With the wrists)
Made my own lane then I pull up like swish (Like swish)
Y’all hate how I’m playin', y’all can get a load of this (Load of this)
Swish like
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam, bam

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Oh Lord (Oh Lord), hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Tryna pull a whole generation out the sewer uh
I saw the Holy Land and got a new influence
I came home and still feel like a tourist, bam
What you finna do when all your plans go bam?
Whippin' with the blessings in my hand like bam
Think we finna lose, you don't know who I am
Okay, okay, okay, let me just explain it (Explain it)
Hmm, contemplate
Mountains move when I oscillate
They go through changes just to compensate
'Cause the king is in you, you can’t relate
I realize the world is asleep off of Xanax
My movement is minor but larger than planets
And terminate everyone off in our annex
Finally we'll realize that we got advantage (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Uh, I been taking risks (Taking risks)
See them how they play, got me shooting with the wrists (With the wrists)
Made my own lane then I pull up like swish (Like swish)
Y'all hate how I'm playin', y'all can get a load of this (Load of this)
Swish like
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam, bam (Yeah)
Bam, bam, bam, bam (Yeah, yeah)
