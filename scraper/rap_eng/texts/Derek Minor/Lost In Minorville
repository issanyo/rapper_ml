[Intro]
There's a place where life is everything you dreamed it would be
There are no problems, or conflict
And you're always right...
Even when you're wrong
Racism, and class-ism, don't exist
And birds never poop on your car...
Even after you've washed it
Yes, I know this place
It's called...
Minorville

[Verse: Derek Minor]
I woke up in a new Bugatti
(Turn up!)
Or Honda Accord...
I can't tell the difference
And everybody loved all my opinions
I did everything right
Cause that's what it means to be Christian
Drove 60 in a 45
The cops ain't even trip
Guess Obama just cleared my Illuminati membership
Got mistaken for a doctor
Instead of a ball player
And the Pistons drafted Carmelo...
We winnin' it all playa!
No political parties
The government's fair, right
It's ILLEGAL for father's not to be in they kids life
Marriage is a habit
Women are not objectified
And rappers tell the TRUTH in they songs instead of lies
This is a place where there's no black or white churches
Color could NEVER divide us...
We love each other perfect
I hope you find what you lookin' for in our city now
Hey this is Minorville
Come and take a look around!

[Outro: singer]
Uh huh, oh yeah yeah
Come on
Come take a walk with me
I'll show you the other side...
