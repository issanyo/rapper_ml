[Intro]
Yeah
This for the culture
Reflect Greatness, let's go

[Hook]
You were made for greatness
You were made for greatness baby
You were made for greatness
And don’t you let them tell you nothing else
X2

[Verse 1]
Reporting to you live from the gutter
Where the news say we only wanna kill each other
I done heard all these cries from our mothers
They still praying for the lives of our brothers yea
Some feel we worthless, I think that's a lie
Misunderstood like rocket science but that's the reason we fly
The world is broken I know it, I believe God the mechanic
We are tools to change it all, he even uses the ratchet
Some of my dogs climbing mountains of burdens
So they get high trying to reach the pinnacle of purpose
I know geniuses that died in the streets
They was deaf to they purpose, they was moving them keys, they Beethoven
Praying for wealth to deliver us
But even if your chains are gold, you still a prisoner
Stuck in the darkness and still waiting on the risen Son
A bunch of kings and we don't know that it's a throne for us
Greatness

[Hook]
You were made for greatness
You were made for greatness baby
You were made for greatness
And don’t you let them tell you nothing else
X2

[Verse 2]
I know how it is to take a loss, they ain't see your passion
And every year they write you off, I can tell you that's taxing
Kill your dreams and it haunt you, makes it very hard to sleep
But the benefit of that is I'm awake now
Can't tell you how Many times I thought to call it quits
I'm only here cause God been on my side through all of this
I'm only here cause RMG and all my dogs in this
My friends and family hold me up, won't let me fall in this
Please believe
From the inception of my purpose, it's been bigger than me
Christopher Nolan can't direct our dreams
Don't understand why anybody would wanna stop us
We just trying to bring flavor to the table like a potluck
I'm rambling, before you get to hating
Before my verse end, I'll sum it up like calculators
You are here for more, there's a purpose on the trail you're blazing
It's amazing
Reflect God, Reflect Greatness

[Hook]
You were made for greatness
Aw, you were made for greatness baby
You were made for greatness
And don’t you let them tell you nothing else
X2

[Outro]
And don't you let 'em tell you nothing else
No don't you let 'em tell you nothing else, yeah
Don't you let 'em tell you nothing else

Ay, don't you let 'em tell you nothing else
You were made for -
You were made for -
Greatness, amazing, it's greatness
And nah nana nah, nana nah, nana dadada
Greatness
