I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, I–I–I wake up, I–I tha-thank the Lord, tha-thank the Lord for shalo–shalom

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Aye, I wake up before I throw a beater on
I thank the Lord for peace or you can say shalom
I’m on and I’m gone, out the door, I’m gon’ rep my home
New Jerusalem, yeah, you know where we belong
Got the Word in my heart, when the day start then the darkness wanna get us sparked up
So I keep a guard up, 'cause sin in me wanna get the best of me and have me all scarred up
And I know I’m marked up by the Spirit Who's still in me, fillin' me up with everything I need (okay)
Yeah, they got that cheese, but I don’t need a piece, I just need peace, please
This life ain’t easy, matter fact it's opposite
And I got the test results (what), I’m very positive (okay)
That’s why I’m on this track with PRo because I’m 'posed to give Some potent portions of potion proportionate to poster kids
Of pain and sufferin' whose daddys never loved on them
And wouldn’t know the peace of God if it was placed in from of them
And I was one of them, I don’t take my life for granted
So I'ma use this day tryna share my faith and pray that seeds are planted

[Hook]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, I–I–I wake up, I–I tha-thank the Lord, tha-thank the Lord for shalo–shalom

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Yeah! Uh!
Early in the mornin', A.M., you know that I thank Him
’Cause He still call me clean regardless of the mess I lay in
My vision on the throne, clearer than Patrón, yes sir, I am gone
In my zone, thinking ’bout the way my Father put me on
It’s nothing but grace how He still give me faith and He died for the ultimate villain
I still disobey, but regardless, I’m chained when I should have been dead, but I’m livin'
See I know when I’m wrong He won’t leave me alone that’s the beauty of God and His mercy
So I’m singing this song about Him on the cross and my heart was the item of purchase
Why live on props? So worthless
Say they wrestle and fight, but I merk it
Whether live or die, I'm dedicated to Christ, yes sir, I'ma stand on my purpose
Put my faith in Him 'cause He perfect, insurance like Geico
'Cause if I do not have His love I’m Norman Bates, psycho
I go hard, I still rebel with Lecrae
Give my whole life for the King, don’t Trip, just let Him Invade
I Sho Baraka Obama this peace is more than just worth it
So call Tedashii, tell him Identity Crisis averted, hey!

[Hook]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, I–I–I wake up, I–I tha-thank the Lord, tha-thank the Lord for shalo-shalom

[Verse 3: Lecrae & PRo]
Aye, aye, 24/7 all the time, yeah, I’m on my grind
Dyin’ everyday, I’m tryin’ rhyme, hope to save they lives
Peace – what I got, I feel released from the knots
Sin bound me in, but Jesus had the keys to the locks
This life is boot camp, yeah, I know the drill, flesh kill
But His will, it's with His peace that I’m filled and it’s real (aye)
Earth is not my home while I roam in Rome
Got the Lord up on my dome, restin’ in that new shalom
See it goes C-H-R-I-S-T, G-O-D, His spirit inside of me
And without His L-O-V-E I’m another lost soul, so obviously
When I drink the Livin’ Water that’s nothing more than a product of the grace through faith that I found in Him
The love He gives could accursed of sin
Why should I ever give in?
So chase that money, get your wrist cold as refrigerators
I will be an outcast ’til He raise me up, elevators
Me and you (y'all)
Yo momma, yo cousin, my brother, pray we never sell our soul for a chance to be stuntin’
’Cause everything that’s good in me, the Lord, He done it, run it!

[Hook]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on

I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new shalom
I–I wake up, I–I–I wake up, I–I tha-thank the Lord, tha-thank the Lord for shalo-shalom
