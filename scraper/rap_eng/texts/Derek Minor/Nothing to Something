[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
Chino
We ain't never had nothing (whoa)
We ain't never had nothing (whoa)
Tryna' turn it into something
We ain't never had nothing
But we try and turn this nothing into something, yeah, yeah
Into something yeah yeah, into something
Into into something yeah, yeah
We ain't never had nothing
But we try and turn this nothing into something, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Oh don't you judge me
Please don't you judge me
You supposed to love me
You looking down like you standing above me but I'm so used to that yeah
America acting like they sinless they don't play their part
They just blame it on us
Land of the free was built for free off of Granny back
They just take it from us
Enslaved us and just took our culture till nothing left
Beat us and broke us with noose around our neck
Sold our families and raped our mothers with no respect
And told us if we learned to read it would be certain death
And that's the hand that we was dealt played it through Jim Crow
White hoods and shotguns intimidate our vote
But still we persisted tried to believe
Even if assassins kill our kings with dreams
And I ain't asking for no sympathy
But the difference in our history often affects who we intend to be
And don't you dare talk 'bout a broken home
Cause for 250 years all our families was bought and sold
Still trying to put it together, I feel like it's taking forever
It ain't for a lack of trying we trying to do better
Gotta rise above it
Trying to turn this nothing into something

[Chorus: Aaron Cole & Propaganda]
We ain't never had nothing (whoa)
We ain't never had nothing (whoa)
Trying to turn it into something
We ain't never had nothing
But we try and turn this nothing into something, yeah, yeah
Into something yeah, yeah, into something
Into, into something yeah, yeah
We ain't never had nothing (no)
But we try and turn this nothing into something yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2: Propaganda]
Little homie nothing did the trick (uh)
Homie let me learn you a trick (woo)
Black people teach you how to breathe it though
Ex Nihilo, something out of nothing you should see it though
It's black boy joy, black boy fly (fly)
Black girl rock, hit the rock make it cry
Hold the staff for Moses can't call it its magic from 10,000 hours
And not having it, couple, cup of noodles and hot links
A gourmet feast a miracle, nothing short a tree
Sprouting out concrete, yeah right out the concrete
Yeah y'all beyond weak
System kill our prophets and mock our mournful
Give us balls and mics and demand we perform for them
It's crazy 300 years been trying to say to you
Why I gotta explain, it ain't plain to you? (huh?)
We never had nothing but nothing was sufficient
Kept my belly full of the stuff the rich was missing
Y'all could grow a little, your little minds could listen
Privilege you protect has made y'all a victim
You think you blameless, I know you shamed it
Y'all can't even see the pain in our faces
You ain't got the frame for the effects of displacement
You marvel at the joy that comes from our spaces
Even though
Even though

[Chorus: Aaron Cole & Propaganda]
We ain't never had nothing (whoa)
Even though, even though
We ain't never had nothing (whoa)
Trying to turn it into something
We ain't never had nothing (whoa)
But we try and turn this nothing into something yeah, yeah
Into something yeah, yeah, into something
Into, into something yeah, yeah
We ain't never had nothing
But we try and turn this nothing into something yeah, yeah
