[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
We first mey my heart was beatin' like a drum set
You play guitar with my emotions in this love yes
You need a lead singer
Let me be yo front man
And put diamonds on yo' finger girl
Now you got a rock band
Its done been a long day
Leave it up to me?
Turn my swag on Jackie Chan
Trynna sweep you off yo' feet
Hiya!
Always there regardless of what I do
Now my life is camera shy
I can't picture it without you girl
(And girl you bad, you bad, you bad)
But I ain't got to tell you that
(Tell you that)
But I still do
(I still do)
And it's still true
(It's still true)
And we still here after all we been through
(We been through)
It's still me
And it's still you, let's go

[Hook: JC]
All I know is
You've been good to me
But I can love you better
I can love you better, woah
All I want is you for the rest of my life
But I can love you better
I can love you better, baby

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
It goes rose, petals, Marvin Gaye
And yo' favorite fragrance
Dining room candles lit lookin' like a seance
Your boys out there whippin'
You ain't know I got that pot smokin'
Plus I got a bubble bath with yo' name on it
You ain't got to worry 'bout a thing
I want our love first class
You 'bout to get an upgrade
Come fly with me
She rather die with me (rather die with me)
I know that cause when we was broke
That girl survived with me
Yeah, I swear to God on that alter
My love for you will never falter
And I plan on keepin' that promise forever
We going higer today girl I'm a love you better

[Hook]

[Bridge]

And I'm a treat you better babe
Cause you got my last name, yeah
And I'm a love you better
So I'm a love you better, baby, yeah
