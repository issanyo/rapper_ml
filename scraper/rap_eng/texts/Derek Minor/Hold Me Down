God's love is like this
That while we was yet sinners
Christ died for the ungodly
That's including me kinfolk
Man I constantly fall
But some reason, the unmatched grace of the Lord
Constantly brings me back to the cross
That's why this is my song, let's get it
Why did He have grace on my soul
Even though I left Him out in the cold
But still, He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He still give me life everyday
Even though I try to throw it away
But still, He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
I wake up before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees thank the Lord for the new Shalom
Don't turn my swag on, matter fact I turn it off
My mission from the boss, to go and seek and save the lost
Not like I'm doin' it the Spirit got me juiced up
Performance enhancer gon' throw it in my cup
But I ain't Barry Bonds, I don't wanna tell nobody
Then I remember what they did to my Savior's body
And I remember how that was 'sposed to be me
How I was never a g, just tryna soak up the scene
While flodgin off in these streets, I coulda been clapped with heat
Instead of me six feet, the Lord is given me peace (so)
I never turn back on fire like napalm
Ain't a big enough platter for you to serve me cake on
That mean I'd rather eat dirt than deny the name
Although I'm inconsistent, He still take away the pain
Why did He have grace on my soul
Even though I left Him out in the cold
But still, He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He still give me life everyday
Even though I try to throw it away
But still, He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
You couldn't tell me nothin', before Jeezy and Game made the song
Hard-headed young nappy boy, tryna get on
Woulda sold my soul for a chance to be that dude, overdid everything
Yes I was that fool
Sat in church Sunday played games with the Lord too
Opposite of Milton Bradley, man I had no 'Clue'
Pride on the outside, dead on the inside
Thought about suicide, the boy wanted to take his life
Every treasure that I found, turned to mud in my hand
Women, notoriety, ever dollar of the cash
Awaken my Spirit, put my faith in the Son
Old things passed away, man I tryna get it done
But I fall like Alicia Keys, trip like Beyonce
Wanna stay down, but the Lord strengthen my faith
Shoulda been dead Lord, I don't wanna count the days
Every time you give me grace, I don't understand your ways
Why did He have grace on my soul
Even though I left Him out in the cold
But still, He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He still give me life everyday
Even though I try to throw it away
But still, He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
He hold me down, ay
Why did He have grace on my soul
Even though I left Him out in the cold
But still, He hold me down, ay
But still, He hold me down, ay
But still, He hold me down, ay
But still, He hold me down, ay
He still give me life everyday
Even though I try to throw it away
But still, He hold me down, ay
But still, He hold me down, ay
But still, He hold me down, ay
But still, He hold me down, ay
