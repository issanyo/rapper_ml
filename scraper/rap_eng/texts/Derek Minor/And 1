[Chorus]
Yeah look
God got me I’m blessed
I ain’t even done I bet
Out here chasing success
I don't even count my checks
And one, and one, and one, and one, and one, and one
Ya worried bout who next
I’m just putting in reps
I ain’t even done I bet
I just made something upset
And one, and one, and one, and one, and one, and one

[Verse 1]
Right on time just hit a milli
Wait nah .3
That's 1.3 mil
Shoot the shot .3
God never run dry
Blessings stacked too high
I know it’s good but aye I
Crossover great AI
I know it’s coming tenfold
Look how the tens fold
I got a number one song
And 1 that tho
And 2 that ooh
And 3 that flow
And I’m 'bout to hit the road
Moved out I’m on a roll
My fam straight got no complaints
I’m on the skates I’m in the rink
I’m in the sync
I tell the truth I’m Mr. Linc
My diamond pink
I’m going nasty it kind of stink
Sometimes I get down but then I know what’s up
I can never doubt cause he always one me up

[Chorus]
God got me I’m blessed
I ain’t even done I bet
Out here chasing success
Ion even count my checks
And one, and one, and one, and one, and one, and one
Ya worried bout who next
I’m just putting in reps
I ain’t even done I bet
I just made something upset
And one, and one, and one, and one, and one, and one

[Verse 2]
Grown man flow got me signed to Gotee

[Chorus]

And one, and one, and one, and one, and one, and one
Ya worried bout who next

I just made something upset
And one, and one, and one, and one, and one, and one
