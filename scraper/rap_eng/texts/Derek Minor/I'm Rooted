[Hook]
Okay, I get it, I know, I get it
Okay, I get it, I know what they thinkin'
Okay, I get it, I know, I get it
Okay, I get it, I know what they thinkin'

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm rooted, boy I thought you knew it
Tell you where we been by, show you how we do it
Yeah, it seem outrageous, see us on these stages
Probably should be locked up, should be in them cages
But he just threw out our cases, set us free, paid our wages
Now we rock that Rock of Ages, make him famous, what his name is?
Jesus the one that saved us, gorillas - you can't tame us
Ain't no walls that contain us, we Christians but we dangerous
That truth will rearrange ya, have you looking like a stranger
Change a banger to a husband and a father, I ain't playin'
Hold up, let me make it plain-er, I'm planted by that river
You know I'm 'bout that life cause I'm with the Life Giver, yes sir!!

[Bridge: Lecrae]
I'm rooted
I'm rooted
I'm rooted

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
It's game time like Sunday
We 'bout to take off, this a runway
Like we ain't 'bout that life, that's what they say
I don't know what y'all thinkin', this KAA
Aye build me up like Jenga, we skyscrapers, they see us
So stand tall, we all rooted through trees called believers
(Welcome to the jungle) we'll show you what real look like
We'll show you what trill look like, you just pay attention alright?
Okay, I get it, I know what you thinkin'
We some kum-ba-yah Christians, that memo I must've missed it
But I did get the one that said "go until I'm gone"
That's why we've been here for years and you ain't even known

[Hook x2]
