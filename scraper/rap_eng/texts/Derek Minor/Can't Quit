And I can't change it
I feel it down in my soul
That I won't make it
Unless the Lord make me whole
Regardless what he say, I can't quit
Regardless what she say, I can't quit
Regardless what they say, I can't quit
I can't quit, I can't quit, I can't quit

I wake up, go to the mirror, what I'm lookin' at?
I don't think I like the person that is lookin' back
â€˜Cause in my heart I know that evilness inside me
I see the Lord is everywhere, but the Devil's beside me
And he keep tellin' me to trust inside my own self
The Lord he ain't gave you enough, go get your own wealth
You can kill the game with the right mind frame
The whole world is yours mayne, switch like LeBron James
I'm so cavalier for the Lord's glory
But Satan want me immersed in heat the end of my story
And this a piece of me that'll sell out so easily
For some dimes of cheddar, that's so measly
So as I go I fight back with his truth
Air it out in this booth, listen I am livin' proof
That the Lord uses broken men for his own purpose
Justified through his blood, but I'm not perfect

And I can't change it
I feel it down in my soul
That I won't make it
Unless the Lord make me whole
Regardless what he say, I can't quit
Regardless what she say, I can't quit
Regardless what they say, I can't quit
I can't quit, I can't quit, I can't quit
