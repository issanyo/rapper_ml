Most people say that they know God, that they gon' live forever
But when you see they life you lookin' at 'em like "whatever"
See you can't live your life for you and claim that Christ died for you
So lose your life to save it and save it and die denyin' truth
See you are wrong to think that you are why you livin', homes
'Cause it's the common grace of God is what you livin' on
Death is when he take that away, take time to separate
Leave you to yourself, let you burn like an oven bake
Whether the fire's literal or not, one thing's for sho'
Apart from God is torment and death, just had to let you know
But he gave us a way out, I'm here to get his name out
Faith in Christ - the only way that we won't get our payout
'Cause we deserve death, listen up, hope you hear me folk

You can gain the world, but I guarantee it get you merked
