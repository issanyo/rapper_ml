[Intro]
All the guys I know are getting in trouble
That's how it's always been
When the odds are all against you
How can you win?

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna knock me off my square, then you should get better aim
And if you grindin' like I'm grindin', go'n and mess with me mayne
Ain't no time for all that trippin' with the stress on my brain
When them haters get to hatin', this is what we gon' say
Tell 'em I'm focused, I'm focused boy

[Chorus]
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused boy
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused boy
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused, I'm focused
Focused boy

[Verse 1]
Aye it's that Kool-Aid sippin' boy, Southerner draw drippin' boy
Boo should pay attention to these words that I say
Cause I may lose you with this grammar from 'Bama
Chitlins and greens at they grandma house
White coat and they dog 'em out, come ride with me mayne
With me that Arm & Hammer, in his arms he got hammers
So when I'm gridin' in the city I don't care about the dro, cause the soul is what I'm after
I ain't got time for no trippin', my grind is on
This ain't get yo - get yo watermelon dead on, boy
You don't ever wanna give, what you are, wait on it, don't you sin
I see venom on your lips, only food is give you kiss
And I ain't one, you ain't foolin' me
I see you, I see through you like airport security (security)
Security (security), your security...

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna knock me off my square, then you should give it a aim
And if you grindin' like I'm grindin', go'n and mess with me mayne
Ain't no time for all that trippin' with the stress on my brain
When them haters get to hatin', this is what we gon' say

[Chorus]
Tell 'em I'm focused, I'm focused boy
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused boy
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused boy
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused, I'm focused
Focused boy

[Verse 2]
Aye you are all I wanna do is complain when something inside I'm gon' hate
If it ain't mine then it's lame, PRo wanna eat off some plate
Go sit down boy, I'm a show you how we get down boy
And if we stop hate right near down boy, then I'll blow up like
, POW
See me and my dawgs is focused to get truth to all the hopeless
If you try to pick and poke it, disappear, hocus pocus
Abracadabra, it go hope for this arrow
And it's found in Jesus Christ, sir I put that on my nana
So we take it to the streets where they got clips like bananas
And they feedin' it to anyone with Ana or Drama
Yeah, you may be blind, don't know if you seein' G
So call this Braille, tell me, are you feelin' me? (You feelin' me?)
You feelin' me? (You feelin' me?) You ain't feelin' me...

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna knock me off my square, then you should get better aim
And if you grindin' like I'm grindin', go'n and mess with me mayne
Ain't no time for all that trippin' with the stress on my brain
When them haters get to hatin', this is what we gon' say

[Chorus]
Tell 'em I'm focused, I'm focused boy
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused boy
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused boy
I'm focused, I'm focused
I-I-I'm focused, I'm focused, I'm focused
Focused boy
