[Chorus: Aaron Cole & Derek Minor]
I just wanna see you win
We can't take no elses here
Nah that's not in the plan
You don't understand I just wanna see you win
If they ain't with the squad then just leave them in the stands
You don't understand I just wanna see you win
We just take our hustle and on top is where we land
We don't understand I just wanna see you win
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just wanna see you win

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Win, really win
God forgive us of our sin
Its really real if I don't see you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've been praying for my enemies lately
When they see I'm changing, I know that sounds so crazy
Pretend I done seen the real turn him into kiss
Look alive (alive) but you hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow
Oh my my
What you feeling leave behind, where your legacy reside
Is it truth or a lie?
I just wanna see you win

[Chorus: Aaron Cole & Derek Minor]
We can't take no elses here
Nah that's not in the plan
You don't understand I just wanna see you win
If they ain't with the squad then just leave them in the stands
You don't understand I just wanna see you win
We just take our hustle and on top is where we land
We don't understand I just wanna see you win
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just wanna see you..

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Win, c'mon, bless up
Yeah, talkin' bout all my slide, slide, slide, slide
We came out the gutter
Like we Ninja Turtles oh yeah
Jumping over hurdles
You should check our vertical oh yeah
Got the bar now it go swish swish out the car
He assist quick Harden with the handles oh yeah
Most people hate this
But the way price is (uh-huh)
You cannot appraise it
I'ma reflect greatness
Cause I just wanna see you win

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
We can't take no elses here
Nah that's not in the plan
You don't understand I just wanna see you win
If they ain't with the squad then just leave them in the stands
You don't understand I just wanna see you win
We can't take no elses here
Nah that's not in the plan
You don't understand I just wanna see you win
If they ain't with the squad then just leave them in the stands
You don't understand I just wanna see you win
We just take our hustle and on top is where we land
We don't understand I just wanna see you win
Nah, nah I just wanna see you win
I just wanna see you
