Yeah you know it's us again

They say life is hard yeah I know you knew it
That's why we pray to God when we going through it
So blessed you know that (Achoo)

Achoo like we got a cold
Homie, the verses is cold

[Verse 2: B. Cooper]
It's B. Coop and Deraj boy
RMG, that's the whole squad
Play no games with them new hits
When that beat drops, make you Hopscotch
Walk in the studio
Punch in the clock like I'm Mayweather
In other words
I dance around the subject thinkin' things I could say better
This is the life that I live
Gymnastics, how we been making em flip
Snapback on these Hi-Hats
Think I'm a sneakerhead how I play with the Kicks
Bassline is my heart beat
Check my arteries and you'll find God
Put the watch down I took time off
Now I'm puttin on, boy I'm puttin on for my
Squad

[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
And you know you know you know
You know I always come through for the squad
And I bet you bet you know I always come through for the

Verse 3: (Derek Minor)
Creepin' through your city
Wit my team and boy we putting on
I reflect that royalty that light you see it gleam and glow
RMG you need a team
Then go ahead get at me fo'
We will never fall off
And I think that's something you should know
Co-signed by the Most High
Got a whole squad and they back me now
You might need Olajuwon, Shaq, and Dwight Howard
To back me down
Young king got a young queen
I don't play around when I wear the crown
If that's a problem, I ain't got the answer
You better ghost away and I mean right now

[Outro: Deraj]
You know you know you know
I always come through for the squad
Everytime you need me I'll be there believe me
Know Ima always come through for your squad
And I bet you bet you know I always come through for the
