We are all on trial, believe it or not
You will be judged for your sin, whether you leave it or not
So keep stacking that paper man, worship it not
See if that will be your savior when you stand before God
You see He's holy, can't let you slide by homey
Don't believe that that's true? I don't think that you really know Him
In the beginning God created the earth
Adam fell in love with sin now we dating the curse
What I'm sayin', is really that none of us can escape it
Twisted in our brains so we love it instead of hate it
If you're not perfect then you're part of the fall
Cause if you break one law, you broke them all
God would be justified if He poured His wrath on all men
Thankfully He sent his Son, we call him the God Man (Jesus)
Took a hiatus from the throne, wrapped himself in flesh, and died to atone
That's why my faith in Christ Jesus the Son
Because we all free through His blood
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I put my hope in Him who reign on the throne
He gave me grace through faith alone...
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
Now tell me this homey, what if I ran in your house
Took the pistol grip of the Glock and hit you dead in the mouth?
See my intention is to kill you but first, gimme your jewelry
In case you didn't know by now, it's a robbery
But I had tripped an alarm that was silent so the cops came
Disarmed me and you silently thank God, man
Then we get to trial and you tell the judge everything
I defiantly smile and laugh in the judge's face
I tell him "Yes sir, I'm guilty as charged
But I just can't help it judge, you know my heart"
Then he say "Well, we caught you at the scene
We'll forget about the law, we gonna let you go free"
You would say that that judge is a fool
But you expect God to do the same when He judge you
The penalty in sin is death homie, minus the hearse
There's only one way out, I'll tell you in the third verse
That's why my faith in Christ Jesus the Son
Because we all free through His blood
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I put my hope in Him who reign on the throne
He gave me grace through faith alone...
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
This is not a game
What will make you think that it is
That the Creator of all would just look over your sin, man
We all deserve death, it ain't a question about it
And see the standard is perfection, you're a goner without it
So God became man so He could walk like you and I
He was perfect, couldn't fail, yet the serpent would trial
Then he outwitted the pharisees, they charged Him with blasphemy
He was beat and humiliated for you and for me
He was nailed to a cross but took it like a strong tower
But the Father put His wrath on His son like a shower
But He rose with all power, never stayed in the grave
It was after three days, He destroyed those chains
Now we could receive grace with just faith in the Son
And return from our ways to signify that we're done
With the world, we are fugitives no more
Adopted by the Father, joint heirs to the throne
That's why my faith in Christ Jesus the Son
Because we all free through His blood
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I put my hope in Him who reign on the throne
He gave me grace through faith alone...
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
I'm not guilty, y'all got to feel me
