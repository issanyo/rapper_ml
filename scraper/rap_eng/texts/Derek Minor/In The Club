They lookin' for the bright lights, lookin' for the fame
She's checkin' out his swag, while he's lookin' at her frame
It's life up in the club, life up in the club
Life up in the club, life up in the club
Going back every weekend all this stays the same
And getting ready Saturday to do it all again
It's life up in the club, life up in the club
Life up in the club, life up in the club
That's life up in the club
They call her shoppin' bag missy misses
You so bad Gucci shoes, swagga on a thousand
Yeah she got that Louis too
You can't tell her nothin' cause she stuntin' (can I keep it real)
Gonna fill her cup up while she frontin' (man gon' keep it trill)
She don't really want you she just copin' with some problems
Sin has been her algebra, she just can't solve 'em
Club has been her Space Jam, just like Daffy
I'm tryna warn a brotha cause the club is flashy
Bright lights, bass pumpin' everything's groovin'
Next week same sin, you just keep movin'
For real it's ridiculous, how you so oblivious
Clubin' all your life away, we gon' call you frivolous
They lookin' for the bright lights, lookin' for the fame
She's checkin' out his swag, while he's lookin' at her frame
It's life up in the club, life up in the club
Life up in the club, life up in the club
Going back every weekend all this stays the same
And getting ready Saturday to do it all again
It's life up in the club, life up in the club
Life up in the club, life up in the club
That's life up in the club
He came through with a ice cold wrist already drunk off Chris
Blow that kush off in the air, man he tryna get lit
Now he buyin' up the bar, make it rain, he gon' pay the bill
But I see there's a issue, you don't mind, can I keep it real
45 years old tryna do the same thing
Girls lookin 'em at like why you ain't at home man
Identity is shot, thinking that he so hot
Spend his life off in the club, now that's the only thing he got
You been here a long time, hope you find what you were lookin' for
For 25 years, I don't think that you gon' find it folk
Focus is distorted, that's the reason for the wasted life
Why worship that vanity, you s'pposed to be chasin' Christ
They lookin' for the bright lights, lookin' for the fame
She's checkin' out his swag, while he's lookin' at her frame
It's life up in the club, life up in the club
Life up in the club, life up in the club
Going back every weekend all this stays the same
And getting ready Saturday to do it all again
It's life up in the club, life up in the club
Life up in the club, life up in the club
That's life up in the club
