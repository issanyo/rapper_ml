[Intro: Derek Minor]
I ain't got no metaphors, no similes
To explain to y'all what I've been through
Just real talk, just real me
You can see the scars I've lived through
I heard it through the grape vine
They say I'm done like cooked food
But that body's still in the oven
No clue what the chef is up to, yeah

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
All I know is they said that my pops O.D.'d
He ain't had no insurance
So that burden of buryin' fallen on me
God I need some endurance
I feel like You up in the sky and You torturin' me
Even though that that's foolish
You see all the pain that I feel like You pour it on me
I just hope I don't lose it
Cause I'm tired of buryin' my relatives
Tired of feelin' I'm failin' at everything
Cause sometimes it feel like You take away everything
It feel like You've gotta be mad at me
Are You mad at me? Do You hate me?
Are these tribulations just to break me?
Man, this can't be the reason You made me
I'm goin' crazy, won't You save me?

[Hook: J.Paul]
I'm feelin' like all I got is just ashes
You've been burnin' my whole palace to the ground
To the ground
And I don't know what You're doin'
But I'll be right here until You save me
Save me, hey won't You save me?
I need You now, I need You now
To just save me, save me
Hey won't You save me?
You can take it all, You can take it all
But just save me

[Spoken: Derek Minor]
It's like everything around me is crumbling
I feel like I'm losing my mind
Where are You God? Where are You?

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
The devil is whisperin' up in my head
End it all, end it all, yeah end it all
He's sayin' the Lord He don't want me to win
Not at all, not at all, not at all

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
See in one whole year
Lost my sister, lost my aunt, lost my dad
Wife got in a wreck, fractured her spine
Feel like evil is circlin' all that I have
Some people mishandle my business
It won't happen again
That money entrusted was took from me
But most importantly lost one of my friends
I could care less about all of this music
These numbers, opinions, and all of this fame
Just wanna be who God called me to be
And take care of [?] all in the same
I bend on my knees with these tears in my eyes
And my hands to the sky, I'm prayin' for change
Put me in fire, take all that I have
To the end of my days I'm not cursin' Your name
You're all that I have and You gave up Your Son
That is enough
It's all in Your hands and this weight is too much
I have faith in Your love
So as long as I'm alive, long as I'm alive
I'll trust You forever, forever
My faith will never die, faith will never die
For worse or for better
I know You can save me

[Hook: J.Paul]
I'm feelin' like all I got is just ashes
You've been burnin' my whole palace to the ground
To the ground
And I don't know what You're doin'
But I'll be right here until You save me
Save me, hey won't You save me?
I need You now, I need You now
To just save me, save me
Hey won't You save me?
You can take it all, You can take it all
But just save me

[Outro: J.Paul]
Save me, save me
Hey won't You save me? Save me
Save me, save me
Hey won't You save me? Save me
