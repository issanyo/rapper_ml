[Intro]
Chino
Put your hands in the air for Cardec

[Hook]
Where I'm from it ain't no heroes
That made my decision easy like a free throw (swish swish)
Come up out your pockets or I'm poppin'
Ain't no Batman no I guess I'm robbin'
Guess I'm robbin,' oh I guess I'm robbin'
Guess I'm robbin,' come up out your pockets
Guess I'm robbin,' oh I guess I'm robbin'
Guess I'm robbin', come up out your pockets, yeah

[Verse 1]
Open up the fridge, open up the fridge
Ain't nothin' but old milk and rice again
Got like 10 more days until my check hit
I don't know how I'm about to feed my kids
Guess I grab the Sig or the Draco
Run up on whoever till I die or hit my payroll
Rob this pharmacy give me the pills and don't you say no
Ratchets pointed at you, don't you move unless I say so
Do you know what these Xannies get me on the street?
Put it in the bag and leave before they call police
Too late, I see cops surrounding me
Dyin' violence or take this armed robbery
Judge sent me away for like 20 years
I said I ain't have no options he ain't tryna hear it
A menace off the street the system win again
But who gon' save us all from our environment?

[Hook]
Where I'm from it ain't no heroes
That made my decision easy like a free throw (swish swish)
Come up out your pockets or I'm poppin'
Ain't no Batman, no, I guess I'm robbin'
Guess I'm robbin,' oh I guess I'm robbin'
Guess I'm robbin,' come up out your pockets
Guess I'm robbin,' oh I guess I'm robbin'
Guess I'm robbin', come up out your pockets, yeah

[Verse 2]
Open up the fridge, open up the fridge
Ain't nothin' but old milk and rice again (Old rice again)
My mama on dope and she ain't here again (She ain't here again)
What we finna do my daddy in the pen
Guess I'll take the same route
They say college get you job but that can't help me now
I don't see no super heros swoopin' in with capes
So I'm going save us all this mask is on my face
So I'm going save us all and don't get in my way (Don't get in my way)
I'm gon' put some food on all our dinner plates
And that's the trap, that's the system that we live in
'Cause every day death knock at our door and hope don't live here
Let's pray for help tomorrow
Or makin' our decision (Right now)
Survival of the fittest
Death or join my pops in prison (Wow)
You either die a hero or live to be a villain who
Did the best he knew
But either way the cycle continues
