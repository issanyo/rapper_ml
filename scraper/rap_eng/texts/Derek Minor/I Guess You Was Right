[Verse 1: Chad Jones]
I guess you was right [4x]
I said I had something in my eye I noticed look in my rear view
I had blind spots my people gave a clear view
Through my impurities I seen I need community
Ambassador for Christ I get diplomat immunity
Some say I’m cool, fresh for a while now
Born in '84 a year after Wild Style
To be honest I was cool with doin' me
But 20 years from '84 I'm through with choosin' me
And in the meantime my past gave me goosebumps
'cause my past was full of bags like a school bus
I always like the mirror, my reflection gave me chills
Strep throat flow couldn't say I wasn't ill
I always liked me, always chose my prerogative
Do what I wanna do, other wise it's derogative
I thought I was royalty you can say elegant
Too busy smashin' the ants to ever see the elephants
Like the Poconos surrounded by water
Drownin' in my sin lead my heart to the slaughter
I know I messed up so I stand before mine
I’m slowly on this long journey, land before time

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Jones]
God you said pride was sin and sin would kill me, I guess you was right
God you said you loved me better than I could love myself
I wanna act like I’m too hard like I don’t have emotions or admit I’m wrong
And if this song is crying then I hope the tears keep flowin’

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
How I feel is wrong
I was bound to fall
I should have heard you call
Now, I’mma lose it all
See my pride’ll be the end of me
I'm my own worst enemy
I ain't know what I was in for
I really should have been gone
Dang

[Bridge: ZG]
Selfish thinking that I could do it alone
Now I'm alone, you were right, I was wrong
It's hard to admit that I'm filled with pride
I'm alive, I guess you were right

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Now people told me if I wanna get respect
Then I better go ahead and turn my swag on now
My momma said that my nose so high
If the Lord made it rain then I would drown
OK, I really hate to admit but she was right
Wasn't nothing you could do or could tell me I wasn't tight
It's like Joe Jackson, when I write
Better yet you can say I whoop mikes
Drowning in my Kool-Aid, can't drink it all
Is this the price that you pay to ball
I think the devil is clown, try to trick us all
'Cause first pride come, then the fall

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Jones]
God you said pride was sin and sin would kill me, I guess you was right
God you said you loved me better than I could love myself
I wanna act like I’m too hard like I don’t have emotions or admit I’m wrong
And if this song is crying then I hope the tears keep flowin’

[Verse 3: Canon]
Look in the past, been living to fast
Brothas giving me dap while everyone hearing me rap
I was rapping imagine a brotha given a chance
To give it all up on the stage for the one who was smashed
Saw a lady sitting up  in the back
Give Aaron the little smile from the eye contact
There was eye contact
Then I got her number then  everything fumble so I had to start from scratch
But that’s just another story how I grew up
Better remember the brotha that everybody would call a screw up
I never knew the enemy wanted to make me foolish
And doing the dum dum, the stupidest things too much
And too much and they would gather around
Simmering down, settling down and sitting me down
And I’m looking around like “what a brotha do now?”
Finna get another rebuke from the brothas around me

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Jones]
God you said pride was sin and sin would kill me, I guess you was right
God you said you loved me better than I could love myself
I wanna act like I’m too hard like I don’t have emotions or admit I’m wrong
And if this song is crying then I hope the tears keep flowin’

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
How I feel is wrong
I was bound to fall
I should have heard you call
Now, I’mma lose it all
See my pride’ll be the end of me
I'm my own worst enemy
I ain't know what I was in for
I really should have been gone
Dang

[Bridge: ZG]
Selfish thinking that I could do it alone
Now I'm alone, you were right, I was wrong
