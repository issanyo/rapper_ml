[Hook: Derek Minor]
And we ain’t did nothing, nothing at all
Ohh but we winning
So till the day that we go
You know we gon put on
We ain't losin' no more
That’s why I I I I Im gon
{Ball, Like I hit the Lotto 3x
Like I Like I Hit the lotto} 2x

[Verse 1: Canon]
My team winning
Me and my dawgs
Cause some one took the heat and that should hit us all
So I pledge allegiance, to him I follow
Because of Him im set for life just like I hit the lotto
My track record was so ruthless, ima act a fool, I'm dat nuisance
Cuz I done hit it big like I hit the lotto but I feel like I ain't got new friends
And My old partners, they don't like change
But I ain't got no  time  for no life games
And I don't mean to throw it all on ya face but I'm set in Christ and got all thangs
And I admit it, ya boy was just off a little lost
I was taking the wrong road, When sitting at the cross
It was really the blind leading the blind
So the cost was the people were falling off of the cliff into dark
Killa canon in the past
Hidden  in the crowd, living with the wild, falling in and out, tryna figure out, how to get up out
Cuz I was living in sin, Was on the bench
Now I'm coming  up off
Giving and hitting em off
My Team Winning now
And I ain't losing
In chilling like I hit up the lotto money and now I'm cruising
I tell em I do this
And then the prolly thinking that I love money homie but i ain't stupid
So don't act foolish
It's time to celebrate this like a holiday, I mess around and let that champagne bottle spray

[Hook: Derek Minor]
And we ain’t did nothing, nothing at all
Ohh but we winning
So till the day that we go
You know we gon put on
We ain't losin' no more
That’s why I I I I Im gon
{Ball, Like I hit the Lotto 3x
Like I Like I Hit the lotto} 2x

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Let me put you on sonny
Celebrating like I got dope boy money
We still raise the trophy whether Bugatti or bummy
But they still calling us losers, I'm like ain't that funny
So hi hater, nice to meet you
All this real off in the way it's kinda hard to see you
Its RMG/ 116 everytime i greet you
At Derek Minor university, it's time to teach you
Why I need worry bout bankroll, When the debt that I owed has been paid for
He erased those, wit his blood flow, I never conceal like a snub nose
So drape diamonds on neck is the reason I'm winning
Or this luxury car when I'm in it
But I make money, never let it make
Listening to my sermon, can I get a witness?
Preach, when I'm off the leash, let me get a piece
I'm a eat, when I hear a beat, that's really feast
So believe, I'm a never leave, when you looking at me
I'm a beast and I feed on the words of the king
This that turn off yo lights flow
Blackout and go off in my zone
You wanna know what am I on
That go hard until the day I'm gone, lets go

[Hook: Derek Minor]
And we ain’t did nothing, nothing at all
Ohh but we winning
So till the day that we go
You know we gon put on
We ain't losin' no more
That’s why I I I I Im gon
{Ball, Like I hit the Lotto 3x
Like I Like I Hit the lotto} 2x
