Staring at my wife, papers on the table
"You must be out your dang mind, I ain't signin' that!"
How can I watch my love go out the door, be up for grabs?
Seems like my better half wanna leave with half
What happened? It wasn't long ago
I was feelin' you in my life was what I'm longin' for
It can't be over, I ain't buyin' what you sellin'
And I know we argue, girl I feel like you, I'm tired of yellin'
Too, what they gon' think at this church that we in?
And ain't no way I'm lettin' no other man raise my kids
What's some doctor gon' tell me about my own life?
We don't need counsel; we can do it on our own, right?
When we tried it on our own, how could things just not be working out?
Where do we go from here?
And everything is broken now, it seems the sky is falling down
Where do we go from here?
Afraid to be exposed
I'm wide open, filet, that knife was sharp
We hit our knees for a long time
Now they see it all, dark parts including our heart
God, I hope that you not out of practice
They say you a surgeon, any room inside your practice?
This car crash that we call a marriage injured us
Tried to tend our own wounds, it's killing us
Thought if we just tried harder
Read books, get a little smarter
Things will be better again
But our problem is a problem you can't think or wish it away
One hope to solve it
These words I hope you heed
On your own you're destined to fail, that's a guarantee
You don't wanna be me at this table
One decision from making us together a fable
When we tried it on our own, how could things just not be working out?
Where do we go from here?
And everything is broken now, it seems the sky is falling down
Where do we go from here?
When we tried it on our own, how could things just not be working out?
Where do we go from here?
