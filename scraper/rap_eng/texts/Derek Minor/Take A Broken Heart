Verse 1:
Tears used to run down my face
Why I let my heart into this race
My emotions moving fast
100 miles about to crash
I was broken glass
Alone in my room on the ground
With so many tears I could drown
I knew I needed to get out, Yeah
Then I remembered what I heard before
I'm casting all my cares up on the Lord

Derek Minor:
Oooooooh
I been so low, boy I came from the gutter
(Came from the gutter, I came from the gutter)
See he brought me out so I can't trust another
(Faith is in You, faith is in You)
But sometimes I still got this pain on my conscience
(I still got this pain on my conscience)
That's when I'm not trusting you, no I can't stop it
You think Imma let out these haters and fakers and takers
And people that say they got your back
Then put the knife in you as you turn around
Hear me now, boy, there's no way
I should have cared my faith on you right from the start
(Turn Up)
You love me. That's who you are
He can take a broken heart
