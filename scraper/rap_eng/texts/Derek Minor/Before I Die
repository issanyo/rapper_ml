[Hook]
Before I die
I’ll be okay if I never blow
And if you never make it to a show
I know that everything come and go
But what I’m gon’ do with my life
Before I die
You say that we can never ever change, aye
I treat this world like whatever mayne, pray
Before I meet him in the sky
Then maybe I can save your life
Before I die

[Verse 1]
They say get that money, stack that paper
You wanna live forever, bet it’s something you could pay for
Got this Bentley and Bugatti, what’s the need for a savior?
And this Gucci on my body, thank you Lord for its maker
I’m like there’s gotta be more than plush living
Benz in the garage, wife with two children
Or maybe you’ll get lucky, night with two women
And on a bed of money, yeah, that’s living
As I pursued what I was told would make my life better
Closer I got I found out it made my life deader
Journeyed on this star trek, begging to be made whole
My heart became a black hole, no Captain Kirk though
Darkness surrounded me, evil confounded me
Worst part about it, it was all found in me
And what I got to live for?
What you tell your children ‘bout me in the end for?

[Hook]
Before I die
I’ll be okay if I never blow
And if you never make it to a show
I know that everything come and go
But what I’m gon’ do with my life
Before I die
You say that we can never ever change, aye
I treat this world like whatever mayne, pray
Before I meet him in the sky
Then maybe I can save your life
Before I die

[Verse 2]
And maybe before my last breath
You will see a man that finished the race and ran hard until his last step
Whether it’s cash left
I know my seed will be the branches of a tree of a legacy that their dad left
And let that legacy be rooted in the cross
Let nothing else be taught, lest I fall and be lost
If I fall and be lost then use it as a story
What a man should never be, introduce them to your glory
Before I die, I just gotta be in you so
After my death they can rejoice at my funeral
‘Cause I’ll be still alive, new body I’m inside
If your faith is in the Lord, then this is not goodbye
But see you later, I’m going to see the Savior
In awe of his majesty, I bow before the Maker
When I move on, let the earth hear this song
And know that you are King on the throne, I’m gone

[Hook]
Before I die
I’ll be okay if I never blow
And if you never make it to a show
I know that everything come and go
But what I’m gon’ do with my life
Before I die
You say that we can never ever change, aye
I treat this world like whatever mayne, pray
Before I meet him in the sky
Then maybe I can save your life
Before I die
