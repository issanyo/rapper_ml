[Chorus]
What am I to do
When I've tried it all
And everything just falls apart
It just falls apart
What am I to do
When I've tried it all
And everything just falls apart
It just falls part
That's when I call on you, call on you
That's when I call on you, I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you, call on you
That's when I call on you, I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you

[Verse 1]
I've been broken and thrown away
Lost in regret without a trace
Come find me now
Yeah, come find me now
When did the storm arose at the joy, my heart
I'm longing for you
Yea, I'm longing for you
I endure the weather now
Your love is my tether now
Hold me together now
This pain won't last forever now
Making me whole
When agony is smooth as a criminal
Yes, you arrested my soul
Bringing me home, bringing me home
Bringing me closer to you
Bringing me closer to truth
Bringing me closer to see who I really am
Nothing to prove
Things fall apart, things fall apart
My faith in you, you are the glue
That's who you are (I know it)

[Chorus]
What am I to do
When I've tried it all
And everything just falls apart
It just falls apart
What am I to do
When I've tried it all
And everything  just falls apart
It just falls apart
That's when I call on you, call on you
That's when I call on you, I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you, call on you
That's when I call on you, I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you

[Verse 2]
Now I need your light
Cause I've been in a dark place
Sometimes I wear a mask
Because I'm just trying to save face
I've been through hell
The flames have froze my heart
Fragments from shattered dreams tear me apart
That's when I can't swim
I'm thinking about my mistakes
That's when you flood in
And then I'm swept away (by your love)
I'm reminded I'm not alone
Reminded I got a home (that's with you)
I'm reminded I don't have to worry
As long as you're on the throne
I believe it

[Chorus]
What am I to do
When I've tried it all
And everything just falls apart
It just falls apart
What am I to do
When I've tried it all
And everything just falls apart
It just falls apart
That's when I call on you, call on you
That's when I call on you, I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you, call on you
That's when I call on you, I call on you
That's when I call on you
That's when I call on you
