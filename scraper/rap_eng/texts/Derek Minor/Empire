[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I live my life like I'm a live forever
Like whatever or whenever, just don't tell me never
I can tell that there's some people that won't see me better
But greatness in our DNA, He ain't made us for failure
Uh, we live our dreams while you sleep walkin'
That sound of destiny too loud so I can't hear you talkin'
They said, "Minor, we be waiting on that fire often"
I'm tryin' to cremate a beat, it won't even see a coffin
Yeah, I bet you think that this that braggin' flow
Talk about some stuff that you ain't got, impress the masses flow
That sell your soul, you can buy your home that's massive flow
Thinkin' to myself, what's a mansion to a castle though?

[Hook: Traneshia "Truth" Chiles]
And now You've given us a new beginnin'
You placed us high above
And there's nothin' that's bringin' us down
This is our empire, empire
This is our empire, empire

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
I see so many problems
The Lord teachin' me patience, feelin' like I'm back in college
I'm learnin' most my issues have to do with economics
But my anger makin' me wanna go and do trigonomics, true
I'm just tellin' y'all where I'm at
Tellin' y'all that I need grace
And I'm still leanin' on that
Doc been worried 'bout me that's my dog
He think I'm probably gon' snap
Now I'm talkin' to God a whole lot lately
I'm findin' comfort in that
I'm findin' comfort in that
He said, "Don't you worry 'bout none of this
You actin' like I don't run none of this
You actin' like I'mma put all of this on you
And ain't no way you overcomin' this
My empire never will run out of nothin'
Cuz I am the one who is fundin' this
Just do what I told you to do
Give it all that you got and you risin' above in this"

[Hook]

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
And where we goin' we won't need the sun
Cause You gon' light the whole world with Your love
So shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
They said that we won't need the sun
Cause You gon' light the whole world with Your love
So shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me

[Hook]
