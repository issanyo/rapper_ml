[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Whoa, our Father who art in heaven
Devil walk 'round with that Mac 11
Devil walk 'round with that packs he selling
I'm just trying to eat with all my brethren
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
God bless the trap

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I am posted where they murkin,' got them tools just like construction
Snipe you in your drop top Mustang, now you run 'round headless horseman
Seen right there, play the loop, chose to comment on the post
They'll say "you should put them savage monkeys right back on the boat"
They won't talk about how we in these streets and everybody poor
They won't talk 'bout how we can't get jobs and all we got is dope
That's that woo that drive you crazy when you trying to feed your babies
They just trying to jail and chain me, CCA trying to trade me, yeah

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Whoa, our Father who art in heaven
Devil walk 'round with that Mac 11
Devil walk 'round with that packs he selling
I'm just trying to eat with all my brethren
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
God bless the trap

[Verse 2: Tony Tillman]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul You keep
Bring salvation to the street
Forgive 'em they just tryna eat
All done sister let us pray
Please don't let the .40 spray
Can't afford to pay for grace
Don't let 'em die before they wake
They hopeless 'fore they focus on the mil'
Posted, sellin' dope to play the bills
Bogus only way they know to live
Lord and they don't know that you forgive
Your mercy on they soul to hold a deal
Even smokers on the coke and pills
I seen 'em roll but they don't know Your will
Bless the trap and let 'em know you're real

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Whoa, our Father who art in heaven
Devil walk 'round with that Mac 11
Devil walk 'round with that packs he selling
I'm just trying to eat with all my brethren
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
God bless the trap

[Verse 3: Thi'sl]
Sitting in Maverick's Impala, feelin' like 8 Ball
'Round here, we just tryna escape the pitfalls
Crime rate high as they think, tryna evade laws
Either you got a dope hoop game or you slang walk, game raw
Have 'em out with the O.G's, before he turn 16
Tryna come up on the block
Tryna take a half ounce, whip it up, turn it to a whole thing
Mama praying that he stop
Mama praying that the God she serve gon' give him a holla
But the chances of them hollow tips gon' make Momma holla

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Whoa, our Father who art in heaven
Devil walk 'round with that Mac 11
Devil walk 'round with that packs he selling
I'm just trying to eat with all my brethren
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
God bless the trap
