[Intro: Thi'sl]
Mic' check one, two
Can y'all hear me out there
Let's go

[Verse 1: Thi'sl]
Let's get it popping, I'm all in
I been in the kitchen whipping, where y'all been?
Been sitting back from a distance, watched the world spin
Now it's time for me to open up and chime in
I hear ‘em talk, they say they grind
I see they movement, I say they lyin'
They say it's dark, I say let's shine
Look at my watch, it said it's time
They say I'm crazy, I lost my mind
I say they right, now fall in line
They tried to leave me dead out on the block
But I'm here and I'm now ‘bout to turn this thang up and let it knock

[Hook: Thi'sl]
They hear it comin', let it knock(x5)
They hear it comin'
Let your windows down and turn it up until it pop
Just let it knock!
I don't think you really know what we came up in here to do(x4)

[Verse 2: Thi'sl]
Was on the edge, out my mind
Every day chasin' dollar signs
Hustle hustle, that's all I knew
But I'm from Hustle City, that's what we do
I should be in the pen like Larry Hoover
For flippin' work, bangin' Rugers
13, I was a shooter
But Jesus saved my life, hallelujah
This for my derrties and all my dawgs
That's in the pen never comin' home
Watch close ‘cause the race is on
Flame told me black out on ‘em go off in the zone
‘Cause I hear ‘em talk but they ain't sayin' nothin'
The radio be on but they ain't playin' nothin'
That's why we had to take this to the block
Told ‘em crank it till it pop, go'n and crank that thang up and let it knock

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
You say you hard, I suggest you stop
I'm guessin' it must be Legos if you on the block
See it's all good till somebody gets shot
Then we find out invincible is something you not
Turn on my radio, why did I hit you with gin in the middle of danger?
Then everything change when the chopper get to pop-pop-poppin' kinda like a drum major
BLOW!! BULLET!! BLA-BLA-BLOW!! That ain't no sound that you hear
It's the sound of a life with destruction that come to an end, that should be something you fear
That's why I rep the Lord, his power turns us into soldiers
The city streets will wreck your life, bulldozers
I introduce you to the Christ boy if you don't know him
Stay on my grind kinda like coffee, Folgers
It's a shame that we die for fame and then the life we lived amount to nothin'
Christ is gain down for his name, best believe that I stand for somethin'
I fight to know him whether it's cool or not
And if you feel the same turn the music up and let it knock

[Outro: Thi'sl]
Let your windows down and turn it up until it pop, just let it knock!!
