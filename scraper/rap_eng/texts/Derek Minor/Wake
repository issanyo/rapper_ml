[Hook 1: Jacque Jordan]
Close your eyes, and rest they say
But I’ll sleep, when I’m dead
My dreams won’t build themselves
Laying brick is harder than, hoisting sails

[Verse 1: B. Cooper]
Yeah
Don’t get me wrong, love my friends and family
They don’t know how to handle me
Hear me rapping on random beats
I know they want the best, told me to give up on dreams
Chase a check, a salary, time to face reality
Cause one day, I’ll finish penning this tragedy
Rent still gotta get paid, electricity isn’t free
And I know that giving up, nah, that ain’t me
Work hard, no time to breathe, insomniac, no I can’t sleep
So I guess that means I’ve gotta chase it
So close I can taste it, had to learn to pace it
Mix His amazing grace with all my determination
Put my clock through detox, sick of time being wasted
Cause this is what I was born for
If you never take a shot, no points up on the scoreboard
Can’t breathe with- out it, if I slept on it I’d snore more
Never royal, this fantasy I’m living is yours, Lord

[Hook 1]
Close your eyes, and rest they say
But I’ll sleep, when I’m dead
My dreams won’t build themselves
Laying brick is harder than, hoisting sails

[Verse 2: Deraj]
Yo
Aiiiiiii!
So many fall asleep, when I’m really trying to give all of me
I’m trying to make it so they all can see
I’m called to be the artery to pump life through a harmony
With more heat than the sunshine
And my heart beat like a drum line
And it won’t stop, until we march to the beat of the drum
The beat of the drum, until we’re all free to become
Who we’re supposed to be
And the hope you see is contagious
You ought to get close to me, I know
You want to go to sleep, you know I know
You ain’t got to tell me, you know I know
But we got to make a choice
Because it gets dark sometimes
It’s black or white, dark or light
But you in between, we need open eyes
Because it’s fight or flight
Fire flies in the wind to open minds
To open doors open blinds
Overtime will open eyes
Lean in, lean in to the deep end
Why you trying to sleep in on the weekend
Why you trying to pull back on the reach in
Why you want to react on the defense
Like you got something to prove
But I’m giving you the green light
All the other haters be like, nobody did it before
So I guess I got to get up before the break of dawn
So I can make this song, hoping one day you can sing-along
And from my cardiac, I wrote this for the insomniacs

[Hook 2: Jacque Jordan]
Wake up, wiggle your toes
Your shoes got more soul, than what lies below
Wake up, wiggle your toes
Your shoes got more soul, than what lies below

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
Yeah
Told y'all I just wanted to get these dreams out
Let me show you where it all started
Follow me
8th grade I bought a 8 track mixer
And made a album with it
And I ain’t have a lot of money or experience
But I guarantee my whole soul was in it
In college learning music business just wasn’t enough
Plus I paid my bills with mix tapes that I sold out of my trunk
I had raggedy cars, raggedy clothes, cause all of my dough
Went to audio cards, drum machines, and new microphones
Sacrificed while all my peers out partied and sleeped
Turn these speakers with my music up
Hope they wake up my dreams
I done worked so hard crafting this gifted that God put in my life
So if you sleep on me, I hope and pray you toss and turn all night
How dare fix your lips to tell me what I am gone be
With or without Reach, just RMG, it’s still God holding me
Long as Christ got me, Doc got me, Canon, Tone, Chad Jones got me
B. Coop , Deraj got me, we ain’t worried 'bout one thang got me
Still got love for Reach records, my family till I’m gone
But for the rest of y’all that’s wondering, the dreams still move on
Minor!
