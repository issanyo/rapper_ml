[Verse 1: Aaron Cole]
25 on the rack
Bringing all the truth back
Everybody we know
We never on no slack
And we don't need no friends
Only ride wit my day ones
Jesus my main one
I been on the low for the longest now tryna make thru
Yeah my team we the strongest now different kind of crew
Everybody know I'm on it now ya boi is making moves
And God be on our side so you know we never lose
Never lose
Everyday a miracle so you know I gotta work boi I'm taking advantage
I'm talking on another level talking fast talking strong like I'm speaking in Spanish
Steph Curry we don't sea sho
Going for the ship and we 3-0
You deandre at the free throw
I wish you would Home Depot

[Hook: Aaron Cole]
I just gotta do what I gotta do yea
I know he watching me so I gotta move up
We taking all the jumpers with this follow thru oh
Get focused on this level what you oughta do (x2)

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Me and Aaron Cole, Dirty Rice
Boi you know it's gone be raw
So I barbecue a beat sweet baby rays know I got the sauce
Kids gotta eat
That's the realest thing that I ever said
Cause when it come down to this right here
I don't mess around like it's a first date
Only competition staring in the mirror
And I gotta kill em just to be a winner
I am not suicidal but I am liable to go kamikaze
I'ma catch a body
That's a body for the body
Wrestle like karate rate rate
Master P empowered by the body
Standing taller than Yao Ming
Gotta go to outer space to stop me
Why would you ever try to stop me
You better find a different rocket
This is that we are not losing you know I'ma do what I gotta
I'm still here thank the Lord that he been gracious
That's RMG
Reflect God Reflect Greatness

[Hook: Aaron Cole]
I just gotta do what I gotta do yea
I know he watching me so I gotta move up
We taking all the jumpers with this follow thru oh
Get focused on this level what you oughta do (x2)

[Verse 3: Aaron Cole]
These artists want my managers
These managers wanting me
I know we on our grind
But take several seats
Cause ain't nobody gon break us
God don't make mistakes so he put on this team cause this was pose to be my place
So I'm grinding till I'm on the tv screen sitting on Ellen
We only take W's we ain't taking no more l-ing
How my team roll got these dudes you sitting scary
They Thought that we was out they wrote my obituary
I can't believe God drafted me on the winning team and thats ten fo
Jumping over hurdles run away from murtles like I'm Eddie Winslow
Every day's a miracle I just thank God that I'm living it out
Tryna make a change but I gotta change lotta things that I'm still figuring out

[Hook: Aaron Cole]
I just gotta do what I gotta do yea
I know he watching me so I gotta move up
We taking all the jumpers with this follow thru oh
Get focused on this level what you oughta do (x2)
