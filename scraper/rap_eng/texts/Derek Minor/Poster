[Intro: Nobigdyl]
Yea, Yea, Yea
Yea
Whoah
(It's Indie Tribe!)
Yea

[Pre-Chorus: Nobigdyl]
Walking 'round looking sad for
This the life you ask for
Play the role you cast for
Just slap the hate off the backboard
Walking 'round looking sad for
This the life you ask for
Play the role you cast for
Just slap the hate off the backboard

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
Try to post up, put you on a poster
Try to post up, put you on a poster
On a poster, put you on a poster yeah
On a poster, put you on a poster yeah

[Verse 1: Nobigdyl]
Pull the strings like Guitar Center
Got the juice like the bartender
Slap the hate off the backboard
Indie Tribe, gotta start center
Forever young like Bart Simpson
This arson and the art did it
God got me, He all in it
The flood came and the ark wit it
24 with the grind, Jack Bauer
Lord of the Rings, Two Towers
See the dread on my head, Rocket Power
Blessing rain down in showers
If I mess up, that's a lesson I get educated, yea
All my stressin' come from blessings
I can't even hate it

[Pre-Chorus: Nobigdyl]
Walking 'round looking sad for
This the life you asked for
Play the role you cast for
Just slap the hate off the backboard
Walking 'round looking sad for
This the life you asked for
Play the role you cast for
Just slap the hater off the backboard

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
Try to post up, put you on a poster
Try to post up, put you on a poster
On a poster, put you on a poster yeah
On a poster, put you on a poster yeah

[Verse 2: Aaron Cole]
I'm in my rare prime
Don't have no spare time
Don't need a hairline
Cause I got the air time
In His image feelin' swell
I'm at home with myself
This for the gold, for the belt
Michael Phelps, who's Michael Phelps?
Stevie Wonder with the vibes, shoot it when I'm blind
Comin' down the court with no defender in my eyes
It's so easy I been doin' reps since I was five
It's like ABC's, yea, yea, Jackson 5, ay
God told me to go, yeah
He made me, you did not though
Always push for the mo
Break the backboard

[Pre-Chorus: Nobigdyl]
Walkin' around lookin sad for
This the life you ask for
Play the role you cast for
Just slap the hate off the backboard
Walkin' around lookin sad for
This the life you asked for
Play the role you cast for
Just slap the hater off the backboard

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
Try to post up, put you on a poster
Try to post up, put you on a poster
On a poster, put you on a poster yeah
On a poster, put you on a poster yeah
