[Hook: Derek Minor]
Play the game 4 quarters, yeah I keep it one hundred (4x)
Real recognize real, recognize real
Real recognize real, real recognize real
Real recognize real, recognize real
Real recognize real, real recognize real

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
The whole truth, nothing but it
Ben Franklin my witness, boy I keep it one hundred
So if I say I ain’t playing, ain’t no flashin' or frontin’
I got the ball, I cut my legs off before I punt it
Bruh said that we fake, I don’t know where he heard that
Probably met some pulpit pimp with a perm and a Cadillac
No I ain’t like him at all, I am not perfect dawg
But even when I fall, I know Christ paid it all
And I preach that, only hope so I teach that
Co-signed by that boy Lecrae, so I guess you say that I Reached that
I’ma try to live what I talk about until they pit my coffin out
And if I’m wrong I call it out so you can see what my God about
I don’t want you to think that I’m perfect
I just want you to see the Lord is worth it
All I got is his grace and mercy
And guess what, boy? I don’t deserve it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Aye y’all so unfamiliar, I ain’t never seen you bro
And where you say I know you from? And who you say you know I know?
It’s one thing I can’t take, a fraudulent fake when it come to faith
And I ain’t flawless, ain’t the standard
But I’ma show enough be a living example
Ol’ Saints came in and laid the tracks
Blood, sweat and tears, skin off they backs
These new cats here tryna ride the train
And folks hopping on telling lies and things
Trying to derail with false details, everybody looking like we fail
I seen your kind for a long time, you fake Gucci, no retail
Y’all don’t fool me with empty rhymes, cliché words, preachy lines
Everybody here been made homie, can’t nobody vouch for your life in grind
Who discipled you? Where you serving, mayne?
What ya reading, bruh? What ya learning, mayne?
Listen we ain’t even in no gang, but this thing realer then the set you claim
Look, this ain’t some Faith I made
Faith made me, you could tell I’m changed
You probably wondering why the folk look at you strange
You a stranger, they never heard your name

[Hook: Derek Minor]

[Verse 3: Pettidee]
Real recognize real, pushers recognize deal
Predators recognize prey, killers recognize kill
You thought you was a real gangster
In a jeep then they rolled up on you with a .45
Shot that boy in the club, now you in the parking lot and it’s ‘bout to get live
Homeboy is ‘bout the west side, yo kinfolk get riders’ lives
Fist to the face, gun go out, take that air, ridin’ high
Now you come back to your Father raising your hands high
I won’t return to my vomit, stand up with the men of Christ
Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth, the Life, that’s the Author and Father
Greater is he that’s in me than choppers poppin’ and stop ya
Don’t die in these streets, you are purposed for something
If they tear down your hood and change your block
Then the game was all for nothing
Bangers, thugs, killers, drugs, dealers too happy to bleed
The aftermath of willingness, we refusin’ to read
Is there eternal life, turnin’ from Christ and you still
Live like hell and see heaven? Nope, THAT AIN’T REAL
