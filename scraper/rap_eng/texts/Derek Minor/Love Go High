[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Life is like a movie
You can never press rewind
And you never want to lose it
You'll love it when you find
I wanna show you in my airplane, baby
Make our love touch the sky
Show that you're loyal my baby
Follow me, let love go high
Let love go high {8x} (2x)

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Let's hop on a plane, ?
Over seas, outta space, it donâ€™t even matter
Passport, tattoo, yeah you know we do
But I feel like I'm home babe as long as I'm with you yeah
Ri-riding in the old school (old school)
Leather seats look like tofu
Girl, you know I need you like '02
Yeah, girl you know I need you like '02
I've been righteous to the top right now
But from day one, you've been though (you've been though)
Finally got things right right now

[Verse 2]
I've been on the road, show right after show
You've been all alone, so I can't wait to get home
Even when I'm not around
Anchor, yeah she hold me down
I be always out of town
But you ain't got nothin' to worry 'bout
