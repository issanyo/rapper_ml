[Hook: Hollyn]
I bet you just want to let your light shine
It feel like you been waiting for the right time
This is your moment, moment, moment
It's time to change the world

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
We are the brightest
We wonâ€™t succumb to the darkness
The Lord knows we need light right now
You know He's calling, cryin' out from the mountain
Telling us to come home right now
You're my brother (woah, woah, woah)
We don't have to fight anymore
Oh, brother (woah, woah, woah)
None of us win in this war

[Pre-Hook: Derek Minor]
Beautiful people don't you know your made in his image
The image of greatness?
Why don't we see His reflection inside one another
And all of our faces?

[Hook: Hollyn]
I bet you just want to let your light shine
It feel like you been waiting for the right time
This is your moment, moment, moment, moment
This is your moment, moment, moment
It's time to change the world

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for?
But you know it's no time to waste, better get up
I know you're made for more
Oh yeah, you're made for more
Even when our hope is lost, never let up
You're my brother (woah, woah, woah)
What are we fighting for?
I know to know brother (woah, woah, woah)
None of us win in this war

[Pre-Hook: Derek Minor & Hollyn]
Beautiful people don't you know your made in his image
The image of greatness?
Why don't we see His reflection inside one another
And all of our faces?

[Hook: Hollyn & Derek Minor]
I bet you just want to let your light shine
It feel like you been waiting for the right time
This is your moment, moment, moment, moment
This is your moment, moment, moment
It's time to change the world

[Outro: Derek Minor & Hollyn]
World, world, world, world

World, world, world, world

World, world, world, world
(Time to change the world, time to change the world
Time to change the world)
