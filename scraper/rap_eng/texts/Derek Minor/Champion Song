I'll be a champion, just let me fight
All that you meant in wrong, I'll make it right
You don't have to worry about a thing
I'll be a champion, just let me fight
All that you meant in wrong, I'll make it right
You don't have to worry about a thing
Trust me with your faith, I'll make it all OK
Long for the days and pain to go away
The earth will be restored and the King will take his place
I know he reign but I yearn for the glory days
When he come back to earth and wash the sin away
Look how we livin' with murder and dope dealin'
The rich get richer, the poor keep stealin'
And television murders the identity of women
They give they soul away for a little bit of attention
And I wrestle with all this tension
'Cause sometimes I don't even know my own intentions
I mean, I wanna serve Christ with the best of me
But it seem the sin is eating the rest of me
And I keep giving away the recipe
But swear that this old man is dead to me
'Cause I hear God say, "that's not my way"
It's a brand new day, walk in faith, aye
I'll be a champion, just let me fight
All that you meant in wrong, I'll make it right
You don't have to worry about a thing
Trust me with your faith, I'll make it all OK
