Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute
Come on Ride with me, Ride on with me down this lane [x2]
Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute
Ride with me down this lane
Stand with here for a moment
See if you can bear my pain
Walk in my shoes for a minute
Ride with me down this lane
Stand with me here for a moment
See if you can bear my pain


[Verse 1 : Derek Minor]
Ok, Black on black Crime, Black on black violence
We don't talk to police
That's black on black silence
Living  in Hell here we are just living on welfare
When everybody is broke, you fear for your welfare
Ah! Look at them thugs, how dangerous they are with gun in hand
Look at them ghetto girls twerking on that instagram
Don't bring them to our church cause we  don't want that Riff Raff
What do you expect when most of us grew up wishing for dads
No jobs in our Community, people losing hope
Why you think he on that corner selling dope?
And now accord its a plan, We were chained on that boat
See America left our right we still hanging from the rope
And I promise
Wanna leave it in the past, but it's hard
Cause I just seen an unarmed teen shot down like a dog
I just pray you hear my heart
Cause it's heavy when I'm rapping
See the reason for this song, is that I'm asking


[Hook: Roz]
Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute
Come, Ride with me, Ride on with me down this lane [x2]
Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute
Ride with me down this lane
Stand with here for a moment
See if you can bear my pain
Walk in my shoes for a minute
Ride with me down this lane
Stand with me here for a moment
See if you can bear my pain
Oh I'm hurting, I'm ashamed
And I'm wondering, Do you know my Pain
Oh I'm hurting, I'm ashamed
And I'm wondering, Do you ever know my Pain


[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
And I'm convinced that we should love one another
Regardless of our opinion, we all bleed the same color
We're made in the image of God and no other
It's clear the world is hurt but I could tell you  Daddy love us (love us)
So even if you hate me, Imma Love you
Imma heal your heart and tell the Lord take this pain from you
Imma Pray for you, Imma feel your struggle
You gonna feel mine
Imma Walk with You, I walk with you

[Hook: Roz]
Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute
Come, Ride with me, Ride on with me down this lane [x2]
Why don't you walk in my shoes for a minute
Oh I'm hurting!
