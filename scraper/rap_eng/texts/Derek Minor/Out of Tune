[Hook: Derek Minor]
I know you heard this song
You say I sang it wrong
I don't know what's going on
The world thinks I'm all out of tune
I know you heard this song
You say I sang it wrong
I don't know what's going on
The world thinks I'm all out of tune
Oh no, don't tune me up (x8)

[Verse 1: Canon]
No no no!
Do re me fa so la te do!
Can't nobody tune me to living in the world
My faith been rooted deep watch me grow
Oh no! cop that Benz
Got money? nope, and no ends!
Spend it on Sallie Mae on that 10th
And if you like me you still paying that rent
I got a bill to pay, No time to floss on my street
I still need dental care I need braces
The only thing I'm flossing down is my teeth
And no my girl ain't got no girlfriend it
Ain't no pop that never no twerking
Oh she work it yes she work that p31 verse oh so perfect
Talking like bad women all over me
My foreign chick from overseas
Big boss with that Fantom
They pockets chunky like flowetry
Well I done heard it all and that's weak sauce
Who gives a bird what yo piece cost
Your Audemar and your Cartiers
And your Aston Martin just cheap talk

[Hook: Derek Minor]
I know you heard this song
You say I sang it wrong
I don't know what's going on
The world thinks I'm all out of tune
I know you heard this song
You say I sang it wrong
I don't know what's going on
The world thinks I'm all out of tune
Oh no, don't tune me up (x8)

[Bridge]
Oh the world think I'm all out of tune
Oh the world think I'm all out of tune
Oh no, don't tune me up (x8)

[Verse 2: Deraj]
Do re, do re, excuse me
I'mma do this thing way off key
Yeah, you can just hair-do you
If it's cool that I do re mi
I cross my i's and I dot my t's
If you got a problem speak up now
Or forever ever just hold your peace
I'm saying, it's raining outside
That's why I'm going in
And I'm so good at being myself
Cause I told myself that I won't pretend
And I won't pretend that I'm something I'm not
And I'm definitely not going to look like him
Or look like her, or look like them
Man I'm good in the skin I'm iiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnn!
I held that out too long
And I know I got some haters
Probably say that that was wrong
But I'm not afraid
I promise y'all I'm not afraid
That Pharaoh died I'm not a slave
Da da da, de de de

I know you heard this song
You say I sang it wrong
I don't know what's going on
The world thinks I'm all out of tune
Oh no, don't tune me up (x8)
