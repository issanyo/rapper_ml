[Pre-Hook]
You probably won't like it
But, I'll be the bad guy
The real, ain't gon' love it
The faith, they gon' despise
Why? Cuz' they say whatever
I tell the truth
Hand on the bible
Yeah, I tell the
I tell the
I tell the

[Hook: Derek Minor]
Truth
Hand on the bible, I tell the truth
Hand on the bible, yeah, I tell the truth
Yeah, I tell the truth
Hand on the bible, I tell the truth

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
I'm just trying to keep it honest
I'm just trying to let you know
We just trying to keep it real
We just sticking to the code
I know I'm probably gon' let you down
I am not the one to put your faith in
I am not a role model
I am just a bad guy that he changing

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Got a enough dirt to build a pyramid
I got sin darker than my skin
I'm just trying to live my life for Him
I'm just praying God let me in
Feeling like I'm outside the gates
I've been trying to call the Lord on two phones
Really, really, if you knew what's in me
You would talk less, and pray way more
Sometimes, I just wanna ball on every single hater
Stunt on you, stunt on you, woo!
Trying to get the money and make it solve the problem like a calculator
Like I'm David Ruffin, I'm surrounded by all these temptations
You should understand I am just a man who really need the savior
Hand on the bible, it's true

[Pre-Hook]
You probably won't like it
But, I'll be the bad guy
You really gon' love it
Your faith, they gon' despise
Why? Cuz' they say whatever
I tell the truth
Hand on the bible
Yeah, I tell the
I tell the
I tell the

[Hook: Derek Minor]
Truth
Hand on the bible, I tell the truth
Hand on the bible, yeah, I tell the truth
Yeah, I tell the truth
Hand on the bible, I tell the truth

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Wait a minute
Give me 60 seconds to tell you why I'm here
Please let me finish
If I'm on trial, I call God to the stand as my witness
If he'll tell you that my only innocence is his Son tho
Pay attention for the rundown
If we all honest, we are all flawed
What's the point pretending that I'm any different?
I am just a sinner that's in need of grace
That is true precision, that is Realigion
I'm tired of being who you think I am
Tired of being who you want me to be
Fronting in all these interviews then pray to God that you like me
Take me as I am or don't get me at all
You can buy my albums, but my soul is not for ya'll
Meaning your money won't change me
I keep it 1000, one million till my spirit float through the ceiling
Till they plant me in a cemetery next to Granny Betty
I'm at peace with God, I ain't really worried

[Pre-Hook]
You probably won't like it
But, I'll be the bad guy
The real, ain't gon' love it
The faith, they gon' despise
Why? Cuz' they say whatever
I tell the truth
Hand on the bible
Yeah, I tell the
I tell the
I tell the truth

[Outro]
I tell the truth

I tell the truth
(Let's just be honest)

(Let's just be honest)
I tell the truth
