[Intro: Trip Lee]
Look at that, what you lookin' at
Look at that, what you lookin' at
Look at that, what you lookin' at

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
In a culture that is crazy, in a world that is fallen
Its hard tryna live this thang according to Your callin
Every time steppin at my heart it's steady prowlin
Desires wagin war back n forth like they brawlin
Yea man hold up, I'm hopin when you see me
That you catch me watchin what I'm watchin it ain't easy
My heart it wants to see joy, but there's too many decoys
And I don't wanna end up in a trap like a dboy
Can't be all relaxed, there ain't no time for getting lazy
Time for us to act cause the times are getting crazy
So I wrote an agreement and I made my eyes sign it
I won't look on a woman with no lust now underline it

[Hook: Trip Lee]
Look at that, what you lookin at
Oooo she lookin; good
Nah man I ain't lookin back
I'm watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thing hard
Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard
Look at dat, what you lookin at
Oooo she lookin good nah man I ain't lookin back
Im watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thing hard
Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Now if I listen to the radio
Then I would have to split open the swisha and fill it with green vine
And if I listen to the TV then you can catch me chasin plenty chicks cause homie they fine
But I DDT my mind put my flesh in the figure four
Yea sometimes I fall but this right here ain't gon kill me folk
Cause if I had to be a blind amputee, I guarantee my Father here is purging me of all my impurity
Bang on em ba-bbang on go hard Father rain on em ra-rrain on em show you God
Cause every time I slow up, that's when my Father show up
Make make ways of escape then I'm right back scrappin like what up
Tell my TV to shutup what you sellin I don't want it
Hide that Word inside my heart, Ron Artest go & guard it no
I don't want your goodies baby you can keep your cookies lady
I know they got M&MS but this road I'm on is slim and shady

[Hook: Trip Lee]

[Bridge: Trip Lee]
With every single glance man my sin tries to kill me
So I ain't givin in all my brothers gotta feel me
I'm free from my slavery you know that ain't the real me
I belong to my God and I can't let no lust steal me
There's nothing I can gain the sister shouldn't move me
Cause my God is holy the epitome of beauty
Bought me with a price and I'm prayin He would rule me
My eyes belong to Him He's my King and Lord truly
As men who trust Jesus, we can't be cool wit all dat
So when my eyes start to trip, I tell em boys to fall back
So if you see me look away don't be surprised
Since I'm in love with my God, I got some covenant eyes

[Hook: Trip Lee]
