Let's go
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones

[Chorus]
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
Ohhhhh
We about what we say
But you knew that anyway
But you knew that anyway

[Verse 1]
I look around it's a drought of the real right now
They dying of thirst, it's a drought of the real right now
I can't be chameleon, I can't wear a mask in pursuit of the millions (in pursuit of the millions)
I know who I am and I just be myself, that's the reason they feel it (they feel me now)
How I'm a talk about
How God can change all of these people now (how)
If I'm only real in His steeple now? (steeple now)
And don't live out none what I talk about?
I only surround myself with the people that keep it one thousand (that keep it one thousand)
I'm not getting younger, got no time to waste if you not really 'bout it (you gotta be 'bout it)
Ohhhhh
We about what we say
This true religion, but you can't buy this at the store though, you dodo (you dodo)
It's priceless (priceless)
I still live it if I'm micless (if I'm micless)
On top of the mountain or crisis (crisis)
RMG movement ignite

[Chorus]
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
Ohhhhh
We about what we say
But you knew that anyway
But you knew that anyway

[Verse 2]
Everybody know I'm putting on for my dogs
Everybody know I'm putting on for the cross
The way I kill the beat, y'all gone have to call the law
Go get queen latifah I'm about to set if off
Good gracious, I been running all out of patience
If you want the real, boy, I got it by the cases
Gimme one shot, boy, I might will take it
Be it, be a hit like Mike Will made it (oh Lord)
I ain't bragging, I'm just telling y'all (y'all better listen up)
This one here for God, I'm a give my all
And I ain't scared to talk about it, I'm a talk about it
How many people almost died, but live to talk about it
They thought that I was dead and put this chalk around me
They forgot the Lord, He got His arms around me
RMG a navy, better yet a army
So let me talk my talk, you could never harm me
My life in His hands, oh my life in His hands I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I boast in His goodness that's why I'm still here, that's the end of discussion
I reflect His greatness, I reflect His greatness, might be why you hate it
We strong in His mercy, we strong in His mercy, that's why you can't break us

[Chorus]
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
I got a team full of real ones
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)
But you knew that anyway
