Now whatchu know about coastin'?
Mash in the gas down to the west coast and back
Yeah I'm broke but the flows intact
And I don't need nothin' else but that, yeah, yeah
So I can tell the world the Lord is great
Look at everything that he made, and every time I wake
I pray he get the glory till my wake
And they'll say that I died with faith, now give me grace
Wait, I don't deserve it, no I'm not worth it
Even if I was workin' no way that I could earn it
It's beyond me, my pocket's ain't deep enough
That's why I'm honorin' the Lord when I'm speakin', bruh
For every time my wife is cookin' in the kitchen
And the smell is so terrific that's a picture of his grace
Fried chicken, collard greens, yeah I'm with it
But it 's mercy that's allowin' me to taste, great
Summer, spring, winter and fall, we get it all
And my lungs keep me breathin' homie with no thoughts
I got the church relationships is beautiful
We the body, brains to the cuticle
To give my life away is unusual
But that was it's design, other ways unfruitful
I just wrote this here for all you to know
That faith placed other than Christ is el stupido
El stupido
