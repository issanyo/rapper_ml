[Hook: Derek Minor]
I don't fit into your in-crowd
I gotta be who I am now
I don't got no chains on me now
No I don't fit into your in-crowd

Long as we living I'm good
Breath in my lungs so I'm good
God is with us so I'm good
I'm good x2
Yeah

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I was born in yak town
South side next to a crack house
Call the cops and you get shot down
Thanking God for where I'm at now
I don't chase fame I don't need the problems
A million dollars cause a million problems
B.I.G. made millions, Pac main millions
Both died violent we ain't caught the villains (we ain't caught 'em yet)
Oh yeah I see it clear, man(e)
Ever since my dad died I ain't been the same
I pray to God that he rose and didn't see the flame
You know what them types of thoughts'll do to your brain?

Every day above ground is a great one
Even if the pressure weigh tons, it won't break us
Another day made
And that is inspiration
I can't let you bloodsuckers drain my motivation, yessir

[Hook]
I don't fit into your in-crowd
I gotta be who I am now
I don't got no chains on me now
No I don't fit into your in-crowd

Long as we living I'm good
Breath in my lungs so I'm good
God is with us so I'm good
I'm good x2
Yeah

[Bridge: Derek Minor & Janice Gaines]
If you have came along way and you still good
Get your hands high, hands high
You got a ways to go but you still good
Get your hands high, hands high
They can talk all they want but you still good
Get your hands high, hands high
We done been through it all and the Lord never left us like we reaching up to heaven
Get your hands high

[Verse 4: Derek Minor]
Tryna give the people something they can believe in
This is soul food, go ahead sink your teeth in
Some people wanna live but they don't think it's a reason
Gotta cold heart, but they know where the heat is
And I do' been on the bottom, and I feel what you feel
See the pain in your eyes, I can tell that it's real
Gotta survive every day is another day
Just know that you are not alone, don't let your heart turn to stone
This what do you gon' do, every time you feel that way
Put this record on, let the melody take you away
To a place where you can drown them haters out with laughter
Watch your pain float away when flooded with disaster
I know that it's a fight
I wrote this song for us, we gon' be alright
I know who writing our story, it's a beautiful ending
So I trust in his word, even with humble beginnings
I'm - good

[Outro: Derek Minor & Janice Gaines]
I'm good, good
Good x2
I'm good, good
Good x2
I'm good
