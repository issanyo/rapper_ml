Gawvi get 'em

[Intro: Anthony Evans]
Right by my side

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Aye you've been with me from day one
You make everything better girl you A1
Tryna spend my whole life with same one
I mean spend my whole life till I ain't none
Lately I've been out here makin' these moves
But all that I got is nothing without you
You the best tell Cali that I said so
Had to make you mine when I seen you from the get-go
You know that I’m in trouble if I ever lose ya
So I'm out here cuffin' like a state trooper
And we can do whatever you like it don’t bother me
Long as you on my arm like an IV
I’m sick without ya

[Hook: Anthony Evans Jr.]
What’s a castle without you in it
It ain't nothin', no, it ain't nothin'
And it don’t feel right if you missin'
I need your lovin', all your lovin'
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side

[Verse 2: Chad Jones]
Too broke for the horse and carriage
But you've been so down for the kid I proposed a marriage
Old boy, G card, I done turned that in though
Said "H.I." to permanent, don’t want no rental
Baby, girl why you so loyal
Only secret's victorian, never change up your story
I never need to record my feelings, I vindicate
You trippin' on me hard
Somehow you done did it, you came before the squad
You vote for me, I vote for you too though
I choose to curb the ones that ain't you though
I caught them feelings I used to just stuck on
Without you here buildin' this empire's nothin'

[Hook: Anthony Evans Jr.]
What’s a castle without you in it
It ain't nothin', no, it ain't nothin'
And it don’t feel right if you missin'
I need your lovin', all your lovin'
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side

[Bridge: Anthony Evans]
I need you by my side
And that’s how it’s supposed to be
Cause me without you
But that ain't gon' do, no way
I need you by my side
That’s how it’s supposed to be
Cause me without you
That ain't gon' do, no

[Hook: Anthony Evans Jr.]
What’s a castle without you in it
It ain't nothin', no, it ain't nothin'
And it don’t feel right if you missin'
I need your lovin', all your lovin'
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
You belong right here, right by my side
