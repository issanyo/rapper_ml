[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Uh...
This for everybody surviving
And all they money spent
People up in my house
And I can't even pay my rent
I work my tail off
Hopin' one day I'm well off
Or at least just feed my babies
They say I'm lazy, but they WAY off!
I know the struggle
I feel you
Cops still in my rear view
And I ain't broke no laws...
But I guess my skin's in clear view
Hey, we need education
Maybe a lil' mo' patience
Cause our father's gone and this slave mentality's still keepin' us naked
You see crackheads on every corner
Pills, drink... marijuana
Pick jail, and in the coffin
Cause that's what we see often
And I know sometimes that you just wanna give up
But boy just keep yo' head up...
God said that we gon' make it bruh!

[Hook: Canton Jones]
One day
I know we won't have to cry no more
And this pain
I can't let you take it
That's why we, we, we gone make it yeah!
We, we, we gon' make it yeah!
I can't let you take it
That's why we, we, we gon' make it yeah
We, we, we, gon' make it yeah
I can't let you take it
That's why we, we, we gon' make it yeah

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Single mama it's hard...
Lord knows I understand
Growing up and he's smart
How you gon' raise him into a man?
You see the pain when he ask about where his daddy at
You'll go hungry to make sure he got clothes on his back!
Girl I know your pain
God, He know the same
He hears you when you pray
You can give Him everything
Young man I feel you
See other kids and it kills you
Cause they dads off in they homes
And yours ain't even nowhere near you!
I understand, cause I been it
It's real to me, cause I lived it!
And I swear to God
Long as I breathe my son won't know that feeling!
Not cause I'm so good
But the Lord's my inspiration
Long as He's our Father
I know that we gone make it
Not cause I'm so good
But the Lord's my inspiration
Long as He's our Father
I know that we gone make it
Not cause I'm so good
But the Lord's my inspiration
Long as He's our Father
I know that we gone make it!

[Hook: Canton Jones]
One day
I know we won't have to cry no more
And this pain
I can't let you take it
That's why we, we, we gone make it yeah!
We, we, we gone make it yeah!
