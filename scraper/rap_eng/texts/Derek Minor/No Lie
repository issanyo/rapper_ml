[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Thinkin' bout how I came up, my mind gone out
Ridin' round with that thing tucked
So high I could fly over your plane bruh, thankin' God
Cause I ain't 'posed to be here, nah I ain't 'posed to be here, boy
That's no lie (that's no lie, that's no lie), on my hood
That's no lie (that's no lie, that's no lie), all facts
That's no lie (that's no lie, that's no lie), ask my momma
That's no lie [x4]

[Verse 1: Tony Tillman]
Ain't got no need to brag or boast on my past
Sometimes it just comes to to me
No smoke and mirrors I live in glass, real talk I promise G
I lived risky, real risky, had church dust on my mama's knee
Loud packs in my Nike socks, deuce five in my dungarees
16 with that gun on me, might pull and pop if u lunge on me, Smoked loud like everyday I just thank God for no lung disease. Looking back on my street life, man I recall what that done to me
My mind gone out doing wrong
Just just praying God don't punish me
Walkin' round with that weed smell
