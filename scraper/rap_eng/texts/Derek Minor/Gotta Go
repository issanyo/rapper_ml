[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
Juice Bangers
Yeah I gotta go
Yeah I gotta go, gotta go
Gotta go yeah
Dog playing in the snows, I gotta go
No more cooking on dorm in the kitchen, gotta go
They pretend that ice law, I gotta go
A dog taking L's for someone I barely know
Time to go, time to go
I think it's time to go, yeah I think it's time to go
No more slinging on the road, on the road
Cause if they pull me over they gon' lock me in with mo(James)

[Verse 1: Greg James]
Look please set me free from the streets
Please set me free from the schemes, yeah, yeah
Time that I go  I'm making my peace no more serving the fiend, aye, aye
I said that before but this time I mean it
I can't wait to breathe, wait, wait
They want me to stay, I'm good at the game
That's what I hate, wait
Youngtown is full of them savages
Next to the d we the worst of our ancestors
Lock up our fathers who locked up like animals
Call it oppression oppressing our capital yeah
Ava so drugged us eat cause the job that you seek treat you like a dog (like a dog)

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Bruh on the bag, ashamed that I'm glad
Lord on my bag yeah
Dollar gold talking flauge
This makes you two-faced
Guess we lies different
You two chains make you swag different
Army life make you trap different
Once you see that you're his job bet you never sleep
Told him not to ever carry charge by playing

[Chorus: Greg James & Derek Minor]
Playing with some girls I gotta go
I know they still gon' judge me for the way I let me fall
Yeah but either way I gotta go
Yeah I gotta go, I gotta go
Done playing on the floors, I gotta go
No more cooking on dorm in the kitchen, gotta go
They pretend that ice law, we gotta go
A dog taking L's for someone I barely know
Time to go, time to go
I think it's time to go, yeah I think it's time to go
No more slinging on the road, on the road
Cause if they pull me over they gon' lock me in with mo
I done prayed to God for my dogs in West Langela
Medicate they mind in North Georgia
This life is a maze we just trying find our way up
They just tell us lies, they just tell us lies

[Verse 3: Greg James]
I won't believe it (I won't believe it)
Why we keep killing one another?, standing, healing
And now people (and now people)
I've been trying to tell You where we came from
How we need You (oh we need You)
Swap up the bullet point looking all ring on the ring
Paint dripping like dizzle
Fatal homie about to lead em' (yeah, yeah)
Yeah they want the old me (oh yeah)
My cuz up in Cairie, my cuz up in Cairie
I'm feeling like MLK, MLK, I got a dream, I got a dream
I dreamed way high to my fiend
I had a dream where they ain't need no police
I had a dream that we free
I had a dream that we really believe
I'm making it more than a dream, making it more than a dream
I put in words to eternity king
I gotta go

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
No more cooking on dorm in the kitchen, gotta go
They pretend that ice law, I gotta go
A dog taking L's for someone I barely know
Time to go, time to go
I think it's time to go, yeah I think it's time to go
No more slinging on the road, on the road
Cause if they pull me over they gon' lock me in with mo
