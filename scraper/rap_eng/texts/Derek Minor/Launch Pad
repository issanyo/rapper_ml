Darkness all around me
I gotta rise, I gotta rise
These weights won't hold me down
All them lies, Let me rise

[Verse 1]
Lately I been praying, asking God
To help me wit my temper and my patience
They been testing me like ACT
But I done promised momma I'm a ace it
For the sake of the trinity, I Been trying to get em all out the matrix
I'm Keanu Reeves and John Wick when the pen on the pages
They don't want me win and it's evident
Even when I do I don't rub it in
I protect the paint in the zone I'm in
You'll never take me out my element
Every track they put me on I body, I just treat the beat like I'm using potty
Making art with this paper, that's origami, with contacts and glasses on you won't define me High Above the trap, come and find me

[Chorus]
Launch Pad, Launch Pad
We set if off like a bomb, yeah
Me and like all of my comrades
We taking off on a Launch pad
Launch pad
Launch pad, Launch Pad
Launch Pad, Launch Pad, Launch Pad
Launch pad, Launch Pad, Launch Pad
Launch Pad, Launch Pad, Launch Pad
We set if off like a bomb, yeah
Me and like all of my comrades
We taking off on a Launch pad
Launch pad
Launch pad, Launch pad
Launch pad, Launch Pad, Launch Pad
Launch Pad, Launch Pad, Launch Pad
