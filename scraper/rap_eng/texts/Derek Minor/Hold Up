[Intro: Chad Jones]
Yeah
No
I ain't gotta say it do I?
Keep up! (yeah)

[Verse 1: Chad Jones]
Uh, it's my off day and I'm loving it
Blocking out my strugglin'
Gotta couple friends with a bunch of kids, came through, so cool
Made food, Redbox, two movies and it's not due
Know who's who in my castle
We pumped up no gaso
And my kids asking for ice cream
I'm saying yes, no, have some
Man, check the fridge that's if we got it
Mess with me you know I got it!
Working hard is my major
I minored in frustration
Today my celebration don't you mess up my staycation

[Hook: Roz]
And it's a pretty good day, a pretty good day
Sunshine and I gotta say I like this grace

[Hook: Derek Minor]
And we've been cruising through the city all night
We ain't gonna give ya trouble we just living our life
And we ain't trying to hear you talking down all night
So won't you cut it out cuz' you're blowing my high!
Wait a minute...
Hold up x6
Got 'em x4
Hold up x6
Got 'em x4

[Verse 2: Chad Jones]
Got that invitation I sent
Then the Minorville in my will
Then the road trip, my bros here, we gonna flip that old script
Grown man situation, no compromise vacation
Keep going no matter what
No pass or punt but we lapping up
Oh you messed up the flow, didn't ya?
Autographs, want more pictures, some folks just won't get it
You heard me say it, leave 'em alone, didn't ya?
By the hand won't mind me alone
She look better in lil' Jones
That's all me, all me, all me, that Drake song

And I'm just sitting here enjoying my life, (my life)
And I don't smoke, but you're blowing my high, woah-oh now. (you lowered my high youngblood)
Hold up now, hey, I've been trying to do something right
But everybody want to start a fight. (woah yeah)
Hold up now, hold up now!

[Hook: Derek Minor and Roz]
And we've been cruising through the city all night
We ain't gonna give ya trouble we just living our life
And we ain't trying to hear you talking down all night
So won't you cut it out cuz' you're blowing my high!
Wait a minute...
Hold up x6
Got 'em x4
Hold up x6
Got 'em x4

[Chad Jones]
(Hey hold up)

[Hook: Roz]
And it's a pretty good day, a pretty good day, a pretty good day
Sunshine and I gotta say I like this grace. (gotta say I like this grace)
