Our Father who art in heaven that's what I'm prayin
This world is broken we need you now and that's what I'm sayin
They'll run up on with super soaker and no delayin


And they ain't even got water in em' but boy they sprayin (wew!)
I just be sitting back like what the world we thankin'
Do I really wanna raise all the children that you gave me in the world we makin'
I mean really they want to redefine the meaning of livin'
Like he sittin' in a billy with a philly sittin' in the back seat with about two or three women
Two or three women (hahaha)
Ty ridin' around in a Honda
So he tryin to get these come up might run up on yo mama
He don't even care about drama
He don't even care about drama!
I be prayin' for the boy that be gang bangin'
Shootin' off with the chopper like barang dang
Telling em' life without God is insane
Put your soul in His hand you can still change

Lord have mercy!
I came up where they real wild
Lord have mercy
They ridin' around with that yaya
Lord have mercy
I'm still prayin' for my hood
Lord have mercy
Cause they ridin' around up to know good
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Yeah
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy

Huh, Why
I just turned on my television people shootin I ain't' talkin' huntin'
Line and and I ain't talkin fishin
Everyday there's a new religion she knocked up that's Jehovah's witness
On that holy water no Catholicism 50 shades is the only way that they know a Christian
Dang!
And that was just on the evening news
RIP BB King paint the skies we can see the blues
Head first don't need the rules
Home Depot just need the tools
To bad troop ain't family it's an emergency we made it leave the room
Room
And we wonder why we up in shambles pop off at the mouth like bullets from Rambo
And hide our true colors like we in camo
Taught at a young age that we need that lambo
So we stack our money from border to mantle
Tryna to shed light like I'm burnin a candle
Tears all up in my face knowin' life is a gamble we losin
And apparently, we think we ain't made to win
Pass up on amazingness masked up know who Jason is
Ask us we hatin' this
Life that we were gave to live
God have mercy hope that there is still a chance at saving this
And I'm gone

I came up where they real wild
Lord have mercy
They ridin' around with that yaya
Lord have mercy
I'm still prayin' for my hood
Lord have mercy
Cause they ridin' around up to know good
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy

I came up where they flamed up disrespect and them 9's bangin'
Crip walk with they hats lo' get shot to death for that sign language
And this is just the life they live drankin' smoke the time away
Cain't recite the alphabet all they know is 9's ad gauges
And it ain't safe to say hey now
Look around it's so crazy now
For your kicks you get laid down
Got dude afraid to rock J's now
Cause they gased up on that Henney
Ridin around with that semi
Do you like Crystal King and take you luggage
Like come up off that Fendi
Boy they doin the most to get fast cash
Movin numbers like math class
Them trey pounds ain't hash tags
And they shell shocked they got use to shots
Shells pop'n and they use to bodies
Steph Curry with the aim boy big guns and they shootin rockets
Neighborhoods is being ...fied young kids are being desensitized
We just look and see empty lodges we hate we don't even emphatise
And I'm like Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
I know the devil's on the prowl and boy he workin'

I came up where they real wild
Lord have mercy
They ridin' around with that yaya
Lord have mercy
I'm still prayin' for my hood
Lord have mercy
Cause they ridin' around up to know good
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
