[Hook – Jai]
I go harder
‘Cause I done been knocked down again
But what don’t kill me, that make me stronger, stronger
That make me stronger, stronger
I gotta live
And ain’t no way I’m going back to my sin
I know you live in me and that make me stronger, stronger
That make me stronger, stronger


You say the righteous never get forsaken
Well help me understand why I feel like a orphan lately
That’s such a selfish statement, look how my heart impatient
You send these trials to make me, but never let ‘em break me
Media hate us, set that on top of our hate list
My homies get clapped with bangers, detractors wanna debate us
And you sustain us, won’t let us get devoured by evil
They want us lost and swimming with the sharks – Finding Nemo
Hey, and even if I die today
Or this world don’t ever change, I give glory to your name ‘cause we on
And I ain’t talking ‘bout the shows they put me in
But through his blood he bought me back, so if I fall in faith …

[Hook]


Sometimes I just wanna end it all, it’s like this after the fall
They beat me until I crawl, still I’m hearing your call
I’m begging for assistance while in this life of resistance
See I have no resistance minus the Father’s persistence
So even if life wanna throw me a curve
I’m building up everything top of this Word; that’s how we fight, forget what you heard
Say what you want, or what I do or what I don’t
For every sin we know there’s a cost, and he paid that on top that cross
Oh, we know this life is full of pain
But for him I’m unashamed, ‘cause he gon’ call my name and I’m gone
That’s why I live my life in light of that
Ain’t no way I’m turning back; count me out, but matter fact …

[Bridge – Jai]
Now throw them hands up, wave ‘em in the air
If you know you’re stronger now
Come on everybody say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Now throw them hands up, wave ‘em in the air
If you know you’re stronger now
Come on everybody say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
