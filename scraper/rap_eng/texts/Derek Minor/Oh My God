[Intro]
Sometimes I don't believe it
Sometimes I don't believe it
Oh, Oh my, Oh my God
Oh, Oh my-

[Hook:LaShawn]
Oh my God
Showeed up once again for a sinner like me
Oh my God
I just can't believe His love for me
Oh my God
Why do you do it? Oh yeah
Oh my God

[Verse 1:LaShawn]
When I think of the goodness, I can't help myself
I lose all control & I gotta tell someone else
I'd be here all day if I really got into it
So I'mma just tell you like this, yeah

[Verse2:Eric & Adonis]
He's my light in the dark
Right in His spot
He's like a million feet tall
Man look at God
He's my- I-
Don't get me wrong, I've been there
These problems get real
But everytime it gets hard, I be like-

[Hook:LaShawn]
Oh my God
Showed up once again for a sinner like me
Oh my God
I just can't believe His love for me
Oh my God
Why do you do it? Oh yeah

Oh my God

[Verse 3]
I know you love me (Yes You do)
I know you care for me (Yes You do)
Show me every day
Man, I'm telling you, I'm so grateful
Gotta give You Your credit
Ain't nobody else did it
Nobody

[Verse 4]
Who'd have ever thought that I'd end up
With a love like this?
Who'd have ever thought that the
Savior would be on me like this?
So, I stay close to that Ghost
Once I get it, need some more
Every now and then, I be feeling like oh
Look at this life like oh my, oh my

[Hook:LaShawn]
Oh my God
What you did for a sinner like me
Oh my God
I just can't believe His love for me
Oh my God
Why do you do it? Oh yeah
Oh my God

[Verse 5:Derek Minor]
Oh, I remember
Only time I prayed was
"Lord let me get away with it"
Oh, I remember
How many times are You gonna have grace on this sinner?
Wait now, wait now
Can I tell y'all why I came now?
Can I tell y'all how I changed now?
Can I tell y'all I ain't the same now?

I got homies on blocks with that yola
Whippin' that codeine with soda
Don't matter how far that I'm goin'
Know that I'll always pray for you

'Cause somebody did that for me
Somebody did that for- me
I'm not supposed to be here but I am
'cause the Lord He had mercy on- me
You gotta believe it
Thats why I live life to the fullest
Oh yes, I live life to the- fullest
And I would never take credit for His blessing
From a saint to a sinner

Let me take you back to the beginning of it all
When he spoke (Yeaaaah)
All it took, was a Word
And even back then, He knew my name
Ask me how? Can't explain
But if you knew what I know, then you'd say

(Lashawn)
Oh my God
What you did for a sinner like me
Oh my God
I just can't believe His love for me
Oh my God
Why do you do it? Oh yeah
Oh my God
