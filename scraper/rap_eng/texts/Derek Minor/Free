[Verse 1]
They gone tell me be quiet
They gone say I'm stirring up the pot
They gone say I'm too emotional
They gone say I need to calm down
Usually I hold it in, I don't wanna mess the paper up
I don't wanna be too aggressive, that could make you uncomfortable
But do you know what that feel like
Handcuffed scared for you life
Pray to God he ain't had a bad day
This could be your very last night
This so exhausting, Lord knows we tired
They say wait for the facts like I can't believe my eyes
Wake me up from this nightmare
Tell me that this ain't true
Do black men have rights?
Do black men bear the image of God too?
Cause if we do, then tell me, why we always get shot down
Why we can't get a trial date
Why is death the only answer now?
I know that it's good cops
Word to officer Fitzgerald at my church
But tell me why the bad cops
Never get to see the justice system work?
But I know the Lord still just, and I know he still love us
But I'm starting feel in America
The justice system means just us

[Hook]
And I don't have no explanation, I'm just hurt
And I know that it's complicated, but it still hurts

[Bridge]
If we supposed to be free, why it feel like chains hanging on me

[Verse 2]
Listen homie keep your head up, yea I know you prolly fed up
It feel like they ain't hearing us, feel like they only fearing us
All I know is that we hear today
There's a God and he feel our pain
All I know is every time we pray
He'll be there to wipe our tears away
We are more than criminals, we are more than imbeciles
Our fathers ain't all dead beats
We ain't all thugging in the streets
The Land of opportunity is only for the ones with opportunity
We just trying to catch up, years after slavery
All that I'm saying, is it's complicated and I don't get all of it
But all that I know is this pain in my heart, oh yea I feel all of it
I know the Lord still just, and I know he still love us
But I'm starting feel in America
The justice system means just us

[Hook]
And I don't have no explanation, I'm just hurt
And I know that it's complicated, but it still hurts

[Outro]
If we supposed to be free, why it feel like chains hanging on me (8x)
