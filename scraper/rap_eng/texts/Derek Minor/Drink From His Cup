Knockin' knockin' at my door
Yes I know what they are here for
They kick it in, run inside
Kidnap my wife this is goodbye
I see hate inside your eyes
My God and I you do despise
If this prayer's my last time
Hope through this He saves your life
I will never hide I will never run
I will sacrifice my life in the name of the Son
Beat me to the ground I see the Glory of the Lord
This the moment we all been waiting for
Let 'em stab me, burn me
You are worthy
Drown me, starve me
Bruise me, harm me
The pain that I bear cannot compare
To your arms once I get there

[Hook- Suzy Rock]
People don't hear You so I'll be your voice
Suffering daily but still we rejoice
Time for your glory, just telling your story
We'll carry the cross you suffer before me
People don't know you so I'll be the one
To introduce them to Your glorious Son
And until that day when we see Your face
This race we will run inspired by Love
We'll drink from His cup

Dead in sin - the state of men
Dirt and filth - they lay within
Sacrifice - they need to live
So I'll go down and walk with them
They'll reject me, disrespect me
Laugh and mock me, as they test me
Send the guards to come arrest me
I know that they won't accept me
Thorns on my head nails in my hands
But for the Father and His glory I will take this cross
Cup full of wrath pour it on my head
I will take every single drop to atone for the lost
Let em whip me, curse me
You are worthy
Beat me taunt me
Move me- hardly
The pain I bear cannot compare
For the glory of the Father, for You I share

[Hook]
