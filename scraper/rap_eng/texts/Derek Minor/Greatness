[Verse 1]
I came from the bottom of the bottom of the bottom
Southside Yaytown, they used to move work next to mi casa
Mama met the Lord and deep inside she started changing
Moved us to the South so we would have a chance to make it out
I grew up watching her break her back to put food on our table
Worked herself until she almost died, was barely able
It's where I get my work ethic from
She said, "I see what you been building, please be humble son"
She know just where we came from
They not on tv where we came from
They don't win no trophies where we came from
From the bottom of the bottom
From the bottom of the bottom
I can't let my self be blinded by these stage lights
Scared I'll lose myself in all the hype, call that stage fright
Flying coast to coast and eating things that I can't pronounce
The homes I grew up in combined fit in where I'm sleeping now
That ain't why I started, this was passion on the page
Told the Lord, I do this till I die, just for his name
Maybe, that's why I'm so focused I don't play no games
If we made off in his image, that must mean we great
If you know where I came from
Said we ain't have no value where I came from
God was right there where we came from
Even on the bottom of the bottom
On the bottom of the bottom
This is greatness

[Verse 2]
They wanna know where I be at, my bad, sorry for the wait
I had to re-up with E-1 and make sure the paperwork is straight
Signed the dotted line, got a check, now everything is great
Now, it's time to get back talking
God in everything you saying
D-boys moving work, and I'm praying for em' cuz' they kin to me
I know ex-goons preach now, but they still rocking they gold teeth
People telling me to change up
I'm too real, they can bite me
With content like da-da, probably never fit in this industry
Okay, I reflect greatness
RMG the movement, I ain't gotta say this
You've been patient, now it's time to break out the cage
We can all get back to the basics
When they know the reason that I'm preaching is Jesus
Alive for him and I'm still killing the beat
It's the glory up inside of us that I'm affecting
That's the reason what you're witnessing is excellence
It's greatness

[Hook]
Greatness
Greatness
Greatness

[Verse 3]
Okay, while we here and I got the mic
Let me go ahead and get some things straight
Reach Records, that's they business, don't ask me for no update
Crae' still my dawg, wish him well
I just talked to him last Monday
But, it's RMG till I D-I-E, you can put that on my grave
I had to realize what's inside of me
For all of the people that lied to me
For all of the people that said I would fall off
Oh boy, what a time to be alive
I wrote this for everyone feel like they counted out
You need to look in the mirror and tell yourself
It's time to be who I am now
Greatness

[Hook]
Greatness
Greatness
Greatness
