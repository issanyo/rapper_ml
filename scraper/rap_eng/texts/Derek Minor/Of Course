[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Hallelujah, oh Lord
Where I’m from it go fttttt when they bored
We ain’t supposed to be here, pop a cork
God did it, ooh, I’m flexing, yeah of course
Made out the bottom of course
I ain’t gotta worry 'bout a thing anymore
I just whew whew whew whew whew, yeah of course
With a crown of thorns feeling like a King, yeah of course
Made it out the bottom of course
I ain’t gotta worry 'bout a thing anymore
I just whew whew whew whew whew, yea of course
With a crown of thorns feeling like a King, yeah of course

[Verse 1: Byron Juane]
Young lil hitta like a mistro
Ain’t been anywhere that I can’t go
Shawty told me I’m a star
Told her I don’t need the gas
What I really really need is good credit in the bag
Mama saw me sign the deal, I told her there it go
Now I’m waking up in lofts
On the wood floors
On my pride I’m Mufasa
Flex boy I outta
God said He got it, so I stress not about it
I just Kuna Matata, hitta, yeah I really do
People coming for the squad, get a coffin and a noose
Been a king from a king
So my rings gotta ring
Now my chains gotta gleam
And my soul been the beam, wow of course
How you got the drive all that power, need a horse
Young Bryon like a demigod, what a force
I been feeling charged 'cause I’m plugged in the source
Planned from the end, I win yeah, of course

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Hallelujah, oh Lord
Where I’m from it go fttttt when the bored
We ain’t supposed to be here, pop a cork
God did it, ooh, I’m flexing, yeah of course
Made out the bottom of course
I ain’t gotta worry 'bout a thing anymore
I just whew whew whew whew whew, yea of course
With a crown of thorns feeling like a King yea of course
Made out the bottom of course
I ain’t gotta worry 'bout a thing anymore
I just whew whew whew whew whew, yea of course
With a crown of thorns feeling like a King yea of course

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Let me give y’all a new style to run with
New ideas to bite
New wave to surf on
Please prepare the throne, Mr. Minor is home
And I’m done putting you on, get Doc on the phone
Watch my moves with binoculars to duplicate it
But they don’t see the big picture so they can’t trace it
I can teach you how to hustle and then finesse it
Have my cheese and my bread quick, make it deep dish
Whew, whew, whew, it’s never been about the money for me
Ugh ugh ugh, it’s always been about the kingdom dummy
I been talking to the Son, He said the future sunny
Got a lot of haters but my momma love me
I’m an artist but I’m more close to a trapper
Cause I operate outside of the rules, you can’t catch us
A lot of people talk but they full of the stuff in pampers
Trying not to hit the button like Trump and nuke me a rapper

[Chorus: Derek Minor]
Hallelujah, oh Lord
Where I’m from it go fttttt when the bored
We ain’t supposed to be here, pop a cork
God did, ohhh I’m flexing, yeah of course
Made out the bottom of course
I ain’t gotta worry 'bout a thing anymore
I just whew whew whew whew whew, yea of course
With a crown of thorns feeling like a King yea of course
Made out the bottom of course
I ain’t gotta worry 'bout a thing anymore
I just whew whew whew whew whew, yea of course
With a crown of thorns feeling like a King yea of course
