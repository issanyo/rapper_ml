[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Derek Minor and Dre Murray]
He pulled up to that corner store with nothing but evil on his mind
Black hoodie on and a loaded .45
His rivals think this a game
And they don't know that he hot
He gonna throw a couple bullets at him like he Brett Farve
They done violated
I mean really violated
Jumped him on his way home from school
Uploaded it to YouTube now everybody laughing
But they won't be laughing when he tighten em all up
With his ratchet, then the phone ring
Bruh where you at?
Why my gun missing?
I told you let it go
I told you stop tripping
I just picked up Desiah and I gotta get to work
Look I know your pride is hurt
But don't do nothin' stupid
The Devil got the blueprint
He wanna put us all in Jail
Then Hell
I'm in the car now
Click, whatever Dre, I ain't got time to listen to what you got to say

[Chorus: Chino Dollaz]
Day to day decisions getting made
Foolish pride seem to always  to get in the way
Probably doing something that'll get me sent away
Whatever though
Touch me, click clack bang
Day to day decisions getting made
Foolish pride always seem to get in the way
Probably doing something that'll get me sent to the grave
Whatever though
Touch me, click clack bang

[Verse 2: Derek Minor and Dre Murray]
About 20 minutes past and his blood boiled inside
There that boy go
Hopped up off the ride took the back of that Ruger out
And popped him in his eye
Pistol whip that boy till his arm got tired
Man I'ma get you first
And I'ma get your dogs later
You ain't making it out of this one
I hope that you been praying
Pointed it at his head and right before he started spraying
Dre came out of nowhere and tackled him to the pavement
Bruh have you lost your mind?
This is not who you are
Get in the car
But Dre
Get in the car
He fussed a little
But he knew that Dre was right
So he walked to his Cutlass opened the door sat inside
Then the sirens came
Get on the ground I will blast you right now
Don't make a sound
You gang banger types, all you do is fight
I've been chasing your kind around all night
Sir, sir, look sir
My name is Andre
There was a fight here but now it's okay
Right, let's see some ID
So he reached in his pocket and all you heard was gun
Then bullets got to poppin'
The officer turned around to the backup just arrived
Officers hold your fire, oh, hold your fire!
The officer looked back
Saw a wallet on the floor
And Dre next to it eyes closed he was
Gone

[Outro Anesha Birchett]
Yeah, think twice one decision can affect your life
Yeah it can take your life
So choose loving twice
We don't want no darkness we want light
To change our lifes
Before another one gone
Gone and gone and gone
She gone he gone we gone another gone
Woah don't want another one gone and gone and gone
She gone he gone we gone another gone
Oh what do you know what do you know what do you know
You know
