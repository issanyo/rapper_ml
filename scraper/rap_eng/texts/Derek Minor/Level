Whoa whoa, already know what I'm on
Please keep that talking at home
Don't play with me little boy I'm grown

I'm in all black like T'challa
Turn ya show in to Wakanda
Gimme the beat
Black panther claws I'm a rip that
Sleep on me, sleep on me
I bet it just be a cat nap
I guarantee we gon' eat, I came up on government cheese
Y'all out here chasing these fans, to me the rap game is a breeze
Level up level up level up
I am my only competitor
God told me shine so I'm glowing up
Way up way up way up way up
I really think that you should come with us
My soul gotta fly
Take off so much I might move to Atlanta
Take off so much I might try join the Migos
Nashville my city
Shout to Stan and Petty
Shout to Bre and Lito

[Verse 2: Byron Juane]
I been one to tell these people
What I gotta do uh
Sauce, sauce up my plate is running over
Yeah it's full, yeah
Uh, I been feeling up lately
Plane taking off Runway
This can only go one way
That's a ticket that you buy one way
Holding homies that challenge me from the gate, Like uh
That was a speed force
Flash in a dash on my keyboard
Get it? I got it. I been on my level Since 9 and then put in the 7, then add it together
That's 16 in my 16
I been at it for the wrong things
RMG for a gold ring, It's a champ thing
Like aye
I been on my way
I been M.I.A
This the only phase
Day one
Lord He reigns, While it rains
Yeah it storms, Yeah it pours
I can't deal with it no more
Mute that mouth till it go off
All of them words
Don't match they walk
Cause they like to talk
