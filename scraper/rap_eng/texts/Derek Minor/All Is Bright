[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
I don't know how else to tell you this
I thank You, Lord, You saved my life
I say Your Name and You listenin'
I almost left, You got me right
I came out the slums
The dealers, the users, the bongs
The scammers, the hustlers, and drugs
I had enough
I need that light of the love
I'll never run off on the plug
I found a better life, way too crazy
I need shining light for clarity
Looking for the light? All of you might asâ€“
Well come with me, I'll help you find it
Blasting off, astronaut ignited
Shine your light, take you to your highness

[Bridge: Choir]
Silent Night
Holy Night
All is calm
All is bright

[Refrain: 1K Phew]
Shine Your light, shine Your light, shine Your light, yeah
All is calm, all is calm, all is bright, yeah
Shine Your light, shine Your light, shine Your light, yeah
All is calm, all is calm, all is bright, yeah
