Don't get confused baby

[Repeat: x4]
Don't get confused

The gospel got me so good, I call it super straight
Was lame till He came, I know that you relate
Was dead to Him but lead to Him, He rejuvenates
Still can't believe He caught me up, yeah elevated
That's how I know He got me

His love is never endin'
And that's just like the gospel
It's for sure is never pending
Not just from my beginning
Keeps me until I'm finished
Takes me way beyond the grave
I'm saved, eternal livin'

This goes beyond conversion, this gift just keeps on giving
I'd it makes no sense to start and stop
Now pop that clutch and shift it
I'm hoping you don't miss it, this here is target practice
I'm asking, "What good are beats by Dre if you can't grasp this?"

(Ha, uh-uh) That ain't even right man
Play it to the left of lust, mental pics, tight frame
You crop it like a close-up, then chop it like the chorus
I'm tryna take you deep, call it Blacklight, Mayne

[Chorus]
Aye this that good news music
We call it Gospel
We call it Gospel
We call it Gospel
Don't get confused baby
It's what He used to save me
It's what He used to keep me
(I, I, I) I need it daily
(You, You, You) You need it daily
(We, we, we) We need it daily
(They, they, they) They need it daily
(I) Yeah I need it daily
(They, they they) Yeah I need it daily
(You, you, you) You need it daily
(We, we, we) We need it daily
They need it daily

Boy let's get it clear, from the Lord's wrath I'm saved
Yeah I'm Gucci Mayne, no Waka Flocka Flame
So secure in the Lord, no frontin' for people
'Cause you can die stuntin' (die stuntin')
Evil Kenevil

In this New Jack City hold the world loosely
His Word keep callin' me, I'm itchin' for it, call me Pookie
Satan try to trap us like "Go pursue sin"
I'm like "Silly rabbit, Trixs are for kids"
I know only in Christ we gon' be free

Through His blood we've been redeemed
Them chains no longer holdin' me so)
Clique for the squad, for the love of God
Boy we rollin' 40 Deep (and)
When I want to run the love of the son through the helper

Get a hold of me (see)
Christ died for us, we'll say He's a church fan
I'm talkin' Gospel, minus the church fan
I'd be a fool minus the Lord's hand
So I'm wrapped around His finger like a wedding band

[Chorus]
Gospel
Grace through faith
Yo pro
They need it daily
It's the gospel
This why we good (oh)

I'm good, I'm good
Let's get that understood
The gospel got me right for life
That's right that's what it do
I'm good, I'm good
Let's get that understood
The Gospel got me right for life
That's right that's what it do
I'm good, I'm Gucci

[Repeat: x4]
Aye, yeah that's what it do
