[Verse 1]
They ain't wanna see us shine
They ain't wanna see us rise
They ain't wanna give us help
God said, "Help myself."
God said, "What you worried 'bout? Acting like I ain't got you."
Make the moves mane, shoot the shot boy
Guarantee they won't block it
I been trying to take a dead culture and revive it while the vultures nibble at the skeleton
They just trying to bottle up my melanin
They a kill a prophet to bring profit in
I can't be taking bait
I see the hook in the pond, ah yeah
I promise I'll give up this fame
Before I get trapped all in your con, ahh yeah
Where was you when I ain't have an number 1
Or when I ain't know where the money coming from
Outta here acting like my day one
You counted me out on day one
I feel like you don't like the outcome
You count the hours till I'm done
I got family to feed and they looking at me
And I'm looking to God we gone jump, jump, jump

[Chorus]
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
But they want us on crutches
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
But they want us on crutches
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
But they want us on crutches
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
But they want us on crutches

[Verse 2]
Some my family real killers
Some my family dope dealers
I'm just telling all our stories
So the world won't forget us
In the church they just want me to speak to suburbia
All that ghetto gangsta talk is disturbing us
I'm sorry my past and my present offend you
Ain't nothing sweet on the menu
Step dad came home smelling like a trap house
My lil homie from the east blllllllldd got shot down
I will never sell out, y'all can go on keep your budget
I done kept it real from the jump, now we got it jumpin'
They look up to me and they ask how I did it
I tell em it's God and as God as my witness
I pray that my talent can give away millions
To get rid of ghettos where my people living
Where all of my children get education
And all of my cousins can stop medicating
Gotta keep moving I know we gone make it
Till then enjoy all these classics I'm making, jumpin'

[Chorus]
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
But they want us on crutches
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
But they want us on crutches
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
But they want us on crutches
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
Got this whole thing
Jumping, Jumping
But they want us on crutches
