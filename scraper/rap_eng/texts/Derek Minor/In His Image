Oh the world can't have me
Say I'm acting different
I'm just looking like my Daddy
I'm made in His image
I'm made in His image
I'm made in His image
I'm made in His image
I'm living like that
Oh the world can't have me
Say I'm acting different
But I'm looking like my Daddy
I'm made in His image
I'm made in His image
I'm made in His image
I'm made in His image
I'm living like that

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
OK. Order order in the court
In the creation order
We the highest of sorts
Porcelain frames with treasure inside
Now this is insane, we extra fly
Let me explain why
You were made a little bit up under them angels
Through our sinning our image it was mangled
But it doesn't take a smidget away from the One that made you
All that's major I said
The simple fact that creation is so creative
Is an exclamation point to this statement
This is amazing, so amazing, so amazing
If you got low self esteem well this should change them
There's traces of divinity up in your frame fam
So love God, love people, and thoroughly hate sin!
You need a doctor Slim Shady, well I got one
And Nas can't look to his tats to find God's Son
Not satisfied being God of your life, you're not one
Why we need community? Oh yeah cause our God's one

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
I was created in Your image
Not to manufacture an identity or image
I'm living, all I know to live
I don't know everything, but I know I'm His
A child of the Most High
I know that it's unnerving
Sometimes even for me
Cause, no I don't deserve it I rest in who I am
No debating who I'm not Keep my head to the sky
Walk Hard, Dewey Cox Used to hustle to be on top
Till I finally realized Somebody died for that spot
And it wasn't mine to have Too far away for me to grab
Took nails in His hands
While I was clowning on the slab
I was made for pimpin' and trappin'
These worldly ways so attractive Brain would still be his captive
Minus Christ and His passion Will enslaved to God, Him Master
His word make our vision clear
LensCrafters

[Verse 3: Chad Jones]
I wanna give my heart in worship
My actions surely follow
I'd be the Headless Horseman
Got me through them Deathly Hallows
I'm grown like Harry Potter
But I know that wasn't magic
I was sick from my disease
When I thought I didn't have it
I'm cured inside like Magic
Wasn't 'sposed to tell nobody
But I just gotta blab it
I lift You up like gang signs
When they out there stacking
I guess I am a blood
Please excuse my false flagging
(Excuse me please) Thank You
My faith in Christ is my belief
En-graph me in Your tree
I'm so happy as a leaf
I'm fighting for my village
With Shinobies all around me
A Shinobi is a ninja but
We don't move in silence
OK if I'm a star
My community's a galaxy
It'd be a tragedy to actually think
(Wait) matter fact insanity
Only trusting in some vanity
The world like it so casually
I just wanna be who You say I am
But they be in my ear sayin'...
