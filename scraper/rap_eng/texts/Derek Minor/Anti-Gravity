[Chorus]
Anti switching up
Anti day 2s
Anti not me
Anti like you
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Anti falling off
Anti all talk
Anti fake so
I'm anti most of y'all
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity

[Verse 1]
Our father in heaven
I been praying for Your blessing
I've been learning Your lessons
I just need Your protection
Help me watch for these bustas
Help me watch for these suckas
A lot of people say they love me
I don't really even trust 'em
They just know that I got the sauce
They won't the recipe to try and rip it off
They just trying find the secret to survive
When everybody trying to kill you off
I've been really on a mission
Took the harder way, got a couple pennies
Now I got em hot, smoking like a chimney
That ain't see it coming God as my witness
You gone have to listen, I am not finished
Lord knows all wanna do is make Him proud
But I'm finding out, half these people now
All wanna do is tear you down
They just wanna take your crown
You gon' have to get your own now
You gon' live with your choice now
I could never let you hold me down

[Chorus]
Anti switching up
Anti anti day 2s
Anti not me
Anti like you
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Anti falling off
Anti all talk
Anti fake so
I'm anti most of y'all
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity

[Verse 2]
Day ones only, no day 2s
Watching always
I don't even trust Mondays
And my confidant is Yahweh
Been to hell and back, all flames
On the track going flamb√©
Turn the city into Pompeii
Feeling like I done seen it all
Guess I'm learning from mistakes I made
Turning lemons into lemonade
Lemon pie, custard, and meringue
I've been cheffing up every way
Everyday, everyday
Out here selling lemon everything
Now I'm making lemon pound cake
Hallelujah, Thank You Jesus
I been learning everything is for reason
Cooking with the flavor, now you get eat it
Even if you salty, still I gave you seasoning
Trying to live l the life, I can give you secret
Wash in the truth, rinse and repeat it
Lotta people know the way and I done seen it
Read it all the time but never get the meaning
Never get the meaning

[Chorus]
Anti switching up
Anti anti day 2s
Anti not me
Anti like you
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Anti falling off
Anti all talk
Anti fake so
I'm Anti most y'all
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
Antigravity
