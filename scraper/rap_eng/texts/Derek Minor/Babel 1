With my eyes to the sky
How can I deny you?
You're stronger than the weight of the world
Raised high for all to see

Deep in my heart
You placed a vision
To build Your empire
But my heart's desire
Is to build it for me

I'm gonna take, I'm gonna make
I'm gonna build, I'm gonna break
With your power

It will be grand, it will be tall
It's gonna shine, it will not fall
It will be mine

Cause I've got meditations
Full of many tensions
Trying to hide my bad, bad intentions (bad intentions)

I've got bad intentions
Full of bad intentions
I've got bad intentions
