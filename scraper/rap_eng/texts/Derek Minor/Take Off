[Verse 1]
Bang on the mic and here I go
Unashamed of the cross, here I flow
May not wanna [?], so i'm running for ya
Heading for your [?] so i'm gunnin' for ya
Come right back like i'm a lawyer
Gotta really make sure that ya really know the game
Christ the Lord, you better know the name
Keep it your grill like Novacane
Gonna pipe down, no I can't
Know the ammo, all I know
To understand that hope that is Christ and that he gave us a life, unashamed, I know it
Killin' i know, price on my head
Gift of my life, full of compassion
Life of a blasphemer, he here for us
He died on that tree
That was a smasher
[?] to a hostel
Our sins will bring [?]
And he knew us and he [?] us and in his holiness how can a view us
And he saved us
The ransom was paid, he weighs us
Who came out of the grave, forgave us
Who said we made in Jesus so we proclaimin' the name
Heh heh turn up

[Hook: Derek Minor]
Now let me hear you say (One One Six)
Everybody say (One One Six)
I want to hear you say (One One Six)
Everybody say (One One Six)
Now tell them I'm unashamed (I'm Unashamed)
I'm Unashamed (I'm Unashamed) x8
I'm Unashamed

[Verse 2]
Yessir
I ain't gonna pipe down either
They talk about their sin, imma talk about my king, baby
(Una, Uno Uno Seis, Una, Uno Uno Seis, Una, Una, Please Don't Get Up In My Way)
That's what I'm passionate about
(It's the Black Knight)
Yessuh
When I Uno Uno Seis
My grip is to do whatever he says
So for the Grace
He sat on my case
Living water, he'll give you a taste
He makes sure he offers, give you a place
Minus the Lord, your life is a waste
Your life isn't over, set us a blaze
So unashamed, so turn up that bass
He rules everything below him
So honestly do you want to show him
The purpose of my existence is stay of it but get to know him
Sat at a cross, securing our place
Sat at a grave, think it's a play
Telling a story
Live for His glory
Unashamed of the Gospel of Christ Jesus
(One One Six)
