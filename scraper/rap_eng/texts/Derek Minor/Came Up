[Hook: Joey Vantes]
I came up nobody made me
Two-tone on the whip like AVI
Too strong, level up, can't play me
Too gone, lemme drip, gone wavy
Yeah ok ok whoa
Whoa I came up whoa
Yeah

[Verse 1: Joey Vantes]
Cold bussin it on your block like it's a 4-5
When that bass drop, I might take a stage dive
Murder was the case, on the tre I rise
Give me the keys, did it with ease on that left side
Family eating, ya tu sabes on my crest line
Nothing to change, We still the same on the west side
Run and get your phone, whole world bout to know
Put it on my name, cock it let it go
I won't let these vultures go and shame me (go and shame me)
You ain't culture boy, you can not play me (play me)
I don't know your name, we ain't the same breed (same breed)
You been switching, we ain't from the same team no

[Hook: Joey Vantes]
I came up nobody made me (ain't nobody!)
Two-tone on the whip like AVI (AVI!)
Too strong, level up, can't play me
Too gone, lemme drip, gone wavy
Yeah, ok, ok, whoa, whoa, I came up
I came, whoa, I came up, whoa
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Yeah in my yard
I see trophies, I see players
I been pushing, I came up
Got your hand out, put that back, oh you nothin
Now my cousin they like junior out there shining
Its that light yeah junior out there blinding eyes
Sell my soul need an advance let me check the bank
You can do a show and get a check and split it 40 ways
If I flexin' I can make it rain for 40 days
But I'd rather give my chain than try to mess with chain
Game on the leash and I put that on my dog
With that you've been talking
I confront it lost my dog
I just going for the King, that's my OG
I been feasting on a beat, it's in my teeth

[Hook: Joey Vantes]
Yeah I came up nobody made me (ain't nobody!)
Two-tone on the whip like AVI (AVI!)
Too strong, level up, can't play me
Too gone, lemme drip, gone wavy
Yeah, ok, I Came, whoa, I came, whoa, I came up
Yeah, put it down for that train, (down for that train)
Yeah, yeah, what?, what?, what?, what?
