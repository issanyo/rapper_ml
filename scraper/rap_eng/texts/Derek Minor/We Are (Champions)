Who are the fighters
The conquerors, survivors?
Who is victorious
In the glorious King of Kings?
You've gotta know we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
Oooh Yeah!

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I dedicate this to everyone with 116 tatted on their arm
If it ain't inked in your flesh I know it's stitched in your heart
I see an army right in front of me
Black, white and hispanic, imagine
It's all happened from rapping
Picture that! How God uses foolish things
Like ex-weedheads and d-boys
To speak on His behalf
Can't tell me this ain't the Lord!
We are firm because I see Satan on
A mission for our soul
But Christ told me eat
I see food like Pappadeaux
Crae' doing fine
Tho' people hoping that he stumble'
Hard to get kicked off a mountain
When you fightin' to stay humble
Trip plantin' churches
T-Dot spittin' across the country
KB going on missions, and Andy shapin' the culture
Now, some might say I'm braggin, but I'm
Just telling you what I see
They won't say about themselves so let me speak!
See, none of us is perfect and we know
But the devil uses that to have us at each others throat
So, for the people who disagree
Or anyone we hurt
Just know our passion's for the body
It's the church!
And tho' we all in different lanes
The focus still the same
Show the world there's freedom in Jesus name
Yeah!

Who are the fighters
The conquerors, survivors (Put up your lighters)
Who is victorious
In the glorious King of Kings?
You've gotta know we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
Wooooa, sing we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
Yeah, get it right!

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Do me a favor
Put your fist in the air
So all our opposition
Can know that we here
You better look em' in the eye
And tell em' come if you dare
I'm chosen to suffer with Christ
This the cross that I bear
This ain't a rap thing
I never met a fan at a show
I have brothers and sisters
All behind my back whenever I flow
Don't want to rap no more
I rather let they stories unfold
If you don't mind
I'll like to let you hear some things that they wrote
See how Nathan had leukemia in 2004
Mike's motorcycle crashed and almost everything broke
Brenda had addictions that she fought with her soul
My prayers are the blood of Christ
Keep making them whole
So, for the girl who like to cut herself
I'm hoping you know
That God ain't forgot you
Your pain's what he want
Meaning your overcome is through Alpha, Omega
And one day I know that this will be all behind us
Trying already to get my crown ready
Hope's the term regardless of what the world tell me
If you believe I hope The Lord keep your faith steady
I know my champions will rise even though the weight's heavy
