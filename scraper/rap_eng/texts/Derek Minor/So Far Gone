They say if it feel good, then do it, I feel good, but blew it
They say it's ok to sin, just make sure that you don't abuse it
Now I'm out here on this island by myself, all that's left
Is this Buddha on my breath, can't you see I'm tasting death
I know that is pure evil, it consume all my people
They act like it's not illegal, that's why I'm feeling this needle
First time I did it, I was gone, now I'm on
Got this feeling in my bones and it won't leave me alone
At first I thought it was cool, now I just feel like a fool
'Cause I am a slave to you, for you there's nothing I won't do
There is nothing I won't sell, this gon' send me straight to Hell
I tried fixing it myself but every time I always fail
That's why I'm...

[Hook- Niya]
So (so), far (far), gone (gone), gone (gone)
So (so), far (far), gone (gone), gone (gone)
I'm surrounded by darkness, live my life with the heartless
I've been chasing what I feel, Lord that's why I am
So (so), far (far), gone (gone), gone (gone)

I've been hooked on you for oh so long
Even though I know that it's wrong
Feel that aching in my bones
To have you when I'm alone
And on that Internet
I get every shape and size I want
See it's this lust inside my heart
Turn these women into objects
A twisted dollhouse that I play and hide
So you can't find it
Sin has made me deaf, my conscience scream
But I don't hear him
Wicked thoughts
Death inside my brain like aneurysms
At first I thought it was cool
Now I just feel like a fool
'Cause I am a slave to you
For you there's nothing I won't do
See I hide it oh so well
This gon' send me straight to Hell
I tried fixing it myself
But every time I always fail
That's why I'm...

I do not want to stay away
Lord please draw me near
I do not want to stay away (no, no, no)
Lord please draw me near
