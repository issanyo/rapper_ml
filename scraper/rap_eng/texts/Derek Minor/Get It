We in the M off Tillman
Posted with Young Jones
Yup, kin up in the building
But I ain't tryna rap to you
I'm just tryna rap to you
For them boys that flodgin with ya matic put the strap to you
Cause homie a go getter
Stacks on deck and front like a cold killer
Think he gon' live forever
But that gon' happen never
Plus playing in these streets
You'll get a slug through your sweater

So I'm on my grind, got truth up in my mind
And Jesus on my mouth, I let 'em know he lived and died
Tryna be a city light, got that JSon in my ride
Romans One-One-Six, Unashamed all the time
Hoping you feel the same way
Cause you can come up on that guap and die in the same day
Yo momma and yo cousins be cryin' at yo wake
And the wrath Christ ate be dumped on yo plate (yup)

Ayye you know what it is
Out for my kin let 'em know the truth live
I take it where the hood get it in
Bring it back to the block for you again
We in the streets like
G-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it
G-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it

Yup, you know what it is
Running off your friends with that Jesus talk again
Back like I never left, PRo get it in
Let 'em know the king live while they sippin' on gin
I pray to God that you ain't running with G's
The four fifth turn your North Face into swiss cheese
In the Devil's symphony, you're Ray Charles
Blind, but still playing with keys

Hey, I see it everyday B
Cats chase coins, Mario, Luigi
But never get the prize that they seek
He just locked in a box like Harry Houdini
But can't escape this one
It's either pine over bars, pick one
But maybe you'll escape right now
But one day be in flames, Hot Boy, Juvenile

Ayye you know what it is
Out for my kin let 'em know the truth live
I take it where the hood get it in
Bring it back to the block for you again
We in the streets like
G-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it
G-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it

Now if you're feeling like a pimp then
Go and brush your shoulders off
But you can be a pimp and catch something you ain't brushing off
And women don't give it away to get 'em
If you only finding dogs, prolly lookin' in the kennel
It's the reason God tell us not to fornicate
Cause you don't wanna find out if he's the daddy Maury Povich's way
And don't believe what Beyonce sing on it
Cause if you try, prolly never put a ring on it
Love is kind, love is patient
He don't love you baby girl if it ain't worth the wait then
Yeah I'm throwing salt at your game cause you a slug
If you out there making babies you don't plan to raise
The Bible make it clear, one man, one woman
Joined together, never severed, forever and ever
You looking like I did you wrong
That's why we get in it to put you on, YUP

Ayye you know what it is
Out for my kin let 'em know the truth live
I take it where the hood get it in
Bring it back to the block for you again
We in the streets like
G-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it
G-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it, g-g-get it
