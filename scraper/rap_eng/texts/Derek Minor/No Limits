[Hook: Rio]
We know (We know)
That you're on our side
We go (Yea, yea)
Ain't no limit to where we go (No, No)
If we let you have control (Yea)
Ain't no limit (limit) (Naw, Naw)
No, no, no, no (4x)

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I'm looking down on the sky
Soaring on out of the atmosphere
Let me educate you boy
If you don't know what's happening here
I've been riding in my lane ever since
I let Him steer
Leaving all my troubles
I don't plan on going back this year (Nu uh)
That's the only option
No matter what you tell me
Keep Freddy out my dreams
No nightmare on Elm Street
Couldn't beat this kryptonite
I used to be a loser
Hooked on Lex Luther
Now I'm super-duper
Hooked up in community and looked at (?)
Now we marvel at His glory
You can call us X-Men
I've been called to duty
Christ made me a soldier
Even though I'm winnin'
He on the controller

[Hook: Rio]
We know (We know)
That you're on our side
We go (Yea, yea)
Ain't no limit to where we go (No, No)
If we let you have control (Yea)
Ain't no limit (limit) (Naw, Naw)
No, no, no, no (4x)

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Now I ain't Mystikal
But I ain't the same since they done Murder-C
You can tell me you all you want
But sin no longer Master P
I let the gospel super shock em
Hopefully you feel me
Phinu you got the hook up
Holla if you hear me
But I ain't on that Block-O
I'm no longer negro
Fighting everyday though
Just like Cain and Abel
Cause Christ was true to me
When your boy was dead wrong
So I go hard for the body
Get my Mr. Serve on
Man I used to date the world
Thought we was in love fasho
Now she callin me her ex
I don't fool with her no more
Truth up in my heart
I can live without it
That's just what I'm on
Call me [?]

[Hook: Rio]
We know
That you're on our side
We go
Ain't no limit to where we go
If we let you have control
Ain't no limit
No limit
No, no, no, no (4x)

[Bridge: Rio]
There's no limit for me now
Feels like I'm flying
And it don't feel like I'm lowing down
Cause I beleive You hold me up
You've got it all planned out
You're the controller
And once you've found me
No one can ever take me

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
I ain't gotta worry bout a thang
You still got the rains
Hit the target everytime
We know nothing's out your range
And even though them haters wanna block us like Mutombo
We keep fighting
Claws scratchin'
Guarantee we ain't gon run though
And you can keep your box
I put my faith in the ruler
See chains are for slaves
Boy my name ain't Kunta (No)
No more working on this plantation
My emancipation is true
Keep on livin free
Keep this Gospel in my roots
And yea they talkin
Blah, blah, blah
They yappin ain't a factor
Cause our faith is in Christ
He got our back like chiropractors
All that hatin gotta moonwalk
And they movin but it's backwards
Cause God protects His children
He won't lead us to disaster

[Hook: Rio]
We know (We know)

If we let you have control (Yea)
Ain't no limit (limit) (Naw, Naw)
No, no, no, no (4x)
