[Intro]
Welcome to Minorville
Where the bigger the better
Where the flashier the greater
My world's not based on who I am
But what I have

[Verse 1]
I came up from the bottom
Said hello to satan
Before I crack through the earth's crust
(What, all they do)
Post up, drink good, and smoke blunts
When I was coming up
They were clapping at ya'll
But nowadays the chopper's givin' applause
See, if the love of money is the root of evil
It's no wonder this culture brainwashing our people
Hey, why else would college graduates parade around as dope boys?
Dumb their whole life down, Oh boy
He got a bad dime piece tho
While she gon' bare it all for a tv show
Networks making tons of dough
We out here looking like CB4
I feel like you must of missed it
Put here your whole society around riches
While kids in Africa put water on they wishlist
We buy a couple more Benz's

[Hook]
All I hear is
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Ahhhhhh ahhhhhh Yeeah
Mo' money
Mo' cars
Bigger house
(Mo' mo' yard)
More fame
More applause
Why settle for that
When you could have it all

[Verse 2]
Flippin' through a hundred channels, it ain't nuthin' on
Then I heard this preacher say he praying for my soul
But, if I really want the blessings of the Lord to shine
I need to buy this magic oil for $9.99
So if I put this chicken grease on my fo-head(forehead)
And spin in five circles like you said
You're telling more and have no debt
Even though my credit bad and I ain't even got a job yet!
I smell a crook here in the castle, I ain't talking fashion
To sell hope for broke promise 'em all a mansion
To Turn God into a genie
And you Aladdin
Makin a fool out of the church while the world laughin
See you ain't gotta be a Christian to know that this is fishy
When the church like casinos with slot machines missing
Yo' congregation put food on they wish list
I see you buyin' more Benz's

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Buy my new CD when it drop let your friends know
When you try to book me for a show, here go my info
I'd by lying if I tell you some time
It's just to get dough
And I say "Just cause my family matters
I can't have my Wins low"
Our Father who are in Heaven who bless this flow
I wanna Stellar, but I'll settle for a Grammy tho
I want to be a movie star at least give me a cameo
Overlooking all the Lord's done before
Look, I got everything
My wife's a fly dame
Bunch of Twitter followers will
Gas me up like Octane
I get love in The South
A lot of artists say you're hot man
Plus, The Lord saved me
It's supposed to be 'bout His fame
I know people are losing business
By jocking from my position
While I steadily look at Heaven
Beggin' for somethin' different
The Father gave me everything on my wish list
And now I'm dreamin' bout Benz's
Hands out like

[Hook]
