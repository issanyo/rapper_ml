[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, Minor, Minor, Minor, Minor
All-conference, Bel-Air Academy
Jacket inside out; I know they mad at me
Ha-ha, yeah

[Chorus]
Aye I'mma feelin' like Fresh Prince
Yo, Fresh Prince
I might mess around and call Will Smith
Yeah, Fresh Prince
Aye, I'm feelin' like Fresh Prince (Fresh Prince)
Yeah, yeah, yo, Fresh Prince (fresh, yea)
I might mess around and call Will Smith
Yeah, ya, Fresh Prince (Fresh Prince, Fresh Prince)

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhere between Martin Luther king and '99 Master P
I might pull up in a tank with RMG beside me
Nashville Tennessee, yea you know that's where I be
How you do this without a deal, I told em God signed me, aye
Don't try to check me
I serve a rapper like Geoffrey
Prolly why most of em salty
So I drink they tears like a Pepsi
I pull the card of a rapper that act like he play for Bel Air and he ballin
I told em, show me them racks bet that he dance round the truth like he Carlton
If it ain't about progress, it's dead to me
They want the soul food and I got the recipe
Talking to God and he told me I better be
Acting like royalty, acting royalty uh
They tell me when you at the top, it's lonely
I don't believe em, I brought all my homies
They was with me, all we had was Rice a Roni
Just a bunch of kings, trill only

[Chorus]
Aye I'mma feelin' like Fresh Prince
Yo, Fresh Prince
I might mess around and call Will Smith
Yeah, Fresh Prince
Aye, I'm feelin' like Fresh Prince (Fresh Prince)
Yeah, yeah, yo, Fresh Prince (fresh, yea)
I might mess around and call Will Smith
Yeah, ya, Fresh Prince (Fresh Prince, Fresh Prince)

[Verse 2]
Outside the car, dark skinned like Vivian
Inside the car, light skinned like Vivian
How many times gotta tell you I'm different
Can't fit my throne in that box that y'all put me in
And the difference is this independence that I'm living
Try to get you in attendance
Any opposition trying to stop the kingdom that we building
Man, I hope they all offended
Don't know who we are so I'm telling it
Whipping this cut through yo hood like a chariot
Dodging these Judas Iscariots
Trapped in this system that wanna make us slaves and then bury us
So glory hallelujah, I know they watching my maneuvers
So I ride the beat like it's a Uber
You want the truth I'll bring it to you
Jesus the king and I'm a prince
You see it in my fingerprints
Gave me new flavor I'm running with
Keep my old flow mane just pay the rent

[Chorus]
Aye I'mma feelin' like Fresh Prince
Yo, Fresh Prince
I might mess around and call Will Smith
Yeah, Fresh Prince
Aye, I'm feelin' like Fresh Prince (Fresh Prince)
Yeah, yeah, yo, Fresh Prince (fresh, yea)
I might mess around and call Will Smith
Yeah, ya, Fresh Prince (Fresh Prince, Fresh Prince)
