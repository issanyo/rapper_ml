[Intro]
I've been to hell and back
But I ain't going back
That's why I been on my grind
That's why I been on my grind
You told me I gotta shine
Boy we ain't losin' this time
So you know...

[Hook]
I don't, I don't, I don't quit
I ain't got no quit in me (whoa, whoa, whoa)
All I got is within me (whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Verse 1]
My teacher told me I would be nothing
No more Reach some said I wouldn't sell nothing
Said we ain't talking bout money
Then boy we ain't talking bout nothing
Well I thank God He turned nothing to something
Boy I hear you talking that talk
I pay no attention to that
We ain't taking no loss
Tell me how you how you love that
This is not my plan
This is the plan of the Lord
Homie thank God I fear no man
I know what I told you before

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I told you, I told you, I told you,  I told you, I told you,  I told you before
They trying to hold you, hold you, hold you, hold you, hold you right down to the floor
I just got my team and God and that's all that we need with this message we tryna get out
Look to my left and my right and they out here with me
Plus you know Who is holding it down
So you know...

[Verse 2]
I been the bottom the barrel
I been the bottom the barrel
I've been so deep in the dark of the hole
If you come down it probably have scared you
Then they would say that they got you
Til it's time to get you
Then they forget you
Til it's time to hit you
Then they dismiss you
Til you shine again
Now they back with you
Look at that
Boy look at that
Everybody fighting over little scraps
I think the devil trying to sell our soul if the money and the fortune and the fame is where it's at
I don't believe em though
Still Minor and major even if I'm broke
If there's only 10 people at my main show
I treat it like it's an arena I just gotta though

[Hook]
I don't, I don't, I don't quit
I ain't got no quit in me (whoa, whoa, whoa)
All I got is within me (whoa, whoa, whoa)
