I'm bumpin' truth off in your speakers you can hear for miles...
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
My music loud
You can't shut us down
I'm bumpin' truth off in your speakers you can hear for miles
Yeah, turn up this music, I bet the streets will follow
Remove the dome off of that whip, I call it sleeping hollow
My subs beatin', the boys speakin' this Country Grammar
I met this Jewish carpenter and now I'm goin' hammer
Bump me inside your hood like Trayvon Martin rallies
Hopin' if the church get involved, it won't ever happen
Again, you see this vision boy I'm on a mission
They smoke in Memphis, I don't mean barbecue competitions
Yeah, repot lemme get it back
Prayer, tell me are you really feelin' that?
I'm a try to make it hotter than the summer like Alex Trebek then jump in these so I'm a give 'em facts
My dawgs off in the streets, and yes they facin' giants
They got these rocks in they pockets, but they ain't met Goliath
They chasin' bread, but never get a chance to bite it
So I put my soul food in these speakers, go'n and amplify it
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
My music loud
You can't shut us down
I'm bumpin' truth off in your speakers you can hear for miles
Yeah I keep it real so they feel it, talk about I lived it
2 Chainz round my neck, I'm ridin' around and I'm gettin' it
Got a couple tats on my arm, 116 tat on my soul
And my folks out on the same thing, it's Jesus till we gone
That's for my gatos on the west coast where they wearing flags
But they ain't playing football and that bullet ain't a pass
Aye, why his pants sag or what's his pistol doing there?
Y'all worried about his dreads, I'm praying this: we ain't gon' get pushed back
PRo the Mouth of the South and I'm calling out believers
Lord have mercy, my folks is thirsty and we Aquafina
He posted with his Nina till he get put on TV
First 48, he singin' like Anita Baker
One day we all gon' have to meet our Maker
I pray that he's your friend 'cause if it's beef, that's angus steak bruh
And he'll set that on fire just like Flambe
But I'm all this buffet, so before we pray...
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
My music loud
You can't shut us down
I'm bumpin' truth off in your speakers you can hear for miles
