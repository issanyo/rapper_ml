It go Ka-boom
Re-new
Every time that I think of You
I explode
So gone
Just like fire in my bones
What kind of love is this
That swap life for a righteousness
And take all of our punishment
To save us from what we should get
To me that is so crazy
That faith alone can save me
That through one sacrifice
I'm reconciled to He Who made me
So now I never want to live another second
Or a minute of my life with-without You
Cause you bl-bl-blow my mind, but I guess (guess)
That's just what you do
You blow my mind
It go Ka-pow
What now?
I just can't figure You out
I try to pin You down
Then you just switch up Your style
So infinite my time is spend tryin' to pull You closer
Then I find out, it wasn't me pullin' but King Jehovah
You make it hot or colder
Put water in a boulder
There is no end to You
You can't decay as we get older
So now I spend all of the minutes of my life
Tryin' to get (get) to know You (You, You)
Cause you bl-bl-blow my mind, but I guess (guess)
That's just what You do
One day You took my world and set it on fire
My fuse is lit so there's no way that I can live without 'Cha
I'm so consumed with all my moves that say, "I'm all about 'Cha"
You blow me away, you blow me away
