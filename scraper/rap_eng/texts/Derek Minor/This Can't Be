Gotta be more than running the streets
I'm surrounded by insanity
This can't be what You meant when You made me
This can't be what You meant when You

"I know you got some change
And I ain't even gon' lie, I'm tryna get a beer mayne"
That's what he said to the lady on the avenue
She shrugged her shoulders
Said this dollar's 'bout what I could do
So, he took it with pride
Hardknock life, he just took it in stride
Just the way it go down in the place he reside
You win some, you lose some
It's a heck of a life
But something in his heart say that this ain't it
The Earth that God made is good
I know that it ain't this
Am I the scum of the city
Like they say I is?
I'm made in Your image, this is all I get?

[Hook- Jenny Norlin]
Even though it's all that I see
Gotta be more than runnin' the streets
I need to be free
Evil keeps talking to me
I'm surrounded by insanity
This can't be what You meant when You made me
This can't be what You meant when You
This can't be what You meant when You made me
When You made me, this can't be, when You made me

"I heard you looking for a good time"
That's what she said before she hopped inside a guy's ride
Half an hour later, she get the money off the dresser
Stay high to deal with all the pressure
She know her actions put purity in the casket
But view herself as a object of satisfaction
Just a toy to be used by boys
They get what they want, I get what I want
It's all joy
But something in the heart say that this ain't it
My body God made good
I know that this ain't it
Am I a tool to be used
Like they say I is?
Made in Your image, this is all I get?

[Hook]

We look to the sky, Like Lord, why?
Where does our hope lie?
I see my homies die
Or in a life of crime
Creation groans for more than
Distorted pictures
But never look to the painter
For ways to fix it
He laid the answer clearly
Through all the scripture
Faith in Christ rely on the Holy Spirit
Get it?
God sent His only Son
He was crushed so we could be
Washed in His blood
Rose and ascended, one day He'll return
For the faithful who believe
Put your burdens on the Son
What we see now, this ain't it
There'll be Heaven on Earth
But this ain't it

[Hook]
