[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
God got me, we about to blow
Do it for the love, I don't do it for show
Way, way up, I can't come down
With my city on my back
I ain't holdin' back
I don't care if you watching, no, no, no
I don't care if you watching, no
I don't care if you watching
Sleepin' on me, I ain't bothered
Yeah, yeah, I'm in the pocket
I don't care if you watching, no

[Verse 1: Deraj]
Rappin' like I never get another chance to do it
I've been rapping since legit
Better act just like you knew it
They be rappin' for the views
I be rappin' for the view
I ain't talkin' 'bout the six
I be on the move
I'm just rappin' for a few
I don't need a bigger crew
Homie, clear the room
All my people comin' through
Me and just a couple dudes
Givin' all my energy
I've been rappin' like it's ten of me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
At a table with my enemies
Feel like Neo with the Trinity (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Keep it, keep it one sensory
Man, it's cool they ain't feelin' me (what?)
But you never gettin' rid of me
At your door like it's delivery
Hopin' that you take it literally, ha

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
God got me, we about to blow
Do it for the love, I don't do it for show
Way, way up, I can't come down
With my city on my back
I ain't holdin' back
I don't care if you watching, no, no, no
I don't care if you watching, no
I don't care if you watching
Sleepin' on me, I ain't bothered
Yeah, yeah, I'm in the pocket
I don't care if you watching, no

[Verse 2: Deraj]
I don't know if they been feelin' me
I don't know what's gotten into me
I been straight wiggin' off top
Like Donald Trump versus Hillary
I been snappin' on these tracks
Like a black chick with a attitude
Doin' spoken word on a Tuesday
With a stank face, that's a number two
Run with you, run it dude
I'm givin' all bars
Why you actin' like you all heart?
You gotta be kiddin' me
Yeah, you lyin' brother, bro, you all scar
I been rollin' with some all-stars
Down to ride like OnStar
Transform like an All-spark
Can't move like the car parked
Well anyway, anyway, anyway
I don't be actin' brand new, man, I been this way
I swear I don't do this for none of your Benjamins
Sometimes I'm rappin' on tracks for the men
And get all your favorite rappers, like ten of them
I swear there's nobody like me like synonyms
And they say they verses on ten, well that's tentative
Swear they all can can serve like it's Wimbledon
Lately I've been feeling underrated
I've been waitin' for somebody else to say it
I'm a Christian but I still feel like I be needing validation
This is way bigger than me
Tryna make it on the rap stage or the front page
I've been thinkin' 'bout some higher places
Conversations in the constellations

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
God got me, we about to blow
Do it for the love, I don't do it for show
Way, way up, I can't come down
With my city on my back
I ain't holdin' back
I don't care if you watching, no, no, no
I don't care if you watching, no
I don't care if you watching
Sleepin' on me, I ain't bothered
Yeah, yeah, I'm in the pocket
I don't care if you watching, no

[Verse 3: Canon]
Back in business, bruh, I'm happy for you
I'mma let you finish, keep the cameras rollin'
Thought I told you
This is how litty it gets, woa
I got no chain on my wrist, yeah
Learned to give credit but it was His
Yeah, the One above us, don't forget it
No, I ain't gotta be rich, yeah
I'm content livin' like this
Feed my family, put some bread on it
Then multiply it with the fish, yeah
No limit, no limit, I push it, yeah
I do what I do cause He lookin', yeah
They ain't even gotta notice me
But I'm on the stool with the cookie
Could be rookie of the year
But I'm over it
What's important is a new me
I'm under the One who redeemed me
So let 'em all overlook me
Everybody want it big, nah, let's not
I'm just tryna catch a breakthrough
I ain't gotta be the one to get famous
Bro, I'm just tryna be faithful
Now they hatin' cause they hateful
You love God, they gon' hate you
Better pick a side bruh when you doin' this
But we've been doin' what they can't do

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
God got me, we about to blow
Do it for the love, I don't do it for show
Way, way up, I can't come down
With my city on my back
I ain't holdin' back
I don't care if you watching, no, no, no
I don't care if you watching, no
I don't care if you watching
Sleepin' on me, I ain't bothered
Yeah, yeah, I'm in the pocket
I don't care if you watching, no
