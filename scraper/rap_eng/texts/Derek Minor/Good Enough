[Hook: Camille Faulkner & Derek Minor]
I don't ever listen what they say
Plus I got a feeling they don't like me anyway
That's okay, I'm good enough
He said I'm good enough
And every single time I'm on the role
They be trying to tell me who I'm not, but I know
That I'm good enough
He said I'm good enough

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Yeah, yeah
Okay
I've been on a mission, trying to dodge a villain
Telling me that it's a better me and I can't get 'im
Did you here bout so-and-so? It look like he winnin'
Comparing me to what's-his-name, but I on't-e'en pay attention
Trying to move me out my zone, I only pay a visit
Speeding in my lane this year, I only payed a ticket
I can't be who you say, just who God has made me
Anything else is too fake, ugly like Sheneneh
You so crae-zy
Oh yeah, I'm doing okay (doing okay, yeah)
Oh yeah, I'm done with this roleplay
Y'all gon' have to take me like I am this year
If Jesus made us in His image, this right here the mirror
This the mirror, hey

[Hook: Camille Faulkner & Derek Minor]
I don't ever listen what they say
Wave
Plus I got a feeling they don't like me anyway
That's okay, I'm good enough
Wave, wave
He said I'm good enough
Wave, wave, wave
And every single time I'm on the role
They be trying to tell me who I'm not, but I know
That I'm good enough
Wave, wave
He said I'm good enough
Wave, wave, wave

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Okay
I looked in the mirror, my reflection, it looked back at me like
Whatchou doin'?
Who you trying to impress?
Tell me whatchou provin'?
Some people, they so shallow
You can shine your light all day but they gon' only see the shadow
Now when I'm talkin' light: let me address some things that people scared to mention
(I'mma talk about it)
Quite frankly, some of the biggest haters like to say they Christian
Dang, why you gotta be that guy?
That always put the flaws on other people like, never give people grace even when they try
Let me open your closet, is there somethin' to hide?
I'm just saying homie
Less talkin', more prayin' homie x2
Let your words bring life and less decay, homie (no decay)
I'll give you time to work it out
Cause you don't wanna be the one I'm bout to sing this hook about
