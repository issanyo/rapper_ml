Uh, what up girl, it's been a long time
Since I picked up this pen and told you I'm glad you're mine
Forever together, nothing can separate us too
And if love is scary, baby you my Boo
First time I saw you my homies said I was crazy
My mind is an art gallery, pictured you with my baby
I took your hand as we walked through the sunshine, lady
Said "get from under that tree, them other dudes are shady"
See I was broke, didn't care about my profit
So that sealed the deal, I looked for rings like signing
You held me down in this love, I swear that I ain't forgot
You deserve diamonds on your finger the size of Ring Pops
And when my shoe was untied, they said the boy was trippin'
She looked past it all, straight patient with him
You a thief girl, you stole my heart
I ain't goin' nowhere till death do us part
See we in love that's strong, what it mean
She independent, but don't mind still calling me king
They say it's old school for you to be my only queen
Well if we primitive, you fly as Pterodactyl wings
Uh, I know I do some things you don't prefer
I'm a chiropractor, get all on your nerves
We get in arguments, sometimes we say some hurtful words
But through that, we see the way that Christ loved the church
I'll protect you girl, your man's loyal
And Lord have mercy on anyone who put they hands on you
We one, and when they hurtin' you they hurtin' me
Never wanna see you cry to me, that's an emergency
Your superhero chop the dark night, Batman
Or call me Superman, nothing like your X-Man
I can't believe the Lord put this gift in my hand
Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, woman
