[Intro: Canon]
Ay this that wild music
That loud music
Start a riot in the crowd music
That jump around and get sweaty
Throw them elbows in they eye music
I'm sweaty, get a towel music
That 808 shake that ground music
That walk around in that Kroger
Then go act a fool in that aisle music

[Hook: Canon x2]
This that track that make you be right down yo block
This that track that make you be right down yo block
Bumpin' crowd we too young and wild
Bumpin' crowd we too young and wild

[Verse 1: Canon]
Ay this that wild music
That loud music
Start a riot in the crowd music
That jump around and get sweaty
Throw them elbows in they eye music
I'm sweaty, get a towel music
That 808 shake the ground music
That walk around in that Kroger
Then go act a fool in that aisle music
Go ride around with no top boy
Ain't lookin' round for no cop boy
Beat the beat down the block boy
Bump and no tryin' to turn down boy
Summertime it get hot boy
Trip around in my zone boy
I'm Gucci Gucci get loud music
I'm good cousin, I'm gone boy
If your shirt's still dry you ain't geeked up
All my partners round ya are inked up
Ten toes deep you know we linked up
Got the Spirit in us homie, we G'ed up
Y'all know when we act up
Everybody start acting up
Follow me as I follow Christ
And I saw the King and got jacked up
I'm wild, true that
Not stupid foolish
My speakers, I blew that
And I'm RMG and y'all knew that

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Ay this that wild music
That loud music
Bodysurfing the crowd music
Big boned my body type
But I'm that dude that might do it
Elbows, Mutumbo
When I come through y'all better move
My home girls up in there
Messing up they hairdo
Now King Kong my bass
Sweat all on my face
I don't think you should hate, homie this ain't the place
Y'all know what it is, tattooed on my skin
1 1 to that 6 go and get like this
Beatin' right down the block and my truck is swerving lanes
Hanging all out the window yelling I'm unashamed
Yo momma and them keep looking at me like he insane
And they might be right, so give me space
Try to put me in a cage ain't no way to lock me
I done hopped out my grave but I ain't a zombie
My life so different and them boys knockin
Bass beating, bells ringing
You can call it Rocky

[Hook x2]
