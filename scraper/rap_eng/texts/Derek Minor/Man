[Chorus]
Look me in my face, I'm a man
If you talk behind my back, say it to me, like a man
I never leave my family, they're my blood, I'm a man
I never back down, I'm goin' out like a man
Like a man, like a man
Handle business like a man
'Fore I live like a coward, I'ma die, like a man
If I ever fall, I'll pick myself up, like a man
And I pray to God, whew, face my fears, like a man

[Verse 1]
All I know is hustle (hustle)
All I know is hustle (hustle)
You ain't on your business, I don't know if I can trust you
Oh I'm taking care of mine
Look my children in the eye
Tell em', you won't miss a meal, 'long as Daddy still alive
I stand on my word, I won't take it back
I'd die over mine, as simple as that
So even If I don't get platinum plaque
I build all my gold and then turn it to scholarship ahh
Ten toe down, always on the ground
Look me in the eye, I don't play around
Secure the bag and break it down
Invest that home to build community
I only buy from people down the street
I eat, you eat, you eat, they eat, we eat
I bring the sauce, bread and the cheese
A pizza party all on me, scratch that all on God
I'm blessed on blessed, Corolla Lex with Rolex on wrist
But my investment's by my estimate
Leave a heritage to my testament

[Chorus]
Look me in my face, I'm a man
If you talk behind my back, say it to me like a man
I never leave my family, they're my blood, I'm a man
I never back down, I'm goin' out like a man
Like a man, like a man
Handle business like a man
'Fore I live like a coward, ima die like a man
If I ever fall, I'll pick myself up, like a man
And I pray to God, whew, face my fears like a man

[Verse 2]
I am not your boy, don't you call me that
I'm really a king I been on mission take my throne back
Pull up on you like the liquor store, where the crown at
They just go in circles try to stop me, that's a cul de sac
All back in my bag and got it jumpin' that's a set race
Shoot my shot like Reggie Miller, you can't net pace-err
Uh yeah, if you been sleeping, I make you aware
I keep killin' checks they gon' leave me the chair
My injects are lethal, My hustle is lethal
I see like an eagle, they watch me like Vevo
My movements will teach you, I'm here for my people
Break it down, break it down, welcome to class
Welcome to we ain't coonin' for a dollar
Look inside the mirror all I see T'Challa
Revolutionary, Jesus saw a problem
Stand up like a man
Stand up like a man

[Chorus]
Look me in my face, I'm a man
If you talk behind my back, say it to me like a man
I never leave my family, they're my blood, I'm a man
I never back down, I'm goin' out like a man
Like a man, like a man
Handle business like a man
'Fore I live like a coward, ima die like a man
If I ever fall, I'll pick myself up, like a man
And I pray to God, whew, face my fears like a man
