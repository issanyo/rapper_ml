[Hook]
On the cross [repeat]
We die and we ride
We die and we fight

[Verse 1: Chad Jones]
The Cross is my battery
Charge me up for casualty
But i barely see it passionately
Feel I live too passively
I'm asking now for boldness, I ain't prayed for that ever
It's crucial to loving you, ain't no cowards in Heaven
Christ came as fully God concealed himself in human skin
Courageous, take the punishment that was served for human sin
Then tagged me in like wrestling match we brothers now the Hardy Boyz
The cross of course, the hardest chore, unrivaled against the Father's Joy

[Verse 2: Tony Tillman]
On the cross where His blood spilled
He's the Lamb that was killed
He showed His love's real when they lift Him up on that skull hill
And though I was ill I couldn't see pride had me sitting so high
But contact with the truth brought me low, dang what a buzz kill
Now I know how love feels, I used to be numb but He made that better
Living in a place so froze without the Son is so cold but He changed that weather
Owed my soul but He made that settle, paid my debt it was paid forever
Then He rose and He slayed that devil, that's the promise in the garden when he made that sweater

[Hook]
On the cross [repeat]
We die and we ride
We die and we fight

[Verse 3: Canon]
Now I ain't never seen his glory burn so bright before me though I see it now I tremble in my bones
I thought he was the type of GOD to strike me down and place in his judgment line awaiting just to hear that I was wrong
Surely I was wrong
Instead he had his arms wide open saying Canon come its time to come home
Now listen this your daddy talkin' to you, oh yes boy I may whoop you but that's all because my love is so strong

[Verse 4: Derek Minor]
Lead me to the cross, where your love poured out
Take me to the brook, where your brought Fraser
Where I drink your love, it's never all gone
That mountain I'm a die on, this my Hillsong
I confess that I'm nothing, the pit of death I could plummet
My sins expensive, how you fit that in the budget
Cause you God, ruler of the universe
Sovereign king, died for me, redeemer of a wicked earth

[Hook]
On the cross [repeat]
We die and we ride
We die and we fight
