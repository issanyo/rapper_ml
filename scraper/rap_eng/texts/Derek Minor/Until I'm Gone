[Intro: Derek Minor]
See I've been in the game for a minute
It's been a crazy ride
No matter where I go
One thing we all have in common is
We all have crazy pains and crazy hurts
And every time I want to give up, I can see it in their faces
And I start thinking, "I can't give up!
Can't give up."

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I've been in so many places
And I see pain all on my people faces
So I'mma tell 'em about Your love until I'm gone now
Until I'm gone now
And I got a whole lotta livin' I'mma do
Now, I'm finally winning and I owe it all to You
That's why I'mma give it all I got until I'm gone now
Until I'm gone now

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
I came up from the bottom
I came up from the bottom
And I ain't even supposed to be here if it was up to y'all
And I think God had different plans for me
Different plans for me, oh yeah
I gave Him all of my problems
Yeah, I gave Him all of my problems
He told me if I trust Him, I'm His son, and don't worry about nothin', don't worry about nothin'

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
This for my people that struggle to pay off they light bill
In they heart man, they wonder if Christ real
Or the next meal
I can tell you how that life feel
Political pawns in the hands of the people that make all the laws
They set up the game, so we only ones losing
Don't act so appalled
And we failed
We been held in these chains long enough
I rebel what they sell
Let this light shine in us
I'm trying to show the world what I've seen
He can turn clay to a king
Do you even know what that means?
Do you even know who you supposed to be
Well let me tell you?

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I've been in so many places
And I see pain all on my people faces
So I'mma tell 'em about Your love until I'm gone now
Until I'm gone now
And I got a whole lotta livin' I'mma do
Now, I'm finally winning and I owe it all to You
That's why I'mma give it all I got until I'm gone now
Until I'm gone now

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Cuz' I don't know how to fix this
I'm just trying to survive the tempest
I'm just trying to pray God will hear this
I feel like they got us on their hit list
I've been on a mission
Impossible, Tom Cruise flew in the old school
Think of how some kids only eat in the lunch room
And they wonder why they fight in their home rooms
How can you focus, when hunger is potent
There is lead in the water of poor
But you wouldn't notice
Your head is so far up in the clouds on a very high horse
We at war with ourselves
While at war with each other
Just know I'll never give up on you
All of my sisters and brothers
Oh don't you worry now
This ain't the end of the story now
No matter what comes or what go, we gonna hold you
The truth that we hold, we gonna hold it down, yeah
This is that motivation unadulterated
This for the people that say when they felt like giving up
We gon' make it
Hit the shot at the buzzard, it's still a win
What I'm saying is as long as you still alive, better try again
What I'm saying, the morning is coming
Time to rise and shine again
Time to get back on the grind again
For everybody that be getting up
Let me see your hands high again
Let em' know

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I've been in so many places
And I see pain all on my people faces
So I'mma tell 'em about Your love until I'm gone now
Until I'm gone now
And I got a whole lotta livin' I'mma do
Now, I'm finally winning and I owe it all to You
That's why I'mma give it all I got until I'm gone now
Until I'm gone now

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Gone now
Gone now
I'll give You what You deserve
That's all I need
