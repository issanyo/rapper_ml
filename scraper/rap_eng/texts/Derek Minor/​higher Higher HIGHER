[Pre-Chorus: Byron Juane]
They tell me the sky's the limit
And I'm going over you
All of my bag, I'ma win it
I'ma keep going up, I won't fall

[Chorus: Byron Juane]
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I was living at my brother crib
I was sleeping on my brother couch
Dreams used to keep me up at night
Now I'm living what I dream about
I'm thanking God, I'm thanking God right now
So high above, where I was, I don't wanna look down
Came a long from Backwoods and them dirt roads
How I made it out, only Lord knows, guess the Lord shows
You hear my heart in these sessions, these song my confessions
Please, won't you listen my lessons
It'd be a lie to say my focus was on God all the time, but He still love me right

[Pre-Chorus: Byron Juane]
They tell me the sky's the limit
And I'm going over you
All of my bag, I'ma win it
I'ma keep going up, I won't fall

[Chorus: Byron Juane]
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

[Bridge: Byron Juane]
I got it going up now
With my way up and I won't come down
There's a lot of things I don't want back
So high up, seeing clouds now

[Chorus: Byron Juane]
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
I've been waiting my whole life
Working, grinding, way up, oh my
Used to punch in line from 9 to 5
Now from 9 to 5 I punch line
If you never let your dreams die
Throw it up for me one time
You gotta keep living up to your purpose
It ain't that far out your reach
No, you not perfect, knew that this was certain
I know who you destined to be
You reflecting all the greatness out the Son
You the one who a star
You the one I can't wait to see what you, you become
I just know that we go, going up

[Pre-Chorus: Byron Juane]
They tell me the sky's the limit
And I'm going over you
All of my bag, I'ma win it
I'ma keep going up, I won't fall

[Chorus: Byron Juane]
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

[Bridge: Byron Juane]
I got it going up now
With my way up and I won't come down
There's a lot of things I don't want back
So high up, seeing clouds now

[Chorus: Byron Juane]
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

[Outro: Byron Juane]
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
