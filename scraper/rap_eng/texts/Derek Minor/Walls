[Chorus: Jordan Frye]
We build walls
All around us, all around us
Try to keep what we don't know
At a distance, at a distance
We don't listen

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Now if I stood on a corner and asked you for $2 for a Whopper
Would you let your cynicism stop you? Would it stop you? Would it stop you? I mean would you?
I mean we spend $9.99 on Spotify, but hearing my stomach rumblin', not worth a dime?
Not worth a dime? Not even one?
Look, or if I had suit and tie, maybe I’d be worth your time?
Only money on your mind, cuz we are so selfish
Jesus walked with the poor
Are we too good for that?
Kissing up to God in our prayers to get a promotion
To make more money and buy more things, that we don’t need
That we just buy to show off for the next guy and still feel poor inside
Still feel homeless as the person that we just denied
By the way, how have you treated the least of these?
Pride and money, are you a slave to them?
Cause you ain't gotta be black to pick cotton off a shelf of an
H&M

[Chorus: Jordan Frye]
We build walls
All around us, all around us
Try to keep what we don't know
At a distance, oh, at a distance
We don't listen

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Pray to God for the day that we can
Put our guns down and see Him in all of our faces
Can't you see with the hands of the master we made?
But we don't enjoy the creation of art on display
So blind when we look at each other
I don't want you not to see my color
See our differences are not the weakness
And in this puzzles we gon' need the master's master pieces
Feel like we all conceited thinking you'd be better if you was more like me
Not knowing it was God that made you more like you
Made in His image, we are all His kids
So if I look down on you, I look down on Him
I'm a sinner, you a sinner, what's the difference?
We all need love, joy, Jesus, and healing
We got a lot in common if we would just listen
Instead of building more walls, let's build more bridges
Let's build more bridges

[Chorus: Jordan Frye]
We build walls
All around us, all around us
Try to keep what we don't know
At a distance, at a distance
We don't listen
