[Hook]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey where you goin'! where you goin'!
We give our life for the king and you know it!
Everybody get buck with me, get buck with me, get buck with me, get buck with me
Now give me elbow room, give me elbow room, Now give me elbow room, give me elbow room
Everybody get buck with me, get buck with me, get buck with me, get buck with me

[Verse 1- PRo]
My wife, my family ain't seen me like this
I told my mama I ain't never goin' quit
He done made me alive I ain't worried 'bout my health
If I ever turn around it's like I'm killin' myself
Where my soldiers at?
Right here, Right here, give our life for the cross we ain't got no fear!
Yeah I know it, We marching strong
Boy we got our armor on (It's on)
And we goin' set it off
Till we finally see our final throne

[Verse 2- Chad Jones]
Here's the Truth in 3D clear, No glasses though
Your visions jacked-up, kaleidoscopes
We goin' home, what's the big hurry
The truths is sweet black and white McFlurry
See sin is like a water cycle, 'vaporate and come right back
Rainin' down on everybody, flood the earth just check the map
Make us wanna get the cash, stack the checks true collectors
Now we're showin' his glory new projectors

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Tony Tillman]
Uh, everything I have I lose it
Trusting in Christ I got something to gain
And nothing to lose I give up my life for the cross and it's never the same (nah)
I'm lettin' Him rule, cause livin' my life on my own can bring nothin' but pain
And livin' for strength, nothing can change
I'll pour out my life and now nothing remains
Yeah, I'm just a vessel for the master's truth
Givin' my life for the faith, I wanna imitate everything the master do
Get buck when we say through the master's grace
Walking in love with the master's crew
Can't wait till I see my masters face
Tell the whole world I'm passing through

[Verse 4- Canon]
We coming with the fellas who be living unashamed of the gospel
Anybody wanna rather get it with Father
Perfect model, for the Father we will take gun shots
(brakabrakabrakabraka)
Can't nobody tell me that He really never died
In the grave never living, and ascended up high
Ha, you get high high, man I'm in and like "In and no lie"
When I'm coming get up out my lane
PRo's hard in the paint, Chad Jones, Brothatone pumping up like veins
Too strong coming and they running and beginning in believing in the Father we running
Ha, can't nobody stop us but our King
Can't nobody knock us, knock us
We're hotter then weather, now put it together, we coming harder then a
"I'm done"
