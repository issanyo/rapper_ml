[Chorus: Jordan Frye]
We build walls
All around us, all around us
Try to keep what we don't know
At a distance, at a distance
We don't listen
We don't listen

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Now if I stood on a corner and asked you for $2 for a Whopper
Would you let your cynicism stop you? Would it stop you? Would it stop you? Would it stop you?
I mean, I mean we spend $9.99 on Spotify, but hearing my stomach rumblin', not worth a dime? Not worth a dime? Not worth a dime?
Look, or if I had suit and tie, maybe I’d be worth your time?
Only money on your mind, we all selfish
Aye, Jesus walked with the poor. Are you too good for that?
Kissing up to God in our prayers to get a promotion
To make more money and buy more things, that we don’t need
We just buy to show off for the next guy and still feel poor inside
Still feel homeless as the person that we just denied
By the way, how have you treated the least of these?
Pride and Money, are you a slave to them?
Cause you ain't gotta be black to pick cotton of a shelf of an H&M

[Chorus: Jordan Frye]
We build walls
All around us, all around us
Try to keep what we don't know
At a distance, oh, at a distance
We don't listen

[Bridge: Jordan Frye & Derek Minor]
I'm keeping my head up (I'm keeping my head up)
Keeping my head up (I'm keeping my head up)
Keeping my head up till the walls fall down
I'm never gonna give up  (I'm never gonna give up)
I'm never gonna give up (never gonna give up)
Never gonna give up till the walls fall down, no
I'm keeping my head up  (I'm keeping my head up)
Oh, I'm keeping my head up (I'm keeping my head up)
Keeping my head up till the walls fall down, yeah
I'm never gonna give up (I'm never gonna give up)
No, I'm not gonna give up (I'm never gonna give up)
I'm never gonna give up till the walls fall down (yeah)
Till the walls fall down (never gonna give up, yeah)
