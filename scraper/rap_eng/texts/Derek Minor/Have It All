(G-G-Goonies never say die!)
Yeah! PSA Volume 2 mayne
We back!

He on the grind
Hustlin' till his bank gon swolle'
No rubber bands homie cause his bank don't fold
Make it rain, sips of Ros√©
But it's gon catch up with him one day
Partner you can have it all (you can have it all)
I said you can have it (you can have it all)
Cause even if you ball, you never be king of it all
That's reserved for the Lord, dog you can have it all

They say this paper make this world spin
Chase sin, get dough till the world end
Back in the day I was in love with the world then
But then I kicked her to the curb she was my girlfriend
Hey, she said that I can never leave her
But now I'm married to the Lord, no prenup
Still acting like I need her
But all this truth in the way I can't see her

I don't need the money and dough to make me
Hear what you murmur here and Imma take heed
If I go back she'll probably play me
A lot going on it's more than you see
Anti-swag, I ain't looking for approval
I'm killing what's inside of me that's looking for approval
Weird, I want this pride in me to disappear
Cause if it wasn't for the Lord I wouldn't be here
So while you chasin' chains with piece the size of chandeliers
I make a toast to the King, cheers!
