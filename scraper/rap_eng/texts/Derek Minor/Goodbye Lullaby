[Intro]
(Ay ay ay)
Gun shots in the night (oh oh oh)
Sing a lullaby
Sing a lullaby (ay ay ay)
When I close my eyes (oh oh oh)
I just wanna say goodbye, wanna say goodbye (ay ay ay)
Gun shots in the night (oh oh oh)
Sing a lullaby
Sing a lullaby (ay ay ay)
When I close my eyes (oh oh oh)
I just wanna say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Everyone tellin' me I need to calm down
I've been goin' crazy, feelin' like I'm losin' it
Though I got it all now, the Devil he been waitin'
I've been on his menu, guess I'm finally in his claws now
Trying to avoid the fall now, steal my innocence
I need to repent, I am not perfect
You should now that by now
I've been medicatin' everything away
I'm just trying not to ever feel the pain
I already know that it's wrong
Quit talkin' to me, leave me 'lone
I member some people that say they the light
They be the ones that bout to make me heartless, darkness
Skeletons all in my closet, Skeletons turn into monster

[Chorus]
If there is a God and you're right here and you're listening
I'm tired of it all, oh I'm tired of it all
'Cause I see death in my nightmares
In my nightmares, in my nightmares
In my nightmares, in my nightmares

[Verse 2]
I got voices in my head that always come and talk to me
And my fear is Freddy Kruger cuz they stalk me in my dreams
I see slave ship, guns, clips, gang colors, prison cells, dope fiends
Jim Crow, Jim Beam, pills, lean, no justice, no peace
Felonies and misdemeanors
Wondering if we curse
Can I get my degree first?
'Fore they murder me, no degree first
It's America we get the green first
You feed the poor but its greed first
Livin' water but I die of thirst

[Chorus]
If there is a God and you're right here and you're listening
I'm tired of it all, oh I'm tired of it all
'Cause I see death in my nightmares
In my nightmares, in my nightmares
In my nightmares, in my nightmares

[Outro]
But just when I was drowning
Surrounded by a sea of my own darkness
Then light broke through
And just as I was swallowed by my own fears
Then light broke through
Now all I see is you, you, you
God all I see is you, you, you
All I see is you, you, you
All I see is you, you, you, you
