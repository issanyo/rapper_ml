[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I put the game on my back like a Jansport
Pay attention, you might learn more
Follow God, increase your test score
Swerve out your lane, it's a crash course
I'm in east Nash sipping lattes
Or Pinewood with my padres
Planning how we bout to change the game
We're undefeated in this 2K
This adversity, my university
I just learn from my mistakes and become better me
I feel like His greatness is inside my anatomy
Be mad at Jesus, that's how He crafted me
And you too but you do not notice it
You too busy tryna keep with the Joneses
You too busy trying to stunt on your socials
You ain't living life like you supposed to (blast off)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I been feeling like they trying to hold me down
Hold me down yea
But every time I fall, I never touch the ground
Touch the ground yea

[Chorus]
I keep
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh

[Verse 2: Deraj]
Look in the sky it’s a bird it’s a plane
Superman on the loose
On the high road or the lowest of lanes
It don’t change in the booth
With a 16 bro you know I can hang
Boy I flow with a noose
Hit the stage, yeah you know what it do
RMG, yeah you already knew
I promise God is a friend of us
I don’t think you want to scrimmage us
I don’t think they really getting us
I don’t ever plan on giving up
Every time I fall I’m getting up
On the real they couldn’t hold me down
So I don’t know what else to talk about
You just know you need a telescope
Cause I don’t think I’ll ever touch the ground
I never touch the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
And I been feeling like they trying to hold me down
Hold me down yea
But every time I fall, I never touch the ground
Touch the ground yea

[Chorus]
I keep
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh

[Verse 3: Byron Juane]
Feeling real good  (Yeah)
Feeling real good (Yeah yeah)
I don't mind yeah
Nothing like this
Nothing like this
Taking off here
Space Jam feel
Rocket built
Feeling real good (Yeah yeah)
I don't mind yeah
Nothing like this, this
Nothing like this
Taking off here
Space Jam feel
Don't you see that I keep blasting off

[Pre-Chorus]
And I been feeling like they trying to hold me down
Hold me down yea
But every time I fall, I never touch the ground
Touch the ground yea

[Chorus]
I keep
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
Blasting off like an astronaut yea, oh my gosh
