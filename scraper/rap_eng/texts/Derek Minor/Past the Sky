Woke up this morning, kissed my wifey, then hopped outta bed
About to go ball, I got these shorts and lotion on my legs
Walked right in the gym, "I'm a pick you, him, and him"
Tryna get a triple-double like you, jumper on, I'm killin' them
After the game was over, somebody in a wheelchair rolled up
I ain't recognize him at first, he came closer, I'm like "hold up"
Can't be, wait that's my dawg "I ain't seen you in a long time"
He said, "I hear you blowin' up, but I'm glad to see you still on your grind"
I was like, "what happened?" I remember us hoopin' back in the day
He said, "I almost forgot, you ain't even seen me since the tenth grade
Well long story short, it was Prom Night, I was in my Chevy
Drunk driver ran the red light, hit me, it shoulda been deadly
I survived, to a wheelchair I'm confined
Lost my legs, I survived, still got life, I'm a thrive"
That had me rocked, I ain't even had nothin' else to say
Looked right at me man...
Then he said...
"One day it'll change
Things won't be the same
They say I'm crazy, but I'm sane
Next time, I'm a fly right past the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky)
Fly right past the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky)
Fly right past the sky"
Pain excruciating
Wrinkled skin, arthritis, but yet she's still amazing
Her grandson kissed her on the cheek, "what's up, Big Momma?"
She gripped his hand, cracked a smile and asked, "Where yo momma?
Tubes all in her nose, IV, hospital clothes
I don't think she got long, in the bed tryna hold her own
He said "she comin', " "Ok, have a seat, I wanna talk to you
I know you up in these streets, and just dropped outta school
Yo pops gone, you in my home, and I ain't raised no dummies
I got spat on, dog sic-ed on, hit winter holes for you buddy
He said "I know, " she said "I don't think you do
'Cause if you did you wouldn't waste your life out here, you ain't got no clue
This cancer has spreaded, already know where I'm headed
I served the Lord, he gave me joy, and I hope one day that you get it"
He put his head down... "Boy, get yo head up
I'm finally free, don't cry for me..."
Then he said...
"One day it'll change
Things won't be the same
They say I'm crazy, but I'm sane
Next time, I'm a fly right past the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky)
Fly right past the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky)
Fly right past the sky"
