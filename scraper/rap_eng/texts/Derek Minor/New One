[  Verse  1: Chad Jones]
Satan going at my heart like hyenas on a fresh kill
Chad you got swag get her bagged wit ya' mad skills
I recognize the lie wanna run like the cops coming
Fight against my deeper need? I scared to let my heart jump in
Boom pow, Afraid my heart can catch a beat down
Plus I know that sin can't help my deeper needs now
Under the lie tho, Where's a truth that needs exposing
If Sin is calling I ain't Goin
If truth is calling what's my  emotion?
"Hello."
"What up bro? Where you at?"
Demonized needs get ignored until a bigger trap
I figured that, God don't care bout Fun,  I ain't his devout Son
What I wants invalid
Don't give in to that
My heart is crying out to experience redemption
Overjoyed at my selection but while I’m here it need attention
The Gospel gave my heart a voice and Jesus always listened
Your heart is screaming at you too, but you only hear whispers

[Hook: Derek Minor]
Instead of falling back and retreat, I just wanna be accepted
Instead of fighting lust inside me, I really wanna feel passion
Instead of life in survival mode, I want a life full of expression
God you made my heart good, but it be lying to me daily
Uhh, I need a new start
I need a new one
I need a new one
I need a new one
I need a new one
A new start with a new heart
Yeah, a new start with a new heart
I need a new one
I need a new one
I need a new one
I need a new one
A new start with a new heart
Yeah,  new start with a new heart
I need a new one

[Verse 2: Tony Tillman]
Cause this old one got all this trash on it
Can't see my face in the mirror I got this mask on it
Phantom of the opera, my life is damaged from past moments
I need a new one, something fresh with the tags on it
Yeah, thoughts of the future are horrifying, this broken vessel leak out the power you pour inside
I need a new body, this old one's sort of dying, to occupy i was thinking something more glorifying
Put me on your spinning wheel, shape me like your hands do, mold me like some pottery and make me something brand new
Brand new, water me until I'm tall as bamboo
Put your yoke around my head and shoulders like the shampoo
I’m trying to reach this destination in a wrecked car
It's a hard drive, and i ain't tech smart
I know my character don't always play the best part
Therefore I'm always praying asking for a fresh start

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canon]
A change of heart, transplant, take the garbage in me out like a trashcan
All I see is dark nights like I'm batman
But all I wanna do is bear the fruit and that's my passion
These idols in my heart
On the real tryna keep me battling
Should I follow what I thought was right
Or  should I  follow what the heart keep passing me?
She fine and yeah she classy, she look good but yet she nasty
On the real tryna get my haha
But I'm tryna duck when she daffy
Her feet keep chasing after me
But that ain't all that's after me  folks
Put you life on a stage that sits to high you bound for tragedy
From heaven I get my gifts
At first they like those gifts
But when you use your gifts and spit whats real to the world
They hike yo gifts  But I ain't gotta fight like this
They all approve of what you say plus what you do
But then again when you get up in they grill
They all gone slaughter you I promise you
This battle tryna please these folk who love you is my animal
They throw rocks, I ain't shatter proof '
Lord, do what you gotta do
