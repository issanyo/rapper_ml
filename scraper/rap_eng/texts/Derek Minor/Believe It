[Intro]
Yes Lord
Oh yes Lord, yes Lord
Thank you choir, for that amped beat selection
Brother Cardec, you got them sounding mighty fine today
Nah nah
Bigot, I'm a need you to stand in front of the door
Oh, you may need to stand in front of the door
I believe I'm a say somethings and folk ain't gon' like tonight
Oh, you ain't gon' like me...
Can I testify? Can I testify?
Judge:
By now you should know that I mean what I say and you better believe it
I just tell you once, I don't repeat myself so you better believe it (you better believe it)

Believe it
You better believe it
X3

[Verse 1]
Please pay attention, everybody better settle in
Minor get to preaching on these tracks like a reverend
Not like, some of the ones in the spotlight
On private jets, better straighten up and fly right
That treat the church like a brothel, yeah they prostitute the truth
How many people gotta die tonight before we stop preaching to the choir
They get scared when I talk about the drugs, and the gun
And the hood, and the poor, like if we don't pay attention it won't happen any more
In the suburbs, where the money at, we'll send it overseas before they send it to Chicago
Cops kill a kid, bet they talk about Chicago
Yea the hood is messed up, pray before you judge tho
Who finna stand up
Can't turn my back on the culture, be a vulture
I approach ya, and tell you how my family in hood
And it ain't looking good, so if I move to L.A
I'll never be Hollywood
Yes this's personal, it's a not a show, if it was just for dough
What's the point of even doing it for?
When there's people that I know straight hooked to dope
I got truth that they need know, let me talk about it

[Hook]
By Now you should know that I mean what I say and you better believe it
I just say this once, I won’t repeat myself so you better believe it
You better believe it x8

[Break]
Oh yes Lord, yes Lord
Choir, y'all better get it together
Let me preach

[Verse 2]
They don't wanna hear what I gotta say
They don't wanna hear what I gotta say
They don't wanna hear me talk about how Sunday service
Is the most segregated time in the USA
What kinda sermon do you think that preach to everybody watching
Here's another man shot and we don't talk about the topic
We don't even pray about it, all we say about it
No comment, don't rock a boat about it
I ain't scared, It don't matter what the cost, I'mma say it
Till there's prices on my head, and I'm dead
Go to Chucky Cheese if you looking for a token
I'm only bout spitting real truth that's potent
Fighting for the found and the lost, slave and the free
And I'll give my life cause he gave it for me
I speak for a king and we made in his image
When you looking at yourself, His reflection in the mirror
Gimme me the mic, run it again, y'all in my aim now
I'm running from nothing, I give em the key, unlocking the chain now
I say what I want, and I'm keeping it real, that is the way now
I know what I'm doing, they seeing the movement
It's making em ready for change now
Give it away now, give it a, give it away now
Give it away now, give it a, give it away now
A lot of people talk and I ain't heard a thang now
And if I say it, then believe it right away now

[Hook]
By Now you should know that I mean what I say and you better believe it
I just say this once, I won’t repeat myself so you better believe it
You better believe it x8
