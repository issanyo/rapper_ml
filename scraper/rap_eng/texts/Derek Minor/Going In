I'm going in (16x)
I'm goin'
Now that I'm up from the dead
Ain't no way I'm turning back
I don't like my grave no more
You you can have it back
I'm going in (8x)
I'm goin'

Hopping out my casket trading in my-my tuxedo
For this Unashamed Tee rep-rep-repping for my King though
I was dead and broken 'til maker He make me alive
Two bolts in my neck you-you can call me Frankenstein
I been set ablaze on the fire with the Flame
Well I'm not from the Louis but I got Clear-Sight
You see the way that we be living unashamed and it make em wanna ride
That's why we fight
Why would I ever change my endeavor
Turn away from the faith I say never
Trials in my face is making me better
You can hate all you want but I bet I
Keep my nose to the grindstone long as the spirit live in me
The fruit I bear is proof He's there through the fire purging me
They look and stare but I ain't scared ain't no way they merking me
And if they do His Word is true boy His blood has purchased me

I'm going in (16x)
I'm goin'
Now that I'm up from the dead
Ain't no way I'm turning back
I don't like my grave no more
You you can have it back
I'm going in (8x)
I'm goin'

I wish they would hold me back Don't they see me grindin'?
They go'n have to turn my lights out I'm too content on shinin'
Ya my shoes may be clean but my fingers extra dirty
Got my hands to the plow if this music thing ain't working
I don't care about a plaque or a trophy bearing my name
I hock a loogie on the fame just tell em I'm Unashamed
Nothing odd about my future 'cept the 3 within the Trinity
Only reason I'm doing this hey you ain't gotta remember me
Mock me on the message boards drop me 'til I hit the floor
I'm just getting up and they won't stop me 'til I'm with the Lord
Hey from my hood North Korea to Baghdad
If I get martyred tell my kids to follow their dad

I'm going in (16x)
I'm goin'
Now that I'm up from the dead
Ain't no way I'm turning back
I don't like my grave no more
You you can have it back
I'm going in
I'm going in (8x)
I'm goin'

Hello
I'm goin' in this ain't a game until the end I'm unashamed
Hey I been bought with a price this ain't no longer my life
This thing is Deeper Than Rap that's why I call it Blacklight
I'm goin' in you already know passenger seat gon' ride with the flow
But I take a back seat since He's in the lead
Man I play the Background He's in the starring role
Man that's for real baby we Go Hard for the Lord up in His glory
With no Pause 'til the end call it curtain call
Man no game since it forfeit sin business call it corporate
Man I'm out this world cause He keep me going in circles Orbit
But He save's and it's clear that's the reason I am here
So until my casket drop make Him known without no fear

I'm going in (16x)

Ain't no way I'm turning back
