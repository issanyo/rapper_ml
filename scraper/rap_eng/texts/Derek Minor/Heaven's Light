[Hook: WHATUPRG]
Lift Him on, lift Him on, lift Him on high
Paradise, won't suffice, I need more life
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High
Lift Him on, lift Him on, lift Him on high
Paradise, won't suffice, I need more life
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High

[Chorus: Marissa Jerome]
How high I climb to find Heaven's light, Heaven's light, Heaven's light, Heaven's light, oh
How high I climb to find Heaven's light, Heaven's light, Heaven's light

[Verse: Derek Minor]
High above (high up, high up, high up, high up, high up)
On the way to be high above it (high above it)
Oh my, oh my, oh my God I just need to be where You are (yeah)
That's right, surfing on the cloud, I could touch the sun
How you like me now? Can't nobody bring me down, down, down, down
Thought you were focused
I'm staying clearer than I ever have (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
High above, I've been stressing
I've been having the right senses of Heaven
I've been feeling like I'm closer to Jesus
I could call up an angel for a feature, high above

[Hook: WHATUPRG]
Lift Him on, lift Him on, lift Him on high
Paradise, won't suffice, I need more life
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High
Lift Him on, lift Him on, lift Him on high
Paradise, won't suffice, I need more life
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High

[Chorus: Marissa Jerome]
How high I climb to find Heaven's light, Heaven's light, Heaven's light, Heaven's light, oh
How high I climb to find Heaven's light, Heaven's light, Heaven's light

Hey son, this is mom. I'm just calling to let you know  that I love and stay focused in the things that God has called you to do. We have to learn that no matter how high we fly that we have to keep the main thing the thing. The main thing: your relationship first with God. Son, savor the moment on where you are. Don't become an island all by yourself and you'll take the heart of God. Don't get so consumed with things that you forget about the main thing. And the main thing is Jesus Christ. The One that gave His life that we all could live. And I just want you to be the best you that you can ever be. I love you, son. I'll talk with you another time

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
Yeah, high above it all, high above it all
Yeah, high above it all, high above it all

[Hook: Derek Minor]
Lift Him on, lift Him on, lift Him on high
Paradise, won't suffice, I need more life
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most High
Paralyzed at the sight of the Most â€“ High
