[Pre-hook]
I dream on my grind I stay down with my team I (x3)

[Verse 1] Byron Juane
I've been away I gotta do it again
I am not here for a million
Book of wisdom in the ear
Now shss shss that's costly
Y'all don't know what it cost me
Been about it for some years now
But look momma I gotta deal now like
Death don't spot I'm swippin
I got this work I've been hiring
Been putting up [?] for the [?] flow
Taste so good I let them play for the [?]
I got the key to the streets yea
I got the keys to the street yea
You wanna see what I [?] yea
God got me feeling real deep

Life is [?] life is everywhere and I had to make it through
I had to make it there
I just had to see I had to help myself
And now we love it all super saiyan yea
This is for the underdog, you can not be underdog
We'll be writing this from my living room yea
You just need the bread from the deaf
And the space from his life yea call this a living room yea

[Hook x4]
I dream on my grind I stay down with my team I

[Verse 2] Derek Minor & Byron Juane
Teacher said I wouldn't be nothing
Now we get paid to teach em something
Rap fans used to sleep a lot
Minorville was their alarm clock
Now that they say I'm coming up
Empire with the molotov
Set fire to the whole game yea
We reflect the only one who's great
God the one that get the credit
I'm supposed to fry unless y'all chillin
And check your car I don't get the message
Killing everything someone get the medic
Oh y'all think I'm lying, say it with your chest
You used to eat [?] for dinner, lunch and breakfast
Breaking everyday sharper than [?]

[Bridge]
These days I'm pulling up to shows in my PJ's
Just to remind to the rap trees about their sleep days
I'm about to retire like Kobe or MJ
And pass it on to Byron [?]
