[Verse 1: Chad Jones]
OK I'm chillin, Wooly mammoth
God you working so no panic
I'm see 'em out there workin' too
I hope it ain't for status
I get s'posed to cultivate, steward, let you motivate
All in all controlled by grace
I'm chillin' in a hammock
Lessons learned from years before
Tryna give myself a name
I Couldn't Birth a situation
R. Kelly taught me thangs
Half on baby
Ain't enough I need you workin' I am just a seed

[Verse 2: Derek Minor (PRo)]
They be like PRo you swag is legendary
Keep chasing that glory, boy it's necessary
And I reply no bueno
Me no comprehende' and i ain't working for no queso
By the way though
Don't gas me up like Texaco
Working for that status
Have you chasing man's approval
But you never win that race so
I refuse to buy purchases, he done paid for
Christ blood, best currency trade, oh

[Hook: Chad Jones & Derek Minor (PRo)]
My Lord done put in overtime to let the time that I have
Catch me working, i been grindin' what he already had
That's why I get it, That's why I get it, I get it, I get it
And I and got to pull none, Lord thats why I focus on you
Hey. Christ did all the work, He done paid my dues
Thats why I get it, Thats why I get it, I get it, I get it

[Verse 3: Canon]
Now don't get it twisted a man gotta work
But I ain'tgotta work to be down with church
Everything given as a gift no works
Man I've been given this gift no curse word
Now in the beginning was that
Before the beginning was that
The Lord he  been given us slack
Bro I'm so down with this cat, though I sinful, (rats!)
My Sin was a trick, I remember saying I was in love with you
Now I don't even sweater, Cliff Huxtable
I use think this bull about being Christian was comical
But he got me like my Jordan my record is untouchable
I honor you

[Hook: Chad Jones & Derek Minor (PRo)]
My Lord done put in overtime to let the time that I have
Catch me working, i been grindin' what he already had
That's why I get it, That's why I get it, I get it, I get it
And I and got to pull none, Lord thats why I focus on you
Hey. Christ did all the work, He done paid my dues
Thats why I get it, Thats why I get it, I get it, I get it

[Verse 4: Tony Tillman]
My Father's rich in mercy i just enjoy shopping
I ain't gotta work for nothing homie I'm spoiled rotten
Salvation's mine and i know that homie
I can never lose it, it's like i got a lojack on it. (it's insured)
In good hands like All State, yep all day
Mayne i got security like project hall ways
I don't dont fall away, i trust Yahweh
He got me in His palms and idont care what ya'll say
My mind done been renewed and now i think with better sense
The Father calls the Son redeems the Spirit takes up residence
We share His benevolence, grace is my inheritance
He elected us before creation call us presidents
So catch me in my airforce unos
Kicking truth like apologetic judo
For salvation mayne i ain't gotta do no
Work and to stay saved i ain't gotta earn kudos

[Hook: Chad Jones & Derek Minor (PRo)]
My Lord done put in overtime to let the time that I have
Catch me working, i been grindin' what he already had
That's why I get it, That's why I get it, I get it, I get it
And I and got to pull none, Lord thats why I focus on you
Hey. Christ did all the work, He done paid my dues
Thats why I get it, Thats why I get it, I get it, I get it
