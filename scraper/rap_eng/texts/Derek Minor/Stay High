[Verse 1]
Hey, no
You can't catch a bird while it's flying in the air
No, you gotta wait 'til it comes to the ground
And you can't stop a saint while they're in full flight
No, the devil's gotta wait 'til we come down

[Chorus]
So, I'll stay high
I ain't coming down for no reason, I'll be reading my Word
I ain't coming down for no satan, I'll be praying to my Lord
I ain't coming down for no sinning, while I'm living for my God
I ain't coming down for nobody, no I'll just stay high

[Post-Chorus]
High, high, high
So watch me fly
Fly, fly, fly

[Verse 2]
See, we've all got targets on our back
'Cause all Heaven and Hell knows our worth
So, I'm standing guard 'cause life's coming hard
Soon as we walk out of church

[Chorus]
So, I'll stay high
I ain't coming down for no reason, I'll be reading my Word
I ain't coming down for no satan, I'll be praying to my Lord
I ain't coming down for no sinning, while I'm living for my God
I ain't coming down for nobody, no I'll just stay high

[Post-Chorus]
High, high, high
So watch me fly
Fly (yeah), fly, fly

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
(Through Jesus we're more than conquerors, c'mon)
No, you can't bring me down at all
You can't bring me down
When God is more than every circumstance
You just hop over the competition like Jordan
I'm opposite the jump, man
So on Your grace and mercy I will fly
When they hate more, I'll pray more
Yes, Lord, imma stay high

[Post-Chorus: Both]
I'll stay high, high (I will stay) high, high
(So watch me) fly, fly, (like an eagle imma) fly, fly

[Bridge 2: Both]
Even when the service is over (just stay high)
And when your friends stay rolling in the dirt, no (just stay high)
When your family make you wanna curse, no (just stay high)
Someday, we all gotta learn to (just stay high)
Mount up with wings like an eagle (just stay high)
Know you've got a purpose, so (just stay high)
Don't ever let them bring you down, now
You just gotta (stay high)
And you don't even need them drugs now, you just gotta (stay high)
I know that it ain't looking good now (you just gotta stay high)
And don't you worry about tomorrow (you just gotta stay high)
God gave us strength to (stay high)
You just gotta stay high
You just gotta stay high
You just gotta stay high
Stay high
You just gotta stay high
