[Verse 1: Ruslan]
Falling from the sky can you believe it
Living for the day and not the weekend
Feeling so good, I'm a way now
They so new school but on the wave now
I am just the man that they wanna be
And I don't mind if they start in front of me
And I could be as [?] as I wanna be
I'm treated like a daddy, there's no that you are sonnin' me
Upset I've seen enough shrimp to raw
I don't wanna make myself too comfortable
Long as my family straight, I'm on a roll
Baby this is all in faith, I'm kinda cold
Rewind
Brace yourself the quiet storm is coming
I'm conflicted, I should give the warning
Can't conform cause I can see the finish
Soon or later they gon' have to listen

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Keith]
Walked with God and got aligned
Had a lot up on my mindstate
Tried to tell me there was no way
So I had to move my own way
Walked with God and got aligned
Had a lot up on my mindstate
Tried to tell me there was no way
So I had to move my own way

[Chorus: Jon Keith]
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that

[Verse 2: Jon Keith]
How can I not make it to the finish?
Young Mike Phelps how I'm in it
Crown up by the wrist and I'ma live it
Get up out the way if you ain't with it like
MOVE
All I really see is fake bosses
They ain't got hands, can't toss us
They ain't look a thing like Jesus
Why they even tryna cross us?
[?] I'm [?]
Anybody wants to dance, the DoseyDoe
You can see that this the [?], so hold your nose
You ain't seem to get the pic, hold your pose (move)
Hands up high like alter call
You could say we Dwayne the Rock
We Rock and Roll
All the way to Heavens gates
Might slip and fall
I'ma always get back up
Don't stop the show
I'm on one

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Keith]
Walked with God and got aligned
Had a lot up on my mindstate
Tried to tell me there was no way
So I had to move my own way
Walked with God and got aligned
Had a lot up on my mindstate
Tried to tell me there was no way
So I had to move my own way

[Chorus: Jon Keith]
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
I am not a slave to your masters
Prolly cause I own my own masters
Sell your whole soul for advances
Laughing out loud at you rappers
Jokes all on you dog
I'm making moves like U-haul
Had to cut a couple people off
Now my circle lookin' like dot [?]
Hittin' home runs, they just runnin' bases
They switching sides, they just sound wasted
I'm out there running 'round with house money
What's the point in tryna make a deal with satan
I've been watching God just to see his moves
Feeling like I'm on Facetime
Mr. Minor, you just keep it true
Don't you worry 'bout a lil' face time
Agh

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Keith]
Walked with God and got aligned
Had a lot up on my mindstate
Tried to tell me there was no way
So I had to move my own way
Walked with God and got aligned
Had a lot up on my mindstate
Tried to tell me there was no way
So I had to move my own way

[Chorus: Jon Keith]
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
And it's going down like that
