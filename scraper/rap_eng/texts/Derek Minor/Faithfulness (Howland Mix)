[Refrain]
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
We’d came a long way, I mean a long way
I’m looking back on everything You done it’s amazing
Oh I hear You callin’, yeah I hear You callin’
Telling me to run to the light from the darkness
Your love wrecked my life like tsunamis
I let it take me over, now I’m wavy
And they going give me credit but it’s not me, it’s not me
I’m just surfing on Your grace yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Maher]
From age to age the same
Your mercy never changes
Your joy, it is my strength
Your goodness never changes

[Verse 2: Joey Vantes]
You are my strength when I’m weak, yeah
When I fall to my knees, yeah
You lift me up
You fill my cup
Takin me over I can see that tidal wave
Filling my cup I have to give You all the praise
Setting me free it’s like You flip that new page
Hit that reset now I got a new day
Broken in Your hand I rose up again
Came out the ashes I’m destined to win
Taking the good news into every land
You are the rock and foundation I stand

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Maher]
From age to age the same
Your mercy never changes
Your joy, it is my strength
Your goodness never changes

[Chorus]
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
Always and forever
Always and forever

[Refrain]
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
