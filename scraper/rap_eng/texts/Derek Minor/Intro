[Verse 1: Chad Jones]
Uh. Yeah, it's Jones, R.M.G
Watch, I’m back for the 1st time
I’m in a zone like the first word in my last line (time zone)
I can't comprehend it, Not cause of my ADD
But His Court Marshall Mathers and Shady me
I know its Grace, and Christ is the hero
His past changed my Future like Hiro from Heroes
But he ain't get cancelled even after cross hangin
I spread the news like it's Nike - we cross training
If you're Lost Angels or Jersey Devils
If you been buried in sin then He brought shovels
Your heart cold we goin lower
Sin has frozen u we breakin out the snow blowers
Let that marinate, Bro, He callin you
You marinate for too long then its barbeque
You took our punishment, straight got bodied
Still love and wanna love and save u even if you got bodies

[Verse 2: Derek Minor (PRo)]
RMG, it's PRo, let me explain it better
He must be stretch Armstrong, how he Reach Records
They think I'm shining
But I'm just reflecting
My king greater
You should just accept it
I do this for thugs toting 2 Glocks
To get him off death row you need 2 Pacs
Or 3 Snoops, I'm peaking through the scripture lens
And seeing cats a sell they soul just to get a Benz
So I'm going hard, I rep the Lord and I ain't turning back
They flexing hard, on that boulevard, think the world is yours, yea ain't running that
It's one God, He got the blueprint
And he from Brooklyn but he created it
So insane, that they don't wanna bother with the Father
But he coming back so you know
Everybody who believe the word
And come apart of the body
Will get changed and we gone
Fe, fi, Fo, fum
1 blood, God's son

[Verse 3: Canon]
Uh, I'm not your average Christian rapper you will find
Canon's a Christian who can rhyme
Brotha got a parachute when falling
And I  got wings like Marty McFly my futures is back up in perspective
Brotha I'm way ahead of my time
Watch the Times like in New York
I see all these different signs
Which one point us right back to the cross
Everything else leads us to dying
If I'm lying then I'm dying and if I'm dying than I'm frying and if I'm frying
I am Bacon going oink has got me fined, with some I'm sick of trying
Sick of some folk thinking I'm just blind
Really I'm showing you what's inside that's right below things you won't find up in yo average
So let's wrestle I can't wait to Rock you
Savagely I'm passionate but what I see
I'm branching off the vine, what?
Bump this it's a crime, and it's a shame, a that’s been crying
Don't nobody really wanna Swallow this truth on who's been following these lies
And I ain't scared to hold back anything in fact they tell me Naa
Canon go back rewrite your verse Cause they a get offended
If you rhyme what's been eating you inside


[Verse 4: Tony Tillman]
They tell me Tone u use I bang so spit it gangsta then
Switch yo style and make it street
So you can reel them gangsters in
And I reply it ain't my aim to make no gangsta friends
Imma spit the truth if they don't feel it then this ain't for them
Look mayne I can't pretend, I'm changed and you should've noticed/
You want some raps that's entertaining then you should've wrote it
Because my mission is to do what I was called
I suggest you buy some Snickers
If u want some bars that's sugar coated
Is your idea of a mission is to rap cool
A gutter album cover and a body full of tattoos
Some rah, rah in your vocals and a twisted fitted cap
You feel that gives you credibility to reach the trap dudes
Well let me be the first to tell you that you're wrong bruh
You on the right squad trusting in the wrong stuff
'Cause I can take you to some places where the chrome busts
Bones crush, sin's condoned and everybody's gone nuts
I do this for the globe, every creature that receives breath
From the layman to the deacon screaming he's blessed
For the saint struggling wishing they believe less
As well as for the rejects who squeeze techs for respect
Sin ain't just in the good it's all of man kind
The end is close this ain't the time to let my plans shine
So if this joint make me lose points amongst my fans fine
I'm still gone spit the Son until somebody get a tan line
