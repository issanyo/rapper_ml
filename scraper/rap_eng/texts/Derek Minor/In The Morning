[hook - Bizzle]
I know I know I know that life seems strange
Some nights bring rain but (Joy comes in the morning)
And child birth brings pain but it'll fade
When that bundle of (Joy comes in the morning)
This just something for you to struggle to
Just something for y'all to struggle to
Yeshua seen it all so it's nothing new
But when it get hard what you do (huh) muscle through

[verse 1 - Bizzle]
Living on that edge bible under that dresser
Burner under the bed whoever can get whichever (I know)
They say you knew better then you would do better
But it's hard when the dude'll rather put two in your New Era then talk
Such a dilemma living off in that jungle
You don't become a hunter they hunt you that's what it's come to
Tired of being broke when that weed or coke it'll fund you
Livin la vida loca that street aroma becomes you
But as long as your Father is sovereign then He got you
I promise you so just know that the dirt you been through is not you
It's not in you it's on you just gotta dust it off you
And learn to walk in the ways of the God you belong to

[verse 2 - Eshon Burgundy]
What I go through everything that I go through
Gotta remember who my go to remember everything I don't do
Now usually the Spirit is your plentiful and beau-coup
But right now I'm nowhere near and I can't hear it like it's pro tools
Somebody muted the vocals I'm feeling dumb deaf and blind
There's and angel in my spirit but there's a villain in my mind
And there's a killing taking place no saving face for my pride
Set paces and count to five squeeze every drop till it's dry (click)
Now I'm empty sick of this world try and pimp me
They wanna prostitute the truth they in cahoots with the enemy
That circumstance intends to try and convince me God against me
But God is for me and we going through this war we give Him glory

[verse 3 - Derek Minor]
(Uh) Aye let me tell you what my mind on
That single mamma working 9 to 7 yeah her grind on
With a baby daddy she should a never had wasted time on
He selling white rocks on the corner the size of limestone
In the neighborhood the ground red like mars
But this ain't another planet this the blood of a track star
Rap star dentist maybe the next president
We send they souls back to God cause we don't know they heaven sent
Lord when will the murders die (when will they die Lord)
Reply: when I crack the sky (whoop)
I know you mourning but hold on
Joy is coming in the morning
