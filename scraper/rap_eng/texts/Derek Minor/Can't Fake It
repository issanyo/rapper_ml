[Verse 1: Dre Murray]
I represent the King of all kings, Elohim
Kinda like it’s in my genes
But if you really peep the scenes then it seems
That if you check this tall, dark human being
For something holy and clean, I got nothing to show
So when you look into my eyes you see this gleam when I flow
He really hung up on that beam, no dream and I know
I ain’t chasing after a dream, the cream or the blow
The flow mean when I was eight years old, I was soaked
Now the lines tight knit, every time I spit
They say the boy don’t fit, yeah that square gotta go
Something like a misfit, got the right outfit
But he’s one wheel short, yeah that boy kinda slow
Psycho, crazy, outta my mind, maybe
I believe that God that I never seen can save me
Saved me, past tense, these suckas got me past tense
If he the king, then I guess that I’m a prince
Makes sense, don’t it?

[Hook: Dre Murray]
And I can’t take it no more, and I can’t take it no more
Shorty I can’t fake it, n-n-nah I can’t fake it
N-n-nah I can’t take it no more
N-n-nah I can’t take it no more
Shorty I can’t take it no more
N-n-nah I can’t fake it, N-n-nah I can’t fake it
Shorty I can’t take it no more

[Verse 2: Alex Faith]
I would take a bullet for you, right through the chest and I’ll bleed
Let me pull it for you, I wish I could make your eyes see
The hope that lies inside, when it rains, it pours
Wishing y’all could mind read
‘Cause I can’t formulate the nouns and verbs into a sentence
To rightly describe the way I feel about forgiveness
On my best day, I’m worse than the devil is, oh, oh, oh so devilish
Yeah you got that right, forgot about the Lord
Mortifying flesh but I forgot about the war
Glorifying death when I neglect to hit the floor
Knees to the ground, I feel conviction to the core
I can’t take I no more, that’s what Dre said
I’m saved homeboy, I don’t care about what they said
Beyond all of that you know I’m still unashamed
Never faking over here, boy we make it plain yeah

[Hook: Dre Murray]
And I can’t take it no more, and I can’t take it no more
Shorty I can’t fake it, n-n-nah I can’t fake it
N-n-nah I can’t take it no more
N-n-nah I can’t take it no more
Shorty I can’t take it no more
N-n-nah I can’t fake it, N-n-nah I can’t fake it
Shorty I can’t take it no more

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
I was born where the dope boys serve crack fiends on the corner
Swimming in the belly of the beast, I’m Jonah
My pops prolly gone midday on Corona
An Old East sloppy drunk, running from the police
The fact I’m not at your door with a mask on
And a nine mil. at your dome, tryna send you home
He’s the Lord’s real, it’s gotta be in His will
That y’all ain’t at my funeral, reading off my will
I’m a angry, deranged man who’s privy to gang bang
Christ took the wheel of my life, see how I switched lanes
From a fire that’s burning, your boy’s been saved
So thinking nitpicking affect me, you must be insane
Everything I been through, bring me closer to the Lord
He’s still cleaning my mental, give my life away for the loss
Die with the wood on my back, signed a thief on a cross

[Hook: Dre Murray]
And I can’t take it no more, and I can’t take it no more
Shorty I can’t fake it, n-n-nah I can’t fake it
N-n-nah I can’t take it no more
N-n-nah I can’t take it no more
Shorty I can’t take it no more
N-n-nah I can’t fake it, N-n-nah I can’t fake it
Shorty I can’t take it no more
