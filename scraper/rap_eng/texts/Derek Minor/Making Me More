[Intro: Mel Washington]
I'm cruising down the back road tryn'a let my soul take flight
Time, time will tell if i'm ever Go'n learn to live right
Preacher man tells me seek and you will find
Well the Lord God Almighty ain't gonna let me in, oh no not tonight

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Hey I've been running like Forrest Gump, but not through Frank Oceans mind
My futures out in front of me this life behind
You think I got it all get a pretty little penny from show to show
New York Jet Rex Ryan goes!
Uh, Look Many think i'm superman all my music heaven sent
But look under this cape you find out these Angel wings are clipped
Pray for Minorville, a city under fire, signed the, not so incredible Hulk
Derek Minor Yeah!

[Hook: Mel Washington]
Oh, that's enough just because I'm alive doesn't mean I've ever lived
Well I'm sorry to say it but I wish I can trade this all and start again
I'm hoping that your making me more (x3)

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, um oh yeah deceiver
And at times I'm Q-Tip, I got thoughts of Bonita!
Wait get a grip there you go lettin' your mind wander in front of these folks again
Some don't want the truth 'cause when I tell 'em taste and see
They just wanna skip the meal and eat these fortune cookie tweets
But the Lord see's the game from the pressbox
And He seek where we hide in our best spot
And the evil that He finds when He looks at me
Make me wanna hit reset like an Xbox
I know some say Halloween they never celebrate
But wear a different costume almost every single day
That's why Jesus Christ died the most scariest of fates
So the monsters and the goblins can throw their masks away Yeah

[Hook: Mel Washington]
Oh that's enough just because I'm alive doesn't mean I've ever lived
Well I'm sorry to say it but I wish I can trade this all and start again
I'm hoping that your making me more (x3)
