No not mine  your will be done
Screaming i'll will be from the top of my lungs
I'm Always x2
Always for what ever boy

[Verse 1: Fedel]
North that's where I came from
I ain't from where the lanes from
Where pain from stress where your brain from
Them gun shots at nightime
In the wrong place at the right time
The bodies that they might find
Fighting boys that's pain time
At the court practicing that's hang time
Eagle going that's slang time
Cops poppin that's chain time
It's court time rhema[?] time
Where I'm from ain't no snitching
If he with you he down with you
If you go down he going down with you
If you bleed with he bleed with you
I'm down for God worldwide
Great pain and struggle
God's grace will tell them bye
Real winners know how take an L
When I fell I hate the feeling
When I do t I'm off the shelf But I'm true to it
I won't be beat they said I couldn't be
New swag all black saying I will be
Me and my holy in the south
Day 1 ready for whatever
I serve the greatest one ya

[Hook: Fedel]
I'm Always x2
Always for what ever boy
I'm Always x2
Always for what ever boy
No not mine  your will be done
Screaming i'll will be from the top of my lungs
I'm Always x2
Always for what ever boy

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
I don't talk about just put in work
I don't talk about it just go bezerk
I see blind but it still don't work
Keep tricking me I know my word
Talk God on beats real
Sorry[?] I don't preach well
I just snap off with Fedel
Now just put that on retail
I see a world that's full of hate
You dead broke don't see straight
Some of my families I still pray
They moving base like an 808
Moving across on an interstate
On a mission to keep that cake
No ramen noodles on any plates
Just praying to God to change their fates
Running no sweating till i go and get it
Till I finish you should know what i do
Talking Jesus every time you see me
Cause my people need it yeah I know what it do
Lot of people said they dying man
Talking bout it on their twitter page
Jumping everywhere on and off lanes
I ain't tryna end if you ain't bout Jesus
I'm always

[Hook: Fedel]
I'm Always x2
Always for what ever boy
I'm Always x2
Always for what ever boy
No not mine  your will be done
Screaming i'll will be from the top of my lungs
I'm Always x2
Always for what ever boy
