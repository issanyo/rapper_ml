[Intro: Derek Minor]
Now I've been waiting for a long, I mean waiting for a long time
For a new day to come
A new sun to shine 'cuz so far it's cold nights
They always saying it's the wrong time
Why you saying it's the wrong time?
To say bye bye to rain and hello to change
I'm ready for the summer time

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Sorta like Chappelle Show I want a new season good times, bad times feelings uneven
Staring out a window day-dreaming, matter of fact I'm leaving, headed for the ocean

[Chorus: Move Aside]
Ocean waves, come and take me away
Ocean's breeze, pull me farther to sea
Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin
Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
I'm going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, you had to see that coming
The son of man said he would carry all my burdens and that's the truth and I ain't worrying 'bout nothing
And you know I packed all my bags now, leaving worries behind now
Headed to life, there's no room on this ride now
I'm alive now and all I've got is your love on my mind now
I can feel it in my soul that it's a new season I need it, I could give ya 99 reasons
Staring out a window day-dreaming, I'm leaving, I'm leaving

[Chorus: Move Aside]
Ocean waves, come and take me away
Ocean's breeze, pull me farther to sea
Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin
Just stop, breath in, worry's just a deadly sin (2x)
