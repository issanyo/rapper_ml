Have mercy on me, oh God
According to Your steadfast love
According to Your abundant mercy
Blot out my transgressions

It's like I'm trapped in my own self
My frailty sneak up on me, it's so stealth
I know sin trying to kill me dead
But I still wanna eat that bread; why is that?
Such a fool to wanna taste that food
Poisonous, look at Pac, man, it killed that dude
Put nine shots in Fifty, stole the life of Biggie
Pride is so filthy, God be with me
Tell us we good inside, homie, they been played us
See, I'm a heathen at heart, they call it sin nature
And I ain't braggin', just trying to be transparent
I need Your prayers, it's hard for me to manage
And God, at this point I'm trying to feel Your love
Please drench me in the blood of Your son
Though I don't deserve a thing, He had grace on me
I know death the only prize I won

I got the grind, the hustle, but man
I don't wanna wreck Your name
(Don't wanna wreck Your name)
Fall even when I rep Your name
Please, somebody, let me out this cage
(Let me out this cage)
[x2]

See, the praise and accolades, I wanna taste that
See the homeless everyday, but I still want a Maybach
And that's the problem right there, too concerned about me
I'm tryna kidnap Your glory, crush me
I don't deserve the air I breathe
Exactly the reason You let them make You bleed
I'm weak - God, I need a miracle
Surgery, no scalpel, gotta be spiritual
Cause where I'm from
We've been conditioned to hustle hard and get them ones
Even if it means running with guns
Even if it mean cooking crack while you posted up with the thugs
We in hell right now, I can't imagine it with fire
I believe in Christ, can't imagine You a liar
Holy, awesome, only One that can save me
So if it take pain, get a hammer and break me

I got the grind, the hustle, but man
I don't wanna wreck Your name
(Don't wanna wreck Your name)
Fall even when I rep Your name
Please, somebody, let me out this cage
(Let me out this cage)
[x2]

Nothing more than a tool who gazed at the truth
Begging to be used, my whole DNA is for You
But to fight is depravity, easily it's damaging
Cause somehow I wanna make it about me
Made man from clay, blew breath in his lungs
How dare I ever disrespect with the tongue
I'm dumb; you speak and make planets, I speak and make raps
Uh, how can I brag about that?
You perfect, and even if my CD is purchased
If it's not about You, the CD is worthless
And Father, let me see who I am
So for now on I lean on You like kickstands
That's why I'm like, "Give me life!"
If I get to see You, You can kill me twice
I'm a prisoner like Gitmo, born in a sin mode
Only freedom that I see - Jes√∫s Cristo

I got the grind, the hustle, but man
I don't wanna wreck Your name
(Don't wanna wreck Your name)
Fall even when I rep Your name
Please, somebody, let me out this cage
(Let me out this cage)

All the nations You have made
Shall come and worship before You, oh Lord
And shall glorify Your name
For You are great
And do wondrous things
Cause You alone are God
Teach me Your way, oh Lord
That I may walk in Your truth
Unite my heart to fear Your Name
