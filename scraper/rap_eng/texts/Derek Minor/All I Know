All I know
Is I've been down that road before
So you can say what you want
But ain't not way that I'm a be a slave no more
See I ain't goin' back, I ain't goin' back
I ain't goin' back, I ain't goin' back
I ain't goin' back, I ain't goin' back
I ain't goin' back, I ain't goin' back
Hola, let me introduce myself
I'm PRo, hadn't seen you since my first death
I know I'm fresh, not because my swagger right
But the Father sent his Son to die and now I got life
I remember when I was trapped in the lion's den
Freed me from my sin, now I'm tryna get it in
So go'n let them nerds talk, I ain't got no time for 'em
Unless it's breakin' down the truth then I ain't got a rhyme for 'em
Been there done that, a-wasted my life
There's one hit or quit in Christ, I ain't gotta fight
So I put my faith in him, that way I know I'm a win
Was a loser all my life, I will not go back again
The world lost me the day I realized kinky art
Threw the deuce first time I heard 'em say ããã«ã¡ã¯ (konichiwa)
Ain't no one greater, you can have the vanity
I chased it long enough till the Father got his hand on me
Now I got a chance and do believe he got me squeaky clean
Nothin' on my own, I was chosen, now he live in me
Yeah I make mistakes, but in whom I place my faith
Let 'em put him in the grave and he rose the third day
He was perfect 'cause I couldn't be, was lame and had to walk for me
Eyes they was blind, couldn't find him so he saw for me
I put my trust in him, that way I know I will win
Was a loser all my life, I will not go back again
You say adios to the old me, yeah I'm brand new
Light speed to my destiny, you in my rearview
Give it all just to know the King, I don't need your ice and thangs
What I look like livin' life for a piece or chain?
Lame, even if money ain't a thang
Wait up, may you take it all if I put it on your place
Lord you made us with some lava glass, we spit in your face
Ay, you should be the only thing that we would ever chase
So how could I replace living water that I taste?
Never dehydrate on the way to finish race
So I put my faith in him, that way I know I will win
Was a loser all my life, I will not go back again
