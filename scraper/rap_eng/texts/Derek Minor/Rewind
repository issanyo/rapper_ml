Chorus [Nerva]

Sometimes i wish i could rewind
And undo all those bad times
I can only make the best out of now
When i make it out i know they'll wonder how

Verse 1 [Verse]

I lose friends how i lose pens, I don't fit in
I was 10 when it made sense, I am different
I don't believe in religion but i believe in forgiveness
I recognize i was given, a particular vision

And I'm weak, every week, I believe
That I need, G-O-D, to take lead
When my heart, full of things, you don't see
My feet, run to sin, full speed

Gotta think before i speak or take a leap
Though I'm free it doesn't mean I'm free to be
A Deadbeat who creeps in the streets
Every week, chasing things, to feel complete

I lost hope, let myself go, heart went cold
Backslid to another road I even know
That the path i was on got a high death toll
Can't afford to go where the Lord told me don't go

Every time i thought i had it all figured out i had to learn another lesson
Got me thinking of the bad decisions in my past
Now I'm dealing with the consequences
But the same grace that was freely given is the same grace making me forgiven
When i clean the inside of the cup like the outside when I'm washing dishes

Chorus [Nerva]

Sometimes i wish i could rewind
And undo all those bad times
But i can only make the best out of now
When i make it out i know they'll wonder how

Verse 2 [ToneSpain]

Uh, I pray for forgiveness, for all them times of disobeying the vision
All them times that I would play with the witness for fallin' back into the way of the wicked
But wait I repented, (I repented) by the fruit I been displaying the difference
Bible scholar by the way I been diggin' you can hear it in the way I been spittin'

Nerva told me Tone spit a verse how my past ugly it won't get reversed
But the blood of Christ ain't only lift the curse I'ma do the most while I'm in the Earth
Yeah you hear the progression (uhh) I ain't got time for no fear or deception
The word of the Lord it appear as a weapon I'm preaching the truth in the ear of the brethren

Every time I thought I had it all figured out I had to learn a lotta lessons
Got me thinking bout the bad decisions in my past now I'm dealing with the consequences
But the same blood that was freely given is the same blood making me forgiven
I was dead dead I was lost but now by the blood of Christ I done beat the system, Hallelujah!
