[Verse 1]
I walk up on them like "what's happening, bro, let's get it popping"
That turn up shortie and [?]  we way up like rockets
Ain't no low key with that Kobe we came with the rocket
Kamikazes when that drop boy it's 'bout time to clock it
I live by hope dealin' forgiving no chilling
When that heat come bro ripping, dope with, it hope sipping, living water fulfilling
Seen no sinners when I spitting fire flame jocka playing
King of Kings, Lord of Lords
So are more
Can I say ain't no way to the Father than grace
Light us up we bring the fire straight from Zion
Rockers know that rude boy shining reflecting the lion
Real ting, put them in a sin or is it higher
Give 'em everything we fear, it's limiting my fire

[Hook: Beam & Steven Malcolm]
You see the flame come around now
Watch as we light up the globe
We're not gonna fade or be stomped out
From miles away see our soul
Fire, fire, fire, oh
Fire, fire, fire, oh

[Verse 2]
I know that they ain't never heard nothing like this before
Spit that truth, ball on it, blog on it, gotta put sauce on it
Living that rhetoric [?] better be
Ready [?] be killing this
You know I'm back at it been addicted crack addict
All day my day ain't no breaks going to take my rhymes to your glory
Go get it no better cross all on the back go with us
Sick is flow wicked
Hit them with that 1-2
Cause mayhem when I'm on the come up like whoo
Canon busting with that light that bring the fire
This become the way we carry you to the designer
Never backing down, we fly away to the provider
You are already on my team look up to the sky see

[Hook: Beam & Steven Malcolm]
You see the flame come around now
Watch as we light up the globe
We're not gonna fade or be stomped out
From miles away see our soul
Fire, fire, fire, oh
Fire, fire, fire, oh

[Outro]
You see the fire enemy adds when I do this
They can never stop us we the flewest
You say another word imma lose it
Don't you disrespect us, we the truest

Fire, fire, fire, oh
Fire, fire, fire, oh
