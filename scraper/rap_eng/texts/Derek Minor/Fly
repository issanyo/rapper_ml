[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I've soared with the angels
Wish I was flyin' with them right now
Feel like I fell right out of heaven
And gravity wanna bring me down, yea

[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
My failures feel so enormous
But they pale in comparison to You
Lord You, Lord You, Lord
And I can hear you sayin'

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Fly, I know the wind is gettin' crazy now
But don't let turbulence take your desire
You see I'm pointing at you from the ground
Sometimes you need that lift to take you higher
You, you, you were made with dreams
You only see, you've flown away (a-ay-a-ay-a-ay, a-ay-a-ay)

[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
My failures feel so enormous
But fell in comparison to you, Lord
You, Lord you, Lord
And I can hear you say

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to
Fly, fly

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
I thank the Lord that I'm in His good graces
All I know is that I'm free and this feeling's so amazing
Everything I've been through, bringing me close to You
The fact that I'm here is proof
What am I without you, without you, you

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
Another eagle with these wings that are broken
That was made for something greater, and doesn't even notice
Who wasn't on the ground, but should be higher than the wind
Don't be scared of your purpose if you really wanna live
You better fly (fly, fly, fly)

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to
Fly, fly
Fly, fly
