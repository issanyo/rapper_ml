[Verse 1]
Gimme 16, I’ll show you what to do
Try and eat a beat like Dwight Schrute
Go ape if you feelin’ right
Let the beast out the cage, it’s the Life of Pi
Boy, pay attention when you hear me
My lyrics like a petting zoo, I’m hoping that you feel me
I shock ‘em all like Pikachu when I come in the building
I’m the only rapper not spinning hits, that's so cavenzi
Or Chevachi? Sheesh, what’s the big deal?
Some people out here chasing toys, it’s a Kid’s Meal
You go in circles for the power, that’s a windmill
But you can win it all and not know how a win feel
Ughh... don’t listen to me though
I’m partially broke and got a problem with my ego
I’m probably hating on you in front of all of these people
They don’t care what the verse say, the hook is what they fiend for

[Hook]
There’s people out here dancing, they don’t hear me though (deaf)
They just want the beat to tell them where to go (deaf)
So every time I grip the microphone
It don’t matter, I just say what I want

‘Cause they just wanna go deaf, deaf, deaf, deaf
Deaf, deaf, deaf
They just wanna go deaf, deaf, deaf, deaf
Deaf, deaf, deaf
They just wanna go deaf

[Verse 2]
Gawvi put me on to the cali flow
With the goons on the beach with a calico
They see girls that they’re prolly tryna take home
If they the Jordans in the box, it’s a saved soul …
Get it? Probably not
But the beat hot, so let’s rock
Say what I want, or what you say that I won’t
As long as Jesus on the throne, I ain’t worried about a foe
Librarian flow, in other words, keep me low
And Jesus paid my debt, I ain’t worried ‘bout what I owe
I said Jesus twice, that’s for your checklist
“Well that’s three times” … check this
Some people sound deep, try and show them proof
Find out they’re shallow as a kiddie pool
But it don’t matter what I think, I’m just another dude
That made a song for you to go deaf to

[Bridge]
I know what you came here for
I ain’t ‘bout to make you wait no more
The only reason that we at this show
So you can hear your favorite song

And then go...
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

And then go...
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

I know what you came here for
I ain’t ‘bout to make you wait no more
The only reason that you came to the show
So you can hear your favorite song

And then go...
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

And then go...
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

[Hook]
There’s people out here dancing, they don’t hear me though (deaf)
They just want the beat to tell them where to go (deaf)
So every time I grip the microphone
It don’t matter, I just say what I want

‘Cause they just wanna go deaf, deaf, deaf, deaf
Deaf, deaf, deaf
They just wanna go, deaf, deaf, deaf
Deaf, deaf, deaf
They just wanna go def
