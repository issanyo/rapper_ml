[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
I know it's so hard to say goodbye
And wipe away all of those tears that you cry
But when you look and don't know where to be found
No mama, mama don't you cry for me now
No mama, mama don't you cry for me now

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I know (I know)
You saw me at the worst time, you was prayin' all night
And I know (I know)
That even when I wasn't right you were standin' by my side
'Cause you didn't see what everybody else saw
I bet they all wish they all had your vision now
You just saw that little boy that God called
I'm finally tuned in to your mission now
And I can hear you call for me
Every time the Devil set them trials for me
Set them trials for me
And you said I would make it through, oh If I just believe, yeah I just believe

[Pre-Chorus: The Wright Way]
You're so right, you're so right
Because I found a light, I found a light

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
I know it's so hard to say goodbye
And wipe away all of those tears that you cry
But when you look and don't know where to be found
No mama, mama don't you cry for me now
No mama, mama don't you cry for me now

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
'Cause God heard you on those late nights
Told you, "Dry your eyes, you don't have to cry Oh no, you don't have to cry
Before that boy was yours, he was mine
Your son'll be just fine
And ma, you know that God can never lie"
'Cause I know that I can't make it on my own
I trust the Lord through the storm
He stuck his hand out
For dear life I'm holding on To be the best father that I can
Best husband that I can I'm not perfect, but I'm sticking to his plan
So when I lose my life I already lost it for him
I get it back, I'll forever live again I'll forever live again
Forgave me of my sins
Forgave me of my sins
Now I know I'm his

[Pre-Chorus: The Wright Way]
You're so right, you're so right
Because I found a light, I found a light

[Chorus: Aaron Cole]
I know it's so hard to say goodbye
And wipe away all of those tears that you cry
But when you look and don't know where to be found
No mama, mama don't you cry for me now
No mama, mama don't you cry for me now
