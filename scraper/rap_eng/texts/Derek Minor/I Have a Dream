[Verse 1:]
I have a dream that’s similar to Dr. King’s
Let freedom ring in the streets
I have a dream that there was nothing left to protest
Because all of God’s people would treat each other equal
I have a dream that our blood-stained blocks with young men shot are now clean
No more shoulders cried on with mother’s tears
I have a dream that the me too movement was not needed
And all of our women like queens they were treated
I have a dream that our soldiers came home and the war stopped
Prison wasn’t for profit, treating bodies like stocks
I have a dream that from dawn until dusk we all know we’re loved till we turn into dust, oh God (I have a dream)
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream dream dream
I have a dream dream dream
I have a dream

[Verse Two: Derek Minor]
I look around the world and all I see
Is just a broken version of what it's supposed to be
Murder, lie, cheat, steal, kill
For the love of money
And pursuit of power
Kids wounded by adult figures
And they cry at night and that's
Scar tissue
Politicians...
