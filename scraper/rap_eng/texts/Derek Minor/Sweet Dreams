[Hook]
I just want to get these dreams out
So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what I dream bout'
It's that one day you might care

[Verse 1]
15 years old
Sitting in my bedroom
Watching my baby sister
And praying Mom's will be home soon
Burning my arms
The pressure hit me like typhoons
Cuz' I'm the only black kid in my homeroom
I felt the power of words that day
When I was called coon
Sharp as any sword
When they cut, it scar you
You know the pain when people seem to ignore you
I grab the teacher like, "I just want to be heard!"
I went home, and put it all inside a notebook
Poetry is molding me
Look, this how hope look
My father is in Michigan
My step-dad addicted and
My mom's out at working all her fingers to the bone
And I feel like I'm worthless and hurting beneath the surface
It's clear that I am broken Lord
I need you in my home
And that day
A dream was born
That in 16 bars
You can hear my pain in this song

[Hook]
I just want to get these dreams out
So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what I dream bout'
It's that one day you might care

[Verse 2]
I see some doctors and lawyers
With a person to cure cancer
And they don't even know it
It's a voice in they dreams, it drowned out
By the loudmouths
Dreamkillers screaming for God to quiet down
So if they say that you are nothin'
Tell em' thank you
Cuz' God created this whole universe, that is proof
Meaning, we're expressions of the greatest artist
Brushstrokes of The King's speech, greatest masterpiece
So why you let em' take your purpose? (Huh?)
(It's the dream that he gave you)
Why you believin' that you worthless? (Huh?)
(There's a reason why he made you)
Fly higher, inspire
You were wired to be The Lord's greatness
Naysayers are liars
And this what He designed me to do
I'm living my dream
You better live yours too

[Hook]
I just want to get these dreams out
So hopefully I'll stop having these nightmares
And if you wanna know what I dream bout'
It's that one day you might care

[Bridge]
Now, all my dreamers say..
(OoooooooOOoooo)
Don't let em' ever take your dream away
(Ooooohhhh)
Now, all my dreamers say..
(OoooooooOOoooo)
Don't let em' ever take your dream away
(Ooooohhhh)
They can never take your dream away
