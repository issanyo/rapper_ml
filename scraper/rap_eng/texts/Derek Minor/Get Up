Lookin' outta my window, I see a block full of kinfolk
On the porch with a 40, full of that endo
The shawty clutching her son, he got a afro
And daddy nowhere around, where did the man go?
It's stacked up on the block, yeah, Legos
Feel like it's cheap but it's good, yeah, Faygo
It's like I'm dead but I ain't, am I a ghost bro?
Feel like two parts of me damned, am I a schizo?
And part of me happy, the other half is greed
'Cause I'm doing all these shows but I'm still feeling this need
I talk about how much different the world could be
But still I sit on this throne like I'm a king
Still I sit on this throne like I'm a king
Still sit on this throne like I'm a king
Might be a little too comfortable
Man, I better get up!
Cousin front of this flat screen, I see crushed dreams
Channel 2 News, I see a couple me's
I see a couple you's, I see a couple Gs
I see some VLs sent to the F-e-d's
Federal Pen if you didn't know
They would come hard trying not to be broke
That's a reality, so many ghetto casualties
Make me think, "Lord, why'd you send your love after me?"
I can't afford to be stuck up
Just saw a stuck-up couple getting stuck up
See the person who robbed 'em, saw him a-come up
Thought he played that lotto till his luck sucked
And it was, he want whips and chains
The cops came, then we got whipped and chained
My heart broke for the hood, so I just sit and pray
'Cause I know Christ gave his blood and it ain't in vain
I'm happy but I'm grieved
'Cause I'm doing all these shows but I still feel the need
I talk about how much different the world could be
But still I sit on this throne like I'm a king
Still I sit on this throne like I'm a king
Still sit on this throne like I'm a king
Might be a little too comfortable
Man, I better get up!
