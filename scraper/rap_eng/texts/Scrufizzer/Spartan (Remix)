[Intro]
Spartans, what is your profession?

[Verse 1: Kozzie]
Yo, the problem's started
I'm back with a bag of new friends
Six man on a tune, new wave on the area
I'm far gone, can't you see from my lens?
I'm that guy on tunes, I'm that guy on sets
Boom, that goes straight through your room
Can't keep lying like that on a tune
Equals a reload? Yeah, in the booth

[Verse 2: Marger]
It's Marger
But I don't care about size
So many fakes, I can see it in their eyes
Why I don't care about none of these guys
Too many skippy MCs that wanna be badboys
Ain't had a gun in their lives
Boom, you should hold one in your left
So these man know what they're doing ain't right

[Hook: Kozzie]
Nah, can't keep lying like that
Yeah, I'm back with the remix
Rerun the dance, mek a man feel seasick
Can't keep lying like, can't keep lying like
Nah, can't keep lying like that
Yeah, I'm back with the remix
Rerun the dance, mek a man feel seasick
Can't keep lying like, can't keep lying like

[Verse 3: Merky ACE]
Who's ACE? I par with the veterans
What's your profession? You know mine
I do dirt on your section, wipe out your henchmen
Could say that the problem's started
When I run through the front door with the Wesson
Steeze on four and teach man a lesson
Problem done when FT touch down
Uh, always make an impression

[Verse 4: Rival]
Shotty
Lift man up from the room to his garden
Respect my authority like Cartman, yeah, I'm barring
Dun know, Rival the spartan
Headshot season, I be the marksman
I be the guy with the bars that'll blast 'em
Straight war ting, remix his head gone
Duppy, that's the profession

[Hook: Kozzie]
Nah, can't keep lying like that
Yeah, I'm back with the remix
Rerun the dance, mek a man feel seasick
Can't keep lying like, can't keep lying like
Nah, can't keep lying like that
Yeah, I'm back with the remix
Rerun the dance, mek a man feel seasick
Can't keep lying like, can't keep lying like

[Verse 5: Ego]
Alright, then, back for the next one
Dem boy dere wanna jump in the middle and skank
I'll jump in the middle, shank one
So much yak in my system, trust me
I'm so FT to the grave
I don't do good for the straps, it's standard, trust me
Don't wanna violate me or my mandem
I'll come back firing straps when I catch them

[Verse 6: Scrufizzer]
I'll be like Diz, man, everybody scatter
Gunshot buss how we deal with the matter
Can't take me for a prick
Can't take me for a joke, I will send for the dagger
Two shanks up in your face like Jabba
Taking the piss like I've got a weak bladder
Don't come around here talking swagger
Shout to the real thugs dem from the manor

[Hook: Kozzie]
Nah, can't keep lying like that
Yeah, I'm back with the remix
Rerun the dance, mek a man feel seasick
Can't keep lying like, can't keep lying like
Nah, can't keep lying like that
Yeah, I'm back with the remix
Rerun the dance, mek a man feel seasick
Can't keep lying like, can't keep lying like

[Break: Kozzie]
Trust me
Are you mad?
New wave of the grime scene, you see
That's how you do an eight bar riddim

[Outro]
