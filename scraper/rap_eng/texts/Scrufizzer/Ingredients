Collect ingredients preparation is everything
Dutch pot bubbling like chip pans with something in
Chopping blocks, choco block, vegetation I'm cutting it, cutting corners ain't really the chefs orders I'm running with

[Verse 1: Coco]
That's not fire, that looks poor, tryna put the city on the map look north
Man think that I'm just a grime MC, fam what do you think I went and got a macbook for
Why is everybody tryna watch my ting instead of watching what I'm doing getting stacked up bro
Too many things man are celebrating so tonight's the night we getting yakked up (ooo)
You said that you'd go get a white line, tell the yutes fam you should know better
Man want me to promote their music, but I never knew that I was in a Ten letter
Long time when I came in the game and they went around and saw that i was a trend setter
Came back with a sick bender and when I'm setting the levels it don't get no better

Dem man know that I'm eating right, but you know I ain't from South Tilly in a bit
Hot flows yeah I get sick in a bit, busy in a bit, bro get steppy in a bit
Got gyal from London, gyal from Manny, and you know I've got a few heavys in a bit

Touch mic let me start peppering again
Man pay money in a cup all same same, and you've got Morgan, Ed and Ed again

If I go Stu's, and I do a tune it'll be like T pop more treble in again
