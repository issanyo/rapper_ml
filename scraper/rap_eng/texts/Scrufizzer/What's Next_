[Intro: Daniel OG]
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Places+Faces Sounds
Oh wow

[Chorus: Daniel OG]
Pull up and I flex
They be asking me like "what's next?"
Pull up, then I scoop
I don't even need to impress
Started with a text
Now your girlfriend giving me head
She try to come back
And she asking me "what's next?"
What's next?
What's next?
Always got the heat
I ain't talking about the lead
I be long hair
I ain't talking about no dreads
I ain't tell a lie
Facts in every bar that I said

[Verse 1: Benny Mails]
Yo, London, what's next?
I'm the prime sinister with a bounty on my head
Yeah, they found me in the car with my wifey on revenge
Screaming "fuck your referendum, May, I'm coming for your neck"
What's next? And if you ever voted exit
You are a prick, you know I'm coming to your ends
Yeah, I'm on my toe flex with a sniper and a Benz
I can smoke you out, scope you out, guess it all depends, like
Yo, the passion in the blood was so stagnant that it stunk
So when they ran into the vocal booth, they managed to pick up
One bowly and a blunt, too tooly that he tucked
When he jump like the gun and the barrier he run, oh yes
I ain't got a worry in my mind, man's blessed
Why you always acting like there's something on your chest?
Eyes wide, looking like there's something to confess
Man, you pussies is a mess, Daniel, tell 'em (what's next)

[Verse 2: Crave Moore]
Pull up with boo and she want a line
So I've got a Q but I'm not in line
Nuttin' to do with a lot of guys
Why they wanna lie? Get the topic right
Come correct, my penny packets, denim jacket, I get it cracking
Send the track in, holler Cas and let Benny have it
Never back it, gang, I get 'em, I send 'em packing
[?] static, I dragon peck and I tek 'em back
So, speak what I say
Seen church but I preach, bought the speech to the grave
Dream dirty, the beat tried to flee from the wave
But I reap what I save, trick or treat better mate
May I speak to the judge till I'm beating up the case?
Limousine for the fiends when they needed a break
Straight OT, no me
Don't speak so I just call on my Gs and we might just

[Chorus: Daniel OG]
Pull up and I flex
They be asking me like "what's next?"
Pull up, then I scoop
I don't even need to impress
Started with a text
Now your girlfriend giving me head
She try to come back
And she asking me "what's next?"
What's next?
What's next?
Always got the heat
I ain't talking about the lead
I be long hair
I ain't talking about no dreads
I ain't tell a lie
Facts in every bar that I said

[Verse 3: Kasien]
Yo, we been had it
Me and gang step in, they panic, asthma attacking
Flows vanish, Kasien landed with lasers and cannons
Fuck a fashion, dead all your logos, black is the palette
Born with the magic, them man are all gassing
Never resorted to weapons cause my future was destined
Daily deporting these peasants only fill all our presents
Fuck your suggestions, fuck your opinions, we're on a mission
I'm moving like a king and my style is so appealing
I'm swimming in different women cause Kasien got the prescription
Give 'em sexual healing, drilling them holes like a filling
I'm kind of like a villian, shit
Sick, twisted vision, watch me killing shit
I'm back at it like a crack addict, like whoa
Any sound, we're taking it down, let's go
Future legends, London city repping, get to know
So you can row, row your boat if you ain't really tryna blow

[Break]
What's next?
The British are fucking here, what are you fucking talking about?

[Verse 4: Danny Seth]
Feeling like I'm on some effed shit
Feeling I might slit my girlfriend's throat and just have sex with a neck shit
Feeling like I'm not into Brexit, the British come, we don't exit
You need to turn your iCloud on if you don't get the iMessage
Going sick like anorexic, barring like antidepressant
That's Xanax, did you get it? It's a par like when I read it
I focus on the facts, my brudda, this is what I'm living
Man, I took so many bars, my auntie think I gone dyslexic
Danny, don't kill 'em yet, man, your verse has just started
It's hard to be an artist on this track and now that you're laughing
Well, fuck 'em all, they retarded, I'll burn 'em all like a carpet
I've got the game in a headlock so how's the smell of my armpit?
Why the fuck you standing round and wondering who's still the hardest?
I'm picking rappers up like you're the string and I'm guitar picks
I take a picture 'fore I'm dipping with your baby marges
I'm the flyest skinny white boy, rich and higher than the stars, bitch
Woo

[Chorus: Daniel OG]
Pull up and I flex
They be asking me like "what's next?"
Pull up, then I scoop
I don't even need to impress
Started with a text
Now your girlfriend giving me head
She try to come back
And she asking me "what's next?"
What's next?
What's next?
Always got the heat
I ain't talking about the lead
I be long hair
I ain't talking about no dreads

[Verse 5: Scrufizzer]
So me seh what's next? Pussyhole nuh know me
Tell them ah real shotta grow we
What's next? Change up the flow
Cuh they know how we go in
Got the big ting, you might die from it, gang pop and I'll wrap something
Got the trap jumping, no hydraulics, telling you niggas, I'm too psychotic
You try rush me, you ain't sick, pagans talking like I've got nicked
Now I've gotta come with the big ting behind the wheel
Start lyrically kill a man without a deal like rrr
So what's next? Treading on thin ice
Hot step, lemon in my ride
Got my weapon on my side, tryna dodge stopchecks
Got these cats on my line ringing for the hot ting like
Fuel emissions from the piff and
You're just organisms in my visions
Got the tapestry and the vision
I ain't inna all the -isms and the -schisms

[Outro: Daniel OG]
What's next?
What's next?
What's next?
What's next?
