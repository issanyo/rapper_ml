[Intro]
You see if I was a violent MC yeah
This is how I'd spray

[Hook]
Look I be like, what's really good
Say you're a gangsta, what's really good
Say you're a thug then, what's really good
Dem man are talkin', what's really good
L-l l-l l-l-l-l, what's really good
Say you're a gangsta, what's really good
Say you're a thug then, what's really good
Come show man blud, what's really good

[Verse 1]
Alright
Manna in the game tryna get a likkle eye-pop
I'm on the road tryna get a little grind up
Got beef with waste man on my biz
And it ain't nothin cuz I know where ya live
So when I drive up with a few mashed man to your bits
I'll kick in your door like [?] and lighter
Man g'wan get [?] for the road
Til' I reach for the butterfly knife in the coat it's slow
I ain't gonna talk in [?] ask [?] I'll handle my biz
Fam with a stick shank with a [?]
If anyting at anyting, I make one phone call to the cab come back the ends pull out my ting clap back make everybody jump back when I come through
Roll to your ends smiling with a hunch back
Hype ting done that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, what's new and I set man
Heard that I could pull my [?] dead man
Come to the ends [?] I make my tech bang
[?] see I'm ludicrous without Def Jam
What, dem man wanna talk old school
If you want beef I'm local
Just make the phone call
We can get dark and gritty my dargs are one call away like Tulisa
Is it that is it that, I'm always ready
I'm a champ and you can never take my cup
Man wanna hype up I'll stick your guys up
Part time bad boy don't hang the mic up
(Woop Woop Woop Woop Woop)
I'll spray that, take that
You can hold shots in your eight back six pack
Yo dawg, I'll split ya wig back
Don't come around here runnin' that shit jack

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
True, [?] all true
West thirteen is a [?] that true
Man get punched up around here true
Bare MCs talk but they ain't true
Jeans that I wear I choose
The talk is true
Everything I say is true
Them man are lies, they don't tell truth
So Scrufizzer got the rhythm that's truth
Some I'm gonna do, one lines
I can come at the rhythm I flow fast but 'nuff of them wanna hear, one lines
So I'm gonna spray them, one lines
Bare man talk with one lines
I can spit with one lines
I got flows with one lines
F double I that's one line

[Hook]
