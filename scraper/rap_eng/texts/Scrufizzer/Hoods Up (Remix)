[Chorus]
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your, put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up

[Verse 1: Lil Nasty]
What you know about all-black hoodies?
Cash like bookies, and I'm on dough like jookie
Dem man are pussies, I call 'em noonies
And I've got a buzz like Woody
Toys getting drawn like pullies
No stories, wanna war me?
I've got crazy cousins like Cory
See, it's all fuckery like Saw 3
Big butcher, no raw meat
Flow's new like Orleans
And I know you're all neeks
April couldn't fool me
I keep tools when I walk street
Nasty but we all roll deep
Shank man when I'm 'ere like Roachee
I murk beats, ask Ted
You've got Double S coming up next

[Verse 2: Double S]
Oi Nast, let me get it, let me kill 'em in a second
The name's Double, I'm a legend and it's North I be repping
Anytime I'm in the session and my flow be the weapon
Man get threatened whenever I start skipping
If you don't think that I'm nuts with the words
Put a condom up in your ear, fuck what you heard
I'm a music brudda, left the roads and my niggas but
I'm still preferred on the curb
Double, I'm a next ting, I get cheques in while you're resting
I stepped in, now I'm sexing all the best tings
Investing in the best tings, I be flexing
Life's getting interesting
It's cause I've got the best flow and I get dough from the get-go
I'm effed though, everything's yes, I don't tek no
I'm less though, old school, ever so retro
Free T, free Miller, free S-O

[Chorus]
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your, put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up

[Verse 3: Lady Leshurr]

[Verse 4: Scrufizzer]
I was in the trap, couple of gorillas
Bags on my neck, doubling my figures
Hearing everybody saying that they wanna run up on me
Better put your gun up on me if you think you're troubling me
'Nuff of them are thinking that they wanna get touched
You're wrong, Day's got the ting in his clutch
That's all hands-on, gyal dem are seeing my body
Telling me on Twitter that they want all hands on
Go on, sign on, couldn't stop me burying
[?] he shall think
He's on a badman ting, give me the ting
And let me win, show him Shaolin
To be honest, I ain't really on a freestyle ting
Write my own bars, don't need helping
To the brudda chatting rubbish, you ain't greaze, nah, king
If I'm on the mic, it's a speed dial ting

[Chorus]
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your, put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up

[Verse 5: Dot Rotten]
Not a bowcatt but give a pussyhole lick down
Like a Western movie, I spit rounds
Get your popcorn, sit down
When the bar gets shattered just like crystal
Nowadays, you'll see me with a big smile
Chipped tooth but it weren't kicked out
Had enough of a confidence statement
Show up and blow up your yard like a patron
Grab the bitch and Ventura Ace it
Murder the beat, cases
I'm fucking raw like a rapist
Dead oral while I'm drawing a haze spliff
They're like "how can he say this?"
These righteous opinions are now on the playlist
But you know I'm destined for the top and
Anybody wanna get in my way, then they're getting shot inna their face quick

[Verse 6: Tre Mission]
You can ask Wiley, the weed in my hood's so strong
Niggas know it's peak when the hood goes on
Don't come through with a chain and a bezzy
We'll take that from you and put those on
Trust me, that's how the hood goes on
Yeah, you know I come from the Milly
And I'm bigging up Spitz 'cause he comes from the [?]
You an Ajax kid, you don't come from the city
Where the gunshot sounds don't come from the Mini
Stop this
You see this nigga that I'm with? He does not spit
And see the girl that I'm with? She does not spit
A bad bitch, rolls out like Cee Lo
And won't dance to a record if it's not sick
High grade for the brain 'cause the block's sick
And I don't wanna hear nothing if it's not this, park up, pussy

[Chorus]
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your, put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
