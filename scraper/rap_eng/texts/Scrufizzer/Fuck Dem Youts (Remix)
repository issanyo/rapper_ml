[Pre-Hook: Joe Grind]
So please don't compare man
Cause they aren't me
I wouldn't even spit on them
Man's classy
You won't see man around them
Cause they jar me
Man are like "llow them"
I'm like nah, B
Fuck dem youts

[Verse 1: Joe Grind]
Got this little dickhead telling breddas that he's on me
He's a dead man walking like a zombie
He must have heard that a man's not heartless anymore
He must have me confused with Fonti (jheeze!)
It's not a stab though
Cuh man are badman, we no talk beef
Now, can I get back to this hard beat?
If you want, I could rhyme to a heartbeat
Just ask me
Do you whip as much as your car keys?
Played so loud, it seems like you can't speak
It will separate your back from your car seat
I go one extra like Charlie
And I will separate your arse from the bar seat
Ain't none of these clowns flowing like me
Ain't no one like me in your marquee

[Hook: Joe Grind]
Fuck dem youts, any dickhead that
Told other dickheads that we got a problem
Fuck dem youts, any prick that
Try stunt on man and made man rob them
Fuck dem youts, you got a problem
What man's saying and you wanna cause problems?
Fuck dem youts, come see a badman
Sounds like you wanna see God, then

[Verse 2: Scrufizzer]
Man are chatting like I ain't got dough
Slap it on a pagan, make the other side know
Cuh them bruddas be catting my flow
Chatting like you really got money to give smoke
Niggas on the manor still know you're a fraud
So we don't believe your hype (that's right)
You wanna be up on this badman ting?
What stays in the dark's gonna come out in the light
You can buy friends, you can buy dargs
I'm telling you something money can't buy, a heart
I don't wanna buy a chain, I don't wanna buy a car
Bun that, I'm putting all my money on a yard
Cuh the road ting's fake, you see us all mad
Cuh everybody raps like everybody's bad
And every little nigga's tryna do it for the gang
Till you run up on a nigga with the bubuwoowoowoowoo

[Verse 3: Meridian Dan]
Oi matey
I'm tellin' you, man are too snaky
Had a little think and now I'm like "Nah, B"
That's why I've been on my own shit lately
Send for the army, and the navy
Everyone knows my hand is weighty
I ain't really worried 'bout nothin', it's gravy
Think that I'm paranoid, cuz, am I crazy?
I don't wanna see man, oh well, maybe
You can bring a bowl round with fruit
Run your mouth like a 125
Till an R6 man comes round with the suit
Hurts my head when man talk wicked
You ain't gonna squeeze anything but juice
I'm a London boy, proud of my roots
Ain't killed like me, these youts
