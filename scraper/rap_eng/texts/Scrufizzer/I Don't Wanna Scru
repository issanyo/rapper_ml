Fizzler

[Chorus]
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
Educate your whole crew when I come through
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new

[Verse 1]
Woo, you don't wanna get spun on the riddim
When I'm spitting, it's not a mission, I'm really feeling you niggas
Wanna be in my, making a killing, stepping up on a level
You can't battle, I'll battle your clart
Woop woop woop woo woo woo woo
You can't chat to a brudda whenever I make the team right
What you feel like? Wan' me fi rise up the something
Pon your idiot styley to wickedest?
Mind where you step, I'm getting better by the day
Setting off the pace, wonder how we did it with the eight
Been running up on niggas since '08, for fuck's sake
In the manor sticking up bruddas with duct tape
I'm on a new path, new start
I be busting rhymes on the riddim something like woo-hah
Who's the best in the manor? You aren't
I'm disturbing the piece like Yoda
I was on the same wavelength, but I flew past
Lines of rhymes strike your mind when I write
I divide your guys, bite my lines, you will die
When I ride the mic, I collide with the time
Never out of sight, out of mind, are you hype?
Run round, Fizzy will come-come
Buju Banton ting, ra-pa-pa-pum-pum
I hate guilt, niggas wanna bring it to my guys, are you dumb?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
Educate your whole crew when I come through
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new

[Verse 2]
Anyhow, anyway, anywho
None of you couldn't stop me burying
I'm hot, I'm killing it, so what? You idiots better fall back
Fizzy is ready, you better fall back
I'm blowing up like TNT
Me on beats, staying on T-O-P
My sis told me don't watch anybody
Cuh they ain't got nuttin' on you; B.o.B
Fake punchlines, fake metaphors
Levelling it all, they've been seen before, dead in every form
Lyrically, I'm a veteran for yo, telling you it's wrong
I am hotter than a kettle when it's on
Who's real? Blud, everybody is
The fact is that everybody slips
So don't tell me about life, my darg
'Cause you've never seen a big ting light, my darg
Hmm, anyway
Any guy thinking they're ready, I bury guys
When I'm coming, I'm bunning something, I ain't starting for nothing
You might get touched from something if my don's buzzing
Ain't mucking or messing around
You can get a lesson from the Wesson if I test it out
Have a nigga stressing out, lyrically letting out flames
Fuck them man, I am on a next wave

[Chorus]
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
Educate your whole crew when I come through
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new

[Verse 3]
You could try test, use your bicep
Done a hype ting, nigga, better digest
I can direct you to my nest
You can lie with the grass and the violets
I don't know why they're on a hype when
Their body can't take flight like a pilot
You could talk hard, even caught up
Nigga's down for the beef, well, I'm ready for whatever
It's 2012
You can't step inna my boat, no-no, no
You roll when I'm going in the zone, it's cold
So don't ever think you're ready for the dome-filler
I'm a go-getter, flow killer, there is no better
Don't let me release the beast, eat your beat
When I speak, I delete your peeps easily
I'm a beast, I won't pet whenever I'm reigning
'Cause I spit frozen flows
And I've got bars that I show on road
Anybody test, get showed on road
Roll deep with a black chrome in [?]
Yeah, yeah, frozen flows
West 13, that's broken homes
In the manor where we shot broken phones
Violate me? Then we open domes

[Chorus]
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
Educate your whole crew when I come through
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna screw but nuttin' ain't new
