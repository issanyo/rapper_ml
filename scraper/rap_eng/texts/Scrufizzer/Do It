[Intro]
I come through, flash, lights, cameras
You're not a star yet, who you tryna par, then?

[Verse 1]
Drop the beat, let me catch it, goalie
Air Force Ones, black top, Stoney
I take out top MCs in a crew
If you're a top MC, fam, show me
Left man's face all gone, holey
Lips all swolen, you know, Joely
Man try holla at me on the Facebook
Chatting bare mess, I'm cool, cosy
.38 snub that's there, nosy
When I showed up to the set with the mandem
Trust me when I say face rosy
Few more shots in the bag, oz
Time is money, watch, Roley
Jumped in the game on my own, lonely
Now I've got black, white, Asian, Chinese
All type of girl dem trying to phone me

[Chorus]
I'm real to the sound, feet to the ground
Make a badboy tune for the badboy crowd
Do it, grime, all year round
Do it, grime, all year round
I'm real to the sound, feet to the ground
Make a badboy tune for the badboy crowd
Do it, grime, all year round
Do it, grime, all year round

[Verse 2]
Oh shit, I done it again
Got the wickedest tune with the wickedest pen
I spit so many rounds with the lyrical skeng
I make man look stupid, Billy and Ben
I'm the masterclass, ten out of ten
Please don't put me down as the new wave
No, I don't wanna say it again
I said no, I don't wanna say it again

[Chorus]
I'm real to the sound, feet to the ground
Make a badboy tune for the badboy crowd
Do it, grime, all year round
Do it, grime, all year round
I'm real to the sound, feet to the ground
Make a badboy tune for the badboy crowd
Do it, grime, all year round
Do it, grime, all year round

[Verse 3]
I get money, brown, Carter
Music money, I'm cool, Sparta
Roll to the dance with about six man
Get fourteen wheel-ups, yeah, darker
I flow tight on the beat, sharper
Won't hear me with the same old bars
For about ten years cause I ain't no Marger
LOL, I sure ain't marga

[Chorus]
I'm real to the sound, feet to the ground
Make a badboy tune for the badboy crowd
Do it, grime, all year round
Do it, grime, all year round
I'm real to the sound, feet to the ground
Make a badboy tune for the badboy crowd
Do it, grime, all year round
Do it, grime, all year round

[Chorus]
I'm real to the sound, feet to the ground
Make a badboy tune for the badboy crowd
Do it, grime, all year round
Do it, grime, all year round
I'm real to the sound, feet to the ground
Make a badboy tune for the badboy crowd
Do it, grime, all year round
Do it, grime, all year round
