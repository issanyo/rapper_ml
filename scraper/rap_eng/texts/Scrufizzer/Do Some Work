Yeah it's Fizzy right now, hang tight DJ Cable, big up my Ealing man, hang tight my Acton Lane niggas, hang tight the Gordon Road mandem it's West 13, scru-doh-doh

Said he was a badman, said he was a shotta
But I didn't see no packs
Said he was a gunman, said he was a robber
But I didn't see no straps

Get a man down with a broom
Dem man are cokeheads lighting a spoon
Came in the ends, opened a bore
Pull out da ting like "nobody move!"

I like a mash man, so many do
Until ya get slapped up over a cube
Who's got lyrics, who's got flows
Spat them bars that nobody knew

Pull up ya pants, do some work
When ya go home, send Logan a tune
Said he was a badman, said he was a boss
I was like "Rudeboy, show me the proof!"

Cos I be like yo, do some work
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
You're not a badman you're some nerd
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
You're not a badman you're just a nerd

You don't want a slap in the face
Slap in the face
Rudeboy you don't want a slap in ya face
Don't try come on the riddim & get gully
Co' you'll get a slap in ya face, like
You don't want a slap in the face
Slap in the face
Rudeboy you don't want a slap in ya face
Don't try come on the riddim & get gully
Co' you'll get a slap in ya face, like - di-di-di

When I come true, know it's a west ting
Six foot tall, never been Redskin
I be in a bando blazing a lem-ting
Take two draws then pass to my bredren
I am the truth, start confessing
I don't want a wifey, forget the stress
Spending money but do you invest

See me have girl from Manny & Beckton
West 13 is where I get paid
Man can't come around Acton Lane
Might get robbed for your chaps & chain
Open ya head like door on train
Hear my hunger, feel my pain
Do it for my niggas that are locked in a cage
If ya wanna fight, just see, get a roundhouse kick to ya rasclart face

Cos I be like yo, do some work
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
You're not a badman you're some nerd
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
You're not a badman you're just a nerd

You don't want a slap in the face
Slap in the face
Rudeboy you don't want a slap in ya face
Don't try come on the riddim & get gully
Co' you'll get a slap in ya face, like
You don't want a slap in the face
Slap in the face
Rudeboy you don't want a slap in ya face
Don't try come on the riddim & get gully
Co' you'll get a slap in ya face, like - di-di-di

Style and flow me a bill-le-le-leng
It's Scru-fizz on the ridd-de-de-dem
Dem boy dere wanna copy my flow, but new flows I'm bill-le-le-leng
I come from West e-le-le-leng
Y.G's making a kill-le-le-leng
I don't wanna here no talk about "UH"
If I run up on a nigga, I'll be drill-le-le-leng-leng

Ready for any, they can't see me
I'm really going in silly, with lyrics I'm like diddy
Runnin' the city, the empire's my P-Diddy
Guys wanna send, co' they love my flow
Bravehearts wanna come I know
Dat's cool, cos I'll take out both with one eye closed
Dem boys can't stop my show, I'm on to (???)

Cos I be like yo, do some work
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
You're not a badman you're some nerd
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
I be like yo do some work
You're not a badman you're just a nerd

You don't want a slap in the face
