[Pre-verse]
Uh, yeah, yeah
Woop, woop

[Verse 1]
I'm saying think before you speak
Symbolizing elements of [uhh] preach
I'm always open to opinions
Over-spoken, overloading more as I'm thinking
Insane
This feeling's kinda weird
'Cause two years back I wouldn't guess that Fizzy ever would be here
As I overcome my fear
It's like the holy ghost is near
Yeah I, do shed a tear
But up close what I lost last year [?]
Yeah, I'm really beginning to see all these people
Who didn't believe in my dream and I'm finding it
Funny but I never laugh
All of you people are left in the past
But keep your circle close
And hold your chops within your dawgs [?]
'Cause all these snaky serpents wanna see you fall
Let me hit 'em off
Skipper with the flow
Hittin' like a bow
Every time I'm doin' this
They wanna come up with a remedy
And then the melody
You niggas better be ready
For the motherfucking Fizzer flow
[?]
Well, why?
She's crazy, blowin' up worldwide don't mistake me
What you talk' 'bout I am wavy
With my middle finger up like Slim Shady
Tryna take away like say my name is Sadie
[?]
I'd rather be on my Jones like Indiana
Ridin' Dirty like Christina Aguilera
Can you hear us?
Back in here we're taking over
Man do fear us
Hence why they stand and stare [Boom]
You can ask about me yeah I'm on my fucking job
Up on my mula
How do you do? I'm proud to meet ya pal
My name is Scruface
Thi-thi-thi-this is me... me... me
[Repeat]

[Chorus]
Insane
Insane
Insane
(I.. get, get, fizzy, fizzy, fiz, fiz)

[Verse 2]
I'm saying think before you chat
When you're symbolizing elements of rap
So think who's your party
More controversial than Illuminati
Words can't describe
All these feelings I hold inside
As I'm scheming I cross my drive
With this dream I'm bringing to life
This is my destiny
Definitely what it's meant to be
Searching for my identity
Travellin' to this melody
[Alright, uh]
Yeah I'm back on my shit
All I needed was some time
So I could stack all my chips
F your gang and your clique
You ain't matching with this
[F-f-f-fi-flow]
Back on this 'ish

Chorus]
I-I-I, Insane
I-I-I, Insane
I-I-I, Insane
(I.. get, get, fizzy, fizzy, fiz, fiz)
