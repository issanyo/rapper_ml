[Verse 1]
Today I feel I'm gonna break
Tomorrow I hope that I wake
I tell a brother why I do these things
To soothe my pain like Nurofen
Gotta say what I feel
Didn't wanna end up in the hills
Thinking I was that ready, I was on a track, kept me
Going on a mission and I lost my Blackberry
That's memories gone that I will never get again
And they're setting me off and really I couldn't pretend
How I was feeling away
Upset like I really wanna give it a break
Now I'm wishing that I made things clear
And I ain't gonna fill cause you didn't wanna hear
Now I'm sitting at my bedroom, wondering
Why my vision never came through clear
I said I fell too far, now I'm hitting the floor
Thundering, bust up, let me give you some more
Made a mistake, I was spilling my thoughts
Fool me twice but it's silly because
One lie leads to another
Another lie leads to a mess
Another mess leads to a stress
Tryna be pure for you
Just to accept me
But it's just
Another problem

[Hook]

I hope we see this through, yeah
I hope we see this through, babe
I hope we see this

[Verse 2]

My soul is dead and gone
Feeling I no longer have...
