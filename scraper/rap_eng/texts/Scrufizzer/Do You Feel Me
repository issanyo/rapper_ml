Psh, dum diddy dum
Yeah, blum blum
Blum diddy blum
Telling your [?]
We're coming and repping it from the slums
You better step up, go get your rep up
Even call your friend up
This flow I'm banging
Is fucking fatal just like a headshot
Breddas tried to set up me out of pressure
Writing out your bruddas ain't the way to get your bread up
Fucking snitch
Now he's in the cell doing press-ups
Got me feeling like cash cause I wanna lash your neck off
I'm better than ever to come, bring it
I'm so ahead of you dons
Your brudda done did it
He took my flow and tried run with it
But it's cool, I ain't stressed on the fact
I'm more than getting the stacks
Karma is getting you back
There's no snakes in my circle, you made it buckle
I'm blowing purple, I'm on the verge to
Taking this game
Wrecking this, leaving haters pissed
Better be rating this
None of them rappers spitting
Are on the same wave as this
Doing what you hate me for
Breaking doors
Nocturnal life
The only difference is that I am raving more
Olders are getting out the Kid Cudi, losing power
He's 20 [?]
Don't bother matching me, I'm actually
Down to the earth like gravity
Rapids [?] how do you manage these
Middle fingers in the air, you can stay scheming
I'm living this life, I ain't daydreaming

Pum pum, pum to the oh
This is the sound of the woo, fizzy flow
Pum pum, pum to the oh
This is the sound of the woo, fizzy flow
Diddy dum, di diddy dum dum
Di, diddy dum, di diddy diddy dum
Dum diddy dum, di diddy dum dum
Rippy pum pum, rippy pum pum

Psh, woo
Yeah, yeah
