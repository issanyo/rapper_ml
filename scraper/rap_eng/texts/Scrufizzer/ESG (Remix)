[Hook: Tinchy Stryder]
I'm a, I'm-I'm a, I'm an east side geezer
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm an east side geezer
I'm a, I'm-I'm a, I'm an east side geezer

Said me wanna take it all, said me belly feel hungry
The only ting a gwan is to hustle me a duppy
And that's the principal, me a never deal with fuckery
The only thing me want is me bloodclart money

[Verse 1: Meridian Dan]
Uh, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a north side geezer
I don't smoke the reefer, went Ibiza, got no cash, just splash with the Visa
See man driving a German whip, see man driving a new shape Beamer
I don't wanna buy no food in the sealer, who told you that I am a dealer?
Cause I ain't slept in days, I work all week for a wage
I went from street to the stage, North London is streets of rage
Grew in T with man like Wretch, man like President T and Skeps
I know all of the London sets, man know I'm a North London rep

[Verse 2: Big Narstie]
Andale andale! Arriba! Not chatting but you wanna follow leader
Nine milli gully creeper, I'mma squeeze her
Man ain't gonna get no breather
My gas pipe's off the meter
(GASSED!) BASE PEN (JESUS!)
Trust me, nothing like shisha
Kick man's face like FIFA
I am my brother's keeper
BANG MAN IN DA FACE! South London geezer
KICK MAN IN DA FACE! Baterscooter
KICK MAN IN DA FACE! I SAID BATERSCOOTER!

Said me wanna take it all, said me belly feel hungry
The only ting a gwan is to hustle me a duppy

[Hook: Tinchy Stryder]
I'm a, I'm-I'm a, I'm an east side geezer

[Break: Tinchy Stryder]
I'm on my grind, cash from the till, cash, cash from the till
Cash from the till, cash, cash from the till
Cash from the till, cash, cash from the till
Cash from the till, no debit card Visa

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
I'm a west side geezer, grew up in the Gaza
As a ghetto yout, them teach me alpha on my corner
West 13, them can't disrespect the yarder
You don't need that trouble or that drama
So don't miss the programme, if man stand up in a war I will ghost em
Chatting like they're ready for the Fizzer, I'mma Flowdan
When I'm on the riddim I kill it cause I'mma Flowdan
Coming with the bars that I'm giving, better know that
It's Fizzy G, keeping that consistency
I really wanna holla Tiffany but it looks like she ain't feeling me

Said me wanna take it all, said me belly feel hungry
The only ting a gwan is to hustle me a duppy
And that's the principal, me a never deal with fuckery
The only thing me want is me bloodclart money

[Verse 4: Tinchy Stryder]
And just in case you didn't know
Oh yeah, it's T Strydes
ESG, that's me, right
Yeah, we're known for the pie and mash
I prefer my chicken deep fried
Some fail to try, some are getting by
Some are living life, some are doing time
Some ladies respect themself
Some of them are craving the D inside
Welcome to the London life
Where some of them are living that lavish life
Work more than 9 to 5
So I'm cycling round on a Boris bike
Oh no no, that's not me
Fast cars, lightspeed
On my Jack Jones, Cockney rhyming slang geez
I'm so Bow

[Hook 2: Meridian Dan, Scrufizzer & Big Narstie x2]
I'm a, I'm-I'm a, I'm a north side geezer
I'm a, I'm a, I'ma, I'm a west side geezer
I'm a, I'm-I'm a, I'm a south side geezer
BDL geezer, Base Defence leader

[Outro: Big Narstie & Tinchy Stryder]
Base Defence League, Base De-Bass Defence League
Base Defence League, Base De-Bass Defence League
I'm a, I'm-I'm a, I'm an east side geezer
