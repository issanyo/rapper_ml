Yeah, look
Every time I come for the drum yeah I kill off the songs
I be the 1 from the slums are you feeling me don?
I'm ready for anyone wanna bring it then come
We getting crunk wi' da' piff yeah I fill up my lungs
Bringin' the funk in the dance are you feelin' me don?
We're getting numb having fun to the riddim' we're on

Woop woop woop woop woop woop are you feelin' me don?

Woop woop woop woop woop woop are you feelin' me don?

Spittin' on the riddim' I'm bringin' the outcome
They wanna copycat really how come?
Listen to my tune listen to my album
Recognise where dem' brehs took their style from

Your feel say your better but you're on a bait one
Der ain't one beat that you didn't shout on
My flows sick but I never need a calpon
Friends wanna holler but I never shout em'
But (but, but, but)

This one's raw
Yeah I'm on track
Bassline stuff
Man a just skank
Gotta make dough, gotta make cash
This one here will make your head bang
Brand new day gotta make sure
I don't waste time cause I'm on course
I don't waste time cause I'm on course
Look I don't waste time (time, time, time…)

In 07 I was rippin' up sets
If you clashed me then you'd be hittin' the deck
To be honest life's really getting tricky again
Old friends wanna holler and kick it again

Kick it again
Kick it again
Kick it again
Kick it again

Old friends wanna holler and kick it again I'm like…

Kick it again

Old friends wanna holler and kick it again I'm like…

No Eminem but please stand up
Fake friends could never be round us
Everybody's tryna' holler and be round cos
They know we go hard like Rihanna

I'm a rude boy lookin' for a re-anna
Come holler at a bruda' if you doin' it proper
I'm getting money widda' woop woop in the trap
1-3 yeah I came through wid' da' fam'
Cos I entered da door with a' new key
Got the game shook like who's he
Killin' em' softly ‘fugees
I'm on the ball Wayne Rooney
Fizzy with the flow you know I stay unique
(I stay unique, I stay unique)
I don't watch anybody u stream
Who's on the wave? Scru' be

In 07 I was rippin' up sets
If you clashed me then you'd be hittin' the deck
To be honest life's really getting tricky again
Old friends wanna holler and kick it again
