[Chorus]
From So Solid Crew to BBK
We've been doing this from TDK
From [?] to CDJs
Man grabbed the mic, then we did it our way
From So Solid Crew to BBK
We've been doing this from TDK
From [?] to CDJs
Man grabbed the mic, then we did it our way

[Verse 1: Flirta D]
[signature gibberish]

[Verse 2: Little Dee]
(Ahh yeah) Hang about, hang about
That girl there looks buff, hang about
She said she wants to roll all night
But I ain't got time to hang about
OGz in the building, hang about
Gyal dem's getting reeled in, hang about
Man in the corner acting rough?
But they can't act when we hang about

[Verse 3: PK]
(Ahh) Bike roll up
Switch on man like "hold up"
When I catch man, it's over
Catch man on the roadside with the poker
Leave man's body in a stretcher, roll up
Switch on man like "hold up", when I catch man, it's over
Catch man on the roadside with the poker
Leave man's body in the water

[Verse 4: Novelist]
Mmm, yeah
I like girls with back off
Alie
If I bring her to the yard, then I ain't gonna jack off
Jack off, man have got game
They get gassed when they hear my name
And man ah move like Kanye
When I bang your girl all day, all day

[Verse 5: Jammz]
Don't do it to yourself
Why you tryna act bad? Don't do it to yourself
Man are lying online, don't do it to yourself
Just take my advice, don't do it to yourself
All of this talk just shows man
That you don't know who you are, don't do it to yourself
Now it's all just a par, don't do it to yourself
It's better that you don't start, don't do it to yourself

[Verse 6: Yizzy]
Shut your mout, you chief
You don't want it with the commander-in-chief
You're not a badboy, blud, you're a chief
Get-get your wig split something like chief
Your mandem are chief, gyal dem are chief
Auntie are chief, uncle are chief
Anybody that want it can get bodied on a beat
What? What? What you know about that one, chief?

Hello, darling, give me your number
Hello, treacle, give me your number

[Verse 9: Bossman Birdie]
Boss, way back, way back
Weigh marks where I weighed that
Yeah, 28 came back
Hit them blocks, gotta make that
I pray that, I pray that
I don't lack out here cuh it ain't that
Hear my voice on the tape packs
Original, I ain't gotta say that

[Verse 10: Asher D]
OK, when I'm in that man's manor
Black hoodie, black gloves, black bandana
Never adopt that man's grammar
Ready to click-clack, no Hannah
Shooting everybody, cameraman
Blow the whole ting up, Taliban
I'm here, get it through your head
I only [?]

[Verse 11: Kwam]
Yeah, yeah, it's all sweet
Walking around like I own these streets
Earphones in so I step to the beat
Fake schemes? I'm not a man to be chiefed
Won't shout names out, but I look neat
Don't chat to me, don, you ain't brushed your teeth
Going on gutter like autumn leaves
Don't try tell me you're awesome, please
