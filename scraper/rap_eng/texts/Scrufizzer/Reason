[Verse 1: Scrufizzer]
I know you hate me cause of what happened, now it's all changed
And I ain't saying you should like me cause I won't change
No one in this world is perfect and you knew it
Me and you had something special until you told me I blew it
I ain't stressing over nothing and it's getting on your nerves
Cause I ain't like them others, baby, fuck what you heard
You're calling me and arguing, is this what I deserve?
Now you're telling me you hate me, be careful with your words
Cause hate is a strong word - think, why do you hate me?
All I'm doing is doing my ting, I ain't got no time, to be honest I don't really wanna be up on a hype
That's long, come better than that, you ain't on what I'm on
I've been telling the truth from day one
Stop calling me a liar, that's wrong
Tell me where you got that from, don't kill the vibe that I'm on

[Hook]
Stop, wait, think
Cuh you going off the rail and you're stressing over girls, brother
Stop, wait, think
Cuh you think he's your friend but he snakes you in the end, stop

[Verse 2]
Get up, get out and get by
How can you make it if you haven't even tried? (WOO!)
I know you hate me cause you hear me on the radio
And you hate me cause you see me in them videos
And you hate me cause you think I write bars
And I aim them at your clart, pussy, I can done your dance
They keep sending threats, they're empty
Why the fuck should I care about some MCs?
These man are some idiots that MC
When they see me in the manor are running to bread me
Ono be up on a edyat thing, mi nah go lie
Come like ono wan see me kick off a fight
I ain't tryna be drawn out
Got new shows, gonna tour out
Anyway, man better know that I ain't against you
Nuff things man a go tho
And I ain't tryna knock your hustle
Still upon a grind, I'm like you
Tryna make this money double
Meeting accountants, making investments
Investments - look
Came a long way from the uni lectures

[Hook]

[Outro]
Get up, get out and get bad
How can you make it if you haven't even tried? (WOO!)
Get up, get out and get bad
Don't waste all your days getting high
You've gotta get up, get out and get bad
How can you make it if you haven't even tried? (WOO!)
