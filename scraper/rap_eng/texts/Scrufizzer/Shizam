[?] something ah plan, it's hitting 'em real
Getting big all of a sudden, dem man couldn't ignore
Everybody's talking rubbish, I back it with my talk
Cause I'm iller than you bruddas, I could put it on my mama's
To music, I am glued
Don't think you're a star like Taio Cruz
MCs get crushed like Irn Bru cans
I send 'em to the gravel pit like I'm Wu Tang

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
I ain't planning to stop
Hotter than the bullets that you bang in your Glock
A lot of them are chatting a lot
I don't wanna come around and bad up your block
I ain't got nuttin' to prove
To be honest, you ain't got nuttin' to lose
139, baby, loving the crew
Everybody gets gassed when we come in the room

[Verse 4: Stylo G]

[Verse 5: Scrufizzer]
Yeah, I've got it on lock, never bringing it pop, you didn't clock
I'm a boss, all you niggas are washed, you couldn't block
Better stop, don't run up your gob, you'll get a box
I'm a don, you ain't ready for us, you man are lost
I'm bringing the energy, killing the medi, the flow and heavy
None of you rappers are wicked and badder, and bigger man are
Clapping where they can [?] rapper
Me and Stylo G are really making it happen
