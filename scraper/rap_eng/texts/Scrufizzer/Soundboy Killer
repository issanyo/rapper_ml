[Shotty Verse 1]
Treat the beat like Bebo
We go up for the reload
These know we smoke up on a Kilo
We smoke till my lungs look like an emo
Please don't stand on my chucks I've cleaned those
Mero, they look for me like Nemo
I have to accept man's ego
I'm the one Don these know
I spit that pure perico
M M M Mero
Fresh kicks and clean clothes
I'm in Versacci like mego's
We roll deep like Wiley and Rico
Got my squad with me I feel like Neeno - Brown?
They know how we get down
Got the whole place ablaze with my sound
Man said he didn't even come to the rave
But they could hear that Zed bass from the house
I was like seen that speed though
Should have been wherever we go
Trust me, we turn up like it seems low
My vibe got a couple people [?] bro
I'm in the corner like Trigga
Sippin' on the Liquor
That will probly mess with my [?]
I take two [?] and pass the screw figure
Time for that Soundboy Killer
Time for that Soundboy Killer
Time for that Soundboy Killer
Time for that Soundboy Killer
