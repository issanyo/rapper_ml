[Intro]
Wasteman, sniffhead, dickhead, pussy
Yo, about to get real shelly inside, bruv
Fuck Row D, you fucking pussyhole, bruv
Why don't you fuck your mum, bruv?
Dickhead, bruv
Chatting shit about I'm fat, listen, yo

[Verse 1]
You fruity white don on this gay Alan Carr ting
Got no Ps for a whip, no drive, no friends
To at least go karting, fam, it's a par ting
Old man see her so he's departing
Big man, no wife, no kids, but if you had a wife
I'd get down to the clarting
Man tried call me fat on a sore ting
You're just gassed off the coke that you're snorting
Whoops, I mean Coke that you're drinking
Row D, you're a victim
I know you suck dick so you started bitching
Row D in a bodybag, man ditched him
You little pussyhole, so your life is a bore
Tap at your door, let that sink in
Bang to your jaw, let that sink in
You sniff rock, let that sink in
You've got no Ps for a mortgage
You're on sleep on the floor things
All of your music's dead but
For some reason, you keep coming with more things
I swear white dons who can rap are morphing
This little pig that breads
You fucking bacon sarni
You wear bare purple, that's a fucked up Barney

[Hook]
It's 'bout to get clarty
Row D looks like one of those
Fucked up guys in the corner
Waiting so he can molest kids at parties
Said it's 'bout to get clarty
Row D looks like one of those
Fucked up guys who sat on his bed
Then wished he could try have sex with his auntie
I said it's 'bout to get clarty
Row D looks like one of those
Fucked up guys in the corner
Waiting so he can molest kids at parties
I said it's 'bout to get clarty
Row D looks like one of those
Fucked up guys who sat on his bed
Then wished he could try have sex with his auntie

[Verse 2]
Cuh man don't care about this little pig
Shots in his head, then he starts turn pink
Younger, give me some change for a drink
You're a wasteman, you ain't on no things
You wouldn't hold no bangs to your lip
Fucked up hospital ting on a drip
Man ah get dons that'll draw for the clip
Rise up your wig if you're talking all big
Don't try talk 'bout AJ
Are you fucking dumb, bruv? Your face get write off
Make man switch, knock your lights off
Run up on your yard, cut your light, star
You will get nabbed if you wanna fight, I'll
Play no games, if you say my name
Then you better mind out
If you talk greaze, then the mandem ride out
If you talk greaze, then the mandem duppy
You don't wanna come link up with the brukky
See, everyting turn mucky
Your old man is the reason you're lucky
Or you see my niggas jump out on a chucky
No Child's Play, man, you're fucking with Chucky
So, big man
You better know we're on more than a fuckery
Little pussyhole, fam, you don't wanna buck me
Cuh the female members of your family wanna fuck me
Said it's 'bout to get clarty
Violations get dealt with abruptly
See, man are like bossa
You're an overaged punty
We're actually making it
You're just stuck in your dumb jeans

[Hook]
I said it's 'bout to get clarty
Row D looks like one of those
Fucked up guys in the corner
Waiting so he can molest kids at parties
Said it's 'bout to get clarty
Row D looks like one of those
Fucked up guys who sat on his bed
Then wished he could try have sex with his auntie

[Outro]
How have you been broke your whole fucking life?
You fucking dickhead, go and get some Ps, bruv
Talking 'bout the mandem, you fucking pussyhole
Fuck your mum, bruv
