[Verse 1: Milli Major]
It's 2-15 and I'm still gassed
I won't ever change, you know like that
I was like "Chip, sling me this verse
True say it's mad we ain't done a track"
Try diss me and you're taking a bus
I might phone your bitch and pay for a cab
I'm gonna murk it, Chipmunk murked it
Scru's gonna murk it and so's Max
MCs run out of punchlines
See, I'm on job when it comes to crunch time
Major, shout out to Bloodline
No pussyholes in my bloodline
Look, I'll go anywhere, I ain't never scared
Looking for a shook one? Stop looking here
I see some gold digging bitches
Better keep that shit over there

[Hook: Chip](x2)
Waiting on, just waiting on my time
Need to brush some of these bitches off of my line
You been laying low, we ain't heard from you in time
Don't worry bout me, don't worry bout me, I'm fine

[Verse 2: Maxsta]
Yeah, young Mizzy up in the remix
I get it popping, I'm the hottest brudda out of E6
[?] niggas in Becky so
Newham's got talent, I ain't thinking you're ready, nah
Tell your girl I'm a hustler, baby
She can get fucked if she rates me
Man's got a name on the road and my niggas are the A Team
They be shooting out of dingers but I might mainstream
I run grime like [?]
You got bun like a riddim from the 80s
Chilling with my main squeeze, then I'm with your beanie
I've been on billboards, pussyhole, I know you see me
I'm what you like, that's younger Max
Me and Scru and Major, we just bun the track
[?] we're done with that
[?] running hundred laps

[Hook: Chip]

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
Flow fizzy, back on the lizzy
Where me and Mizzy keeping it busy, I'm up in the city
So who's banging for the manor like Trey?
Need a new ting, might holla Young Spray
Cuh everybody talk, and everybody's bad
I hear a couple bredders say they wanna give me rap
Word to Mo Stacks cuh I ain't got no worries
Tiny likkle yout dem can't roll on me
So what? Boy are you on this ting?
Do you really want this ting?
I told Max "fuck everybody coming hard
This year, man are gonna run this ting"
Skipping on the riddim, getting and popping bodies
Or drop it, family is everyting, Max
Tell em I-tell em I can't link another [?] in the ends
Hazel eyes looking like the devil in the flesh

[Hook: Chip]
