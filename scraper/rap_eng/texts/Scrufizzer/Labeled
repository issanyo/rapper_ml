[Verse 1: Cam Meekins]
Yeah, gotta put these youngins on
Game, what the fuck I'm on
Shame, what these labels got
Million ways to fuck us on
Fuck your hook, fuck your song
I just got the fan, I feel like a man when I’m counting all these Benz
Ay, formula to this shit, cook it up like "this quick"
In the stu, 3 a.m, bitches tryna get this dick
But I'm chillin', can’t complain about making millions
I'm higher than the ceiling, with my pen I'm making killings
People caught up on the scene, yeah in high school
I'm just fucking with my team, and we are not cool
And this industry got A&R's from rich neighborhoods
Signing young kids to shitty deals, acting like it's good
That's some systematic fuckery, make me wanna tuck the heat
Shoot up at the label but my music, now I'm up the street
Laughing at the industry, target on my back
Ya’ll too busy getting smack, doing blunts, spending racks
I got trust built, stackin’ up my money like a fucking stilt
Independent grind, bout the business, find another deal
Invest, re-invest, double up it's that simple
The lamp city fan, we pop it like a pimple, ay

[Verse 2: Scru Face Jean]
Look, like a pimple I pop up on instrumentals
And, places I been through and pissed through might leave you [?]
No, faking and chasing [?] crystals [?] I’ll rip you, leave you like menstrual
Bills, my pencil done brought me to different venues
The, money they send you might not be worth what it get you
So, I gotta' hand you and everyone that defend you
Not to offend you, but I can befriend you, you on the menu
You [?], you better not breath, If you thinking that you better than me
I be rapping after every MC, [?] every MC
[?]
Hallelujah! That's the reverent in me
Bout to be who I could never be, industry get ready for me, Ah!
