OK, look, I've been doing this ting from morning
Fuck all the talking, I be on a war ting
I had boy dem run up on my yard
They got the wrong house but they kicked the door in
Anyway, get it how you want it, get it back
If not, get left in the alley with a rat
I'll battle any prat, [?] rap
I'll be telling everybody that the animal is back
There's too many words in my verse
I'll disperse your whole team, certain a merk
I'm still in the road, I've got work on the curbs
So I'm pulling birds, gyal are putting work in their purse
Pull up in a Merc, new shade, German, I swerve
I'm b-b-b-bad like Sherman and Curt
Badman this, badman that
Yeah, it's all fun and games till you get jerked for your work
You're never gonna win it if I switch in a minute
So a nigga better keep it cool
And certain man have been catting the flow for too long
But you know I gotta keep it cool
Shoutout Faith, money haffi mek
Gotta make change, gotta get cheques
Do it for the 'Gram, do it for the ends
Certain wasteman wanna do it for the friends, but are you
In it for the money? I'm a don
I'm still bodying niggas whenever, I'm a don
Better roll over, I used to sleep on the floor
Cause I never had no sofa
Skin fade and a high top
Air Max, 90s, no, I never had a comb-over
Now I'm on the road to riches from Ealing
Killing everybody, I shatter a glass ceiling
Cause I put West on the map, that's true
Next year, I'mma bring everyone through
So anybody coming on a badman ting
Doot-doot-doot, you don't wanna buck Scru
Not funny [?] gonna last
If I blast, I leave that nigga in the past
Yo Air Max, I had to borrow that bar
I'mma start on a riddim whenever I'm on task
I must've been a prick in my past life
Cause I harlem shaked through the hard times
Yeah, I been doing this ting
Before I heard [?] spitting like [?]
Yeah, I rep West 13
But I carry North West on my chest like Kanye
Underrated, let me tell 'em
When I come in, man are running cuh somebody's heard a shot
And man are nothing, if I'm pressing a button, I'm gonna run in body bagging
I be clapping and rapping, yeah nigga
Shout out man that think them man are clapping, imagine [?] pattern
Like you're wicked, I give 'em another Russian
Put a something in your melon and [?]
I can bring it to ya [?]
Oi, shut your mout, yeah?
Rapid, woo
