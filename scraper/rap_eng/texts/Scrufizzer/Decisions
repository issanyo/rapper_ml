[Jaja Soze]
Yo
I go through life calm, trust me I'm calm with it
No Christian but I still throw a psalm at it
Life's what you make it, I say get dough and cake it
We're supposed to be equal, we was all born naked
But anyway back to basic, your in charge, create it
If you're struggling then face it
I reach for the stars and leave prison bars
Alone, I'm in the zone drivin' new cars
We don't follow the rest, talkin' garbage and sex
I'm with the real brothers, something like the best of the best
And all I do is succeed, lookin' after my scene
But those that test me, you can still bleed
See I'm a leader that leads, that ain't promoting greens
My book is my gun, nowadays I love to read
I live the high life, chillin' with a nice wife
So when you see me I'm smilin', high five

[Scrufizzer]
So when you're rhyming, defining your vision
Shine and show pride and you glisten
Striking their minds 'til they listen
Time after time and your gettin'
Closer, you climb and your seein'
Friends are dividin' and preein'
Watch out for signs of the demons
Scopin' and spyin', you see 'em
I had words with the Lords about the fast track
L-L-Lucky I survived in my car crash
I-I-I really thought my time was up
I saw the pearly gates, and then my eyes were shut
Wakin' up in cold sweats, feelin' so-o blessed
They can't hear the mathematic trappin' mos def, you know ?
Before I stole pez, I used to role ?, now I flow ?
I'm killin' the rest for mo' checks
It's time you no-tice that
You gotta follow your goals, you know brother!
And if you get knocked down, get up and go harder
There's no need to stop now
Already ahead of my game
It's Fizzer and Faith
None of you people comin' can really step on the name ooh

[Faithy]
I've lost, nearly all my brothers to crime and war
I've got my pies up, I don't really need to talk
Let me teach you how to dip, and how to store
All the money from the strips, and how to ball
I'm still Faithy tryna do good for all
Carry out good dead's even if it's small
Stack peas for the (?), good dead's for the (?), yeah
No money, mum still took me arcade
Today's everyone's last day
Get my pies up, ever since the car chase
Tattooed roses symbolise my last taste
No window, do you speak on glaze?
Get it?
Deutsche marks for the deutsche's
Hatin' me is hatin' yourself, so...

[Scrufizzer]
You want a eye and eye for diamond or the tena light ina di place
Them wan' fi see you die becau' your gettin' shine, ready for life
Becau' you never lay out in a Bagutta life, runnin' around
Deh man a beat them shots at them gyal a skive
But deh the tings I know, from my pro, when you role 'pon di road
You cyan't feel nobody on the road
You can't feel nobody on the road
Yeah
