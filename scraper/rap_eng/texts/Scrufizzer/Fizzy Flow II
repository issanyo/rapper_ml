(Woah)
(Woah)

I got my style from my brudda
Eyes from my mother
Rapping iller than all these guys on the come up
Better mind who you buck up
Your grind couldn't sum up
The stress I went through been at my line in the summer
Last PRS cheque coulda bought me a armor
Real talk I ain't gotta lie to a brudda
Real talk I ain't gotta lie to a brudda
Stepped out in my Kurt Geiger the stunner
Close and heavily
Sit down pon di riddim
Me ah wa stroke di melody
Bringin loads of energy
Physios the therapy
Don't worry 'bout me
I bring the heat to your ear like aroma therapy
Gave up my heart, I should be a organ donor
Love drunk, sorta sober, all my feelings falling over
My ex-girl well I'm sort of over acting like a
Fool. Patterns in my life I'm slightly coolin'
Yes I'm back in the mixtrap
With the hits, skippin on the riddim
When I shoulda been backing the diss
Ain't done this for a long time
Any man wanna talk but they never come by
Woah
Yo Mikey Jay, niggas from the other side wanna slightly hate
Too many MCs wanna hide when they ain't done nothing
Better than the figure OK
Never did this, never did that
Shoulda, coulda, woulda but you really wanna chat
Came from this, went from that
To be honest, I don't really wanna go back
Woah
Lyrical everyting
See mi a di boss
139, what you know about the squad?

Money on the vision
Bar so much I can probably board a prison
Never stop I'm on a mission
Not everyone can be a boss
So play your position
On some black butter shit
I Rudimental every riddim
Never give up on a passion that you really love
Nothing happens overnight, I'm telling you it's rough
Days I was sinning, killing rappers on my hitlist
One some Etta Bond shit, I had them begging for forgiveness
I'm still Amari, back up inna the party
On some Slick Rick shit got me flowing la-di-da-di
See me when you see me got me flowing like a yardie
Tru mi grow up in the garage sit with my mother and aunty
I'm a true hip-hop junkie, jewels be chunky
Pockets slumpy, walking on my ones I'm super comfy
Mikey Jay and Fizzer, the collaborations mucky
New beats and bars cah the cannon's never rusty
Better know that man are going in hardcore
Crept inna backdoor, we're on a mad one
Doing this I'm a captain never sucking
And the bars so hard coulda been a rapking
Woo
Stuck in the middle of giving up feeling ridiculous
In the beginning but things change cause I'm flowing insane
Yes I am out of my mind, come and talk to my eye
Like the boy, [?]
Yeh mi sick in the brain, yeh mi sick in the mind
Cause me carry gun, like the thugs, in Palestine, yeah
