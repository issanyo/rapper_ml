[Intro: Eyez]
Yo
Myself, Eyez, ya dun know
Yo, Scru
Your phone's ringing
Yo, Scru, your phone's ringing

[Chorus 1: Scrufizzer]
Hello, I'm on the road
3210 and a bag full of crow
3210 and a bag full of crow
I was in the ends getting money with my bros like
Money on the phone
Money on the phone
Money on the phone
Money on the phone

(Something for your mind)
That's right

[Verse 1: Scrufizzer]
Gunfingers in the air when I play this tune
Easily, blud, darg, give me space and room
Chatting all my chat but all dem are badman too
Told my man come off the badman juice
Who's dat? What's dat? Stop dat ting
0-double-7, yeah, the hotline bling
Cats on my line wanna cop that ting
Girls on the ends want a chop like this
So I pull up in the four-door and it's all black
Two man hop out the front and back
Looking for the peng ting, looking for the yat
If it ain't that, then it's gonna be a baz, but

[Chorus 2: Scrufizzer]
Hello, I'm on the road

[Verse 3: Eyez]
Bag full of crow, 3210
Break down a Z to 32 tens
Man slang jawns to earn a few pence
Back then, man never heard of you then
I've got cats on the Nokia
Line popping off cuh I'm popular
Back out the ting like a warrior
Show no respect to an officer
Fuck the police
Black yout, so I get stopped by police
Stop and search, check my pockets first
Feds just wanna know what's in my jeans
Feds just wanna get the night locked off
3210 and the line pops off
Ring-ring-ringing all night nonstop
I make the mandem bop, bop, bop
Right now, I feel on top
Uck, they wanna see a good man chop
Chop, chop a man down like crops on job
Shutting down bars and clubs with Josh
See me in the rave with Dubz, grub
Tell your boy that I've got bud, blud
No one in your gang moves crud, stop
You never spent a day on the block

[Chorus 3: Scrufizzer]
Hello, I'm on the road
3210 and a bag full of crow
3210 and a bag full of crow
I was in the ends getting money with my bros like
