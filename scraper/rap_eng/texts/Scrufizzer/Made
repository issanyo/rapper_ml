[Intro]
(Skeptik, you filthy bastard)

[Verse 1: Mikill Pane]
I know slags that need that M CD
So I rap that, keep that STD
Fuck Snapchat, tweet that, DM me, please
Then I tap that, beat that, NPC
That's one of those sounds I do spit on
Play hard for my town, got the new kit on
You're one of those clowns I do shit on
Leave you covered in brown like Louboutin
Whether or not I'm signed to a label
When I spray raps, you're amazed
You're still trying to bring something to the table
I'm a made man, you're a maid
You shouldn't have the dirty cheek to irk me
You should have the courtesy to curtsey
And they haven't got a prayer but they're kneeling down
I give MCs the fear like Ian Brown

[Hook: Trim]
I'm in the making, I'm made
Look what I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
And look who I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
Look what I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
And look who I made it with

[Verse 2: Trim]
Will, I ain't
They don't like the pictures but still, I paint
Trimdictive, and until I awake
These dreams just might be my fate
And need I say
I'm sick with a capital
S, I, C and K
Weeded
Got these lights acting like they can't see my name
Dark side, they can't feel my pain
And these drones won't move
Until I say
If it ain't music, what will I make? What will I face?
Mr Sleep
They don't think I reign
And I don't think I'm sane, it's Crisis

[Hook: Trim]
I'm in the making, I'm made
Look what I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
And look who I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
Look what I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
And look who I made it with

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
While I'm rapping for the passion, you're rapping for the respect
Chatting like you're really banging a magnum or a TEC
Got me looking at everybody, thinking I should've bodied these anybodies
Tryna copy the energy lorry
I mean, I think too much like I could've been with Dizzee
Signed to Dirtee Stank, I could've hit a milli
Instead, I'm in the city billing my Lizzy with my nizzy
Getting busy, clapping her, banging the Fizzy
48 laws of power, you better read
Or study body language if you wanna see
40 shades of grey, I could agree
They'd manipulate your mind with nothing I would believe but
I just think back on memories, happy times
Every opportunity, I'm tryna maximise
Got me looking around, I've got 'em analysed
Every little other thing's looking like a pantomime

[Hook: Trim]
I'm in the making, I'm made
Look what I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
And look who I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
Look what I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
And look who I made it with

[Hook: Trim]
I'm in the making, I'm made
Look what I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
And look who I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
Look what I made it with
I'm in the making, I'm made
And look who I made it with
