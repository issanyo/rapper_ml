[Verse 1]
Uh, so I'm caught up in a daze
Freestyling so I'm caught up in a wave
Stressed out that things ain't going your way
Now you're pissed off, that's why you never call me but
You're thinking "is that another one about you"?
Don't boost your ego if you're about to
Your friends said "you'll be better off without Scru"
Filling up your mind with your doubt but

[Hook]
Hey girl, tell me what's up
I don't know if you wanna fall in love
But right now I don't wanna hold you up but
There ain't no need, there ain't no need to rush
You're rolling up and you're going to see
If you wanna be down, you can roll with me
Just listen to the rhythm and flow with me
Girl there ain't no need, there ain't no need to rush

[Verse 2]
Uh, look, don't it ever pass your mind?
Maybe you're too good for me, are you asking why
Things are going this way? Maybe you'll go or maybe I will stay
I doubt I will change but I can make the thunderstorm rain
Doo-doo-dum-dum, I know you're stuck in your way but
You're feeling like you're smart again
Let's walk in the dark again and draw the art again

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We're getting older, also getting wiser
Also getting smarter, so tell me am I closer
To your heart? I really should've know this from the start
Are you still stuck in the dark? Cause if you are
I wanna light your world up like I once did
Tell me baby, do you love me like you once did?
Or have you gone and run up to a dumb prick?
Tell the truth baby, I know that you want this but

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Woo! It's like this and like that and like this
Woo! It's like this, like that, like this
Woo! It's like this-
No need to rush, there is no need to rush
There is no need to, to, to, to
Like this

[Hook]
