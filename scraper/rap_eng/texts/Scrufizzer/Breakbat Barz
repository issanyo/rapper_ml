Students, revolt

[Verse 1: Mike Skinner]
Words of abuse such as sentimental
Enough for no man to go damn and go mental
Set me off a tangent, tangerine dream of a scene where people get into teams and angrily scream

You feel it in the evening

[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
Unlike a united man city the kite flies for man's pity but hang pretty little Britain
Cool Britannia is in us, but never hang a flag, it's ever so bash a Paki innit?

You feel it in the evening

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
Yeah, starting college can't be bothered, far from it, and my class is [?] and I'm really feeling like a [?]
My mind is dropping past the topic, class is [?] it's hard to promise something that isn't in your heart
Young student when a man'll corrupt him
Thoughts kinda erupting
All kind of disrupting my view trying to see it from a different perspective
But how can I see if my vision's affected?

You feel it in the evening

Verse 4: Scrufizzer
Other hand [?] dropping out of college using the knowledge I could have got if I went outm but then I do
Going [?] feeling like I was on the moon, or I was in the mood
And my coursework should have been in last week fuck that I am gonna pass not be a bum sitting on a bench in the park
Welcome to the life of a student

You feel it in the evening

[Verse 5: Mike Skinner]
Capitalism's been bashed up a little, brittle
Washed up on latte, and pissed up on skittles
Abstract art, sharp darts, the abs of a man pushing stacks in the park
If it's too late, man, listen
I have two great ambitions
Seek truth every day I've been chewing some state visit
There's more power to some
In the warm shower of summer

You feel it in the evening
