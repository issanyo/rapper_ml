[Intro]
Fizzy flow
I've got a brand new sound
Who wants to hear my brand new sound?
I've got a brand new sound
And it goes like

[Bridge]
We're getting, we're getting higher, higher
We're getting, we're getting, we're getting higher, higher
We're getting, we're getting, we're getting higher, higher
We're getting higher, higher

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me about bass
Cuh when I come through
I shake up the room
You can ask P, I beat the tune
Every time I'm on a riddim, I'm really bringing the truth
Woop woop
I really get popping when I'm bringing the flow
I got the whole scene like "Fizzy, gimme some more"
Hard spitting, bars killing, hitting it raw
Rhyme bringer, up pon the beat
I'm locked [?]
They can't stop me like [?]
I mean, that [?] the team
139, already man know
West 13, repping that zone
Paid in full, I am gettin' that dough
So let me switch back, I'm bringing it slow

[Hook]
This one's called "Rap Rave"
Cause when I rap, I make you rave
This one's called "Rap Rave"
Cause when I rap, I make you rave
This one's called "Rap Rave"
Cause when I rap, I make you rave
Don't tell me about rap, rave
Cause when I rap...

[Bridge]
We're getting, we're getting higher, higher
We're getting, we're getting, we're getting higher, higher
We're getting, we're getting, we're getting higher, higher
We're getting higher, higher

[Verse 2]
OK, you should stop
I'm the only brudda from the manor
Skipping on the riddim I'm spinning
You really wanna bring it?
I finish enemies really, you ain't stopping me, flopping me
Honestly, get a better policy
When I'm on the beat, I demolish the people
Be cool, got so much fire in my camp, Lethal
Getting so much higher in the ranks, C4
I wasn't a leader, I'm a teacher
Don't tell me what team's winning
Bad boy, rudeboy, how are you living?
I'm hot shit, I'm really making a killing
Just copped a new spaceship, brudda, I'm living
Them man over there wanna be Mario in the courtroom
High notes they're singing
Funny how man talk tough on a riddim
When I do music, I make the people rap, rave

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some tell I come function
I never said I'm the best
The fans make their own assumption
I'm tryna get my Fizzy Flow style in the lane
But breddas wanna cut in on my junction
Eff a hater
You know you gotta love them
The one thing I don't understand
When MCs diss and think I won't cuss them

[Outro]
D-Do-Don't tell me about
Bass
D-Don't tell me about
Bass
This one's called "Rap Rave"
Cause when I rap, I make you rave
This one's called "Rap Rave"
Cause when I rap...
