[Intro]
Yeah, tell the team that it's on tonight
Call your friends, let's get drunk tonight
We can't do no wrong and you know the vibe is strong
Ooh-oh

[Verse 1]
My Instagram’s not private, so the pagans pree me
Yeah I rep west 13 but I carry North West on my chest like Yeezy
Telephone badman, you man are too neeky
About you got flows on deck, star
I’ll run up in the laboratory like Dee Dee
Like the ting that I got, that’s so handy
Me, I sing but I ain’t no Plan B
Somebody around me better tell Ghetts
That he better stop playing with the nose candy
Me and them boy ain’t no family
Can’t walk the walk, you ain’t no Bambi
Slap it on a pagan, slap it on a brother
See I’m coming to bun up your brothers so casually like
Send a man upsah, have your body popping like Usher
Oi, you likkle pagan, tell me you come for
You man are looking washed up
Got a new ting, that’s a Blue Foot
Peng ting calling me a nuisance
Cuh I run tings like Adenugas
Labels wanna sign us like mucus, Faithy

[Chorus]
Chill out a bit
Chill out a bit
You’re not a badman so chill out a bit
Fall back, fam, chill out a bit
Chill out a bit
Chill out a bit
You’re not a badman so chill out a bit
Fall back, fam, chill out a bit

[Verse 2]
I got the formula, you wanna beat? Then call me up
I’ll still rain on all of ya
You wanna chat ‘bout eyeball this
Come like man are getting cornea
You don’t get it, that one’s over your head
Telling everybody that I’m vocally blessed
Ex girls really can’t phone me again
Pagan friends no that I go to the ends so
Jump in the sea, swim with the fish
You were the man, now you’re a myth
Fuck everybody that begs for a co-sign
Them man be living off a old hype
But I’m back in the track
Flows, I’ve got one million, something like Paco Rabanne
Your man wanna try be clever
But you’re on a young ting like Kylie Jenner
So, come on

[Chorus]
Chill out a bit
Chill out a bit
You’re not a badman so chill out a bit
Fall back, fam, chill out a bit
Chill out a bit
Chill out a bit
You’re not a badman so chill out a bit
Fall back, fam, chill out a bit, but

[Outro]
Tell your friend
To call her friends
I'll call my friends
We can get drunk
Tell your friend
We can't do no wrong and you know the vibe is strong
Yeah, tell the team that it's on tonight
Call your friends, let's get drunk tonight
We can't do no wrong and you know the vibe is strong
Ooh-oh
