[Bridge: Scrufizzer]
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain

[Hook: Jay Norton]
Oh, I, I don't know
Where I lost my mind, but it's gone
You are so wrong
You don't deserve the shit that I put you on

[Verse: Scrufizzer]
Suddenly a lot of fellas wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna bad up
Any bruddas better see me, like these fellas wanna chat up
You fool, you better start stepping aside
Deading your hype if I come with the metal, I ride
I ain't telling 'em twice, you better remind your man
Just jump back [?]
You didn't wanna care, now I'm here, you wanna stare
It's clear, you're a mess, now I'm here, I'm so aware
That you don't respect me like you did
I'm kind of pissed how money changed you, see, life's a bitch
I can see all the jealousy around you
[?] like that sound to you
Can I say that I took your style?
Don't make sense when you ain't been in style

[Hook: Jay Norton]
Oh, I, I don't know
Where I lost my mind, but it's gone
You are so wrong
You don't deserve the shit that I put you on
