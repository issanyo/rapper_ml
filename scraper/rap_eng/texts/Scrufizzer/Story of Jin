OK, should I begin?
There was a boy in the manor called Jin
Sixteen and he'd just finished school
Smart likkle boy, nah, he weren't no fool
Summer holiday in the ends
House party, gonna bring a few friends
Roll up with the squad, gyal dem are feeling ya
Bare hype tings but nuttin's really kicking off
Next day, rolling round ends
Everybody clocks that they ain't got dough
Can't ask Mum cause she ain't at home
And you don't wanna be stealing phones, nah
Couple old'uns rolled by
Said "if you wanna make money, come by
But make sure that you roll with your boy Jin
Cause I know say you and him are best friends" so
They called Jin and told him the lowdown
Said "if you really wanna make money then go down
South Ealing cuh we're ready to roll out
Jin was like "let's go now"
As they rolled up to the park
They saw the big man jump out of the car
He was like "yo, Jin, let me talk business
Cuh I know say you wanna get in this"
Cut the long story short
Big man gave him a two and a Q
Plus a mobile phone, and he said "likkle man
Don't let none of your bredrins know that you're moving dro
Couple months went past
Now Jin's really feeling like an emperor
Now he's making bare dough
He feels like he don't need friends, but
Mandem are scheming
Police are watching all the drug dealings
Out of the ends, Jin keeps beefing
True say he's the new don dada inna Ealing
Things are getting on top
Becuh everybody knows what you do
Plus the big man's calling Jin and Jin answers the phone
Like "yo, wah gwan, my yout?"
It's hype, big man replies
Like "yo, likkle man, better know your size
I don't wanna come around and let my ting sky
Don't piss me off, I swear" and Jin's like
"I don't care 'bout who you are, who you know
I run my ends so don't run your mouth
Even though you brought me in the game
Don't ever think say I won't come to your house"
Jin put the phone down

[Outro]
Who do you think you are, man?
Fuck you think you are, blud?
I'm the fucking man, right now, blud
Man are boss, blud

Man better know that
Fucking Jin
Oi, fam, is that Jin over there? Is that Jin over there?
Oi, fuck that
Oi, pussy, hold this
