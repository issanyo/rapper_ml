Vibe on this, let me get hype on this
Vibe on this, vibe on this
Vibe on this, let me get hype on this

[Verse 1]
Man said he's on a big man ting
But I don't know about that
See me, I'm on a skanking ting
So I've gotta throw 'em right back, cuh
Look, I'm the real McCoy
Stay fizzy on the riddim like soda
Ten missed calls, can't see it on my Voda
Still gotta turn up the swagger like Soulja
Cause I be the champion boy
IPhone, never had a Samsung, boy
If you wanna get richer
You better build a Branson boy
If dem man wanna war onstage
Sting dem like Buju Banton's boys
If I've got a show, and I'm in ends
Know I be coming with the Acton boys

Vibe on this, vibe on this
Vibe on this, let me get hype on this
Vibe on this, vibe on this
Vibe on this, let me get hype on this

[Verse 2]
I ain't come here to watch no face
Nah, I ain't gotta tell a man that
Gyal dem ah pree my ting
Now they wanna get it on Snap
Cuh my team's full of stars
But I don't rep the American flag
Back to back, I'm calm, I'm
Good to go like Elephant Man
So me haffi pattern in here
Anytime you see me murkle a man
People go mad like Jammer's in there
Us man, we've got the best of the DJs
Dem man, they've got the clangers in there
Content mixed with a little bit of flow
God knows that I've got the balance in there

[Hook]
Vibe on this, vibe on this
Vibe on this, let me get hype on this
Vibe on this, vibe on this
Vibe on this, let me get hype on this

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna get vexed but
People make me mad sometimes
Our lives full of ups and down and
Tings get bad sometimes
And what goes around then comes back around
So you've gotta be glad sometimes
And I don't talk too much, but
Man, I've gotta brag sometimes like

[Bridge]
We can do this all night long
We can do this all night long, take a shot if you need to, girl
We can do this all night long, take a shot if you need to
We can do this all night long, take a shot if you need to
