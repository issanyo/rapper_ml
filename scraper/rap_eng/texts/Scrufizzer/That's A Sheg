[Intro: Fizzy]
I dunno what manaman's on, man's on some long thing
Some loo chizz bredrin I ain't even on it blood 'llow it

[Chorus: Scrufizzer]
That's a sheg when you can't make it to a link
That's a sheg man owe you money in the ends
That's a sheg, dat-dat-diddy-dat a sheg-gum
That's a sheg

[Verse 1: Scrufizzer]
Yeah where living in the gully that's true
Everybody's tryna make ah money that's true
Grew up in a manor where friends snake you
And you can't be sure who's got your back
When you're on the road better watch your back
Feds on the case trying stop and search
Where have you been? I've got come from work
Routine check, got to do a drug search
Mate do you smoke? Show me the drugs
How can I smoke if I came off a buss?
You ain't found nothing so let me go
Officer, I got places to go

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Scrufizzer]
So many problems stuck on grind
I didn't write rhymes for time
My mine was blind it's like I'm trying find the time asking why
And I'm scarred by the hype, it's like girlfriend stress
Hell things sets, I don't wanna be upon the road welcome were in prison
Man are in Feltham sitting or they're stuck on bail condition
Whole wide trap, phone lines tapped
Getting gully in the manor isn't so wise fam
But we're getting gully with the hammers, bros might bang
Everybody saying der real them man are joke, they don't hold or roll with the something at all, no one's loyal
Back stabbers are stabbing a man standing, coming like we're living up in Manhattan
Everybody's banging a clapping a man standing

[Pre-Chorus: Scrufizzer]
That's a sheg, girl ain't picking up her phone
That's a sheg, certain man are ducking you for dough
That's a sheg and you can't make it on your own
That's a sheg

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Swing Jones]
That's a sheg when your up is the only time that they love you in the ends they gon love me when I'm broke
When I'm broke they be vex and that's all cause of the pigs
Middle finger to the friends I don't care look
Real shit, I just kill shit when I'm smoking all of my ganja
Scrufizzer, that's my darg so it's no comment when they grab us
139 we make bangers, better call for your back up
If that's your girl then my bad, cause I fucked her all on my camera

[Chorus x2]

Youth man
Ayo Tunjee, respect for this

[Bridge: Scrufizzer]
Youth man cry, youth man cry
Another youth man die, youth man die
Woo ohh, this ah de cry of the nation
This ah de like Vybz, I'm a lyrical efregin style
I'm bringing the trend again diss pon the diss
Mi come and diss you pon your ends again, remember when
Money never mek, mi couldn't ah spend again
Now me praise jah for the blessing that him send again

[Verse 4: Scrufizzer]
Suck your mudda, that's your word, I got it
These niggas can't beef, that will hurt your pocket
I kept it real from the jump, these man are not a threat
Internet bangers only banging on the net
That don't make no sense, everybody talks but you couldn't be a threat
I'm live in the flesh, don't let me get old school on the riddim and lyrically start firing again
Can't ride in the ends no more, I don't wanna gas
I don't really wanna talk but niggas wanna chat
Like they really wanna war till ten man come to your door like bap-brap beap

[Bridge: Scrufizzer]
