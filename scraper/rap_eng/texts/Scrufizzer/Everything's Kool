[Verse 1]
I be like "H, any funny business, everyting sheg"
We shot caller, come out the west
Tell a likkle man "don't big up your chest"
You will get kill off killy like Prez
Every time I go on the riddim I sound fresh
Mash up the beats when I'm on set
Brand new flow so I gotta impress
If it ain't Stay Fizzy then it is dench
Gyal see I move dodgy
When I'm on the mic, never sound sloppy
I don't think ooo better than Kozzie
Dem boy nuh bad, plastic dolly
I don't wanna battle cause it's all long
Money I fi mek, bill up the wong
I'm from West but I go Brum
Shoutout C4 and SafOne

[Hook]
Fam, everything's kool
Oi, fam, everything's kool
Oi, fam, everything's kool
Man don't say I'm better than you
Oi, fam, everything's kool
Oi, blud, everything's kool
Oi, fam, everything's kool
139ers

[Verse 2]
Man know I've got plans
Shout out Saskay and Killa Cam
I just hopped off the plane from 'Dam
I don't really smoke but man, I had dank
First time in a lifetime, that's cas'
To be honest, I ain't really into small chat
You don't wanna get hotted up like blam
Really thought Chantelle had my back
Dem gyal are vacant, I'm not in any way
[?]
Mi bring all di vibe like Adi Banton
Boo boo boo boo boo boo boop watch where I stomp on
Mi a [?]
Y'all know say mi a go make it
Stay Fizzy T-shirt, it's rated
This year I wanna make music money
So I'm telling everybody that I'm on a playlist, anyway

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I still got the fizzy flow
See me when you see me, you see me? Better get busy bro
If you really wanna, I'm on a, will never see me though
Stepping up a level, the level is higher, see me though
Bruddas in the manor are banging this in their stereo
Coming with the swagger, the lyrics are getting better though
Turn up in a battle with Fizzy, you know I'll bury yo
But let me tell you that I ain't gonna lose
