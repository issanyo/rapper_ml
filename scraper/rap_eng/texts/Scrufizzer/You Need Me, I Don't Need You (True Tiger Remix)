[Verse 1: Dot Rotten & Scrufizzer]
Right now it's the millitant spot with Fizzer and Dot
We've got a villainous plot to make billions watch
Bringing the hot flows skipping across
Delivering some of the illest bars, killing them off
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah we're doing the damn thing
Man think we need them but onna that thing
Nah I'm back in this raptures, double my ad-libs
Got them all banging the anthems having a madness
For me the music's the thorn in my vein
Calling my name, yeah, we're lord of the raves
I swear down I got them all talking my name
Been working all year it's the ultimate gain
Uh, look I don't need you making us angry, we were so peaceful
You don't really wanna see us get so lethal, any foe to approach
Will be ghosted and don't be fooled, yes, people

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2: Dot Rotten & Scrufizzer]
Yeah, yeah y'all messed up everybody's hyped
Even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes
Many were the times that he saw me stepping on the mic
Setting it alight, come up with the energy and vibe
Feel like I'm back from a coma, stronger than ever
Songs are forever so I'm living longer than ever
Any genre, whatever, I'll be setting off a bomb
Cause my longevity's just too long for a measure
Well I'm setting off better, I'm taking over faster
Showering down, you better put your umbrella on
Yeah I'm stepping up a level, got my foot on the pedal
I'm coming to be the better vision than [?] when I'm spitting
They had to resist because they need a stage to perform
Case and a cord, you won't see me pace through the door
Thinking I'm gonna be rich so I'm chasing the Forbes
Spreading like a plague, songs getting played when I [?]

[Chorus (Extended): Ed Sheeran]
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

[Verse 3: Dot Rotten & Scrufizzer]
Yo, living out our days in [?]
As if I went crazy in a whip crashing the ride
Double "P" when we enter that's passion and pride
They ain't gotta life cause they let that battery die
I'm a shooting star that ain't catching your eye
An assassin with lines and immaculate rhymes
They all say they're the truth but it's actually lies
So we hit them with a punch like a Cassidy line
Yeah I tried to relax but you can feel the anger inside
Raging like I stand on the right, yeah my stamina is high
Yeah I'm living like I stand with the Mayans
So think twice cause our plans are defiant
It's blatant you need me, who's this face on the TV?
Come on, we're taking it easy
Got kids in the school exchanging the CD
Love hearing the bars, impatient to cheer me

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me](3455538)

[[Chorus (Extended): Ed Sheeran]
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
