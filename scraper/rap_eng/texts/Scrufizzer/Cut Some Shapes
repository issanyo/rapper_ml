[Intro: Scrufizzer & Neutrino]
That's right
Scrufizzer and Neutrino
Yeah, Super Neuch
Srufizzer and Neutrino
That's right
Riddim Commission

[Chorus: Scrufizzer & Neutrino]
I ain't come here to watch no face
I just come to cut some shapes
I ain't come here to watch no face
I just come to cut some shapes

[Verse 1: Scrufizzer]
Buss-buss-buss-buss it up with the deep flow
Big bassline for your ego
Room full of peng tings
Play hard but we never had cheat codes
Pull up-pull up on the set like Migos
Old school swagger with the new Moschino
This one here's bound for the reload
Pure Oxide with a little Neutrino

[Verse 2: Neutrino]
Because I'm super, so what you sayin'?
Used to bring a blunt out always raving
And yeah, my crew love a stage invasion
All-white outfits, champagne sprayin
Nobody did it like we did in the rave
On the stage, front page of the main tabloid
Filtrate, insane in the way we changed the game
Bound to the bou- ahh, behave

[Chorus: Scrufizzer & Neutrino]
I ain't come here to watch no face
I just come to cut some shapes
I ain't come here to watch no face
Cut some shapes

[Verse 3: Neutrino]
Oi, look at that waist
Wingman, talk to her ugly mate
I'm about to cut back to her place
For that Coca-Cola bottle shape
Got the gate, I've got the key
I've got reality, she got the dream
I got the ball so I gave her the dragon
Play again, time [?] special beam cannon

[Verse 4: Scrufizzer]
Neutrino give you that warning
Pull it up, badman forward
Party all night
Yeah, we're gonna do it till the morning
I be like pop that case
Step pon the line and you signal the plane
I ain't come here to watch no face
I just come here to cut some shapes
