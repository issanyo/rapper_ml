[Intro: Riko Dan]
Yo, this is Riko Dan the London City Warlord
Skream and Friction inna the place right now rudebwoy

[Hook: Riko Dan]
Cuh we are the big dutty stinkin' dancehall kingpins
We're the in ting, I don't know what you're tinkin'
Cuh when I'm rinsing lyrics inna dis ting
Everybody knows that we're the big kings, again
Big dutty stinkin' dancehall kingpins
We're the in ting, I don't know what you're tinkin'
Cuh when I'm rinsing lyrics inna dis ting
Everybody knows that we're the big kings, again

[Verse 1: Scrufizzer]
Look look, I'm an old school rudeboy, ruffneck soldier
Word to Crazy T, I swear my heart is getting colder
Grew up on my lonely with no brother, just a older
Living in the village with some lady birds and cobras
No I don't trust a soul, no I don't trust a soul
Rude brothers up on my team, the whole time I am on my own
Them brothers coming at me, keep talking dollar stacking my premium
Crazy brother, do the damn thing, if you get up on the riddim and choose the damn thing, that's murder
Can you say FI double Z? Might find it said every time I'm on the set
Guys wanna say nigga let me ride on your set
Can't remember when they lyrically stand for a name
Woop woop, I'm alive on the fresh, rise to the ends
Show again grime isn't dead, whoops I
Mean grime is alive, stunned me at bringing this hyper than hype
I'm a lyrical skeng like Goose on your ride
Don't violate my team, I'm rinsing it live
Woop woop, clash ting when I done that
Fizzy flow, they know that I run that
Ready for the comeback, cause yo we are the

[Hook: Riko Dan]
We are the big dutty stinkin' dancehall kingpins
We're the in ting, I don't know what you're tinkin'
Cuh when I'm rinsing lyrics inna dis ting
Everybody knows that we're the big kings, again
Big dutty stinkin' dancehall kingpins
We're the in ting, I don't know what you're tinkin'
Cuh when I'm rinsing lyrics inna dis ting
Everybody knows that we're the big kings, again

[Verse 2: P Money]
You picked up my pad, I didn't tell you to take it
Now you're confusing matters, game over as soon as you've played it
So you've ignored my fine flow so you have to cough up and you payed it
Looking ever so sad as if somebody gave you a face lift
Yeah this flow is a beast, I'm the only person to tame it
All my rivals [?] in more ways than one, they can't take it
Now my vision's the greatest, set up a picture and frame it
Throw magic from CD to TV on some David Blaine shit
They thought I was basic till they saw the scientist rate it
1.4 on the Richter, got their whole house Harlem Shaking
You play levels and get stuck, I see the level and raise it
My name's so bait, I put it on fire so your girlfriend will take it
To see the world like me, you'd probably have to be in a spaceship
I could hold your world record, probably act clumsy and break it
My verse repainted this tune, it came out MAC back when I spray it
The way I flow with an illness, I've got doctors hoping I'll make it

[Hook: Riko Dan]
We are the big dutty stinkin' dancehall kingpins
We're the in ting, I don't know what you're tinkin'
Cuh when I'm rinsing lyrics inna dis ting
Everybody knows that we're the big kings, again
Big dutty stinkin' dancehall kingpins
We're the in ting, I don't know what you're tinkin'
Cuh when I'm rinsing lyrics inna dis ting
Everybody knows that we're the big kings, again
