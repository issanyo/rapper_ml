[Intro]
Major
This is a statement
I'm not saying I'm rich, blud
I'm just saying maybe your girl deserves better
You get me? Stable

[Bridge: Milli Major]
Your boyfriend's crap
Come with me, live it up
So we can get drunk all night
Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?
So we can get drunk all night
Turn down for what?

[Hook: Milli Major](x2)
Act like a boy but you wanna be the man
Pose for a picture and then hold hands
I do it for my Bloodline, do it for my fam
You do it for the Vine, do it for the 'Gram

[Verse 1: Milli Major]
More time I don't bring up the dargs but
On this occasion, 20 man roll
So I can't lie, I was gassed for the show
I was like "Doughboy, have you got your satnav?"
He was like "yeah, take this postcode"
How's man saying that they can't ring [?]
My dargy in jail's got cred on phone
He keeps in touch till he clutches the road
You came with your man
Bet he don't like us
Said he's gonna go to the car
But you wanna buy drinks at the bar
Just got to the club
And you weren't so hard
Forget about that
Come party with us

[Hook](x2) + [Bridge]

[Verse 2: Lil Nasty]
My likkle brudda, fresh home
My borough, no flex zone
Don't try and trap, you'll get smacked
Your packs jacked and sent home
I'm been bad, them feds know
I get gash, them red bones
I do it big but I'm 10 stone
I could set up [?] from the bando
These fruitcakes, they're like mangos
If you got weight then it can go
If I catch you, it's a sad ting
I'm on a mad ting with that Rambo
I'm a hot boy, but my gang's cold
And we got toys that bang loads
I'm unemployed but I'm on my job
I'm not soft like marshmallows

[Hook](x2) + [Bridge]

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
Roll out with the shooters, see me move certi
Might call Major, might call Birdie
Life that I live, I could dead early
And I ain't gonna take that personally
Could've been a baller, I was doing it semi
Pro, every other week I was getting loads
Stepping up a level [?] these man are getting old
Yeah, I'm telling my people you really better know
When I ride in mic, I
Kill off the beat on sight
Then murkle a man pon grime
Watch [?] move pon I
Let me bring that vibe
Major, pull up the ting one time
[?] me bad from time
When you hear one three, then you hear nine

[Hook](x2) + [Bridge]
