[Chorus]
Be real
Man wanna pretend more time
Pagan ting
See gyal dem sell out their friend more time
Girlfriend's calling my phone
Said I've gotta spend more time
But that's all mad
Cuh I'm never on ends more time, but
Be real
Man wanna pretend more time
Pagan ting
See gyal dem sell out their friend more time
Girlfriend's calling my phone
Said I've gotta spend more time
But that's all mad
Cuh I'm never on ends more time, but

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I roll deep with the crew
If I've gotta kweng more time
Too many niggas wanna beg more time
Gyal wanna fuck but I've gotta sheg more time
Woosh man out of your Clarks
When I send more time
Real talk, man come from the hood
Where mandem will sell out your friend more time, but
Babylon ting
So I scream "fuck feds" more time
That's some ignorant ting
But that's what they're putting in the press more time
Business calls
God knows that I never text more time
Any time you see me in a business suit
Better know that I'm picking up a cheque more time, but yo

[Chorus]
Be real
Man wanna pretend more time
Pagan ting
See gyal dem sell out their friend more time
Girlfriend's calling my phone
Said I've gotta spend more time
But that's all mad
Cuh I'm never on ends more time, but
Be real
Man wanna pretend more time
Pagan ting
See gyal dem sell out their friend more time
Girlfriend's calling my phone
Said I've gotta spend more time
But that's all mad
Cuh I'm never on ends more time, but

[Verse 2]
Telling you the realest
God first when I'm fighting my demons
You ain't a real artist
If you've never been depressed
Negative energy
Man have gotta reject
Now I'm heading for the mix like EZ
Man better respect, we run the ting, go G check
Man are getting them bands
Roley, check out the president, fam
Slide on dem outside of the shoobs
Then step pon dem like Elephant Man
Don't think you're a big boy
'Cause you got a wheel-up
Tings ah go heat up, tunes ah go beat up
Married to the game but I never had a prenup

[Chorus]
Be real
Man wanna pretend more time
Pagan ting
See gyal dem sell out their friend more time
Girlfriend's calling my phone
Said I've gotta spend more time
But that's all mad
Cuh I'm never on ends more time, but
Be real
Man wanna pretend more time
Pagan ting
See gyal dem sell out their friend more time
Girlfriend's calling my phone
Said I've gotta spend more time
But that's all mad
Cuh I'm never on ends more time, but

[Outro]
Yo
Man roll up to your set like "yo"
You're never gonna win it if I kill 'em with a lyric
When man roll up to your set like woo, woo, woo
Yo
Man roll up to your set like "yo"
You're never gonna win it if I kill 'em with a lyric
When man roll up to your set like diddy-di-dat-di-dat's right, right, right
What you say?
