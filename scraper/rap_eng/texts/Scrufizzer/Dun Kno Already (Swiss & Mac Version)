[Intro: Scrufizzer]
Fizzy flow's on a hype ting
I ain't got no time fi write dis
I did phone up Megaman
For the So Solid collab remix
With the flow, I'mma go nuts
Got a Ruff Sqwad like Scholar and So Large
See me buss mic like I'm West 3's soldier
(Oi, remix, large up Ghetts, yep)

[Hook: Scrufizzer]
I called up my boy for the remix
He was like yeah, you dun know already
I know my pagans gon' pree this
They'll be like yeah, you dun know already
Don't don't ask who's talking the realest
You'll be like Scru, you dun know already
Man know I be schooling teachers
They be like you dun know-

[Verse 1: Swiss]
My flow's like a gunshot, I'll put a cap on your headtop
That's a Megaman hat for ya
Then I'll open your chest up
Call that Lisa Maffia
If grime came from the dirt
Then we planted the seed, ain't that a new tree? No?
Cause if "Oh No" ain't no good for me
Then it's bound for the reload
Reload fi the peak hoe dem a pree
We flow like speedboats in the scene
Never choke like girls deep-throating the D
Dun-du-dun-du-dun-dun dibbadee
Came to take the lump sum for my fee
Vacate the place cause I come from the street
French kiss, got two tongues on my feet
Straight up, hoe, I come for the beat, beat
We're So Solid right here, here
Right here, do you want it? Oh yeah
Anyway we dare, they follow
Cheer, shout, scream, holla
We're, we're, we're So Solid right here, here
Right here, do you want it? Oh yeah
Anyway we dare, they follow
Cheer, shout, scream, holla

[Verse 2: MAC]
Maniac's back
They don't really know Maniac's back
I come through with a maniac strap
I come through with a maniac stack
Maniac that
One wheel on the R1, yeah, I maniac that
I'm stuck so deep in the game
That they can't find out where Maniac's at
Back in the day was on TV craze
Way before the day of BBK
Give me the mic and like I will spray
Probably the family, who gonna be
Dolce & Gabbana, man, and Moschino
Versace, Vale-Valentino
Miracle, miracle, lyrical flow
M-A-C, you dun know
