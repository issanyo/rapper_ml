[Remixed by DJ Muggs]

(Okay, we're rollin
Hump on the Chump Whompie, take one)

(I wanna know how's everybody feelin?
Damn it, how's everybody feelin?
We finna get FUNKYYYY!)

(Y'all ready for this?)

[ Bret E.B. ]
Let the beat commence, see, we feel that it's time
For you to pump it out loud as we knock out the rhymes
So everybody get hype it's, the way it should be
Sincerely yours, compliments of the 7A3
Just pause - cause the world is yours
And all the kinky cuties wanna kick them drawers
Your city kills but I'm tellin the truth
Everybody gets crazy when we start to get loose
Is it the tone of the voice or the dimples in the cheek?
The movement of the bodies or the way that we speak?
Is it the way that we look or the way that we kiss?
Nah, we got a fresh rhythm, y'all, and it goes like this

(Get funky with it)
(Don't say it's easy)

[ Bret E.B. ]
Get off the wall if you're sittin in the club
Have another drink if you're sittin in the pub
If you're a hermit sittin home all alone
Call up the party line but get on the phone
See, we don't believe in being boring and bland
You wanna have stupid fun? Then we're your helping hand
Life is a party, so don't make it mundane
Get crazy retarted and stupid the same
Honest and open and most forthright
If you don't understand, then you're not that bright
Cause the message is simple, it you cannot miss
Cause I got a fresh rhythm, y'all, and it goes like this

(Get funky with it)
(Don't say it's easy)
(Like this)
And it goes like this

(Like this)

[ Bret E.B. (& Sean E.B.) ]
We're the two MC's, both uniquely devine
You see the cleverness and brilliance, see, they come from the mind
(I'm the slenderness to a certain degree
I'm known as world's finest, my name is Sean E.B.)
Well, I'm Bret E.B. but you can call me unique
I'm like the snow on the top of a mountain peak
See, we're so much different but exactly the same
Cause we both turn around when you call one's name
I'm a Aries (and I'm a Gemini)
Lookin out for each other till the day that we die
Two baby boys born in Brooklyn
Combination of our parents, so you know we're good lookin
Bret and Sean ?????
And together we form Siete A Tres
Started in Linden, cool out in the Ritz
Cause I got a fresh rhythm, y'all, and it goes like this

( *DJ Muggs scratches* )

[ Bret E.B. ]
Yo, 7A3 goin cold into effect
That's my DJ Grandmixer Muggs
I'm Bret E.B
And to the side Sean E.B
So yo, if you wanna step on, you gots to step off
Cause we takin no shorts in '88, uknowmsayin?
Yo, and if you wanna party, remember
It goes LIKE THIS
