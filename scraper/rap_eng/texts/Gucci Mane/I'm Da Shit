[Chorus:]
I'm the shit bitch (4x)
Look at my neck damn
Look at my wrist damn
Look at my bitch damn
Look at my fit damn

[Repeat Chorus:]
Gucci mane you think I'm handsome huh
Prolly cuz I got dat phantom huh
I'll ride yo ass through east Atlanta skate
I'll make yo girlfriend start to hate
Now I can't make you any promises
But I might buy a couple outfits
Make you look like you posta look
Gucci shoes matching pocket books

[Repeat Chorus:] (2x)
It's black magic nigga we keep the waves
And walk like I'm floatin' on air I'm so amazing
And make sure my bullets go through you
Fuck grazing I'm itching just to shoot one of you
Fuck niggas hatin and you could be yo hustler
I'm used to takin' hockey mask all black down just
Like I'm Jason too much time wastin'
Put em on the pavement next day
See his bitchass on front page in

[Repeat Chorus:]
I'll make you envied by another chick
Make you wanna fight another bitch
Make you wanna suck a nigga, dick
Make you wanna eat another bitch
Now I'm gon' take you out to eat and shit my homies lavish
You should see the shit now
Don't be acting all conceited, trick you
Fuck with me, I'll make you famous bitch

[Repeat Chorus:]
