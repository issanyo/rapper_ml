[Verse 1]
The crowd in a rage, Gucci gettin' paid
Icey made your girl throw her thong on the stage
Young Gucci Mane hottest nigga in the A
Sellin plenty yae, movin' 20 bricks a day
Used to have a 86 cut with the T-top
Now I'm in a S-L-5 with a top drop
Too hot to handle, ridin' down Conloe
Baby it's a Kodak moment, get your camera
Gucci Mane LaFlare nigga, damn what you say
Girls goin' crazy 'bout the nigga with the waves
Iced out chain and the fresh Cartiers
Voted best dressed ever since 8th grade
You don't really know us, Lamb with the doors up
Wrist so froze up, it'll make you throw up
Mama, I'mma be like Gucci when I grow up
Move big weight so I got money to throw up
Pimp tight nigga dead fresh with a mink coat
Lookin' for a big booty bitch with a deep throat

[Hook]
I got a 100 dollar haircut
A million dollar smile
I got a trillion dollar brain
Million dollar worth of game
Hoes goin' crazy 'bout that nigga Gucci Mane
Same set with VVS and ain't a damn thang change
I got a 100 dollar haircut
A million dollar smile
I gotta trillion dollar brain
Million dollar worth of game
Hoes goin' crazy 'bout that nigga Gucci Mane
Same set with VVS and ain't a damn thing change
Uh! Ain't a damn thing change
Hoes goin' crazy 'bout that nigga Gucci Mane

[Verse 2]
Got a nine on the seat, shotgun in the trunk
Came to the club, I was already drunk
Laid back young nigga never get crunk
But if you fine might trick a lil' some
Chain sell VVS you would think I'm UPS
'Cause I knock on your door like I got your address
Air fresh everyday nigga that's me
Trash can hoes can't smoke my trees
Gucci MPMP pony my family need me to bring groceries
I'm a 6 4 weed mike check night check
I ain't seen a nigga out flow me yet
A vet in a 'Vette ridin' through yo set
With two out of state state bitches and a case of Moet
A blonde or brunette what we gon' do next
Good sex good day they say I'mma good catch
Gucci mane LaFlare don't fuck with hoodrats
Hit my blunt twice bitch and pass my blunt back

[Hook]
I got a 100 dollar haircut
A million dollar smile
I got a trillion dollar brain
Million dollar worth of game
Hoes goin' crazy 'bout that nigga Gucci Mane
Same, set with VVS and ain't a damn thing change
I got a 100 dollar haircut
A million dollar smile
I gotta trillion dollar brain
Million dollar worth of game
Hoes goin' crazy bout that nigga Gucci Mane
Same set with VVS and ain't a damn thing change
Uh! Ain't a damn thing change
Hoes goin' crazy 'bout that nigga Gucci Mane

[Verse 3:]
Brick man Gucci Mane nigga I'm the man
Yo baby mama told me that she my biggest fan
Say she got my poster hangin' on her wall
And she love every word every song that she heard
Absurd I catch hoes like a stool catch a turd
A school catch a nerd like a child strike a nerve
Absurd with these words with these nouns and these verbs
Kinda perved so I swerved my Lebrons on the curb
Still in the hood gettin' rich on the third
Watchin' out for 12 cause the people observe
I'mma burn one smoke one wit the world for
All the Gucci fans Gucci broads with your girl
