[Intro:]
If you need somebody say yeah yeah
And if she love somebody, say hell yeah

[Verse 1: Gucci]
I can't even lie, baby girl you super cool
And I got a crush on you just like first day of school
Every time I bought some shoes, I bought your ass some shoes
Every time I bought some Trues, you got a pair of Trues
And you left me by myself now girl I'm so confused
Tell me why you do the things, do the things, you do
I like the way you walk, when you walk the way you move
Ain't no secret 'bout it baby, that's what made me choose
One girl ain't enough for me but fuck that shit I'm straightenin' up
Them bitches know shit 'bout me, those hoes just wanna break us up
Come on girl, let's fall in love cause I'm so tired of being tough
This might be beginners luck and I don't wanna fuck it up
I'mma get your hair fixed baby just so I can mess it up
Grab that skirt when you get off of work so we can dress it up
I'mma be here thick and thin and God gon' keep on testing us
I said I wouldn't do it again but I just keep on messin' up

[Hook: Young Thug]
If you need somebody say yeah yeah
And if she love somebody, say hell yeah
If you got somebody say yeah yeah
But if you love that nigga say hell yea
I wanna know, I wanna know if you got a (?)
I wanna know if you love me, say hell yea
I wanna know if you need me, say hell yea
But if you really love that bitch, say hell yea

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I love you
I trust you
I'd fuck ya all night
I'll treat ya body right yea
Buy ya black diamonds, no night
Have you ever had your name on the seat belts of your flight
Cuz that bitch belong to you
Motherfuck who think they king, baby girl I'm throning you
(?) cologne for you
And I ain't never had a girl like you
I know what to do with a girl like you
That's why I just had a little girl for you
You're perfect, I might leave Thug's World for you
And I can't wait till I get home, so you get on the door with that dome
Oh, and I can't wait to get in the house
Cause I'm gonna eat that pizza on the couch
And I can't wait to get upstairs
Cause I'mma put your legs in the air
And I can't wait till we get done
Cause I'mma beat the pussy in the morning
