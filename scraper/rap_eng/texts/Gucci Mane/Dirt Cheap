[Intro]:
808, 1017, Purps on the beat


[Verse 1]:
I'm trying to sell it to you cheap nigga, dirt cheap
You know I sell dope in my sleep, but I don't sleep
You know I sell codeine that lean for a good number
And I got white squares of that clean and that green ganja
I got that shit that make a fiend have extreme hunger
Look like she 50, but I swear she like 10 years younger
These 'sace shades on me and now I feel like Stevie Wonder
But when you go to jail to them your just another number
I called this bitch from jail and made she changed the fucking number
[?]
I'm in that boat motherfucker, traffic bumper bumper
I got your bitch with me and guess what man I'm about to fuck her
