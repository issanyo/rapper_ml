I don’t give a damn about you, nigga
You a nobody!
Them young niggas with me that day
Scared of nobody!
Catch me in the hood showing love to the lowlife
Had the beast deal with you, I ain’t sparing nobody!
Keep that .45 on my hip, like a robot
1017, nigga, we ain’t scared of nobody
He ain’t got to wonder, we bring it cold, we show daddy
The young nigga .. like nobody!

[verse 1]
First off, let me say, I got too many bitches
Second off, I don’t give a fuck about the nigga
MPA, grew up, nigga, that’s a lot of money
DOG, we got street, that’s a lot of diamonds
I got 300 niggas with me scared of nobody
They could get the phone at molly, they’d shoot anybody
They’re so schizophrenic, shoot you dead because you panic
I got your bitch all at the mansion taking off her panties
You know we got it on us and it’s not a question (racks)
And like we’re having problems, then my niggas busting
We got .. to serve....

[Hook]
I don’t give a damn about you, nigga
You a nobody!
Them young niggas with me that day
Scared of nobody!
Catch me in the hood showing love to the lowlife
Had the beast deal with you, I ain’t sparing nobody!
Keep that .45 on my hip, like a robot
1017, nigga, we ain’t scared of nobody
He ain’t got to wonder, we bring it cold, we show daddy
The young nigga .. like nobody!

[Verse 2]
Shoot your closed ones, it’s not a pity sight
D-Boy called a pretty bitch to come and get me right
All ... hitting so hard, I don’t need a light
Street niggas from the hood, with a lot of stripes
Low questions, ass, cause we’re shooting first
I’m on the front of the line like they do to hers
I’m scrapped right now, and my homie got the rooger
I keep it with me like a DJ keep his computer
Same day, I’m on the first class to Bermuda
Money over bitches, I’m flying over shooters
Yeah, D-Boy, we’re moving in the lobby
Quit talking shit, nigga!
You’s a nobody!

[Hook]
I don’t give a damn about you, nigga
You a nobody!
Them young niggas with me that day
Scared of nobody!
Catch me in the hood showing love to the lowlife
Had the beast deal with you, I ain’t sparing nobody!
Keep that .45 on my hip, like a robot
1017, nigga, we ain’t scared of nobody
He ain’t got to wonder, we bring it cold, we show daddy
The young nigga .. like nobody!

[verse 3]
Run around before your niggas and they’re on a fuckerie
A 100 K for head shots, they ain’t gonna bust for me
Green lights on their body, don’t bother to call
A hundred bags of OG, you think I ain’t gonna ball?
Shit! You think my coop ain’t tall
Panemara lost it all, oh
Fucking around with... got me signing on the wall
Everything that I do is getting life out of it all, yeah!
She’s seen me flexing on the floor, just know you can ride it all
I’m about to see my child ... building on...
Super-cool, but on my resume, I’m a dwag, I’m a dwag
Gucci do what he do, that’s my dwag, that’s my dwag!

[Hook]
I don’t give a damn about you, nigga
You a nobody!
Them young niggas with me that day
Scared of nobody!
Catch me in the hood showing love to the lowlife
Had the beast deal with you, I ain’t sparing nobody!
Keep that .45 on my hip, like a robot
1017, nigga, we ain’t scared of nobody
He ain’t got to wonder, we bring it cold, we show daddy
The young nigga .. like nobody!
