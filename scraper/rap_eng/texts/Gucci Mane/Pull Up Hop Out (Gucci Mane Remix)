[Intro: WillThaRapper]
What they like?
Nigga wanna fight?
Oh, woah
It's WillThaRapper boy
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

[Chorus: WillThaRapper]
Pull up and hop out
Your bitch she on my dick, woah
I work out, and purp out
Her nigga mad as shit, so?
I told him pop out, and pull up
He say he wanna kill me, oh
Why he acting scary?
He got a 30, I knew he wouldn't blow

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
I rep the trap, though, but I'm talking facts though
You niggas trap slow, I'm in like I'm a fat hoe
I make it rain on m, but I'm not Fat Joe
I bought a Plane Jane, just to flood the benzo
Pulled up in Benzo, I don't do the friend zone
Ballin like an athlete, but never touched the end zone
Ringside at a floor fight, diamonds fucked up her eyesight
Hoe, get your mind right, come trap with me on the blindside
Loud ice and loud pipe, this that mogul life
I fucked a mogul wife, even fucked a promoter wife
Life is a gamble, baby, fuck with me and blow my dice
Dodgin Miami vice, got locked up in Miami twice

[Chorus: WillThaRapper]
Pull up and hop out
Your bitch she on my dick, woah
I work out, and purp out
Her nigga mad as shit, so?
I told him pop out, and pull up
He say he wanna kill me, oh
Why he acting scary?
He got a 30, I knew he wouldn't blow

[Verse 2: WillThaRapper]
It's time to let these niggas know
Where I'm from, niggas killing over clothes
Them bitches trading up they goals for some dough
They'll set a nigga up, set they niggas up, anyone they know
For a come up, get they funds up, to get any kind of dough
I only fuck bad bitches, not just any type of ho
Smoking strong all week, I don't chief any type of dope
These niggas' traps ain't on the map
They moving any type of dope
Selling crack stepped on like cracks
Junkies don't even wanna smoke
Meet with the plug, take all the drugs
Then I leave him on a boat
There ain't no 30 in this bubble
Just this Nina in my coat
Always got that dick up in her, swear Selena jih ho
These bitches uppity as fuck
She ain't green, she gotta go
That triple beam, it balance low
My diesel jeans, New Balance flow
Put my kids all on her lips, if that lil' bitch a childish ho
Disrespectful, I respect who? not nobody, not a soul
My money running like a nose, it's like my pockets got a cold
A lot of dope, snottin' slow
I shoot 'til the chopper broke
She suck my dick, slob, and stroke
But she say she not a ho
I don't argue, fight, or fuss
I catch my nut then adios
Had to cancel all her plans
I bust all on her party clothes

[Chorus: WillThaRapper]
Pull up and hop out
Your bitch she on my dick, woah
I work out, and purp out
Her nigga mad as shit, so?
I told that nigga pop out, and pull up
He say he wanna kill me, oh
Why he acting scary?
He got a 30, I knew he wouldn't blow
