[Verse 1: Berner]
I'm dumb rich, these suckers can't touch me
The Bern means power with the chopper, so lovely
No hand outs, I got here with nothing
The bezel and the band on my wrist straight bustin'
I got perks from the Asians, guns from the Russians
The VVS's on my chain dancing all custom
I got cookie out in London, bags of blue hundreds
Packs in the trunk, dude want 'em fronted
Stripper bitches catch cash in the AM
And catcher catchin' feelings, well, I can't blame 'em
Fuck the club dog, I'd rather stay in
I got stacks to count, plug these bags just came in
Underground and I like that
Flip a hundred fast, yeah I'm right back
Where the light dips
We squeeze outdoor P's and count a nice check
The sharks in the water and I ain't tryna die yet

[Chorus: Berner]
I got scars on my knuckles, money and the muscle
Bad bitches too, it be hard just to bubble, yeah
All hundreds in my bundle
It was hard being broke but getting money is a struggle
I got scars on my knuckles, money and the muscle
Bad bitches too, it be hard just to bubble, yeah
All hundreds in my bundle
It was hard being broke but getting money is a struggle

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I'm smoking weed while I'm getting dressed
Talking on the phone while I'm getting neck
I got now and I got next
I take how it come, cash or the check
You ask me what we smokin' and I say the best
Got bad bitches getting active and I say les
Fuck niggas, I just don't fuck with 'em
Call that safe sex, I'm 'bout my paycheck, yeah
I like pretty bitches that can roll weed up
I can show you niggas how to run them G's up
I been broke before so I don't want no dealings
Told the car salesman I don't want no ceilings
Pop another bottle, pocket full of dollars
All that ass, she remind me of Ms. Parker
Yeah I came from the bottom and I ain't goin' back
Boy I came from the bottom and I ain't goin' back

[Chorus: Berner]
I got scars on my knuckles, money and the muscle
Bad bitches too, it be hard just to bubble, yeah
All hundreds in my bundle
It was hard being broke but getting money is a struggle
I got scars on my knuckles, money and the muscle
Bad bitches too, it be hard just to bubble, yeah
All hundreds in my bundle
It was hard being broke but getting money is a struggle

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Zone 6 flow, the bay to the 6 ho
Fresh as a fashion show, we gon' go pistachio (loco)
This what you asked for so broomstick up your asshole
I take your future from you, what I need a mask for?
I dropped that bag bro, they might snatch up your dad so
You went out sad bro, I guess that's what you're mad for
I pull in a fuckin' all red drop Rolls
Scorin' like a red nose pit on the Forgio's
What about the bad times, ain't forgot those
I was the snotty nose youngin with the old clothes
Young Dolph, I love that nigga like my brother yo
I fuck with Berner 'cause he represent the struggle yo
Fresh out the pen and I got marks all on my knuckles so
Ask around, I'm the money and the muscle ho
You just a poodle, I'm a wolf without the mussle ho
And y'all niggas is cameltoe, don't make me bust your canteloupe

[Chorus: Berner]
I got scars on my knuckles, money and the muscle
Bad bitches too, it be hard just to bubble, yeah
All hundreds in my bundle
It was hard being broke but getting money is a struggle
I got scars on my knuckles, money and the muscle
Bad bitches too, it be hard just to bubble, yeah
All hundreds in my bundle
It was hard being broke but getting money is a struggle
