[Intro: Gucci Mane]

I keep kush like a Californian
That loud pack stankin' like a bag a funyuns
That loud pack will have a nigga missin' money
That strong purp, I guess the steroids the money

[Verse: Gucci Mane]

I keep kush like a Californian
That loud pack stankin' like a bag a funyuns
That loud pack will have a nigga missin' money
That strong purp, I guess the steroids the money
Traps move coke, Starbucks move coffee
I'm So Icey CEO so bitch get off me
My Girlfriend bossy but I'm her boss man
You working for the government like Mike Vick cousin
Juggalin, Juggin, jabbin and joggin
We keep that white girl I'm talkin Dolly Parton
X pills, Xanax, and Oxycontin
Lambos, Mazis, and Aston Martins
You steppin on my ma's reds, beg ya pardon?
Ya didn't say sorry bitch what's the problem?
So Icey jack boys want to rob him
But how a jack boy gonna rob the robba?
I got more protege's than a lot of mazdas
The So Icey boys betta call the coppas
Choppas, helicopters and patnas
Good weed, caviar, crab and lobster
I seen this bitch I told my dog to watch her
So thick I told my dog to sick her
X pills, iring, kush and liquor
They told van turn this thing up a little
I'm goin
I done stepped it up a little
It's snowin'
So icey make it rain ya drizzle
I'm focused
Ain't one of these average niggas
The Alligator, croc, gator chinchilla
Shawty on the radio but I don't fell em'
But if he say my name then he might fall a victim
So robbas in the club "Whys Gucci's wit em'?"
Cause Gucci gives a fuck
Gucci keep a pistol
Now as the dope bubbles and the cocaine sizzles
Shawty took a line it gave her ass the shivers
I gave her a skittle now she got the giiggles
I gave her two more now she sucked my pickle
I'm with her now with a million pills
If 12 hit this door we gettin a trillion years
I drink Rozay, Cris' and beer
Gotta brick gotta brick in my ring and ear
So Icey trap scholar 08' the year
My jewelry
Lights up like L.A. Gear
And if they pull this Hummer over imma get the chair
Stash spot brick tucked down in every-a-where
Chyea!
