Chilling on bricks the long way up the long way

[Verse 1:]
Bras gon get dropped when i'm pushing the clock
Work with the work and I never could stop
Serve them good goog and they got me good gua
2 packs on 2 blocks i'm serving 2 blocks
2pac and Biggie im better gua
Streets will be sweeping the streets that you mopped
Streets say you soft and streets say you tough
These are the same streets that say that you cop
These are the same streets that say that
You not say what you are eat with a thot
Who woulda thought that i'm dropping the blocks
When the topping i'm watching
I watch from my trunk
Who woulda thought in the time of my prime
And the time of my shine I could take a good slump
Who woulda ever thought, who woulda never brought
Ask yo grandpapa now ask yo girl Java now
Serving some Tylenol serving some Adderall asking [?]
Blessing off working the [?]
Forward the lateral paddler compatible [?]
Itinerary factories i'm using my managers
I use my hands and my niggas just handle you
Candlestick light in yo face on [?]
Yo boy better stop cause my nigga i'm telling you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I got racks on me the pill way long white nigga all by yo self
And a DC snuffing I ain't gleesh I ain't worried bout teuch [?]
Tryna fuck around with this set
Got a four five extendo everything the long way
Treat yo bitch like a runway

Long way long way molly dick I had to stiffen up the dick bitch away [?]
Choked it down like some [?] the kid
Heard you got racks and you ain't rocking the long way
Ain't got yo [?] boy lay that [?] down

Miley Cyrus got me stuck with a mean lil frown
Shit don't know if ima fuck her tryna lay her ass down

Kiss em ever trust nope we ain't tryna miss it [?] had some homies in the kitchen

[Chorus]
