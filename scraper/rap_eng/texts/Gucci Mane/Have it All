[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Watcha thinkin', I mean that nigga buggin'
And have the nerve to be clubbin'
And know when you ain't in his budget
I give you cars so you can dust them
I give you furs so you can fluff them
And when you learn you ain't touchin'
Get what you want girl know I ain't fussin'

You can have it all
Oooh ooh oooh ooh
You can have it all
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
(Gucci)
It is no comparison
I come home every night
And take you out to eat on Saturdays
No if my friend was not a baller he would get by barely
Hilarious
Apparently they hopin' like some parody
I put amazing karats on you
You should see the clarity
We'll copartner a daughter
In the future she'll inherit it
I cannot stop starin' at you
I mean that's a draw
See to get by you in church and we'll donate things to charity
Acknowledge me and I could help you study with geography
Psychology
(unclear)...with my biology,(OK!)
No stoppin' me
Let's shake that ....,
Let's buy some property
It's lonely at the top
So why don't you come and get on top of me
It's Gucci
