[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Left ring, 10 hundred cash
Neck piece, 30 grand
Whip, cost 300 grand
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet, 20 bands
Rims, cost me 5 grand
House, cost 500 cash
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Lying in a whip that don't release until 2010
50 thousand dollars spent just to make my rims spin
Half a million dollars spent on the house I live in
Even more spent on the seat I sit my ass in
Soulja Boy Tell Em, A.K.A The Assassin
Prises cuts in my watch, like I threw some glass in
Damn, exclusive shit sent from China
If you looking for me, I'm probably in your girl's vagina
I'm looking in the mirror, tell me who's finer
Bought a Lamborghini, didn't need a cosigner
Hey, what I spent was just minor
Every cut served Soulja Boy's headliner
Damn, now tell me you don't feel this
Ay, you can't say I'm just one hit
Ay, are you bitch niggas serious?
I'm quick on the track, like the Fast and the Furious

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Left ring, 10 hundred cash
Neck piece, 30 grand
Whip, cost 300 grand
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet, 20 bands
Rims, cost me 5 grand
House, cost 500 cash
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree

I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree (Gucci baby!)
I'm on a shopping spree (It's Gucci, Soulja Boy!)
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
From a Cutlass to a Chevy, Chevy to a Lamborgini
You can't be me or see me, unless you see me on T.V
Shiny and greesy, I wonder if Stevie Wonder can see me
Necklace a jungle of BBs, just check my selection of pieces
Uhh, I got a stupid collection you see it
Chain worth a millie, you silly, really a millie and 20
Hah, man I pass out 50s and 20s
I pass out 50s and 20s
I pass out 100s and 50s
We make more money than chemists, doctors, and lawyers, and dentists
Chemists, the doctors, the lawyers, money together, couldn't get me
2 door Gulardo, 160
Drop, top, 120
House worth a million and three, Dula truck, 63 g's
Old school's a hundred a piece
That cost me 75 g's, 65 actually, but my rims cost me 10 of them things
Gucci, Yo Gotti, the king
Soulja done did it again
This team be 82 g's, that beat is 82 keys
Soulja!

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Left ring, 10 hundred cash
Neck piece, 30 grand
Whip, cost 300 grand
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet, 20 bands
Rims, cost me 5 grand
House, cost 500 cash
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree

I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree (Yo Gotti!)
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
See money ain't the object
Let's give you a option
You go to your stash, partner and I'll come out my pockets
2 hundred hundreds
That's like 20 grand
Just enough for me to buy my bride a new band
I'm like Soulja Boy Tell Em
They think that I'm playing
Come down here to Tennesse and see that I'm the man
Ain't talkin about no rappin
I'm talkin about that trappin
I'm talkin about that brick, I'll ram it straight up pistol package (Check!)
Ringpiece 2,000 grand
Neckpiece 4,000 grand
Fin to cop a Chevy but instead I went and copped a Lamb
Woo! Took your bitch on a shopping spree
Gucci this, Prada this, I think that hoe in love with me
Ain't got security, I keep lots of thugs with me
We call them goons, cause I rock lots of jewlery
Cocaine everything
Who the fuck ain't feelin me?
Gun powder on the market
Realest nigga in the streets

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Left ring, 10 hundred cash
Neck piece, 30 grand
Whip, cost 300 grand
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet, 20 bands
Rims, cost me 5 grand
House, cost 500 cash
God damn, I'm on a shopping spree

I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
I'm on a shopping spree
