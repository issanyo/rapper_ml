[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Pay for what girl you better pay for this dick
She the type to fall for two Xans and an outfit
I’m with the zans crew so it’s hundreds on the floor
My hoes is off in the mo, I be balling ho

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari
These hoes, we done ran through them
Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them
These hoes, we done ran through them
Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I don’t like your kind, you a bougie ho
All in my face like a groupie ho
Can’t do one girl need a group of ho's
She a fool when she on that pole
Break it down, drop it low
Clap that, do it slow
Ran out of ones I’ma order some mo
Shawty got good brains on the honor roll
Can't be no rookie with moves like that, girl you a pro
Hundred bands in my pocket just to let you know
I’m too turnt everything’s a go
What it’s gon be
What it’s gon cost everything’s on me
My company Bricksquad Monopoly

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari
These hoes, we done ran through them
Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them
These hoes, we done ran through them
Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I stay flexin iced out with a bank roll
Drunk as fuck everything’s slow mo
Black girls white girls at my show
Even got latin girls in the front row
Throwin throwin throwing dough
Throwing dough throwin dough
Throwing dough throwin dough
Bitch I said throwing stacks
Her hair long and her ass fat
She screaming broke niggas that way
Where the ballers at
Fuck her all night and never call her back
Homerun the pussy every time I swing my bat
Squad; And if it’s good I’ma double-back
Desperately I need some zans where my doctor at
If it’s good I’ma double-back
Desperate needs for them zans where my doctor at

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari
Rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari, rooster in my rari
These hoes, we done ran through them
Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them
These hoes, we done ran through them
Zans we done chewed them, lames better salute them
