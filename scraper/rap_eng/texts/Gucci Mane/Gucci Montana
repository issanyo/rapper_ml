[Verse 1]

Gucci over do's it, does it the boys perfect
Vette piece fronted, its color scale in the cover
I'm up 900 - Goddamn I spent 100
But that's rap money, when trappin’ that cash nothin'
I'm internet surfin' to a gorrilla in the turfin
G-Boat racin', jet skin' and golfin'
Crazy color Jordans, same color the bought it
Bitch I'm back, I'm ballin', I'm rich hundred regardless
Shrimp scampy odor everytime I fork chick
Trap nigga conversate with a hundred spark bitch
I'm young rich and heartless, put you on a carton
Cartoon jewelery customized by my artist
6 months lost, got a head start bitch
I was nigga rich ever before I ever got a rap check
Yellow corvette same color bow lett
Pay 20 grands just to get every stone set

[Hook]

Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

[Bridge]

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers

[Verse 2]

I'm shittin' on these rappers like I'm wearin' a pamper
I'm sittin' on 500s cause I got it together
Niggas never try niggas that set examples
On cocaine shawty, side to side of the scramper
The port of Miami to the streets of Atlanta
The pinky with the lightstone matchin' yo' candle
Gucci Mane La Flare they call me Gucci Montana
My plug from Georgia, Florida make it Tampa, Alabama
My Mississippi niggas feel me harder then Banner
Haters see my video they switchin' the channel
Gucci got pieces, shawty, go get yo' camera
Gucci time is money, bitch so go get it faster
I could give a damn about your father's a pastor
Just cause I smoke your father than your ass is a bastard
Gucci smokin' weed, so you know he's a hazard
Money on my mind, so bitches don't really matter

[Hook]

Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

[Bridge]

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers

[Verse 3]

Money so big it can't fit in my matress
Never bought the adress cause I signed with Atlantic
Money bigger thirsty then trappin' hispanics
40 in my pocket turn your head into a sandwich
Boss of your boss man, I push the Porsches
Million dollar chain got me feelin' important
Jumped off early and copped me a fork
Makin' mafia money like the king of New York
Gucci go and get it, why them hoes get abortions?
Shittin on a bitch, take a piss on their Jordans
Rap is roverocious, Gucci Mane want the package
Scale in the bag, bitch pay me on the back end
Hamilton’s, Washington’s, Franklin's and Jackson's
Trapper never trip, I just added the fractions
New bitch muggin' brand new mansion
Everything inside from the jeans to my glasses

[Hook]

Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

[Bridge]

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
