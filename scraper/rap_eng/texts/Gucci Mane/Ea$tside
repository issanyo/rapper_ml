[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Guwop or doo-wop
I'm a trap nigga, I'm not hip-hop
Jumping out a Phantom with the Louis flip-flops
My clip long like tube socks
If you say something, I'mma spray something
Wanna fuck something and I'mma pay something
Had a threesome with your BM
And my young niggas'll take some
Take money to make money
I'm a great ape with this AK
Banana clip for these monkey niggas
I'm a millionaire, but a country nigga
Half a mil on a dice game
Three mil on my ice game
Was all good 'til your wife came
It's Gucci Mane, you in my lane

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
Quarter million dollar worth of jewelry, I'm a lick
You haters sittin' plottin', y'all niggas ain't gonna do shit
My name ringing bells cause I done took a lot of bricks
Independent major label deal, I'm filthy rich
Little Mexico lingo, we got a home where we make kilos
You say you move kilos but nigga, you still stuck on zeroes
Fake rappers, I don't like, all I rap is white
VVS my ice, nigga, fuck your highest price

[Verse 4: Alley Boy]
Alley Boy don't play, Little Trouble don't play
Big Black don't play, Little Ricky don't play
Get your take, new face in the A
These young shooters gonna do what I say
New king of the south, they can't do shit
Atta boy, 2Pac in '96
But I ain't get shot, I'mma kill me a bitch
Get Zone 6, I'mma wrap these bricks
See tie-dye, Lord, eye for an eye
War cry nigga, these bullets gonna fly
From 1 to 6 dare nigga to try
Pussy went blind from all that fire
With my gold grill and my gold Bentley
Black father, nigga, no flexin'
Y'all niggas can't do shit
Fuck 'em up, you better stay ready

[Verse 5: Childish Gambino]
Pull up in an Audi, they don't know shit about me
These rappers are so inventive, your Maserati is rented
My second house is in Venice, 3rd in Kaua'i
I got a bird cause I'm fly, I don't wanna brag
These niggas wanna break my neck, they could
I'm a buck fifty when soaking wet, my hood
Got a clear port and an ocean deck
I made a hater eat words, watch him choke to death
Back for more, fuck it, I'mma rap some more
I got some white girls with me like I'm Macklemore
My back is sore, from whippin' in the Jaguar
I'm the goat like a motherfucking Capricorn
Yeah, I hate whack niggas, that's my fucking problem (Tru!)
I'm too turned up like like the fucking volume
These niggas get dropped like my fucking albums
Eastside, Stone Mountain
