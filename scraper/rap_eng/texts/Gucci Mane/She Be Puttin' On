[Hook: Gucci Mane]
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin'
She the type don’t never ever ask for nothing
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin'
She the type don’t never ever ask for nothing
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin'
She pay her own bills cause she got her own money
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin'
She pay her own bills cause she got her own money
She got a car, a job, a swag, she stuntin'
She the type don’t never ever ask for nothing

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
My girl independent
Bitches all in her business
Pink on the back of her boyshorts
Bought everything she own
Love it when she smile and moan
Encore how she groan
Ask around the hood, she known
One of a type she can’t be cloned
“No Hands” for her ringtone
“Hard in da Paint” her theme song
That's my gutta chick
Man I love that bitch
The way she look and moan
When she taking it
And don’t mind McDonald’s
Ain’t no bougie bitch
When I wake up
Breakfast on the table
One rolled up
Sprayed upon the table
Baby ‘po up
Drinking out of the “a” cup
Pass the syrup
I’m finna fuck this food up

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Now she’s stuntin', she’s going in
These hoes can't tell her nothing
She came home in a trench coat
And under it was nothing
I'm so curious, it's serious
My car so fast and furious
But she'll drive a man delirious
I hope all y'all hearing this
She's got swag of a top model
Curves like a coke bottle
She know I go full throttle
I’m walking with a slight wobble
Got choppas like I’m Big Papa
I’m Big Gucci, you a cock blocker
These True Religion not the knock off
My camera chain is an eye problem
I'mma stunt stunt a bill on a half a mil’
Ice crem Gucci Mane, can I live?
Chick knows I got a rubber dick
You know what gone in 60 secs is?
A movie, I’m being me
Just cooling and my DVD
And my BVDs are so I-C-E
Y to the G-U-C-C-I

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
She puttin' on, cash the check
Skinny chick, anorex'
Gnocchi fed anyway
Pissin' ask for mouth (wow)
Work for me and now (wham)
We be showin' off (bam)
Jello don't shake like that (jam)
V-neck on my cardigan
Pulled up in her car again
Tank on E, blowing gas
No, but she gon' start again
Hold it like "oh my God again"
Twin peak like they followin'
Business first, she swallowin'
Brisk walk and we partyin'
