[Hook]
They call me the candyman, candyman, candyman
Skittle bags, Skittle bags..

Pull ups in the air
What they talking about?
?
I'm a syr-syrup sipper
I'mma ?
Grab the ? and then dip her
Hit the coke, hit the coke everywhere
Why I be ashamed ho? I'm a fucking
Millionaire! But right now
I need to calm it all down
Popped me a Klonopin, slowed my ass down
Got great directions like a gray Greyhound
? me I'm going down
Take me a Percocet, crush it all down
Hit it up, hit it up, hit it up..

[Hook]
They call me the candyman, candyman, candyman
Skittle bags, Skittle bags..

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Might be so Icey
I'm blinking like a muthafucker
Like me
Big Gucci higher than I ever was
