[Intro: Gucci Mane]
My name is Gucci
I drank lean
Pop pills
Smoke weed
Aye man, its Gucci

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I smoke a ounce of some shit I can't even pronounce
Since I can't say it right now Im just gone call it that loud
I think I'm Rick James I pass that shit to the crowd
I think I'm George Clint because I'm high and I'm proud
I think I'm Michael Jackson my Dr. give me the scripts
I got my own Pharmacy yo prescription get filled
Who want a Percocet
Who want a Lortab
Who want some clean Molly
You want some Oxycontin
Oh you's a drug user
Man you know Gucci got it
They call me Gucci Google
If I dont got it find it
I got that raw Act
Eat up yo stomach lining
She got a titty ring
I got that nose candy
She eat vicodin back to back like they was Jolly Ranchers
And the Versace dress she wearing look like they body painted
She went to rehab
She bout to relapse
You know I lean and drive
Man I dont need cab
I'm on the E way
I'm in a V-12
I got that Molly sand I'm on the beach with seashells
Ain't you a rapper Gucci
Why you got 3 scales
Man I don't e-mail
Gucci mail bales

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man dont love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man dont love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
We in the club, we high off drugs tonight
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man dont love her right
We high off drugs tonight
(we high off drugs tonight)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
We fucked up
One too many drugs got me fucked up
I got damn near 4 drugs all in one cup
Styrofoam cup it cost me like a hundred bucks
500 dollars everytime I'm pourin' up
300 dollar blunts when I'm rollin' up
I spent 2500 hundred I ain't even had my lunch
OG kush for breakfast for a champion my morning junt
Promethazine on everything I'm pouring lean on my Captain Crunch
Last 12 months not sober once
Which one of yall wanna have some fun
Get ya some on ya tongue need a liver and lung
Playing the guitar high off the same shit that Jimi Hendrix on
Smoking Chronic me and Snoop Lion need to get ya some
Clean bricks I remix me some
Licks out there hit more than 1
Syrup I get drowned upon but then in the mob it's frowned upon
He said he on cloud 9 but I dont know what cloud I'm on
Its Gucci Mane the Rasta man someone please roll the ganja man

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man dont love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man dont love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
We in the club, we high off drugs tonight
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man dont love her right
We high off drugs tonight
(we high off drugs tonight)
