[Pre-Chorus]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
(Be-, better stay yo distance)

[Chorus - Gucci Mane]
Di-, Disrespect a squatter, turn yo ass to a [?]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
Di-, Di-, Disrespect a squatter, turn yo ass to a [?]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
Be-,Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
Be- Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance

[Verse 1: ]
My niggas load choppers, tryna cut you in half
Yo betta' keep yo distance, o' this gunna be a blood bath
I'm a fucking sas with the human and laugh
Hustling on the turf is how I learned to do math
From West Cortland to a half to a whole thang
Gotta let my nuts hang, shoot up em up (bang bang)
Money gang crime bust
Shoot you in your fucking mouth
Don't got an extension
They knockin' down your fucking house
Fucking around with your enterprise
Dirty little kids be ending lives
An' the housewives an' the hoes
Listen to my funky flows
Everyone back in the cornrows
Strapped down, packing two 44s
Bullet holes all in your dome
Walkin' on, I know I'm grown

[Chorus - Gucci Mane]
Di-, Disrespect a squatter, turn yo ass to a [?]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
Di-, Di-, Disrespect a squatter, turn yo ass to a [?]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
Be-, Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
Be-, Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
My gun got an extension so better stay yo distance

[Verse 2 - Reek Daddy]
These are the rules in this game
Real niggas lose the fakes
But now me, a'turn the oven, oven let the fakes bake
Put the gun in your mouth, colgates
Suck it like a porn star, money shot to your face
I'm the monster of this lake, call me Loch Ness
Put your head in the ground, call you ostridge
Smashing on yo' barricade, you ain't stopping this
[?] rattle on ya, flee flicker option
You ain't got shit on lock down, I'm the locksmith
Shooting for ya eyes, call me the optometrist
I'm ignorant [?] like Tyson in his prime
DLK and take a nigga for his last ride
(and execute)

[Chorus - Gucci Mane]
Di-, Disrespect a squatter, turn yo ass to a [?]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
Di-, Di-, Disrespect a squatter, turn yo ass to a [?]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
Be-, Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
Be-, Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
My gun got an extension so better stay yo distance

[Verse 3]
You better keep yo distance
Or get lit up like candle wicks
You home fielding banana clips
My insurgents stay blaming shit
We handing out turning kits, like its free lunch
Catch you sleeping on the job and its free lunch
We run that full court pressure, we don't ease up
No Jesus piece, fuck a gold chain mac-11
Hanging from my neck with a shoe string
Your favorite rapper lose his brain tryna move in my lane
You can't swim with the sharks, you's just a fuck stain
Put the beating on his head like club Elaine
You Richard Simmons, I'm DOK
Yo already know I got that extendo up in that metal thing

[Chorus Outro - Gucci Mane]
Di-, Disrespect a squaller, turn yo ass to a [?]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
Di-, Di-, Disrespect a squaller, turn yo ass to a [?]
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
Be-,Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
Be-, Better stay yo distance (be-better stay yo distance)
And my gun got an extension so better stay yo distance
