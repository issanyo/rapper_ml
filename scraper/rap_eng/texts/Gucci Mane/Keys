[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
My nigga, I don't do pushups
Just pickups and dropoffs
With a bad bitch getting topped off
You try me and get knocked off
For a whole brick of that white soft
Get outlined in that white chalk
Two bowls of loud for that Randy Moss
My niggas shoot, they don't never talk
Jays run up to the car when I pull up, nigga
Coppin' more bands, I cook up, nigga
Fuck no, ain't no hook up, nigga
AK, catch a block shook up, nigga
Your bitch on my meat, she gave me her door key
Put it on me for one week, now that's where my work be

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Full of bad bitches, y'all niggas and G's
My enemies be on my dick, they look like groupies to me
My bad, that's your girlfriend, then why she leaving with me?
We ain't dated but a week, but still she gave me her key

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I saw your homeboy's picture, man: a grandmother of three (wow)
I told 'em count them bands up, I got a seventy a key
And even though you see me MTV jam of the week
I got that stupid and rich game a nigga ever done seen
I got the kangaroo money 'bout to jump out my jeans
I got a hundred thousand dollars, I was just [?]
NBA money, nigga, this just one of my rings
You say a nigga gettin' money, look like no money to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nacho Picasso]
Hopped up out the coffin, gold fangs like I'm Blackula
Poke my bitch in the back and told her, "Work the spatula"
Then I took a piss, I half farted, I have flatulence
I be fucking all these hoes, I don't practice abstinence
Ask your friend, I'm masculine, the boppers keep on hassling
My Mexican on mescaline, stressing him, pressing kids
Pedestrians be stepping in cause I don't look that threatening
Babyface assassin, I throw tantrums, I be flashing
I get high fore I get dressed
Does this mean that I'm high fashion?
Self esteem high, I be high when I be bragging
Breathing like a dragon, beat 'em, leave 'em where we standing
Sniff that white Susan Sarandon or that young Dakota Fanning

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 4: Mack Shine]
I been off this coca so I'm chopping up this yola
If somebody try to take it then this [?]
I'm a rocker and a roller, there'll be problems when we show up
We don't talk much, we just blow up (we don't talk much, we just blow up)
Everybody 'round here know us for the way we keep it P
Me and Nacho P be flavin', extra wavy in the sea
Your homegirls don't give it up cause they gon' save that shit for me
To sum it up, you motherfuckers is as basic as can be
I don't care, she with you tonight, the next day she'll be with me
And you really should be paying me, this game here isn't free
You gon' say that shit to her; why don't you say that shit to me?
Just know I got them good hands from all this playing with these keys, boy

[Hook] (x2)
