[Hook∶ Nicki Minaj (Yung Joc)]
Birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds (They fly high, don't they?)
I was watchin' all the birds on Bouldercrest Street
Watchin' all the birds go tweet, tweet, tweet (C'mon)
Birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds
I was watchin' all the birds on Bouldercrest Street (Ay Gucc)
Watchin' all the birds go tweet, tweet, tweet (Let's give a holla at 'em)

[Verse 1∶ Yung Joc]
Okay it's thirty-six stones on the face of my watch
Got thirty-six zones with the [?] in the pot
I got a thirty-eight chrome that'll blast on spot
Nigga, you don't wanna see me when I'm thirty-eight hot
Yeah, I pay a couple cops just to go and hush 'em up
And we keep that straight drop, we don't play that touch and bust
Got a sixty-nine Chevelle, pimpin', everything for sale
Wrap 'em in the turkey bags, even dogs can't smell
When I take my shirt off, all the hoes stop breathin'
When hit the purp I damn near stop breathin'
Yeah, I'm in and out of traffic, got the old school weavin'
The ice so cold all the hoes start sneezin' (Achoo!)
I'm super p-noid, Joc on alert
Ridin' dirty with the word "no insurance" on the [?]
I got a couple runners and they don't make beef
I got a full team and all we do is play street
Mookin' Playboy, choppers on deck and we keep a party packed for the papas on deck
Then I hit my nigga Gucci and partner OJ
They got some niggas at the four-way movin' four ways

[Hook∶ Nicki Minaj (Gucci Mane)]
Birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds (Okay J, jail still nothin', huh?)
I was watchin' all the birds on Bouldercrest Street (Nicki!)
Watchin' all the birds go tweet, tweet, tweet (Gucci!)
Birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds
I was watchin' all the birds on Bouldercrest Street
Watchin' all the birds go tweet, tweet, tweet

[Verse 2∶ Gucci Mane]
Niggas on personal, more in person but I'm twerkin'
I'm o national, trafficking, call that networkin'
The bird chirpin', it's [?] past perfect
Like J Worthy I dropped twenty plus last Thursday
But I'm Wilt Chamberlain, [?] dancin' and dang-a-langs
Pie, squish, scraping, cooking kettles and bakeries
You hustlers lazy ass, blow your wages on marginals
Grey kush, white caine, pill color of cardinal
I blowed up, I'm blowin' up, no particles
Gucci Man's a trapper but that question's rhetorical
Go ask an oracle, better yet read an article
Fans use binoculars, Gucci sellin' tilapia
Twin choppiers, papias stand on top of ya
Helicopter transferrin' you to the top-a-rung
See I'm the author of [?] in charge of ya
While I burn a million my kitchen just like an Oscar nod

[Hook∶ Nicki Minaj]
Birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds
I was watchin' all the birds on Bouldercrest Street
Watchin' all the birds go tweet, tweet, tweet
Birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds, birds
I was watchin' all the birds on Bouldercrest Street
Watchin' all the birds go tweet, tweet, tweet

[Verse 3∶ OJ da Juiceman]
Thirsty zone, thirsty zone, a thousand a gram, bitch
Workin' on that boater cred, [?]
[?] shoe walkin' and my pinky ring big as shit
[?] bounce them spots, they all cram with them bricks
Stay down, stay down, trappin' at the bus stop
Runnin' ten cars, throwin' stacks like they hopscotch
Pensacola shorty, bomb and she bougie
Right hand turnin' and [?]
Million [?] a day, goddamn I trap stupid
VVS diamonds, make a little movie
Slap that bitch in brinx, got my trap ass movin'
[?], call that bitch the mueller
Young Drew Manning, I'm the big abuser
Thirty-four, thirty-four and still [?] used her
See-through pyrex, got my cookies [?]
Left wrist retarded dog, call my shit fruity
Seventy-two donks, same color as Rudy
Bitch pay her phone, got my traphouse boomin'
Birds, birds, birds, okay let's move it!
Birds, birds, birds, let's make a damn movie!
