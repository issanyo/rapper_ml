[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Got a choppa for the narcos
Sniper rifle with the goggles
I'll throw a nigga in the gulf of mexico
??? lo ago
Gotta fire arm on me now
I'm the type to gun a nigga down
Shoot you in the street like a dog
Bury you in the ground like a hound
Guwap don't fuck around
Kill a nigga ass out of town
Y'all fuck niggas talking out loud
But I don't hear you sayin' shit now
When the Mac 10 go like pow, pow!
I'ma hear a nigga say ow, ow!
And when his mama looking for him when the body not found
And the head in the lost and found
New Orleans voice, nigga what's around?
Got a 30 round clip, nigga what's a round?
Like a jersey nigga like what's up son?
But I'm a down south nigga with a big ol' gun
I'm on the west coast, me and snoop lion
If I'm lying nigga then I'm damn flying
Talking fly shit like forty water
Damn you got a pretty daughter
In the mid-west like ??
Sixteen year old girl, R Kelly virgin
But these little girls super clean and dirty
And a kid might think that its dish detergent
My niggas so trick they might frisk a person
My bullets so big might miss a person
Put a pistol on nigga like pitch perfect
Red shirt the same color as my Falcon Jersey


Got a choppa for the narcos
