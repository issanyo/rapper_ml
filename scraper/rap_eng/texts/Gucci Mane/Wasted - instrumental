Ha, ha, ha, ha

Ha, rock star lifestyle might don't make it
Living life high everyday click wasted
Sipping on purple stuff rolling up stanky
Wake up in the morning 10 clock dranking

Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender

I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck dis almond joy
Said she gotta stop sucking 'cause her jaw's sore

Gotta bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor
Party just popping up but now he rolling more
Rolled on, 3 pills now, he on 4 idk, why?
But that remy turned into a whore

Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got the 40 on my waist and it's off safety
'Bout 40 goons wit me and we all wasted
Only remy straight tonight dawg no chasing

Only click faded we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelet we white boy wasted
No shirt, fuck it unless your arms tatted
We slapping trunk disgusted the liquor

Keep wasting 285 east side me and Plies wasted
Racing seven big booty broads chasing spring break
50 thousand white girls shake it some dancing naked
But everyone wasted magic city Monday

Ball players wasted this one for yo' uncle
Drinking Thunderbird wasted 12 pack wasted
I need more cases and Gucci not a racist
All my diamonds Caucasians
