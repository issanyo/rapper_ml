Crazy Mane, with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?

HOLIDAY SEASON!

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
? ain't a thang, call me Gucci Mane
I got these bitches taking pictures of my candy chain
I'm just a rich, wealthy nigga, kind of weird and strange
But I stay dead fly like a private plane
If you don't know about the ki, then I must explain
Everything that I got, owe it to cocaine
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussein
I'm fire: propane, I'm a boiling flame
I came, I conquered, I did my thang
Dropped my chain, then I changed the game
Two dames on the train, got that English brain
Cause my money real long like a Marta train

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Gucci Guwop up in the drop playing 2Pac
Taking 2 shots of Ciroc, then drop some ?
Taking me some blocks off the top, I gotta re-rock
42 grand in my pants, now that's a Teton
The hustler don't stop on my block
They sell sheet rock
Kick you square dead in your ass until you kick rocks
Gram after gram, yes I am, I got a weed spot
Last couple days it been hotter than a teapot
Way to make bills off the deal, I got the fig out
Niggas got mills on the deal, I pulled the Sig out
Half of a bill off this shit, then I'm a nigga
Count all my money with my chain, then we gon pig

[Hook]
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane]
It's the crazy Mane with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
I dunn camouflaged the flow so it's pure ?
Got a deal for the labor, so it's more to gain
I am so untame, y'all niggas are lame
Treat your bitches like a whore, treat em all the same
You gon take her to the store, by the bitch a ring
She gon beg me for some more, want a catchy drank
60 grand in my pocket, that's a drop-top Stang
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?
I'mma shave it off the top, get some extra caine
If you ain't getting money, you should be ashamed!
