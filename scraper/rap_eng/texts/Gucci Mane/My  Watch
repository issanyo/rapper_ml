(Intro: SB talking)
I ain't gone lie, sometimes when I look at this watch
I don't know what time it is... Real talk
I remember one time I was on the elevator
This old white lady looked at me and said, "Oh that looks like a disco ball on your wrist, are you a rapper"
I said "No, bitch!"

(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
Let me set the record straight, let me set the record straight
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion

(Verse 1: SB)
You know them haters got them lasers that will stop a star
It's cause my neck is flicking/flashing like a copper car
Shamballa balls 'round my neck, that’s my newest
Plus they dancing on you bitches, footloose
(Woot, woot, woot, woot, woot)
But I ain’t stopping pig
Ya' head’s out of whack, just like a bad wig
Plus I’m eating good, I guess I got the itis
And you washed up... arthritis
I’m in the strip club with the big meat salami
And I don’t make it rain, it’s a SB tsunami
I’m at the top, never gonna fall off
Hair club for men cause they know a nigga ball hard
And all the hoes love me
They want my semen
My watches mad at me, my diamonds always screamin'

I’m driving,texting, rolling blunts up at the same time
Po-po pulled me over, they ain't got the sense to pay me mind

(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
Let me set the record straight, let me set the record straight
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Let me set the record straight, let me set the record straight
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Jumping out the phantom, jumping out the phantom
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Let me set the record straight, let me set the record straight
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion

(Verse 2: SB)
You ain’t gotta wonder if the SB piece is real or fake
Yeah the chain, it cost a house and yeah we call that real estate
Look into my backyard see the pool and then we see the lake
Blonde playboy bunnies they just suntanning with roller skates
And we painting pictures of some shit you haven’t done this late
Wine glasses in the air, we toast to that, we toasting grapes
And I don’t fight I just rather let the goons talk
I see you coons hustle backwards, moon walk
Shaking my head, just let a nigga live
You know a nigga got bars, but fuck a bid
I’m up front, you in the back, do the adlibs
I keep this motherfucker swaying like a bad bridge
Killers 'round the block so you can't touch the kid
I use condoms 'round the clock, sorry kids

(Bridge: SB talking)
I don’t see a lot of you niggas, you know what I’m saying?
You can get laser eye surgery, you can have the thickest bifocals on the planet
And you still can’t see me nigga, you know what I’m saying?
My worst day is your mother’s best day
Owwwwwww

(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
Let me set the record straight, let me set the record straight
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Let me set the record straight, let me set the record straight
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Jumping out the phantom, jumping out the phantom
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Let me set the record straight, let me set the record straight
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion

(Outro: SB talking)
Yeah, so that’s how that one ended up
But like I was saying
A lot of people like to always be pulling that humble card on niggas
You know a nigga compliment a nigga
And then they just smile, then kinda don't say nothin'
Nigga you look at my shit and say my shit nice...
Nigga I'm telling you the price...
50K for this, 80K for that, 100 for this nigga
Get your wait up, bitch
Black out on the beat, bitch
