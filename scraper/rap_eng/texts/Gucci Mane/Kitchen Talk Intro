[Intro]
Stepped up my gang first
Stepped up my chain next
Took off that bullshit
Bought me a Rolex
DJ Tell
Iced out my homeboys
Iced out my main bitch
Been 'bout this trap shit
Ice in the grill the brightest
New age, you know what I'm sayin', that's the thing, that's what everyone's doin'
You gotta have a whip, you gotta have a house
Young, rich, black boy with talent
Gucci Mane, brick man, God damnit
Any beef come to me, I handle it
Gucci hot and they can't stand it
Drop tops, all ice we got
Hundred dollar rocks-
