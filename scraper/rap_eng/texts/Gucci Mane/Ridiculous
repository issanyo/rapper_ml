[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Ridiculous, it's hilarious how yo' girl is starin', kid
All the flows I carry stickin'
It ain't no comparison, the clarity is excellent
Breitling cost ya budget, bitch, that's why a nigga flexin' it
Could've bought a mini mansion, but I bought a necklace
Could've bought a Bentley, but instead I bought a Chevrolet
Donk is sittin' ridiculous, think I'm hittin' switches, bitch
Nah, them ain't no switches, bitches chrome liftes 26's
Trap house with 'bout twenty kitchens
Twenty chickens, twenty minutes
Twenty chickens, twenty minutes
I'mma scratch out every penny
Two will make a three and that one will bring an extra twenty
I was gettin' it, I admit it, but right now I'm extra gettin' it
MVP is my statistic, I just scored a triple double
Coke and kush and ecstasy, my trap is guaranteed to bubble
MVP is my statistic, I just scored a triple double
Coke and kush and ecstasy, my trap is guaranteed to bubble

[Hook: Gucci Mane & (Yo Gotti)]
150 grand on both wrists, this shit ridiculous
Rims cost a whole chicken, this shit ridiculous
Chain cost a whole ticket, this shit ridiculous
Hummer truck on thirty inches, this shit ridiculous
(Sixteen for a whole chicken, this shit ridiculous
Powder 'round the whole kitchen, this shit ridiculous
Watch ya mouth cause the FEDS listenin', this shit ridiculous
Watch ya boy cause that nigga snitchin', this shit ridiculous)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
New Benz, that bitch ridiculous
Vitamin Water paint job and I ain't 50 Cent
Big bird, yellow D's, no Sesame Street
Cookie Monster of the hood cause I love to eat
Ridiculous watch, ridiculous chain
Ridiculous bitch cause she got ridiculous brain
She ridiculous thick, I don't remember her name
Ridiculous dog got to treat these hoes the same
I'll take 'em to Lennox, I might buy her a purse
She gon' fuck all my niggas, she gon' ride with that work
Ridiculous whip, ridiculous crib
Ridiculous life, that's just the way that I live
You a hater, dick in the ass taker (ugh!)
Fake ass gangsta with a fake ass Jacob
Mascara, nigga, look at the shit you make up
Cocaine cowboy, look at this shit I shake-up
