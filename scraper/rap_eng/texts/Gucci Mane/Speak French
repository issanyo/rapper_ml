Ooh baby, I like kissin' you
Ooh baby, I like kissin'

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

Parlez-vous francais?
That's not the language I speak
But your body got me sayin' some things
That people in France don't speak

Take the elevator up to the 22nd level
That's where you meet me, babe
Girl, when you get up to the 22nd level
That's when the violin play

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

Shawty, go dumb I run her good [Incomprehensible]
Give her she got wisdom
I took my diamond off my pinky put it on her thumb
Now she can't close her mouth and when she smile
Bright as the sun

Lip service, room service
I walk in the club husbands get nervous
I don't mean to diss but I don't like to kiss
But you so fuckin' fine I took that rule off my list

She walked in kissed the hottest rapper on his lips
I took a picture of my dick and sent it as a gift
Jamie the entertainer, Gucci the idiot
She came to the house start kissin' it immediate

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

As a matter of fact I got a better sensation
If you let me do that I got a stronger rotation
'Cause so many guys ruin the pleasant surprise

Take the elevator up to the 22nd level
That's where you meet me, babe
Girl, when you get up to the 22nd level
That's when the violin play

Watchin' you go up the staircase
Got me imaginin' some of the craziest ideas
Of you and me makin' love

Girl somethin' on your mind
But you ain't gotta say it
There's a chance you wanna take
And you gon' have to take it

And there's a blueprint to a girl
For she standin' naked
Damn you naked, you standin' naked
And damn there somethin' crazy about the way you say that

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

Only red roses for you, baby
And only white roses for you, baby

But I gotta keep it ghetto
Gotta keep my girl in stilettos
While she sittin' here singin' this demo
Sing it, sing it, parlez-vous francais?

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down
