“B2L” ft. Gucci Mane

Verse
Hold it together that's what they tell me
Lean in my cup but it's still empty
Bibles won't help you that's what they say now
Im looking for something to keep this drink down

Pre
I been holding on too long
I been tryna' find my soul
Feel the pressure in my bones and I'm starting to let go

Chorus
And it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Oh it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life

Verse
My Girlfriend just left she said she movin' on She told me that lately she ain't been feeling whole
She probably somewhere getting turnt out And I'm countin' bills, I guess it worked out

Pre
I been holding on too long
I been tryna' find my soul
Feel the pressure in my bones and I'm starting to let go

Chorus
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Woo hoo oh
Woo hoo oh
Woo hoo oh (it's Gucci)
Woo hoo oh

Gucci Mane Verse
When they let me out the feds I watched the whole world panic
Buying teflon headgear and teflon jackets  Buying bulletproof vest and some bulletproof khakis
And all you pussy ass rappers bought some bulletproof panties
I had robbed so many people I couldn't even pin point it
When they shot my truck up
Cause I'm my hood’s most wanted
Critics say I only rap about money, clothes, ice
But if I rapped about my life I would probably get life

Marko Penn
Yea it feels like I coming back to life, back to life

Gucci Mane
But right now it feels like I came back to life
If it all goes bad I'm going back to white

Chorus
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Woo hoo oh
Woo hoo oh
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Woo hoo oh (it's Gucci)
Woo hoo oh
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
Yeah it feels like I'm coming back to life, back to life
