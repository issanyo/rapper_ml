[Intro]
Huh, bur
It's Gucci

[Verse 1]
[?] at my fortress
My bitch had an abortion
Voices in my head saying buy more Rolls Royces
Drop top Porsches
Offset portrait
Riding red Bentley red
Robbing in my black tee and now I'm tricking in my Louis shots
2 bricks and I bought her, when she lying I made her shit it out
[?] jury can't even get it out
Gucci Mane, Tom Petty
12 Ferraris, wanna rent 'em out
And no I can not dance like Omarion
But I'm standing ten toes with the tommy gun
Make a nigga call Louis his whole crew up
Ain't gon' stop shooting til the whole clip is done

[Hook x2]
My young niggas tote cakes for me
My young niggas gon' spray for me
Hope you don't disagree with me
Cuz my young nigga gon' shoot for me

My young niggas tote cakes for me
My young niggas gon' spray for me
Hope you niggas agree with me
Cuz my young nigga gon' shoot for me
