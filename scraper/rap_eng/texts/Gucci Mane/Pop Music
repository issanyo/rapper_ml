Gucci (Gucci, Gucci, Gucci)

Gucci (Gucci, Gucci, Gucci)

[Hook]
I'm hearing rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible Rari they call me Drop Gucci
Rappers having conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music

[Verse 1]
The studio in the house, so we making house music
Come ride with me through the six and see how the South do it
Cause I got old 'anna, but I'm on old Candler
But I'm so East Atlanta, still got all my old hammers
Take my .44 handle, shot through the door panel
Fuck all that rap beef, let's have a gun battle

[Hook]
I'm hearing rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible Rari they call me Drop Gucci
Rappers having conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music

[Verse 2]
I think it's funny how y'all think cause y'all don't really know
These niggas acting like they ballin' but they really broke
The trap God, I make it rain and I make it snow
I use my money as a blanket, it was bitter cold
In Buckhead in a drop head, pulled me over Lenox Road
Versace slippers with the matching sunglasses and robe
I bulletproofed the sprinter cause I got a hundred foes
I spent a million, so how the fuck am I not gonna get parole?
I feel like Lester Coke
Cause I don't touch the dope
You feel like Lester man
You took the oath and told the folks (snitches)
Don't think that I don't know they wish I was on death row
But imagine how these crackers feel that I moved next door

[Hook]
I'm hearing rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible Rari they call me Drop Gucci
Rappers having conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music

[Outro]
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
