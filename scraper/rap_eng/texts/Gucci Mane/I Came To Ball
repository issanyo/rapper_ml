[Hook]
I just came to ball ya'll (Guwop Guwop)
I just came to ball ya'll (Brr Brr)
To have a ball but I got more than all ya'll, all ya'll, all ya'll
Let's have a ball but I got more than all ya'll

[Verse 1]
Black your AMEX
I drop ashes on [?]
These pants came from paris, yo-yo boyfriend embarrassed
She felt the fabric, she married
I'm in Versace, niggas pocket watchin', they starin'
And I'mma step up on fashion
Got these three months in advance
Feel the fabric I'm wearing, these pants I got come from Paris
I make your man feel embarrassed
I'm speakin' frank, I'm in France


[Hook]
I just came to ball ya'll
I just came to ball ya'll
To have a ball but I got more than all ya'll
Let's have a ball but I got more than all ya'll

[Verse 2]
Pour whole pint on her panties
Call that Strawberry molasses
She said Gucci you nasty, why you askin'
And who last last longer and cascade in a
These niggas hate see ya workin' they crack a smile when you hurtin'
They say you a different person cause your truck on some 30's
I tell em man I deserve it
This shit ain't worth nothing, I tell em Man I deserve it
This shit ain't worth nothing, I tell em Man I deserve it
Man I deserve it, I tell em man I deserve it
[Hook]
I just came to ball ya'll
I just came to ball ya'll
To have a ball but I got more than all ya'll
Let's have a ball but I got more than all ya'll
