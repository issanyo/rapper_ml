[Chorus:]
I just wanna be honest
Cause baby I don't want no problems
You know I already got a girl
Her name is money and she rule the world

[Verse 1:]
I’m in a Rolls Royce in a back seat
Pull up to the club I’m just one deep
Gets some gun play if a nigga jump me
Cause I’m a OG just like Bun B
RIP to Pimp, rest in peace
CEO Gucci call me Eazy fuckin E
Glock 40 in my ? Imma keep it G
Half a pound in my briefs cause I like to chief
I’m discreet but I serve u right in front the screet
And you a lie say the FBI is watchin’ me
I’m a MOB guy you think I come from Italy
I got a .458 and it’s Sicilian

[Chorus:]
Im totein’ round a couple
Two bad bitches
Thick muthafuka
I got cash wit me
Totein’ round a duffle
I got a strap w/ me
Tech with the muffler
Who wanna scrap with me
? ? muscle
I don’t tussle with these niggas
I’m a hustla
I got them bands on me
?
Gotta man up
It’s time for you to stand up
Run up ya bands wit me

[Verse 2:]
If yo girl chose the plug shes a real smart girl
You a scrub
Im a plug/ its a real cruel world
She’s a real cool girl
Blowin strong with the goons
Baddest bitch in the room but she wit a clique of wolves
Im sippin Ron’ with ?, fresher than ? a prong
Imma fuck her til she cum
Get her sprung
Hit the bong
She in love with my swag
I’m in love with her tongue
Fell in love with her esophagus,I swear i hit the bong
If I stood on all my money I’d be taller than Lebron
And my top keep droppin’ back just like the hairline on Lebron
Call me uncle when you see me cause I used to fuck your aunt
Had a threesome wit ya moms now you look just like my son

[Chorus]
