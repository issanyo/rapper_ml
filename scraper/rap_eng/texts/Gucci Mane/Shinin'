[Hook: Stuey Rock]
I just wanna ride
Roll up and get high
We ballin', ballin', ballin'
Got my niggas on the side
And we gon' buy the mall out
And we gon' bring them cars out
And we gon' keep on shinin'
Bring the stars out
We shinin'!
That money, money, money, money
We shinin'!
That money, money, money, money
We shinin'!
That money, money, money, money
We shinin'!
That money, money, money, money

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
Big Gucci, and you know I like to shine a lot
So standin' close to me you'll need some sunblock
It gets really lonely when you're at the top
You haters look so small from the view, from the top
VVS's see through diamonds, so they're transparent (BURR!)
I'm all about them grands, like a grandparent
Gucci I'm the treasurer, embezzler
Two diamonds on my mothafuckin' bezzler

[Hook: Stuey Rock]
I just wanna ride
Roll up and get high
We ballin', ballin', ballin'
Got my niggas on the side
And we gon' buy the mall out
And we gon' bring them cars out
And we gon' keep on shinin'
Bring the stars out
We shinin'!
That money, money, money, money
We shinin'!
That money, money, money, money
We shinin'!
That money, money, money, money
We shinin'!
That money, money, money, money
