[Hook 1: Miguel]
I hope she don't think
That I think that she some kind of ho
Cause I don't care еhat just let me know
That she knows what she wants, yeah
Baby I won't judge, now I'm sure that
She knows what she wants, yeah

[Verse 1: Jhene]
Had me at "Hello, my name is"
Chose him before he could say it
I can't help feeling like he need it
"You know I'm usually shy"
I be lyin', I'm just tryin'
Not to come too strong but I am
I can't front, I see potential
And if he say so, I won't say no
Don't be scared of my aggression
Just don't get the wrong impression

[Hook 1: Miguel]
I hope she don't think
That I think that she some kind of ho
Cause I don't care еhat just let me know
That she knows what she wants, yeah
Baby I won't judge, now I'm sure that
She knows what she wants, yeah

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Hey girl, say girl, ain't no time to play girl
Now hurry up and touch her and tell her I want that girl
Yeah, they call me Gucci, but I'mma buy you Louie
Yellow stones on my wrist remind me of a slushie
Girl so fine, wanna ride me like a Huffy
Ugly girls quiet, pretty girls riot
Country girls, city girls love to floss diamonds
Got her in the bed with the kid straight wildin'
Took her to the club bought her three Long Islands
She from Rhode Island, Atlanta I reside in
Big black diamond bigger than a black razor
Asian, black, caucasian, I'm blazing

[Hook 2: Jhene]
After all, I just hope he don't think
That I'm some kind of ho, I don't know
He just makes me feel like
He knows what he wants, yeah
I would take it slow
But he makes me feel like
He knows what he wants, yeah

[Bridge: Jhene]
I be on my bold shit
I be on some bold shit, I be on my own shit
He know he be needin' it and he know that I want it
He know that I want, he know, he know that I want
I be, I be on my bold shit, I be some bold shit
I be on my own shit but I ain't on that bullshit
He know he be needin' it and he know that I want it
He know that I want it but I ain't on that ho shit
