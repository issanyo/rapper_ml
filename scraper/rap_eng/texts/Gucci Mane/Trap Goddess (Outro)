[Intro]
We can rent out Crustaceans, take vacations
Fly to Bora Bora they'll call you Dora the Explorer

[Verse]
Sippin' syrup just came from Europe tell that bitch she need to chill
She bicurious all the drugs make it hard to take me serious
Baby get your ass right here so I can kiss you on your ear
Tell her that burr burr burr burr burr burr burr is in here
I'm a multi-millionaire, they call me Gucci Mane LaFlare
Go to Vegas I'll meet you there and this is more than an affair
Hope them hoes don't interfere, hope they don't get in your ear
Pussy perfect that pussy tight like she a virgin
Crazy she sat that fat ass down and started to service
She only rolled up on us because she's Mrs. Perfect
Aye ho watch your mouth I tote that blammer, we in public
If you disrespect and touch that I'mma up it it get ugly
Gucci is who he say ok roll every day roll yayo ayo
Me had done my bitch a halo, then they go to Venezuelo
Had to rub my hands Jamaica smoking like a Winnebago
In Morocco, Acapulco, Gucci Scarface call me Al Capone, yo (Go off)
