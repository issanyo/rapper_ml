Zaytoven
Zaytoven on the track
Gucci!

They call me Chef Boy R-D
But hold that thought
It's a Kodak moment
The way I hold that fork
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Pockets Piggly Wiggly
Can't Kermit The Frog dawg

Early in the mornin' I ain't even yawnin'
I'm cookin' up a cake like I'm doin' a performance
When it comes to flossin' I ain't even talkin
Davins on my dunk got my Chevy moonwalkin'
