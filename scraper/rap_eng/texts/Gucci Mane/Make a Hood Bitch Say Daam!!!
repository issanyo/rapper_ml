[Chorus: x2]
Da way my wrist gliss I make a hood bitch say dam
My necklace rubbers n da fact I go ham
It's lonley up here man I need 2 cum down
So many 0's I made da bank teller past out

[Verse:]
My traphouse floor lookin like a magic city monday(monday)
But ain't no singles. jus big head hundreds(hundreds)
My car is gettin washed by dis ugly ass junkie
I keep laughin like a woman but it ain't shit funny(naw)
I'm posted n da trap n my country boys is cummin
I'm hood rich bitch still servin 2 dummies
I'm gittin on yo nerves cause gucci got money
Da charms are observe but da rims are a shame!

[Chorus: x2]
Da way my wrist gliss I make a hood bitch say daam
My necklace rubbers n da fact I go ham
It's lonley up here man I need 2 cum down
So many 0's I make the bank teller past out
