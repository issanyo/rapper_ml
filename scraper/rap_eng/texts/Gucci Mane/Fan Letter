I dropped my 1st album Traphouse ten years ago May 2005 I remember being proud and angry the day it was released.
I was proud of the work I put in and the quality of the project but I was angry that someone had to be killed over a dispute about the rights to some of the contents of the album.
10 years later I reflect on how that day impacted my life and my legacy and I am grateful for all the fans that supported me then and still support me now.
Every challenge and obstacle in my life has helped me to become who I am today and provided me with the tests to display my resilience.
I hope my life showed someone somewhere that if you endure the storm you will eventually get your chance to shine.
I never give up and I have grown and learned so much and still am eager to learn more.
I look forward to showing the world how much I have grown and getting out and helping my community.
I have been blessed with the opportunity to be a recording artist and help others get their chance to be heard.
To my fans I love you all and I want you all to know I am motivated and will not let my past decide my future.
I chose to not focus my attention on my negativities but on my dreams.
I will keep on hurdling and keep on hustling. My liabilties I turn to assets and even my inconsistincies make me the unique person I am.
I am focused and I will be returning soon very soon so get ready.
If I had to change anything in the last 10 years I would not change one thing.
Sincerely Guwop!
