[hook - Gucci Mane]
You got them birds, I want a few. First I'ma drop a deuce
Homeboy want 12, I want 30 boy that's 42
Call that pack that James Worthy, Zone 6 Julius Erving
Set my dunk on Julius Erving, Flying through the 6 like George Gervin

[verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
You see the feet on the fleet, like cleats on a athlete
Tell em paper tag me
Damn that thing look nasty, damn this thing a classic
Everybody starin'
Pull up in a Chevy, put yo Cutlass in a casket
Simple dunk can't catch me
On Davin's twistin' backwards
Candy painted 6's like the rims just did a back flip
My rims just did a back flip
The lips on my rims so big they fucked 'round and did a front flip
The way I got my dunk built -
Way I got the motor built, punch it then the front lift
Wammin' at the light, pimp
Slammin at the light symbol
Pull up in a white dunk, white guts, white rims

[Verse 2 - Yo Gotti]
'73 Chevy, but it look like a dump truck
Trunk like a concert - that mean that bitch loud as fuck
Everything kitted up, that boy digital
Hundred thousand dollars in the Chevy, that was pitiful
Hardwood floors in that bitch, look like my grandma house
White on white leather, my seats remind me of my grandma's couch
Trunk having a heart attack, rims doin' a somersault
Micheal Jackson 26 inches, they doin the moonwalk
Sunday I ain't bumping no rap, I'm bumping Al Green
Monday I ain't selling no white, I'm sellin' all green
Yo Gotti, I'm the King
No sooner than I hit the scene
I'm watchin colors, and then I watch my plasma screen
