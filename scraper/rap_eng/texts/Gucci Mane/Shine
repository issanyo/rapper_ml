[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
I'm gon' shine you know I'm gunna shine
Woah!
Flock
What Up Bro?
I'm not from this place (No way)
Outer space
You're ice-less
I'm icy
I fuck a lot of bitches
Wifeless

[Hook: Waka Flocka & Young Thug]
Fresh up out the hole
Just to let you know
Ain't no stoppin' me shawty Im gon' shine
I'm gon' shine
Fresh up out the hole
Ain't no stoppin' me, shawty just to let you know
Boy Im gon' shine

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Every chance I get
With my youngins' on the block
One day go legit
I remember trappin' on the block for a new outfit
Just to hit the club on Fridays
Cuz my momma say I gotta change my ways
But I can't, gotta shine
Check yo clock boy it's my time
I was told you can't eat if you don't grind
I said bitch smell that? Thats hard times
So much shit up on my mind
My hard drive is a gold mine
My waist line is a Glock nine
That bitch stick to me like tattoos
Doubted all my life
Fuck your attitude
You should be glad at me
For all the shit I did
And the lives I saved
Showed niggas new ways
Bow ya head
Lift ya glasses let's celebrate

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Red Flag in his pocket cuz' the young nigga turfing'
If you ain't gettin' no money then these bitches feel ya worthless
Oh you a live wire? Then I'ma make you short circuit
These clown ass niggas need to go work in a circus
Million doller nigga but I still eat Church's
You try me in this Church's then my body start burstin'
He died in his Boosy, momma feel he didn't deserve it
Box cutter in my pocket
I'll carve your ass up like a turkey
Put that on my squad, I ain't gon let no nigga hurt me
My gun do all my talking and I know you niggas heard me
Old school 'vet like I'm fuckin' James Worthy
But I'm shootin' from the corner like I'm fuckin' Bobby Hurly

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Yo bitch wanna top me up
Purple in my cup
[How you
Ridin' around on a bus
And I saved my life
Now I'm fatter my life has been wrong
Ain't never got robbed [?]
Oh yeah I remember them days I ain't have a dime
I'm dressed up in ferragamo
Forgetting them times living in that jungle
[When my ]
But now it's my turn
Nigga try to take something from me, get Usher burned

[Hook]
