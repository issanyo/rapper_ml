[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's a movie stage, let's make a movie, babe
I'ma have you bragging 'bout the Gucci Mane
I'm taking Polaroids, she taking poses for me
She flipped the game on me, all the roses for me

[Verse 2: Jason Caesar]
Who you know can get you wild like me? (Nobody, nobody, nobody)
And who can make you laugh and cry like me? (Nobody, nobody, nobody)
Girl, I know just how you like to do it
Pick the check out, I'll put you through it
Sex on the beach ain't no longer just a drink

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
Whatever you want
Girl, you can get it
In more than one way
It's just the beginning
Girl, I can take you, I can take you
Let me take you, let me take you
Girl, I can take you, I can take you
Let me take you
We can go anywhere

[Verse 3: Jason Caesar]
Who like me can make you lose control? (Who can make you lose control?)
Baby, who can stroke your body and your soul? (Can't nobody stroke you like me)
We be getting loose all in the movies
She don't care where we at, but she gon' do me
Shawty so spontaneous like me
I know that once ain't enough
This lifestyle, she loves
That's why mama stay with me
She likes fancy stuff, but she likes it rough
That's why she spending days with me

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
Whatever you want
Girl, you can get it
In more than one way
It's just the beginning
Girl, I can take you, I can take you
Let me take you, let me take you
Girl, I can take you, I can take you
Let me take you
We can go anywhere

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]
Lights, camera, action, sexual attraction
You can get it, baby girl, you don't gotta ask me
One night of passion, whole lot of smacking
Your man is a has-been, cut him like a fraction
Tell me what's the happening, we'll look like Alaskans (burr!)
Ice on me, I'm jumping out the Astons
I'm an East Atlantan, all my cars are fancy
Heels on, dress on, she ain't wearing panties
Her friends can't stand me 'cause they don't understand me
While they hoe-hopping, we be shopping in Miami
Gucci, Louis, Prada, it doesn't even matter
She drink out the glass, but I drink out the bottle

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
Whatever you want
Girl, you can get it
In more than one way
It's just the beginning
Girl, I can take you, I can take you
Let me take you, let me take you
Girl, I can take you, I can take you
Let me take you
We can go anywhere
