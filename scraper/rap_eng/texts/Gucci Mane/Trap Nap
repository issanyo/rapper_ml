[Chorus: Mello Tha Guddamann]
Trap nap, now I'm back at it
I'm addicted to the trap, I'm a trap addict
All I know is trap, I got a trap habit
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it
Trap nap, now I'm back at it
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it
All I know is trap, I got a trap habit
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it

[Verse 1: Mello Tha Guddamann]
I'm back at it, got the trap jumpin'
Since a baby, been in love with that cash money
Can't nobody out-trap me, I'm a trap junkie
You can't whip it like I whip it, you a crash dummy
No I ain't got no Snapchat
Absolutely no recording where I trap at
Unless we in the studio, and that's the Trap Execs
All my traps doin' numbers, check the trap stats, yeah
I'm always on the grind nigga
Playin' games, I ain't even got time nigga
Hating is a crime nigga
Mind your business, stay the fuck up out of mine nigga
I got what you need, I keep dough
Trapper of the year, yeah that's me ho
I don't ever sleep, I blink slow
That's a trap nap, bitch if you ain't know

[Chorus: Mello Tha Guddamann]
Trap nap, now I'm back at it
I'm addicted to the trap, I'm a trap addict
All I know is trap, I got a trap habit
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it
Trap nap, now I'm back at it
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it
All I know is trap, I got a trap habit
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I woke up lookin' like I sold fifty bricks
I lost a million on the Falcons but didn't miss the shit
Talk nasty to your chick 'cause I'm filthy rich
I had to text her baby daddy, come and get the bitch
Call me East Atlanta Santa, on my business shit
Put that Rolls Royce truck on my Christmas list
I try to make her snort it all, I need a Whitney bitch
I'm servin' so much lean, you'll lose your kidneys quick
I woke up in a Don then I jumped in a Wraith
Next time I piss in a cup I'm throwin' that shit in they face
I'm tryna run that money up while I'm still standing in place
I went to sleep in the A but I woke up in LA, it's Gucci

[Chorus: Mello Tha Guddamann]
Trap nap, now I'm back at it
I'm addicted to the trap, I'm a trap addict
All I know is trap, I got a trap habit
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it
Trap nap, now I'm back at it
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it
All I know is trap, I got a trap habit
Took a trap nap, now I'm back at it
