[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda!
Yeah
I'mma light this fireplace, you light some candles
If it get too hot, how much you think you can handle?
Make you melt like ice cream
Quiet as kept
If I take my hand up off your mouth, you might scream
Well I say let it out, holla like you Jane in the jungle
And let me climb that tower
Pulling on your hair like Rapunzel
Every now and then you like it rough
Sometimes you like it gentle
I just wanna make love all night
While we listen to the sounds of this instrumental
Treatin' your body like a cello, booty like hello
Jiggle like Jell-O
Love it whenever you get ghetto
When I leave your body smokin' like a cigarillo
This here for grown folk, let's do it all night
And let Bruno sing to you like

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Bruno Mars]
Tell me why your panties still on, girl
When Ginuwine's playing in the background
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I'm tryna tell it to you gently
We gon' do more than kick it like Jet Li
But you gon' cum before I do, don't stress me
Asking is it you? (is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, babe

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Bruno Mars]
Just jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
That's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
That's what I, that's what I
Sex by the fire at night (Sex by the fire)
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Bridge: Bruno Mars, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Gucci Mane]
If you say you want a good time
Well here I am baby, here I am baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind (What's on your mind)
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
Huh, Gucci, Bruno, Guwop
What you tryna do

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Bruno, let's go
It's Gucci Mane and Bruno
That's one dynamic duo
A lot of women want me
But I'm in love with you though
Your ex is unimportant
That boy can't even afford it
I drive so many foreigns
Baby I should be deported
Babe, I like the way you touch me
But love the way you f... me
Girl, ain't no need for frontin'
'Cause you're my type of woman
Wanna fly you out the country
To show you how I'm stuntin' (ya)
'Cause you got what I'm wanting
And I got all this money (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
