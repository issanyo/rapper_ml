[Verse 1]
Bricksquad bachelors, cook ups we get extras
Say that that's your bitch but nigga we didn't ask ya
Spent 10 million dollars on VVS'
Woke up in Texas, he text me, I start flexing
Diamonds chains sexy, my pistol is my best friend
I haven't killed in so many years, I get rusty
Hustling, my 40 keep budging in on the justice
These scary niggas calling the cops, but I ain t touched them
Finessed em, tricked them, left his ass on Simpson
Impress them, a victim, another lick hit successful
My weapon, FN, join if you wanna help it
And since you said you looking for Gucci, I'm on Gresham

[Hook]
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Work for couple mill, still I take some
24 hours, got the base running
Sale swag bad, I got freights coming
Sell you swag pack, take it back from you
Them diamonds round your wrist, cause you a lot of problems
You scared, you tuck your ice, cause you don't want no problems
These young niggas out here hungry, they say it s no more starving
Finessing juug season, everybody robbing
Don t trust me, cause I m from the streets
Going drug shoppin, cop a couple of keys
I finesse the plug, when we don't agree
Dummy bank rolls, send em over seas

[Hook]
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Ya'll niggas know how I move, y'all niggas know what it do
Versace frames on my face, I'm a 4 eyed fool
At Fountain Blue with your boo, paint mountain dew on my coupe
A quarter brick for the boots, at least a 4 and a deuce
You know I shoot through my jacket, you call the troops for your truce
Full metal jacket a savage, I put 3 mill on your crew
Throw a grenade in the room, watch all your partners kaboom
I'm a so icy tycoon, got 2 balloons in my Trues
Is you gon hoe up or blow up? Is you gonn grow up or throw up
Cause I got doja to roll up and I might pour us a 4
I can't drive a Corolla, roll around in a roller
That's a drop head Rolls Royce, y'all niggas act like you know us

[Hook]
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
