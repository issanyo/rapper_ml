[Intro]
It's Wizop
Burr burr burr burr

[Hook]
Tried to play me off the street but I'm back on the block
Drew down on your partner, made him drop it like it hot
My posse's on Broadway, I'm Sir Brix A Lot
Say some slick to Gucci, I hit you in your jaw
When a rapper got beef, want a pay-per-view [?]
I'm a trapper when I got beef then I put you in a box
That's the love of your life, to me she's just another thot
Not no ordinary nigga, can't rock no ordinary watch

[Verse 1]
Slick as hell man, I'm fresh out of jail man
Fuck a cell case, marble on my staircase
As you can tell man, I don't fuck with twelve man
Can't catch me in it man, unless I beat twelve man
These niggas trap dry, no water in the well man
We see your ribs man, damn you're lookin' frail man
Look at my ring bling, motherfucker chain gang
You're selling bales man, then we on the same thing
You're reppin' Zone 6, then we in the same gang
I let my nuts hang, why you holdin' nuts, lang
You ain't a rat so I'm gon' treat you like a mutt, man
You tuck your tail so I'm gon' kick you in your [?]

[Verse 2]
I'm a well man, a motherfuckin' well man
A pocket rocket on me and a pocket scale man
If I can't work, I've still got my clientele man
This for my [?], all my niggas still in jail man
All these critiques and AP's know they sick of me
Me and my niggas thick as thieves, [?]
Twenty years old, all my niggas got a brick at least
And this a drought and we ain't had no work for weeks
They call me Guwop One Punch, I knock out your teeth
I'm in a smoky [?] that I shoot out to tease
I pistol whip the sleep and go in your Lee Dungarees
Don't give a fuck about 'em, they don't give a fuck 'bout me

[Hook]
Tried to play me off the street but I'm back on the block

That's the love of your life, to me she's just another thot
Not no ordinary nigga, can't rock no ordinary watch

[Outro]
It's Gucci
It's Guwop
It's Wizop
