[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
New paint job, get you a new blow job
28, 36, I miss my blow job
I got it here, you get it back nigga thats your problem
Sound like a snow job
And you already know niggas won't starve
And you already know niggas gon' rob
Don't make me go and change the grill, get a nose job
You know I pedicure the wheels, get a toe job
Nigga I'm still spending twenties from my old job
You niggas get up off my dick, that's a ho's job
He said he want another one I told him no prob
He just bring the quarter back like Brett Favre

[Hook]
I said trappin ain't dead
This niggas just scared
Niggas just playin' they don't want no bread
Everybody in the game, say they trap like you
Well go against the grain, this is trap or die 2

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
See I'm bout to give you game nigga, no charge
Still broke after that, then that's your charge
Pulled up full of hoes, then that's my charger
Pulled over full of o's, that ain't my charger
A extra point 5 is what I could charge ya
Since you coming right back I'm thinking "Why bother?"
One thing about that girl, she a freak though
Good when she soft, better when she cheap though
You know Jizzle put the fork, put the pole in her
Go up in the sofa, pay a toll in her
And she go hard, and she go hard
T Pain and Kanye yea she go hard
And that blow hard, just like my flow hard
Concrete shit, I'm talkin floor hard
Nigga I been hiding 8balls in the backyard
Back when Ball and JG was coming out hard

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
We flipping the shipment and whipping again
I'm through with it once, we gon' cook it again
I'm trill to the end, never snitched on a friend
Pulled up in a Benz and I fronted him 10
I'm so subconsciously, copping the coca
My lingo bi-coastal la cosa nostra
Dominican thug, Dominican plug
Be shooting up drugs like Sammmy Sosa
My philosophy, Sun Valley my property
Gucci the czar, it's not a democracy
And if you don't like me? (gun shots) stops all animosity
Black T, black gloves,in my black Saab
I took some blow from your woe, call it black rob
And how I dodged that other charge, man I guess God
The same nigga moving caine out Econo Lodge
Im on an interracial date,twins, 2 pairs
And I'm a bachelor but I'm still in love with white squares

[Hook]
