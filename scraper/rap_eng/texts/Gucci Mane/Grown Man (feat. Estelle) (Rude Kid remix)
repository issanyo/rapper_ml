Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha

Now that im finally free
Im 'bout to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man (im a grown ass man)
Now that im finally free

I was lost but now im found
I was blind but now i see
Super high can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but god blessed me
Ever since jayvon's testimony
From a jail house, jumped in a Testarrosa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fucked up; im grown, i gotta blame myself
Streets taught me everything; i trained myself
Did wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
Then while i grew up like ---
Think every man's worth is in himself
Glad as well, but im mad as hell
Because my bestfriend probably gonna die in jail
No lie to tell
Probably cry like hell
Like my 2yearold, cause he got eighty years
Im goin hard, you see, i might as well
Cause i got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy dad
And my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So i stand today
Then get down and pray
That the second is now and my mind is made
I got a point to prove
And ima sign a raise
Can't make the same mistakes that my daddy made

Finally free
You'll never take me away
Took everything i had
For me to follow again
Now that im finally free
Im about to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man
Now that im finally free

Squash the beef, im free of that
This crazy song, i ain't feelin that
I guess they wanna see us kill each other
When im dead, who the fuck gon' help my mother?

I struggled and hustled too hard for this
I had to rob, steal, kill; i ain't proud of that
Smoke weed to appeal, so proud of Pat
Im show you to understand, where the cowards at?
Man my homeboy gone, where the flowers at?
All the money in the world can't bring that back
If i had one wish, wish my momma dear could come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and i believe in that
Off the strength of that, i ain't going back
So i put my whole family on my back
Got so much time, i can't pay that back
I was lost but now im found
I was blind but now i see
Super high can't touch the ground
Life tested me but God blessed me
Ever since jayvon's testimony
From a jail house, jumped in a Testarrosa
Had to find my self, then remind myself
Fucked up; im grown, i gotta blame myself

Finally free
You'll never take me away
Took everything i had
For me to follow again
Now that im finally free
Im about to do it again
I take my life with my hands
Cause im a grown ass man
Now that im finally free

I was lost but now im found
Thought that you couldn't keep me down
Single life, go round and round
I said i straightened up my ass
And i ain't never going back

Now that im finally free (finally free)
You'll never take me away (you'll never take me away)
Took everything i had (everything that i had)
For me to follow again (for me to follow again)
Now that im finally free (ohhhh finally free)
Im about to do it again (do it all again)
I take my life with my hands (i take my life with my hands)
Cause im a grown ass man (im a grown ass man)
Now that im finally free

Im a grown ass man
