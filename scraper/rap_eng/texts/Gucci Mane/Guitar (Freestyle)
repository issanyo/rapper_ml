[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, its Gucci
What's happenin', it's ya boy!
Pimp so hard, nigga
Pimp so hard
Swag up, nigga, boss up, nigga
Man up
Gucci Mane, La Flare, put your chin down

[Verse]
I don't do the push up I do the kush up
I'm booked up, look up "Gucci," overbook me
Shawty gone stupid, diamonds, look Cupid
Red diamond shawty, floor, just overdo it
Supersized watch, baby check out the bezel
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I'm ahead of the schedule
My Learjet flyin' G5, shawty
Red mic, and shawty, no Levis
Hi, I'm so fly, I'm DUI and I don't know why I drive
But, I'm suicide, my doors up like a Lamb
It's Gucci Mane, La Flare, call me gamblin' Sam
Fruit Loop, I'm Toucan Sam
Gucci Mane, I gives no damn
I'm fly as fuck 'cause I'm so kushed up
And I'm so drawn up, and I sip that lean
And I smoke that green, do you know what I mean?
Don't snort no white but I sell that shit
Man I got that Chanel, man them bricks exist
Right here in the 6, right there exit
You the exit, right there, I'm Zone 6
[?] got the seventy-four O's, I restarted it bitch
In the store, it's horrific, flow so horrific
I glorified it, sex and violence, man I supply it
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I'm a firebreathin' dragon
Your girl diggin' me, show to her clique I'm attractive
Gucci, nigga, boy I go crazy
My diamonds ain't clouded, they never been hazy
Shawty got a chain on, but it don't amaze me
You spent five grand, I spent one-eighty
Hey, pay me! Fuck you, pussy nigga, don't play me!
I don't give a damn 'cause I get money
I don't talk crazy, I just talk country and funky
Bunky, I be stitchy, stanky, stunky, skunky, bunky (Huh?)
Booster-ass bitch, you can get the fuck from 'round me
Gucci Mane, La Flare, you can sign here
