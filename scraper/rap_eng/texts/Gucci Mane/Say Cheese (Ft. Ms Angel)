[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Say cheese, the grill so brite, the picture can't be seen
The ice on my pinky, it got my pinky game green
These hoes on my dick, but bitch, please
No kissin or touchin, my whole clique stay clean
Say cheese, the grill so brite, the picture can't be seen
The Light hit me right, and now my trophys on gleem
You think I'm a trick, but bitch, please
No kissin or touchin, my whole clique stay clean

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Give me an avrage lookin trick, I'll turn that bitch to the bomb
Have her in and out the nail shop and beauty salonne
I'm breaken bread by the loaf, I drop a ?
Where we goin, ? chickens?
You a dime piece, so say cheese, let the world see your pretty teath
Your main squeeze, you can keep him, I'm your plan B
By natural problems, you can call me
And we can ball, hit the mall, and it's all free
I have you south beach fallen off a jetski
Or blowen purple on the shade from a palm tree
We in ? sippin?
The casino hoppin gamblin a hundred Gs
I play the craft table, you goin break the slot machine
Give me them didgets, we can kick it like a Socker team
I'll make your wrist freeze, your fingers gang green
I have you shining lke a shandalear brite?

Say cheese, the grill so brite, the picture can't be seen

Say cheese, the grill so brite, the picture can't be seen
The Light hit me right, and now my trophys on gleem
You think I'm a trick, but bitch, please
No kissin or touchin, my whole clique stay clean

[Verse 2: Miss Angel]
I'm a top notch Georja peach, jet beauty of the week
Face of a moddel, with the curves of a Coke bottle
Yeah, you grilled out, by the mouth, and yo game tight
You can take me out, but you gotta have yo bank right
Money over bustas, a dime stackin Benjamens
Play but I'm the hustla, just watch me put this ? in
Can you pay my rent? buy the bar, keep me iced out?
Purchis me a car, a credit card and a nice house?
I put this pu-nany on you, make you kick yo wife out
Got daddy devorced and mommy when I cut them lice out
Figure eight shape, ain't no frys with the shake
For a bankroll, I might jump out the cake
Break bread till the day your dead, if your scared, say your scared, but a closed mouth never get fed
Better stay down till you come up, grind till your knockin numbers
If you see me in the club, come and tip a bitch a hundred

Say cheese, the grill so brite, the picture can't be seen
The Light hit me right, and now my trophys on gleem

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
We gettin to the money now, we dead fresh everyday, never burnen out
We pullin up in bubbled up trucks, jumpin out
We throwin paper like a lil boy on a paper rout
We iced out, ice burg down, knockin round, streets from the cleaners
Ice burg sized stones, shining brite on our fingers
We? it up like Venous and her sister Serina
Chickens act like they never seen ?
We grilled out (grilled out!)
By the mouth (by the mouth!)
We goin shine brite, even when them lights out
My whole clique big ball, go and buy big shit
Big rims, big stones, big bottles of Crisp
Big picture this, the bracelets, the necklace, the ? out faces, of the rolexes
Zero to eighty six seconds in that new Lexis
Room servis bringin me, and yo bitch breakfast

Say cheese, the grill so brite, the picture can't be seen

These hoes on my dick, but bitch, please
No kissin or touchin, my whole clique stay clean
Say cheese, the grill so brite, the picture can't be seen
The Light hit me right, and now my trophys on gleem
You think I'm a trick, but bitch, please
No kissin or touchin, my whole clique stay clean
