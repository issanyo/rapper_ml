I got a Robin jean saggin', and I ain't even braggin'
I gave the bitch five hundred, fuck it I ain't even cryin'
Now I'm gettin' older rocking Gucci, Louis 'loafers
I still remember the first day that I ain't had to serve swoll
You brought sand to the beach, I brought toast to the source
I did ya girlfriend a autograph, Gucci Mane pose
It ain't no muthafuckin' secret, hell yeah I got shooters
I'm the plug to the plug, I'ma goddamn boost
You ain't no muthafuckin' gangsta, you's a goddamn moofer
And you gettin' in the way cause your homegirl choosin'
On my birthday Gucci want a brand new uzi
On my worst day I'm worth ten mill no jewlery

[Hook]
Killa's waitin' in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a gun and told 'em to fire yo ass up
Seems like everywhere you go somebody try ya ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck
Headshots [2x]
All my young niggas aiming headshots
Headshots [2x]
Put a dub on yo head
Headshots [2x]

[Rick Ross Verse:]
Yo son call you a dead beat
Stepped on my feet, nigga you dead meat
I'm grinding up this ground beef
I think they just wanna surround me
Self made with a brick too
Nigga shoes dirty but the stick new
Hittin' 12th grade with a big crew
Now I'm well paid I can flip you
Holding on my dick, Michael Corleone bitch
Headshot like Fredo, fuck nigga don't flintch
The empire back, the empire back
I got some whip out in foltin, my brick just keep boucin' back

[Hook]
Killa's waitin' in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a gun and told 'em to fire yo ass up
Seems like everywhere you go somebody try ya ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck
Headshots [2x]
All my young niggas aiming headshots
Headshots [2x]
Put a dub on yo head
Headshots [2x]

[Gucci Mane: Verse 2]
Nigga's got killed at my show last weekend
But how am I to blame when they were already beefin'
When they first started shootin' man, we were just leavin'
Try bricksquad and we won't let you get up that easy
Gucci Mane the C.E.O, I feel like eazy
The rap game love me but the dope game need me
Baby said she never seen a nigga so freezin'
These Vivi S diamond's make me feel like major
I had a pistol in the club first day I met Weezy
AR in the car the first day I met Jeezy
When I first started dissin nigga said it just teasin'
Glock 40 on my hip it was just me and mac breezy

[Hook]
Killa's waitin' in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a gun and told 'em to fire yo ass up
Seems like everywhere you go somebody try ya ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck
Headshots [2x]
All my young niggas aiming headshots
Headshots [2x]
Put a dub on yo head
Headshots [2x]
