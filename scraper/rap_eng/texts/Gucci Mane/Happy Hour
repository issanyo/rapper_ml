Joe
Gucci

It just hit me
I'm kinda tipsy
But it ain't to drink inside this glass
That's got this room spinning way too fast
Words are slurring
Vision blurry
Feels like I had more than a few
Under the influence of you
Yeah

Somebody better call me a cab
Take me straight to rehab
You got me addicted
And I don't wanna fix it

Happy hour
So intoxicated every time you smile
It's like wine
Happy hour
When [?] taste maybe I'm wasted
Get's me high
You're my happy hour

You got the buzzing
I can't stop now, girl, I'm loving
It was like we were alone in a crowded room
Don't want this night to end too soon
So baby, hit me
One more time, let's make history (I love you)
Excuse me if I shed too much
I can't help if you fill my cup

Somebody better call me a cab
Take me straight rehab
You got me addicted
And I don't wanna fix it

Happy hour
So intoxicated every time you smile
It's like wine
Happy hour
When [?] taste maybe I'm wasted
Get's me high (So high)
You're my happy hour

One more shot
Here we go, here we go
Throw it back
Here we go, here we go
Girl, I'm fading
You make me feel so good
(You're my happy hour)

Girl, if I'd write a book, you'd be my last chapter
Got me sad like when Joe said this was his last album
I ain't tryna flatter you but nothing else matter
Since she fuck, we'll go up that fucking [?]

They say the devil wears Prada well angels love Chanel
Well Lynden Lyman, roll with me, I'll keep you fresh as hell
I had your fingers on [?], Nick [?]
Our favorite pink, so I bought her a pink fur
Open the door for my lil' mama, I'm her chofer
I even buy you own [?] from the showroom floor
Like I'm addicted, give me something and I want more
You got me thinking 'what the hell I need a blander for?'
Oh man, a robbery, what the hell I need a trunk for?
We on a zebra work, so why I got [?] on our force
[?] with me, just drop your mouth and make a detour
'Cause if you're looking for a d-boy I'll be right here

Happy hour
So intoxicated every time you smile
It's like wine (It's like wine)
Happy hour
When [?] taste maybe I'm wasted
Get's me high (So high)
You're my...

One more shot
Here we go, here we go
Throw it back
Here we go, here we go
Girl, I'm fading
You make me feel so good
(You're my happy hour)
