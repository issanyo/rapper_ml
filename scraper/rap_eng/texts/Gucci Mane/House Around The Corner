Man I told these motherfuckers I was the last trapper man
The fuck these niggas talkin' about eh? Huh?
TCS trust gon first, nigga let's go

Now you could tell that I did this shit first hand
I paid for it, send it out and pray the work land
Soon as it touched the town I ain't servin' no weight, I'm bringing everything down
Got my pop 'round the corner in the building poppin' 4-12
I sold at least the breakin' dimes before 12
Made my bags bigger, they gave me more cents
I made at least a couple million off my dope bands
And I even put my trap in my bitch name
I put a little asteroid soon as the bricks came
Tryna find the love, I'm tryna find the plug
Ain't sure what I could do when it come to moving drugs

Fit for G, ounce of marijuana
Made a million dollars from that house around the corner
Stay strapped, party like a baller
Made a million dollars from that house around the corner

Fit for G, ounce of marijuana
Made a million dollars from that house around the corner
Stay strapped, party like a baller
Made a million dollars from that house around the corner

I ball in my Polos, don't ball in my Pumas
Gucci Mane look fab and I got some big cahunas
I'm a shockin' you with tuna and I just heard a rumor
Marooney white Jag callin' Oklahoma soon us
Gotta trap us round the corner til we spuzz in a dead end
Free rooms at today's inn, this song says I'm a legend
I got 2 piece, my 2 piece
I got twin tits and 3 vets
Half a mill in my cool net
And I do flicks where I glue bricks
Sell Vicodin, sell H pills
Sell Molly, sell Rufus
Tell Fish Scale I got Ninas, got 4's, got deuces
Got a lean spot that's exclusive
Got ounces pints and juices
Sell nick bad, sell zig-zag
Sell pipes lighters and looses

Fit for G, ounce of marijuana
Made a million dollars from that house around the corner
Stay strapped, party like a baller
Made a million dollars from that house around the corner

Fit for G, ounce of marijuana
Made a million dollars from that house around the corner
Stay strapped, party like a baller
Made a million dollars from that house around the corner
