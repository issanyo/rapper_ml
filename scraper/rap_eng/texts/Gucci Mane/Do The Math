Verse 1:
Kilos stacked up, Thirty's on my lack-truck
Re-up half a mil, Pills Imma vacuum seal
Gucci, Truly, Life of my movie
Woke up this morning bought an 08 dually
07 Charger SRT bitch
Sittin' on Ashanti's, Trunk just beatin'
Dubs just breathin', Old folks peekin'
Somebody bitch gettin' fucked this evening
Gucci got clugs, That's the slang in Cleveland
I'm so gangsta, He so corny
I'm so hood that ya bitch got horny
Cookin' up a brick 7:30 in the morning (It's Gucci)

[Hook]

Verse 2:
My vette burgandy, Hummer snow white
And I bought em same day, True story real light
See my right wrist ice me out like a bitch
I got so much money I can ice my clique
Put ice on the bitch, Put ice on my fists
See them diamonds on my rims, That's some million dollar slims
I'm a cocaine chef, and I love myself
Waiting on Gucci to fall off, Better hold your breathe
Cus the donk look clear, Malibu look stealth
Got so much money Imma ice my belt
See my donk look clear, Malibu look stealth
Got so much money, Imma ice my belt (Gucci)

Verse 3:
Call me Pizza Hut cus I sell a lot of pies
In the drought, I might get 23 of them guys
23 of them grams? That's a whole lot of mans
See my plug Afghanistan, Get my pills from Pakistan
Sold a lot of grams, Got them graham crackers man
Green and yellow donk, Its my Green Bay Packer Van
I don't understand, I don't really like the chicks
See I'm known in the 6 for selling all them fuckin' bricks (Gucci)
