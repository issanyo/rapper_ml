[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Secure the bag
It's a cold world, bundle up
You better protect the bag
Don't ever play yourself
Make sure that Y hit
Make sure that safe is safe
Key word, make sure
Brace yourself as I introduce you to The LOX
Secure the bag alert

[Hook: Infa-Red]
Secure the bag, secure the bag
You ain't never seen money like this nigga
Secure the bag, secure the bag
Never going broke long as I can sell dope nigga

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I'm just waiting for that coke to dry up
I need that first half 'fore I even 'post the flyer
It ain't nothing worse than dealing with these fake promoters
All these super cops that's out here tryna make they quota
As far as the pie, I need a slice and I'm good for the day
It's in my blood so I was naturally good with the yay
You can lose your life in the hood for a day
You know me, I count it twice then I put it away
Yeah, bring some woods and some vanillas through
We chain smoking, haze cookies and guerilla glue
Money right, they glad that it's pure
Nothing else matters as long as the bag is secure

[Hook: Infa-Red]
Secure the bag, secure the bag
You ain't never seen money like this nigga
Secure the bag, secure the bag
Selling dope you ain't buying with no broke nigga

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
My flow is strong so my money long, you can tell the way that I wear it
I ain't work this hard to give you my bread, fuck out of here I don't wanna hear it
My show's lit, I gots houses shit, I got more than sneaker money on me
I just stack my bread and use my head, you can ask the niggas that know me
But I pop for my bottom line, bang, and I don't even wear no flag
I just wait outside till you come home drunk just to secure that bag
Rubber grip on my Glock, shells all in my pump
I look good as shit but I'm an old head, who the fuck you talking to chump?
I got 10 bitches that's bad, so tell 'em why you mad
You broke as fuck and you watching me, nigga that ain't chasing no bag
Get on instagram and brag, you ain't never had jet lag
You ain't make it home and gotta leave back out just to secure that bag hah

[Hook: Infa-Red]
Secure the bag, secure the bag
You ain't never seen money like this nigga
Secure the bag, secure the bag
Never going broke long as I can sell dope nigga

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci Mane and D-Block and we really sell dope
But don't quote me bitch cause I might slit your damn throat
I'm like Scarface on a banana boat, I'm tryna stay afloat
And I won't never-ever-ever-ever-ever go broke
I take the good with the bad, I can even sell trash
I'm a magician with the chopper, I cut your body in half
I got balls made of brass, she got a basketball ass
And I gotta secure the bag, I got a 20 foot stash
And I'm laughing with the money bitch, she finer than me
The money that they think they getting, that ain't no money to me
I gotta shout out my connect, that shit was fronted to me
I had to run the money back, that shit was punted to me, Wop

[Hook: Infa-Red]
Secure the bag, secure the bag
You ain't never seen money like this nigga
Secure the bag, secure the bag
Selling dope you ain't buying with no broke nigga

[Verse 4: Styles P]
Bag coming, secure the shit
Caught a nice lick knocking off the purest shit
That Medellin on some tourist shit
Waiting for the plug to come just so I can score some shit
Jefe come, jefe go
Let my little esse know we gon' go hit Mexico
We gon' get this bag like it's gas, like it's Texaco
Got a stash house in BK, right on Meserole
JFK, bag landing
Laguardia, it's a bag landing
You can be the man but not the last standing
Niggas wild as Taliban, all my niggas blast scammers

[Hook: Infa-Red]
Secure the bag, secure the bag
You ain't never seen money like this nigga
Secure the bag, secure the bag
Never going broke long as I can sell dope nigga
