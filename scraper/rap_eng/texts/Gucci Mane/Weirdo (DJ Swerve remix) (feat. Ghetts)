CHORUS
Weirdo...Weirdo, Ima Weirdo(2x)
Killed da pussy, killed the bitch
Turned into a weirdo
Mr zone 6, half a million dollar ear lobe
Weirdo...Weirdo, Ima Weirdo(2x)
Gucci mane, drumma boy
Dis here for da weirdos
Had it like a bag a dro
Flowin like a weirdo

Verse 1
Shawty mad, mad for wut
Man cuz she can't get enough
Tough luck
Diggin Gucci mane and he dont give a fuck
Throw it up, Pick it up

You ain't got enough

And she asking weird questions
Why yo engine n da rear
Switchin gears den im outta here
You boyfriends so last year
Lets have breakfast on the moon
Lets have dinner on Uranus
I got Venus,on my penis
And Serena wrapped round my fingers
Lil mama wet as aquafina
Send dem hoes like Angelina

I like em yella
I like em red
I like to meet her
