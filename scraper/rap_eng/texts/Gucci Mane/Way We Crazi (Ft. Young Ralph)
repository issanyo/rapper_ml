[Hook: Gucci Mane]
We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall
This is just the way we craull
Candy painted cars on chroam
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Ralph with the bidnis, trap boy easy
Pint like beasty, blazed like chearch bisket
Rhims like didgets
Offset 6s
Cartier lenses, 20,000 dollar bridges
Came to the club, me and 3 or 4 bitches
8 or 9 bitches, shaudy and shaudy sisters
But now I'm so loaded, the junkies think I'm kidding
Paint so wet, like the K stop spittin
Rims real big, like Jay-Z lips
When I hit the bar, bring 3 or 4 clips
3 or 4 chicks, bet you I hit
Spent 12 racks, Gucci Mane the bank man

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall
This is just the way we craull
Candy painted cars on chroam
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

[Verse 2: Young Ralph]
I'm just a work dealer, I still play with work
Barney never round me, I still play with Perks
Stop verses, make calls whenever I ride in
Lamborghini doors up, just dive in
King sized place, still with bubble cush
And the seets in my car feel like a cushen
These niggas mad cause I took off
Bring myself up, and brushed that dirty look off
Yeah, I ball hard, and spend a lot of cheese
Young Ralph and Gucci Mane, that's a lot of cheese
Piss yello diamonds, they'll make you freeze
It's a weather change, bet my neck will make you sneeze

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall
This is just the way we craull
Candy painted cars on chroam
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

[Verse 3: Young Ralph and Gucci Mane]
Gucci rock the Gucci, Ralph rock the Luie
I can't even lie, the rimms get a lot of cucci
Ralph switched up with Gucci, and Gucci switched up with Prodda
Haters get ba-da, bitches get na-da

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
We leavin outside to kill m all
Me and my bad lil braud
Damb, ma, my stacks is tall
This is just the way we craull
Candy painted cars on chroam
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, we run for so long
Trap niggas got it goin on
