Please let me floss my jewellery, so much ice make your eye sight blurry
Jewellery, have on too much jewellery, never too much, never too much
So much jewellery, this ain't even half my jewellery
It's getting kind of cold in here, I'm serious, jewellery
Please let me rock my jewellery, everybody starring
Because we're rocking big jewellery

[Verse One]
Jewellery, people see me rock big jewellery, my jewellery talks for me
Baby, girl, don't you hear it, serious, this ain't even half my jewellery
Red diamond charm's on it's period, fear it, so many people
It's very very slight flaws in my necklace, put my dog on it
Put me on hard four seconds, tell my auntie to bring all my bracelets
New piece coming, it's gone hurt their faces, OJ flexing
With the blue and white Jacob, Jacob, how you think we got the boy a bank up
So Icey CEO is covered like make up, Gucci, uh

[Hook]
Please let me floss my jewellery, so much ice make your eye sight blurry
Jewellery, have on too much jewellery, never too much, never too much
So much jewellery, this ain't even half my jewellery
It's getting kind of cold in here, I'm serious, jewellery
Please let me rock my jewellery, everybody starring
Because we're rocking big jewellery

[Verse Two]
Say, Gucci Mane please can I have it or wear it, don't touch it
Baby, look, but don't grab it, flash it, Kodak moment, boo, careful, gaurd it
Hope she treat it like its important, rolling, I'll rush you for tailor
Little shorty, homie, over there, he's holding down a Glock 40, party
Everybody in here balling, blinging, everybody's chain in here's swinging
Hanging, damn I wish I had nine pinkies, twinkies, popping pills
And rolling up stinkies, this corner over here
Ain't nothing but iced out gangsters', iced out ears, chest, wrist and fingers'

[Bridge]
Fingers', why you think we holding our bangers', we're gangsters'
Why you think we're twisting our fingers'
Fingers', why you think we're holding our bangers', we're gangsters'
Why you think we're twisting our fingers', So Icey

[Verse Three]
Jewellery's brighter, Jacobs, mulers, my jewellers known to over do us
Florida's white diamonds and cutters', he's an arrogant motherfucker
If you swing this boy, you've got to hustle, cocaine's in the box
With the hammer and the muscle, three hundred thousand rubbers'
And the dresser, snitches', bitches, fakes and busters', ketchup diamonds
Yellow's mustard, got to rock jewellery box's, man
I've got a jewellery dresser, VPS rocks all in my bezzers', VPS rocks
All in her bank up, all black Jacob looks like a panther, when you're iced up
You can't talk to strangers, VPS rocks all in my fingers', I'm so iced out
I can't talk to strangers, So Icey
