[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I ride by, like a driver on a nigga
So fly, that his bitch might choose a nigga
Ask why, gives a fuck about that nigga
So high, we up on all you niggas
I ride by, like a driver on a nigga
So fly, that his bitch might choose a nigga
Ask why, gives a fuck about that nigga
So high, we up on all you niggas

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Cutting thru the traffic, limousine inspector gadget
'Rari taller than Bin Laden, Harvard scale by Fitzpatrick
Have you seen his backyard, butterscotch beauty pageant
If you think I ain't too famous, watch me cut you off like traffic
Lifestyles of rich and lavish, lavender elevator
Inside the codeine castle, watch your mouth, watch what you say
I'm ridin' on gray, i'm sitting sideways, the Chinese buffet
I'm Emily Olson, my chain's a fortune, my wrist look tight
I just dipped my hand, my ice, my pocket
I'm davy crocket, my arm's a rocket, on candy mustard, I'm sittin' on butter
I might pull up in east Kentucky, where the fuck is Jody Husky
I'm davy crocket, my arm's a rocket, on candy mustard, I'm sittin' on butter
I might pull up in east Kentucky, where the fuck is Jody Husky

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I ride by, like a driver on a nigga
So fly, that his bitch might choose a nigga
Ask why, gives a fuck about that nigga
So high, we up on all you niggas
I ride by, like a driver on a nigga
So fly, that his bitch might choose a nigga
Ask why, gives a fuck about that nigga
So high, we up on all you niggas

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Roll my ciabatta, don't talk about mañana
Need my shit today or Imma split you like piñata
I'm at war with these stars, smoking on Chewbacca
You all roll [?], wind breaker for that climate
All these diamonds in my mouth, make it hard for me to stay quiet
All these niggas with the drug talk, when they get caught, hope they keep tight
Nigga not no role model, but I like to roll with models
Smoking on that kush, while I'm counting up this au gratin
Lux living luxurious, my bitch is bicurious
Exuberant and foolish, I keep me a bitch clotheless

[Gucci Mane]
I ride by, like a driver on a nigga
So fly, that his bitch might choose a nigga
Ask why, gives a fuck about that nigga
So high, we up on all you niggas
I ride by, like a driver on a nigga
So fly, that his bitch might choose a nigga
Ask why, gives a fuck about that nigga
So high, we up on all you niggas
