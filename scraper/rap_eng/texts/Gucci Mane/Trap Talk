[Verse 1:]

Started out with blood money
50k in drugs on me
Drop chevy put thugs on me
Just pulled up in the club homey
We just put my thugs on it
Home boy getting his mug on
Hey I wanna get my buzz on
Fuck around Ill put my gloves on
Say no robbin' how I eat
B.c 32 thats my street
Brick Squad runners ten million deep
I'm trying to sell ten billion ki's
Fuck what a bitch boy say to me
AK n AR stay with' me
Mac 99 not far away my dogs don't even play with me
In my apartment 80 a piece
Stack a piece 80 g's
Old school donk parked right out front
Off set shots 73
You say he's a trapper please
I hang around with a gang of thieves
They prolly charge 200g's then sell your ass a sack a' leaves
Gucci mane fuck up the sound
Dead drunk like my uncle
Touch my brother, duke, and I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat
Gucci mane fuck up the sound
Dead drunk like my uncle
Touch my brother, duke, and I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat

[Hook:]

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran straight threw it
My numbers in my blow spot my trap house boomin' (Scur)
Talkin' trap talk (scur, scur)

Bitch I bet up with me talkin' trap talk (scur, scur)
I'm still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some many chops and Glock no need to keep the door locked
I'm talkin' trap talk
You chop it up with me talkin' trap talk

[Verse 2:]

55 white bricks fronted to me
23 thou' 5'hunit a piece
.357 sit on top of the seats
Plus a AR-15 ain't far from my reach
Got a house on flat Shoals sell nothin' but dro
Apartment on the crest were I get all the blow
Went from pan to performing a show
Now a 26 a shocks sit up unda the rows
A nigga thing he playin with me betta play with his noise
Put a hole in his chest bout the size of a commode
I got a j that swing my door n I pay him in dope
I got cutters on my team that snort, n' I pay them in coke I got cookers on my team that snort and I pay them in coke

[Hook:]

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran straight threw it
Doing numbers in my blow spot my trap house booming talkin' trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin' trap talk
Im still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some many chops and Glock no need to keep the door locked
Im talkin' trap talk
You chop it up with me talkin' trap talk

[Verse 3:]

Theres not no one in the game with more swagger than this
I can score with any ho with just the flick of my wrist
Diamonds sittin' on my finger cost ten brick of the snif
For this matchin' cartiers 20 bags of the pills
You can talk n say your sick but I ain't goin' legit
Try n' think of the newest murder gonna drop him again
Flow hotter than running water
Tattoo'ed up like travis barker
More swag than your baby father
Wrist colder than northern border
Lang gonna get you life in order
Squares don't get no liking on
Half my goons are thankin' slaughter
Fuck around find you stankin' partner
These diamonds In this bitch look like newvo on my fist
This shits with a twist so I keep a new bitch on my dick

[Hook:]

My cookers made a 50 pack I ran straight threw it
Doing numbers in my blow spot my trap house booming talkin' trap talk
Bitch I bet up with me talkin' trap talk
I'm still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Got some many chops and Glock no need to keep the door locked
I'm talkin' trap talk
You chop it up with me talkin' trap talk
