[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
When the fish tell it, out of Atlantic City
And a car that cost a half a millie
Trying to turn up too quick
This spilled drink on my dick
Bad bitch, on my right side, she flip it
Damn you got some pretty titties
And I love when she call Guwop big poppa
Cause we fucking all night like Kim and Peggy
Double cup of that candy
Got a quarter pound of that good keef
Pour the whole pint on her pussy
And now her pussy sticky
We just came back from Italy
And the feds said they want to convict me
But I'm feelin' like Big Meechy
'Cause I'm still gonna plea not guilty
See my girl she was keeping two C's on it
Her dollar card got two B's on it
Plus all my cars got Fs on 'em
But my lil boy's car got Es on it
Your CD ain't got nothing on it
Bought your CD just to roll weed on it
Your girl told me they ain't got nothin' on me
Fuck her 20 minutes now she nutted on me

I don't do Michael Jackson shit
Moonwalk 'cross the pot, that's stainless steel
That Pyrex ain't shit
Your pie get too hot
Fuck around and crack, you lose a quarter brick
We cook up out that stainless steel pot
Whip it and triple it
It's Guwop, Guwop
Pull up on your block in a drop top
If you don't know their face, oh no don't serve them
Money equals bricks, bricks equal murder
I know all the real niggas but you I never heard of
DMG, you know how I'm rockin'
A quarter ki'll leave your head topless
1017, you know how we rockin'
Countin' up checks with Flocka, Brick Squad Monopoly
