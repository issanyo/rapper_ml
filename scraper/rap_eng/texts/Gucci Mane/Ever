[Intro: Shawty Redd & Gucci Mane]
It's 2017 nigga
Welcome home 'wop, blurr
Shawty Redd, new bitch nigga, y'all niggas motherfuck' at?
Pyrex pot
East Atlanta, Zone 6
Trap house
Nigga where y'all think this shit started from, nigga
It's Gucci
Ay Guc', welcome home my nigga, I salute to you my nigga
Ay, hol' up

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Let me take you back to my Shawty Redd days
Just sold ten bales, pulled up to the club blazed
In an all-red Charger with some with some on-set trays
Hittin' on all-red kush, got on all-red J's
Got a trap house in the 6 with a 12-foot fence
I'm Guwop the walkin' lick but can't nobody take shit
Had to shut the trap down, the red Dolce's hit
Had to crack it back up, the red dogs ain't shit
See your pack just touched, everybody want bricks
So you can tell the black cats they can suck my dick
It's just a Sun Valley nigga, I'm had tryna get rich
I killed your dog yesterday, you can call me Mike Vick
Say you never met a killer, then you never met me
Hold up, hold up, they done let the 'wop free
Hold up, hold up, he say he want a hundred keys
Well pull up, pull up, none for you and more for me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gucci how you feel, like the richest nigga ever
Twenty-seventeen, still the slickest nigga ever
Ain't nobody in my lane, ain't nobody on my level
Leave the house without a strap, nigga never fuckin' ever
This a customized belt, so you would never fuckin' ever
Let a bitch stress me, I would never fuckin' ever
Let a nigga press me, I would never fuckin' ever
(It's Gucci!)
They say never say never but I never fuckin' ever
(It's Gucci!)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Don't go with my main squeeze, she ain't gotta fuck me
But bitch ain't never met a nigga that can hustle like me
And you'll never meet a nigga with a duffel like me
With the money and the mind and the muscle like me
I done rob so many niggas I can't even trust me
Gotta walk in with the strap, they can never search me
Call me Gucci the unmercable, they'll never merc me
I just bought a new convertible, they'll never touch me
I hate mice, I hate rats, nigga that's my pet peeve
I throw stacks, I shoot dice, nigga I'm so side street
If you ain't 'bout lettin' that pistol go, don't stand beside me
Said Guwop ain't got eight figures, I feel like you're tryin' me
'Wop

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gucci how you feel, like the richest nigga ever
Twenty-seventeen, still the slickest nigga ever
Ain't nobody in my lane, ain't nobody on my level
Leave the house without a strap, nigga never fuckin' ever
This a customized belt, so you would never fuckin' ever
Let a bitch stress me, I would never fuckin' ever
Let a nigga press me, I would never fuckin' ever
They say never say never but I never fuckin' ever
(It's Gucci!)
