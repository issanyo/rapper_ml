[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Ooh, yeah
MONY POWR RSPT, nigga
It's a money set, you know what I'm saying?
Everybody getting money, nigga
Yeah, Pablo Juan

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
The money go where I go
Smoking on gelato
Foreign car swerving, pothole
Bad bitch, she from Chicago
She freaky, she gon' bust it
She thick as fuck, I'm lusting
I got her from my cousin
So what? 'cause we don't love 'em
Fuck that, I wanna hit from the back
Backwood smoking, it's fat
Dressing like I got a sack
I pull up, jump out the back
Bad bitch and her ass fat
Four door coupe, it got a hatch
On the Xans, I might crash that

[Verse 1: MoneyatMidnight]
No we don't love em, no we don't love em
We don't do cuffin', we just be fuckin'
Tryna get the money, do the money dance
Touchdown, hop off jet, in France
100s stuffed all in my pants
I ball like I know I'm the man
I'm already rich cause I know I can
If you got no bands get off yo ass
Goin' to light up I'll have to pass
Ain't gone get me nowhere
Unlike the Bentley, yea you know it's tinted
Who cares right now if that shit is rented?
If you wanna hop in, yea but I ain't got time for no hoes
I gotta stick to the money code
I might just make some money with some hoes
Imma go splurge on clothes
Boy you cheesy like macaroni (cheese, Velveeta)
My uncle fishtailed no baloney
I'm glad he alright tho
I need diamonds that hit hard like they fight tho
Shout big Gucci and Pablo
Yea you know the money go where we go
We don't love em, we don't even fuck em
Do a show and go collect the money hoe
Let's get it

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
The money go where I go
Smoking on gelato
Foreign car swerving, pothole
Bad bitch, she from Chicago
She freaky, she gon' bust it
She thick as fuck, I'm lusting
I got her from my cousin
So what? 'cause we don't love 'em
Fuck that, I wanna hit from the back
Backwood smoking, it's fat
Dressing like I got a sack
I pull up, jump out the back
Bad bitch and her ass fat
Four door coupe, it got a hatch
On the Xans, I might crash that

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
If come ride it's tinted
Don't test the water chilly
My pinky a quarter ticket
Had to grind smart to get it
Limited 'sclusive edition
They waitin' in line to get it
Danny your time, I did it
I didn't get a dime, a visit
I been had the sauce, I'm drippin'
'Fore I had a pot to piss in
My car just lost the ceiling
My girl just lost her feeling
Gucci getting richer than richy
Bitches say Gucci saddity
She just did her ass and her titties
Well skeet on her face 'cause she pretty
I tell her, go'n, like the road runner
Might stash your phone number
Hoe get the wrong number
I'm stacking all winter
I'm stuntin' all summer
And I need a grown woman
'Cause I got grown money, Wop

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
The money go where I go
Smoking on gelato
Foreign car swerving, pothole
Bad bitch, she from Chicago
She freaky, she gon' bust it
She thick as fuck, I'm lusting
I got her from my cousin
So what? 'cause we don't love 'em
Fuck that, I wanna hit from the back
Backwood smoking, it's fat
Dressing like I got a sack
I pull up, jump out the back
Bad bitch and her ass fat
Four door coupe, it got a hatch
On the Xans, I might crash that
