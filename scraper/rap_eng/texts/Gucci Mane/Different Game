[Intro: Jackson Wang]
Yea, straight up
Yea okay

[Chorus: Jackson Wang]
I'mma show you it’s a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game (know it, yea)
I'mma show you it’s a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game
You can try to stop me, but I'm in a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up

You can try to stop me, but I'm in a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up

[Verse 1: Jackson Wang]
Mhmm flexing on it flexing on it, not them diamonds
Rich in my ambition
Balling we go all in
Call me China man
Team Wang made it Jackson Brand
Why you faking reputation buying profiles then
Mhmm ya
This a different game ye
Who would take the blame oh
Who do I respect society
Who do I suspect hey
I'll be flexing man
One man flexing land
Call me flexing trend
Call me one man band
Different game

[Verse 2: Jackson Wang]
I can see them coming through
I can feel it when I do
Stay a hundred flexing
Till I be the last man standing
I can see them coming through
I can feel it when I do
Stay a hundred flexing
Till I be the last man standing
Aye
Never go back in the days
Never get back in the maze
People gon trip in the race
Never gon keep up my pace
Never get back in the days
Never get back in the maze
Jackson

[Chorus: Jackson Wang, Gucci Mane]
I’mma show you it’s a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game (know it, yea)
I’mma show you it's a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game
You can try to stop me, but I'm in a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It’s a different game
You can try to stop me, but I'm in a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game (Jackson Wang, Gucci Mane)
Balling till I fall, yea yea
I'm the game

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Jackson Wang and I'm the Gucci Mane
Switch the lane I'm in a different game
I was selling game right off Biscayne
Pull up in a drop top and fuck her brain
Low down dirty game got a Balmain
Still pushing bells fuck the chain gang
Ain't nothing changed but the chain man
Big old diamond chain and it blang blang
Balling like Lamar, Jackson a duel threat
You just a freshman
You still ain't in the league yet
I be fresh to death I pull up make them upset
Diamonds on my chest make them tuck that, yea

[Chorus: Jackson Wang]
I'mma show you it's a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game (know it, yea)
I'mma show you it's a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game
You can try to stop me, but I'm in a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game
You can try to stop me, but I'm in a different game, yea
Hold up, straight up
It's a different game
Balling till I fall, yea yea
I'm the game
