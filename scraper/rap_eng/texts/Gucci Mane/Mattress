I got a hand choppa, a rifle by the stash right by my mattress
And they say an ugly duckling wish can make you more attractive
I got a hand choppa, a rifle by the stash right by my mattress
Never let a fat bitch ever sleep in my mattress
I got a hand choppa, a rifle by the stash right by my mattress
And they say an ugly duckling wish can make you more attractive
I got a hand choppa, a rifle by the stash right by my mattress
Never let a fat bitch ever sleep in my mattress

[Verse: P Street]

They went outside, found a hunnid bodies (hunnid bodies)
A hunnid shots, we do not miss
We control it good when the choppa start kickin like karate (karate)
They takin shots like the paparazzi (paparazzi)
