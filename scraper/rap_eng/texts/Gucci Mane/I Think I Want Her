X2

[Verse 1]
Yall ball when yall can but I stunt when I wanna
Your girlfriend wanna fuck me I think were gonna
Marijuana got my beamer foggy as a sauna
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare bitch im such a prima donna
I'm East Atlanta shawty but I hang where I wanna
Got a plug in Arizona but used to slang on the corner
Gotta chocolate nerdy lookin chick a ryder like wynona
Told her text my celly plenty when she come from california
You are not the owner of that car that is a loaner, I got money stacks as tall as you cuz that's just my persona
I got half a million on my neck come try me if you wanna
Keep a shooter wit a chopper turn you to a organ donor

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My flow so schizophrenic that I think I need a straightjacket
Straight drop dope flow put me in a crack baggie
Old school like a 1960 cadillac                                                                                      Real well known in every hood that's why these nigga's swagga jackin'
Not in my league nowhere close to my tax bracket
Brick squad charm bout the same size of a tennis racket
Thirty round tone in my jeans got my pants saggin
Let yo girlfriend give me becky now the bitch braggin, rims to the white chain to watch hat to the shoes matchin', since im Gucci Mane might as well buy her some new glasses, everybody still Lookin at me when my vette passing, brick squad ceo I guarentee the check cashes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Six stoves in my house and everybody cooking
Ferrari pass by damn everybody looking
A couple million dollars and im still straight crooked
You might had the game on hold but I took it
Im hoppin out the drop lambo like a kangaroo
Gucci brick squad ceo but tell me who the fuck is you
Like simon says yo' big sister do what I tell her to
I tape bricks underneath her tits and then I send her through
Milatary rifles you would think I was a ex-marine
Sk, street sweeper, mac 90 or m16
No im not a fighter or a lover I am just a shooter, so if you disrespect my squad I'mma have to shoot ya'
