[Hook: Frenchie]
If you think I'm done trappin', cause I made it rappin'
Basically this is something that you don't really know about me
A ghetto superstar, riding through the six
Middle fingers up, screaming Sun Valley
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
1470, on top of Sun Valley
Where a young nigga jumped off and started trapping
A nigga got killed last night, what happened?
Fucking with them double crossing bitches from the valley
Mountain Park apartments, everybody capping
Don't go to Triangle 'cause you might just get your ass kicked
Bottom of the hill shooting hoops, Sun Valley
Nigga wanna jump me and take my Starter jacket
13 years old but my big bruh packing
Let's just say they ain't take my Starter jacket
Flashback, '97, 5 dollar crap game, gambling in the store
Gusto, C-Note, Carlos, dameon and my nigga lil red
A's out, flash forward '08, million dollar crap game
Walking through the apartments, Nike Jordan shoe game
Versace glasses, I was only in the 9th grade
Triple gold D's by the 11th grade
Fuckin' all the teachers, all the teachers wanna fuck me
Got locked up 6 months I was 19, fresh outta high school
6 months in the county
10 cars mounted, 3 trucks, 6 hard tops mane
Four homes, two spots, two dogs
One a maltese and one a yorkie
Iced out dogs same size as the yorkie
If you touch this dog the owner start barkin'
Growlin', brawlin' reppin', ballin', stones not cloudy
Big boy ballin' Wilt Cham numbers on a bad day
Good day, 80, on a great day quarter
Starter, starter, gotta be a starter
Starter, starter, So Icy starter
Nigga you a bench warmer
