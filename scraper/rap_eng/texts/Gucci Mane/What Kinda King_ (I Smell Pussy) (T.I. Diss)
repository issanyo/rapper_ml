What kinda king do a birthday bash in the middle of the summer with some fucking leather pants?
What kinda nigga skeet in a slut bitch that every rapper hit, suck everybody dick?
What kinda king try to spark up beef then apologize for it on national T.V.?

What street nigga wear a three piece suit with cuff-links, ties and double back shoes?
Say it ain't so, nah say it ain't you
