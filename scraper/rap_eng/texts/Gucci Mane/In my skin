[Hook: Zaytoven]
My partner told me go head Zay you in your skin
I'm a gangsta you can't tell me who I am
I got diamonds and it's jumping on my skin
Swaggin' to the max I'm turned up to a ten

That boy Ziggy man, he flexing once again
Hit the club and put the money in the wind
Ain't no losses round here, all we do is win
Audemar the same color of my skin

[Verse 1: Zaytoven]
They killed the ostrich just to wrap me what I'm in
Ain't making [?], tell me what I need to spend
Frank Muller got it wrapped around my wrist
Do the math man, I'm turned up to a ten
Ain't she pretty man, look at my lady friend
It's a private party, no you can't come in
Keep it gangsta man, that's what I recommend
You can't tell me nothing, cause I'm in my skin
I'm in my skin

[Hook: Zaytoven]
My partner told me go head Zay you in your skin
I'm a gangsta you can't tell me who I am
I got diamonds and it's jumping on my skin
Swaggin' to the max I'm turned up to a ten

That boy Ziggy man, he flexing once again
Hit the club and put the money in the wind
Ain't no losses round here, all we do is win
Audemar the same color of my skin

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm a millionaire but now I walk again
I been [?] then I [?]
Wrap your Rollies round my wrist around my skin
And we like stupid drink and this my juicy gin (Jin and Juice)
I had a friend said he beat [?] (He left)
But he switched on me soon as I got in the Benz
Thought he was down, thought he'd do my [?]
But he didn't do it, it didn't go down like planned
Gucci mane, I'm money man, I rub my glass with rubber bandz
Somewhere round two thousand grams
Im kicking, pimpin, Jackie Chan
Memphis sipping, told the pistol, you'll never catch me slipping
Ownership [?]
Say you bought, who bought them with you?

[Hook: Zaytoven]
My partner told me go head Zay you in your skin
I'm a gangsta you can't tell me who I am
I got diamonds and it's jumping on my skin
Swaggin' to the max I'm turned up to a ten

That boy Ziggy man, he flexing once again
Hit the club and put the money in the wind
Ain't no losses round here, all we do is win
Audemar the same color of my skin
