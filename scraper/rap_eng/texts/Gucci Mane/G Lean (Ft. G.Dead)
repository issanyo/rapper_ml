We got the money, the hoes and the cars, and the gangsta lean
I live my life on the go, and keep addin hoes to my team
We got the money, the hoes and the cars, and the gangsta lean
I live my life on the go, and keep addin hoes to my team

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I live my life on the go, another day, another ho
Another bitch on my team, another slut on a strole
My bags rollin, stay swolin, all my clothes stay creesed
But I never trust these bitches, farther than I can see
I'm a million records away from a platinum CD
But a ghetto celebrety I was destand to be
Fuckin bitches in the ? the sweets and every damb every day of the week
Freak bitches keep steppin to me
I'm VIP every time, bitch, I don't fuck with no line
And I don't fuck with no crisp, bitch, I pop bottles of wine
? the bentlies, and the Chevy Shavelle
? start smilin, caue they know what it is
Jumpin out at the club, then I get fresh as hell
I don't wear no calone, bitch that's that dro that you smell
My money long as hell
Everyday that I that I stay out of sell
Everything that I say got a sell

And we work trains, all of them love to get brain
They say the love the dick, or they be lovin the fame
Well, my fame you can have it, but them hundreds I grab it
The PSO and the dro, it's such a bad habbit
