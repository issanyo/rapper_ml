[Hook]
I took one step forward and two steps back
I jumped so many hurdles to get where I'm at
I had one foot out and I had one foot in
And I ain't gonna look back if I get one more chance
And there's one thing that a nigga must understand
That tomorrow's not promised, this is your last day
And I'ma leave my fans with just one line
Try to live your life one day at a time
It's Gucci

[Verse]
[?] Anything
Then why I'm still hurdlin'
My cousin said "You're not a house, Gucci
So why the fuck you got [?]"
I applied for a job once
Really went with the workin'
But soon as I got to workin'
The same niggas start hatin'
I wasn't good at ridin' skateboards
I was better ridin' Daytons
I can't lie, nigga played for it
But it took a lot of patience
