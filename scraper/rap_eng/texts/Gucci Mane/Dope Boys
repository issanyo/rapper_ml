[Verse 1]
All Nas need is one mic, all I need is one stove
Homie got a nice flow but gucci got that white coke
You ain't getting the right dope, you knocking on the wrong door
Last nigga tried me, let's just call him John Doe
And since you short a dime homie then park me a old school
I fronted you, you ran off that's not what you're supposed to do
I'm gettin my tip fade cut Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm Brisco
Yeah, Gucci mane's a live wire
Try me like I'm Yung Berg and I'mma make yo eyes cry
Gucci like to drank, and Gucci like to smoke
And Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke
GUCCI! (Gucci Mane's a G')
Tell me something I don't know
I got court in early morning I don't really wanna go
I do this for the people cause I'm my brother's keeper
I don't feel you cause I'm paraplegic, where's my paralegal

[Hook]
See that house right there, yeah make a lot a money
(Who's that knocking at the door?)
Probably a couple junkies
That coupe over there, yeah cost a couple hundreds
See my neighborhood is bunkin tell my plug to keep it coming
Dope boys, dope boys with the dope boss (x2)
What you wanna get homie hurry up and buy it
Dopeboys gone buy you gon' get yourself supply

[Verse 2]
I'm in my M6 Beemer, this is no 645
Like a pigeon in the sky, I just shitted on your ride
So much weight off in my house, you would think it was a gym
Plus my Nikes match my necklace and my necklace match my rims
I got court in early morning I don't really wanna go
Say I violated probation just because I blew my nose
Blew 300 on my Rolls
200 more on the Lamb
Million dollars on the crib
Car note, don't know what that is
Gucci, you don't know who that is
Mama that's just Gucci Mane, that's my boy that's my partner
I'm Gucci Mane biggest fan
Plus she don't know what that is
I'm with that I don't give a damn
If you think I give a fuck you must do not know who I am, Gucci

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mirror mirror mirror
Who the realest in the game?
(Why you ask that stupid question
Boy you know that's Gucci Mane)
East Atlanta 6
You know how we roll
I just bought another Chevy got it right back out the bowl
Tall stacks up in my closet I can't even see my clothes
And my belly get so big I can hardly see my toes
Got a car in my garage I have never ever drove
It's a four-door black on black Phantom I call that bitch Dorrough
If she going to the ladies room I guess I'll let her know
I got powder in my living room, so she don't have to stroll
A year ago today, I was sitting in my cell
(Where you see yourself in 5 years?)
A so icey billionare
Gucci!
