[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I fucked her yesterday but I forgot her name
I'll probably never, ever see the bitch again
Oh that's your main?
Oh well I tried to tear her out the frame
Oh that's your main?
Well, she'll never ever hit the same
You stalking her? You called her up like 90 times
We ballin' out like it's 2099
And I'mma be a baller 'till the end of time
And I'mma be a baller 'till the end of time

[Hook: Gucci Mane] x2
I'm a rollin' stone, nigga, I'm a rollin' stone
Where I lay my hat is motherfuckin' home
I'm a rollin' stone, nigga, I'm a rollin' stone
I'm rollin' up the strong, nigga I'm a rollin' stone

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I'm a rollin' stone
Sellin' pussy and phones
Lil B, Gucci Mane
One show, that's a hundred grand
I said, "Thank you Based God"
Flexin' with the A-Rod
So many bitches on my dick I thank the Based God
I think that I'm Gucci
Shoot 'em with the Uzi
Still buying pussy
Who's sellin' coochie?
Who's selling molly?
Yeah, I got the money
I'm a rockstar and I will catch a body, like
