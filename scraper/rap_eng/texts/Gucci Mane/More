I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
Yes I wonder what she sees me

I said I wonder what she sees me
I wonder what she sees me
I wonder what she sees me
Yes I wonder what she sees me
I got pistols all around da house
Drug dealer's in my living room
Pounds stash every where
You know that I'm trappin' boo'
I've been selling dope since high school
Tokin ah pistol everywhere
I swear baby I hold you down
I Dare ah Nigga.Dare ah Nigga.Dare ah Nigga
Double Dare
I guess it's just the G' in me
Do you plan your mama meeting me'
I know your daddy don't agree with me
Your baby brother smoking weed with me'

And I wonder what she see in me
I know she see the G in me
Do you plan your mama meeting me
Forever she will be with me

But I wonder what she see in me
Every time she look at me
The judge he wanna throw the book at me
I guess lil mama love's the crook me
And we will be together hopefully
But I'm not too aggressive forcefully
I woke up she say she's loving me
Tomorrow probably be the worst for me
But I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
There's no place that she rather be
Then right here smokin' weed with me

She's right here sippin' lean with me
We gone off on A molly'
She's the life of all The party
Real boss don't get her started
But I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
Do you have on plan's on leaving me?
Do you think that you'll be breaking me
But there ain't no way that you'll be takin' me
I gotta keep that strap with m
