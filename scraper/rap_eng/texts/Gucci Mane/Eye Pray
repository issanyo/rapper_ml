[Intro: Gucci Mane & Yvng God]
Huh
I'd like to thank God
Yvng God on the wave!
It's Gucci!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I hope I get the dope
I hope I beat this case
I hope I touch down with the blow
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray
I touch down with the 'yo
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I thank you for the dope

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Thank you my Lord
Fendi band-aid for my sores
Flex all my ice on my whores
They love that bling when it blang
My triple-two shooter, he stay with that Ruger
He'll do ya, do ya, if you act like you 'bout it
Winnin' a beef with Lil Boat? Bitch I doubt it (fuck nah)
Tweeted that bitch back now she feelin' clouted
Bitch, shut the fuck up, call me father
New diamond chain, look proper
Gold Cartiers got me looking like a robber
Chillin' in the studio, with gunmen and robbers
But ayy what it do, GuWop?
Old niggas hate Boat, the new hip-hop
And I bet that just made you mad
Bitch, fuck 'em
It's Lil Boat!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I hope I get the dope
I hope I beat this case
I hope I touch down with the blow
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray
I touch down with the 'yo
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I thank you for the dope

[Verse 2: P. Reign]
Yeah, fishtail off the lot
Ten pairs of gators, the kicks made of crocs
Snakeskin band on the watch
Just bought a new mink and my bitch is a fox
Kilos, kilos, so much Keisha weighs what an elephant does
Everybody heavy, we got elephant love
Took a page out of Plies and ran off on the plug
Bentleys, all about the Benji's
Just blew ten G's on Jet Li's
All kicks, bricks flawless
When they ask how I do it I say "All wrist"
When they ask 'bout my clique I say "All bitch"
Bought a brick in New York, sold it in all nicks
My new bitch ask who all hit (who you with?)
I tell her "Whoa there," it's a long list

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I hope I get the dope
I hope I beat this case
I hope I touch down with the blow
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray
I touch down with the 'yo
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I thank you for the dope

[Verse 3: Fa$t Life]
Dash, fast, pull up in that gas back
Smokin' kush out that trashbag
Savage dawg, oh my God, what? You made me mad
Don't you ever gon' make me mad
I've been gettin' cash, I've been gettin' that extra tax
Put a [?] inside the [?]
No cap and gown, got yo bitch on a cap-me-down
Every time she just wipe me down
Gon' and flex on me, niggas, I'll flex on you niggas
Got racks for these bitches, we pay for these hoes
I've been getting money and it go, and it go
Everybody always know we gon' blow
All these bitches know praying for blow
Sellin' that snort, snow on the bluff
Got that 30, that 40, don't ever act up

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I hope I get the dope
I hope I beat this case
I hope I touch down with the blow
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray
I touch down with the 'yo
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I thank you for the dope

[Verse 4: Rich the Kid]
Young nigga, I'm playin' with the yola, Coca-Cola
Choppin' the block with the cola
Look at my wrist it's on Polo
Yeah we winnin', I'ma keep on winnin'
Niggas hatin', I'm gon' keep on jiggin'
Ayy, pulled up, my ceilin' was missin'
Young rich nigga on the top now
Is she bad? Is she foreign? Give me top now
Ayy, I just can't stop... six bitches
Fuck your bitch make her go missin'
You cuffin' that ho, you trippin'
Walk out the bank with a bankroll
Wrist too cold

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I hope I get the dope
I hope I beat this case
I hope I touch down with the blow
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray
I touch down with the 'yo
God, oh God, oh God, oh God
I thank you for the dope
