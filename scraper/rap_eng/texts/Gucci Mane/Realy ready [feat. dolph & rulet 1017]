[Verse:]
I’m a real nigga talkin bout what I really have
Cuz I fucked a nigga’s bitch, that’s why he really mad
Hit a nigga in his head, I be really glad
Since the day I lost Dunc I’ve been really sad
A nigga make a hit and deal, will he really last?
A nigga say he hold you down, but will he really blast
They say I’m worth 50 M’s but that ain’t really shit
And I contend with what I got, got to be really rich
So dope on the really was broke on the really
You really wanna get it then you know I’m with it
You didn’t wanna go to war with me, not really
If you wanna get it then you gonna get it
You work for me, I’m not really really

If it’s not yo girl, not really really
Why she hurtin yo feellings?

Bottles on me so we pourin all night
Nigga get it trippin, switch up fine night
Jumpin out that coupe, I lost my damn roof
That Gotti wasn’t so fly, we don’t need no pair of shoes
So I’m chasin at the figures, squeezing on these triggers
Bank account 6 figures, kick my feet up Louis slippers
Vacation in the Hamptons, rockstar, Marilyn Manson
Up for that check, I pulled a nigga ransom

Talk loud but they ain’t really
