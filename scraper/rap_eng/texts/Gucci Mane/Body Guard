[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Hah
Q Da Fool, Rich Shoota, and Guwop
Hah, it's Gucci

[Verse 1: Q Da Fool]
Fuck a bodyguard, I'm too hard nigga
I love my brother, caught some charges with him
Put some bread on his head, my shooters bound to get him
Hopped out with the draco and got him, I rip him
Bought so much work the plug let me fuck his sister
Rich Shootas sellin' bricks of crystal
I'm beefin' so hard that I gotta keep a missile
Can't let down my OG, I gotta hit you
Before I seen him I got pissed usin' pistols
Savages' tools, they sick and wishin'
I'm a Rich Shoota, I mean it
Migo touch down with them bricks, they the cleanest
Dropped out of school, streets turned me to a genius
Fuck the game and the game suck my penis
Just like a bullet they will never see me
You want to comment, nigga we gon' bring it

[Chorus: Q Da Fool]
Move like the mob so we wearin' Gucci
Don't tweet it, just squeeze it, nigga come and shoot me
I turned the whole show to a movie
Fresh out of jail, now I'm turnt up with Gucci
Come out Maryland, bitch they treat me like Boosie
Sorry your son, I turned him to Pookie
I hang with the gang, I think that I'm Tooie
Better get your bitch 'cause I caught her ass lookin'
Move like the mob so we wearin' Gucci
Don't tweet it, just squeeze it, nigga come and shoot me
I turned the whole show to a movie
Fresh out of jail, now I'm turnt up with Gucci
Come out Maryland, bitch they treat me like Boosie
Sorry your son, I turned him to Pookie
I hang with the gang, I think that I'm Tooie
Better get your bitch 'cause I caught her ass lookin'

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
My ear and wrist blinkin' while my necklace playin' tug of war
Test Guwop and start a war, never been so rich before
Gucci Mane a crazy man, he might need a psychiatrist
He back on that violent shit and ballin' hard like Iverson
Walkin' in the mall and I just jumped off the private jet
Rock so many diamonds I should change my name to VVS
It's not Khaled, I'm the best
Sun Valley 'partments, Bouldercrest
Glock nineteen, the shoulder holster
Make your head fall off your shoulder
Big Guwop the mogul mogul
New Range Rover, run you over
Haters thought my run was over
But I keep on going global
Gucci trapped off beepers
Pay phone, trapped off Motorolas
1017 home of the Braves
Falcons, Hawks, and Coca-Cola
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Q Da Fool]
Move like the mob so we wearin' Gucci
Don't tweet it, just squeeze it, nigga come and shoot me
I turned the whole show to a movie
Fresh out of jail, now I'm turnt up with Gucci
Come out Maryland, bitch they treat me like Boosie
Sorry your son, I turned him to Pookie
I hang with the gang, I think that I'm Tooie
Better get your bitch 'cause I caught her ass lookin'
Move like the mob so we wearin' Gucci
Don't tweet it, just squeeze it, nigga come and shoot me
I turned the whole show to a movie
Fresh out of jail, now I'm turnt up with Gucci
Come out Maryland, bitch they treat me like Boosie
Sorry your son, I turned him to Pookie
I hang with the gang, I think that I'm Tooie
Better get your bitch 'cause I caught her ass lookin'
