[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
When I started stealing candy I was just 6
My momma's close friends said I'll never be shit
8-7 nigga I was taking kid's shit
Started jacking shawty, let me get that bitch
1989, I was only 9
I wasn't slanging keys I was tuckin for a dime
Mountain Park apartments, everybody on the grind
Sun Valley apartments, everybody got a 9
It was 1992, and I was just 12
Had a run in with the law and they put my ass in jail
Juvenile, 50 g's, got me in a hour
12 years old with the money and the power
I was 14 selling flour and powder
Made 80 bucks a hour counting up product
I was 14 selling flour for powder
80 bucks a hour
Counting up product

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I was 14 bringing a, .38 to school
A deuce deuce in my locker and was known to cut a fool
I always packed a tool
I always played it cool
Drive a Chevy Caprice bought sell t9's and paint it blue
Matter fact that bitch was purple it would be, like a fool
That was 1998, I just stopped goin' to school
Brought a brick
Hit a lick
Then I got my new tattoo
Gucci held in the mic, tell them pussies what to do
One time I hit a lick, and I didn't know how to act
I start laughing when they asked me to bring the money back (hahaha)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
2002, a nigga had to do (what?)
What he had to do
That's why I robbed you (true)
2003, you know I needed weed
I knew you had them ki's
That's why I took yo cheese (that's why I did it)
2-K fo', I round a nigga do' (what)
I layed him on the flo'
Then shot him in the nose
They taking off they clothes
I'm workin all foes
I spanked his mammy house, Now he let it go
The game unfolds
I'm jumping out a Rolls
I robbed so many niggas that I rarely use my phone
My pistol bought a home
My pistol bought a coupe
Yo pistol is for show, but my pistol bring me loot
Gucci
