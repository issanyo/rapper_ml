[Intro]
Never too much (x8)

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I went to L.A, shit freak me out
I came back next week, nigga bought me a house
And I still represent it, live in the south
So nigga get that hollywood shit out yo mouth
Cuz if ya had it like me, ya would do it like me
Ride a Royce, fuck hoes, blow blow like me
Fuck a [?], most wanted TMZ like me
Reality T.V show like me

(Shut the fuck up!)

[Hook x2: Gucci Mane]
I'm gassed, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up all, and I went to sleep stunting
Never too much, never too much money
