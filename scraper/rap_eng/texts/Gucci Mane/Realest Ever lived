(Intro)
Big Guwop slappin bread, whopper it with cheese
Yea, extra cheese on mine
Yea
Tastely slice of bread

(Verse)
Big Guwop slappin bread, whopper it with cheese
In Belize still got that big mack on me
I'm unguardable,You need to put Shaq on me ( Huh?)
I need to fumigate, mosquitos love to suck on me
I need some rat traps, too many mice around me
A compulsive gambler don't bring no dice around me
I'm a robber, I'll rob ya blind, don't take ya eyes off me
I'm a kleptomaniac, don't leave yo bitch round me
I'm the same Gucci Sosa, influenced Chief Keef
With the suit and 20 chains, doing a mixtape with Scream
I'm the same Gucci nigga in the hood with the plan
If you niggas want something soft yall need to shit on yo hands
It's Gucci

(Hook)
I tell it like it is cuz this the life I live
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
Bad bitch in the crib, pints in the fridge
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
These rappers wear Fugazzi shit but Gucci diamonds real
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest rapper ever lived
I'm a multimillionaire and yet I kill rob and steal
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest trapper ever lived

Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
In my old school with a digital dummy playin Aaliyah
I got fans all in Japan but I was born in Birmingham
I'm sellin Cali kush in Bessemer, Alabama, I'm the man
Dope in Alabama, that was 10 a gram
I cook so many Graham crackers think that I'm a elf
2000 pounds of midgy and I sold that shit myself
I'm on Custer Ave. and Moreland, got room this shit hot as hell
My trap house dope going ham (honey baked)
VVS white boogers is fine for space scrapped in my Rollie base
Yo wife lookin stupid, got that never seen a Rollie face
Then she seen one but not like the one Gucci wore yesterday

(Hook)
I tell it like it is cuz this the life I live
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
Bad bitch in the crib, pints in the fridge
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
These rappers wear Fugazzi shit but Gucci diamonds real
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest rapper ever lived
I'm a multimillionaire and yet I kill rob and steal
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest trapper ever lived
