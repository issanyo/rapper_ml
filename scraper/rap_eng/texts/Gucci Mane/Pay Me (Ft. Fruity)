[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I need a bitch that can pull me a bitch
Or turn a trick, or better yet, turn me on to a lick
I hope to know she a ho, who, who ain't scared of this shit
I hope to know without a pimp, she a regular bitch
I give her gang for every situation, have her infatuated
I got the gift of gab, and the conversation who's the nation
I need a couple more to expect Gucci's operation
The one Matroppa Rapper, pimpin is my ocupation
So stop all that hezatation, all that procrastonation
Cooperation leads to indulging and fornacation
So Fruit, you say you love me, but bitch, I love the loot
I coppin blow, I'm in persute of a new prostitute

[Verse 3: Fruty]
Some bitches talk the talk, but I be walking the walk
My nigga Gucci round M up, and I make sure they trick off
Dolo might, but I will, fuck you ? the ticket, pay yo meal
Some bitches need X, but my pussy be red and wet
Got so much game, guess you can say I'm a poetic pimp
VIP type bitch, I strut, fuck a limp
Niggas eyes be romen, when they see me pass
They wanna grab on this ass, I'm straight dropping for cash
? place a pillo under my knees?
Sippin and slerppin and spit
Hit a split and and slow ride yo dick, when I'm turnin tricks
All for the love of the straight drop clique
My nigga, all for the love of the straight drop clique
