[Intro: Gucci Mane & Quavo]
Fuck boys in the wrong lane
(Honorable C.N.O.T.E.)
Wop, Wop, yeah

[Hook: Quavo]
50,000 on the dice game (cash-cash)
Fuck boys in the wrong lane (skrt-skrt-woah-skrt)
All my niggas know is gang bang (gang-gang)
Free my niggas in the chain gang (free, fuck 12, ay)
Got 2 hoes counting everything (scammers)
They get floor seats to everything (ay, yeah)
Floor seats at the Barclays (ay, yeah)
No penny from a young nigga, Penny Hardaway (ay)
Yeah yeah
I bought my bitch a Rollie now I got these hoes jealous
Yeah yeah
If we go our separate ways, bitch you might as well sell it
Bitch!

[Verse 1: Gucci]
Breakfast in bed, man I sleep with the bread
Went to sleep in a cell then woke up in a jet
Nothing gets me erect like when I cash a check
Look at my wrist and my neck, I'd rather pay for sex
Gucci and Quavo like Steph and Klay, we the splash brothers
Jewelry so flavorful, check out Fader, the last cover
Designers clash, designer frames, expensive glass
I'm thinking about fall fashion, these rappers falling fast
I ball so hard I make an ex-baller think bout the past
This bitch leave me then that bitch just went from riches to rags
I'm too bold to brag and I might be too old to sag
And I just bought a Rolls cause I'm too cold to buy a Jag

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Tell me the hood you come from, I pull up in a dun
These bitches starin' so hard, you'd think they saw Lebron
Went from shooting dice in the slums to gambling at the Palms
My palms is itching so I know them millions bout to come
Be bout your business, if I want a bitch I buy me one
These niggas snitches, if you ain't got a lawyer hire one
I got floor seats at the game, you know my money popping
I brought two bitches so bad that they even watching
Sat in the cage for three years, niggas ain't send me nothing
I made a mil in a day, yeah that's a lotta hustling
Say it's 10 mil in the safe and they gon' say you're bluffing
Cause they don't want you to ball, just want to see you struggling
