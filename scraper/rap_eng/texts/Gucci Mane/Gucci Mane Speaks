June 17th, 1017, the empire’s declaring war, I’m dropping the World War 3D. Three albums in one day. The Green Album by the Migos, The Purple Album by Young Thug, and The White Album with Peewee Longway. I would like to thank Mike Will Made It, 808 Mafia, Sonny Digital, Metro Boomin, C4, DJ Plugg, and The Honorable C Note for their help in producing the 2014 soundtrack for the summer…July 4 I’m dropping Trap House 4 and Sept 13 I’m dropping Trap God 3. Even though I’m locked up, I still run the streets from jail. It’s Guwop Coreleone
