[Intro: Future]
Bout to go snatch that lambo
Astronaut nigga

[Hook: Future]
I'm talking Lamborghini, feel like you gliding everywhere
Stop and put them doors in the air, I'm talking Lamborghini
Once you make it out the hole, so called friends turned foes
When you're talking Lamborghini
Put the motor in the rear, hit the gas and disappear
I'm talking Lamborghini, push and you go
Do a donut like you in the bowl
I'm talking Lamborghini

[Verse 1: Future]
Aye, the power of a dollar'll have you driving in a robot
Go snatch a Gallardo today, where the dope spot
I ain't your average Americano
I know them keys well and I ain't talking bout piano
Suicide doors draped to the floor (designer) of course
And we switching gears for every single year, we lost to the struggle
I keep my cup doubled, (2 cups)
And I love to hustle, and I love my muscle (only the strong survive)
I'mma flex I love it
It once was what it was, now my foreign coupe plush
My only choice, (is what nigga) is to ride foreign

[Hook: Future]
Im talking Lamborghini, feel like you gliding everywhere
Stop and put them doors in the air, im talking Lamborghini
Once you make it out the hole, so called friends turned foes
When youre talking Lamborghini
Put the motor in the rear, hit the gas and disappear
Im talking Lamborghini, push and you go
Do a donut like you in the bowl
Im talking Lamborghini

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Im in that i dont give a damn, black and yellow lamb
If you ain't selling grams you need to mothafucking scram
Im just feeling really important riding round in my foreign
Gucci man la flaire spend a hundred kay when its boring
Flex hard im warning dont the bitch look gorgeous
Shell be charged with forgery, her riding around on forgis
Niggas like to horseplay went and bought a Ferrari
First day outta jail im thinking bout that new Buggatti
Its big gucci balling like im ritchie porter
Im passing ace of spades out like its bottled water
I got the top back so i feel the summer sun
And ima have the top back til the summers done

[Hook: Future]
Im talking Lamborghini, feel like you gliding everywhere
Stop and put them doors in the air, im talking Lamborghini
Once you make it out the hole, so called friends turned foes
When youre talking Lamborghini
Put the motor in the rear, hit the gas and disappear
Im talking Lamborghini, push and you go
Do a donut like you in the bowl
Im talking Lamborghini

[Verse 3: Future]
Aye the motor in the front thats like a spaceship from the front I ate like 60 racks for lunch
And I just rolled me a blunt for my little nigga in the junt
And I just got off the phone with woo
I told him ima stunt for every year he got
Freebandz gonna turn it up a notch
So for that I'm bout to go and hit the lot
I ain't doing no staring I come for that McLaren
I came from out that dope hole, made donuts in the dope bowl
We rented cars, when time got hard I hustled harder
My grandma yard, I'm a real trap star
I learned to persevere so your understanding clear
I never shed a tear all I do is switch gears
