[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

Call the pill man
Tell him what you wanna purchase
Grab a pack of pills dawg
Make sure that they working
Sounds pretty (?)
But I'm doing it on purpose
Smoking on the Purpy
Behind the Maybach curty
Got that washing powder Bleach
And that white detergent
Pocket ample birdies
Two bricks for the thirty
Plug girlfriend say
That she wanna wax me
Girl wanna wax me, now he wanna tax me
Ask me, quickly, and keep it brief
I ain't really talkin'
Cuz I'm grinding on my teeth
And I'm biting on my lip
Cuz a nigga fuckin' geeked
Cavalli shades on
Gotta nigga finna street
I make a trap boy 3 or 4 clips a week
Now you fucks get mad, 65 so cheap
White same color as your girlfriend's teeth
Puffin' on that Keysha Cole
Last night we freaked
Big Gucci
