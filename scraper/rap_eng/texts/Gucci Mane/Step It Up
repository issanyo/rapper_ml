[Chorus: Hefe Wine]
Now let's get it straight, I'm from Fifth Wall
Step it up
What your money lookin' like? Is it stackin', my nigga?
Step it up
What your shoe game lookin' like, nigga?
Step it up
What your whip game lookin' like, nigga?
Step it up
What your bitch lookin' like? Is she thick, my nigga?
Step it up
Do you have some diamonds? Are they shinin', my nigga?
Step it up, step it up
Are you ready for war? You packin' 'em keys, my nigga?

[Verse 1: Hefe Wine]
Try to touch me, you whole family gettin' wacked
Spread the word, I ain't even gotta drop the rack
See me in that Turbo S, black on black
225 on the beltway, that's a fact
Rumors, Hefe, he gone
Truth, Hefe, he on
Where I come from, where I come from
Niggas is totin' that heat
Where I come from, you run from
Niggas ain't playin'

[Chorus: Hefe Wine]
Step it up
What your money lookin' like? Is it stackin', my nigga?
Step it up
What your shoe game lookin' like, nigga?
Step it up
What your whip game lookin' like, nigga?
Step it up
What your bitch lookin' like? Is she thick my, nigga?
Step it up

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci in this bitch and I ain't goin' back to jail
Gave my lawyer half a mill, I sent like ten bricks in the mail (bricks)
And I smell just like that coco-aine, I cut a brick in half (skrrt)
And I wipe my ass with fifty cash, I know I got a stash (stash)
I got a crooked pass, I ain't lookin' back (no)
Versace shades and I'm bright, fushia I'm lookin' at (shade)
A thousand pounds of cookie, call me the Cookie Monster
I use to shop with ya but then I took it from ya

[Chorus: Hefe Wine]
Now let's get it straight, I'm from Fifth Wall
Step it up
What your money lookin' like? Is it stackin', my nigga?
Step it up
What your shoe game lookin' like, nigga?
Step it up
What your whip game lookin' like, nigga?
Step it up
What your bitch lookin' like? Is she thick, my nigga?
Step it up
Do you have some diamonds? Are they shinin', my nigga?
Step it up, step it up
Are you ready for war? You packin' 'em keys, my nigga?

[Bridge: Hefe Wine]
Swangin' lane to lane, in my lap, a double cup
Singin', "Please don't kill my vibe", bitch, shut the fuck up
Huston is my city where the girls real pretty
Where no one act sadidy and the food never shitty
You gon' see some big ass and some big ol' titties
We the land of the swangers and the lean, I'm committed
And we stackin' that paper if it's clean or it's gritty
And at strip clubs you gon' see some good kitty

[Chorus: Hefe Wine]
Now let's get it straight, I'm from Fifth Wall
Step it up
What your money lookin' like? Is it stackin', my nigga?
Step it up
What your shoe game lookin' like, nigga?
Step it up
What your whip game lookin' like, nigga?
Step it up
What your bitch lookin' like? Is she thick, my nigga?
Step it up
Do you have some diamonds? Are they shinin', my nigga?
Step it up, step it up
Are you ready for war? You packin' 'em keys, my nigga?
