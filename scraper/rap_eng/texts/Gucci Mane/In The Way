You squash it , man
It's a message , man
If you're hustlin' for fashion
Count on a nigga's pocket
Boy, you turned ... in the way
Holdin' the space,you're in the way
Boy, I swear you're in the way
Got a couple of homies in the pen,standing on their ...
You wait to squash space
Would you fuck niggas?
Yeah, you really fake
I'm afraid man
I swear you niggas in the way
Holdin' the space

Got shot 99 times in the face
You hurt you body in the play
And your head in the lane
We losin' breath in the rhythm
I swear the trick ain't grey
I got a million dollar play and it's covered the day
I get a medium memo feeds to tell them to get out of the way
I'm in the club, okay you are late
I'm like a red nose pit
You can't take shit off my plate
I take a cure for my niggas and I set it in your face
You want an R&B rapper, you better listen to Drake

If you're hustlin' for fashion
Count on a nigga's pocket
Boy, you turned ... in the way
Holdin' the space,you're in the way
Boy, I swear you're in the way
Got a couple of homies in the pen,standing on their ...
You wait to squash space
Would you fuck niggas?
Yeah, you're really fake
I'm afraid man
I swear you niggas in the way
Holdin' the space

How can I begin to fear
What all these suckers pretend?
Talk about what they're gettin'
And what they went on the weekend
Where do these niggas come from?
Holdin' space in the way
And all the real niggas are away
Can't take the pressure , gonna fall
When I was younger,I stood on my tip-toe
I got to go the long way
Wtf do you think I stand for?
Immitating a plant cause your lifestyle sucks
A nigga's money is to count on
You can't move for free
Anything has a price

If you're hustlin' for fashion
Count on a nigga's pocket
Boy, you turned ... in the way
Holdin' the space,you're in the way
Boy, I swear you're in the way
Got a couple of homies in the pen,standing on their ...
You wait to squash space
Would you fuck niggas?
Yeah, you're really fake
I'm afraid man
I swear you niggas in the way
Holdin' the space

You all niggas don't want no money
You're hustlin' for fashion
I'm in love with digital scales and some sandwich baggies
Catchin' me in and out
And I fly without no luggage
We sound like we're ballin' without no budge
We were running to the cars since I was a youngie
Momma told me that I wouldn't make it
You only got 2 options
Get up and take it
Nigga get that money, dont know why that smile in your face
And talk behind your back

If you're hustlin' for fashion
Count on a nigga's pocket
Boy, you turned ... in the way
Holdin' the space,you're in the way
Boy, I swear you're in the way
Got a couple of homies in the pen,standing on their ...
You wait to squash space
Would you fuck niggas?
Yeah, you're really fake
I'm afraid man
I swear you niggas in the way
Holdin' the space
