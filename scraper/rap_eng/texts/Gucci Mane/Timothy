[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in a neighborhood not far away
Was a dude named Timothy, he tried to steal a car a day
He kept a screwdriver close by, he did autotheft
Got with a lil' crew and now he not doing it by himself
One day timothy broke in a truck, quarter million bucks
What the fuck, crazy luck, now he think he rich as fuck
They hit the mall bought it all jordans, bellies, pellet jackies
Six slugs in his grill, all the hoes throwing pussy at him
Little did he know that that dough came from Black & Joe
Joe from down on Coasta Ave and all he did was slang the snow
So Joe sent Black with scraps and goons to catch him at his momma home
Rang the bell, then 'ventually put two shots in his momma dome

[Hook]
Here's a little story bout a boy that hit licks
Dope man, dope man, gimme all the bricks
Zone 6 niggas are always hard
Don't talk that trash cause we'll pull your card
Here's a little story bout a boy that hit licks
Dope man, dope man, gimme them bricks
Zone 6 niggas are always hard
Don't talk that trash cause we'll pull your card

[Verse 2]
Oh shit Tim mad as fuck, angry as a bitch
He didn't know, he didn't give a thought it'll turn like this
Now he mad, man he really mad and he want revenge
And he vows on his mama life he gon' do 'em in
Now he lying down coasta ave, black ain't hard to find
There they go Black and Joe and murder's on his mind
So he let loose the fucking gage, everbody flees
And he catches Black straight in his back he on his knees
Joe was bussin' like a fuckin Russian he barely escaped
But his right hand man is bleeding to death in his face
Tim's gone, he back at the spot, holding on his scrap
And he know that ain't nothing he can do to bring her back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now big Joe don't give a fuck no more, he can't even love no more
He took 40 g's up out his stack, and set kill tim and his crew
Now Timothy is laying low, that quarter mill's not here no more
His momma she not here no more, and Black will never breath fo sho'
He drinking gin and blowing dro, he sadder than he ever been
He looks at his whole crew, then thinks to himself we were never friends
He can't run away from this, he don't got no where to go
Plus the police looking for em' they was watching Black and Joe
Damn what can he do this shit is real
Cause if he make the wrong mistake, then he'll get killed
Jumped in the car, him and his boys he so confused
High speed chase, they crashed it down, just watch it on the news
