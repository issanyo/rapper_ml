[Intro: Chingy, Soulja Boy]
Chingy-ling, Soulja Boy (oh, oh), Gucci Mane (oh)
Y'all know who it is, huh? Let's go (oh, oh)
Soulja Boy tell 'em (oh, oh)
Wrist so icy, wrist so icy, Gucci
[?], that's right
[?]
(DJ motherfuckin' Rell)

[Chorus: Chingy & Nicki Minaj]
She say she want a balla got stacks there by the bar
She say she want a balla like me, that's a star
She say she want a balla that drive a lil' Civic
Put a pistol in his lap 'cause in the streets your balla hit it
He say he want a broad like me that's thick
He say he want a broad like me, a real chick
He say he want a broad that get it in the bed
Let him hit it from the back, then give him good head

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
She want that good shit, that Gucci, gone with that bullshit
Soulja Boy and Chingy players, Gucci, that's the dream team
No [?] on my mansion, party at the Hamptons
Soulja Boy a murderer, Gucci got it down
Made my H2 Hummer of them H, got 'em climbin'
Aw, not pretentious but my field of view declinin'
I'm rockin' yellow diamonds, neck plates shinin'
I'm Gucci Mane prodigy so I keep grindin'
Blind out A8, if I'm in London you can't find me
A big bank roll and got 12 right behind me
Ain't gon' pull it over, shawty in the passenger
My car is European, my 'dro is straight from Amsterdam
Gucci bend her down, the wife be in the Carribean
I'm sipping on Dom PÃ©rignon, ain't no tussin, man
I'm flyin', my eyes tight, how much more can they tighten?
Soulja Boy tell 'em, Gucci Mane the alliance

[Chorus: Chingy & Nicki Minaj]
She say she want a balla got stacks there by the bar
She say she want a balla like me, that's a star
She say she want a balla that drive a lil' Civic
Put a pistol in his lap 'cause in the streets your balla hit it
He say he want a broad like me that's thick
He say he want a broad like me, a real chick
He say he want a broad that get it in the bed
Let him hit it from the back, then give him good head

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Baby, I'll be your co-pilot, mama do the drivin'
Let me take you shopping, baby, you can be my stylist
Let me be the treasurer, et cetera, et cetera
More lettuce than a caesar salad, get my lady [?]
My yellow girl, my yellow car, them off-road parts scream be cautious
Gucci bag with Gucci rings and Gucci shoes, they hundred dollars
Probably just some [?] polos, [?] I was just a balla
Have your dolly [?] then walk in Gucci hunnids
Here's a warning, if you want me, when you gettin' pretty like [?]
Keep a hundred on me, I keep it a hundred, honey
AK, hold my money, homie, AR [?]
I don't wanna shoot you, homie, I'm just tryna fuck, lil buddy

[Chorus: Chingy & Nicki Minaj]
She say she want a balla got stacks there by the bar
She say she want a balla like me, that's a star
She say she want a balla that drive a lil' Civic
Put a pistol in his lap 'cause in the streets your balla hit it
He say he want a broad like me that's thick
He say he want a broad like me, a real chick
He say he want a broad that get it in the bed
Let him hit it from the back, then give him good head

[Verse 3: Chingy]
Star-[?] whips, so I call it bubblicious
Had a bad asian broad to clean my house and do the dishes
Ain't gotta tell her, we'll do something and you know that [?]
Let's sync interest with the gay, whipin' it up in the kitchen, ay
I'm one of the freshest left, girl you know I'm fresh to death
[?] by myself, the sink was full just like a F
My eyes long as 30 streets, truck fit no 30s, b
Gram, got 30 on me, fuck it, I'm [?] on me
Let's get lil' mama thick, pussy like a baby monkey
Bless that third verse so chunky, call me quick, I am way too funky
The static pop off, my whole team bookin' fifties
Saw me ridin' [?] chains with me like

[Chorus: Chingy & Nicki Minaj]
She say she want a balla got stacks there by the bar
She say she want a balla like me, that's a star
She say she want a balla that drive a lil' Civic
Put a pistol in his lap 'cause in the streets your balla hit it
He say he want a broad like me that's thick
He say he want a broad like me, a real chick
He say he want a broad that get it in the bed
Let him hit it from the back, then give him good head
