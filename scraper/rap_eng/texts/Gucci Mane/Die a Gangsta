[Intro: Future]
Better hope you die a gangster, gangster, gangsta
Super, out of here, yeah

[Bridge: Future]
I hope you die a gangster
I hope you plan on game, there's too much blood on these fingers
Send out a headshot, put them O's in an asshole
I'm running on X pills, I'm out of control
I'm running on X pills, I'm out of control
What you do with my neck piece? Woah
What you do with my neck piece? Woah
What you do with my neck piece? Woah

[Pre-Hook: Future]
I had to do my thing, I do my thing, I spread my wings
For Myesha, for Myesha, I had a crush when you was real
We eat Benihanas for breakfast, we got a chef at the crib
We got a semi auto, you the desperado, this a motherfuckin' trip

[Hook: Future]
Man I'm pissed off, I'm pissed off, somebody outta get killed
All of my instincts done told me that these niggas, they ain't real
Man I flew off on the scene, I had 300 in the whip, yeah
You can't even understand why they glorify my drip, yeah

[Verse 1: Future]
60 K on sip, 100 rounds in the clip
Somebody playin', they got spilt
Went I hit the set you better dip
Spit the block with the AK, I heard everything got flipped
In one hour smoked a zip, it took me one hour, she got drip
Gram of kush in a leaf
Told you niggas I'm a beast
If you try your luck, it ain't sweet
I'ma put these niggas right beneath me
I make my way throughout the East
My plug 10 with the molly
I put your main in the knotty
I double barrel with the shotty
You pump fakin' with some riders
You lucky they ain't hit your mama
A lot of pain in my body
Got me smokin' marijuana
Pluto, been inside the trenches
Pluto, get a nigga whacked
Pluto, took a nigga ho
Pluto running through the racks

[Hook: Future]
I hope you die a gangster
I hope you die a gangster
I hope you die a gangster
I hope you die a gangster
Man I'm pissed off, I'm pissed off, somebody outta get killed
All of my instincts done told me that these niggas, they ain't real
Man I flew off on the scene, I had 300 in the whip, yeah
You can't even understand why they glorify my drip, yeah

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Just got a Black Card... just to go in the wallet
Soon as I go in your jump? I'ma go in your pocket
They call me East Atlanta Santa, I'ma fuck up the profit
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas, I might go in your stocking
I'm talkin'.. too cocky, I got so much juice
My wrist is.. too rocky, they done let Wop loose
I'm talkin'.. plug talk, this don't pertain to you
'Cause I'm a trap astronaut, I use cocaine for fuel
You got a meetin' with my shooters, it's been arranged for you
I bust your head and celebrate, man this champagne's for you
You're talkin' gangster but you'se a lame, this ain't the lane for you
This FBG and 1017, this ain't the gang for you
It's Wop

[Hook: Future]
I hope you die a gangster
I hope you die a gangster
I hope you die a gangster
I hope you die a gangster
Man I'm pissed off, I'm pissed off, somebody outta get killed
All of my instincts done told me that these niggas, they ain't real
Man I flew off on the scene, I had 300 in the whip, yeah
You can't even understand why they glorify my drip, yeah
