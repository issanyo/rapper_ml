Gucci

V1

I’ve been lost without you, all day and every night
I’ve been lost without you, you’re, all that I know
Can’t let you go
And every morning I think of all the times that we spent, thinking of what we’d be we’d sit, stupid clueless and shoeless
Hanging on this Broken tree

Pre
Cuz we’ve been through some things that
I cannot explain so
It’s getting hard to think about you and I
And we’ve been through some things our friends just can’t relate to
But

Hook

I’ve been lost without You
(Ooo ooo)
In my life, in my life
I’ve been lost without you
(Ooo ooo)
In my life, in my life

I’ve been lost without you

Gucci Mane

Real team I’m the king you the queen baby
That’s why you stunt on the birds with the ring baby
Imma cop you a rolly with the pink face
Because you shaped like a barbie in the first place
I’m gunna pay the cost, to be the boss
Because without you girl, I’m lost
We gunna keep ballin, no stoppin
We gon’ stay shinin, stay shoppin
Got everybody lookin, yeah they watchin us
The whole world fascinated yeah they jockin us
It’s probably cuz we icey as a hockey puck
I know the haters mad but I don’t really give a fuck
Pull up in a rarri put that runt up
Minks everyday we about to fuck the winter up
Drop top wop already fucked the summer up
Big boy race won like a hummer truck
