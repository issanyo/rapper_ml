The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci had stole 80 pounds
The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci had stole 80 pounds
The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci had stole 80 pounds
And when Gucci get out, we gon’ break ‘em down
The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci had stole 80 pounds
The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci had stole 80 pounds
The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci had stole 80 pounds
And when Gucci get out, we gon’ break ‘em down

[Verse 1: Lil Meta]
L-I-L-M-E-T-A, So Icey, M-I-Z-Ay
Why? ‘Cause I want to, bitch, East Atlanta, that’s Zone 6
D-E-double B-I-E, made me do it B-I-G
Because she believe in me, got me all up on TV
With the J-U-I-C-E, with the J-U-I-C-E
Yeah, you see me in that “I’m Gettin’ Money”
All up on the camera with them big-faced hundreds
With that Meta chain that ran me ‘bout twenty
I’m handsome, so girls give me coochie, I can’t wait ‘til they free Gucci
When they let him out of jail, we gon’ pop bottles, smoke fruity
Eat us some lobster and sushi, shrimp, calamari, and pasta
Watch a couple gangsta movies like Belly, Scarface, and Shottas

[Verse 2: Montana da Mac]
I been out here hustlin’, money doublin’ off the meter
[?] fly sneakers, auntie fresh up out the cleaners
Tell them come get it, say he wanted to hold nina
I’m in the middle of the hood with all the old people
Can’t find the scale? Call the housekeeper
Benz Jeeper, them sixes, they crawl like creepers
Ain’t nothing end of the heat, dog, so get out my freezer
Got folks juggs of lean, Meta gon’ give them two Liters
I got cookies, little rookie, and I ain’t talking keys
Ten bands, seven bands for exotic reefer
Re-up, re-up, re-up, re-up ‘til the money steeper
Pimp it, pimp it, pimp it, pimp it, now my pool deeper

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]

Talk that shit, now get off your feet, now we flying, man
Now the crowd go wild, call me Waka Flocka roof
I’m ‘bout that green kush, turn into Waka bushes
I smell kush, I smell mid
No, that purp, boy, I need all that shit
Montana, Meta, Flocka, call this group a triple threat
Southside Riverdale, Waka Flocka, he the vet
(Flocka!) That’s my name, bruh (Gucci!) That’s my main bruh
(So Icey) That’s the home team, like Atlanta Braves, bruh
We shut down shows every time we hit the stage
‘Cause I’m bulldog, shout out to Mizay
Bruh, bruh, bruh
