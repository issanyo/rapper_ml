[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shawty, I'm flexing
In the courtroom, burning dro
Give a fuck about the judge, what you think my money for?
Shawty, I'm flexing
Ocean front view and the trap is like my weed
Like my girl, like my car, so we stunting
Shawty, I'm flexing
White, green, red, white, yellow, chain tacky
I'm flexing, not matching
Shawty, we flexing
Black and white dogs, zebra skins
Sitting on them elephants, told your girl to jump in
Shawty, we flexing

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Stunt, ball, like there's no tomorrow
Threw a hundred grand at my shows, shawty, I got gwalla
If she roll with Waka Flame, then you know that girl gon' swallow
Holler at her ass tomorrow
She gon' call, she gon' page but a nigga ain’t gon' answer
In the club, make it rain, shawty, we're in a fucking desert
Blue and white, gray paint, looking like Barry Sanders
So Icey flex game, shawty, we the new Atlanta
Shawty, we the new Atlanta
We flexing, we riding
We iced up and we ain’t matching
They might snatch him, they might grab him
His name Waka Flocka Flex, I gotta have him

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shawty, I'm flexing
In the courtroom, burning dro
Give a fuck about the judge, what you think my money for?
Shawty, I'm flexing
Ocean front view and the trap is like my weed
Like my girl, like my car, so we stunting
Shawty, I'm flexing
White, green, red, white, yellow, chain tacky
I'm flexing, not matching
Shawty, we flexing
Black and white dogs, zebra skins
Sitting on them elephants, told your girl to jump in
Shawty, we flexing

[Verse 2: David Blayne]
My jacob, my rollies, my Benz, my homies
My bitch, they stay stupid fresh just like I be
Try me, middle of your hood, slap your wifey
Like she work up on to David Blayne nightly
Nikes, fitted "A" hat, don't let my goons clap
And with your whole trap, this where they do that at
My crew keep fruity packs, I keep a thick bitch
With long hair, big booty, she light-skinned
You haters mad at me 'cause you can't stop me
Drop V and the skinny tires, hugging on Asantis
Pockets full of bands, repping So Icey
Repping So Icey

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shawty, I'm flexing
In the courtroom, burning dro
Give a fuck about the judge, what you think my money for?

Ocean front view and the trap is like my weed
Like my girl, like my car, so we stunting
Shawty, I'm flexing
White, green, red, white, yellow, chain tacky
I'm flexing, not matching
Shawty, we flexing
Black and white dogs, zebra skins
Sitting on them elephants, told your girl to jump in
Shawty, we flexing

[Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman]
Flexing, flex, diamonds 'round my neck
Young Juiceman and these diamonds, I'm gon' flex
Red chain, blue chain, call my shit So Icey chain
32 E-N-T and I made me a stupid chain
Houses by the lake, diamonds like a snake
Orange Juiceman and he super duper straight
It's Brick Squad, dog, and you should buy his tape
And OJ da Juice, Gucci, Flocka Flocka straight

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]
I be Hulk Hogan flexing, Macho Man flexing
Juiceman, Gucci Mane, Flocka Flame flexing
Frenchie copped another watch and Wooh just bought a necklece
I bought me a Rolls Royce and parked it on the 'Crest, man
