I tryna separate myself between the fake and imposter
Niggas screaming he a big dog we steady mobbin'
I was told that gonna hit, dog you steady running
We playin with guns wrong click dog we steady mobbin
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
We stay and labor, we stand in labor
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
We stay and labor, we stand in labor
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
Blame  it on the sauce, pockets on shitaurus
Shootin at a fuck nigga in a ford Taurus ,ditch I like bvlgari
Just like Carlton, polo down
Young nigga turn into goblin, hit a nigga now with that chopper
Don’t need to call it together
Smoke this all like a roaster, fuck, fuck nigags on the roasted
Pop the black like
On that first shit they like sucker, creeping high like on blue
King of the jungle, they do what they do
Die and make it care like fool
You cannot do 52, fuck nigga I gotta chose
Beat nuts and counting all
Fucking your bitch and your group
Hard bitch I’m like what am I do?
Before I get sweat, you know what rappers will do
You know I’m in the rest I got only my dudes
Chopper, chopper that only truth
There from the track and I’m ready to do
Zipping and telling the truth
The niggas are riding and choke on my hallucinate
Are rather choke up on my shoes
Make so much jealous, I’m gambling with it
Don’t chop it with the changes
Watch it the nigga let turn and lay choppers, be there yelling
I try separate myself between the fake and the past
Need to scream here a bit, down we stand here mother
I were told that gonna hit, down you stand to hide it
You play with gun wide, clear
And we started maley
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
We stay and labor, we stand in labor
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
We stay and labor, we stand in labor
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
Watch how quick , they turn to goblins
You stay on maley with some friends
In the hook with some chicks
There’s the miles you beat it
Bitch can release the snitching
On the band all like ...all six sis he know?
Afraid of God and you got more ambitions
They come for you bitch, your sister, your mom
Separate from the …
Chop a nigga on like you stuck up in the …
There’s just …holding no wander
Coming through like jumping in hamo
No understand to come on and rock all
No guap in, I’m rapping solo
Singing to your mama get on
Do that song for all game
But we should get anything
Fake big dogs, ain’t no onw to quit it
Go hale for bitches, pull up that Hd gonna be dishing
Pull it ok gona be done and get all bitches
I try separate myself between the fake and the past
Need to scream here a bit, down we stand here mother
I were told that gonna hit, down you stand to hide it
You play with gun wide, clear
And we started maley
Watch out, quick , they turn the gun
Watch out, quick , they turn the gun
Watch out, quick , they turn the gun
We stay and labor, we stand in labor
Watch out, quick , they turn the gun
Watch out, quick , they turn the gun
And we started maley
Watch out, quick , they turn the gun
Watch out, quick , they turn the gun
Watch out, quick , they turn the gun
