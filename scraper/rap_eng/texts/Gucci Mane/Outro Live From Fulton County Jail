Mine do numbers while I drive Lambo
Off white yayo, digital scale yo
Fish scale sendin' my pigeons by mail
Bring in my drain folk, [Incomprehensible] folk
[Incomprehensible] folk, just bring me that cane folk

Bricks can't keep 'em 16 fever
Bemmer speakers, geek-a-meters
Misdemeanors several subpoenas
See I'm gone drink up 'cause we just linked up
The squad been teamed up we cuttin' off fingers
It's 16 fever and that's since April
My Corvette paid for, my old school paid for
The hummer roll up that means you assed out
And you didn't cash out, see this my trap house
I slam fiends backs out we push white sacks out
See this my trap house, I slam fiends backs out
We push white sacks out, them backs get pushed out

I'm scrapin' the bowl up, I'm whippin' up cake mix
But this ain't red velvet, don't eat it, just smoke it
Your options are open, you even can snort it
3 dollar sacks so you know you can score it
Say you can't afford it, yo, I can ignore it
Well, don't call them dope, boys, you know you feel borin'
You know that you feenin', you know that you need it
It's Gucci, I'm greedy, my niggas stay eatin'
