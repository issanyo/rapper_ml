[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Wonderful, wonderful, damn I feel wonderful
I'm lookin’ at your girl and I feel like fuckin’ her
Wonderful, wonderful, damn she feels wonderful
She ridin’ with a star and we smokin’ in the car
I feel wonderful, wonderful, damn I feel wonderful
So many diamonds on that I’m lowering the temperature
Wonderful, wonderful, damn I feel wonderful
I know you hate, bruh, but that’s so understandable

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Red bezel on my Jacob looking like a sliced tomato
Fuck a hater I blow acres of Jamaica in decatur
I’m so extraordinary while my bracelet so canary
Choppers that my niggas carry probably scare the military
Half your budget spent on luggage, spent your mortgage on a portrait
Purple bud look like an orchid, can't afford it? watch me torch it
Tell your shorty, gucci at her birthday party, cost a 40
This imported foreign flying saucer make me feel important
Tell big booty Gina from Virginia if you ever see her
I remember last November and I can’t wait 'till the sequel
Where’s my equal? I don’t see him, never met him, never meet him
If I meet him, I’ma greet him, beat him, eat him up and leave him
It's Gucci!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Dippin’ raucies like a landshark, tell me where the gills
Switching gears, damn look the wheels leave me with the chills
On the real, Gucci vacuum sealed, fuck them record deals
Selling pills, moving pounds of med, kept a pocket scale
Bitches love me cause my pockets chubby, money stupid lanky
And I’m drankin' while I’m driving, diamond solitaire on panky
They ain't owing, so my money growin, blowin’, rollin’ o and
Drop top beemer, yeah it’s foreign, Ralph Lauren shirt, I’m sippin’ don
And then while I’m managin’, leave you stiff just like a mannequin
Frantic and they panickin’ they see we got advantages
Only got one life to get, I wish I had two or three
So icey the family so bury me as S.I.B
