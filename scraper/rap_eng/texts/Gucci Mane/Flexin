[Chorus]:
Swawty I'm flexin
In da court room burnin dro
Give a f*ck about dis judge
Wat you think my money for?
Shaawty I'm flexin
Ocean front view
And my job is
Like my weed like my girl like my car
Shawty I'm flexin
White ring red watch yellow chain tacky
I'm flexin not matchin
Shawty we flexin
Black and white dogs
Zebra skins
Sittin on them elephant
Took your girl

Flocka:
Boww

Threw a hunded grand
At my shows
Shawty I got gwapa
If she role with waka flame
Then you kno that girl gone swang
Holla at her as tomarrow
She gone come she gone bang
But a nigga ain't gone answer
In da club make it rain
Shawty where tha f*ckin desert
Blue and white grape pain
Lokkin like Barry Sanders
So icy flex game
Shawty we da new atlanta

JuiceMan:
Ay, ay, ay
Flex diamonds round my neck
Young juice man
And dese diamonds I'm gone flex
Red chain blue chain
Call my shi* so icy chain!
32 e.n.t and I made me a stupid chain
Houses by da lake
Diamonds like a snake
Young juice man

And brick squad dogg
You should buy his tape
And Oj da juice, gucci, waka flocka straight
Gucci:

Macho man flexin
Juice mane, gucci mane, flocka flame flexin
Frenchie caught another boy
So gucci bought a necklece
I bought me a rolls royce
And parked it on da chest man
Frenchie:
In the right direction
Ain't no need for stretchin
I'll teach you a lesson
I just wanna ball
Take your broad to the West Inn
Have her jigglin balls
I got her with no questions
I go outfitter (?)
Flexin like a bodybuilder
I get every color b*tch
(?) got her mountain climbin
Diamonds water surfin
You scream out cowabunga
These stones filled wih clouds
And mines light up like a thunder
Frenchie
Gucci:
Robbin, bribin, trappin and finess
Diamond bricks, diamond bells
Fake pill flexin

Schwartzenegger flexin
Rock game in the (?)
