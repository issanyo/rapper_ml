[Intro]
It's Gucci 1017 zone CEO
Hand to hand

[Hook]
I eat M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
$20,000 in the club, you know I play too much
Drop a bale on his head he say it way too much
I eat M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
$20,000 in the club, you know I play too much
Drop a bale on his head he say it way too much

[Verse 1]
Got my girl trippin' sayin' I'm cookin' yay too much
Count so much paper I'm gettin' paper cuts
And the watch around my wrist cost a mercedes truck
Standin' on stage I smoke like eighty blunts
Two hundred fifty thousand just to tell the time
I paid that bitch a stack so I could jump the line
Gave the waitress three hundred just to pour the shots
Picture perfect how I hold the pot (skrt)
You niggas couldn't beat me on your best day
Drop a kilo on your head make your neck break (dang)
I sent 500 pounds up top where the Jets play
I count five hundred thousand down here where the Braves stay

[Hook]
Eatin' M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
$20,000 in the club, you know I play too much
Drop a bale on his head he say it way too much
I eat M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
$20,000 in the club, you know I play too much
Drop a bale on his head he say it way too much
Eatin' M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
$20,000 in the club, you know I play too much
Drop a bale on his head he say it way too much
I eat M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
$20,000 in the club, you know I play too much
Drop a bale on his head he say it way too much

[Verse 2]
Shawty got a nice face, take her to a nice place
Brand new 'rari watch me park it in a tight space
Engine in my backpack, pussy nigga back back
Pullin' up in what's that, that'll get you laughed at
Call me billy bathgate eating crab cake
No this not a math test but I got stacks bae
Guess its just my gangster demeanor
Keep me just gettin' subpeona
Tryna fuck Venus and Serena, Rebok, Nina, [?]
Accurate I'm immaculate
I'm a bachelor, you an average bitch, doin' average shit
I can't stand a bitch [?]
My click is thick I'm nigga rich
Yo swag stink like a sack of shit
I'm the president, it's evident
Bricks and pounds all in my residence

[Hook]
Eatin' M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
$20,000 in the club, you know I play too much
Drop a bale on his head he say it way too much
I eat M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
$20,000 in the club, you know I play too much
Drop a bale on his head he say it way too much
Eatin' M&M's for breakfast and I ate too much
Since I seen my first M I don't say too much
