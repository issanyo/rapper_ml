Run up a check (yeah)
Securing the bag (yeah)
Roughin' the passer (burn)
They throwin' the flag (burn)
I'm packin' a pistol (bang)
With no need to brag (bang)
I'm covered in Robin
I'm drippin in swag (swag)
Run up a check
Securing the bag (yeah)
Roughin' the passer (burn)
They throwin' the flag (burn)
I'm packin' a pistol (bang)
With no need to brag
I'm covered in Robin
I'm drippin in swag (swag)

[Verse 1: Rocky Luciano]
Hold up this shit
Hold up it's mad hype
Oh shit where that frost bite
Hopped out of that [?]
Been doing this since a young man
Anyhow I'm a strong man
Pussy white like the milk man
This the peak of my life span
Knock you out with my right hand
Smokin' packs of that Afghan
Off-White in that light tan
Pack a pack and send packages
I shoot for war but I'm average
Always strapped I been a savage
See somethin' I gotta have it
Neiman Marcus with a shopping addict
Smoking broccoli and stacking cabbage
Good person with bad habits
Posted up at Saks 5th
Posted up at Nordstrom
Posted up with ya bitch
I'm a trapstar you a snitch
Watch me raw-dog your bitch
My style extravagant, lifestyle so lavish
You a hater if you bag this
I'm exquisite my flow sick
I ain't left the trap in months
Selling dope I need three blunts
I'm a savage for the [?]
Fuck a pass
We runnin' up the middle on these pussy fucks

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm water whippin', I'm drippin with swag
Gucci Mane is just securing the bag
Roughin' the passer gotta get a sac
[?] this on my hat
Big ol' diamonds on my pinky ring
Make a bitch catch a heart attack
This droptop will make a hoe collapse
Know it's Guwop but please relax
He turnt down, I'm to the max
Body covered in Dolce
I'm the host and fuckin' the hostess
There be slime down her face like lotion
Got deep pockets keep reachin'
Professor Wop I keep teachin'
New tennis chain I keep blingin'
It's always blinding her she keep blinking
Been a billionaire I keep thinkin'
'Cause being a millionaire too easy
She wanna fuck for one reason
Hit the button in the coup and show cleavage
I'm the king I just left Cleveland
Being like Gucci ain't easy
I wear furs for no reason
Convertibles all four seasons
Gucci
