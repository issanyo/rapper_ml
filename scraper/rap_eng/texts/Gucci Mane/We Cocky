Crank my car with the tip of my fingernail
Wanna shop with me then by you a bigger scale
Wanna cop choppers plenty yoppers then call me
Got more god damn guns than an army
So Icy Entertainment soliders cock it and aim it
And we don't want a sign just make you famous
So many rings on I need another pinky
I hit more broads than Wilt the Chamberlain
I'm all black, rich, and I'm extra dangerous
I'm handsome (?) almost famous
I'm workin' with the fork and the sides I'm scrapin'
I burn it, turn it the crack is Cajun
Your Auntie hit it said it's amazing
Your uncle pawned your Playstation
The dope man got on new Ballys
I slam dunk bricks my plug throwed an alley
I'm shark meat, caviar, kush, and salad
The coke from Venezuela but the kush from Cali
A million dollars worth of carats gotcha jealous
But ain't nothing a hater can tell us

[Chorus]
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky

They can't tax me whatcha gon' tax me
Ask me I sell chicken like Zaxby's
Stacks and racks and Franklins and Jacksons
Packs and bales we sell them white dragons
I'm a talking brick they need to unwrap me
God take my breath if Gucci's not trappin
65 pounds of mid in my magnum
'caine same color as baby girl's dandruff
Kush same color as baby boy's stacks
Purp same color as Adrian Pete's fans is
Dog is a falcon black, red, white diamonds
Same height and same weight as a lineman
Pulled up in a donk and gave your girl the Heisman
Touchdown in the 6 I'm dancin' like Rodman
Skrt Skrt dancin' my egg beater harmonizin'
That's my machine advertisement
That's my AK homiciding
That's Gucci's favorite line man

[Chorus]
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky

My scale see mo' blow than 4 drug stores
I'm drinking ice tea my girlfriend a coke ho
I strap a brick to her tell the bitch to go go
Nowhere she go nobody ___ this ho
I'm workin' with this fizo
Egg beater good but I'm workin' the fizork
'caine so pretty bitches love to snizort
I'm tryna sell everything they could import
Or export, my young nigga from Shreveport
But I don't show love I give him what he paid for

[Chorus]
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky
We cocky, yeah bitch we cocky
Watch, ring, chain you know that we're poppin'
They're jockin' but I swear so cocky
Pockets so fat it makes us more cocky
