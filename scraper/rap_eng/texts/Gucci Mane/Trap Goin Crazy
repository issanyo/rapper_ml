(Chorus)
Trap Going Crazy
Going Crazy
Going Crazy

Im Gettin Money
Checks Came Next Day
On Saturday
It’s Pay Day
The J's Commin'
Sunday My Off Day, I Ball all Day, Smoke All Day, And Then Stuntin Nigga Week End

(Verse 1 )
Atlanta twist ya fingers up, bangin like a center
My diamond necklace swingin like a thrilla in Manila
Index look like Christmas, pinky cold as winter
See the frozen crystals when I hit da cigarillo
Remeber I'ma genius not like Washington and wizards
Not from Pittsburgh, PA but a your girl on my pestila
In my red Ferrari sittin on spinaz, tinited windows
Blinkin like a blinker on the seats of my intiial
Probly seekin u can see me wit deez Puerto Ricans
In bikini it look like ima cheatin cuz im trick or treatin
Sittin on spinneys in my Lamborghini while you dreamers guenie
As I'm leaning and the carrage gleaming and the sun is beamin
Gucci…..

(Verse 2)
The Red Guy Is Rollin So It’s Hotter Than A Sauna
All The Boys And Girls Gotta Get Up Off The Corner
Feds Got Ya Picture And Your Partna Snitchin On Ya
Baby Moma Bitchin And She wishin That You Crumble
Pounds IN A Trash Bag Tell Me Whats The Number
Pillz In A Nap Sack, Chickens in the Hummer
Trap House Bunkin I Dun Made Another Hundred
You Better Count Ya Money Cause Its Christmas in The Summer
A hundred eight Degress Ill have you Outside in a bummer
Da Middle Of July I Make It Winter IN The summer
Cociena Clinet Got It Snowing Like Nebraska
Zone 6 east Atlanta Man We Call This Shit Alaska

(Verse 3)
Im In da Kitchen Homie Whippin Up A Deuce
Niggas Lookin Sick I Call It chicken Noodle Soup
Chickens In The living Room We call It the chicken room
Birds everywhere lookin Like Atlanta Zoo
Pounds in a Stash Bag Chickens in da coop
Birds like a pet Shop pigeons on the roof
Workin with da fork turn a 1 into a 2
Half ya niggas snitchin' gotta watch out for ya crew
Find me on two eighty five flyin around the loop
If you want to smoke holla at me for the fruits
If You want the Ikk's Holla At me for a Few
I'm Standing over pots like ya momma cookin' food

(Chorus)
