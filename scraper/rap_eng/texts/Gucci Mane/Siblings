Young Thugga Mane LaFlare!
It's a lifestyle you might not be accustomed to, sweetheart
Black cards and shit, these are Giuseppe's. I said Giuseppe's
Where your Birkin bag at? You ever had a pair of red bottoms?
Well, who is you fuckin', baby? Cause you ain't fucking us. You ain't fucking nobody

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Bought a Phantom just to paint it gray (Skirt!)
Got a girl just to call her "babe" (Hey, babe)
I don't know why this always happen to me
But when I'm with my broadie, all his family members look okay

[Hook: Young Thug]
I want your siblings
Your siblings, bro, I want your siblings
Your siblings
Baby, where your siblings?
Where your sister at?
Bro, I want your siblings
Where your cousins at?

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Grind of the backseat, the ghost or the phantom
Every time I pull up on Decatur, looking all handsome
Baby girl, you can get this cash, cash, and some
Pull up to the family reunion, everyone's a dancing
Got a bitch pretty panamera around me
I buy a real gold neck, look like a Grammy
My jewelry cold like a bando attic
My jeweler froze like the fucking Titanic
I want to butter you, I want to butter you
I'm gonna spook you to death, baby girl, you knew
I want to fuck you to death, baby girl, you knew
I want to sign you like you So So Def, you knew
I want to scoop you, you just like ice cream
Girl, I want two scoops
I want to control you, no voodoo
I want one scoop, I want two scoops, I want three scoops, I want four scoops
I'm like Uncle Luke

Your siblings
Baby, where your siblings?

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Broke up with my homie cause I fucked all of his sisters
Got into a couple shootouts cause he heard I called them hookers
You know we slime life, I'ma get her wet then hook her
You know we slime life, steal racks out her purse, I booked her
Roll her like a swisher
Fuck sis and then dismiss her
Then pulled up in that spider
Auntie outfit look like she was a nurse so I flirt (I flirt)
Then my broadie came outside, treat them with syrup
I'm a A-1 nigga so he take my word (Take my word)
Took my phone pocket, called him and he heard me say "Slurp" and don't burp
