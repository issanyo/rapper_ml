Verse 1:

I'm so drunk that I can't keep balance
You stepping on my New Balance
I put sixes on my charger
Cuz these niggas ain't no challenge
Kush coming in from Cali, Yeah that's up my alley
I'm a dope-sellin nigga, I'm a kush-smokin nigga yeah the shit run in my family
None of these niggas don't scare me
Half of these niggas don't like me
Got me grabbing for my gun
Got me going on the run
Got blood all on my Nike's
Alot of the hoes be striking, some of these hoes be triflin
Got a nigga in the trunk, jumping out with the pump
And you came to the hotel icey
Bring a dog to the fight
Bet the dog gon' bite
I'll end a nigga life with a gun or a knife
I'll take a nigga girl, I'll fuck a nigga wife
If you do it in the dark then it's coming into light
Got the plug pulling up to the park with the white
On the Crest with a vest and a tech and a check
Don't do it the best but I'll do it to the death
Don't need you to do it I'll do it myself

Hook:
I called my chick and said I need some more of that
The way she put it on me at a loss for words
I called my plug and said I need some more of that
A thousand pounds of herb and plus a lot of purp
Im sipping lean about to pour some more of that
I think I need about a thousand pints of syrup
You make me mad then imma fuck your hoe for that
I got your bitch with me I know your feelings hurt

Verse 2:

Your bitch is with me and your bitch is a flirt
Limpin with pimpin I know that it hurt
Took off her dress and I took her to dinner
Took off my shirt and she took off her skirt
Smoking on purp and I ball out the vert
Hating on gucci is making it worse
Your dick in the dirt and my goons on alert
And i ? this nigga can't fill up a church
All of my niggas still fuck with the work
Fucking with gucci's a gift and a curse
Fell on her dress then I fell on her breast
If im feeling like that then I fill up her purse
Play with me nigga you ride in a hearse
Pay me and pull up or these choppers will burst
Hit in the head and i know that it hurt
Dead on arrival no of a nurse
You think that its funny you owe me some money
You niggas gone pay me my cash by the 1st
Fuck with my g's and these choppas a burst
Got a hole for you niggas real deep in the earth
Im fucking your bitch but she sucking me first
Roll me a blunt and pour me some purp
Gucci the boss and your life has a cost
Play with my money I blow up your house
