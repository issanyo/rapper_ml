[Intro: 21 Savage, Lil Pump, French Montana & *Gucci Mane*]
21, Gucci gang (Lil Pump)
Savage wear a whole lot of Gucci, mane (Montana)
Savage got a whole lot of shooters, mane (brr)
Savage got shooters on the roof, mane (Gucci gang)
Savage got shooters in the booth, mane
That's it right there, Gnealz
This nigga talkin' crazy 'bout who, mane?
Shot a pussy nigga in his tooth, mane
(Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang)
Ooh, Bi-Bighead on the beat
*Lil Pump, Guwop*

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Spend three racks on a new chain (yuh)
My bitch love do cocaine, ooh (ooh)
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name (brr, yuh)
I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring (ooh)
Rather go and buy Balmains (brr)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Spend three racks on a new chain (huh?)
My bitch love do cocaine, ooh (brr)
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name, yuh (yuh, yuh)
I can't buy no bitch no wedding ring, ooh (nope)
Rather go and buy Balmains, ayy (brr)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
(Lil Pump)
Call me El Gato Guwop or Mustafa the 3rd
Back in the day they was callin' me Ray
Run with the yay, drum on the K
Fuck with Lil Pump, you get shot in the face
Gucci the gang so we watchin' the snakes (Gucci)
Made me eight mil' so I bought her a Wraith (mwah)
Two shows in a day, brick on the plate
L.A. to the A then it's back to the Bay
Gucci gang, eskimo, froze like the North Pole (brr)
Jumpin' out the whip just to pose in my Gucci robe (Wop)
Woke up in the picture, Bam Bam Bigelow
Gucci Mane a jiggalo, diamonds in my Figaro
Oh you know what, bro? I ain't even know
Walkin' out the Gucci store, 'bout to spend a hundred so
Lil' bitty bitch, with a big booty though
She a dancer but a grade A student though
Pump went to Harvard, well fuck it, I'm goin' to Yale (Wop)
Free Meek Mill, free all my niggas in jail (jail)
Gucci to death, I'm really a gang by myself (Gucci gang)
Feelin' myself, tuck in my shirt, show off my belt (it's Gucci)

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Spend three racks on a new chain (huh?)
My bitch love do cocaine, ooh (brr)
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name, yuh (yuh, yuh)
I can't buy no bitch no wedding ring, ooh (nope)
Rather go and buy Balmains, ayy (brr)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Gucci gang, Louis gang, Fendi gang
Savage wear a whole lot of mothafuckin' anything
Fuck a wedding ring, side bitch, main bitch
Your bitch, his bitch, Savage fuckin' everything
Got a snake on my collar, I ain't rockin' no diamonds
Y'all lil' niggas poppin', that's chump change
Got an FN and a Draco
But I still fucked around and hit him with the lil' pump, mane
I Saint Laurent my garments, lil' bitch, pardon me
You still stay with your mama, lil' bitch, pardon me
I run through the money like it grow on trees
You can't afford new hair, you like to hold on weave
Double cup red, huh, just to match my 'Rari, huh
I don't even drive it, spent a quarter just to park it
Gucci on my daughter, and she still a toddler
She can barely talk but she know that her dad a baller

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Spend three racks on a new chain (huh?)
My bitch love do cocaine, ooh (brr)
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name, yuh (yuh, yuh)
I can't buy no bitch no wedding ring, ooh (nope)
Rather go and buy Balmains, ayy (brr)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)

[Verse 3: French Montana]
(Haaan, Montana!)
Got a lil' pump under the Gucci, mane (ayy)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (ayy) (Gucci gang)
Was yellin' "Ha" way before Juvi', mane (ayy, ayy)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (ayy, ayy)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Kufi gang, diamonds all blue like Hoover gang
Nipsey, Snoop and them
Gucci gang, boomerang, made the block hot
Came through, went popped down south of Gucci Mane
French had the franchise
With a Franchize Boyz white tee, you ain't like me (haaan)
Nah, you ain't like me
You ride the wave, you ain't like me
Cop some chains, you ain't like me
Made a hook, you ain't like me
Bills ain't bills, a nigga like me
Before the Gucci gang was the Gucci Mane (Mane)
Couldn't see my life through a Gucci frame (frame)
Seven pills, Act' in my system (huh)
They gave Max life in the system (huh)
Servin' raw like sushi gang (huh)
Throw you off a Wyclef like Fugee gang (woo)

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Spend three racks on a new chain (huh?)
My bitch love do cocaine, ooh (brr)
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name, yuh (yuh, yuh)
I can't buy no bitch no wedding ring, ooh (nope)
Rather go and buy Balmains, ayy (brr)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Spend three racks on a new chain (huh?)
My bitch love do cocaine, ooh (brr)
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name, yuh (yuh, yuh)
I can't buy no bitch no wedding ring, ooh (nope)
Rather go and buy Balmains, ayy (brr)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
