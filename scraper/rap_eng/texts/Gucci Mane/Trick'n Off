I took my bitch to Lenox Mall, I call it tricking off
Fifty bricks just crossed the state, I call it getting across
Gucci, Rick Ross on the stage, I call it oh they flossy
And when you put your niggas on, I call that being a boss

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Diamond chain round my neck, I call it Bloody Mary
Purple 'Vette parked at the crib, I call it welch's jelly
Blue and white new drop-top Beamer, I call it Papa Smurf
And if you take your nigga work, call that a lot of nerve
Three thousand, five hundred dollars, call that Louie purse
A penthouse suite for me and her, call that a loss her skirt
Nigga outshine Gucci Mane, I call that boy the first
That black on black, got them on sixes, call that a rolling hearse
Me, Mariah on the screen, I call that feelings hurt
These busters' that be caking bitches, I call them Captain Kirk
Rick Ross, Gucci, Drumma Boy, I call that going in
So Icey And Maybach Music call that a easy win

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Heavy in the game, champagne in my pool
Don Perignon and bitches in my jacuzzi
Time to act a fool, might be on a pill
Might be Section 8 but I'm riding mighty clean
Worth twenty million but whoever would've thought
Worth twenty million, boy You better be a boss
Walk up in the club, she know what I'm about
She fucking with a thug so she know that pussy bought
Knock that pussy out, knock that pussy out
She call me Jake The Snake cause I knock that pussy out
Now it's time to slide, spend a quarter on my ride
Not twenty five, boy I'm on that other side

I took a bitch to Bal Harbour, I call it tricking off
Bought myself a hundred choppers', I call it getting off
Took that bitch to Cal' Mall, I call it getting by
I only spent a couple hundred, she think she getting fly
Supplying all the local traps, I call that running shit
It's piled to the roof with stacks, I'm on that gutter shit

Sitting in a Call A Cab but I came in a Rover
Thumb action on the brick, we call it flipping quarters'
