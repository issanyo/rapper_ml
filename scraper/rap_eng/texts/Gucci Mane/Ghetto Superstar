[Intro: Gucci Mane]
What's happenin'?
Pakman Jitt
Guwop
Woo, go!

[Chorus: Pakman Jitt]
Real trap nigga real ghetto superstar
I pull up in that foreign car
Snatch off with ya broad
Pull up, I'll pull ya card
Real trap nigga real ghetto superstar
I pull up in that foreign car
Snatch off with ya broad
Pull up, I'll pull ya card

[Verse 1: Pakman Jitt]
Plug keep callin', he say that sack on the way
Want some Perkys and some plates, that's a double plate
Born a trap nigga, I don't know no other way
My apologies, I caught your bitch the other day
Middle fingers to my haters, that baby Nina with me
Free my nigga Gucci, he was dreaming with me
I was water whippin' whiter than some Colgate
Now I'm applyin' pressure from an eighth to a whole plate
Trappin' all night, we used to race to the cars
100K strong, that's a trap superstar
We ain't sparring nann groupie bitch
All about that sack, boy, Pak, I'll go lunatic
Pull up with no roof and shit to show 'em I do this shit
I'm on a new level and I bought a new bezel
Nah, I ain't gangbangin' but I'll bang bang
I got on 8 chains and I just sold 8 thangs

[Chorus: Pakman Jitt]
Real trap nigga real ghetto superstar
I pull up in that foreign car
Snatch off with ya broad
Pull up, I'll pull ya card
Real trap nigga real ghetto superstar
I pull up in that foreign car
Snatch off with ya broad
Pull up, I'll pull ya card

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
All this jewelry on, I'm lookin' like the waterboy
I'm in South Beach with ya bitch, but I'm a Georgia boy
Trap superstar, I'm tryna hit all the hoes
Kingpin status, man I need all the blow
Independent nigga, yeah, but got a major budget
You a minor league, Goon Gucci major thuggin'
Hollywood smile but my earrings muggin'
And if you ain't talkin' money you ain't sayin' nothin'
1017, yeah the worldwide regime
I'ma walkin', talkin', real life money machine
She'll never meet another nigga like me
I had more money than her daddy and I was 19
It's Gucci!

[Chorus: Pakman Jitt]
Real trap nigga real ghetto superstar
I pull up in that foreign car
Snatch off with ya broad
Pull up, I'll pull ya card
Real trap nigga real ghetto superstar
I pull up in that foreign car
Snatch off with ya broad
Pull up, I'll pull ya card
