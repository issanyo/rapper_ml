Ain't no love love for you rap niggas, you rap niggas, you rap niggas
Yeah, fuck you rap niggas
Ain't no love for you fake niggas, you snake niggas
You snitch niggas, yeah fuck you bitch niggas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm the type of nigga I don't give a fuck nigga, I bump into a nigga
Don't even say sorry
I'm the type of nigga get dead azz fresh
Then go to my enemy birthday party
Pop the truck got a sawnoff pump
Have your running like Forrest Gump
Gucci mane pockets gone keep the mumps
In east Atlanta call me Donald trump
Ion rap with u can't rap with you
Never sold a brick in the trap with you
The real la flare and I'm a millionaire but I get your ass killed for a stock or 2
I don't see niggas, I just see commas
None of these niggas don't keep it 100
Came up bumping so old so bumping
Never met another nigga so dishonest
CEO shit shoot dice for artist
Bump into each other who life the hardest
Talking trap shit cause my ice the largest
Everybody think they kids the smartest
An independent nigga with a major artist
A Gucci Mane show is a gangster
Glock 40 on my waist
Got a 40 in my pocket and a young nigga with me with a extra 40

[Verse 2: OG Boo Dirty]

Fuck a rap nigga I don't fuck with rap niggas
I kill a rap nigga jump the ...on my GE
Never saw me, never heard of me
What's taking so long just to google my g
Money on niggas they trigger crazy
Glock 19 with the stitch on handle
You a pussy ass rapper, just a Hollywood actor
But if I catch in my seat send them young niggas at you
Let's bag it up, and whatever I say, I can bag it up
Mind for a living nigga chain for wood
Bang on whoever, I don't give a fuck
Go anywhere with my ice on, rep the snake like a python
Same old g nut chain hoe, bad boy, bust a cone
Fuck these rappers, I expose these niggas
All these goons can hold these niggas
Real white and blue you the police nigga
Shawty get the fire, put a hole in the nigga
You been missing the action, hey, what you dead nigga
Come home pussy, I know you scared nigga

Ain't no love love for you rap niggas, you rap niggas, you rap niggas

[Verse 3: Rocko]

Busting moves with lil yoga, I hit licks with tp
Probably sold out 50 hunned thousand nicks, mvp
Graduated to the weight, no fucking waited on my wake
I ran that sack up to the sky, no fucking waited on my wait
I'm addicted to the cake, I whip that milk I make it shake
I jump that pack till it's all gone, then I recook up all that shake
Till I met my nigga shake, rip my nigga shake
Told me rock you the hardest, I can tell you not no artist
Running bread in 8, still got bread in la, second time that I broke bread with la
On the 4th im in the...Gucci gutter as it get
Blue dirty my fucking ace, whatever he with, that's what I'm with
