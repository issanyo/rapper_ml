[Intro]
Who it is?
Who is this?
Oh that's whatcha-ma-call-it
Nigga, this Guwop nigga
Oh, oh that's Guwop!
Shut the fuck up nigga
Slap the shit out you nigga
I said it's Guwop nigga
Turn Up
Aye Man
Keep it pimpin'

[Verse 1]
I think one too many blunts today
Too many beers now I’m drunk today
I drunk a pint of lean so I'm wasted mayne
I got that gangsta in nigga you can taste it mane
I'm Servin, I'm Servin
All of my niggas be Servin
Pull up to the curb, curb service
Whatchu want nigga we working
I’m Servin , I'm Servin
Come through in my Bentley I’m swerving
Hoes say I look better in person
Maybach ima close the fuckin curtains

[Interlude]
What's happnin'?
It's Guwop
The legend
Shout out to Zone 6
It's Big Gucci
Diamonds hittin' so hard
You see me
I know you hear me
That strong in, I know you smell me
Yall niggas some fuck niggas, I know you tellin
And I don't need ya, cause I'm a felon

[Verse 2]
Touch down in ya city where the pass at
Where the pass at??? you make a nigga laugh black
Need a pass for you nigga, you'll get blast at
You just a mid-grade nigga like my last pack
I'm just a money makin' nigga you can call ASCAP
You waiting on me to fall you need to wait on your income tax check
I got so much money I left the mall with every damn bitch
And for the Panthers raise your arm up then you make a balled fist
They moved my nigga so far away cause they say he was high risk
His folks can't even come down to see him, barely can pay they damn rent
And now he frustrated, incarcerated and it got us all tense
And if them folks try to give me forty ima jump the damn fence

[Chorus]
I'm chargin $3900 for it I got them bags in
$850 you know I got that swag in
I got that mexican weed them bricks you know that trash shit
And all you gotta do is drive this shit to Athens
Bricks Squad in this bitch we known for takin'
I got a couple more 'dem squares they goin to Macon
I'ma stop by Savannah, then Augusta
And I'm a multimillionaire, but I'm from Custer

[Verse 2]
These niggas tryna hold me back
But a nigga can't never hold me back
Gucci Mane ima get up ima walk round and ima get me a stack
Walk around with these thigh pads
Damn my nigga that my bad
That you broke so damn fast
Had the same chance that I had
You feel bad but im not sad
You can talk trash but I moved on
Three homes, ten phones
Tell me where did it go wrong
All the money that I have
Aka that’s my stash
Nigga try to take my cash
Bet the nigga gon' die fast
50 bands in the brand new pants
Take $5000 and I wipe my ass
Gucci Mane fear no man
I’m a tough guy like Conan
Mojo my right hand
And R.I.P. to my dope man
I know he lookin down from Heaven

[Chorus]
I'm chargin $3900 for it I got them bags in
$850 you know I got that swag in
I got that mexican weed them bricks you know that trash shit
And all you gotta do is drive this shit to Athens
Bricks Squad in this bitch we known for takin'
I got a couple more 'dem squares they goin to Macon
I'ma stop by Savannah, then Augusta
And I'm a multimillionare, but I'm from Custer
