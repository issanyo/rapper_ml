I be big boy stuntin, big boy stuntin
Ride behind 5 percent tints gettin blunted
I be big boy stuntin', big boy stuntin'
If you ain't got it I ain't trippin' I front it

(Gucci Mane):
I'mma stunt, roll another blunt, double park my dunk in the front
Jump out with my gun, walk off in the club, have fun
20,000 ones, yellow diamond shine bright as the sun
Gucci out the whip, drop top with a blunt, smokin' chron
Yeah my motor run, me and money got a stupid blunt

I'mma pick a gun, do you hear me son? (We the ???)

Picture this, Gucci talkin' slick, gots a couple chicks, she ain't shit
Ring on my finger, cost a bout a brick, I'm the shit
Bitch, you know that shit, you know I'm the shit

Left wrist, cost a hundred bitch canary on my fist
Me and black, all in dallas now, jumpin out my lam
Girl a chap, that's so icy wow

Gucci man I am

I be big boy stuntin, big boy stuntin, ride behind 5 or 6 head gettin bloodied
I be big boy stuntin, big boy stuntin, if you ain't got it I ain't trippin I front it
