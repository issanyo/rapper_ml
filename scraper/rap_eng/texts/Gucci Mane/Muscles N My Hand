[Hook]
Bitch, I'm Gucci Mane, I'm the crack selling man
I get muscles in my hand from that fork in the pan
Every gram I got a profit, gotta stick with the plan
I'm the general, niggas follow my chain of commands
Bitch, I'm Gucci Mane, I'm the crack selling man
I get muscles in my hand from that fork in the pan
Every gram I got a profit, gotta stick with the plan
I'm the general, niggas follow my chain of commands

[Verse 1]
Though I'm not signed to Universal or Priority
I bet a million Gucci blow up 'fore 2003
I lay my verse with no rehearsal then head back to the street
Don't need no video commercial, just my mic and a beat
And I can't fall off like a cat, I'm gon' stay on my feet
Pick up a rat and put a track under her passenger seat
I'm a convicted felon trafficking a package of beef
So if the po-po try to snatch me, she gon' catch all the heat
The rap game is overcrowded so I must maintain
Sell a nickel, sell a brick or sell a bitch some game
I keep junkies sucking glass dicks 'cause shits the same
I got junkies burning mad shit for hits of 'cain
Gucci Mane, and I don't really know to rap
But I know how to cook that cake up, how to fuck up the trap
I know how to weigh that yay up, how to catch any cap
I'm still trapping in Decatur, bitch, that crest on the map

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm Gucci Mane, I'm the crack selling man
I get muscles in my hand from that fork in the pan
Every gram I got a profit, gotta stick with the plan
I'm the general, niggas follow my chain of commands
Bitch, I'm Gucci Mane, I'm the crack selling man
I get muscles in my hand from that fork in the pan
Every gram I got a profit, gotta stick with the plan
I'm the general, niggas follow my chain of commands

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm Gucci Mane, I'm the crack selling mane
I get muscles in my hand from that fork in the pan
Every gram I got a profit, gotta stick with the plan
I'm the general, nigga, follow my chain of commands
Bitch, I'm Gucci Mane, strapped like a soldier from Afghanistan
My clique be beefing like it's Israel and Pakistan
If it's a drought, we gon' tax you like the cracker man
'cause we love cheese like we die hard Green Bay Packers fans
It's Gucci Mane, the one them crowds can't stand
Busters be smoking bale, I prefer that grown man
Bitch I [???] straight shooters, they be sayin' "god damn"
I keep them J's mouthes numb off that straight drop yam

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm Gucci Mane, I'm the crack selling man
I get muscles in my hand from that fork in the pan
Every gram I got a profit, gotta stick with the plan
I'm the general, niggas follow my chain of commands
Bitch, I'm Gucci Mane, I'm the crack selling man
I get muscles in my hand from that fork in the pan
Every gram I got a profit, gotta stick with the plan
I'm the general, niggas follow my chain of commands
