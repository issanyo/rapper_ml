[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got you, Khaled, it's Wizop
It's the Dapper Don going on a trapathon
Serving coke, dog food and kush, I call it a triathlon
In a red Dawn with an Amazon
She pissed me off, I just found out she got her panties on
A year ago seen niggas get stabbed over honey buns
It may sound funny to you, found out he got punctured lungs
I just want the funds, I don't rap for fun
I rarely post the money, I never pose with guns
Went from a robber to the upper upper echelon
Just to get here I had to rob a couple Mexicans
But free Kodak Black, bring Lil' Kodak back
Cause they don't wanna see you move into their cul-de-sac

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
It's do or die on my side of things
Destiny is my livelihood
I'm Iverson with the long braids
Three cellphones with the gold fronts
Wild thing 'til I Yao Ming
Five rings, past nine seasons
Big money, that's our thing
Heavyweight, I Ali 'em
Featherweight how I leave 'em
Heaven's sakes, God's need 'em
Bob weave rock the Colosseum
I'm the biggest nigga, you got gonorrhea
Baddest bitches make my collage
Biggest buds make my cigars
Basic bitches and custom cars
Blowjobs in the SLR's
Realest ones wanna watch you shine
Smoking good and I'm talking facts
Iced out like DJ Khaled
Burn it down with Kodak Black

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
