[Gucci Mane]
Gucci mane silent but his ice still talking
Sipping lean and rapping call it sleepwalking
Lamborghini creeping on the street like it's tip toeing
Mazeratti cripwalking paint the car orange
Foreign car hood star topless whip I need a bar
After the club I'm a leave with her
Hat, shoes, bag, belt, pants, shirt, rag, man
Everything matching baby, everything Gucci mane
Say why got on Louis frames and they call you Gucci Mane
I am not a groupie Gucci I put that on everything
I put that on everything, she put that on everything
We put that on everything, I put that on everything
