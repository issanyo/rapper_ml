[Chorus]
Picture me flossy big fish rolling I’m frosty

Won ni mo boss, just because they cannot touch me
Won ni mo boss, (whaa) you better picture your boss

You can say me am riding on grace

Even you know that I do
Ah! uhh uhh uhh… I am the king

Came back with a knockout, MK Mortal Kombat
And if you tryna stop me give you tight G drop kick like Liu Kang

When I pull up man I want five hundred grand
You think I'm playing till my goon cut off your hand

I got a plane yeah to move a million grounds
I think am Chapo how I’m selling all these xans
It’s like a dessert ‘cos I got a key us in
I feel like Nick Cannon marching with the bands
Swear to Bolton ‘cos the Canon is in my pants
Diamonds on my neck and wrist they like to dance
I feel like Pablo when I get the kilograms
