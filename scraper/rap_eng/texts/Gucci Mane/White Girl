Yellow Benz wit a spoiler kit wit my spoiled little chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist match this yellow bitch
She a trip shawty she shit she know she the shit
If u dont buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch shawty mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid give her candy stick
She a bitch make her flip a brick make her sic a chick
Since legit ive been swaggin dick Gucci Mane the shit
I met a girl name Susie I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie so I let her in my coup
I snatched her in my fender while I stashed her in matire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in cero eight walry but that girl on fire
Pull us over calaboaty said she heisipieicis
Ten percent in my car shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir better yet singing like mya bitch

Two jobs she get cheese her dates are my treat
