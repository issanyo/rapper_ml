[Hook: M Dot 80]
I said my end game strong
Started [?] stones but I built in the homes
Started off runnin' but my end game strong (said it's strong)
You see my end game strong (Ughhhhhhh)
I said my end game strong
Started [?] stones but I built in the homes
Fuck-Nigga hate me then I'm aiming for his dome
You see the end game strong

[Verse 1: M Dot 80]
End game strong so you know I send a pawn
Pray to Allah but I do it for Little Rock
Snakes in the grass no need to cut the lawn
I'ma fuel it with the gas then I turn the fire on
Clutchin' on this fine hoe
Slidin' till the tires go
OPF Kilo Gang they couldn't get high on
And I was focused on the end game
[?] came in and they brought a lot of [?] pain
Brody fell off started playin' with his membrane
[?] bought the whole crew 10 chains (You see us nigga)
Lil homie call me "Sensei"
Feelin' like the Asian man slidin' in that Benz thang
Thank God my end game strong
[?] any bitch dealing with a [?]
OPF OPF yeah you know it's on
OPF OPF the end game strong

[Hook: M Dot 80]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
All I know is splurgin' and swervin'
If that bitch ain't bad enough then I'm curvin'
Drop- Droptopwop and I'm ready for service
I stopped drivin' hard tops when I turned 30
Fresh off work release I'm sellin' birdies
All my old hoes textin' me, they say it's urgent
I done got so rich my bitch wish she was pregnant
If you ain't gettin' no money then you need to exit
My plug just called he say he off the X's
Cartel affiliated man highly connected (Gato, Gato)
I'm in the 6 my prices low like it was Texas
M Dot 80 with me just fucked up a 70

[Hook: M Dot 80]

[Verse 3: Jody Hus]
The head game strong so I'ma keep that bitch 'round
Everybody know Jody keep the mawfuckin' rounds
The VVs on his neck before the cash I respect
Redbones givin' neck now jump your ass up out this Lex
New shit dyslexia 50 shots [?] the sex
Inject the box and I'm poppin' out
Ain't shit there to talk about
Grab them choppers and chop it out
Mommas they stressin' out
Crack in my momma house
Dope in my auntie house
That tech you wit', brought it out
Hunnid bands on the start
Of the whole wrist wrist Cartier
With just one finger I start her
We trap this bitch like the Carter
I pull my dick out your daughter
She had a lick on my card
Diamonds look like stars
Send a pack off to Mars
That bitch get back up tomorrow
See it ain't no sorrow
All my bitches is thorough
I'm tryna conquer the world
Stay with junkies and girls
You know my end game strong
You dead, you did something wrong (Bitch)

[Hook: M Dot 80]

Started [?] stones but I built in the homes
Fuck-Nigga hate me then I'm aiming for his dome
